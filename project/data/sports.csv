Jalen Hurts and Patrick Mahomes face off again tonight in Super Bowl 59. Hurts carried the Eagles through the NFC Championship with a decisive win over the Washington Commanders, throwing for 246 yards and four total touchdowns. He’s been calm under pressure all season, handling pre-snap duties and blitzes like a veteran. But questions remain about Hurts' ability to dominate through the air, as Philadelphia leaned heavily on their run game late in the season. Can Hurts silence his critics and finally claim his first Super Bowl ring? That’s the storyline to watch tonight.Yes, Jalen Hurts will play in the Super Bowl tonight. Jalen Hurts has a lot to prove tonight. He’s 0-1 in Super Bowl appearances after that painful 38-35 loss to Kansas City two years ago. Still, Hurts balled out in that game, throwing for 304 yards and rushing for 70. He even tied a Super Bowl record with 20 points scored. Yet some critics—because of course they exist—say he needs to show more in the passing game.This season has been weird for Hurts. He started off shaky, turning the ball over too often. By midseason, the Eagles coaching staff made changes, shifting their offense to feature Saquon Barkley more. Hurts threw for over 200 yards only twice after November, which got the football world wondering if Philly’s passing game was falling apart. Spoiler: it wasn’t.In the NFC Championship Game, Hurts came through when it counted, hitting key throws and leading scoring drives with total composure. His dual-threat game has been lethal. The Chiefs' defense needs to be ready for both Hurts' arm and his legs. Otherwise, he’s taking home the Lombardi Trophy tonight.Super Bowl 59 airs tonight with massive global coverage. Expect hours of hype, pregame analysis, and endless player interviews. Fox will also stream the game on their app, with additional online streams available for fans worldwide. The broadcast will cover the game in over 25 languages, so wherever you are, you’ll have no problem tuning in.Jalen Hurts’ journey to this moment has been anything but ordinary. From losing his starting spot at Alabama to being doubted as a pro passer, he’s constantly had to fight for respect. Head coach Nick Sirianni knows Hurts is built for these moments.Sirianni said. Hurts doesn’t care about stats or external validation. In his own words,And that’s exactly what he’s done. Since 2022, Hurts holds a 42-12 record as a starter. He’s been clutch in high-pressure situations, leading game-winning drives and setting NFL records, including seven straight playoff games without an interception. His teammates see it too. Left tackle Jordan Mailata said,The Chiefs have Patrick Mahomes, a generational talent who’s been to the Super Bowl five times in six years. But Hurts isn't afraid of a challenge. He’s been through worse, and tonight could be the moment he cements his legacy. Whether Hurts throws or runs his way to victory, one thing’s for sure—he’s got Philly’s hopes on his back.","Jalen hurts has a lot to prove tonight.

Taylor Swift Has Always Been Very Supportive Of Other Musicians



Taylor Swift, the billionaire pop star, is all set to turn heads at the Super Bowl LIX. She will be spotted cheering on Travis Kelce as he takes the field against the Philadelphia Eagles. But its not just the match that is exciting; the Super Bowl halftime will see iconic artists like Kendrick Lamar and SZA taking the stage. With everyone hyped up for Kendrick’s performance, there is a speculation going on whether Taylor Swift is rivals with Kendrick Lamar.The answer to it is pretty simple; at the recent 67th Annual Grammy Awards, when Kendrick Lamar performed his iconic track, “Not Like Us”, Taylor Swift was spotted grooving to it and having the time of her life.That is not all; when Kendrick Lamar went on stage at the Grammys to accept his Grammy Award, Taylor Swift was photographed raising her glass to celebrate the iconic moment.The two popular artists also go back a long way. In 2015, Taylor Swift collaborated with the popular rapper, Kendrick Lamar, for one of her popular song, “Bad Blood”. Eight years later, in 2023, Kendrick Lamar again collaborated with the billionaire pop star to record Bad Blood (Taylor’s Version).Both Taylor Swift and Kendrick Lamar have also publicly admitted admiration for each other’s work. In 2014, in an interview with The Fader, Kendrick Lamar said, “Shout out to Taylor Swift. You can’t put great music in different genres...so I definitely can see where she’s coming from when she says that she listens to the record, and it’s a great thing for her to acknowledge that and put that good energy out into the world like that.”A few months later, in the same year, in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Taylor Swift spoke about how she wants to be best friends with the famous rapper, Kendrick Lamar, and how she is ""sad daily"" since they are not best friends.It is safe to say that Taylor Swift is gearing up to cheer for Kendrick Lamar as he takes the stage along with SZA at Super Bowl Halftime.Taylor Swift has always been pretty supportive of other artists as well. At the 67th Annual Grammy Awards, she was seen dancing when famous pop star Sabrina Carpenter performed her popular songs. Last year at the Grammys, Taylor Swift was also spotted cheering on Olivia Rodrigo as she took the stage.With Kendrick Lamar and SZA performing their popular songs, the Super Bowl LIX Halftime is going to be one of the most memorable performances.Also Read: Taylor Swift finds a new best friend as she moves on from Blake Lively - Justin Baldoni controversy and gears up for Super Bowl 2025","Taylor swift will be cheering on travis kelce as he takes the field against the philadelphia eagles.

Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel.

India pacer Harshit Rana got a stick from skipper Rohit Sharma for a needless act during the second ODI against England at the Barabati Stadium in Cuttack on Sunday.Bowling the 32nd over of the England innings, Rana bowled a dot delivery when Jos Butler defended and the ball rolled to his left in follow-through. Seeing the England captain on the edge of the crease, Rana chose to throw the ball back at the striker's end in thin hopes of a run-out, but it resulted in four overthrows as the ball went way wide to the left of wicketkeeper KL Rahul and raced to the fine-leg fence.As the dejected Rana walked back towards the top of his run-up to deliver the last ball of the 32nd over, captain Rohit made his displeasure very obvious, scolding the bowler and asking him to use his brain.England were 180 for 3 at the end of that over and went on to finish at 304 all out in 49.5 overs.Opting to bat first after winning the toss, the England innings was held together by opener Ben Duckett (65) and former captain Joe Root (69).The England middle-order saw useful contributions coming from Harry Brook (31), Buttler (34) and Liam Livingstone (41), while Ravindra Jadeja was the pick of the Indian bowlers with figures of 3 for 35.Mohammed Shami, Rana, Hardik Pandya and debutant Varun Chakravarthy took one wicket each.India lead the three-match series 1-0, which makes this a must-win game for the visitors.",India pacer harshit rana gets a stick from skipper rohit sharma for needless act.

From Size Of The Venue to Fan Fatigue, A Few Key Factors Decide Super Bowl Ticket Prices

Super Bowl 59 may very well be one of the most talked-about and heavily publicised Super Bowls in NFL history. Not only is the Kansas City Chiefs aiming for a rare three-peat, but the team’s tight end Travis Kelce is in a relationship with the most popular pop star of her generation, Taylor Swift. However, ticket prices this year for Super Bowl LIX are down significantly ahead of Sunday's game.StubHub reported this week that the ""Get In"" price was $3,229 which is 5 per cent lower than the previous day and down 43 per cent compared to this time last year. However, StubHub spokesperson Adam Budelli recently broke down why there are a few practical reasons for this.According to reports, more than 4,700 tickets are available on StubHub on Wednesday night. The average ticket price has reportedly dropped to about $6,900, which marks a 17% drop from last year. However, Budelli explains that this is not unnatural since the price drop depends upon the Caesars Superdome’s ability to accommodate over 15,000 more fans, the availability of hotel rooms, and to some extent, fan fatigue.There are 74,295 seats and six levels in the Caesars Superdome. However, the two suite levels at the Superdome are privately owned and hence exclusive. 7 per cent of all tickets sold have been buyers from Kansas or Missouri, which is surprising since this is a big game for the Kansas City Chiefs.But Budelli shares, “They’ve seen their team win. It’s hard to justify spending $10,000, year after year, if you’ve already seen it.” Budelli told AP that some tickets are still available, but they are being sold quickly.Also Read: What is Super Bowl and why is everyone googling it? “Compared to last year, which was the most expensive Super Bowl in history on StubHub, that’s actually down 56%, making this Super Bowl much more approachable — I don’t want to say affordable — when compared to last year,” Budelli said.As per Ticketmaster, historically, the average resale ticket to the Super Bowl has ranged between $4,000 and $6,000; the platform has also pointed out that the ticket price “fluctuates drastically” based on the game's location, the lineup, seat location, and date of purchase.Budelli also pointed out that the venue for last year’s Super Bowl was a big reason for the inflated prices of its tickets. Last year, the game was held in Las Vegas and the three-hour game was turned into a week full of festivities for attending fans which hiked up the prices. Budelli shared that this year’s ticket prices are more in line with the 2023 rates.We’ve seen a 14% increase in ticket purchases from Kansas City Chiefs fans. Now, the gap is around 15% from Pennsylvania and about 9% from Kansas and Missouri. While it still favours the Eagles, the numbers may improve for Chiefs fans as the weekend progresses,"" he added.Typically Super Bowl tickets get cheaper from two weeks out, reaching their lowest price on game day. In 2024, Gametime's cheapest Super Bowl ticket declined from $9,400 two weeks out to $7,100 the day of the game, which marks a 24% drop.","Stubhub reported this week that the ""get in"" price was $3,229 which is 5 per cent lower than the previous day. More than 4,700 tickets are available on stubhub on wednesday night.

Have Eagles Fans Gone Too Far with Their Travis Kelce Taunts?

New Orleans Goes Wild Over Kelce and Swift’s Pre-Super Bowl Date

Will the Chiefs Silence the Critics?

The excitement for Super Bowl LIX has reached fever pitch, with Philadelphia Eagles fans celebrating their team’s return to the biggest stage. However, in their eagerness to support their team, some fans may have crossed the line in their trolling of Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce . A recent viral video showed Eagles supporters taking swings at a piñata designed to look like Kelce, an act reminiscent of an incident that previously backfired on Buffalo Bills fans.Ahead of the highly anticipated rematch between the Chiefs and the Eagles, some Philadelphia fans were seen hitting a Kelce piñata on the streets, with bystanders cheering them on. The act has drawn mixed reactions online, with some fans defending it as lighthearted fun and others calling it unnecessary disrespect.This is not the first time rival fans have tried to mock the Chiefs’ stars. Earlier this season, Buffalo Bills fans displayed a puppet resembling Patrick Mahomes, only for the star quarterback to exact revenge by leading his team past Buffalo in the playoffs. Mahomes even trolled Bills fans by posting a meme of Kermit the Frog (the character he is often compared to) after the Chiefs’ victory.Kelce, known for his fiery competitiveness, could use the incident as extra motivation when he takes the field on Sunday. The Eagles defense, which has been one of the best in the league, will have their hands full trying to contain Mahomes and Kelce, who has a track record of delivering in big games.While Kelce prepares for the Super Bowl, his relationship with global music icon Taylor Swift continues to generate headlines. Two days before the big game, Kelce and Swift were spotted on a double date with Mahomes and his wife, Brittany, at a high-end French restaurant in New Orleans.As soon as news of their outing broke, fans gathered outside the restaurant, hoping to catch a glimpse of the couple. Some even tried to snap photos through the windows, while others attempted to take a glass believed to have been used by Swift. The scene turned chaotic, highlighting the immense popularity of the pop superstar. Even NFL legend Joe Montana had to wait outside before he could greet Mahomes.With the Chiefs on the brink of making history as the first team to win three consecutive Super Bowls, Kelce will undoubtedly be a central figure in their quest for glory. If past experiences are anything to go by, he may be more determined than ever to silence the doubters and deliver another championship performance.","Philadelphia eagles fans have been seen hitting a kelce piñata on the streets.

Travis Kelce (Chiefs, TE) – Mahomes’ favorite target could emerge as the MVP if he dominates the Eagles’ defense.



Chris Jones (Chiefs, DT) – If the game turns into a defensive battle, Kansas City’s star pass rusher could disrupt Hurts and steal the spotlight.



A.J. Brown (Eagles, WR) – A deep-threat receiver, Brown has the potential for a multi-touchdown performance that could sway MVP voting.



Who Will Be Crowned Super Bowl MVP?

The biggest stage in American football is set, as the Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles gear up for Super Bowl LIX on February 9, 2025. With both teams boasting star-studded rosters, the race for the Super Bowl MVP is heating up. All eyes are on Patrick Mahomes and Jalen Hurts, two of the league’s best quarterbacks, but could a MVP emerge?Patrick Mahomes, a three-time Super Bowl MVP, is once again the favorite to claim the title. The Chiefs’ star quarterback has a history of delivering in high-pressure situations, with a playoff record of 20-3 and over 5,500 passing yards in the postseason. His ability to make clutch plays under pressure makes him the leading candidate. On the other hand, Jalen Hurts has unfinished business. After an outstanding performance in Super Bowl LVII, where he recorded 374 total yards and four touchdowns, the Eagles quarterback is eager to finish what he started. His dual-threat ability over 3,700 passing yards and 760 rushing yards this season could make him a game-changer if the Eagles pull off a win.While quarterbacks usually dominate Super Bowl MVP voting, Saquon Barkley is a strong contender. The Eagles’ running back led the league with 2,005 rushing yards, adding 442 more yards in the playoffs. If he delivers another explosive performance, similar to his 255-yard game against the Rams, he could make history as only the third running back to win Super Bowl MVP in the last 25 years.Mahomes and Hurts remain the front-runners, but Super Bowl MVPs are often unpredictable. If the Eagles control the game with their ground attack, Barkley could take the honor. However, if Mahomes orchestrates another clutch comeback, history suggests he will walk away with his fourth MVP title.With so much at stake, Super Bowl LIX promises to deliver yet another legendary performance from the NFL’s best.","The kansas city chiefs and philadelphia eagles face off in super bowl lix on february 9, 2025.

Super Bowl overtime rules explained: What happens if the biggest game in football ends in a tie,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/super-bowl-overtime-rules-explained-what-happens-if-the-biggest-game-in-football-ends-in-a-tie/articleshow/118081619.cms,"Credit: USA Today Sports

Super Bowl Overtime Rule: How the NFL Decides a Winner in Case of a Tie



Super Bowl Overtime: How It Works

The New Overtime Rule And How To Play It

1. Duration of Overtime Periods

Each overtime period lasts 15 minutes, unlike the regular season, where overtime is capped at 10 minutes. This extended period ensures there’s enough time to determine a clear winner.

If the score remains tied after the first 15-minute period—or if the team that received the second possession hasn’t completed its initial drive—another overtime period begins. This process continues until a winner is declared.

2. Guaranteed Possession for Both Teams

One of the most significant differences from the regular season is that both teams are guaranteed a chance to possess the ball at least once in overtime. This rule was introduced prior to the 2022 season to address concerns about fairness.

In the regular season, if the team that receives the opening kickoff scores a touchdown, the game ends immediately. However, in the playoffs, even if the first team scores a touchdown, the opposing team still gets a chance to respond. This ensures a more balanced competition.

3. Scoring and Winning the Game

4. Timeouts and Challenges

5. Multiple Overtime Periods

6. Coin Toss and Captain’s Choice

Key Takeaways for Fans

Overtime periods are 15 minutes long, and multiple periods are played if necessary.

Both teams are guaranteed a possession, unless the receiving team commits a safety on the first drive.

The next score wins after both teams have had their chance, but extra points are skipped if the game ends on a touchdown.

There are no coach’s challenges, and each team gets three timeouts per half.

The Super Bowl has been around since 1967, yet only two editions have needed overtime to crown a champion. The first came in 2017 when the Patriots miraculously erased a 28-3 deficit against the Falcons, with Tom Brady leading New England to victory. The second occurred in 2024 when the Chiefs and 49ers battled into extra time, with Kansas City prevailing. Could history repeat itself? If another Super Bowl heads to OT, here’s what you need to know about the rules.The NFL’s overtime rules have always been a hot topic, especially in the playoffs, where games cannot end in a tie. While the format remains largely the same in the regular season and postseason, there are crucial distinctions in playoff overtime—especially after the rule changes introduced in 2022. These adjustments were implemented in response to intense matchups like the unforgettable Chiefs vs. Bills 2022 AFC Divisional Round, where Kansas City secured the win with a touchdown on their first overtime possession, leaving Buffalo without a chance to respond.In the NFL postseason, including the Super Bowl, overtime is designed to guarantee both teams a fair shot at victory while maintaining the intensity of the game. Here’s a breakdown of the key rules:""Both teams must have the opportunity to possess the ball at least once during the extra period, unless the team kicking off to start the overtime period scores a safety on the receiving team’s initial possession, in which case the team that kicked off is the winner."" – NFL RulebookThe only exception is if the team that begins with the ball commits a safety. In this rare scenario, the game ends, and the kicking team is declared the winner, just as in the regular season.If the first team to possess the ball doesn’t score, or if the score is tied after both teams have had a possession, the game continues, and the next score—by any method (touchdown, field goal, or safety)—wins.Importantly, if a team scores a touchdown to win the game, extra points are not attempted, as the game ends immediately upon the score.Each team is allotted three timeouts per half (with two overtime periods counting as a half). This allows for strategic clock management during the extended play.There are no coach’s challenges in overtime. All replays are initiated by the replay official, ensuring that critical calls are reviewed without disrupting the flow of the game.If the score is still tied after the first overtime period—or if the second team’s initial possession hasn’t concluded—another 15-minute period begins. There’s a two-minute intermission between overtime periods, but no halftime break after the second period.If the game remains unresolved after four overtime periods, a new coin toss takes place, and play continues until a winner emerges. The NFL is committed to playing as many overtime periods as necessary to determine a victor.""If there is still no winner at the end of a fourth overtime period, there will be another coin toss, and play will continue until a winner is declared."" – NFL RulebookOvertime begins with a coin toss, and the winning team can choose to kick, receive, defer, or select which goal to defend.If the game goes into a second overtime period, the captain who lost the first coin toss gets to make the choice—unless the team that won the toss deferred their decision initially.For NFL fans, understanding the postseason overtime rules is crucial, especially during the high-pressure moments of the playoffs. Here are the most important points to remember:These rules ensure that the NFL postseason remains one of the most exciting and fair competitions in sports, with every team given a fair shot at victory.Also Read: Jason Kelce shrugs off extra halftime rest advantage as brother Travis Kelce gears up for fifth Super Bowl appearance The NFL’s postseason overtime rules are a fascinating blend of strategy, fairness, and excitement. By guaranteeing both teams a chance to possess the ball and extending the length of overtime periods, the league has created a system that rewards skill and resilience. Whether you’re watching the Super Bowl or a nail-biting divisional playoff game, these rules ensure that the outcome is decided on the field, not by the flip of a coin. So, the next time you’re watching an overtime thriller, you’ll know exactly what’s at stake and how the game will unfold.","The super bowl has been around since 1967, yet only two editions have needed overtime to crown a champion.

Chicago Cubs Is One Of The “Worst Places” For Alex Bregman To Play In For The Upcoming MLB Season, As Per Jesse Rogers



Fans Dont Agree Chicago Cubs Is One Of The “Worst Places” For Alex Bregman To Play In



Alex Bregman, one of the most popular and talented players of Major League Baseball , is one of the last remaining free agents , with Spring Training beginning in just a couple of days. Many fans believe that Alex Bregman will rejoin his former team, the Houston Astros, after initially rejecting their $156 million offer for six years. But nothing has been confirmed yet; Alex Bregman has also received interest from other teams as well, including the Chicago Cubs.But apparently, the star played should not even consider joining the Chicago Cubs , as per ESPN ’s Jesse Rogers.On a recent episode of ESPN’s Baseball Tonight, Jesse Rogers spoke about one of the major reasons that Alex Bregman should consider for not joining the Chicago Cubs is the “environment”.ESPN’s Jesse Rogers adds, “I went to Baseball Savant, went to the Park Factors leaderboards, sorted by right-handed hitters, and just examined how much of a liability he would be playing in, in Wrigley Field.”He continues to say, “It is the most difficult ballpark of any for a right-handed hitter to double. Which is basically the most important skill that Alex Bregman needs to be chasing.”Jesse Rogers also added that had he been in Alex Bregman’s position, he would have chosen the Boston Red Sox and the Toronto Blue Jays over the Chicago Cubs. According to Jesse Rogers, MLB players and their agents should consider the environment they would be playing in for the season and how it “matches” their bat speed, skill set and swing.Apparently, Chicago Cubs would be one of the “worst places” for Alex Bregman to join, as per ESPN’s Jesse Rogers. He also goes on to add that Alex Bregman’s fly ball potency “is not nearly what it used to be” and so the Wigley Field will be one of the “worst places” for Alex to play baseball in.These strong statements of Jesse Rogers has divided fans. A fan took to X and wrote, “This is the type of overanalyzing cybermetric bs that is ruinimg baseball. To say a mlb professional hitter should avoid a destination at all cost because they may not hit as many doubles. Plenty of players for and against hit many doubles on that field. 🤦‍♂️”Another fan wrote, “You know what deep fly outs and doubles turn into when the wall is closer?

“Nance has an expiring deal, but his Bird rights could be valuable to Atlanta; the Hawks have dropped hints about keeping him around beyond this season. However, he’s also currently out of the mix as the third center behind Clint Capela and Onyeka Okongwu and might yearn to play more meaningful basketball.”

Themade a massive and historic move this season by acquiring Luka Doncic in a blockbuster trade from the Dallas Mavericks. Following the monumental deal, the Lakers’ front office, led by general manager Rob Pelinka, also secured center Mark Williams from the Charlotte Hornets. Despite these roster additions, Pelinka is not done yet, as the Lakers continue to eye potential acquisitions through the buyout market.As the season progresses, a handful of skilled players are expected to become available through buyouts, and one name that could catch the attention of Pelinka, Luka Doncic , and LeBron James is Larry Nance Jr. A former Los Angeles Lakers player, Nance has redefined his game over the years, making him a strong contender for the Lakers’ roster as they aim for a championship.Currently playing for the Atlanta Hawks, Nance is having one of the best seasons of his 10-year NBA career. In 22 appearances this season, he is averaging 8.2 points and 4.3 rebounds per game while shooting an impressive 46.4% from beyond the arc. This marks a significant improvement over his previous career-high of 41.5% from last year. Alongside his offensive development, Larry Nance Jr has emerged as a reliable defensive asset, boasting a 113 defensive rating per 100 possessions and a 0.9 defensive box plus-minus, highlighting his growth as a two-way player.Despite his success, Nance finds himself in a limited role in Atlanta, playing behind Clint Capela and Onyeka Okongwu as the team’s third center. According to John Hollinger of The Athletic, Larry Nance Jr could be eyeing a move for more significant playing time:Also read: NBA Buyout Rumors: Golden State Warriors reportedly eyeing $39 million Detroit Pistons forward to enhance perimeter offense and support Stephen Curry Larry Nance Jr’s fit with the Los Angeles Lakers seems natural given his past with the franchise. From 2015 to 2017, Nance gained recognition as one of the NBA’s most exciting dunkers. Now, with his transformation into an efficient shooter and a formidable defender, Nance could complement the Lakers’ high-powered offense. With Doncic and James running the floor, Nance could serve as an ideal screening partner, providing both rim protection and valuable spacing as a stretch forward.","Larry nance jr is having one of the best seasons of his 10-year nba career.

“The last time the Warriors won the championship, they had a sweet-shooting European big man on the roster in Nemanja Bjelica,”

“Now, this is not to say that Bojan Bogdanovic is the same player as Bjelica; Bogdanovic has more ball-handling capabilities, while Bjelica is more versatile defensively.”

“Can the Warriors gamble what’s left of their available money on someone who isn’t guaranteed to be an impactful player for them for the stretch run?”

On Wednesday, themade a historic trade by acquiring Jimmy Butler in a multi-team trade with the Miami Heat. The addition of Butler gave the Warriors an extra layer of star power as they approach the second half of the season. However, despite this high-profile acquisition, Golden State’s roster still has its flaws, particularly in terms of perimeter shooting.To address this issue, the Golden State Warriors may be eyeing a former New York Knicks forward, Bojan Bogdanovic , who could potentially land on the buyout market. Known for his sharp shooting ability, Bogdanovic could offer much-needed support to Stephen Curry and the Warriors’ offensive scheme.Clutch Points’ Jedd Pagaduan wrote Saturday.While the comparison is not perfect, the need for an experienced shooter like Bogdanovic could be significant for the Golden State Warriors, especially with Curry leading the charge.Bogdanovic, who spent the first half of the 2023-24 season with the Detroit Pistons before being traded to the Knicks, has been plagued by injuries, which have limited his time on the court. The 35-year-old forward appeared in 29 regular-season games and four playoff contests with New York, averaging 10.4 points on 37.0% three-point shooting during the regular season. He also posted 6.0 points on 40% three-point shooting in the postseason before a wrist injury and a season-ending foot injury took him out of the lineup.Though he has been cleared for on-court work, it’s unclear if Bogdanovic can fully recover in time to make a major impact.Pagaduan questioned, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding the veteran’s health.After undergoing offseason foot surgery, Bogdanovic has not appeared in any games for the Brooklyn Nets this season. Despite this, his reputation as a strong perimeter shooter makes him a potential fit for the Golden State Warriors, a team that relies heavily on long-range shooting. While he may struggle defensively, his ability to space the floor and shoot from deep could provide an immediate offensive boost for Golden State.Also read: NBA Buyout Rumor: Golden State Warriors reportedly eyeing $5.25 million NBA Champion to replace $25 million star guard; better fit for Stephen Curry and Jimmy Butler?
