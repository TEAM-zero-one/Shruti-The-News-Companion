TSN's Darren Dreger On McDavid & Crosby's Futures, 2025 Flames & More | The Insider Hotline

Connor McDavid stays composed amid speculation

As the Edmonton Oilers prepare for the 2025-26 NHL season, all eyes are on their captain, Connor McDavid, who is entering the final year of his eight-year, $100 million contract. Despite his incredible impact on the franchise, McDavid’s future in Edmonton remains uncertain and according to NHL insider Darren Dreger, that uncertainty is starting to make the organization nervous.During a recent segment, Dreger revealed that Oilers owner Daryl Katz is becoming “a little antsy” as Connor McDavid continues to deliberate on his next move. While Darren Dreger clarified that there’s “no animosity” between McDavid and the front office, he admitted there’s growing unease within the organization about the lack of progress..“There's no animosity here,” Dreger explained. “Is there nervousness building? Sure, you know, I mean, Daryl Katz is probably getting a little antsy, the owner of the Edmonton Oilers. And then that message would be delivered to Jeff Jackson and on to Stan Bowman, the general manager.”Dreger noted that Edmonton is “ready to close whenever Connor is ready,” but the timeline remains entirely in Connor McDavid’s hands. He estimated the chances of an extension happening soon at “50-50” and suggested that any potential deal could be short-term, possibly just two years, a prospect that could unsettle both management and fans.While some worry about the distractions, NHL analyst Eddie Olczyk believes McDavid won’t let the situation affect his performance. “Well, I don't think it's going to hang over Connor McDavid because, just, he breathes different air,” Olczyk said. “I don't think it's going to affect him one bit.”Also Read: Edmonton Oilers reportedly exploring shocking reunion with 40-year-old Marc-Andre Fleury Since his debut in 2015, McDavid has consistently proven to be a generational player, leading Edmonton to consecutive Stanley Cup Final appearances and surpassing the 100-point mark eight times.

Vanessa Bryant has proudly been a dog mom for many years

Vanessa Bryant warmed hearts online once again. Vanessa shared sweet moments with her furry companion. The 43-year-old businesswoman and philanthropist shared a pair of endearing photos on her Instagram Story, cuddling with her tiny white puppy. Playfully setting the moment to Meghan Trainor’s ‘I’m a Dog Mom’ and Lil Baby Grand’s ‘DtMF’ (Piano version), Bryant gave her 15.6 million followers a glimpse of her soft, humorous side while teasing that she’s officially embracing her “dog mom” era.Vanessa Bryant’s Instagram feed is often filled with loving snapshots of her daughters, but her latest post shifted focus to another member of the Bryant household— the family’s adorable teacup dog. The photos showed her holding the fluffy pup close, planting gentle hugs, and sharing what looked like an afternoon of pure affection.Fans immediately recognized the tiny dog that has made recurring appearances in her posts over the past year. Earlier this summer, Bryant posted about the same pup after it accidentally smeared red lipstick across its fur, leading to a hilarious and heartwarming cleanup moment. Despite the mischief, Bryant couldn’t resist showing love, sealing the moment with another sweet kiss.It’s not the first time she’s shared glimpses of their bond. In a past post, she captured her pet sound asleep on her lap, writing, “Can’t move now,” proving that even a small dog can take over her heart— and her couch. The Bryant family has also been seen traveling with the little companion, with Natalia Bryant once posing with it during a walk through Central Park in New York City.Vanessa’s affection for her pets goes beyond the occasional social media post. Alongside her teacup pup, she’s also mom to a German Shepherd named Loki , who joined the family in early 2022. “My girls are happy,” she wrote at the time, sharing a photo with her daughters and their new “Big Boy.” Loki’s arrival helped fill the void left by Crucio, the beloved family dog who passed away just a month prior.""We love you, Crucio,"" she wrote in her farewell post. ""Thank you for everything sweet boy. Thank you for watching over us. We’re going to miss you. #GoodBoy #RestEasy.""Over the years, Vanessa Bryant has used her platform to share moments of love, family, and healing.

Matthew Knies reveals shocker about girlfriend Ella Huber



Why Matthew Knies is still keeping his focus on the Leafs’ big goals



It’s been a busy off-season for the Toronto Maple Leafs, with key extensions and big roster moves making headlines. Amid all the contract news and locker-room optimism, one story stood out for its raw human touch. Rising Leafs star Matthew Knies, who recently appeared on the Spittin’ Chiclets podcast, revealed something unexpectedly emotional about his girlfriend, Ella Huber—a moment that reminded fans that even NHL stars face bittersweet turns in life.While Knies’ six-year, team-friendly deal with Toronto drew plenty of praise, it wasn’t his contract that grabbed everyone’s attention during his podcast appearance. Instead, it was a heartfelt revelation about Huber, who was recently drafted into the PWHL by the Boston Fleet.During the chat, producer Mike Grinnell asked Knies where he was most excited to travel this season, subtly hinting at Boston. Unaware of the connection at first, Knies answered “Anaheim and Vegas,” before realizing the joke. But when the topic turned serious, Knies admitted just how close his girlfriend was to joining him in Toronto.“Toronto had the next pick, so that’s a huge bummer, but it happens... I think we kind of had it pretty locked in [the Sceptres selecting Huber], I mean, it happens,” Knies shared candidly.Huber was chosen by Boston with the second pick in the second round, while the Toronto Sceptres went on to select forward Emma Gentry. For Knies, it was a bittersweet twist—his team’s hometown counterpart nearly drafted the woman he loves.Despite the emotional moment, Knies didn’t let disappointment overshadow his team-first mindset. His humble tone throughout the interview reflected his grounded personality—something that’s quickly made him a fan favorite in Toronto.Knies’ willingness to sign a deal worth under $8 million per season, when he could have easily asked for more, speaks volumes about his commitment to the Leafs’ long-term success. Alongside captain John Tavares, who also agreed to a surprisingly modest extension, Knies is helping set a new tone in the locker room—one built on loyalty, balance, and shared goals.As the 2025–26 season approaches, Knies has his eyes set on leading the Leafs back to the top of the Atlantic Division and chasing that elusive Stanley Cup. And while the distance between Toronto and Boston may test his relationship, it’s clear that Knies and Huber share the same drive—to succeed, no matter where the ice takes them.Also Read: Can the Panthers complete a three-peat?

Four new teams enter Brady’s top 10, highlighting the chaos and unpredictability of Week 5

Week 5 proves that no team is safe as Brady’s power rankings reflect the NFL’s unpredictable reality

Week 5 shook the NFL to its core, and even Tom Brady couldn’t keep his power rankings the same. After the once-unbeaten Eagles and Bills both stumbled, the GOAT had no choice but to crown a new No. 1. Brady’s latest rankings reflect a season of unpredictable upsets, shifting momentum, and teams stepping up when it mattered most.Tom Brady had said all season that the defending champions would hold the No. 1 spot until beaten. That moment arrived when the Philadelphia Eagles fell to the Denver Broncos. Brady wasted no time naming the Detroit Lions as his new leader.“At No. 1 are the Detroit Lions,” he said. “Yeah, they got out to a slow start this year in Week 1. But since then, they’ve been on fire. [Jared] Goff and that offense have looked amazing. They’re going to be challenged, though, next week at Kansas City.”Detroit’s balance, Goff’s precision, and the offense’s recent surge make this a deserved top spot — but Brady acknowledges the Lions’ true test is just ahead.Even after the loss, Brady kept his faith in Philadelphia. “The Eagles come in at No. 2, dropping from the top spot.I’ve always said if you wanna beat the best, then you’ve got to beat the best. Denver went to Philly and got it done. But I still see the Eagles as one of the top teams in the NFC.”Brady emphasized that the Eagles’ defeat is not a signal of decline but a reminder of how competitive the league is — and that even champions must stay sharp.Brady highlighted Tampa Bay’s triumph in Seattle, praising the difficulty of road victories. “The Bucs go on the road and [beat] Seattle. Does anyone know how hard it is to play there? I see you, Baker [Mayfield], talking that s---. You go, man! When you play like that, you can always talk that s---.”The Buccaneers’ energy and composure caught Brady’s eye, reminding fans that the team remains a force to be reckoned with despite an inconsistent season.Buffalo’s tough loss to New England dropped them from No. 2 to No. 4 in Brady’s rankings. “Buffalo drops from No. 2 to No. 4 with their tough loss against the Pats. This was their first hiccup. So, we’ll see how they rebound,” Brady said.Meanwhile, the Jacksonville Jaguars surged into No. 5 after wins over the 49ers and Chiefs. “Jacksonville jumps from outside the top 10 to No. 5 this week with a huge win over the Chiefs. That’s back-to-back wins over the 49ers and Chiefs. Jacksonville, what more can you do than that?”Brady admitted, “There are probably about 15 teams that deserve to be in the top 10.” His updated list features San Francisco 49ers at No. 6, Indianapolis Colts at No. 7, Denver Broncos at No. 8, Green Bay Packers at No. 9, and New England Patriots at No. 10.These changes underscore how quickly the NFL hierarchy can shift in a season filled with surprises, upsets, and momentum swings.Brady’s Week 5 power rankings are more than a list — they’re a reflection of a league where dominance can vanish overnight and underdogs can rise in dramatic fashion. Even the GOAT himself had to adjust, proving that this NFL season will keep fans on the edge of their seats every single week.Also read: Chiefs' heiress Gracie Hunt’s fiery red look turned Monday Night Football into a runway, leaving fans and family in awe","Detroit lions move up to no. 1 in tom brady's latest nfl power rankings.

Connor McDavid’s loyalty shows, but the Oilers still face major tests



Can Connor McDavid finally lead Edmonton to the promised land?



The Edmonton Oilers secured the biggest move of their offseason — and perhaps their decade — when superstar captain Connor McDavid signed a two-year contract extension worth $25 million. The deal, which kicks in at the start of the 2026-27 season, keeps the 28-year-old under team control through 2028 and gives the Oilers a much-needed sense of direction. But even with McDavid’s future locked in, plenty of uncertainty remains around a team that has come painfully close to glory.Connor McDavid’s new deal reflects both loyalty and caution. At $12.5 million per year, it’s notably less than teammate Leon Draisaitl’s $14 million — a conscious choice by McDavid, who, according to general manager Stan Bowman, “wants to win.” The captain could have easily commanded the league’s maximum salary, but instead, he opted for a team-friendly extension, showing his commitment to keeping Edmonton competitive.This decision underscores McDavid’s character and connection to the city. His wife, Lauren, even opened a local restaurant earlier this year, further rooting their family in Edmonton. But despite his devotion, McDavid has made it clear that winning is his only goal. After two straight Stanley Cup Final losses, he’s seeking assurance that the organization can deliver the final piece of his legacy — a championship.Head coach Kris Knoblauch echoed the captain’s mindset. “Everything has to go right,” he said. “You have to build and become a good, solid team and be able to win different ways.” His optimism, however, comes with caution. The Oilers boast elite top-end talent, but their goaltending, defensive consistency, and lineup depth continue to raise questions.McDavid’s brilliance has never been in doubt. The reigning Conn Smythe winner has already collected three Hart Trophies, five Art Ross titles, and more than 1,000 career points. Yet, team success has remained elusive. Edmonton’s challenge now lies in transforming individual greatness into collective dominance.Goaltending remains the team’s most scrutinized area. Starter Stuart Skinner dropped 15 pounds in the offseason and appears more agile, while veteran Calvin Pickard returns as backup. Bowman insists, “We have confidence in our two guys,” but fans remain skeptical after last season’s inconsistency.Defensively, Edmonton leans on its reliable pairings — Mattias Ekholm with Evan Bouchard, and Darnell Nurse with newly extended Jake Walman. Health, however, will be crucial. The team also needs young players like rookie Matt Savoie to inject energy into a lineup that’s starting to age.History offers a warning.

Sidney Crosby’s brilliance endures even as the Penguins reset

Legacy, loyalty, and the temptation of a new challenge

Sidney Crosby has built a legacy few players in NHL history can match but as he enters his 21st season, uncertainty looms over how his story in Pittsburgh will end. The 38-year-old captain, who has been the face of the Penguins since 2005, remains one of hockey’s most consistent and respected stars. Yet, with the franchise shifting toward a rebuild, even his unwavering loyalty is being tested.Sidney Crosby’s numbers remain elite by any standard, 91 points in 80 games last season and his peers continue to recognize his dominance. In the NHLPA’s annual poll, he was voted the league’s “most complete player” for the sixth straight year. Still, the Penguins’ reality has shifted.Their 16-year playoff streak ended in 2023, and general manager Kyle Dubas has embraced a youth-driven rebuild. With a roster featuring five rookies and first-year head coach Dan Muse, the Penguins are looking to the future rather than the past.That reality raises a difficult question: is one of the game’s greatest players wasting his final years waiting for a turnaround that may not come soon? Some, including Crosby’s longtime agent Pat Brisson, believe it’s time for him to chase playoff hockey elsewhere. Yet Crosby’s mindset remains fixed on loyalty and preparation.“I know that if all my energy isn’t towards what it needs to be, then I’m not giving myself the best chance for it to be successful,” Crosby said. “If it ever came to that point, I would discuss it, but I don’t feel like I’m there.”Crosby’s connection to Pittsburgh runs deeper than trophies. He’s transformed youth hockey in the city through programs like Little Penguins Learn to Play and remains deeply involved in the community, often visiting hospitals away from the cameras. Teammate Kris Letang calls him “the perfect ambassador for the game.”Also Read: Sidney Crosby to make NHL history by tying Steve Yzerman’s record for longest-serving captain For now, Crosby is focused on leading Team Canada at the upcoming Olympics and mentoring a young Penguins squad. But as his two-year, team-friendly contract begins, speculation about a potential final chapter elsewhere will only grow. Whether Crosby finishes his career as a lifelong Penguin or seeks one last shot at glory, will define how hockey’s most enduring superstar writes his final act.","Sidney crosby has been the face of the penguins since 2005.

Divided Fanbase and Insider Insights

Thehave once again become the epicenter of NBA trade speculation, with reports suggesting a potential blockbuster move involving LeBron James and former Golden State Warriors sharpshooter. The rumor mill has been in overdrive as analysts and fans debate whether the Lakers could part ways with their 40-year-old superstar in exchange for shooting depth and long-term flexibility, marking a potential turning point for both franchises.The idea of LeBron James being traded is one that immediately commands attention, especially as he enters the final year of his contract after opting into his $52.6 million player option. With the Los Angeles Lakers facing pressure to maximize what remains of their championship window, the franchise’s front office appears to be exploring all options. Meanwhile, Klay Thompson - now a Dallas Maverick - remains one of the league’s most respected shooters. Despite being 35, he averaged 14 points per game and shot 39.1% from beyond the arc last season, proving that his perimeter touch is still elite.The Lakers have long been known for pursuing star talent, and their current situation might call for a major shake-up. Recent reports indicate that the team is considering trading LeBron James to the Dallas Mavericks in a multi-player deal that would bring Klay Thompson, Daniel Gafford, Caleb Martin, and Naji Marshall - along with potential draft assets - to Los Angeles.This trade would offer the Los Angeles Lakers improved depth, stronger defense, and reliable shooting while opening the door for a soft rebuild around Anthony Davis. For Dallas, it would form a new superteam featuring LeBron, Kyrie Irving, and Davis - a high-risk, high-reward trio capable of shifting the Western Conference power balance overnight.Even at age 40, LeBron James continues to deliver elite production and remains one of the NBA’s most influential figures - both on and off the court. His ability to impact games and elevate teammates keeps him in the conversation as a franchise-altering player. However, his expiring contract complicates potential trade scenarios, as many teams are wary of giving up key assets for a short-term rental.Adding to the drama are LeBron’s cryptic social media posts hinting at what fans are calling a “Second Decision,” which have fueled speculation about a possible retirement announcement or a move to a new team. While it’s still more likely that LeBron remains in Los Angeles for the 2025-26 season, reports suggest that Lakers GM Rob Pelinka is open to exploring offers - indicating that no player is completely untouchable if the right deal emerges.For Los Angeles, adding Klay Thompson could fill a glaring need for consistent three-point shooting and veteran leadership. A career 41.1% shooter from deep, Thompson’s spacing would complement Anthony Davis perfectly, giving the Los Angeles Lakers a more balanced offense. His three-year, $50 million deal is also relatively team-friendly, helping the Lakers navigate luxury tax issues while maintaining roster flexibility.Reactions from the Los Angeles Lakers’ fanbase have been mixed. Some believe moving on from LeBron could allow the team to build a younger, more sustainable core around Davis and new complementary pieces. Others see trading LeBron as a massive gamble - one that risks alienating fans and sacrificing the chance to compete for another title in his final elite years.NBA insiders, however, suggest that the Los Angeles Lakers will only pull the trigger if the return package is overwhelmingly in their favor. Many believe the front office may ultimately prefer to ride out LeBron’s contract and reassess next offseason, especially given his influence, marketability, and continued production.Whether or not the proposed trade materializes, the idea of Klay Thompson donning the purple and gold while LeBron James reunites with Kyrie Irving in Dallas has captured the imagination of basketball fans everywhere. It underscores the fluid nature of modern NBA roster construction - where even legends can find themselves on the trade block.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Los Angeles Lakers Potentially Eyeing $54.2 Million Dallas Mavericks Star to Bolster Squad and Improve Title Odds As the 2025-26 season approaches, the Los Angeles Lakers’ willingness to entertain such monumental moves only highlights the league’s constant pursuit of reinvention. Whether these rumors turn into reality or remain offseason chatter, they’ve already added another compelling chapter to the ever-evolving story of LeBron James, Klay Thompson, and the Los Angeles Lakers.","The los angeles lakers are reportedly considering trading lebron james to the dallas mavericks.

LeBron James’ much-hyped “Second Decision”

A Fresh Chapter in the LeBron–Hennessy Partnership

The Story Behind “The Second Decision”

Why This is More Than a Brand Endorsement

LeBron James Second Decision announcement dropped (Image via Getty)

has finally been revealed and it’s not a retirement announcement or a shocking trade move. Instead, it’s a creative marketing masterstroke: a new Hennessy campaign celebrating the next phase of his partnership with the luxury cognac brand. Titled “The Second Decision,” this campaign transforms the iconic narrative of LeBron’s 2010 broadcast “The Decision” into a cultural moment that celebrates craftsmanship, community, and legacy through a limited-edition cognac release.In October 2025, Hennessy and LeBron James officially launched the Hennessy V.S.O.P Limited Edition by LeBron James - a vibrant orange bottle inspired by LeBron’s signature “crowning” gesture, symbolizing excellence, leadership, and empowerment. The bold color reflects his dynamic persona and the creative energy behind the collaboration.This campaign builds upon the partnership that began in 2024, combining Hennessy’s heritage of artistry and precision with LeBron James’ global influence on culture, sport, and style. More than a product release, “The Second Decision” serves as a modern cultural statement, reimagining LeBron’s most famous TV moment as a celebration of unity and shared values rather than competition or controversy.Unlike the 2010 announcement that forever changed the NBA landscape, “The Second Decision” is about connection and community. Through a cinematic campaign and viral social media rollout, LeBron steps back into the spotlight — this time not as a free agent making headlines, but as a storyteller bridging the worlds of sport and luxury.The campaign’s tone is celebratory and self-aware, blending humor with nostalgia. In playful scenes, LeBron can be seen handling a Hennessy bottle like a basketball, nodding to his competitive spirit while keeping things light and engaging. The content leans into meme culture and fan interaction, showing LeBron’s comfort with self-parody and reinforcing his approachable charisma.What makes this partnership stand out is its authenticity. LeBron personally visited the Hennessy Maison in Cognac, France, where he learned about the meticulous artistry and dedication behind every bottle. The visit deepened his appreciation for the brand’s craftsmanship and its emphasis on legacy - values that mirror his own career journey.Antoine Varlet, Senior Vice President of Hennessy U.S., has praised LeBron as a global figure who “redefines boundaries in sport, style, and culture.” Their collaboration isn’t merely transactional; it’s built on shared principles of excellence, creativity, and cultural relevance.By reviving “The Decision” in this new form, LeBron and Hennessy transform one of sports’ most polarizing events into a symbol of growth and legacy. Back in 2010, LeBron James’ televised choice to join the Miami Heat reshaped basketball history and became a defining cultural moment. Now, “The Second Decision” reframes that narrative, replacing tension with celebration - a toast to evolution, partnership, and the joy of shared experiences.The campaign positions this limited-edition release as a milestone in modern branding - one that merges luxury and lifestyle, and sport with storytelling. Rather than centering on a career move, it focuses on elevating cultural collaboration to an art form.At its core, LeBron’s “Second Decision” is about more than promoting a drink; it’s about building bridges between communities. The campaign encourages people to connect, celebrate, and create memories together - values that resonate both in basketball arenas and at social gatherings worldwide. By fusing humor, authenticity, and heritage, the campaign reflects a new kind of marketing where icons and brands co-create culture.LeBron James’ “Second Decision” stands as a testament to how storytelling and branding can evolve into something deeper than advertising. Through this bold Hennessy collaboration, LeBron transforms a defining moment in his career into a celebration of artistry, community, and cultural influence.Also read: Is LeBron James Retiring?

Impact on the Preseason Game

Theandclash in a preseason matchup on October 7, 2025, with both teams managing a series of injuries that shaped their rotations, playing time, and overall strategy heading into the contest. The game serves as an important early test of roster depth and player readiness for the upcoming NBA season.The Cleveland Cavaliers enter the game shorthanded, missing two of their starting guards - Max Strus and Darius Garland . Strus has been ruled out with a foot injury expected to keep him sidelined until at least December, while Garland is recovering from a toe issue projected to last through early November. These absences leave Cleveland without key pieces of its offensive core, forcing adjustments to both playmaking and spacing.In addition, Craig Porter Jr. is listed as probable due to a hamstring concern, though his minutes were expected to be limited. With two starters out and one key reserve recovering, the Cleveland Cavaliers rely more heavily on their bench and rotational flexibility to keep pace. The coaching staff are expected to use this opportunity to experiment with new lineup combinations and assess younger players’ readiness under game conditions.The Chicago Bulls are also dealing with injury concerns of their own, most notably surrounding rising star Coby White. The talented guard has been sidelined since the summer with a calf strain and did not practice the day before the game, making his participation in the preseason opener unlikely. Head coach Billy Donovan confirmed that White hadn’t been active in practice and emphasized the importance of caution in his return timeline. Donovan also noted that most regular starters would likely be capped at 15 - 20 minutes of playing time, with medical staff monitoring workloads closely to prevent further issues.Another setback for Chicago resulted when Patrick Williams sustained an ankle injury during practice just days prior. He is listed as day-to-day and is expected to be evaluated ahead of each game. This marks another unfortunate injury chapter in Williams’ young career, as past injuries have already limited his consistency and growth within the Chicago Bulls’ system.Both teams wil be approaching this preseason clash with an emphasis on evaluation rather than competition. The Cleveland Cavaliers lean on versatile guard Lonzo Ball, who faced his former team for the first time since joining Cleveland. Ball’s leadership and defensive presence were valuable as Cleveland tested its second-unit chemistry without Strus and Garland.For Chicago, Nikola Vucevic and Ayo Dosunmu take on larger roles in the absence of White, providing structure and scoring balance for the lineup. Donovan hinted earlier that the Chicago Bulls would use a “pretty deep rotation,” giving several young players and fringe roster hopefuls meaningful minutes. This not only helped the coaching staff gauge player performance under pressure but also ensured that key contributors remained healthy ahead of the regular season.The cautious tone adopted by both organizations really goes to show their long-term priorities. For the Cleveland Cavaliers , getting Garland and Strus back in time for the early regular season stretch remains a top concern. Both players are essential to Cleveland’s offensive rhythm and spacing, and their absence gives valuable minutes to the team’s younger guards and new additions.Meanwhile, the Chicago Bulls are being careful with Coby White’s recovery, especially given his expected role as the team’s main scoring option following Zach LaVine’s departure. His ability to stay healthy and return to form will be vital for Chicago’s offensive identity. Patrick Williams’ ankle recovery is another storyline to monitor, as his development continues to be central to the Bulls’ long-term plans.Both franchises appear committed to balancing player health with competitive preparation, using the preseason to build rhythm while safeguarding their key assets. Fans were treated to an early glimpse of new combinations, strategic experimentation, and the depth each team hopes will carry them through the grueling 2025 - 26 season.Also read: Chicago Bulls vs Cleveland Cavaliers Preseason Game Preview, Prediction, Spread, Odds, Best Prop Bets, and Betting Guide (October 7, 2025) Ultimately, the October 7 matchup between the Cleveland Cavaliers and Chicago Bulls isn't just about the scoreboard - it is about patience and prioritizing health. Even in preseason, both organizations are making it clear that sustaining long-term success outweighs short-term performance, setting the tone for a strategic and disciplined approach as the regular season approaches.","Cleveland cavaliers take on chicago bulls in a preseason matchup on october 7, 2025.

Minnesota Timberwolves Injury Report for Tonight’s Game Against the Indiana Pacers (October 7, 2025)

Game and Season Implications for Both Teams

Overall Assessment for Tonight’s Timberwolves vs Pacers Preseason Game

Thewill square off in their preseason matchup on October 7, 2025, with both teams entering the contest from contrasting positions in terms of roster health and readiness. While Minnesota will enter the game with a clean injury slate, the Pacers will be forced to adjust their rotation due to multiple absences in the backcourt, potentially impacting their preseason rhythm and lineup experimentation.The Indiana Pacers will face several setbacks ahead of their preseason opener. Rookie guard Kam Jones will be out for the majority of the preseason due to a lingering back issue. The team expects him to miss around two to three weeks, and he will not have participated fully in training sessions by the time of the game. His absence will be particularly concerning given the Indiana Pacers’ limited depth at the guard position this season, especially after All-Star Tyrese Haliburton was ruled out for the entire year with an Achilles tendon tear. Jones will be viewed as an important addition who could provide energy and versatility off the bench.Adding to the list of concerns, shooting guard Ben Sheppard will also be sidelined for the game against the Minnesota Timberwolves with an undisclosed injury.However, head coach Rick Carlisle will offer a glimmer of optimism, stating that Sheppard could resume practice soon and may return for the team’s next preseason outing.To compensate for these losses, Carlisle will turn to several young and rotational players to step up. Johnny Furphy, Jarace Walker, and veteran guard Delon Wright will all be expected to see increased minutes, along with two-way contract players Quenton Jackson and Taelon Peter, who could provide temporary support in the backcourt. With Haliburton unavailable for the season, the Indiana Pacers’ depth will be tested early, forcing them to evaluate new combinations and offensive setups during these preseason contests.In contrast, the Minnesota Timberwolves will enter the matchup in excellent health, with no injuries expected to affect player availability. The team will field its core lineup featuring Mike Conley at point guard, Anthony Edwards at shooting guard, Jaden McDaniels at small forward, Julius Randle at power forward, and Rudy Gobert anchoring the center position.While Minnesota may rest a few players in earlier preseason action, all key contributors are expected to be cleared to play against the Indiana Pacers. This will provide head coach Chris Finch with a valuable opportunity to fine-tune rotations and assess how the newly integrated roster pieces will mesh with the returning Western Conference Finals core.For Indiana, the absences of Jones, Sheppard, and Haliburton will create immediate challenges, particularly on the perimeter. The lack of depth in the guard rotation will place extra responsibility on the remaining players to initiate offense and maintain defensive intensity. Carlisle will emphasize the importance of the preseason as a proving ground for emerging talent, viewing matchups against strong teams like the Minnesota Timberwolves and the Thunder as key tests for evaluating player readiness and lineup efficiency.Minnesota, meanwhile, will enjoy the advantage of stability. With a full-strength squad available, the Timberwolves will enter the game with strong momentum following last season’s deep playoff run. Their ability to stay healthy early on could be a major factor in sustaining performance heading into the regular season.The October 7, 2025, preseason contest will underscore two very different trajectories for these teams. The Indiana Pacers will continue finding their footing amidst injury setbacks, focusing on development and depth exploration, while the Minnesota Timberwolves will leverage their continuity and health to sharpen team chemistry and execution.Also read: Minnesota Timberwolves vs Indiana Pacers Preseason Game Preview, Odds, Spread, Best Prop Bets, and Betting Guide (October 7, 2025) As both teams move deeper into preseason play, health management and player evaluation will remain central to their strategies. For Indiana, the goal will be to navigate early adversity and identify reliable contributors, while Minnesota’s emphasis will remain on maintaining rhythm and cohesion as they prepare for another competitive season.","The minnesota timberwolves and indiana pacers will square off in their preseason matchup on october 7, 2025.

Before that triumph, however, ESPN caught an awkward moment on camera: while sitting on Jacksonville’s bench, Lawrence appeared to look straight into the camera and pick his nose, seemingly unaware he was being recorded. The episode did not go unnoticed—after the NFL shared a video of Lawrence’s stumbling touchdown, the sports community Pick6 commented on his nose-picking incident, captioning it: “It’s because Trevor Lawrence picked 6 before this drive 🤝.”Trevor Lawrence’s iconic game-winning touchdown came after he stumbled twice, got up, and ran one yard for a leaping score—capturing everyone’s attention. A fan criticized the Kansas City Chiefs’ defense, commenting, “Bo*ty che*ks defense. Dude had enough time to fall, dust himself off, and trot into the end zone. 🤣🤣🤣.” Another added, “Defense so bad they can't even get the guy down who put himself on the ground 😂😭. ” Lawrence’s touchdown changed the score from 28-24 to 28-30, giving the Jaguars the lead in the fourth quarter with only 23 seconds left. Despite the thrilling finish, the sports community Pick6 chose to refocus attention on Lawrence’s embarrassing video of him picking his nose. One fan commented, “Even star quarterbacks get b*ogers but your not supposed to go mining for gold on national TV. To his credit he didn’t flick it or eat it on live TV…”Reactions followed quickly after viewers witnessed Lawrence pick his nose live on camera.Fans responded with humor and understanding: “Man’s gotta do what a man’s gotta do,” one said. Another commented, “You can’t operate at peak performance with a b*oger situation. Jags lose that game if he’s distracted by an obstruction to his air intake.” Some defended Lawrence, writing, “F*ck off to everyone who acts like they don’t pick their nose. Get off your high horse a*sh*les.” Others made playful remarks: “Pick six and pick nose,” and “Be honest, most of y'all pick your nose too 😭🙏🏾.” Fans also encouraged more discreet behavior: “Come on, get a tissue 🤧,” while another speculated, “Ai is getting crazy.” “Me and family saw Trev do that on National TV...Come on Trev...” one wrote, and others concluded, “Leave him alone dude,” and “Nasty work by ESPN.”","Trevor lawrence led the jacksonville jaguars to an impressive 31-28 comeback victory over the kansas city chiefs on monday night.

Carmelo Anthony predicts New York Knicks will be the number one seed this season

Key injuries create an open path for New York Knicks dominance in the East

Philadelphia 76ers struggle to contain New York Knicks in back-to-back preseason losses

Carmelo Anthony is done holding back. The ex-Knicks star genuinely thinks this is New York's year. After seeing their preseason victories and roster improvements, he’s declaring them the top seed in the East and possibly even beyond. It may sound daring, but considering the new coach, fresh vibes, and competitors crumbling, maybe Melo isn’t so out there after all.During the NBC event, Carmelo Anthony stated, “They have everything. The players, the point guard. We have the best big man shooter possibly in history, Mike Brown, Brunson, offball, Clarkson, Brogdon. I watch preseason, see the fast pace, the system…I just…Knicks would be #1 seed–and I just dropped the mic.” He talked to reporters and fellow analysts, including Reggie Miller, stressing the New York Knicks' preparedness after years of hard work.Carmelo Anthony, who played for the New York Knicks from 2011 to 2017, often referred to the team as ""we,"" which shows he still feels a bond with them.He elaborated that the New York Knicks have been ""primed for this position for the past three, four years,"" focusing on their effective strategy, players, and the leadership from the point guard.Carmelo Anthony specifically acknowledged the role of new head coach Mike Brown, guard Jalen Brunson's off-ball contributions, and the bench additions such as guard Jordan Clarkson and guard Malcolm Brogdon.His prediction is that the New York Knicks will not only lead the regular-season standings but also represent the Eastern Conference in the NBA Finals, a view that Reggie Miller shares. ""if the New York Knicks don’t come out of the East this year, something is wrong.""The Eastern Conference is looking good for the New York Knicks because some of their main rivals are dealing with injuries. Indiana Pacers guard Tyrese Haliburton is out for the whole season after tearing his Achilles in the last Finals.Boston Celtics forward Jayson Tatum is also on the mend from an Achilles injury and might be back by March, but it’s still up in the air. Meanwhile, Philadelphia 76ers center Joel Embiid doesn’t have a set timeline for his knee issues that caused problems for his team last season. With these key players sidelined, the New York Knicks have a great chance to take charge, as Carmelo Anthony pointed out in his analysis.The early preseason outcomes back up Carmelo Anthony's perspective. The New York Knicks took down the Philadelphia 76ers in two games held in Abu Dhabi, winning 99-84 and 112-104. After the second game, guard Jalen Brunson, who scored 14 points, shared his thoughts with reporters, “I’m comfortable. We’re still adjusting, and that’s the process of this entire season. You’re not just gonna be who you are at the end of training camp. You’re gonna continue to get better throughout the season.”Brunson pointed out how he's adapting to Mike Brown's quick offense, showcasing enhanced pace and ball movement, although there are still some small problems like turnovers.With a strong team, new coaching energy, and some setbacks for their rivals, the New York Knicks are set for a great season. Carmelo Anthony's confident prediction emphasizes the expectation that they will end their championship drought that has lasted since 1973.The front office's willingness to make significant changes, like firing Thibodeau, indicates their commitment to achieving success. If they can maintain their health, the New York Knicks could realize Carmelo Anthony's vision and take control of the Eastern Conference.Also Read: Stephen Curry praises Moses Moody after dropping 19 points in 15 minutes","Carmelo anthony predicts new york knicks will be the number one seed this season.
