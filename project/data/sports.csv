Punjab cross the 300-run mark

After enduring a series of low scores on his comeback to the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy as Punjab ’s captain, Abhishek Sharma produced a breathtaking counterattack on Sunday morning, hammering a record-breaking century against a seasoned Bengal bowling attack at the Gymkhana Ground in Hyderabad.Sent out to open after Punjab opted to bat first, Abhishek found rhythm immediately. He blasted his way to a half-century in just 12 deliveries, launching into his former SunRisers Hyderabad teammate Mohammed Shami for 23 runs in a single over.The scale of the assault was astonishing. By the time he reached his fifty, the left-hander had scored 50 of his first 51 runs in boundaries, smashing five sixes and five fours to leave Bengal stunned.Alongside him, Prabhsimran Singh also fired up early, helping Punjab surge past 120 inside eight overs. Abhishek continued to muscle sixes straight down the ground, repeatedly targeting the V region with brutal precision.The carnage didn’t stop. Abhishek stormed to a century in 32 balls, finishing with 11 sixes and seven fours before reaching triple figures. This knock marked his eighth T20 hundred in 157 innings, bringing him level with Rohit Sharma.Among Indian batters, only Virat Kohli (nine) has more T20 centuries.Just last season, Abhishek smashed a 28-ball hundred against Meghalaya, the joint-fastest by any Indian in T20 cricket. He also struck 87 sixes in T20s in 2024, the most by an Indian man in a single year.With 16 sixes in this innings alone, Abhishek went past his 2024 tally, becoming the first Indian to cross 90 T20 sixes in a calendar year.Abhishek eventually departed for a spectacular 148 off 52 balls, with 16 sixes and eight fours, but not before powering Punjab to a score beyond 300. They have now become only the second Indian T20 side, after Baroda against Sikkim in 2024, to breach the 300-run barrier.","Abhishek sharma smashes a record-breaking century for punjab.

Bo Bichette’s injuries spark big concern as MLB analysts explain Blue Jays’ slow approach

Bo Bichette is in the news again as MLB analysts wonder why the Toronto Blue Jays have still not re-signed him. The questions grew louder this week when the team signed starting pitcher Dylan Cease to a seven-year, two hundred and ten million dollar deal. Many fans thought the team would sign Bo Bichette first because he is one of their top players. Instead, the Blue Jays chose to move fast with Dylan Cease, and that raised doubts.On Thursday, Jeff O’Neill, Bryan Hayes and Dave Feschuk spoke about this on TSN’s “Overdrive” show from Toronto. They said the delay with Bo Bichette may show that the team has concerns. They also said there could be “red flags” that the Blue Jays are thinking about before offering a long contract.Bryan Hayes said the Toronto Blue Jays may still be trying to understand Bo Bichette’s true market value. He explained that the team did not need to study Dylan Cease’s price because many teams were already ready to offer him big money.But with Bo Bichette, he said the team may be unsure about the right number. He added that Bo Bichette may also believe he should get top pay, but that does not always match what a team wants to spend.Dave Feschuk then spoke about Bo Bichette’s injury issues. He said these injuries cannot be ignored.He explained that Bo Bichette was not healthy for most of the playoffs last year. He also said that the shortstop missed a large part of the 2024 season when the Blue Jays finished last in the American League East. Dave Feschuk said these things matter because teams think carefully before giving a long contract that covers many years.Bo Bichette missed eighty-one games in the 2024 season. His injuries included right knee tendonitis, a right quad strain and a right calf strain. He missed the final month of the regular season while he was leading MLB in hits. He returned only for the World Series.Dave Feschuk also said teams may be more careful with money because the next Collective Bargaining Agreement talks will happen after the 2026 season.He said some teams believe a salary cap could arrive, so they do not want to spend too much before the MLB rules change. Bo Bichette has been a career point two nine four hitter with one hundred eleven home runs and four hundred thirty-seven RBIs. His hitting numbers remain strong, but teams must decide how his injuries will affect his future deals.Also Read: San Francisco Giants Jump Ahead Of $8.2B New York Yankees In Rising Race For Tatsuya Imai","Toronto blue jays signed starting pitcher dylan cease to a seven-year, two hundred and ten million dollar deal this week.

Inside India nets in Ranchi: How Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma prepared for first ODI vs South Africa

Former India skipper Rohit Sharma ’s fluent half-century came to an abrupt end on Sunday after a brief mid-pitch consultation with Virat Kohli led to the opener deciding against reviewing an LBW decision, a call that left fans buzzing across social media during the first ODI against South Africa.The moment unfolded in the 22nd over of the Indian innings.Marco Jansen went short of a length, the ball stayed lower than expected and struck Rohit around the back thigh as he swivelled into a pull shot.The Proteas went up immediately, the umpire raised the finger, and Rohit paused, turning to non-striker Kohli for a quick word.After a few seconds of discussion, the two agreed there was no need for DRS.Rohit began the walk back, ending what had been a composed, commanding outing. Replays later suggested the delivery would have clipped the top of the stumps at worst, validating the decision to move on.Rohit departed for 57 off 50 balls, hitting five fours and three sixes, and in the process rewriting ODI history.Earlier in his innings, the 38-year-old had sent two clean hits sailing over deep midwicket off spinner Prenelan Subrayen to draw level with Shahid Afridi’s tally of 351 sixes, the previous record for most in One-Day Internationals.Moments later, a towering pull off Jansen over deep square leg carried him past the former Pakistan star.With 352 ODI sixes, Rohit is now the most prolific six-hitter the format has ever seen, achieving the feat in just 270 innings, far quicker than Afridi’s 398-match career.He also brought up his 60th ODI half-century before his exit, extending a legacy built since his debut in 2007.","Rohit sharma's fluent half-century came to an abrupt end after a brief mid-pitch consultation with virat kohli led to the opener deciding against reviewing an lbw decision.

Leon Draisaitl and Connor McDavid still carry the Oilers’ offense

Leon Draisaitl made news when he gave a short and cold answer to people talking about the Edmonton Oilers’ leadership. A podcast online said the team’s top players, like Leon Draisaitl and captain Connor McDavid, were not showing enough strong direction when the team struggled. The video spread fast, and many fans talked about it. When Leon Draisaitl saw the clip, he replied with just one word: “Lol.” His reply was simple, but it got a lot of likes and showed he did not agree with the talk about weak leadership.The podcast hosts said the team’s main leaders should be the ones pulling everyone together during tough nights. They felt the Edmonton Oilers still leaned too much on older veteran players for guidance. They also said Draisaitl and McDavid are now older and should not need as much help. This started a big discussion because both players have already led the Oilers to long playoff runs.The Oilers reached the Stanley Cup Final in both 2024 and 2025. Connor McDavid played a huge role and won major awards. Leon Draisaitl also had strong numbers and scored many big points. They were the two players who pushed the team forward each year.Because of this, some fans feel the criticism is unfair, while others think it is needed for the team to grow.But even with their talent, this season has not been smooth. The Oilers have been up and down. They have wins and losses that keep them in the middle. Their offense still shines because of Connor McDavid and Leon Draisaitl, who both continue to score and make plays. But the team’s biggest problem is still on defense. They give up too many goals, and the goalies face too much pressure each night. This hurts their chances to move up in the standings.Connor McDavid has many points this season and still drives the attack every game. Leon Draisaitl also has strong numbers and helps the team stay in games. Their power play is strong, and they create many chances. But offense alone cannot fix everything. The team needs better defense and better support if they want to reach the Stanley Cup Final again.Leon Draisaitl’s “Lol” reply showed he is not worried about outside noise.

Travis Kelce sent a resounding message on Browns rookie Shedeur Sanders



Cleveland finally felt a long awaited spark when Shedeur Sanders stepped onto the field for his first NFL start. The Browns needed someone to steady an offense that had been stuck for most of the season, and Sanders delivered a performance that shifted the mood in the city. His debut not only brought a win but also caught the attention of two of Cleveland’s most accomplished sons, Jason and Travis Kelce . Their excitement set the tone for a conversation that echoed across the league.Travis Kelce did not hide how thrilled he was. He sent a strong message to Sanders on the latest episode of New Heights, praising the rookie with all the energy fans expect from him. “Talk your sh**, Shedeur, let’s f**ing go. My dog goes in, gets his first start, gets his first dub. Let’s f*cking go, man. The 45th starting QB for the Browns since 1994. First Browns QB to win in his first official start since 1995. Cleveland’s been waiting for this. We’ve been waiting for this,” Travis said.For Travis, this moment carried extra meaning. He grew up in Cleveland, starred at the University of Cincinnati and has always kept a place in his heart for the Browns. Seeing Sanders command the offense and lead a 24 to 10 victory over the Raiders reminded him of what the city has been longing for. Jason Kelce agreed, saying Sanders brought something that had been missing. “In one game, Shedeur showed them more than they had seen, really, in any of the games with Gabriel,” he said.Jason noted that Sanders was not perfect, but his poise and timely throws stood out.Sanders went 11 for 20 for 209 yards with one touchdown and one interception. His best throw came on a play where Las Vegas brought heavy pressure. Instead of folding, he rolled right and sent a 52 yard strike to Isaiah Bond. His touchdown came later when rookie Dylan Sampson turned a screen into a 66 yard score. It was the type of play Cleveland had been desperate to see.A week earlier, Sanders struggled in relief duty. He entered cold and completed only four passes against Baltimore. This time he had preparation, rhythm and confidence. Now he faces a much tougher test when the Browns meet the 49ers. With the Kelce brothers and the city behind him, Sanders steps into Week 13 with belief and momentum on his side.Also Read: Meet Taylor Burr, the Chiefs’ breakout sideline personality who’s living her dream and charming viewers nationwide",Shedeur sanders made his debut for the browns against the raiders.

You can call it point guard or whatever, but he ran the offense for us. He drove the ball. The ball touched the paint. He got to the rim, got to the free throw line, stepped up and made free throws for us late. Just his composure on both ends [was impressive]. He competes at a very high level. You saw that tonight, but you saw that last night, too. ""Flagg had struggled in the second game of past back-to-backs, but this time he started strong with 12 points in the first quarter and 21 by halftime.

What Hailey Sikman and Jade Dickens said about Jammie Booker at the Texas event



Jammie Booker, 28, lost her World’s Strongest Woman title after officials said she is a biological male and also after explicit photos spread during the event. This happened at the 2025 contest in Arlington, Texas, last weekend. On Tuesday, the Official Strongman Games said they removed her win because they only allow people to compete in the category of the sex marked at birth. This pushed Andrea Thompson , 43, from Great Britain, into first place.Rivals told the Daily Mail and Fox News Digital that they only learned about Booker’s gender after the event. They said the photos and videos were sent to them later. One photo showed Booker grabbing her chest and sticking out her tongue. The Daily Mail also said competitors shared adult pictures and videos that seemed to show Booker had worked in porn. Because of this, the event became a huge controversy.Strongwomen Hailey Sikman and Jade Dickens said they felt “conned” because they did not know anything about Jammie Booker’s gender before the contest ended. Jade Dickens told Fox News Digital that she was “beyond mad.” She said, “Nobody knew he was a man.”She also said Booker was quiet, and she believed Booker’s voice might have revealed the truth.Hailey Sikman said she tried to talk to Booker during the event, but Booker did not respond. Sikman said many women felt Jammie Booker was “arrogant” and “talking s***.” They believed she kept a distance from other athletes.On Tuesday, the Official Strongman Games shared a strong statement. They said, “It appears that an athlete who is biologically male and who now identifies as female competed in the Women’s Open category.” They also said they tried to contact Booker but did not get a reply.The Daily Mail looked into claims that Booker worked in adult entertainment. Their report said Booker looks like a porn performer named Jammie Jay, and Booker also uses the TikTok name @jammiejaysvids. The IAFD (Internet Adult Film Database) shows that “Jammie Jay” was nominated at the Trans Erotica Awards in 2020 and 2022. The site also lists several adult movie titles under that name.The Daily Mail reached out to Booker and her coach but got no response. They also contacted the Official Strongman Games to ask if these photos and videos were part of the decision to remove the title.In a 2017 YouTube video, Jammie Booker said she was a “21-year-old trans woman” with a hard past and strict parents. In a July podcast with champion strongwoman Erin Murray, Booker talked about having three partners and said she uses Google Calendar to plan time with each one.She said she trains early in the morning and keeps her schedule tight so she can balance work, partners, and strongwoman training.Also Read: Why Did A Biological Male Win The World’s Strongest Woman?

How will Marcus Foligno’s injury affect Minnesota’s Wild lineup?

Marcus Foligno (#17) All 23 Goals of the 2021-22 NHL Season

The veteran winger Marcus Foligno has been placed on injured reserve by the Minnesota Wild effective November 26, after he picked up a lower-body injury in the course of the game against the Chicago Blackhawks, which went into overtime on Wednesday night. Foligno was involved in a collision with Oliver Moore and had to leave the match late in the second period, and the Wild has since called up Nicolas Aubé-Kubel from their AHL affiliate in Iowa to take his place on the roster. Minnesota is currently without five forwards, including Ryan Hartman, Vinnie Hinostroza, Marco Rossi, and Vladimir Tarasenko, while they have approximately $3.43 million in cap space.Foligno will be out for the next three games at least and can only return as early as December 4 against the Calgary Flames. This winger, who is 34 years old, has not been very productive offensively in recent times, getting only two assists in 23 games, and his average ice time of 13:07 is the lowest in the last seven years. Nevertheless, he still plays a vital defensive role, and numbers like expected goals against per 60 minutes (2.63) and scoring chances against per 60 (28.29) show that he is worth having in his own zone.The Wild have to deal with the problem of performing up to standard while the crucial forwards are out of the lineup.The head coach, John Hynes, has not given any specific time frame for Marcus Foligno’s full recovery, so Minnesota has to cope with using its depth players, together with recalled Aubé-Kubel, to keep its lineup alive.Foligno's IR placement is very timely as the team is poised to extend its winning streak to six and fortify its Central Division position. The Wild will have to make extensive ice time adjustments, change line combinations, and rethink deployment strategies to remain competitive during his absence.Foligno's injury puts additional strain on the Minnesota forwards; however, good roster management and the help from the fit players are going to be the key factors in getting through the upcoming fixtures.Also Read: NHL Updates: Montreal Canadiens re-sign defenseman Mike Matheson to a long-term extension","Marcus foligno has been placed on injured reserve by the minnesota wild.

Tip-off is set for 7:30 PM ET, and for the first time in a while, Charlotte’s star point guard walks into a matchup without an injury tag shadowing him. His clean bill of health is reassuring for a fanbase that has watched him battle ankle concerns all season.Charlotte is desperate for stability, especially with their record slipping further below .500. Having Ball at the helm offers something this team has lacked in recent weeks: direction. And considering the Bulls are arriving with a battered roster and numerous rotational uncertainties, the Hornets know this is a prime opportunity to regain momentum. With Black Friday bringing a national spotlight to the tournament slate, the timing couldn’t be better.LaMelo Ball enters tonight’s contest after logging 27 minutes in Wednesday’s outing against the Knicks, where he posted 11 points, six rebounds, and four assists. Despite a rough 4-for-14 shooting night, his presence alone boosted Charlotte’s tempo and spacing. Even as whispers of ongoing ankle management persist, the official injury report listed him as fully available.That clarity allows the Hornets to lean on his signature dynamism - no-look passes, deep-range orchestration, and paint manipulation.This comes after a turbulent stretch in which Ball missed significant time due to a right ankle impingement. His return has been gradual, but the recent uptick in minutes shows that the team is confident in his durability. With Brandon Miller also cleared, Charlotte’s offensive engine finally resembles what it was designed to be earlier this season. Still, Hornets fans understand how quickly fortunes can shift if Ball tweaks the ankle again.Chicago enters Spectrum Center in disarray. The Bulls are dealing with an injury avalanche headlined by Zach Collins, who remains out with a left scaphoid fracture, and Isaac Okoro, listed as doubtful due to lumbar radiculopathy. Several others are questionable: Nikola Vucevic (knee), Coby White (calf/injury management), Patrick Williams (wrist), Kevin Huerter (pelvic contusion), and Dalen Terry (calf).

Belgium clinched their first-ever Sultan Azlan Shah Cup title after outlasting India 1-0 in a gripping, tactical final in Ipoh on Sunday. Thibeau Stockbroekx scored the decisive goal in the 34th minute, handing the European giants their maiden crown in just their second appearance in the prestigious tournament.India, fresh off a commanding 14-3 demolition of Canada in their previous outing, entered the final with confidence — but Belgium’s discipline, structure and defensive steel proved too difficult to breach. India’s three penalty corners, usually a strength for drag-flickers Jugraj Singh, Amit Rohidas and Sanjay, went unused against a compact Belgian defensive wall.This was India’s second loss to Belgium in the tournament, after a narrow 2-3 defeat in the league stage.The final began with Belgium asserting early control through superior ball possession and sharp attacks down the flanks, forcing Indian goalkeeper Suraj Karkera into a couple of strong saves. With senior players Manpreet Singh and Hardik Singh rested for the tournament, India’s younger midfield worked hard to maintain parity in intense central battles.Although Belgium earned two early penalty corners, India defended well to keep the scoreline level. The match remained goalless at half-time, but the momentum swung decisively Belgium’s way in the third quarter. Stockbroekx’s strike — off a well-constructed move — pushed India on the back foot and increased the pressure.India responded by pressing higher and increasing circle entries, but Belgium’s organised defence held firm. The final quarter saw the Indians push desperately for an equaliser, but the Belgian structure absorbed wave after wave of attack, smartly running down the clock to seal the championship.For India, the silver medal marks a promising tournament featuring some bright performances from the next generation.",Belgium beat india 1-0 in the sultan azlan shah cup final.
