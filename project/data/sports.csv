Carlos Alcaraz completed his post-match TV interviews after defeating Novak Djokovic 6-4, 7-6 (4), 6-2 in the U.S. Open semifinals on Friday.Before beginning the interviews, Alcaraz paused to check his phone for updates on Jannik Sinner's semifinal match against Felix Auger-Aliassime, which was still in its first set.Sinner later secured his place in the final with a 6-1, 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 victory over Auger-Aliassime. This set up a historic US Open final between No. 1 Sinner and No. 2 Alcaraz, marking the first time two players will face each other in three consecutive Grand Slam finals in one season.""These two players are the best in the world right now,"" said Djokovic, a 24-time major champion.The duo has dominated men's tennis, splitting the past eight major trophies and claiming 10 of the past 13. Alcaraz currently holds five Slam titles, while Sinner has four.The upcoming final will also determine the No. 1 ranking, with President Donald Trump expected to attend.The rivalry between Alcaraz and Sinner has intensified throughout the year, with Alcaraz winning at the French Open in June and Sinner prevailing at Wimbledon in July.Sinner aims to become the first repeat men's champion in New York since Roger Federer's five consecutive victories from 2004 to 2008. He has reached five straight Grand Slam finals since his US Open appearance last year.Alcaraz has maintained a perfect record without dropping a set as he pursues his sixth major title and second at Flushing Meadows.Since April, Alcaraz has dominated with a 44-2 record, reaching finals in his last eight tour-level events.""It's something that I'm working on, just the consistency on the matches, on the tournaments, on the year, in general. Just not having up-and-downs in (a) match. Probably, I'm just getting mature, just getting to know myself much better, what I need on, off the court,"" the Spaniard said.Sinner's record against Alcaraz in 2024 stands at 1-6, while maintaining an impressive 109-4 record against all other opponents.""We have played quite a lot this year. So we know each other very well,"" Sinner said.Alcaraz had previously lost to Djokovic in their last two encounters - the Paris Olympics gold-medal final and the Australian Open quarterfinals. ""It's not easy playing against him, to be honest. I'm thinking about the legend; what he has achieved in his career. It's difficult not to think about it,"" Alcaraz added.Djokovic, at 38, showed signs of fatigue by the match's end. He reached semifinals in all four Slams this season but was eliminated each time, with three losses to either Alcaraz or Sinner.""It's frustrating on the court when you are not able to keep up with that level physically, but at the same time, it's something also expected, I guess. It comes with time and with age,"" the veteran admitted.""I still want to play ... (a) full Grand Slam season next year. Let's see whether that's going to happen or not, but ... Slams are Slams. They are just different from any other tournament. They are the pillars of our sport, the most important tournaments we have. But I do fancy my chances a bit more in best-of-three.""Despite leading 3-0 in the second set, Djokovic couldn't maintain his advantage against Alcaraz.""Today, I'd say, it wasn't the best level of the tournament for me, but I just kept a cool level (from) the beginning until the last point,"" he explained.Alcaraz appeared in a pink sleeveless shirt, sporting regrown hair after a recent buzz cut necessitated by his brother's failed attempt at being a barber.When asked about maintaining his new look if victorious on Sunday, Alcaraz responded: ""Even better. You will see. ... Surprise, surprise.""","Carlos alcaraz defeated novak djokovic 6-4, 7-6 (4), 6-2 in the u.s. open semifinals on friday.

Aryna Sabalenka has been open about navigating personal tragedy while continuing to dominate the tennis world. Following the sudden passing of her ex-boyfriend, Konstantin Koltsov, in March 2024, the Belarusian star found support in a new relationship with Brazilian entrepreneur Georgios Frangulis. The two went public in spring 2024, and since then, he has become a familiar face courtside, cheering her on at major tournaments.Aryna Sabalenka admitted that her new relationship came during an incredibly difficult chapter in her life. She credited Georgios Frangulis with helping her focus on joy beyond the pressures of tennis.“There was a really tough period where I was really happy to have him by my side, always cheering me up, always making sure that we are doing some fun stuff,” Sabalenka told People. “But I make sure I kind of forget about tennis and focus on the good things and enjoy my life. Even when things are going wrong in my career. So yeah, he was my biggest support and yeah, really happy to have him by my side.”Their relationship became public when they were first pictured together in April 2024. Since then, Frangulis has been spotted regularly in her player’s box, including at her title run at the 2024 US Open.Born and raised in São Paulo, Brazil, to a Greek family originally from Thessaloniki, Frangulis pursued law at Fundação Armando Alvares Penteado but never became a lawyer. His passion was always in entrepreneurship. After graduating in 2014, he moved to the United States, first living in Miami and later in California.A spiritual person, Frangulis has spoken about how faith shaped his outlook. “I go to church a lot, talking to God does me good. I was influenced by both branches of the family. The spiritual side has always been important to me – as well as intuition,” he told Forbes Brazil.In 2016, Frangulis founded Oakberry, an açaí-based brand that has since expanded worldwide. Known for its bowls and smoothies, Oakberry now has hundreds of locations across more than 40 countries. By January 2024, Sabalenka herself became an ambassador for the brand, later launching her own signature bowl.“Most of the time I go for Oakberry bowl; I think it's healthy and a good thing to start your day,” Sabalenka said in an interview. “It has everything you [want]: protein, carbs, vitamins, fruit. It's like an energy bowl, so I feel ready to go after I have it.”Beyond business, Frangulis balances his entrepreneurial career with his passion for motorsports. He has raced in Porsche GT3 Cup Challenge events and the Porsche Mobil 1 Supercup, finding in racing both adrenaline and escape.Georgios Frangulis has a visible presence in Aryna Sabalenka’s careerWhile Oakberry has sponsored tennis tournaments before, Frangulis admitted the experience of sitting in Sabalenka’s box is far more intense. “The toughest part is being in the box. It’s one of the most stressful situations I’ve ever experienced,” he said.“I never say anything during matches. I try not to show too much emotion, because Aryna notices everything – what everyone is doing in the box. I just clap as loudly as I can and make sure she feels supported.”Also Read: Who is Naomi Osaka’s husband?

NEW DELHI: At a Grand Slam where fashion goes hand-in-hand with tennis, it was Aryna Sabalenka who had the last laugh at Flushing Meadows. More than that, she created a lasting impression on and off the court while it rained outside the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in Queens, New York.On the court, she beat Amanda Anisimova 6-3, 7-6 (3) to successfully defend her US Open title. In the process, she pocketed her fourth Grand Slam title and 100th victory at majors.And at the trophy ceremony, the fashion supremacy kicked in as the Belarusian wore a metallic silver jacket, matching perfectly with the silver of the trophy she had received from 18-time major champion Chris Evert Sabalenka has four now, in comparison, including two at the US Open, winning back-to-back titles. No one had won two in a row at Flushing Meadows since Serena Williams in 2013-14. Before the tournament began, she was asked about this long run.""Wow, that's insane, you know, how unpredictable women's tennis is, right? Should we change it? Should we try at least to change it?"" said the 27-year-old, before adding, ""My thought is to change that.""And she changed that successfully on Saturday evening with the roof closed over Arthur Ashe Stadium.Despite what the scoreline suggests, it wasn't all smooth sailing as she would have liked. Sabalenka, who likes to express her feelings on court, and lets her box know in the process, started slowly as Anisimova forced her into the corner.And that is one position Sabalenka doesn't enjoy. She was shoved into that place during the French Open final loss to Coco Gauff, acknowledging how stressed she got against the American in Paris.This time, too, she was broken at 3-2 in the opening set and smacked the ball away in frustration.Instead, she won the next four games, as Anisimova's risk-reward game of winners to unforced errors tipped towards 13-15. Sabalenka converted all three of her break point chances, served better, returned better, kept the error rate down. In fact, she made three unforced errors in the first five games and made none in the next four.Then in the second set, the World No. 1 twice led by a break, served for the title at 5-4 and came within two points of closing it out. An overhead had her backpedalling, and the smash went flush into the middle of the net. Anisimova converted the break point, and the 24,000 fans were up on their feet.Was this going to be the breaking point for Sabalenka? And the turning point for New Jersey-born Anisimova? Not quite.About 15 minutes later, Sabalenka was on her knees, both her hands covering her face in jubilation, having just converted her third match point opportunity in the tiebreak.That her first major of the year, after two painful final losses to Americans, came in a tiebreak felt fitting. It extended her record to 21-1 in breakers this season, including 19 in a row, and underscored that the defeat to Gauff in Paris was a rare blip.“All those tough lessons (were) worth this one,” Sabalenka said. “I’m speechless right now.”“It’s been tough this year. In those finals, I was really terrible. But come on, it’s worth it, right? Thank you so much. I love you; you’re my family. Thank you to my boyfriend — without your support, I wouldn’t be able to make it,” she continued.As the silver jacket shimmered under the artificial Arthur Ashe lights, Sabalenka’s victory felt bigger than the previous three. It was the culmination of a season in which she turned lessons from painful defeats into fuel, and a reminder that women’s tennis, often accused of unpredictability, now has a figure who is setting the tone at the very top.Her brash energy on court, the roars, the clenched fist directed at her team are contrasts to the poise and flair she projects once the battle is over. Few athletes today blur the lines between raw emotion and refined spectacle quite like Sabalenka; and in New York, the stage rewards both.","Aryna sabalenka beat amanda anisimova 6-3, 7-6 (3) to successfully defend her us open title.

Amanda Anisimova experienced disappointment in her second Grand Slam final, losing to Aryna Sabalenka at the US Open on Saturday.The 24-year-old American, who was also runner-up at Wimbledon in July, lost 6-3, 7-6 (7/3) to the world number one and defending champion Sabalenka.Despite displaying powerful gameplay against Sabalenka, Anisimova struggled to maintain consistency against her Belarusian opponent.""Losing in two finals is great but it is also super hard. I didn't fight hard enough for my dreams today,"" said Anisimova.""I didn't win today, so of course I didn't do enough. That's just the reality, and I have to accept that. I feel like if I fought harder, then maybe I would have given myself more of a chance, but I feel like I was really kind of in the back seat today. I just felt like throughout the match I wasn't playing my best tennis.""Following her previous 6-0, 6-0 loss to Iga Swiatek at Wimbledon, Anisimova continues to work on managing her nerves during major tournaments.""I feel like with finals I have a lot of nerves, and it's something I'm trying to work on, but I just wish I played more aggressive,"" stated Anisimova. ""Of course, she (Sabalenka) was playing amazing. She was playing very aggressive and doing all the right things, so she made it very difficult for me today.""In the first set, Anisimova recovered from an early deficit to secure a 3-2 lead with two service breaks.The closed roof at Arthur Ashe Stadium, due to heavy rain, affected Anisimova's visibility, leading to Sabalenka winning the next four games and the set.""I haven't played on the court during the day with the roof closed, and it was literally, like, white, and I couldn't see the ball when I was serving,"" added Anisimova. ""That was a huge shock to my system. It was extremely frustrating for me.""The second set saw Anisimova constantly trailing, and despite breaking Sabalenka's serve while the top seed was serving for the match, she ultimately lost in the tiebreak.""Making it to the final is obviously really special, but it would have been a dream come true to make it all the way,"" said Anisimova. ""I hope I can keep working really hard to give myself more opportunities to be in more and more finals.""","Amanda anisimova lost 6-3, 7-6 (7/3) to aryna sabalenka in the us open final.

Deion Sanders’ advice for Travis Hunter as a new dad



Travis Hunter embraces fatherhood and NFL dreams



Travis Hunter is stepping into fatherhood and the NFL at the same time, and one man who has been by his side throughout this journey is Deion Sanders. The Hall of Famer, who once recruited Hunter to Jackson State and later coached him at Colorado, recently shared heartfelt fatherly advice for the Jacksonville Jaguars rookie as he embraces life’s two biggest milestones — becoming a professional athlete and a dad.For Deion Sanders, Travis Hunter has always been more than a player. Their bond goes back to 2021 when Hunter, then the No. 1 recruit in the nation, shocked everyone by committing to Jackson State instead of a powerhouse like Florida State. He later followed Sanders to Colorado, where he won the 2024 Heisman Trophy as a two-way sensation. Through it all, Sanders played a fatherly role, especially during Hunter’s toughest moments.On the night Hunter lifted the Heisman, his biological father was absent due to legal troubles. Sanders stepped in, embracing the young star in what became one of the most emotional moments of Hunter’s career. Years later, when Sanders was quietly battling a bladder cancer scare and couldn’t attend Hunter’s wedding, the rookie showed up at his coach’s Texas ranch, standing by him as the two shared quiet moments fishing together.“Oh my god, I’m taking a deep breath because I love him to life — I love him like he’s my son,” Sanders said. “It’s funny when your son is now a father… it’s a beautiful thing.“The thing that I told him is let’s correct all the things that we think we didn’t receive as children and let’s do that in our fatherhood. No matter what happens, let’s make sure we are the best darn father that ever walked. That’s what I told him. I’m proud of him, I love him to life, and I miss him dearly.”It wasn’t coach-speak. It was a father figure speaking to someone he considers family. And Hunter will also be happy to get some off-field advice from Coach Prime.Travis Hunter, just 22, is now a husband and a father. He and his longtime girlfriend, Leanna Lenee, tied the knot earlier this year before welcoming their first child, a baby boy. In a heartfelt video titled “Dear Son…”, Hunter can be heard saying to his newborn, “Gotta be better than me.”The timing couldn’t be more symbolic. On September 7, Hunter will make his NFL debut when the Jaguars face the Carolina Panthers. It marks the start of two parallel journeys: one on the field as a top draft pick, and one at home as a father. With Sanders’ wisdom and his own determination, Hunter now carries two legacies — as a rising NFL star and as a dad committed to doing things right. Fans and critics will be watching Travis Hunter how he make his debut a dreamy one. he is ready to show what he is capable of and to prove that he is indeed a two-way player and rare.Also Read: Justin Jefferson injury update: Vikings may take cautious approach as hamstring issue raises long-term concerns","Deion sanders gives travis hunter fatherhood guidance.

Wayne Gretzky and the Canadian identity crisis: why the Great One no longer defines hockey,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/wayne-gretzky-and-the-canadian-identity-crisis-why-the-great-one-no-longer-defines-hockey/amp_articleshow/123677192.cms,"Tired of too many ads? go ad free now

Hockey’s cultural landscape has moved beyond one man’s legacy

The Canadian identity crisis goes deeper than Wayne Gretzky’s shadow

Tired of too many ads? go ad free now

For decades, Wayne Gretzky stood as the ultimate symbol of Canadian hockey pride. His dazzling play and unmatched records gave Canada a face in the global sports arena, and his legacy still commands respect. Yet as the game evolves, a cultural shift is forcing Canadians to reconsider whether Gretzky still embodies the sport’s identity.When Gretzky aka The Great One retired, many believed his status as “The Great One” would eternally tie him to Canada’s hockey soul. But today’s NHL reflects a broader, more global identity. Stars like Connor McDavid , Auston Matthews, and Sidney Crosby have taken the torch, while international icons from Sweden, Russia, and the United States increasingly shape the league.Canada’s hockey culture is no longer built solely on a single national figurehead. Instead, it reflects diversity, new styles of play, and a growing international influence. Gretzky’s records still hold weight, but younger generations see him as a legend of the past, not the face of today’s game.The debate isn’t about Gretzky’s greatness, it’s about what he represents. Canada once relied on him to symbolize dominance and unity in hockey. But as the sport evolves, Canadians are confronting uncomfortable questions about their place in a game they no longer exclusively own.Hockey’s growth in non-traditional markets, combined with Canada’s struggles to consistently dominate on the world stage, has fueled this identity crisis. While Gretzky remains the most iconic name in hockey history, he no longer reflects the modern state of the sport or Canada’s role within it.Also read: Wayne Gretzky's daughter Paulina Gretzky turns head in bold gothic look during Italian getaway with Dustin Johnson In the end, Gretzky’s influence will never disappear, but Canada’s hockey identity now extends beyond his shadow. For the sport to thrive, Canadians must embrace a future where their cultural connection to hockey isn’t defined by just one man, no matter how great he was.After his retirement in 1999, Gretzky was immediately inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame, making him the most recent player to have the waiting period waived. The NHL retired his jersey number 99 league-wide. Gretzky was one of six players voted to the International Ice Hockey Federation's (IIHF) Centennial All-Star Team. He was inducted into the IIHF Hall of Fame in 2000, and received the Order of Hockey in Canada in 2012.","The canadian identity crisis goes deeper than wayne gretzky’s shadow.

Medical expert breaks down what a shoulder dislocation could mean for Xavier Worthy



“Best-case scenario, Worthy could be back in about three weeks,”





Fans react with panic, humor, and everything in between



Kansas City Chiefs fans are on edge after reports surfaced about Xavier Worthy potentially suffering a shoulder dislocation. With the season still in its early stages, losing a key wideout could be a major blow. And with many experts weighing in on the situation, the stakes feel even higher. Fans are now debating whether Worthy will be back in a few weeks or if this injury could derail his season entirely.A sports medicine specialist gave a stark assessment of the situation.he said, but he added a cautionary note: there’s a very high around 50% chance of re-injury even after recovery. The worst-case scenario, according to him, would be surgery, which could end Worthy’s season before it even properly starts. This kind of prognosis immediately sent shockwaves through Chiefs fans, who rely on Worthy’s explosiveness and playmaking ability.Xavier Worthy has been a key piece of the Chiefs’ offensive arsenal, and his potential absence forces head coach Andy Reid and quarterback Patrick Mahomes to rethink their approach.Without Worthy stretching the field, defenses could focus more on other receivers, putting extra pressure on Mahomes. Rookie and secondary receivers might need to step up, and any chemistry Mahomes has been building with Worthy would take time to rebuild. Chiefs fans are already debating who could take on a larger role in his absence, with names like Skyy Moore and Mecole Hardman frequently coming up.The news didn’t take long to trend on social media.Some fans reacted with genuine concern.Others tried to keep the mood light, joking.A few optimistic voices argued that three weeks is manageable and that Worthy would return stronger.Overall, the mix of worry and humor shows just how much fans care about their star wideout.Chiefs Nation is now in a holding pattern, hoping for the best but preparing for the worst. Whether Worthy bounces back quickly or faces a longer recovery, his health will be crucial for Kansas City’s early-season success. Fans will be watching every update closely, ready to react the moment news drops.Also read - Ryan Clark could be on thin ice at ESPN after heated on-air feud with Peter Schrager","Kansas city chiefs fans are on edge after reports about xavier worthy's shoulder dislocation.

Ken Dryden’s death at 78 leaves behind a legacy that defined the Canadiens and game of hockey





Ken Dryden’s life after Hockey: From Broadcasting icon to acclaimed Author and influential Leader

Ken Dryden, the legendary goaltender who defined an era for the Montreal Canadiens, has passed away at the age of 78 after a battle with cancer. A Hall of Fame icon, Dryden backstopped the Canadiens to six Stanley Cup championships during the 1970s, etching his name into hockey history as one of the greatest to ever play the position.Ken Dryden’s journey to stardom began in Hamilton, Ontario, before his standout years at Cornell University, where he led the Big Red to an NCAA championship in 1967. His leap to the NHL in 1970 signaled the start of a dynasty, as he delivered Montreal the Stanley Cup in his rookie season and quickly became the face of consistency and dominance in goal.Over eight seasons, Dryden posted remarkable success, guiding the Canadiens to six championships and securing five Vezina Trophies along the way. His calm, imposing presence between the pipes set him apart from his peers, while his ability to rise in high-pressure moments made him a cornerstone of the Canadiens’ dominance throughout the decade.Dryden’s career, though brief, left an indelible mark. Retiring in his early 30s, he shocked the hockey world by stepping away while still at the peak of his powers. Yet his decision only added to his mystique and reinforced the idea that his legacy was about more than just statistics.Internationally, Dryden played a pivotal role in Canada’s legendary 1972 “Summit Series” victory over the Soviet Union, demonstrating his skill and poise on hockey’s grandest stage. After retiring from professional play, he transitioned seamlessly into broadcasting, politics, and writing. He served as the color commentator alongside Al Michaels for the 1980 “Miracle on Ice,” when the U.S. upset the Soviets to win Olympic gold. As an author, Dryden first recounted the 1972 series in “Face-Off at the Summit” and later wrote “The Game”, widely regarded as one of the most insightful and celebrated books in hockey history.Montreal Canadiens owner Geoff Molson called Dryden “larger than life,” a sentiment shared across the hockey world. Fans remember him not just for championships but for his intelligence, leadership, and ability to represent the sport with class.Also Read: Kirill Kaprizov could become NHL’s most expensive player ever—Here’s why Ken Dryden was more than a goaltender—he was a symbol of Canadian hockey excellence and a voice that shaped the game long after his playing days ended.

22 goals and 6 assists in 36 matches in Ligue 1



Golden Boot winner in Ligue 1 (21 league goals), joint with PSG’s Ousmane Dembélé



Instrumental in securing Marseille’s return to the Champions League

With just days left before the Saudi Pro League transfer window shuts on September 23, Cristiano Ronaldo is personally driving Al-Nassr’s efforts to land Marseille’s in-form forward Mason Greenwood. The move, if it materialises, could define Al-Nassr’s silverware ambitions this season, and possibly reshape Greenwood’s career trajectory yet again.Cristiano Ronaldo, now 40, may be in the twilight of his career, but he's showing no signs of slowing down — either on the pitch or in the boardroom. After extending his contract with Al-Nassr for another two years, committing to the club past his 42nd birthday, Ronaldo has turned his focus to one objective: winning trophies in Saudi Arabia, something that has eluded him since his arrival.His influence already proved decisive in bringing Portuguese teammate João Félix to Al-Nassr this summer in a deal worth up to £43.7 million. Now, he wants another familiar name by his side, Mason Greenwood, the 23-year-old former Manchester United prodigy, now thriving at Olympique de Marseille.According toand other reports, Ronaldo is actively pushing for Al-Nassr to sign Greenwood before the Saudi transfer window slams shut on September 23.European windows are closed, but Saudi clubs remain in the hunt, and Greenwood’s name has shot to the top of Al-Nassr’s wish list.This would mark a dramatic shift for Greenwood, who reportedly turned down Saudi approaches in 2024. But with Ronaldo now fronting the effort, the tide may be turning.Mason Greenwood’s talent has never been in doubt, only his trajectory. A product of Manchester United’s academy, Greenwood joined the club at the age of six and rose rapidly through the ranks, making his senior debut on 6 March 2019 at 17 years and 156 days, becoming United’s youngest-ever Champions League player in a historic win over Paris Saint-Germain.he burst onto the scene with both feet (literally, known for being ambipedal), scoring 35 goals across all competitions for United before his controversial exit.But in January 2022, Greenwood was arrested following allegations connected to material that had been published online. The charges — which included attempted rape and assault — were formally dropped on 2 February 2023. Despite the legal case not proceeding, Greenwood remained suspended by Manchester United throughout the process. After conducting an internal review, the club ultimately decided he would not return to the first-team setup.Following a loan to Getafe, Greenwood returned to Manchester in the summer of 2024, where he was informed by the coaching staff that he would be sold. That led to a fresh start at Olympique de Marseille, who signed him in July 2024. It was here that Greenwood began to rebuild, not just form, but reputation. His first season was emphatic:Now 23, Greenwood has once again emerged as one of the most sought-after young forwards, not just in Europe but also across the growing football frontier of the Middle East. His Marseille form even sparked brief speculation about a return to the England national team, despite his decision this summer to decline a call-up from Jamaica.That invitation came as part of Jamaica’s World Cup qualifying campaign, led by head coach and former Manchester United assistant Steve McClaren, who briefly overlapped with Greenwood at Old Trafford. Although Greenwood had obtained a Jamaican passport and was expected to join the squad, he ultimately opted out after discussions with his family, choosing instead to prioritise his club career and defer any international commitment for now.Ronaldo’s push for Greenwood isn’t about nostalgia, it’s based on first-hand experience. The pair were previously teammates at Manchester United during the 2021/22 campaign, featuring together in 17 matches across the Premier League and Champions League. Ronaldo saw Greenwood’s potential up close in that stretch: a technically gifted, ambidextrous forward with a natural instinct for goal.That impression has clearly stuck. Greenwood, now 23, represents the kind of profile Al-Nassr have struggled to attract, a clinical finisher with top-tier European pedigree, still in his prime, and hungry to re-establish himself at the top level. Crucially, he also comes with the ability to slot into a fluid frontline. Paired with João Félix, Greenwood could inject a sharper, more unpredictable dynamic into Al-Nassr’s attack, precisely what Ronaldo envisions as the club pushes to end its silverware drought.Frustrations have been mounting at Al-Nassr. Recent shortcomings in both the Saudi Pro League and AFC Champions League have left Ronaldo discontent. And despite winning the Golden Boot in back-to-back years, the Portugal international is yet to win the Saudi Pro League, as Al Nassr finished third in 2024/25 – 13 points behind winners Al Ittihad. His decision to renew his contract until 2027 wasn’t just about extending his career, it was a commitment to winning. And that commitment demands players who can hit the ground running. Greenwood fits that bill.The Saudi Pro League has not taken its foot off the gas. While European clubs are done for the summer, Saudi sides continue to recruit aggressively until September 23.Al-Nassr aren’t alone in scouting big names. Across the league:Elsewhere in the region, Qatar Sports Club is close to finalising a deal for PSG defender Presnel Kimpembe, with that window open until September 16.In this hyper-competitive environment, Ronaldo’s role as recruiter-in-chief is shaping Al-Nassr’s push to outpace domestic rivals. Greenwood is not just another marquee signing, he is a tactical and psychological play, a signal that Al-Nassr, with Ronaldo at the helm, intend to finish what they started.",Mason greenwood has scored 23 goals in 39 appearances for marseille this season.

Fans Roast Travis Kelce After Brutal Collision With Xavier Worthy

Xavier Worthy’s current status after leaving the opener



The Chiefs’ season opener against the Chargers was supposed to be all about Patrick Mahomes’ passing fireworks and Kansas City’s attempt to launch another Super Bowl run. Instead, the storyline took a bizarre turn when Travis Kelce , the face of the franchise, accidentally knocked out his own rookie receiver, Xavier Worthy, just minutes into the game. Worthy’s shoulder injury forced him out early, but the internet made sure the hit kept trending long after kickoff.On the Chiefs’ third offensive play of the night, Kelce and Worthy ran crossing routes but ended up colliding with each other instead of confusing the defense. Kelce’s 250-pound frame slammed directly into the 170-pound rookie, sending Worthy crumpling to the turf in obvious pain.He walked off holding his shoulder, was taken to the locker room shortly after, and officially ruled out in the second quarter. What made the moment sting even more for Chiefs Kingdom is the timing, Kansas City is already thin at wide receiver, with Rashee Rice suspended and fellow rookie Jalen Royals sidelined. Losing Worthy early looked like the nightmare start nobody saw coming.If Chiefs fans were panicked, NFL Twitter was on fire with a mix of jokes, anger, and conspiracy takes. Some fans framed the whole thing as Kelce’s “revenge season,” with one viral post reading:Others mocked the play like it deserved a flag:A few even speculated the shoulder might be dislocated, while one bettor couldn’t help but laugh:Of course, the Swiftie crossover was inevitable. One fan joked Worthy just lost his invite to the, while another imagined him trolling pre-game with,Whether it was painful or playful, the internet made sure the hit went viral.As of now, the Chiefs haven’t confirmed the severity of Worthy’s shoulder injury. He’s expected to undergo more testing, including an MRI, once the team returns from Brazil.

‘I loved hockey’: T.J. Watt admits childhood jealousy of his brothers shaped the retirement plan he still dreams about



T.J. Watt: Full Interview

Why the Pittsburgh Steelers paid $123 million: T.J. Watt continues to define the team’s defensive legacy



In July 2025, the Pittsburgh Steelers doubled down on their defensive cornerstone, signing T.J. Watt to a three-year, $123 million extension that made him the highest-paid non-quarterback in the NFL. It’s a staggering commitment to a player who has already delivered seven Pro Bowls, four All-Pro nods, and the 2021 Defensive Player of the Year award. Yet, even as Watt continues to terrify quarterbacks in Pittsburgh, life looks different now. At 30, a new father with wife Dani Rhodes, he admits that the thought of retirement has started to creep in, and with it, the return of a childhood dream.Growing up in Pewaukee, Wisconsin, all three Watt brothers laced up skates before ever wearing helmets and pads. T.J. began skating at just two years old, playing center until about age eleven. “I loved hockey. I really did,” T.J. Watt told Graham Bensinger during a 2025 sit-down interview. “I think beer league would be the most fun to do after I’m done playing.”The passion was real. “I finally made AAA and, like I said before, it was such a tough sport to have three boys in, especially at that age, because you’re at different levels and getting pulled in different directions,” Watt explained. While J.J. and Derek Watt pushed further into AAA hockey, J.J. even traveling to Germany with their father and grandfather, T.J. never got that chance. “I felt shorted in that aspect. I felt like I was pretty damn good at hockey, and obviously J.J.and Derek were really good too.”The memory still stings. While his brother packed for Europe, T.J. was forced to hand over a jersey he had just earned. That hunger for competition did not vanish. It simply shifted into football.If hockey left a void, the NFL filled it with dominance. Since being drafted in 2017, Watt has recorded 108 sacks, 33 forced fumbles, and even seven interceptions. He became Pittsburgh’s all-time sack leader by 2024 and, despite playing on a bad ankle last season, still produced 11.5 sacks and six forced fumbles. Steelers insider Mark Kaboly captured the expectations perfectly when he said, “He’s going to have 20 sacks this year.”For most defenders, those numbers would headline a career. For Watt, they are seen as a dip. That is why Pittsburgh’s massive extension is not just a payday. It is a belief that the storm inside him is far from over.Watt has made peace with the idea that one day, he will hang up the black and gold jersey. When that happens, it will not be the end of the competition. It will be the return to the ice he never stopped loving. Until then, Steelers fans at Acrisure Stadium can count on more chaos off the edge, and someday, maybe they will spot their legend skating in a beer-league rink, grinning under a different helmet.Also Read: T.J.
