More coverage on NFL:





The Kansas City Chiefs have spent the week preparing for one of their most pivotal games of the season, and naturally, the biggest question on fans’ minds is whether Travis Kelce will be on the field when they face the surging Denver Broncos. As the Broncos sit at an impressive 8-2 and continue to gain national attention, the Chiefs know they need every offensive weapon available, especially their All-Pro tight end.Kelce has been at the center of the conversation not only for what he brings physically, but for the leadership and urgency he expressed this week on New Heights. His comments offered rare insight into how seriously Kansas City is taking this matchup and what he believes it will require to win.Yes, Travis Kelce is expected to play today, with no injury setbacks reported during the week. He has practiced fully and appears locked in mentally, bringing a sense of urgency to a matchup that could shape the AFC West race.Kelce’s own breakdown of the Broncos makes his mindset clear. When Jason Kelce joked that Kansas City should “spot ‘em seven,” the tight end didn’t hesitate to shut it down. “That’s not how that works,” he said.“Nobody in their right mind is just like, ‘Let’s spot ’em seven.’ I think we’re going to try and start fast and finish even faster. I think that’s going to be the key to the game right there.”Travis Kelce’s assessment isn’t just talk. Denver has scored first in only one of their ten games, yet they dominate late, ranking third in the NFL with 96 fourth-quarter points. Their formula revolves around resilience, slow starts, strong finishes, and a defense that has kept them competitive even when their offense cools off.He also highlighted how complete the Broncos have become under Sean Payton, saying, “I think right now the Broncos are playing so well together… They’re playing great defense. And then in those big moments, their offense keeps finding ways to win football games.”With Kelce healthy, motivated, and fully aware of Denver’s strengths, the Chiefs will lean heavily on him today. And based on his tone, he plans to set that “fast start, faster finish” standard himself.",Kansas city chiefs star travis kelce is set to play against the denver broncos.

"NHL Injury Update: Charlie McAvoy out after a slapshot in the Montreal Canadiens, return timeline unclear",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/nhl-injury-update-charlie-mcavoy-out-after-a-slapshot-in-the-montreal-canadiens-return-timeline-unclear/articleshow/125366743.cms,"Charlie McAvoy (Image Via Twitter)

How serious is Charlie McAvoy’s injury, and when could he return?





Those who follow the sport of hockey closely are aware that the game situation can change rapidly, and the Boston Bruins' physical approach has been a great source of excitement in arenas all over North America for quite a long time. Players like Charlie McAvoy, not only due to their skills, but also the maximum effort and toughness they display throughout the game, become very recognizable when watching the NHL intensely. The fans of the Bruins and American hockey lovers in general are very much aware of McAvoy, the most important defender, whose being on the rink usually determines the outcome of the decisive games. The talk about the players in the team always involves McAvoy, thus making a single update about his fitness situation a matter of very high interest for not only the local supporters but also the international ones.The thrill turned into a tense moment at the Bell Centre in Montreal on Saturday. During the second period, Charlie McAvoy was hit in the face with a slapshot from Canadiens defenseman Noah Dobson. He collapsed at once, and the Bruins’ medical staff helped him off the ice. According to The Canadian Press, fellow player Nikita Zadorov was spotted trying to collect teeth that had fallen out during the incident. Bruins coach Marco Sturm said that McAvoy was being tested after the game, hoping he could travel safely with the team.Sportsnet's Elliotte Friedman later informed that McAvoy did fly back with the team, but his condition for the next game is still unclear.Charlie McAvoy was unable to play because of an upper-body injury. The management of the team declared him out before the third period, and now he is questionable for Monday’s matchup against the Carolina Hurricanes. The head athletic trainer of the Bruins, Dustin Stuck, escorted him off the ice and to Montreal's medical personnel. Players showed worries with David Pastrnak saying, “Praying for him that everything’s going to be fine. ” The previous shoulder injury McAvoy had during last season’s 4 Nations Face-Off adds to the caution surrounding his recovery. In case McAvoy is out, Henri Jokiharju is likely to be the one taking his place in the lineup. The fans, analysts, and U.S. Olympic supporters will be very dependent on the updates during the next few days, and even the league’s top defender being eligible to play will not be the same without the injury issue.The Charlie McAvoy injury has made it very hard for even the Bruins fans and the U.S. hockey supporters to breathe, and the situation perfectly illustrates the unpredictability of the sport. Still, it is not clear when the player will be back for the upcoming games, but the team will remain focused on his full recovery and on providing him a safe return to the ice. Boston and Team USA watching the world will be through McAvoy's resilience and skill, and the fans will be receiving their updates as the Bruins take on the rest of their season.More coverage on NHL","Charlie mcavoy was hit in the face with a slapshot from canadiens defenseman noah dobson.

Justin Tucker faces uncertain NFL return after serving suspension





More NFL coverage





Justin Tucker’s name is back in NFL conversations, but not because of a game-winning kick. The former Baltimore Ravens star has completed his 10-game suspension and is finally eligible to return. Now the league waits to see if any team is willing to sign him after months of headlines, allegations and intense scrutiny. His return window is open, yet his future remains uncertain as front offices weigh talent against controversy.Tucker, once viewed as one of the most reliable kickers in football, is now trying to rebuild his career at a time when several teams are desperate for stability. He has served his full punishment under the NFL’s personal conduct policy, and his reinstatement clears the path for a comeback. Whether that comeback actually happens will depend on who is willing to take the risk.Justin Tucker can return to the field if he signs with a team. His 10-game suspension for violating the NFL’s personal conduct policy is complete, and he is now free to join any roster. The Ravens released him in May after allegations of sexual misconduct surfaced. Sixteen Baltimore-area massage therapists accused him of inappropriate behavior between 2012 and 2016.As the claims spread, Tucker and his wife, Amanda, denied the accusations. He said, “It devastates me to know that anyone I have worked with would not have felt respected. To anyone who has felt otherwise, I am sorry.”The NFL launched its own investigation and suspended him in June. He served the suspension as a free agent, officially becoming eligible to return on Nov. 11. Despite the controversy, NFL Network reported earlier that he had interest from several teams.Tucker’s resume is still impressive. He is a seven-time Pro Bowler and five-time All-Pro with an 89.1 percent career accuracy rate, ranking him among the best kickers in league history. He also set the 66-yard field goal record in 2021 before it was topped this season. But his final year in Baltimore raised concerns. He hit just 73.3 percent of his attempts and went 6 of 11 from 50 yards or more.Teams like the Rams, Falcons and Packers have struggled with consistency this season, making Justin Tucker a possible option despite the backlash that may follow. As the playoff push intensifies, reliability becomes priceless. That might give Tucker the opening he needs, even if the decision comes with consequences for whichever team signs him.",Justin tucker can return to the field if he signs with a team.

Rangers Coach and NHL Reporter clash: John Tortorella and Larry Brooks’ legendary exchanges

Tired of too many ads? go ad free now

John Tortorella and Larry Brooks spent years on opposite sides of some of hockey’s most unforgettable coach-reporter clashes. Their exchanges often exploded into headline-worthy moments, shaping a unique chapter in the New York Rangers’ media landscape. But when news surfaced of Brooks’ passing, Tortorella set aside the fiery past and chose to remember the man who stood across from him with unwavering conviction.For Tortorella, Brooks wasn’t just the journalist who challenged him; he was a constant presence, someone who asked tough questions without hesitation and always showed up the next day, no matter how intense the previous encounter had been. That consistency, John Tortorella admitted, was what earned Larry Brooks his lasting respect.During Tortorella’s tenure as the New York Rangers’ head coach, his back-and-forth with Brooks became some of the most replayed moments in NHL media. Their tension began even before Tortorella took the Rangers job. In 2007, while still coaching the Tampa Bay Lightning, he clashed with Brooks during a media scrum after a round of pointed questions. It set the tone for years of memorable confrontations.From the 2010 moment when Tortorella refused a question from Brooks, to the infamous quip about Brooks being “beat up at the bus stop,” their exchanges were fiery, unfiltered, and often tense. In 2011, the friction returned during the Stanley Cup Playoffs, with both men accusing the other of twisting words or stirring unnecessary conflict. Yet, through every argument, neither backed down.Tortorella made it clear in his tribute that despite the confrontations, he never felt disrespected by Brooks. What he remembered most was the journalist’s persistence, professionalism, and willingness to show up day after day, regardless of how heated things had been. “We disagree, and we go at it,” Tortorella said. “But he’d be right back the next day.”Larry Brooks leaves behind a legacy as one of the most impactful voices in Rangers and NHL reporting. And through Tortorella’s words, it reminded that some of the toughest rivalries in sports come from mutual dedication, not animosity, but a shared commitment to the truth of the game.","John tortorella and larry brooks were on opposite sides of some of hockey’s most unforgettable coach-reporter clashes. Their exchanges often exploded into headline-worthy moments, shaping a unique chapter in the new york rangers’ media landscape.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125329732,width-1280,height-720,resizemode-4/125329732.jpg"

Upper-body setback sidelines Seth Jarvis for Carolina Hurricanes



More coverage on NHL:





The Carolina Hurricanes experienced a concerning moment on Friday night when forward Seth Jarvis was forced to leave the game due to an upper-body setback. During a play behind the net, Jarvis was struck near the eye by teammate Andrei Svechnikov’s high stick. He did not return for the remainder of the first period, with the team listing the incident as an upper-body issue. The play was sudden and highlighted the physical intensity of NHL games, even in routine situations.Jarvis has been a key contributor for Carolina this season, entering the night with 10 goals and five assists through 16 games. At 23 years old, his offensive production has been integral to the Hurricanes’ early-season performance, and his temporary absence may affect line rotations and scoring depth. Known for his speed, vision, and scoring ability, Jarvis has emerged as one of Carolina’s most promising young forwards.Injuries involving the upper body, particularly near the eye, are taken seriously due to their potential impact on a player’s vision, mobility, and overall performance. Carolina’s coaching and medical staff are monitoring his condition closely, focusing on a cautious approach to ensure full recovery.Even a short absence can influence team dynamics, and the Hurricanes are likely to make tactical adjustments to maintain offensive balance while he recovers.The incident underscores the physical risks inherent in professional hockey, where even routine plays can have unexpected consequences. Carolina’s depth chart may need adjustments while Jarvis is unavailable, with other forwards stepping into increased responsibilities. His experience and familiarity with the team’s systems will be missed, but the organization is prepared to adapt while evaluating the full extent of his setback. Updates on Jarvis’ status are expected in the coming days as the Hurricanes’ medical team continues its assessment.Additionally, this injury could influence upcoming matchups as the Hurricanes manage their roster and line combinations. Coaching staff may adjust strategies, modify power-play and penalty-kill units, and shift responsibilities among forwards to compensate for Jarvis’ absence. Maintaining offensive consistency without Jarvis will be a priority, while ensuring he receives proper care to return at full strength.","Seth jarvis was struck near the eye by teammate andrei svechnikov’s high stick.

Oscar Piastri gets honest support from Valtteri Bottas as McLaren pressure grows late in season,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/international-sports/oscar-piastri-gets-honest-support-from-valtteri-bottas-as-mclaren-pressure-grows-late-in-season/articleshow/125349897.cms,"Oscar Piastri gets honest support from Valtteri Bottas as McLaren pressure grows late in season (Image Via Getty)

Valtteri Bottas supports Oscar Piastri and says F1 can be “not a fair sport”





Oscar Piastri is watching his 2025 Formula 1 title hopes fade as his lead over teammate Lando Norris has fully disappeared. Earlier in the season, Oscar Piastri was ahead by 34 points. But now, in November, he is 24 points behind after a tough run of races. This swing happened after the summer break, and it has placed the young Australian under heavy pressure during an important part of the season.Lando Norris has been very strong since the break. Among his four consecutive podium finishes are major victories in Brazil and Mexico. His Mexico victory came with a substantial 30-second lead; his victory in Brazil came with a clear 10-second lead. On the other hand, Oscar Piastri hasn't stepped onto the podium since Monza, six races ago. Including Valtteri Bottas's comments, this disparity has sparked several paddock talks.Valtteri Bottas spoke about Oscar Piastri’s situation this week and showed strong support. He told 7News Adelaide that he knew the feeling well from his time racing with Lewis Hamilton at Mercedes between 2017 and 2021.Valtteri Bottas said, “I’ve been there. Been there, mate. It’s a tough sport.It’s not a fair sport. Sometimes you just deal with it. Oscar has so much time ahead of him. He has a great career ahead. Sometimes you need patience.”Valtteri Bottas also talked to CODE Sports, saying he still hopes Oscar Piastri can win the 2025 title. He said, “I am rooting for him for the title. He still has a chance.”Including the Qatar Grand Prix, which has a Sprint Race with eight bonus points, Oscar Piastri has three race weekends remaining to narrow the 24-point margin. Just 25 points behind Oscar Piastri, Max Verstappen is also battling for second in the championship.Former Haas head Guenther Steiner also offered Oscar Piastri some harsh words. He suggested Oscar Piastri quit McLaren if he is unable to return better following this year.Guenther Steiner said Oscar Piastri faced “mysterious problems” during the American races and had to change parts of his driving style.Also Read: Olympic Legend Surya Bonaly Loses All Her Medals To Las Vegas Thieves While Caring For Her Cancer-Stricken Mother Steiner said Oscar Piastri must reset over the winter or think about switching teams.The next race is the Las Vegas Grand Prix, where McLaren struggled in 2024.

New Orleans Pelicans cut ties with Willie Green after a brutal 2-10 collapse,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/new-orleans-pelicans-cut-ties-with-willie-green-after-a-brutal-2-10-collapse/articleshow/125352151.cms,"(Image Source - Getty Images)

New Orleans Pelicans front office ends Willie Green’s tenure hours after reviewing the team’s direction





The New Orleans Pelicans made a clear and firm decision when they fired Willie Green only hours after a 118-104 home loss to the Los Angeles Lakers on November 14. The move came after a start that did not meet the standards of a team coming off a 49-33 season. New Orleans opened 0-6 and became the first team in NBA history to lose three of its first six games by at least 30 points. The team also allowed 120 points or more in each of its first five games, marking the worst defensive opening in franchise history.These results left little room for interpretation. The performance level was not close to what the roster was built for, and the front office responded. Willie Green addressed the pressure earlier in the season and spoke about staying focused on the players, but the issues remained the same across multiple games. If you look at how the season went, the firing was based strictly on the on-court product and the urgent need to change direction. The Pelicans acted decisively because the stats from the early weeks supported a major adjustment.Pelicans Executive Vice President of Basketball Operations Joe Dumars delivered the news in a statement released by the team on Saturday morning. ""After careful evaluation, we have made the difficult decision to make a change at head coach,"" Dumars said in the official announcement.He added, ""I have the utmost respect for Willie Green, and I’m sincerely appreciative of his contributions to the Pelicans organization and the New Orleans community. We wish him and his family all the best in the future.""Team owner Gayle Benson backed the move in a separate statement issued the same day. ""I have tremendous admiration and respect for Willie Green, and I truly appreciate all he has done for our organization over the last few years,"" Benson said. ""This is a tough business and these are difficult decisions.""In a recent interview prior to the firing, Benson had expressed urgency about the team's direction, ""We need to improve immediately. Our roster is built for success right now."" She also reiterated her confidence in Dumars, stating, ""I really like Willie Green, but I hired Joe Dumars to assess our basketball operation. And that’s what he is doing.""Dumars had previously defended retaining Green after a disappointing 21-61 finish in the 2024-25 season, the second-worst record in franchise history for an 82-game campaign. Speaking to media in May 2025, Dumars said, ""I'm looking forward to going forward and working with Willie and to push us to success. You've got to set the bar. And that's what we're going to do."" He focused on the desired style of play, adding, ""The style of play — resilience, toughness, playing hard, never quit — that’s what we want people to see right away. ""The New Orleans Pelicans were done hoping the same approach would fix itself. Willie Green had four-plus seasons and two playoff runs, but the early problems kept repeating. Add injuries to Zion Williamson and Dejounte Murray, and the team looked stuck again. Putting James Borrego in charge is their attempt to wake the roster up before the season gets even harder to recover from.Also Read: Stephen Curry seen rocking Nike just a day after ending his Under Armour partnership in a match against San Antonio Spurs",New orleans pelicans front office ends willie green's tenure hours after reviewing the team’s direction.

As the 2026 Indian Premier League approaches, Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) enter the new season with a long history of strong squads, heavy expectations and a fan base that has remained one of the most loyal in the tournament.Their journey across seasons has swung between high-scoring spectacles, deep playoff pushes and repeated attempts to secure the league’s most elusive prize.That pursuit finally ended with their title breakthrough last season. RCB produced one of their most complete campaigns, driven by consistent top-order runs, reliable middle-overs control and a bowling group that delivered in pressure situations.Several players stood out through the year, forming the spine of the championship run and shaping the core the team now carries into 2026.Virat Kohli led the charge with 657 runs, producing eight half-centuries, that too, all in wins, and setting the tone with his aggressive approach in the powerplay. Phil Salt complemented him with rapid starts of his own, striking at 175.98 and consistently breaking open the first six overs.Rajat Patidar’s return as captain added stability, with crucial early-season half-centuries in important away wins that helped steady the side’s route to the final.Their bowling unit matched the batting group’s impact as well. Josh Hazlewood’s 22 wickets, including decisive powerplay bursts and death-overs control, turned tight games in RCB’s favour, while Krunal Pandya’s 17 wickets and late-order utility added balance.Jitesh Sharma and Romario Shepherd provided the finishing punch, delivering high-impact cameos in must-win situations. The abundance of match-winners across departments became the defining trait of RCB's campaign and the backbone of their climb to the title.The win also marked a shift in the side’s approach. After years of depending heavily on individual brilliance, RCB’s 2025 campaign was built on a collective effort, with contributions spread across departments. Their late-season surge, which carried them through the playoffs and into the final, highlighted that shift and has now become the base for their upcoming plans.The focus now shifts to building around the title-winning team. The retained core offers experience and consistency, while younger players who impressed in the previous season add depth.: Rs 16.4 crore: 8 (2 overseas)RCB, the defending champions, will have Rs 16.4 crore going into the auction, but they already have a settled playing eleven and would only look to solidify themselves by adding backups.","After the 2025 ipl triumph, rcb's focus shifted to retaining their crown with crucial retentions and smart releases.

As the 2026 Indian Premier League (IPL) approaches, Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) enter the new season with a decade’s worth of highs, lows, reinventions, heartbreaks, and historic moments behind them. Since their inception in 2013, SRH have built a reputation as one of the league’s most resilient and tactically sharp sides, known first for their world-class bowling core and, in recent years, for a fearless batting revolution that has rewritten IPL record books.Their journey through the seasons tells the story of a team constantly evolving, constantly fighting.SRH burst onto the scene in 2013 with a playoff finish and peaked in 2016, lifting their maiden IPL title under David Warner after a thrilling victory over Royal Challengers Bangalore, now Royal Challengers Bengaluru.What followed was an era of consistency, five straight playoff appearances from 2016 to 2020, including a runners-up finish in 2018. But the years after brought turbulence. Between 2021 and 2023, SRH endured some of their toughest campaigns, finishing in the bottom three each season.The turning point arrived in 2024, when Pat Cummins’s aggressive leadership and a revamped squad powered SRH to a spectacular resurgence.They shattered the all-time IPL score twice, dominated with an explosive top order, and reached the final, eventually finishing runners-up to Kolkata Knight Riders. The momentum faltered in 2025, a season marked by inconsistency, but SRH still clawed their way to a respectable 6th-place finish after a late surge.Now, heading into IPL 2026, the franchise stands at another crucial moment. With key retentions shaping the core and a blend of experience, youth, and firepower, SRH look ready to script their next chapter, one that aims to reclaim playoff stability and push once again for the title.Travis Head, Abhishek Sharma, Aniket Verma, B Smaran, Ishan Kishan, Heinrich Klaasen, Nitish Kumar Reddy, Harsh Dubey, Kamindu Mendis, Harshal Patel, Brydon Carse, Pat Cummins, Jaydev Unadkat, Eshan Malinga, Zeeshan AnsariAbhinav Manohar, Atharva Taide, Sachin Baby, Wiaan Mulder, Mohammed Shami, Smarjeet Singh, Rahul Chahar, Adam ZampaSRH will enter the auction with a purse of ₹25.5 crore and will look to strengthen their spin-bowling department.

Auction Details:





In a blockbuster trade ahead of IPL 2026, Chennai Super Kings (CSK) have acquired veteran Indian wicketkeeper-batter Sanju Samson from Rajasthan Royals (RR), while sending Men in Yellow legend Ravindra Jadeja and Sam Curran to RR. This move marks one of the biggest trade deals in IPL history.CSK Managing Director Kasi Viswanathan described the decision to part ways with Jadeja as one of the toughest the franchise has faced. “We felt the need for a top-order Indian batsman, and since not many Indian batsmen will be available at the auction, the trade window was the best option. Leaving Jaddu was extremely difficult given his contribution to CSK’s success over the years,” Viswanathan said in a video released by the team.Jadeja, who represented RR in 2008-09 and CSK from 2012 to 2025 (with brief stints at Kochi Tuskers Kerala and Gujarat Lions), leaves as CSK’s leading wicket-taker with 143 scalps in 186 matches and their highest run-getter in IPL history with 2,198 runs.CSK will have ₹43.4 crore left to spend at the IPL 2026 mega auction. They have 9 slots remaining to fill in the upcoming season. With the inclusion of Samson, their top order is settled, but they will look for middle-order batters and spinners in the auction, having let go of Jadeja and with Ashwin already retired.","Chennai super kings (csk) have acquired veteran indian wicketkeeper-batter sanju samson from rajasthan royals (rr), while sending men in yellow legend ravindra jadeja and sam curran to rr.

As the 2026 Indian Premier League (IPL) approaches, Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) enter another defining phase in their brief but eventful journey. Since joining the league in 2022, the franchise has experienced early playoff highs, difficult downturns, and seasons shaped by injuries, form slumps and constant rebuilding.Their campaigns have often revolved around sharp pace bowling, tactical flexibility and a core that mixed promising youth with seasoned performers. But the last season exposed significant gaps, especially in the fast-bowling group, forcing LSG back to the drawing board as they prepare for a crucial reset ahead of IPL 2026.In the previous campaign, Australia's Mitchell Marsh top scored for the the side with 627 runs in 13 matches - the joint-lowest in terms of matches played among the top 10 players with most runs last season. Surprisingly, no other player found room in the top 10, despite an explosive start from Nicholas Pooran, who ended the campaign on 524 in 14 games.Skipper Rishabh Pant , who was also the most expensive, ended the campaign with just 269 runs in 14 matches. He was brought to the side for a mammoth Rs 27 crore.LSG's bowlers were far from their best too, as no bowler found spot among the top 10 wicket takers. In fact, it was Digvesh Rathi who led the pack with 14 wickets from 13 matches.The franchise's focus will be on doing better in this department as they finalize their retentions and releases and head to the auction.LSG will go into the auction with a purse of Rs 22.9 crore, and they will look to buy an overseas pacer and backup spin-bowling all-rounders. With the release of David Miller, they will also be looking for finishers in the auction.","Lucknow super giants (lsg) have released david miller and rishabh pant.

As the countdown to the 2026 Indian Premier League (IPL) begins, the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) arrive at the new season carrying one of the league’s most colourful and fluctuating histories, marked by iconic title wins, bold leadership calls, dramatic rebuilds and, most recently, a return to dominance.Since the league’s inception, KKR have embodied unpredictability and flair, evolving from an underperforming side in the early years to a powerhouse capable of producing match-winners across disciplines.Their transformation began with the Gautam Gambhir era, which delivered two IPL titles in 2012 and 2014, redefining the team’s culture around aggression, discipline and tactical clarity.The seasons that followed brought mixed fortunes, with playoff appearances sprinkled between rebuilding phases. From 2015 to 2020, KKR remained competitive but inconsistent, often hovering around the mid-table as they tried to rediscover their title-winning balance.A significant shift came with the emergence of a new leadership and coaching setup, laying the foundation for their remarkable 2024 campaign.That season, KKR’s powerful all-round squad, explosive batting line-up and sharp bowling attack propelled them to the IPL title, defeating Sunrisers Hyderabad in a commanding final, re-establishing the franchise as a top-tier force.The 2025 season, though filled with intense battles and flashes of brilliance, didn’t replicate the previous year’s highs. KKR experienced ups and downs throughout the tournament, but retained a strong core and continued developing young talent, finishing mid-table and setting the stage for another rebuild.Now, with IPL 2026 on the horizon, KKR enter a crucial phase. Their retention decisions reflect a balanced approach, backing proven match-winners while nurturing the next generation, as they aim to reclaim their crown and push for another deep title run.Ajinkya Rahane, Angkrish Raghuvanshi, Anukul Roy, Harshit Rana, Manish Pandey, Ramandeep Singh, Rinku Singh, Rovman Powell, Sunil Narine, Umran Malik, Vaibhav Arora, Varun ChakaravarthyAndre Russell, Venkatesh Iyer, Quinton de Kock, Moeen Ali, Anrich Nortje, Mayank Markande (traded out).KKR will have a lot of work to do at the auction and will be the busiest of all franchises.

Players Released by DC Ahead of IPL 2026 Auction







NEW DELHI: Delhi Capitals on Friday unveiled their retained and released player lists ahead of the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2026 auction, scheduled later this year. The franchise has retained 17 players from the squad that finished fifth last season.After internal reviews and discussions, the Capitals have released Mohit Sharma, Faf du Plessis, Sediqullah Atal, Jake Fraser-McGurk, Manvanth Kumar and Darshan Nalkande ahead of the upcoming edition.Core players retained include Axar Patel, KL Rahul, Kuldeep Yadav, Mitchell Starc and Tristan Stubbs. The squad has also been bolstered by the arrival of Nitish Rana, who joins DC in a trade that sees Donovan Ferreira move to Rajasthan Royals.Delhi finished fifth in IPL 2025 and failed to make it past the league stage, continuing a trend of inconsistency that has held the franchise back in recent years.With a talented squad and a history of occasional brilliance, DC will look to rebuild momentum and return to the playoffs in IPL 2026.In the 2025 season, Delhi Capitals played 14 matches, winning seven, losing six, and registering one no result. Their win percentage of 50.00% reflects a season where they showed sparks of promise but lacked the sustained dominance needed to secure a top-four finish.While the team delivered some commanding performances with both bat and ball, crucial moments in key matches cost them valuable points.A look at Delhi Capitals’ historical performance in the IPL provides a clearer picture of their fluctuating journey. The table of their year-wise standings shows a franchise with high peaks but equally deep troughs. DC made impressive runs in the early years, finishing as semi-finalists in 2008 and topping the league stage in 2009 before another semifinal exit. Their best phase came between 2019 and 2021, where they reached the playoffs twice and finished runners-up in 2020—their closest shot at a maiden IPL trophy.However, the table also reveals several disappointing seasons, particularly between 2013 and 2018, where they consistently finished in the bottom half, including last place in 2013, 2014 and 2018. Post-2021, the Capitals again slipped into inconsistency, finishing 5th, 9th and 6th between 2022 and 2024. The fifth-place finish in 2025 continued this pattern, showcasing a team capable of competing but unable to convert opportunities.Overall, the standings table highlights Delhi Capitals’ inconsistency: strong runs followed by sudden declines. Their runner-up finish in 2020 stands out as the franchise's best-ever campaign, but they have struggled to replicate that form since.Heading into IPL 2026, the Capitals will look to address these inconsistencies and build a squad capable of returning to playoff contention. With a fresh approach and renewed focus, Delhi will hope that the upcoming season marks the beginning of a stronger, more stable era.Delhi Capitals IPL 2026 Retentions: Complete Squad OverviewTristan StubbsSameer RizviKarun NairDonovan Ferreira (Trade)Nitish Rana (Trade – Rs 4.2 Cr)Jake Fraser-McGurkKL RahulAbhishek PorelALL-ROUNDERSAxar PatelAayush BadoniVicky OstwalMahipal LomrorTripuranha VijayAjay MandalManav SutharKuldeep YadavMitchell StarcMukesh KumarTushar DeshpandeT NatarajanDarshan NalkandeMohit SharmaRs 21.8 Cr8 (5 Overseas)Mohit SharmaFaf du PlessisSediqullah AtalJake Fraser-McGurkManvanth KumarDarshan NalkandeDonovan Ferreira (traded out)DC will enter the auction with Rs 21.8 crore.

AUCTION BUDGET:





As the 2026 Indian Premier League draws closer, Punjab Kings will look to bounce back from the heartbreak of the previous season and launch a renewed campaign for their maiden IPL trophy. Under the leadership of Shreyas Iyer, PBKS came agonisingly close in IPL 2025, falling just six runs short against Royal Challengers Bengaluru in a thrilling final. Despite the defeat, Punjab’s performance throughout the season reflected significant improvement and marked one of their strongest campaigns in recent years.In IPL 2025, Punjab Kings finished at the top of the points table, showcasing remarkable consistency. They won 10 of their 17 matches, with six losses and one no-result, registering an impressive win percentage of 63.64%. Their journey to the final included a confident victory over Mumbai Indians in Qualifier 2, reinforcing their status as one of the most balanced and competitive sides of the season.The 2025 squad featured a strong mix of experienced international stars and promising young Indian talent. Led by Shreyas Iyer, the squad included dynamic players like Glenn Maxwell, Marcus Stoinis, Josh Inglis and Marco Jansen, while homegrown talents such as Prabhsimran Singh, Arshdeep Singh, Harpreet Brar, Shashank Singh and Nehal Wadhera played pivotal roles.Rising names like Xavier Bartlett, Priyansh Arya, Musheer Khan and Suryansh Shedge added depth and energy to the lineup. This combination of youth and experience was one of the biggest strengths of PBKS in 2025.The franchise’s historical performance in the IPL highlights its inconsistent yet occasionally brilliant journey. As Kings XI Punjab, the team enjoyed strong seasons in 2008 and 2014, finishing as semi-finalists and runners-up respectively. However, they also endured several years at the bottom of the table. After rebranding to Punjab Kings in 2021, the team’s fortunes fluctuated but eventually surged in 2025 when they topped the league standings and finished as runners-up—signalling a resurgence under new leadership.The table of past seasons clearly reflects the team’s evolution: a mix of mid-table finishes, a few disappointing campaigns, and standout years where they looked like title contenders. The dramatic turnaround in 2025 stands out as their best finish since the famous 2014 season.Shreyas Iyer (c), Nehal Wadhera, Priyansh Arya, Prabhsimran Singh, Shashank Singh, Pyla Avinash, Harnoor Pannu, Musheer Khan, Vishnu Vinod, Marcus Stoinis, Azmatullah Omarzai, Suryansh Shedge, Mitchell Owen, Arshdeep Singh, Vijaykumar Vyshak, Yash Thakur, Xavier Bartlett, Lockie Ferguson, Yuzvendra Chahal, Harpreet BrarGlenn Maxwell, Josh Inglis, Aaron Hardie, Kuldeep Sen, Praveen DubeyRs 11.50 crore is left for Punjab to spend in the upcoming auction, and they have the second-lowest purse going into the auction after Mumbai Indians.","In ipl 2025, punjab kings finished at the top of the points table, showcasing remarkable consistency.
