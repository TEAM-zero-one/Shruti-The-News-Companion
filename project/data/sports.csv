JIND: BJP Rajya Sabha MP and former National Commission for Women chairperson Rekha Sharma on Monday claimed that Commonwealth Games medal winner and Congress MLA Vinesh Phogat lied about certain things to enter politics.Without naming anyone against whom Phogat levelled the allegations, Sharma said Phogat used this ""false"" narrative for her benefit, and this led her to become an MLA from Julana. Sharma made the claims when she was in Julana town of Jind district on Sunday to meet party workers in connection with urban local body elections in Haryana. Even as Sharma made the claims, a case of sexual harassment against Wrestling Federation of India former chief Brij Bhushan Saran Singh is already in court. Vinesh had, along with wrestlers Bajrang Punia and Sakshi Malik, had sat on a protest for long to demand action against Brij Bhushan.A Delhi court had, in May last year, framed the charges of sexual harassment and using force to outrage women's modesty against Brij Bhushan in the criminal case filed against him by the female wrestlers.After she had been disqualified from the Paris Olympics last year, Vinesh had also accused Indian Olympics Association president P T Usha of not providing her enough support. Sharma also accused Phogat of making statements that were ""detrimental to Indian society and govt"". ""The govt supported her, and the case she filed against someone is in court, and that person in question will be punished,"" said Sharma.She added Phogat turned all of this into a political issue to make her entry into politics. ""This is my first visit to Julana. Perhaps I should have come earlier. That was a mistake. The seat we lost, we wouldn't have lost if I came sooner,"" she said.Two months ago, Sharma was elected unopposed to the Rajya Sabha from Haryana. She replaced the state's rural development and panchayat minister Krishna Lal Panwar, who resigned from his Rajya Sabha seat after being elected as the MLA from Israna in Panipat.

Taylor Swift has been sacked from Instagram after being booed at the Super Bowl

Taylor Swift has been facing backlash from Instagram after being booed at the Super Bowl, according to SportsMillions. Conservative fans, including Alexis Winters of Queens, believe the drop in followers and booing signals Swift should focus on music and avoid politics.Travis Kelce, boyfriend of Taylor Swift, has gained over 12,370 followers on Instagram following his Super Bowl loss to the Philadelphia Eagles, according to SportsMillions, which used Social Blade to track their social media stats.Taylor Swift's Instagram following has plummeted to over 144,200 followings following the Super Bowl LIX controversy , according to SportsMillions data, causing speculation about the reasons behind the backlash.Swift's presence at the Super Bowl, where she supported her boyfriend, Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, was met with mixed reactions. Some fans were excited to see her, while others expressed frustration, particularly those who disagree with her political stances. Some speculate it stems from her growing political influence.Alexis Winters, a member of the New York Young Republican Club, attributed the decrease in followers to a broader sentiment among certain conservative fans. ""We are tired of celebrities calling down to us from their ivory towers, giving their two cents on policies that will never impact them,"" Winters stated.She further added, ""Taylor Swift is simply the best example of this, and her loss of hundreds of thousands of Instagram followers represents the hundreds of thousands of Americans who chose their president over the woke Hollywood mob.""While Taylor Swift's Instagram followers declined, Kelce gained over 12,370 followers after the Super Bowl, according to Social Blade tracking. Some fans argue that Swift's criticism is unfair, especially when compared to Kelce's reception.

""When Travis made an appearance on the Eras Tour, Swifties were excited to see him and cheered him on. When Taylor was shown on the Jumbotron, she was booed,"" Piwowarczyk noted. ""I understand the demographic of the Super Bowl attendees are not fans of Taylor Swift, but the generalized hatred towards her for simply supporting her boyfriend is uncalled for and gross.""Also read: Travis Kelce’s ex Kayla Nicole stuns in a viral Fenty ad, blending seduction and empowerment that could make Taylor Swift nervous Taylor Swift's influence remains strong, with her Eras Tour becoming the highest-grossing concert tour of all time.

Cody Rhodes might get enticed by The Rock 's offer and choose to accept it at the WWE Elimination Chamber 2025 event.Cody Rhodes has been a remarkable, Undisputed WWE Champion for almost a year. It has been noticed by every member of the WWE Universe, but unknown to all until now, The Rock was also paying close attention to his title reign. This led to The Final Boss returning to SmackDown last week and extending a lucrative offer to become his champion and take his career to the same level as The Rock.With Cody Rhodes asked to deliver his answer to The Rock at the WWE Elimination Chamber 2025, here are the three reasons Cody Rhodes would be enticed to accept his offer:The WWE Universe might have missed it, but the babyface and fan favorite Cody Rhodes has already dropped multiple signs of a heel turn over the last few months. The first was witnessed at the WWE Saturday Night's Main Event in December 2024 in his match against Kevin Owens when he picked up a controversial win by delivering the Cross Rhodes on him on a steel chair. He showed his remorseful side even in their ladder match at the Royal Rumble 2025 PLE and had no sympathy for beating down KO. This could have been the early signs of his heel turn, which would have been triggered by his accepting The Rock's offer at Elimination Chamber.As The Rock mentioned, Cody Rhodes has achieved immense success in his WWE career. But it is nowhere close to the worldwide fame commanded by The Final Boss. The Rock made it clear that Rhodes can have those same opportunities if he sells his soul to him. In the greed to claim more success and, as The Rock said, secure the future of his family, Cody Rhodes might just accept his offer.It is heavily rumored that John Cena is set to win the 2025 Men's Elimination Chamber match. In doing so, he will earn the opportunity to challenge Cody Rhodes for the Undisputed WWE Championship at WrestleMania 41 . With Cena on his farewell tour, he has been garnering huge positive reactions. This makes it a perfect scenario for Cody Rhodes to turn heel in their feud by becoming The Rock's Corporate Champion against the babyface Cena, making it more intriguing on the road to Las Vegas.","Cody rhodes has been a remarkable, undisputed wwe champion for almost a year.

Bruins battle key injuries: Brad Marchand’s health, Hampus Lindholm’s absence, McAvoy Charlie’s recovery

Boston Bruins GM Don Sweeney has provided concerning updates on team captain Brad Marchand’s health. The star forward has been dealing with injuries throughout the season, raising concerns about his availability for key games.Brad Marchand had three surgeries in summer 2024 for elbow, groin, and abdomen issues but returned for the season opener. Concerns about his durability grew when he was kept out of overtime and the shootout against Ottawa, though coach Joe Sacco said it was a tactical decision. Fans remain worried about his long-term health.In addition to Marchand’s situation, the Bruins are also struggling with major injuries to key players. Hampus Lindholm, a crucial defenseman, is unlikely to return this season after undergoing surgery for a fractured patella. He sustained the injury during a game against the St. Louis Blues on November 12, 2024.According to Bruins insider Conor Ryan, Hampus Lindholm is “unlikely” to return this season. “It’s going to take a little more time to heal naturally and we don’t want to put a timeline on when he’ll be back to 100 percent,” Sweeney stated, via NHL.com.Another significant setback is Charlie McAvoy, who remains hospitalized due to an infection and a serious right shoulder injury. He suffered an AC joint injury during the 4 Nations Face-Off tournament and later developed an infection that required treatment at Massachusetts General Hospital. There is no clear timeline for his return.Marchand’s health is crucial for the Bruins' playoff hopes.He is in the final year of his eight-year, $49 million contract.In the final year of his contract, he hopes to play until 40, but injuries and his future with the team remain uncertain.Also Read: New Jersey Devils Nico Daws recorded his first NHL shutout with 29 saves in a 5-0 victory over the Nashville Predators With important games ahead against teams like the Maple Leafs, Islanders, and Penguins, the Bruins will need Marchand at full strength.

Chicago Bulls injury report for tonight’s game against the Philadelphia 76ers (February 24, 2025)

When and where to watch the Philadelphia 76ers play tonight against the Chicago Bulls (February 24, 2025)?

Theface mounting challenges as they prepare to host the Chicago Bulls on Monday, February 24, at the Wells Fargo Center. With six players listed on the injury report, including star center, the team’s prospects for the game remain uncertain. Embiid, a pivotal figure for the 76ers, is marked as questionable due to a knee injury, leaving fans and analysts speculating about his availability. Joel Embiid ’s potential absence could significantly impact the Philadelphia 76ers, who are already struggling with a 20-36 record this season. The reigning MVP has been a cornerstone of the team’s performance, and his limited presence on the court has coincided with the team’s recent struggles. Alongside Embiid, Tyrese Maxey, the team’s leading scorer with 27.4 points per game, is also questionable due to a finger injury. The duo’s uncertain status adds to the growing list of concerns for Philadelphia, which includes Jared McCain (out for the season), Eric Gordon (wrist), Kyle Lowry (hip), and Justin Edwards (ankle). The 76ers ’ offensive output has been lackluster, averaging 108.9 points per game, ranking 26th in the league. Defensively, they allow 113.0 points per contest, placing then 14th. Without Joel Embiid and Maxey, the team’s ability to compete against the Bulls, who average 115.9 points per game (10th in the NBA), could be severely compromised.On the Bulls’ side, injuries have also taken a toll, with Patrick Williams (knee), Ayo Dosunmu (shoulder), and Jalen Smith (face) ruled out. However, Coby White, who averages 12.8 points per game, is listed as probable despite an ankle issue. Chicago’s Nikola Vucevic, averaging 19.1 points and 10.3 rebounds per game, will likely pose a significant challenge for the 76ers’ depleted lineup.The game, scheduled for 7:00 PM ET, will be broadcast on NBCS-PH and CHSN, with live streaming available on Fubo. As the 76ers navigate their injury woes, Joel Embiid’s status remains the focal point. His presence could provide a much-needed boost, but his absence would further highlight the team’s struggles in an already difficult season.Fans eagerly await updates on Embiid’s condition, as his availability could determine whether the 76ers can halt their downward spiral or if the Bulls will capitalize on their opponent’s vulnerabilities.","The philadelphia 76ers host the chicago bulls on monday, february 24, at the wells fargo center.

Tua Tagovailoa’s tenure with the Dolphins might come to an end as the team might replace the QB by drafting Jalen Milroe,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/tua-tagovailoas-tenure-with-the-dolphins-might-come-to-an-end-as-the-team-might-replace-the-qb-by-drafting-jalen-milroe/articleshow/118506789.cms,"Image via Getty Images

Jalen Milroe might replace Tua Tagovailoa

Jalen Milroe , despite a subpar 2024 season at Alabama, is a promising quarterback prospect in the 2025 NFL Draft. If he finds the right scheme, he could become a franchise quarterback. Tua Tagovailoa , currently the Miami Dolphins quarterback, may be considering a move due to concussions and inconsistent performances.Tua Tagovailoa, a Dolphins quarterback, has a decent record with 15,760 yards and 101 touchdowns over five years. However, he has thrown 45 interceptions and taken 113 sacks. In the lone playoff game against the Kansas City Chiefs, he failed under pressure, completing 51.3% of his passes for 199 yards and a touchdown.Tagovailoa is a game-managing quarterback with mobility to avoid pressure but not necessarily take off and win on the ground. Mike McDaniel's system hides his inefficiencies, as he lacks arm strength to consistently throw the ball down the field.McDaniel's scheme helps condense the field, make reads easier, and have more routes schemed open underneath. However, this works against weaker defenses, which are not the recipe for success for the Dolphins to win a championship. A new quarterback under center is needed.Jalen Milroe, a talented quarterback from Alabama, demonstrated advanced IQ through pump fakes and eye movement, resulting in 2,834 yards, 16 touchdowns, and 11 interceptions. His rushing ability, which included 879 yards and 20 touchdowns on the ground, opened up opportunities for the Miami offense that uses RPOs and play action. Milroe's versatility on the ground would improve offensive efficiency, as he could disguise plays better and open up opportunities for the Miami offense.Milroe, a talented quarterback, has shown the ability to open up through the air and has accurate throwing abilities. His anticipation helps him lead receivers and adjust under pressure. Despite a drop in stock due to sporadic play and inconsistency in the Senior Bowl, the upside is there. The Dolphins will likely choose Milroe as their franchise quarterback, similar to Anthony Richardson, and it will depend on the right team's draft.Also Read: “He can't do anything”: AJ Brown expressed skepticism about Travis Hunter's dual-player ambitions Jalen Milroe was a junior at Tompkins High School in Katy, Texas, and threw for 2,689 yards and 29 touchdowns as a junior. He also rushed for eight touchdowns and 378 yards. As a senior, he passed for 1,136 yards and 13 touchdowns.

Kevin Durant Shuts Down Rumors About $60M Rapper’s Kendrick Lamar Beef: Here’s Why,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/kevin-durant-shuts-down-rumors-about-60m-rappers-kendrick-lamar-beef-heres-why/articleshow/118512414.cms,"Credits: NBA and Getty Images

Kevin Durant's No-Look Pass on Hip-Hop Beef: Why KD Isn't Here for the ""Fake Tough Guy"" Stuff

From alley-oops to hot takes, Kevin Durant is known for his smooth moves on and off the court. He's a hoops legend, a social media maven, and apparently, a hip-hop head with some strong opinions. While KD’s known to rep Drake (who, let’s be real, probably has a custom-made OVO jersey just for KD), he’s now weighing in on the Kendrick Lamar-J. Cole's situation, and he's not holding back. This isn’t just your average sports commentator dabbling in music this is a full-court press on hip-hop culture.Over the weekend, Durant dribbled his way into the discourse surrounding J. Cole 's new single, CLOUDs, released via Cole's blog. Durant’s tweet, a swift and decisive crossover move, read: ""I don't care bout none of that fake tough guy shit. This is mastery."" Now, what’s so special about this track? It’s Cole’s first release since Port Antonio in October 2024, and it comes amidst the lingering fallout from his brief entanglement in the Drake-Kendrick Lamar beef.Remember last April? Kendrick dropped some lyrical bombs on both Drake and Cole in Future and Metro Boomin’s Like That. Cole responded with 7 Minute Drill, a diss track aimed at Lamar. But, in a move that shocked fans, Cole pulled the song from streaming services and publicly apologized to Kendrick. This apology, while perhaps showing maturity, also opened Cole up to criticism, with many labeling him as soft. Durant, however, isn’t buying into the ""fake tough guy"" narrative. He’s clearly impressed by Cole's artistry, and he's not afraid to say it, even if it means going against the grain.Durant's tweet isn’t just about CLOUDs. It seems to be a broader statement about the culture of hip-hop and the pressure artists face to maintain a certain image. KD, who's seen his share of tough competition on the court, recognizes true skill and artistry when he sees it, regardless of the surrounding drama. He's essentially saying, ""Forget the beef, focus on the bars.""ALSO READ: Miami Heat vs. Milwaukee Bucks Game Preview (02/23): Starting Five, Injury Report, Start Time, How to Watch, and More NBA star Kevin Durant recently shared his perspectives on rapper Kendrick Lamar , continuing his engagement with hip-hop culture.

Freddie Freeman Returns to Action After Ankle Surgery, Eyes on Tokyo Opener



If he had come to the Cactus League by himself, it would have given Dodger fans some reason to breathe-easily; Freddie Freeman is set to Cactus League debut this Thursday! After a winter of uncertainty with ankle surgery , Freeman is finally on his way back to the diamond, and the buzz is building. Almost too perfectly, this works out with prep for the season opener against the Cubs in Tokyo.It has been a slow but steady process for Freeman. Since the surgery on his right ankle in December, the veteran first baseman has taken it easy during spring training camp with the Dodgers . Every pro athlete knows not to rush back from injury, but Dave Roberts sees an optimistic progress with Freeman.""The plan is for Freddie Freeman to play on Thursday."" This week is obviously an important week for the rehab process leading into the Cactus League. He will step up to the plate against the Rockies for his first official action in spring training. And although this will still qualify as a light workout, there is no doubt he will be revved up. After months of waiting, he is now almost back on track.“I don’t think I will be in the games at the beginning. It looks like I’m going to start a running progression right when I get to spring training,” Freeman said at DogerFest. “As of right now, I am on track to be able to play in Tokyo.” Once the Dodgers began spring camp, Freeman’s excitement for the 2025 season was evident as he even broke some recovery rules. “I wasn’t supposed to swing today, but I swung,” Freeman said. “I couldn’t help myself.”Freeman's Cactus League debut isn’t just a feel-good moment for the team and fans—it’s a countdown to the season opener. The Dodgers are gearing up for their two-game series in Tokyo against the Cubs, starting March 18. Despite a slower start to camp, Freeman is expected to be ready for that international showdown.All signs point to a return to form for Freeman—get ready for some fun baseball ahead!","Freddie freeman is set to make his cactus league debut on thursday.

“Money talks”: Fans calls out Vladimir Guerrero Jr. as money-minded for ditching Yankees,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/mlb/news/money-talks-fans-calls-out-vladimir-guerrero-jr-as-money-minded-for-ditching-yankees/articleshow/118509938.cms,"Image via: Mark Goldman/Getty Images



Vladimir Guerrero Jr. Sparks Debate: Is He Playing the Yankees Card for a Bigger Paycheck?



""Money Talks and Bulls Walk"": Fans Aren't Having It



Rumors in the MLB never settle down for long. There have been many whispers surrounding Guerrero Jr. and his future for most of the offseason, with Toronto Blue Jays fans and fans from all other circles hanging on his every word. Then, just when things looked like they were fading away, Vladimir put the kettle back on.Recently, Guerrero's interview found its way to raise some eyebrows, given his humor about loyalty to the team in light of the whispers that maybe he had a change of heart — and of course, money had to be brought into it. Starring Vladimir Guerrero Jr. decided to attack these rumors about his future head-on for a change.The slugger had fans scared he might head for the Bronx and was ready to clear the air. ""If I go to free agency, every team — all 30 teams — will have an opportunity to sit down with me, to talk to me."" So, he kind of said that he doesn't mind exploring his options but is not in a hurry to leave Toronto.Contrastingly, as usual, some fans read between the lines, and the discussion very quickly turned into a debate about Vlad's loyalty. Some others were quick to point out that he has probably got his newfound ""leverage"" in the negotiation game.Guerrero Jr. made things clear; fans refused to believe him. He had been quite vocal about never playing for the Yankees — until now. A handful of fans echoed the sentiment that this is just Vlad's attempt to drive up his market value. ""He said once upon a time never the Yankees, but money talks and bulls walk,"" one user commented, calling out Vlad for what they felt was an obvious attempt at using the Yankees name to secure a bigger payday.Some fans commented, ""What's he supposed to say? Of course, he is going to keep his options open."" Others were more adamant: ""Vlad would be silly not to. He wants that huge contract and the Yankees help drive up the max value most likely."" Fans believe this is all business. Guerrero Jr. is just trying to maneuver for his advantage, with free agency approaching shortly.For some reason, fans think that what Vlad comments is just another form of the game: using the Yankees' name to fuel speculations to raise his asking price for an age-old tactic, and there is no reason to think Guerrero Jr. is any different. After all, he knows where the money is - and that is not just in Toronto. Many believe the slugger has been maintaining this image of being pursued for the biggest contract possible with rumors of Yankee interest.And then there are a few thoughts otherwise: Maybe, just maybe, Guerrero Jr. is legitimately leaving his options open, as he said. The Blue Jays have attempted to fortify the roster, and perhaps, with additional talent like Anthony Santander, the team can keep him for the long term. But as per fans, invoking the Yankees is just a cool bargaining tactic that would only rest on his value.In the end, the fan reaction is clear: Guerrero Jr. is playing the game with free agency in view, and it's all about value. Whether he is really leaving Toronto or just using the Yankees to raise his contract value is still debatable. But one thing is for sure, ""money talks,"" and it is doing so very loudly at the moment.Vladimir Guerrero Jr. sparks speculation about his future, with fans debating whether his mention of free agency and the Yankees is a strategy to boost his market value or genuine interest.","Vladimir guerrero jr. sparked speculation about his future with a recent interview.
