Smriti Mandhana breaks silence after wedding cancelled: 'I don’t think I love anything more than cricket',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/smriti-mandhana-breaks-silence-after-wedding-cancelled-i-dont-think-i-love-/articleshow/125892786.cms,"Smriti Mandhana (X)

NEW DELHI: India's batting sensation and ODI World Cup-winning vice-captain Smriti Mandhana said that one truth has become clearer to her than anything else over the past 12 years as a professional cricketer — there is nothing she cares about more deeply than the game of cricket.India’s most accomplished left-handed batter in women's cricket looked back on her journey, from her international debut in 2013 to helping India lift the ICC ODI World Cup last month for the first time in their history, while speaking at the Amazon Smbhav Summit on Wednesday. Mandhana spoke openly about what fuels her commitment each day as an India cricketer. “I don’t think there is anything I love more than cricket. Putting on the India jersey is the biggest motivation. No matter what you’re going through, that one thought helps you block everything out,” she said.Even as a child, she knew exactly what she wanted after growing up. “The obsession with batting was always there. People around me didn’t really get it, but in my head I wanted only one thing — to be known as a world champion.”She described the ODI World Cup win as the result of years of hard work and disappointment.“This trophy was the outcome of everything we’ve been fighting for.I’ve played for more than a decade, and so many times things didn’t fall into place. Before the final, we pictured that moment over and over again. When it finally appeared on the screen, it genuinely gave us goosebumps. It was emotional in every way.”The occasion was even more overwhelming with legends Mithali Raj and Jhulan Goswami watching from the stands. “We desperately wanted to win it for them too. Seeing tears in their eyes felt like the whole of women’s cricket had achieved something. It was a victory for everyone who came before us.”Mandhana shared the biggest lessons she carried from the triumph: “You always start from zero, regardless of what you scored previously. And never play for yourself — that’s something we kept telling one another.”This event also marked Mandhana’s first public appearance since she confirmed the cancellation of her wedding with musician Palash Muchhal .",Smriti mandhana spoke at the amazon smbhav summit on wednesday.

Kyle Tucker and Astros Fallout

While the upside is enormous, the moves come with real risks:

Why These Moves Could Redefine the AL East Race

The Baltimore Orioles are suddenly operating like a win-now powerhouse, with two major offseason swings dominating league chatter. First, the club has reportedly finalized a five-year, $155 million contract with Pete Alonso. Now, executives around the league believe Baltimore is preparing a second strike: an all-out pursuit of free-agent star Kyle Tucker. If both moves land, oddsmakers project the Orioles’ World Series odds to jump from +3500 into the league’s top tier, potentially cracking the top-10 contender range.This one-two punch would dramatically alter the AL East landscape, transforming a young, pitching-thin roster into a heavyweight built around elite power, contact, and postseason-tested production.Pete Alonso’s arrival locks down first base immediately. Ryan Mountcastle becomes the roster piece pushed aside, with Alonso’s 30-plus homer floor and righty-friendly power profile fitting perfectly in Camden Yards. His shift away from Citi Field’s pitcher-leaning layout is expected to boost both slugging and consistency, offering the Orioles a dependable middle-order anchor for five seasons.Kyle Tucker requires no trade capital, only financial firepower.The All-Star outfielder is projected to command an eight-to-ten-year contract worth roughly $400 million after his tenure with Houston. A signing of that scale would give the Baltimore Orioles one of the most complete hitters in baseball, and a proven base-stealer capable of 20 bags per season.After securing Tucker, Baltimore could flip from surplus to strategic sellers. Outfielders like Heston Kjerstad or Colton Cowser become valuable trade chips for rotation upgrades, especially important for a team light on frontline pitching. The club’s recent acquisition of Taylor Ward only heightens this pressure, creating an outfield logjam that almost guarantees movement.Both players sit in the 28-31 age range, right in the center of their prime production years. Pete Alonso brings All-Star muscle and a top-tier hard-hit profile. Kyle Tucker brings elite on-base skill, gap power, and defensive value, with multiple All-Star nods backing up his consistency.Their skillsets complement each other cleanly, one delivers explosive right-handed slugging, the other stabilizes the offense with left-handed balance and speed. For an Orioles lineup that struggled generating righty home-run production in 2025, this mix solves a central issue.These figures show why the Orioles see synergy in this pairing. Alonso’s top-end batted-ball data boosts run production, while Tucker’s WAR reflects value across contact, discipline, and fielding.• 60–70 combined home runs added to a lineup needing thump• A legitimate jump in championship potential from +3500 odds• Long-term lineup stability extending through 2033 and beyond• Flexibility to move surplus outfield talent for pitching help• A hitter-friendly ballpark compared to Citi Field• A multi-year payday after betting on himself in 2025• A chance to anchor a rising contender in the AL East• Tucker secures a franchise-changing mega contract• Houston clears significant payroll amid its shifting roster timelinePotential Downsides for Baltimore• Combined deals could push payroll past $60 million per year for two players• Luxury tax pressure forces the Orioles toward budget pitching signings• Trading Ward, Cowser, or Kjerstad weakens long-term outfield depth• Tucker’s hand injury history and Alonso’s rising strikeout rate (20 percent-plus in 2025) pose durability questionsIf Baltimore pulls off both acquisitions, the Orioles leap from promising to dangerous. The team gains two middle-order stars who have thrived in high-leverage stretches, instantly rivaling the Yankees and Guardians for division control. Betting markets have already reacted: Alonso’s signing alone nudged the Orioles upward, while projections indicate a Tucker addition would elevate them into the tier with the Dodgers and Phillies.With the Mets sliding after losing Alonso and the Astros navigating a possible roster reset, Baltimore’s aggression would dominate the offseason conversation.The Orioles rarely swing big. This offseason, they look ready to swing twice. Signing Pete Alonso gives them home-run security and presence. Chasing Kyle Tucker gives them a modern offensive superstar. Together, these moves position Baltimore not just as a threat, but as a frontrunner in the American League, reshaping expectations for 2026 and beyond.Also read: MLB trade rumors: New York Mets predicted to land $400 million Chicago Cubs superstar outfielder to bolster rotation amid treacherous offseasonz If ownership commits the financial muscle required, Birdland may be on the brink of its boldest era yet.","The baltimore orioles are reportedly close to signing pete alonso and kyle tucker.

Tom Brady reacts strongly to Michigan football turmoil as Sherrone Moore’s arrest leaves the Wolverines stunned,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/tom-brady-reacts-strongly-to-michigan-football-turmoil-as-sherrone-moores-arrest-leaves-the-wolverines-stunned/articleshow/125923959.cms,"Tom Brady addresses Michigan football crisis with candid thoughts after Sherrone Moore’s arrest shakes the program (Getty Images)

Tom Brady doesn't want Michigan stars leaving amid Sherrone Moore fallout



Tom Brady’s voice carries weight in any football conversation, but it hits differently when the University of Michigan is involved. As the school faces a storm of uncertainty after the arrest of former head coach Sherrone Moore, the program’s identity has been shaken. In the middle of this tension, Brady stepped forward, not as an NFL legend, but as an alumnus trying to steady a team at risk of falling apart. His words arrived at a moment when rival programs were circling, eager to lure away the Wolverines’ top talent.What could have been a quiet recruitment battle quickly turned into a public tug-of-war. With fans confused, players uneasy and critics loud, Brady pushed for unity. His stance was not about looking back at Michigan’s past, but about protecting the athletes who must carry the school forward during its most fragile moment.The arrest of Sherrone Moore created a wave of reactions inside and outside Ann Arbor. Reports about an alleged “inappropriate relationship” placed the entire program under a harsh spotlight as the City of Saline Police Department confirmed it had detained Moore after investigators found “credible” evidence. Pittsfield Township Police later added that an “alleged assault” had been reported and that the suspect was held at Washtenaw County Jail pending charges.The investigation remains open, and the distractions continue.Amid this turmoil, the spotlight shifted to Michigan’s prized quarterbacks, especially Bryce Underwood. Rivals did not waste a second. Former LSU star Tyrann Mathieu jumped in publicly, urging Underwood to consider a fresh start in Louisiana. On X, he wrote: “Come home son @BryceUnderwoo16. We are waiting & will accept you with open arms. FOREVER LSU.”Brady was watching, and he refused to let the pitch go unchallenged. Commenting under Sports Illustrated’s post about Mathieu’s message, Brady fired back with clarity and purpose. “He's a wolverine !!! And gonna get back to work and lead us next year!!! LFG.”Fans reacted in every direction, with some calling for Brady to coach the team himself, while others mocked the timing. But beneath the noise, his point was simple. Michigan cannot afford to lose its foundation while navigating a crisis. Stability matters. Loyalty matters. And to Brady, the Wolverines’ future leaders should stay right where they are.If Michigan is going to rebuild its footing, it will need players who choose commitment over chaos. Brady made sure Underwood, and everyone watching, heard that message loud and clear.Also Read: Fired Michigan coach Sherrone Moore reportedly felt “suicidal” after police responded to tense visit at assistant’s apartment","Tom brady addresses michigan football crisis with candid thoughts after sherrone moore’s arrest shakes the program.

When someone truly relishes their sport on every level, staying in the game for the long haul feels natural. But for those who lose that “fun” aspect, stepping away becomes a way to protect their well-being. This crossroads may be where Cincinnati Bengals star quarterback Joe Burrow now stands. At a recent press conference, the 29-year-old signal caller revealed that while his toe injury did not dull his competitive drive, it did prompt a deep shift in his outlook.For Burrow, joy is essential to endure the mental and physical grind. To keep thriving in his demanding career, he must find genuine enjoyment in the journey. Without that sense of fun, he wonders what the point is. His enigmatic words, which rippled with hints of early retirement, were: “If I wanna keep doing this, I have to have fun doing it… I’ve been through a lot… If it’s not fun, then what am I doing it for?”Burrow stunned fans by returning from a Grade 3 toe turf injury two months ahead of the recovery timeline, defying the odds and expectations. He stormed back onto the gridiron on Thanksgiving Day, leading his team to an effortless 32-14 victory over the Baltimore Ravens, fueled by sheer determination. Yet, the celebration was short-lived as the Buffalo Bills edged them out in a suspenseful thriller, 39-34. Now, with playoff hopes on thin ice and only a 1-3% chance of advancing, the future looks grim for the Bengals.The devastating Week 14 defeat to the Bills dropped their regular season record to 4-9, leaving them third in the AFC North and 12th in the conference.With so many setbacks, it’s easy to imagine Burrow questioning his path forward, perhaps explaining his mysterious hint at early retirement at his recent press conference.“How did the injury change the way you view the game?”“No, it certainly doesn’t change my desire to win. If I wanna keep doing this, I have to have fun doing it… I’ve been through a lot… If it’s not fun, then what am I doing it for? That’s the mindset I’m trying to bring to the table.”“Is it difficult to have fun given the season, what you’ve been through physically, emotionally, all of it? Is it tough?”“Yeah, certainly.”“How much of it was fun before? Winning is always fun, but in general, was it fun before you got hurt? Did you view it that way at least?”“No, I wouldn’t say I viewed it that way.”“What was the changing point?”“I’m not sure if there’s a singular moment or a time. It’s just a reflection on a lot of things that I’ve done and been through in my career. I’ve been through more than most and certainly not easy on the brain or the body, so just trying to have fun doing it.”","Joe burrow sparks speculation about an early nfl departure after dropping a mysterious hint at his latest press meeting. “if i wanna keep doing this, i have to have fun doing it… i’ve been through a lot… if it’s not fun, then what am i doing it for?”","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125910944,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-62994,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"
Subriel Matias cleared despite a positive Ostarine test as WBC super lightweight title fight with Dalton Smith stays on,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/international-sports/subriel-matias-cleared-despite-a-positive-ostarine-test-as-wbc-super-lightweight-title-fight-with-dalton-smith-stays-on/articleshow/125909689.cms,"Subriel Matias (via Getty Images)

Subriel Matias proven innocent as the B-sample confirms ostarine levels under permissible limits



Subriel Matias will still defend his WBC super lightweight title against Dalton Smith on January 10, even after testing positive for Ostarine. The fight was first announced earlier this year and was scheduled to take place at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn. But everything changed when Matias returned a positive VADA test on November 9. Notably, Ostarine is a banned substance known for increasing testosterone levels and boosting endurance. It was the same drug found in Ryan Garcia’s system that earned him a one-year suspension. Yet Matias’ case took a very different turn.Despite the positive result, he was not suspended. Reports now say his B-sample has also come back positive. Still, he is safe to compete. Boxing journalist Dan Rafael reported the update on X and confirmed that the levels found were below the punishment threshold in New York. With the fight staying on the schedule, Matias is now set to move forward with his title defense against the unbeaten star Dalton Smith.Subriel Matias’ drug test case became a major talking point in boxing, especially because most fighters must prove their innocence even when contamination is suspected.Dan Rafael revealed the latest update earlier today. He wrote on X, “Per multiple sources with direct knowledge of the test results, Subriel Matias’ B sample was also positive for Ostarine,” he posted. “But was, as expected & how it should be, the same as his A below the 0.1 ng per milliliter threshold for punishment in NY, so [the] Smith fight remains on.”Earlier reports noted that Matias would be placed on a one-year probation and must pay for additional testing before fight night. The WBC had already backed him before the B-sample was tested. WBC President Mauricio Sulaiman said they believed the result came from contaminated supplements used during training.“He is not guilty; he has not been found at any level of consuming performance-enhancing drugs,” Sulaiman had stated.Sulaiman also said their Clean Boxing Program needs updating because many supplements contain banned traces.Meanwhile, the pre-weigh-in numbers for the fight are also confirmed. Matias came in at 153.8 pounds, while Smith weighed 155.6 pounds.Both fighters will now gear up for the ultimate fight. Despite setbacks, the road is now clear for Matias to defend his world title on January 10.Also Read: “You turned gay"" - UFC legend Nate Diaz brutally trolls Ryan Garcia for wanting to train under Khabib Nurmagomedov",Subriel matias tested positive for banned substance ostarine on november 9.

What Gronkowski actually said about returning to the NFL

“I’d need a solid bonus, and the schedule has to work with my life,”

Rob Gronkowski, one of the NFL ’s most electrifying tight ends, just gave fans the ultimate tease. While he’s been retired for a few years, Gronk floated a playful idea of how to lure him back to the field. At 36, Gronk isn’t committing to a return but his humor, charm, and legendary status make this “what if” scenario irresistible for NFL fans everywhere.During a recent interview, Gronkowski shared the very specific conditions under which he might consider unretiring. He joked that he would only practice Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, and that a $1 million bonus would be essential to make the deal worthwhile. True to his playful personality, Gronk also estimated the chance of this happening at just 1 percent, signaling that this is more a fun thought experiment than a real plan.Gronk said, keeping fans guessing but entertained. While he’s clearly not rushing back, the scenario alone sparked excitement across social media.Naturally, the internet went wild. Imagining Gronk in full gear on a practice squad kept fans joking about him only showing up for three days a week, reactions were instant. Some users celebrated the idea of his infectious energy returning to NFL practices, while others pointed out that Gronk’s legendary partying and personality might clash with a structured team schedule.Even those who doubt a real comeback are enjoying the fantasy of seeing him back in action. After all, few players have been as fun and memorable on and off the field as Gronk.Despite the buzz, a return seems extremely improbable. At 36 years old and after multiple seasons of retirement, Gronk would face physical challenges and lifestyle adjustments. No NFL team has officially expressed interest, and his playful terms, limited practice days and a hefty bonus aren’t typical for active roster spots.History does show that players sometimes stage surprising comebacks (think Brett Favre or Michael Jordan ), but Gronk’s scenario remains more of a fan fantasy than a likely reality.Even as a joke, Gronkowski’s hypothetical return illustrates his lasting influence on both football and pop culture. His larger-than-life personality, marketing appeal, and connection with fans keep him relevant long after his retirement. Whether on the field or in the media, Gronk is a figure who can make headlines with just a tease.Also read - Sherrone Moore’s firing triggers Shannon Sharpe’s reflection on his own lawsuit involving an OnlyFans model","Rob gronkowski, one of the nfl’s most electrifying tight ends, just gave fans the ultimate tease.

Philip Rivers comeback reaction from Aaron Rodgers



The NFL woke up this week to something few expected to see again. Philip Rivers, freshly 44 and four seasons removed from his last snap, suddenly appeared back in the Indianapolis Colts building. The news moved fast, and it stirred reactions that ranged from shock to pure delight. Among those caught off guard was Mike Tomlin, who kept his focus locked on the Miami Dolphins. He brushed off any deeper discussion with a simple line. “That’s none of my business. I’m trying to be ready for the Dolphins.” Aaron Rodgers , however, welcomed the topic with a smile. The Steelers quarterback, who celebrated his 42nd birthday earlier this month, treated the moment with humor. “Well, I’m not the oldest guy in the league. Love that,” he said, clearly amused by Rivers’ return. It became one of the lighter moments in a tense playoff stretch.Rodgers did not stop at jokes. He laid out what made Rivers’ return so astonishing. “It’s pretty incredible though. He’s been out for I believe four full seasons, plus part of this season,” Rodgers said. He added that his friends immediately asked what he would do in the same situation.His answer was honest and quick. “I said, without missing a beat, ‘I’m retired. I’m staying retired.’”For Rodgers, the respect runs deep. He praised Rivers in a way that felt personal. “Big credit to Phil. I’ve been a fan of his forever,” he said. Rodgers admired the way Rivers competed and carried himself, calling him “not the most gifted player” but “cerebral as all get out.” He also pointed out what fans always loved about Rivers, describing him as a “hilarious trash talker,” and ended by wishing him “nothing but the best. ”Rivers now joins a very small group of active players aged 40 or older, which includes Rodgers, Marcades Lewis, Matt Prater, Nick Folk and Joe Flacco. If Rivers starts this week, he will line up against the Seattle Seahawks, an almost surreal twist after years away from the huddle.Meanwhile, Rodgers continues to show he can guide Pittsburgh through pressure moments. His recent performance in the Steelers’ 27-22 win over the Ravens included his first rushing touchdown in three years. He even brought back the discount double check celebration, a reminder that he can still find joy in the grind.With a one game AFC North lead and Miami up next, Rodgers is focused on the present.

Suryakumar Yadav Press Conference: on Sanju, Dube & India’s T20 Gameplan for South Africa

#arshdeepsingh #viratkohli #indiancricket

NEW DELHI: India pacer Arshdeep Singh has emerged as much a digital entertainer as a match-winning bowler — and now he has revealed the surprising moment that pushed him into creating his wildly popular YouTube content. Speaking on JioHotstar, the left-arm quick said the idea struck him during one of the most frustrating phases of his career: when he was dropped from India's Playing XI for the opening match of the Champions Trophy 2025 in Dubai.India had opted for a spin-heavy combination throughout the tournament, leaving Arshdeep on the bench. But instead of sulking, he turned the setback into an opportunity. “When I got to know that I wouldn't be playing in the first game of the Champions Trophy, I was very bored in my room — and that's when I started my YouTube channel. It turned out to be a blessing in disguise,” he said.Arshdeep explained that he tries to find positivity even in disappointment. “Sometimes you just have to be grateful that you are playing at this level. You also have to wait for your chances, and when you get an opportunity, make sure you make the most of it,” he added.His fun, self-deprecating humour quickly resonated with fans, none more so than his recent viral reel with Virat Kohli, which has already crossed 1.3 million views. The banter came after Kohli missed a third straight ODI century in the series decider against South Africa in Visakhapatnam, where he finished unbeaten on 65 as India chased 271 with ease.Arshdeep, sensing content gold, joked to Kohli: “Paaji, run kam reh gaye… century aaj pakki thi waise.”Kohli's response was instant and hilarious: “Toss jeet gaye, nahi toh teri bhi pakki thi dew mein.”With India's bowlers having struggled under heavy dew in the earlier games in Ranchi and Raipur, Kohli's quip left the all in splits — and gave Arshdeep yet another viral moment.","Arshdeep singh was dropped from india's playing xi for the opening match of the champions trophy 2025 in dubai.

Taylor Swift’s etiquette reaction on Colbert becomes the moment everyone is replaying

Taylor Swift explains why the Travis Kelce engagement still feels unreal despite public obsession

Taylor Swift’s engagement to Travis Kelce has been dissected for over a year, but the most unexpected moment finally arrived on “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.” Taylor Swift spoke openly about how unreal the Travis Kelce engagement still feels to her and then delivered the line that instantly took over social media: “Everyone has been so rude. ” What was meant to be a quick etiquette correction became the internet’s favorite clip.This appearance was part of Taylor Swift’s promo push for her Eras Tour docuseries. Instead, she ended up walking viewers into a rare look at why getting engaged to Travis Kelce still feels impossible to her, why she never assumed it would happen and why this year changed the trajectory of her life and career.Taylor Swift was listing three people she trusts most when Stephen Colbert stepped in to congratulate her on the Travis Kelce engagement. He then paused and corrected himself, reminding her of an etiquette rule she had never heard.He told Taylor Swift that tradition requires “best wishes” for the bride and “congratulations” for the groom. She stared at him and answered with the line that exploded online: “I never heard that until right now. Everyone has been so rude.”Stephen Colbert explained the reasoning. The man gets congratulations for securing the relationship.The woman gets best wishes because marriage was assumed. Taylor Swift processed the logic and said she loved learning something so oddly specific. She even told him she would come to him for wedding advice, and she meant it.Stephen Colbert highlighted her viral Instagram announcement next. He read her caption out loud, pointed to the framed photo on his desk and called the post a fan favorite. The moment also reminded viewers of how massive this year has been for her. Taylor Swift dropped a new album, “The Life of a Showgirl,” released a docuseries and regained her masters. She agreed with Stephen Colbert when he said she had a “good year. ” She knew exactly what he meant.Once the laughter passed, Taylor Swift spoke about the part of the Travis Kelce engagement fans rarely hear. She said two major events this year always felt out of reach: getting her music rights back and getting engaged to Travis Kelce.“Like getting engaged to the love of my life, getting all my music back. Those were two things that just never could have happened. They could’ve just never happened. It wasn’t like, ‘Oh, it’s just a matter of time.’”Taylor Swift repeated the point because it matters to her. She never assumed either milestone was guaranteed. She said both could have missed her completely, and her gratitude was obvious.Earlier in the interview, she named Travis Kelce alongside Stevie Nicks and Max Martin when talking about the people she trusts for long-term advice. She told Stephen Colbert she can talk to Travis Kelce about everything from her career to her personal life. The audience reaction made it clear the relationship has reached a different level publicly.This adds context to the moment she described on “The Tonight Show.” She told Jimmy Fallon how much effort Travis Kelce put into his proposal and how long he held onto the custom cushion-cut ring before giving it to her. She admitted she still catches herself staring at it.“I look at it constantly. It does not feel in any way normal for me. I am just like, oh man, whoa.”Then she explained why it means more than the ring itself.“He is just my favorite person I have ever met. The fact that this is the person that I get to hang out with every day forever is just like, that is the whole thing.”Taylor Swift may have gone viral for a joke, but her interviews over the past few months tell a different story. She is stunned by the timing of the Travis Kelce engagement. She is still adjusting to the scale of her year. She is grateful because none of it felt guaranteed.Her line about everyone being rude might be the meme, but the truth beneath it is simple.

U-19 Asia Cup press conference: What Ayush Mhatre said before the tournament

A good performance in the Syed Mustaq Ali Trophy (SMAT), in which he is the leading wicket-taker, has boosted Rajasthan pacer Ashok Sharma’s IPL auction chances. The 23-year old leads the bowling charts with 19 wickets from seven league games at an economy rate of 8.84, including two four-wicket hauls. Dale Steyn admirer, Ashok was a net bowler for Royals in 2021, 2023 and 2024. Kolkata signed him for Rs 55 lakh in 2022 and ahead of IPL-2025, Royals brought him into the fold for Rs 30 lakh. He is yet to make his IPL debut.“When I was with KKR in 2022, Pat Cummins told me to stay disciplined and keep backing the hard lengths because that’s my strength,” Ashok said.Three days ago, riding this rich vein of form, Ashok dashed off from Pune, where Rajasthan are playing the SMAT Super League games, to Mumbai to attend trials for Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB). With the IPL mini auction looming, the in form seamer looks certain to be a wanted man.During his stint with Rajasthan Royals later on, Shane Bond pushed him further. “Bond said I must mix in bouncers, yorkers and slower balls so the batsman is never settled,” he added.The variations are showing results too. “Most wickets have still come from hard lengths, but I’ve worked hard on the yorker especially, it’s fetched me a few key scalps,” said the Jaipur pacer who regularly clocks 140kph.Three days ago, riding this rich vein of form, Ashok dashed from Pune, where Rajasthan are playing SMAT Super League games, to Mumbai to attend trials for Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB). With the IPL mini auction looming, the in-form seamer looks certain to be a wanted man.From small beginnings, the journey has been swift for Ashok. His family wasn’t financially well off and Ashok, inspired by his elder brother, took to cricket. Their father, a farmer, was unable to fund coaching for both sons, so the elder brother sacrificed his dreams. At 17, Ashok joined an academy in Jaipur.Strong performances earned him a place in the U-23 Rest of India side, a trip to a high-performance camp at the Centre of Excellence and finally a Ranji Trophy debut this season.The maximum speed he has touched is 149kph against Punjab in an U-23 Rest of India game, according to his coach Jagsimran Singh. “The main reason behind Ashok’s success is his speed and accuracy. We worked on him with help of biomechanics,” he said.","Rajasthan pacer ashok sharma is the leading wicket-taker in the syed mustaq ali trophy (smat) the 23-year-old leads the bowling charts with 19 wickets from seven league games at an economy rate of 8.84, including two four-wicket hauls.

NEW DELHI: India’s crushing 51-run loss to South Africa in Mullanpur on Thursday did not just level the five-match series 1-1 — it also underlined an uncomfortable statistical reality. This was India’s 13th T20I defeat to South Africa in 33 matches, the most losses they have suffered against any opposition in the format. Australia and England follow with 12 each, but the Proteas now stand alone atop a list India would rather avoid.South Africa’s domination added another layer of statistical significance. Their pacers produced a rare, ruthless performance to dismiss India entirely with pace, marking the first time South African fast bowlers have taken all ten wickets in a T20I innings. India’s collapse — all ten wickets falling to pace — is also their worst such outing in T20Is, surpassing previous lows against the West Indies (nine wickets lost to pace in 2022) and Pakistan (nine in 2024).The numbers around India’s failed chase were equally damning. Set 214 after Quinton de Kock’s blazing 90 (46 balls), India folded for 162 in 19.1 overs. The defeat reaffirmed a long-standing hurdle: India have never successfully chased a 210-plus target in T20Is.Their record now reads: seven attempts, seven defeats.The 51-run margin also enters India’s list of biggest defeats by runs in T20Is — second only to the 80-run hammering by New Zealand in Wellington (2019). It also joins heavy losses against Australia (49 runs, 2010), South Africa (49, 2022) and New Zealand (47, 2016).South Africa’s response to their 74-all-out embarrassment in Cuttack was emphatic. De Kock led the revival with seven sixes, while Donovan Ferreira’s 30 off 16 powered a 49-run burst in the final three overs. Ottneil Baartman, one of three changes, sealed the win with a superb 4 for 24.India’s chase never took flight. Shubman Gill fell in the first over, Abhishek Sharma sparkled briefly, and captain Suryakumar Yadav’s struggles continued. Tilak Varma’s 62 (34 balls) was the lone resistance, but even he could not prevent India from suffering their first T20I defeat in 14 matches with both Jasprit Bumrah and Arshdeep Singh in the XI.The series now moves to Dharamsala for the third T20I on Sunday, with India seeking answers — and redemption — before the T20 World Cup at home in February.",South africa beat india by 51 runs to level five-match series 1-1.
