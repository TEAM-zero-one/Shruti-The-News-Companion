Awkward, cringeworthy handshake between Anastasia Shubskaya and Gary Bettman

One of the most compelling narratives in the NHL right now is Alex Ovechkin’s pursuit of Wayne Gretzky’s all-time goal record. On Wednesday night, despite the Washington Capitals falling 5-1 to the Carolina Hurricanes, Ovechkin was the lone bright spot for his team. The 39-year-old sniper unleashed a powerful shot from the high slot in the second period, beating goaltender Frederik Andersen and notching the 892nd goal of his storied career.

NEW DELHI: Tensions boiled over after Pakistan’s crushing 3-0 ODI series loss to New Zealand, as all-rounder Khushdil Shah was involved in a heated exchange with two Afghan spectators at Bay Oval on Saturday.The confrontation unfolded shortly after the match concluded, adding an unpleasant twist to an already disappointing day for the visitors.According to the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), Khushdil was subjected to verbal abuse from individuals in the stands who reportedly hurled anti-Pakistan slogans and inappropriate language.In a statement, the PCB said, ""The Pakistan cricket team management has strongly condemned the abusive language directed at national players by foreign spectators. During the match today, foreign spectators hurled inappropriate remarks at cricketers present on the field.""Also See: RR vs PBKS Live Score, IPL 2025 “When anti-Pakistan slogans emerged, cricketer Khushdil Shah stepped in and urged the spectators to refrain. In response, Afghan spectators escalated the situation by using further inappropriate language in Pashto. Following the Pakistani team's complaint, stadium officials intervened and ejected the two disruptive spectators,” it added.Eyewitness videos circulating on social media showed Khushdil reacting emotionally, appearing to move toward the crowd before being held back by team officials.The incident comes amid an already turbulent tour for Pakistan, who were outclassed in all formats.In the final ODI, Pakistan fell 43 runs short of New Zealand’s 264-8 in a rain-shortened 42-over game.Once again, their batting crumbled under pressure despite a solid start, with Babar Azam (50), Abdullah Shafique (33), and Mohammad Rizwan (37) showing some resistance.Ben Sears continued his sensational run, claiming 5/34 to become the first New Zealander to take back-to-back five-wicket hauls in ODIs.He was ably supported by Jacob Duffy (2/40), who claimed the crucial wicket of Rizwan.Khushdil’s on-field performance was overshadowed by the post-match drama, but the PCB’s swift action and strong stance against spectator misconduct underscore the need for maintaining respect and decorum in international cricket arenas.ALSO READ: Lights out!

SRH vs GT IPL 2025, Hyderabad weather prediction

Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) face Gujarat Titans (GT) at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Hyderabad today, desperate to halt a three-match losing streak.Despite an explosive 286-run start to the IPL season, SRH’s all-out attacking approach has backfired, with scores of 190, 163, and 120 in the subsequent games.Their batting stars, including Travis Head, Ishan Kishan, and Heinrich Klaasen, have failed to deliver consistently, and the bowling unit — led by skipper Pat Cummins — has struggled, with high economy rates and no bowler completing four overs in every match.Currently at the bottom of the points table, SRH risk slipping out of playoff contention.In contrast, the Gujarat Titans are gaining momentum, buoyed by a big win over RCB. With a strong top order of Gill, Sudharsan and Buttler, and finishers like Rutherford and Tewatia, they look balanced.While Rabada’s absence is a blow, options like Coetzee or Phillips could fill the gap. Titans also boast a more disciplined bowling attack, giving them an edge.Hyderabad’s red soil pitch promises bounce and carry, but it slows as the ball ages. Despite average boundaries (69m, 67m, 79m), on average 24 sixes are hit per game. It’s a dry, grassless, firm surface. Batting first is ideal, as past matches saw 200+ totals in all innings.Travis Head, Abhishek Sharma, Ishan Kishan, Nitish Kumar Reddy, Heinrich Klaasen (wk), Aniket Verma, Abhinav Manohar, Pat Cummins (c), Simarjeet Singh, Harshal Patel, Mohammed Shami– Zeeshan Ansari/Adam ZampaSai Sudharsan, Shubman Gill (c), Jos Buttler (wk), Shahrukh Khan, Rahul Tewatia, Arshad Khan, Rashid Khan, Ravisrinivasan Sai Kishore, Mohammed Siraj, Prasidh Krishna, Ishant Sharma– Sherfane Rutherford/Washington SundarPat Cummins (c), Ishan Kishan (wk), Atharva Taide, Abhinav Manohar, Aniket Verma, Sachin Baby, Heinrich Klaasen, Travis Head, Harshal Patel, Kamindu Mendis, Wiaan Mulder, Abhishek Sharma, Nitish Kumar Reddy, Mohammed Shami, Rahul Chahar, Adam Zampa, Simarjeet Singh, Zeeshan Ansari, Jaydev Unadkat and Eshan Malinga.Shubman Gill (C), Jos Buttler, B.

PBKS vs RR IPL 2025, Mullanpur weather prediction

A year ago, the Punjab Kings (PBKS) faced significant challenges, including confusion over Shashank Singh’s status, Shikhar Dhawan's poor performance, and a disappointing ninth-place finish with only five wins, marking their tenth consecutive year without a playoff appearance.Currently, there’s a sense of calm surrounding the team. Under the leadership of Ricky Ponting and Shreyas Iyer, they have kicked off IPL 2025 with two away victories and aim to improve their home record.In IPL 2024, PBKS managed just one win from five games at Mullanpur, but this year’s squad boasts impressive depth that makes them a formidable contender. While Glenn Maxwell, Marcus Stoinis, and Marco Jansen are all strong batters, the top order has performed so well that their contributions have seldom been necessary.On the other hand, the Rajasthan Royals (RR) are dealing with multiple challenges, starting with Yashasvi Jaiswal's sluggish start and questions about their batting depth. To address this, they have been flexible with their lineup, which was evident in their recent win over CSK, thanks to a standout performance from Nitish Rana that capped off their stint in Guwahati.Going by history, don't expect big scores between PBKS and RR in Mullanpur.

Inside Jordon Hudson’s 24th birthday bash and how she’s honoring Bill Belichick’s latest coaching move



Jordon Hudson ’s 24th birthday wasn’t just about cakes and candles—it became a heartfelt celebration of love, loyalty, and life’s unexpected journeys. The former college cheerleader and current partner of legendary NFL coach Bill Belichick used her special day to offer a unique tribute to the man who has stood beside her despite the headlines, criticism, and their 48-year age gap.On April 4, Jordon Hudson took to Instagram to showcase a thoughtful snapshot: a bouquet of red roses and a University of North Carolina basketball jersey with “Jordon” emblazoned above the number 24. It wasn’t just a birthday nod—it was a clever homage to her own age and Michael Jordan’s college legacy, all while acknowledging Belichick’s new beginning with the Tar Heels. The jersey symbolized more than a gift—it marked her deep-rooted support for Belichick as he transitions into his first-ever college football coaching role.It’s not the first time Hudson has publicly backed her partner. After facing online scrutiny over their relationship, she shared a bold message on Instagram in December 2024: ""Nothing changed for us in 2024 except for 'public knowledge': yet somehow everything changed. Going strong. I can't wait to take punches for you in 2025. Keep swinging, Keyboard Warriors. Your illusion of righteousness only fuels my authenticity."" Her statement echoed the kind of emotional resilience that often keeps high-profile relationships afloat.The pair's journey began in an unlikely setting—on a flight to Florida in February 2021. Hudson, then a college student with a passion for philosophy, had Belichick sign her “Deductive Logic” textbook. He penned a note that read, “Thanks for giving me a course on logic! Safe travels! Bill Belichick,” complete with Super Bowl win numbers. That simple exchange bloomed into a connection that, despite public skepticism, has only grown stronger.In February 2025, Hudson commemorated their four-year “meetiversary” with a post saying, “Happy Meetiversary @billbelichick — Cheers 🥂 to the fact that you still let me give you lengthy philosophical lectures four years later.” A slideshow accompanied the caption, featuring a touching photo of the couple holding hands during Super Bowl week in New Orleans.Her recent birthday post also included a stylish red beaded handbag by STAUD, inspired by the Year of the Snake—a nod to Hudson’s creative side. Fans have often seen glimpses of her DIY flair, whether it’s bedazzling a UNC sweatshirt or crafting a rhinestone lobster purse to raise awareness for Maine fishermen.While Belichick is gearing up for his new role at UNC, their life together continues to reflect a delicate balance between legacy and love. From philosophical musings to beachside antics—like the viral ""Billates"" workout where Hudson was seen balanced on Belichick’s feet—the couple is redefining what it means to navigate fame and age differences with grace, humor, and authenticity.Also Read: Aaron Rodgers left more than memories for Olivia Munn — a haunting truth she can’t shake Their story proves that sometimes, love takes off in the most unexpected places—like 30,000 feet in the air—and lands in a partnership that neither logic nor judgment can define.","Jordon hudson celebrated her 24th birthday with a thoughtful tribute to bill belichick.

A rainy race day on the cards at the Japanese Grand Prix

After Australia, another wet and wild race is on the cards at the Japanese Grand Prix on Sunday. Red Bull’s Max Verstappen secured pole position on Saturday, setting the stage for the final race at Suzuka. According to the weather forecast, there are chances of rain during the race, which has made his fans even more confident about his victory. However, it's difficult to predict what will happen at the Suzuka Circuit , as it’s not just Verstappen in the race—McLaren’s Lando Norris is also a strong contender and is high on confidence after winning the rain-affected race in Melbourne.The race will start at 2 p.m. local time. It will take place over 53 laps of the 5.807-kilometre Suzuka Circuit and is expected to last around 2 hours.According to the weather forecast shared by the FIA, showers are likely in the morning, which could dampen the dry grass. The temperature is expected to be higher than on the first two days, hovering around 17 degrees Celsius. After the morning showers, it may become a bit cloudy, with slightly reduced chances of rain during the race. However, the timing of the rain is unpredictable, and track conditions could fluctuate between wet and dry throughout the day.The storm and rain in Australia had overturned race strategies for many, resulting in multiple incidents and crashes on the wet track. In Japan, there's more to worry about than just the track. The frequent grass fires during practice sessions and qualifying race left drivers frustrated due to multiple red flags and the loss of precious time. Drivers may lose sleep over the weather prediction for Sunday, but many Formula 1 fans are expecting a more unpredictable and exciting race.As the official X (formerly Twitter) handle of Formula 1 asked the fans, “Anyone packed an umbrella?” many expressed their desire to see a wet race. One fan tweeted, “That would make things interesting.” Another wrote, “I would actually like to see a wet race. More chances to see Max coming out on top.” “Oh, exciting... Australia repeat?” asked a fan. One fan also said sarcastically, “At least the grass won’t burn.” Another comment read, “What’s with F1 scheduling races on every rainy weekend? Get it together, FIA.”Also Read: Grass Fires at the Japanese Grand Prix: Causes, concerns and why current efforts aren't enough Many, including Lewis Hamilton and Oscar Piastri, struggled in the rain-hit season opener in Melbourne.

Gully To Glory: Ramandeep Singh's journey from Chandigarh to Team India via KKR

NEW DELHI: Around five years back, the Delhi and District Cricket Association (DDCA) organised open nets for its Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy (SMAT) probables at a Delhi University (DU) college ground. Among the hundreds who had assembled was a young Digvesh Singh Rathi who got a chance to bowl after observing action from the sidelines.The batters, featuring plenty of Indian Premier League ( IPL ) regulars, were hitting the ball out of the small North Campus ground, and one of Rathi's deliveries received similar treatment. Without a ball to continue, he walked up to a member of the coaching staff and requested for a replacement, only to be asked to stand in a corner.Also See: IPL Live Score, RR vs PBKS His trial was done. He never got an opportunity to bowl again and didn't feature in the shortlist which was released.Rejection was not new, but the lesson learnt that afternoon changed his bowling and life for good. Not conceding a six became his new obsession, and with no state-level opportunities coming his way, the highly competitive club and corporate fixtures in Delhi-NCR were the only games he looked forward to. Even in those matches, where he was paid for an appearance, not conceding runs remained his motto to keep getting regular games and match fees.""Run lagte hai to bulate nahi hai ye dubara, isi liye kheech ke daalta hu (If I get hit for runs, they don't call again. That's why I bowl tight),"" Rathi would say whenever he was asked about his bowling.A bowler who modelled his game by watching Sunil Narine , Rathi began as the usual off-spinner who bowled a menacing carrom ball in his early days. The art of hiding the ball was picked up by watching Narine, and while it gave him control and kept the economy rate in check, the wickets column didn't have substantial contributions. He identified it as something to be worked on after attending trials for Delhi Capitals and Mumbai Indians, and a plan was prepared.After watching hours of Wanindu Hasranga footage on his phone, Rathi figured out that a googly was needed. He worked on it and finally cracked a delivery which turns differently, and more than his carrom. His regular celebration, before the notebook gesture went viral, was inspired by the Sri Lankan spinner and completed his bowling package.Rathi has played nearly 300 local games, had a stint with Delhi Capitals as a net bowler, played for Delhi U-25 in the 2022-23 season, but the magical paddle went up only at the IPL mega auction in 2024 when Lucknow Super Giants secured him for Rs 30 lakh.Part of the Delhi Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy squad that season, thanks to his exceptional bowling in the Delhi Premier League where he was the find of the season with 14 scalps from 10 games, the 25-year-old watched the auction from his hotel room and was a relieved man. ""IPL khelna hai... ,"" was something he would say often but was lost for words when his phone started buzzing after the bid.Just like his bowling, his cricketing journey has been anything but conventional. The payouts from local games, appearances for Delhi U-25 and net bowler stint allowed him to upgrade his two-wheeler to a Royal Enfield Bullet but the drive to challenge himself in different T20 games only increased.For those who have watched him from a young age, it doesn't come as a surprise that he has conceded just three sixes in four IPL games. All those sixes came against a marauding Sunrisers Hyderabad.He had learnt his lesson during those trials back in the day, and it was his life challenges and the obsession to play the IPL which shaped the bowler he is now.For a bowler who was picked as a backup for Ravi Bishnoi and M Siddharth, Rathi has stormed into a leading role for the Rishabh Pant-led unit and has become the toast of the nation for his celebrations and ice-cool temperament in pressure situations.","Digvesh singh rathi is a bowler who modelled his game by watching sunil narine.

IPL: Fleming admits batting woes after CSK's third straight defeat

NEW DELHI: Chennai Super Kings head coach Stephen Fleming has brushed aside retirement speculation surrounding MS Dhoni, stating that it’s not his role to end the legendary cricketer’s IPL career. The chatter gained momentum after Dhoni’s parents were spotted at the MA Chidambaram Stadium during CSK’s 25-run defeat to Delhi Capitals on Saturday — their third straight loss in IPL 2025 .“No, that’s not my role to put an end to it. I have no idea. I’m just enjoying working with him. He’s still going strong,” Fleming said at the post-match press conference. “I don’t even ask these days. You guys are the ones that ask.”Dhoni walked in at No. 7 with CSK reeling at 74/5 in the 11th over, but could only manage a 26-ball 30 not out , struggling to find momentum on a slowing pitch. Fleming defended the move, saying it wasn’t a damage-control tactic, but a reflection of tough batting conditions in the second half.“When he went out, the ball started to grip more. Vijay [Shankar] struggled throughout. That 12-16 over period was just very hard to bat. The game was slipping, and even with intent, it was just too much,” he added.On CSK’s continued inconsistency, Fleming stressed the need for more from the top order. “We need more production from the top three or four. That allows power hitters to come in at the right time. Right now, we’re having to introduce players at the wrong moments.”Despite the growing scrutiny, Fleming reaffirmed faith in Dhoni and the team's process.",Csk lost 25-run to delhi capitals in the ipl on saturday.

NEW DELHI: Chennai Super Kings ' lack of urgency in a tricky chase cost them dearly as they slumped to a 25-run defeat against Delhi Capitals in their Indian Premier League 2025 clash at the MA Chidambaram Stadium on Saturday.Chasing 184, CSK were reeling at 74/5 in 10.4 overs when MS Dhoni walked in — his earliest entry in a full 20-over match since 2023. With 110 needed off 56 balls, he joined Vijay Shankar , who was on 24 off 23. The stage was set for a counterattack, but what followed was a sluggish and baffling passage of play.Despite their reputation as big-hitters, Dhoni and Shankar crawled to just 32 runs in the next 4.2 overs. Shankar eventually brought up his fifty in the 17th over off 43 balls — the slowest half-century of the season.

Bombay Sport Exchange Ep. 2: GroupM's Vinit Karnik on IPL's growth and emerging sports

NEW DELHI: KL Rahul played a sublime knock under pressure to steer Delhi Capitals to their third straight victory in the Indian Premier League 2025, defeating Chennai Super Kings by 25 runs at the MA Chidambaram Stadium on Saturday. With this win, DC not only extended their unbeaten streak this season but also scripted their first win at Chepauk in 15 years.The foundation of Delhi’s 183/6 was built on Rahul’s elegant yet powerful 77 off 51 deliveries. Mixing finesse with brute force, the stylish right-hander struck six boundaries and three sixes, anchoring the innings masterfully. Despite a shaky start — losing Jake Fraser-McGurk early to Khaleel Ahmed — Delhi recovered through Abishek Porel’s brisk 33 off 20 and a steady middle-order partnership between Rahul and Sameer Rizvi (20).While Tristan Stubbs added a quickfire 24 not out at the end, Matheesha Pathirana’s tidy final over ensured CSK restricted DC from posting a bigger total.In reply, CSK stumbled early in their chase. Ruturaj Gaikwad, Rachin Ravindra and Devon Conway fell inside the powerplay, with Mitchell Starc, Mukesh Kumar and young spinner Vipraj Nigam (2/27) denting the top order. At 41/3, CSK were always chasing the game.Vijay Shankar fought hard with a well-made 69 not out, and MS Dhoni remained unbeaten on 30, but the asking rate kept climbing. With the pitch offering grip and Delhi’s bowlers maintaining discipline, Chennai managed only 158/5 in their 20 overs.Earlier, DC captain Axar Patel’s cameo (21 off 14) and his six off Jadeja hinted at a flourish, but he too fell after getting set. Rahul, meanwhile, held one end firmly and reached his 38th IPL fifty in style. His knock not only stabilised DC’s innings but also allowed others to play freely around him.With three wins in three games, Delhi Capitals look like early title contenders. For CSK, however, the loss marks a worrying trend, with questions looming over their inconsistent top order and inability to control games at home.",Delhi capitals beat chennai super kings by 25 runs at the ma chidambaram stadium.

Aaron Rodgers' NFL future hangs in the balance – And the Steelers may be left waiting



Wild Steelers Trade, Aaron Rodgers Decision | AST Call-In Show

As the NFL offseason rolls forward and the 2025 Draft looms closer, one name continues to dominate headlines—Aaron Rodgers. Despite his decorated career and four MVP awards, Rodgers remains unsigned, and all eyes are on what has become one of the league’s most compelling storylines. Among the teams reportedly most invested in his future are the Pittsburgh Steelers, who appear all-in on the 41-year-old quarterback. But with every day that passes, hope in Pittsburgh may be giving way to uncertainty.The Steelers, who lost both Russell Wilson and Justin Fields in free agency, have cleared the deck in their quarterback room—placing their faith firmly in Aaron Rodgers. Currently, only Mason Rudolph and Skylar Thompson remain on the roster, neither seen as a long-term solution. With the Steelers clearly banking on Rodgers to stabilize their offense, any hesitation from his camp could be detrimental.Owner and president Art Rooney II recently admitted, “We keep getting positive sort of signals about it. So yeah, I’d say we feel pretty good about it at this point.” Still, even he hinted that patience won’t be endless, stating Rodgers has “not forever, but a little while longer” to decide.But behind the scenes, conflicting opinions are surfacing. According to Pro Football Talk's Mike Florio, one “high-level” NFL executive offered a different take on Rodgers’ true intentions: “The opinion is he doesn’t really want to play for the Steelers, and he’s waiting for Minnesota.” Florio clarified, “It’s not a fact; it’s not a report. But it’s somebody who is in the ecosystem and isn’t a low-level employee.”This speculation adds a new twist. While the Minnesota Vikings had previously expressed interest, they appear to have committed to second-year quarterback J.J. McCarthy. Yet, the possibility remains that Rodgers is hoping for a last-minute opening in Minnesota’s quarterback room—leaving Pittsburgh as more of a fallback than a preferred destination.Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin , known for his calm demeanor, is reportedly giving Rodgers space and not imposing any hard deadlines. When asked about whether a deadline had been set, Tomlin responded, “Not to my knowledge. I don’t know that we’ve approached it from a deadline perspective.” Still, the absence of urgency doesn’t eliminate the pressure mounting within the organization.Interestingly, Rodgers had already visited the Steelers’ facility back in March and even held a throwing session with newly acquired wide receiver DK Metcalf. That interaction was viewed by many as a promising sign, one that suggested Rodgers was seriously weighing the move. But weeks later, no decision has been made—and silence often speaks volumes in the NFL.At 41, Rodgers holds all the cards. He can afford to wait, watch, and choose his next destination carefully—or even walk away from the game altogether. While retirement hasn’t been publicly discussed as a likely option, it still lingers in the realm of possibilities.Also Read: Could the Giants really draft both Travis Hunter and Shedeur Sanders in 2025? Mel Kiper Jr. believes so For Pittsburgh Steelers, the stakes are high. A missed opportunity with Rodgers could leave them scrambling with limited quarterback options and a fanbase left wondering what could have been. The longer this saga stretches on, the more it looks like the Steelers’ gamble could backfire—unless Aaron Rodgers finally breaks his silence in their favor.","Aaron rodgers remains unsigned despite his decorated career and four mvp awards.
