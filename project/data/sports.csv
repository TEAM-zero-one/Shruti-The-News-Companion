Maria Hanslovan’s fitness career, joint assets, and net worth of the duo





The brilliant career in Major League Baseball was the main factor that created the foundation of Andrew McCutchen’s finances. In 2005, the Pittsburgh Pirates called him up without delay, he threw at the peak of his superstar career, and later, he was awarded five All-Star titles and the National League MVP in 2013. Maria Hanslovan, McCutchen's wife, has set up her own fitness and wellness career which has been a steady income source for the couple and thus, has improved their financial stability.Through 16 seasons in the majors, McCutchen's total money earned from the MLB contracts was about $131.4 million. The highest salary he got was in 2012 when he agreed to a six-year, $51.5 million contract extension with the Pirates, thus making the player the franchise’s mainstay.Later transfers to the San Francisco Giants, Philadelphia Phillies, and Milwaukee Brewers accounted for even more millions, while his signing of a one-year $5 million contract renewal with the Pirates in 2025 is a testament to both his status as a veteran and his continuing worth to the team. Salaries, however, were not the only way, as he was also coming into the picture through endorsement deals by the likes of Nike and Marucci Sports, whose reputation he was in part making as a respected leader and role model.His public persona of being involved in philanthropy and community outreach, among other things, has made him more marketable and has thus provided him with the needed steady income streams even if he stops playing already.Formal fitness certifications play a minor role in Maria's career; the major part is the inspiration drawn from her personal story. Maria has made herself a confidante in the health and wellness area by sharing her training, eating habits, and playful family life. Her power is not restricted to the fitness world. She represents a person who supports McCutchen's cause and, at the same time, flourishes on her own.Collectively, Andrew McCutchen and Maria Hanslovan have $60-$65 million. Their wealth keeps rising from professional careers and joint assets alongside brand deals.

Kevin Stefanski — Cleveland Browns

Pete Carroll — Las Vegas Raiders

Jonathan Gannon — Arizona Cardinals

Raheem Morris — Atlanta Falcons





The NFL’s annual Black Monday shakeup is officially underway. Just hours after the regular season wrapped up, teams across the league began making major coaching decisions, signaling resets, rebuilds, and a long offseason of change ahead.With franchises eager to get a head start on the coaching carousel, several head coaches have already been dismissed with more moves potentially coming as ownership groups evaluate disappointing seasons. Here are the list of all coaches that got fired today:The Cleveland Browns fired head coach Kevin Stefanski after six seasons with the organization, ending a tenure that included both highs and prolonged frustration.Despite winning NFL Coach of the Year twice, Stefanski was dismissed following a 5–12 campaign and what team leadership viewed as a lack of sustained progress. Injuries, quarterback instability, and inconsistent results ultimately led the Browns to decide it was time for a new voice.The Las Vegas Raiders fired Pete Carroll after just one season at the helm, marking one of the most abrupt coaching exits of Black Monday.Carroll signed a three-year deal last year, but the experiment unraveled quickly. The Raiders finished 3–14, tied for the worst record in the NFL, prompting ownership to opt for a complete reset.With major questions remaining at quarterback and across the roster, Las Vegas will once again search for a head coach capable of leading a rebuild.The Arizona Cardinals parted ways with head coach Jonathan Gannon after three seasons, following another difficult year for the franchise.Arizona closed the 2025 season with a 3–14 record, extending a stretch of losing seasons and limited progress. Despite efforts to reshape the roster, results never materialized, leading the Cardinals to move in a different direction.The organization now turns its attention to finding a coach who can accelerate development and restore competitiveness.The Atlanta Falcons fired head coach Raheem Morris after back-to-back 8–9 seasons, missing the playoffs in both years.While Atlanta showed flashes of promise, the inability to break through in a competitive NFC ultimately led to Morris’ dismissal. Team leadership reportedly felt the roster was ready to compete at a higher level and required a new approach to reach that goal.Atlanta now joins the growing list of teams entering the coaching carousel.With multiple openings now available, the NFL coaching carousel is officially in motion. Teams will begin requesting interviews with coordinators on playoff staffs, evaluating former head coaches, and exploring college options as they look to make the right hire.More changes could still come in the days ahead as teams continue postseason evaluations.Also read - Fans accuse Cardi B of crossing a line after now-deleted tweet amid Stefon Diggs allegations",The cleveland browns fired head coach kevin stefanski after six seasons.

Why Jonathan Gannon was let go: Inside the Arizona Cardinals’ coaching change







The Arizona Cardinals have decided to part ways with head coach Jonathan Gannon after three seasons, signaling a major shift for the struggling franchise. Gannon took on his first NFL head coaching job with the Cardinals after a successful run as the Eagles’ defensive coordinator. He was supposed to develop great chemistry with quarterback Kyler Murray , but results fell short, with the Cardinals finishing the 2025 season at a disappointing 3-14. Arizona ’s management decided it was time for a fresh start. Although there was some improvement in 2024, Gannon’s three-year tenure left the Cardinals dead last in the NFC West and near the bottom of league rankings. Injuries, roster challenges, and coaching decisions have contributed to the team struggling over the course of their games.Gannon finishes his Arizona tenure with a combined 15-36 record, never reaching the playoffs. The first season in 2023 saw the end of the campaign with a 4-13 record. The following season in 2024 experienced a slight improvement with a close 8-9 season. However, the following season in 2025 experienced a season with three wins and a sharp decline that observed them losing their last nine matches consecutively after beginning with a season-opening win of 2-0.Gannon joined Arizona on February 14, 2023, in a move that came with controversy.The team was penalized for tampering during the hiring process, resulting in a swap of third-round draft picks with the Eagles and the loss of a 2024 fifth-round pick. Nevertheless, there were lofty hopes considering his success on defense for Philadelphia as well as his potential as a young coach.At 43, Gannon is still relatively young for the coaching ranks in the NFL. While his experience as a head coach was not that successful for the Cardinals, his experience as a defense specialist coach gives them a great reason to consider his services as a coordinator and also possibly bring him back as a head coach.The Cardinals are left with the task of hiring a coach to rebuild the roster, improve the consistency of the team’s play, and establish a long-term vision. The Cardinals’ hiring decision reflects the quick pace of the NFL, where teams must deliver results without delay.

From Bulls colors to college blue how Michael Jordan made sneakers carry legacy?



How Air Jordans became Michael Jordan’s timeless empire?







NBA legend Michael Jordan is often praised for what he did on the basketball court, but his impact goes far beyond championships and iconic on-court moments. Long after his retirement from the big league, Jordan built a business empire that is still looked upon by athletes across all sports. His success was not accidental, rather, it was the result of smart decisions Jordan made early in his career.NBA superstars today earn massive amounts of money through brand endorsements, but Michael Jordan changed the game by thinking like an owner, not just as the face for a brand. According to Rich Paul, founder of Klutch Sports and an agent to LeBron James, Jordan understood something many athletes didn’t at the time, that is, real power comes from royalties and long-term ownership.Speaking on the podcast, Game Over with Max Kellerman and Rich Paul, Paul explained why Michael Jordan’s approach stood apart from everyone else. While most players signed deals, Jordan focused on building something that would last beyond his playing career. He didn’t just promote products, he helped create them. Paul said in the interview about Michael Jordan that, “He built the business and he owned a part of it”.That mindset allowed Jordan to earn huge amounts of money, even decades later. According to Paul, the Air Jordan brand, owned by Michael Jordan, didn’t depend on him playing basketball, it stood on its own.Another key part of Michael Jordan’s financial success was his impressive storytelling. His shoes weren’t just sneakers, they carried meaning with them. The classic red, black, and white colors reflected the Chicago Bulls. Later, the Carolina blue paid tribute to his college days. Fans didn’t just buy shoes, they bought into a story that connected them with Jordan.Many active NBA stars have strong sneaker deals. Players like LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry, and Luka Doncic each earn millions through partnerships with some of the world's major brands. But Rich Paul made it clear that Jordan’s model, till today, stands above the rest.Michael Jordan didn’t rely on signing constant new deals. Rather, his brand became a business that could refresh itself by releasing new designs every now and then. So even after releasing 40 signature shoes, Air Jordans still sell out and dominate the sneaker culture worldwide. And that long-term vision is what separates Jordan from everyone else. He didn’t chase quick money. He built something that he knew could grow and survive without having the need for him to be in the spotlight every day.Also Read: Magic Johnson vs Michael Jordan net worth comparison: Exploring NBA veterans' career earnings, off-court ventures and more","Nba legend michael jordan is often praised for what he did on the basketball court, but his impact goes far beyond championships and iconic on-court moments.

Kevin Stefanski fired: Browns’ ongoing quarterback chaos leads to coaching change after 5-12 season,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/kevin-stefanski-fired-browns-ongoing-quarterback-chaos-leads-to-coaching-change-after-5-12-season/articleshow/126357932.cms,"Browns part ways with Kevin Stefanski amid quarterback struggles (Image via: Getty Images)

The Browns’ quarterback dilemma left Kevin Stefanski with few solutions







The Cleveland Browns’ decision to move on from Kevin Stefanski marks the end of a tenure shaped as much by promise as by persistent instability at quarterback. Since Baker Mayfield left after the 2021 season, the Browns have struggled to find a consistent quarterback, a challenge that marked the final years of Stefanski’s tenure.The breaking point came after a 5-12 finish in the 2025 NFL season, one of the worst records in the league. On Monday, the Browns confirmed Stefanski’s firing, thanking him for his work while making it clear that general manager Andrew Berry will remain in place to oversee the next phase of the rebuild.From the outset, last year felt like a transition year. The Browns expected their defense to keep them competitive, but the offense entered training camp without clarity under center. Cleveland carried four quarterbacks: veteran Joe Flacco, former Steelers first-rounder Kenny Pickett, and rookies Dillon Gabriel and Shedeur Sanders. Pickett was moved before the season, leaving Flacco as the Week 1 starter by default.Flacco struggled in four starts, throwing six interceptions against two touchdowns before being traded to the Cincinnati Bengals, where he revived his season. With Flacco gone, the Browns turned to Gabriel, whose play showed effort but little consistency.Stefanski’s reluctance to hand the offense to Sanders, despite the rookie’s draft-day slide and high profile, became a talking point as losses piled up.A concussion to Gabriel finally opened the door for Sanders. He flashed potential, most notably with a three-touchdown performance against the Titans, but wins never followed. With the season effectively lost, the organization decided a coaching change was necessary.Stefanski’s dismissal cannot be separated from the long shadow of the Deshaun Watson trade. Deshaun Watson’s $230 million fully guaranteed contract, combined with inconsistent play, left the Browns with few reliable options. Many seasons have passed, during which the Browns have had multiple backup QBs, which has made it tough for Stefanski on the offense.Despite these challenges, Stefanski guided the Browns to two playoff appearances, including an impressive 11-5 debut season and a surprise 2023 run boosted by Flacco’s late-season resurgence. His .440 winning percentage is certainly the best in the past several decades as a coach of the Cleveland Browns.As the Browns search for their next head coach, the franchise faces familiar questions. Cleveland must decide whether Gabriel or Sanders can become a long-term solution, and whether the next coach can finally bring stability where it has been missing for far too long.Also Read: Cam Newton claims ""Kevin Stefanski doesn't want Shedeur Sanders to succeed"" as his rough NFL debut sparks heated debate within Cleveland Browns","Cleveland browns part ways with head coach kevin stefanski.

LeBron James is the ultimate dual-threat



LeBron James’ 50,000-point longevity







Every Lakers' game with LeBron James feels like a brush with history, but Sunday night against Memphis Grizzlies, the air in the Crypto.com Arena just felt different. The 41-year-old hasn’t just been defying the stereotypes but also put up a veteran performance that took over the record books. In the second half with a clinical pass, LeBron James officially moved into 2nd place all-time in total assists (combining regular season and playoffs), passing Chris Paul.Combined with his existing throne as the NBA ’s all-time leading scorer, LeBron is now the first and only player in the history of the sport to be 1st in points and 2nd in assists. For those who have followed him since the Chosen One cover in 2002, this isn't just a stat, it's a reflection of greatness unfolding in real time.LeBron James is not filling space on the court. From rebounding, scoring, and assisting his teammates on the court to cheering from the courtside, James makes sure he’s there through and through. Scoring points requires a single focus on the rim, but assisting requires the opposite: an unselfish and eagle-eyed vision to know who’s where.During the Lakers' 120–114 victory, LeBron ran back and forth on the hardwood for 37 minutes and scored 26 points and 10 assists along with 7 rebounds, 2 three-pointers, and 6 field goals.With 10 assists, he brought his career total to 13,793 assists, Chris Paul. The only target who’s left on the list is now the legendary John Stockton at #1.This is LeBron’s 23rd NBA season, the first player to record such a long career on the rectangle, yet he doesn’t seem to be stopping. Guiding a roster filled with superstars like Luka Doncic and Austin Reeves, James is doing much more than player responsibilities.LeBron James officially surpassed the 50,000 total career points mark (regular season plus playoffs) in March 2025. He told Spectrum SportsNet in the on-court interview, ""It's a hell of a lot of points, and I'm super blessed to be able to put that many points up in the best league in the world with the best players in the world over my career. It's pretty special.""Every accolade and achievement makes sense when the King continues to show why he is the 21-time All-Star.

Bangladesh on Monday banned the broadcast of the upcoming Indian Premier League (IPL) season, citing the removal of pacer Mustafizur Rahman from the tournament. The decision followed instructions from the Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) to IPL franchise Kolkata Knight Riders to release the Bangladesh fast bowler from their 2026 squad.The IPL season is scheduled to begin on March 26.The ban came a day after Bangladesh decided not to travel to India for next month’s T20 World Cup and asked the International Cricket Council (ICC) to move all of its group matches to Sri Lanka, the tournament’s co-host.""It has come to attention that Mustafizur Rahman, a star player from Bangladesh, has been instructed to be dropped from the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) team for the Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket matches,"" the Bangladesh government said in an official statement.""No logical reason for such a decision (Rahman's release) by the BCCI is known, and such a decision has saddened, hurt, and aggrieved the people of Bangladesh,"" the notification said.""In this situation, until further notice, it is requested by order to stop the broadcasting/telecasting of all matches and programs of the Indian Premier League (IPL).

NEW DELHI: India were set a target of 246 after South Africa Under-19 were bowled out for 245, but the chase quickly became about one name. Vaibhav Sooryavanshi, leading the side, walked out to open and immediately took control, lighting up the contest with a breathtaking start.The 14-year-old tore into the bowling from the outset, racing to 68 off just 24 balls. His innings was built on clean, fearless hitting, with ten sixes and a four clearing the ropes with ease. Vaibhav brought up his half-century in just 19 deliveries, giving India Under-19 exactly the momentum they were looking for at the top of the order. He shared a 67-run opening stand with Aaron George, who made 20 before falling early in the chase.Earlier in the day, South Africa Under-19 had opted to bat first. Jorich van Schalkwyk and Adnaan Lagadien began the innings, contributing 10 and 25 respectively, but neither was able to convert their start. Captain Muhammed Bulbulia also failed to settle, departing for 14 as wickets fell at regular intervals.The visitors found stability through Jason Rowles, who played the standout innings of the first innings.Rowles scored a composed 114 from 113 balls, anchoring the batting effort when the side needed it most. He received some support from Daniel Bosman, who added 31 off 63 deliveries, but South Africa struggled to build partnerships around them and was eventually dismissed for 245.India’s bowlers shared the workload effectively, with Kishan Singh leading the attack.

Bangladesh seek T20 WC match shift from India after Mustafizur Rahman's IPL exit





Former Australia captain Ricky Ponting has expressed his confidence in out-of-form India skipper Suryakumar Yadav ahead of the T20 World Cup, which is set to begin on February 7. Despite a rough run in 2025, where Yadav has scored just 218 runs in 19 innings at a strike rate of 123.16, Ponting urged the Indian batter to trust his natural game and maintain his aggressive approach.“That's as big a surprise for me, just looking at his recent form. He's been such a solid and consistent contributor for India in T20 cricket for a long time and just hasn't been able to find it of late,” Ponting told ICC. He added, “He's an interesting one because when I've seen him play his best, he's taken six or eight or 10 balls to get going and then just lets it all go.”Ponting highlighted Yadav’s fearless style, comparing him to Australia’s Travis Head. “He plays all of his shots and backs himself, and a bit like Travis Head, where it almost looks like they don't ever fear getting out,” he said. “That's what I'd say to him. I'd be saying, think about scoring runs, don't think about getting out. Trust yourself, back yourself. You're proven to be as good as anybody in the world in the T20 format and go and prove it to everybody once again. ”The former Aussie great also praised India’s decision to appoint 31-year-old Axar Patel as vice-captain for the T20 World Cup. Ponting lauded Patel’s versatility, noting, “I mean, actually, Patel's been their go-to man, really hasn't he? The last few series, he's been their pinch hitter at different times.They've batted him up the order at number three. When they've needed that left-hand, right-hand combination, he's been the man to go out and try and do it for them, and he's obviously ever consistent with his left-arm off spin as well. ”Ponting admitted he was surprised by the exclusion of India ODI and Test captain Shubman Gill from the T20 squad. Gill, who has struggled in recent white-ball cricket, has 291 runs in 15 innings with a highest score of 47. “Yeah, I couldn't believe that,” Ponting said during an appearance on The ICC Review with host Sanjana Ganesan. He added, “I know his recent form hasn't been great in white-ball cricket. And the last time that I really saw much of him play was the Test series against England in the UK, where he batted as well as I've ever seen anybody bat. ”Despite his surprise, Ponting praised India’s batting depth, suggesting that leaving Gill out reflects the strength of the squad. “I mean one, I'm surprised, but two, it just shows the depth of Indian cricket,” he explained. “If you can think that someone as good as Shubman Gill doesn't get picked in a World Cup squad, then it goes to show how many good players they do have.”Ponting’s comments underline his belief that while individual form can fluctuate, backing one’s instincts and leveraging team depth remain key in high-pressure tournaments like the T20 World Cup.",Former australia captain ricky ponting has expressed his confidence in out-of-form india skipper suryakumar yadav.
