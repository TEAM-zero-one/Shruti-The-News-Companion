Explained: Why Rohit Sharma retired from Test cricket

Poll Do you think Rohit Sharma should continue playing ODIs after his T20 retirement? No, it's time to retire. Yes, he should.

India's probable Test squad for England Tour

NEW DELHI: India’s white-ball captain Rohit Sharma has finally addressed questions surrounding his future in One Day Internationals (ODIs). In a candid conversation with senior journalist Vimal Kumar, Rohit made it clear that while he’s not done just yet, he’s very aware of when to walk away.The veteran opener emphasised his evolved approach to batting, saying, ""I used to play the way I used to, I took my time. Earlier, I would play 30 balls in the first 10 overs and be at just 10 runs. But if I play 20 balls now, why can't I score 30, 35, or even 40 runs? And on the days when I get going, hitting the accelerator, scoring 80 runs in the first 10 overs isn't bad at all. That's how I think now.""READ ALSO: 'Bekaar': Rohit Sharma makes shocking statement about naturally-gifted player ""I’ve done it; I’ve scored the runs I was meant to. Now, I want to play cricket in a different way. I’m not taking any of this for granted. Don’t assume that things will just keep going the same way, that I’ll keep scoring 20 or 30 runs and just continue playing. The day I feel like I’m not able to do what I want to do on the field, I’ll stop playing. That’s for sure. But right now, I know that what I’m doing is still helping the team,"" he added.READ ALSO: Rohit Sharma hits back at criticism: 'Defending myself is waste of time' Rohit has been a key pillar in India's ODI setup, with 11,168 runs in 273 matches at an impressive average of 48.76. Under his leadership, India clinched the T20 World Cup in 2024 and the Champions Trophy earlier this year, further cementing his legacy in white-ball cricket.While he called time on his T20 career after the Barbados final, the 37-year-old recently stepped away from Test cricket after an 11-year career, having played 67 Tests and scored 4,301 runs. His highest Test score, 212, came during a memorable series against South Africa in 2019.While he’s shut the door on red-ball cricket, just like his compatriot Virat Kohli, who hung his Test boots on Monday in an unexpected retirement call, both Kohli and Rohit remain committed to ODIs, for now. Perhaps the pair is keeping an eye on the upcoming 2027 ODI World Cup.Rohit’s message is clear: he’s still hungry, still driven, but when the moment comes to step aside, he’ll do it on his own terms.","Rohit sharma has finally addressed questions surrounding his future in one day internationals.

Mattias Ekholm injury update: Edmonton Oilers eye Western Conference Final berth as their key defenseman nears potential return,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/mattias-ekholm-injury-update-edmonton-oilers-eye-western-conference-final-berth-as-their-key-defenseman-nears-potential-return/articleshow/121149327.cms,"Mattias Ekholm injury update (Getty Images)

Oilers look to capitalize on momentum with potential reinforcement ahead

A rested roster and the return of Ekholm could be a game-changer

The Edmonton Oilers are just one win away from punching their ticket to the Western Conference Final, and there’s even more reason for fans to be optimistic. Head coach Kris Knoblauch revealed a significant injury update regarding key defenseman Mattias Ekholm , who has missed nearly the entire postseason. If Edmonton wraps up their series against the Vegas Golden Knights in Game 5, they could be welcoming Ekholm back into the lineup in the next round.With a commanding 3-1 series lead over Vegas, the Oilers are poised to close things out on the road in Game 5. A win not only secures their spot in the next round but also provides the team with valuable rest days. This could be crucial in aiding Ekholm’s recovery.“Mattias has been on the ice for light skates,” Knoblauch said. “He will not be joining us this series. We’re hopeful that he can join us next series if we can get to that.”Ekholm has been sidelined with an undisclosed injury, having played only once since March 26. Despite his absence, the Oilers have managed to maintain strong defensive play, but the return of a veteran blueliner with postseason experience could provide a major lift.Knoblauch emphasized the importance of closing out the series quickly—not just to stop Vegas from gaining momentum, but to allow the team to recover physically.“Obviously there's a lot of benefits of winning that next game,” Knoblauch explained. “You don't give that opportunity for Vegas to put together a string of wins, and then also the ability just to have some downtime, guys can rest and not add on.”He added, “You know, the bumps and bruises through the playoff season as it goes, guys get banged up and it's a physical game, as we've talked about. But I think right now that's an extra benefit.”Also Read: Sidney Crosby’s return to the 2025 World Championship signals a powerful moment for Team Canada and its future Ekholm contributed nine goals and 24 assists during the regular season, anchoring the blue line with his two-way play.

What’s Next for Golden State?

Theface an uncertain future after a challenging playoff run. Stephen Curry is nearing the end of his of his illustrious career and so is Draymond Green. Even though they acquired Jimmy Butler earlier this year, their path to the Western Conference could look bleak given the injuries that these players succumb to. Could a blockbuster move for a Lakers superstar change their fortunes next season?(Disclaimer: The data and analysis in this post are based on conjecture as of right now.Although the information is based on reliable sources, it's crucial to remember that these are not official declarations or verified actions. It is advised that readers use caution when interpreting this analysis and wait for official updates as the offseason progresses.) Sports Illustrated’s Alex Kirschenbaum recently suggested that the Golden State Warriors might pursue Los Angeles Lakers forward LeBron James this offseason. James, a four-time NBA champion, could provide Golden State with much-needed frontcourt size and experience.Kirschenbaum noted: ""(LeBron) James has long been linked to Golden State, in part because his rivalry against Warriors stars Stephen Curry and Draymond Green (they've played each other in five playoff series, during which James has gone 2-3) eventually blossomed into a bromance.""However, age and injury concerns loom large. A potential lineup featuring James (39), Curry (37), Jimmy Butler (35), and Draymond Green (34) would raise questions about durability.According to Caleb Hightower of the Sporting News 1. Championship Pedigree: James brings unmatched playoff experience and leadership.2. Fit with Curry: Their contrasting skill sets could create an unstoppable offensive duo.3. Lakers’ Struggles: With L.A. failing to advance past the first round, James may seek a new challenge.- Injury Risks: James, Curry, and Butler all dealt with significant injuries this postseason.- Contract Hurdles: James holds a $52.6 million player option, complicating any trade or signing.- Lakers’ Plans: His commitment to playing alongside Luka Dončić could keep him in Los Angeles.If the Warriors exit the playoffs early and seek a roster shakeup, James could emerge as a high-risk, high-reward target. While his arrival would electrify the Bay Area, logistical and financial challenges make this move far from guaranteed.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Los Angeles Lakers predicted to sign $197,230,450 Memphis Grizzlies star to bolster squad around LeBron James and Luka Doncic For now, fans can only speculate—but the idea of LeBron in a Warriors jersey remains a fascinating possibility.","Golden state warriors face an uncertain future after a challenging playoff run.

NEW DELHI: Bollywood actor and Punjab Kings co-owner Preity Zinta schooled a fan on social media for an inappropriate and sexist question during a fun chat session on X. The incident sparked a larger conversation on the gender bias women face in corporate and sports environments.During the Q&A session on X, a fan asked, ""Mam, Maxwell ki aapse shadi nahi hui isiliye vo aapko team se accha nahi khelta tha? (Did Maxwell not play well for the team because he didn't marry you?).""Zinta responded firmly, calling out the blatant sexism: ""Will you ask this question to the male team owners of all teams, or is this discrimination just towards the women?"" she wrote.She added, ""I never knew how difficult it is for women to survive in corporate setups until I got into cricket. I’m sure you asked this question out of humour, but I hope you can actually look at your question and understand what you are trying to say because if you really understand what you’re trying to say, it’s not pretty! I think I have earned my stripes by working very hard for the past 18 years so please give me the respect I deserve & stop with the gender bias. Thank you.""The fan deleted the question shortly after, but Zinta's pointed reply struck a chord with many, highlighting the everyday struggles women face in male-dominated fields like sports ownership.Earlier in the session, Zinta also paid tribute to Virat Kohli following his Test retirement, calling him a ""transformative figure"" in red-ball cricket and lamenting the massive void left by the exit of stalwarts like Kohli, Rohit Sharma , and Ravichandran Ashwin Zinta's candid remarks have drawn widespread praise for addressing sexism head-on while also sharing her genuine love for the game.",Bollywood actor and punjab kings co-owner preity zinta schooled a fan on social media for an inappropriate and sexist question during a fun chat session on x.

Aaron Ekblad’s skillset and playoff experience could make him a game-changer for Edmonton

As the Edmonton Oilers push toward the Western Conference Final with a commanding 3-1 lead over the Vegas Golden Knights, the focus remains on the current playoff run. But behind the scenes, the front office is reportedly preparing for a pivotal offseason—and a blockbuster move may be on the horizon.According to Bleacher Report’s Lyle Richardson, the Oilers have been floated as a potential landing spot for Florida Panthers star defenseman Aaron Ekblad in free agency. The veteran blue-liner, who carries an estimated market value of around $60 million, could significantly bolster Edmonton’s defensive corps if a deal materializes.Ekblad is no stranger to high-stakes hockey. A cornerstone of the Florida Panthers’ blue line, he has proven himself as a reliable two-way defenseman over the years. During the regular season, he recorded 3 goals and 30 assists in 56 games. His presence has continued to be felt in the playoffs, where he’s already contributed 1 goal and 3 assists in just five games.More than just his stats, Ekblad’s ability to adapt to different defensive pairings and maintain effectiveness under pressure is what makes him an ideal fit for a team like Edmonton.“The Oilers saw Ekblad’s talent first hand in last season’s Stanley Cup Final . Scherber makes the case that his effectiveness, ability to adapt to different defense partners, and overall skills would be a terrific fit on Edmonton’s blue line. He’d also have a chance to play with superstars Connor McDavid and Leon Draisaitl ,” Richardson wrote.The Oilers have long been known for their offensive firepower, headlined by the likes of McDavid and Draisaitl. But balancing their attack with defensive consistency has been a challenge.

Max Verstappen: “Better to watch him fight back”: F1 legend Mario Andretti thinks Max Verstappen is better off without a dominant Red Bull car,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/formula-one/news/better-to-watch-him-fight-back-f1-legend-mario-andretti-thinks-max-verstappen-is-better-off-without-a-dominant-red-bull-car/articleshow/121110142.cms,"Mario Andretti (via Getty Images)



Mario Andretti feels Red Bull's design issues are bringing out Verstappen's unpolished talent



Adrian Newey's departure creates a visible gap at Red Bull, claims Mario Andretti



Motor sport icon Mario Andretti has provided a new perspective on Max Verstappen 's Formula 1 campaign in 2025, claiming the Red Bull Racing driver doesn't need the quickest car to be at his best—and that fans are actually served better when he isn't. The 1978 Formula 1 World Champion explained to GPblog why Max Verstappen's present status as an underdog relative to McLaren benefits the sport and why Adrian Newey 's resignation could be at the core of Red Bull's problems.As the 2025 F1 season approaches its European swing, Max Verstappen is on the back foot. McLaren's Oscar Piastri has stormed ahead with three consecutive wins, but Verstappen is still in the title race without the advantage of the dominant car he's had in recent years. For Mario Andretti, that's not a drawback—it's entertainment. “You can tell that he does not have more of a clear advantage,” Mario Andretti said. “He doesn't need an advantage, by the way. He's good enough. For us watching, it's best if he doesn't, because he fights. Watch him; it's really better to watch him fight back than to 'oh, he's gone. Nobody can touch him.”Mario Andretti believes that when Max Verstappen is pushed, it brings out a different kind of driving from him—more grit, more drama, and more thrill for the fans. The consistency of the Dutch driver in putting up good shows despite Red Bull's recent inconsistency has been a major theme of the 2025 season.Although Red Bull Racing has brushed aside rumours of a structural crisis, Mario Andretti is of the opinion that the loss of long-time technical director Adrian Newey has taken a definite toll on the performance of the team. Newey, who left to join Aston Martin, was the pillar of Red Bull's car development achievement for almost two decades.“I don't know if it's a coincidence or what, but ever since Adrian Newey left the team, something seemed like something was missing,” he stated. “I know Adrian very well. He's the best engineer I've ever worked with. I suppose so. He was in IndyCar with me in ’87, so I know his value, and he has a record to show for what he's done with every team he's been with. So again, it is what it is. Just the events and whatever happened. We all know. But from where I sit, I think that's part of the issue. If they were to express themselves openly, they would say the same thing; especially Jos is the other, I think. But then again, it's not my business.”Also read: Colton Herta Leads Cadillac's F1 Driver List: Mario Andretti Assures Max Verstappen can no longer be alone in a league of his own with Red Bull's equipment in 2025, but in the eyes of Mario Andretti, that's what makes the season more interesting. As the fight at the front gets more intense, Verstappen's resistance to pressure is solidifying his reputation—not only as a quick driver but also as a fighter. And for Formula 1 enthusiasts, that's a victory on its own.","Mario andretti believes red bull's design issues are bringing out max verstappen's unpolished talent.

What’s going on with Travis Kelce? Mysterious offseason shift alarms NFL fans,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/whats-going-on-with-travis-kelce-mysterious-offseason-shift-alarms-nfl-fans/articleshow/121138949.cms,"Travis Kelce is reportedly undergoing a significant physical transformation (Getty Images)

Leaner and faster: Travis Kelce’s offseason transformation could be a game-changer

Travis Kelce isn’t just preparing for another season—he’s potentially gearing up for his last, and he’s doing it with a major physical transformation. The Kansas City Chiefs star tight end has reportedly dropped over 20 pounds this offseason, signaling a level of intensity and focus that suggests he’s all-in on making 2025 a season to remember.NFL insider Dov Kleiman reported the weight loss via X (formerly Twitter), highlighting that Kelce is more committed than ever to being in peak shape. At 34, Kelce has nothing left to prove—three Super Bowl rings, countless Pro Bowl appearances, and a reputation as one of the greatest tight ends in NFL history. But for the future Hall of Famer, there’s one more mountain he wants to climb.Shedding 20+ pounds isn’t just a cosmetic choice. Kelce has built his career on precision route-running, agility, and the ability to create separation even against elite defenders. Losing weight may not only enhance his speed but could also reduce the physical toll on his joints after more than a decade in one of the league’s most physically demanding positions.The move comes after a season that, while ending in a Super Bowl victory, showed glimpses of wear and tear on Kelce. Paired with the spotlight of his high-profile relationship with Taylor Swift, many questioned whether he’d hang up his cleats. But instead of retreating from the game, Kelce has doubled down.""I'm coming back for sure. Gonna try to get into the best shape I've been this offseason and get back to the mountaintop,"" Kelce wrote to ESPN’s Pat McAfee earlier this year. ""Got a real bad taste in my mouth with how I played in that last game and with how I got the guys ready for battle. I can't go out like that!!!!""Also Read: Taylor Swift’s quiet return with Travis Kelce hints at something big—are the daisies a clue for her next music release? That kind of fire has sparked serious buzz around the league. With rumors swirling that 2025 could be his final season, Kelce’s renewed focus and physical overhaul could make him even more dangerous. If this is indeed his farewell tour, he’s not just aiming to play—he’s aiming to dominate.And history has shown, when Travis Kelce is locked in, greatness usually follows.","Travis kelce is reportedly undergoing a significant physical transformation.

Hoyland and Loop: two rookies, one shot at replacing a legend

In a stunning shift that few saw coming, the Baltimore Ravens are entering a new era without the leg of Justin Tucker—one of the most iconic and reliable kickers in NFL history. The team released Tucker on May 5, marking the end of a 14-year tenure during which he became the league’s most accurate kicker with an 89.1% success rate. Now, Baltimore is turning to fresh faces and open competition to find their next special teams cornerstone.Baltimore Ravens signed former Wyoming standout John Hoyland on Monday following a strong showing at a recent tryout. He’ll now go head-to-head with rookie Tyler Loop , a sixth-round pick out of Arizona, in what promises to be one of the most closely watched position battles of Ravens training camp.Hoyland brings a strong collegiate résumé, especially in short-range consistency—missing only twice in 54 career kicks from under 40 yards. His long-range game is still developing, with most of his misses coming from beyond 50 yards. But his calm under pressure and work ethic made him an attractive candidate for the Ravens, who may be seeking the next undrafted success story—much like Tucker himself once was.Loop, on the other hand, enters the competition as the first kicker the Ravens have ever drafted. He made 6 of 9 field goals from 50-plus yards at Arizona, including a booming 62-yarder that showcased his leg strength.Both kickers had strong showings in rookie minicamp, earning praise from head coach John Harbaugh. “Both kickers, I thought, looked really good today. So, we got them out there behind the line with the snap and everything, and I think they made them all, didn’t they? So that’s good to see. It’s a good start that way.”Tucker’s release wasn’t just about age or performance. The move came amid an ongoing NFL investigation involving 16 massage therapists accusing him of inappropriate behavior, as reported by the Baltimore Banner. The Ravens called it a “football decision,” but the timing raises questions about the franchise's internal calculus.Also Read: Who is Rich Eisen?

Shedeur Sanders draws inspiration from Tom Brady after draft slide

From Day 3 pick to potential starter: Sanders begins NFL journey with quiet confidence

Shedeur Sanders entered the 2025 NFL Draft with high expectations. Once considered a potential first-round pick, the former Colorado standout instead endured a surprising drop to the fifth round. But rather than dwelling on the disappointment, Sanders is embracing the challenge—and he’s using inspiration from one of the greatest quarterbacks of all time to fuel his fire.After being selected by the Cleveland Browns, Sheduer Sanders revealed he had a conversation with seven-time Super Bowl champion Tom Brady. The message he took away from it could define his approach to the NFL.""That my story is going to be similar,"" Sanders told reporters. ""I was a late-round draft pick, but we’re here now, so none of that stuff matters. That just mattered on the day, and I’m just excited to be here and ready to work.""Falling to Day 3 in the draft can be discouraging, especially for a player as high-profile as Sanders. But the Browns quarterback is already showing maturity beyond his years. With eyes set on proving himself in Cleveland, Sanders is determined to rewrite the narrative around his draft position.According to Cleveland.com’s Mary Kay Cabot, Sanders “performed well on the field” during rookie minicamp, demonstrating “good arm strength” and “sound decision-making.” Those early signs are encouraging for a player looking to compete for the starting job as early as this season.Sanders' pedigree isn’t in question—he’s the son of Hall of Famer Deion Sanders and showcased leadership, accuracy, and poise during his college career. Now, the real test begins at the professional level, where pressure, competition, and scrutiny are magnified.Tom Brady’s rise from 199th overall pick to GOAT status is one of the NFL’s most legendary stories. Sanders knows that kind of arc takes time, resilience, and relentless effort. But the belief in himself is clear, and the foundation is set.Also Read: Tom Brady raises eyebrows after including exes Gisele Bündchen and Bridget Moynahan in Mother’s Day post Whether Sanders ultimately carves out a Brady-like legacy or not, one thing is certain: he’s not shying away from the moment.

A Christmas Day clash with serious playoff implications



As the NFL continues its tradition of high-stakes Christmas Day football, this year’s festive matchup promises both on-field intensity and off-field star power. The Kansas City Chiefs are slated to face the Denver Broncos on December 25, and it’s already shaping up to be more than just a game — it’s becoming a celebrity-infused holiday event.Travis Kelce and global pop icon Taylor Swift are reportedly planning to celebrate Christmas together again this year — this time alongside Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes and his wife, Brittany. The couple will be spending the holiday in Kansas City before the Chiefs hit the field at 5:15 p.m. PT / 8:15 p.m. ET for their primetime matchup against the Broncos.Swift's growing presence in Kelce’s life has become a staple in both NFL and entertainment news, and her deepening connection to the Chiefs community adds another layer of interest to this year’s holiday game. This festive gathering with the Mahomes family could symbolize her further integration into Kelce’s world — and by extension, the heart of Chiefs Kingdom.Beyond the celebrity headlines, the game itself carries major implications. The Chiefs are aiming to reclaim their Super Bowl crown after a devastating 40-22 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles in February — a blow that ended their hopes for a historic three-peat. Kansas City enters the 2025 season having won the AFC West for nine straight years, but they’ll need every win to stay ahead in a more competitive division.The Denver Broncos, meanwhile, are riding high after breaking a nearly decade-long playoff drought last season, helped in part by a split series against the Chiefs. With rookie quarterback Bo Nix continuing to impress, Denver could pose a real threat to Kansas City’s postseason ambitions.This year’s Christmas matchup will be exclusively broadcast on Prime Video, part of the league’s expanding media strategy after its successful partnership with Netflix last year. The 2024 holiday games drew over 65 million viewers, and the Chiefs’ win over the Steelers was especially memorable — featuring Kelce’s record-setting touchdown catch that surpassed franchise legend Tony Gonzalez.Also Read: Travis Kelce drops 25 pounds under Taylor Swift’s influence—helpful push or harmful pressure?

Browns take a chance on controversial QB Shedeur Sanders



“I’m here to work and win.”

Shedeur Sanders has a point to prove



The NFL draft had barely settled when Cleveland made a move that stunned nearly everyone—drafting Shedeur Sanders. Ignored by other teams and dismissed by critics, Sanders now steps into a franchise built on heartbreak and hunger. But make no mistake, this wasn’t just a draft pick. It was a warning. “I’m here to work and win,” he declared, not as a promise, but as a battle cry. And with that, Shedeur Sanders lit a fuse in Cleveland.Shedeur wasn’t supposed to land in Cleveland. At least, not according to the so-called experts. Teams backed off, scouts doubted, and whispers of distraction clouded his name. But the Browns saw something different—an edge, a spark, maybe even the guts to lead a locker room that’s been gasping for a quarterback with swagger and substance.While others questioned his discipline, his focus, or his celebrity status, Sanders is keeping his vision sharp. “I feel like the Browns fans they just want something to hope for and they’ve been wanting it so long and long,” he said. “And finally, I’m here to change that, I’m here to actually get what they want.” That isn’t just confidence. That’s defiance.Cleveland isn’t an easy market. The weight of broken seasons, endless quarterback rotations, and dashed playoff hopes isn’t lost on Sanders. But he’s not shying away. He’s owning it.“On the field, of course, that’s where I want my personality,” Sanders said. “That's what I want to be known for, is the one that came here and changed the franchise.”The most dangerous athletes in sports are the ones with something to prove. Sanders watched as team after team passed on him. Now, with a chip on his shoulder and a city behind him, he’s poised to flip the script.Also Read: 2025 NFL Schedule unveiled: Eagles vs. Cowboys, Global matchups and key games you can't miss And whether he starts Week 1 or not, he’s not just trying to make the roster.
