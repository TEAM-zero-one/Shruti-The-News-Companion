NHL Trade Rumors: Erik Karlsson linked to Detroit Red Wings amid talks with Pittsburgh Penguins,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/nhl-trade-rumors-erik-karlsson-linked-to-detroit-red-wings-amid-talks-with-pittsburgh-penguins/articleshow/122302958.cms,"Erik Karlsson linked to Detroit Red Wings amid talks with Pittsburgh Penguins (Image Via Getty)

Erik Karlsson could be the answer to the evolution of the Red Wings' defense

Trade talks between the Detroit Red Wings and the Pittsburgh Penguins have become serious due to the inclusion of the name of defenseman Erik Karlsson. With the talks still ongoing, it is seemingly becoming more and more likely that this veteran defenseman will be granted a new environment before the coming NHL season. Both organizations sit at critical junctures: Detroit dreaming of ending a playoff drought, and Pittsburgh faced with an aging core and very tight salary cap flexibility. With Karlsson's gigantic $92 million contract still intact, the salary retention by Pittsburgh might be what deters the deal, and might just also seal it.Erik Karlsson, having won the Norris Trophy twice, is a veteran in the twilight of his career, but is still respected throughout the league. He showed that last year, recording 53 points, 11 of which were goals and averaging over 23 minutes of ice-time per game, showing his ability and stamina. Meanwhile, the Red Wings had trouble generating offense from the defensive end on a consistent basis. Their power play was good, yet on even strength, they were almost impotent offensively, and by the time they started to crack defensively, it had cost them a postseason ticket for this year.If Karlsson were to enter Detroit, he could take on a mentor role for up-and-coming talents Moritz Seider and Simon Edvinsson by instilling calm, excellent puck movement, and veteran leadership into the young and upward-moving defense corps. The team has already spurned a different direction in hiring Todd McLellan as its head coach, and with General Manager Steve Yzerman still handling the rebuild, might a trade for Karlsson indicate a transition from long-term planning to short-term window?Trading Karlsson may be more of a roster move for the Penguins. His $11.5 million cap hit is an onerous burden for a team that has failed to make the playoffs for a second straight year. Although Sidney Crosby is still producing, the roster as a whole offered little to back him up and to balance around him. The younger players never truly stepped up to their expectations, and the front office now has some harsh decisions to make about which direction it will take.Also Read: Why Steven Stamkos, Jonathan Marchessault and Justus Annunen are giving trouble to the Nashville Predators Though never written in stone, Karlsson trade rumors ever so strongly suggested the intentions of the two franchises: Detroit wishes to retool with mainly experienced talent, while Pittsburgh appears ready to shed some salary and prepare for a slight reset. The moment the trade passes through, it might very well rank among the deepest contours that will carve the NHL off-season for both franchises.","Erik karlsson linked to detroit red wings amid talks with pittsburgh penguins.

A legacy with something to prove returns for a third try at DCC

Emotional fallout, a strained friendship, and a quiet comeback

Dayton Bramhall's journey with the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders has been anything but easy — and her story has become one of the most emotional arcs in Season 2 of Netflix's America’s Sweethearts: Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders. A third-time auditionee and daughter of longtime DCC associate choreographer Shelly Bramhall, Dayton came into the 2024 training camp with the weight of a legacy and the pressure to finally make the team. But after once again being cut, the young dancer made a decision that would redefine her identity beyond the DCC brand.Raised in McKinney, Texas, Dayton Bramhall has been immersed in the world of the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders her entire life. Her mother, Shelly, was part of the DCC class of 1989 and has served as a key figure on the staff for years. That connection, however, didn’t secure Dayton a spot. “None of us want you to make this team just because you have a history,” director Kelli Finglass told her bluntly. “You need to earn to make this team. ”Despite showing improvement and passion during her audition, Dayton Bramhall struggled with memorizing choreography and keeping up with the precision and power expected at the elite level.“There’s one that just won’t stick in my body, but I’ll get it,” she said during training camp. Unfortunately, the veterans didn’t believe she was ready — and Finglass ultimately told her it would be a “disservice to have you make this team and the struggle be all year. ”While Dayton took the cut with grace, the decision left ripples in her personal life. Her mother Shelly admitted, “That was hard because we were friends. If anything, I wasn’t hurt by her not making it, I was way more hurt by Kelli and Judy.” Despite the tension, Dayton chose to tell her mom herself, showing maturity beyond her years.She returned in 2025 for another shot — but was cut again before training camp. In a heartfelt comment on TikTok, Dayton wrote, “I did EVERYTHING they asked of me and tried my absolute best to fit their mold. I’m not wanted there and I’m hoping this takes me to where I truly belong.”Also Read: Where is Armani Latimer now?

Denver Nuggets

Jonas Valanciunas

The Backup Center Dilemma Surrounding Jonas Valaciunas

The Three-Word Message: ""Honor Your Contract""

Why This Matters for the Denver Nuggets and Jokic

Entertaining the Drama

Therecently sent a stern three-word message to, the newly-acquired backup center for their superstar Nikola Jokic , underscoring their firm stance amid a complex offseason situation.For years, the Denver Nuggets have struggled to find a reliable backup for Jokic, the three-time NBA MVP whose unique skill set is central to Denver’s offense. When Jokic rests, the team’s offense often stagnates, making the backup center position critical for maintaining competitiveness during the regular season. This offseason, Denver finally addressed this issue by trading for Jonas Valanciunas from the Sacramento Kings in exchange for Dario Saric.Valanciunas, a 6-foot-11, 265-pound veteran, is a versatile big man capable of scoring from multiple levels, rebounding aggressively, and providing solid defense. Last season, he averaged 10.4 points and 7.7 rebounds in just 20.1 minutes per game, making him an ideal candidate to keep the Nuggets’ frontcourt strong when Jokic is off the floor.Despite the promising fit, Valanciunas has complicated the situation by expressing a desire to leave the NBA and join Greek powerhouse Panathinaikos in the EuroLeague.He reportedly offered to forfeit his $10.4 million contract to make the move possible. However, the Denver Nuggets have made it crystal clear with their three-word directive to Valanciunas: ""Honor your contract.""Denver has no intention of granting a buyout or releasing Valanciunas from his contract, as they view him as a critical piece to back up Jokic and maintain championship aspirations. This firm stance is also a strategic move to preserve their cap space and avoid reopening the backup center void should Valanciunas depart.The Denver Nuggets’ message is both a warning and a declaration of intent. They are signaling that they expect Valanciunas to fulfill his role and contribute to the team’s success rather than pursuing a European career at this juncture. This is crucial for Jokic, who benefits immensely from having a dependable partner in the paint. With Jokic entering his 30s, managing his minutes and health is vital for Denver’s championship window.Moreover, the Nuggets have bolstered their roster with other key additions like Bruce Brown, Cam Johnson, and Tim Hardaway Jr., aiming to build a deep, versatile team around Jokic. Keeping Valanciunas committed is part of that larger strategy to sustain a strong frontcourt rotation and avoid the offensive freezes that occur when Jokic sits.This offseason saga adds an intriguing layer to the Denver Nuggets’ narrative. Valanciunas, a seasoned NBA veteran, is caught between a lucrative NBA contract and the allure of a European basketball return. The Nuggets’ three-word message is a no-nonsense reminder that business comes first in the NBA, even as players weigh personal and professional crossroads.For fans, this creates a compelling subplot: Will Valanciunas comply and become the steadfast backup Jokic needs, or will the Nuggets have to navigate another backup center crisis? Either way, Denver’s front office is playing hardball, emphasizing team commitment over individual preference.Also read: Bronny James’ Viral Dunk Was So Insane, the Internet Thought the NBA Drug Tested Him In summary, the Denver Nuggets have sent a clear and firm message to Jonas Valanciunas: ""Honor your contract.""

The missing fifth: Moss sparks a fan firestorm



A simple tweet from Hall of Famer Randy Moss has set off the fiercest quarterback debate of the NFL offseason. While casually discussing the top five QBs with his son, Moss named four superstars and left the fifth spot open to the public. What followed was a firestorm of hot takes, rankings, and fan wars across social media platforms. With the 2025 season looming, the question of who makes the league’s “Fab Five” is hotter than ever.“Me and my son at lunch trying to pick top 5 QBs…” Moss posted. “Mahomes Jackson Allen Burrow in no order. Who's the 5th?”Patrick Mahomes leads the pack, and rightfully so. With three Super Bowl rings, two MVPs, and an 89–23 record, he’s in a league of his own. His career already includes 245 passing touchdowns and the fastest climb to 30,000 yards. Simply put—Mahomes isn’t playing football; he’s rewriting it.Lamar Jackson brings electricity every time he touches the field. In 2024, he became the first-ever QB with 4,000+ pass yards and 800+ rushing yards in a season. He holds two MVP awards and the most rushing yards ever by a QB (6,173). His dual-threat dominance is unmatched in NFL history.Josh Allen continues to redefine physical quarterbacking. Standing 6'5"", the 2024 MVP has five straight seasons with 40+ total touchdowns. Known for his bruising runs and deep-ball heroics, Allen once recorded three passing and three rushing TDs in a single game. Even Tom Brady called his game “frightening.”Joe Burrow, calm and clinical, is the technician of the group. After wrist surgery, he led the league in passing yards (4,918) and touchdowns (43) in 2024. His 70.6% completion rate now stands as the highest in NFL history. “He plays the position the way it was intended,” Chris Simms once said.The real storm lies in who deserves that final elite slot. Fans flooded replies with names like Justin Herbert, C.J. Stroud, Jalen Hurts, Dak Prescott, and Aaron Rodgers. The debate exposed biases, loyalty, and the razor-thin margins at the top of the league.Also read: NFL star Dak Prescott is quietly facing the biggest career reckoning of his Cowboys era For Moss, it was likely just a fun father-son moment.

Shubman Gill, Gautam Gambhir shut critics with thumping win over England

Poll Will India's bowling attack be more effective with Bumrah back in the lineup? Yes, definitely No, they are fine as is

India's thumping 336-run victory over England at Edgbaston has breathed fresh life into the five-Test series, now locked at 1-1. As the caravan moves to the hallowed turf of Lord’s for the third Test starting July 10, talk has already begun around team combinations and the challenge of facing what Stuart Broad ominously called a “dangerous” Indian bowling unit.“This Indian bowling attack would worry me if I was in that England batting lineup,” Broad said during a Sky Sports panel discussion following India’s historic win. “The ball just nips down that slope at Lord’s. Akash Deep brings the stumps into play, and if it swings, Bumrah will be lethal with the late movement.”Shubman Gill’s youthful Indian team, still riding the high of their first-ever Test win at Edgbaston, appear settled and confident. Gill led from the front with a match tally of 430 runs (269 and 161), while Akash Deep stepped up in Jasprit Bumrah’s absence, claiming a stunning 10-wicket haul.With Bumrah set to return, former England captain Mark Butcher speculated that India are unlikely to make many changes. “Bumrah will come back, and the rest will stay the same,” Butcher said.Former Sri Lanka captain Kumar Sangakkara agreed, noting, “[Mohammed] Siraj and Akash Deep will play.Prasidh Krishna might make way for Bumrah. And they’ll probably retain Washington Sundar at No. 8 for the balance he offers.”On England’s side, the focus is on refreshing their misfiring pace attack. “[Chris] Woakes hasn’t had great success and was unlucky, but his Lord’s record is outstanding,” Broad noted. He also voiced caution about rushing in Jofra Archer or Gus Atkinson without recent match fitness.“England play well at Lord’s,” Broad added, “but this Indian attack — especially with Bumrah back — could pose a serious threat.”As the third Test looms, it’s India’s revitalised pace battery, not just their record-breaking captain, that now has England on high alert.","India's thumping 336-run victory over england at edgbaston has breathed fresh life into the five-test series, now locked at 1-1.

Patrick Mahomes remains unwavering in support as Travis Kelce’s future hangs in balance

Patrick Mahomes, Travis Kelce, and Select Chiefs Players Speak with the Media | JUNE 18, 2025

The Kansas City Chiefs may be entering the most emotionally charged season of the Patrick Mahomes-Travis Kelce era. While Mahomes’ legacy continues to rise, the looming possibility of Travis Kelce retiring after the 2025 season casts a shadow over what might be the final act of one of the NFL’s most iconic quarterback-tight end duos.Travis Kelce, who has one year remaining on his contract, hasn’t made a definitive retirement announcement—but all signs point to the 2025 campaign potentially being his curtain call. The 34-year-old tight end, who has been Mahomes’ go-to weapon since 2018, continues to be a vital cog in Kansas City’s offense despite a slight dip in production in recent seasons.Even with whispers of retirement growing louder, Mahomes made it clear this offseason that his faith in Kelce remains unchanged. “I expect Travis to be Travis,” Mahomes said confidently.“Obviously, the play on the field's going to be high. He's going to go out there with the mentality that we're trying to win the Super Bowl this year with us falling short this last year. Then, I think more than anything, it's the leadership that he brings to the building every single day.”That leadership is precisely what sets Kelce apart—not just his ability to find soft spots in coverage or his chemistry with Mahomes, but his presence in the locker room.Mahomes added, “How he leads by example and how he leads vocally, it's a big impact on our football team, so I expect him to play at a high level and then be an even better leader.”Since the Mahomes-Kelce partnership began, the Chiefs have been perennial contenders and one of the most feared offenses in football. The duo transformed the franchise into a dynasty in the making. But if this is indeed Kelce’s final season, Chiefs Kingdom might be witnessing the end of an unforgettable chapter.Also Read: Why Taylor Swift still can't dethrone the Dallas Cowboys as 'America's Team' despite Chiefs' meteoric rise While there's still hope that Kelce might return in 2026, fans and analysts alike are preparing to appreciate every route, every touchdown, and every chest bump between No. 15 and No. 87.

Poll Will England still win the series 3-1 as predicted by Michael Vaughan? Yes, they will bounce back No, India will take the series

India’s stunning 336-run win over England in the second Test at Edgbaston may have levelled the five-match series 1-1, but former England captain Michael Vaughan isn’t backing down from his pre-series prediction of a 3-1 victory in favour of the hosts.“India have been too good this week .. Outstanding performance .. My prediction is still alive .. 3-1 England ..” Vaughan posted on X, acknowledging India’s dominance but staying firm on his forecast.In his column for The Telegraph, however, Vaughan was more critical of England, accusing them of regressing after Headingley. “This week, they were back to their bad old ways,” he wrote. “Apart from four hours on the third day where Harry Brook and Jamie Smith batted beautifully, they have been totally dominated by India.”Vaughan pointed out that England misread their opening win in Leeds, where dropped catches by India tilted the momentum. “They turned up here and thought they should do everything the same way, and it has backfired,” he said, warning that relying on “fortune” won’t win big series.“You win games relying on fortune, but not big series like this one or the Ashes,” he added, urging England to “evolve” rather than base their method on a single game.Former pacer Stuart Broad, speaking on Sky Sports, also raised red flags about England’s bowling setup. “I'd be worried about this Indian bowling attack at Lord’s,” he said, highlighting the threat of Akash Deep and the returning Bumrah. “If it swings, you've got Bumrah who swings it so late and will be dangerous.”With the third Test at Lord’s starting July 10, both pundits stressed the need for England to reassess quickly. India, meanwhile, appear primed to keep the pressure on.","India beat england by 336 runs in the second test at edgbaston. Former england captain michael vaughan predicted a 3-1 series win for india.

Fan Sentiment Favors Smart Return

Thecould be on the verge of reuniting with a familiar face as they navigate a crucial offseason. Amid ongoing efforts to stay below the NBA’s restrictive second apron, the Celtics are exploring ways to bolster their backcourt depth, and a return for former Defensive Player of the Year Marcus Smart is reportedly on their radar.Following the trade of Jrue Holiday to the Portland Trail Blazers in June, Boston’s guard rotation now leans heavily on Derrick White and Anfernee Simons. While both players are capable starters, the Boston Celtics lack experienced depth behind them — an issue the front office may soon address.According to Vishwesha Kumar of Yardbarker, Marcus Smart could be a target if his current team, the Washington Wizards, pursues a buyout.“Smart would provide much-needed leadership, defense, and familiarity at a team-friendly deal,” Kumar noted in his report. “His return would energize the fan base and stabilize a locker room that’s lost much of its core.” (H/t: Sporting News)Marcus Smart, the former No. 6 overall pick in the 2014 NBA Draft, spent nine seasons with Boston before being traded to the Memphis Grizzlies in June 2023 as part of the Kristaps Porzingis deal.That trade was initially seen as a bold move to reshape the roster around Jayson Tatum and Jaylen Brown.However, Porzingis was subsequently shipped to the Atlanta Hawks in another cost-cutting trade, and Smart’s time in Memphis was short-lived. He was dealt to Washington in February 2025, where he has since been part of a rebuilding Wizards squad focused on developing young talent.Given the Wizards’ youth-focused direction, a buyout for the 31-year-old guard is increasingly realistic. With Smart on an expiring $21.6 million contract and limited trade interest due to that hefty salary, parting ways through a buyout may benefit both parties.If bought out, Marcus Smart would likely attract interest from multiple teams seeking a defensive-minded veteran on a bargain deal — and the Celtics could be at the front of that line.Boston’s roster has experienced significant turnover in the past two seasons, losing key veterans and reshaping its identity. A Smart reunion could bring leadership, defensive intensity, and stability to a locker room still finding its footing.He would also serve as a valuable mentor for the Boston Celtics’ younger players, including recent additions Baylor Scheierman and Hugo Gonzalez.Despite an injury-marred campaign split between Memphis and Washington, Marcus Smart’s defensive impact and veteran presence remain attractive qualities.Here’s a look at his numbers from the 2024-25 regular season:For a fan base still adjusting to the loss of beloved veterans, Smart’s return would likely be met with enthusiasm. His gritty playing style and defensive tenacity made him a fan favorite during his nine-year run in Boston.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Los Angeles Lakers could be chasing $251,019,650 Washington Wizards superstar to form Big 3 with LeBron James and Luka Doncic While nothing is official yet, all signs point to the Boston Celtics keeping a close eye on Smart’s situation in Washington as they seek affordable options to strengthen their depth for the upcoming season.","Marcus smart could be a target if his current team, the washington wizards, pursues a buyout.

Andre the Giant is a larger-than-life individual and one of the most recognizable professional wrestlers in the sports entertainment industry. He is a well-known figure with an overwhelmingly successful career, even if it was cut short.Andre the Giant is best known for his tenure during the Rock n Wrestling Era of WWE during the 1980s, with being a massive attraction for the company. He played a huge role in some of the most unforgettable moments in professional wrestling, and his passing in 1993 truly rocked the wrestling community, especially considering how much he was adored by fans everywhere.The massive size of Andre the Giant was always part of the appeal of his character, as it helped him stand out as an attraction since starting his wrestling career in the 1960s. However, his reign in the wrestling industry was cut short after his shocking demise at the age of 46. Let’s take a look at the WWE icon’s shocking demise.After reigning in the wrestling industry for almost three decades, WWE legend Andre the Giant passed away on January 28, 1993, of an apparent heart attack in his sleep in Paris at a hotel named Hotel De La Tremoille. His sudden demise was likely associated with his untreated acromegaly, at a Paris hotel, at the age of 46.According to, his passing was not too long after he wrestled his last match at AJPW in December 1992, where he teamed with Rusher Kimura and Giant Baba against Masanobu Fuchi, Haruka Eigen, and Motoshi Okuma. Earlier reports suggest that the wrestling legend was visiting Paris at that time for his father’s funeral. He was actually found dead in his room by the hotel management and his chauffeur.Following his death in Paris, his family in France held a funeral for him, intending to bury him near his father, who passed away a few days back. When they learned of his wish to be cremated, his body was flown to the United States, where he was cremated according to his wishes. But, what could be the possible reason for his sudden demise.WWE legend Andre the Giant was dubbed ""the greatest drunk on Earth"" for once consuming over 41 litres in six hours. This was revealed during an appearance on, where the wrestling legend revealed to David Letterman he once drank 117 beers, but he couldn't remember because he passed out.Besides, the wrestler suffered from a pituitary gland disorder that caused his body to produce too much growth hormone. This led to continuous enlargement of his organs, bones, and tissues throughout his life. Andre's large size and weight put a lot of strain on his heart and cardiovascular system, which is a common issue for people dealing with untreated acromegaly. This possibly could have caused a cardiac arrest for his sudden death.It’s been over 30 years since his passing away, but Andre the Giant is still remembered by his fans for his larger-than-life persona, his reign in the wrestling business, and his unforgettable roles in pop culture.","Wwe legend andre the giant passed away on january 28, 1993, of an apparent heart attack in his sleep in paris.
