Wayne Gretzky and Gary Bettman to follow Alex Ovechkin’s historic chase

Hockey history waits to be rewritten, and the all-time leading goal scorer, Wayne Gretzky , will be there to see it. The Great One will be on hand for games as Alex Ovechkin approaches breaking his historic mark of 894 career goals.With only eight goals to reach and 16 games left in the Washington Capitals' regular season, the excitement is building to a fever pitch. The NHL is going all out to celebrate this historic milestone, including a special in-arena ceremony when Ovechkin finally scores goal number 895.NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman will also be tracking Ovechkin’s journey across North America. Though details on when Wayne Gretzky and Bettman will begin attending games remain unclear, their presence underscores the significance of this record-breaking moment.""Alex Ovechkin's pursuit of the NHL's all-time goal-scoring record is a major milestone not just for hockey, but across the entire sports world,"" said Jon Weinstein, the NHL’s chief communications officer. ""We're looking forward to marking this historic chase in multiple ways that reflect the magnitude of this incredible moment.""Unlike Gretzky, who established his goal-scoring marks early in his career with jaw-dropping seasons of 92, 87, 73, and 71 goals, Ovechkin has sustained his dominance over more years. The 39-year-old has reached an incredible nine 50-goal seasons and has reached at least 40 goals 13 times. Even after breaking his left leg earlier this season, he only missed 16 games, showing the resilience that has characterized his career.The pursuit of 895 occurs in the midst of unusual circumstances. Ovechkin has played under a lockout-compressed season, two COVID-interrupted seasons, and the Russia-Ukraine war, adding another layer to his legacy. Others would suggest that if it weren't for those interruptions, he would already be over Gretzky.Also Read: Wayne Gretzky: The Great One reflects on his legacy, Hockey culture, and life lessons amid ongoing backlash With the NHL and hockey world in attendance, Ovechkin's quest to break Gretzky's goal record is more than a player milestone—it's a tribute to two eras of hockey greatness.

Aaron Judge pushes for Sandy Alcantara after Gerrit Cole’s injury

Can the Yankees fix their pitching problems?

Mets SP Clay Holmes + Can Yankees Survive Without Gerrit Cole? | The Show Ep. 140

The New York Yankees are in trouble. Their best pitcher, Gerrit Cole, is out for the season with an injury, and the team’s rotation looks weak. Yankees captain Aaron Judge knows they need help fast. He has his eyes on Miami Marlins pitcher Sandy Alcantara, a player who could save their season. But getting him won’t be easy. The Yankees will have to make a tough decision soon.Aaron Judge has made it clear—he wants the Yankees to go after Sandy Alcantara. The Miami Marlins’ pitcher was one of the best in 2022, throwing 228.2 innings with a 2.28 ERA. He is exactly the kind of strong and reliable pitcher the Yankees need right now.But getting Alcantara won’t be simple. He is under contract with the Miami Marlins until 2028 and will make $17.3 million in both 2025 and 2026, with a $21 million option for 2027. That makes him an expensive and valuable player.The Marlins won’t let him go without a big trade return. Reports suggest the Yankees would have to give up top young players like Jasson Domínguez, Anthony Volpe, or Austin Wells to even start trade discussions.That’s a tough decision. The Yankees have spent years developing these young stars, and trading them away could hurt their future. But without a top pitcher, their current season could fall apart.The Yankees’ pitching is in a bad spot. Carlos Rodon, who had a 3.96 ERA in 2024, hasn’t been consistent. Clarke Schmidt had a solid 2.86 ERA in 2024, but he’s still young and unproven. Marcus Stroman pitched well last year but has had injury problems before. Without Gerrit Cole, the team doesn’t have a true ace.The Yankees know they need help. Other options include pitchers like Dylan Cease or free agents like Jordan Montgomery and Lance Lynn. But none of them offer the same level of stability that Sandy Alcantara does.Now, the Yankees have a choice to make. Will they trade for the pitcher Aaron Judge wants, even if it means giving up top prospects? Or will they risk going into the season with an uncertain rotation? Time is running out, and the decision could define their season.Also Read: Aaron Judge And Samantha Bracksieck’s Relationship Timeline: Exploring Couple’s High School Romance","New york yankees captain aaron judge wants to sign miami marlins pitcher sandy alcantara.

Is Rodgers headed for a coaching role in San Francisco?



Aaron Rodgers Caught Deeply Contemplating His Future On Beach | Pat McAfee Show

Why the 49ers and Why now?



Aaron Rodgers’ future in the NFL remains one of the biggest talking points in football. While teams like the Pittsburgh Steelers and New York Giants are rumored to be in the mix, a surprising alternative has emerged—coaching. Reports suggest Rodgers may step away from playing in 2025 and join the San Francisco 49ers ’ staff, potentially setting the stage for a major leadership role in the future.Rodgers has repeatedly dismissed the idea of coaching post-retirement, but circumstances change. As one of the most intelligent quarterbacks in NFL history, he possesses the strategic mind that could make him a successful coach. With insiders predicting that he may not suit up in 2025, some believe he could step into a coaching role with the 49ers, possibly positioning himself as Kyle Shanahan ’s eventual replacement.""While Kyle Shanahan is safe for the 2025 NFL season, there is a real chance that his future in 2026 is not,"" Marissa Myers noted. ""With that in mind, it presents the perfect opportunity for Rodgers to take the next step in his career, and enter the realm of coaching."" (via: Sporting News)Also Read: Steelers set to sign veteran QB in 2025 Free Agency, but it’s not who you think Shanahan has guided San Francisco to multiple deep playoff runs, but his tenure has also been marked by inconsistency. With four playoff misses in eight seasons, concerns about his long-term viability continue to grow. Critics argue that his inability to adapt is holding the 49ers back. Rodgers, a four-time MVP, could bring a fresh perspective and serve as a mentor for young quarterback Brock Purdy, helping the team transition into its next phase.Adding to the intrigue, Rodgers’ California roots make this move even more compelling. A lifelong 49ers fan, he once dreamed of being drafted by them. If he transitions into coaching, leading his hometown team would be a full-circle moment in his storied career.Rodgers remains unpredictable, keeping fans and analysts on edge. But if he decides to swap his helmet for a headset, the 49ers could be his next big move, one that shakes up the NFL landscape and redefines his legacy.","Reports suggest aaron rodgers may step away from playing in 2025 and join the san francisco 49ers ’ staff.

However, Friday also marked a major shift in the Iowa basketball landscape, as longtime men’s basketball head coach— Connor’s father— was dismissed from his role after 15 seasons. Caitlin Clark and her boyfriend, Connor McCaffery, were spotted together in public after Fran McCaffery’s tenure at Iowa came to an abrupt end.McCaffery's tenure as the Iowa head coach was a success, however, he was not able to push the team past the Round of 32 in the NCAA Tournament. Many believe it has ultimately led to his departure. The Hawkeyes posted a 297-207 overall record and made seven NCAA Tournament appearances under his leadership.McCaffery's best season came in 2021-22 when Iowa finished 26-10 and secured its first Big Ten Tournament championship since 2006. The team was led by Keegan Murray, who later became the fourth overall pick in the 2022 NBA Draft.McCaffery’s final season fell short of expectations. Iowa ended the regular season at 17-16, struggling in conference play with a 7-13 record. Following their second-round loss to Illinois in the Big Ten Tournament also raised questions about McCaffery’s future.Eventually, the program parted ways with the 65-year-old coach. Iowa will now pay out McCaffery’s $4.2 million contract buyout, originally set to run through 2028.The news of Fran McCaffery’s firing sparked a reaction from former Iowa standout Luka Garza . The current Minnesota Timberwolves center took to X to share a heartfelt message: “Thank you Coach for changing my life, and the lives of so many others. You believed in a way that not many others did. Choosing to play in the black and gold was the best decision I have ever made for a lot of reasons, but mainly because I was able to be coached by you.” Clark showed her support by retweeting Garza’s post.Connor McCaffery, Fran’s son and Clark’s boyfriend, played 166 games for his father at Iowa and currently works as an assistant coach at Butler.

Steve Kerr Explains Why He Told Jimmy Butler to Break NBA’s Unwritten Rule

Jimmy Butler’s Triple-Double Overshadowed by Controversial Shot

Jimmy Butler single handedly forces a shot clock violation

Gary Payton II Scores Career-High 26 Points to Lead Golden State Warriors to Victory

What should have been a straightforward win for the Warriors turned into a mess after the game. Jimmy Butler 's triple-double was overshadowed by a last-second shot that really upset the Portland Trail Blazers players — and it looked like it got under Butler's skin too. A video from after the game showed a tense moment between him and coach Steve Kerr , who later revealed he was the one who told Butler to take that shot. Here’s the whole story behind that unexpected twist.As the clock wound down in the Warriors' 130-120 win over the Portland Trail Blazers, Jimmy Butler was in a bit of a bind. With Golden State comfortably ahead and only a few ticks left, he had to choose between holding the ball or taking a shot. Usually, teams would just let the clock run out in these moments. But after a quick glance at Steve Kerr on the sideline, Butler decided to take an open jumper, which ruffled a few feathers among the Trail Blazers players.Footage from after the game showed Jimmy Butler frustrated during a brief but intense talk with Steve Kerr. Kerr later explained his reasoning, saying, “I told him, we don't do shot clock violations. If there’s a shot clock differential, we always shoot.” Kerr’s firm stance on this philosophy put Butler in a tricky situation, even though he seemed a little reluctant on the court.Butler had a standout performance that evening! He scored 15 points, pulled down 10 rebounds, and tallied 10 assists, marking his second triple-double this season and his first as a Warrior. His previous triple-double was on December 16 while he was with the Miami Heat. The Warriors are sitting pretty with a 12-1 record when Butler plays, highlighting his significant role in their success.While all this is happening, Stephen Curry keeps shining this season, hitting five 3-pointers and bringing his total to 251. This is his 11th season with 250+ threes, which is an NBA record. He’s just two 3-pointers away from being the first player to hit 4,000 career triples.Even with the fuss going on, the Warriors' depth was a key factor in their victory. Gary Payton II had an impressive night, scoring a career-high 26 points and tying his record with four 3-pointers. Buddy Hield also made his mark with six 3-pointers and 20 points, showing off the Warriors' strong offensive lineup.The arguments between Jimmy Butler and Steve Kerr after the game definitely caught some attention, but it doesn't take away from how well the Warriors played. With Stephen Curry on the verge of hitting a major milestone and Butler stepping up with his all-around skills, Golden State is proving they're a force to be reckoned with.Also Read - Shai Gilgeous-Alexander vs Nikola Jokic: Who Truly Deserves the 2025 NBA MVP?

Will Rohit Sharma win 2027 World Cup? Astrologer Lobo predicts after getting Champions Trophy bang on!

NEW DELHI: Star Indian batter Virat Kohli dropped a major hint about his cricketing future on Saturday, admitting that he ""might not have another Australia tour in him."" Kohli made the candid revelation while speaking at the Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) Innovation Lab after arriving in Bengaluru ahead of the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2025.Reflecting on his recent struggles on Australian soil, Kohli stated, ""I might not have another Australia tour in me, so I am at peace with whatever happened in the past."" The statement has sparked speculation among fans about whether the cricketing icon is considering stepping away from Test cricket in the near future.Despite the speculation, Kohli clarified that he is not mulling retirement at the moment, emphasising that he still loves playing the game. ""Don't get nervous. I'm not making any announcements. As of now, everything is fine. I still love playing the game,"" he reassured his fans. The prolific batter added that he no longer aspires to achieve milestones, instead focusing on playing for the ""pure joy"" of the sport.""It pretty much comes down to just the pure joy, enjoyment, competitive streak, and love for the game. And as long as that is there, I will continue to play. As I said today, I am not playing for any achievement,"" Kohli said.Kohli also shared insights into the challenges of finding the right moment to retire, recalling a conversation with former Indian captain Rahul Dravid. ""The competitive streak doesn't allow you to find the answer [for retirement]. I had a very interesting conversation with Rahul Dravid. He said you always have to stay in touch with yourself. Figure out where you are placed in your life, and the answer is not that easy,"" he explained.The 36-year-old acknowledged that advancing age has made it tougher to maintain peak performance. ""Now, it takes much more effort as people who have played the game for a long period of time understand. You can't do so many things in your mid to late 30s that you can in your mid-20s. I'm at a bit of a different place in my life as well,"" Kohli admitted.Despite recent struggles, including a lackluster performance on the most recent Australia tour, Kohli has come to terms with his ups and downs. ""You have to make peace with whatever's happened in your life. Like in 2014 [against England], I still had the chance to go in 2018 and do what I did. It might not have been the case this time,"" he said.Kohli also touched on his mental approach to failure, emphasising the importance of blocking out external pressure. ""Once you start thinking of the disappointment from the outside, then you start burdening yourself way more. That’s something I've surely experienced in Australia as well,"" he noted.Beyond his own future, Kohli expressed his optimism about Indian cricket and the evolving landscape of women's sports, particularly the Women’s Premier League ( WPL ). He also looked forward to cricket being part of the 2028 Olympics, expressing hope for India to secure a medal.The RCB icon, who remains the highest run-scorer in IPL history with 8,004 runs in 252 matches, is set to join the RCB camp shortly as the team prepares for the new season under new captain Rajat Patidar.","Virat kohli admits he ""might not have another australia tour in him"" the 36-year-old batsman is currently in bengaluru ahead of the ipl.

NEW DELHI: Former India batter VVS Laxman took to social media on Saturday to reminisce about one of the most unforgettable moments in Indian cricket history — the epic 2001 Kolkata Test victory against Australia. As the iconic win turned 24 this year, Laxman shared an emotional post on the platform X, calling it ""a victory to cherish for a lifetime.""Reflecting on the historic triumph, Laxman wrote: ""24 years ago, a victory to cherish for a lifetime, an amazing team effort and a great life example of never ever giving up, how much ever impossible it may seem now. An absolute privilege to have been a part and to contribute in this very special win.""The 2001 Kolkata Test at Eden Gardens is considered one of the greatest comebacks in Test cricket history. Down 0-1 in the three-Test series, India found themselves in dire straits after being bowled out for 171 in response to Australia’s first-innings total of 445. Forced to follow on, India appeared to be heading for a crushing defeat.However, what followed was nothing short of a miracle. Promoted to No. 3 in the second innings, Laxman crafted a monumental 281, the highest individual score by an Indian at the time, turning the game on its head. Teaming up with Rahul Dravid (180), the duo stitched a record-breaking 376-run partnership for the fifth wicket, batting the entire fourth day without losing a single wicket.India eventually declared at 657/7, setting Australia a daunting target of 384 runs. Harbhajan Singh , who had taken 7/123 in the first innings — including the first-ever Test hat-trick by an Indian — struck again with figures of 6/73, bowling out the Aussies for 212 and sealing a sensational 171-run victory for India.The victory remains etched in cricketing folklore as a testament to resilience and never giving up, even in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds.

Did India have an unfair edge in the CT?

How do you look at India’s white-ball dominance? Can it be extended?

How can India become a bigger force in the longest format?

CHENNAI: Legendary Australia fast bowler Glenn McGrath has backed Jasprit Bumrah to make a strong comeback from his back injury, saying that the premier India pacer has to be “smart” about it as he is no longer young. Bumrah missed the Champions Trophy with a lower-back issue and is likely to be unavailable for the first few weeks of the IPL season . McGrath, the director of the MRF Pace Foundation here, also praised India for making the best use of the conditions during their CT triumph and asserted that they did not have an unfair advantage although they played all their matches at one venue.He puts more stress on his body than the other bowlers. He has found ways to manage it, but unfortunately not all the time. He has done it before (making a comeback from injury), he will know better than anyone (about) the recovery time, the time in the gym. He is not as young as he used to be, so he has to be smarter about what he does.He has to work even harder off the field. Being a fast bowler is like driving a car. If you do not top it up with fuel, you are going to run out of fuel sooner or later. My fuel tank was bigger than Jasprit’s because I did not bowl as quickly as him. These guys know how they work at their best. If India are under the pump, they need him.He is an experienced fast bowler and is one of the best in the world. He is unique. I take keen interest in Jasprit and the way he goes. The recent Australia-India Test series showed how important he is to India. If you take Bumrah out of that series, it could have been very one-sided. If he had been fit enough to bowl in the second innings of the last Test (Sydney), you never know. To play five Tests in a row is a massive ask and you have to look after him.The stats say that. Without a doubt, he was unplayable sometimes. It looked like he would get a wicket every over. I would not have minded playing on those pitches.They were the team to beat and they played well. Virat Kohli came back to form, as did the other guys. Australia had their chances in the semifinal, obviously we had a few of our bowlers who were out. The pitches took spin and India played well.It is the way it is. India does not travel to Pakistan anymore. There was only one other thing — the matches had to be played in Dubai. You have to give credit to India, they played to the conditions. They know how to play on spinning tracks. I do not think that they had an unfair advantage. It is like saying there is an unfair advantage if India play all their matches in India, if Australia play all their matches in Australia.Their IPL and T20 cricket has had a positive impact on one-day cricket. India are confident and they know their game well. It is important to protect Test cricket, but ODIs and World Cups are very important as well. India know the ODI game very well. It is a challenge for other teams to come over to India and play well. I like them to be challenged, but India are a quality team.They have quality players, there is no doubt about it. Test cricket needs India to be strong. They have got the batting lineup and the bowlers. They just need to make sure that their second-tier bowlers, who bowl around Bumrah, have the quality.",Glenn mcgrath has backed jasprit bumrah to make a strong comeback from his back injury.

Dwyane Wade Reveals Cancer Diagnosis Led to Kidney Surgery | E! News

The toughest challenge yet—Physically and Emotionally

Dwyane Wade- A legacy that extends beyond Basketball



Basketball icon Dwyane Wade has never shied away from tough battles, but his latest opponent was one he never saw coming. The three-time NBA champion, known for his explosive plays and leadership on the court, recently revealed a personal health scare that left fans stunned. At just 41 years old, Wade was diagnosed with cancer, leading to a life-altering surgery that removed nearly half of his kidney.Since retiring from the NBA in 2019, Dwyane Wade has built a thriving post-basketball career, becoming a co-owner of the Utah Jazz and the WNBA ’s Chicago Sky while also making strides in television and podcasting. But despite his busy schedule, the former Miami Heat superstar knew something was off when he started experiencing unusual symptoms like abdominal discomfort and weak urine flow.Initially, Wade didn’t think much of it. However, given his father’s recent health struggles, he decided to get a full-body scan, a choice that would ultimately save his life. During a candid episode of his podcast, The Why with Dwyane Wade, he shared the moment doctors discovered a tumor in his right kidney, an outcome he never expected.“I didn’t go in for my kidneys, but because I did the full-body scan, they saw something,” Wade explained. The shocking revelation led to a crucial decision in December 2023, when surgery became the only option to determine whether the tumor was malignant. (via: Daily Express U.S.)For an athlete who built a career on resilience, Wade’s battle with cancer was a test of an entirely different kind. The surgery took a significant toll, not just physically, but emotionally.“I think it was the first time my family, my dad, my kids, they saw me weak,” Wade shared. “That moment was probably the weakest I’ve ever felt in my life. One thing you never want to do as a man? You never want your family to see you weak. ”As a father of five and husband to actress Gabrielle Union , Wade’s health scare was a stark reminder of how unpredictable life can be. It also underscored the importance of regular health screenings, a message he hopes to pass on to others.Wade’s impact on the game is undeniable—three NBA titles, a Finals MVP, 13 All-Star appearances but his story goes beyond basketball. His willingness to speak openly about his health battle adds another layer to his legacy, inspiring fans to prioritize their well-being.Also Read: JJ Redick takes the blame after Dalton Knecht’s scary fall complicates Lakers' vs. Nuggets As he continues his post-NBA journey, Wade remains a symbol of strength, proving that even legends face battles and sometimes, the most important victories happen off the court.",Three-time nba champion dwyane wade revealed he was diagnosed with cancer.

India win Champions Trophy title; Rohit Sharma confirms he's not retiring

Dinesh Karthik (C) spoke at the RCB Innovation Labs, Indian Sports Summit in Bengaluru.

Will Rohit Sharma win 2027 World Cup? Astrologer Lobo predicts after getting Champions Trophy bang on!

COUNTRY VS FRANCHISE TALENT IDENTIFICATION

Had India not won the Champions Trophy in Dubai, it is quite conceivable that Rohit Sharma ’s place at the helm of the Indian cricket team would have come under scrutiny. He was on a perilously slippery slope, having fared poorly with the bat in back-to-back series losses against New Zealand and Australia in red-ball cricket. Forget captaincy, his place in the side was questioned. And in Dubai, he faced criticism over his fitness.But success in the white-ball version has shone the spotlight on his leadership acumen. Former Indian wicketkeeper Dinesh Karthik , who was part of the Indian team when they won the Champions Trophy in 2013, watched Rohit and his men’s successful journey from the commentary box recently. He believes Sharma’s leadership skills are second to none.Speaking at RCB Innovation Labs, Indian Sports Summit here on Friday, Karthik said: “In the past nine months, this Indian team has won two massive competitions (T20 World Cup and Champions Trophy). So, I think the sky's the limit for them because they are led by a very able leader in Rohit Sharma. You can see that he’s got the respect of his peers. Most importantly, he walks the walk and talks the talk with how cricket needs to be played.”Still, even with the best leadership, one needs a smattering of talent to go the distance in a multi-team event and the fact wasn’t lost on Karthik. “The beauty of this Indian team is the strength and depth that they have in terms of the number of players that they've got,” he said. “Not many countries today can say that they can field two or three teams in international cricket and have them competing with each other.”Did the IPL have a role in India’s near dominance of white-ball cricket? “India right now is in a very privileged and blessed place where they have such a good assortment of cricketers across skill sets. They could easily compete for the next decade or so considering the assembly line of players that the IPL and Indian domestic cricket are producing. The value in terms of understanding pressure, the big moments is what makes this Indian team really special,” said Karthik, who was in conversation with former England player and commentator Isha Guha and Mo Bobat , Royal Challengers Bengaluru ’s Director of Cricket.The 39-year-old gloveman went on to say: “In a lot of sporting environments, superpowers don’t go on to win tournaments. It’s always a challenge sometimes to just manage and assemble a group of players that produces results.”Once known as the T20 ‘razzmatazz’, Karthik believes the IPL, which turns 18 this year, has ensured a paradigm shift in perception and practice.“For a long time, Team India has been a cricketing nation which used to be happy competing, but now that attitude has changed. We want to win, and fans expect the team to win. That is what IPL has done. The influx of money has meant financial benefits that teams and stakeholders earn and a lot of it has gone back into infrastructure. When infrastructure grows, eventually the quality of sport develops and that’s the two biggest takeaways I think post the introduction of IPL in 2008,” said the current RCB batting coach and mentor.Karthik, who made his IPL debut for the erstwhile Delhi Daredevils, reflected on playing alongside Australian pace Glenn McGrath and the takeaways from it “For me the whole ideology of how Australia played at that time was a massive shock. They felt like a pack of wolves out to win every game. But with IPL, in my first year I got to spend time with Glenn McGrath in close quarters and practice with him. I got to know him better and became comfortable, that helped the confidence and mindset of competing with the best,” he said at the Padukone Dravid Centre of Excellence.Highlighting the difference between talent identification for a national team and a franchise, Bobat, who quit his role as performance director of the England men’s team to join RCB in 2023, stated, “In international cricket we often found that you were trying to really unpick and make sense to identify talent that was playing at a level beneath international cricket and making predictions about whether that talent could thrive at the level above. Coming over to RCB, firstly, it's an international market because you have overseas players. Understanding Indian talent is quite hard because of the volume and unstructured nature of it as well. So, finding talent in India is a much bigger challenge than it is finding it in the UK, but in a good way.”","Dinesh karthik is the batting coach of the royal challengers bengaluru in the ipl.

NEW DELHI: Brazilian football superstar Neymar has been ruled out of the upcoming World Cup qualifiers against Colombia and Argentina due to fitness concerns.The Brazilian Football Confederation announced this decision through a video statement by coach Dorival Júnior, who cited unspecified reasons for the exclusion of Neymar, goalkeeper Ederson, and defender Danilo from the squad.The 33-year-old striker, who recently rejoined his former club Santos in January, last played on March 2 but was substituted due to an apparent left thigh injury. As a precautionary measure, he was rested for the Sao Paulo state championship semifinal against Corinthians a few days later.Neymar's absence has paved the way for Real Madrid's promising young striker, Endrick, to be called up to the national team squad. Ederson's replacement is Lyon's Lucas Perri, while Flamengo defender Danilo has been replaced by his club teammate and Brazil veteran, Alex Sandro.Neymar's return to the national team setup this month marked a significant milestone, as he had been absent for almost 1 1/2 years due to an ACL injury sustained in October 2023 while playing for Brazil against Uruguay. His recent recovery and return to action had raised hopes for his participation in the upcoming qualifiers.Brazil, currently fifth in the South American qualifying standings, faces a crucial double-header, hosting Colombia on March 20 before traveling to Buenos Aires to take on the group leaders, Argentina, five days later.The absence of key players like Neymar, Ederson, and Danilo undoubtedly presents a challenge for the Brazilian team. However, it also provides an opportunity for emerging talents like Endrick and others to step up and showcase their abilities on the international stage.","Neymar has been ruled out of the upcoming world cup qualifiers against colombia and argentina due to fitness concerns.

The first WWE SmackDown as part of their European tour was a remarkable night of excitement, huge moments and a surprising title change.WWE SmackDown was presented from the Olimpic Arena in Barcelona, Spain. This was the company’s first show as part of their European tour and was a night of explosive in-ring matches, some of the loudest fans in the world and top notch main event showdown which saw WWE titles changing hands.The match was made by SmackDown GM Nick Aldis following an altercation that involved all six men in the opening segment. Both sides competed in an explosive back and forth contest that had the fans in Spain on their feet. In the end, Braun Strowman delivered a huge splash and Powerslam on Tama Tonga to pick up the win for his team. However, the action did not stop there as both sides continued to brawl even after that.This was Charlotte Flair’s first match back on SmackDown for the first time since she got injured in 2023. The young upstart, B-Fab, put up a great effort against Flair, but it was not enough to put her down. Flair made her tap out to the Figure 8 and refused to let her go. This led to Tiffany Stratton coming to her aid and a brawl breaking out between them. Even when the Miz TV segment started, they came back outside to continue the brawl. It finally came to an end after Tiffany dived from the top of the entrance screen onto Flair and the security officials.The Miz dismissed fans singing along Cody Rhodes’ theme song with him. This led to Rhodes knocking him down with a punch. He then turned his attention to his WrestleMania 41 opponent, John Cena and told him that should he decides to grace him and the fans with his presence, he will be waiting in Brussels on RAW for him.A backstage altercation made the match official. Damian Priest and Shinsuke Nakamura put up an excellent match for the Spanish audience. A huge back-and-forth action saw Drew McIntyre appear ringside just as Priest was about to put away Nakamura. He avoided the distraction and countered Nakamura.
