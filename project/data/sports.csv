New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon on Thursday played cricket at Mumbai's iconic Wankhede Stadium with Kiwi spinner Ajaz Patel, former batter Ross Taylor, and pacer Trent Boult.During his visit, Luxon reflected on the long-standing cricketing ties between India and New Zealand, which have resulted in some of the sport's most historic moments.Luxon took to Instagram, sharing pictures from his visit to the stadium where New Zealand players Boult, Mitchell Santner, and Bevon Jacobs are preparing for the Mumbai Indians’ (MI) Indian Premier League (IPL) campaign opener against arch-rivals Chennai Super Kings (CSK) at Chepauk Stadium in Chennai on March 23.In his post, Luxon reminisced about Ajaz Patel’s remarkable achievement of becoming only the third bowler in Test cricket history to take all ten wickets in a single inning during a match against India at Wankhede in 2021. He humorously added that despite Patel’s historic feat, he himself was not dismissed by the spinner.""Nothing unites New Zealand and India more than our shared love of cricket. Right here at Mumbai's Wankhede Stadium, Ajaz Patel took the third-best figures in the history of Test cricket. Just for the record, he didn’t get me out,"" Luxon wrote in his Instagram post.Additionally, the Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA) president, Ajinkya Naik, issued a press release praising the visit.""Today, as the President of the Mumbai Cricket Association, it was an absolute honour to welcome the Prime Minister of New Zealand, Christopher Luxon, to the iconic Wankhede Stadium,"" Naik stated.""We took him through the rich legacy of Mumbai cricket, highlighting Wankhede’s role in shaping some of India’s greatest cricketers and its historic moments, including the 2011 World Cup victory. Given the deep cricketing ties between India and New Zealand, it was a proud moment to showcase how Mumbai continues to be a powerhouse of talent and passion for the game."" he added.Luxon’s cricket connection also extended to his official visit to Delhi, where he shared a heart-warming moment with local children, playing a friendly game of cricket with former New Zealand international Ross Taylor. This gesture further strengthened the bond between the two nations.The two countries’ cricketing rivalry was recently showcased in the ICC Champions Trophy Final in Dubai, where India defeated New Zealand. However, in a thrilling Test series last year, the Black Caps halted India’s winning run on home soil by defeating them in the series.","New zealand prime minister christopher luxon played cricket at mumbai's wankhede stadium.

NEW DELHI: Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah on Thursday dismissed speculation about his closeness to the BJP , saying, ""he is not the one who starts one game and ends up playing another.""Speaking in the J-K Assembly, Abdullah said, ""We are not those who start somewhere else and then end up playing another game. We have come to play cricket and with the blessings of almighty will be winners after our five years term.""""The intelligent captain and player is the one who adapts to the situation and changes his tactics and not the game. I have not changed the game as I still wear the white cricketing uniform,"" the J&K CM said.""I was doing fast bowling because the Australian pitches support the pace but the BCCI pitches are meant for spin and now I am bowling spin deliveries. The purpose is that we emerge victorious,"" he added, as treasury benches thumped their desks in approval.While presenting the ' demands for grants ' in the Legislative Assembly , CM Abdullah expressed confidence in successfully completing his term while addressing the BJP's repeated references to the August 2019 developments.Beginning his hour-long address in Kashmiri, he said ""the winter will be over, now snow will melt away and spring will return .""Responding to opposition leader Sunil Sharma's praise for PM Modi regarding Article 370 's abrogation in 2019, Abdullah noted that whilst anticipating external changes, certain aspects within the House remain constant - including debates, disruptions and accusations.""We are the ones who are not afraid of talking on any issue. Our track record says that we never escape a question and we are not the ones who demand questionnaires before an interview. We are not the ones who meet their favourites only.

SALIVA BAN LIFTED

IPL: How will GT, LSG, DC, PBKS, RR fare? Greenstone Lobo predicts

INTRODUCTION OF THE ‘SECOND BALL’ RULE

IMPACT PLAYER RULE TO STAY

DRS FOR HEIGHT AND OFF-SIDE WIDES

NEW DELHI: Over the years, the Indian Premier League (IPL) has introduced several innovative rules, such as strategic timeouts and the Impact Player rule, to enhance the excitement of the tournament. With IPL 2025 set to begin, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has introduced a few more changes while retaining some existing rules.Bowlers will once again be allowed to use saliva on the ball in IPL 2025.This decision was made after discussions with captains from all 10 teams, with the majority supporting the move.The saliva ban was originally imposed as a health and safety measure during the COVID-19 pandemic, but with the restrictions now lifted, bowlers can resume the practice.A significant new rule—the ‘Second Ball’ rule—will be implemented in IPL 2025 to counter the effects of dew in night matches.Dew often hampers bowlers' ability to grip the ball, providing batters with an undue advantage, particularly during run chases.To address this, umpires will assess the condition of the ball after the 11th over of the second innings.If excessive dew is detected, the bowling team will be allowed to use a new ball. This rule, however, will not apply to afternoon matches.The Impact Player rule, introduced in previous editions, will continue in IPL 2025.This rule allows teams to substitute one player during a match, providing more opportunities for uncapped players who might not otherwise get a chance to play.The Decision Review System (DRS) will now include referrals for height-based no-balls and wides outside the off-stump. With the use of Hawk-Eye technology and ball tracking, umpires will have additional support in making accurate decisions.",The board of control for cricket in india (bcci) has introduced a few more changes to the indian premier league. Bowlers will once again be allowed to use saliva on the ball in ipl 2025. The ‘second ball’ rule will be implemented to counter the effects of dew in night matches.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119260661,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-135324,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Meredith Gaudreau on the beauty of ordinary moments

Meredith Gaudreau shares special Johnny Hockey stories with Julie & Cat | Episode 9

Johnny Gaudreau was known for many things—his incredible skill on the ice, his warm personality, and his deep devotion as a husband and father. Even now, seven months after his passing, his passion and spirit remain alive in the hearts of those who loved him, especially his wife, Meredith Gaudreau . A glimpse at their social media pages shows just how much energy and joy he brought into every moment.Johnny and Meredith Gaudreau were together for years, sharing countless milestones—getting engaged, getting married, welcoming their two children—all alongside the excitement of his hockey career. But in a recent appearance on the Never Offside with Julie & Cat podcast, Meredith reflected not just on those big moments but also on the simple, everyday memories that made their time together so special.“I mean, this is like so weird. I love watching Deal or No Deal. I love it; it’s like my favorite show in the world. I don’t know why.I think I mean I don’t want to like end on a dark note, but I was like I was having a hard time watching like all the new stuff without John ’cause like that was our thing, and then but we watched Deal or No Deal all the time. I don’t know why, like, we have like this weird streaming television, and there’s, like, a Deal or No Deal channel, and I just watch it, and I’m, like, mesmerized by it. Like, I can’t get enough of it. It is so weird, but I have to be honest; that’s what I’m watching.”Johnny Gaudreau had no way of knowing just how much his decision to move would mean for his wife and children. He made the choice on his own, wanting to relocate the family closer to other players’ families so that his wife, Meredith, would have a strong support system during the long stretches when he was away for NHL games.Talking about this decision, Meredith said, “We’re like this weird team that we all live in one neighborhood like it’s just boom boom boom, like teammate after teammate, and I’m so thankful for that now, obviously, but we have such a good group.”Also Read: ""The compete was not there”: Former NHL coach blasts New York Rangers’ playoff chances, calls out team for horrific performance Meredith Gaudreau shared how Boone Jenner has become ""Uncle Boone"" to her kids, even dressing as Donald Duck for baby Johnny’s first birthday.

Why the Lakers Could Land Kennard

Luka Doncic of the Los Angeles Lakers (Image via Getty)

Financial Flexibility: Kennard’s relatively low salary demands make him an affordable target for the Lakers Proven Track Record: His consistent shooting numbers demonstrate his ability to contribute immediately Fit with Superstars: Kennard’s skill set complements the playstyles of Doncic and James, making him a valuable addition.

“We’ll see if the magical negotiating tactics that allowed Pelinka to pry Luka away from the Mavs can get to work snagging Kennard away from what will be multiple suitors.”

Theare reportedly setting their sights on adding sharpshooters this offseason, and one name that has emerged as a potential target is. This player could be a key addition to the Lakers’ roster as they aim to build a competitive team around their superstar duo of Luka Doncic and LeBron James Luke Kennard, a six-foot-five shooting guard of the Memphis Grizzlies , has built a reputation as one of the league’s most reliable three-point shooters. This season, he’s shooting an impressive 44.6% from beyond the arc, maintaining a career average of 43.9%. His ability to stretch the floor and knock down shots consistently makes him an ideal fit for the Los Angeles Lakers, who are prioritizing floor spacers to complement their star players.Luke Kennard’s affordability is another factor that makes him an attractive option for the Lakers. Currently earning $9.3 million in the final year of his contract, Kennard has never made more than $15 million annually. This financial flexibility is crucial for the Los Angeles Lakers, who are managing significant salary commitments to Doncic and James.As Colin Keane of the Sporting News notes:Luke Kennard’s NBA journey began when he was drafted by the Detroit Pistons in 2017. After spending two and a half seasons in Detroit, he was traded to the LA Clippers, where he continued to showcase his shooting prowess. In 2022, he was traded to the Memphis Grizzlies, where he has become a key contributor.Now, as an upcoming unrestricted free agent, Kennard is expected to draw interest from multiple teams, including the Los Angeles Lakers. The Grizzlies will likely attempt to retain him, but the Lakers’ front office, led by GM Rob Pelinka, is known for its strategic negotiating tactics.The Los Angeles Lakers ’ offseason strategy revolves around adding cost-effective shooters who can thrive alongside their star players. Kennard’s skill set aligns perfectly with this vision. His ability to knock down threes at a high clip would provide much-needed spacing for Doncic and James, allowing them to operate more effectively on the court.The Lakers' desire to assemble a team with a variety of players is further demonstrated by their interest in Kennard. Dalton Knecht, a rookie shooter, was traded away earlier this season, but Pelinka was able to reverse the transaction and keep him. Knecht's future with the squad is still up in the air, though, which highlights the necessity for dependable shooters like Kennard.While Luke Kennard’s fit with the Lakers is undeniable, the team will face competition from other suitors. The Grizzlies are expected to make a strong push to retain him, and other teams in need of shooting could also enter the fray.However, Pelinka’s track record of successful negotiations, including the acquisition of Luka Doncic , gives the Lakers a fighting chance. As Keane points out:The Los Angeles Lakers’ pursuit of Luke Kennard shows their commitment to building a roster capable of competing at the highest level. His shooting, affordability, and fit with the team’s stars make him a prime target for the upcoming offseason. While challenges remain, the Los Angeles Lakers’ front office has proven its ability to pull off significant moves in the past.Also read: How the Los Angeles Lakers Transformed Into a True Title Contender Ahead of the Playoffs As the offseason approaches, all eyes will be on Rob Pelinka and the Lakers to see if they can successfully lure Kennard away from Memphis and bolster their roster for a championship run.",Memphis grizzlies guard luke kennard is an upcoming unrestricted free agent.

Eddie Jordan’s charismatic media personality

Eddie Jordan leaves his legacy

Eddie Jordan was indeed much more than a team owner; he was a visionary, an entrepreneur, and one of the most flamboyant personalities to grace any sport. Up to the very last minute of his life at 76 years old, he demonstrated his business acumen, ability to spot and develop talent, and flair.On March 30, 1948, Eddie Jordan was born in Dublin, Ireland. Motorsports was somewhat lucky for him in that he was a racing driver. He competed in Formula Ford, Formula 3, and Formula 2 throughout the 1970s, but he soon realized there were no glaring future opportunities in prospect for him as a competitor.In 1979, Eddie Jordan Racing was founded. It then became very much an international racing scene that provided one last avenue for the bright stars of the sport such as Jean Alesi and Damon Hill .Eddie Jordan was also establishing his Formula 1 team in 1991, the Jordan Grand Prix . The team was less well-known in reasonable budgets available to top teams, but quickly acquired its reputation as a team punching above its weight. To complete its daredevil racing spirit, the team redefined its green and yellow livery and so became a public favorite.The biggest memory of the Jordan Grand Prix came in 1998 when Damon Hill brought home the first-ever F1 victory for the team at the Belgian Grand Prix. The next year, Heinz-Harald Frentzen kept the team fighting for the championship with great style, proving yet again that Jordan could play with the best in F1.Best-known was Eddie Jordan for finding the future superstars of the sport. Arguably the most pivotal moment in F1 history, it was he who gave Michael Schumacher his debut at the Grand Prix in Belgium in 1991. His team coined such stars as Rubens Barrichello and Ralf Schumacher.After selling his F1 team in 2005, Eddie Jordan continued to remain a defining presence in the sport as a broadcaster and commentator. Irreverent, funny, and occasionally controversial in his views, he would gain popularity with his appearance on BBC coverage of F1 and then move on to Channel 4.March 19, 2025, marks a day when motorsport will pay homage to Eddie Jordan for having breathed the mortal air at the age of 76. Eddie Jordan was previously diagnosed with bladder and prostate cancer back in December 2023 that had spread to his spine and pelvis. While his death closes the chapter on an era, it won't obfuscate pride but rather motivate a host of future generations in the passion of motorsports about going against the odds.Also Read: Eddie Jordan’s Net Worth In 2025 Career, Family & Legacy","Eddie jordan was born on march 30, 1948, in dublin, ireland.

Despite financial cutbacks, an influx of financiers, and intensified competition to make it difficult to maintain an independent team, his era witnessed the team register very notable success like a 1998 Belgian Grand Prix victory as well as a legendary 1-2 display at the 1999 German Grand Prix and coming in the third position at the Constructors' Championship for the year. In 2005, Jordan sold the team to the Midland Group for an estimated $60 million, retiring as a team owner in style.Outside of F1, Jordan was a prosperous entrepreneur, investing in real estate, media, and entertainment industries. He also proved to be an enthusiastic F1 pundit for BBC and Channel 4, whose loud mouth and tight-knit industry insight made him a favourite across the board.Born on 30 March 1948 as Edmund Patrick Jordan in Dublin, Ireland, Jordan continually relocated between Dartry, South Dublin, and Bray, County Wicklow.He fell ill with pink disease as an infant and had to be moved for fresh air.He attended Synge Street Christian Brothers School. Initially he had wanted to become a priest but thereafter followed an accounting studies course in the College of Commerce, Dublin, before qualifying to join the Bank of Ireland's staff as a clerk. His existence was transformed in a 1970 bank strike when he came across kart racing in Jersey, which would remain his life-long motorsport enthusiasm.Jordan's racing career started when he won the Irish Kart Championship in 1971. He moved through Formula Ford and Formula Three before being obliged to switch his interest by a 1976 leg injury. In 1979, he set up Eddie Jordan Racing, tending to budding drivers like Damon Hill and Martin Brundle. His Formula 3000 team swept the board in 1989 with Jean Alesi taking the championship.In 1991, Jordan jumped to Formula One and set up the Jordan Grand Prix. His outfit was associated with a high-risk strategy and beating best-of-the-breed outfits on the bare minimum budget. Most memorable of all, Michael Schumacher drove Jordan's F1 debut in 1991 before he fell out with Jordan's outfit after the first race to move to Benetton amid controversy.The golden era of the team was 1998 and 1999, with Damon Hill's Spa win and Heinz-Harald Frentzen's championship run in 1999, finishing third overall. But by the mid-2000s, financial and legal issues compelled Jordan to sell his team, closing an era.After coming out of F1 team ownership, Jordan was highly in demand as a motorsport pundit. He started at BBC F1 in 2009 before joining Channel 4, his blunt opinions and tireless enthusiasm making him a celebrity among race fans.Jordan was married to Marie McCarthy, a retired Irish basketball player, since 1979. The couple had four children and shared time between houses in Ireland, London, Monaco, and Wentworth. He was a yachtsman, helicopter enthusiast, and fast car aficionado who enjoyed the high-octane lifestyle of an authentic motorsport legend.Eddie Jordan's transition from bank clerk to racing mogul exposed his entrepreneurial skills, motor racing expertise, and affable nature. His contribution to the sport was deeper than that of a team proprietor, influencing scores of careers and shaping modern-day F1. Rooted in both business and entertainment, Jordan's legacy as a motorsport personality will resonate for generations.","Eddie jordan obe was a renowned retired racing driver, businessman, and media personality whose net worth was estimated at $600 million in 2025.

NEW DELHI: Indian cricketer Yuzvendra Chahal 's advocate, Nitin Kumar Gupta, addressed the media on Thursday, confirming that the court has granted the decree of divorce, officially ending the leg-spinner's marriage with Dhanashree Verma .""The court has granted the decree of divorce. The court has accepted the joint petition of both parties.

Roughly 50 percent of all Indians who travel to Australia travel to Melbourne Brendan McClements

Q. Do you consider the Victorian government's decision to not host the Commonwealth Games to be a blow to the travel plans?

Jasprit Bumrah breathes fire in the nets at MCG

Q. But surely more people would have travelled for the CWG if not for the cancellation. Are you disappointed?

Q. What about Melbourne for rest of the year? When no Boxing Day Test, tennis, Formula 1. How do you keep everyone interested then?

For long Melbourne has been a global sporting and cultural hub, attracting visitors from China, India, and beyond. During the summer, at the heart of it lies the sporting calendar. From iconic events like the Boxing Day Test - which broke attendance and viewership records this time during Australia vs India; the Australian Open , the Formula 1 race to a first-time ever Pro Kabaddi League, the city offers a diverse blend of sports, food, and festivals.In a conversation on the sidelines of the Australian Open in Melbourne, Brendan McClements , CEO of Visit Victoria , sheds light on how Melbourne leverages these major events, its partnership with Cricket Australia , and how the city's multicultural charm boosts tourism and attract Indian travellers to Victoria.Yeah, well I think I'd extend it. I'd put December in there because of cricket (Boxing Day Test) obviously. First cricket, then to the tennis (Australian Open) and to the Grand Prix (Australian GP), it's just a fantastic time of year if you're a sports lover. And then it's not so visible on the broadcast but underneath that, Melbourne also has its Food and Wine Festival, its Comedy Festival, its Fashion Festival.This is a really good time to be experiencing Melbourne, whether you're Melburnian or a visitor, there's a lot of choices that are available for people. And this year in particular with Boxing Day and with obviously the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, as well as Kabaddi, the PKL, and then we're rolling into tennis and then we'll see where we go from here. But it's a fantastic time of year to be in Melbourne.This is the first time we've had a complete relationship with Cricket Australia. And so the experience we've had from our perspective has been fantastic with Border-Gavaskar Trophy. Obviously we're really blessed to have the MCG , an iconic stadium.This year with India coming through and the passion we know India possesses for that sport, and then the Australian-Indian rivalry, everything came together really well for us this year. The rivalry, the cricket itself, the players did a brilliant job. So the cricket was great.We put ourselves in the right position to get the outcome we did. The relationship with Cricket Australia, we have a great stadium, we know the Boxing Day Test is iconic, and then all of those together produced what we saw. And it's fantastic to think the most viewed series ever, the most attended match ever.We've got the Ashes this year so we know what level we've got to beat.So what we've done with Cricket Australia is said, 'How do we make sure as many people as possible experience the Boxing Day Test?' So the opportunity is to bring more people through the gates, and we've said to them, we want to work with you on that basis. If we're going to be partners in promoting the cricket, well, from our side, what we want to see is more and more people coming.So this year was great because obviously the biggest Test crowd in Australian history. So we give ourselves a tick about what we wanted to do, and it was great to work with Cricket Australia. We're lucky in Melbourne as well because we're quite a diverse, multicultural city, and one of the great communities we have is the Indian community, and we saw them come out in spades and support, whether it was India or they supported Australia, maybe second generation, but again, that made the experience even better.I thought it was fantastic and the feedback we're getting is equally the same. It was really great to have in Melbourne a sport that showcases Indian culture, not just the sport itself, but a partner in JioStar, they brought the whole show to town. So announcers, entertainers, experience, the match production, it was all based on what we see at a PKL game in India, and I thought the crowd really enjoyed it.So 5,000 people in the venue experiencing what it looked like to be in India. I went to Noida to see the PKL game there so it was a faithful representation of the excitement that goes from PKL game. So the Australian crowd reacted well to it and we understand in India we're still getting our numbers through, but the response has been fantastic.You know, the audiences, the people who viewed it, we ran a competition with Star Sports, we had a fantastic response to that. So we feel really strongly that it added a lot to it, and then having cricket, kabaddi, tennis all coming together, it's been a brilliant time to be a sports fan or a visitor to Melbourne.Oh, absolutely, yeah. I think one of the things that we've seen is the power of our partner in Star Sports in particular. Obviously, India from a travel perspective is one of the emerging superpowers in the world. So it's one of those markets that the world continues to recover from COVID.The response to India from Indians to the opportunity to travel has been through the roof. So what we see is an opportunity for those Indians who choose to travel overseas to really try and choose to come to Melbourne. So one of the things that we've learned is the power of the partnership we have through Star, and with Cricket Australia to be fair, because that's one of the parts of it, gives us an incredible platform to showcase Melbourne and Victoria in India.So we think that's the start of the journey, not the finish, but we've seen it. Travel searches for Melbourne were up 46 percent compared to the year before. So people were able to see that reasonably through a couple of providers.So in that period of something in the order of 450,000 Indian searches for trips to Melbourne coming through that period. So there is a hard to say what causes it, but there's an absolute correlation. Melbourne being very visible through Star, through those properties, resulting in potential Indian travellers being far more interested in coming.So we're really enthusiastic about that early review. We've got a bit more work to do about it, but the indications so far have been great. Big crowd in the venue, good crowd watching on TV, and then for us, the sky-scattered data we get about people actually thinking about coming indicates that that really had the effect we were hoping for.India's such a massive market and it is quite unique in each city. Obviously we have direct flights to Mumbai and Delhi with Air India and Qantas, fantastic partners for us. But with other airlines we work with, so you can come to Australia through Melbourne, through Thai, through Malaysia, through Singapore, through Sri Lankan. You can even go via Dubai or the Arabian Gulf if you want to.That means for virtually every part of India, Melbourne is accessible because Thai, for instance, fly 100 times a week from India to Bangkok, and one of their most popular routes is Bangkok down to Melbourne. So we've got an interest wherever the large population centres are, and the dynamics of India are so extremely exciting at the moment, whether it's Hyderabad, Chennai, Amritsar, these cities are all in the mix as being, in their own right, large powerhouses to drive.Not that we've seen. I think what you'll see, since that decision, we've had record numbers for the Grand Prix, record numbers for the tennis, extremely strong domestic AFL football finals. We've seen the growth in international travel. We've talked about the growth out of India.So what we're seeing is consumers are not making a decision about Commonwealth Games. The decision about the Commonwealth Games hasn't influenced the decision of consumers on whether they want to come to Melbourne or Victoria. So they're sort of independent of each other.One decision that's been made, we move on. But what we're pleased with is our numbers continue to grow across all the markets, including some of those Commonwealth markets.I'm not disappointed with the decision. It wasn't my decision to make, and the people who made the decision made the decision. One of the strengths that Melbourne has and Victoria has, we've always had quite a long and committed major events calendar. And for many of those markets, particularly if you think of UK and Britain, this year it's the Ashes.Halfway through the year it's the Lions Tour, the rugby Lions Tour. So we've got strong reasons for those countries to continue to think about coming to Melbourne. So we find ourselves in that position, and for many of them the Grand Prix is a great attraction as well.So we feel on balance that we've got enough diversity across the calendar and across the years to accommodate a decision that was made. And what we're seeing is the decision that was made hasn't impacted consumer decisions about to come to Melbourne or not. And we've got enough offerings in enough variety of things to continue to appeal those markets.So New Zealand with horse racing, India with the cricket, or rugby, Lions, Ashes. We feel lucky that we've got that sort of depth and breadth across our calendar.Yes, so there's a few different ways and it depends on which market you're talking about too. Certainly this time of year there's a real focus on many of the international markets. If I took this year for example though, in the middle of the year that's where we'll have the Lions come.So UK, England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales suddenly become focused on what it means to be in Melbourne. So we have a broadcast platform there. We never lose sight of the importance of the Australian market for us as well.So our Indigenous code, Australian Rules football, continues to flow through the year and then we reach its crescendo, the Grand Final in September. Then we go into horse racing in November. So we've got a horse racing that appeals to certain markets strongly, domestic importantly, but also to New Zealand, a bit to England and Japan.So we've got the ability to take the clay that we've been given and mould it as we need to and we do try and do that over time.Sports is absolutely an important part of it but we also have a strong cultural programme. So Kusama, an exhibition at the NGV at the moment, people can underestimate the power of the cultural offering to drive decisions on coming to.But we're seeing, I think opening in December, already we've had 100,000 people through Kusama exhibition. So it's just the layers of sport, culture, activities, all the things that can plug back into some of those drivers around what people want. The sports platform does allow us to talk about the other things because you're reaching large numbers of people.So that's where we think we can exploit, if that's the right word, our sporting major events to better showcase the diversity of destination. Whether it's wildlife, the penguins, Great Ocean Road, Twelve Apostles, whether it's the food, the culture, the coffee, that's the way in which we're trying to pull it all together.","Melbourne has been a global sporting and cultural hub, attracting visitors from china, india, and beyond.

IPL: How will GT, LSG, DC, PBKS, RR fare? Greenstone Lobo predicts

After going unsold at the mega auction, all-rounder Shardul Thakur is all set to sign an Indian Premier League IPL ) contract with Lucknow Super Giants (LSG). Thakur has been with the side since their preparations for the 2025 season got underway and will be replacing injured Mohsin Khan in the Rishabh Pant-led squad.The official announcement is yet to be made but it's learnt that Thakur has been informed about the decision and will be travelling with the side to Visakhapatnam for their season opener vs Delhi Capitals.Mohsin picked up an ACL injury which has impaired him from featuring in any cricket for the last three months, and then had a calf strain when he resumed bowling in the LSG nets. With their core group of seamers still recovering at the Board of Control for Cricket in India's (BCCI) Centre of Excellence (CoE), the management was forced to take the call on an injury replacement.The India-heavy pace attack features Akash Deep, Avesh Khan and Mayank Yadav but all are yet to join the IPL franchise. While Akash Deep and Mayank are at the CoE, Avesh still hasn't linked up with the squad after recovering from the knee injury. As far as pace sensation Mayank is concerned, he has started bowling at reduced intensity in the nets but is far from attaining match fitness.From side strain to hamstring to issue in the left side of the back and now the right side, the youngster's body has gone through a lot and he is yet to play a competitive fixture since October last year. Even if the 22-year-old gets an all-clear from the CoE to join his IPL side, it will be nothing short of a miracle if he lasts the distance.The LSG camp is yet to give details of their seamers' injuries and mentor Zaheer Khan insisted that they will follow a dynamic approach this season.""The situation is dynamic for some of our players due to injuries. But it’s time that we look for positives and adopt things to tackle the situation amicably. Some players are at the National Cricket Academy and others are spending time with their physios. Right now, it will not be right to say anything about this. The situation will be dynamic this season,” Zaheer said in a media interaction.In absence of their core seamers, Shardul will now be leading the pack as he is the most experienced bowler in the set-up. Shamar Joseph is the only overseas seamer in the LSG squad which also features youngsters like Rajvardhan Hangargekar and Prince Yadav. While the spin department wears a settled look, the same can't be said about the quicks.","Shardul thakur is set to sign an ipl contract with lucknow super giants.

Prize money for Gambhir, Agarkar and other national selectors too

The Indian team's triumph in the ICC Champions Trophy earlier this month has earned them a whopping cash reward of Rs 58 crore from the Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ), who made the announcement on Thursday.""The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) is delighted to announce a cash reward of INR 58 Crore for Team India following their triumph at the ICC Champions Trophy 2025.

IPL: How will GT, LSG, DC, PBKS, RR fare? Greenstone Lobo predicts

NEW DELHI: Lucknow Super Giants ' (LSG) team mentor Zaheer Khan has set the tone for his team's upcoming Indian Premier League (IPL) season, promising an aggressive and fearless brand of cricket under the leadership of new captain Rishabh Pant Speaking at a press conference on Wednesday, the former Indian seamer emphasised the team's intent to take the game head-on, reflecting the leadership style of their newly appointed skipper.""You will see a fearless approach from this team,"" Zaheer stated, highlighting the mindset LSG aims to bring to the tournament.Addressing concerns over injuries, Zaheer dismissed any negativity, pointing to Pant's resilience as a key factor in shaping the team's attitude.""We are not talking about injuries. The captain himself has faced similar challenges, but he has a very positive outlook. The way he approaches the game, the way he puts pressure on the bowlers--you will see LSG play in that manner because the leader sets the tone,"" he said.Pant has been entrusted with leading the franchise this season. Zaheer expressed confidence in his ability to guide the team forward.""We have a very good captain who has been appointed this year to take the team forward. There is a lot of hope from him,"" he noted.Pant's IPL journey with LSG could not be more poetic as he would start off his campaign as LSG's skipper against his former side Delhi Capitals at Visakhapatnam on March 24.Pant has represented Delhi Capitals (DC) for his entire IPL career since 2016, scoring 3,284 runs in 110 matches at an average of 35.31, with a century and 18 fifties. He was appointed as the team's captain in 2021 and led them to playoffs in the same season. He was let go by the franchise in 2024 ahead of the mega auction and became the league's most expensive player ever at Rs 27 crore, bought by LSG, who later appointed him as captain in January.While there are speculations over his batting position, one thing is for sure: Pant fans are in for a thrilling ride!Pant was also a part of India's ICC Champions Trophy-winning team recently; however, he did not get to play a match. Pant has not featured in any white-ball game for India since August, and a bumper IPL season could make him India's first-choice wicketkeeper-batter again.",Lucknow super giants (lsg) have appointed rishabh pant as their new captain.

CHENNAI: When it comes to choosing an all-time IPL XI, it is impossible to keep Suresh Raina out of it. The left-hander was an integral part of four title wins for Chennai Super Kings and made the No. 3 spot in the franchise his own for more than a decade.During an interaction facilitated by IPL’s official broadcaster JioStar, Raina spoke about CSK’s chances, what makes Shreyas Iyer a great T20 captain, Rishabh Pant’s tough challenge at Lucknow Super Giants and a lot more.Iyer can change their fortunes with the help of Ponting and a lot of great batters around him. Iyer’s batting has been phenomenal. He has the captaincy skills; he has won the IPL. I will be keen to see the way he can change Punjab’s fortunes. I have seen Ponting; he is strong with his planning and he is intense.If you look at his captaincy, he is cheerful and innovative. He has calmness and he is an astute leader. I want him to bat at No. 3 but if I look at their squad, I think he will bat at No. 4. Probably, he can play the role of a finisher for LSG. His IPL season could change his T20 fortunes.Some of their bowlers like Mayank Yadav, Mohsin Khan and Avesh Khan are injured. The attack does not have experience. It is important to have a quality fast bowler to qualify for the playoffs. Pant is going into the IPL without a quality fast bowler and has a lot of homework to do. But Zaheer Khan (mentor) has heaps of experience and will gel well with Pant.Everyone talks about his fitness and wicketkeeping, but not many talk about how much power he generates from his backlift. He goes to Chennai one month before the start of the tournament. He bats for three to four hours every day and does match simulation.The spin department is very good. Ravichandran Ashwin is a local boy. He would want to finish well at CSK. He can bowl in different situations. Ravindra Jadeja is good in all three departments and then there is Noor Ahmad. While Jadeja can contain runs and create pressure at one end, Noor will bring quality and provide the breakthroughs. Foreign batters will have a challenge playing in Chennai, so the Indian batters will have to do most of the work.Rachin Ravindra has been in very good form. Having him with Ruturaj Gaikwad, it becomes easier when they play in Chennai. We will have to see who they are going to play in the middle order – Rahul Tripathi, Deepak Hooda or Vijay Shankar. The batters have to spend time on the Chennai pitches, especially in the 7-to-11-over period.","Suresh raina says shreyas iyer is a great t20 captain. The punjab kings batsman can change his side's fortunes, says raina. Raina also talks about rishabh pant's tough challenge at lucknow super giants.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119238534,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-60770,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Deion Sanders hints at revealing NFL QB coach who doubted Shedeur's attitude ahead of draft season



An Anonymous NFL QB Coach called Shedeur Sanders ""Brash"" & ""Arrogant"" after the NFL Combine 😳

Colorado head coach Deion Sanders is not taking kindly to the criticism directed at his son, Shedeur Sanders . Reports surfaced that an unnamed NFL quarterbacks coach from a team with a top-seven draft pick described Shedeur as ""brash"" and ""arrogant,"" sparking an intense reaction from Coach Prime.During Colorado’s Pro Day, which aired on NFL Network, Deion Sanders did not hold back in addressing the situation.""We like to call that stuff out, though. I know who it is. You're gonna make me call him out. You know what team... Don't make me pull behind the curtain, step in that thing,"" Sanders remarked in his signature unapologetic style.His frustration was evident as he continued, ""I'm trying my best to keep it on the high road, but I don't know the address.""This response came after NFL insider Josina Anderson reported on March 3 that a quarterbacks coach from a team with a top-seven draft pick had voiced these negative opinions about Shedeur Sanders to multiple people. The teams in that range include the Tennessee Titans, Cleveland Browns , New York Giants, New England Patriots, Jacksonville Jaguars, Las Vegas Raiders, and New York Jets.Anderson further elaborated that the coach’s criticism was tied to a broader issue with modern athletes who achieve fame and financial success before even stepping onto an NFL field. However, it was noted that several people within the coach’s organization strongly disagreed with this characterization of Sanders.Shedeur Sanders remains one of the most intriguing prospects in the upcoming NFL Draft. While he has been projected as a potential top-10 pick, there has been speculation that negative narratives emerging from the scouting combine could cause him to slide further down the board.NBC Sports' Matthew Berry reported that two individuals from separate teams, who met with Sanders at the NFL combine, claimed that the quarterback ""came off as unprofessional and disinterested."" However, Sanders and his camp quickly countered this notion.In an effort to set the record straight, Deion Sanders shared a report from Cleveland.com’s Mary Kay Cabot, which stated that the Cleveland Browns—who hold the No. 2 pick in the draft—found Shedeur ""confident and engaging"" during their interview. This conflicting feedback highlights the divisiveness of Shedeur's perceived demeanor.Deion Sanders has never been one to shy away from controversy, and he is ensuring that his son’s reputation is not unjustly tarnished. His comments during Pro Day were a clear indication that he is willing to go to battle for Shedeur, even hinting at revealing the identity of the coach who made the remarks.""We like to call that stuff out,"" he emphasized, reinforcing his stance against narratives he deems unfair.Beyond the NFL Draft drama, Coach Prime remains confident in Colorado's future. Despite the departure of Shedeur and star cornerback Travis Hunter, Sanders believes that the Buffaloes will be even stronger in 2025. His unwavering belief in his program and his players continues to be a defining trait of his leadership.Also Read: Could Tyreek Hill be a draft-day surprise?

What’s Next for Jonathan Kuminga?

""Kuminga isn’t going to demand max money, so he might be a prudent signing for Brooklyn.""

Theare facing a pivotal offseason, with one of their most critical decisions revolving around star forward. As the team navigates a challenging financial landscape, the possibility of Kuminga hitting free agency has sparked speculation about his future. Could the Brooklyn Nets , one of the few teams with significant cap space, swoop in to secure the young talent?The Golden State Warriors are already committed to paying their star trio of Stephen Curry , Jimmy Butler, and Draymond Green nearly $160 million next season along with the money owed to Buddy Hield and Moses Moody, and Golden State is firmly entrenched in luxury tax territory. Re-signing Kuminga, who reportedly seeks a deal worth around $30 million annually, would only deepen their financial woes.Despite Kuminga’s potential, the Warriors’ reluctance to offer him an extension earlier this season speaks volumes. As Colin Keane of the Sporting News , the original writer of the article, notes:This leaves the door open for other teams to make a play for the former No. 7 overall pick.The Brooklyn Nets are one of the few teams positioned to take advantage of this situation. With significant cap space and a clear rebuild underway, the Nets could view Jonathan Kuminga as a perfect fit for their long-term plans. Here’s why:- Cap Space Advantage: The Nets have the financial flexibility to offer Kuminga a deal slightly above what the Golden State Warriors are willing to pay, without jeopardizing their ability to pursue other high-profile players.- Rebuilding Mode: Brooklyn is in the midst of a rebuild, making a young, high-upside player like Kuminga an attractive addition to their roster.- Max Player Potential: Signing Jonathan Kuminga wouldn’t prevent the Nets from pursuing a max-level free agent, especially if they choose not to re-sign Cam Thomas or Day’Ron Sharpe.While the Golden State Warriors ’ financial constraints make a Kuminga departure seem likely, his performance in the upcoming playoffs could change the narrative. If Kuminga shines on the big stage and helps Golden State make a deep playoff run, the Warriors might feel compelled to re-sign him, even if it means making tough financial decisions.However, the more probable scenario is an early playoff exit for the Warriors in the highly competitive Western Conference. If that happens, Jonathan Kuminga could hit the open market, putting the Nets in prime position to make a move.Here’s a breakdown of the key factors influencing Kuminga’s future:The coming months will be crucial for Jonathan Kuminga . If the Golden State Warriors decide to move on, the Nets emerge as a logical destination. Brooklyn’s cap space, combined with their rebuilding phase, makes them an ideal suitor for the young forward.
