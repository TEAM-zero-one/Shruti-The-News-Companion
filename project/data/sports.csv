Undisputed WWE Championship: John Cena vs. Cody Rhodes (c)



After a thrilling night 1, WrestleMania 2 featured several high-octane matchups, including the highly anticipated headlining match, Cody Rhodes vs. John Cena , as the WWE veteran challenged Rhodes for his championship he held for a year. The night was filled with action and astonishing drama, with 63,226 in attendance as announced by Stone Cold Steve Austin. Here are the results and highlights of WrestleMania Night 2 on April 20.WrestleMania Sunday kicked off with a wild Triple Threat Match between IYO SKY, Rhea Ripley, and Bianca Belair. From the opening bell, it was nonstop chaos. Belair and Ripley initially clashed while SKY inserted herself with fast-paced offense. The crowd was red hot as each woman delivered huge moments, including Ripley’s headbutts, Belair’s signature power moves, and SKY’s high-flying attacks. Multiple near-falls kept fans on edge, and the energy built to a wild finish. After surviving a KOD, SKY landed her Over the Moonsault on Belair just in time, scoring the pin to retain the Women’s World Championship in a show-stealer.Drew McIntyre and Damian Priest went to war in a brutal Sin City Street Fight. McIntyre came out swinging before Priest battled back with weapons and hard shots outside the ring. Both men dished out punishment using chairs, steps, and tables. The chaos peaked when Priest sent McIntyre through a table with a Razor’s Edge. However, the Scottish Warrior survived and hit a DDT on the steel steps. In the final moments, Priest tried walking the ropes, but McIntyre launched him through two tables. One last Claymore, smashing Priest’s head into a wedged chair, sealed the win for McIntyre.Dominik Mysterio kicked things off with a lucha mask mishap. Once the bell rang, chaos erupted in the squared circle. Bron Breakker bulldozed through everyone, but Penta’s aerial offense kept him in the fight. Balor, Penta, and Mysterio all had their moments, with wild sequences and near falls. Carlito tried to interfere, but Breakker sent him crashing through a table. In the final stretch, Balor hit Coup de Grace on Breakker, only for Mysterio to fly in with a Frog Splash to steal the pin. In a wild and unpredictable match, Dominik walked out victorious.Randy Orton made his entrance to a thunderous roar at Allegiant Stadium. Celebrating his 20th WrestleMania, Orton vowed to deliver another RKO moment, this time against a surprise opponent, TNA World Champion Joe Hendry. The match was quick and energetic. Hendry showed off strength and charisma, even landing a fallaway slam and a kip-up. But as he celebrated, Orton struck with a sudden, picture-perfect RKO to seal the victory.AJ Styles and Logan Paul battled in a fast-paced, back-and-forth showdown. Styles came out aggressive, but Paul held his own with big moves like the Lionsault and Buckshot Lariat. Both men traded near-falls and signature finishers. Styles nearly stole it after countering Paul’s own version of the Styles Clash. In the end, interference almost tipped the scales, but Styles rejected help. Just as he tried the Phenomenal Forearm, Paul dodged and nailed him with the loaded fist before hitting the Paul-verizer for the controversial win.Becky Lynch and Liv Morgan finally clashed after nearly a year. Morgan played mind games early. Raquel Rodriguez and Morgan dominated Lyra Valkyria for most of the match, isolating her from Lynch. After a hot tag, Lynch exploded with strikes, suplexes, and a near submission before chaos broke loose. Valkyria hit a tornado DDT on Rodriguez at the ringside, and Morgan nearly stole the win with Ob-Liv-ion. But in the end, Lynch countered with a Manhandle Slam to seal the victory.John Cena's final WrestleMania was a wild ride. He battled Cody Rhodes in a grueling match filled with close calls, counters, and chaos. Rhodes kicked out of multiple AAs, and even a referee bump led to more drama. Travis Scott got involved, only to be taken out by Rhodes. When it looked like Rhodes had the upper hand, Cena delivered a low blow and leveled him with the championship belt. The ref counted three. With that, Cena made history to claim his seventeenth World Championship.Also Read: WrestleMania 41 Main Event Results: John Cena becomes the WWE World Champion for the 17th time, the Time is Now!","Wrestlemania 2 featured several high-octane matchups, including the highly anticipated headlining match, cody rhodes vs. john cena.

Shah Rukh Khan: The superstar who turned IPL into a blockbuster

Brief Score:

Gujarat Titans:

Kolkata Knight Riders:

Skipper Shubman Gill’s sublime 90 off 55 balls and a disciplined bowling effort powered Gujarat Titans to a convincing 39-run win over Kolkata Knight Riders at Eden Gardens on Monday. On a tacky pitch that offered little pace, Gill led from the front, crafting an elegant knock studded with 10 boundaries and three sixes.Gill was well supported by Sai Sudharsan, who continued his golden run with a composed 52 off 36 balls — his fifth fifty in six games — becoming the first player to cross 400 runs this season and reclaim the Orange Cap. Their 114-run opening partnership laid the platform for GT’s competitive 198/3, which proved more than enough on a difficult batting surface.Defending the total, Gujarat’s bowlers struck early and often. Mohammed Siraj removed Rahmanullah Gurbaz in the first over, and Rashid Khan (2/25) broke through with the key wickets of Sunil Narine and Andre Russell. The Afghan spinner looked back to his best, mixing pace and length to exploit the slow track.KKR never recovered from their poor start, slumping to 159/8. The chase lost momentum during a 36-ball stretch without a boundary as Ajinkya Rahane (50) and Venkatesh Iyer (14) struggled against GT’s spinners.Prasidh Krishna (2/25) sealed the deal with two wickets in two balls — Ramandeep Singh and Moeen Ali — in the 17th over. Washington Sundar and Sai Kishore bowled tightly in the middle overs, conceding just 55 from six combined overs.With their sixth win in eight matches, GT consolidated their position at the top of the table with 12 points, while KKR slipped further, losing their fifth match in eight games.198 for 3 in 20 overs (Shubman Gill 90, Sai Sudharsan 52; Vaibhav Arora 1/44)159/8 in 20 overs (Ajinkya Rahane 50; Prasidh Krishna 2/25, Rashid Khan 2/25)","Gujarat titans beat kolkata knight riders by 39 runs at eden gardens.

Could Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce be preparing for parenthood? Is this the soft launch of a baby announcement? The internet erupted into discussion, even though there’s no official confirmation—and likely none coming soon.To be fair, Donna Kelce appeared to have liked several comments on the post, not just that one, suggesting it was more a gesture of appreciation than a cryptic hint. Still, in the context of Kelce’s high-profile relationship with Swift, even the smallest interactions can spark wildfire speculation.While rumors swirl, it’s important to consider where both stars are in their lives.

Ajinkya Rahane-led Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) will lock horns against Shubman Gill 's Gujarat Titans in Match No 39 of the Indian Premier League at the iconic Eden Gardens on Monday.KKR suffered suffered an inexplicable meltdown in their previous match, getting bowled out for 95 while chasing 112 against Punjab Kings in Mullanpur. However, the return of Abhishek Nayar will surely boost the struggling KKR outfit.Meanwhile, on the other hand, Titans under the leadership of Shubman Gill, have lost only twice this season and are currently placed top of the points table.Gujarat Titans bowling attack has been a major strength with pacer Prasidh Krishna leading their charge with 14 wickets at an average of 14.35 from seven games. Krishna's ability to outthink batters and vary his length have been the key, as seen in his recent spell against Lucknow Super Giants when he returned with a four-wicket haul. Left-arm spinner R Sai Kishore has taken 11 wickets and could relish the variable bounce and slow nature of Eden surface.The surface at the Eden Gardens has been questioned by the KKR players. Ahead of their must-win fixtures, two pitches have been prepared for this match. One has an extra layer of grass that has not been trimmed. The final decision on the surface will depend on the team's strategy, even as the KKR have conveyed their displeasure at not getting enough ""home advantage"".Quinton de Kock (wk), Sunil Narine, Ajinkya Rahane , Angkrish Raghuvanshi, Venkatesh Iyer, Rinku Singh, Andre Russell, Ramandeep Singh, Harshit Rana, Anrich Nortje, Vaibhav AroraVarun ChakravarthyGujarat Titans Predicted XI: Shubman Gill (c), B Sai Sudharsan, Jos Buttler (wk), Sherfane Rutherford, Rahul Tewatia, Shahrukh Khan, Rashid Khan, R Sai Kishore, Mohammad Siraj, Prasidh Krishna, Ishant SharmaWashington SundarWhile the temperature will be warm and humidity high, there is a low chance of rain affecting the KKR vs GT match.

John Cena’s most memorable WrestleMania matches define an entire generation of WWE. After more than two decades as the face of the company, Cena is wrapping things up at WrestleMania 41 against Cody Rhodes. It’s his final shot to claim that record-breaking 17th world title. But before we get there, let’s rewind. From epic title wins to unexpected losses, here are the WrestleMania matches that made Cena the legend he is today.Cena’s first WrestleMania match was messy, but iconic. Facing Big Show at Madison Square Garden, Cena pulled off a huge moment. Literally. He lifted the 500-pound giant onto his shoulders, dropped him with the F-U (now Attitude Adjustment), and snagged the WWE United States Championship. Sure, he used brass knuckles, but who cares? This moment marked Cena’s rise as a legit star, and it set the stage for the next decade. Not perfect wrestling, but unforgettable for Cena fans.The match wasn’t thrilling, but the outcome changed WWE history. JBL had been WWE Champion for 280 days, and the crowd hated him. Cena stepped up, and the match itself? It was short, not flashy, just straightforward. Cena hit the Attitude Adjustment, pinned JBL, and became WWE Champion for the first time. No fancy moves, no complicated spots, just Cena becoming the face of the company. This victory started the Cena era in WWE.This was Cena’s big test. Triple H, one of the greatest heels in wrestling history, had the Chicago crowd firmly on his side. Cena entered as the champion but faced a hostile arena chanting ""You can’t wrestle!"" Instead of crumbling, Cena stepped up, wrestled a solid match, and forced Triple H to tap out with the STF. Cena retained his WWE Championship and proved that he belonged in WWE’s main event scene. It wasn’t flashy, but it mattered—Cena was here to stay, and the crowd just had to deal with it.Easily Cena’s best in-ring WrestleMania match, and it’s all thanks to Shawn Michaels. Known as ""Mr. WrestleMania,"" Michaels pulled the best out of Cena. They wrestled for nearly half an hour, zero fluff, just pure wrestling and storytelling. Cena locked in the STF again, forcing Michaels to submit. Fans may not have liked Cena, but after this match, they had to respect him. It was Cena at his wrestling peak—no nonsense, no controversy, just the best match of his career.Cena versus The Rock felt unreal, even though it had been hyped for an entire year. The Rock, returning to his hometown Miami, hadn’t wrestled a singles match in nearly a decade. Cena was WWE’s full-time megastar. The atmosphere was unmatched—fans divided, noise off the charts. The match delivered huge spots, both stars trading finishers, until Cena got cocky and attempted a mocking People’s Elbow. Rock caught him, nailed a Rock Bottom, and Cena lost clean. It was Cena’s biggest loss, shocking everyone who expected WWE’s poster boy to win. Sure, they did a rematch the next year, but nothing topped this night—when Cena, for once, was truly humbled.Cena’s WrestleMania legacy is a wild ride. Wins, losses, unforgettable moments. Love him or hate him, these matches made Cena the defining WWE superstar of his era. Now, let’s see if he has one more legendary moment left at WrestleMania 41.","John cena is wrapping things up at wrestlemania 41 against cody rhodes.

Poll Who has the better chance of qualifying for the playoffs? Both teams equally SRH CSK

MS Dhoni's shrewd captaincy has helped CSK bounce back from the worst situations, enabling them to pull off improbable comebacks. Fans expected a similar turnaround for the franchise following the wicketkeeper-batter's return to captaincy after CSK captain Ruturaj Gaikwad got sidelined due to an injury.Also See: IPL Live Score, KKR vs GT However, things have gone from bad to worse for CSK despite Dhoni being the captain, as evident from the team's performances against KKR and MI. The Chennai-based franchise managed to score just 103 runs against the Ajinkya Rahane-led side, suffering a defeat by eight wickets. Fierce rivals MI also pulled off a dominant nine-wicket win as Dhoni watched on silently.CSK are currently at the bottom of the IPL 2025 points table following six defeats in eight matches with a NRR of -1.392.It has been a similar state of affairs for SRH who are currently ninth on the points table after losing five out of seven matches so far this season. The Hyderabad-based franchise has a NRR of -1.217. SRH started the season off strongly, smashing 286 in their opener against RR.However, they failed to maintain the same momentum, recording defeats at regular intervals from that point. Ishan Kishan's form has been a major concern while the bowlers have also struggled to make their presence felt. Even Travis Head has been quite subdued in comparison to IPL 2024.How can CSK qualify for playoffs?CSK will need to win all six remaining matches comfortably in order to stand a chance of making it to the playoffs. The Chennai-based franchise currently has four points, while the top five teams already have 10 points in their kitty.CSK currently have the worst NRR in IPL 2025 which makes the task even tougher for the side. Even winning five out of six matches could prove enough if the teams placed in the top half of the table struggle, considering RCB's qualification for the IPL 2024 playoffs despite having 14 points.Upcoming Matches:April 25: CSK vs SRHApril 30: CSK vs PBKSMay 3: RCB vs CSKMay 7: KKR vs CSKMay 12: CSK vs RRMay 18: GT vs CSKWhat SRH need to do to qualify:SRH need to similarly win all their remaining matches, considering the tough competition for a spot in the playoffs. The Pat Cummins-led side currently has four points in the kitty and the second-worst NRR.However, their odds of making it to the playoffs are better than CSK, considering they've played one fewer game so far than the Chennai-based franchise. CSK and SRH are set to face off on April 25 at Chennai's Chepauk Stadium. The match could well play a crucial role in determining the playoff aspirations of both franchises.Upcoming Matches:April 23: SRH vs MIApril 25: CSK vs SRHMay 2: GT vs SRHMay 5: SRH vs DCMay 10: SRH vs KKRMay 13: RCB vs SRHMay 18: LSG vs SRH","Csk are currently at the bottom of the ipl 2025 points table following six defeats in eight matches with a nrr of -1.392.

Bam Adebayo: The Ideal Frontcourt Upgrade

How Adebayo Fits with the Golden State Warriors

Thenarrowly escaped a Play-In disaster against the Memphis Grizzlies , securing the No. 7 seed in the Western Conference. But even with their postseason spot locked in, changes may be necessary this offseason—starting with moving on from Buddy Hield and pursuing Miami Heat star, as predicted by Caleb Hightower of Sporting News Buddy Hield’s early-season promise as a Klay Thompson replacement has faded. His three-point shooting, once reliable, has plummeted to concerning lows:- December: 30.5% from three- January: 31.5% from three- Play-In performance: 1-of-4 from deep against MemphisWhile Hield finished the regular season at 37.0% from beyond the arc, his inconsistency makes him a liability. As Caleb Hightower noted,If the Golden State Warriors exit the playoffs early, targeting Bam Adebayo in a trade could reshape their roster. The three-time All-Star has evolved into a complete two-way force:- 2024-25 Stats: 18.1 PPG, 9.6 RPG, 4.3 APG- Shooting Splits: 48.5% FG, 35.7% 3P- Versatility: Scores inside, handles the ball, and stretches the floorAdebayo’s growth from a defensive specialist to an offensive weapon addresses Golden State’s need for a dynamic big man.1. Scoring Boost: Provides interior scoring and mid-range efficiency.2. Playmaking: Adds a facilitator from the high post.3. Defensive Anchor: Complements Draymond Green’s versatility.The Trade ScenarioA Hield-Adebayo swap wouldn’t improve the Warriors’ outside shooting, but it would give them a proven All-Star to pair with Stephen Curry and Draymond Green. Miami, meanwhile, could benefit from Hield’s shooting if they retool their roster.Potential Trade Package- Warriors Receive: Bam Adebayo- Heat Receive: Buddy Hield, future draft picks, and/or young playersAlso read: NBA Offseason Rumors: Los Angeles predicted to acquire 6-foot-8 Brooklyn Nets forward to form Big 3 with LeBron James and Luka Doncic Golden State's postseason performance will determine how urgent they are, but it makes sense to move from Hield to Adebayo.

From gridiron greatness to emotional vulnerability



When public image collides with private battles



Even the most successful athletes face challenges that stats and accolades can’t capture—and Tom Brady is no exception. Widely regarded as the greatest quarterback in NFL history , Brady's legendary career boasts an unmatched seven Super Bowl titles, yet behind the shine of championship rings lies a more vulnerable, human side he’s beginning to share with the world.For two decades, Tom Brady maintained a laser focus on football, becoming the ultimate symbol of discipline and competitive excellence. But recently, the 46-year-old has revealed glimpses of his personal struggles, particularly in the wake of his divorce from supermodel Gisele Bündchen . Brady, who is usually tight-lipped about his private life, opened up about the emotional toll of navigating heartbreak, admitting he’s dealt with moments of “willful blindness.”This phrase—suggesting a conscious decision to ignore uncomfortable truths—points to the complexities Brady faced in his marriage’s unraveling. While he didn’t name names, the context was unmistakable, especially given recent headlines surrounding Bündchen's ongoing relationship with her jiu-jitsu trainer, who is now widely rumored to be her partner and the father figure in her children’s lives.“Willful blindness” is not just a phrase—it’s a powerful acknowledgment of emotional compromise. Tom Brady’s reflection reveals the cost of chasing perfection on the field while personal issues simmer in the background. The quarterback, once seemingly invincible both in his career and family life, now speaks like someone reckoning with the pain of being left behind. For fans, it’s a rare and raw admission: the GOAT is still just a man.The emotional fallout of watching Gisele Bündchen move on publicly is undoubtedly difficult for someone so accustomed to control and success. Reports of her being seen with her new partner and children add emotional weight to Brady’s recent comments, suggesting a sense of betrayal or at least loss.Also Read: Fresh discussion on Tom Brady and Gisele’s Bündchen’s marriage reignites debate over missed red flags Brady’s recent openness signals a shift—not just for him but for the culture surrounding sports icons.

3. Intercontinental Championship match

4. Logan Paul vs AJ Styles

5. WWE Women’s Tag Team Championship match

6. Randy Orton vs Joe Hendry(surprise match)

7. Undisputed WWE Championship match

After an enthralling start to the grandest stage of WWE on night one of Wrestlemania 41, night 2 of the yearly spectacle offered a few more earth-shattering surprises and mouth watering contests. A plethora of Championships changed hands and several legends stopped by to entertain the audience in attendance at the Allegiant stadium in Paradise, Nevada.The Scottish Warrior Drew McIntyre faced Damian Priest in a fearsome “Sin city Street fight”. A whole heap of weapons such as tables, chairs, and steps were used between the two towering superstars. First, Priest used his “Razors Edge” move on McIntyre to send him through a table, and then McIntyre hit his signature DDT on the steel steps to Priest. But after a couple of “Claymore’s”, McIntyre pushed Priest’s head into a wedged chair to defeat the “Archer of Infamy” and register a big win.The trio of Bianca Belair, Rhea Ripley, and Iyo Sky went toe to toe, to decide the Women’s World Champion in a highly fast- paced match, which just kept improving until the finish. In the kickoff match of Wrestlemania night two, some chaos of the highest quality was delivered by the three women superstars of WWE. After some magnificent high-flying moves from Sky, Rhea Ripley’s brutal head-butts, and Bianca’s power moves, it was Sky, who came out trumps between the three. Sky hit her signature “Over the Moonsault” on Belair and secured the pin fall to retain her Women’s World Championship in a humdinger of a match.“Dirty” Dominik Mysterio, squared off against Bron Breakker, Finn Balor and Peta in a “Fatal 4 way” match for the coveted title. Although the odds were heavily stacked in favour of Ballor and Dominik, as they are a team, at first it looked like it was Breakker, who was going to retain his Championship. But, after a highly unpredictable encounter, it was Dominik who became the new Intercontinental Champion, by delivering his signature “Frog Splash” on Breakker to win his first major singles Championship in WWE.After going at each other for the last couple of weeks, AJ Styles and Logan Paul squared off against each other in a highly entertaining contest. Although Styles came out ultra-aggressively, Paul had plans of his own to encounter the “Phenomenal One”. After a lot of near falls and close shaves, It was Paul who dodged the “Phenomenal Forearm” from Styles and hit him with his notorious “Loaded Fist”, and then the “Paul-veriser” to seal a famous victory at Wrestlemania 41, night 2.In a pleasant surprise to the audience present in the arena and the whole world, it was Becky Lynch who came out as Lyra Valkyria’s partner to square off against the duo of Raquel Rodriguez and Liv Morgan, for the Women’s tag team Championship. Notably, it was Morgan who Becky had last faced before going on a hiatus from WWE. After a mesmerising contest, and Valkyria taking Rodriguez out at the ringside, it was Becky, who hit her “Manhandle” slam on Morgan to seal the victory and secure her first Women’s tag team Championship.Randy Orton defeated his mystery partner(Joe Hendry) in a highly entertaining match. As Orton was searching for his opponent in his 20th Wrestlemania appearance, TNA World Champion, Joe Hendry’s, famous music hit and he came out to a huge roar from the audience, to challenge the “Viper”. Randy hit him with his famous RKO twice and secured the victory on Joe.In the most awaited encounter of the year, John Cena, who was wrestling in his last Wrestlemania squared off against WWE Champion Cody Rhodes in a brutal contest. After multiple finishers and a lot of near falls, superstar Travis Scott came out to help Cena. Although Cody encountered this interference perfectly and delivered a brutal “Crossroads” to Travis, fate had other ideas. In the end, Cena cheated his way to hit a brutal low -blow to Rhodes and then hit him with the Championship belt on the head to secure the victory. This was Cena’s 17th World Title win, which makes him the record holder for the highest number of World Championships in WWE History.","Wrestlemania 41, night two, saw a number of exciting matches.

Toronto Maple Leafs goalie Anthony Stolarz is moving into the limelight, and not without provocation. On the eve of a crucial game, Don Cherry, the long-time NHL color commentator famous for his blunt observations, made a divisive prediction about the 30-year-old goalie. Don Cherry thinks Anthony Stolarz could be the Toronto Maple Leafs' ‘ace in the hole’—or their worst weakness.The pressure-packed atmosphere surrounding this game is only growing, especially as the Toronto Maple Leafs prepare to host the Ottawa Senators, who took the season series. Don Cherry used in his comments the Ottawa Senators' 14-5-1 run in their last 20 games and general dominance in recent meetings. He seems sure that the Toronto Maple Leafs have every right to believe in Anthony Stolarz between the pipes.Don Cherry, a fellow who gained recognition for his in-your-face hockey commentary , never hesitated to speak his mind. On his podcast, he pointed out the statistics: Ottawa Senators scored on the Toronto Maple Leafs 9-3 in their games this season, and the Maple Leafs were unable to score with a single power play against them. And yet, he thinks Stolarz is the man — but with a condition.""Well, he's the guy that should start. He should start,"" Don Cherry said. ""He might be their ace in the hole. He'll either be good or he'll be really bad.""This is nothing new to Anthony Stolarz, who has had a bumpy NHL path since he was 45th overall in 2012 by the Philadelphia Flyers. With a brief foray into college hockey, Anthony Stolarz set himself apart with the London Knights, building a foundation for a professional career that has required toughness at every turn. From spells with the Edmonton Oilers and the Anaheim Ducks, the goalkeeper now has the opportunity to justify himself for the Toronto Maple Leafs.Now the Maple Leafs are counting on that experience paying off in clutch performances.

What this probable trade means for both teams

Golden State’s new look

Portland’s rebuild continues

Theand Portland Trail Blazers are reportedly discussing a major offseason trade that could shake up both rosters. According to predictions, the Warriors may part ways with Jonathan Kuminga in a sign-and-trade deal to acquire Portland’s high-scoring guardHere’s the proposed deal:- G Anfernee Simons- F Jonathan Kuminga (via sign-and-trade)- SG Moses MoodyKuminga’s future with Golden State has been uncertain for months. Despite being the team’s third-leading scorer at just 22 years old, he was benched in crucial games, signaling a potential exit.As Bleacher Report’s Greg Swartz noted:Key reasons for Golden State:- Anfernee Simons provides immediate scoring (19.3 PPG last season) and playmaking (4.8 APG).- His 36.3% three-point shooting complements Stephen Curry ’s gravity.- At 25, he fits the Golden State Warriors’ need for dependable youth.Portland lacks the cap space to sign Kuminga outright, making a trade their best option. Anfernee Simons, their leading scorer, has only one year left on his contract before hitting unrestricted free agency.- Kuminga (15.3 PPG, 4.6 RPG) adds athleticism to their young core.- Moody (11.0 PPG, 39.4% from three) is on a team-friendly three-year deal.- Both players offer long-term stability alongside Scoot Henderson and Shaedon Sharpe.If the trade goes through, the Golden State Warriors could deploy Anfernee Simons in multiple ways:- Starting alongside Curry, Podziemski, Butler, and Green.- Leading the second unit as an elite sixth man.The Blazers would solidify their young core:- Kuminga and Moody join Henderson, Sharpe, Avdija, and Clingan.- More financial flexibility with Simons’ contract off the books.Also read: Los Angeles Lakers dream trade scenario: Can LeBron James and Luka Doncic form Big 3 with $228.2 million Milwaukee Bucks star? This trade makes sense for both sides. The Warriors get a proven scorer to bolster their title hopes, while the Blazers add two promising young players to accelerate their rebuild.

We felt that Bumrah, being one of the best death bowlers in the world, meant that once they started their death bowling, we should've had the momentum with us.""We should've started going hard slightly earlier before Bumrah was introduced. We needed those runs because 175 was never a par score at this venue.""Dhoni said the approach going forward is to secure a good playing XI for the next match.""I think we need to realize that in order to be successful, you need to play good cricket,"" he said.""We cannot be emotional about it. We have to be practical. We need to see whether we are playing the right form of cricket or not. We dropped a few catches tonight as well.""We will just take it one game at a time.
