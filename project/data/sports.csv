Lack of real match practice for India’s star batters Virat Kohli Rohit Sharma , and Shreyas Iyer could hurt India’s ODI plans leading up to the 2027 World Cup. The recent Perth ODI against Australia was a small warning sign.Kohli, Rohit, and Iyer form India’s top four, but all three are currently playing only one format. Rohit and Virat have retired from T20Is and Tests, while Shreyas Iyer, who has taken a six-month break from red-ball cricket, is not part of India’s T20I setup for the upcoming World Cup in February next year.The Indian cricket team was slated to play 27 ODIs according to the ICC’s Future Tours Program (FTP) 2023–27. The three-match ODI series against Bangladesh, which was scheduled for August, has been postponed, and the first ODI at Perth was not a promising start for India’s quest for the 2027 ODI World Cup. Rohit, Virat, and Shreyas lasted just 46 balls between them, managing only 19 runs.Rohit and Virat were playing a competitive match after a gap of five months and looked rusty. Meanwhile, Shreyas, who has played for India A and in the Duleep Trophy, had his technical flaws exposed again. Both Josh Hazlewood and Mitchell Starc, who stand six feet six inches tall, have a high release point of almost 2.15 metres (nearly 7.05 feet).Whatever length they bowled, the duo generated extra bounce, with almost every ball hitting the top half of the bat. Perth was a bouncy track, and India’s top order looked all at sea.The ball that dismissed Rohit Sharma wasn’t particularly short, but it rose sharply to armpit height outside the off-stump, striking the upper portion of Rohit’s bat. He could have left it alone, but ended up poking at it. The unexpected bounce surprised him; yet it wasn’t due to the pitch — it was Hazlewood’s skill that gave it its sting.Virat Kohli, who registered his first duck on Australian soil, was also troubled by that length. Starc and Hazlewood had troubled Kohli in the past too. In 10 ODI innings, Hazlewood had dismissed Kohli five times — averaging a wicket every second innings. But it was Hazlewood’s new-ball partner, Starc, who sent Kohli back. Kohli went for a booming shot, chasing the ball away from his body, and Cooper Connolly, patrolling at backward point, took a spectacular catch. It was a shot born out of desperation to get off the mark, which we have rarely seen from Kohli in a format where he is an undisputed king.Meanwhile, Shreyas Iyer’s struggles against short-pitched balls are well documented. The newly appointed ODI vice-captain had been prolific in the last two 50-over ICC tournaments. In the Champions Trophy earlier this year, he was India’s leading run-getter with 243 runs in five innings. Iyer had hammered 530 runs during the 2023 ODI World Cup.He had been pivotal in India’s success in both tournaments, but in Perth, Hazlewood exposed a chink in Shreyas’ armour again. Relentless Hazlewood denied Shreyas any width, hitting the deck hard and creating an angle from a good length, which tangled Shreyas up. As he tried to adjust and negate the extra bounce, rising around his ribs, the ball ended up brushing his gloves.The three dismissals have raised eyebrows as the next World Cup will be held in South Africa, where pitches will be bouncy. India will play only two away ODI series to tackle the bounce factor: the ongoing three-match series against world champions Australia, and another against England in July 2026. However, the spice in English pitches has lessened, as it doesn’t suit their “Bazball” approach.In the case of Shreyas, he is playing for India A and, after taking a break from four-day cricket, will likely be available for Mumbai in the Vijay Hazare Trophy. But the big question is whether the two senior stars, Kohli and Rohit, will play domestic 50-over tournaments to stay match-ready. It doesn’t matter how hard they train in the nets; having played enough cricket, they know there is no substitute for real match scenarios.Since Rohit and Virat now play only one format, their rustiness was visible in the first outing. Playing just the IPL won’t guarantee them a spot in India’s 2027 ODI World Cup squad. If they want to pursue their broken November 19 dream and win the trophy in South Africa, they must play domestic cricket to stay match-fit. If they choose not to, they are doing a disservice to Indian cricket and their own reputations.After India’s Test series win against West Indies in New Delhi, coach Gautam Gambhir was asked , “Are Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli still part of India’s plans for the 2027 World Cup?”Gambhir said: “Look, the 50-over World Cup is still two-and-a-half years away, and it is very important to stay in the present. Obviously, they are quality players; their experience will be invaluable in Australia as well. Hopefully, those two will have a successful tour, and more importantly, the team will have a successful series.”Gambhir may have dodged the big question, but he knows the clock is ticking. If he and Shubman Gill want India to take a step forward in 2027, they will need their ageing superstars match-ready. If not, India must blood talents like Yashasvi Jaiswal and Tilak Verma, giving them limited matches to prepare for the 2027 ODI World Cup.","Rohit sharma, virat kohli and shreyas iyer produced paltry returns in the first odi vs australia in perth. All three are currently playing only one format for india. Lack of real match practice could hurt india’s odi plans leading up to the 2027 world cup. The next world cup will be held in south africa, where pitches will be bouncy.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124720281,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-78214,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

"Auston Matthews addresses Anthony Stolarz controversy head-on, reveals what’s really going on inside Maple Leafs camp",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/auston-matthews-addresses-anthony-stolarz-controversy-head-on-reveals-whats-really-going-on-inside-maple-leafs-camp/articleshow/124711726.cms,"Auston Matthews finally breaks silence after Anthony Stolarz’s shocking outburst (Getty Images)

Auston Matthews delivers a steadying message to his teammates





Could Stolarz’s criticism be the wake-up call Toronto needed?

The calm never lasts long in Toronto. When it comes to the Maple Leafs, peace feels more like the pause before the next storm. Just a handful of games into the 2025–26 NHL season, the city already has its newest headline—this time starring goaltender Anthony Stolarz’s unfiltered frustration and Auston Matthews’ cool-headed response. What began as a simple postgame remark has now rippled through the locker room, testing the Leafs’ chemistry and resolve early in the campaign.The Maple Leafs’ locker room has been buzzing since Anthony Stolarz openly criticized the team’s effort after a 4–3 overtime loss to the Seattle Kraken. His words didn’t mince emotions: “I thought the first two periods we kind of let them walk all over us. They just outworked us, plain and simple.” The frustration was clear, and his message was sharper.But in a market as intense as Toronto, even a spark can start a wildfire. Matthews, aware of the brewing tension, chose maturity over mayhem. “We’re a veteran group. We’re all big boys,” he told TSN. “You don’t need to beat around the bush. It’s an easy conversation we all had and you just move on, close the door. We’ve got to be better and we will be.”His words carried both accountability and calm. Matthews didn’t dismiss Stolarz’s remarks—he acknowledged them while emphasizing collective growth.It’s a captain’s response in every sense: owning the moment without letting emotions take over.Anthony Stolarz’s frustration may have stung, but it echoed a truth the team couldn’t ignore. His comparison to Seattle’s Joey Daccord—saying for Daccord “it’s like playing catch in the yard”—was a pointed reminder that Toronto hasn’t been making life hard for opposing goalies. It wasn’t just about one bad night; it was about patterns that need fixing.Head coach Craig Berube didn’t shy away either, acknowledging that “it’s frustration, we all prefer it stay in the room, but it happens. We’ve moved on from it.” Teammate William Nylander also backed the idea that the group must respond, not react. “It’s all good… we know we can play better,” he said.Despite the brief tension, this might be exactly what the Leafs needed—a jolt of honesty to reignite their drive. With goaltender Joseph Woll sidelined indefinitely, Stolarz’s importance has only grown. If his words can light a fire under the team without burning bridges, Toronto might come out stronger.For now, Auston Matthews’ message is clear: it’s time to regroup, refocus, and prove that the Maple Leafs can handle pressure—on and off the ice.Also Read: Connor McDavid and David Tomasek labeled among NHL’s unluckiest players as frustration builds in Edmonton","Anthony stolarz openly criticized the team’s effort after a 4–3 overtime loss to the seattle kraken.

How Giannis Impacts the Milwaukee Bucks Squad

When and Where to Watch the Bucks vs Wizards Game Tonight (October 22, 2025)

in their season opener against the Washington Wizards tonight, despite dealing with lower back soreness. The Bucks’ injury report from October 22, 2025, listed their superstar forward as probable, indicating he is likely to be available when the team tips off its 2025-26 campaign at Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee. This update comes as a relief for fans, especially after a preseason marked by setbacks and missed time due to illness.The Milwaukee Bucks added Giannis Antetokounmpo to the injury report earlier this week because of minor lower back soreness, but his probable status means he is anticipated to play through the discomfort. Although the Greek Freak faced interruptions during the preseason - including a brief absence after testing positive for COVID-19 and an illness that limited his offseason work - he returned in time for the team’s final exhibition games. His performance during those matchups suggested he was regaining form, and his participation tonight would signal that he’s ready to lead Milwaukee from the start of the regular season.At present, the Milwaukee Bucks report no other major injury concerns for their core players heading into the opener. That stability gives head coach Doc Rivers and his revamped roster an opportunity to begin the season on a strong note in front of their home crowd. Giannis Antetokounmpo remains the heartbeat of the Bucks’ system - a two-time MVP and one of the league’s most dominant forces. Following an early playoff exit last season, Milwaukee made several roster adjustments in an effort to strengthen its depth and versatility. Giannis, Bobby Portis, and Thanasis Antetokounmpo are the lone remnants of the franchise’s 2021 championship team, underscoring how much the lineup has evolved over the years.New addition Myles Turner is expected to play a key role alongside Giannis in anchoring the frontcourt, while the team continues to refine its chemistry under Rivers’ leadership. Oddsmakers currently project Giannis Antetokounmpo to score over 30 points in tonight’s matchup - a testament to his offensive load and importance.The Milwaukee Bucks enter the game as favorites against the rebuilding Washington Wizards, who are still developing under head coach Brian Keefe. The Wizards struggled last season and are focused on nurturing young talent, but they’ll aim to make a statement against one of the East’s powerhouses.Beyond the injury storyline, tonight’s matchup carries emotional weight for both teams. Former Bucks forward Khris Middleton will make his return to Milwaukee wearing a Wizards jersey for the first time since being traded. Middleton’s return adds sentimental depth to the opener, as fans will welcome back a key figure from their 2021 title run.From a tactical standpoint, Milwaukee’s primary focus will be on improving its defense and maintaining offensive fluidity. Doc Rivers has emphasized the need for better communication and faster rotations on the floor - areas that could determine whether the Milwaukee Bucks regain championship form. Giannis Antetokounmpo’s ability to play effectively despite the minor injury will serve as an early test of his durability and leadership as the season unfolds.The Milwaukee Bucks will host the Washington Wizards at 8 PM ET at Fiserv Forum. The game will air nationally on NBC and stream live via Peacock. Fans will have the chance to see if Giannis Antetokounmpo can kick off his season with another dominant showing and help the Bucks establish early momentum in the Eastern Conference race.Also read: Is Jayson Tatum playing tonight vs Philadelphia 76ers?

The family’s role in shaping Auston Matthews’ rise

Auston Matthews, the captain of the Toronto Maple Leafs, is one of the most dominant forces in the NHL today. Known for his incredible scoring touch and calm leadership, his rise to hockey stardom didn’t happen overnight. Behind his success stands a strong and supportive family, especially his parents, Brian and Ema Matthews, whose influence shaped his journey to becoming one of the NHL’s biggest stars.Auston’s mother, Ema Matthews, was born and raised in Mexico and later moved to California. She dreamed of becoming a pilot, but due to high training costs and gender limitations at the time, she pursued a career as a flight attendant instead. While working for Aero California, she often flew routes to Los Angeles — a decision that would change her life forever. In addition to her aviation career, Ema also worked for Starbucks, balancing her job with her ambitions and showing her strong work ethic from an early age. Ema’s inspiring journey from Mexico to the United States highlights the multicultural background behind NHL superstar Auston Matthews, one of the league’s most influential players today.On one of those flights, she met Brian Matthews, who was working part-time for an airline while playing baseball at Loyola Marymount University. Their connection was instant, and that spark eventually led to the foundation of a close-knit and loving family. Ema has always been a major emotional anchor in Auston’s life. Her cultural roots and nurturing personality gave Auston a deep sense of discipline and humility that reflects in how he carries himself on and off the ice.Auston’s father, Brian Matthews, is a former baseball pitcher from Loyola Marymount University. A dedicated athlete himself, Brian originally hoped Auston would follow in his footsteps and play baseball. However, when he noticed his son’s growing fascination with hockey, he gave his full support. Brian was instrumental in helping Auston train, practice, and stay focused through his early years in Scottsdale, Arizona. His understanding of athletic discipline and competitive mindset became key influences on Auston’s development.Brian Matthews’ guidance helped Auston Matthews become one of the top NHL stars, showcasing the impact of parental support in shaping elite athletes. Growing up in Scottsdale, Arizona, Auston Matthews trained at local hockey programs that are now recognized as top youth hockey development centers, cementing his path to NHL stardom.When Auston was just two months old, the Matthews family moved to Scottsdale, Arizona — a place not exactly known for hockey. Yet, his parents made every effort to nurture his interest. From taking him to early morning practices to supporting his time with the USA Hockey National Team Development Program and later in Switzerland with ZSC Lions, Brian and Ema stood by every decision.Their constant encouragement and belief shaped Auston into the player he is today — a record-breaking Maple Leafs captain, a multiple Rocket Richard Trophy winner, and one of the most admired figures in the NHL. Auston Matthews continues to lead the Toronto Maple Leafs with unmatched skill and leadership, drawing millions of fans and setting new benchmarks for American-born NHL players. In the 2023–24 season, he made history by scoring 69 goals, the most ever by an American-born player in a single NHL season.Behind Auston Matthews’ incredible achievements is a story of family, sacrifice, and unwavering support. Brian and Ema Matthews’ influence didn’t just help shape a world-class athlete — they helped raise a leader whose talent and humility continue to inspire fans around the world.Also Read: Auston Matthews got the goal, but these Leafs players stole Thursday night in 2-1 OT win over Rangers","Auston matthews, captain of the toronto maple leafs, is one of the most dominant forces in the nhl today.

What to Watch For in Tonight’s Charlotte Hornets vs Brooklyn Nets Game

and ready to take the court tonight as theopen their 2025–26 NBA campaign against the Brooklyn Nets at Spectrum Center in Charlotte. The 24-year-old star point guard, coming off an impressive preseason, headlines a Hornets roster eager to make a strong statement in front of their home crowd.According to the latest injury updates and team confirmations, LaMelo Ball is fully active for the season opener. The Charlotte Hornets will be without only two players - Josh Green, who continues his recovery from left shoulder surgery, and Grant Williams, sidelined after right knee surgery. With the majority of the roster healthy, Charlotte enters Opening Night nearly at full strength.Ball’s return is a major boost for the Hornets after an injury-hit 2024-25 season limited his appearances to 47 games. Despite the setback, he averaged an impressive 25.2 points, 4.9 rebounds, and 7.4 assists per game while knocking down 3.8 three-pointers on average. His ability to control tempo and create scoring opportunities makes him the focal point of the Hornets’ offense.Building on his chemistry with Brandon Miller and Miles Bridges, Ball will now have added firepower alongside newly acquired guard Collin Sexton, providing the team with more speed and scoring versatility.For the October 22 game, the Hornets’ official injury report lists:• Josh Green – Out (shoulder surgery)• Grant Williams – Out (ACL recovery)All other core players - including LaMelo Ball, Brandon Miller, Miles Bridges, Collin Sexton, and rookie standout Kon Knueppel - are cleared to play. LaMelo Ball (PG), Collin Sexton (SG), Brandon Miller (SF), Miles Bridges (PF), and Kon Knueppel (SF/SG hybrid).The Brooklyn Nets enter the contest nearly injury-free, with only Haywood Highsmith ruled out due to knee recovery. Their projected starting lineup features Cameron Thomas, Michael Porter Jr., Nic Claxton, Terance Mann, and Ziaire Williams - a young and athletic group ready to test Charlotte’s revamped defense.In recent history, Brooklyn has maintained the upper hand, winning seven of the last ten meetings against Charlotte. However, with a healthy LaMelo Ball leading the charge, the Hornets will look to shift the narrative, particularly in front of their home fans.Tonight’s clash promises fast-paced action, with plenty of highlight plays expected from Ball and Miller. The Charlotte Hornets are likely to emphasize transition offense and pick-and-roll sets, capitalizing on Ball’s elite court vision to generate open looks for Bridges and Knueppel. The absence of Green and Williams may hurt their perimeter defense, so disciplined rotations will be vital.For Brooklyn, the focus will be on maintaining spacing and exploiting Charlotte’s weakened wing defense. Expect Cameron Thomas and Michael Porter Jr. to be aggressive early, while Nic Claxton’s interior presence could test the Hornets’ frontcourt depth.The game tips off at 7 p.m. ET (4:30 a.m. IST), with live coverage available on NBC and Peacock.As the Charlotte Hornets embark on their new season, all eyes will be on LaMelo Ball - healthy, motivated, and determined to prove that when he’s on the floor, he remains one of the league’s most electrifying and impactful guards. Tonight’s opener marks the first step in what Charlotte hopes will be a breakout season.","The charlotte hornets open their 2025–26 nba campaign against the brooklyn nets at spectrum center in charlotte.

Rohit Sharma ‘deliberately underperforming’ under Shubman Gill? India legend fires back,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/india-vs-australia/rohit-sharma-deliberately-underperforming-under-shubman-gill-india-legend-fires-back/articleshow/124750273.cms,"Rohit Sharma (ANI)

New ODI Captain Shubman Gill speaks out on Virat, Rohit and taking Indian cricket forward

India’s star openers had a forgettable start to the three-match ODI series against Australia in Perth on Sunday. Rohit Sharma managed just eight runs, while Virat Kohli was dismissed for a duck, as India lost the first match by seven wickets under the DLS method. The game also marked a new chapter in Indian cricket, with Shubman Gill taking over as the ODI captain, leading both veteran batters for the first time.Rohit’s low score sparked a flurry of speculation on social media, with some fans suggesting that the senior right-hander might have deliberately underperformed to challenge Gill’s authority as the new captain. These theories quickly went viral, drawing reactions from fans around the world.However, former India captain Sunil Gavaskar firmly dismissed such claims, stressing that no player would risk underperforming intentionally, as it could jeopardise their place in the team.“In Indian cricket, there’s a persistent myth that a player who loses the captaincy might underperform to undermine the new skipper,” Gavaskar wrote in his Sportstar column. “Nothing could be further from the truth. If a former captain doesn’t perform, he could be out of the team entirely. No player, regardless of personal feelings, would deliberately throw a game.”Gavaskar also highlighted that having experienced leaders like Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli in the squad is a huge advantage for a young captain like Shubman Gill.The duo’s presence provides mentorship and guidance, which can help the new captain navigate his debut series.“Questions have been raised about whether Gill can handle two former captains in his team. But he has made it clear that his relationship with Rohit and Virat hasn’t changed with his new role,” Gavaskar added. “In fact, having them around is a bonus. Both are willing to offer advice when needed, and there’s no better support for a debutant captain than two of India’s greatest ODI players by his side.”","India's star openers had a forgettable start to the three-match odi series against australia in perth on sunday.

Mathieu Darche confirms Pierre Engvall’s season-ending surgery

Pierre Engvall’s injury adds pressure on the Islanders’ future moves

The New York Islanders have suffered another injury, and this time, it’s a huge loss. Forward Pierre Engvall, who is recognized for his speed and two-way play, will be out for the rest of the season. Engvall has already experienced a long summer of battling back from a hip injury in the course of his recovery, and now it is taking another unfortunate turn. The news not only puts a dampener on the team’s momentum but also casts a shadow over his long-term future with the Islanders as they navigate a crucial season.In a statement released on Wednesday, Islanders’ general manager Mathieu Darche affirmed that Pierre Engvall underwent successful ankle surgery and is going to be off the ice for the entire season. The 29-year-old forward had already been put on the injured reserve due to offseason hip surgery and had not yet played a game this season.Engvall, who was acquired by New York in a trade from the Toronto Maple Leafs in 2023, had hinted at being a reliable and depth scorer. In the last season, he scored eight goals and provided seven assists in 62 games before injuries took over. His absence creates a void in the Islanders’ forward lineup, which will be a test for their depth as they continue to battle in the Eastern Conference.Pierre Engvall really got a rough deal with this injury situation, as it could not have been at a worse time for him. He is in the third year of his seven-year, $21 million contract, and the question of his availability has arisen. Analysts are of the view that if recovery takes longer than expected, New York might think about moving its $3 million cap hit in the offseason for the sake of roster flexibility.The good news is, Varlamov is the only one who has gotten back to skating after surgery to the knee, so there is some hope among the injured players. However, Engvall's absence will surely cause a loss to the team. The Islanders are looking at younger players like Matthew Schaefer, and that might change the team's retooling plans once again.Pierre Engvall's injury has been a setback, but his endurance is surely going to match his hustle on the ice, and therefore, fans can expect a powerful comeback in 2026. At the moment, his priority is healing — and showing that this injury will not overshadow his time with the Islanders.Also Read: Who are Auston Matthews’ parents?
