What happened to Victor Wembanyama in the San Antonio Spurs Vs. Milwaukee Bucks Game?



Victor Wembanyama enters the Spurs game against the Bucks with a new haircut



The San Antonio Spurs were forced into an uneasy wait on Thursday night after Victor Wembanyama exited early against the Milwaukee Bucks. The game is crucial for both teams in the Western Conference race, but the concern arose when the Spurs’ franchise star headed to the locker room within the opening minutes.Wembanyama’s status quickly became the central storyline inside the arena. With no immediate update from the team, all eyes turned to the bench as San Antonio continued play without its most impactful presence on the floor.The injury occurred with 9:18 remaining in the first quarter. While defending a driving Giannis Antetokounmpo near the basket, Victor Wembanyama appeared to make knee-to-knee contact. He dropped to the floor, grabbed his right knee, and showed visible discomfort before rising.Wembanyama limped off the court unassisted and moved quickly toward the locker room. Members of the Spurs medical staff followed, along with Spurs CEO R.C. Buford. The team later listed him as questionable to return, though no further details were shared during the game.The play sparked concern due to recent history. On December 31, Wembanyama suffered a hyperextended knee against the New York Knicks on a similar sequence.He returned to the bench that night but missed the next two games. Thursday’s incident looked eerily familiar, even as the Spurs avoided speculation and waited for medical evaluation.San Antonio entered the matchup at 27-13, while Milwaukee arrived at 17-23. The Spurs have managed Wembanyama’s workload carefully this season after he missed multiple weeks earlier, making any knee-related issue an immediate priority.Before the injury scare, Wembanyama had already drawn attention for a different reason. He arrived with a shaved head, a look that sparked conversation across the league. The change followed San Antonio’s recent blowout loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder.According to Keldon Johnson, the decision came from a shared moment between teammates. “Vic was like, ‘Yo, let’s bald our head.’ And I was like, ‘Let’s do it,'” Johnson said. “I was trying to make sure everything went smooth, take my time…I had to fade it up a little bit at first. Then I gave him a little bowl cut and then we went from there.”The haircut carried echoes of Wembanyama’s offseason in China, where he trained with Shaolin monks and shaved his head during that period. He previously described that experience as putting his “body through things that it’s not used to doing and allowing my range of movement and strength.”That phase coincided with one of the most productive stretches of his career. After starting the 2025-26 season, Wembanyama averaged 24 points, 11 rebounds, and 3 assists.Also Read: New York Knicks injury update: How long Jalen Brunson may be sidelined after ankle sprain","Victor wembanyama limped off in the first quarter against the milwaukee bucks.

Billy Gunn’s wrestling career details and financial history

Paula Heaney-Sopp’s contributions and net worth of the couple

Billy Gunn, whose real name is Monty Kip Sopp, is a professional wrestler with a long and distinguished career spanning more than 30 years. His current net worth is estimated at $3 million to $5 million, attributable to his contributions to AEW and WWE. Billy Gunn's wife, Paula Heaney-Sopp, who has been married to him since 2009 and is not directly involved in wrestling, plays a significant behind-the-scenes role in developing the family’s brand identity.Billy's earnings are primarily from his WWE career. He received the most recognition in the 1990s, when he was part of the tag team The Smoking Gunns, and later, in one of his legendary roles, he worked with Road Dogg as part of The New Age Outlaws. When he joined AEW, Gunn initially served as a coach, but soon returned to the ring as a wrestler, teaming up with Max Caster and Anthony Bowens as The Acclaimed and winning the AEW World Trios Championship.In spite of health challenges in 2025, including major surgeries and back stress fractures, he continues to be a well-respected old-timer who sometimes takes the stage while doing his coaching work at the same time.AEW's contract with Billy, who has an annual value of about $500,000, screams for revenue into one's income already augmented by WWE royalties and appearances.Paula’s role in the company primarily involved social media engagement, content creation in the lifestyle category, and support for promotions for Gunn and their wrestlers’ sons, Austin and Colten. Although her personal net worth is minimal compared with Gunn's, estimated at roughly six figures, the latter still clearly signals her presence in the digital media and brand support space.According to estimates, the wealth of the couple in the year 2025 will be approximately $5-6 million, which will be supported by the financial base established through Gunn's WWE and AEW career, plus the efforts of Paula, which not only strengthen the family's overall brand equity but also make it more visible. Their alliance, ultimately, reflects how hard-won victories, when combined with effective branding and backing, can lead to long-term profitability and market acceptance.","Billy gunn, whose real name is monty kip sopp, is a professional wrestler with a long and distinguished career spanning more than 30 years.

(Image via: Kike Hernandez's IG Story)

For a player whose career has been defined by big hits, postseason pressure, and high-energy moments on the diamond, Kiké Hernández’s latest Instagram Story shifted attention to something far more personal. The MLB star shared a soft, family-focused image of his daughter Penelope, accompanied by the caption, “The princess turns 5 days.”The post was brief but deeply warm, offering fans a glimpse into a quieter side of his life. In an era where athletes often highlight only their professional achievements online, Hernández’s update stood out for its simplicity.Kiké Hernández and his wife, Mariana Vicente, became parents in January 2021 when they welcomed their daughter Penelope Isabel. At the time, Hernández marked the moment with an emotional Instagram announcement that revealed just how profoundly fatherhood changed his perspective on life and success.“01.15.21! Penélope Isabel was born at 4:28pm. BEST DAY OF MY LIFE!!!” Hernández wrote while sharing photos of himself with his newborn daughter. He reflected on the biggest milestones of his professional journey, from being drafted to making his Major League debut and winning the World Series, before admitting that none of those moments compared to becoming a father.“The day I got drafted I thought I was on top of the world, the day I made my Big League debut I thought nothing would compare, the day I got married I felt like the world stopped, the day we won the World Series I thought I had it all; NOTHING compares to the moment when I met my little girl!!”That sense of gratitude and emotional grounding has remained a consistent theme in Hernández’s life ever since. Later in 2021, Vicente offered her own heartfelt tribute on Father’s Day, giving fans a glimpse into their family dynamic away from baseball. “Witnessing you become a dad is one of the best feelings in the world!” she wrote. “You really are the funnest (and finest 🤤) most loving girl dad. We are so lucky.”Currently, the Hernandez family is preparing for another meaningful chapter. The couple will have a second child in this year. Although Hernandez keeps on appending chapters to his career in the MLB, incidents such as this make fans remember that his most treasured achievements are at home, influenced by family, love, and soft celebrations in a series of posts one by one.","Kiké hernández and his wife, mariana vicente, became parents in january 2021.

Mark Stone scored just 25 seconds into overtime as the Vegas Golden Knights overcame the Los Angeles Kings with a score of 3-2. The win marked a successful performance for the team, extending their win streak to five as they continue to rise in the NHL playoff standings.Mark Stone capped the scoring with a goal and an assist, while Jack Eichel contributed three assists as Vegas extended its record to 22-11-12. Akira Schmid recorded 22 saves for the Golden Knights, who are now 5-0-1 within the current six games. The Los Angeles team got a point but yet struggled again in sealing victories for a closely contested match.The game-winning moment happened rapidly in overtime. Jack Eichel led a rush into the offensive zone, putting pressure on Kings goaltender Darcy Kuemper to commit. The Golden Knights seem to be leaning on their top line for many of the chances they are getting during this winning streak, with Stone and Eichel often getting into the danger area of the ice.The Vegas Golden Knights opened the scoring about a third of the way through the second period as Braeden Bowman snapped a wrist shot over Kuemper’s left shoulder. The goal ended a 17-game goal-scoring drought for Bowman and illustrated the depth of the Vegas roster, one that extends beyond its stars.The Kings tied it early in the third period, but Mitch Marner scored again at 12:07 with a wrist shot into the far corner after he skated into the slot.“I kind of had a lot of time to decide what I was going to do, so at first there, I was deciding to maybe take a slap shot, maybe get a tip play,"" Marner said. ""And then I saw both guys go to (Tomas) Hertl and (Ivan Barbashev), so I kind of walked in and was lucky enough to pick my spot.""Eichel assisted on all three Vegas goals and extended his point streak to six games. The Golden Knights and Kings have also reached a total of 18 overtime games this season, a league-high number, indicating just how small a matter winning or losing is at this stage of the playoff competition.Also read: Vegas Golden Knights and Mark Stone look to extend their winning streak as they welcome St. Louis Blues","Mark stone scored just 25 seconds into overtime as the vegas golden knights overcame the los angeles kings with a score of 3-2.

UAE leaders hail breakthrough moment for winter sports



The United Arab Emirates are set to create history next month by competing at the Winter Olympics for the first time! The nation will send two Alpine skiers to the 2026 Winter Games in Italy, marking a major milestone for Emirati sport. Until now, the UAE had only appeared at the Winter Youth Olympic Games and not the main Olympic event.Alex Estridge and Piera Hudson will represent the UAE at the Games, which will be held in Milan and Cortina from February 6 to 22. Their participation was officially announced on Thursday during a press conference at the UAE National Olympic Committee headquarters in Dubai, confirming a breakthrough moment for winter sports in the country.Hamel Al Qubaisi, vice-president of the UAE Winter Sports Federation, described the announcement as the result of years of effort. He said the federation is proud of the progress made and excited to see Emirati athletes compete on the Olympic stage. He added that the UAE’s participation in the 2026 Winter Olympic Games is a historic achievement and shows that sport in the country is not limited by geography or climate, but driven by ambition and a vision for global excellence.The opening ceremony will be unique, with events taking place across four locations. Estridge will carry the UAE flag in Milan, while Hudson will serve as flagbearer in Cortina, underlining the significance of the moment for both athletes.Estridge, who is just 19, is a prodigy of the UAE’s growing winter sports system. He learned to ski at Ski Dubai and first took up the sport at the age of three. He later began racing competitively and has represented the UAE at several youth events. Speaking last year, he explained that he has lived in Dubai his whole life, learned to ski locally, raced for the first time at seven, and recently competed at the Youth Olympics in Gangwon.Hudson, 29, brings international experience to the team. She previously represented New Zealand before switching her sporting nationality to the UAE in June 2025.Al Qubaisi also pointed to earlier achievements, including participation in the Winter Youth Olympic Games 2024, the Special Olympics World Winter Games Turin 2025, and the Asian Winter Games 2025.

A day in the life of an NHL player: Pittsburgh Penguins create a memorable experience for Myer Gallant



For 10-year-old Myer Gallant, a lifelong Pittsburgh Penguins fan from O’Leary, Prince Edward Island, Wednesday was unforgettable. Diagnosed with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a genetic disease that affects the nervous system and muscles, Myer has faced challenges far beyond his age. Yet, thanks to the Penguins and the Make-A-Wish Foundation, he got a taste of NHL life, signing a special one-day contract with the team.Myer’s first reaction upon seeing the contract placed on the table by Penguins general manager Kyle Dubas was pure surprise. “Shocked,” he said simply. The special day allowed him to meet some of his favorite players, including Sidney Crosby and Ryan Graves, both fellow Maritimers, making the experience even more personal and memorable as well.Dubas emphasized the broader impact of moments like these. “To be able to give back to people who make that level of investment in the Penguins is something that I think we’re always thrilled to do,” he said. For the Penguins, this gesture was a chance to give back. Crosby shared the experience with warmth. “Being a fellow Maritimer, it’s pretty cool. Hope he enjoys the day,” he said, highlighting the bond shared across generations and regions.Graves, recently recalled from Wilkes-Barre/Scranton of the AHL, spent time trading gifts with Myer, receiving homemade treats in return. “He’s a great kid. It’s special to be part of something like that,” Graves said, noting how the day puts professional athletes’ own routines into perspective.Myer enjoyed a locker room breakfast, wore Crosby’s No. 87 jersey, and observed practice from the glass. Autographs and a press conference with Dubas completed the day, leaving memories that will last a lifetime. Parents Randy and Jaclyn Gallant watched their son’s joy unfold. “When he got here, and he’d seen his jersey, it was something else,” Randy said.Even amid the Penguins’ recent on-ice struggles, moments like Myer’s visit show the impact the team can have beyond the rink. Dubas believes that while the season naturally has its highs and lows, experiences like these serve as a meaningful reminder of the difference the organization can make. For Myer, the day was far more than just a hockey experience, rather it’s a lifetime moment for a dedicated fan.","Myer gallant, 10, was diagnosed with spinal muscular atrophy (sma) the pittsburgh penguins and make-a-wish foundation teamed up to give myer a day in the life of an nhl player.

Islam Makhachev welcomes the fight against Ilia Topuria but refuses to move down



Islam Makhachev has not closed the door on a blockbuster fight against Ilia Topuria. The matchup is already being seen as one of the biggest fights the UFC can put together. Both men are champions. Both are elite, and both believe they are the best fighters in the world right now.Makhachev is the current welterweight champion after moving up from lightweight. Topuria, meanwhile, holds the lightweight title and is also a former featherweight champion. The two have exchanged verbal shots for months. Makhachev sits at No. 1 in the UFC pound-for-pound rankings, with Topuria close behind at No. 2.Islam Makhachev recently spoke to Match TV about the possible fight. He made it clear that he is not against the idea. He said he has no issue with fighting Ilia Topuria if it makes sense. However, the Russian star stressed that he will not drop back down in weight.Makhachev explained that he already ruled the lightweight division. He said nobody defeated him there. He added that he gave up the belt on his own and moved up for new challenges. Going back down just to fight for another belt does not excite him.In his view, if Topuria truly wants the fight, he should be the one moving up to welterweight.Makhachev also pointed out that the risk is lower for Topuria. He suggested that Topuria can afford to take the chance. If Topuria loses at welterweight, he can simply return to lightweight and continue defending his title. Makhachev agreed that the fight would mean more for Topuria than for him, saying his own chapter at lightweight is already closed.The welterweight champion also believes Topuria still has unfinished business at lightweight. He feels Topuria has yet to fully prove himself in that division. Makhachev mentioned that Arman Tsarukyan keeps calling Topuria out and is eager for a title fight.Meanwhile, Jack Della Maddalena has shared his view on the potential matchup. Makhachev defeated Maddalena at UFC 322 to win the welterweight belt. Speaking on N3on’s stream, Maddalena leaned toward Makhachev winning. He felt Makhachev’s size would play a big role. Still, he did not dismiss Topuria. He noted that Topuria hits very hard and could be dangerous if the fight stays standing.

Rob Gronkowski on Tom Brady RETURN for 2028 Olympics & Mike Tomlin Joining Him on Fox Sundays??



Rob Gronkowski opens up on Tom Brady making a comeback

Also Read:

Tom Brady may have officially retired from the NFL, but the idea of seeing him back on the field is no longer just fan speculation. Comments from his longtime teammate Rob Gronkowski have added fuel to the fire, suggesting that Brady’s next chapter in football could be more serious than many believed.Speaking on Up & Adams, Gronkowski made it clear that Tom Brady is not joking about returning to competitive football through flag football events. According to Gronkowski, Brady is “100 percent serious” about using upcoming tournaments as a testing ground, with his eyes firmly set on a possible Olympic appearance.Brady is set to headline the Fanatics Flag Football Classic, scheduled to take place in Saudi Arabia. While the event is being promoted as an exhibition, Gronkowski believes it carries much bigger meaning for the seven-time Super Bowl champion.The logic is simple. Flag football removes heavy contact, allowing quarterbacks to rely on arm strength, accuracy, preparation and game IQ all areas where Brady still excels. Gronkowski pointed out that if Brady performs well and feels physically comfortable, the door to a larger comeback will swing open.What truly stood out was Gronkowski’s suggestion that Brady could push for a spot with Team USA when flag football makes its Olympic debut at the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics. Brady will be close to 50 by then, but Gronkowski dismissed age as a concern, saying his former quarterback trains constantly and remains driven by competition.Brady himself has hinted at this mindset. During the launch of Fanatics Studios in Los Angeles, he admitted that most of his time is still spent in the gym, even after stepping away from the NFL. While he stopped short of confirming an Olympic run, he framed the next two years as a prove-it phase.Gronkowski also revealed that Brady’s habits have not changed much since retirement. He continues to train intensely, stays locked into football conversations and prepares as if he is still leading a huddle. From Gronkowski’s perspective, Brady is simply built differently.With flag football gaining global attention and the Olympics providing a massive stage, Brady’s return would not be about nostalgia. It would be about winning something that has defined his entire career.For now, all eyes will be on Brady’s performance in the Fanatics Flag Football Classic. If he looks sharp, comfortable and competitive, the chance of him playing further only increases. What once sounded unrealistic is now beginning to feel possible.","Tom brady is set to headline the fanatics flag football classic, scheduled to take place in saudi arabia.

Kevin Durant calls Aaron Rodgers a “generational athlete”

Mike Tomlin’s departure adds more uncertainty

Also Read:

As speculation around Aaron Rodgers’ future continues to grow, an unexpected individual has stepped into the conversation. NBA superstar Kevin Durant has offered his perspective on the veteran quarterback’s next move, urging fans and critics alike to appreciate the bigger picture rather than rush to conclusions.Rodgers’ 2025 season with the Pittsburgh Steelers ended on a difficult note. A one-sided Wild Card loss to the Houston Texans reignited questions about whether the four-time NFL MVP has reached the end of his playing days.Speaking on the Up & Adams Show, Durant made it clear that he views Rodgers’ situation through a wider lens. The NBA star stressed that playing at an elite level for more than two decades is rare, especially at a demanding position like quarterback.Durant pointed out that longevity itself deserves respect. In his view, Rodgers’ 21-year NFL journey speaks volumes about his discipline, preparation, and commitment to the game. Whether Rodgers returns for another season or decides to retire, Durant believes his career should not be judged by one disappointing playoff performance.The debate around Rodgers’ future intensified after Pittsburgh’s early playoff exit.The loss not only ended the Steelers’ season but also raised doubts about whether the team is ready to compete at a high level again in the near future.Rodgers, now 42, has not officially announced any decision. He has stated publicly that he does not want to make an “emotional decision” and prefers to take time before deciding whether his body and mindset are ready for another long NFL season.The uncertainty surrounding him increased further after Mike Tomlin stepped down as Steelers head coach. Rodgers reportedly joined Pittsburgh largely because of his respect for Tomlin, and the coach’s exit has left major questions about the team’s future direction.With the Steelers beginning a search for a new head coach, it remains unclear what role he would play if he chooses to return. A leadership change often signals a shift in philosophy, and that could influence the quarterback’s final decision.Durant also pushed back against the idea that Rodgers would disappear from public life if he retires. He suggested that Rodgers’ competitive nature and discipline would carry over into whatever comes next, whether that is media, business, or another football-related role.For now, Rodgers’ future remains unresolved. But as Durant’s comments highlight, the focus may be better placed on appreciating one of football’s most accomplished careers rather than rushing toward a conclusion.","Kevin durant calls aaron rodgers a “generational athlete’s” 21-year nfl journey speaks volumes about his discipline, preparation, and commitment to the game.

What is the “expensive poo” incident in F1? All about Carlos Sainz’s costly and comical moment on the track,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/formula-one/news/what-is-the-expensive-poo-incident-in-f1-all-about-carlos-sainzs-costly-and-comical-moment-on-the-track/articleshow/126552363.cms,"Carlos Sainz (Image Source: Getty)

Why has it become known as the 'expensive poo'?

FIA rules, driver backlash, and wider debate

Formula 1 is a sport of split-second accuracy, drama, and colossal fines, but a few stories have been as bizarre and discussed as the case of Carlos Sainz in Japan in 2025 during a Grand Prix. When the Williams driver was fined by the FIA for failing to sing the national anthem on the grid at Suzuka, the incident was immediately memed, joked about, and turned into a hot, debatable topic all over the paddock and in the media.Sainz gave the reason that he had been experiencing some sudden stomach problems just before the pre-race anthem, and he was rushed to the hospital, which made him arrive a few seconds late. Although stewards admitted the extenuating circumstances, a doctor confirmed the discomfort. Still, he incurred a 20,000-euro penalty under FIA rules for punctuality at official ceremonies, but later, that fine was suspended for no repeat offences.The case itself became a living one courtesy of comments from other drivers and commentators. Mercedes driver George Russell, who is also the representative of the Grand Prix Drivers’ Association, jokingly said that Sainz's bathroom break had become a pretty expensive poo and that this was the ridiculousness of the situation when the call of nature conflicted with strict F1 procedures.Sainz himself responded publicly, calling the fine disproportionate because it stemmed from a five-second delay. He even joked about possible other fines after making swears during the press remarks regarding the entire affair, another rule that the FIA had become stricter on in 2025.Although it is a funny side story in the history of Formula 1, the incident involving the expensive poo highlighted the serious debate about how much regulation and reality go hand in hand in Formula 1, and that even the use of the loo can become a headliner.Along with the jokes, the incident sparked an intense discussion in Formula 1. Drivers challenged the need to enforce ceremonial rules to an extreme, leaving human realities with no space. The Grand Prix Drivers Association openly defended Sainz, saying there should be greater discretion in health-related situations.Although the incident will be remembered with a smile, it also made the tension between rigid rules and reasonable justice in modern Formula 1 clear: even an incident off-track can have an impact on the sport.Also read: F1 fans hail Max Verstappen as he is set to mark 10 years since becoming youngest Grand Prix winner","Carlos sainz was fined by the fia for failing to sing the national anthem on the grid at suzuka in 2025.

NHL Update: Erik Gudbranson returns to Columbus Blue Jackets after long hip injury absence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/nhl-update-erik-gudbranson-returns-to-columbus-blue-jackets-after-long-hip-injury-absence/articleshow/126552032.cms,"Erik Gudbranson (Image Via Getty Images)

What does Erik Gudbranson’s return mean for Columbus Blue Jackets’ defense?

After a long absence, Erik Gudbranson is now almost ready to put on the Blue Jackets jersey again. The Columbus Blue Jackets have brought the experienced defenseman back from the injured list, paving the way for him to play against the Vancouver Canucks on Thursday night. Coming back after a long rehabilitation, the coming back of the player's return is now considered as giving the team a familiar face instead of rushing him back.The Blue Jackets have confirmed the return of Gudbranson from injured reserve, and he will likely play. The 34-year-old has not been on the ice since the end of October due to chronic hip problems that required a long time off. His non-participation brought about a reshuffling of Columbus’s defensive combinations in their attempt to hold their own, and now the return of Gudbranson seems like a planned move rather than just a pushing back of the deadline.On November 6, defenseman Erik Gudbranson was placed on injured reserve, missing 38 games in a row, which makes him the longest absent player on the team. During his very brief stay on the ice, he was given a minus-two rating, with an average of almost 15 minutes of ice time being his average. However, his contribution was never intended to be in the offensive area. The Blue Jackets appreciate him for his physical strength and capability to keep the situation calm in his zone.This reappearance also has a significant personal meaning. The previous season was another tough one since Gudbranson could participate in only 16 games after undergoing shoulder surgery. Now that he is in the last year of his $4 million contract, which was signed in July 2022, the veteran player will be determined to make a significant contribution, especially in the final part of the season.Columbus is coming into this game with a record of 20 wins, 19 losses, and 7 overtime defeats, which puts them in the seventh position in the Metropolitan Division, and they are seven points behind a wild-card spot.The return of Gudbranson will not have an immediate impact on the standings, but it will provide the Blue Jackets with something they have been missing for a long time: a solid and known character on the defense. Sometimes, that is more important than the stats.Also Read: Trevor Zegras Net Worth Timeline (2016–2026): From career growth to salary, endorsements, and more",The columbus blue jackets have confirmed the return of erik gudbranson from injured reserve.
