NEW DELHI: Congress MP Shashi Tharoor on Wednesday questioned the decision to host the fourth India–South Africa T20I in Lucknow amid dense fog and severe air pollution, after the match was eventually called off due to poor visibility.Tharoor suggested the game should have been scheduled in Thiruvananthapuram, citing significantly better air quality conditions there.In a post on X, the Congress leader said cricket fans were “waiting in vain” as hazardous conditions stalled play.“Cricket fans have been waiting in vain for the #INDVSSAODI to start in Lucknow. But thanks to dense smog, pervasive in most north Indian cities, and an AQI of 411, visibility is too poor to permit a game of cricket.

However, the toss was repeatedly delayed as thick fog enveloped the venue, forcing umpires to conduct multiple ground inspections through the evening.Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav also targeted the Centre, linking the cancellation of the Lucknow match to the city’s deteriorating air quality.He alleged that the government’s policies were worsening the situation and blamed them for making conditions unsafe for players and spectators.In a post on X he wrote: ""Delhi's pollution has now reached Lucknow as well. That's why the international cricket match scheduled to be held in Lucknow is not taking place. Actually, the reason for this is not fog, but smog.

Ja Morant’s latest ankle setback adds uncertainty as Memphis Grizzlies await his return to full form

Ja Morant’s injury concerns and absences continue to shape Memphis Grizzlies’ outlook against Minnesota

The Memphis Grizzlies will play the Minnesota Timberwolves on the road once more. Guard Ja Morant of the Memphis Grizzlies is back on the injury list ahead of the team's Wednesday night game against the Minnesota Timberwolves. Due to an ankle injury he sustained on Monday night against the Los Angeles Clippers, Morant is now categorized as questionable.Morant finished the game with 12 points, three rebounds, and four assists while playing just 20:58. Morant's ankle issue was a tweak, according to Grizzlies head coach Tuomas Iisalo, and the team is hoping it's not catastrophic.Before making his comeback for last Friday's game against the Utah Jazz, Memphis Grizzlies point guard Ja Morant had been sidelined since mid-November. But since then, Morant has experienced yet another setback due to an ankle injury.After missing the fourth quarter of a Grizzlies victory over the Los Angeles Clippers on December 15 due to a left ankle strain, guard Ja Morant was downgraded to doubtful. Based on Morant's questionable tag for this game, it appears he avoided a long-term issue.As of December 17, his status is still uncertain. After stepping on another player's foot late in the fourth quarter of Monday's 121-103 victory over the Clippers, Morant sustained the injury.In just his second game back from a calf injury, the Grizzlies star was limited in how many minutes he could play. Morant finished the game against the Clippers with 12 points on 4-of-12 shooting, 4 assists, and 3 rebounds. Morant, a two-time All-Star, hasn't yet reached his best during the 2025–26 campaign.After missing ten straight games due to a left calf strain, Morant's return to the starting lineup on Monday was only his second. Due to a sprain on the same ankle, Morant had also missed time during the preseason.He is now shooting 35.7 percent from the field and 19.4 percent from 3-point range while averaging just 17.7 points, 3.5 rebounds, and 7.5 assists per game. If Morant is to return to his All-Star form from a few seasons ago, his shooting stats must improve. In addition to Spencer's absence, Vince Williams Jr. would probably start if Morant couldn't make it.Due to a number of ailments, the Grizzlies point guard has only made 14 appearances this season. Morant has averaged 17.7 points, 7.5 assists, and 3.5 rebounds in those games, but his field goal percentage is only 35.7%.On Tuesday night, Memphis was the 8.5-point underdog in this game; however, the odds have now changed to Grizzlies +7.5 at DraftKings, with Morant labelled as doubtful.Cam Spencer is out for personal reasons, so Memphis will play without him. Spencer has been a significant offensive spark, hitting 63.6% from three-point range and scoring in double digits in each of his last ten games. Given that the Grizzlies decided not to play Monday's hero on Wednesday due to personal circumstances, that movement is noteworthy.Morant has only been in 14 games this season, and when he is in the lineup, the Grizzlies have a 5-9 record. After missing ten straight games due to a calf strain, Monday's game against the Clippers was only his second game back in action.Also read: Ja Morant trade update: Could Miami Heat be preparing a bold move for disgruntled Memphis Grizzlies star?",Memphis grizzlies point guard ja morant is doubtful for wednesday's game against the minnesota timberwolves.

How “The Last Dance” changed everything as Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen’s once-cordial relationship turns bitter after documentary fallout

Michael Jordan chooses disappointment over anger as his relationship with Scottie Pippen remains unhealed

The long-running issues between former basketball legends Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen have come back into the spotlight, bringing up memories from their time together with the Chicago Bulls. Once considered a great duo, many people thought Jordan was just angry about what happened, but that may not be true.The former Chicago Bulls coach Phil Jackson said Bulls forward Michael Jordan felt more hurt than angry by Pippen’s comments, according to Sam Smith, a former Chicago Bulls player. Instead of reacting in public, Michael Jordan stayed quiet and accepted that their close relationship had slowly come to an end.During their time with the Chicago Bulls, Michael Jordan, along with Scottie Pippen, won 6 championships together. “I didn't win without Scottie Pippen. And that's why I consider him my best teammate of all-time”, Michael Jordan once went candid about his bond with Scottie Pippen. And while Michael Jordan didn't share a very close personal off-court relationship with his Bulls teammate, Scottie Pippen. But they maintained a cordial relationship with each other, years after their retirement.But their relationship deteriorated following the release of the documentary, “The Last Dance” in 2020, which focused on Michael Jordan, placing him as the main figure of the Bulls’ legacy.Scottie Pippen allegedly felt deeply hurt by how his legacy was showcased in the film, as he felt the filmmakers didn't do justice with the way his legacy was portrayed in the film. He also felt positioning Jordan as the central figure not only minimized the roles played by the other teammates but also that the documentary didn't fully show their shared success. Over time, that feeling turned into bitterness, leading Pippen to openly criticize Jordan and question his reputation as one of the NBA's greatest players.Over time, Scottie Pippen's relationship with Michael Jordan has worsened to the extent that it still hasn't healed yet. But Jordan’s response has been quite unexpected as he seemed to have been more disappointed by how Pippen has reacted to this entire matter rather than feeling mad.And it is quite remarkable on Michael Jordan's part as he has handled the entire situation with Scottie Pippen, that instead of seeing it as an open public fight, he took it as a personal loss, a loss of years of on-court partnership and a deeply personal friendship that he once shared with Pippen. And while the duo is held by shared games and moments of championships, their personal relationship remains distant even to this day, which reminds that shared success on the court doesn't always mean harmony off it.Also Read: NBA legend Michael Jordan’s 23XI Racing wins major antitrust battle in dramatic NASCAR trial","Michael jordan and scottie pippen won 6 championships together with the chicago bulls.

Anthony Joshua reveals focusing on prayer ahead of Jake Paul fight



Anthony Joshua is making one final push to become the undisputed heavyweight champion. That journey begins on Friday night against Jake Paul in Miami. The fight will be telecast live on Netflix and will go down in Joshua’s professional record. On paper, the matchup looks one-sided. Still, it offers Joshua a chance to reset after a recent tough loss and prepare for another title run.Joshua had originally planned a quiet fight against a little-known opponent around this time. Instead, he accepted a huge money bout against the YouTuber-turned-boxer. The former unified champion sees Paul as a stepping stone. More importantly, he sees this fight as a chance to settle into his new team and mindset after being knocked out by Daniel Dubois in his last outing.Anthony Joshua believes the biggest change in this phase of his career is not technical. It is spiritual. The British boxer revealed that prayer has become a major part of his preparation. He spoke about this during a media roundtable in Miami after a low-key open workout with his new team at LIV Nightclub.When asked what the biggest shift has been in his final run at gold, Joshua gave a simple answer.“Maybe that I pray more. That’s important. And I learnt that from the team, the importance of prayer.So yeah, that’s important to me and I pray more now”, he replied.Joshua’s recent loss raised serious questions about his future, and the 34 year old knows time is limited. The Jake Paul fight may look like a sideshow to some fans. But for Joshua, it is a fresh start. It allows him to work with new people and test changes under bright lights without immediate title pressure.Interestingly, Joshua is not the only fighter leaning on faith this week. Jake Paul has also spoken openly about prayer. The American admitted he had worries earlier but says those feelings are gone.“I did [have concerns about the fight], but I asked Jesus to take them away from me and he did. I literally don’t feel any fear, so shout out to Jesus and the power of God and believing in your faith. I just keep praying and praying every single day, and I know something amazing is going to happen. This is my moment, the start of a massive chapter for me”, Paul noted.On Friday night, both fighters will step into the ring believing faith is on their side.Also Read: “I gotta take his soul” - Anthony Joshua says he knows how to break Jake Paul ahead of Miami showdown","Anthony joshua takes on jake paul in miami on friday night.

The climb in TV ratings and the increase in fan interest to a level that has not been seen in decades have made it clear that the NHL teams are willing to pay good money for having the best coaching staff in place. The teams from big cities are no longer at the stage where they are hesitating to spend a lot on coaching, as they are convinced that the right voice and vision can swing the Stanley Cup race their way.This conviction has been the main reason behind the changes in the salary pattern of head coaches. The information disclosed by sources such as Front Office Sports, The Athletic, and Hockey-Reference shows that just a handful of coaches are still able to command salaries that were regarded as unbelievable in the hockey world not so long ago. These contracts not only take into account the past success but also the growing importance that the teams attach to the art of tactics, controlling the locker room, and making stable long-term commitments.Mike Sullivan is alone at the top of the list after he reset the market in May 2025. The New York Rangers enticed him away from the Pittsburgh Penguins, making him the highest-paid coach in NHL history with a reported $6.5 million per year contract.Sullivan has the amazing credentials of being the coach who led the team to back-to-back Stanley Cups in 2016 and 2017, and the Rangers’ management obviously saw him as the missing puzzle piece for their championship aspirations.The head coach of the Tampa Bay Lightning, Jon Cooper, comes in at the second position with a salary of about $5.3 million per year. Cooper, the longest-serving coach in the league, has led Tampa Bay to four Stanley Cup Finals and two victories, thus creating one of the NHL's modern dynasties with his approach of consistency and adaptability.Underneath that excellent layer comes the Colorado Avalanche, coach Jared Bednar, who takes home a little less than $5 million annually. The very first professional hockey team for Bednar was the Colorado Avalanche, where he has molded the team into one of the brightest contenders and Stanley Cup winners with his fast, disciplined style.Following the mentioned coach is Bruce Cassidy, the Vegas Golden Knights head coach, who rakes in $4.5 million each year. His value was proven when he led the Knights to their first-ever Stanley Cup in 2023, thus justifying the franchise's daring investment.The fifth spot on this list is taken by Dallas Stars coach Peter DeBoer, who earns close to $4.25 million. He may not own a Stanley Cup ring, but his playoff streak and many Finals appearances still place him among the most trusted coaches in the league.The upswing in coaching salaries in the NHL clearly points to a shift in the league’s focus. Today’s teams are not just looking for a coach with an impressive track record, but a multimillion-dollar necessity for everyone involved to aim for the ultimate hockey prize.Also Read: NHL Trade Rumours: Phillip Danault, Ryan Strome, Mason Marchment linked to potential trades","Mike sullivan is the highest-paid coach in nhl history with a reported $6.5 million per year contract.

Anthony Edwards’ possible return might give Minnesota Timberwolves timely boost ahead of Memphis Grizzlies clash

Minnesota Timberwolves continue their strong run without Anthony Edwards as tough stretch looms ahead

The Minnesota Timberwolves and Memphis Grizzlies, two Western Conference playoff contenders, will square off on Wednesday night. Anthony Edwards and Ja Morant are both listed as questionable for this game on the injury report.The Timberwolves are currently 7.5-point favorites in the most recent DraftKings odds because Edwards is officially labelled as questionable for Wednesday's game. Due to a right foot injury that has kept him out of the last two games, Edwards' questionable designation on Wednesday was attributed to injury maintenance.Anthony Edwards, a star player for the Minnesota Timberwolves, has missed the team's previous two games due to a foot ailment, but it looks like he could make a comeback on Wednesday night against the Memphis Grizzlies.It's still uncertain if Anthony Edwards will start for the Timberwolves on Wednesday night against the Memphis Grizzlies after missing the previous two games due to right foot pain. The official announcement read:“Edwards (foot) is questionable for Wednesday's game against the Grizzlies, Dane Moore of 'The Dane Moore NBA Podcast' reports…”Despite Edwards' injury, the Timberwolves have won consecutive games and are currently 17-9 in the 2025–26 campaign, good for the sixth seed in the Western Conference.This season, Edwards has sustained a few injuries. He missed several games early in the season due to a hamstring problem.In an interview with KFAN-FM 100.3 on Tuesday morning, head coach Chris Finch stated:""It's definitely improving. He's still day to day... We have practice here this morning, and we'll see what he looks like coming in. But he was able to move around and get up some shots yesterday. We're headed in the right direction, but I'm not sure of an exact return time just yet.""Nevertheless, the All-NBA guard is shooting 50.0 percent from the field and 41.6 percent from beyond the arc while averaging 28.7 points, 4.9 rebounds, and 3.8 assists per game. Earlier this month, he ended a six-game run of games with 30 or more points, but in his most recent game, he scored 40.Edwards would be worth considering for Minnesota's prop market if he returns on Wednesday. My favorite play for him on December 17 is shown here.Edwards' next chance will be on Friday night when the 24-2 Oklahoma City visit the Wolves in Minneapolis if he doesn't play on Wednesday. With two victories over the weekend, including one against the Golden State Warriors in Stephen Curry's comeback game, the Timberwolves have generally performed well in Edwards' absence.In the Timberwolves' second consecutive game without star Anthony Edwards, Minnesota defeated the Sacramento Kings 117-103 on Sunday night thanks to 24 points and nine rebounds from Julius Randle. The Wolves are now 17-9 overall after winning seven of their previous eight games.

From Texas prodigy to NFL

Why did Miami turn to Quin Ewers now?

Also Read:

The Miami Dolphins have turned to an unexpected name at quarterback as their 2025 season takes another sharp turn. Following Tua Tagovailoa ’s benching after a string of disappointing performances, rookie Quinn Ewers is set to make his first NFL start, stepping into the spotlight against the Cincinnati Bengals. For many fans, the obvious question now is simple: who exactly is Quinn Ewers?Quinn Ewers arrives in Miami with a college resume that once made him one of the most talked-about quarterback prospects in the country. A former Texas Longhorns star, Ewers played a central role in leading the program back to national relevance. During his time in Austin, he guided Texas to consecutive College Football Playoff appearances and finished his college career as one of the school’s most productive passers.Statistically, Ewers ranks third all-time at Texas in passing yards and passing touchdowns, throwing for over 9,000 yards and 68 scores. His best season came in 2024, when he threw 31 touchdowns and earned All-SEC and All-Big 12 honors across his college career. Despite that production, questions about arm strength and consistency pushed him down draft boards.Ewers was ultimately selected by the Dolphins in the seventh round of the 2025 NFL Draft, taken 231st overall. The slide reflected league-wide skepticism about his long-term upside as a starter, but Miami viewed him as a developmental option with strong football IQ and poise.The decision to start Ewers came after Miami’s 28-15 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers, a game in which Tagovailoa struggled under pressure. Dolphins head coach Mike McDaniel admitted afterward that quarterback play was “not good enough,” signaling that changes were coming. With Miami eliminated from playoff contention, the team has opted to evaluate its younger options rather than stick with the status quo.Notably, Ewers was chosen ahead of former first-round pick Zach Wilson, a move that underscores the coaching staff’s desire to see what the rookie can offer in live action.At 22, Ewers brings solid size, a quick release, and a reputation for processing defenses well. He is comfortable operating short and intermediate passing concepts and has shown touch and anticipation when protected. However, concerns remain about his deep-ball consistency, pocket awareness under heavy pressure, and injury history dating back to college.Whether he emerges as a long-term option or settles into a backup role, Quinn Ewers now has the chance he’s been waiting for, and the Dolphins are watching closely.",Quinn ewers is set to make his first nfl start against the cincinnati bengals.

Why Ohio University suddenly fired head football coach Brian Smith just days before the bowl game,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/why-ohio-university-suddenly-fired-head-football-coach-brian-smith-just-days-before-the-bowl-game/articleshow/126048287.cms,"Ohio football coach Brian Smith fired (Getty Images)

Ohio University fires head coach Brian Smith amid misconduct allegations

Ohio University’s football program woke up to turmoil at the worst possible moment. With a bowl game days away and a season of promise still fresh, the school made a decisive move that sent shockwaves through Athens, Ohio. On Wednesday, Dec. 17, the university announced it had fired head football coach Brian Smith, citing allegations serious enough to terminate his contract for cause. The timing, the language, and the lack of detail instantly raised questions far beyond the win loss record.For a program still building momentum, the decision lands heavy. Smith was not only less than a year into his tenure, he was also coming off a solid season that suggested stability. Instead, Ohio University now finds itself searching for answers, clarity, and yet another head coach as the Bobcats prepare for postseason football under an interim leader.In its official statement, the school said, “The termination follows an administrative review of allegations that Smith violated the terms of his employment agreement by engaging in serious professional misconduct and participating in activities that reflect unfavorably on the University.”The university offered no further specifics, leaving fans and observers to read between carefully chosen lines.Smith, 45, had been placed on leave on Dec. 1 for undisclosed reasons, a move that hinted at deeper issues behind closed doors. Just 364 days earlier, he had taken over the program after Tim Albin departed for UNC Charlotte. On the field, results were steady. Ohio finished 8-4 this season, building on the foundation of recent success and remaining competitive in the Mid American Conference.The response from Smith’s legal team was swift and forceful. His attorney, Rex Elliott, issued a statement saying his client is “shocked and dismayed” by the firing. Elliott added, ""We vigorously dispute Ohio University's grounds for the termination for cause of Coach Brian Smith. He is shocked and dismayed by this turn of events, and we plan to fight this wrongful termination to protect his good name.” He continued, ""Coach Smith is an ethical man who has done an exemplary job for the University. He wants nothing but the best for the players, coaches, and the entire Bobcat community.""With Smith gone, defensive coordinator John Hauser steps in as interim head coach, tasked with leading the Bobcats into the Frisco Bowl against UNLV on Dec. 23. Meanwhile, the university confirmed that a national search for a permanent head coach, its third in three seasons, will begin immediately.Smith’s dismissal also follows a broader trend of late season upheaval in college football. Just last week, Michigan fired head coach Sherrone Moore after an investigation found “credible evidence” of misconduct, days before a major bowl appearance. For Ohio University, the immediate challenge is focus. The longer term test will be restoring trust while keeping a once promising program from losing its footing.Also Read: Myles Garrett’s viral kiss with Chloe Kim leaves her dad hilariously cringing as Browns star chases history","Ohio university fires head coach brian smith amid misconduct allegations.

Brandon Hagel was injured in Tampa Bay Lightning at Florida Panthers game



It was not only a defeat on the scoreboard when Tampa Bay Lightning played against the Florida Panthers, but also forward Brandon Hagel had to leave the field early after getting a heavy headshot. The play happened during a hotly contested match, and soon, it became the highlight of the night.Hagel, one of Tampa Bay’s most productive forwards this season, did not return after the hit and was ruled out with an upper-body injury. While the Lightning provided limited details postgame, the play raised questions about player safety, potential supplemental discipline, and Hagel’s short-term availability.The injury occurred midway through the contest when Brandon Hagel took contact to the head from Florida Panthers defenseman Seth Jones along the boards. Hagel appeared shaken immediately after the collision and headed straight to the locker room under his own power, but clearly in discomfort.The play was not reviewed on-ice, and Seth Jones was not penalized. Nevertheless, replays revealed that Jones hit Hagel in the head area more than once, which led to post-game commentary on the part of analysts and fans about whether NHL Player Safety should take further action.Hagel has played a crucial role with the Lightning and contributed a stable scoring and solid two-way play. His absence may affect the forward depth of Tampa Bay as the club tries to make it through a taxing period of the schedule. Until the status of Hagel is clear, the Lightning will have to depend more on their secondary scoring.As of the latest NHL injury updates, there has been no announcement of supplemental discipline against Seth Jones. The Lightning is expected to release. It is additional information once Hagel completes further medical evaluations. Fans and teammates alike will be watching closely, hoping for positive news regarding one of Tampa Bay’s most dependable forwards.Also Read: Net worth of New York Islanders star Bo Horvat in 2025: Details on his earnings, salary, contract details and projections","Tampa bay lightning forward brandon hagel left the game with an upper-body injury.

The Buffalo Sabres officially introduced Jarmo Kekalainen as their new general manager on Tuesday. The 59-year-old Finland native takes over a franchise desperately trying to end its NHL-record 14-year playoff drought.The previous GM, Kevyn Adams, was fired on Monday after five-plus seasons of mediocrity. But Kekalainen wasted no time outlining his vision for turning around the struggling organization. His first press conference revealed exactly what he believes has been missing in Buffalo.Kekalainen pointed to Buffalo's depth of talent as a reason for optimism about climbing back into playoff contention. However, the new GM made it clear that skill alone won't solve the franchise's problems.He placed heavy emphasis on building team character and consistency, two qualities the Sabres have been criticized for lacking throughout their historic drought.""I think character is the biggest part of talent, and that's the talent we need to focus on,"" Kekalainen said during his introductory press conference. The new GM didn't sugarcoat his assessment of what he's watched from Buffalo this season.He called out the team's inconsistent effort level and lack of competition in games they should have won.""There've been games this year where we looked like it was going to be easy, and then we lost because we got outworked. That's unacceptable,"" Kekalainen stated.""That's going to be something that we're going to focus on every day, because the talent, the skill alone, is not going to get you wins."" Kekalainen also distanced himself from Adams, who, a year ago, blamed high taxes and cold winters as reasons for having difficulty attracting and retaining talent.The new GM rejected those excuses entirely while drawing on his 11 years as Columbus Blue Jackets general manager. ""Winning hockey games is the most important ingredient,"" Kekalainen said firmly. ""Everybody wants to play for a winner.""The Sabres sit at 14-14-4 and are tied for last place in the Eastern Conference. However, they're only six points behind eighth-place Boston and riding a three-game winning streak.Kekalainen acknowledged fans have every right to be frustrated but believes the core pieces are in place. ""We have some really good core pieces here. We're close. Now we just have to take the next step,"" he explained.One immediate change will see Buffalo moving ahead with two goaltenders rather than three. Kekalainen also placed priority on resuming contract negotiations with top-line forward Alex Tuch, who's in the final year of his deal.However, Kekalainen made it clear he won't make desperate moves just to end the playoff drought. ""I told the players to forget about the 14-year thing that's kind of hanging around like a black cloud,"" he said.Kekalainen continued, ""I'm not going to sacrifice the ultimate goal for the sake of making the playoffs and then not having any sustainability for our goal as a team to take the next step.""Owner Terry Pegula praised Kekalainen's track record of making bold moves in Columbus. Whether that approach finally breaks Buffalo's historic playoff drought remains the biggest question facing the organization.","Buffalo sabres introduce jarmo kekalainen as their new general manager.

Dylan Harper stays upbeat after NBA Cup Final loss, calls it a valuable learning moment for Spurs

Dylan Harper shines in NBA Cup final loss as Spurs struggle to adjust and contain Knicks duo

The San Antonio Spurs were certain to win the NBA Cup after defeating the reigning champion Oklahoma City Thunder on Saturday night in the semifinals. The Spurs got off to a great start, leading by five points at the end of the first three quarters. Regretfully, the Knicks won by 11 points after outscoring San Antonio 35–19 in the last period.With two minutes remaining in the third quarter, Victor Wembanyama made a deep 3-pointer to put San Antonio ahead 92-81. Dylan Harper of the Spurs now talked about the sorrow following the defeat. After the San Antonio Spurs' 124-113 loss to the New York Knicks in Tuesday's NBA Cup final at T-Mobile Arena, the youngster offered his opinions.Harper discussed the lessons he learnt from his early high-stakes games after the game.“It was an unbelievable experience to be a part of this…I’m 3 months into the NBA and I get to go through things like this with a great group of guys,” Harper said.Harper stressed the value of effort and concentration when asked about lessons for upcoming high-pressure games, he continued:“It’s do or die. You’ve seen the level of intensity rise up for us and them.Obviously, they came out with the win. But for us, it’s not taking anything for granted; I think that’s the biggest thing. When we all go out there, we all know that we’ve got to play 110% in order to win things like this.”Despite their loss, San Antonio is still among the best teams in the Western Conference and seems ready for a long postseason run. Harper admitted that performing on a platform with such high stakes was difficult. He added:“The mindset we went into the game… we got away from it in the fourth quarter, but overall we’re going to take a lot from it and apply it to the next time.""The rookie emphasized the team's physicality and effort. He then continued:“You see how hard we’re playing out there, diving for loose balls, going to get offensive rebounds, just doing anything we could do to help our team win..”Harper also discussed how his father, a five-time NBA champion, advised him to maintain his composure throughout demanding seasons.“He always tells me there’s 82 games in the season. Every game isn’t going to go your way, but staying levelheaded through it all is the biggest thing he’s told me,” Harper said.It's only their second game together, Harper said, reflecting on the team's development. Nothing to get too worked up over. It was undoubtedly a worthwhile learning experience to be on the side. They even learnt a lot about themselves from it.During the same interview, Harper further talked about the challenges of playing half-court offence when important teammates have just returned. He said:“Vic just got back, Steph just got back, and all of us were out at one time. Finding how to play with each other at a high level comes with time and experience..”Despite having seven players in double figures at the end, San Antonio was unable to match the 53 points scored by Jalen Brunson and OG Anunoby. New York also finished the game with 17 more rebounds, dominating San Antonio on the glass.San Antonio's most outstanding player in the loss was rookie Dylan Harper, who led the team in scoring with 21 points off the bench.
