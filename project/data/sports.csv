Trey Lyles: Another Viable Option

What’s Next for Golden State?

Theare actively scouting alternatives as veteran Al Horford considers retirement and restricted free agent Jonathan Kuminga remains unsigned. With Kevon Looney’s departure to the New Orleans Pelicans, Golden State faces mounting pressure to reinforce its frontcourt—and one name rising to the top is 2-time NBA championThe Golden State Warriors have been eyeing 39-year-old Al Horford as a replacement for Looney, hoping his experience and leadership can help stabilize the team’s interior defense. However, Kuminga’s unresolved contract situation has complicated the process. Golden State is hesitant to finalize any deals before resolving Kuminga’s holdout, which has become a key bottleneck in their offseason plans.ClutchPoints insider Brett Siegel shed light on the situation: “The main reason Horford and Melton, or any other player, have yet to sign with the Warriors is because of Kuminga’s holdout,” Siegel wrote Friday. (H/t: Sporting News)Horford’s uncertain status, with retirement reportedly on the table, adds another layer of complexity.If Horford chooses to walk away from the game or sign elsewhere, the Golden State Warriors are already considering contingency plans.Should Horford opt out, the Golden State Warriors have two primary candidates lined up:1. Chris Boucher2. Trey LylesWhile both are currently waiting in free agency, Golden State seems to be the only team linked to Al Horford at this stage, especially after the conclusion of Summer League.Chris Boucher stands out as a high-upside option due to his offensive versatility. The 32-year-old forward, listed at 6-foot-9, has steadily grown into a modern NBA big man with a reliable shooting stroke and solid ball-handling ability.Boucher’s shooting range and agility could make him an ideal fit for the Warriors’ motion-heavy offense. He isn’t known for defensive dominance like Horford, but his ability to space the floor would complement Stephen Curry and help create more driving lanes and scoring opportunities.Trey Lyles, a 10-year veteran, is also in the conversation. Known for his catch-and-shoot ability, Lyles would give the Golden State Warriors a different type of offensive tool—less dynamic off the dribble but more suited for spot-up shooting.Still, between the two, Boucher’s all-around skillset may align better with Golden State’s system.As Golden State navigates this turbulent offseason, the franchise must first resolve Kuminga’s holdout before making any major roster decisions. But in the event that Horford declines their offer or retires, fans should expect swift movement on Boucher or Lyles.Brett Siegel summed it up best: “Until Horford signs, these two are forced to wait in free agency.”Also read: NBA Free Agency Rumors: New York Knicks predicted to land $50 million Orlando Magic star to boost bench depth and improve title odds The clock is ticking, and the Golden State Warriors are clearly not sitting idle.

Potential Impact: A New Big Three in Dallas?

A Second Blockbuster Between the Los Angeles Lakers and the Dallas Mavericks?

A blockbuster NBA trade proposal is turning heads across the league, as reports suggestcould be on the move to the. The potential deal, first highlighted by Bleacher Report’s Eric Pincus, would form a seismic three-team swap involving the Los Angeles Lakers , Dallas Mavericks, and Brooklyn Nets. LeBron James , now nearly 41, has been the cornerstone of the Lakers for years, averaging 27 points per game throughout his career. The idea of moving the four-time NBA champion might sound unthinkable. But with 25-year-old Luka Dončić already producing Hall of Fame-caliber numbers, the Lakers may finally be tempted to reshape their roster around the young Slovenian star.According to Pincus, “The initial assumption is Dallas views James, even at almost 41, as the viable option to propel the franchise into upper-echelon contention. The cost is depth.”Dallas could be betting big on LeBron, not just for what he brings on the court, but for the championship pedigree he brings to any locker room. And with Kyrie Irving already on the roster—his former championship partner from Cleveland—a reunion could ignite serious title contention.The reported trade would see an extensive player swap between the three franchises. Here’s a clear breakdown of who gets what:Here’s a quick rundown of the motivations behind each team’s involvement:• Acquire LeBron and Bronny James, giving them star power and massive media attention.• Pair LeBron with Kyrie Irving again—a duo that already has a championship under their belt.• Add LeBron’s championship experience to mentor Luka Dončić.• Offload LeBron’s salary and begin a new era centered around Luka Dončić.• Receive young, athletic talent and picks to retool around Anthony Davis.• Acquire a reliable defensive big man in Daniel Gafford and versatile wings in Martin and Washington.• Gain valuable rotation players and young prospects as they continue their rebuild.• Offload salary while acquiring promising talent like Knecht and Prosper.If the deal materializes, it would not only reunite LeBron and Kyrie Irving, but also create an imposing trio alongside Luka Dončić. The Mavericks would arguably become instant contenders in the Western Conference, while the Lakers could usher in a youth-focused retool with a longer window of success.As Eric Pincus explains, “Dallas would be making a bold move, but James remains one of the league’s top NBA stars.”It wouldn’t be the first time the Dallas Mavericks and the Los Angeles Lakers have collaborated on a high-stakes deal. Less than a year ago, the two franchises completed one of the biggest trades in recent NBA history. This new proposal could be the follow-up that changes the NBA landscape once again.Also read: Milwaukee Bucks’ Bold Three-Team Trade Proposal Could Land $160,000,000 Portland Trail Blazers Superstar to Support the Greek Freak While nothing is official yet, the proposed trade has ignited serious debate. Trading LeBron James is no small decision—he’s not just a player, but a generational icon. But with Luka Dončić ascending and the Los Angeles Lakers needing to reimagine their future, it might just be the move that reshapes multiple franchises for years to come.","A blockbuster nba trade proposal is turning heads across the league.

What is Stephen Curry’s net worth in 2025?

What is Stephen Curry’s contract value for the 2024-2025 season?

Will Stephen Curry retire in 2026?

After WNBA players staged a quiet yet powerful demonstration on All-Star game day to demand pay equal to NBA stars, Stephen Curry has jumped into the salary debate by saying that ‘NBA stars are underpaid’. He appeared on the podcast, 360 with Speedy, and made the startling comment while discussing the topic of player salary in the NBA.Stephen Curry was of the view that the NBA players’ salaries don’t reflect the value the players create. He said the players' salaries are far less as compared to teams’ soaring valuations. While the issue of pay disparity among NBA and WNBA players is already heating up, the latest comment from the Golden State Warriors has opened everyone’s eyes to a fact ignored to date.Stephen Curry is all set to take home about $60 million in salary in the upcoming season. However, he doesn’t think the figure is justified. He raised the issue of NBA players being underpaid during his recent appearance on a podcast and said:""I think, because of the way the CBA is structured right now, we can't participate in equity. And that's a big deal because it is a partnership with ownership. It's a partnership with the league, and we're on the short term of that revenue.”He elaborated, ""Those (contract) numbers sound crazy, but what the league is doing, from whatever era you want to compare it to, to now, is probably 10x that. The idea that we can't participate in equity while we're playing is part of why I would say yes, we are underpaid, because we want to be able to participate in that rise.”""Hopefully, sooner than later, those rules change a little bit so that players can participate more in the upside of team equity, the league, valuations, and all that type of stuff. Just because I think we deserve it.""His comment has definitely pinpointed the glaring issue in the NBA and may kickstart serious discussions on restructuring the CBA.During the podcast where Stephen Curry appeared, he spoke on various topics. In one of the sections, the host, Speedy Morman, asked if the speculations that his net worth is about $240 million are true. To this, Curry said that he was not sure and that he didn’t care. He swiftly diverted the discussion to present contracts of various players, which are now in the supermax category. Taking the discussion further, the host asked if Curry thought that the players were underpaid. Curry said yes and went on to explain his viewpoint.The NBA players, on average, took home $12 million in the 2024-2025 season. A few NBA stars are some of the richest athletes on Forbes’ list. Still, according to Curry, there is room for improvement in the CBA structure, which can result in improved salaries for the NBA players.The discussions around NBA and WNBA players' pay disparity have already heated up. Recently, Shaquille O'Neal backed WNBA stars and said that their salaries are outright unjustified. WNBA stars wore 'Pay us what you owe us' t-shirts on the All-Star game day to voice their demand for pay equal to NBA players. According to various media reports, WNBA star Caitlin Clark's game tickets were priced at $41, and she was being considered the biggest crowd-puller before she had to sit on bench due to injury.Stephen Curry’s net worth in 2025 is estimated at $240 million, per Celebrity Net Worth.Stephen Curry’s contract value stands at $59,606,817.No, Stephen Curry will not retire in 2026.Also Read: 10 wealthiest NBA stars in 2025 - Updated Net Worth, Current Occupation and More","Stephen curry sparks salary debate amidst wnba players demanding pay equal to nba stars.

Poll Do you think Vanessa Bryant handled the pregnancy rumors well? Yes, very cleverly No, she should have addressed them directly

Met Gala Surprise: Rihanna Stuns With Baby Bump Reveal, A$AP Rocky Confirms It’s Baby No 3

After days of unrelenting speculation, Vanessa Bryant took to Instagram Stories on Sunday, June 1, to put the rumors to rest. Her response wasn’t a press statement or a legal warning, it was a wild meme with a big middle finger to the internet trolls. The meme featured music icon Rihanna floating in water with a snorkel mask on her head, holding a drink, and flipping her middle finger.“Me protecting my peace, not pregnant & having fun all summer,” Vanessa Bryant wrote in the caption on her response to the online trolls who spread her pregnancy rumors about five years after her husband, Kobe Bryant ’s, untimely and devastating demise.It was clear, clever, and vintage Vanessa who shut down noise without saying a word about the origin of the gossip. No press release needed when you’ve got Rihanna energy with a direct middle finger gesture.The rumors had emerged out of nowhere, with some users pointing to photos allegedly showing a ""baby bump,"" though no timestamps or context were attached to those images. Vanessa hasn't been publicly linked to anyone romantically, and there’s been zero confirmation from her side—until now.In another Instagram Story later that evening, Vanessa shared a motivational quote that hinted at how she views the entire situation and what matters to her personally.“The only way to impress me, is by being a good person,” the quote read. “I don’t care what you have, what you wear, where you live, or what you drive. I just have deep respect for people with pure hearts and good intentions.”Adding one final touch to her trilogy of clapbacks, she posted another Rihanna meme, this one stating, “I’m not mean, I’m just not the one.”With the classic Rihanna memes, Vanessa showed that she is busy being a proud mom to her daughters while being the powerhouse of her business ventures. While she does not care about the rumor mill, her reaction explicitly showed that she is urging privacy.Vanessa Bryant, who shares four daughters with Kobe— Natalia, Bianka, Capri, and the late Gianna— has remained devoted to family and philanthropy. Most recently, she shared footage of a joyful family ski trip over the holidays, showing the tight-knit bond she maintains with her children.Natalia Bryant stepped into the fashion world just like her mother, officially joining IMG Models in 2021 at the age of 18. “Ever since I can remember, I wanted to model,” she shared in a statement posted by IMG on Instagram. “There is a lot to learn, but I feel this is a great opportunity for me to learn and express myself creatively.”Vanessa and Kobe Bryant tied the knot in April 2001. Tragically, in January 2020, Kobe and their 13-year-old daughter Gianna lost their lives in a helicopter crash that also killed seven others. They were headed to Kobe’s Mamba Sports Academy for a youth basketball game when the accident occurred. Kobe was 41 at the time. The loss shook the sports world and left a lasting impact on fans, friends, and loved ones across the globe. Kobe has left a huge legacy to his name as well, he is considered one the of the elite NBA superstars of all time with astounding stats, records and intense playmaking abilities. His demise created a huge void in the NBA world as fans are still mourning his untimely passing.Since their passing, she’s kept their memory alive through meaningful business ventures and charitable work. Kobe launched the Mamba Sports Foundation in 2016, aiming to support young athletes. After his death, Vanessa renamed it the Mamba & Mambacita Sports Foundation in honor of both Kobe and Gianna. Today, the foundation helps underserved boys and girls in sports, pushing forward the mission they believed in. It's her way of carrying on their legacy with purpose and heart.Vanessa Bryant’s response was indeed witty and empowering as she hinted that she deserves privacy and reminded the world that while she may be a public figure, her peace and dignity aren’t up for debate, especially not over unfounded gossip. After the viral response via memes, Vanessa has seemingly closed the chapter as she did not extend the matter any further with any other comments about it afterwards.Days after shutting down the pregnancy rumor, Vanessa Bryant made a glowing courtside appearance with her daughters at the New York Liberty vs. Chicago Sky game. The WNBA shared a sweet clip showing Vanessa alongside Natalia, 22, Bianka, 8, and Capri, 5, all smiling and waving for the camera.Later, Vanessa uploaded an image of her in a restaurant, candidly posing as she waited for the food to be arrive. Considering the dress, it appears that the photograph was shot after her recent attendance in the game.Their family moment quickly caught fans’ attention online, adding a warm highlight to the evening. It was a rare and heartwarming public outing for the Bryant family, showing their strong support for women’s basketball. It was Vanessa's first public outing since she debunked the horrendous pregnancy rumors.Recently, Vanessa honored her husband Kobe's memory with a heartfelt Instagram post on Instagram, sharing a throwback photograph of the family with the NBA legend, ""Happy Fathers Day @kobebryant 💕 You are so missed.

She’s earned recognition as a model, businesswoman, and philanthropist, adding to her wealth through years of steady work.As of 2025, her estimated net worth is $600 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth.

Pro NBA player Kyle Kuzma’s girlfriend, Winnie Harlow , recently turned 31. The supermodel and entrepreneur celebrated her birthday in grand fashion with a stunning photo drop that took social media by storm. The Canadian beauty began her special day with a series of sensual photos that depicted her emanating aura, fearlessness, and individual confidence. This is her first birthday since she got engaged with her long-term boyfriend. Kyle Kuzma and Winnie Harlow's relationship started from Instagram. In 2019, the NBA star messaged the model on Instagram but never got a response. They later re-connected on Instagram early in 2020.They then started dating in April 2020 when she was with him in Los Angeles. On The Ellen Degeneres Show, the model recalled:""After a month of being on FaceTime for 24 hours every single day for a month, he was like, 'You gotta come to L.A.’, And I've been in L.A. ever since. That was a year ago.""Five years after they began dating, in February 2025, the couple announced that they were engaged on Instagram. They also posted a picture carousel that included a close-up of Harlow's stunning ring.Kyle Kuzma told his the-then girlfriend that he organized a trip to the Caribbean island as a long weekend vacation. Harlow simply thought he was being romantic for Valentine's Day, even though it felt more extravagant than normal. She still didn’t suspect anything once she saw that he had decorated their cabin with roses, balloons, chocolate, and Champagne.The NBA player then requested her to take a seat next to him. When she did, he started reading one of his poems. She didn't realize her intuition was correct until the final line of the poem. Before Kyle Kuzma could even reveal the 8.5-carat oval-cut engagement ring with two baguette stones on the side, she said yes.On the other hand, Winnie Harlow also revealed the details of her engagement to the NBA player during her Call Her Daddy guest appearance.

1. Why is Travis Kelce facing criticism from NFL analysts in 2025?

2. What bold move did Andy Reid make during Chiefs training camp?

3. Is Travis Kelce still the top target for Patrick Mahomes in 2025?

Travis Kelce was once the most feared tight end in the NFL. For years, he dominated as the Kansas City Chiefs’ top pass-catching weapon. But in 2025, cracks may have appeared. At training camp, something changed and a veteran NFL analyst questioned whether defenses still fear him the way they used to. Meanwhile, Kansas City Chiefs coach Andy Reid made a surprising call at camp that added to the drama. Could this be Kelce’s turning point?In late July 2025, during an episode of ESPN’s First Take, NFL analyst Peter Schrager statedThis comment came as the Kansas City Chiefs began training camp on July 21 at Missouri Western State University in St. Joseph, Missouri. Schrager was not saying Kelce suddenly lost his talent. Instead, he pointed to a shift in perception. Defenders may no longer see him as that unstoppable threat.Schrager added that while Kelce still performs, the aura that once forced defenses to double‑cover him appears to be fading.Former NFL receiver Harry Douglas disagreed on the same show, firing back:Douglas argued Kelce’s experience still makes him dangerous in big moments. The debate signals a real question among NFL insiders: is Kelce still elite, or just experienced?Chiefs head coach Andy Reid, who had players report together with rookies and veterans on July 21, canceled the usual early outdoor practice session for camp. This was described as a last‑minute decision, meant to change the team’s mindset rather than focus on mechanics, sending a message to veterans and rookies alike.When asked about Kelce’s condition at camp, Reid said Kelce looked innoting he had lost weight and seemed more focused than ever at age 35. Reid praised Kelce asbut did not discuss retirement plans, saying he and Kelce have not spoken about it directly.This tension between Schrager’s doubts and Reid’s praise unfolded as the Chiefs try to recover from their Super Bowl 59 loss in early 2025 and prepare for their season opener, scheduled for September 5, 2025, in Brazil against the Los Angeles Chargers.NFL experts say Travis Kelce may not scare defenses like he used to, raising doubts about his role this season.Andy Reid canceled a major outdoor session early in camp to reset the team’s focus and energy.Despite the doubts, Travis Kelce remains Mahomes’ most trusted target as the Chiefs rebuild their offense.","Nfl experts say travis kelce may not scare defenses like he used to, raising doubts about his role this season.

FAQs

1. Why is Dillon Dube a free agent right now?

2. Which NHL teams are interested in signing Dillon Dube?

3. Was Dillon Dube found guilty in his recent legal case?

After being found not guilty in his recent trial, former Calgary Flames forward Dillon Dube is officially a free agent and looking to make his return to the NHL. Once considered a promising talent on the rise, Dube's development was derailed by off-ice distractions that plagued his final season in Calgary. But now that his name is legally cleared, several teams in need of depth and speed may see him as a low-risk, high-reward addition.Arguably the most logical landing spot for Dube is San Jose, a team desperate to improve its bottom-six forward group. The Sharks are still recovering from a dismal 2024-25 season, finishing 32nd overall. With a roster patchworked by failed free-agent experiments and unready prospects, San Jose could benefit from Dube’s experience and offensive upside.In 2022-23, the winger tallied 18 goals and 45 points at age 24—a level of production the Sharks would welcome with open arms. Players like Ryan Reaves still occupy roster spots, but Dube could help move the needle for a team clearly in rebuilding mode.The Kraken have made smart moves this offseason, but their bottom-six remains questionable. With players like John Hayden and Mitchell Stephens struggling to stay in the NHL lineup, and injury concerns hovering, Seattle could see Dube as a strategic addition.“Jani Nyman might be in and out of the lineup,” a source notes. “And injuries could flare up for the forward group again.” Seattle has the cap space and playoff ambitions—signing Dube on a one-year deal could provide both depth and flexibility.The Islanders know firsthand how devastating injuries can be to roster continuity. With new additions like Jonathan Drouin carrying injury baggage, the team would be wise to bolster its forward group with reliable depth. Dube could immediately challenge players like Pierre Engvall or Emil Heineman for a spot, adding speed and versatility in case of another injury wave.With a clean slate, a chip on his shoulder, and plenty of teams in need, Dillon Dube’s second act in the NHL may be just around the corner.Also Read: Justice denied?

Should he choose to explore the open market in 2026, he would become one of the most sought-after free agents in NHL history.Among those circling with interest are the Los Angeles Kings, a franchise that offers both a competitive roster and the allure of a big-market lifestyle. The team’s ambitions are no secret, and with a core built for postseason runs, McDavid could be the missing piece. NHL insider Chris Johnston recently stirred the pot on the Steve Dangle Podcast, stating, “If Connor McDavid became available in 2026, I’m sure it’s occurred to the Kings, the Rangers, Tampa; there’s probably 10 teams that would think they would be in the running if they ever got a chance. ”The Kings have one more card to play: newly appointed executive Ken Holland, who previously served as Edmonton’s general manager.His established rapport with McDavid and history of building contending rosters adds a compelling dynamic. If anyone can help sway McDavid toward Los Angeles, Holland certainly has the credentials.McDavid’s hypothetical move to L.A. wouldn’t just make headlines—it would send shockwaves through the Western Conference. His addition would catapult the Kings into elite company, positioning them as a favorite for the Stanley Cup. A talent like McDavid doesn’t just fit into a system—he elevates it, commanding attention every time he steps on the ice.As Edmonton clings to hopes of retaining their superstar, the rest of the league waits—and watches.

Why Seth Fits the Golden State Warriors’ Needs

Themay finally be making noise in the 2025 NBA offseason—and it’s a familiar sound. The franchise is reportedly interested in signing unrestricted free agent, reuniting him with his brother Stephen Curry in what could be a new era of Splash Brothers.After a mostly quiet offseason, the Warriors are now being linked to Seth Curry, who last played for the Charlotte Hornets . The news was first reported by ESPN’s Anthony Slater, who revealed that Golden State sees Seth as a viable option to bolster its second unit.“They want some extra shooting, another name I’m hearing with mutual interest is Seth Curry, actually, as a potential bench unit option with a family tie,” Slater said Thursday. (H/t: Sporting News)This move would not only enhance the Warriors’ depth but also bring a long-awaited dream to life—teaming the Curry brothers on the same NBA roster.In the 2024–25 season, Seth Curry quietly put together a solid campaign with the Charlotte Hornets. He appeared in 68 games and started 14 of them—his most starts in a season since 2016.Here’s a look at Seth’s career numbers:While he may not have the explosive scoring profile of his older brother, Seth has carved out his niche as one of the most consistent three-point shooters in the league. His 45.6% shooting from beyond the arc last season was a career best, reaffirming his value in today’s perimeter-heavy game.It might sound ironic, but the Golden State Warriors —once the poster team for three-point dominance—are in need of more perimeter shooting. The departure of Klay Thompson has left a gap that current players like Jimmy Butler and Moses Moody can’t fully replicate.Golden State had also been exploring deals for DeAnthony Melton, Al Horford, and Jonathan Kuminga, but none of those moves have materialized yet. In the absence of a big splash, Seth offers a more realistic and immediate solution.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Milwaukee Bucks Eyeing $28 Million Brooklyn Nets Star Following Contract Rejection The Golden State Warriors may have stumbled through the early part of free agency, but the potential signing of Seth could offer both a feel-good story and real on-court benefits. With Stephen Curry still leading the charge and a front office that knows how to maximize sharpshooting talent, adding Seth to the roster might just be the boost Golden State needs heading into the 2025–26 season.",Golden state warriors reportedly interested in signing unrestricted free agent seth curry.

Angel Reese

A Rookie Phenomenon at the Heart of the Chicago Sky’s Season

Sunday’s Roster Shake-Up Raises Eyebrows

Why This Matters: Angel Reese’s Absence Could Derail the Chicago Sky’s Playoff Push

Thewere dealt a tough blow on Sunday as questions surrounding the status of their breakout rookieadded yet another twist to a season already riddled with adversity. With the franchise battling mounting injuries, roster instability, and increasing pressure in the playoff race, the timing couldn’t be worse.Angel Reese has been the heartbeat of the Chicago Sky’s 2025 WNBA campaign. At just 23, the All-Star rookie has dazzled fans and analysts alike with her consistent double-doubles and relentless energy. She recently became the fifth-fastest player in franchise history to hit 750 points, a testament to her rapid rise and impact. Angel Reese ’s intensity has fueled the Chicago Sky’s resilience, offering fans renewed hope following seasons of instability. Her strong paint presence, vocal leadership, and signature swagger—including a now-viral postgame rant about questionable officiating—have made her one of the most magnetic figures in the league.“We only had two free throws up until the fourth quarter, and when I asked the ref, she told me it’s not her job,” Reese said after a narrow loss to Minnesota—an outburst that sparked debate and reflected her unfiltered passion.The latest concern emerged when the Karli Bell gave us an update that ruled Angel and Hailey OUT of the game. Furthermore, Chicago Sky signed guard Marquesha Davis to a hardship contract, typically reserved for emergency situations when teams fall below the minimum roster threshold.In a season where Reese has become the central pillar of the team’s on-court identity—especially with Ariel Atkins already out due to injury—her absence pulls up concern across the roster.With a razor-thin bench and Angel Reese being Chicago’s only All-Star this season, any stretch without her significantly compromises the team’s competitiveness. The Sky rely heavily on her defense, rebounding, and scoring. Without her, they face an uphill battle in a crowded playoff race.Reese’s situation also comes amid a broader backdrop of league-wide tension. The WNBA is inching toward collective bargaining negotiations, and players like Reese have stepped up to speak about working conditions and compensation. Her growing off-court voice has added a layer of advocacy to her already powerful on-court presence.Despite the turbulence, the Chicago Sky have produced some of the season’s most memorable moments. From Angel Reese’s fearless attitude to the team’s ability to grind out wins with a depleted roster, their grit remains undeniable. The addition of Davis, while born out of necessity, could be another unexpected storyline in a rollercoaster season.As of now, the Sky have not issued a formal statement detailing Reese’s condition. However, the roster changes and her online commentary offer a strong hint that she is currently out of action—temporarily, fans hope.Also read: Los Angeles Lakers Bring in Four Undrafted Rookies on Exhibit 10 Deals Ahead of 2025-26 Season With their playoff hopes hanging in the balance, the Chicago Sky will be hoping Angel Reese’s return is imminent. If not, the franchise risks losing momentum at a crucial stretch, with their season—and possibly more—on the line.","Angel reese has been the heartbeat of the chicago sky’s 2025 wnba campaign.
