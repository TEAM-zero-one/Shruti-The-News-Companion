Anna Kournikova and Enrique Iglesias’ family life in Miami

“It was just meant to be sweet in the moment. I honestly didn’t mean to confuse people.

I thought it’d be easier for the audience to understand than if I said ‘my girl.’”

“I’ve never really thought marriage would make a difference. Maybe it’s because I come from divorced parents, but I don’t think you love someone more because of a piece of paper.”

The couple first met in 2001 when Kournikova appeared in Enrique Iglesias’s music video for his hit single Escape. Although they have been together for over two decades, they have never confirmed if they are married. Iglesias once explained in 2012:He also shared his views on marriage, saying:The couple recently expanded their property portfolio in Miami by purchasing a five-bedroom home in Bay Point for $6.5 million, according to the Miami Herald.Also Read: “No Room For Emotions”: Novak Djokovic Reveals How Athlete Stereotypes Hurt His Relationship With Wife Jelena While Enrique Iglesias continues touring worldwide, Kournikova has kept a very low profile.

“I started playing baseball when I was six years old in T-ball. I loved it. I’ve picked up a tennis racket a good amount, but it was always hard for me to keep that ball in between the lines. I just wanted to hit that thing as far as I could. Baseball had my love since day one.”

Givani Smith joins Hurricanes on a professional try-out contract



Hurricanes seek depth to finally overcome Eastern Conference Final struggles



The Carolina Hurricanes are turning to an unlikely source as they prepare for a season that could define their future. After falling to the Florida Panthers in the Eastern Conference Final, Carolina is determined to find answers. One of those answers could come from a familiar face in Florida, as the Canes announced professional try-out deals with forward Givani Smith and defenseman Oliver Kylington ahead of training camp.The most intriguing signing for Hurricanes fans is Givani Smith. Once a teammate of Matthew Tkachuk during his stint with the Florida Panthers, Smith now finds himself battling for relevance in Raleigh. His path to this moment has been anything but steady. Drafted 46th overall by the Detroit Red Wings in 2016, Smith debuted in the NHL during the 2019–20 season, scoring two goals and adding an assist in 21 games.His time in Detroit eventually led to a trade to the Panthers in 2022, where he struggled to cement a role on a deep roster. Though part of the group that made a magical run to the Stanley Cup Final in 2023, Smith played just a single postseason game and failed to register a point. Since then, he has become a journeyman, making stops with the Sharks, Avalanche, and Flyers. Now, Carolina presents a last-chance window for the 26-year-old forward to prove his worth.For Carolina, the motivation behind these signings is no mystery. The franchise has repeatedly stumbled at the same hurdle, winning just one of its last 17 games in the Eastern Conference Final. The addition of Smith offers grit and a physical edge, while Kylington provides a potential boost to the blue line with his experience from Calgary, Colorado, and Anaheim.The message is clear: the Hurricanes are willing to take risks if it means breaking their postseason curse. Smith may not be the star that headlines the lineup, but his hunger to stick in the NHL could align perfectly with a Carolina squad desperate to climb over its long-standing wall.Also Read: Edmonton Oilers captain Connor McDavid appears destined for maximum deal as analyst reveals extension proof",Carolina hurricanes announce professional try-out deals with givani smith and oliver kylington.

Fans furious at Connor Bedard’s ranking while defending other rising stars

Connor Bedard’s growth and Blackhawks’ hopes for their franchise star

The NHL Network’s latest list ranking the top 25 players under 25 years old has set social media ablaze, with Chicago Blackhawks star Connor Bedard at the center of the debate. Despite being touted as one of the league’s brightest young talents, Bedard landed in the eighth spot—far lower than many fans expected.The list placed Buffalo Sabres defenseman Rasmus Dahlin, New Jersey Devils forward Jack Hughes, and Ottawa Senators’ Tim Stutzle in the top three. But for many hockey fans, it was Bedard’s ranking that felt most disrespectful.“The Connor Bedard hate is hilarious. No chance he’s 8th hahahaha,” one fan wrote on X, echoing the sentiment of many others who felt the 2023 first overall pick should have been higher. Another fan blasted the list as an “absolute joke,” while others argued players like Lucas Raymond and Matvei Michkov were also undervalued.Not all reactions, however, defended Bedard. Some fans argued that his résumé didn’t yet justify a higher placement. “Based off what? Lol. What has Bedard done? Lucas Raymond will make you pay for your sins,” one user wrote, pointing out the small sample size of his NHL career.Since entering the league, Bedard has recorded 128 points in 150 games—a solid start for a 19-year-old forward leading a rebuilding Chicago team.NHL insider Frank Seravalli revealed that Bedard has been working on his skating and angling, while also developing a “shoot-first mentality” with a release he ranked second only to Auston Matthews.Also Read: Connor Bedard’s contract extension could wait until 2026 despite Frank Nazar’s $46M deal, says NHL analyst Bedard is now entering the final year of his entry-level contract, and the Blackhawks will likely push to lock him into a long-term extension.

Is Jack Eichel overrated despite his Stanley Cup win?



Looking ahead: Eichel’s legacy on the line



The Vegas Golden Knights have leaned heavily on Jack Eichel since acquiring him in 2021, and he hasn’t disappointed. With a career-best 94 points in 77 games last season and a central role in securing the 2023 Stanley Cup, Eichel’s impact is undeniable. Yet, his recent placement in NHL Network’s top-20 centers list has stirred controversy, leaving fans and analysts questioning whether his ranking reflects reality or reputation.When the rankings placed Connor McDavid , Nathan MacKinnon, Leon Draisaitl, Aleksander Barkov, and Sidney Crosby in the top five, many expected Eichel to be close behind. Instead, his lower-than-anticipated position triggered debate. Former Toronto Maple Leafs forward Jay Rosehill, speaking on Leafs Morning Take, was particularly candid. He argued that context matters more than pure numbers when evaluating Eichel’s status.Rosehill remarked, “The one guy I looked at is Jack Eichel. I understand he’s got a cup, but it’s not like he won the Masters, like it was a purely individual effort.” In his view, Eichel benefited from being part of a well-constructed Vegas roster, rather than carrying the team singlehandedly. He added that not every player with a championship ring automatically deserves to be elevated into the sport’s pantheon.Still, Rosehill admitted that Eichel’s production places him among the NHL’s best forwards, even if he stops short of generational status. With mid-90s points last season and the potential to break the 100-point barrier, Eichel remains an elite offensive force—just perhaps not on the same tier as legends like Crosby or Draisaitl.The coming seasons may be decisive in shaping how Eichel is remembered. His current trajectory suggests he’ll remain a cornerstone for the Golden Knights, but the question lingers—can he transcend being “a piece of it” and build a legacy as one of the league’s most dominant individual talents?With a possible mega-contract extension looming next summer, the spotlight on Eichel will only intensify. For now, his blend of skill, consistency, and championship pedigree keeps him firmly in the conversation, even if opinions differ on just how high he belongs in the NHL hierarchy.Also Read: Edmonton Oilers captain Connor McDavid appears destined for maximum deal as analyst reveals extension proof","Ex-leafs forward downplays golden knights star’s ranking, sparking heated debate among nhl fans and analysts alike.

Connor McDavid prioritizes patience and perspective

Edmonton’s confidence in their captain’s future

The future of Connor McDavid , widely considered the best player in hockey today, has been a constant source of speculation in Edmonton and across the NHL. With just one season left on his current eight-year, $100 million contract, fans and analysts alike have wondered if the Oilers captain is prepared to lock in his long-term future or test the waters of free agency. This week, McDavid addressed those questions directly, offering insight into why he isn’t in a hurry to make a decision.Speaking to reporters, Connor McDavid emphasized that his approach hasn’t changed since the summer. “I said at the end of June, I had every intention to take my time with it, and I still feel the same way,” he explained. “I’ll take my time and go through everything with my family, my agent, and everybody involved.”While his next deal will likely reshape the league financially, McDavid stressed that his focus remains on winning. “I have every intention to win in Edmonton,” he said. “That’s my only focus, maybe next to winning a gold medal with Canada. But that is my intention: to win there.”Despite the uncertainty, Oilers leadership remains optimistic. Jeff Jackson, the team’s CEO of hockey operations and McDavid’s former agent, downplayed concerns of a prolonged saga.“He has another year. He loves playing in Edmonton… It’s not going to be a long negotiation,” Jackson said on The Sheet with Jeff Marek Podcast.With training camp set to open on September 17 and the season beginning October 8 against rival Calgary, McDavid is determined to keep the focus on hockey. “All options are on the table, really,” he said. “We’re going through it slowly.”Also Read: Amid contract deadline Connor McDavid and Lauren Kyle spark buzz as they take a private jet back to Edmonton","The future of connor mcdavid has been a constant source of speculation in edmonton and across the nhl.

“There’s a whole lot of attention, also off the court. And I was also very surprised to see some pictures, which are nothing serious. I’m not in a relationship.

So, whoever is asking, it’s all good.”

“Yes, but let’s not talk about my private life.”

Jannik Sinner may be the new name in the personal life talks of Sports Illustrated model Brooks Nader. The rumor began when Brooks’ sisters gave a cheeky clue about him during a radio appearance in New York. The Italian tennis star, who is World No. 1 right now, is also single after ending his relationship with Anna Kalinskaya earlier this year. Brooks Nader too is single after splitting from professional dancer Gleb Savchenko. The timing has left fans curious if the two could actually be texting each other.Brooks Nader and her sisters Mary Holland, Grace Ann, and Sarah Jane joined Page Six Radio in New York earlier this week for a light-hearted chat. While speaking about Brooks’ dating life, her sisters dropped a playful hint that caught everyone’s attention. They said she might be getting messages from Jannik Sinner, making a joke that his last name “rhymes with winner.”Brooks, 28, laughed off the moment but did not deny it either. She admitted she has “a little roster” of people texting her, but chose not to name anyone. Her recent split from Dancing with the Stars professional Gleb Savchenko in early 2025 has kept her personal life in the headlines.The Sports Illustrated swimsuit model is no stranger to public attention, but her sisters’ tease linking her to the World No. 1 tennis player made this moment stand out. Fans online quickly picked it up, sparking debate over whether the Italian star is really in her DMs.Earlier in May 2025, Jannik Sinner confirmed he was single after ending his relationship with Russian tennis player Anna Kalinskaya. The couple had gone public with a kiss at the 2024 US Open in New York, after Sinner’s title win. Their split came without any public explanation.Even before that, during his training in Monte Carlo in April 2025, the 23-year-old was spotted with Russian model Lara Leito. Paparazzi photos quickly led to speculation, but Jannik Sinner dismissed it, saying:Then in July 2025, Danish influencer Laila Hasanovic was seen in Sinner’s player box at Wimbledon in London. That sighting again triggered rumors, but no one involved confirmed a relationship.Also Read: Andre Agassi And Steffi Graf’s Daughter Jaz Makes Rare US Open Appearance With Father And Gives Glimpse Of Her Boyfriend Finally, in an interview with Corriere della Sera earlier this summer, when asked directly if he was in love, Jannik Sinner replied:Right now, with Brooks Nader’s sisters hinting at him on radio, Sinner’s name is once again at the center of attention. On the court, he is defending his US Open 2025 title in New York, starting strong with a straight-sets win over Vit Kopriva.","Jannik sinner linked with sports illustrated model brooks nader as sisters hint at new york radio show.

Multiple overdoses and concerns about prescribed treatments

A complicated man who left his mark on the NFL



Indianapolis Colts owner Jim Irsay, who passed away in May at the age of 65, spent much of his final years battling addiction behind the scenes. While fans knew him as one of the NFL ’s most outspoken and passionate owners, a new report from The Washington Post sheds light on the troubling private struggles that marked his last chapter.Irsay, who had long been candid about his history with substance abuse, reportedly suffered at least three overdoses in the final five years of his life. According to the report, his addiction specialist, Dr. Harry Haroutunian, prescribed him significant amounts of opioids and ketamine as part of a treatment plan. Sources revealed that Irsay had been given more than 200 opioid pills shortly before two overdoses in December 2023.One of those incidents occurred at Irsay’s Carmel, Indiana home, where first responders found him unresponsive on a bathroom floor. He was revived after receiving Narcan, a life-saving opioid antagonist. Less than two weeks later, he reportedly overdosed again at a Miami resort. Another episode took place in 2020 while vacationing in Turks and Caicos, requiring hospitalization.Haroutunian defended his approach, saying, “I dedicated 18 months of my life to try to care for him … as a brother.We did everything we could to make him as comfortable as possible.” Still, several people close to Irsay questioned whether the treatments were helping or enabling his relapses.Irsay’s official cause of death was cardiac arrest caused by acute pneumonia, but his long battle with addiction overshadowed his final years. In a candid 2023 interview with HBO’s Real Sports, he admitted he had been to rehab “at least 15 times” and even once overdosed while trying to detox on his own.Also Read: “Dear Son..."": Travis Hunter welcomes baby boy with wife Leanna in emotional surprise for fans everywhere amidst all breakup rumors Despite his personal struggles, Irsay’s contributions to the NFL remain significant. He inherited the Colts from his father in 1997 and oversaw their rise into a Super Bowl-winning franchise. His openness about addiction also made him a rare figure in pro sports ownership—flawed, vulnerable, but unafraid to speak about demons many keep hidden.","Jim irsay suffered at least three overdoses in the final five years of his life.

Engagement joy collides with questions about Travis Kelce’s retirement

The engagement of pop superstar Taylor Swift and Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce was bound to be a headline-grabber, but the announcement has gone far beyond romance. Within hours of Swift sharing dreamy photos of Kelce on one knee in a flower-filled garden, their personal milestone had transformed into a global entertainment and sports storyline.The entertainment-sports crossover has reached new levels, with betting markets quickly posting odds on who might stand alongside the couple during their big day. Unsurprisingly, Jason Kelce, Travis’s older brother and former Philadelphia Eagles center, is the overwhelming favorite to serve as best man at -5000. His close bond with Travis, from their “New Heights” podcast to their historic Super Bowl clash in 2023, makes him the obvious choice.Swift’s bridal party has sparked even more intrigue. Childhood best friend Abigail Anderson Lucier leads the maid of honor betting line at +350, followed by model Martha Hunt (+400) and fashion star Karlie Kloss (+500). Pop icon Selena Gomez is also listed at +500, adding fuel to fan speculation that her appearance could turn the wedding into a true cultural spectacle.The betting doesn’t stop at the aisle. Novelty wagers already extend to when the couple might start a family and whether Swift will finally accept the NFL’s repeated offers to headline the Super Bowl halftime show, a stage she has famously declined in the past.Amid the excitement, Chiefs fans can’t ignore a more sobering reality—Kelce’s NFL future. Now 35 and entering his 13th season, his production dipped in 2024, culminating in a quiet performance during the Super Bowl loss to the Eagles. Whispers of retirement grew louder in the offseason, even as Kelce confirmed his return for 2025.Also Read: From breakup ballads to wedding anthems: Will Taylor Swift’s engagement to Travis Kelce change her music and next era?

Michael Jordan wins $8.9 million lawsuit against Dominick’s in 2015

Michael Jordan donates the proceeds and supports Chicago children

Also Read:

Even after retiring from the NBA, Michael Jordan has remained a strong and determined figure. Off the court, he is just as careful about his rights as he was about his game. One story from 2015 shows how seriously he protects his personal identity. Jordan’s actions sent a clear message about defending personal rights and giving back to the community at the same time.The case began in Chicago, Illinois, where Michael Jordan, the Hall of Famer and six-time NBA champion, noticed his name was used without permission. The Chicago-based supermarket chain Dominick’s, a subsidiary of Safeway that later closed in 2013, ran an advertisement in 2011 featuring Jordan’s name to promote a meat sale in a Sports Illustrated special issue. Jordan’s legal team said the chain had no right to use his name.The supermarket first offered a settlement of about $126,900, but Michael Jordan’s lawyers argued that the sum should match the real advertising value of his name. After the court reviewed the case, Jordan won $8.9 million. ESPN reported his comments after the verdict, saying,“No one, whether or not they’re a public figure, should have to worry about their identity being used without their permission.”Jordan added, “I hope this case sends a clear message…that I will continue to be vigilant about protecting my name and identity.”He further added:""The case was not about the money, as I plan to donate the proceeds to charity. It was about honesty and integrity.... I also hope the size of the monetary reward will deter others from using someone else's identity and believing they will only pay a small penalty.""Michael Jordan made it clear that the lawsuit was not about money. Instead, it was about integrity, honesty, and defending his personal rights. He pledged to donate the full $8.9 million to 23 charities in Chicago that support children’s health, education, and well-being. In a news release shared with ABA Journal, Jordan said, “Chicago has given me so much, and I want to give back to its kids, the city’s future.”At 62, Michael Jordan stands as more than a basketball legend—he is a cultural icon. The Dominick’s case highlights how he fiercely defends his rights and turns his victories into ways to help others.His careful attention to personal identity also comes amid other legal challenges, such as his 2015 lawsuit in China against Qiaodan Sports, which uses his name and number 23 without permission. This story originally appeared on ESPN and ABA Journal and highlights Michael Jordan’s commitment to personal rights, community support, and integrity both on and off the courtWith a $10 million contribution to Novant, Michael Jordan helped open his fourth ""Michael Jordan Family Medical Clinic"" in Wilmington, his hometown, in February 2025. The facility, which is 7,300-sq-ft and open to patients from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., offers primary care services in twelve patient rooms for underinsured and uninsured patients across five operating days each weekday. Building on earlier Charlotte and Wilmington clinics, Jordan's sincere comments stressed the importance of providing premium healthcare access to the neighborhood that molded him.","""i want to give back to kids"" - michael jordan proudly donated $8.9 million after winning supermarket lawsuit in 2015.

Engagement puts spotlight on Taylor Swift’s fortune and celebrity parallels

The engagement of Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce and global superstar Taylor Swift has captivated fans far beyond football, but the fairytale moment also carries weighty implications for Kelce’s future in the NFL. At 35 and entering the last year of his contract, questions are growing louder about whether this will be his final season.NFL veteran analyst Pete Prisco didn’t hold back when evaluating where Kelce stands at this stage. “He is in the final year of his deal. He is coming to the end of his career... And he wasn't that good last year, but he seemed to be refocused this off season,” Prisco said on CBS Sports.He even noted that Kelce “almost looked lean at times” in 2024, lacking his trademark explosiveness, though preseason flashes with Patrick Mahomes have reassured fans that the connection is still intact.Kelce’s playoff dip last year — just 175 receiving yards, his lowest since 2018 — fueled the narrative that age may finally be catching up. Still, his reported renewed commitment in the gym and offseason preparation suggests he’s eager to write one last chapter worthy of his Hall of Fame résumé.Beyond football, Kelce’s engagement has triggered cultural comparisons to one of the most famous athlete-celebrity marriages of the past: Tom Brady and Gisele Bündchen.Analyst Chris Hassel quipped, “That’s chump change for Taylor. I mean, it’s like Tom Brady with his wife. She was making more too.”With Swift’s billion-dollar empire dwarfing Kelce’s $17 million annual salary, even Prisco joked that Kelce had “married up.” But just like Brady and Bündchen, the fascination lies not in the money but in the intersection of sports greatness and pop culture royalty.Also Read: Taylor Swift proves the number 13 is her destiny as she gets engaged to her 13th boyfriend Travis Kelce For Chiefs fans, however, the bigger question is whether Kelce’s walk down the aisle will also lead to his walk away from the game.","Travis kelce and taylor swift's engagement has captivated fans far beyond football.

A legacy that goes beyond trophies and lives in lasting loyalty

Youth For Tomorrow

Joe Gibbs has been called a mastermind, a strategist, even a genius. But the truest measure of his legacy is not just the Super Bowls or the NASCAR titles. It is the loyalty he inspired — from quarterbacks and pit crews to billion-dollar sponsors — that made him the rare architect of dynasties across two very different worlds.When Gibbs took over Washington’s NFL team in 1981, few expected greatness. His debut season opened with five painful defeats. Yet, instead of folding, he rallied his men, rewrote the playbook, and built a team that refused to quit. In just two years, he was hoisting the Lombardi Trophy.What set him apart was not only strategy but connection. Over 16 seasons, he won three Super Bowls — each with a different quarterback. “Coach Gibbs made you believe you could be the one,” former players often recall. That belief turned ordinary men into champions and a city into believers.In 1992, Gibbs walked away from the NFL spotlight to chase an untested dream: NASCAR ownership. He had never driven competitively, never run a team. But he knew how to build trust. With Interstate Batteries backing him, Joe Gibbs Racing was born.Just a year later, Dale Jarrett gave the team its first Daytona 500 win.More victories followed, but what endured was the culture Gibbs planted. He didn’t run garages like factories — he ran them like families. “You felt like you were building something that mattered,” one crew member reflected. That sense of belonging became JGR’s fuel.Modern sports sponsorships are notoriously fleeting. Yet, Gibbs forged one of the longest partnerships in NASCAR history. Interstate Batteries, his very first backer, is still with JGR more than 30 years later.“Joe Gibbs Racing gave Interstate Batteries national recognition,” company leaders often say, but the truth runs deeper: Gibbs gave them trust. In an era of quick exits and shifting allegiances, his ability to nurture loyalty turned business deals into lifelong bonds.The loyalty story finds its purest expression in Denny Hamlin. Signed by Gibbs as a young driver, Hamlin has now spent 20 years under the same banner — an eternity in modern racing. This July, he extended that bond with a new multi-year contract.“It is just really special when you think about everything we’ve experienced over the past 20 years,” Gibbs said when the deal was announced. In Hamlin’s 58 Cup wins and three Daytona 500 triumphs lies a simple truth: loyalty, not just speed, wins championships.Gibbs is the only man enshrined in both the Pro Football Hall of Fame and the NASCAR Hall of Fame. But beyond the plaques, what makes him timeless is the culture he built. Whether on the gridiron or at the track, he created families — not factories, believers — not just employees.And that is the secret: trophies tarnish, records fall, but loyalty lasts. Joe Gibbs didn’t just master two sports. He mastered the art of keeping people together.Also read: Māori All Black Shane Christie passes away at 39, rocking rugby and reigniting the concussion crisis debate Beyond sports, Joe Gibbs also foundedin 1986, a nonprofit home for at-risk children in Virginia, showing his commitment to building futures off the field and track.","Gibbs is the only man enshrined in both the pro football hall of fame and the nascar hall of fame.

Cincinnati Bengals double down on Ja’Marr Chase and Tee Higgins as NFL shifts back to the run game,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/cincinnati-bengals-double-down-on-jamarr-chase-and-tee-higgins-as-nfl-shifts-back-to-the-run-game/articleshow/123563709.cms,"Ja’Marr Chase and Tee Higgins (Getty Images)

Beyond the money: Ja’Marr Chase and Tee Higgins share a rare bond off the field

Why the Bengals believe this duo changes everything

The NFL may be shifting back toward run-heavy offenses, but in Cincinnati, the Bengals are doubling down on the passing game—and on the dynamic duo of Ja’Marr Chase and Tee Higgins. Both wideouts inked massive extensions earlier this year, with Chase signing a four-year, $161 million deal and Higgins landing $115 million over four years. Together, they now form the highest-paid wide receiver tandem in league history.What makes this partnership unique isn’t just their talent, but the relationship they’ve built beyond football. From shopping for exotic cars in Florida to hosting “Taco Tuesday” gatherings for teammates, Chase and Higgins embody a chemistry that’s shaping the Bengals’ locker room culture. Higgins, who jokes about turning a wall in his new Florida home into a jellyfish tank, and Chase, who admits he’s tired of being asked to perform the Griddy, share a friendship rooted in honesty and accountability.Higgins recalls a moment when Chase mistakenly set up a play that left him blindsided. Chase didn’t sugarcoat it, walking over to say simply, “S---. My f---ing bad, bro.” For both players, that honesty became a building block for trust—a rare trait in a position group often plagued by ego.On the field, their impact is undeniable. Chase’s ability to command double coverage opens lanes for Higgins, while Higgins’ presence prevents defenses from focusing solely on Chase.
