Long term:

Thetrading Roki Sasaki to theforis not tied to any confirmed talks, but the idea has gained attention this offseason. The scenario reflects two teams with different priorities. Los Angeles is built to compete for titles now, while Detroit is still shaping a roster for the future.If a deal like this were completed, both pitching staffs would change immediately. The Dodgers would add one of the league’s most reliable starters, and the Tigers would receive a younger pitcher who could anchor their rotation for years. It is a classic exchange of present value for long-term control.Most projections follow a similar structure.• LHP Tarik Skubal (29, entering his final pre-free-agency season in 2026).• RHP Roki Sasaki (24, signed in 2025 with multiple years of team control).• One or two high-level prospects, likely close to the majors.Since Skubal is approaching free agency and Detroit is not yet a clear contender, the Tigers would likely demand players who can contribute soon. Sasaki fits that requirement because he is already progressing toward a full major-league role.The Los Angeles Dodgers project strong depth with Blake Snell, Yoshinobu Yamamoto, Sasaki, and additional options such as Bobby Miller, Gavin Stone, and Michael Grove. Adding Skubal, a two-time Cy Young winner with a sub-2.00 ERA across recent seasons, would further stabilize the group.A rotation led by Skubal, Snell, and Yamamoto would give Los Angeles several postseason-caliber starters even after trading Sasaki.Tarik Skubal is projected to earn around $32 million through arbitration before becoming a free agent after the 2026 season. For the Los Angeles Dodgers, that is a manageable one-year commitment if it improves their chances of winning.Tarik Skubal enters his age-29 season and could command a contract exceeding $300 million if his performance continues. For a team still building toward contention, that level of commitment carries risk.• A 29-year-old Cy Young winner nearing free agencyfor• A 24-year-old starter with several years of control.Roki Sasaki’s minor-league results and brief MLB appearances point to strong strikeout ability and upper-90s velocity, though he has yet to prove himself across a full season.Detroit Tigers’ reported asking price suggests the club wants multiple premium assets. A package centered on Sasaki would help rebuild organizational depth, remove a possible $30 million-plus arbitration salary, and align the roster with a later competitive window.• Add a proven frontline starter.• Avoid a long-term contract commitment.• Maintain rotation depth.• Lose a young pitcher with long-term upside.• Take on a large arbitration salary.• Risk losing Skubal after one season.• Gain a younger starter with team control.• Avoid a costly arbitration year and future contract.• Add additional prospects.• Trade one of the league’s top pitchers.• Depend on Sasaki’s development and health.• Possibly extend the rebuild timeline.The age gap explains the logic behind the proposal. Detroit would prioritize long-term value, while Los Angeles would focus on immediate results.The Dodgers would likely benefit first. A rotation featuring Skubal, Snell, and Yamamoto would raise their chances of another title.Detroit could come out ahead if Sasaki develops into a frontline starter while remaining cost-controlled through his prime.Also read: MLB trade rumors: New York Yankees potentially land $5 million Arizona Diamondbacks in a blockbuster deal to support Trent Grisham ahead of deadline Overall: The result would depend on performance and health. A championship would justify the Dodgers’ decision, while Sasaki reaching ace level would make the trade a key step in Detroit’s rebuild. Both teams could meet their goals, but on different timelines.",The los angeles dodgers and detroit tigers could make a deal for roki sasaki.

Kaavia made a surprise appearance during the interview and posed a question for her mother.She said, “Hi, my name is Kaavia and I want to ask you some questions. Why did you want to be in GOAT, mommy? It is about animals but why?”Gabrielle got visibly surprised and emotional as she started her response. She stated, “Oh my gosh! Well okay, she knows I love animals. I forced her [Kaavia] to go to this farm that saves farm animals. It was like a farm animal rescue and she was like, ‘I hate it here.’” Gabrielle imitated Kaavia’s expression and further added, “I am an animal lover, but it’s also, you know, a take on basketball. But the game is called Roarball. And it's about underdogs and learning that you should never let anyone put a ceiling on your dreams. And anyone is capable of doing amazing things with their lives if just given a chance and a bit of encouragement.”In another interview, Gabrielle Union was asked about her experience of playing the character of Jett Fillmore in the upcoming GOAT movie. The American actress stated, “She is this big cat [Jett] and I am a dog person. So just like how she moves and how bigger entity taking up a different amount of space…it was very much of a challenge.” She further added, “I studied my husband, I studied Bron, I studied Teresa Witherspoon and I tried to get a lot of how they play. How to play bigger than they were.” Now we know where Gabrielle got the inspiration from to play a character totally opposite to her.","Gabrielle union appeared on today with jenna and sheinelle to promote goat movie.

Jorge Masvidal believes beating Islam Makhachev would redefine Ilia Topuria’s greatness



Ilia Topuria is already seen by many fans and fighters as a rare talent in the UFC. His rise across weight divisions has been fast and dominant. With knockout wins over elite champions, Topuria has built a reputation as a fearless finisher. Now, talk around his legacy has reached a new level. A possible fight with Islam Makhachev has sparked debate across the MMA world.Former UFC welterweight star Jorge Masvidal believes that one win could change everything. According to him, if Topuria defeats Makhachev at welterweight, the sport would have a new standard of greatness. Masvidal feels such an achievement would place Topuria above all past legends. In his view, it would redefine what true dominance in MMA looks like.Speaking on the Death Row MMA podcast, Jorge Masvidal hailed Ilia Topuria. He explained that moving up to 170 pounds and defeating Islam Makhachev would be the hardest task of Topuria’s career. Masvidal pointed out that no fighter has ever won UFC titles in three weight divisions. Because of that, he said this challenge would be historic.Masvidal added that if Topuria managed to pull it off, there would be no argument left. In his opinion, Topuria would stand alone at the top of MMA history. He compared such a moment to Michael Jordan ’s status in basketball. Masvidal said fighters like Jon Jones and Georges St-Pierre would no longer be fair comparisons.He believes Topuria would deserve his own category of greatness.He also explained why Topuria’s achievements already stand out. Masvidal said many double champions did not always fight the true best in their divisions. Some won belts against interim champions or during weak periods. He stressed that Topuria’s path has been different. He highlighted wins over Alexander Volkanovski and Max Holloway while both were still in their prime. He also praised Topuria’s victory over Charles Oliveira, calling the run almost unreal.Meanwhile, Topuria has spoken honestly about Islam Makhachev moving up to welterweight. When Makhachev left lightweight to face Jack Della Maddalena, some accused him of avoiding Topuria. Topuria dismissed that idea. He said Makhachev was chasing his own goals.

Shaquille O’Neal slams Paul George’s mental health claims

Paul George faced a suspension for 25 games in the current 2025-2026 NBA season. The Philadelphia 76ers star was punished for violating the league’s anti-drug policy. While the athlete has issued statements defending his act, not everyone is accepting the excuse. George’s excuse was that he was using the substance to aid his mental health. The statement was starkly criticized by the members of the NBA community and athletes across other sports as well. NFL legend Michael Irvin was the latest to mock George’s suspension. Irvin even wished for the NBA athlete to receive the help he needed.Irvin made the statement in the recent episode of the It Is What It Is podcast. Irvin referred to his own incident in the 1990s when the athlete was caught with an illegal substance. The NFL legend wished that he had used the same excuse as George did now. It might have reduced his sentence.In 1996, the then-NFL star Michael Irvin and his teammate Alfredo Roberts were busted at a Texas hotel. The duo was found in possession of illegal substances and was accompanied by two other women. Even though initially, he was supposed to face 20 years in prison, in the end, he faced four years of deferred probation.It was because he pleaded no contest to the charges imposed on him. During the It Is What It Is podcast episode, Irvin referred to this life incident and mocked the NBA athlete Paul George.Irvin stated, “When the cops hit that door at that hotel room and busted like, ‘Hands up! What are you doing here?’ I should have said, ‘I got some mental health issues. You all gotta leave now, because I have got some mental health issues.’” He mocked George’s excuse and everyone present at the podcast broke into laughter. Irvin further added, “When you put it up under mental health, what do you say to it, when somebody’s saying they’re doing it for mental health? That’s just such a broad scope of things. When you put it under mental health, you drew that cover that nobody can really say anything about.” Towards the end, the former NFL star added, “I hope he gets the help he needs.”No one seems to be willing to accept Paul George’s mental health claims. The Philadelphia 76ers star was suspended for 25 games for violating the league’s Anti-Drug policies. While Paul tried to defend his act, stating mental health issues, Shaquille O’Neal was one of the first individuals to criticize these claims. Shaquille stated, “I just want to say that they give us a booklet on what to do and what not to do… They also give you, inside the booklet, how long it takes you to get rid of something. So, I don’t want to elaborate on what he was doing, but stuff like this should not happen.” Kenny Smith partially agreed to Shaquille’s statement while raising certain doubts on the NBA’s decision.",Paul george faced a suspension for 25 games in the current 2025-2026 nba season.

A record breaking run without recognition

Voting process under scrutiny

The New England Patriots may be back in Super Bowl contention, but two of the franchise’s most influential figures will not be heading to Canton this year. Owner Robert Kraft has been left out of the Pro Football Hall of Fame Class of 2026 just days after legendary head coach Bill Belichick was also snubbed in his first year of eligibility.Kraft was a finalist in the contributor category but failed to secure the minimum 40 votes required from the 50-member selection committee. Under Hall of Fame rules, voters must select three of the five finalists in the contributor and senior category. Only candidates receiving at least 40 votes are inducted. If none reaches that mark, the highest vote-getter advances.This year’s group included Belichick, along with former players Roger Craig, Ken Anderson and L.C. Greenwood. With both Kraft and Belichick falling short, at least one of the player finalists will be part of the Class of 2026.The snub is particularly striking given Kraft’s role in building one of the most dominant dynasties in NFL history. Since purchasing the Patriots for $172 million in 1994, Kraft has overseen six Super Bowl championships and 10 appearances, the most by any owner in league history during that span.The Patriots are currently tied with the Pittsburgh Steelers for the most Super Bowl wins in NFL history. A victory in Super Bowl LX would put New England alone at the top. Belichick was hired by Kraft in 2000, leading the franchise to six titles over an 18-year run. His combined 333 regular-season and playoff victories rank second all-time behind Don Shula.NFL commissioner Roger Goodell expressed confidence that both men will eventually be inducted. “They are spectacular. They have contributed so much to this game, and I believe they will be Hall of Famers,” Goodell said earlier this week.This year marked the first time coaches became eligible just one year after retirement, a rule change that affected Belichick’s candidacy. The contributor and senior categories are voted on separately from the modern-era finalists, adding another layer of complexity to the process.Kraft had been eligible for over a decade but reached finalist status for the first time this year. His exclusion ends speculation that voter support for him may have indirectly affected Belichick’s case.While controversies such as Spygate and Deflategate have occasionally resurfaced in discussions, there is no official indication that they influenced voting.",New england patriots owner robert kraft has been left out of the pro football hall of fame class of 2026.

Giants rookie Jaxson Dart fires back at play-style critics after studying Patrick Mahomes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/giants-rookie-jaxson-dart-fires-back-at-play-style-critics-after-studying-patrick-mahomes/articleshow/127889908.cms,"Jaxson Dart (Image Via Getty)

Jaxson Dart explains why his aggressive approach mirrors Patrick Mahomes and Josh Allen

Jaxson Dart is not changing who he is on the field. The New York Giants rookie quarterback has made it clear that outside noise will not decide how he plays. Questions about his physical style keep coming, but Dart says the way he plays is the reason he reached this level in the first place. For him, playing safe just to please critics is not an option.In a recent interview with the Associated Press, Dart addressed the concern head-on. Speaking to reporter Rob Maaddi, he explained that his approach comes from confidence, not carelessness. “I play this game a way that I feel like I’m fearless,” Dart said. “I’m going to do whatever it takes to win. I’m gonna play the game that I played my whole entire life that’s gotten me to this point.”Dart’s style has always involved contact. He runs hard, fights for extra yards, and does not slide early. That has led to criticism, especially after he suffered a concussion against the Chicago Bears on November 9, which sidelined him for two weeks.Still, Dart believes the injury does not define his availability. “I’m not gonna change the way that I play just to satisfy somebody’s opinion,” he said. “In the last four or five years, I’ve only missed two games.When people talk about availability, I say look at my track record.”On the field, his numbers show both risk and reward. Dart averaged 5.7 yards per rush on 86 attempts and scored nine rushing touchdowns. At the same time, his willingness to stay in the pocket led to 35 sacks and a loss of 152 yards.Jaxson Dart admits he is learning. He said he has worked on knowing when to push and when to protect himself, adding that he feels “a lot better” as the season went on.He also points out that he is not alone. Dart studies quarterbacks who play with similar edge. “I watch how Josh Allen plays. I watch how Patrick Mahomes plays,” he said. “They take hits too, so I’m not an anomaly here.”Mahomes has consistently rushed for over five yards per attempt in recent seasons and has never shied away from contact near the goal line. Allen is known for lowering his shoulder in short-yardage moments.Jaxson Dart sees that as proof that toughness and smart decision-making can exist together.

Matt Rempe keeps himself in control, but he wants to get better soon

The New Rangers have been among the teams with the worst records this season. And three weeks back, during their home game against the visiting Buffalo, the franchise suffered yet another blowout loss. But one forward wasn’t satisfied with his efforts that night.Matt Rempe sat on the bench as he saw his side get beaten 5-2. With chances of a comeback looking uncertain and frustration, the forward seriously considered dropping his gloves and thought about taking a swing at the Sabres. But he didn’t, and on February 3, he finally revealed why.Rempe stopped himself on January 10, but the 23-year-old winger's admission reveals just how dark things became during his recovery from a broken thumb that threatened to derail his season with the Rangers. ""I was going to lose my mind,"" Rempe said of his mental state during the 10-2 loss to the Bruins. ""That wasn't a good place mentally.""The 6-foot-9 forward had returned to the lineup 12 games earlier after a nearly two-month absence, but his thumb still prevented him from gripping his stick properly. Smaller players out-battled him for pucks. He couldn't play the physical, menacing style that made him effective in a bottom-six role.After the team returned to New York, Rempe and coach Mike Sullivan had a frank conversation about his situation. They agreed he would continue practicing with the team but sit out games while his thumb healed further. It was a necessary step back.Rempe initially suffered the injury in an October fight with San Jose forward Ryan Reaves. His thumb got caught in Reaves' jersey during their bout and broke in ""many places,"" requiring surgery. He still has metal in his thumb from the operation and doesn't have full mobility despite constant efforts to bend and stretch it throughout each day.The mental toll of that first stint back from injury proved demoralizing. The Rangers managed only 50 percent of the five-on-five expected goal share with him on the ice, down significantly from his previous rates. Sullivan reduced his ice time from an average of 10:48 before the injury to just 8:52 per game.""I (couldn't) win battles and be a menace or anything at all,"" Rempe said. After receiving an injection to reduce pain and improve mobility following the Boston blowout, Rempe remained out two weeks for conditioning skates with healthy scratches.His thumb improved during the Rangers' recent California road trip, and he told Sullivan and team doctors he felt ready to be himself again. He returned to the lineup Jan. 26 against Boston, bringing nerves but also relief when he discovered he could protect pucks effectively again.""Now I can have confidence that I'm not going to just bobble a puck or drop my stick or feel like I'm skating on the ice with a hand grenade,"" said Rempe, who remains not cleared to fight. His four games back have shown mixed results, including being on ice for two Penguins goals Saturday in Pittsburgh.But Rempe is focused on finishing strong, hoping to bookend his season with quality play despite the difficult middle chapter. ""Then I can have a great start and great end,"" he said. ""Just a bump in the middle.""",The new york rangers have been among the teams with the worst records this season.

Reports: Giannis Antetokounmpo hesitant on Warriors move due to ‘Durant effect’ concerns,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/reports-giannis-antetokounmpo-hesitant-on-warriors-move-due-to-durant-effect-concerns/articleshow/127891252.cms,"Giannis Antetokounmpo and Kevin Durant

Giannis Antetokounmpo doesn’t want to become the second Kevin Durant

Warriors aging roster puts off Giannis Antetokounmpo

As the February 5 trade deadline approaches, everyone’s eyes are fixed on the deteriorating relationship between Giannis Antetokounmpo and Milwaukee Bucks. While rumours are flying around about Golden State Warriors’ interest in acquiring the two-time NBA MVP, but a recent intel from The People's Insider, Jake Fischer, suggests that the picture of Giannis walking on the Chase Center hardwood in Warriors’ jersey is far from certain. Fischer indicated that, as per some inside sources, the Greek Freak shows hesitation in joining a team with an aging roster and the heavy dependence on a single player.Reporter Jake Fischer shared that a significant hurdle in the potential Giannis Antetokounmpo deal involves the looming shadow of Warriors’ former superstar, Kevin Durant. During Durant’s three seasons with Golden State (2016–2019), he secured two championships and two Finals MVPs, with an average of 25.8 points, 7.1 rebounds, and 5.4 assists per game while shooting with an efficiency of 52.4% from the floor and 88.3% from the free throw line. But other than the ring-chasing criticism, the internal conflicts led to his leaving the team in 2019 while nursing an ACL injury.Understanding the stature and presence that Stephen Curry carries on the court Fischer stated, “League sources say that Golden State is aware of recent rumblings that Antetokounmpo can't be assumed to be as eager as he was once perceived to be to relocate to Stephen Curry's town and team.How credible are such rumblings? Presumably only Giannis knows for sure. Yet I have heard from sources briefed on the situation that some in the know suspect Antetokounmpo could be turned off by the idea of joining an older team and/or facing the sort of criticism that Kevin Durant continues to absorb to this day about teaming up with Curry. ”Antetokounmpo, who averaged 28.0 points, 10.0 rebounds and 5.6 assists in 30 games he played this season, reportedly values a career path that prioritizes leading instead of playing under a shadow. And with Warriors, Stephen Curry remains the undisputed cultural icon and the focal point of their playmaking.Playing under Curry’s legendary stature is just one of the problems. The Golden State Warriors’ aging roster has turned off Giannis. The team is currently 8th in the Western Conference with a 27-23 record. In their last 10 games, they have only managed to win 6 of those contests. With a playing core that is past hitting the late 30s: Stephen Curry (37), Jimmy Butler (36 and sidelined due to ACL), Draymond Green (35) and Al Horford (39), Warriors championship dreams are based on players approaching Father Time.Despite Milwaukee’s struggling at 18-29, Giannis, who is currently sidelined after a self-diagnosed calf-strain in late January, is seeking a championship window that won't slam at least shut within the next 24 months. For a player who just turned 31 this season, the idea of a veteran-heavy roster may not be the favor he’s looking for.",Giannis antetokounmpo has been linked with a move to the golden state warriors.

Pro Bowl selections raise eyebrows

How the Pro Bowl has changed over time

Justin Fields has reportedly declined an invitation to the Pro Bowl Games, choosing instead to focus on offseason training after a difficult year with the New York Jets. According to reports, hie was asked to join the AFC roster after several quarterbacks ahead of him opted out. However, the 26-year-old decided not to participate, saying he wanted to concentrate on improving his game ahead of the 2026 season.His numbers this past season were unexceptional. He played nine games, throwing for 1,259 yards and seven touchdowns, with one interception. He also added 383 rushing yards and four scores on the ground. The Jets went 2-7 in games he started, and he was eventually benched.Fields’ reported invitation has sparked debate among fans about the current value of the Pro Bowl. Several top quarterbacks were originally selected, including Josh Allen of the Buffalo Bills, Justin Herbert of the Los Angeles Chargers and Drake Maye of the New England Patriots. However, availability issues meant replacements were needed.Among the AFC quarterbacks set to represent the conference are rookie Shedeur Sanders, Joe Burrow and veteran Joe Flacco. Sanders threw more interceptions than touchdowns in limited action this season, while Flacco split time between teams.Burrow returned late in the year after injury.With several players declining to take part, the selection process has come under criticism. Many fans have questioned whether the Pro Bowl still reflects true on-field performance or if it has become more about availability.In recent years, the Pro Bowl has shifted from a traditional full-contact game to a mix of skill challenges and a flag football matchup. While the format aims to reduce injury risk and increase entertainment, it has also changed how the event is viewed.For some supporters, the idea that Fields after a tough season was even considered highlights how much the event has changed. Others believe his decision to focus on training was the right move, especially as his future with the Jets remains uncertain.He is still under contract, but reports suggest New York could explore other quarterback options this offseason. With limited standout prospects in the upcoming draft, the franchise faces key decisions.For now, Fields has chosen preparation over participation. Whether that decision helps him revive his career next season remains to be seen but it has once again put the Pro Bowl under the spotlight.","Justin fields has reportedly declined an invitation to the pro bowl games.

Artemi Panarin Trade Rumors Heat Up as Tampa Bay Emerges as Potential Destination Ahead of Roster Freeze,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/artemi-panarin-trade-rumors-heat-up-as-tampa-bay-emerges-as-potential-destination-ahead-of-roster-freeze/articleshow/127890451.cms,"Artemi Panarin with the Rangers (Via Getty Images)

Roster freeze for Olympic break temporarily halts Artemi Panarin sweepstakes.

Artemi Panarin continues to remain one of the hottest would-be free agents in the league right now. Multiple teams have already made it clear that they would like the Rangers forward among their lineup, and the Russian superstar’s agent is already in conversation with many clubs.But his demand for a $50 million contract has made it complicated for all six teams interested in the sweepstakes. Each brings something or the other to the table that the 34-year-old would prefer. But all teams would have to wait till 22nd February if they want anything done.With tomorrow's 3 p.m. roster freeze closing in ahead of the Olympic break, time is running short for teams to finalize a deal that could reshape the playoff race. The Athletic's Vincent Z. Mercogliano outlined the landscape surrounding Artemi Panarin's potential trade from the Rangers.""Maybe there's a team I'm missing, but I've got a list of 6 who seem to be in it, to varying degrees and for varying reasons,"" Mercogliano wrote. “Panarin's top choices if they can swing the extension: FLA, TBL. Best cap situation to offer the extension: CAR, LAK. Most appealing assets to offer in return: SJS, WAS.""Florida and Tampa Bay represent Panarin's preferred destinations if either can navigate the significant financial hurdles involved. Panarin's close friendship with Sergei Bobrovsky makes the Panthers particularly attractive, though how either Florida team could accommodate his reported $50 million extension demands remains unclear.Carolina and Los Angeles possess the cleanest cap situations to offer the long-term extension Panarin is seeking before approving any trade. San Jose and Washington bring the most compelling prospect packages and draft capital to entice Rangers GM Chris Drury.Mercogliano noted growing speculation around the Lightning specifically, despite their cap challenges. ""If either Florida team can hit his $ ask, a big if, it's hard to think he wouldn't pick one of them,"" he wrote. ""FWIW, I've heard from a couple of people whose Tampa antennas are inching up.""The Lightning's interest carries particular significance given their championship pedigree and ability to navigate complex cap situations in the past. Panarin holds a full no-trade clause and wants an extension in place before approving any deal, giving him significant control over his destination.The 34-year-old forward has 57 points in 52 games this season for the Rangers, who sit last in the Eastern Conference at 21-22-6. Rangers management has held Panarin out of the lineup as they work to facilitate a trade before the Olympic roster freeze takes effect.The March 6 trade deadline looms beyond the Olympic break, but teams hoping to include Panarin in their playoff push need to act before Monday afternoon.",Artemi panarin is one of the hottest would-be free agents in the league right now.

What to watch before Denver Nuggets vs Detroit Pistons tip-off

Theface theon Tuesday,, in a meeting between two teams near the top of their conferences. Both sides have built strong records, and this game could influence positioning as the season moves toward its later stretch.Most starters are available, but a few injuries could affect rotations. Final availability updates are expected shortly before tip-off, especially for players listed as game-time decisions.Denver Nuggets is healthier than it was earlier in the season, though two rotation players remain uncertain.• Cameron Johnson (SF) - Out with a knee injury and not expected to return before February 4.• Christian Braun (SG) - Game-time decision because of an ankle issue.• Nikola Jokić, Jamal Murray, Michael Porter Jr., Aaron Gordon - Active with no injury designations.If Braun does not play, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and Hunter Tyson could see more minutes on the perimeter. Denver may also rely more on Jokić to organize the offense.• Caris LeVert (SG) - Out due to illness and expected to miss this game.• Tolu Smith (PF) - Game-time decision with a calf injury.• Jaden Ivey, Cade Cunningham, Tobias Harris, Isaiah Stewart - Active.Without LeVert, Detroit is likely to depend more on Malik Beasley and Bennedict Mathurin for scoring and spacing off the bench.The teams have played once this season. Detroit won 109-107 in a close game that featured several lead changes before the Pistons finished stronger late.Detroit also holds a slight edge in the all-time regular-season series, with 53 wins to Denver’s 49 across 102 games. Denver has reached the playoffs more consistently in recent years, but Detroit’s current record reflects its progress this season.Detroit’s rebounding numbers and slightly higher offensive rating reflect a physical style built around Stewart and Harris. Denver’s offense continues to run through Jokić’s passing and Murray’s two-man actions.Denver’s chances depend on Jokić controlling the interior, Murray creating scoring chances, and the team converting open outside shots. Detroit Pistons is expected to focus on rebounding, use its frontcourt strength inside, and limit driving lanes to force tougher attempts.The Pistons are favored by about 3.5 to 4 points. The projected total is around 228 points, suggesting a game with steady scoring from both teams.Also read: Is Nikola Jokic playing tonight vs the Detroit Pistons? Latest update on the Denver Nuggets star's injury report (February 3, 2026) Denver’s depth could be tested if Braun is unavailable alongside Johnson. Detroit will need to adjust its backcourt rotation without LeVert. Key areas to monitor include Jokić’s rebounds and assists, Murray’s usage, and Detroit’s advantage on the glass, which could decide extra possessions in a close game.","Denver nuggets and detroit pistons meet in a meeting between two teams near the top of their conferences.

What Josh Allen said about the surgery

Josh Allen is still recovering from foot surgery, but a recent photo with a fan has already created fresh concerns among Buffalo Bills supporters.Allen had surgery on his right foot after the 2025 season. He suffered a small fracture, known as a fifth-metatarsal avulsion, late in the year. The injury first showed up in Week 16 and got worse in the final games. Doctors expect him to need about eight to ten weeks to fully recover.The issue began when a Buffalo fan shared a picture with Allen online. In the photo, Allen did not appear to be wearing a protective boot. Some fans quickly questioned whether he was being careful enough during his recovery.The fan later explained what really happened. He said Allen had just stepped out of his car and was not walking around without protection for a long time. The quarterback signed his hat, took a photo and had a short conversation before leaving. The fan made it clear that Allen was not ignoring medical advice.Allen later spoke about the procedure. He said doctors removed a small broken bone and cleaned up the area. He described it as painful but not a major surgery. He also said that if he had to play a game that week, he would have found a way to do it.Even so, the Bills are expected to be careful with his recovery.He is the most important player on the team, and his health will be key for next season.Last year, he threw for 3,668 yards and 25 touchdowns despite dealing with injuries. The Bills had strong moments but once again failed to reach the Super Bowl. Fans are hoping next season will finally be different.The viral photo may have created noise, but insiders believe Allen remains on track for a full return during offseason workouts. The projected recovery window suggests he should be ready for organized team activities.For Buffalo fans, the bigger picture remains clear. Allen is the centerpiece of the franchise, and his health is critical if the team hopes to finally break through in the postseason.For now, a single photo has fueled online debate. But if recovery goes as planned, the focus will soon shift from injury concerns to another run at championship contention.","Josh allen had surgery on his right foot after the 2025 season.

Pro Bowl 2026 payouts revealed: How much NFL stars really earn for playing,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/pro-bowl-2026-payouts-revealed-how-much-nfl-stars-really-earn-for-playing/articleshow/127894245.cms,"NFL (Image Via Getty)

NFL Pro Bowl payouts put in perspective using Sam Darnold salary example

Making the Pro Bowl still means something in the NFL, even if the shine is not what it once was. In 2026, fans have noticed more players skipping the event or treating it like a bonus rather than a badge of pride. Still, one part of the Pro Bowl has not lost its value. The money is real, and for many players, it matters.So how much do players actually get paid for showing up? The answer depends on whether their team wins or loses. While stars with massive contracts may barely feel the difference, younger players and backups often see the Pro Bowl check as a meaningful boost. For them, it is a solid payout for a short appearance after a long season.For the 2026 Pro Bowl, every player who takes part earns money. Players on the winning side receive $92,000 each. Those on the losing side still walk away with $46,000.That is payment for a few days of practices and one game that avoids full contact. To understand what that really means, it helps to look at regular NFL pay.The minimum NFL salary for the 2025 season was set at about $840,000 for rookies. Spread across an 18-week season, that works out to a little over $46,600 per week.That means even players on the losing Pro Bowl team earn more than a typical week’s pay for minimum-salary players.Now compare that to higher earners. Sam Darnold, the quarterback for the Seattle Seahawks, earns roughly $92,000 per day based on his contract.For players at that level, a Pro Bowl win pays about the same as one regular workday. It is nice, but not life-changing.Darnold will not be part of the Pro Bowl this year anyway, since the Seahawks are playing in the Super Bowl. Still, his case shows why some veterans feel indifferent about the event.The risk of injury can outweigh the reward. That said, the Pro Bowl still makes financial sense for many players.Role players, young starters, and first-time selections can see the check as a strong bonus at the end of the season. Even without the old prestige, the Pro Bowl continues to pay well for the time required.","Nfl pro bowl payouts put in perspective using sam darnold salary example.

On January 31, Grammy-winning singer Siedah Garrett shared a picture of Michael Jackson from the 1993 Super Bowl XXVII halftime show on social media [Instagram and X]. The late King of Pop was wearing a white button-down shirt, a round-collared t-shirt, and matte black pants with white socks. He stood on stage in his classic arms-outstretched pose.Garrett captioned the throwback iconic photo: “It was 33 years ago today, I had the honor of performing with Michael Jackson at Super Bowl XXVII. One of the many highlights of my career! MJ revolutionized the halftime show and made HIStory!!”Jackson mesmerized audiences worldwide by standing perfectly still on live TV for straight two minutes, transforming dead silence into a spectacular spectacle that left millions of viewers breathless and awe-inspired! The crowds cheered on.In December 2021, when’s Andy Greene asked Garrett about this, she said, “That was ridiculous. When he was on, he was really, really on. He put on a good show every night. But there were some nights where we had to stand and applaud. We were like, “Damn!”He is the only person that I have ever known of or heard of that can spin eight full revolutions on his heel. What?! We watched him do it. Somebody filmed it, and they slowed it down.It was eight full revolutions. Crazy. There were some nights where even we had to give it up, and we saw him every night.”Background singer Siedah Garrett was not excited about performing at the halftime show. “I wasn’t thrilled about it at all,” Garrett told Chuck Arnold of the New York Post in Feb. 2023. “I was like, ‘Okay, we gotta do this. It’s a job.’ And it turned out to be so much more than that.” Speaking about Jackson, she said he “wasn’t nervous, he was excited.”“He was worried about the good ol’ boys and how he was gonna come off to them,” Garrett shared. “He was more concerned about entertaining those football guys who were just there to see the game, didn’t care who was on at the halftime show. They would usually leave and go to the bathroom or do whatever. But nobody left their seats with this halftime show.”The King of Pop performed “Billie Jean,” “Jam,” “We Are the World,” “Black or White,” and “Heal the World.”The 1993 Super Bowl halftime show was considered a turning point because it drew more viewers than the game itself. It was the most-watched event for 32 long years!It remained the most-watched Super Bowl halftime show with 133.4 million viewers until Kendrick Lamar broke the record at Super Bowl 59 on February 10, 2025, with 133.5 million viewers.Last year, the Philadelphia Eagles won Super Bowl LIX. This year, Bad Bunny is scheduled to perform at the Super Bowl LX halftime show on February 8, 2026.","Grammy-winning singer siedah garrett shared a picture of michael jackson from the 1993 super bowl xxvii halftime show on social media.
