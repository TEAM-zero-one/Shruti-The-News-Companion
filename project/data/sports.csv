when thehost the Washington Wizards. His name does not appear on the injury report for the December 23, 2025 game.Ball played Monday despite soreness in his right wrist and showed no restrictions. He handled his normal role, took his usual shots, and finished the night without any setback. With no new injury listed, Charlotte is preparing as if its lead guard will be available.LaMelo Ball's wrist issue surfaced ahead of Monday’s game against Cleveland, where Ball was initially listed as probable. He ended up playing and logged full minutes. On Tuesday, the concern appears to have eased enough that it no longer appears on the report.Ball scored 23 points in that game and hit six three-pointers. The shot volume and accuracy suggested the wrist was manageable, even if it was not fully pain-free.Against Cleveland, LaMelo Ball led Charlotte Hornets in scoring and assists. The Hornets made 21 threes as a team but allowed 24, which proved to be the difference in a 139-132 loss.Through the season, Ball is averaging 19.4 points, 5.5 rebounds, and 8.6 assists.With Charlotte sitting at 9–20, most of the offense continues to run through him, especially late in games.Before Monday, LaMelo Ball had dealt with ankle trouble earlier in the season, which kept him out briefly. The wrist soreness was the latest issue, but his availability against Cleveland and clean status Tuesday suggest the team is confident it is under control.The Charlotte Hornets’ injury report for Tuesday is still listed as “not yet submitted,” but Ball is not mentioned. That contrasts with Washington’s report, which includes multiple rotation players.Washington enters the game with uncertainty across its lineup. Marvin Bagley III is questionable due to left calf soreness. Bilal Coulibaly is also questionable with a left ankle sprain. Cam Whitmore has been ruled out with right shoulder soreness.The Wizards have struggled on the road, holding a 3-12 record away from home, and could be short-handed again if those players sit.The game tips off at 7 p.m. ET at Spectrum Center. Charlotte Hornets are looking to rebound after a close loss and needs stability on offense. Ball’s availability helps on that front.

Steve Kerr gets Draymond Green frustrated during the game against the Orlando Magic

One of the biggest regrets for Steve Kerr is a moment from his games during the Michael Jordan era. It was the Christmas Day game from 1994. The Chicago Bulls were facing the New York Knicks and the former team was leading the game with 3.3 seconds remaining. However, during the last few seconds, Kerr commits a blunder that sends the game into overtime. Even then, the Bulls managed to win the game. But Kerr still remembers his mistake. While talking to ESPN, he candidly admitted that he would have been the “GOAT” for this mistake.Scottie Pippen was the highest scorer of the game. He racked up 36 points with 16 rebounds and 3 assists. Following right up were Tony Kukoc and BJ Armstrong. They added 25 and 16 points to the team’s final score. Kerr played for 28 minutes and added 9 points with 1 rebound and 2 assists.Steve Kerr lives with one of his biggest regrets. He believed that a game that could have ended faster went into overtime because of him. It was the last few seconds of the second half. The Chicago Bulls were dominating the game with a 3-point lead. Anthony Mason gave his all towards the end to secure a dunk for the New York Knicks.At this point, Kerr jumped right in to block the dunk and tried to tap the ball to one of his teammates. But none of his teammates received the ball. Instead, it was the Knicks’ guard who received the ball and scored a 3-pointer. It brought both teams to an even and the game went into overtime.Steve Kerr still regrets it. He stated in an interview with ESPN, “It was the biggest mistake I've ever made. It was a huge gaffe. It was just dumb. One of the biggest nightmares of my career.” Kerr further added, “I would've been the goat. Not the good GOAT. The bad goat. It worked out, but it was humiliating. It was just the dumbest play. I still don't quite know why I did it.”What makes him feel worse is that even now, every year, the league would have a throwback to some of the major Christmas Day games in the past. “The problem is now every Christmas Day when they start playing [vintage] games on NBA TV, they still show that. I'm like, f**k, would you guys leave me alone?""Scottie Pippen saved the day for Kerr. During overtime, Scottie gave his best and racked up 7 points to lead the team to victory. Immediately after the game, Scottie hugged Kerr to ease the atmosphere.According to Marc Spears from NBA Today, Draymond Green got into a heated argument with the team’s head coach, Steve Kerr. Green has been quite unhappy about Kerr’s defensive approach and in the game against the Orlando Magic, the athlete got into a heated argument with the head coach. Later, Green abruptly left the game and did not return.","Steve kerr regrets his biggest career mistake from the 1994 christmas day game against the new york knicks.

Draymond Green Christmas suspension was a blessing in disguise



Draymond Green Warriors suspension came during personal and professional strain



Draymond Green has lived most of his adult life with Christmas circled on an NBA calendar. In December 2023, his usual Christmas routine unexpectedly stopped. A league suspension forced Green away from the court and into his living room. It was a blessing in disguise for the Warriors veteran as he got to be right where his children were opening gifts.The moment came during one of the most difficult stretches of his career. While Green was frustrated at the moment of the huge suspension, years later, he realized that it was the best Christmas moment of his life. Certainly, it was not the right way but almost every NBA star has the thirst to spend time with their family during this time.Draymond Green admitted that Christmas rarely feels familiar for NBA players. Road games often erase the traditions many grow up loving. His entire Christmas routine for a year changed during his 12-game suspension after the incident involving Jusuf Nurkic.""That was great. It was actually f---ing amazing,"" Green told ESPN. ""Usually it's weird because Christmas Day is not like what you remember as a kid, where you spend with your family.We've been on the road [five times, once when Green was suspended]. I know my 5-year-old's first Christmas, I was gone.""Instead of boarding a flight to Denver, Green stayed home. He opened presents with his children. He experienced a full Christmas morning. In previous seasons, he found small ways to cope, sometimes letting his kids open a gift before tipoff and saving the rest for later.Despite being one of only 10 players to record a Christmas Day triple-double, Green admitted the holiday can feel heavy.""As an NBA player, you want to be on that stage, marquee games and everybody's watching,"" Green said. ""But as a human, it f---ing sucks, if I'm honest.""... I absolutely loved as a kid watching NBA games on Christmas Day. Kobe Bryant and the white [Lakers] jerseys. I loved [Shaquille O'Neal]. ... But the NFL has started having games on Christmas Day, so maybe they take Christmas over and we go home.""The suspension stemmed from a flagrant foul against Nurkic and added to a season filled with tension. The NBA cited Green’s history of unsportsmanlike acts and required meetings with league officials before his return. Financial penalties followed. So did public scrutiny.""I am not one to apologize for things I mean to do, but I do apologize to Jusuf because I didn't intend to hit him,"" Green said after the game. ""I sell calls with my arms ... so I was selling the call ... and I swung and unfortunately I hit him.""Inside the Warriors organization, they needed him available.""We need him. We need Draymond. He knows that,"" coach Steve Kerr said. ""He's got to find a way to keep his poise and be out there for his teammates.""Regardless, for Green, that unexpected suspension came as a gift and one of his most meaningful holiday memories.Also Read: “It always could be worse” – Carmelo Anthony’s son Kiyan reveals what really connects him with LeBron’s son Bronny James",Draymond green's 12-game suspension came during one of the most difficult stretches of his career.

Rashee Rice’s current injury status

What does it mean for Chiefs in Week 17?

Also Read:

As the Kansas City Chiefs prepare for a quick Week 17 turnaround, their injury problems are getting worse. Wide receiver Rashee Rice is now a big question mark ahead of the Christmas Day game against the Denver Broncos.Rice remains in the NFL’s concussion protocol after suffering a head injury in Week 15, forcing him to miss last weekend’s game and placing his availability for Thursday in serious doubt. According to the Chiefs’ initial injury report to start the week , Rice did not participate in practice on Monday. That development is not encouraging, especially given the compressed schedule. With Kansas City playing on Thursday, Rice has significantly less time than usual to progress through the league’s multi-step concussion protocol.To be cleared, Rice must return to full practice and receive approval from an independent neurologist. As of now, there is no confirmation that he has advanced to the later stages of the protocol, making his status for Week 17 uncertain at best.The timing could not be worse for Kansas City. Concussion recoveries are unpredictable, and even minor symptoms can delay clearance. With only two real practice days available before kickoff, Rice would need rapid improvement to have any chance of suiting up.If he is unable to practice fully by midweek, the likelihood of him playing against Denver drops significantly. The Chiefs have historically taken a cautious approach with head injuries, particularly when postseason stakes are no longer in play.Even if Rice does manage to return, the situation around him is far from ideal. Franchise quarterback Patrick Mahomes is already sidelined for the season after suffering a torn ACL, and backup Gardner Minshew is also unavailable following his own knee injury.That leaves Kansas City potentially turning to Chris Oladokun or recently signed Shane Buechele under center. Either option represents a major downgrade at quarterback, limiting the ceiling of all pass-catchers in the offense.If Rice can't play, the Chiefs will have to rely on a weak receiving corps against a disciplined Denver defense again. For Rice, the most important thing is still his long-term health, not rushing back into a season that is already out of postseason contention.Kansas City may decide to play it safe and give Rice more time to heal, looking ahead to 2026 instead of risking setbacks in a divisional game that takes place over a short week.As of now, Rashee Rice is likely to be questionable or doubtful for Week 17. It doesn't look like he'll be able to play against the Broncos unless he makes quick progress through the concussion protocol in the next 24 to 48 hours. A final decision is expected to be made closer to the start of the game, although both the player and the team may have to wait.","Kansas city chiefs wide receiver rashee rice did not participate in practice on monday.

Why No. 17 stood out after the signing?

A contrasting moment for two franchises

Also Read:

The Kansas City Chiefs' season may be coming to an end in a tough way, but NFL fans have noticed a little, sweet moment. After quarterback Shane Buechele signed with the Kansas City Chiefs, his wife, Paige Buechele, posted a quiet tribute to Buffalo Bills player Josh Allen . This instantly led to a lot of talk on social media.Buechele was added to the Chiefs’ roster amid a quarterback crisis, with Kansas City already eliminated from playoff contention and battling a wave of injuries. While the signing itself flew under the radar, Paige Buechele’s Instagram post turned heads for an unexpected reason, the jersey number her husband will wear. Paige posted a photo of Shane Buechele wearing his Chiefs jersey with the caption , “And just like that we’re back to where it all began 🏈 let’s go 17!!!!” The choice of No. 17 immediately stood out. That number is famously worn by Josh Allen, the face of the Buffalo Bills and one of the league’s most recognizable quarterbacks.While Buechele has worn different numbers throughout his NFL journey, the decision to switch to Allen’s number appears to be a quiet nod to a close personal connection. Shane spent the past two seasons on Buffalo’s practice squad, where he worked closely with Allen in the quarterback room, often helping with film study and mechanics.The relationship between the two quarterbacks extends well beyond football. The Buecheles and Allens have been seen together at multiple off-field events, including holidays and weddings. Paige previously shared photos from Allen’s wedding, calling it “the most charming weekend celebrating the Allens,” highlighting the genuine bond between the families.That history adds emotional weight to the jersey choice. Rather than a flashy statement, Paige’s post reflected a sense of gratitude and respect for a chapter of their lives spent in Buffalo - and for a quarterback who helped shape her husband’s NFL path.The tribute takes place at a time of change for both teams.

Toronto Maple Leafs struggles spark criticism as Trevor Connors questions Auston Matthews' leadership,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/toronto-maple-leafs-struggles-spark-criticism-as-trevor-connors-questions-auston-matthews-leadership/articleshow/126140409.cms,"The hard season of the Toronto Maple Leafs in the NHL 2025-26 has led to both internal and external criticism, and the recent words by Auston Matthews caused a spike in such criticism. NHL reporter Trevor Connors challenged the evaluation of the team mentality by Matthews because of the apparent disconnected activities in the Leafs' dressing room.

Leafs’ Trevor Connors comments on Auston Matthews and dressing room problems



The Toronto Maple Leafs are going through one of the most frustrating seasons in their history, and the tensions are seemingly building up on and off the ice. Through the lack of consistency, the focus has shifted to leadership, specifically, the captain, Auston Matthews, whose on-ice performance and off-ice communication have been subject to criticism.After another loss in dismay, Matthews informed reporters that the team was fine mentally, a statement that immediately sparked eyebrows since Toronto was not performing so well in the Atlantic Division. The comments have elicited the wrath of NHL analyst Trevor Connors, who argued that the message delivered by the captain is not congruent with what the fans, teammates, and coaches are witnessing out of the Maple Leafs this season.Trevor Connors was not shy in his assessment of the remarks of Auston Matthews after the defeat, saying that the problems of the Toronto Maple Leafs go well beyond poor fortune or short-term depressions. As stated by Connors, the idea by Matthews that the team does not need a mental reboot shows that there is a bigger issue within the dressing room.The results of the Maple Leafs in the first half of the season portray the team that is in search of unity and clarity.Pacing far below his career scoring averages, Matthews has already been previously sidelined, which makes people speculate on the possibility of his injury concerns not having healed.What is even worse, the issue is complicated by the difference between what Matthews said and the statements of the head coach, Craig Berube, and other players.One more cause that Connors highlighted to change the chemistry in the team was the exit of Mitch Marner during the offseason. Although he did not blame Matthews, he implied that the captain needs to have a more appropriate and cohesive voice in times of adversity.As the Toronto Maple Leafs try to put the current season back on its feet, the topic of how Matthews will react will continue to center around his performances and leadership.Also Read: Net worth of Auston Matthews in 2025: Details on Toronto Maple Leafs captain's earnings, salary, and contracts","Trevor connors challenged the evaluation of the team mentality by auston matthews.

Maple Leafs power-play struggles create NHL crisis point, increasing pressure on Craig Berube



Maple Leafs Fire Assistant Coach Marc Savard... Now What? | Instant Analysis

The Toronto Maple Leafs are heading into the NHL holiday break in a state of real concern. Instead of tightening their game and building momentum, they’ve fallen into a worrying pattern, losing three straight and five of their last six, and it has clearly rattled the organization. Expectations were higher, and this kind of slide leaves very little room for patience.That frustration finally turned into action on Monday afternoon when the Leafs made their first major move, parting ways with assistant coach Marc Savard. It wasn’t a decision made for drama; it was tied directly to the biggest weakness dragging Toronto down: a power play that has completely stalled.Savard was responsible for leading Toronto’s man-advantage unit, and the numbers tell the story better than any emotion could. The Maple Leafs rank last in the NHL in power-play efficiency, converting just 13.3 percent of their chances. For a roster built around elite scorers, that simply isn’t acceptable. The puck movement hasn’t looked sharp, the execution hasn’t been convincing, and opponents have found it far too easy to shut Toronto down.This hasn’t just been a tactical issue; the frustration has seeped into the team, the fan base, and the organization as a whole.Craig Berube remains under pressure, but this move signals that the Leafs want to fix the most obvious problem before anything bigger happens. Still, nobody should assume Berube is suddenly comfortable. If the results don’t change, the conversation will return to him quickly.To give Savard credit, last season’s power play did perform well, finishing around 25 percent and ranking among the better groups in the league. But the NHL is unforgiving. When an area this important collapses, previous success doesn’t buy unlimited time. Even his past coaching connection with Berube couldn’t protect him this time.There’s no confirmation yet on who will replace Savard, but the mission is simple: revive the power play and stop this season from sliding further. After 35 mostly disappointing games, something had to shift. Whether this move steadies the Maple Leafs or becomes the first of several changes will depend entirely on how quickly the wins return.","The toronto maple leafs fired assistant coach marc savard on monday.

Ferrari’s fear and the FIA’s big dilemma ahead of F1 season 2026



F1 2026’s engine loophole controversy

Formula 1 is still weeks away from its winter break. But the fight for the 2026 season has already begun. Eleven teams are working flat out behind closed doors. However, the fresh rumors about an allegedly ‘illegal’ Mercedes power unit have shaken the paddock. These stories have not appeared by accident. They have surfaced at a very specific time. Teams are already worried about falling behind under the new engine rules.However, Mercedes, and possibly Red Bull Ford, are said to have found a clever loophole. This trick allows them to get more performance from their engines. Not every manufacturer has found the same solution. Honda, Audi, and Ferrari are believed to be behind in this area. As a result, tension is growing fast in the fraternity. And once again, the real battle is happening off the track.Most of the rumors are coming from Italy. The Italian media outlets, especially Corriere dello Sport, are leading the discussion about the Mercedes engine. Ferrari has strong links with the Italian media. It also knows how to guide narratives when it feels threatened. This has raised questions about who benefits from these leaks.Ferrari will be clearly worried. The team fears starting 2026 with an engine weaker than Mercedes, McLaren, and Red Bull. By pushing these stories early, the goal seems clear. It is to shape public opinion, and to pressure the FIA into stepping in before the season even begins.At the center of the debate is the compression ratio. Mercedes is rumored to be running an extreme figure of 18:1. This has caused panic across the grid. The ability to hot alter the compression ratio is seen as the real concern. Rival teams have already asked the FIA for clarity. But the governing body is stuck in a difficult position.Banning the Mercedes engine outright looks unlikely since its development is almost complete. Time is running out, but at the same time, ignoring the complaints could anger several manufacturers.From Italy, Corriere dello Sport suggests a compromise. Mercedes could be allowed to race in 2026, but it may have to adjust its engine for 2027.Notably, Mercedes currently supplies 8 cars. These include its own team, Williams, Alpine, and McLaren. Protests could come as early as the first race in Melbourne. But mass disqualifications seem unrealistic.Formula 1 has seen this story before. However, in 2026, the fear has arrived early, before a single car has even turned a wheel.Also Read: Helmut Marko accuses Christian Horner of playing “dirty games” before Red Bull racing exit, says Max Verstappen saved him","Ferrari fears starting 2026 with an engine weaker than mercedes, mclaren, and red bull.

Leonard Gates’ Chewbacca mask prank fails to distract Nathan Aspinall



🎯 LIVE: Nathan Aspinall v Leonard Gates | 2026 World Darts Championship WATCHALONG

The win secured him a place in the third round, where he will face Dutch player Kevin Doets after the Christmas break.After the match, Nathan Aspinall explained what happened in the practice room. “Have you heard what Leonard did in the practice room? He turned up, tapped me on the back and he had a Chewbucca mask. Honest to God, I can’t say it, I nearly pooed my pants, I was a bit scared.”Aspinall made it clear there were no hard feelings. “He’s a great guy. I played Leonard here last year. I had a job to do, I won 3-0, it was very comfortable and I’m back after Christmas.I’ve dropped one set in two matches. Played pretty average. I have tried to enjoy my game”, he added.He also praised the Ally Pally crowd and said, “Every time I’ve played here, the crowd gave me great support. I want to put a show on. It’s not that easy.”Looking ahead, Aspinall acknowledged the challenge posed by his next opponent. He noted that Kevin is a great player and he doesn't have a good record against him.Leonard Gates later confirmed the prank. Reflecting on the moment, he said, “We were in the players’ room and I was wearing my Chewbacca mask. I walked up to him and he was like, ‘Oh my God, what is this?’ So that’s a start. I’m going to peek around the corner with him and show, ‘Hey, I’m still here.’ No disrespect to Nathan, of course.”In the tournament, Gian van Veen has impressed with a 108.28 average, underlining his status as a strong contender in the tournament.Also Read: Michael van Gerwen fires shots at World Grand Prix 2025 winner Luke Littler ahead of World Darts Championship 2026 clash","Nathan aspinall defeated leonard gates 3-0 at the world darts championship.

Charlie McAvoy ’s honest take after jaw surgery and his impact on the Bruins after returning



Charlie McAvoy Says Bruins Are Angry And Annoyed | 32 Thoughts

Charlie McAvoy didn’t return to the Boston Bruins lineup with ease or comfort. He came back after weeks of pain, surgery, and frustration, stepping onto the ice on December 11 in Winnipeg knowing exactly what he had just pushed through to get there.This was the first time he had played in nearly a month. He skated with a protective bubble over his face, metal plates holding his jaw together, and the pressure of a full 60-minute game ahead. The injury happened in Montreal when a deflected slapshot struck his jaw, forcing him into surgery and a difficult recovery that was as draining mentally as it was physically.The reality after that night was difficult. Surgery followed, along with significant weight loss and constant discomfort because of an all-liquid diet. Even basic things like eating became a challenge. “It might be the most frustrating injury I’ve had,” McAvoy said. “You don’t think about how much your body needs real fuel until you don’t have it.”What carried him through wasn’t just determination. It was the people around him. McAvoy repeatedly credited his wife and family for keeping him grounded, sharing, “For me, it is always Kiley. She just gets me through everything.I really am so lucky to have her. And my family, too.That is my support system.”When he finally returned against the Winnipeg Jets, he didn’t ease in. He logged more than 24 minutes, picked up an assist, and helped Boston to a 6–3 win. Head coach Marco Sturm praised the performance, saying it reminded everyone “how much we actually missed him.”Since then, McAvoy has looked strong, blocking shots without hesitation, contributing offensively, and settling Boston’s defense with his usual calm presence. Even after everything, his mindset hasn’t shifted from gratitude. “Just grateful now to be on the other side, to be on track and getting healthy, and grateful for all the doctors,” he said.As the Bruins continue their push through the season, McAvoy’s comeback isn’t just a medical recovery story. It’s about resilience, support, and a player who refused to let adversity define him, and Boston is stronger because he’s back.Also Read: NHL updates: Heartbreaking week for Boston Bruins' Charlie McAvoy as his wife Kiley shares emotional family update","Charlie mcavoy returned to the boston bruins lineup on december 11.

Jaccob Slavin's upper-body injury update for the Carolina Hurricanes



The Carolina Hurricanes have confirmed that Jaccob Slavin is a defenseman who is out of action, on a week-to-week basis, with an upper-body injury. The disappointment is just a few months after he returns following a long lower-body injury that had cost him 29 games this season. The availability of Slavin is questionable because the team considers its defensive options before making further NHL games.Slavin was only recently back in the line with more than 18 minutes in his third game back. The team will play it safe so as to avoid more complications later, and it is not clear whether he will be put on injured reserve in the near future. His loss has created a vacuum in the Carolina defensive team, where his leadership and consistency in the field are crucial.The injury to Slavin is a major worry for the Carolina Hurricanes with the tight NHL schedule. A defensive-conscious and penalty-killing goalie, Slavin is extremely instrumental in stabilizing the back end of Carolina. His loss may compel the team to use more young defensemen or change the pairings in order to remain consistent.The Hurricanes are keeping a vigilant check on his progress, and no specific date has been given as to the time he can resume. Both fans and those who follow and analyze the NHL will be keen on the updates due to his availability, as this may determine the performance of the team in future games. The approach of Carolina emphasizes the necessity of harmonizing the short-term requirements of lineups and the health of players.Also Read: Net worth of Auston Matthews in 2025: Details on Toronto Maple Leafs captain's earnings, salary, and contracts",Jaccob slavin has been ruled out for a week-to-week with an upper-body injury.
