Right Knee - Injury Management; Right Shin - Soreness





Thewhen they play the New Orleans Pelicans on Saturday,. The team has ruled him out due to right knee management and soreness in his right shin.This is his fourth straight missed game. He sat out the final few games before the All-Star break and has not returned yet. The team is being cautious, but there is still no clear timeline for when he will be back.Joel Embiid is officially listed as out with right knee injury management and right shin soreness.He has played 31 games this season and is averaging 26 points, 7 rebounds, 3.9 assists, and 1.1 blocks. His absence has affected the team’s results. The Sixers are 1-6 in games he has missed since the start of 2026.Philadelphia comes into this game with a 30-25 record and is currently sixth in the Eastern Conference. They have lost three games in a row. Without Embiid, the team has struggled on both ends, especially inside.Nick Nurse has adjusted the rotation to deal with Embiid’s absence. Paul George has taken on a bigger role in the frontcourt along with Trendon Watford, Dalen Terry, and Andre Drummond.Johni Broome and Adem Bona are also getting minutes at center.Tyrese Maxey is leading the backcourt, with support from VJ Edgecombe, Cameron Payne, and Quentin Grimes. The guards are handling more of the scoring and playmaking.Without a strong presence in the paint, the team has had trouble protecting the rim and controlling rebounds.New Orleans has a 15-42 record but still has players who can take advantage of this matchup.Zion Williamson and Dejounte Murray lead the offense. Jordan Poole, Trey Murphy III, and Yves Missi are also part of the rotation.With Embiid out, the Pelicans are likely to attack inside. Williamson’s drives and Murray’s pick-and-roll play will test the Sixers’ defense.Maxey’s role becomes more important without Embiid. He needs to score and create chances for others.The Sixers may continue with smaller lineups, using George at power forward and rotating centers like Drummond or Broome. This helps spacing but can hurt them defensively.Rebounding and transition defense will matter. The team needs to limit second chances and fast breaks.Also read: Philadelphia 76ers vs New Orleans Pelicans injury report: Who's playing, injured and questionable players, head-to-head records, team stats, and more (February 21, 2026) There are no other major injuries for Philadelphia.

The contest could hinge on how effectively New Zealand’s middle order handles the craft and variation of Pakistan’s spin attack when the two teams meet in the opening Super Eight Group 2 clash of the T20 World Cup on Saturday.So far in the tournament, the Kiwi batting unit has not quite found top gear. Openers Tim Seifert and Finn Allen have led the charge with three half-centuries between them, but the middle order has struggled to provide consistent support. Glenn Phillips, Rachin Ravindra, Mark Chapman and Daryl Mitchell have all shown flashes without stringing together impactful contributions.Phillips and Ravindra have registered a fifty each, yet their overall returns remain modest. Ravindra, for instance, has scored 72 runs in four outings, with 59 of those coming in a single innings against Canada. Adding to their challenge is the fact that this will be New Zealand’s first match in Colombo in this edition of the tournament.Pakistan, in contrast, have been based in the Sri Lankan port city since the start of the World Cup and have already featured in two matches at the Premadasa. Their bowlers — especially the spinners — understand the tempo and lengths required on a slow surface where patience often trumps aggression.For New Zealand, it will be crucial that the middle order complements the Powerplay thrust provided by Allen and Seifert. A measured approach will be needed to either post or chase a total in the region of 180 on a pitch that demands calculated strokeplay.Pakistan’s spin arsenal — Usman Tariq, Abrar Ahmed, Saim Ayub, Mohammad Nawaz and Shadab Khan — gives them a clear advantage. However, they have their own concerns with the bat. Shadab, with 88 runs, is their second-highest scorer behind Sahibzada Farhan (220), the tournament’s leading run-getter.Against a seasoned New Zealand outfit, Pakistan will require a stronger collective effort from their batting unit. The biggest concern for the team management remains Babar Azam, who has managed just 66 runs in four matches at a strike rate of 115.78. The former captain has struggled to adapt to the tempo demanded by modern T20 cricket.Another failure could prompt Pakistan to consider Fakhar Zaman, who has yet to feature in the tournament. They are also weighing up the option of recalling left-arm pacer Shaheen Shah Afridi, omitted for the must-win fixture against Namibia.Afridi has claimed three wickets in three matches but at a costly economy rate of 11.22, underlining his difficulty in adjusting to slower conditions. His struggles serve as a warning for New Zealand’s pace-heavy attack.Lockie Ferguson, Matt Henry, Jacob Duffy and James Neesham have all been somewhat expensive and may need to rethink their approach. Greater reliance on variations — knuckle balls, slower bouncers and leg cutters — could be key to unsettling Pakistan’s batters and easing the burden on the spin trio of Mitchell Santner, Ish Sodhi, along with part-time options Ravindra and Phillips.Total matches: 49Pakistan won: 24New Zealand won: 23No Result: 2Pakistan: W, W, W, L, WNew Zealand : L:, W, W, L, WTotal matches: 51No result: 1Most wins by teamIndia – 12 winsSri Lanka – 10 winsAustralia – 7 winsPakistan – 6 winsSouth Africa – 5 winsBangladesh – 5 winsZimbabwe – 3 winsWest Indies – 3 winsNew Zealand – 3 winsEngland – 2 winsBeyond the on-field rivalry, the weather in Colombo threatens to have a major say in the outcome. Rain has been forecast both ahead of and during the contest, which is slated for a 7 PM local start. Showers are likely in the opening half of the evening, with temperatures ranging between 24 and 26 degrees Celsius and humidity levels climbing past 80 per cent.There is no reserve day allocated for this Super 8 encounter. Should persistent rain force an abandonment, the teams will split points — a result that could significantly hurt their chances of progressing to the semi-finals.Match officials will have an extra 90 minutes at their disposal in an effort to produce a result.

Pakistan will lock horns with New Zealand in their first Super 8 clash of the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2026 at the R Premadasa Stadium in Colombo on Saturday. With a storied rivalry and plenty at stake, the contest promises to be a high-intensity encounter between two evenly matched sides.This will be the 50th T20I meeting between Pakistan and New Zealand, underlining how closely contested this rivalry has been in the shortest format. Of the 49 matches played so far, Pakistan have won 24, New Zealand 23, while two games ended in ties — a near-perfect split that highlights the fine margins between the teams.Since January 2022 alone, the two sides have faced each other 24 times in T20Is. New Zealand hold a slight edge with 13 wins compared to Pakistan’s nine. However, Pakistan fans draw confidence from their memorable victory in the 2022 T20 World Cup semi-final, where they defeated the Black Caps to book a place in the final.New Zealand and Pakistan last played a T20 match in March last year, when New Zealand hosted the 2009 T20 World Cup champions for a three-match series, which the home side won 2-1.Performance of both teams in their last 5 matchesIn this edition, both teams have blown hot and cold. Pakistan suffered a setback against India in the group stage, while New Zealand went down to South Africa.As a result, both finished second in their respective groups and now find themselves in a challenging Super 8 group that also includes England and Sri Lanka.Form-wise, Pakistan come into the game with three wins in their last five matches (W, W, W, L, W), while New Zealand’s recent run reads L, W, W, L, W — again reflecting how evenly matched the sides are.While the cricketing rivalry adds spice, the weather in Colombo could play a decisive role. Rain is forecast before and during the match, which is scheduled to begin at 7 PM local time. Showers are expected during the first half, with temperatures hovering between 24 and 26 degrees Celsius and humidity above 80 per cent.There is no reserve day for this Super 8 fixture. If the match is abandoned due to rain, both teams will share one point each — a scenario that could severely dent their semi-final hopes.Officials will have an additional 90 minutes on the day to try and force a result, but if even a five-over contest isn’t possible, the game will be called off.","Pakistan take on new zealand in their first super 8 clash of the icc men’s t20 world cup 2026.

The journey of America’s top-ranked player

Taylor Fritz is trending, but not just because of a win. This time, the conversation around him is about how much tennis he is playing and whether his body can keep up. Former WTA Tour player Coco Vandeweghe recently questioned his heavy schedule despite his injury struggles, and that has added fuel to the discussion among fans. Fritz is currently competing at the Delray Beach Open, where he is the top seed and a two-time defending champion. Playing at home always brings extra attention, and he moved into the quarter-finals after a 7-6(4), 6-4 win over Rafael Jodar. But recent weeks have been physically demanding. At the Dallas Open, he had three championship points before losing the final to Ben Shelton. Earlier, at the Australian Open, he exited in the fourth round against Lorenzo Musetti, and there were visible concerns about his movement and fitness.To understand why this matters, one needs to look at who Taylor Fritz is. Born on October 28, 1997, in Rancho Santa Fe, California, he grew up around tennis. His father, Guy Fritz, played professionally and later became a coach. His mother, Kathy May, was ranked in the world’s top 10 in the late 1970s. Tennis was not something he picked up later in life - it was part of his world from the start.He turned professional in 2015 and quickly showed he belonged.In 2016, he reached the Memphis Open final in just his third ATP event. The moment that changed things for him came in 2022, when he defeated Rafael Nadal to win the Indian Wells Masters. The win pushed him into a new category. Today, Fritz is ranked inside the world’s top 10 and is the highest-ranked American singles player. He has become one of the steady names on the ATP Tour and a regular for the US Davis Cup team.Still, the physical side of the sport has tested him. He had meniscus surgery in 2021 and has dealt with knee and oblique issues since. Despite those signs, Fritz has made it clear that he intends to play through manageable pain. Speaking about his knee issue, he said, “It’s not something that gets better with a lot of stentinitis.” He added, “You need to just work through it. So I trust my physio, and we think the knee can get better while I’m still playing tournaments if it’s something I can play through. ”","Top-ranked american tennis star trending after injury and fitness concerns.

A coastal home built around family and routine

Tennis icon Rafael Nadal has spent most of his life on the road, moving from one tournament city to another. But unlike many global sports stars, Nadal never drifted too far from where it all began for him. Home for him has always meant Mallorca. In Porto Cristo, the quiet seaside town where he grew up, Nadal built a modern mansion overlooking the Mediterranean – a place that keeps him close to family, routine and the island that shaped him. The property sits along the eastern coast of Mallorca, in an area known for privacy and sea views. Rather than relocating to Madrid, Barcelona or another global hub, Nadal chose to stay rooted in his hometown. For someone who has won Grand Slams across the world, that decision says a lot. The house offers security and space, but more importantly, familiarity. From his terrace, he looks out at the same coastline he knew as a child.Nadal’s Porto Cristo mansion replaced an older family property and was rebuilt into a sleek, multi-level home designed with clean lines and large windows facing the sea. The structure is modern but understated.It blends into the rocky coastline rather than standing out from it. Reports describe expansive terraces, open-plan living areas and direct views of the Mediterranean. Inside, the design is simple and functional. Wide glass panels bring in natural light. Neutral tones dominate the interiors. The focus appears to be comfort rather than extravagance. The property reportedly includes multiple bedrooms for family and guests, along with private leisure spaces.Unlike some athletes who build training courts at home, Nadal’s professional base is just minutes away at the Rafa Nadal Academy. The academy serves as his main training centre, meaning his residence remains primarily a personal retreat rather than a performance compound. That separation allows him to draw a line between work and home life.The mansion is priced at around $4 million approximately, reflecting its prime coastal location and custom redevelopment. Nadal is believed to have invested heavily in rebuilding the property over the years to ensure privacy and modern standards.For fans, Nadal’s home reflects the same qualities seen in his career – loyalty, discipline and deep connection to his roots. While he conquered courts around the world, he never left Mallorca behind. His Porto Cristo mansion is not about spectacle. It is about staying grounded, even after global success.","Rafael nadal grew up in porto cristo, on the eastern coast of mallorca. He has built a modern mansion overlooking the mediterranean.

Tristan Vukcevic secures multi-year Wizards deal while battling hand injury uncertainty

Wizards adjust center rotation as Tristan Vukcevic’s status remains uncertain

According to Shams Charania of ESPN, Tristan Vukcevic is joining the Washington Wizards on a three-year, $9 million standard NBA contract. According to ESPN, the third year will be a team option. Separately, Josh Robbins of The Athletic adds that Vukcevic will not play in Friday's game against the Pacers because of a bruise in his right hand.Washington, which is already suffering with multiple injuries to important players, is in a difficult stretch. If Vukcevic is unable to play, Anthony Gill, who finished the previous game with 11 points, six assists, and three blocks in 23 minutes, becomes a deep-league streaming option.Stating the same, Shams Charania wrote on X:“The Washington Wizards are signing two-way center Tristan Vukcevic to a new three-year, $9 million deal, sources tell ESPN. Team option in third season. The Wizards and the 7-footer's agent, Jason Ranne of Wasserman, reached the new contract Saturday…”The 7-foot forward has just 15 NBA games left on his expiring two-way contract before he reaches the 50-game cap.

How Jakub Menšík built his rising tennis fortune



One big night can change how a career feels. For Jakub Menšík, Doha was that night. At the 2026 Qatar Open in Doha on February 19, the 19-year-old Czech delivered the biggest result of his career by defeating the world No. 2, Jannik Sinner, in the quarterfinals. He came through a tight three-set match, winning 7-6(3), 2-6, 6-3 after more than two hours on court. It was a composed and confident performance against one of the most consistent players in men’s tennis, and it sent Menšík into the semifinals with some serious momentum. He served boldly, swung freely and trusted his power when the pressure tightened.A win like that changes things. It gives a young player a lot of confidence. Opponents start taking him seriously. Fans stop calling him “one for the future.” And whenever a teenager breaks through like that, curiosity naturally turns to the bigger picture, which includes what it means financially. Let's take a look at his net worth.According to his official ATP Tour profile, Menšík has earned approximately $5.28 million in career prize money so far. For someone who is still only 19, that’s a whopping number.It reflects steady progression, consistent tour-level results and the ability to compete deep into events. But prize money figures can be misleading. The $5.28 million listed on the ATP site is gross income. Professional tennis players pay their own way. Coaches, physios and fitness trainers are not optional at this level but essential. Travel is constant and international. Hotels, flights and tournament expenses stack up quickly. Add management commissions and taxes across multiple countries, and the headline figure shrinks fast.Once those deductions are factored in, industry estimates suggest Menšík’s 2026 net worth likely falls somewhere between $1.5 million and $3.5 million. That range is typical for a rising ATP player who is earning well but still investing heavily in building a long-term career.Commercially, he’s still early in his journey. He doesn’t yet have the blockbuster endorsement deals that established top-10 stars command. However, statement wins dramatically increase visibility. Brands are drawn to youth, momentum and upside and a fearless teenager who just beat one of the sport’s most consistent players checks all three boxes.Right now, Menšík’s finances reflect a player climbing rather than one who has fully arrived. If performances like Doha become regular instead of rare, both his ranking and his earning power could rise very quickly.","Jakub menšík beat world no. 2 jannik sinner 7-6(3), 2-6, 6-3 in the quarterfinals of the 2026 qatar open in doha on february 19.

Tommaso Giacomel’s Olympic heartbreak as Johannes Dale-Skjevdal wins gold

Tommaso Giacomel looked ready for a medal. Then, in a shocking turn, he was sitting in the snow. The 22-year-old Italian biathlon star shocked fans after collapsing during the men’s 15km mass start at the 2026 Winter Olympics. The worrying moment happened in Anterselva during the Milan-Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics. Tommaso Giacomel was in strong form and even led the race at the halfway mark. He had hit all his targets in two shooting stages without a single miss. The home crowd believed a medal was coming. But things changed quickly. Giacomel began to slow down on the snowy track. Other athletes passed him. Soon after, television cameras showed him sitting on the ground in the woods section of the course. His ski poles were beside him. Officials rushed to check on him.According to Eurosport, commentators described it as a “Cursed Olympics” for Giacomel and reported that he appeared to struggle with his breathing. He did not finish the race. In fact, he was the only one among the 30 competitors who did not cross the finish line. More than an hour later, Italy coach Fabio Cianciana gave an update. He said, “Health comes before the races.If Tommy felt some pain in the ribs, it is right that he has stopped. ” He added, “After one minute, he already felt better. He went on his legs for the first medical check. Now he is doing other treatments and he is fine.”Cianciana also spoke about how well Giacomel was performing before the incident. He said, “The race was going very well. Once he passed unharmed from the prone shooting, we knew that Tommaso would have been very dangerous on the standing shooting.”While Giacomel’s race ended in pain, the competition continued. Johannes Dale-Skjevdal of Norway won gold with a perfect performance. He hit all 20 of his shots. His teammate Sturla Holm Laegreid took silver and finished the Games with a medal in each of the five races he entered.For Giacomel, this was his sixth event of the Olympics. He had already raced in the individual, sprint, pursuit, mass start, and team relay. He also won a silver medal in the mixed relay, which means he will not leave the Games without success.Still, the scene in Anterselva left fans concerned. A race that started with hope ended with worry.

United WE Announces Brittany Mahomes as First Champion for Change Winner



""at the decision-making table,""

In Kansas City, the Mahomes name is synonymous with winning but while Patrick is busy leading the Chiefs and recovering from his injury, Brittany Mahomes is carving out a legacy that is arguably just as historic. On February 19, 2026, it was officially announced that Brittany has been named the inaugural recipient of the Champion for Change Award by United WE.The honor isn't just a ""thank you"" for being a local celebrity, it’s a recognition of the serious economic and cultural shift Brittany has spearheaded in Missouri and beyond.The primary reason for the award is Brittany’s visionary leadership in women’s professional sports. As a co-owner of the KC Current, she didn't just buy into a team, she invested in an entire ecosystem. She was a driving force behind the construction of CPKC Stadium, which made global headlines for being the first stadium on Earth built specifically for a women’s professional team.United WE noted that her leadership proves that when women arethe entire economy grows stronger. By treating women’s sports as a ""growing economic engine"" rather than a side project, she has changed the blueprint for sports ownership in America.Beyond the soccer pitch, the award highlights her philanthropic work. Alongside her husband, Patrick Mahomes , Brittany has channeled millions through the 15 and the Mahomies Foundation. These funds have gone directly into underserved communities, focusing on children's health, wellness, and educational opportunities.The organization emphasized that Brittany’s role as an entrepreneur, investor, and mother of three makes her the perfect face for this new award. She represents a generation of women who aren't just participating in the conversation, they are leading it.Randi Mahomes celebrated this achievement of her daughter-in-law on her Instagram story, sharing her excitement and publicly showing support for Brittany’s special milestone.The award will be presented on May 6, 2026, during a milestone event at CPKC Stadium. It’s a full-circle moment for Brittany, receiving the ""Champion for Change"" honor in the very venue she helped build to change the game for women.As she continues to expand her reach including her recent induction into the UT Tyler Athletics Hall of Fame, Brittany Mahomes is proving that her impact on Kansas City is only just beginning.And as for Patrick Mahomes, who after the most difficult season of his career is finally giving Chiefs Kingdom something to smile about. As of late February 2026, the three-time Super Bowl MVP is well into his recovery from the torn ACL and LCL that ended his 2025 campaign prematurely.","Brittany mahomes has been named the inaugural recipient of the champion for change award by united we.

Mens Hockey Olympics : Sidney Crosby ruled out as Canada faces Finland after both teams win dramatic overtime quarterfinals

Winter Olympics fans woke up early on Friday ready to watch one of the biggest games of the 2026 Milano Cortina Games. But many were shocked when they could not see the start of the Canada vs Finland men’s hockey semifinal on regular TV. The game began at 10:40 a.m. Eastern Time. Instead of airing live on cable, the opening part of the matchup was available only on Peacock. USA Network, which is owned by NBCUniversal, showed the women’s speed skating 1500m during that time. NBC later scheduled delayed coverage of the hockey game at 11:50 a.m. ET on USA Network.Fans quickly shared their anger online. Many said they felt frustrated that such a major semifinal was not shown live on television. The matchup featured top-seeded Canada and defending 2022 Olympic champion Finland, making the decision even more surprising for viewers across the United States.The semifinal was already a huge story before the broadcast issue. Canada entered the game as the No. 1 seed, while Finland came in as the defending gold medalist from the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing.Both teams fought hard in the quarterfinals earlier in the week.Finland edged Switzerland 3-2 in overtime. Canada also needed extra time to beat Czechia 4-3. Those close wins set up what many believed would be one of the best hockey games of the tournament.However, Canada had to prepare without its captain, Sidney Crosby. The veteran forward suffered a lower-body injury during Wednesday’s quarterfinal and was ruled out of the semifinal. His absence was another major talking point heading into Friday’s game.Still, much of the online reaction focused on the broadcast choice. Fans took to X to express how they felt.One fan wrote, “Not having this Canada-Finland hockey game on a dedicated tv channel is infuriating to me.”Another posted, “Absolutely wild the Canada Finland semi final game isn’t on tv right now.”A different viewer added, “Why is my USA channel playing speed skating??? All your stars yet I have to have peacock to watch???”One more comment read, “Everywhere I look, I see that USA Network is supposed to be broadcasting the CAN/FIN hockey semifinal. Yet — they aren’t.”For many hockey fans, the issue was not about streaming itself. It was about missing the first hour of a major Olympic semifinal on traditional television. With two strong teams on the ice and a place in the gold medal game at stake, viewers expected full live coverage from the opening puck drop.","The canada vs finland men’s hockey semifinal began at 10:40 a.m. eastern time.

A peaceful base away from the tour for Novak Djokovic



Tennis legend Novak Djokovic has spent years living out of suitcases, hotel rooms and player lounges. So when he goes home, he really goes home. For the tennis great, that place is Marbella, Spain — a quiet, sun-soaked corner of the Costa del Sol where he can switch off from the noise of the tour and just be with his family. His villa is located in Sierra Blanca, one of Marbella’s most private and high-end residential areas. It sits slightly above the coastline, with open views of the Mediterranean and the mountains behind it. The neighborhood is known for security and seclusion. For someone as globally recognized as Djokovic, that kind of privacy isn’t a luxury, but a necessity.The house is large but not flashy. It is reported to span close to 1,000 square metres, with open living spaces and several bedrooms. Inside, the design is simple and calm, with marble floors, soft colours and large glass doors that bring in natural light. Outside, there is a spacious swimming pool and open terraces where the family can relax. The gardens are neatly kept and offer privacy and quiet.The villa also supports his training routine. It reportedly has nine bedrooms and eight bathrooms, along with a private gym and a spa area that includes a sauna and Turkish bath.There is a cinema room, a games room and a private tennis court where he can practise away from the public eye. With sea and mountain views around the property, the home works as both a peaceful retreat and a private training base. For a player known for his strict routines and recovery work, having those facilities at home makes sense. Even in downtime, the work doesn’t completely stop.The mansion is believed to be worth around $10 million approximately, reflecting both the prime location and its size. Djokovic is said to have settled there around 2020, after spending time in the area and enjoying the climate. Marbella offers warm weather most of the year, which is ideal for training. But more importantly, it offers space that is away from cameras and constant attention.For fans, it’s nice to see this side of Djokovic. On court, he is intense and fully focused. In Marbella, life is quieter and slower for the tennis icon. His home seems not about showing off, but about comfort, privacy and balance. After everything he has achieved in tennis, that may be what matters most.","Novak djokovic's marbella mansion has stunning views of the mediterranean sea.

Facing spin



Team news



New Zealand middle-order batter Mark Chapman looked perplexed when he was asked about the Super Eight groups, where all four table-toppers, who have done well in their respective groups, will end up facing each other. It has been done because of the pre-tournament seedings.The 31-year-old smiled and replied, “When it comes to scheduling and planning, that’s not really in my domain.”Chapman’s response sums up the way New Zealand play their cricket. No fuss, no theatrics, just straight down to business.After playing three matches in Chennai and one in Ahmedabad, all on red-soil pitches, the Kiwis had only one training session to adapt to the conditions ahead of their first Super Eight match against Pakistan at the R Premadasa Stadium.None of them rushed towards the pitch for a closer look. Once warm-ups were done, the players moved to the indoor nets. About an hour later, Daryl Mitchell came out barefoot to inspect the surface, spending a good fifteen minutes studying every inch of the 22 yards.Chapman, who did not get to see the surface, left it to the senior leadership group.“In the subcontinent, the toss always plays a factor depending on the conditions.I haven’t seen the pitch yet, so I don’t actually know what it looks like. There will be discussions behind the scenes with the senior leadership group about what we want to do,” he said.The black-soil pitches in Colombo do assist spinners, and with bigger boundaries and a slower outfield, it presents a new challenge for the 2021 T20 World Cup finalists.“We haven’t played in Sri Lanka yet. A lot of guys in our team have played a lot of cricket here, so I don’t see that playing too much of a factor. Guys understand what they need to do, and we are confident we will face whatever conditions are in front of us,” said Chapman, whose knees were heavily strapped.“In India, particularly on red-soil pitches, conditions have been favourable for batting. It has been tough for the bowlers, and the margins have been very small. We have seen scores close to 200 regularly.“Here, it is slightly different with the slower nature of the pitches. The bowlers will hopefully get a chance to show their skills, and spinners are more likely to play a part here,” he added.Although Pakistan are stationed in Sri Lanka, they played their group matches at two different venues in Colombo.New Zealand will be the only team playing all their Super Eight matches at the same venue, facing Pakistan on February 21, Sri Lanka on February 25, and England on February 27, all at the R Premadasa Stadium.“One of the challenges in tournaments like these is hopping from venue to venue and adapting. When we play three games at the same place, we learn with each game.“It is nice to turn up at the same venue with similar pitches and adjust. Tomorrow is our first game here, so we will have to adapt anyway, but we will understand the conditions better as we go,” he said.New Zealand’s first challenge will be Pakistan’s spin-heavy attack. Usman Tariq, Abrar Ahmad, Mohammad Nawaz, Saim Ayub, and Shadab Khan form a strong unit.“Pakistan have a number of very good spinners, each with their own threat. We have played them quite frequently over the last few years.“We are well aware of what they will bring. For us, it is about being really clear in how we want to play against them,” he said.Obviously, there was a Usman Tariq question: “Usman Tariq has a unique action with the way he pauses at the crease, so that is something to factor in.""Chapman, whose role is to take on spinners in the middle overs, explained why running between the wickets will be crucial.“Given the slower pitch and bigger boundaries, you have to change your game plan. Against spinners, it is about different options like the sweep or reverse sweep. In India, you can target straight boundaries more.“For me, it is about finding different areas of the ground. There are big pockets here, so it is not all about sixes. Twos, fours, and running between the wickets are very important, especially if it is not a high-scoring game,” he said.New Zealand have suffered injury setbacks. Michael Bracewell has been ruled out of the remainder of the tournament after re-injuring his left calf. Captain Mitchell Santner missed the last group match against Canada due to illness, while Lockie Ferguson returned home for the birth of his first child.“Mitchell Santner looks pretty sprightly and excited to get back on the park, barring any last-minute illness.“Lockie has just returned and is coming off a long flight. We will see how he pulls up. I cannot confirm whether he will be in the playing eleven,” Chapman said.","New zealand will be the only team playing all their super eight matches at the same venue, facing pakistan on february 21, sri lanka on february 25, and england on february 27.

Nina Westbrook speaks out after disturbing message sparks debate over sports betting culture

Russell Westbrook’s past clashes with fans resurface as criticism turns deeply personal

Russell Westbrook, a seasoned NBA guard, has faced criticism all of his career, but a recent incident went too far. An angry ""fan"" who was upset about her husband's performance on the court sent a startling email to Westbrook's wife, Nina, calling her a ""dumb b*tch"" and wishing they ""both die in a car crash. ""On Thursday night, Nina, who wed Westbrook in 2015, posted the unsettling statement on her Instagram story. Russ' 5-point performance in the Kings-Magic game seems to have prompted the note's sending. Nina chose not to react emotionally, instead framing the matter as a component of a broader problem associated with the explosive expansion of legal sports betting.After a bettor lost a parlay related to Westbrook's performance with the Sacramento Kings, Nina Westbrook disclosed that she received a violent email. Nina made the statement public in order to draw attention to what she called the negative aspects of contemporary gambling and sports culture. After disparaging the player's performance, the email turned into a threat against them both.The email titled ""F*** You"" reads:""Your piece of f***in sh*t husband sucks to f***n bad can't even get 1o points is pathetic. I hope you both die in a car crash dumb b*tch.""She described the harassment as a result of ""the negative effects of sports betting,"" highlighting the growing resentment of sportsmen and their families over lost income.However, athletes are not liable for specific wagers made by spectators. Player stats, whether they are five points or fifty, remain a component of the competition and do not constitute a wagering agreement. As betting grows more ingrained in broadcasts and fan interaction, the event reignited debate over the lines separating fandom from abuse.In response, Nina, a certified marital and family therapist and former collegiate basketball player, blamed sports gambling as the primary culprit in her Instagram story. Westbrook said:""The negative effects of sports betting.. Brings out the worst in ppl smh.""Westbrook, who joined the Kings in October 2025, regrettably has experience with rowdy fan conduct. A close-up video shows the former NBA MVP arguing with a Suns fan, among other verbal altercations with supporters during games.In response to his contentious interactions with fans, Westbrook, who has three children with Nina, has stated that he would not put up with disrespect, particularly when it concerns his family. For Westbrook, the circumstances are reminiscent of earlier encounters.When fans started making fun of him with different forms of his last name after he performed poorly during his tenure with the Los Angeles Lakers, the criticism became personal. The hostility finally affected his personal life and spread beyond social media to venues.","Russell westbrook's wife, nina, received a threatening email after a bettor lost a parlay related to her husband's performance with the sacramento kings.
