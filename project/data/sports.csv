Poll Do you think Shreyas Iyer deserves the title 'captain fantastic'? Yes, absolutely! No, not really.

Arshdeep Singh: The Poet Who Bowls Thunder | Stories from His Father & Coach

'I don't want to be a one-season wonder': Punjab Kings' Shashank Singh





Shashank Singh, in an exclusive interview with TimesofIndia.com, had given Shreyas Iyer a new moniker: Punjab Kings' ""captain fantastic."" ""He has his own swag, he has his own aura, and he backs his own instinct,"" Shashank, who had played with Iyer in age-group cricket in Mumbai, had to say about his IPL captain.On Sunday, in a rain-affected Qualifier 2, Shreyas Iyer displayed everything that Shashank was talking about. He didn't celebrate his half-century; he batted with surety, and it looked like he was calculating the chase in his mind. Chasing 204, Iyer, who is called 'sarpanch' (head of the village) by Punjab Kings fans, took charge. In the 13th over bowled by Reece Topley, Shreyas hammered a hat-trick of sixes, each better than the last one.Iyer (87 not out off 41 balls; 5x4s, 8x6s) guided Punjab Kings to their first IPL final in 11 years. Punjab Kings defeated Mumbai Indians by five wickets at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad.Punjab did get a flying start from Priyansh Arya (20 off 10 balls) and No. 3 Josh Inglis (38 off 21 balls). Inglis, especially, belted Bumrah for 20 runs in his first over. Not everyday does Bumrah get that kind of treatment.But Iyer found an able partner in Nehal Wadhera, who is called Ludhiana's Yuvraj Singh. Wadhera scored a counter-attacking 29-ball 48 and forged an 84-run stand for the fourth wicket in just 47 balls.Shreyas Iyer etched his name in the history books. He became the first IPL captain to take three different teams to the IPL finals. Iyer had led Delhi Capitals to the final in 2020, guided Kolkata Knight Riders to the title in 2024, and now has steered Punjab Kings. He is also the first captain to lead two different teams in successive finals.Not to forget, Mumbai Indians had never lost defending 200-plus, and now they've been knocked out doing so with an over to spare.Earlier, it looked like the Shreyas Iyer-led team had lost its steam after finishing top of the IPL points table. They were blown away by a red-hot Royal Challengers Bengaluru in Qualifier 1 at Mullanpur, and then they gave away too many freebies against Mumbai Indians in Qualifier 2.On Tuesday, they will have a chance to take revenge for the humiliation they had to face in front of their home crowd.Shreyas Iyer won the flip of the coin and, because of the weather, opted to field. The match was delayed for a couple of hours because of the rain, but it finally started, and there was no reduction in overs.Mumbai Indians rode on a power-packed start from Jonny Bairstow and Tilak Varma, and a late flourish by Naman Dhir, to post an imposing 203/6.Barring the first over bowled by Arshdeep Singh, the Punjab outfit looked completely at sea. They were wayward with the ball and abysmal in the field. If this was not enough, PBKS were later penalised for a slow over rate, and an extra fielder was brought into the circle for the last two overs.Rohit Sharma got a reprieve in the second over after Azmatullah Omarzai dropped a tough chance. It was not an easy catch as he had to back-pedal a long way to reach it; he got both hands to it but couldn't control it.The dropped catch didn't cost PBKS much, as Marcus Stoinis got the prized wicket and celebrated it by thumping his chest, which probably was the only time Punjab players celebrated with jubilation.Bairstow wasted no time in unleashing his trademark aggression. He took the attack to the Punjab bowlers right from the outset, peppering the boundary ropes and racing to 38 off just 24 deliveries. However, as the pitch began to grip and slow down, PBKS managed to claw their way back. Vyshak Vijaykumar gave the breakthrough, removing Bairstow with a knuckle ball.The experienced duo of Tilak Varma and Suryakumar Yadav steadied the ship. Their 72-run partnership for the third wicket came at a rapid pace. Both batters looked in control, mixing caution with aggression, before Punjab struck at a vital moment — right before and after the second strategic timeout.Yuzvendra Chahal, who was playing the match with an injection in his bowling hand, was sent on a leather hunt by Suryakumar Yadav, but the veteran spinner won the battle. Suryakumar kept playing the sweep shot against Chahal, but the leggie had the last laugh. It was pushed in the air a little; Suryakumar went down on his knee and slog-swept it, but didn't get the elevation, and Nehal Wadhera caught it near deep mid-wicket.In a sudden twist, both Suryakumar Yadav and Tilak Varma were dismissed for identical scores of 44, halting MI's momentum just when it looked like they would surge past 220.Naman Dhir's late blitz provided the final flourish. The swashbuckling batter smashed a quickfire 37 off just 18 balls, peppering the off-side and clearing the ropes to perfection. His knock ensured MI crossed the psychological 200-run mark.","Punjab kings defeated mumbai indians by five wickets in qualifier 2.

A huge roar erupted from the Punjab Kings' dugout and stands as Yuzvendra Chahal dismissed the dangerous Suryakumar Yadav during the IPL 2025 Qualifier 2 clash at Ahmedabad’s Narendra Modi Stadium. Among those celebrating were RJ Mahvash and franchise co-owner Preity Zinta , visibly ecstatic as PBKS struck a major blow in a high-pressure contest.Suryakumar, Mumbai Indians ’ batting mainstay this season, looked in sublime touch once again before falling for 44 off 26 balls. He had earlier hit Chahal for two sixes in the match before the leg-spinner had the last laugh. With this dismissal, the Surya vs Chahal battle in IPL now reads: 13 innings, 88 balls, 116 runs, four dismissals at an average of 29 and a strike rate of 131.81. Not dominant, but not a walkover either.Coming into the match, Surya had already amassed 673 runs in 15 innings at an average of 67.30, striking at 167.83. His wicket tilted momentum slightly in PBKS’s favour as they looked to restrict MI to a chaseable total. Punjab Kings had earlier won the toss and opted to bowl first under cloudy skies in Ahmedabad. The decision reaped early rewards as Rohit Sharma , fresh off a dazzling 80 in the Eliminator against Gujarat Titans, was dismissed for just 8 (7) by Marcus Stoinis.Rohit’s cheap dismissal meant he now shares an unwanted record with Suresh Raina for the most single-digit scores (9) in IPL knockout matches.Quiz: Who's that IPL player? Jonny Bairstow contributed a brisk 38 off 24 balls, while Tilak Varma anchored the innings with a composed 44 off 29. Despite these efforts, it was Suryakumar’s wicket that brought the loudest cheer from PBKS fans.With the scoreboard reading steady but not imposing, Mumbai now look towards captain Hardik Pandya and youngster Naman Dhir to provide the fireworks at the death and push the total past the par mark.

There have been no reports suggesting Vanessa’s pregnancy, and neither has she been spotted with anyone on a date with someone. So, these claims remain completely unverified, and it's unclear where the speculation originated.Some users have been sharing images of Vanessa, pointing to what they claim is a visible ""baby bump.""

Despite the absence of any reliable confirmation, the rumours have sparked intense online reactions, and Vanessa has also been receiving backlash from fans.Some fans appeared supportive of Vanessa. “Even if Vanessa Bryant is actually pregnant, y'all expect her to be single the rest of her life? Get a grip,” a fan wrote on X.. “Wait vanessa bryant is pregnant?” asked a surprised fan on X.Some fans also seemed concerned about Vanessa moving on with someone who’s so much younger, as reports surfaced that Vanessa’s basketball player boyfriend is only 27 years old. “Vanessa Bryant is pregnant by a 27 year old basketball player.Kobe gave his life, ruined family relationships behind this woman and just 5 years after the death of the man she spent over 20 years with, you get pregnant by another professional player 16 years younger than you. There are no rules out here fellas,” someone wrote on Facebook.Vanessa Bryant was married to NBA superstar Kobe Bryant, who tragically passed away on January 26, 2020, in a helicopter crash in California. The accident claimed the lives of nine people, including their 13-year-old daughter, Gianna Bryant. Kobe and Vanessa were married for nearly 19 years at the time of his death, having tied the knot in April 2001 when Vanessa was just 18 years old.Following the tragedy, Vanessa became the president and CEO of Granity Studios, Kobe’s multimedia company, and has continued to honour his legacy through the Mamba & Mambacita Sports Foundation, which supports underserved athletes and young women in sports.Vanessa has also used her platform to advocate for meaningful causes, including pushing for new safety legislation regarding helicopters and speaking out against the unauthorised sharing of graphic images from the crash site.

Auston Matthews and his fans got emotional as his mother opened up about the financial struggles of getting him into hockey,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/auston-matthews-and-his-fans-got-emotional-as-his-mother-opened-up-about-the-financial-struggles-of-getting-him-into-hockey/articleshow/121166477.cms,"Image credit - Paige Taylor White/CP

Auston Matthews’ hockey dream wasn’t cheap and his mom took the weight

“I used to work in the morning for Starbucks, in the afternoon the restaurant, i was very fortunate to have two jobs. And believe me, if they would have more hours, I would have more jobs.""





Before Auston Matthews was an NHL superstar, his biggest supporter was clocking into two jobs, trying to make ends meet. His mom, Ema Matthews, didn’t just believe in his dream, she bankrolled it, penny by penny, from behind a Starbucks counter. For families without deep pockets, hockey can be financially brutal. But Ema’s resilience turned obstacles into opportunity and her son into one of the league’s brightest stars. Her story is the heartwarming reminder that every great athlete often has a real-life superhero cheering from the sidelines, sacrificing, hustling, and holding it all together so their child can chase the impossible.Ice time, gear, coaching, travel, youth hockey isn’t just a sport, it’s a financial beast. For the Matthews family, especially with Ema being originally from Hermosillo, Mexico, the culture and cost of the sport were both daunting. But she took on the challenge without hesitation, picking up multiple jobs including a gig at Starbucks to ensure Auston never missed a chance to grow on the ice. She juggled long hours, late nights, and early mornings, often sacrificing her own comfort and time just to make sure Auston’s hockey dreams stayed alive and on track.Ema shared in a past interview that the cost of hockey often reached up to $20,000 a year, a heavy ask for any middle-class family. To make it work, she didn’t just cut corners, she picked up shifts and poured lattes while helping Auston stay focused on the sport. She even deposited small amounts of money in his account so he could grab food with teammates like a regular teen. Beyond that, Ema often drove long hours to tournaments, handled equipment costs, and juggled bills, all to ensure Auston had every chance to chase his dreams without added stress.Ema’s story also breaks stereotypes. In a sport dominated by players from Canada and northern U.S. states, Auston’s rise as a player of Mexican heritage makes his success even more impactful. It's not just about talent, it’s about trailblazing, especially for kids of color or immigrant families who rarely see themselves represented in hockey.Auston Matthews is one of the Toronto Maple Leafs’ biggest stars and a face of the NHL. He’s not just known for his goal-scoring skills but also for his poise and work ethic, traits his mom likely helped instill. While fans celebrate his success on the ice, stories like Ema’s remind us of the sacrifices behind the scenes that made it possible, from long car rides to practices, emotional support during tough losses, and the quiet strength that helped shape his journey to stardom.Ema Matthews’ story shows what’s possible when love, grit, and hustle lead the way, proving that behind every great athlete stands a family whose unwavering support shapes both their character and their incredible achievements. Her journey highlights the sacrifices, encouragement, and strength that fuel success, reminding us that triumphs on the ice are built far beyond the rink, in the hearts and homes of those who believe the most.Also read - “From baptism to strip club”: Pete Blackburn’s unhinged NHL comparison is going viral and fans totally get it","Auston matthews is one of the toronto maple leafs’ biggest stars and a face of the nhl.

Juan Soto breaks slump in style, ends homer drought and delivers big for Mets in crucial win







Juan Soto reminded baseball fans why he commands one of the most lucrative contracts in the sport with a thunderous 404-foot home run that snapped a 17-game drought. The blast, launched in the fourth inning of the Mets’ 8-2 win over the Colorado Rockies on Saturday, was more than just a number on the box score—it was a statement.After weeks of quiet at the plate, Soto's swing roared back to life with a 109.5 mph shot to left-center, despite facing a 14 mph wind pushing out to right field. “He put a really good swing on it,” Mets manager Carlos Mendoza said. “For him to hit it out of the ballpark like that on a day that the conditions are not in his favor, that’s pretty impressive.”Soto himself couldn’t hide his confidence. Grinning when asked if he thought the ball had enough to clear the fence, he responded, “I mean, 110 (mph), you’ve got to be. I knew it was gone.”The home run was his first since May 9, and although it marked the fourth-longest homerless stretch of his eight-year career, the fans at Citi Field never wavered. When Soto completed his home run trot, he raised his hands to acknowledge the roaring crowd. Just moments later, chants of “JUAN SO-TO” echoed from the right-field seats, to which he turned and raised his arms in appreciation. “It’s a great feeling when you feel the support like that,” he said.The moment became even sweeter when it followed Brandon Nimmo’s two-run homer, making it a back-to-back blast for the Mets. “Francisco (Lindor) and I were doing our picture down there,” Nimmo said of the team’s dugout celebration. “Heard the sound of the bat and the crowd going wild. We looked out and were able to see him go the other way. That’s when he’s the best.”While Soto’s $765 million, 15-year deal sets sky-high expectations, it also invites relentless scrutiny. Any slump feels seismic. But baseball is a game of streaks, and Mets president David Stearns offered a dose of reason during Soto’s recent struggles. “I think he's having good at-bats. He controls the strike zone pretty well. He's hitting the ball on the ground a little bit more than before and it's something he's aware of. ”The calendar turning to June and Soto’s power reawakening could signal a pivotal shift—not just for him, but for the Mets’ momentum going forward.Also Read: “I don’t know what to do”: Olivia Dunne breaks down over terrifying stalker encounter at airport","After 17 homerless games, juan soto’s bat explodes just when the mets needed it most.

Unsigned draft pick Craig Woodson wants to be a two-way star like the Jacksonville Jaguars’ Travis Hunter

Chicago Bears defensive tackle William Perry was called. Atlanta Falcons cornerback Deion Sanders is called. Pittsburgh Steelers running back Jerome Bettis was called. Detroit Lions fullback Nick Ryder was called. So many names. With so many meaningful explanations to them! But this one is going to surprise everyone! 2025 NFL Draft’s fourth-round, 106th pick - Craig Woodson, rookie safety for the New England Patriots, is called -Why? According to former Cal defensive backs coach Tre Watson, “That was a nickname I gave him(Craig Woodson) because he was always going to make us right.”On June 1, Tre Watson shared with Mike Reiss of ESPN, “Any week we went into a game plan, if there was a matchup or a formation or personnel, he(Craig Woodson) was going to be the one adjusting and cleaning up everything for us because he could handle it.As well as his presence in the post, we didn’t get a lot of shots in the middle of the field because Craig(Woodsen) was always going to be back there to erase it. If a play got busted, he was going to get it on the ground.That’s where it started, his name as ‘The Eraser’ because he was our clean-up guy.”“I like him(Craig Woodson). Smart. Savvy. He’s doing a great job soaking up what the coaches want him to do. Different techniques. College ball is a little different than the league - especially in the Pac-12. So, you know, he’s definitely doing a good job, though.” shares New England Patriots veteran safety Jabrill Peppers with Mark Daniels of MassLive.Mike Vrabel, head coach for the Patriots, instead praises the veteran safety, “I love Jabrill’s energy. I like his passion for the game. I like his energy when he comes in the building. Those things are all very positive, and then new players and the new additions are trying to carve out a role as well.”First-team All-ACC Craig Woodson calls himself a versatile safety. He talks about what he has to offer to the New England Patriots with Mark Daniels of MassLive. Woodson shares, “I think I can bring versatility when it comes to coverage, just being in the deep post or being in the deep half.I had some interceptions in the deep half this year, making plays on the ball. I think for me, I really have the versatility to do anything and even match up with a receiver if it comes down to it. For me, my play style is really anywhere. I don’t think there’s anything that I can’t do on the field. I’m just ready to show that to the Patriots Nation.”So now, like Travis Hunter of the Jacksonville Jaguars, everybody wants to be a two-way star? Travis Hunter is both a cornerback as well as a wide receiver. And now, Craig Woodson of the New England Patriots expressed his desire to play both safety and wide receiver! Is this wide receiver position so easy to adapt? That both cornerback and safety can play as a wide receiver?","Craig woodson, rookie safety of the new england patriots, was a clean-up guy at cal.

More Than a Team: The Rise of CSK & the Whistle Podu Army





In cricket, a diamond duck refers to a dismissal where the batter is out without facing a single delivery. It is one of the rarest and most unfortunate ways for a batter to get out. This usually happens through a run-out, where the non-striker is dismissed while attempting a run before facing a ball, or occasionally if the striker is run out from the non-striker’s end during a miscommunication.The term “duck” itself signifies a score of zero. It originated from the shape of the number ""0"", resembling a duck's egg. Various types of ducks exist, such as the golden duck (out on the first ball faced) or platinum duck (out on the first ball of the innings). A diamond duck is worse in some ways because the batter doesn't even get the chance to play a delivery.Diamond ducks are particularly painful for top-order batters or star players because they occur before any contribution is made. In team strategy and batting partnerships, these dismissals can disrupt momentum and confidence. They are also notable in statistical records and can be used in commentary to highlight the chaos or pressure in a particular moment of the game.Because of its rarity and the circumstances often surrounding it—poor communication, panic running, or sharp fielding—a diamond duck can become a talking point in post-match discussions and is often replayed in highlights as a moment of drama or misfortune.There have been 164 players to be dismissed for a Diamond Duck in ODI cricket with India recording 12 of them, including Roger Binny, Harbhajan Singh, Zaheer Khan (twice), Virat Kohli, Abey Kuruvilla, MSK Prasad, Venkatapathy Raju, Chetan Sharma, Navjot Singh Sidhu, S Sreesanth and Javagal Srinath.The first ever Diamond Duck in Test cricket came in the form of Albert Rose-Innes (South Africa) in 1889.","Diamond duck refers to a dismissal where the batter is out without facing a single delivery.

With a spot in the IPL 2025 final on the line, Punjab Kings skipper Shreyas Iyer made a bold call at the toss in Qualifier 2, opting to bowl first against five-time champions Mumbai Indians at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad on Sunday.Facing a do-or-die clash for a place in Tuesday’s summit showdown against Royal Challengers Bengaluru, Shreyas explained his reasoning for putting MI in to bat first.“We are going to bowl first. Slightly overcast and the wicket was under the covers as well,” Iyer said. “It’s a fresh game, our mindset is to go out and win. The environment is top-notch. Yuzi comes in.”The decision aligns with the conditions in Ahmedabad, where Pitch No. 7 — known for its even pace and flat surface — was used for the all-important game. Murali Kartik and Michael Clarke, analysing the strip before the toss, predicted a run-fest, calling it a “batter’s paradise” where 200-plus totals are par.Mumbai Indians captain Hardik Pandya echoed Iyer’s view, admitting he would have bowled first as well.“We also would have bowled first. We need to bat well and assess the conditions. It has got flatter.If you bowl well, you’ll get some help,” said Pandya. “We came very early morning after the last game, and most of the guys focussed on recovery. Topley comes in for Gleeson, who has a niggle.”Both captains clearly anticipated that chasing under lights might offer an advantage, especially with the venue’s dew factor in mind. With Ahmedabad offering true bounce and short square boundaries (61m and 67m), the match promised high-octane entertainment.Priyansh Arya, Josh Inglis (w), Shreyas Iyer (c), Nehal Wadhera, Marcus Stoinis, Shashank Singh, Azmatullah Omarzai, Kyle Jamieson, Vijaykumar Vyshak, Arshdeep Singh, Yuzvendra ChahalRohit Sharma, Jonny Bairstow (w), Suryakumar Yadav, Tilak Varma, Hardik Pandya (c), Naman Dhir, Mitchell Santner, Raj Bawa, Trent Boult, Jasprit Bumrah, Reece Topley","Mi captain hardik pandya and pbks skipper shreyas iyer at the toss.
