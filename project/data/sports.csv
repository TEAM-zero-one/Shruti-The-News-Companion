Patrick Mahomes questioned Travis Kelce’s Taylor Swift romance before seeing it himself,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/patrick-mahomes-questioned-travis-kelces-taylor-swift-romance-before-seeing-it-himself/articleshow/127156404.cms,"Patrick Mahomes revealed he initially doubted Travis Kelce’s relationship with Taylor Swift until she appeared at Arrowhead Stadium. ESPN’s The Kingdom showed locker room disbelief, massive fan buzz, and how Swift’s presence reshaped game day energy. Teammates admitted the attention was overwhelming, yet the Chiefs stayed focused and won.

How Taylor Swift’s first Chiefs game changed everything inside the locker room

The moment Taylor Swift walked into Arrowhead Stadium, the Kansas City Chiefs felt it instantly. Phones buzzed. Heads turned. Energy shifted. What began as a regular-season game against the Chicago Bears quietly transformed into one of the most talked-about crossover moments in modern sports culture. Long before the internet caught up, the buzz was already echoing through the locker room.Inside the Chiefs organization, disbelief mixed with excitement. This was not just another celebrity sighting. It was Taylor Swift showing up for Travis Kelce, and it forced teammates to process the moment in real time while preparing to win a football game. For some, it felt unreal. For others, it felt historic.ESPN’s documentary The Kingdom captured those early reactions with rare honesty. Defensive tackle Chris Jones summed it up perfectly, saying, “You know the locker room was like, ‘Taylor Swift’s here. Taylor Swift’s here. For real? With Travis? Oh my god.’” He added, “We’re like, ‘Oh my god, Travis pulled Taylor Swift,’” a line that quickly became one of the episode’s most replayed moments.Quarterback Patrick Mahomes admitted he was skeptical at first, even after Kelce gave him advance notice.“He told me during the week. I was one of those like, ‘I got to see it, you know? I got to see it until I believe it,’” Mahomes said. Once the game began, the distraction was impossible to miss. “That’s the first person I noticed. I didn’t see anybody else,” he told Kelce on the sideline.Mahomes later explained the atmosphere shift, saying, “You definitely felt the buzz and you could see people in the stadium gravitating toward where she was at there.” Still, the focus never wavered. “But at the same time, we had business to handle.”Head coach Andy Reid added another layer to the story, revealing, “By that time, I knew they were going out. I knew her before him.” He even joked about Kelce’s reaction when Swift mentioned their connection, recalling, “And he went, ‘Oh no.’”As the postseason unfolded, Taylor Swift became part of the Chiefs’ inner circle. After the AFC Championship win, cameras caught her thanking Brittany Mahomes for emotional support, saying, “You’ve kept me so calm the last couple weeks. I did not know what to do and I’d just text Brittany and just be like, ‘Tell me it’s going to be OK. Tell me it’s going to be OK.”What started as a rumor ended up reshaping the NFL spotlight. As one teammate put it best, “The Swifties are a real thing.”","Patrick mahomes revealed he initially doubted travis kelce's relationship with taylor swift.

Kid’s unexpected question forces Jordan Poole to revisit Draymond Green punch moment

How one practice altercation between Jordan Poole and Draymond Green changed the Warriors’ season?

Jordan Poole, now a guard for the New Orleans Pelicans, recently spent some time talking to a group of young basketball fans. It was meant to be a fun session, with kids asking questions about his journey in the NBA. But one question from a young fan caught him completely off guard and reminded him of a difficult moment from his time with the Golden State Warriors.The moment reminded everyone that even professional players have moments in their careers that stay with them, and for Poole, this involved a well-known incident with former teammate Draymond Green. What started as a simple meetup with kids turned into a conversation about one of the most talked-about moments in recent NBA history.Recently, Jordan Poole visited a group of young fans to answer questions and share his experiences. He expected questions about basketball and his favorite players. But one curious young fan surprised him by asking about the infamous punch from Draymond Green:“How did you feel when Draymond punched you?”The unexpected question clearly caught him off guard, but he handled it calmly, without getting defensive, saying, “It’s tough, bro”, before the clip cut.Jordan Poole admitted it was a tough moment, showing maturity and growth as a player. Instead of avoiding the topic, he acknowledged the past and used it as a learning experience. The incident highlighted that even NBA players face challenges, and also how young children’s curiosity can spark conversations that adults sometimes try to avoid.Back in October 2022, during a Warriors practice, tensions between Jordan Poole and Draymond Green were growing. An argument between the two escalated, and Green ended up punching Poole. This happened just a few months after the Warriors had won the 2022 NBA championship, and the incident created tension in a locker room that had been very united.The exact reason behind the punch was never officially confirmed, but it was clear that harsh words were exchanged. The event affected the team’s chemistry, and many believe it played a part in the Warriors' failure to win the championship title the following season. After the 2022–23 season, Poole was traded to the Washington Wizards, and Green later admitted:“You can’t call a man the b-word and push him and not get hit either,” so that was part of it”, indicating that the incident was one of his biggest mistakes.","Jordan poole visited a group of young basketball fans to answer questions.

Trade Deadline and Playoff Push

The NHL season is past the halfway point and a crucial stretch lies ahead. The biggest event on the calendar will take place overseas when the league shuts down operations to send its best players to the Winter Olympics in Milan, Italy.It marks the first Olympic participation for NHL players since 2014, ending a 12-year absence that kept stars like Connor McDavid, Nathan MacKinnon and Auston Matthews from representing their countries on hockey's biggest international stage.The break will dominate the middle portion of the schedule before teams return for the trade deadline and playoff positioning battles. The timing creates a unique rhythm for the season.

The format awards the three group winners and the best second-place team with byes directly to the quarterfinals.Teams ranked fifth through 12th will compete in playoff qualification games on February 17, with quarterfinals following on February 18 and semifinals on February 20. The bronze medal game is scheduled for February 21 with the gold medal game taking place February 22.No NHL trades can be processed during the Olympic break.

Anthony Davis’ agent Rich Paul gives the Mavs an ultimatum

Mavs’ Flagg factor and a bench in turmoil

The NBA rumor mill has just shifted into overdrive with Anthony Davis’ trade saga. According to bombshell reports from ESPN, Rich Paul, the high-powered CEO of Klutch Sports, has reportedly delivered a clear ultimatum to the Mavericks. While the February 5th deadline is looming, Paul is reportedly pushing for an immediate resolution to get the 10-time All-Star out of the Big D by next week.The timing couldn’t be more chaotic as the Mavericks are struggling in the West. They are currently at 12th place with a 19-26 record and a 14-11 at home. Davis got sidelined with left hand ligament injury against the Utah Jazz on January 8th and has been reported to remain out through February. For the Mavs front office and fans, Davis’ underperformance remains a sore subject, and this trade demand by Rich Paul feels like the messy climax to a star experiment that didn’t pay off even after trading Luka Doncic.When the Dallas Mavericks acquired Davis back in early 2025 in exchange for sending their star player, Luka Doncic, two things happened. First came the fan outrage with “fire Nico” chants at every game.Second was the sky-high expectations from the 2024 Olympic Gold medalist.’The vision was to build a dominant roster with Anthony Davis, Kyrie Irving, and rookie phenom Cooper Flagg, turning the Mavs into immediate contenders. But what instead unfolded was Davis’ series of injuries. He just appeared in 20 games this season and averaged 20.4 points, 11.1 rebounds, and 2.8 assists.“It is very clear that Rich Paul, who represents Anthony Davis, wants Anthony Davis traded before the deadline,” MacMahon reported on. “He believes it’s in his best business interest, because he has taken a ‘Well, we’ll see’ from the Mavericks regarding an extension as a ‘no.’”Despite all the drama, Mavericks’ Copper factor is working its magic on the court. The rookie sensation is averaging 18.8 points, 6.4 rebounds, and 4.1 assists while shooting 47.7% from the field. But a lone man can’t run the show. With Kyrie Irving still recovering from ACL surgery, the Mavericks' roster is thin and too much for a 19-year-old to carry.Patrick Dumont isn't backing down easily. Insiders claim the team has no intention of being bullied into a bad deal. They want a haul of draft picks and young talent, not just a salary dump. Whether it’s a late-night deal with the Hawks or a blockbuster with the Raptors, the next seven days will determine if Dallas is building for the future or simply stuck in the mud.","The nba rumor mill has just shifted into overdrive with anthony davis’ trade saga.

Evgeni Malkin contributes two points as Oilers get beaten 6-2 by Penguins

Evgeni Malkin scored a breakaway goal against his former teammate Thursday night, stripped the puck from Connor McDavid to set up the play, and looked every bit like a player who belongs in the NHL for years to come.The Penguins cruised past Edmonton 6-2 in a statement win that extended their winning streak to three games and improved their record to 10-2-2 since the holiday break. Pittsburgh now sits in second place in the Metropolitan Division with 25-14-11, firmly in playoff position after a rough stretch earlier in the season.When a reporter noted after the game that Malkin doesn't look like someone preparing to retire anytime soon, the 39-year-old had a quick response. ""I never say I want to, you know, it's all you,"" Malkin said. ""But again I feel great, and again, like how we play, it's always fun to win.""Malkin's performance Thursday showcased the skill and hockey sense that made him one of the game's elite centers for nearly two decades. He poked the puck away from McDavid at the Pittsburgh blue line despite being at the end of a 1:21 shift, then raced down ice on a breakaway and beat Tristan Jarry with a backhand through the pads.The goal made it 5-1 and effectively ended any hope of an Edmonton comeback. Malkin also assisted on Rickard Rakell's goal earlier in the second period, threading a pass from behind the net through traffic to set up the finish.The reporter pressed further, suggesting Malkin's legs look as good as they have in quite some time. ""I don't know; it's hard to say, but I hope that you see,"" Malkin said. ""I mean, it's not easy. I mean, but again, I try to do my best because I know I won't play like I won't play for many more years.""Malkin's message was clear even through the language barrier. He knows his time is limited, but that reality only drives him to prove he still belongs at the NHL level. The veteran’s passion was visible as he explained, ""You know, I want to show, like, I see a great player.""He continued, ""You know, I want to see like I want to see everybody see like I can't play next year. You know, it's my goal right now."" Malkin has made it clear that he is enjoying his time playing alongside his teammates as the Russian and longtime linemate Sidney Crosby look to finally break their playoff drought.He singled out his linemates Tommy Novak and Egor Chinakhov for praise, highlighting how the unit has clicked in recent games.

NFL MVP and longtime 49ers star John Brodie passes away at 90



The death of a football legend has created a profound silence on the field of San Francisco and the whole NFL. John Brodie was not just another quarter back in another era. He represented the element of consistency, hardness, and faithfulness at the period when the league was yet discovering its current identity. The passing of a 90-year-old player is the end of an era of a player who had an impact that was much more than statistics and box scores.Brodie was the symbol of stability in change to generations of 49ers fans. He performed in the period when Super Bowls were not used to mark legacies, but his presence is imprinted in the history of the franchise. Whenever leadership, longevity, and silent superiority in a crisis are discussed, his name continues to be mentioned. While his death was recently reported, a specific cause was not immediately disclosed, though he had previously overcome a severe stroke in 2000.John Brodie spent his entire 17 year NFL career with the San Francisco 49ers, a franchise record that still stands. The team confirmed he died Friday, with his family noting he had suffered a stroke in 2000. Brodie won the NFL MVP award in 1970 and retired as one of the most productive passers the league had ever seen.“The 49ers family is saddened to learn of the passing of one of the franchise’s all-time great players, John Brodie,” said team co-chairman John York. “As a kid, my 49ers fandom began by watching John play quarterback on television. He displayed an incredible commitment toward his teammates and his support of the organization never wavered after his playing days.“John became a dear friend of mine, and he will always be remembered as an important part of 49ers history. We express our deepest condolences to his wife, Sue, and the entire Brodie family.”Brodie’s numbers still resonate. His 31,548 passing yards rank second in franchise history behind Joe Montana, and his 214 touchdown passes remain third all time for the team. He led the NFL in passing yards three times and earned multiple All Pro honors.Those who played alongside him remember more than stats. “He was a great guy, a super competitor, I don’t care what it was: football, cards, golf,” former teammate Jerry Mertens said. “The guy just did it all, and he was a great leader, there’s no question about that.”After football, Brodie thrived as a broadcaster and elite golfer, even winning on the senior tour. Few athletes have lived so fully in competition. Even fewer left behind a legacy as complete.","John brodie, the longtime face of the san francisco 49ers, has died at 90.

Arshdeep Singh press conference: on adapting to conditions, team roles & bowling plans | IND vs NZ 1st T20I

Former Pakistan spinner Danish Kaneria has backed the ICC’s decision to stick to the original schedule after the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) chose not to travel to India for the 2026 ICC Men’s T20 World Cup. Kaneria said Bangladesh opting out would not make much of an impact, remarking that “it’s not like they were going to finish in the top four. ”Bangladesh had earlier informed the ICC of its decision not to travel to India, citing security concerns amid strained relations between the two countries, and requested that its matches be shifted to Sri Lanka. However, the ICC reiterated on Wednesday that the T20 World Cup will go ahead as planned, with Bangladesh’s matches scheduled to be played in India.The standoff comes in the backdrop of the BCCI directing Kolkata Knight Riders to release Bangladesh pacer Mustafizur Rahman ahead of IPL 2026 amid prevailing political tensions.Speaking to IANS, Kaneria said, “There was the issue of Mustafizur, who was with KKR, and the team was forced to sideline him because of the kind of unrest and the public reaction. Shah Rukh Khan, who is the owner of KKR, released him. There was no pressure from the BCCI, nor from the ICC.But for humanity, he did what he thought was right.“The BCCI or ICC never asked Bangladesh not to come to India. They welcomed them. All the teams in the ICC umbrella get foolproof security.”Referring to the ICC meeting that followed, Kaneria added, “You saw that a meeting took place where all the boards were present—from England to Australia, West Indies—every board that is part of the ICC was there. When voting took place, everyone supported what the ICC proposed. Only the Pakistan Cricket Board voted along with Bangladesh. Just two votes went against it.”Kaneria also described the developments in Bangladesh prior to the standoff as disturbing on humanitarian grounds.“When I look at this entire scenario, what was going on in Bangladesh, the kind of situation that developed there, the way our Hindu brothers and sisters and others were treated, the way incidents happened, it was wrong, first of all,” Kaneria said.“Our religion doesn’t teach violence; it is a religion of love. People were just earning their livelihood, doing their jobs, and they were attacked without any reason. The strange and disturbing acts that took place were very sad. It really makes your heart sink—what is going on?”The former spinner warned that Bangladesh’s firm stance could hurt the country’s cricketing future in the long run.“In my view, this is not going to be good for Bangladesh in the long run. If they think that whatever they say should be accepted by the ICC as a decision, that won’t work. Going forward, India will not play with Bangladesh anyway, and that will be a big loss for them.”Backing the ICC’s decision-making process, Kaneria stressed that major tournaments cannot be altered at the last moment. “I believe the ICC’s decision is absolutely correct, because things cannot be changed at the last minute. You have to prepare the entire tournament structure, schedules, and team travel. You have to change the whole scenario.“If Bangladesh feels they don’t want to play, then don’t play. It won’t make much difference anyway; it’s not like they were going to finish in the top four,” he added.Dismissing reports that Pakistan could follow Bangladesh’s lead, Kaneria said the ICC has alternatives in place.“I don’t think that will happen. Because who suffers the loss? The country that backs out suffers the loss. There are penalties, rules and regulations. If Bangladesh doesn’t go, Scotland can come in. If Pakistan refuses, some other team will come. Namibia is playing very good cricket. The ICC and BCCI won’t be affected.”Kaneria also pointed out that Bangladesh’s participation could have opened doors for its players in the IPL. “If Bangladesh had come to play the T20 World Cup in India, then the barrier that has been created in the IPL with Mustafizur Rahman would have broken, and more Bangladeshi players would have taken part in the league.”He further lamented the shift in cricket discourse away from the sport itself.“Now cricket is no longer being discussed, and only politics is being talked about. Earlier, people talked about wickets, bowling, and techniques. Now everything has become political.”“Technical cricket doesn’t sell. What sells? Kohli vs Babar comparisons. Shaheen Afridi vs Bumrah comparisons,” he noted.Calling for restraint, Kaneria urged stakeholders to keep politics out of the sport.“For the future generation, it is very important that cricket is protected and promoted. Look at cricket as cricket. Let politics remain with politicians and authorities. Do not involve cricket in politics.”He concluded by emphasising the need for long-term thinking. “You have to look at the long picture, not the short. Now let’s see what the final decision is, though in my opinion it must already have been taken, as nearly 24 hours have passed. What is good for cricket must be done, and as I said earlier, Scotland would already be preparing to face spin.”","Danish kaneria has backed the icc's decision to stick to the original schedule for the 2026 icc men's t20 world cup.

What sparked the standoff?

Poll Should the ICC consider moving the T20 World Cup matches from India to a neutral venue? Yes, for security reasons No, it should remain in India Undecided Only if the BCB provides more evidence

Hours after standing firm on its demand to have its T20 World Cup matches moved from India to Sri Lanka, the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) has written another letter to the International Cricket Council (ICC), requesting that Bangladesh’s demand for a change of venue be referred to the ICC’s independent dispute resolution committee, TimesofIndia.com has learnt.The committee, which consists of independent lawyers, resolves disputes related to ICC matters. The BCB hopes the ICC will respond to the request and refer the demand for a venue change to the Dispute Resolution Committee (DRC).The ICC Dispute Resolution Committee is an independent arbitration body that resolves disputes connected to international cricket. It can hear cases involving the ICC, member boards, players, officials and related parties, once all internal remedies have been exhausted.Operating under English law with proceedings seated in London, the DRC conducts confidential arbitration through independent panels. Its role is to assess the lawfulness and interpretation of ICC decisions, regulations and contracts, rather than act as an appeal forum.DRC rulings are final and binding, with no right of appeal except on very limited procedural grounds.Bangladesh has reiterated that its refusal to play the upcoming T20 World Cup in India is solely due to security concerns and is a sovereign decision.Sports Adviser Asif Nazrul said on Thursday that there is no scope for Bangladesh to change its decision not to travel to India for the tournament.“As the ICC has also not accepted Bangladesh’s request to change the venue, it now effectively means that Bangladesh will not be taking part in this year’s T20 World Cup,” Nazrul told reporters in Dhaka after meeting senior Bangladesh cricketers.Nazrul also accused the ICC of failing to ensure justice by not considering Bangladesh’s request for a venue shift.“Our security risk in playing in India has not changed at all,” he said. “This concern did not arise from any imaginary analysis or assumption. It arose from a real incident, where one of the best players of our country was forced to bow his head before extremists, and the Indian cricket board removed him from India, plainly speaking, asked him to leave.”Earlier on Wednesday, the ICC rejected the BCB’s request to relocate Bangladesh’s matches from India and decided to keep the tournament schedule unchanged following a board meeting. The ICC also gave the BCB a one-day deadline to decide, after consulting the government, whether the team would travel to India.“The ICC’s venue and scheduling decisions are guided by objective threat assessments, host guarantees and the tournament’s agreed terms of participation, which apply uniformly to all 20 competing nations,” the ICC said in a statement.“In the absence of any independent security findings that materially compromise the safety of the Bangladesh team, the ICC is unable to relocate fixtures. Doing so would carry significant logistical and scheduling consequences for other teams and fans worldwide, and would also create precedent-related challenges that risk undermining the neutrality, fairness and integrity of ICC governance.”Bangladesh are in Group C alongside England, Italy, West Indies and Nepal, and are scheduled to play their first three matches in Kolkata and their final game in Mumbai. They face West Indies on February 7, the opening day of the tournament.BCB president Aminul Islam Bulbul revealed that Mustafizur Rahman’s removal from an IPL team due to security concerns triggered Bangladesh’s hardened stance against travelling to India.Bulbul said Mustafizur was neither injured nor had he withdrawn from the IPL. The BCB hadn't revoked his No Objection Certificate either. “He was dropped due to security reasons,” Bulbul said, calling it a moment that raised serious red flags for Bangladesh cricket.According to Bulbul, once the BCB learned of Mustafizur’s removal, it immediately contacted the ICC on January 4.“We informed them of the situation and asked them to take it seriously,” he said. “If a player can be removed from a league due to security concerns, how can we ignore those same concerns for a World Cup?”Bulbul added that the BCB proposed solutions rather than confrontation, citing past instances where neutral venues or hybrid models were adopted due to security issues in ICC tournaments.“We asked the ICC to follow that logic,” he said. “Let us play the World Cup, but at a neutral venue like Sri Lanka or elsewhere.”","Bangladesh cricket board (bcb) has written another letter to the international cricket council (icc) requesting that bangladesh’s demand for a change of venue be referred to the icc”s independent dispute resolution committee.

Replacement teams in ICC events



Scotland replaced New Zealand in 2022:

Similar drama in 2009 T20 World Cup



The ICC T20 World Cup 2026 is just two weeks away, and the controversy over the participation of the Bangladesh cricket team in the tournament remains unresolved. The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) on Thursday categorically announced, after a meeting with the country’s sports advisor and national team cricketers in Dhaka, that under no circumstances would it send the team to India to play matches, while blaming the International Cricket Council (ICC) for denying them “justice”.The entire cricketing world is now waiting for the ICC’s next move. The global governing body had already voted on Wednesday against Bangladesh’s request for a venue shift to co-host Sri Lanka, while issuing a 24-hour ultimatum to the BCB.With the BCB virtually out of the tournament due to its defiant stand, the ICC now has to kickstart its contingency plan for the mega event sooner rather than later. Scotland has emerged as the frontrunner to play the World Cup in place of Bangladesh, with the ICC expected to make it official soon.What began as a controversy has turned into a never-ending drama since Indian Premier League franchise Kolkata Knight Riders were asked by the BCCI to release star Bangladesh pacer Mustafizur Rahman from their squad without any “specific” reason amid growing tensions between the two neighbouring countries.Bangladesh reacted immediately, deciding not to send its team to India for the T20 World Cup, while also banning the broadcast of the IPL in the country.Since then, a tussle between the ICC and the BCB over the venue shift has continued, and with the tournament just around the corner, a final decision is expected soon. Despite standing firm on its refusal to travel to India — where Bangladesh are scheduled to play all three group matches in Kolkata and Mumbai — the BCB has not formally announced its withdrawal from the tournament, leaving room for manoeuvre. However, any change in the ICC’s stance on altering the schedule so close to the event appears unlikely.If Scotland is officially announced as a replacement, would it be unprecedented? No. There have been precedents in past ICC events.An entire team being replaced by another for an ICC event is a rare occurrence, and the last time Bangladesh were involved in such a row was a decade ago, when they hosted the Under-19 World Cup in 2016.Australia withdrew from the ICC U19 World Cup in Bangladesh and were replaced by Ireland. The seeds of the withdrawal were sown a year earlier, when Australia pulled out of a bilateral series citing security concerns. With the situation not improving, Australia decided to stay away from the tournament.Australia’s official line at the time was that the “threat to Australian interests in Bangladesh” remained high. The ICC termed the decision “disappointing” before naming Ireland as the replacement. West Indies went on to win their maiden U19 World Cup title, beating India by five wickets in the final in Dhaka.Replacement of a team happened again at the U19 World Cup in 2022 too. This time, the New Zealand team withdrew due to strict Covid-19 quarantine regulations for minors upon return home. The ICC then brought in Scotland as the replacement team for the tournament held in the Caribbean.Before that, the 2009 T20 World Cup in England also saw a replacement team. The backdrop dated back to the 2003 ODI World Cup co-hosted by South Africa, Zimbabwe and Kenya, where England and New Zealand forfeited matches in Zimbabwe and Kenya respectively due to political and security concerns.In 2009, visa issues and political tensions again put Zimbabwe’s participation in doubt. Eventually, Zimbabwe withdrew with full participation fees, and Scotland were named as the replacement. Pakistan went on to win the tournament, defeating Sri Lanka by eight wickets in the final at Lord’s.","Bangladesh cricket board (bcb) refused to send team to india for t20 world cup.

Arshdeep Singh press conference: on adapting to conditions, team roles & bowling plans | IND vs NZ 1st T20I

Former Pakistan captain Rashid Latif has called on the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) to take a hard stance and boycott the upcoming Men’s T20 World Cup, urging it to stand shoulder to shoulder with Bangladesh amid the ongoing scheduling and security dispute.The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) is facing the threat of being excluded from the 20-team tournament if it refuses to travel to India, citing security concerns. On Wednesday, the ICC made its position clear, stating that the original schedule would remain unchanged and that Bangladesh’s request to relocate its matches to Sri Lanka would not be entertained. The BCB has been given a 24-hour window to consult with its government and confirm whether the team will participate.With tensions simmering between the ICC and the BCB, Latif said this was the right moment for Pakistan to challenge what he described as the prevailing cricketing power structure by withdrawing from the tournament.Recent reports in Pakistani media suggest the PCB has already expressed solidarity with Bangladesh, with the board’s leadership even pausing the national team’s World Cup preparations while awaiting clarity on the situation.“If Pakistan and India don’t happen, 50 per cent of your World Cup is gone. This is a great opportunity to challenge the existing cricket order,” Latif said on the YouTube channel CaughtBehindShow.“Pakistan should say they stand with Bangladesh and refuse to play the T20 World Cup. This is the time to take a stand. You need a strong heart to do it,” he added.Latif also took aim at the ICC’s handling of the issue, questioning its refusal to consider Bangladesh’s request to move matches to Sri Lanka. He pointed out that similar adjustments had been made in the past when India and Pakistan declined to tour each other for global events.“It doesn’t feel like a good decision. Today, the ICC says there is no danger to Bangladeshi players in India. No agency in the world can say there is no danger — how can the ICC say that?” Latif said. “Even in the most secure places, no one can give such a guarantee. Hopefully, nothing happens to any team.”He stressed that Pakistan holds significant leverage in the current scenario and should use it decisively.“The trump card is still with Pakistan. Bangladesh’s stance is right. Pakistan won’t get a better opportunity than this. Pakistan not playing would be like stopping the World Cup. Pakistan is the key,” Latif said. “Yes, Pakistan could suffer in the future. There could be sanctions if Pakistan refuses to play ICC events. But there is no use of just words — now is the time to show who you support.”The Men’s T20 World Cup is scheduled to be held in India and Sri Lanka from February 7 to March 8, with matches spread across eight venues. Bangladesh have been placed in Group C alongside England, Nepal, Italy and the West Indies. Pakistan, meanwhile, are drawn in Group A with India, Namibia, the Netherlands and the USA.","Former pakistan captain rashid latif has called on the pakistan cricket board (pcb) to take a hard stance and boycott the upcoming men’s t20 world cup.

Steelers’ interest in Mike McCarthy centers on Team Direction

The Steelers kicked off their head coach search with a move that shook up the rumor mill. Mike McCarthy entered the mix this week, and fans quickly tied his name to one storyline. Aaron Rodgers . The connection feels natural because of their long history in Green Bay. Still, league insiders say Pittsburgh’s interest goes beyond any quarterback reunion.Pittsburgh looks at a roster built to win now. Veterans lead both sides of the ball. The front office wants a coach who can step in and compete right away. That goal drives this search more than any single player.The key update came recently. NFL Network insider Tom Pelissero, on The Rich Eisen Show, addressed Rodgers' talk directly.“I do believe that if Aaron Rodgers were coming back to play for one coach in 2026, it would be Mike McCarthy,” Pelissero said. “But I think people may have misconstrued when I mentioned that on the show the other day as, ‘Well, this is the Steelers trying to lure back Aaron Rodgers.’ That’s not it at all.”Pelissero added more context during the same appearance. “If they hire Mike McCarthy, and that’s not a given, if they hire Mike McCarthy, they are doing it for the totality of what direction they think they can go right now,” Pelissero said.“They’ve got a very, very veteran roster.”The Steelers interviewed McCarthy as they searched for a replacement for Mike Tomlin, who stepped down after the 2025 season. McCarthy brings 18 seasons of head coaching experience with the Packers and Big D. He holds a 174-112-2 career record and won Super Bowl XLV with Green Bay.A-Rod's future remains uncertain. ESPN insider Adam Schefter reported in January 2026 that Rodgers has not committed to retirement or a return to the Steelers. That uncertainty keeps the speculation alive, but Pittsburgh’s front office looks at the full picture.Tomlin left after 19 seasons in charge, ending one of the longest and most stable coaching tenures in NFL history. His exit has left a huge gap in Pittsburgh, and the crew are now carefully evaluating experienced names as they look to reset their direction.The Steelers want leadership, structure, and experience on the sideline. McCarthy’s résumé fits that need.

Shivam Dube press conference: On Ishan and Surya’s knock & his role with the ball

NEW DELHI: Indian skipper Suryakumar Yadav said the hosts want their batters to play with freedom and express themselves, praising Ishan Kishan ’s fearless strokeplay as a true reflection of the team’s mindset after India defeated New Zealand by seven wickets in the second T20I in Raipur on Friday.Despite some assistance from the dew, India’s chase of 209 began on a shaky note. Sanju Samson departed for 6, Abhishek Sharma fell for a golden duck, and the hosts were suddenly reeling at 6 for 2. What followed, however, was a breathtaking counterattack as Ishan Kishan and Suryakumar Yadav added 122 runs in just 48 balls for the third wicket, transforming what appeared to be a daunting chase into a comfortable one.Kishan did most of the early damage with his aggressive approach, scoring 76 off 32 balls, including a 21-ball fifty, before mis-hitting Ish Sodhi for a catch off the bowler’s own bowling. By then, the contest had already swung decisively in India’s favour.Suryakumar, meanwhile, finished with a superb 82 off just 37 balls, once again underlining his class and importance to the side only weeks ahead of a home T20 World Cup.""I didn't know what Ishan had for lunch. Never saw anyone hit the ball like he did. This is what we want from the batters to go out there and express themselves, be happy. I was angry he didn't give me a strike in the Power-play.But I knew that we had time and could cover up. I was batting really well in the nets, I got some good time with family and friends, and I am enjoying what's happening right now,"" Suryakumar Yadav said after the match.The emphatic finish also became the biggest win by balls remaining for a full-member nation while chasing a target of over 200. It surpassed Pakistan’s 24-ball win against New Zealand in Auckland in 2025 and Australia’s 23-ball victory over West Indies in Basseterre in the same year.India’s bowling, however, had its struggles. Arshdeep Singh endured a difficult outing, conceding 53 runs without a wicket. Hardik Pandya was more economical, returning figures of 1 for 25 from three overs, while Harshit Rana, despite bowling a wicket maiden, finished with 1 for 35 from three overs. The spin pair of Kuldeep Yadav and Varun Chakaravarthy combined for eight overs, claiming three wickets while giving away 70 runs. Shivam Dube also chipped in with a wicket.Suryakumar praised the collective bowling effort, admitting that India had feared New Zealand could push the total to 225–230, while singling out Kuldeep Yadav, Varun Chakaravarthy, Shivam Dube and Hardik Pandya for restricting the visitors to 208.""It was an incredible effort. We thought they would add 225-230. The way Kuldeep, Varun, Dube, and Hardik. Everyone took their responsibility, and to restrict them to under 210 was a great effort.""He also highlighted the relaxed and positive atmosphere within the camp, stressing that India remain committed to playing their brand of cricket while giving their all in every aspect.""I am really enjoying. The mood in the camp is happy. We want to play the same brand of cricket and leave no stone unturned.""","India defeated new zealand by seven wickets in the second t20i in raipur on friday.

NBA YoungBoy reportedly frustrated after Kai Cenat ignores outreach





DJ Akademiks has added new details to the ongoing drama involving Kai Cenat, NBA YoungBoy, and rumors of an alleged affair. Speaking on stream, Akademiks claimed that NBA YoungBoy personally attempted to reach out to Kai Cenat to clear his name after online speculation linked him to Kai’s ex-girlfriend, Gigi Alayah. According to Akademiks, Kai did not respond to the outreach, which has left NBA YoungBoy’s camp frustrated. They believe the rumor has continued to spread because there was no direct conversation to shut it down early, despite YoungBoy strongly denying any involvement.The controversy began shortly after Kai Cenat announced his breakup on December 27, 2025, posting online that he was single and stepping away from relationships. Soon after, unverified posts started circulating on X, claiming Gigi Alayah had cheated on Kai with NBA YoungBoy. The story quickly gained traction across social media, pulling multiple high-profile names into the discussion. Gigi later responded publicly, denying the allegations and stating she ended the relationship herself, never cheated, and had no connection to NBA YoungBoy.Akademiks explained that while he is not placing blame on Kai Cenat, the lack of communication has allowed the rumor to linger.He claimed NBA YoungBoy wanted a direct conversation with Kai to deny the allegations and stop fans from associating his name with the situation. According to Akademiks, YoungBoy’s team believes the timing of the rumor was suspicious and possibly planted, especially given how quickly it spread following Kai’s breakup announcement.The rapper’s camp is reportedly unhappy because the situation continues to affect YoungBoy’s reputation, even though he has denied the claims. Akademiks urged Kai to take the call, suggesting that a private discussion could help put the issue to rest. However, as of now, no reconciliation or public clarification between the two has taken place. Fans continue to debate the situation, keeping the story alive in both hip-hop and streaming communities.For Kai Cenat, the drama occurs at a time when he has been very open and outspoken about seeking healing and personal growth after the breakup. On one hand, he may have decided to keep quiet on the rumors; nevertheless, the fact that he is keeping quiet is a big part of the debate. As long as there is no direct communication and statement between all parties involved, one will know how rumor and drama can escalate online concerning popular personalities.",Nba youngboy reportedly frustrated after kai cenat ignores outreach to clear his name.
