Travis Hunter and Shedeur Sanders get hero’s farewell as Colorado honors duo in style



Shedeur Sanders and Travis Hunter , two of college football ’s brightest stars, will be immortalized in Colorado Buffaloes history this Saturday as their jersey numbers—No. 2 and No. 12—are officially retired during the Spring Game. The duo, who propelled the University of Colorado to a new era of national relevance under head coach Deion Sanders , will return to Folsom Field for a ceremony that is as symbolic as it is historic.Shedeur Sanders and Travis Hunter weren’t just teammates—they were the beating heart of a Colorado program that underwent a dramatic transformation in just two seasons. In 2022, the Buffs posted a dismal 1-11 record. But after the arrival of Coach Prime and his talented son Shedeur, along with two-way phenom Travis Hunter, Colorado surged to 4-8 in 2023 and finished 2024 with a stunning 9-4 record—their best season since 2016.Travis Hunter’s 2024 season was nothing short of legendary. Dominating on both sides of the ball, he hauled in 96 receptions for 1,258 yards and 16 touchdowns while also recording 35 tackles, four interceptions, and 11 passes defensed as a lockdown corner. His efforts earned him a clean sweep of college football’s highest honors. “He became the most honored player in the history of college football in 2024,” the school noted, as he claimed the Heisman Trophy, the Walter Camp Award, and both the AP and Sporting News Player of the Year accolades. He also won the Paul Hornung Award—again—and was named the nation's best wide receiver and best defensive player.But Hunter’s brilliance extended beyond the field. He was named to the Academic All-American First Team and was honored as the Academic All-American of the Year, becoming only the second Colorado athlete to achieve that distinction. Over his collegiate career, he totaled 153 receptions, 1,989 yards, and 20 touchdowns on offense, while adding 67 tackles and seven interceptions defensively.His quarterback, Shedeur Sanders, made an equally significant mark. Often compared to top NFL talents, Sanders threw for 4,134 yards and 37 touchdowns in 2024, cementing his status as one of the top quarterbacks in the nation. Despite some variance in draft stock discussions, he's widely projected as the No. 2 QB in the class behind Cam Ward and has reportedly drawn strong interest from teams like the New York Giants and New Orleans Saints. The Pittsburgh Steelers, picking at No. 21, are also said to be in the mix.Both Sanders and Hunter are expected to be first-round picks in the upcoming NFL Draft , with Hunter potentially going in the top three. The Cleveland Browns have reportedly shown interest in the versatile Hunter, underscoring just how coveted he has become.With their jersey retirement , Shedeur Sanders and Travis Hunter join a revered group of Buffaloes legends—Byron White (No. 24), Joe Romig (No. 67), Bobby Anderson (No. 11), and Rashaan Salaam (No. 19). Notably, Salaam and Hunter now stand alone as the only Heisman winners in Colorado’s storied history.Also Read: ""He will be the death of me"": Joe Burrow steals the spotlight at Sam Hubbard’s wedding as a clip of him goes viral and fans are going crazy over it",Shedeur sanders and travis hunter will be immortalized in colorado buffaloes history as their jersey numbers are retired.

Chiefs' Christmas wish may go ungranted as NFL hesitates on making it a tradition



NFL and Buffalo Bills schedule hints and predictions with Broadcast VP | Always Gameday in Buffalo

The Kansas City Chiefs have become an integral part of the NFL Christmas Day game schedule over the past two years, thrilling fans with high-profile matchups during the holiday season. As the NFL continues to expand its holiday presence—once dominated by the NBA—Kansas City has made it known they want to be the league’s go-to team for December 25 games. However, the NFL seems reluctant to solidify any such tradition just yet.Much like how the Detroit Lions and Dallas Cowboys have long-standing Thanksgiving game traditions, the Chiefs recently submitted a formal request to the NFL, expressing interest in becoming a permanent host team on Christmas Day. The logic is simple: Kansas City is arguably the league’s most marketable franchise at the moment. Between their dominance on the field—frequenting Super Bowls—and the off-field buzz created by stars like Travis Kelce and his high-profile relationship with Taylor Swift, the Chiefs are ratings gold.Yet, despite the appeal, the NFL is not ready to tie itself to one team. On the “It’s Always Gameday in Buffalo” podcast, Mike North, the NFL’s Vice President of Broadcast Planning and Scheduling, addressed the Chiefs' request and explained the league’s stance.“For a team like the Chiefs to volunteer for Christmas while they’re busy winning every other Super Bowl or whatever it is, and their tight end is dating the biggest pop star on the planet, sure, the league office would love for the Chiefs to host every year, thanks for volunteering, boys,” North said.“I’m not sure that’s gonna become a tradition quite the way Thanksgiving is. Think about what it took for that tradition, right? The Lions since the ‘30s, the Cowboys since the ‘60s,” North said. “We didn’t commit to a third site on Thanksgiving when we brought that back about 20 years ago. We’ve rotated that around. I imagine we’re gonna keep rotating Christmas around too.”The NFL's cautious approach is rooted in its desire to remain agile. Committing to a team for annual holiday games requires considering both short-term popularity and long-term viability. While the Chiefs are currently a juggernaut, North highlighted that the future is unpredictable.“I know the Chiefs are raising their hands supposedly, but that’s a lot to ask your fans to come out every year on Christmas,” North said. “Certainly, while you’re good and you’re winning AFC West titles and fighting for Super Bowl, it’s an easy give. Five years from now, after Patrick Mahomes retires and they’re not the perennial champion and in every AFC Championship game, I’m not sure we’d want to be married to a site. There are other teams that have raised their hands to become permanent hosts of things like Black Friday or Christmas, thus far we’ve avoided to committing to something like that.”This year, the NFL is upping the ante with a Christmas Day tripleheader, split between Netflix and Amazon. Kansas City featured in the past two Christmas slates—losing to the Raiders at home in 2023, and bouncing back with a dominant 29-10 win over the Steelers in Pittsburgh last year. But despite their consistent appearances and undeniable entertainment value, they are not guaranteed a repeat slot.As the NFL prepares to release its official schedule post-draft, fans of the Kansas City Chiefs will be watching closely. Will the reigning AFC powerhouse get the holiday spotlight once again? While the league remains non-committal, one thing is clear: the Chiefs are eager to make Christmas football a Kansas City tradition. Whether the NFL allows it to happen remains a storyline to follow in seasons to come.Also Read: Jayden Daniels' dance with mom Regina Jackson steals spotlight at Brandon Aiyuk’s wedding","The kansas city chiefs have become an integral part of the nfl christmas day game schedule over the past two years.

Did Aaron Rodgers just get rejected by the Vikings?

Aaron Rodgers’ bold pitch: mentor J.J McCarthy, chase a ring

Steelers show interest, but no deal yet

Is the NFL moving on from its aging icons?

Aaron Rodgers is no stranger to headline-making decisions, but this offseason is shaping up to be one of the most unpredictable chapters of his storied career. Over a month into NFL free agency, the former Green Bay Packers and New York Jets quarterback remains unsigned — and his recent attempt to land with the Minnesota Vikings didn’t go as planned.According to sources close to the situation, Rodgers had his eyes set on joining the Vikings, a move that would have sent shockwaves through the NFC North. His plan? Serve as a mentor to the team’s young quarterback J.J. McCarthy while also leading a potential Super Bowl push. It was a strategic pitch — pairing his veteran leadership with the raw talent of a rookie in hopes of a deep playoff run.But the Vikings declined.Minnesota is choosing to go all-in on McCarthy, signaling confidence in the 2024 draft pick’s potential to grow into their long-term franchise QB. Rather than splitting the leadership or slowing McCarthy’s development, the Vikings opted to build around youth — a decision that many believe speaks volumes about the league’s shifting priorities.With the Vikings off the table, the Pittsburgh Steelers appear to be the only team showing serious interest in Rodgers. Still, no deal has materialized. The hesitation may be due to Rodgers’ injury history, high salary demands, or teams prioritizing long-term quarterback development over short-term wins.Rodgers, who threw for 3,897 yards and 28 touchdowns last season, clearly still has gas left in the tank. But at 41, he’s entering a market that seems more hesitant than ever to invest in aging superstars.The Vikings’ decision may mark a turning point in how NFL teams view older quarterbacks. Rather than chasing quick success with veterans, franchises are increasingly focusing on grooming young talent. It’s a tough reality for Rodgers, whose resume includes four MVPs and a Super Bowl title — but no current job.As the draft approaches and team strategies evolve, Rodgers could still find a landing spot. But for now, his future hangs in the balance, and one thing is clear: the league may be ready to move on, even if Rodgers isn’t.Also Read: New York Jets shock the NFL by cutting Aaron Rodgers and doubling down on Allen Lazard with $11M deal","Aaron rodgers is still unsigned over a month into nfl free agency.

In 2023, Taylor Swift had confessed the trauma she went through because of Kanye West and Kim Kardashian



Kanye West is again back to targeting Taylor Swift



Taylor Swift and Kanye West have had a pretty complicated bond since their feud began in 2009. While both Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce have kept themselves away from issuing any public statements, the billionaire pop star had admitted how much she had suffered previously because of Kanye West and his ex wife, famous socialite Kim Kardashian.In 2016, Taylor Swift found herself mentioned in Kanye West’s song, Famous, which became a huge hit. Kanye West had spoken about how Taylor Swift had consented to the rap about her which read as, “I feel like me and Taylor might still have s*x. Why? I made that b*tch famous (God damn) I made that b*tch famous”.This had gotten Kanye West brutally trolled but his ex wife Kim Kardashian had come to his rescue. The famous socialite and founder of SKIMS released the phone call recording between the pop star and Kanye West where it seemed like Taylor Swift had consented to being mentioned in his song.But later, it was found out that the released tape of their phone call was heavily edited.In 2023, in an interview with TIME, Taylor Swift spoke about the aftereffects and the trauma she went through because of Kim Kardashian and Kanye West.Taylor Swift said, “Make no mistake — my career was taken away from me. That took me down psychologically to a place I’ve never been before.”The billionaire pop star added, “You have a fully manufactured frame job, in an illegally recorded phone call, which Kim Kardashian edited and then put out to say to everyone that I was a liar.”She continued, “I moved to a foreign country. I didn’t leave a rental house for a year…I pushed away most people in my life because I didn’t trust anyone anymore. I went down really, really hard.”Nine years after that infamous phone call between Kanye West and Taylor Swift, the rapper again targetted the pop sensation.A few days ago he made sexually explicit posts about Taylor Swift’s life and even implied that Justin Bieber and Harry Styles have had s*x with Taylor.Kanye West also expressed a desire to have s*x with Taylor Swift as in one of the now deleted posts he had written, “IM MAD I HAVENT F***ED TAYLOR SWIFT … YET.”But Taylor Swift’s fans have not held back and has brutally trolled the famous rapper. As per Daily Mail, Travis Kelce wants to confront Kanye West and have a “man to man” conversation about this.For now, neither Taylor Swift nor her team has officially reacted to this.Also Read: “She ended him”: Taylor Swift didn’t respond to Kanye West but fans think she shut him down back in 2024","Taylor swift and kanye west have had a complicated bond since their feud began in 2009.

JD Vance mishandles Buckeyes’ championship trophy during White House event



JD Vance fumbles college football championship trophy as Ohio State visits White House

Vice President JD Vance stole the spotlight on Monday — not just for his speech, but for a slip-up that instantly went viral. While honoring the Ohio State Buckeyes ' national championship win on the White House South Lawn, Vance, a proud alumnus of the university, accidentally dropped the College Football Playoff’s national championship trophy in front of a crowd that included the team, President Donald Trump, and members of the media.The moment occurred as the ceremony drew to a close. In an enthusiastic gesture, Vance attempted to lift the impressive 3-foot trophy from a table onstage. TreVeyon Henderson, Ohio State’s standout running back, assisted by holding the top while Vance took the base. However, the trophy, a modular piece consisting of a 26.5-inch ""ascending virtual football"" made of 24-karat gold and stainless steel atop a 12-inch bronze base, unexpectedly split apart — and the base dropped with a loud thud.Gasps and laughter rippled through the audience as Henderson and another player managed to hold onto the top half of the trophy. Quick to recover from the embarrassing mishap, Vance picked up the base and later joined head coach Ryan Day in posing with the gleaming upper portion of the prize.True to form, the Vice President laughed off the incident online, quipping, “I didn’t want anyone after Ohio State to get the trophy so I decided to break it.” The moment, shared across social platforms, drew chuckles and headlines, and even drew comparisons to other infamous trophy blunders in sports history — from Maria Sharapova’s U.S. Open trophy toppling off in 2006 to Real Madrid's bus runover of the Copa del Rey in 2011.Despite the awkward turn, the event itself was filled with pride and celebration. Vance, who graduated from Ohio State in 2009 with a degree in philosophy and political science, welcomed the team alongside President Trump. The Buckeyes presented both with custom helmets and jerseys, adding a personal touch to their White House victory lap.As the U.S. Marine Band played “We Are the Champions,” the spirit of celebration never wavered — even if the trophy didn’t stay in one piece. The gaffe may have been unexpected, but it underscored JD Vance’s light-hearted persona, making the Vice President’s trophy fumble a uniquely memorable highlight of an already historic day.Also Read: “Coming soon”: With wedding bells in the air, Hailee Steinfeld’s cryptic post has fans guessing what's next","Ohio state vice president jd vance accidentally dropped the college football championship trophy.

Now, with a $240 million contract on his shoulders and a legacy hanging in the balance, all eyes are on Prescott’s road to recovery and the Cowboys’ 2025 future.Prescott’s injury wasn’t your average muscle tweak. Diagnosed with a partial hamstring avulsion, a severe condition where the tendon detaches from the bone, the quarterback was ruled out for the rest of the 2024 season. The aftermath left Dallas scrambling, as backups Cooper Rush and Trey Lance tried (and failed) to steer the ship, leading the team to a disappointing 7-10 finish.Fast forward to the offseason, and the 32-year-old signal caller is inching closer to full strength. But he’s not rushing the process.Prescott revealed.This cautious yet confident approach shows Prescott is prioritizing longevity over bravado. And considering his injury history including a devastating ankle fracture in 2020 and calf and thumb issues in following seasons, he has every reason to tread carefully.Rehab has been intense, with a focus on restoring the mobility that made him a dual-threat quarterback. Running, agility drills, and controlled scrambles have been key as he works to regain form without risking reinjury.Prescott’s return isn’t just a comeback, it’s a high-stakes gamble for the Cowboys. His blockbuster four-year, $240 million contract extension, which includes a record-setting $231 million guaranteed, has put him at the heart of the franchise's future.If he returns to form, Dallas could re-emerge as a powerhouse in the NFC East. But if injuries continue to haunt him, the Cowboys could be staring at yet another lost season and serious questions about their long-term direction.Also Read: Jalen Ramsey trade rumors: Could Dolphins cornerback be on the move in 2025?

Dak Prescott’s redemption tour is loading and the NFL better be ready.","Dak prescott has been ruled out for the rest of the 2024 season with a hamstring injury.

Juan Soto opens up on his performance during the 2025 MLB season

“It’s definitely different. I had the best hitter in baseball hitting behind me. I was getting more attacked and more pitches in the strike zone, less intentional walks and things like that. I was pitched differently last year.”

Juan Soto's second homer as a member of the Mets!

“There’s probably some validity to what Soto told Puma about things being ’‘different’—meaning more difficult — without the great Aaron Judge’s lineup protection. But this isn’t the time for that. There may never be a good time for that. But this definitely is not it. When Soto made the comments, before finally homering in Monday’s 5-1 win in Minnesota, he was 15 games into a 15-year commitment.”

After Juan Soto took the exit door from the New York Yankees and joined hands with the Mets during the off-season, he created waves in the MLB world with his $765 million contract. After bagging the biggest deal in the history of the major league, the expectations of the Dominican star skyrocketed. During his debut game with the New York Mets , Soto witnessed a slow start in comparison to what was expected from him and was even subjected to criticism not only from MLB insiders but also from the netizens. Recently, Juan Soto broke his silence on a slow start during the 2025 MLB season.Juan Soto’s start with the New York Mets isn’t that bad, as he not only went on to make 70 plate appearances but also secured a home run under his name against the Minnesota Twins recently. According to a recent update provided by the reputed media outlet The New York Post’s writer Mike Puma, Juan Soto had to face more difficulties during his stint with the Mets in comparison to his time with the New York Yankees along with Aaron Judge . Soto mentionedMLB insider Jon Heyman even reacted to Juan Soto’s statement and even pointed out the protection provided by the Yankees captain Aaron Judge. He said-However, a few games into the 2025 MLB season cannot decide the trajectory of an athlete’s career. With the hype around Juan Soto, undoubtedly the former Yankees star is not only struggling with the expectations of his fans but also the criticism that comes along with being in the spotlight.Also Read: Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani steals the show with walk-off homer leading to franchise record","“was pitched differently last year”- mets’ star juan soto breaks his silence on slow start during 2025 mlb season.
