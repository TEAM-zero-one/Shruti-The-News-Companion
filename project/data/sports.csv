NEW DELHI: Former England captains Michael Atherton and Nasser Hussain are in awe of Virat Kohli 's impressive ODI statistics and think the Indian mainstay is likely the greatest batsman in the history of the sport.In a Champions Trophy encounter in Dubai on Sunday, Kohli led India to a resounding six-wicket victory over bitter rivals Pakistan with a masterful performance of unbroken 100, his 51st century in ODIs.""Virat Kohli in a run-chase in 50-over cricket, there's been nobody better in the history of the game, really. 51 century is an unbelievable number,"" said the 56-year-old Atherton, who captained England in 54 Test matches, on 'Sky Sports Cricket Podcast'.Kohli joined the select company of Sachin Tendulkar (18,426 in 452 innings) and Kumar Sangakkara (14,234 in 380 innings) as the fastest batter to reach 14,000 ODI runs while en route to his century in his 299th 50-over outing.""I mean, he's got 51 and he passed 14,000 runs, which only Tendulkar and Sangakkara have got past that mark in one-day cricket,"" Atherton continued.""And he got them in 60-odd innings quicker than Sachin, and I think about 90-odd innings quicker than Kumar.""So, I mean, ODI is probably his best. You know, he's been a great all-format player, clearly, but you'd probably say that ODI is his absolute best format.""Hussain, England captain from 1999 to 2003, echoed similar remarks saying, ""He's been an incredible player. Yeah, and you'd have to say probably the best player in ODIs of all time, really, with those stats you mentioned.""You'd have Tendulkar in the same conversation. Kumar, you'd have AB de Villiers . They've been some great ones, but he's right at the top of the tree.""",Former england captains michael atherton and nasser hussain are in awe of virat kohli's impressive odi statistics. The pair think the indian mainstay is likely the greatest batsman in the history of the sport. Kohli led india to a resounding six-wicket victory over bitter rivals pakistan.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118550382,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-49914,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

“Annoying dealing with the media”: Elias Pettersson delivers fiery response to the media after Vancouver Canucks' consecutive losses,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/annoying-dealing-with-the-media-elias-pettersson-delivers-fiery-response-to-the-media-after-vancouver-canucks-consecutive-losses/articleshow/118551965.cms,"Image via Getty Images

Elias Pettersson’s performance falls short after major extension



The Vancouver Canucks are facing a significant drop in the 2024-25 NHL season, with Elias Pettersson 's lackluster year being a major factor in their inefficiency. However, Pettersson has grown tired of the constant questioning and is determined to step up consistently.Pettersson recently acknowledged his struggles with a blunt response, showing both frustration and determination as he works to improve during the Canucks’ tough season.Elias Pettersson, who signed an eight-year, $92.8 million contract extension in March 2024, has not lived up to expectations this season. Through 34 games, he has recorded just 10 goals and 18 assists (28 points), a significant dip compared to his usual output. His struggles have raised concerns, especially as the team looks to remain competitive in the playoff race.“It’s more annoying dealing with the media,” Canucks forward Elias Pettersson said, following a question from a Sportsnet reporter about confidence influencing scoring issues.The distractions surrounding the locker room have clearly impacted Pettersson’s performance, and Rick Tocchet ,head coach of Vancouver Canucks, hopes to see his star player regain confidence. Tocchet has observed Pettersson hesitating and overanalyzing his decisions on the ice.“I think he’s waiting for something. I don’t know if it’s a lack of confidence in his shot, but as soon as he has room, he’s got to take it and just got to blast it,” Rick Tocchet admitted after the 2-1 loss at Utah, via Sportsnet. “I’d rather him just rip a puck right now. He’s not moving his feet. I thought today, some shifts he was moving his feet and it looked like we had some glimpses. I don’t know if it’s a mental block right now, all year, but he’s got to move his feet.”With the March 7 trade deadline nearing, speculation about Pettersson’s future is growing. Analysts debate whether the Canucks should trade him for less than his value or keep him, hoping for a rebound.Also Read: Anaheim Ducks' Trevor Zegras suspended for 3 games without pay for interference on Detroit Red Wings' Michael Rasmussen Despite his scoring slump, Pettersson excels defensively, leading forwards with 237 defensive plays and 164 blocked passes, highlighting his two-way impact. As the Canucks push through the second half of the season, Pettersson's performance will be crucial in determining the team’s success and his long-term future with the franchise.","Elias pettersson signed an eight-year, $92.8 million contract extension in march 2024.

Justin Tucker’s sexual misconduct allegations spark debate over equal treatment with Browns' Deshaun Watson,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/justin-tuckers-sexual-misconduct-allegations-spark-debate-over-equal-treatment-with-browns-deshaun-watson/articleshow/118562550.cms,"Image via Ric Tapia/Getty Images

Fans Question Why Is Justin Tucker Not Being Treated Like Deshaun Watson When He Was Accused Of Similar Sexual Misconduct Charges



Justin Tucker Has Denied All The Sexual Misconduct Allegations That He Has Been Accused Of



Justin Tucker, the star player of the Baltimore Ravens, has found himself in a huge controversy after massage therapists working at luxury spas accused him of inappropriate sexual behaviour, as per The Baltimore Banner. The Baltimore Banner reports that as many as sixteen women have accused the player of sexual misconduct and this seems like a flashback to when the Cleveland Browns’ Deshaun Watson was accused of a similar crime a few years back. Fans have questions about how the Justin Tucker situation is being handled as compared to Deshaun Watson’s.A fan took to X and wrote, “I’m still waiting on the world and sports media to drag Justin Tucker as they did Deshawn Watson keep that same energy!”, while another fan wrote, “Why is this not on the news like Deshawn Watson was. Deshawn was on national and local news on the reg. Why is Justin Tucker not being talked about more on national, local news and social media? Maybe he kept missing them field goals cause he was too ‘relaxed’ 🤷🏽‍♂️”A third fan wrote, “the fact the nfl allowed deshawn watson continue playing football is disturbing. now you’ve got justin tucker who has allegations that are getting near deshawn’s numbers. what number of women will be enough?”In 2021, Deshaun Watson was accused by more than twenty massage therapists of inappropriate sexual misconduct. It caused a huge uproar on social media and became a topic for debate. At that point in time, Deshaun Watson was playing for the Houston Texans.While his contract with the Houston Texans was not officially terminated, he did not play in any of the matches during the 2021 season of the NFL.By 2022, Deshaun Watson was traded to the Cleveland Browns but he was suspended for the first 11 matches during the 2022 season of the NFL and was fined a whopping $5 million. By November 2022, he was back to playing for the Cleveland Browns.The accusations against Deshaun Watson are oddly similar to the accusations against Baltimore Ravens’ Justin Tucker. After the women approached The Baltimore Banner with their story, Justin Tucker issued a statement regarding the controversy and denied all the allegations levied against him.In a social media statement, Justin Tucker said, “In accusing me of misconduct, the article takes innocuous, or ambiguous, interactions and skews them so out of proportion they are no longer recognizable, and it presents vague insinuations as fact. This is desperate tabloid fodder.”As per The Baltimore Banner, the NFL has started their investigations into the matter and is interviewing the women who have accused the Baltimore Ravens’ player.Also Read: Travis Kelce breaks his social media silence amid Taylor Swift's follower drop and gives fans hope","Justin tucker, the star player of the baltimore ravens, has found himself in a huge controversy after massage therapists working at luxury spas accused him of inappropriate sexual behaviour.

Vikings plan to reduce Aaron Jones’ playing time if he returns

The Minnesota Vikings are considering limiting the heavy use of veteran Aaron Jones , who set career highs in touches, carries, and offensive snaps in his first season. Despite injuries, Jones managed to play all 18 games and had the most rushing yards and second-most yards from scrimmage in his career. As he approaches free agency at 30, the Vikings plan to reduce his playing time if he returns.Aaron Jones signed a one-year contract with the Minnesota Vikings on March 12, 2024. In Week 12, he had 22 carries for 106 yards and a touchdown against the Chicago Bears. In 2024, he had 255 carries, 1,138 rushing yards, five rushing touchdowns, and 51 receptions for 408 yards and two touchdowns.""The big thing for me is we loved having Aaron Jones, the impact he had,"" coach Kevin O'Connell told SiriusXM earlier this month. ""For the better part of his career, he had kind of been a part of backfield committees, but for the most part, Aaron Jones was the feature back [in 2024]. ... So I would love to have Aaron back. And then we just continue to grow in that room, whether it's infusing a young player in the draft or maybe another player in free agency alongside Aaron Jones, hopefully.""O'Connell's vision for the 2024 season was evident in a Week 1 victory over the New York Giants, where quarterback Ryan Jones played 52% of snaps and carried the ball 14 times for 94 yards and a touchdown. However, the Vikings lost faith in Chandler and Jones became more of an every-down player, playing 63% of offensive snaps and taking 67% of carries by running backs.Aaron Jones expressed his desire to return to Minnesota in 2025, following the Vikings' wild-card loss to the Los Angeles Rams. ""We'll see how it plays out,"" he added, ""but this is where I want to be."" Jones, despite being best suited for rotational roles, is a top option in a presumptive free agent class alongside Najee Harris, J.K. Dobbins, Rico Dowdle, Javonte Williams, and Akers. His $7 million contract ranked 14th among running backs in average per year, and he could attract multiple suitors.Also read: Former New York Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers has shared two key qualities he is seeking in his next team ESPN's Field Yates ranks Boise State's Ashton Jeanty, Iowa's Kaleb Johnson, North Carolina's Omarion Hampton, Ohio State's TreVeyon Henderson, and Georgia's Trevor Etienne as the top five available running backs in the draft, with the Vikings having the lowest total draft capital in the NFL.","Vikings plan to reduce aaron jones’ playing time if he returns.

The Rock's return and recent confrontation with Cody Rhodes on SmackDown has possibly changed the trajectory of the road to WrestleMania 41.The road to WrestleMania 41 took a surprising turn with the return of The Final Boss, The Rock, on the February 21st edition of SmackDown. He made the announcement a day before the show and teased what the fans could expect from his shocking re-emergence.The Final came back to SmackDown, taking place in New Orleans, Louisiana, first to deliver the big gift he teased by announcing that the city will be the host to WrestleMania 42 next year. Right after, he called out the WWE Champion, Cody Rhodes. The American Nightmare came down to the ring and embraced The Rock in a show of respect.The Rock revealed that he had a deep respect for Cody Rhodes' remarkable reign as champion and his rise as the face of WWE. Witnessing that, The Final Boss made an offer to Cody to become ""his champion.""

Cody Rhodes is set to deliver his answer to The Rock at the WWE Elimination Chamber 2025 event.During the segment, Cody Rhodes said that he was the champion of fans but still did not give a nod of refusal to The Rock's offer. Regardless, their confrontation reignited the conversation of a match between The Rock and Cody Rhodes at WrestleMania 41. These were the early plans for the show, but it was reportedly dropped after The Rock said that he would not be available to wrestle.Moreover, it has already been announced that the winner of the Men's Elimination Chamber will face Cody Rhodes for the Undisputed WWE Championship at WrestleMania 41. While the match seems very unlikely, it does not rule out the fact that The Rock can be involved in some capacity in the title picture at The Show of Shows.Should Cody Rhodes refuse his offer at the Elimination Chamber, The Rock could use his power as a TKO Board member to extend the same offer to another star and insert him into the WWE title. Moreover, another scenario can see The Rock and Cody Rhodes shockingly joining hands at the show, in a similar scenario to Steve Austin siding with his rival, Vince McMahon.

Houston Rockets injury report for tonight’s game against the Milwaukee Bucks (February 25, 2025)

When and where to watch the Milwaukee Bucks play tonight against the Houston Rockets (February 25, 2025)?

Theare gearing up for a crucial matchup against the Houston Rockets on Tuesday, February 25, at the Toyota Center, but all eyes are on’s injury status. The two-time MVP is listed as probable due to a calf issue, raising questions about his availability and potential impact on the game. Giannis Antetokounmpo , who leads the Bucks with 31.0 points and 12.0 rebounds per game, has been a cornerstone of Milwaukee’s success this season. His probable status suggests he is likely to suit up, but the calf injury could limit his minutes or effectiveness. The Bucks, currently 32-24, will need their star at full strength to counter a Rockets team that boasts a strong defensive record, allowing just 109.0 points per game (fifth in the NBA).The injury report also highlights other key absences for Milwaukee. Pat Connaughton remains out with a calf injury, while Gary Trent Jr. is probable with a knee issue. These setbacks could test the Bucks’ depth, especially against a Rockets squad that has been dominant on the boards, leading the league with 47.9 rebounds per game.For Houston, injuries are also a concern. Fred VanVleet (ankle), Jae’Sean Tate (back), and Dillon Brooks (illness) are all questionable, while Cody Zeller is out for personal reasons. Despite these challenges, the Rockets have been formidable, outscoring opponents by 3.9 points per game, thanks in large part to Jalen Green’s team-leading 21.5 points per game.The Bucks, however, have their own strengths. They rank 12th in the NBA in scoring (114.2 points per game) and sixth in three-pointers made (14.4 per game), with Damian Lillard contributing 3.5 threes per contest. Giannis Antetokounmpo’s presence will be critical in maintaining this offensive rhythm, especially against a Rockets defense that has been stingy all season.Also read: Will Kevin Durant play tonight against the Memphis Grizzlies? Latest update on the Phoenix Suns star's injury report (February 25, 2025) As tip-off approaches, the Bucks’ medical staff will likely monitor Antetokounmpo’s condition closely.

Warriors’ star player Stephen Curry also hailed the management’s decision to acquire the former Heat star.""There's a sense of urgency just because you're not going to be able to do it at this level forever. We talked about that pre-trade, which is why Jimmy is here, and we all love the expectations, we love playing for something meaningful, and the only energy you're putting out there is to try and get it done. That's it. We're in a moment where we still can win.""Also Read: Did Jimmy Butler Take a Dig at Miami Heat?

Taylor Swift has been sacked from Instagram after being booed at the Super Bowl

Taylor Swift has been facing backlash from Instagram after being booed at the Super Bowl, according to SportsMillions.

Some fans were excited to see her, while others expressed frustration, particularly those who disagree with her political stances. Some speculate it stems from her growing political influence.Alexis Winters, a member of the New York Young Republican Club, attributed the decrease in followers to a broader sentiment among certain conservative fans. ""We are tired of celebrities calling down to us from their ivory towers, giving their two cents on policies that will never impact them,"" Winters stated.She further added, ""Taylor Swift is simply the best example of this, and her loss of hundreds of thousands of Instagram followers represents the hundreds of thousands of Americans who chose their president over the woke Hollywood mob.""While Taylor Swift's Instagram followers declined, Kelce gained over 12,370 followers after the Super Bowl, according to Social Blade tracking. Some fans argue that Swift's criticism is unfair, especially when compared to Kelce's reception.

""When Travis made an appearance on the Eras Tour, Swifties were excited to see him and cheered him on. When Taylor was shown on the Jumbotron, she was booed,"" Piwowarczyk noted.
