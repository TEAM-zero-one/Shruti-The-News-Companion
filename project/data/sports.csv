Washington Sundar on X (Screengrab)

Poll What do you think was the key factor in India's remarkable draw at Old Trafford? Washington Sundar's performance Ravindra Jadeja's contribution Team's ability to absorb pressure England's missed opportunities

“Grateful for the people, and forever grateful to you, God,” wrote Washington Sundar on X after scoring his maiden Test hundred — a composed, unbeaten 101* that helped India pull off a dramatic draw against England in the fourth Test at Old Trafford.The 25-year-old all-rounder’s quiet gratitude came after a loud statement on the field, where he and Ravindra Jadeja (107) batted through the final phase of Day 5 to rescue India from what once looked like certain defeat. Reduced to 0/2 at the start of their second innings, India needed a miracle. They found it in the form of a rock-solid batting effort, with Shubman Gill (103) and KL Rahul (90) also playing key roles.The final session was filled with tension — England’s frustration began to show, especially after Jadeja launched a six off Harry Brook to reach his hundred. In a curious moment, Brook stepped forward with a handshake offer, seemingly looking to wrap up the game.But Sundar , just short of his own milestone, ignored the gesture and carried on. The image of Brook’s puzzled smile and Sundar’s calm focus summed up the psychological edge India held at the end.This was just the second draw for England in 40 Tests under Ben Stokes and Brendon McCullum, which was a rare occurrence in their aggressive ‘Bazball’ era. But it was a deserved result for India, whose batters absorbed immense pressure to ensure the series stays alive at 2-1.With the possibility of leveling the series still on the line, the stage is set for a cracking finale at The Oval. But for now, Sundar’s words and his resolve linger as the high point of a chaotic final day.",Washington sundar scored 101* to help india draw 4th test at old trafford.

NHL Trade Rumors: Nazem Kadri could join Montreal Canadiens after Toronto Maple Leafs blocked by Calgary Flames,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/nhl-trade-rumors-nazem-kadri-could-join-montreal-canadiens-after-toronto-maple-leafs-blocked-by-calgary-flames/articleshow/122983328.cms,"Bill Wippert/Getty

Calgary Flames shut door on Toronto Maple Leafs, Nazem Kadri eyes Montreal Canadiens as realistic trade option

Montreal Canadiens could land reliable veteran Nazem Kadri with proven scoring punch and leadership

FAQs:

1. How many Stanley Cups has Nazem Kadri won?

2. When was Nazem Kadri drafted and by which team?

Nazem Kadri may be headed back to the Eastern Conference, and the Montreal Canadiens could be the front-runners. With Calgary reportedly refusing to negotiate any trades with the Toronto Maple Leafs, Kadri’s list of potential destinations has effectively narrowed to just one team. Given his consistent production and Montreal’s need for veteran help up the middle, this could be a perfect short-term fit. His playoff experience, leadership qualities, and gritty playing style could also provide the young Canadiens roster with a much-needed edge as they continue their rebuild.Nazem Kadri is reportedly open to a trade to either the Montreal Canadiens or his former team, the Toronto Maple Leafs. However, with Calgary Flames management unwilling to make a deal with Toronto, still harboring friction from Brad Treliving’s tenure as Flames GM that path appears closed.Sportsnet’s Nick Kypreos reported that Treliving has previously tried to acquire players like Chris Tanev, Nikita Zadorov, and Rasmus Andersson from Calgary, but has been shut down at every turn. That history makes it highly unlikely that the Flames would greenlight any trade that sends Kadri back to the Maple Leafs.This leaves the Canadiens as the only viable trade destination Kadri would reportedly consider. Montreal’s growing core, including top prospect Ivan Demidov and head coach Martin St. Louis’ high-skill system could make the Canadiens an appealing spot for the 34-year-old centerman.Kadri is coming off back-to-back seasons of 67 and 75 points, playing a full 82 games in both campaigns. He has tallied 710 points in 985 NHL games and once posted a 100-point pace during the 2021–22 season with Colorado. At 6-foot and 185 pounds, Kadri brings experience, physicality, and versatility to any middle-six unit.With Montreal’s top prospect Michael Hage still developing, Kadri could be a strong short-term option to stabilize the Canadiens' second line alongside Demidov. His leadership and playoff pedigree would be especially valuable to a young team looking to take the next step.If Calgary refuses to deal with Toronto, the road is clear for the Montreal Canadiens to pursue Nazem Kadri. Given his proven scoring ability and desire for a fresh start, a move to Montreal could benefit both sides, if the price is right. As trade rumors heat up, the Canadiens may quietly be positioning themselves for a bold veteran addition.Kadri won one Stanley Cup with the Colorado Avalanche during the 2021–22 NHL season.Kadri was drafted 7th overall by the Toronto Maple Leafs in the 2009 NHL Draft.Also Read: NHL Trade Rumors: Kyle Connor likely to re-sign as Winnipeg Jets pursue long-term contract extension amid NHL free agency buzz","Nazem kadri is reportedly open to a trade to either the montreal canadiens or his former team, the toronto maple leafs.

Kader Kohou’s season-ending injury hits hard for a defense already under rebuild pressure

Mike McDaniel finds hope in Kader Kohou’s mindset: “This is tough, but I guarantee I’m going to come back better.”

Ashtyn Davis’ scare adds to Dolphins’ stress, but McDaniel says “it wasn’t the worst.”

FAQs

Q1: How did Kader Kohou get injured?

Q2: What’s the update on Ashtyn Davis?

Q3: Who replaces Kohou in the lineup?

The Miami Dolphins’ defense suffered a heartbreaking blow as cornerback Kader Kohou is now ruled out for the entire 2025 NFL season. He injured his knee during one-on-one drills Saturday and was helped off the field by medical staff. Just days later, safety Ashtyn Davis went down with a leg injury during Tuesday’s practice. While Davis is not out for the year, the back-to-back injuries have rattled the team ahead of preseason.This wasn’t just another injury — it was Miami’s top nickel corner going down just as the defense was finding its new identity. Kohou was the lone returning starter in a reshuffled secondary and had looked sharp in early camp. His injury happened quickly during drills and left teammates visibly shaken. Coach Mike McDaniel confirmed Wednesday that he’ll be placed on injured reserve.“I saw him ascend to a different level this offseason,” McDaniel told reporters. “The timing of it — I was crushed until I talked to Kader.” Kohou, who entered the league as an undrafted free agent in 2022, had earned every inch of his starting role. Losing him just as he was peaking made the news all the more difficult for the team to absorb.McDaniel’s tone was emotional, not just as a coach, but as someone who clearly respects Kohou as a person. “Kader made me feel a little bit better, simply by his mindset,” he said. “You don’t know the whys all the time when things happen… Kader’s mindset triggered like that, to where he said, ‘This is tough, but I guarantee I’m going to come back better.’” That resilience is what sticks.Miami wasted no time reacting — signing veteran cornerback Mike Hilton shortly after the injury. Hilton brings playoff experience from the Bengals and will help steady a shaken secondary. But truthfully, no one on the depth chart can fully replace Kohou’s grit or leadership. The locker room felt the loss — and it wasn’t just about Xs and Os.Then came Tuesday, and more bad news. Safety Ashtyn Davis suffered a left leg injury during practice and stayed down, punching the turf in frustration. Minutes later, he was seen on crutches and wearing a walking boot. That kind of scene never goes unnoticed at training camp — teammates looked stunned.Thankfully, Coach McDaniel later said the news wasn’t catastrophic. “It wasn’t the worst,” he shared. Davis will be reevaluated in the coming days, and there’s hope he’ll return before long. But paired with Kohou’s injury, it’s clear this wasn’t the camp Miami had planned. They’re already being tested — mentally and physically — before the season has even begun.Also read: Inside the NFL’s preseason paychecks: How players earn, endure, and push toward the roster Kohou hurt his knee during one-on-one drills at Saturday’s practice and limped off with the team’s medical staff.

Jonathan Kuminga is now a free agent (Image via Instagram / @jonathan_kuminga)

ESPN recently released a detailed report of the current issues between Jonathan Kuminga and his latest team, the Golden State Warriors. This happened after weeks of rumors that the restricted free agent was in talks with several teams regarding possible deals. The team signed the pro NBA player to a four-year rookie deal after drafting him seventh overall in 2021. Now, the team made renewed push to retain Jonathan KumingaThis offseason, the Golden State Warriors have been forced to deal with Jonathan Kuminga who is still in restricted free agency while they try to find a solution. The franchise have undoubtedly been looking into sign-and-trade possibilities for the NBA player, but there aren't many possible suitors for the rookie forward, so Golden State Warriors probably have to just re-sign him in the end.According to ESPN's Shams Charania and Anthony Slater, they made another attempt this week to keep the former seventh-overall choice, but Jonathan Kuminga rejected an offer of $45 million spread over two years.ESPN wrote:""The Golden State Warriors made another push to retain Jonathan Kuminga over the past several days, but the restricted free agent is continuing to decline their two-year, $45 million contract offer, sources told ESPN on Wednesday.”The report continued:""Kuminga's decision is due in large part to the Warriors' insistence on having a team option for the second season and their unwillingness to let him maintain the built-in no-trade clause, sources said.""As per the analysts, the proposal's second year was a team choice, which was a major point of contention during those discussions. Additionally, the Golden State Warriors were not willing to uphold the deal's no-trade condition.The 22-year-old appears more keen on taking an offer away from the Bay Area since he had a disagreement with the team during the 2024–25 season. Since he is a restricted free agent and is said to be seeking a contract for $25–30 million a season, his departure from the Golden State Warriors is not ideal.While the team has provided the pro NBA idol with offers that are below his liking, the analysts further report that the 6’8 forward has received offers of up to $90 million over four years during negotiations with the Sacramento Kings and Phoenix Suns .

NHL goalie Carter Hart reportedly draws interest from Ottawa Senators

NHL continues ban even after Carter Hart, others found not guilty



FAQs



Is Carter Hart cleared to play in the NHL?



Why are the Ottawa Senators interested in Carter Hart?



What happened in the 2018 WJC case?



Are other NHL teams interested in the cleared players?



In a surprising twist following the fallout of the 2018 World Junior Championship sexual assault case, NHL goalie Carter Hart may soon find himself back in contention, but not with the team he was once linked to. With the Edmonton Oilers reportedly uninterested, all signs now point toward another Canadian franchise stepping into the conversation: the Ottawa Senators.Last week, Hart and four other players, Michael McLeod, Alex Formenton, Dillon Dubé, and Cal Foote, were acquitted in the long-running WJC investigation. Despite being found not guilty, the National Hockey League (NHL) deemed the allegations “very disturbing”. It issued an indefinite suspension against all five, rendering them ineligible to play until further review.But in a developing twist, speculation is mounting around the Ottawa Senators making a move. Reports suggest the franchise is monitoring Hart’s situation closely and could extend a contract offer as soon as league permissions allow. Among the five exonerated players, Carter Hart is widely viewed as the most likely to make a successful return to the league.Legal and sports analysts alike believe that the road to reinstatement could open sooner than expected, especially if public and media sentiment shifts in Hart’s favor. His willingness to testify in court may also play a role in rebuilding his professional image.No, the NHL has currently ruled Hart and four other players ineligible, pending further review.Hart is considered the most NHL-ready among the cleared players and may fill Ottawa’s long-standing goaltending gap.Hart and four others were accused in a 2018 assault case but were found not guilty in court this month.Yes, reports suggest that a few NHL teams may be exploring options, particularly for Carter Hart and Michael McLeod.If the Ottawa Senators do make a move, they’ll be betting on both talent and time.

Why Trey Hendrickson’s presence matters for Bengals

Cincinnati Bengals star defensive end Trey Hendrickson has ended his brief training camp holdout, but not without leaving fans and analysts buzzing. After skipping the first week of camp in a push for a contract extension, the All-Pro pass rusher returned with a blunt, four-word message: “Nothing has really changed. ” His statement perfectly captures the ongoing tension between star players seeking security and teams balancing their salary cap.Hendrickson, who turns 31 this season, is coming off a career-best 17.5 sacks, leading the NFL and cementing himself as one of the league’s premier pass rushers. Despite his dominance, he remains without a new long-term deal and is seeking guaranteed money beyond the 2025 season.His brief absence was a clear signal to the Bengals’ front office, yet his return follows a growing NFL trend known as the “hold-in”—where players report to camp to avoid daily fines while still expressing contract frustrations.Quarterback Joe Burrow didn’t sugarcoat the financial side of Hendrickson’s decision to return. “Guys don’t want to get fined… it’s 50K a day. That’s not pennies. That’s probably part of it,” Burrow said, highlighting the NFL’s harsh penalty for holdouts. Burrow also stressed that Hendrickson’s presence is invaluable for team chemistry, even if negotiations remain unsettled.“Whenever you can have a guy like that in the building… it’s good to see his face, good to have his presence.He’s going to play a big part of this team this year.”Trey Hendrickson briefly skipped Bengals training camp to push for a contract extension and secure more guaranteed money beyond the 2025 season.After returning to Bengals camp, Trey Hendrickson said, “Nothing has really changed,” signaling that his contract situation remains unresolved.Joe Burrow said it was good to have Hendrickson’s presence back in the building and noted that avoiding $50,000 daily fines likely influenced his return.For Cincinnati, having Hendrickson back is critical as the team eyes another playoff run. His leadership and relentless pass-rushing ability are cornerstones of Lou Anarumo’s defense. Even without a new deal, his decision to show up prevents further distractions and keeps the Bengals’ locker room focused on football.Also Read: ""I don’t mind adding more""—Brian Flores addresses Vikings’ interest in Christian Wilkins after Raiders release While “Nothing has really changed” on paper, Hendrickson’s quiet return speaks volumes.

Q1. Why did Toronto trade Mitch Marner?

Q2. Which team did Marner join in 2025?

Q3. How long was Mitch Marner with Toronto?

After about a decade in the Maple Leafs jersey, Mitch Marner’s career looks to take quite a dramatic turn as he prepares to skate for the Vegas Golden Knights. While the ride westward is undoubtedly a new and major chapter in his hockey career, it is also one that is very deeply personal to him. The Toronto native, having always grown up dreaming of a Stanley Cup that would be coming home to his place, is now hoping to work through a franchise that, on the other hand, has been hugely successful recently and has emerged as a very strong culture.Mitch Marner's 2025 playtime started with promise, but it soon deteriorated as the Toronto Maple Leafs failed to realize their championship dreams. Despite Marner putting up 13 points in the playoffs, he fell off the radar in Game 7 versus the Florida Panthers, as his side endured a gut-wrenching 6–1 loss, thus inviting all sorts of heavy criticism. Marner was visibly frustrated, even yelling at some teammates on the bench, a sight that only brought home to the powers that be the extent of his anguish as well as the expectations heaped upon him as the hometown hero.Assisting Auston Matthews for a Game 6 goal was a brief flurry of hope that could not revive Toronto's playoff run. Again, as the Leafs stumbled at this same round of the playoffs, Marner's moment in the postseason was overshadowed by an implosion from his teammates.These playoff performances, coupled with pressure from fans and media alike, seemed to spur talk of a new chapter.June 30, 2023: The Maple Leafs pulled off another high-level sign-and-trade. Mitch Marner signed an eight-year, $96 million extension with Toronto before being sent to Vegas in exchange for Nicolas Roy. For Marner, this was more than business, though-it was a welcome chance.He would later figure out why Vegas was absolutely on the top of his list. In Vegas, Marner said the emphasis lay on the winning atmosphere and culture of the team, and hence, in his eyes, there was much more to it than calling it an escape from Toronto's intense glare. There was a real opportunity to be a part of a roster that genuinely has a shot at lifting the Stanley Cup. He also added that, on a personal level, life in his new city suits his young family, so the decision was as much a family one as it was a business one.Also Read: Connor McDavid’s wife Lauren McDavid joins Mark McMorris for the French‑side wedding adventure of Leon Draisaitl and Celeste Desjardins As Mitch Marner turns the page to join the Vegas Golden Knights, he shall take with him the teachings and the legacy of his years in Toronto.

Tom Brady clears the air on rumors of controlling the Las Vegas Raiders’ inner workings

He sees himself as a supportive mentor, not a hands-on decision-maker

Tom Brady’s focus is building culture and letting players and coaches shine

FAQs

1. How much ownership does Tom Brady have in the Raiders?

2. Is Tom Brady involved in Raiders player signings or coaching?

Tom Brady’s minority stake in the Las Vegas Raiders has sparked ongoing rumors about how involved he really is. Many NFL fans believe the former quarterback still pulls strings behind the scenes. His status as a football icon only adds to the suspicion. But Brady is now speaking up—clearly and candidly—about his true role with the team.There’s been a long-running belief that Brady holds quiet power in the Raiders’ front office, but he says that couldn’t be further from the truth. “I think people assume I have more influence than I really do,” he told Front Office Sports. While he does own a five percent stake, it comes without control over roster decisions or coaching calls.“I’m not involved in daily decisions or who’s getting signed,” he explained. His involvement is not about managing contracts, trades, or strategy meetings. That’s left to the official team executives. Brady wants fans to know—he’s not pulling strings behind closed doors.Brady explained that his current role is more about guiding and inspiring than managing. “I feel like I can play a role from 30,000 feet to make sure the players are saying the right thing, the coaches are saying the right thing,” he said.His interest lies in the culture, not in the paperwork.“And I really enjoy that role, and I can play a mentorship role in different ways in a lot of different areas,” he added. It’s not about spotlight or power for him anymore. He finds meaning in uplifting others. That mindset marks a quiet evolution from superstar athlete to off-field leader.Even as a minority owner, Brady said he wants to be part of shaping a winning, respectful environment. “I enjoy the process and the product that happens on the field,” he said, showing his continued emotional tie to the game. But he doesn’t want to interfere with those in the driver’s seat.“There’s certainly business people involved in selling tickets and sponsorships and so forth,” he noted. His goal isn’t to cross into business or sideline authority. Instead, he chooses to watch, encourage, and nudge from a respectful distance. That’s where he feels he can now make the biggest difference.Even as he steps back from the front lines, Brady’s presence is still felt in quieter, lasting ways. He’s no longer drawing up plays or reading defenses—but he’s helping shape a mindset, a standard. From throwing touchdowns to guiding from above, Brady is still in the game—just playing it from a different field now. And for a legend who once thrived under pressure, this quieter chapter may be his most meaningful yet.Also read: “This is tough”: Miami Dolphins CB Kader Kohou out for 2025 NFL season with knee injury, leaving secondary in crisis He holds a five percent minority stake in the franchise, which gives him no control over team operations.No. Brady confirmed he has no say in staff decisions, trades, or roster changes.","Tom brady clears the air on rumors of controlling the las vegas raiders' inner workings.

The Flagg Family Blueprint: How Love, Honesty, and Intentionality Built a Generational Talent

Whenwas selected as the No. 1 overall pick in the 2025 NBA Draft, the basketball world took notice—not just of his elite talent, but of the journey that brought him from a small town in Maine to the sport’s biggest stage. While much of the spotlight now shines on Cooper, his rise can’t be fully understood without recognizing the unwavering influence of his mother, Kelly Flagg. Her unique blend of athletic background, honest parenting, individualized focus, and humor became the foundation for a household built on grit, love, and excellence.Cooper Flagg’s path to stardom didn’t begin on hardwood at Duke or in front of NBA scouts—it started in a gym that felt more like home. Kelly Flagg (née Bowman) wasn’t just a supportive parent; she was a former star herself. At the University of Maine, she led her team to its first-ever NCAA tournament win in 1999 and later earned a spot in the school’s Sports Hall of Fame. Cooper’s father, Ralph, also played college basketball, making the sport a family affair.Their three children—Hunter, Ace, and Cooper—grew up immersed in the game. Basketball wasn’t a hobby; it was woven into their everyday lives.Late-night shooting drills, family court battles, and dinner conversations all revolved around hoops. “I dreamt that my kids would be great basketball players,” Kelly once said with a laugh. “That’s why I married your dad—he was tall. I thought I could get some tall basketball babies. ”But Kelly’s parenting approach wasn’t just about basketball. She believed in raising each of her kids as distinct individuals, tailoring her support to fit their personalities and needs. “I’ve always been intentional about parenting them as individuals,” she explained. “Even though they’re both competitive, their mindsets and approaches are different. So we adjusted how we raised them accordingly.”As both a coach and a mom, Kelly knew when to give tactical advice and when to offer emotional support. Game nights were emotionally taxing—she often felt like she had played every minute alongside Cooper.A central trait that defines Cooper Flagg is his insatiable competitiveness—a fire Kelly helped ignite and stoke from an early age. In the Flagg household, everything was a challenge. “He doesn’t accept anything less than being the best,” Kelly said. “Whether it’s basketball or something small, he wants to dominate.”But it wasn’t just about winning. Kelly also grounded her children in realism and accountability. “I’ve never sugarcoated anything,” she admitted. “If their effort wasn’t there, I’d tell them. I think being honest has helped them.”Her straightforwardness paid off. Cooper embraced the grind—working on fundamentals, staying late in the gym, and mastering the details, especially free throws. “They’re called free for a reason,” Kelly would say, emphasizing the value of focus and repetition.As Cooper’s fame grew, so did the pressure—but Kelly made sure the family stayed rooted. Rituals like sitting in the same seat for games or sticking to quirky superstitions kept things lighthearted and familiar. She never lost her sense of humor, often joking about marrying for basketball genetics or poking fun at Cooper’s rising status.More than anything, she maintained a strong emotional presence. No matter how high Cooper climbed, the Flagg family made it a priority to support one another—on the court and beyond.Kelly Flagg never claimed to have a magic recipe for raising a superstar. But through her actions, she revealed a powerful truth: greatness is born at the intersection of genetics, intention, honesty, competition, and love. Her commitment to understanding her children as individuals, challenging them to work harder, and being there every step of the way created more than just a basketball star—it built a resilient, grounded young man ready for anything.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Dallas Mavericks Weigh Risky but Ambitious Move for $52.6 Million Los Angeles Lakers Legend to form Big 3 with Anthony Davis and Kyrie Irving Cooper Flagg’s journey may be his own, but it’s one deeply rooted in a family culture that values authenticity, grit, and joy.
