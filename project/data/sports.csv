Donald Trump just made a big decision that will impact gym class for school going children in America. On Thursday, July 31, 2025, the US President signed an executive order to bring back the old Presidential Fitness Test in public schools. The test was stopped in 2012 when Barack Obama was President. But now, more than 10 years later, it’s making a comeback. Trump says it’s time for young Americans to get strong and healthy again but not everyone is clapping.Donald Trump signed the executive order on Thursday afternoon in Washington, D. C. It demands the reinstatement of the Presidential Fitness Test, a physical test students once completed in class yearly. The test was first started in 1956 by President Dwight D. Eisenhower.Sit-ups, pull-ups, push-ups, a one-mile run, a shuttle run, and a sit-and-reach stretch were all included in the original version of the test. It was intended to assess youngsters' level of fitness. President Barack Obama, however, did away with the test in 2012 and substituted the ""Presidential Youth Fitness Program,"" which emphasized health more and fewer difficult challenges.White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said,Trump was joined by famous athletes when he signed the order including Kansas City Chiefs kicker Harrison Butker, pro golfer Bryson DeChambeau, former WWE star Paul “Triple H” Levesque, and former NFL player Lawrence Taylor.The timing of this order is important.

FAQs



Are the Edmonton Oilers interested in signing Carter Hart?

Why are Carter Hart and the Hockey Canada Five not allowed to play in the NHL?

Have the Edmonton Oilers given second chances to players before?

Carter Hart may not be getting a chance with the Edmonton Oilers. NHL insider Frank Seravalli said on July 28, 2025, that the team is not interested in signing the goalie. Hart and four other players were part of the Hockey Canada Five case. Although they were found not guilty in court, the NHL has said the five players cannot play for now. Seravalli called Hart a “non‑starter” for the Oilers and said the league will review the case before making a final decision.Justice Maria Sarroccia ruled last week in Ontario’s King’s Court that Carter Hart and four teammates were not guilty in the Hockey Canada Five case. The players had faced sexual assault charges from a 2018 incident in London, Ontario. The judge said the complainant, known as E.M., gave consent and that parts of her story were not credible.Despite the verdict, the NHL told teams the players remain ineligible to sign until the commissioner’s office finishes its review. Frank Seravalli discussed this on TSN in Toronto on July 28. On the same day, Bob Stauffer, who hosts the Oilers Now show in Edmonton, asked fans and guests if the Oilers should sign any of the cleared players.Stauffer has raised this question several times since the ruling.On July 29, Stauffer invited former NHL agent and GM Brian Lawton to the show. Lawton said, “Canada feels divided over this. Half think the players did something horrible, half think they were cleared and should move on with their lives.” He added that the players may find it easier to sign with a U.S. team where hockey is less in the public eye.Also Read: Edmonton Oilers Face Uncertainty As Connor McDavid Eyes Short-Term NHL Contract Extension At Potential Record Salary The Oilers have a history of second chances. Last summer, Edmonton hired Stan Bowman as GM even though he had served a three‑year NHL suspension for mishandling a sexual assault case in Chicago in 2010. The team also signed players like Craig MacTavish, Zack Kassian, Evander Kane and Corey Perry when they faced serious problems. Many of those players rebuilt their careers and image in Edmonton.Now, with Carter Hart and the other four players, fans are wondering if the Oilers are changing their approach. NHL sources say the team has no current plans to sign any of them.Now, with Carter Hart and the others cleared in court but still banned by the NHL, fans wonder if Edmonton will stick to its history of second chances or shift course entirely.No, NHL insider Frank Seravalli said the Oilers have no plans to sign Carter Hart right now.The NHL has kept them ineligible until the commissioner’s office finishes its review of the 2018 case.Yes, the Oilers have signed players like Stan Bowman, Evander Kane, and Corey Perry after past issues.","Edmonton oilers bold stand on carter hart sparks nationwide outrage among nhl fans.

Eric Karlsson wants one thing in a trade: a real shot at winning the Stanley Cup

FAQs

1.bWhat does Erik Karlsson want in a trade?

2. Which teams are most likely to trade for Eric Karlsson?

3. Will Eric Karlsson be traded before the 2025–26 season starts?

As the Pittsburgh Penguins enter a pivotal offseason, veteran defenseman Erik Karlsson has become a central figure in trade discussions. The team, which has missed the Stanley Cup Playoffs for three consecutive years, is now shifting toward a rebuild, making big names like Karlsson, Rickard Rakell, and Bryan Rust available for potential trades.But one thing stands out in Karlsson’s case: he’s not willing to land just anywhere.According to NHL insider Frank Seravalli, Erik Karlsson has made it clear that he only wants to be traded to a contender. “Karlsson wants a chance to win,” Seravalli shared, emphasizing that any interested team will not only have to absorb Karlsson’s sizable contract but also meet his championship expectations.With this demand, the market for Karlsson becomes both exclusive and strategic. Only teams with both the cap flexibility and playoff-ready rosters need apply, making destinations like the Dallas Stars, Detroit Red Wings, and Carolina Hurricanes the most viable suitors. Each of these franchises has reportedly been exploring ways to reinforce their defensive core and make a serious Cup run.Karlsson’s contract, coupled with his desire to win, limits trade options but also clarifies the direction of talks.The Penguins, led by GM Kyle Dubas, are looking to refresh the roster and prepare for the future, meaning offloading Karlsson before the puck drops in the 2025–26 season is a top priority.The former Norris Trophy winner still has value, especially to a playoff-bound team in need of elite offensive skill from the blue line. Despite the obstacles, insiders believe a trade could realistically happen in the coming weeks, positioning Karlsson for one last serious Stanley Cup push.Also Read: NHL Rumors: Connor Bedard may get a powerful new linemate as Anton Frondell eyes opening night spot with Blackhawks He only wants to be traded to a Stanley Cup contender.Detroit, Dallas, and Carolina have been named as top possibilities.All signs point to the Penguins moving him before the 2025–26 campaign begins.","Penguins expected to move eric karlsson before start of 2025–26 nhl season.

How hockey apparel brands are sending dangerous messages to youth

From courtroom to culture war: why advocates say the real battle for reform has just begun

FAQs

1. Why are the Hockey Canada acquittals controversial?

2. What is the issue with the HockeyBenders clothing brand?

The Hockey Canada sexual assault trial has concluded, with the five accused players acquitted, yet the profound discussions about the sport's deep-seated culture persist. Despite the legal outcome, advocates stress the critical need to confront and alter ingrained attitudes toward women and sexuality, reaching far beyond the confines of the locker room.HockeyBenders, a popular Canadian apparel brand, unveils a troubling trend. They market T-shirts for ""$35"" and ""children’s sizes"" hoodies with the slogan ""Barduzz, Gettin Huzz,"" ""Loosely translated"" as: ""Scoring goals, getting hoes."" Their videos query teens on ""how many blondes"" and ""how many puck bunnies"" they know, with one labeled ""lover boy,"" another a ""quality over quantity guy.”While founder Cole Lequier, 25, asserts he ""felt like, growing up, there wasn’t many hockey clothing brands that had relatable slogans and sayings for hockey players,"" and ""So I saw a huge, huge gap in the market,"" critics like Andrea DeKeseredy, a sexual assault counselor, strongly contradict.She views these products as a stern refusal of hockey culture to evolve, phrasing, ""It shows the lack of true critical self-reflection and introspection that is occurring in Canadian hockey,"" and profoundly, ""It makes me sad. It’s the opposite of what should be happening.""The judge, Justice Maria Carroccia, interpreted that ""It is not the function of this court to make determinations about the morality or propriety of the conduct of any of the persons involved in these events.The sole function of this court is to determine whether the Crown has proven each of the charges against each of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt.""However, the trial heard how one player invited others to his room for a ""3 way,"" and texted a teammate to come for a ""gummer."" The complainant, E.M., described players discussing putting golf balls and clubs into her, though she initially told police this was said ""in a joking manner.""The National Hockey League dubiously condemned the conduct, affirming, ""The allegations made in this case, even if not determined to have been criminal, were very disturbing and the behaviour at issue was unacceptable.""HockeyBenders, yet, defends its content, with an email from ""The Hockeybenders Team"" stating, ""The boys are two hardworking young hockey entrepreneurs and make videos for people to enjoy and laugh that’s it. And like to keep everything they do positive. They like to stay in their own lane with their fans and followers!""Katherine Henderson, Hockey Canada's new CEO, finds such language on children's clothing ""disgusting,"" acknowledging the sport must confront these problematic attitudes.The Hockey Canada trial, despite its verdicts, spotlights persistent cultural issues.

Bulls Get Giddey and Claxton

Nets Add Frontcourt Depth and a Pick

In the midst of a turbulent NBA restricted free agency market, a three-team trade proposal has surfaced that would sendforwardto the Brooklyn Nets in exchange for Brooklyn’s explosive guard Cam Thomas. The deal, while hypothetical, reflects the growing uncertainty around restricted free agents and the Warriors’ roster direction.Aimed at resolving the futures of several young talents, the trade proposal brings together the Warriors, Nets, and Bulls:Cam Thomas, a 6-foot-3 guard, has carved out a reputation as a microwave scorer. Averaging 24 points per game last season for the Nets, Thomas showcased his ability to create offense at will, regardless of the defender in front of him. His offensive output has drawn comparisons to some of the league’s best bench scorers.However, concerns remain. His defensive limitations and lack of positional versatility could pose challenges in Golden State ’s system. As Jeremy Kruger notes in The Sporting News, “Thomas is a hard player to analyze… he also leaves a lot to be desired on defense.” Still, for a Warriors team possibly losing Kuminga, adding a prolific scorer off the bench could be a step toward bolstering their second unit.The trade buzz comes at a time when Jonathan Kuminga ’s future with the Warriors appears cloudy. Reports suggest that Kuminga is uninterested in returning to Golden State, favoring a move to the Phoenix Suns or Sacramento Kings instead. While the Warriors have publicly leaned toward retaining the 21-year-old forward, external speculation and trade proposals continue to gain traction.Kuminga has shown flashes of star potential, particularly with his athleticism and defensive upside. But inconsistent development and questions about his fit in Golden State’s system have fueled speculation that he could be on the move.The Bulls, often linked with trade discussions this offseason, would walk away with two young, controllable talents: center Nic Claxton and guard Josh Giddey, the latter re-signing on a four-year, $98 million deal. Claxton adds interior defense and rebounding, while Giddey provides backcourt playmaking and size.Brooklyn would receive Kuminga - adding more youth and athleticism to their core - along with veteran big man Nikola Vučević and a top-5 protected first-round pick in 2028. This move could help the Nets pivot toward a younger, more dynamic future.This proposed three-team trade checks multiple boxes: it provides a new home for discontented restricted free agents, balances rosters with complementary talent, and offers long-term cap clarity. For the Warriors, trading Kuminga for Cam Thomas would mark a shift toward offensive firepower over potential and defense.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Golden State Warriors Urged to Pursue $83,081,018 Sacramento Kings Star Duo to Bolster Squad; Jonathan Kuminga Prime Trade Asset Still, whether Golden State would truly entertain this move depends on how much faith they have in Kuminga’s long-term development—and how much risk they’re willing to take on a scorer like Thomas.",A three-team trade proposal has surfaced that would send golden state warriors forward jonathan kuminga to the brooklyn nets in exchange for cam thomas.

A peaceful day on the golf course turned into unexpected internet buzz for Stephen Curry and his wife, Ayesha Curry . In a now-viral video, the Golden State Warriors star paused a casual round of golf to sign a young fan’s jersey. It was certainly an act of kindness that didn’t go unnoticed.

He graciously signs the kid’s Warriors jersey and a card, smiling warmly throughout the interaction. Fans praised the gesture, calling it “vintage Curry” and a “class act.”But Ayesha, seated next to him, wasn’t quite in the same headspace. She remained on her phone, glanced at the fan without much reaction, and offered a look that some online described as “annoyed” or “unimpressed.” While she didn’t say anything overtly negative. While Ayesha responded back with a “hi” after the kid’s mother greeted her, her reaction was not something that fans expected.Many fans were less forgiving, accusing her of being cold or dismissive during what should have been a feel-good moment.However, not everyone was critical; many came to Ayesha’s defense, suggesting she was simply hoping for a quiet day with her husband, away from the constant interruptions that come with fame.While Stephen Curry is universally celebrated for his down-to-earth vibe, it’s easy to forget the toll constant public attention can take, especially on his family.

He soon arrived at the hospital and was declared dead.The medical report also indicated that Hulk Hogan was experiencing atrial flutter, which is an irregular heartbeat, and was also diagnosed with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, a slow-growing cancer of the blood.He had these underlying conditions, which were disclosed following his death.A medical examiner ruled the death natural, and the family has since decided to have him cremated, but there is as yet no date set for a public memorial.Sky Daily, Hogan's spouse, called the loss an unexpected ""emotional tsunami"" in a heartfelt statement. She revealed that although Hogan had undergone neck surgery earlier this year, but seemed to be healing well and was otherwise in high spirits just days before his sudden death.His daughter, Brooke Hogan , also spoke out, saying their relationship was loving, and although there had been ""family issues in the past"", she had not fallen out with him. Hulk's son Nick also remembered him as ""his best friend"" and recalled all their moments together in a very emotional tribute.His ex-wife, Linda Hogan, mourned, saying, “I never really got over him in all these years.” She also admitted that they had a long and troubled history together and that she still loved him and missed him.So did the wrestling community. WWE dedicated a segment to him on Monday Night Raw, and many legends and fans paid their respects. Ric Flair, Vince McMahon, and more are in disbelief as they pay tribute to Hogan for being a mentor, friend, and marvel of the wrestling world.Also Read: Brooke Hogan Turned Her Back on Hulk Hogan’s $25M Fortune Before His Death: Report In the 80s, Hulk Hogan was the biggest name in the world, leading the ""Hulkamania"" charge and being known all over the world.

Even though his legacy would later be marred in part by scandal and facing his legal challenges, he was a pop culture giant above reproach.","Hulk hogan, 71, died on 24 july 2025 at his home in clearwater, florida.

The 2024 NFL season for 27-year-old tight end Noah Fant looked underwhelming with the Seattle Seahawks–with only 48 passes for 500 yards in 14 games, despite starting 83 games of the total 95 appearances throughout his career. Now, on the other hand, the Cincinnati Bengals are struggling(9 wins and 8 losses in 2024). Their star quarterback, Joe Burrow ? Struggling with slow starts ever since his entry. Would Noah Fant become the missing piece of the Bengals’ puzzle? Only time will tell. For now, it’s his contract that’s on top of the discussion shelf.ESPN Senior NFL Insider, Adam Schefter, took to his X to inform the cyberspace that the Bengals are giving former Seahawks and Broncos TE Noah Fant a one-year deal. They have also released TE Kole Taylor. An X user commented, “Bengals adding another piece to Burrow’s arsenal.” Another said, “Good target for Burrow. Solid pick up.” A third fan chimed in, “The man wants to win. Cincy makes sense.”Bengals HC Zac Taylor is all-praise, no-complaint for the newly signed tight end, Noah Fant. The coach called Fant a great, explosive player and a weapon in the tight end room. Taylor told Russ Heltman of Sports Illustrated, “You’ve got a player that’s really plus in both the run and the pass, and so at the point of attack, blocking, backside of blocking, and protection can help you.But also really explosive as a receiver, great size, great explosiveness, really good hands, tough to bring down. I think that’s another weapon, anytime we can add weapons like that, and Erick All(Jr.) played that role for us last year as well. So again, we really feel good about our tight end room.”Noah Fant was picked by the Denver Broncos in the 2019 NFL Draft as their first-round, 20th overall pick.

Pickens’ ‘Alien’ talent might be exactly what Dallas needs



Dallas Cowboys wide receiver George Pickens is quickly making an impact in Texas. The former Pittsburgh Steelers wideout has embraced a bold new persona, calling himself an “alien” as he begins a fresh chapter in Dallas. Beyond the headline-grabbing nickname, Pickens is already showing he could be the missing weapon to supercharge the Cowboys’ offense alongside CeeDee Lamb.Pickens didn’t shy away from explaining his unusual self-comparison. “I just think I’m an alien. Period. For real, for real. Just by the stuff I be doing, how I carry myself on and off the field,” he said. While the remark may raise eyebrows, his impact on the field is speaking louder than words.Since arriving in Dallas, Pickens appears rejuvenated. His attitude and energy have noticeably shifted from his Steelers days, where he often grew frustrated with limited opportunities. Cowboys star CeeDee Lamb has already noticed the difference. “It’s pretty much night and day,” Lamb said, emphasizing how Pickens changes defensive attention. “When I have two guys on me, I can guarantee the ball is going to him.When two guys are on me, he’s one-on-one. Do what you want with that info. It’s honestly fun.”For the Cowboys, this is the offensive spark they’ve been waiting for. Ever since Amari Cooper’s departure, Lamb has carried the receiving corps with little help. Defenses could double him without fear of a second threat. Pickens changes that equation completely. His physicality, catch radius, and ability to win one-on-one matchups give Dallas a true No. 2 option—and potentially a co-star.The move also benefits Pickens, whose talent was often stifled in Pittsburgh by inconsistent quarterback play. In Dallas, with a more dynamic passing attack, he’s expected to see the ball far more often. A happier, motivated Pickens could unlock an offense that has struggled in critical moments over the last few seasons.George Pickens says he calls himself an “alien” because of the way he carries himself on and off the field and the unique plays he makes. He believes his talent and style of play set him apart from other NFL players.Pickens provides the Cowboys with a true No. 2 wide receiver alongside CeeDee Lamb. His ability to win one-on-one matchups forces defenses to spread coverage, giving Dallas a more explosive and balanced passing attack.Pickens’ production in Pittsburgh was limited by inconsistent quarterback play and a conservative passing game.

A rookie carrying Tennessee’s 2025 defensive hopes

The Tennessee Titans stunned the NFL when they released veteran linebacker Harold Landry III in March. Landry had just led the team with nine sacks in 2024, making his exit a surprise for fans. The move marked a defensive reset, with the franchise turning to the 2025 NFL Draft for a new pass-rushing anchor.Tennessee addressed its defensive need in the second round by drafting Oluwafemi Oladejo, a versatile edge rusher built to energize a stagnant pass rush. While officially an edge rusher, Oladejo offers more than just quarterback pressure. The Titans plan to deploy him in a hybrid role, capable of attacking off the edge and dropping into coverage when needed.The Titans recorded just 32 sacks last season, tied for the third-fewest in the NFL. This lack of pressure allowed opposing quarterbacks too much comfort, costing Tennessee key games. ESPN’s Turron Davenport reported that the team sees Oladejo as a key piece in reviving a struggling pass rush.Determined to make an immediate impact, Oladejo has been studying elite edge rushers like T.J. Watt, Maxx Crosby, and Micah Parsons.His path mirrors Parsons, who successfully transitioned from middle linebacker to dominant edge rusher in the NFL. Oladejo followed a similar journey, starting as a middle linebacker at California and UCLA before moving to defensive end late in college.“The biggest thing playing on the edge is your get-off,” Oladejo said. “If you have a good get-off and play with your hands, it can make up for anything.” His dedication to fundamentals and technique could be exactly what the Titans need to turn their pass rush around.The Titans released Harold Landry III in March 2025 despite his nine-sack season to reset their defense and create room for younger pass rushers like Oluwafemi Oladejo.Oluwafemi Oladejo is a rookie edge rusher drafted in the second round of the 2025 NFL Draft.

Recently, during the NBA offseason, one of the most prominent stories has been Jonathan Kuminga's back-and-forth negotiations with the Golden State Warriors. It has also garnered a lot of attention from the media and his fans. The Sacramento Kings and Phoenix Suns have also tried to pursue him. Meanwhile, according to reports, the Golden State Warriors are not interested in trading for Dillon Brooks in exchange for Jonathan Kuminga from the Phoenix Suns. Jonathan Kuminga is the biggest holdup in the league as the Golden State Warriors navigate an offseason in which they have yet to sign any significant free agents. The G.S. Warriors are willing to match any offer sheet that a team submits to Jonathan Kuminga because he is a restricted free agent. However, a trade is difficult under the new Collective Bargaining Agreement.In any possible sign-and-trade, the G.S. Warriors are seeking high-quality assets in exchange, despite interest from teams like the Phoenix Suns and Sacramento Kings. The Phoenix Suns reportedly have to trade Royce O'Neale and Grayson Allen. They have also allegedly discussed with the team about Jonathan Kuminga.According to insiders, the G.S. Warriors would not be interested in newly acquired wing Dillon Brooks, and the Phoenix Suns have not made an offer to trade him this offseason. Stating the same, insider Brett Siegel said:“Phoenix has not offered, and will not involve, newly acquired wing Dillon Brooks in trade conversations this offseason, nor would the Warriors hold interest in him, sources said.”In July, forward Dillon Brooks joined the Phoenix Suns . Following his first day with the team, he received a message from the management. The Phoenix Suns are probably better defensively, even though they have more guards.Additionally, the Golden State Warriors and Dillon Brooks have a history as Following their victory in Game 7, the Warriors humiliated Dillon Brooks in May 2025. After shooting 3-of-9 for eight points in 36 minutes as the G.S. Warriors won Game 7 103-89, Dillon Brooks left the court without recognizing his opponents.Draymond Green dissed the player during his appearance on The Draymond Green Show and said:""Dillon Brooks ran off the court. So, when I say you see what guys is made of, he ran off the court. Ain't shake nobody up. You admitted you were trying to hurt Steph's hand. Which, fine by me, bro. I get it, we all get it when you hoop.Meanwhile, the Phoenix Suns might wait to see what kind of season they have without Bradley Beal and Kevin Durant before cutting ties with Dillon Brooks, even though he would meet the G.S.

On his podcast, Wy Network, Wade opened up on how he got introduced to the game of basketball, giving full credit to legendary Michael Jordan. When he was asked to give his pick of the seven greatest NBA players, he chose the ones who he grew up watching and played along with as an NBA player. He interestingly put Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant at the same level in greatness and said that they were the same players.Dwyane Wade did not keep himself away from the trending NBA GOAT debate and addressed the same in the latest episode of the Wy Network podcast. He picked the seven players and put them on his greatest players’ list, but without leaving any difference between Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant. He called them ‘the same players’, unlike many others.Here is the complete transcript of the video where he mentions his list of seven greatest NBA players:He started with mentioning Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant on the top two positions, saying, “I would say my introduction to basketball started with Michael Jordan. Before Michael Jordan, I wouldn't really like him, even though I know the greats. I know the history, but I never really watched them.Like, I even missed a lot of the Magic era when it came to my understanding of watching a game of basketball. And so for me, Michael Jordan is when it started for me. I go Kobe, they were the same player. You saw one, you saw the other.""Then, he moved to LeBron James, explaining, “I go, obviously, LeBron, you know, getting a chance to watch him play, but I got a chance to see him up close and personal for four years in a row. I've never saw a greater basketball player when it comes to the way he plays this game in person with my own eyes. Like, I watched Jordan from afar. The way LeBron played his game is just incredible.”His next choice was Allen Iverson. He said, “And then from there, I go with AI. Just one of my favorite players, man, just a little dude who just will, there's nothing you can do with him. The way he was just a giant killer bro. He attacked everybody in front of him, and he did it with so much swag and pizzazz.”Speaking on Stephen Curry, he said: “I go with Steph Curry to watch Steph, see him from college, to watch him come into the pros very early, and then watch this when he took over the pros, when he took over the league. But Steph just did it in a whole different way that none of us saw coming.”Speaking further on the other players whom he found inspiring, Dwyane Wade mentioned Shaquille O’Neal. He said:“Big Shaq. I've never seen a more dominant force play this game. I love it when a big guy, especially at that era, played like a big guy. He was dunking on everybody, dog. He didn't care. I love it.”Moving to the last player, Dwyane considered the greatest, he said, “And the last one that I would say is Kevin Garnett. Kevin Garnett was one of the most versatile players that I've ever seen play the game of basketball.”Elaborating further on Garnett, he said, “I remember being in awe of watching somebody at his size pick up 94 feet, will guard the guard, but then get back to his, man. You know what I'm saying? Stay talking the whole game, dominate on the boards, dominate in the post, hit the outside jumper, dunk on you, and had a personality and the swag. He had it all, too.”Watch the complete statement of Dwyane Wade on his NBA’s seven greatest players (7:01 to 10:23) :Dwayne Wade’s seven greatest players list showed the kind of impact a player can make collectively with personality, play style, and the role picked up for the team.
