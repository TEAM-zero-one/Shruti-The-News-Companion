BCCI condemns remarks

Mohamed defends her remarks

NEW DELHI: Just a day before India’s semifinal match against New Zealand , a political bouncer rattled Congress after party spokesperson Shama Mohamed took a swing at Indian men's cricket team captain Rohit Sharma , calling him ""fat"" and a ""mediocre captain."" Her remarks, made after Rohit got out during India's Champions Trophy clash against New Zealand, have sparked a fiery debate, with politicians from all sides weighing in, and Congress distancing itself from the remark.The Congress leader had taken to social media on Sunday, criticising Sharma's physical fitness and calling him a ""mediocre captain."" ""Rohit Sharma is fat for a sportsman! Needs to lose weight! And of course, the most unimpressive captain India has ever had!"" she wrote in a now-deleted post.She went on to compare him unfavourably to cricketing greats like MS Dhoni, Virat Kohli, and Sachin Tendulkar.After facing heavy criticism, Mohamed defended her comments, insisting they were observations rather than body-shaming. ""It was a generic tweet about the fitness of a sportsperson. It was not body-shaming,"" she told ANI, adding that she had every right to express her opinion in a democracy.Congress leader Pawan Khera said that Mohamed had been asked to delete her posts and exercise greater caution in the future. ""Her remarks do not reflect the party's position. She has been advised to be more careful,"" Khera wrote on X.Congress MP Rajani Patil condemned Mohamed's comments, saying, ""I personally and the party also will not approve of body-shaming anyone. Talking this way about a sportsperson who represents the country is not right. The party will seek a response from her on this.""BJP leader Shehzad Poonawalla attacked the Congress, saying, ""Those who have lost 90 elections under the captaincy of Rahul Gandhi are calling Rohit Sharma unimpressive! I guess six ducks in Delhi and 90 election losses is impressive, but winning the T20 World Cup isn’t! Rohit has a brilliant track record as captain.""BJP leader Pradeep Bhandari accused Congress of opposing patriotic figures. ""The Congress party is trying to send a message that every patriot, who does good for the country, will be opposed by them,"" he said.Union sports minister Mansukh Mandaviya also weighed in on the controversy and suggested political parties to leave sportspersons alone as they are fully capable of handling their professional lives.In a social media post on X, Mandaviya said, ""Congress and TMC should leave sportspersons alone as they are fully capable of handling their professional lives. Remarks made by leaders from these parties, indulging in body shaming and questioning an athlete’s place in the team, are not only deeply shameful but also outright pathetic.""""Such comments undermine the hard work and sacrifices that our sportspersons make to represent the country on the global stage,"" he added.TMC MP Saugata Roy supported Mohamed’s critique, arguing, ""I heard that Rohit Sharma's performance has been quite poor. He scored one century, but otherwise gets out cheaply. He shouldn’t be in the team. India wins because of other players.""Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Priyanka Chaturvedi took a different stand, saying, ""Not an avid cricket fan, but even with my limited interest in the game, I can say that Rohit Sharma, with extra pounds or without, has led India to great heights. It is his work and commitment that matter. Win the trophy, Champion!""Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Nirupam strongly opposed Mohamed’s remarks, calling them disrespectful. ""Rohit Sharma and other cricketers like him are heroes of our country. Only Congress people can feel good about criticising such people. The anti-India mentality appears to be expanding from top to bottom.""BCCI Secretary Devajit Saikia condemned the remarks and said its ""unfortunate"" that such remarks were made before the semifinal match.""It's very unfortunate this kind of remarks come from such a person who is on a responsible post to our captain, on a meanwhile time when India is playing an ICC tournament and the team is all set to play Semi final,"" he told ANI.Despite the backlash, Mohamed doubled down on her stance, questioning Sharma’s leadership choices in key matches. She cited his decisions during India's Test series against Australia and the World Cup final loss in Ahmedabad, arguing that his strategic calls had cost the team. ""Didn't he move KL Rahul to bat at number 3 at the MCG Test & put himself at number 1, which backfired? Because of that, Shubman Gill was out of the XI. Didn’t we lose the last World Cup in Ahmedabad?""Later while speaking to ANI, Shama said that her comments were not meant to body-shame the Indian captain but were a general observation on athlete fitness.“It was a generic tweet about the fitness of a sportsperson. It was not body-shaming. I always believed a sportsperson should be fit, and I felt he was a bit overweight, so I just tweeted about that,” she said. “I have been attacked for no reason. When I compared him with previous captains, I put in a statement. I have the right. What is wrong in saying? It is a democracy,” she added.","Congress spokesperson shama mohamed took a swing at indian men's cricket team captain rohit sharma.

NEW DELHI: Congress spokesperson Shama Mohamed kicked up a row on Monday by body shaming Indian cricket captain Rohit Sharma in a series of social media posts. Faced with an attack from BJP and condemnation across the board, Congress dissociated itself from Mohamed's posts and asked her to delete them.Chairman of Congress's media department Pawan Khera issued a statement, ""Shama Mohamed made certain remarks about a cricketing legend that do not reflect the party's position. She has been asked to delete the concerned social media posts from X and has been advised to exercise greater caution in the future. Congress holds the contributions of sporting icons in the highest regard and does not endorse any statements that undermine their legacy.""Mohamed deleted her posts but argued that they were generic remarks about the fitness of a sportsperson, which was her right in a democracy. Mohamed posted that she felt Rohit Sharma ""was a bit overweight"" and wrote about his fitness. ""I have been attacked for no reason. When I compared him with previous captains, I put in a statement. I have the right. What is wrong in saying that? It is a democracy,"" she added. She argued that questioning the weight of a cricketer did not amount to body shaming.Union sports minister Mansukh Mandaviya said sportspersons should be left alone as they were capable of handling their professional lives.

""This is a premeditated put-down to undermine the team's morale at a crucial time. Their disdain for our icons is apparent. They resent a self-confident India,"" Malviya added.Amid the kerfuffle, Mohamed drew support from TMC MP Saugata Roy, who said she was right in her observation, and that Sharma should not be in Indian team, and definitely not be the captain. ""I believe Rohit Sharma should be removed from the team. He has been failing in matches in every format. The captain must earn his place in the team. I feel Rohit should not be in the team, this is my personal opinion,"" he added.","Bjp, pointing to congress’ record of ‘losing over 90 elections under rahul gandhi’s leadership’, claimed that the opposition party was trying to hit the indian team's morale.

'Being attacked for no reason'

BJP’s hits back

NEW DELHI: Congress spokesperson Shama Mohamed on late Sunday questioned the leadership of Indian men's national cricket team captain Rohit Sharma . Reacting to India's match against New Zealand in the ongoing Champions Trophy, Shama labelled Rohit ""fat"" and called him a ""mediocre captain"".""Rohit Sharma is fat for a sportsman! Needs to lose weight! And of course, the most unimpressive captain India has ever had!"" the Congress spokesperson wrote in a social media post. After facing backlash, the Congress leader deleted her post.She went further in another post, questioning Sharma’s abilities compared to past cricketing legends. ""What is so world-class about him when compared to his predecessors like Ganguly, Tendulkar, Dravid, Dhoni, Kohli, Kapil Dev, Shastri & the rest? He is a mediocre captain as well as a mediocre player who got lucky to be the captain of India.""Following the backlash, Shama defended her remarks questioning Rohit's decision to promote himself to the opening spot during India's Test match against Australia, a match that the Men in Blue ultimately lost.""Didn't he move KL Rahul to bat at number 3 at the MCG Test & put himself at number 1 which backfired totally ! Wasn't that a selfish move ? Because of that Shubam Gill was out of the XI . Didn't we lose the last World Cup which took place in Ahmedabad? I have compared him to our previous captains,"" she wrote in another post.Speaking to the news agency ANI, Shama clarified that her remarks were ""generic"" and were not intended to shame the captain of the Indian men's cricket team. Further defending her comments, she said that, in her opinion, ""sportspersons should be fit,"" and added that she was being ""attacked for no reason"" over her statements.""It was a generic tweet about the fitness of a sportsperson. It was not body-shaming. I always believed a sportsperson should be fit, and I felt he was a bit overweight, so I just tweeted about that,"" she said.""I have been attacked for no reason.

""Those who have lost 90 elections under the captaincy of Rahul Gandhi are calling the captaincy of Rohit Sharma unimpressive!"" he remarked.Poonawalla also defended Sharma’s track record, referencing his recent achievements. ""I guess six ducks in Delhi and 90 election losses is impressive, but winning the T20 World Cup isn’t! Rohit has a brilliant track record as captain, by the way!""Meanwhile, on the field, India secured a crucial victory over New Zealand, winning by 44 runs to top Group A.

Charlotte Hornets injury report for tonight’s game against the Golden State Warriors (March 3, 2025)

How to watch the Golden State Warriors play tonight against the Charlotte Hornets (March 3, 2025)

Jimmy Butler, the Golden State Warriors ' key forward, is listed as probable for Monday night’s game against the Charlotte Hornets due to a back injury. The Warriors, holding a 32-28 record, will face the struggling Hornets (14-45) at the Spectrum Center in Charlotte, North Carolina, at 7 p.m. ET. Butler’s availability is a significant factor for Golden State as they aim to maintain their playoff push. Jimmy Butler has been exhibiting his defensive prowess and clutch performances, which has made him a vital contributor to the Warriors’ success this season. His probable status suggests he is likely to suit up, but his minutes could be monitored to avoid aggravating the injury. The Warriors are already dealing with other injury concerns, including Jonathan Kuminga, who is out with an ankle injury, and Quinten Post, who is questionable with an ankle issue.The Warriors’ offense, led by Stephen Curry, averages 113.0 points per game, ranking 16th in the NBA. Curry, who is averaging 24.1 points per game, will need support from Butler and others to overcome a Hornets team that, despite their poor record, has shown resilience at home. Golden State’s defense, allowing 111.4 points per game (10th in the league), will also rely on Jimmy Butler’s presence to contain Charlotte’s leading scorer, LaMelo Ball, who averages 26.1 points per game.For the Charlotte Hornets , injuries have plagued their season, with key players like Grant Williams and Brandon Miller out for the year. However, Miles Bridges, listed as probable due to illness, is expected to play and will be crucial for Charlotte’s chances. Bridges averages 20.6 points and 7.7 rebounds per game, making him a focal point of the Hornets’ offense.The game will be broadcast on NBCS-BA and FDSSE, with live streaming available on Fubo. Fans can also engage with FanDuel Fantasy for daily fantasy action.As the Warriors look to capitalize on their +100 scoring differential, Butler’s health remains a storyline to watch. His ability to play through the back injury could be the difference in a tight contest. Golden State’s depth will be tested, but with Jimmy Butler likely on the court, they remain favorites to secure a crucial road win.","Jimmy butler, the golden state warriors'key forward, is listed as probable for monday night’s game against the charlotte hornets due to a back injury.

NBA Offseason Rumors: Los Angeles Lakers might sign 8x All-Star and NBA Champion; possible reunion with Luka Doncic?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/nba-offseason-rumors-los-angeles-lakers-might-sign-8x-all-star-and-nba-champion-possible-reunion-with-luka-doncic/articleshow/118668216.cms,"Luka Doncic and LeBron James (Image via Getty Images)

“He often talked about their families being close, spending time off the court enjoying each other's presence, and just a pure enjoyment on both of their faces when they are on the court.”

Luka Doncic (Image via AP)

“All in all, Dallas made a move to try winning the NBA Finals, but there is a serious connection between Irving being 'out-of-the-loop' in Dallas to where he joins two of his former teammates in Los Angeles,”

The Los Angeles Lakers made headlines earlier this year by acquiring Luka Doncic in a blockbuster trade with the Dallas Mavericks. While the Slovenian superstar has quickly become a fan favorite, the Lakers could further solidify their roster this offseason by reuniting Doncic with a familiar face: Kyrie Irving Irving, an eight-time All-Star and NBA champion with the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2016, shares a strong bond with Doncic. Their partnership in Dallas, though short-lived, was electric. “(Kyrie) Irving and Doncic were basically two peas in a pod, with Irving outright stating on numerous occasions how dominant of a player Doncic was as well as how good of a friend he was,” wrote Daniel Alameda of The Wrightway Sports Network.During their time together, Kyrie Irving ’s flashy ball-handling and clutch shot-making perfectly complemented Doncic’s methodical and strategic approach. Despite losing to the Boston Celtics, the pair guided the Mavericks to a 50-32 record and an unexpected trip to the NBA Finals the previous season. The couple showed a lot of promise despite the setback, so the prospect of a reunion in Los Angeles was fascinating.The Los Angeles Lakers , who traded Anthony Davis for Doncic in February, are now focused on building a championship-caliber team around their new star. Bringing in Kyrie Irving, who also shares a strong relationship with LeBron James, could be a game-changer.Alameda added.Kyrie Irving’s experience, leadership, and chemistry with Doncic make him an ideal target for the Los Angeles Lakers in free agency. If the franchise can secure the $120 million guard, it would not only boost their title hopes for the 2025-26 season but also send a clear message to Doncic that they are committed to building a contender around him.Also read: NBA Offseason Rumors: Golden State Warriors might sign $60 million Chicago Bulls center to support Stephen Curry in his remaining years As the offseason approaches, all eyes will be on the Los Angeles Lakers’ front office to see if they can pull off this high-stakes reunion.","The los angeles lakers made headlines earlier this year by acquiring luka doncic in a blockbuster trade with the dallas mavericks.

NBA legendhas recently shared his thoughts on’s performance at the, as he has found his rhythm pushing the team in the Bay area to clinch more wins. When the Golden State Warriors acquired Butler, many questioned whether he would fit into their system. However, nearly a month after the trade deadline, Butler has given the ""Dubs"" a much-needed spark, elevating them from a struggling play-in contender to a legitimate playoff threat. He has been one of the lethal stars in the league, and the partnership withmade them more powerful. Carmelo Anthony has recently shared his thoughts on Jimmy Butle r’s new tenure with the Golden State Warriors. During a recent episode of 7 PM in Brooklyn, 10-time NBA All-Star Anthony praised how Butler brought life back to the team. “Jimmy gives them something different,” Melo said. “Jimmy gives you another Draymond on the defensive end. So Jimmy can now guard the players, and Draymond can be the safety now, which he is very elite at being the safety. So now, Jimmy could be as aggressive on the defensive end. He could be in the passing lanes. He got Draymond talking to him. That’s the type of sh** that Jimmy needs to be around. And they’re dogs out there on the defensive end.”The numbers back up Melo’s assessment. In January 2025, the Warriors ranked 25th in the league in defensive rating. Since Butler’s arrival, they’ve skyrocketed to No. 3 overall in February 2025. The team’s newfound defensive identity has been a game-changer, helping them secure key wins in the second half of the season.Beyond his defensive contributions, Butler has also provided a steadying force on offense. Melo pointed out how Butler's ability to slow the game down by drawing fouls gives Stephen Curry much-needed breathers. His post-game also adds another dimension to the Warriors’ offensive sets, allowing them to attack teams in different ways.“Jimmy thrives in that role of like being just a role player in a sense,” Anthony said. “That’s when you gonna see the best Jimmy. And he wants to be the complimentary guy. He’s a star, but he wants to be the complimentary guy to Steph. And why not?”So far, the results speak for themselves. Butler recently became the first player in Warriors history to record 120+ points, 30+ rebounds, and 30+ assists in his first six games with the franchise. In eight games, he's averaging 16.4 points, 5.8 rebounds, 5.6 assists, and 1.3 steals per game. Undoubtedly, it is impressive numbers for someone seamlessly adapting to a new system.However, Butler’s arrival in the Golden State was far from a cakewalk. Before the trade, his relationship with the Miami Heat had deteriorated, leading him to demand a move.Anthony had a word of caution for Butler. He referenced former NBA point guard Stephon Marbury, whose public feud with the New York Knicks led to a steep decline in his career. “Chill out,” Anthony advised Butler, suggesting that his heated dispute with Heat president Pat Riley could hurt his trade prospects.Also Read: Anthony Edwards' blunt message to Barack Obama gets big reaction from Carmelo Anthony The Heat's reluctance to lower their asking price only complicated matters, as the market for Butler wasn't as robust as expected. In the end, the Warriors capitalized on the situation, bringing in a player who has already made a significant impact. Considering current stats, it is fair to say that Butler’s move to the Bay Area has proven to be a major success.","Carmelo anthony praised jimmy butler’s tenure with the golden state warriors.

After he was severely injured at the Royal Rumble by Bron Breakker, the US-based Youtuber vowed never to be back on WWE, but now it seems the young sensation has changed his mind to come in support of Rhodes while reacting to John Cena’s heel turn on Cody Rhodes.After what happened to Cody Rhodes at the Elimination Chamber PLE, YouTube sensation IShowSpeed has extended his support to the American Nightmare. IShowSpeed extended his support for Rhodes during the latest live stream reacting to John Cena ’s shocking transition and said that he would join Rhodes to help him win against Cena and The Rock.On the other hand, Travis Scott, who featured with The Rock and Cena to beat Cody Rhodes at the Elimination Chamber PLE, is preparing to feature in WWE.

Taylor Swift urged to keep her personal and professional brands separate

Taylor Swift is reportedly coming under more pressure to keep her personal life separate from her professional image. Some, according to insiders, think that her very public romance with Travis Kelce might be having a detrimental impact on her reputation. The debate was heightened after she received boos at the Super Bowl—a moment that some waved off as friendly ribbing, while others interpreted it as a sign that her involvement in the NFL universe isn't welcomed by everyone.Taylor Swift is said to be increasingly being urged to keep her personal and professional brands separate. Sources claim that certain advisers of hers are of the view that her celebrity romance with Travis Kelce might be damaging her carefully crafted persona. Disapproval mounted after she was booed at the Super Bowl—a spectacle that some ridiculed as light-hearted taunts, but others interpreted as definitive proof that her growing presence within the NFL community isn't for everyone. Since Swift is arguably one of the most powerful entities in the music industry, a few insiders fret that her visibility with the world of sports would bring unnecessary turmoil to her profession.At the same time, Kelce is also receiving flak, especially from fans of the Kansas City Chiefs questioning if his priorities on football have been diluted. His disappointing outing in the last game of the season against the Philadelphia Eagles only added fuel to the fire, with some of them positing that his life outside the football field, including his relationship with Swift, might be affecting his performance.Once regarded as an untouchable leader on the field, Kelce is now under scrutiny for possibly letting distractions interfere with his play. Since the couple continues to be in the spotlight, both Swift and Kelce find themselves at the center of discussions regarding whether their romanceTaylor Swift and Travis Kelce, formerly the epitome of power couples connecting music and sport, now face a reversal of public perception that could be hard to discount. Rumors of a possible wedding later in the year only served to heighten debate, with some industry sources warning that cross-pollinating their brands to such an extent might prove to have unforeseen effects. With their relationship making up-page news every day, the test is to keep their romance alive while keeping their respective careers intact.“This whole situation is creating a weird tension between her and Travis, especially since this is their first real bump in the road,” a source told Radar Online. “Until now, it’s been nothing but good times! You can only imagine the awkward discussions happening behind the scenes about when it’s appropriate for them to be seen together and how they’re supposed to act. Definitely not the romantic vibe they were hoping for!”Also Read: Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce losing their popularity as Super Bowl loss shifts spotlight away Taylor Swift has been pulled into a surprise legal battle with her close friends Blake Lively, Ryan Reynolds, and former co-star of Lively's Justin Baldoni.

Fed up with the unwanted connection, she perceives it as a possible threat to her image. Consequently, part of the insiders is now calling on her to distance herself from Lively, just as she's being advised to do regarding her affair with Travis Kelce.","Taylor swift urged to keep her personal and professional brands separate.

How to watch the Charlotte Hornets play tonight against the Golden State Warriors (March 3, 2025)

The Charlotte Hornets are set to host the Golden State Warriors on Monday, March 3, at the Spectrum Center, but all eyes are on the injury report, particularly the status of star point guard LaMelo Ball. The Hornets, struggling with a 14-45 record, have seven players listed on the injury report, including Ball, whose absence could further complicate their chances against a competitive Warriors squad. LaMelo Ball is listed on the team’s projected starters and he is absent from the team’s injury report. So, he will be playing tonight against the Warriors. Ball who leads the Hornets with a team-high 26.1 points per game, has been a bright spot in an otherwise challenging season for Charlotte. However, his recent injury has raised concerns about his availability and the team’s ability to compete without their primary scorer and playmaker. While the official injury report does not specify Ball’s condition, his absence from the list suggests he may be playing through discomfort or managing a minor issue. The Hornets ’ injury woes extend beyond LaMelo Ball. Grant Williams and Brandon Miller are out for the season with ACL and wrist injuries, respectively, while Josh Okogie and Tre Mann are also sidelined. Miles Bridges, listed as probable due to illness, is expected to play, providing some relief for a team already thin on depth.On the Warriors’ side, the injury report is less severe but still impactful. Jonathan Kuminga is out with an ankle injury, while Quinten Post is questionable for the same reason. Jimmy Butler, listed as probable with a back issue, is expected to suit up, bolstering Golden State’s lineup.The Warriors, with a 32-28 record, have been consistent offensively, ranking 16th in the league with 113.0 points per game. Stephen Curry remains their cornerstone, averaging 24.1 points and leading the NBA with 4.5 three-pointers made per game. His presence, combined with the Hornets’ defensive struggles, could spell trouble for Charlotte, especially if LaMelo Ball is limited or unavailable.For the Hornets, Bridges has been a key contributor, averaging 20.6 points and 7.7 rebounds over the last 20 games. His ability to step up in Ball’s potential absence will be critical. However, Charlotte’s overall performance has been lackluster, ranking 28th in scoring (105.2 points per game) and 13th in points allowed (112.8).As the Hornets prepare to face the Warriors, LaMelo Ball’s status remains a focal point. His presence on the court could provide a much-needed spark, but his absence would leave a significant void in Charlotte’s offense. Fans can catch the game at 7 p.m. ET on NBCS-BA and FDSSE or stream it live on Fubo.Also read: Will Jimmy Butler play tonight against the Charlotte Hornets?

How to watch the Philadelphia 76ers play tonight against the Portland Trail Blazers (March 3, 2025)?

The Philadelphia 76ers will face the Portland Trail Blazers on Monday, March 3, at the Wells Fargo Center, but they’ll do so without their star center, Joel Embiid, who has been officially ruled out for the remainder of the season due to a knee injury. Embiid’s absence is a significant blow to the struggling 76ers, who are already dealing with multiple injuries as they prepare for the 7 p.m. ET tip-off. Joel Embiid , a former MVP and the cornerstone of the 76ers’ roster, has been sidelined since late January after suffering a meniscus tear in his left knee. Despite initial hopes for a potential return, the team confirmed on Monday that he will not play again this season.The 76ers’ injury report is lengthy, with four other players listed alongside Embiid. Eric Gordon (wrist), Jared McCain (meniscus), and Kyle Lowry (hip) are all out, while Paul George remains questionable with a groin injury. These absences have left the team shorthanded as they try to navigate a challenging season. Philadelphia currently sits at 21-38, ranking 26th in the league in scoring with 109.2 points per game. Tyrese Maxey has stepped up in Joel Embiid’s absence, leading the team with 26.7 points per game, good for sixth in the NBA. Kelly Oubre Jr. has also been a bright spot, averaging 17.8 points and 7.2 rebounds over the last 20 games. However, the team’s struggles on the boards—ranking last in the league with 39.2 rebounds per game—have been a glaring issue.On the other side, the Trail Blazers enter the game with their own injury concerns. Robert Williams III (knee), Matisse Thybulle (ankle), Deandre Ayton (calf), and Jerami Grant (calf) are all out, leaving Portland without key contributors. Anfernee Simons, who leads the team with 18.7 points per game, will be relied upon heavily to carry the offensive load.The matchup between the 76ers and Trail Blazers will be a battle of two teams fighting to stay afloat amid injury-plagued seasons. For Philadelphia, the focus now shifts to the future, as Joel Embiid’s recovery and the team’s offseason moves will be critical in determining their trajectory for the 2025-26 season.Fans can catch the game live on KATU, KUNP, and NBCS-PH, or stream it on Fubo.
