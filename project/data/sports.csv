Tragedy didn’t come without warning, say sportspersons

ROHTAK: In a span of 48 hours, two teenage basketball players died in horrific accidents in Haryana’s Rohtak and Bahadurgarh after hoop poles collapsed on them, turning courts into crime scenes and throwing aharsh spotlight on Haryana’s sports infrastructure and governance. District sports officer Anoop Singh has been suspended.A heart-wrenching CCTV video captured the death of 16-year-old schoolboy Hardik Rathi — a fivetime state player, selected for the U-17 School Nationals in Chhattisgarh — in Lakhan Majra, near Rohtak, on Tuesday.In the 9-second clip, he runs in from the three-point line, simulates a dunk, and grabs the hoop for a second — acommon habit with players. Even in the grainy footage, one can see the horror in his eyes when the 750kg pole snaps, takes him down, and crushes his ribs.Other players sprinted to Hardik’s aid and took him to hospital where he was declared ‘brought dead’. At Lakhan Majra, there is anguish & anger over the “avoidable tragedy”. Just two days earlier, there was an ominous warning when 15-year-old Aman, a Class 10 student, died in similar fashion at Bahadurgarh’s Shaheed Brigadier Hoshiar Singh stadium, some 65km from Lakhan Majra.Aman was practising on Sunday afternoon when a corroded basketball pole gave way & crashed onto his abdomen, causing severe internal injuries.The pole had allegedly been in a dilapidated condition for a long time.He was taken to the civil hospital and then to PGI-Rohtak. His family alleged that delay and negligence in treatment worsened his condition. The boy died on Monday night and his last rites were performed on Tuesday evening — when Lakhan Majra was mourning Hardik.Hardik had won a silver at the 47th Sub-Junior National Basketball Championship in Kangra, a bronze at the 49th Sub-Junior Nationals in Hyderabad and another bronze at the 39th Youth National Championship in Puducherry.Villagers and sportspersons point out the tragedy did not come without warnings. Four years ago, then Rajya Sabha MP Deepender Hooda had sanctioned Rs 11 lakh from his MPLAD fund to the Lakhan Majra panchayat for the stadium but maintenance wasn’t carried out as the tender formalities were stuck for years. A delegation met CM Nayab Saini about three months ago on this, and the tender was finally floated last week —too late for Hardik.The Lakhan Majra stadium is under the village panchayat, and a sports nursery has been running on the basketball court for a long time. After Hardik’s death, this nursery has been shut, and a committee has been formed to probe the incident and audit sports equipment. Police have seized the CCTV footage & initiated action under BNS.Shaken by the twin deaths, the Olympic association has announced that no sports event will be held in the state for the next three days. Sports minister Gaurav Gautam has called a high-level meeting on Nov 28 at Panchkula’s Tau Devi Lal Stadium with all district sports officers and senior officials to review accountability lapses, safety protocols and urgent reforms.The sports department has ordered immediate removal of all rusted, old and dangerous equipment across the state. A circular issued by the director general directed all sports officers, Motilal Nehru School of Sports in Rai, and deputy directors across Ambala, Hisar, Rohtak and Gurgaon to carry out urgent inspections and dismantle unsafe structures without delay.The deaths triggered a severe political backlash. Former CM Bhupinder Singh Hooda accused BJP govt in Haryana of treating sports and athletes “like enemies”. “Govt negligence led to the death of two promising young players. Hardik was a national-level player with a bright future, having already signed with a club in the United States,” he said.","Two teenage basketball players died in horrific accidents in haryana’s rohtak and bahadurgarh after hoop poles collapsed on them.

Who is Myles Garrett’s girlfriend Chloe Kim? The Olympic icon behind the NFL star’s new romance,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/who-is-myles-garretts-girlfriend-chloe-kim-the-olympic-icon-behind-the-nfl-stars-new-romance/articleshow/125602046.cms,"Cleveland Browns star Myles Garrett and Olympic snowboarding champion Chloe Kim have confirmed their relationship, sparking fan interest. Kim, a two-time gold medalist, is celebrated for her talent and authentic personality. Their union highlights a rare, genuine support between elite athletes in different sports, with both pursuing their respective careers with mutual admiration.

A look at Chloe Kim’s life, accomplishments, and the relationship dynamic with Myles Garrett

For months, NFL fans and Olympic followers speculated whether Myles Garrett had finally found someone who could match his competitive fire and now the answer is very clear. The Cleveland Browns superstar and two-time Olympic gold medalist Chloe Kim have gone public, sealing their relationship with a sweet kiss caught on video during the Browns’ Nov. 25 game.But beyond the affectionate moment and the cameras, fans really want to know: who exactly is Chloe Kim, the woman capturing the heart of one of the NFL’s most dominant defensive players? Far from being just a supportive girlfriend in the stands, Chloe is a global sports powerhouse with her own legacy, molded by talent, cultural impact, and a fiercely authentic personality.Chloe Kim isn’t simply “the athlete dating an NFL player”, she’s one of the most celebrated female Olympians of her generation. A Southern California native, Chloe became the youngest woman to ever win Olympic halfpipe gold at just 17, and later added a second gold medal to her name, cementing herself as a snowboarding legend. Her grounded personality, humility, and witty online presence, like her playful “rawr XD. ” Instagram caption, have made her beloved among Gen Z fans.What's particularly compelling about the Chloe–Myles pairing is that both are elite athletes in completely different worlds.Myles just broke his single-season sack record, and Chloe is currently preparing to compete in the 2026 Winter Olympics. Instead of existing in competitive tension, their careers seem to complement one another.Chloe has spoken about how gaming helps her reconnect with her inner child and keep stress in check, noting, “I think having a love for gaming is everything to me…” and adding, “even my boyfriend, he’s so good at video games.” That playful intimacy combined with mutual respect is exactly why the relationship resonates with fans.It’s rare to see two high-profile athletes at the peak of their careers so genuinely supportive of each other, publicly yet authentically. As Chloe heads toward Italy for Olympic competition and Myles continues his pursuit of NFL greatness, this relationship feels rooted not in spotlight, not in hype, but in admiration and shared joy.Also Read: Aaron Rodgers’ secret marriage mystery grows louder as even family admits they’ve never met his wife","Cleveland browns star myles garrett and olympic snowboarding champion chloe kim have confirmed their relationship.

"Connor McDavid demands accountability from entire Oilers roster, refusing to scapegoat goalies for ugly defeat",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/connor-mcdavid-demands-accountability-from-entire-oilers-roster-refusing-to-scapegoat-goalies-for-ugly-defeat/articleshow/125602189.cms,"Connor McDavid breaks silence on Edmonton’s goaltending woes (Getty Images)

Connor McDavid defends Oilers goaltending



The Edmonton Oilers were left stunned after being ripped apart 8 to 3 by the Dallas Stars, and the defeat revealed a level of defensive chaos that Edmonton cannot ignore. The loss was not just another bad night. It was a major warning siren. Every breakdown was on display, from lazy zone exits to blown assignments, and it showed a team that still has not learned from repeated failures this season. What made the aftermath even more compelling was how Connor McDavid chose to respond, not with blame, but with accountability.He stood in front of the cameras and refused to allow anyone to point the finger at the easiest target. The goaltenders were exposed, often abandoned, and McDavid reminded everyone that a goalie cannot save a game when the team offers no support. He has seen enough seasons and enough collapses to recognize where the issues truly lie.McDavid spoke directly to the topic of blame swirling around the goalie room. He said, ""I really feel like goaltending is a team thing. It's tough for goalies to look good when the group in front of them is not playing well."" It was a short statement, but it cut to the core. Odd man rushes, lost puck battles, and unchecked forwards crashing the crease will bury any goalie.On Tuesday, both Stuart Skinner and Calvin Pickard were left exposed, stranded without support or structure.McDavid doubled down when he added, ""I don't really care who it is; when the team in front of them is not playing up to their standards, it's tough for a goalie to look good. I felt bad for both of them tonight."" That is leadership in its purest form. Instead of throwing his goaltenders under the bus, he pulled them back inside and placed the responsibility where it belonged: on the entire roster.This is not a one time issue. Edmonton has now allowed seven or more goals in a game for the third time this season. Each time, the result has been inevitable. Calls are growing louder for a major move in net, but McDavid redirected the narrative. It is not just about swapping out a goalie. It is about fixing the system in front of him.The Oilers are in a season that feels like a loop of the same lessons. They have the talent to dominate, but talent without commitment is wasted. If they want to make a real push, they must protect their net, play with urgency in the defensive zone, and help the man in the crease instead of leaving him alone to drown.Also Read: Two-time Stanley Cup champion urges Auston Matthews to carry the Maple Leafs through turbulent Eastern Conference storm","Connor mcdavid breaks silence on edmonton’s goaltending woes.

NHL updates: Auston Matthews returns to Toronto Maple Leafs lineup after two-week injury absence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/nhl-updates-auston-matthews-returns-to-toronto-maple-leafs-lineup-after-two-week-injury-absence/articleshow/125596836.cms,"Auston Matthews (Image Via Twitter)

How Auston Matthews’ return could impact Toronto Maple Leafs’ season



At last, the Toronto Maple Leafs are receiving a bit of good news. Forward Auston Matthews has announced that he will play when the team meets the Columbus Blue Jackets on Wednesday night. Matthews has been out for almost two weeks because of a lower-body injury sustained during a match with the Boston Bruins on November 11, after being hit hard by Bruins defenseman Nikita Zadorov. The captain's absence has been particularly hard on the team, as Toronto's record in his five-game absence is 1-2-2, including a tough 5-2 loss to the Montreal Canadiens last Saturday.Besides, Matthews also came back to the ice along with other prominent players. Forwards Matthew Knies and Nicolas Roy are going to get back on the team after each of them has been on the sidelines for three games due to lower-body injuries. The presence of these players is believed to energize the Leafs, who are battling through a hard start to the 2025-26 season. At present, Toronto is in the unfortunate position of being the only Eastern Conference team with a record below .500, and thus at the bottom of the East.The return of Matthews is their hope to regain their momentum and to find the spark that would take them up the standings.At just 28 years old, Matthews is already one of the most reliable players on the Toronto team. He scored nine times and assisted five times, totaling 14 points in 17 games this season, which made him the third-best goal-scorer and sixth-best point-getter on the team. His reappearance, along with Knies and Roy, could mean a reshuffling of the top line, possibly with Matthews on one side and Knies on the other, along with either Calle Jarnkrok or Nicholas Robertson. The scoring potential is definitely increased with Matthews on the ice; moreover, he is a source of guidance and firmness for a unit that has been plagued by injuries. In the past, the durability of Matthews has been an issue, as he played 81 games only once in his 69-goal 2023-24 season and 75 games only during his rookie season in 2016-17.The Leafs may be able to reverse their season’s direction with the trio of Matthews, Knies, and Roy in their line-up. While this star group is assumed to be the reason why the team slowly advances in the Eastern Conference standings, the audience can already see a new and strong team taking the ice for their entertainment.Aiso Read: Vancouver Canucks considering trades as Montreal Canadiens show interest in Ryan O’Reilly",Auston matthews has announced that he will play when the team meets the columbus blue jackets on wednesday night.

Omarion Hampton may return for the Week 13 matchup against the Las Vegas Raiders

More coverage on Los Angeles Chargers:

Omarion Hampton seemed confident for a breakout season with the Los Angeles Chargers, ready to step up after Najee Harris’ devastating season-ending Achilles injury. Hampton made a strong impression in his first five games of the 2025 season. The rookie running back enthralled fans, accumulating 66 carries for 314 yards and two touchdowns, plus 20 catches for 136 yards. Then, just as his charm was rising, calamity struck. An ankle injury during the Week 5 battle with the Washington Commanders brought his ever-growing momentum to a screaming stop. Spotted in a walking boot after the game, Hampton’s injury proved severe enough to land him on injured reserve. Though the initial expectation was a four-game absence, he ended up missing six straight games, with a bye week extending his absence even further.Now the sun is shining on the rookie’s cloud. The Chargers might soon welcome their young star back, even though Kimani Vidal took his role. NFL Insider Adam Schefter reported that Los Angeles head coach Jim Harbaugh announced that the practice window for first-round pick Omarion Hampton has been opened.The team had said this window would remain closed until after the Week 12 bye, but now Hampton has a chance to play in Week 13 against the Las Vegas Raiders. He has three weeks to prove he is ready to return.Hampton is supposedly crucial to the Chargers. Without him, they are 4-2 this season. However, the team’s inconsistent running game has not stopped quarterback Justin Herbert from delivering his absolute best. Or is it the supposed Madison Beer effect? Herbert’s hard work, combined with supposed lucky charm, has him throwing multiple touchdowns in four of the last six games. In 11 matchups, he has recorded 19 unbelievable touchdowns and nine interceptions. He ranks second in team rushing with 345 yards, just behind Kimani Vidal’s 417 yards.The rookie running back in question, who may return in a couple of weeks, has 314 yards in just five games. He could become the team’s leading rusher, surpassing Vidal and Herbert. But does that mean Vidal will be sidelined after Hampton’s return? Maybe not, since the 2024 sixth-round pick had 96 carries for 417 yards and two touchdowns while the rookie was out. His role may shrink, but he is unlikely to disappear from the spotlight entirely.","Omarion hampton has been out since week 5 with an ankle injury.

What to Expect from tonight’s Milwaukee Bucks vs Miami Heat (November 26, 2025)

’ matchup against the Miami Heat on November 26, 2025, has become one of the biggest storylines of the NBA Cup schedule. With Milwaukee on a downward slide and Miami surging, the Greek Freak’s potential return carries massive implications for both the game and the Bucks’ immediate future. His absence has highlighted the team’s vulnerabilities, making tonight’s availability decision even more crucial.This NBA Cup group stage duel features two teams trending in opposite directions, amplifying the stakes. Miami enters red-hot with elite defensive performances and renewed scoring depth, while Milwaukee continues to struggle without its franchise cornerstone. Whether Giannis suits up or not could determine how competitive the Bucks will be in a matchup that may influence their tournament hopes and shape the momentum of their regular season.Giannis Antetokounmpo remains officially listed as questionable due to a left adductor strain suffered on November 17 during a game against the Cleveland Cavaliers. The injury was later confirmed through MRI testing as a low-grade left groin strain, carrying an estimated recovery timeline of one to two weeks. He has already missed the last three games, all losses for Milwaukee, deepening the team’s early-season challenges.In encouraging news for the Bucks, Giannis Antetokounmpo recently completed a full pregame workout without any setbacks. The session boosted optimism within the organization, raising hopes that he could return for tonight’s crucial contest. However, the coaching staff continues to approach his ramp-up cautiously. Head coach Doc Rivers expressed confidence that the injury is not a long-term concern and emphasized that the priority is ensuring Giannis returns at full strength rather than rushing him back prematurely.Milwaukee Bucks’ recent performances paint a clear picture of the team’s dependence on Giannis. The Bucks have dropped five straight games during his absence and have struggled to generate consistent offensive production. Young guard Ryan Rollins has been one of the few bright spots, posting career highs in scoring and assists while taking on an expanded role. Even so, the team currently sits below .500 and finds itself outside the Eastern Conference play-in picture.The combination of offensive stagnation and weakened defensive presence has underscored how vital Giannis Antetokounmpo is to the team’s identity. As the Bucks navigate this difficult stretch, each game becomes increasingly important to avoid falling deeper in the standings.Tonight’s game represents a pivotal moment in Milwaukee’s season. The Heat arrive with the league’s top defensive rating and one of the best scoring outputs, bolstered even further by the recent return of Tyler Herro. Their five-game winning streak demonstrates a team firing on all cylinders.Also read: Is LaMelo Ball playing tonight vs the New York Knicks?

A meaningful night that blended old friendships, new family connections, and growing anticipation

Just hours after the Chiefs’ overtime win against the Colts, Travis Kelce hosted a private, intimate dinner at his brand-new 1587 Prime Steakhouse. This wasn’t a typical victory meal, as it brought together his fiancée Taylor Swift, Kelce’s family, and longtime friends in a setting that felt much closer to a symbolic “rehearsal” dinner than a casual night out.With Uncle Don helping arrange the reservation and Swift jokingly calling his college crew the “Purdudes,” the event sent fans buzzing about just how intertwined the two families have become.

She wrote, “My Dad said it was 'one of the greatest weekends of my entire life!!!’” highlighting the blend of football excitement, time with Donna Kelce, and the unforgettable stadium experience.She added that the Arrowhead tour, time with “Mama Kelce,” and celebrating the nail-biter win with the Swifts created a sense of revived youthful joy for the men who first became friends in the 1970s. Her message also offered a wink to Swift fans who spent days wondering about the older men Taylor embraced during the game: “And now the mystery is solved for all the Swifties as to who the 'old guys' are…”What was meant to be a simple post-game dinner evolved into something far more symbolic—a night where two worlds blended effortlessly, deepening the impression that Swift and Kelce are moving with intention toward their future together.Also read: Travis Kelce flashes luxury $500,00 Rolex ahead of Chiefs' huge victory over Indianapolis Colts","Travis kelce hosted a private, intimate dinner at his brand-new 1587 prime steakhouse.
