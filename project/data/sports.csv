Erin Andrews on managing a hectic career while adjusting to the realities of motherhood

Episode 312: CAN YOU GIVE ME A MINUTE?! | Calm Down Podcast

Erin Andrews on juggling a successful broadcasting career, a growing business, and motherhood

Renowned sports broadcaster Erin Andrews is no stranger to navigating a demanding career while balancing personal responsibilities. However, during a recent episode of the Calm Down podcast, Andrews got emotional as she reflected on what she described as an incredibly difficult year juggling work, motherhood, and her personal life.As a veteran Fox Sports reporter, Andrews has spent years covering the NFL with relentless dedication. But now, as a mother to nearly 2-year-old Mack—whom she shares with husband and former NHL player Jarret Stoll—she’s finding that the demands of her career and family life are harder to balance than ever.“It’s really hard, it really is,” Erin Andrews admitted during a live taping of her podcast with co-host Charissa Thompson. “My better half [Stoll] works in the hockey world, and so his season is going on at the same time. This was a really, really hard year. I’m going to get emotional about it.”Andrews recalled that during Mack’s first year as a newborn, it was easier to leave for work. But now, as he grows older and more aware of her departures, the emotional toll has increased. “I had this attitude like, ‘I have this career and this is how it’s going to be.’ And then he starts talking and realizing you’re leaving, and it was just really, really hard.”Beyond her broadcasting career, Andrews is also deeply involved in her clothing line, WEAR by Erin Andrews, making her schedule even more demanding. She shared how she often felt like she wasn’t giving enough to any aspect of her life.“I would just have multiple meltdowns with Charissa saying, ‘I feel like I’m not giving 100 percent of myself to my son, or my job, or my clothing line, and I feel like I am barely above water,’” Andrews revealed. “And then your relationships start to suffer.”She admitted that the intensity of the football season kept her from seeing friends and maintaining personal connections. Once the season ended, she looked back and thought, “I don’t know… excuse me, how the f–k I did that.”Reflecting on the past year, Andrews recognized the need to be kinder to herself. “I need to go easier on myself, and I’ve realized that. I was so worried I wasn’t giving all of myself to both things that I was doing the best I could, and everybody’s fine. I just need to give myself a little grace.”Her openness about the struggles of working motherhood resonates with many, especially those juggling high-pressure careers with raising children. As she moves into the next NFL season, Andrews hopes to apply the lessons she’s learned, prioritizing balance and self-compassion.Also Read: Taylor Swift’s iHeartRadio speech hides a secret—Fans think they’ve uncovered it Her journey, marked by resilience and honesty, continues to inspire, proving that even the most accomplished women face the challenge of finding harmony between career and family.","Erin andrews is a veteran fox sports reporter and mother to nearly 2-year-old mack.

SQUADS:

Sunrisers Hyderabad:

Rajasthan Royals:

NEW DELHI: Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) will start as favourites against Rajasthan Royals (RR) in their opening Indian Premier League (IPL) match at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium on Sunday. Armed with a balanced squad featuring powerful hitters like Travis Head, Abhishek Sharma, Ishan Kishan and Heinrich Klaasen, SRH are well-equipped to post a massive total on the batting-friendly track. The return of all-rounder Nitish Kumar Reddy after injury adds more depth to their lineup.Abhishek Sharma’s recent form is a significant boost, as he smashed 135 off just 54 balls against England in his last T20I appearance. With such explosive capabilities, SRH could potentially set the much-anticipated 300-run record if they bat first. Last season, they breached the 250-run mark thrice, including 287 against Royal Challengers Bangalore and 277 versus Mumbai Indians.Captain Pat Cummins and Mohammed Shami lead SRH’s experienced pace attack, supported by spinner Adam Zampa. In contrast, Rajasthan Royals look underwhelming, especially without their captain Sanju Samson, who is nursing a finger injury. Riyan Parag will lead in Samson’s absence, but the Royals’ bowling lacks depth beyond Jofra Archer.SRH dominated both encounters with RR last season, winning narrowly in the league stage and comfortably in Qualifier 2. With momentum and firepower on their side, SRH appear poised to continue their dominance.The match between Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) and Rajasthan Royals (RR) will take place at Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium, Hyderabad.The highly anticipated clash is scheduled for Sunday, March 23.The match will begin at 3:30 PM IST, with the toss at 3:00 PM IST.The match will be broadcast live on the JioStar Network.Fans in India can stream the match live on the JioHotstar app.Pat Cummins (c), Travis Head, Ishan Kishan, Heinrich Klaasen, Abhishek Sharma, Sachin Baby, Mohammed Shami, Adam Zampa, Aniket Verma, Abhinav Manohar, Rahul Chahar, Eshan Malinga, Harshal Patel, Kamindu Mendis, Wiaan Mulder, Nitish Kumar Reddy, Atharva Taide, Brydon Carse, Simarjeet Singh, Jaydev Unadkat, Zeeshan Ansari.Riyan Parag (c), Sanju Samson, Shubham Dubey, Shimron Hetmyer, Yashasvi Jaiswal, Dhruv Jurel, Nitish Rana, Kunal Singh Rathore, Vaibhav Suryavanshi, Wanindu Hasaranga, Jofra Archer, Ashok Sharma, Tushar Deshpande, Fazalhaq Farooqi, Kumar Kartikeya, Akash Madhwal, Kwena Maphaka, Sandeep Sharma, Maheesh Theekshana, Yudhvir Singh.","Sunrisers hyderabad (srh) will start as favourites against rajasthan royals (rr) in their opening indian premier league (ipl) match at the rajiv gandhi international stadium, hyderabad.

Sunrisers Hyderabad will open their campaign against Rajasthan Royals in the second match of the Indian Premier League season 18 today. It is the first double-header of IPL 2025 with the evening fixture taking place at Chepauk between Chennai Super Kings and Mumbai Indians. Before that, though, the focus will be on the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Hyderabad.Sunrisers have some of the most explosive batters in their line-up in Travis Head, Abhishek Sharma, Ishan Kishan and Heinrich Klaasen, and with a belter of a track likely to offer, they would fancy a massive total in the afternoon match.Sunrisers posted 250-plus totals three times last season, including 287 against Royal Challengers Bengaluru in an away match and 277 against Mumbai Indians at home. The explosive duo of Abhishek and Head scored the highest IPL powerplay total of 125 against Delhi Capitals in the third instance when they posted 266.In fact, if any team can get to the much talked about 300-run total after batting first, it is Sunrisers that is expected to achieve the feat with the firepower they have.Rajasthan are under new leadership with Riyan Parag having been named as the stand-in captain for the first three matches as full-time skipper Sanju Samson is still recovering from an injury.Samson, though not cleared to wicketkeeper or field yet, can still play a part as a specialist batter.The batting-friendly pitches at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium produced explosive hitting last season. With Sunrisers retaining their core power-hitters and Rajasthan fielding a formidable top order, fans can brace for another high-scoring spectacle. This ground has been a record-breaking arena over the past year, and more fireworks seem inevitable.SRH Predicted Playing XI: Abhishek Sharma, Travis Head, Ishan Kishan, Nitish Reddy, Heinrich Klaasen, Abhinav Manohar, Sachin Baby/Aniket Verma, Pat Cummins, Harshal Patel, Adam Zampa, Mohammed Shami.Impact Sub: Rahul Chahar/Jaydev Unadkat.RR Predicted Playing XI: Yashasvi Jaiswal, Sanju Samson, Nitish Rana, Riyan Parag, Shimron Hetmyer, Dhruv Jurel (wk), Shubham Dubey, Wanindu Hasaranga, Jofra Archer, Sandeep Sharma, Fazalhaq Farooqi.Impact Sub: Kumar Kartikeya/Tushar Deshpande.Sunrisers Hyderabad: Abhishek Sharma, Travis Head, Ishan Kishan, Nitish Kumar Reddy, Heinrich Klaasen(w), Abhinav Manohar, Sachin Baby, Pat Cummins(c), Harshal Patel, Adam Zampa, Mohammed Shami, Rahul Chahar, Jaydev Unadkat, Kamindu Mendis, Zeeshan Ansari, Wiaan Mulder, Atharva Taide, Simarjeet Singh, Eshan Malinga, Aniket Verma.Rajasthan Royals: Yashasvi Jaiswal, Sanju Samson, Nitish Rana, Riyan Parag(c), Shimron Hetmyer, Dhruv Jurel(w), Shubham Dubey, Wanindu Hasaranga, Jofra Archer, Tushar Deshpande, Sandeep Sharma, Fazalhaq Farooqi, Kumar Kartikeya, Akash Madhwal, Yudhvir Singh Charak, Maheesh Theekshana, Kwena Maphaka, Ashok Sharma, Vaibhav Suryavanshi, Kunal Singh Rathore.Sunrisers Hyderabad and Rajasthan Royals have squared off 20 times in IPL history.

How do Alex Albon and Lily Muni He Keep their relationship strong while always on the move?

GQ

Alex Albon and Lily Muni He didn’t meet in some grand, star-studded way. There was no encounter at a glamorous event, no mutual friends setting them up. Instead, it all started the way plenty of modern relationships do—on social media.Back in 2019, Lily, a professional golfer , was just starting to get into Formula 1 . She had always loved cars, butpulled her into the sport, and soon, she was following a few drivers, including Alex. Meanwhile, Alex had been getting into golf himself. Before long, they took notice of each other and started talking. Then came a trip to L.A., a round of golf, and the beginning of what would become one of F1 ’s most well-known relationships.Lily was born in Chengdu , China, in 1999, but her family moved around quite a bit—first to Vancouver, then to San Diego. By the time she was five, she had a golf club in her hands, and she never really put it down. She turned professional as a teenager and earned her LPGA Tour membership in 2020, but she also sacrificed a lot to get there.“It was difficult growing up being a student athlete ,” she told. “I only had so much time in the day and I tried my best to balance everything.”That kind of dedication is something she and Alex understand about each other. “On top of everything, we understand and we get each other,” Alex told Golfweek. “The highs and lows of being an athlete, I think you can resonate that with any athlete.”Being in a relationship with a professional athlete means spending a lot of time apart, but Alex and Lily have figured out how to make it work. They support each other’s careers, give each other space when needed, and even found a creative way to stay connected—virtual reality golf.“I’m still losing, but I’m losing less,” Alex joked toin 2023.Also Read: The future of women in F1: Will we See a female driver in formula 1 soon?

Alex says he’s improved, though not necessarily thanks to Lily’s coaching. “She doesn’t know where to start with me,” he laughed.It’s not always easy balancing F1 races and golf tournaments, but somehow, they make it work—one virtual game at a time.","Alex albon and lily muni he met on social media.

Lewis Hamilton and Charles Leclerc disqualified from Chinese GP in Ferrari’s latest Formula 1 heartbreak



The Chinese Grand Prix delivered a shocking twist as Ferrari ’s Charles Leclerc and Lewis Hamilton , along with Alpine’s Pierre Gasly, were disqualified for technical infringements. The post-race scrutiny revealed that their cars failed to meet FIA regulations, leading to a major shake-up in the final race classification.During the routine post-race checks, Leclerc and Gasly’s cars were found to weigh 799kg after fuel removal—1kg below the minimum weight requirement. In Leclerc’s case, a damaged front wing had been replaced with a spare during weighing, yet the final measurement still fell short. FIA delegate Jo Bauer noted, “The car was weighed again on the FIA scales (with the official spare front wing assembly of car 16) and the weight was 799.0kg.” This breach of Article 4.1 left no room for mitigation, leading to an immediate referral to the stewards.Hamilton’s disqualification, on the other hand, stemmed from excessive wear on his car’s underbody skid block. Measurements showed the rearmost skid block had worn below the minimum 9mm thickness, registering values between 8.5mm and 8.6mm. The FIA’s report clarified, “The recorded measurement was 8.6mm (LHS), 8.6mm (car centerline) and 8.5mm (RHS).” As a result, Hamilton’s car was deemed non-compliant under Article 3.5.9, sealing his disqualification.Ferrari’s hopes for a strong finish in Shanghai were crushed as both Hamilton and Leclerc lost their hard-earned fifth and sixth places, stripping them of 18 crucial points. While Gasly had finished outside the top ten in 11th, his disqualification added to Alpine’s woes.Interestingly, this is not the first time Hamilton and Leclerc have faced such setbacks. The 2023 United States Grand Prix saw both drivers disqualified for excessive skid wear, further underscoring the fine margins in modern Formula 1 regulations.The race had already been eventful for Ferrari, with Hamilton and Leclerc making contact on the opening lap. The minor clash resulted in damage to Leclerc’s front wing, yet he managed to maintain competitive pace throughout the 56-lap race. Oddly, despite the damage, he displayed superior speed, prompting Ferrari to instruct Hamilton to yield position midway through the race.Leclerc later dismissed the incident, stating, “Honestly, it’s not Lewis’s fault at all… It’s a racing incident, it’s not the first or last time it will happen.” His refusal to change the damaged wing at the pit stop was a calculated gamble, as he explained, “We didn’t want to take the eight seconds to change the wing, didn’t want to take that risk.”With Hamilton, Leclerc, and Gasly’s results nullified, Esteban Ocon surged to a surprising fifth-place finish for Haas. Andrea Kimi Antonelli, Alex Albon, and Oliver Bearman gained valuable positions, while Aston Martin’s Lance Stroll and Williams’ Carlos Sainz moved into the final points-paying spots.Also Read: Emotional tribute to Eddie Jordan brought F1 family together at Chinese Grand Prix This unexpected outcome has delivered a significant blow to Ferrari’s championship ambitions early in the 2025 season.

NEW DELHI: On a day when Rohit Sharma became the second-most capped player in Indian Premier League (IPL) history, he also etched his name into an unwanted record.In Mumbai Indians' season opener against Chennai Super Kings at the MA Chidambaram Stadium on Sunday, Rohit was dismissed for a four-ball duck by pacer Khaleel Ahmed in the very first over.This dismissal marked Rohit’s 18th duck in the IPL, equalling the dubious record held by Dinesh Karthik and Glenn Maxwell for the most ducks in the tournament's history.The dismissal also marked Rohit’s first T20 outing since India’s T20 World Cup 2024 final against South Africa in Barbados.

NEW DELHI: Batting stalwart Virat Kohli achieved another significant milestone in his IPL career on Saturday in the Indian Premier League (IPL) opener at Eden Gardens, completing over 1,000 runs against Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR).During the IPL 2025 season opener, Kohli played a match-winning knock of 59 not out off 36 balls to help Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) chase down a target of 175 set by KKR.This innings not only propelled RCB to a seven-wicket victory but also marked his 1,000+ runs against KKR, further cementing his place as one of the most consistent and prolific batsmen in IPL history.This victory was special for Kohli, as it marked his 1,000+ runs against KKR, one of the four teams he has dominated over the years.The others include CSK, DC, and PBKS, against whom he has also crossed the 1,000-run mark.Kohli, along with Phil Salt, who scored a fiery 56 off 31 balls, formed a solid opening partnership that saw RCB off to a blazing start.The pair added 95 runs for the first wicket in just 8.3 overs, taking the game away from KKR early. Their fast-paced approach made the chase look easy, with RCB reaching the target in just 16.2 overs with 177/3 on the board.Kohli’s composure and ability to adapt to the situation was evident, as he played with calm authority, seeing his side through the chase with crucial boundaries and sixes.Earlier in the match, KKR had set a competitive target, finishing their innings at 174/8. Ajinkya Rahane played a key role with 56 runs, and Sunil Narine provided valuable support with a quickfire 44 off 26 balls.However, RCB’s bowlers, led by Krunal Pandya (3/29) and Josh Hazlewood (2/22), executed a well-structured comeback after KKR’s solid start.Their combined efforts restricted KKR from accelerating in the death overs, leaving them with a target that was always within reach for RCB.As RCB have made a strong start to IPL 2025, Kohli’s contribution on and off the field remains invaluable.","Royal challengers bengaluru (rcb) beat kolkata knight riders (kkr) by seven wickets.

NEW DELHI: Rajasthan Royals pacer Jofra Archer etched his name into the Indian Premier League (IPL) history books for the wrong reasons as he delivered the most expensive spell in the tournament’s history during his side’s 2025 season opener against Sunrisers Hyderabad on Sunday.The English speedster was hammered for a staggering 76 runs in his four-over spell at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Hyderabad.Archer’s forgettable performance broke the previous record held by Mohit Sharma, who conceded 73 runs in four overs for Gujarat Titans against Delhi Capitals in 2024.

This record-breaking spell left the Royals reeling, as they failed to contain the explosive batting display from the hosts.Sunrisers Hyderabad continued their ruthless assault, amassing a mammoth total of 286 for 6 in 20 overs. This became the second-highest team total in IPL history, only behind their own record of 287 for 3 against Royal Challengers Bengaluru in 2024. Ishan Kishan led the charge with a blistering century off just 45 deliveries, while Travis Head, Nitish Kumar Reddy, and Heinrich Klaasen contributed with quickfire knocks, following the same aggressive template.The Royals’ bowling unit had no answers to the SRH batting onslaught.

This explosive performance comes hot on the heels of their record-breaking 287/3 against RCB last season.Opening the innings, Abhishek Sharma wasted no time setting the tone, hammering 24 off just 11 balls.Travis Head followed up with a brutal 67 off 31, featuring nine fours and three sixes.But the real carnage came from Ishan Kishan, who lit up the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium with a sensational 106 not out off 47 balls, striking 11 fours and six sixes at a jaw-dropping strike rate of 225.53.Supporting knocks from Nitish Kumar Reddy (30 off 15) and Heinrich Klaasen (34 off 14) ensured SRH never lost momentum.Even as wickets fell in the death overs, the scoreboard kept ticking, with SRH smashing 94 runs in the powerplay and finishing just one run short of their own all-time IPL record.Rajasthan Royals’ bowling unit found no answers. Jofra Archer bore the brunt of the onslaught, conceding a brutal 76 in his four overs -- the most expensive spell of the day. Tushar Deshpande was the only bowler to escape somewhat unscathed, picking up 3 for 44.This is now SRH’s fourth 260+ total in the last two IPL seasons, underlining their transformation into the league’s most fearsome batting unit.Chasing 287 is virtually uncharted territory, but RR will need to go all guns blazing. With a lightning-fast outfield and plenty of firepower in their ranks, the Royals have no option but to swing for the fences.","Sunrisers hyderabad posted 286/6 against rajasthan royals on sunday.

As Delhi Capitals (DC) and Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) prepare to clash in their opening Indian Premier League 2025 match on Monday, both teams face fresh challenges under new leadership and revamped squads. The Dr YS Rajasekhara Reddy ACA-VDCA Stadium will host the encounter as DC’s temporary home venue for two matches this season.One of the most anticipated storylines is Rishabh Pant ’s move to LSG for a staggering Rs 27 crore during the mega auction.

Instead, the leadership mantle has been passed to Axar Patel , despite the presence of experienced candidates like Faf du Plessis.DC boasts a balanced lineup featuring the experience of du Plessis and the pace of Mitchell Starc , who recently joined after missing the Champions Trophy. The middle order looks formidable with the likes of Karun Nair, Tristan Stubbs, Sameer Rizvi, Ashutosh Sharma, and Rahul. The bowling unit is equally strong, with spin spearheaded by Axar Patel and Kuldeep Yadav, while pacers T Natarajan, Mohit Sharma, Mukesh Kumar, and Dushmantha Chameera add depth.LSG, meanwhile, relies on domestic talent alongside overseas stars such as Mitchell Marsh, David Miller, Aiden Markram, and Nicholas Pooran. The team faces challenges with limited overseas availability and Indian pacers Mayank Yadav, Avesh Khan, and Akash Deep currently in rehabilitation.Shardul Thakur bolsters LSG’s bowling strength following his impressive Ranji Trophy performances, replacing the injured Mohsin Khan.
