Gossip swirled around Paulina Gretzky, Dustin Johnson, and Brooks Koepka ahead of the 2018 Ryder Cup

Koepka and Johnson both deny any conflict, call rumors baseless



Back in 2018, ahead of what would become a disappointing Ryder Cup for Team USA, a swirling controversy involving Dustin Johnson , Brooks Koepka , and Johnson’s now-wife Paulina Gretzky threatened to overshadow the golf itself. Though both Johnson and Koepka have denied any fallout, rumors from that time continue to resurface — and Gretzky remains a central figure in the alleged drama.According to reports from Golf Digest and L’Equipe, tensions allegedly flared during the team’s flight to Paris. Sources speculated that Koepka was “comforting” Gretzky during a rough patch in her relationship with Johnson. That claim was never substantiated, but an anonymous source described the atmosphere in the U.S. locker room as “horrible” for the rest of the trip. The Americans were defeated 17.5-10.5 by a united European team.Koepka, speaking at the Alfred Dunhill Championship, firmly pushed back against the narrative. “This Dustin thing, I don't get. There was no fight, no argument. He is one of my best friends,” Koepka said. “We talked on the phone on Monday and yesterday so tell me how we fought? I don't know. People like to make a story and run with it.”Dustin Johnson, who married Gretzky in 2022 after years of ups and downs, also took to social media to clarify their situation at the time. “Every relationship goes through its ups and downs, but most importantly, we love each other very much and are committed to being a family. Thank you for your love and support.”In 2025, both Koepka and Johnson find themselves facing challenges on the course. Johnson needed a special exemption to enter Quail Hollow, having missed the cut at Augusta. Koepka, meanwhile, skipped the champions dinner and opened with a disappointing 4-over 75.Also Read: Wayne Gretzky's son Ty Gretzky shows favouritism, backs Rick Tocchet's return as Flyers head coach with enthusiastic message While neither made the cut at this year's PGA Championship, the old rumors serve as a reminder of how off-course speculation can sometimes eclipse the game itself — even for golf’s biggest names.","Gossip swirled around paulina gretzky, dustin johnson, and brooks koepka ahead of the 2018 ryder cup.

Rahul Dravid reflects on RR's narrow losses: 'One or two hits away in every game'

Poll Do you believe Shreyas Iyer will continue his successful captaincy in the upcoming matches? No, I doubt it. Yes, definitely!

NEW DELHI: Nehal Wadhera and Shashank Singh struck fluent half-centuries, while left-arm spinner Harpreet Brar picked up three crucial wickets as Punjab Kings defeated Rajasthan Royals by 10 runs on Sunday to seal a spot in the IPL 2025 playoffs. The win took Punjab to 17 points — level with Royal Challengers Bengaluru — but RCB retained second place thanks to a better net run rate.Leading PBKS in his debut season with the franchise, Shreyas Iyer etched his name in the IPL record books by becoming the first player to captain three different teams into the playoffs. He had earlier led Delhi Capitals in 2019 and 2020, and Kolkata Knight Riders in 2024, before repeating the feat with Punjab this season.Overall, Iyer is only the fifth player to lead three different IPL franchises, joining the likes of Steve Smith (Rajasthan Royals, Pune Warriors India, Rising Pune Supergiant), Kumar Sangakkara (Punjab Kings, Deccan Chargers, Sunrisers Hyderabad), Mahela Jayawardene (Punjab Kings, Kochi Tuskers Kerala, Delhi Capitals), and Ajinkya Rahane (Rajasthan Royals, Rising Pune Supergiant, Kolkata Knight Riders).Among them, only Iyer and Sangakkara have led all three sides on a full-time basis.Batting first, Punjab piled up a daunting 219 for 5, powered by Wadhera’s blistering 70 off 37 balls, Shashank’s unbeaten 59, and a handy 30 from captain Iyer.In reply, Rajasthan came out all guns blazing, with openers Yashasvi Jaiswal (50) and Vaibhav Suryavanshi (40) adding 76 runs in just 4.5 overs. But Brar (3/22) provided the breakthrough by removing Suryavanshi in the fifth over, triggering a steady fall of wickets.

Dustin Johnson jokes about 'lifting a bigger kid' while explaining previous back injury

Struggles on the LIV circuit and fading Ryder Cup hopes

Dustin Johnson, one of golf’s most enigmatic and successful players, recently opened up in a way few professional athletes do—mixing humor with candor while addressing a back injury that once sparked plenty of headlines. As the 2025 PGA Championship unfolded, Johnson's performance—marked by a disappointing 12-over finish and a missed cut at Quail Hollow—wasn't the only thing fans were talking about.Last season, Johnson was forced to sit out part of the golf calendar due to a lower back injury. When asked whether the injury occurred while swinging a club or lifting a child, Johnson slyly responded, “Yeah, lifting up a kid, just a bigger kid,” with a grin—clearly referring to his wife, Paulina Gretzky . The remark instantly sent ripples of laughter through the press room. One surprised journalist exclaimed, “I’m done!” while another added, “I don’t know how to follow that up.”While playful in delivery, Johnson’s comment shed light on how personal life and professional sport often overlap. The two-time major champion emphasized that the injury wasn’t golf-related, sidestepping a deeper explanation while still offering a headline-worthy moment.Despite entering the PGA Championship healthy, Johnson has struggled to regain his top form in recent years. His LIV Golf performances have lacked the dominance he once displayed on the PGA Tour , and his fading visibility has reportedly impacted his standing with Team USA’s Ryder Cup selection.Reflecting on a slow start to last season, Johnson shared, “I was ready at the start... I tweaked my back right before [Saudi International]. So I didn’t hit balls for a few weeks… just taken me a while to get back.” He admitted he developed “some bad habits,” but remains optimistic: “Swinging it well, feeling good, got confidence.”Also Read: Why the NHL never wanted Wayne Gretzky's son Ty Gretzky— even with the name Johnson and Gretzky have been together since 2013, engaged the same year, and married in 2022.

Aaron Rodgers to Steelers a done deal already?

Insider who penned Aaron Rodgers’ life says Pittsburgh could soon land the legendary QB



The Pittsburgh Steelers might be on the cusp of one of the most fascinating quarterback acquisitions in recent NFL memory. As the Aaron Rodgers saga unfolds, fans and insiders alike are bracing for what could be a transformative chapter in both the franchise's future and Rodgers' storied career. According to Out of the Darkness author Ian O’Connor—Rodgers' biographer and longtime friend—there’s a strong belief that a deal is imminent, and it could all culminate before the start of the Steelers’ mandatory minicamp.“I do think there will be a happy ending, at least for him and we will find out for the Steelers and their fan base,” O'Connor shared in a recent appearance on 93.7 The Fan. “If I had $100 to put down, my feeling is he will be in uniform June 10th, for the start of the mandatory minicamp.”O’Connor’s insights carry weight. He interviewed more than 250 individuals for his 2024 biography on Rodgers and maintains close ties with the quarterback. His conviction about the move isn’t rooted in guesswork—it's shaped by Rodgers’ own behind-the-scenes messaging to Pittsburgh. O’Connor mentioned that Rodgers has signaled his intent to play for the Steelers but has been delaying the official move due to unresolved personal matters.“He’s told [the Steelers], ‘Listen, I’m gonna play for you. I just don’t want to go there and then miss part of mandatory minicamp because of my personal issues. I’m pretty sure they’re gonna be solved by the end of May, at least in my satisfaction where I can give you my all,’” O’Connor explained.These personal issues, which Rodgers acknowledged in his only public remarks this offseason, reportedly involve someone close to him. While O’Connor opted not to reveal specifics, he clarified, “The sense I got was, I think I have a pretty good sense of what it is, and I don’t think it’s something that would prevent him from playing football.”From a football standpoint, Rodgers would be a clear upgrade for the Steelers, especially over Mason Rudolph. While Pittsburgh’s offense may not be overflowing with elite talent, Rodgers is the type of quarterback who can elevate the players around him. With weapons like DK Metcalf, Pat Freiermuth, Calvin Austin, and Robert Woods, the veteran’s presence could unlock a new dimension for the Steelers’ attack.O'Connor is optimistic—not just about the fit, but about the outcome. “Do I think the Steelers are going to win the Super Bowl? No, but if you told me 11-6 with at least one playoff victory, the first with that franchise since 2016, I think that's realistic. I think that this could be a success story, and certainly a worthy ending for him.”For Rodgers, a move to Pittsburgh wouldn’t just be about chasing a Super Bowl. It would be about redemption. His brief, injury-marred stint with the Jets was widely viewed as a disappointment. “He knows it was an embarrassment in New York largely, and he’s the face of that embarrassment,” O’Connor said. A strong run in Pittsburgh could rewrite the narrative and offer Rodgers a satisfying final act—one that proves Act II wasn’t his final bow.With OTAs set to begin in just over a week and the 2025 NFL schedule now revealed, timing seems to be aligning perfectly. If the deal materializes, expect a press conference in Pittsburgh soon—ushering in what might be Rodgers' last, and potentially most poetic, NFL chapter.Also Read: Eagles star calls Ivanka Trump “beautiful,” and she responds with a special locker room message","Ian o'connor, aaron rodgers' biographer, says a deal could soon be done.

Bombay Sport Exchange Ep 5: Shane Watson on how IPL gave him a lifeline & his tribute to Phil Hughes

One of the criticisms against Sarfaraz Khan has always been that he has been too overweight — many have termed him as 'fat' and hence unfit to play top-level cricket, even though legendary opener Sunil Gavaskar has defended his fitness, emphasizing that a player's performance and cricket fitness are more important than their body weight.In a heartening development that should certainly help him in his cricket career, Sarfaraz, who was picked for the India A squad for the upcoming tour of England on Friday, has eventually decided to improve on this aspect too. After remaining unsold in the IPL, the 27-year-old has been working hard on improving his fitness in recent times and shedding excess weight. In his endeavour to become lean and fit (and he does bear a far more slimmer look these days than earlier), the Mumbaikar has lost a staggering 10 kilograms in a month. In fact, since the last couple of months, Sarfaraz's whole family has been on a weight-losing spree, which has produced significant results. Advised to lose weight on an urgent basis to avoid a knee replacement surgery, Sarfaraz's father-cum-coach Naushad Khan has lost 12 kgs in a month.""Our whole family is focused on a 'weight-losing mission.' Sarfaraz has lost nine kilograms too in six weeks, which isn't easy, and he's raring to lose more weight,"" Naushad told TOI. ""Both Sarfaraz and I have been slogging in the gym at the Mumbai Cricket Association 's BKC facility for at least an hour for six days a week. I go for a walk, while he jogs at the club for almost an hour, and then there's a 30-minute swimming session. Even my younger son Moin (Khan) has lost a lot of weight,"" he said.Much of this weight-loss mission for the Khans has also involved a ""strict diet."" ""Sarfaraz and I have stopped eating aata (flour) and rice at home completely. Our diet is now strict but interesting — we eat vegetable sauté with boiled chicken, boiled eggs, and drink green tea and black coffee,"" Naushad said. ""We are using very little (olive) oil in our food,"" Naushad revealed. That means that Sarfaraz is no longer feasting on his favourite non-vegetarian dishes — particularly the chicken and mutton biryani — but it's a sacrifice that the middle-order batter has consciously made to improve his fitness drastically.Both Sarfaraz and his younger brother Musheer Khan (the Punjab Kings all-rounder was back home in Mumbai when the IPL was halted briefly) have been training daily (morning and evening) at the Karnatak ground on Cross Maidan under the watchful eyes of Naushad. While Sarfaraz is set to miss the third edition of the T20 Mumbai League, even though he was the Icon player for Aakash Tigers, Musheer was bought for Rs 15 lakh by Arcs Andheri.",Sarfaraz khan has lost a staggering 10 kilograms in a month.

Saquon Barkley’s rumored Madden 26 cover sparks fan outrage and fears of the infamous ‘Madden Curse’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/saquon-barkleys-rumored-madden-26-cover-sparks-fan-outrage-and-fears-of-the-infamous-madden-curse/articleshow/121250458.cms,"Saquon Barkley gracing the cover of Madden NFL 26 have fans are divided (Getty Images)

The Madden Curse returns to headlines after Saquon Barkley’s name surfaces

Political spotlight adds fuel to the controversy

As rumors swirl about Philadelphia Eagles running back Saquon Barkley gracing the cover of Madden NFL 26, fans are divided—and many are panicking. While the honor of being selected as a Madden cover athlete is a hallmark of NFL superstardom, the shadow of the so-called “Madden Curse” continues to loom large, fueling fears that this move could jeopardize both Barkley’s health and the Eagles’ Super Bowl ambitions.Dating back to 1999, the Madden Curse has left a trail of unfortunate injuries and downfalls. It began with Garrison Hearst, who suffered a devastating ankle injury after his cover appearance, sidelining him for two years. And while some athletes like Tom Brady and Patrick Mahomes have emerged unscathed and even thrived after being featured, others haven’t been as lucky—like Christian McCaffrey, who struggled following his Madden 24 cover moment.Now, as reports suggest Barkley could be EA Sports ’ latest poster boy, Eagles fans are sounding the alarm. One fan posted bluntly on X (formerly Twitter): “Injury incoming. Look what happened to CMC.” Another was more direct: “He will be hurt all season.”The fear isn’t unfounded. Barkley, a dynamic playmaker, is crucial to the Eagles’ Super Bowl defense after their title-winning run in Super Bowl LIX. Losing him to injury could be devastating for Philadelphia’s offensive schemes. One alarmed user summed up the sentiment: “They tryna put the Madden curse on the Eagles now.”Barkley has also faced scrutiny off the field. After golfing with former U.S. President Donald Trump—just a day before the team’s official visit—he faced backlash for his political proximity. He swiftly responded on X: “Maybe I just respect the office — not a hard concept to understand. Just golfed with Obama not too long ago… and look forward to finishing my round with Trump!”While some praised his diplomacy, others saw it as another unnecessary distraction. With EA Sports being a $38 billion brand, fan sentiment suggests they might be playing with fire. “No. Cancel it. Make it Odell or AB or something again,” one fan wrote.Also Read: NFL faces backlash as Kansas City Chiefs dominate 2025 prime-time schedule with Taylor Swift effect in full swing Whether the rumor proves true or not, the conversation around Saquon Barkley and the Madden 26 cover is exploding.

The 65 deliveries faced by him is the most by any batter in this IPL season, underscoring the anchor role he played. His 112* is also now the highest individual score ever recorded against Gujarat Titans, eclipsing Suryakumar Yadav’s 103* at Wankhede in 2023.It was Rahul’s fifth IPL century and seventh in T20 cricket, taking him joint-third among Indians with the most T20 tons, alongside Abhishek Sharma.

Auston Matthews’ hockey dream wasn’t cheap and his mom took the weight

“I used to work in the morning for Starbucks, in the afternoon the restaurant, i was very fortunate to have two jobs. And believe me, if they would have more hours, I would have more jobs.""





Before Auston Matthews was an NHL superstar, his biggest supporter was clocking into two jobs, trying to make ends meet. His mom, Ema Matthews , didn’t just believe in his dream, she bankrolled it, penny by penny, from behind a Starbucks counter. For families without deep pockets, hockey can be financially brutal. But Ema’s resilience turned obstacles into opportunity and her son into one of the league’s brightest stars. Her story is the heartwarming reminder that every great athlete often has a real-life superhero cheering from the sidelines.Ice time, gear, coaching, travel, youth hockey isn’t just a sport, it’s a financial beast. For the Matthews family, especially with Ema being originally from Hermosillo, Mexico, the culture and cost of the sport were both daunting. But she took on the challenge without hesitation, picking up multiple jobs including a gig at Starbucks to ensure Auston never missed a chance to grow on the ice.Ema shared in a past interview that the cost of hockey often reached up to $20,000 a year, a heavy ask for any middle-class family. To make it work, she didn’t just cut corners, she picked up shifts and poured lattes while helping Auston stay focused on the sport. She even deposited small amounts of money in his account so he could grab food with teammates like a regular teen.Ema’s story also breaks stereotypes. In a sport dominated by players from Canada and northern U.S. states, Auston’s rise as a player of Mexican heritage makes his success even more impactful. It's not just about talent, it’s about trailblazing, especially for kids of color or immigrant families who rarely see themselves represented in hockey.Auston Matthews is one of the Toronto Maple Leafs ’ biggest stars and a face of the NHL. He’s not just known for his goal-scoring skills but also for his poise and work ethic, traits his mom likely helped instill. While fans celebrate his success on the ice, stories like Ema’s remind us of the sacrifices behind the scenes that made it possible.Ema Matthews’ story shows what’s possible when love, grit, and hustle lead the way.","Auston matthews’ hockey dream wasn’t cheap and his mom took the weight of it on her shoulders.

Why the NHL never wanted Wayne Gretzky's son Ty Gretzky— even with the name,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/why-the-nhl-never-wanted-wayne-gretzkys-son-ty-gretzky-even-with-the-name/articleshow/121215015.cms,"Despite the name, NHL teams didn’t take the bait on Ty Gretzky (Image via Instagram)

The pressure of legacy proved more burden than boost

Despite the name, NHL teams didn’t take the bait

When your father is arguably the greatest hockey player of all time, the expectations aren’t just high — they’re suffocating. For Ty Gretzky , the eldest son of NHL icon Wayne Gretzky , the pressure to live up to ""The Great One"" was never just on the ice. It followed him into every locker room, every interview, and every shift he played. But despite his last name carrying the weight of a sports empire, Ty never came close to donning an NHL jersey — and few seem to talk about why.Ty Gretzky laced up his skates with the same passion many young Canadians do. But unlike most, his every move was scrutinized. Coaches, scouts, and fans often judged him not as a young player with potential, but as Wayne Gretzky’s son — a comparison no teenager could realistically live up to. As a result, Ty’s hockey development took place in the long shadow of a living legend, which may have stunted rather than supported his path.It’s easy to assume that Ty would get a shot at the NHL just based on the marketing potential alone. But the league never called — not even for a low-risk camp invite. And that raises a question the hockey world tends to avoid: did NHL executives quietly agree he simply didn’t have the talent, or were they wary of the media circus that would follow?While Ty played briefly in junior leagues, including a stint with the Shattuck-St. Mary’s prep school — a pipeline for future pros — his performances were modest. There were no breakout seasons, no jaw-dropping stats. Scouts remained silent. Teams passed him over year after year.Unlike other sports where legacy can open doors, the NHL prides itself on merit. Nepotism rarely flies in a league where every inch of ice is earned. In that sense, Ty Gretzky may be a rare case: the son of greatness who couldn’t buy his way into the league — even if others in his shoes might have tried.Also Read: Wayne Gretzky's son Ty Gretzky shows favouritism, backs Rick Tocchet's return as Flyers head coach with enthusiastic message In the end, Ty chose his own path, leaving hockey behind to pursue entrepreneurship and media.

Virat Kohli retires from Test cricket after 14 years

NEW DELHI: As the IPL 2025 league stage nears its conclusion, the playoff race has intensified, with only a few teams assured of their fate. While some franchises are well-poised for qualification, others face a steep climb.Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) sit comfortably at the top of the points table after earning a point from the washout against Kolkata Knight Riders. With 17 points in the bag, they need just one more win from their remaining two fixtures to officially seal a playoff berth. Given their current form and momentum, RCB look like strong contenders.Gujarat Titans (GT) are also in a commanding position. Their impressive net run rate adds cushion, meaning one more win should be enough to book their place in the top four.Punjab Kings (PBKS) have kept themselves firmly in the mix. With three matches left, they require just one victory to likely advance, assuming other results go their way.Also See: DC vs GT Live Score, IPL 2025 Mumbai Indians (MI) are in a must-win situation. They must win both remaining matches to reach 18 points. Their strong net run rate could work in their favor in case of a tie on points.Delhi Capitals (DC) need to win two of their last three matches to make it to 17 points, which should be enough. Their net run rate is better than a few of their rivals, giving them a crucial edge in the points scramble.Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) face the toughest task. They must win all three remaining games to hit 16 points. However, their poor net run rate means they will need convincing wins and favorable results from other matches to stay alive.The rest of the teams — Kolkata Knight Riders, Sunrisers Hyderabad, Rajasthan Royals, and Chennai Super Kings — have all been eliminated from playoff contention. These sides will now aim to finish the season with pride and experiment with their squads.With multiple teams still in the hunt, the final week promises high-stakes drama and potential surprises.",Royal challengers bengaluru (rcb) sit comfortably at the top of the points table.

IPL 2025: The unsung heroes of India's T20 league

NEW DELHI: At the season-opening Diamond League meet in Doha on Friday, all eyes were on Indian star Neeraj Chopra , who finally broke the elusive 90m barrier with a superb 90.23m throw.But one notable name missing from the javelin throw lineup was Pakistan’s Arshad Nadeem , the reigning Olympics gold medallist.Nadeem’s absence wasn’t due to injury or form issues, it was part of a planned training strategy.The 27-year-old is currently focused on preparing for the Asian Athletics Championships , set to take place in Gumi, South Korea, from May 27 to 31.According to his coaching team, Nadeem will depart for South Korea on May 22, prioritising peak performance at the continental event over early-season showings like the Diamond League.While Nadeem sat this one out, Chopra and Germany's Julian Weber made a statement in Doha.Under the guidance of legendary coach Jan Zelezny , the world record holder, Chopra became only the third Asian and 25th athlete in history to breach the 90m mark.His 90.23m effort wasn’t enough to win, though, as Weber edged ahead with a final-throw bomb of 91.06m. Still, for Chopra, it was a massive psychological and physical breakthrough.Chopra credited Zelezny’s presence and ideal weather conditions for his performance and expressed confidence that even longer throws are possible this season. As the reigning world champion, Chopra will head into the World Championships in Tokyo (Sept 13–21) with high momentum.""I am very happy that Jan Zelezny is my coach, and we worked very hard in South Africa. We are still working on some aspects. My next goal remains 90m,"" he said.",Neeraj chopra broke the 90m barrier with a superb 90.23m throw.

Bombay Sport Exchange Ep 5: Shane Watson on how IPL gave him a lifeline & his tribute to Phil Hughes

NEW DELHI: Nothing seems to be going right for Chennai Super Kings over the past two seasons. The five-time IPL champions missed out on a playoff spot in 2024 and endured another disappointing campaign in IPL 2025 . They were, in fact, the first team to be knocked out of the playoff race this season. Former CSK player Robin Uthappa acknowledged the team’s underwhelming performances but didn’t hold back in criticising fans who took their mockery of the MS Dhoni-led side to extreme levels.Also See: DC vs GT Live Score IPL 2025 Matches between CSK and RCB have always been high-voltage affairs, often bringing out the worst in fans on both sides. The marquee clash has repeatedly seen heated exchanges in the stands, with supporters hurling offensive jibes at each other.This season too, before the IPL was suspended, RCB edged out CSK in a thrilling encounter to keep their playoff hopes alive.Ahead of that game, some RCB fans were spotted selling ‘CSK jail’ jerseys—an attempt to taunt the Chennai-based franchise over their two-year suspension from the IPL in 2016 and 2017.However, Uthappa, who has donned the jersey of both franchises during his IPL career, was unimpressed with the gesture. He criticised the actions of some RCB fans who held up white T-shirts with black stripes to mock CSK supporters.""It was pretty intense. Outside the stadium, they were mocking the team, the players of the team when the bus was leaving, that was one thing that I saw, which I thought was in bad taste. The other one that I saw were the fans fighting with each other. I saw women being heckled, which felt unsavory, to be very honest. We saw that even in Chennai last year, again, uncalled for. It's not on whatsoever,"" said Uthappa on his YouTube channel.""It has gotten pretty intense. They are holding up jerseys, white T-shirts marked with black lines, stating the two years that CSK were banned for. They have kind of written MS' number on it, and Thala under it, depicting that they were in jail for two years, or whatever. It's getting a little beyond sport which concerns me. Because at the end of the day, this is a sport,"" he added.RCB took a significant step towards securing an IPL playoff spot, while defending champions Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) were eliminated from contention after persistent rain washed out their clash on Saturday, forcing both teams to share points.With 17 points from 12 matches, RCB now sit atop the points table, ahead of second-placed Gujarat Titans (16 points).

NEW DELHI: England all-rounder Tom Curran has finally addressed the viral reports claiming he “cried like a child” at the airport amid the recent India-Pakistan tensions that disrupted international cricket schedules , including the Pakistan Super League (PSL).The claims, sparked by comments from Bangladesh's Rishad Hossain, gained traction across media and social platforms, painting a dramatic picture of Curran's alleged emotional breakdown.Taking to Instagram Stories, Curran broke his silence in a calm and composed manner.“I’m glad to see things resuming, and I pray for continued peace between two very special countries,” he wrote, referring to the de-escalation of the situation.In a humorous tone, he added, “Btw promise, I didn’t cry; was ready,” playfully dismissing the claims.The controversy began when Rishad, in an interview with Cricbuzz, stated that Tom Curran was seen crying uncontrollably at the airport when flights were suspended, and that it took “two or three people to calm him down.”He also alleged that New Zealand's Daryl Mitchell vowed not to return to Pakistan due to the incident.However, facing backlash and realising the gravity of his words, Rishad Hossain later issued a formal apology. “A recent comment I made has been misrepresented, creating a false perception. It lacked context and unintentionally overstated the emotions involved,” he said.“I sincerely regret any misunderstanding and have offered an unconditional apology to both Daryl Mitchell and Tom Curran.”With tensions easing and the PSL resuming on May 17, starting with the clash between Karachi Kings and Peshawar Zalmi — the focus now shifts back to cricket.","England all-rounder tom curran has finally addressed the viral reports claiming he ‘cried like a child’ at the airport amid the recent india-pakistan tensions.

Lamine Yamal is fit but could be rested after a long season

Barcelona to field a rotated XI, Villarreal still fighting for Europe

FC Barcelona takes on Villarreal at home in one of the last matches of the 2024–25 La Liga campaign, and all eyes are on wonderkid Lamine Yamal to see if he will make a first-team appearance this evening. Barcelona vs Valencia is scheduled for 7:00 PM local time (CEST) start and will be played at Estadi Olímpic Lluís Companys.Barcelona has already secured the La Liga title, and Flick will have the luxury of being able to rotate his team and possibly rest some important players with the season coming to an end and behind a busy summer schedule.Lamine Yamal had been free from injuries but is now in full match fitness today. Yet, given he has had a high volume of game time this season and Barcelona’s status as already confirmed champions, Flick could rest the 17-year-old prodigy. That sort of tactical gesture would give some of the other squad players some vital playing time and give Yamal a less tired look going into the summer.One of this season's breakthrough players has followed impressive domestic and European performances. However, his ball intelligence, decision-making, and his freedom of thinking made him one of Barcelona's core players in a flash, despite his young age. As much as fans would like to see him play one more time this season, the club might be more interested in his long-term health.The La Liga title is done and dusted, so Barcelona is likely to name an entirely changed XI tonight. Other important players, such as Robert Lewandowski, Araujo, and Pedri, could also be on the bench or play sparingly as Flick plans to test his playing resources. The ruling could benefit academy stars and fringe players who have not had a chance to play on the biggest stage.Also Read: Who is Barcelona star Lamine Yamal’s girlfriend?

Wayne Rooney slams Erling Haaland's penalty decision

Pep Guardiola defends Erling Haaland’s choice

Manchester City 's surprising FA Cup final defeat to Crystal Palace has everyone talking, especially about Erling Haaland 's big decision. The team's star forward allowed his teammate, Omar Marmoush, to take a crucial penalty he missed, losing the game for Manchester City. Wayne Rooney , a former hero for Manchester United, said this shows Haaland is not on Messi's or Ronaldo's level. With City not winning anything this season, Haaland's choice has fans and pundits questioning his ability to handle the pressure.Manchester City lost to Crystal Palace in the FA Cup final at Wembley, ending their chance to win a trophy this season. Erling Haaland, usually the one to take penalties, shocked fans by giving the ball to Omar Marmoush, who missed the shot. On BBC Sport, Wayne Rooney said this proves Haaland doesn't have the same strong mindset as Messi or Ronaldo, who always want to take big shots.Rooney thinks Haaland, just back from an injury, might have felt too nervous to take the penalty in such a huge game. This has started a debate about whether Haaland can lead City when things get tough. With City out of the Champions League and struggling in the Premier League , Rooney's words put more pressure on Haaland.Fans are now watching to see if he can step up in the last two league games and show he's got what it takes to be a true star. Everyone wants to know if Haaland can prove Rooney wrong and be the hero City needs.Also Read: ""He was evil"": Former Manchester United star confesses Sir Alex Ferguson's methods would land him in jail today Manchester City's coach, Pep Guardiola, had a different take on Haaland's choice to skip the penalty. He said the players decided on the field that Marmoush should take it, based on how they felt then. Guardiola thought Haaland would want to shoot but didn't force him, saying players know best when it's time to step up.This shows City trusts its players to make quick decisions, even if they don't always work out. The defeat has cast doubt on City's spirit as a media and on how they cope with bigger games. With only two more matches left, and only a chance to qualify for next year's Champions League, Guardiola would want Haaland to do his best. His backing of Haaland suggests he has faith in his young striker.But fans are still concerned about Haaland's ability to perform under pressure. The football world is curious if Haaland can turn things around and prove he's ready for the most significant moments. City's season isn't over yet, and Haaland has a chance to show he can lead the team to success despite this setback.Manchester City's FA Cup loss has put Haaland in the spotlight for all the wrong reasons. Rooney's harsh words highlight the huge expectations on the young striker, while Guardiola's trust offers hope. With the season nearing its end, Haaland must show he can handle the pressure and lead City forward.","Manchester city lost to crystal palace in the fa cup final at wembley.

Punjab Kings (PBKS) captain Shreyas Iyer battled a severe finger injury to score a feisty 25-ball 30 against Rajasthan Royals in their Indian Premier League (IPL) 2025 clash on a hot Sunday afternoon at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium in Jaipur.Iyer walked out for the toss with a heavily taped index finger, having been hit during the practice session on the eve of the match.He came in to bat when Punjab found themselves in a tricky situation. After opting to bat first, PBKS lost momentum early, losing three quick wickets — Priyansh Arya, Prabhsimran Singh, and Mitch Owen.Iyer, known for his composure in pressure situations, opened his account with a stylish flicked boundary past mid-wicket off Tushar Deshpande. South African left-arm quick Kwena Mphaka attempted a short-pitched delivery, but strayed in line and was punished with a crisp square cut.Two boundaries in the ninth over off Akash Madhwal brought up the 50-run partnership for the fourth wicket with Nehal Wadhera.Iyer later brought up Punjab’s 100 with a glorious whip through wide long-on. Just when he seemed to be settling in, he mistimed a shot straight to long-off, where Yashasvi Jaiswal took a comfortable catch. Riyan Parag broke the 67-run stand between Iyer and Wadhera.Earlier, players from both teams lined up for the Indian national anthem to pay tribute to the Indian armed forces ahead of their match.
