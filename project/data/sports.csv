Wayne Gretzky's attendance sparks unrelated controversy



Alex Ovechkin Breaks Gretzky's Record for Most Goals in NHL History üö®

Wayne Gretzky faces backlash over Kash Patel appearance



Alex Ovechkin etched his name into NHL history, scoring his 895th goal to surpass Wayne Gretzky ‚Äôs all-time record. But what should‚Äôve been a celebration of hockey greatness took an unexpected turn. The spotlight drifted from the ice to the stands, specifically to Gretzky‚Äôs guest, Kash Patel . The former government official‚Äôs appearance sparked a wave of political chatter, clouding what was meant to be a milestone moment in the sport.Here‚Äôs what happened: Gretzky, invited to witness Ovechkin‚Äôs history-making night, was spotted at recent Capitals games alongside Patel, a former U.S. government official with Republican ties. That detail, insignificant to some, became headline fodder across social media.Suddenly, instead of reflecting on the end of one era and the start of another, online chatter shifted to whether Gretzky‚Äôs presence next to Patel carried political weight. Some fans, particularly from Canada, voiced disappointment, questioning Gretzky‚Äôs silence on past political issues and reading into his choice of company.Frank Seravalli, a respected NHL insider, thought so. He was quick to dismiss the controversy, reminding fans that Patel isn‚Äôt some outsider looking for a photo op‚Äîhe‚Äôs a longtime hockey guy with actual time on the ice. According to Seravalli, dragging Gretzky into a political debate during a celebratory hockey moment is a misfire.Let‚Äôs not forget what actually happened on the ice. Ovechkin scored a power-play goal in the second period against the Islanders, a goal that not only broke Gretzky‚Äôs record but redefined the ceiling for future scorers.Gretzky handled the moment with quiet grace. He didn‚Äôt make it about himself. He didn‚Äôt push a narrative. He showed up, clapped, and passed the torch with a short message that was more personal than political. ‚ÄúI know how hard it is to get to 895,‚Äù he said, reflecting on his own kids being close in age to Ovechkin‚Äôs when he set the record.Also Read: Alex Ovechkin‚Äôs record ignites nostalgia as Penguins‚Äô Mike Sullivan remembers legends who built NHL It was hockey history in real time.

Head coach Michael Malone addresses Denver Nuggets' four-Game losing streak

There's something wrong with the Denver Nuggets . Even though they have the skills and the MVP, they fail when it means the most. It's clear that coach Michael Malone is upset, and Nikola Jokic 's statements make it sound like there are bigger problems at play. It's not just bad luck; it's turning into a pattern. There are not many days left in the normal season, so they can't make any mistakes.Head coach Michael Malone is raising concerns as the Denver Nuggets are experiencing their longest losing streak since March 2023. He stressed the importance of cutting out expensive errors, saying, ‚ÄúWe haven‚Äôt lost 4 in a row in a long time... We put ourselves in this hole & we only have ourselves to pull ourselves out of it.‚ÄùThe Nuggets faced a tough defeat against the Indiana Pacers, losing 125-120 after giving up a 13-point advantage, which reflects their current challenges. Jokic had an impressive game with 41 points, 15 rebounds, and 13 assists, but he pointed out that turnovers were a significant concern.He shared his thoughts on the matter, ""Everybody had one or two 'It's my fault, it's my fault,' and that's 10 'my bads,' and that's basically 20 points or even more."" Jokic focused on the need for improved effort and attention to detail, adding, ""We all need to be better in those little extra efforts or just one more thing or make them do one more thing.This trend isn't anything new. During an intense double-overtime game against the Minnesota Timberwolves, Jokic's remarkable 61-point triple-double got lost in the shuffle due to some late-game mistakes, notably a crucial foul by Russell Westbrook that resulted in the free throws that decided the game.As the regular season winds down with just three games left, the Nuggets hold a 47-32 record, putting them in a tight spot at fourth in the Western Conference, only half a game above dropping to eighth.The Denver Nuggets are set to take on the Sacramento Kings on Wednesday, April 9, 2025, at 7:00 PM PDT. After dropping four straight games, the Nuggets really need this win to get back on track as the playoffs loom. Meanwhile, the Kings are eager to take advantage of the Nuggets' recent downturn.Also Read: Cleveland Cavaliers' franchise record shattered dashed after controversial call and loss to Sacramento Kings As the playoffs get closer, every mistake counts even more.

Olivier Rioux stands tall as redshirt freshman and becomes fan favorite

People are celebrating Florida's recent championship victory but the 7 '9 Canadian redshirt freshman Olivier Rioux stands as a fan favorite even though he has not played a single NCAA game. Rioux built his reputation through time at IMG Academy and Guinness World Records now recognizes him as he prepares to transform basketball history.Standing tall at 7-foot-9, Canadian freshman Olivier Rioux is set to make a big impact in college basketball as he prepares to debut with the University of Florida Gators . Even though he didn‚Äôt play during the Gators' recent NCAA Championship run, his presence has already stirred excitement, setting the stage for a remarkable entry into Division I basketball.The Florida Gators celebrated their third national title on April 7, 2025, after a tense 65-63 triumph over the Houston Cougars. Battling back from a 12-point deficit in the second half, the Gators proved their tenacity and spirit. Senior guard Walter Clayton Jr. was instrumental, scoring all 11 of his points post-halftime and executing a critical defensive stop in the final seconds to seal the win.Rioux may not have stepped onto the field this season due to his redshirt status, which is a smart strategy for skill development and extending his eligibility, but he was still a key part of the team's adventure. His tall frame on the sidelines attracted attention, and he quickly became a fan favorite during the Gators' tournament run.Originating from Terrebonne, Quebec, Rioux's journey to the NCAA is quite extraordinary. He exceeded 7 feet in height before finishing seventh grade and now holds the Guinness World Record for being the tallest teenager in the world. Before becoming a Gator, he trained at IMG Academy in Florida, where he evolved into a dominant center.Beyond his plans for college, Rioux is looking to represent Canada on the national team and might even consider a future in the NBA .

A goal for the ages: Alex Ovechkin breaks Wayne Gretzky's 26-year record



FULL Alex Ovechkin Celebration Ceremony After Record-Breaking Goal No. 895

A legacy passed down: Anastasia Shubskaya receives diamond tribute from Janet Gretzky



After Alex Ovechkin netted his 895th career goal and broke legendary Wayne Gretzky 's record, Janet Gretzky showed respect to a time-honored hockey tradition by gifting Anastasia Shubskaya , wife of Alex Ovechkin, an eight-carat diamond ring that had been estimated at $280,000. The Capitals may have lost to the New York Islanders by a score of 4-1, but the outcome was an afterthought to a night all about legacy, love, and a new chapter in hockey's history.The moment of history arrived at 7:26 of the second period. Alex Ovechkin let go of a blazing shot through fellow Russian Ilya Sorokin, making himself the NHL's all-time leading goal scorer. Fans inside UBS Arena lost their minds, and Alex Ovechkin commemorated the occasion by executing a belly flop onto the ice‚Äîcelebrating his big achievement.While Alex Ovechkin was absorbing the enormity of his achievement, Anastasia Shubskaya was gifted a symbolic token of the historic night. Continuing a tradition started in 1994, when Colleen Howe (wife of Gordie Howe) gave Janet Gretzky a diamond ring after her husband, Wayne Gretzky, broke Colleen Howe‚Äôs husband‚Äôs record, Janet Gretzky ensured history repeated itself‚Äîthis time from one hockey family to another.In an interview with the media, Wayne Gretzky said, ‚ÄúA month ago, my wife said, ‚ÄòYou know, Colleen Howe started a tradition. I‚Äôm not sure if anyone is going to break Alex‚Äôs record, but I want to give her (Ovechkin‚Äôs wife, Anastasia Shubskaya) something really unique.‚Äô So, we went out and she picked out an eight-diamond ring for Alex‚Äôs wife.

From mentorship to mistrust: Taylor Swift felt like a daughter, but was treated like a product

A betrayal beyond business: Taylor Swift compares herself to a ‚Äúprized calf‚Äù



Taylor Swift has always been an artist who wears her heart on her sleeve, but her fallout with former label boss Scott Borchetta took her vulnerability to a whole new level. In a 2019 interview with Rolling Stone, Swift pulled back the curtain on a relationship she once believed was built on mutual respect and personal connection‚Äîbut later realized was anything but.Taylor Swift launched her career under Big Machine Records , helmed by Scott Borchetta. For years, the partnership yielded chart-topping albums like Fearless and Red, and on the surface, it seemed like a successful and creative alliance. But behind the scenes, tension was mounting. Swift revealed that she once viewed Borchetta as a paternal figure in the industry. ‚ÄúI truly, legitimately thought he looked at me as the daughter he never had,‚Äù she said.Despite their creative differences, Taylor Swift admitted she tried to focus on the positives. ‚ÄúI was going to hang my hat on the good stuff,‚Äù she said. But the illusion shattered when Borchetta sold the master rights to her first six albums to talent manager Scooter Braun‚Äîwithout her consent.The deal marked a turning point, leaving Taylor Swift feeling used and dehumanized. Her words cut deep: ‚ÄúTo go from feeling like you‚Äôre being looked at as a daughter to this grotesque feeling of ‚ÄòOh, I was actually his prized calf that he was fattening up to sell to the slaughterhouse that would pay the most.‚Äô‚Äù It was more than just a business betrayal‚Äîit was a profound personal violation.The situation worsened when both Borchetta and Braun allegedly spread misinformation about Swift withdrawing from the Manchester benefit concert and the Parkland march. ‚ÄúEveryone in my team knew if Scooter Braun brought us something, do not bring it to me,‚Äù she shared, highlighting how strained things had become behind the scenes.Swift didn‚Äôt just speak out‚Äîshe took action. Determined to reclaim her voice and ownership, she began re-recording her early albums. Her motivation was clear: ‚ÄúThese are two very rich, very powerful men, using $300 million of other people‚Äôs money to purchase, like, the most feminine body of work,‚Äù she said, expressing her disgust.Also Read: Taylor Swift joins billionaires‚Äô club in 2025 alongside Hollywood heavyweights like Kim Kardashian and Oprah Winfrey Through resilience and artistry, Taylor Swift continues to turn betrayal into empowerment, reclaiming not only her music but her narrative.","Taylor swift opened up about her relationship with former label boss scott borchetta in a new interview with rolling stone.

Odell Beckham leads race to be NFL‚Äôs first billionaire,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/odell-beckham-leads-race-to-be-nfls-first-billionaire/articleshow/120098596.cms,"Odell Beckham Jr. transcends traditional NFL success metrics, prioritizing influence and cultural impact over mere statistics. He's a cultural icon, bridging the gap between the league and younger generations through fashion, music, and art. Beckham's relevance attracts brands and coaches alike, proving that cultural capital is a valuable asset, redefining wealth in professional football.

Odell Beckham goes beyond NFL



NFL Star Odell Beckham Jr. Booed as Cops Kick Him Off Plane

Odell Beckham turning relevance into revenue



In an age where athletes are more than just players, Odell Beckham Jr. is the prototype of a new kind of NFL star, one who measures success not just by salary or stats, but by influence, impact, and identity. While discussions about billion-dollar athletes usually center on business empires and financial wins, OBJ is quietly redefining what it means to be ‚Äúwealthy‚Äù in today‚Äôs game and it goes far beyond the bank account.Odell‚Äôs wealth isn‚Äôt just monetary, it‚Äôs cultural. Since exploding onto the scene in 2014, he‚Äôs been more than a wide receiver; he‚Äôs been a walking zeitgeist. From viral moments to headline-grabbing fashion choices, his presence commands attention in ways few NFL stars ever have. He doesn‚Äôt just play the game, he influences the narrative around it.Beckham‚Äôs name now surfaces in conversations once reserved for the likes of Tom Brady and Michael Jordan, proof that his brand power stretches far beyond the playbook.It‚Äôs no coincidence that brands across industries chase his name. Not because he‚Äôs always the top performer statistically, but because he brings something rarer: relevance. Beckham is tapped into music, fashion, art, and youth culture in a way that makes him more than a marketing asset, he‚Äôs a cultural translator between the league and the next generation.That‚Äôs what international sports agent Brittany Gilman was really pointing to when she named Beckham as a potential billionaire.

NEW DELHI: Rajasthan Royals Riyan Parag found himself at the centre of controversy during their Indian Premier League 2025 clash against Gujarat Titans at the Narendra Modi Stadium on Wednesday, after a disputed dismissal saw him exchanging words with the on-field umpire.Chasing a daunting 218-run target, Rajasthan were struggling early at 12 for 2 when Parag walked in to join skipper Sanju Samson . The pair steadied the innings with a crucial 48-run stand, until drama unfolded in the seventh over.Facing pacer Kulwant Khejroliya , Parag attempted to guide the ball to third man but appeared to edge the delivery through to wicketkeeper Jos Buttler . The Royals batter instantly opted for a DRS review. Replays showed a spike on UltraEdge as the ball passed the bat, prompting the third umpire to uphold the on-field decision.However, Parag was visibly dissatisfied, seemingly convinced the spike came from his bat grazing the ground rather than an edge. He paused on his way back, engaging in a brief but tense exchange with the umpire before reluctantly leaving the field.It marked the end of a promising innings and left Royals in trouble at 60 for 3 in 6.4 overs. Parag's reaction highlighted his frustration with the call.","Riyan parag exchanged words with on-field umpire after disputed dismissal.

Jaylen Brown is listed as questionable with a right knee posterior impingement.With most of their starters sidelined, the Celtics will rely heavily on reserves against Orlando.

Los Angeles Lakers vs Dallas Mavericks game details (April 9, 2025)

Thesquare off in one of the most anticipated matchups of the regular season, with playoff positioning and pride on the line. With LeBron James , Luka Doncic, and Anthony Davis potentially sharing the floor, all eyes will be on this Wednesday night showdown airing live on ESPN.Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the latest odds, key players, and why both teams believe they can come out on top. The Lakers have hit their stride at the perfect time. Coming off a dominant 126-99 win over the Oklahoma City Thunder, LA has now won two straight and looks poised to make a push for the No. 3 seed in the West. Despite playing on the second night of a back-to-back, the Lakers‚Äô depth was on full display in OKC.Key performers included:- LeBron James and Luka Doncic combining for 49 points- Austin Reaves adding 20 points- Role players like Dorian Finney-Smith and Gabe Vincent knocking down eight three-pointers between themThe Lakers are 44-33-2 against the spread this season and have proven to be one of the most consistent ATS teams in the league. At home, they‚Äôre dominant (30-10), but even on the road (18-20), recent performances suggest they‚Äôre peaking at the right moment.Luka‚Äôs impact since joining LA cannot be overstated. He‚Äôs averaging:- 27.3 points- 8.3 rebounds- 7.7 assists- 1.6 steals per gameHowever, opponents have found success when they force Luka to defend consistently, draining his energy for clutch-time scoring. Expect Dallas to target him early and often on defense.Dallas is fighting for a spot in the Play-In Tournament and desperately needs this win. The Mavericks are not dealing with the fatigue of a back-to-back and will be fully rested, unlike the Lakers. While they‚Äôve lost two straight and are 5-5 in their last 10 games, Anthony Davis's return changes everything.Important notes for Dallas:- Anthony Davis is probable and expected to play a major role- Kyrie Irving is out for the season- Jaden Hardy is ruled out- Dante Exum is a game-time decisionIf Davis is active and aggressive, he could be the game-changer Dallas needs. A 30+ point, 15-rebound, multi-block game is not out of the question. His head-to-head battle with LeBron will be one of the night‚Äôs biggest storylines.The Mavericks are 36-40-3 against the spread and 42-35-2 on totals, but they‚Äôve failed to cover in four consecutive games.Luka Doncic returns to Dallas‚Äîbut this time in purple and gold. The energy in the arena will be electric and emotionally charged. For many fans, this will be their first time rooting against Luka, a player they passionately supported for years.Doncic could respond in one of two ways:- Embrace the challenge and take over offensively- Defer to teammates and orchestrate from the backgroundEither way, the spotlight will be on him.The Mavericks opened as bigger underdogs, but sharp action trimmed the spread down to just five points. Despite that movement, the Lakers remain the better bet based on current form, depth, and recent momentum‚Äîeven with the back-to-back situation.Los Angeles has proven they can win tough road games and have more than enough firepower to cover this modest spread.Final pick: Lakers -5 (-112)Time: 7:30 PM ET / 4:30 PM PTTV: ESPNStreaming: fuboTV (free trial available)This matchup promises high-level intensity and star power. With playoff implications, personal rivalries, and emotions running high, Wednesday night‚Äôs game is must-watch TV.","The los angeles lakers and dallas mavericks square off in one of the most anticipated matchups of the regular season.

Priyansh Arya 's fearless century lit up Mullanpur on Tuesday as the 24-year-old opener hammered the joint fourth-fastest hundred in IPL history, powering Punjab Kings to a crucial 18-run win over Chennai Super Kings .

""I've been around a lot of games of cricket. I haven‚Äôt seen many better knocks than what I saw tonight,"" said the former Australian skipper.

Ponting didn‚Äôt miss the opportunity to laud them either.""To Shashank ‚Äî smart, calculating. You did what the team needed.

You even said at the time-out we could get to 220 ‚Äî and we got 219! We were 80 for 5, backs to the wall, and look what we did. That‚Äôs what good teams do.""With the win, Punjab Kings moved up to No. 4 on the table, and Arya proved he's more than a rising star ‚Äî he's the embodiment of a fearless, team-first mindset.","Priyansh arya hit 103 off 42 balls, the joint fourth-fastest hundred in ipl history.

Around 7am on Wednesday morning, Punjab Kings (PBKS) opener Priyansh Arya called up his childhood coach Sanjay Bharadwaj , hoping for compliments for his audacious 39-ball century against the Chennai Super Kings (CSK). However, he was in for a surprise as the coach stuck to his usual self.Also See: GT vs RR Live Score, IPL 2025 ""He asked me, 'Sir,? (Was it good?)' I shouted back and asked, '? (What was good?), you have done well in one match, don't get carried away,'"" says Bharadwaj.The conversation didn't stop there but became a one-way street as Priyansh could only respond with just ""yes sir"", ""no sir"" for the next ten minutes. Bharadwaj, one of the doyens of the domestic circuit who has shaped careers of Gautam Gambhir , Amit Mishra, Joginder Sharma, Nitish Rana and Unmukt Chand, revealed the message he gave to his ward after the maiden IPL hundred.""I told him this morning, '(Priyansh, if you play only with your hands, you will remain a labourer, like any normal cricketer. If you use your brain and hands, you will become an artisan, and the day you play with heart, using both your brain and hands, you will become a true artist),'"" says Bharadwaj.Fireworks were on display at the New PCA Cricket Stadium on Tuesday as the southpaw smashed nine sixes and hit seven boundaries during his 42-ball 103. For those who have followed his career from age-group days in Delhi, the approach isn't a surprise as that's the only way he knows to bat. The coach aptly sums it up as ""see the ball, hit the ball"".""It's just see-the-ball, hit-the-ball. If you give him any width, he will punish you. Only Khaleel (Ahmed) was getting some help from the surface, but he wasn't able to control it, and Priyansh made the most of it,"" said Bharadwaj on Priyansh's approach.Growing up, Arya was fortunate to see current India head coach and former India cricketer Gautam Gambhir train from close quarters at his academy. The youngster had once revealed how he never got the guts to speak to his hero but remained around him, watched his batting in the nets and was even part of the Delhi Ranji Trophy probables during Gambhir's last season.Priyansh's father, Pawan Arya , a school teacher at Delhi‚Äôs Government Sarvodaya Vidyalaya, Lancer Road, near Vishwavidyalaya metro station, explained how Gambhir's mentorship has helped his son grow.""Gautam has backed him since he scored 271 runs in an U-19 match. He has guided him in the last six-seven years. He has asked him to play as much as he can. He insisted he play in the Delhi League and the Hot Weather Tournament. It has helped Priyansh,"" says Pawan Arya.Bharadwaj further explained what impressed Gambhir the most about Priyansh Arya. ""Gambhir is sold on a player if he has an attitude. He doesn't believe in talent alone. He sees the intent. Even in Delhi cricket, over the years, he has backed Unmukt Chand, Navdeep Saini, Ayush Badoni, and Nitish Rana,"" he added.Gambhir is big on attitude and intent, and that's the prime reason why the likes of Harshit Rana and Nitish Kumar Reddy were fast-tracked into the Indian set-up and went on to make their Test debuts during the tour Down Under.Meanwhile, at the Arya's in Ashok Vihar, New Delhi, Pawan had to take a day off from work as he was busy attending guests. The plan for remainder of the week is simple - sit at home and watch the IPL.""I was so excited to see him play live in the IPL for the first time. Against Rajasthan Royals, I went to Chandigarh to watch him play, and he got out on the first ball for a duck. Yesterday, I was watching the match at home, and he scored a century. I guess I am the bad luck. Now I have decided I will never go and watch his games live,"" said Pawan with a laugh.Priyansh's dream is to play for India. This is where his father, his coach, and his mentor wants to see him. It's a long road but the youngster is moving in the right direction, and has an able support system, led by a hard taskmaster coach. It's just the start of runs and tons for the promising left-hander, and certainly not the end of Bharadwaj's epic one-liners.","Punjab kings opener priyansh arya hit 39-ball 103 against chennai super kings.
