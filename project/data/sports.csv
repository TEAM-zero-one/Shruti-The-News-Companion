Why a Reunion Makes Sense

Themay be looking toward a major reunion this offseason, as reports suggest the team could make a push to bring back former MVP and World Series champion. After a roller-coaster regular season and an unexpected postseason surge, the Dodgers’ front office could be planning a familiar move to bolster their lineup once again.Following a strong postseason showing and an inspiring 10-game winning streak before falling to the Philadelphia Phillies in the NLDS, the Los Angeles Dodgers proved they still have the potential to compete at the highest level. Manager Dave Roberts’ fiery comments after sweeping the Milwaukee Brewers captured the team’s mindset.“Before this season started, they said the Dodgers are ruining baseball. Let’s get four more wins and really ruin baseball,” Roberts said on the air. (H/t: Sporting News)While Los Angeles is still focused on chasing championships, the offseason could bring a strategic reunion that excites fans - one involving a two-time All-Star and one of the most popular Dodgers of recent years.Cody Bellinger, who won the 2019 NL MVP with the Los Angeles Dodgers, saw a drastic dip in performance over the next three seasons. During that time, he hit just .203/.272/.376 with a 76 OPS+ across 1,143 plate appearances, which ultimately led to the Dodgers non-tendering him.However, since leaving Los Angeles, Bellinger has rediscovered his form. Over the past three seasons, he’s posted a 125 OPS+ and accumulated 12.0 WAR in 412 games, proving that his prime years may not be over yet.According to Bleacher Report’s Joel Reuter, “After winning NL MVP in 2019, Cody Bellinger hit a combined .203/.272/.376 for a 76 OPS+ over 1,143 plate appearances in the three years that followed, which ultimately led to him being non-tendered. In three years since he left, he has a 125 OPS+ and 12.0 WAR in 412 games, and he could be atop the Los Angeles Dodgers list of potential targets to replace Michael Conforto as a left-handed hitting outfielder. ”Bellinger is expected to opt out of his current deal with the New York Yankees, where he recently experienced a resurgence. ESPN’s Jorge Castillo reported that “As expected, New York Yankees outfielder Cody Bellinger plans to opt out of his contract and become a free agent next month, a source told ESPN. Bellinger, 30, has a $25 million player option for next season. After a rebound season in his first year in pinstripes, he presumably will receive widespread interest in free agency - it should yield a lucrative multi-year contract. ”This move could set the stage for a fierce bidding war between top contenders, including the Los Angeles Dodgers, who have the financial strength to compete for big-name free agents.Bellinger’s defensive versatility adds further appeal. He’s capable of playing center field, first base, and right field at a high level - traits that fit seamlessly into Dave Roberts’ flexible lineup approach. For the Dodgers, reuniting with Cody Bellinger wouldn’t just be about nostalgia; it would be a calculated move to strengthen both offense and defense.Also read: MLB trade rumors: Boston Red Sox could sign $180 million Houston Astros All-Star to replace Lucas Giolito as rotation upgrade The Los Angeles Dodgers have the money, the motivation, and the familiarity to make a reunion with Cody Bellinger a reality. As free agency approaches, all signs point toward a potential homecoming that could reignite memories of their 2020 World Series run - this time with Bellinger back in Dodger blue, aiming for redemption and another championship push.","Cody bellinger won the 2019 nl mvp with the los angeles dodgers.

Why the Trade Could Make Sense

Key Impacts of the Trade

What It Means for Giannis Antetokounmpo and the Bucks

Thecould be on the verge of one of the biggest shake-ups in franchise history. With Jayson Tatum sidelined for most, if not all, of the 2025-26 NBA season due to a severe Achilles injury, the team might consider a bold move to keep their championship window alive - one that involves acquiring Milwaukee Bucks superstarTatum’s absence leaves a massive void, but Jaylen Brown is expected to carry the offensive load. Still, as reported by Fansided’s Matt Moore, Boston could benefit from thinking long-term by making a blockbuster trade with Milwaukee - one that would bring a generational player to TD Garden.According to Moore, the proposed trade would send Jaylen Brown, Anfernee Simons, Sam Hauser, Xavier Tillman, and two first-round picks to the Bucks. In return, the Boston Celtics would receive Giannis Antetokounmpo, Myles Turner, and Bobby Portis.Moore described the potential deal as painful but transformative for both sides. He wrote, “Obviously, Jaylen Brown is the best player in any of these packages that the Bucks can get back. A good-to-great player, in his prime, on a long-term contract. It would be painful for the Boston Celtics to make this trade… but Boston gets to instantly reorganize their future. It’s now Tatum coming back from the Achilles with Derrick White and Giannis.That’s your core for the next four years.” (H/t: Sporting News)The Boston Celtics’ current roster is talented, but losing Tatum for a long stretch threatens to stall their momentum. Adding Giannis Antetokounmpo, one of the league’s most dominant forwards, could immediately revitalize the team’s championship aspirations.Meanwhile, the Bucks would gain valuable depth and flexibility, particularly with Myles Turner anchoring their frontcourt and shifting their system from a wing-heavy to a more balanced inside-out structure.• For Boston: Forms a new core of Giannis, Tatum, and Derrick White, ensuring long-term competitiveness.• For Milwaukee: Gains multiple starting-caliber players and future assets to build around post-Giannis era.• For Giannis: Offers a fresh start with a championship-caliber franchise while pairing with a Top 15-20 player in Tatum once he returns. Giannis Antetokounmpo , who signed a massive $175 million contract, remains one of the NBA’s most valuable players. Yet, if Milwaukee’s postseason struggles continue, his patience could wear thin. A slow or uncompetitive start to the 2025-26 season might open the door for the Boston Celtics to swoop in.The 6-foot-11 forward has made it clear that he wants to maximize his prime years. If the Bucks fail to show signs of progress, a change of scenery might become inevitable. Boston’s combination of organizational stability and future star power could be exactly what he’s looking for.While the deal is purely hypothetical for now, it represents the kind of forward-thinking move that could redefine both franchises. Boston would get a generational talent ready to lead alongside Tatum once he’s healthy, while Milwaukee could reset with a deep, versatile roster.Also read: NBA trade rumors: Los Angeles Lakers Predicted to sign $186 million Milwaukee Bucks NBA All-Star to form deadly duo with Luka Doncic As the new season unfolds, all eyes will be on how Giannis Antetokounmpo and the Bucks perform early.

Quinn Ewers confirmed as Dolphins ’ backup to Tua Tagovailoa for Week 7

Zach Wilson moved to third-string as Dolphins adjust QB depth chart





The Miami Dolphins are making a bold quarterback move ahead of their Week 7 clash against the Cleveland Browns. Tua Tagovailoa remains the starter, but rookie Quinn Ewers will now serve as his backup, replacing Zach Wilson. Miami is preparing for a challenging game in Cleveland’s windy, wet conditions while testing their quarterback depth.According to NFL Network insider Ian Rapoport, Quinn Ewers will be active as the backup to Tua Tagovailoa for the Dolphins’ matchup against the Browns. Zach Wilson has been moved to the third-string role. This marks Ewers’ first time active in an NFL game, highlighting Miami’s confidence in the rookie’s ability to step up under pressure. The move also gives Ewers a chance to make his NFL debut in a potentially high-stakes environment.Ewers, who played his final season at Texas, threw for 3,472 passing yards with 31 touchdowns and 12 interceptions, leading the SEC in touchdown passes. In the Dolphins’ preseason, he went 23-of-43 for 273 yards and two touchdowns, taking four sacks but committing no turnovers. These performances signal that Ewers is ready to contribute when called upon.Miami’s $6 million offseason signing, Zach Wilson, is now the third-string quarterback. This season, Wilson completed 29-of-45 passes for 327 yards, one touchdown, and seven sacks, avoiding turnovers. The Dolphins’ decision to prioritize Ewers reflects their focus on building depth and evaluating rookie talent for long-term success. Wilson’s demotion highlights Miami’s growing trust in rookie quarterback Quinn Ewers, who continues to draw attention as one of the most promising young passers in the AFC.With Tua Tagovailoa starting and Ewers as the backup, Miami is prepared for any scenario in Cleveland. The windy and wet conditions could make the quarterback position crucial if a substitution is required. This move also gives Ewers a chance to make an early NFL impact and shows Miami’s strategic approach to managing their quarterback room.The Dolphins’ Week 7 quarterback change demonstrates the team’s commitment to preparing for adversity and developing rookie talent. Quinn Ewers’ elevation to backup marks a significant step in his NFL journey and could play a key role in Miami’s Week 7 game against the Browns. If Ewers sees game action, it could offer a glimpse into Miami’s future at quarterback — a storyline that could define their 2025 NFL campaign.Also Read: Could Dolphins’ Anthony Weaver jump ship after 2025 disaster?

Women's World Cup prediction: Greenstone Lobo explains which team has best chance to win

NEW DELHI: Four-time champions England booked their spot in the semi-finals of the Women’s World Cup after a nail-biting four-run win over hosts India in Indore on Sunday. England posted a competitive 288/8, anchored by Heather Knight’s classy century, and held their nerve in the field to defend it, despite their bowling, usually their strength, being slightly off-colour.India looked on course for victory, needing just 62 runs from the last 10 overs with seven wickets in hand. But the dismissal of Smriti Mandhana shifted the momentum. The elegant left-hander, who had been anchoring the chase, danced down the track to left-arm spinner Linsey Smith but failed to clear long-off. Soon after, Richa Ghosh and Deepti Sharma fell in quick succession, leaving the tail exposed. As the match slipped away, Mandhana struggled to control her tears, a poignant reminder of how close India had come.Deepti Sharma, after reaching her half-century, attempted a risky slog sweep against Sophie Ecclestone and was caught at deep mid-wicket, sealing England’s victory.""We probably needed 300, but we did well to pull things back and I'm very happy. Didn't contribute much in the last couple of games, so it felt good to come up with a match-winning hundred,"" said Knight, whose 109 off 91 balls, laced with 15 fours and a six, powered England’s innings.England’s openers gave them a brisk start with 73 runs for the first wicket before Knight and captain Nat Sciver-Brunt stitched a 113-run stand to keep the scoreboard ticking. At one point, England seemed set to breach 300, but Knight’s run out during a second run triggered a slowdown. Deepti Sharma finished with four wickets, keeping India in the hunt.The defeat marked India’s third consecutive loss, leaving their next clash against New Zealand a virtual knockout. Both teams are on four points, and only a win in both remaining games, along with favourable results elsewhere, will keep India’s semi-final hopes alive.""Not sure how we lost this game. We had it in the bag. We've worked so hard and when the last five overs slip away from you, it's heartbreaking. This is the third straight game we've lost after coming so close,"" lamented India captain Harmanpreet Kaur, reflecting the anguish felt by the team and particularly by Mandhana, whose heartbreak underlined how agonisingly close India came to victory.","England beat india by four runs to reach the women's world cup semi-finals.

Women's World Cup prediction: Greenstone Lobo explains which team has best chance to win

SCENARIO 1 – WIN BOTH MATCHES:

India beat New Zealand and Bangladesh.

Result: India qualifies for the semifinals regardless of other results.

SCENARIO 2 – LOSE TO NEW ZEALAND:

India lose to New Zealand.

Then, India hope New Zealand lose their final match against England.

India must beat Bangladesh to advance.

SCENARIO 3 – WIN vs NEW ZEALAND, LOSE vs BANGLADESH:

India beat New Zealand but lose to Bangladesh.

New Zealand must defeat England in their final match.

The team with the better net run-rate (India or New Zealand) will progress to the semifinals.

NEW DELHI: India’s Women’s World Cup campaign is on a knife-edge after another agonising defeat. Chasing a target of 289 against England in Indore on Sunday, India fell just four runs short, marking their third consecutive loss in the tournament. With the win, England secured a semifinal berth alongside South Africa and Australia, leaving only one spot up for grabs. India currently sit fourth in the points table with four points from five matches (NRR +0.526), while their main competitor for the final semifinal place, New Zealand, also has four points but a lower net run-rate (-0.245).The defeat leaves India, co-hosts and pre-tournament favourites, teetering on the brink of elimination, with their semi-final hopes now resting on the outcomes of the remaining two group matches.India will next face New Zealand on Thursday, followed by their final group match against Bangladesh on October 26.A win in both games would guarantee a spot in the semifinals.If they lose to New Zealand, India will need the White Ferns to lose their last match against England and then beat Bangladesh to advance.There’s also a third scenario. If India beat New Zealand but lose to Bangladesh, and New Zealand defeat England, the team with the better net run-rate will progress.Against England, India looked on course for victory for much of the chase. Skipper Smriti Mandhana scored a commanding 88, while Harmanpreet Kaur contributed 70 and Deepti Sharma added 50.With India needing 56 runs off 54 balls and seven wickets in hand, the match seemed under control. However, England fought back brilliantly to clinch the win. Heather Knight’s classy 109 off 91 balls, in her 300th international appearance, had earlier anchored England’s total of 288/8, with Amy Jones contributing 56.India’s bowlers triggered a late collapse, but Linsey Smith and Sophie Ecclestone sealed England’s triumph in the final overs.“It’s a bad feeling when you have put so much hard work in but the last 5-6 overs didn’t go according to the plan,” Harmanpreet said after the match. “Smriti’s wicket was the turning point for us. It’s a heartbreaking moment. Credit to England. They didn’t lose hope, they kept bowling and getting wickets.”","India's world cup campaign is on a knife-edge after another agonising defeat.

Poll What’s your view on criticism of players on social media? It helps them improve It can be harmful

NEW DELHI: Indian spinner Ravichandran Ashwin recently found himself in a humorous situation when a person impersonating Australian cricketer Adam Zampa contacted him on WhatsApp, asking for the phone numbers of several Indian players.Ashwin shared screenshots of the conversation on Instagram, captioning it “Fake Adam Zampa tries to strike.” The post quickly went viral, with fans loving Ashwin’s sharp and witty replies to the impersonator.The fake Zampa asked Ashwin for the contact details of players such as Abhishek Sharma, Jasprit Bumrah, Sanju Samson, Jitesh Sharma, Rinku Singh, and Shivam Dube. Ashwin decided to play along, joking that he would send the list and asking if those names were enough.He then turned the tables by asking the impersonator if he had MS Dhoni’s number. When the fake Zampa replied that he did, Ashwin requested the number in return. The chat ended on a hilarious note, with Ashwin quipping that he was “Compiling in Excel” when the impersonator again pressed for the contacts.This wasn’t Ashwin’s first brush with online impostors. He revealed a similar incident involving someone pretending to be his former Chennai Super Kings teammate Devon Conway.""After the IPL got over, one guy messaged me, claiming to be Devon Conway, 'Hi buddy, how are you?' and I also responded, 'We'll stay in touch. You're playing in MLC; I'll watch the games.' He then asked, 'I've lost Virat Kohli's number, can you share it?' I thought, why is he asking for Virat's number? I thought I should ask him, but I didn't want Devon Conway to misunderstand. Then I picked up Virat Kohli's card and gave him a different number,"" Ashwin shared on his YouTube channel.In a separate development, Ashwin recently defended pacer Harshit Rana after earlier questioning his inclusion in India’s ODI squad against Australia.""I have always reiterated that no player should be attacked below the belt. When the attack becomes too personal, the genre changes. I would like to talk about Sanjay Manjrekar, who has criticised me throughout my career. But I have never held any grudge against him. What they say might be right or wrong, as long as the criticism doesn't get personal, I am fine with it,"" Ashwin stated on his YouTube channel.Ashwin also voiced his concern over the psychological toll of harsh social media criticism on young players.""Assume Harshit sees the reel in which he is being harshly criticised, and he is about to play a match for India, wouldn't he be shattered by this? And if his parents and friends see it, what will be their mindset? We can definitely criticise their skill, their style of cricket and the trade that they are plying. But it shouldn't get personal. It may be funny once or twice, but it shouldn't be a running theme. The reason they are doing this is that there is an audience for it. Negativity sells these days. They sell whatever is in demand. We should avoid consuming such content,"" he added.","Ravichandran ashwin was contacted on whatsapp by a person pretending to be adam zampa.

'Unfair at this stage!': Virat Kohli's childhood coach on the treatment of senior duo Virat-Rohit

India face mounting pressure following their disappointing loss in the first ODI against Australia at Perth's Optus Stadium. The match, which was initially anticipated as a celebratory return for Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli, resulted in India conceding a 1-0 series lead.Australia won the toss and elected to field first. The Indian batting lineup struggled to cope with the challenging conditions in a rain-affected match.India managed to score 136/9 in their allocated 26 overs, with the target being adjusted to 131 for Australia through DRS. Both Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli had brief stays at the crease, scoring 8 off 14 balls and 0 off 6 balls respectively.In the bowling department, Arshdeep Singh provided an early breakthrough by dismissing Travis Head. However, the Australian team comfortably achieved the target with seven wickets in hand and 29 balls remaining.The entire Indian bowling attack appeared ineffective, with Harshit Rana receiving particularly harsh criticism from fans. His selection for the series has been a topic of debate, with some suggesting his inclusion was influenced by his association with coach Gautam Gambhir Rana's performance in his four-over spell yielded no wickets while conceding 27 runs.This outcome has intensified the scrutiny surrounding his selection and capabilities at the international level.The Indian team now needs to regroup quickly as they prepare for the second match of the three-game series.

The Indian team's ability to bounce back will be tested in the upcoming Adelaide fixture.The rain-interrupted nature of the first match added to the complexity of the game, but the overall performance has raised questions about the team's adaptability in challenging conditions.India's batting collapse in the shortened format and the inability of their bowling unit to defend even a modest target has become a point of concern for the team management.The return of senior players Rohit and Kohli was expected to strengthen the team, but their early dismissals contributed to India's struggles in the match.The upcoming match in Adelaide presents an opportunity for the team to address these issues and level the series. The focus will be on both individual and collective improvement.Australia's commanding performance in chasing down the target has put additional pressure on India to respond strongly in the second ODI.The loss has sparked discussions about team selection strategies and the balance between giving opportunities to new players while maintaining team performance at the international level.The team management faces the challenge of making necessary adjustments while maintaining confidence in their selected players ahead of the crucial second match.",India conceded a 1-0 series lead to australia in the three-match odi series.

Former Miss Universe Olivia Culpo and San Francisco 49ers star Christian McCaffrey have officially entered a new chapter of their picture-perfect love story, becoming parents. The couple, who welcomed their first child, daughter Colette Annalise, in July 2025, are celebrating a milestone that feels years in the making for fans who have followed their journey from flirtatious Instagram likes to walking down the aisle.Their romance began in 2019, when McCaffrey liked one of Culpo’s Instagram posts, a simple gesture that fans now see as the start of something special. Just months later, the two were spotted vacationing in Mexico, confirming the rumors that a new power couple was emerging.

Patrick Mahomes’ leadership continues to inspire a championship mentality

Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce once again showed why his bond with Patrick Mahomes is one of the strongest in NFL history, not just on the field, but in the locker room as well. Following the Chiefs’ dominant 31–0 win over the Raiders, Kelce opened up about Mahomes’ mindset and leadership, giving fans a glimpse into what keeps Kansas City’s dynasty alive.Despite the Chiefs facing early-season struggles and public doubts about their offensive chemistry, Kelce made it clear that Mahomes’ work ethic has never wavered. “He’s just always gonna do what he can to get better,” Kelce said, reflecting on his quarterback’s consistent pursuit of excellence.The two-time MVP’s preparation and drive have defined the team’s culture under Andy Reid, creating an atmosphere where complacency simply doesn’t exist. “That’s why I love playing with him,” Kelce added. “That’s why this team is gonna get better throughout the year, because we all have that mentality.”Even after multiple Super Bowl titles, the Chiefs’ leaders continue to emphasize growth over glory. Mahomes’ commitment has turned improvement into a habit, one that teammates mirror in every practice and game.Kelce emphasized that Mahomes’ example sets the “tempo” for the entire roster.“Coach challenges us,” he said. “It’s one of those things... you see Pat doing it and it sets the tempo. It never fails to blow me away how good that guy can be.”That tempo has once again become Kansas City’s signature weapon. After being labeled as “in crisis” just weeks ago, the Chiefs have silenced critics with renewed focus and energy.

Shane Beamer dismisses Virginia Tech rumors and tells players he’s fully committed to South Carolina

South Carolina’s struggles only reinforce Beamer’s determination to fix the program

Virginia Tech legacy makes headlines, but Beamer’s future remains firmly in Columbia

Amid a turbulent start to the season and swirling speculation linking him to Virginia Tech, South Carolina coach Shane Beamer made it clear on Sunday that his focus is entirely on his team. With the Gamecocks struggling in the SEC, Beamer reassured both players and fans that his commitment to Columbia has not wavered, and his energy is dedicated to turning around a disappointing start.Beamer addressed a CBS Sports report claiming multiple members of Virginia Tech’s search committee were advocating for his return. The 48-year-old coach, who played at Virginia Tech and later served as an assistant under his father, Hall of Famer Frank Beamer, said the report had no basis and his loyalty lies firmly with South Carolina.“I have no idea where that story came from,” Beamer said during his Sunday teleconference. “I have conveyed publicly many times how much I want to be here. This is my dream job. I said that when I came here, nothing has changed. I am pissed off at the way we are performing right now, and it's not acceptable. I came here to win a championship, and right now we're not getting it done, and my focus right now is on getting it fixed. ... We're in a storm right now that I’m going to get us out of.”He told his team personally that any notion of him seeking a “parachute” or soft landing elsewhere was false, emphasizing that all his attention is on improving the team’s performance.Saturday’s 26-7 loss to No. 14 Oklahoma dropped the Gamecocks to 3-4 overall and 1-4 in SEC play, highlighting a rough patch after a 9-4 season last year. Despite the challenges, Beamer insists that this is a moment to double down on accountability and rebuild the team’s culture.“When you’re 3-4, there’s all kinds of noise and chatter and speculation out there about all kinds of things,” Beamer said. “I wanted to make sure our players understood that I’m not focused on anything but getting this right. And that I’m gonna get it right.”Beamer’s connections to Virginia Tech are deep — he played there from 1995-99 and was an assistant under his father from 2011-15. Frank Beamer, South Carolina’s coaching legend, built the Hokies into a national powerhouse. Yet Shane’s commitment to South Carolina is reinforced by a contract through 2030 that pays $8.15 million this season, with a $5 million buyout if he departs early.While speculation may continue, Beamer’s message is clear: his energy, focus, and loyalty remain with the Gamecocks as he works to turn around a difficult season.Also read: Aryna Sabalenka and boyfriend Georgios Frangulis’ relationship timeline: A complete look at their romance, support, and viral moments so far",South carolina coach shane beamer dismissed speculation linking him to virginia tech.

Brock Purdy injury update : What it means for the 49ers



49ers’ Season outlook hinges on Brock Purdy’s recovery



San Francisco 49ers fans are holding their breath as Brock Purdy’s lingering turf toe injury drags on, threatening to derail the team’s early-season momentum. What was first seen as a minor setback in Week 1 against the Seahawks has snowballed into a prolonged absence, leaving the 49ers leaning on backup Mac Jones. Every update seems to bring more uncertainty, and with playoff hopes on the line, the pressure is mounting both on Purdy and the team.Purdy suffered the injury in the season opener against the Seattle Seahawks and briefly returned in Week 4 against the Jacksonville Jaguars, only to aggravate the toe. NBC reporter Melissa Stark shared that Purdy described the injury as “so annoying” and cautioned that “any movement in the wrong direction could set him back.” The quarterback is dealing with a hyperextension of his right big toe, which tore stabilizing ligaments under the joint—a serious injury that limits planting and pushing off, vital movements for any quarterback.Despite optimism for a potential Week 8 return against the Houston Texans, Purdy himself stressed that he remains “truly day-to-day.” The cautious approach is understandable, given the severity of turf toe and the risk of further setbacks if he returns too soon.Meanwhile, Mac Jones has guided the 49ers to a 3-1 record in his first five starts, proving capable but still unable to replicate the full impact of Purdy’s presence on the field.Purdy’s absence couldn’t come at a worse time. After signing a five-year, $265 million extension, he is the cornerstone of San Francisco’s offense, and the team’s strategy revolves around his return. With key players like Nick Bosa and Fred Warner sidelined for the season, and multiple injuries across the wide receiver corps, the 49ers are navigating a challenging roster landscape.San Francisco’s medical staff is prioritizing long-term health over rushing Purdy back, hoping that a full recovery will allow him to return stronger for the second half of the season. The team remains atop the NFC West at 4-2, but their ceiling is undeniably higher with Purdy at quarterback. Fans can only wait and hope that the star signal-caller returns at full strength, ready to steer the 49ers deep into the playoffs.Also Read: Who Are Kirk Cousins’ Parents?

Poll Who do you think will perform better in the second ODI? Virat Kohli Rohit Sharma

NEW DELHI: A lot of anticipation surrounded the first ODI in Perth, which India lost by seven wickets (DLS), as two of the game’s stalwarts, Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma , returned to the side after months. Both players had already retired from T20Is and Tests, making their comeback in the highly anticipated series opener against Australia at Optus Stadium even more significant.For Kohli, it marked his first ODI appearance since lifting the Champions Trophy on March 9 in Dubai.Virat was in a jovial mood from the start, interacting with teammates, sharing laughs, and cracking jokes.Ahead of the match, during the national anthem, he stopped and asked captain Shubman Gill and vice-captain Shreyas Iyer to lead the team and stand first in the line.However, Kohli’s return ended in disappointing fashion, as he was dismissed for a duck.Watch the video here Australia’s spin-bowling all-rounder Cooper Connolly dived to his left to complete the catch at point. Mitchell Starc thus became the second bowler to dismiss Kohli for a duck twice across all internationals, after James Anderson.Before Kohli’s exit, Rohit Sharma’s eagerly awaited comeback was short-lived. Making his 500th international appearance for India, Rohit was dismissed for eight runs by Josh Hazlewood after edging the ball to second slip, where debutant Matthew Renshaw took the catch.India now turn their attention to the second ODI against Australia, scheduled for Thursday at Adelaide Oval, Adelaide, hoping to bounce back and level the series after a tough start in Perth.","India lost the first odi against australia by seven wickets in perth.

Arshdeep Singh Press Conference After IND vs AUS 1st ODI: Praises Captain Gill, Backs Virat Kohli

NEW DELHI: Cricket legend Sunil Gavaskar has expressed confidence that Indian stalwarts Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma will bounce back strongly in the second ODI against Australia in Adelaide, following their disappointing returns in Perth. Gavaskar said it would be no surprise if the two senior batters deliver big scores, emphasising that it’s only a matter of time and practice before they regain their rhythm.Kohli and Rohit returned to international cricket after a seven-month break but struggled on Perth’s challenging surface, scoring 0 and 8 respectively. Australia capitalised on India’s batting collapse to secure a comfortable seven-wicket win, taking a 1-0 lead in the three-match series.Gavaskar defended the duo, stressing that adjusting to Perth’s bounce after such a long layoff was always going to be difficult.“They were playing on probably the bounciest pitch in Australia. It wasn’t going to be easy, especially for players who haven’t played international cricket for a couple of months. It was challenging even for Shubman Gill and Shreyas Iyer, who play regularly,” Gavaskar was quoted as saying by India Today.The former India captain remained optimistic about India’s prospects, pointing out that once Kohli and Rohit spend more time at the crease and in the nets, they’ll quickly rediscover their touch.“India are still a very, very good team. Don’t be surprised if Rohit and Kohli score big in the next two games. The more they play, the more time they spend in the nets, the quicker they’ll find their rhythm. Once they’re back among the runs, India’s total will be 300, 300-plus,” Gavaskar added.The second ODI in Adelaide presents ideal conditions for a turnaround, particularly for Kohli, who has an outstanding record at the venue.In four ODIs at Adelaide Oval, he has scored 244 runs at an average of 61, including two centuries.His Test record there is even more remarkable, with 537 runs in five matches at an average of 53.70, featuring three hundreds.","Viat kohli and rohit sharma returned to international cricket after a seven-month break.

Poll Do you think India will secure a spot in the World Cup semifinals? Yes, they will win at least two matches. No, they will struggle in the remaining matches.

Trikweze Bridges and Caelen Carson to fill key roles in Dallas’ secondary



The Dallas Cowboys will face a major defensive challenge this Sunday as star cornerback Trevon Diggs has been sidelined for the matchup against the Washington Commanders. Head coach Brian Schottenheimer confirmed Friday that Diggs entered concussion protocol following an accident at home on Thursday night, ruling him out for the upcoming game.Diggs’ absence comes at a critical time for the Cowboys, whose defense is struggling this season, ranking near the bottom in both yards and points allowed. Despite this setback, Schottenheimer emphasized that the team’s defensive strategy remains intact. “It doesn’t change. We adjust always on defense when we get into gamedays anyway,” he said, signaling confidence in the team’s game plan against a high-powered Commanders offense.To fill the void left by Diggs, the Cowboys will rely on backup players such as Trikweze Bridges and Caelen Carson. Bridges has impressed during practices, showing readiness to step up, while Carson could return to bolster the secondary. Schottenheimer underscored the NFL’s “next man up” philosophy, stressing that the team is prepared to adapt and execute its plan despite missing a key starter.The Cowboys’ defensive struggles make Diggs’ absence particularly significant.Analysts expect the Commanders to test Dallas’ secondary early and often, putting pressure on linebackers and safeties to cover gaps and force turnovers. The performance of Bridges and Carson could be decisive in keeping the Cowboys competitive and limiting scoring opportunities for Washington.Player safety remains a top priority, and details about the severity of Diggs’ condition are still emerging. Schottenheimer confirmed that Diggs was evaluated by the team’s medical staff on Friday, with updates pending as he progresses through concussion protocol. The Cowboys are focused on his well-being while preparing for a crucial NFC East matchup.As Sunday’s game approaches, the focus shifts to how the Dallas Cowboys will adjust without Trevon Diggs.

Vegas Golden Knights goalie Carter Hurt has made his long-awaited return to the NHL after his controversial long court battle. After a prolonged absence from professional hockey due to the charges pressed against him of sexual assault in a high-profile case, Hurt is joining the Vegas Golden Knights on a professional contract tryout, as the team claimed on Thursday. However, reports suggest that Hart and the others are not eligible to play in games until December 1, as part of the league’s reinstatement process for him. Let’ take a closer look at what the goaltender has to say about his return to the league after a long hiatus. NHL goalie Carter Hurt has made his long-awaited return to the league on Thursday, as announced by the Vegas Golden Knights on Thursday. The goalie has joined the team on a professional tryout contract basis, following a long-fought legal battle. Earlier, Hart played six seasons with the Philadelphia Flyers before stepping away from the game amid significant legal and organizational developments.Following the signing of the contract with the Golden Knights, the goaltender stated, “I’m beyond grateful, excited, and honored to be part of the Golden Knights.” He further said, “It’s been a long road to get back to this point, getting back to playing the game of hockey, the game that I love.I’ve been out of the game for a year and a half now. I’ve learned a lot. I’ve grown a lot. Just excited to move forward.”On his joining, the Vegas Golden Knights officially announced that, “Following the reinstatement decision agreed on by the National Hockey League and the National Hockey League Players’ Association, goaltender Carter Hart will be joining the Vegas Golden Knights organization.”In addition to this, the team stated, “The Golden Knights are aligned with the process and assessment that the NHL and NHLPA made in their decision. We remain committed to the core values that have defined our organization from its inception and expect that our players will continue to meet these standards moving forward.”Carter Hart is resuming his career at the age of 27 with the Vegas Golden Knights after spending his first six seasons playing for Philadelphia. The Flyers last month ruled out bringing back Hart, whose camp communicated to general manager Daniel Briere that a fresh start was a better option.In 2024, he was among five members of Canada’s 2018 World Junior Championship team charged with sexual assault in relation to an alleged incident in London, Ontario. On July 24, 2025, Ontario Superior Court Justice Maria Carroccia acquitted Hart and the others, citing insufficient credible evidence to support the charges.After a prolonged legal battle, the NHL and NHL Players’ Association later imposed a reinstatement process, stating that the players are now eligible to sign contracts beginning October 15, 2025, and to participate in regular-season games from December 1, 2025.","Nhl goalie carter hurt makes his long-awaited return, joins the golden knights.
