Mike Hesson on India's handshake snub: 'We were disappointed that our opposition didn't do that'

NEW DELHI: India’s commanding seven-wicket victory over Pakistan in the Asia Cup on Sunday may have looked routine on the scoreboard, but the aftermath turned the Dubai International Stadium into the stage of a diplomatic drama. Pakistan skipper Salman Ali Agha refused to attend the post-match presentation ceremony in protest after Indian players declined to shake hands, an incident now at the centre of what many are calling “handshake-gate.”The flashpoint unfolded moments after India captain Suryakumar Yadav sealed the match with a towering six. Instead of waiting to exchange the customary handshakes with his opponents, Suryakumar shook hands only with batting partner Shivam Dube before leading his teammates straight into the dressing room. Within seconds, India’s support staff shut the door, leaving Pakistan’s players stranded in the middle of the ground.Pakistan head coach Mike Hesson expressed frustration at the snub. “We were ready to shake hands at the end of the game. We are disappointed that the opposition did not do that. We went over there and they were already gone to the changing room, so that was obviously a disappointing way to finish the match,” he told reporters.The Pakistani players lingered on the field for a couple of minutes before retreating. Hesson, visibly agitated, rushed towards India’s dressing room, only to find the doors locked. He was later spotted in a tense conversation with match referee Andy Pycroft. In solidarity with his team, captain Salman Ali Agha chose not to appear at the post-match presentation, leaving broadcasters scrambling.Pakistan’s team management confirmed their protest in a statement. “The behaviour of Indian players was against the spirit of sportsmanship. That is why skipper (Salman) Agha was not sent to the post-match ceremony,” it read.India, however, stood firm. At his press conference, skipper Suryakumar Yadav said: “The team was aligned with the government and Board of Control for Cricket in India in not shaking hands with the Pakistan team. We stand with the victims and families of the Pahalgam terror attack and we express our solidarity. We want to dedicate today’s win to the armed forces.”The political overtones were impossible to ignore. The match was the first between the neighbours since a military conflict in May. That escalation followed an April terror attack in Pahalgam, Kashmir, which India accused Pakistan of supporting.While India’s spinners and Suryakumar’s unbeaten 47 scripted a dominant on-field win, the real talking point was India's refusal to shake hands after the match and Pakistan’s captain protesting in silence — by refusing to show up at the presentation, amplifying the rift that cricket could not bridge.",India captain suryakumar yadav refused to shake hands with pakistan players.

Suryakumar Yadav's Instagram post

Despite being a one-sided contest filled with standout individual performances, the India–Pakistan clash at the Dubai International Stadium may still go down as the tournament’s most talked-about game — but for reasons beyond cricket.By Monday morning, the ‘handshake-gate’ will dominate the popular narrative on social media feeds and airwaves, and be a hot topic of conversation at water coolers and coffee machines in schools and offices.The cast of characters — Team India captain Suryakumar Yadav , his counterpart Salman Ali Agha, Pakistan head coach Mike Hesson, and match referee Andy Pycroft — were all involved in the drama.As is cricket’s longstanding tradition, the players usually “shake hands and make up” after the game. They do it for the sake of sportsmanship.However, the Indian cricket players were not in a mood to forgive and forget, and instead took a stand for all the victims of the Pahalgam terror attack Team India captain Suryakumar Yadav posted on Instagram: ""This win is dedicated to the armed forces of India and the victims of the Pahalgam attack. Jai Hind.""Surya's deputy Shubman Gill echoed his skipper's sentiments. He wrote on Instagram: ""Today’s win is dedicated to the victims of Pahalgam and to our brave armed forces who continue to safeguard us.The spirit of India lives on both on and off the field. Jai Hind.""Interestingly, at the start of the tournament, Team India captain Suryakumar Yadav, during the captains’ press conference, shook hands with Mohsin Naqvi, chief of the Asian Cricket Council (ACC), president of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), and also Pakistan's Federal Interior Minister. But he refused to shake hands with his counterpart Salman Ali Agha — first at the toss and later at the end of the match.Suryakumar hit the winning six to finish the game, walked towards batting partner Shivam Dube, shook his hand, and then walked off, leaving the Pakistani players in the middle of the ground.The Pakistan team, led by Salman Ali Agha, stood in the middle for a couple of minutes before starting to walk back to their dressing room.Seeing his players head back, Pakistan coach Mike Hesson raced towards Team India’s dressing room, but by then the doors were shut.A visibly upset Hesson was seen having a long conversation with match referee Andy Pycroft. After standing there for four to five minutes, a frustrated Hesson walked back towards the pitch.In response, Salman Ali Agha skipped the post-match presentation in protest against the behaviour of the Indian team, as the ceremony host was also an Indian — former India captain and coach Ravi Shastri.India captain Suryakumar Yadav defended the snub in his post-match press conference, saying that the team was ""aligned with the government and the Board of Control for Cricket in India"" in not shaking hands with the Pakistan team.""We stand with the victims and families of the Pahalgam terror attack and we express our solidarity,"" Suryakumar said. ""We want to dedicate today's win to the armed forces.""Pakistan's head coach Mike Hesson told reporters he was ""disappointed"" with the Indian team's decision.""We were ready to shake hands at the end of the game,"" the former Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) coach said.""We are disappointed that the opposition did not do that. We went over there and they had already gone to the changing room, so that was obviously a disappointing way to finish the match.""Team India head coach, while talking to the broadcasters, hailed the team’s stand.“The match was important for us because as a team we wanted to show our solidarity to the families of the victims of the Pahalgam terror attack, for everything they have gone through. More importantly, we want to thank our armed forces for their successful Operation Sindoor, and I’m sure we will try and make our country proud and happy,” Gambhir told Sony Sports Network.It was the first time that the arch-rivals faced off in a cricket match since the Pahalgam terror attacks earlier this year in April.TimesofIndia.com had reported that the boycott trend on social media was discussed by the players in the team meeting, which was later confirmed by assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate at the press conference.""We obviously are aware of the sentiments and the strong feelings. And Gauti’s (coach Gautam Gambhir ’s) message has just been very professional, about not worrying about things that are not in our control,” he had said.However, at the end of the game Team India players didn’t take their coach's advice of being ""professional"" to heart and instead did the opposite.And yes, India did win the match comprehensively by seven wickets and cemented their place in the Super Four, where they might again face Pakistan.","Team india captain suryakumar yadav refused to shake hands with pakistan's salman ali agha at the toss and later at the end of the match.

Sidney Crosby and the trade whispers



What the future holds for Sidney Crosby



For nearly two decades, Sidney Crosby has been the face of the Pittsburgh Penguins, but reports suggest the bond may finally be fraying. The franchise’s timeline no longer matches the ambitions of its captain, raising speculation that the three-time Stanley Cup champion could consider life outside the Black and Yellow. While nothing appears imminent, insiders believe this is the closest Crosby has ever come to pondering a future away from Pittsburgh.The thought of Crosby leaving Pittsburgh once felt impossible. Yet cracks are beginning to show. “I never thought a Crosby trade was imaginable. Now, I’m not so sure,” wrote The Athletic’s Josh Yohe, pointing to growing frustration with the Penguins’ struggles.The Penguins, built on an aging core, no longer look like a contender. Meanwhile, the NHL is watching closely, knowing that if Crosby ever gives the green light, a bidding war would erupt. Among potential destinations, the Montreal Canadiens stand out. Elliotte Friedman revealed on his 32 Thoughts Podcast that Montreal’s front office may already be shaping decisions with Crosby in mind, saying, “[Canadiens’] Jeff Gorton and Kent Hughes are they sitting there and saying ‘we’re not doing anything with X player because we think it may prevent us from doing a Crosby deal‘.Montreal not only offers Crosby a shot at fulfilling his childhood dream but also the chance to mentor a young core hungry for playoff success. A move north would instantly inject leadership and championship pedigree into a team still learning to win.Despite the noise, a trade remains unlikely before the 2025-26 season. Crosby reportedly wants to finish this year alongside Evgeni Malkin, honoring their shared legacy in Pittsburgh. At the same time, distractions from a move to a market like Montreal could pull focus away from his primary goal: representing Canada at the 2026 Winter Olympics.The decision, whenever it comes, will not be taken lightly. Crosby has built his career on loyalty and excellence, but time is not on his side. The choice may eventually come down to chasing a final Stanley Cup or staying with the team that defined his career. Either way, when Sidney Crosby makes his move, the NHL will never look the same.Also Read: Oilers GM addresses Connor McDavid contract uncertainty, urges fans to avoid panic while stressing team’s championship priorities","Sidney crosby has been the face of the pittsburgh penguins for nearly two decades.

KaVontae Turpin shines before injury scare



KaVontae Turpin remains vital to Cowboys game plan



The Dallas Cowboys breathed a sigh of relief after their nail-biting 40-37 overtime win against the New York Giants in Week 2. Wide receiver and return specialist KaVontae Turpin, who left the field with a scary neck injury, now appears to have avoided serious damage. Early reports from the team point toward encouraging signs, easing the concerns of both fans and teammates.Turpin’s impact was felt long before he exited the game. On a second-half kickoff return, he went down awkwardly, sparking immediate worry. Yet his numbers on the day spoke volumes about his importance. The explosive wideout piled up 157 all-purpose yards, including four catches for 47 yards, two carries for six yards, and an impressive 102 kick return yards. He also found the end zone, a key contribution in helping Dallas bounce back from their Week 1 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles.Offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer delivered a reassuring update after tests were conducted, telling reporters, “Sounds like most of the tests have come back pretty clear.” Those words provide the Cowboys not only relief but also momentum as they prepare for their next matchup against the Chicago Bears.A two-time Pro Bowler, Turpin brings a rare blend of speed and versatility that transforms Dallas’ offense and special teams. Whether stretching the field as a receiver or flipping momentum with electric returns, he is a player opposing defenses and coverage units must account for. His presence also offers stability for quarterback Dak Prescott, who benefits from the field position and explosive options Turpin creates.As the Cowboys eye Week 3, his potential availability changes the outlook. Injury scares often shape the tone of a season, but in this case, the news fuels optimism rather than setback. For now, it seems Dallas avoided a major blow, and Turpin remains a key weapon in their push to stay competitive in a loaded NFC.Also Read: Brittany Mahomes’ fiery red crop top look goes viral as baby Sterling enjoys her Arrowhead Chiefs debut","Dallas cowboys wide receiver kavontae turpin suffered a neck injury against the new york giants in week 2.

Chiefs stumble, but Brittany Mahomes shines



It was a frustrating Sunday for Kansas City Chiefs fans as the team fell 20-17 to the Philadelphia Eagles in a Super Bowl rematch. Yet, amid the tension and disappointment on the field, Brittany Mahomes, wife of quarterback Patrick Mahomes , managed to steal the spotlight with a heartfelt and stylish appearance at Arrowhead Stadium.While Taylor Swift ’s presence usually dominates pregame buzz, this time the pop icon reportedly made a discreet entrance behind a “hidden wall,” leaving Brittany Mahomes as the center of attention among Chiefs’ WAGs.

The sweet mother-daughter moment quickly became a highlight of the day.Even though she didn’t post her usual game-day fits on social media, Brittany’s look and presence spoke volumes. Fans caught her cheering from the stands, embracing the role of both supportive wife and doting mom. Golden’s first game at GEHA Field made the moment even more memorable, turning what could have been a gloomy day into a family celebration.For Kansas City, the loss carried extra weight. It marked Andy Reid’s first 0-2 start since 2014 and extended Patrick Mahomes’ losing streak to three games, a rare stretch dating back to last season’s Super Bowl.The Chiefs struggled to find rhythm, leaving fans searching for silver linings.Brittany, however, offered one. Her recent posts from her 30th birthday bash in Nashville, where she shared a glamorous selfie with Taylor Swift and showcased a bold cowgirl look, already had fans buzzing.

Strategic Implications of this Golden State Warriors Trade

Theare reportedly considering a blockbuster trade for., a move that could reshape the Western Conference landscape. With Stephen Curry entering the final stages of his career, the Warriors are weighing bold risks to extend their championship window, while Memphis faces a transitional phase after trading Desmond Bane to the Orlando Magic.Golden State is preparing a significant offer built around its young talent and draft assets. The proposed package may include Jonathan Kuminga, Moses Moody, and three future first-round draft picks (2026, 2029, 2031). Pick swaps and the inclusion of Brandin Podziemski have also been floated.A sign-and-trade involving Kuminga’s new contract could help the Warriors navigate salary cap challenges while keeping core veterans like Draymond Green and Jimmy Butler. For Memphis, this package would align with its decision to pivot after moving Bane, centering the roster around Ja Morant and opening financial flexibility.Landing Jaren Jackson Jr. gives the Golden State Warriors a 25-year-old Defensive Player of the Year and former All-Star who averages over 20 points per game while shooting 37.5% from deep. His versatility on defense complements Draymond Green, while offensively, he provides another reliable scorer next to Curry and Butler.Financially, Jackson’s $35 million cap hit for 2025-26 is manageable, making the deal feasible without destabilizing the roster. Most importantly, the Golden State Warriors inject youth and athleticism into a veteran core that remains focused on winning now.For Jaren Jackson Jr., the move could mean stepping into a title-contending environment filled with championship pedigree. Playing alongside Curry in a system built on ball movement and spacing might elevate his offensive game.Relocating to the Bay Area also enhances his visibility and marketability. However, the adjustment comes with challenges: sharing the spotlight with established stars and shouldering expectations in one of the league’s most scrutinized markets.Memphis would gain significant draft capital and promising players to reshape the roster around Ja Morant. Moving Jackson frees up long-term salary obligations and provides flexibility for future roster adjustments.The Grizzlies’ decision would be risky, as parting ways with a Defensive Player of the Year-level player is never easy. Still, it may represent a necessary step in refreshing their trajectory after falling short of playoff breakthroughs.• For Warriors: Elite defensive upgrade, proven scorer, long-term fit alongside Curry, Butler, and Green.• For Jackson: Chance to compete for a championship, offensive development in Warriors’ system, bigger market exposure.• For Grizzlies: Draft picks for rebuilding, salary relief, roster flexibility, commitment to Morant’s leadership.• For Warriors: Loss of promising young players and multiple future first-rounders could hurt long-term flexibility.• For Jackson: New pressures in a high-stakes market, role adjustment next to multiple stars.• For Grizzlies: Losing a cornerstone defensive star, uncertainty if draft assets translate into success.Jackson recently signed a five-year, $240 million max extension starting next season. Despite the size of the deal, his 2025-26 cap figure is relatively modest at $35 million. This makes the trade workable for Golden State without creating immediate financial strain. For Memphis, the deal provides long-term relief and strategic flexibility.This potential trade captures the delicate balance between present-day contention and future building. Golden State’s willingness to part with young assets and picks reflects urgency to maximize Curry’s remaining prime years. Memphis, meanwhile, appears ready to prioritize long-term sustainability, even at the cost of losing one of its brightest young stars.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Los Angeles Lakers Predicted to Land $240 Million Utah Jazz Superstar to Support LeBron James and Luka Doncic in Title Push If finalized, this deal could become one of the defining moves of the 2025-26 season.

Bucs’ offensive and defensive starters hit with injuries

Baker Mayfield’s condition leaves Bucs in uncertainty



Tampa Bay’s injury troubles are mounting fast in their early-season matchup, raising serious concerns for the team’s playoff hopes. In what should have been a strategic battle, the Buccaneers are now scrambling to stay competitive as injuries pile up before halftime.Right tackle Luke Goedeke was the first to leave the field after suffering a foot injury, forcing Tampa Bay to adjust their offensive line on the fly. Losing a key blocker so early puts immense pressure on quarterback Baker Mayfield, whose mobility and pocket protection are already tested.The defensive front also took a hit. Calijah Kancey, one of the team’s most promising defensive linemen, was seen being evaluated after a pectoral injury. His presence in stopping the run and pressuring the quarterback has been a bright spot for the Bucs this season, and his potential absence could weaken an already struggling defensive line.Most alarming was Baker Mayfield appearing to hold his knee after taking a brutal sack from Danielle Hunter. Mayfield has shown resilience this season, but repeated hits have raised questions about his durability. His ability to continue in the second half is uncertain, and the Bucs’ offensive rhythm heavily depends on his leadership.Head coach Todd Bowles and his staff now face the challenge of making swift halftime adjustments. “We’re going to see what we can do.

How Charlie Kirk’s conservative views are changing NFL fan culture and game-day atmosphere in 2025,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/how-charlie-kirks-conservative-views-are-changing-nfl-fan-culture-and-game-day-atmosphere-in-2025/articleshow/123900215.cms,"In 2025, the NFL navigates a cultural shift as conservative commentator Charlie Kirk's messages resonate with specific fan groups, emphasizing patriotism and tradition.

Why Charlie Kirk’s voice resonates with specific NFL fan groups

How this political influence is changing the game-day experience

In 2025, the NFL has become far more than just a sports league—it’s a powerful cultural battleground. Conservative commentator Charlie Kirk has emerged as a key figure influencing fan behavior, social media conversations, and the overall atmosphere at NFL games. His messages of patriotism, tradition, and opposition to ""woke culture"" are finding an audience among certain segments of NFL fans, while stirring controversy in others.Charlie Kirk’s emphasis on American pride, family values, and tradition strongly appeals to older generations, rural and suburban fans, and military or veteran supporters. These fans often view football Sunday as a celebration of community and national identity.Kirk’s followers are not shy about displaying their support—many bring signs echoing his language, stand louder during the national anthem, or share his clips on social media. One notable fan behavior in 2025 includes more vigorous patriotic chants and wearing merchandise featuring Kirk’s slogans during games.However, the reaction isn’t universal. Younger, progressive NFL fans argue that the league should focus solely on the sport, not politics.“Sports should remain neutral,” many of these fans argue online, calling for players’ skills and performance to take center stage instead of political narratives. Social media now serves as a virtual stadium where Kirk’s views are shared alongside game highlights, often sparking fierce debates in the comments of NFL posts.The political divide extends into the stadium experience itself. Some fans see anthem ceremonies and military tributes as unifying moments, while others view them as politicized distractions. Coaches and players are not immune either, often mediating tensions in locker rooms caused by the growing cultural divide. As a result, the NFL increasingly reflects the broader cultural wars shaping America today.Also Read: Which NFL stadium is hosting Charlie Kirk’s public funeral service and what makes it significant Going forward, the NFL faces a critical decision: embrace this politicized identity or risk alienating fans seeking a pure sports experience.","In 2025, the nfl navigates a cultural shift as conservative commentator charlie kirk's messages resonate with specific fan groups.

India’s Handshake Snub at Asia Cup Leaves Pakistan in Full Meltdown, ICC Dragged Into Drama

Former India captain Sourav Ganguly had little patience for Sunday’s Asia Cup clash between India and Pakistan in Dubai, admitting that the one-sided nature of the contest made him switch channels to football’s Manchester derby.“I am actually not surprised by what I saw. I actually stopped watching after the first 15 overs and started watching Manchester United and Man City (in English Premier League),” Ganguly quipped on Monday.India cruised to a seven-wicket victory over Pakistan, extending a decade-long dominance.But the post-match buzz was dominated by controversy after Indian players collectively refused to shake hands with their opponents as a mark of solidarity with victims of the Pahalgam terror attack . Pakistan later lodged a formal complaint with the ICC, terming the act “unsporting.”Ganguly side-stepped the handshake debate but made his position clear on the bigger picture.“Terror must stop, that's most important, all around the world, not just India and Pakistan. You've seen so many things happening, so that also must stop. But sports also cannot stop. Terror has to stop all around the world,” he said.Asked about the players’ actions, he deferred responsibility.“You will have to ask Suryakumar Yadav, he has to answer. I'm too far, launching my ethnic brand.He's also answered it... Everyone has their own side of the story, that's what it is,” Ganguly remarked.On the cricketing side, the former BCCI president was blunt about Pakistan’s decline.“Pakistan are no match. I say that with respect, it's just because I've seen their team was. It's the lack of quality in the side,” he said.For Ganguly, the India–Pakistan hype no longer matches reality.“There is no competition… I would rather watch India play Australia, South Africa, New Zealand, England, Sri Lanka or even Afghanistan. I don’t think India and Pakistan are a contest anymore. We keep hyping it and for the last five years every hype has been shattered.

‘I got your back more than your spine’: Jilly Anais outshines Cleveland Browns with birthday love note for Deshaun Watson



Deshaun Watson’s career in Cleveland remains defined by controversy and injuries



Deshaun Watson and Jilly Anais have built a relationship that withstands public scrutiny



Cleveland Browns quarterback Deshaun Watson turned 30 on Sept. 14, and the reaction was split. While fans dragged the Browns for posting about him at all, Watson’s wife Jilly Anais doubled down with a message that left no doubt about her loyalty.On Instagram, Anais called Watson her “greatest gift” and shared photos from their wedding, trips, and sideline moments. “From 23 to 30, I’ve had the privilege of walking through every season with you. Every day, I’m in awe of the way you rise, love, and endure,” she wrote. She ended the post with “I got your back more than your spine.. beleeDat! Cheers to a new decade! 30 looks good on you baby 😋💛.”The Browns’ own birthday tribute to Watson drew a far different reaction. Their social media post was flooded with angry comments from fans upset about his sexual misconduct allegations and lackluster on-field results. Messages like “read the room” and “still time to delete this” dominated the replies. Anais’ post, in contrast, was personal and unapologetic, reaffirming her place at Watson’s side.The Browns traded three first-round picks, a third-rounder, and two fourth-rounders to the Houston Texans for Watson in March 2022.They immediately gave him a five-year, $230 million fully guaranteed contract, which is now widely regarded as one of the most damaging deals in NFL history.Watson has played just 19 games in three seasons with Cleveland, going 9-10. An 11-game suspension in 2022 over sexual misconduct claims and multiple major injuries have derailed his time in Cleveland. He tore his Achilles in Week 7 of 2024 and re-injured it during rehab in January 2025, ending his season before it began.Though Watson has settled nearly all lawsuits, and two grand juries declined to pursue charges, the allegations continue to follow him. For many Browns fans, his $230 million contract has become a symbol of wasted resources and broken trust.Anais and Watson began dating in 2019, and she has stayed visible through his injuries, suspensions, and off-field accusations. In March 2025, Watson proposed with a $2.5 million diamond ring. The couple married in July on a Miami yacht, choosing the date to mark the anniversary of their first outing together.Anais has consistently described Watson as her motivation and safe place. Watson, in turn, has praised her character and faith. On Sunday, alongside his wife’s tribute, he posted his own message: “Lord, Thank you for allowing me to see another year of Life! Being able to go into a new chapter with an Elevated Mind is one of the best blessings you’ve given me!”While the Browns face 2025 with Joe Flacco starting and rookies Dillon Gabriel and Shedeur Sanders waiting behind him, Watson’s return remains uncertain. But Anais’ birthday post showed she is unshaken, keeping the spotlight on her support as much as his career.",Jilly anais celebrated deshaun watson’s 30th birthday with a heartfelt instagram post amid backlash against the cleveland browns quarterback.

The Detroit Lions didn’t just bounce back in Week 2 — they stomped the Chicago Bears into the turf at Ford Field. Coming off a sloppy Week 1 loss to the Green Bay Packers, head coach Dan Campbell and new offensive coordinator John Morton led the Lions to a massive 52–21 victory on Sunday. Quarterback Jared Goff threw five touchdowns. The offense put up 500+ yards. The defense overwhelmed rookie QB Caleb Williams. But the moment that really captured the postgame buzz? A single, silent Instagram post from Dan Campbell’s wife.Hours after the game, Holly Campbell posted a single photo on her Instagram: a giant, scratched-up lion hoisting a tiny bear cub in its mouth. No caption. No hashtags. The message landed instantly. Detroit didn’t just beat Chicago — they owned them. Fans immediately picked up on the symbolism, and the post quickly went viral across NFL fan circles. It was savage, sure, but also hilarious. And for many Lions fans, it was the perfect way to sum up what this win meant after a rocky offseason and a disappointing Week 1.From the very first drive, Detroit looked locked in. Running back Jahmyr Gibbs scored early, and the offense never took its foot off the gas.Amon-Ra St. Brown caught three touchdowns. The Lions averaged 8.8 yards per play — a franchise record — and pushed the score to 52–21 by the final whistle. And just to put an exclamation point on it, Dan Campbell called a gutsy fourth-and-goal in the fourth quarter with the game already well in hand. Goff found St. Brown for his third score of the day. Asked about it after the game, Bears head coach Ben Johnson didn’t seem thrilled. He said, “What’s he supposed to do? It’s fourth-and-goal, what do you want him to do? Yeah, he could’ve kicked a field goal, they don’t kick field goals, they go for it there.”This game carried more weight than most. Ben Johnson was the offensive mastermind behind Detroit’s top-ranked offense in 2024. When he took the Bears’ head coaching job after the Lions’ playoff loss, fans felt betrayed – and so did some inside the building.Inside the locker room, he kept the focus on the team. “Man, there’s nothing like gettin’ your first win of the season… and playing better than we did last week. A lot freakin’ better.” But outside the locker room, Holly Campbell’s post spoke louder than any press conference ever could.",The detroit lions beat the chicago bears 52–21 on sunday.

Tired of too many ads? go ad free now

Taylor Swift has always been very concerned about her safety and has mostly missed away games of Travis Kelce’s Kansas City Chiefs due to security concerns. With yesterday’s match being the Chiefs’ first home game of the season, fans were expecting to catch a glimpse of Taylor Swift. But many were left disappointed but fans feel it is because of what might have happened to Charlie Kirk and the other gun violence incidents that happened over the last few days.According to FOX Sports, Taylor Swift did arrive at the Arrowhead Stadium to cheer on Travis Kelce but the billionaire pop star used a large movable wall to sneak into the stadium.Now, fans are very concerned about her safety. A fan by the username @wompingwillowx wrote, “anyone unable to tell this is for her safety is either really dense or mentally immature. she isn’t hiding behind a bullet proof barrier for an easter egg. like bffr. everything that happened last week, people are insane. she wanted to go watch her fiancé in peace and safety.”Another fan by the username @roadnoz wrote, “After what happened this week with all the shootings I’m sure their taking extreme measures for her safety.”A third fan by the username @yeswhaleswiftie posted, “Also not a single camera, at least from what I’ve been watching, has even TRIED to sneak a peak of her in that suite. Shows that this has been discussed by a lot of people and it’s probably for her safety.”·Another fan by the username @humcupcake wrote, “I hate to even bring this up, but do we think this could be about enhanced security due to everything that has been happening?”

Stephanie Niles’ outfit goes viral during Bengals game



Who is Stephanie Niles?

When Jake Browning took the field for the Bengals this week, fans expected him to make headlines for his arm, not his love life. But while Browning delivered in his big moment, it was his girlfriend, Stephanie Niles, who had the internet buzzing. Her bold gameday outfit turned just as many heads as his play, sparking viral debate, social media cheers, and plenty of “who is she?” curiosity.Sitting front row in Cincinnati orange, Niles showed up in a halter top with Browning’s jersey number on the front paired with standout orange leather pants. The look was anything but subtle- a playful, backless design that instantly made her one of the most talked-about figures of the night. Cameras caught her celebrating during the game and later sharing a sweet postgame moment with Browning, cementing her place as a viral star alongside the Bengals QB.Sports blogs quickly jumped on the clip, calling her outfit “risky,” “immodest,” and even “game-winning in its own right.” For Bengals fans, though, it was simply another reason to celebrate, Browning getting the win on the field and the couple serving major spotlight energy off of it.It didn’t take long for social media to light up. TikTok edits and X posts flooded timelines, some praising Niles as “the real MVP,” while others argued the outfit was “too much” for the sidelines. Still, the majority of comments leaned supportive, with fans joking that she “stole the show” and comparing her to some of the NFL’s most iconic WAGs.For those suddenly curious, Niles isn’t new to the Bengals community. She and Browning have been engaged and frequently share glimpses of their relationship on Instagram. Now, with Browning stepping into a bigger role for Cincinnati, it looks like Niles will be more in the public eye too, something Bengals fans don’t seem to mind.Browning’s strong showing on the field was the moment he’s been waiting for, but it was that postgame interaction with Niles, hugs, smiles, and all that truly sealed the night. Between the win and the viral spotlight, the couple has suddenly become one of the NFL’s unexpected storylines this season.If Browning keeps this momentum going, expect to see a lot more of Stephanie Niles in the stands and all over social media for months to come.Also read - “So in love”: Miley Cyrus gushes over Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce’s fairytale romance","Stephanie niles’ outfit goes viral during bengals game.

Jayson Tatum and Tyrese Haliburton nearly got their hands on a $1 million paycheck



NBA stars Tyrese Haliburton and Jason Tatum are dealing with injuries



The two crown jewels of the NBA , Jayson Tatum and Tyrese Haliburton, are currently on the sidelines due to injuries throughout the offseason. So, the talented NBA player duo decided to switch things up and head for a major event in Atlantic City amidst their road to recovery. However, despite their presence, Tatum and Haliburton missed out on a million dollars in an interesting twist.Jayson Tatum and Tyrese Haliburton were in attendance for the second edition of the Casino Night Gala, hosted by REFORM alliance in Atlantic City. It is one of the most significant philanthropic events. This year, it raised more than $20 million for criminal justice reform, and the NBA star player duo were in the spotlight alongside other top invitees.American journalist Taylor Rooks posted photos from the event on her Instagram. In some of those snaps in her carousel, it was revealed that a competition was held for the invitees to win $1 million. Unfortunately, the magicians of the NBA court failed in their quest at the event, as the winners were other people.Furthermore, Rooks herself entered the contest and made it to the semi-finals, missing out on the prize herself.Apart from them, the other NBA stars who lost the contest at the Casino Night Gala were Karl-Anthony Towns, Devin Booker, and Trey Murphy III, as seen in Rooks' Instagram post, so it was not such a victorious night for the basketball stalwarts outside the court.While they were shining bright at the Casino Night Gala, Tyrese Haliburton and Jason Tatum suffered injuries during the NBA playoffs. Tatum, who plays for the Boston Celtics, tore his Achilles tendon in a match against the New York Knicks. On the other hand, the Indiana Pacers player Haliburton also injured his Achilles in Game 7 of the NBA Finals against the Thunder a few weeks later.However, after a tough six-week period, Tatum was back on his feet and attended the annual Jayson Tatum Foundation Charity event in St. Louis. Similarly, Haliburton hosted a camp for young players for three weeks and recently revealed that he was out of his precautionary boot. With both NBA stars rehabilitating at their best, it seems that they will be ready to go when the NBA season begins.Also read: Former NBA Champion Andrew Bogut reveals how Charlie Kirk's death posed an impact on Australians

Suryakumar Yadav statement on Pahalgam to handshake drama: How India HUMILIATED Pakistan

Poll Was Suryakumar Yadav's dedication of the win to the armed forces appropriate? Yes, it's a meaningful gesture. No, it mixed sports with politics.

PCB Chairman Mohsin Naqvi's post

The controversy over the missing handshakes in the high-voltage Asia Cup clash between India and Pakistan has escalated into a full-blown row, with the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) formally lodging a complaint with the International Cricket Council (ICC).PCB Chairman Mohsin Naqvi confirmed on Monday that the board has demanded “an immediate removal of the Match Referee from the Asia Cup” over alleged violations of the ICC Code of Conduct and MCC Laws pertaining to the Spirit of Cricket.“The PCB has lodged a complaint with the ICC regarding violations by the Match Referee of the ICC Code of Conduct and the MCC Laws pertaining to the Spirit of Cricket. The PCB has demanded an immediate removal of the Match Referee from the Asia Cup,” Naqvi posted on X.The flashpoint came during the toss at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium when Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha and Indian skipper Suryakumar Yadav avoided the customary handshake. According to PCB’s statement, match referee Andy Pycroft had specifically instructed Salman to refrain from shaking hands.“The match referee Andy Pycroft had asked captain Salman Ali Agha, at the time of the toss, not to shake hands with his Indian counterpart.The Pakistan team management has lodged a protest, calling the behaviour against the spirit of sports,” the board said.The situation further worsened after the match when Suryakumar, who led India to a dominant seven-wicket win, shook hands only with batting partner Shivam Dube and walked straight off without acknowledging the Pakistani players.Pakistan coach Mike Hesson expressed disappointment at the gesture.“Obviously, we were ready to shake hands at the end of the game. We were disappointed that our opposition didn't do that. We sort of went over there to shake hands and they were already going to the changing room. That was a disappointing way for the match to end. In a match where we were already disappointed with the way we played, we were at least willing to go and shake hands,” Hesson said.In protest, Salman Ali Agha skipped the post-match presentation ceremony, which further fuelled the controversy.India’s captain Suryakumar Yadav, however, stood firm on his stance, dedicating the victory to the Indian armed forces and victims of the Pahalgam terror attack.“Perfect occasion, taking the time out, we stand by the victims and families of the Pahalgam terror attack. We express our solidarity. I want to dedicate the win to all our armed forces who showed a lot of bravery,” Suryakumar said at the presentation.“I feel a few things in life are ahead of sportsmanship. I said at the presentation as well that we stand with all the victims of the Pahalgam terror attack. And we stand with their families too, expressing our solidarity. Also, as I said at the post-match presentation, we dedicate this win to our brave armed forces who took part in Operation Sindoor.”He also confirmed that the decision to avoid handshakes was not his alone.“I think that was our proper reply. Our government and the BCCI were aligned, and together we took a call. We came here only to play cricket,” Suryakumar said.With PCB’s complaint now sitting at the ICC headquarters led by its chair Jay Shah, the matter has triggered fresh diplomatic and sporting tensions between the two rivals, overshadowing what was otherwise a one-sided encounter on the field.",The pakistan cricket board (pcb) has lodged a complaint with the international cricket council (icc) the flashpoint came during the toss at the dubai international cricket stadium when pakistan captain salman ali agha and indian skipper suryakumar yadav avoided the customary handshake.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123898886,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-35366,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Tampa Bay Buccaneers facing more injury concerns beyond Chris Godwin Jr.

Chris Godwin Jr. has been one of Tampa Bay’s most reliable weapons over the years. But his lingering foot issue has fans wondering whether he’ll be on the field under the lights. The Buccaneers are set to face the Houston Texans in a primetime clash, and questions around Godwin Jr. ’s status are dominating the buildup. Let’s break it down.No, Godwin Jr. will not play against the Texans. The Buccaneers ruled him out on Saturday’s final injury report, citing the lingering foot injury that required a second surgery earlier this year to “tighten up hardware,” according to NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport.Godwin Jr. was limited throughout the week, logging DNP and LP practice designations, before being officially ruled out. His timeline for return is now targeting Week 5, but could extend into Week 6 or Week 7 depending on recovery.With Godwin Jr. sidelined, rookie wide receiver Emeka Egbuka will continue to see an increased workload alongside Mike Evans. Egbuka broke out in Week 1 with two touchdowns against the Atlanta Falcons, and expectations are high for him to fill the No. 2 role again in Houston.Here’s everything you need to know for Monday night’s matchup:This will be the seventh all-time meeting between Tampa Bay and Houston.The Texans lead the series 5-1, including a 39-37 win back in Week 9 of 2023. Both teams enter Week 2 with plenty at stake: Tampa Bay looking to stay perfect at 2-0, and Houston trying to avoid a 0-2 start.Godwin Jr. isn’t the only key absence for the Buccaneers. Starting left tackle Tristan Wirfs has also been ruled out with a knee injury, leaving Baker Mayfield without two of his most trusted pieces on offense.Right tackle Luke Goedeke is questionable with a foot injury, meaning Tampa Bay could take the field without both starting tackles. Against a Texans defense led by Will Anderson Jr. and Danielle Hunter, that’s a serious concern.The Texans aren’t at full strength either, with wideouts Christian Kirk and Braxton Berrios ruled out. That leaves Nico Collins as the top option for C.J. Stroud. Both teams will be leaning on depth pieces to carry the load on offense in tonight’s primetime showdown.","Tampa bay buccaneers face houston texans on monday night football.

Which teams might bid for Kirill Kaprizov?

Breaking Down The Minnesota Wild & Kaprizov Standoff | SDP

Other potential landing spots and Minnesota's dilemma

Kirill Kaprizov has taken a place among the league's most dynamic forwards, but his future with the Minnesota Wild appears cloudy. It was reported that the 28-year-old rejected a massive eight-year, $128-million contract extension offer, thus sparking speculation about whether he will stay or if the franchise may ultimately have to pursue the trade route. With only one year on his contract, the Wild must act soon to either keep their star or secure value before free agency.While it may still be early, insiders are behind the scenes linking Kirill Kaprizov to some contenders. Per Michael Russo, the New York Rangers and Carolina Hurricanes are expected to get aggressive if he is put on the market, while Chicago would be an attractive personal city for him. Los Angeles and Tampa Bay are also interesting stops from a roster-market size interplay.Kaprizov’s skill set makes him a fit almost anywhere. During the 2024-25 season, he scored 25 goals and 31 assists in just 41 games. Therefore, speed, creativity, and finishing ability are a blend that could turn any team’s offense around. Any organization looking to make a leap into Stanley Cup contention is presented with a one-off opportunity to add a tried and tested game-changer who is in his prime.Besides the five so-called headline teams that made headlines back in the day, some other franchises could attempt to step inside the little ring as well.New York Islanders could fit well, given their need for offensive firepower; meanwhile, Washington Capitals and San Jose Sharks could emerge perhaps as dark horses should their rebuild continue trending upward. But Kaprizov essentially wants a pretty big market, a chance to win, and a money offer worthy of him as an elite winger.The Wild, on the other hand, sees this as a tricky situation. Allowing their franchise cornerstone to walk away for nothing would be the stuff of nightmares, but trading him in the near term could very well alter the identity of the team. If a deal is not struck soon, Minnesota will possibly have to entertain offers for one of the brightest stars in the NHL.Also Read: Blue Jackets go after Ivan Fedotov in a major move to upgrade goaltending The future of Kirill Kaprizov is shaping up to be one of the biggest storylines of the league.
