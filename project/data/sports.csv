Wayne Gretzky's legacy faces a new debate after Frank Nazar’s mega deal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/wayne-gretzkys-legacy-faces-a-new-debate-after-frank-nazars-mega-deal/articleshow/123474763.cms,"Wayne Gretzky (Image Via Twitter)

Frank Nazar’s record-breaking contract sparks outrage among fans

Why Wayne Gretzky remains untouchable

Wayne Gretzky all time leader in goals, points

Whenever hockey greatness begins to be discussed, no one ever forgets to mention the name Wayne Gretzky. He broke all records with breathtaking achievements, unmatched dominance, and the crowning title of ""The Great One. "" However, a completely unforeseen turn of events has recently rocked the tough world of hockey: Young Chicago Blackhawks forward Frank Nazar has signed a massive new deal that could very well see him being paid more per game than what Gretzky ever did in his whole lifetime. The comparison turned into a heated debate from fans complaining about fairness, context, and legacy.At 21 years of age, Frank Nazar is the epitome of hockey's modern financial reality. His $46.13 million contract breaks down to an average of $6.59 million per season and a nearly $80,000 paycheck per game, should he play in all 82 games for the full season.Wayne Gretzky took home roughly $46 million in 20 seasons of professional hockey; however, endorsement money could have pushed this figure close to $76 million. Understandably, the comparison between a rising star's per-game salary and what the greatest athlete ever earned has ignited much fury, with many fans labeling it disrespectful towards Gretzky's legacy.Critics often say hockey was just a smaller financial affair back in the days of Gretzky. The NHL revenue then, in the late 1980s and early 1990s, went around $400-$700 million per year, against today's $6.2 billion revenue. By percentage of league revenue, many modern players actually never came close to Gretzky's earnings.Beyond money, you have to look at what he did: four Stanley Cups, nine Hart Trophies, and an astounding 2,857 career points. Also, his being traded to the Los Angeles Kings grew hockey in the U.S., setting up for the billion-dollar business that it is today.Also Read: Kitchener Rangers welcome talented defenseman Alex Forrest Frank Nazar's paycheck would no doubt raise eyebrows, but it simply points to how big the NHL has gotten since Gretzky's day. Salaries have inflated; sponsorships have exploded; media deals have gone through the roof-and all sorts of young stars are grabbing onto these new opportunities. Yet nothing can change what Wayne Gretzky has accomplished. The Great One didn't just rule the game on ice- he himself raised it as well. There may be many online debates spawned by a rising forward's contract comparison to that of The Great One, but the answer is truthfully evident in history: Gretzky will forever be untouchable.","Young chicago blackhawks forward frank nazar has signed a massive new deal that could very well see him being paid more per game than what wayne gretzky ever did in his whole lifetime.

Serena Williams reveals weight loss journey with GLP-1 medication on Today show

“I literally tried everything. Running, walking, biking, stair-climber, you name it, I did it … Even now trying to play a professional sport, … I felt like, ‘OK, I don’t want to do this because it is a shortcut…’ But it actually isn’t.”

Serena Williams pushes back against stigma of weight loss drugs before US Open

“If you’re on GLP-1s too, don’t let anybody tell you it’s the ‘easy way out.’ You’re not taking a shortcut, you’re taking care of yourself.”

“I feel light physically and light mentally … I can just do more. I’m more active. My joints don’t hurt as much.”

Serena Williams, the retired tennis legend, age 43, says she used a GLP-1 weight-loss medication to lose 31 pounds in eight months. She tried everything, running, biking, stair-climbing, even playing tennis professionally but couldn’t reach a weight she felt was healthy. Now she feels lighter both physically and mentally.On August 21, 2025, on NBC’s Today show, Serena Williams explained why she finally turned to GLP-1 drugs. She said,She realized that after having her daughters, her body needed something more to reach a healthy weight.In interviews with People and others, Serena Williams added that she did lots of research first and consulted a doctor through Ro, the telehealth company she serves as an ambassador for. Around six months after giving birth to her second daughter, Adira, and after she stopped breastfeeding, she began weekly injections.She said the treatment complemented her healthy lifestyle, easing joint pain, boosting energy, and simply helping things work better.Also Read: “Does anyone really care about her?”: Andy Roddick delivers sharp message as Iga Swiatek gets disrespected following Cincinnati Open victory Serena Williams wants people to know using the medication is not a lazy shortcut.

The final stretch of the NFL preseason is here, and Saturday’s packed schedule signals the end of training camp across the league. With Week 1 just around the corner, this weekend marks the last opportunity for players on the edge of the roster to show they belong. Each team must shrink its 90-man training camp roster down to 53 players by next week, forcing tough decisions after Saturday’s games. For players still fighting for a job, this is their last shot to earn a place on the regular-season roster – or at least enough attention to land on a practice squad.While the wins and losses won’t count, Saturday’s games mean everything for the hundreds of players hoping to survive roster cuts. Coaches have spent the last few weeks evaluating talent in camp, but game tape from these final matchups will carry serious weight. Whether it’s a fringe wide receiver fighting for a sixth spot on the depth chart, a backup corner trying to stick on special teams, or a young offensive lineman working for a swing tackle role – these games are where careers are made or broken. As the saying goes, first impressions matter – but in the NFL , the final one might matter even more.Several teams still have questions to answer at quarterback, and a few rookies are making a late push in ongoing camp battles. In Cleveland, the Browns continue to evaluate both Dillon Gabriel and Shedeur Sanders as their quarterback carousel keeps spinning. The preseason finale against the Los Angeles Rams could provide clarity – or make the decision even tougher. Meanwhile, New York Giants rookie Jaxson Dart will try to make his final case. He’s aiming to show enough promise to earn a spot on the roster and potentially develop into a factor in 2025. With limited reps available and pressure mounting, Dart’s performance Saturday could be critical for his future.It’s a busy weekend in the NFL, with 10 preseason games scheduled for Saturday alone. For fans, it’s a full day of football. For players on the roster bubble, it’s the final chapter of a long summer.

Shannon Sharpe rebuilding while ESPN reshapes its roster



Stephen A. Smith has broken his silence on where things stand with Shannon Sharpe following his firing from ESPN earlier this summer. Speaking on The Dan Le Batard Show, Smith stressed that his relationship with Sharpe remains strong, even if network executives decided otherwise.Stephen A. Smith reaffirmed his bond with Shannon Sharpe despite ESPN’s firing and a sexual assault case, praising Sharpe’s First Take impact while ESPN refreshes its lineup ahead of fall.“My relationship with Shannon Sharpe is a pretty damn good one. I got a lot of love for him,” Smith said. “He did a great, great job for First Take. Anything that I needed him to do, he has always been there for me. It’s unfortunate what happened with his situation. And certain decisions that were made were way above my pay grade.”Sharpe’s ESPN departure came after he was named in an April sexual assault lawsuit filed by a woman with whom he had been involved. The suit caught ESPN by surprise—Sharpe still appeared on First Take that same day—but the fallout escalated quickly. He soon announced a leave of absence, and by July, ESPN formalized his exit. The lawsuit was ultimately settled with a payout, but the reputational damage has lingered.The case has left Sharpe’s future uncertain. Despite boasting over 1.8 million subscribers on YouTube, he has not landed another major television role or a high-profile podcast deal. His digital presence continues to grow, but the absence of a mainstream media platform underscores the impact of the allegations.ESPN, meanwhile, is pivoting. The network has added former NFL quarterback Chase Daniel as a commentator and signed college football analyst Josh Pate, moves designed to strengthen its coverage ahead of the 2025 season.Also Read: Gisele Bündchen sparks buzz as Tom Brady’s son bonds with her new baby daddy Joaquim Valente For Smith, the message is one of loyalty.

The Dallas Mavericks shocked the NBA world last season by trading Luka Doncic to the Los Angeles Lakers for Anthony Davis . The move drew heavy criticism and split opinions among fans. Then, injuries struck hard, leaving the Mavericks outside the playoffs. Now, with a fresh season about to begin, ESPN’s Stephen A. Smith has made a bold claim about Dallas, and his words have already started a new debate across the league.On Friday, August 22, Stephen A. Smith gave his take on ESPN’s First Take. He spoke about the future of the Dallas Mavericks and their new lineup. He said very clearly that the team’s championship hopes depend on two players - Anthony Davis and Kyrie Irving.“If Anthony Davis, if Kyrie Irving is healthy and [Anthony Davis] brings his A game, the Dallas Mavericks will win the NBA championship. That’s a big if. It’s legit and everybody knows it,” Smith said on the show.The Mavericks struggled after Davis joined in October 2024. In his very first game for Dallas, Davis injured his left adductor. He missed 18 games in a row. Irving’s bad luck came later in the season. On March 3, he tore his ACL and was ruled out.Without their two stars, Dallas missed the playoffs.Fans were disappointed, but Smith reminded everyone that the story is not over. Davis is expected to be ready for training camp in October 2025, while Irving continues to rehab his knee. If both are fit, Smith believes Dallas could become one of the most dangerous teams in the league.Stephen A. Smith shared his list of the top five players to watch this season on First Take on August 22 as well. Right on that list, he placed Anthony Davis, Kyrie Irving, Luka Doncic, Kevin Durant, and Jimmy Butler.Leading into the 2025–26 NBA season, every one of these names has a main plotline. With his improved level of fitness, Doncic has amazed supporters and now leads Slovenia in the 2025 EuroBasket. Joining the Houston Rockets this summer surprised the league with Durant. Butler was seen working out in Miami and even played some tennis to keep in shape. Concentrating on his rehabilitation, Irving is trying to get ready by the beginning of the season.Smith summed up his opinion by stressing availability. “It’s all about availability. If Anthony Davis and Kyrie Irving are on the court together, nobody wants to face the Mavericks,” he said.The Mavericks begin their preseason in early October 2025. All eyes will be on Davis and Irving to see if they can finally deliver what Dallas traded for a championship run.","The dallas mavericks shocked the nba world last season by trading luka doncic to the los angeles lakers for anthony davis.

“I’ve never looked at Klay Thompson as a role player” — Patrick Beverley explains why Paul George fits the Golden State Warriors better,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/ive-never-looked-at-klay-thompson-as-a-role-player-patrick-beverley-explains-why-paul-george-fits-the-golden-state-warriors-better/articleshow/123477061.cms,"Klay Thompson of the Dallas Mavericks shoots the ball before the game against the Memphis Grizzlies (Image via Getty Images)

Golden State Warriors might have won more games with Paul George in Klay Thompson

Klay Thompson praised for his defense and dirty work

Patrick Beverley has sparked one of the hottest ""what if"" discussions in NBA history again. During his podcast, he suggested that swapping Klay Thompson for Paul George might have led the Golden State Warriors to snag even more championships. While Beverley highlighted George’s adaptability, he also made sure to acknowledge Thompson’s contributions, referring to him as a defensive cornerstone and one of the most accurate shooters in the game’s history.On the most recent episode of his podcast, the Pat Bev Pod, Beverley was encouraged by his co-host to draw comparisons between Thompson and George. This conversation emerged from a broader discussion about whose career is more enviable, Thompson's championship success or George's personal accolades.Beverley didn't hold back in distinguishing between the two, stressing how George's abilities might have pushed the Warriors even further. Speaking right to his co-host, Beverley clarified, “If you put Paul George in the Klay Thompson role, playing with Steph, Draymond Green, [Andre] Iguodala, and (Kevin Durant)… We know Paul George was in the MVP race a couple of years ago.” He continued, “If you substitute those two, I think Golden State probably wins more championships.They probably win more games.”Beverley's point was pretty straightforward: Paul George's dual-threat capability could have given the Warriors added flexibility and scoring power, particularly in situations where key players were missing. As a nine-time All-Star, George has consistently been lauded for his shot creation, high-level defense, and all-around contributions.Even though he praised George, Beverley was quick to stand up for Thompson when his co-host called him a ""role player."" This part of the chat really showed Beverley's respect for Thompson's contributions, pushing back against any idea that his impact was less significant.“I’ve never looked at Klay Thompson as a role player,” Beverley asserted. He elaborated on the distinction: “I think the confusion with role players and what people compare… role players are guys who don’t score a lot, who do the dirty work. I think Klay does the dirty work, and he guarded the second-best player, if it were a wing. Obviously, they’re going to put Draymond on the big.”Beverley pointed out Thompson's exceptional scoring talent, mentioning that genuine role players don't rack up 50 points or sink 10 threes in one game—achievements Thompson has pulled off on multiple occasions. “In my mind, he does the small things when it comes to defending, but scoring 50 and hitting 10 threes isn’t what role players do. Role players are supposed to come in and give you eight to 12 points, take charges, and be a lightning rod,” he said.Wrapping up his defense, Beverley paid homage to Thompson's artistry: “Klay Thompson would light you up. I’ve never seen a prettier shot in my entire life. As a hooper, you look at Klay and it’s just so pretty. You can watch him shoot all day.”Also Read: “Make sure you wear con**m out there” — Jokic sends unforgettable message to Michael Porter Jr Legends like Klay Thompson and stars like Paul George will always spark debates, but that’s the beauty of the game, there’s no single way to define greatness.","Patrick beverley suggested that swapping klay thompson for paul george might have led the golden state warriors to win more championships.

Micah Parsons, the star pass rusher for the Dallas Cowboys, is in a serious fight over his new contract. On August 23, 2025 (today), former NFL general manager Doug Whaley, now in the UFL, said he doesn’t think the fight will end with Parsons being traded. While Parsons and the Cowboys argue about money, Whaley believes a big deal will bring them back together.Doug Whaley, who led the Buffalo Bills from 2013 to 2017, told TMZ Sports that even though things look messy right now, he can’t see owner Jerry Jones sending Parsons away.Whaley reminded us of other scary talks in the past like when the Browns talked with Myles Garrett or the Steelers with T.J. Watt, but in both cases, deals were made and the players stayed.Whaley said:That means, both sides spoke about serious money.He also pointed out that Jones claimed he already offered a deal that would make Parsons the most-paid player in the NFL outside of quarterbacks.On August 1, 2025, Micah Parsons sent in a trade request. He said he wanted a long-term deal after the 2023 season, but the Cowboys didn’t talk with his agent for a long time.Parsons said he felt ignored and hurt by the team.Now 26, and a four-time Pro Bowler with over 52 sacks in four seasons, Parsons said he no longer wants to be part of the team he grew up loving.The Cowboys, of course, say the talk of a trade is nonsense.

Mitchell Tinsley’s case for Joe Burrow and the Bengals’ WR duo



Why analysts say Cincinnati is risking Joe Burrow’s prime



TMZ Sports caught Cincinnati Bengals wideout Mitchell Tinsley ahead of Saturday’s preseason finale against the Indianapolis Colts. The preseason riser did not hesitate when asked about Joe Burrow ’s place among quarterbacks, and his words turned heads. As final roster cuts approach Tuesday at 1 p.m. PT (4 p.m. ET), Tinsley’s comments frame both his own rise and a bigger question around how Cincinnati is building around its franchise QB.As per TMZ Sports, Tinsley praised Burrow without qualification. “He’s the best quarterback in the league and I get to practice and play with him in games,” Tinsley said. “It’s really awesome to build chemistry with him on and off the field. He’s one of those guys, he’s so smart, so intelligent. It’s awesome being out there with him.”Tinsley also pointed to the standard set by Ja’Marr Chase and Tee Higgins, and how that accelerates his development. “It’s a lot of fun. To go out there and [go] ‘Okay, how did [Ja’Marr] run that route or how did Tee run that route.’ Add things to your tool bank. At the end of the day, it’s all about getting better. Iron sharpens iron.”The wide receiver is pushing to make the 53-man roster with the league’s cut deadline on Tuesday.He said he is focused on what comes next, not last week’s breakout, and kept the lens on improvement, as per TMZ Sports.A separate debate continues around Cincinnati’s roster construction and defensive trajectory. Former safety Ryan Clark argued that some roster strain traces back to Burrow’s influence on keeping elite weapons together, which concentrated spending at wide receiver while making defensive upgrades harder, as per Ryan Clark. The logic: paying Tee Higgins at a near–WR1 level and preparing for Ja’Marr Chase’s top-of-market value compresses flexibility elsewhere.Stephen A. Smith took a different tack, placing the responsibility on the franchise, not Burrow. Smith’s view is that Cincinnati has not supplied even an average defense often enough, and that Burrow does not need a Chiefs-level unit to contend, as per Stephen A. Smith.Contract dynamics add friction. The Trey Hendrickson situation remains a flashpoint over guarantees and structure going forward. On “The Dan Patrick Show,” former lineman Mark Schlereth criticized the broader philosophy. “Listen, Trey Hendrickson is a phenomenal football player. Love watching him play. But in Cincinnati, the one thing they want to do is they want to sit back in shotgun and throw the football… their offensive coordinator came out this offseason and said, ‘Hey, we just got to outscore people. ’ And I thought to myself, how’d that work for you last year? It’s the dumbest thing I’ve ever heard,” Schlereth said, as per “The Dan Patrick Show.”He connected that approach back to Burrow’s workload. “They’re wasting Joe Burrow because they basically make him play the entirety of four quarters on a high dive… it’s all on Joe Burrow 24/7 in Cincinnati. So whether they sign Hendrickson or not, that’s not going to change the philosophy of how they play.”The takeaway across those viewpoints: if resources and philosophy tilt too far toward outscoring opponents, even strong edge play or splash additions may not change outcomes. The onus is on Cincinnati to balance its passing-game identity with a defense that can hold the line when Burrow and the offense inevitably hit stretches where drives stall.",Cincinnati bengals wideout mitchell tinsley praised quarterback joe burrow without qualification.

Sidney Crosby inspires Canadian hockey team next generation



Canadian hockey future shaped by Crosby’s mentorship



As the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milan-Cortina is getting closer, Canadian hockey once again looks to its most reliable leader, Sidney Crosby. The Pittsburgh Penguins captain, celebrated for his game-winning goals and unmatched leadership, isn’t just gearing up for another shot at Olympic gold. He’s embracing a bigger responsibility: guiding Canada’s next generation of hockey stars, including phenom Connor Bedard, to carry forward the nation’s legacy on ice.Sidney Crosby has been more than just a player in the red and white jersey—he’s been the face of Canadian hockey for nearly two decades. From the golden goal in Vancouver 2010 to his steady presence in Sochi 2014, his contributions stretch far beyond scoring. What sets Crosby apart is his rare ability to connect with teammates of all ages. Veterans respect his consistency, while young players gravitate toward his mentorship.Speaking on the new wave of Canadian stars, Sidney Crosby offered humility and encouragement. “These guys are so ready now when they come in at such a young age, so they probably don’t need to hear much, but I’m here if they need it,” he said. For Bedard and others making their Olympic dreams a reality, having Crosby around means more than tactical guidance—it’s about learning the values of patience, composure, and leadership.The three-time Stanley Cup champion reflected on his own journey, saying, “I had guys who were really important in helping me adjust and, hopefully, accelerate my progress as best as possible. That’s part of playing a team sport. It’s a great thing about the game. Hopefully I can do the same.” His words reveal the cycle of mentorship that keeps Canadian hockey thriving across generations.The younger generation has already started voicing its gratitude. At the recent 4 Nations Face-Off tournament, Nathan MacKinnon credited Crosby as a steady influence in his career, noting, “He helped me a ton.” This acknowledgment highlights Crosby’s impact not only as a world-class athlete but as a cultural cornerstone in hockey.With Milan-Cortina 2026 approaching, Crosby’s presence guarantees that Canada won’t just compete for medals—it will continue shaping champions for decades to come. And, he will be watching the next gen.Meanwhile, contract talks between Connor Bedard and the Blackhawks aren’t urgent yet, though both sides aim for a long-term extension. With cap space available, the focus is on structuring the perfect eight-year deal, not rushing negotiations before Bedard’s third season.Also Read: Former Maple Leafs star reacts boldly to shocking trade rumors involving two of Auston Matthews’ teammates","Sidney crosby has been the face of canadian hockey for nearly two decades.

Ronaldo himself went close with an overhead attempt, while Wesley and Felix also tested goalkeeper Edouard Mendy. Their persistence paid off late in the first half when Ronaldo converted from the spot after Ali Majrashi was penalised for handball.But parity was quickly restored as Franck Kessie struck a precise effort from the edge of the box. The contest swung again in the second half when Marcelo Brozovic punished a mistake from Kessie to fire Al-Nassr 2-1 ahead with just minutes remaining.However, Roger Ibanez’s late header ensured the match went to penalties.In the shootout, Ronaldo converted his kick with laser-like precision, but was let down by the missed attempts of his co-stars.

It left Ronaldo and his teammates reflecting on another missed opportunity.The 40-year-old forward did reach a personal landmark, scoring his 100th goal for Al-Nassr. In doing so, he became the first player in history to net 100 or more goals for five different teams – Manchester United, Real Madrid, Juventus, Al-Nassr and Portugal.For Ronaldo, the milestone offered little comfort.

These snapshots were not from their NFL careers but from their time playing college football–when Mahomes played for the Texas Tech Red Raiders, Worthy for the Texas Longhorns, and Bolton for the Missouri Tigers! The Chiefs captioned it: ""College football starts today😤.""The first snapshot shared by the Chiefs featured Patrick Mahomes in a half-body shot. The three-time Super Bowl champion was decked out in his Texas Tech uniform (black, red, and white). His jersey number was “5”, different from the “15” he wears now. Mahomes wore a helmet and intensely looked at someone or something. Grass stains on his uniform spoke volumes about his extravagant performance!The Kansas City Chiefs’ second shared snapshot featured no-longer-a-rookie, Xavier Worthy! Yes, the same player, Travis Kelce’s girlfriend, Taylor Swift, was notably happy for! The picture, from Worthy’s college football days, captured him just before making a catch, his hands ready and eyes beaming with anticipation and pride.The third snapshot from the Chiefs’ X post captured Nick Bolton in a breathtaking pose–brilliance of the photographer (AP/L.G. Patterson). Bolton had just tackled Kentucky’s quarterback Terry Wilson.
