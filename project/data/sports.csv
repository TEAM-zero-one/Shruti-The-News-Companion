Derrick Henry Ready to win in Baltimore w/ Lamar, NFL legacy, Alabama’s best & RB future |The Pivot

I knew once free agency started that I wanted to work something out [with the Ravens] if we could,

Even though I’m living in Dallas and Dallas being a perfect situation, as well, because we lived there, we ain’t got to move…”

“They ain’t holla at me at all,”

Dallas could have been a perfect fit, but now Henry is locked in with the Ravens

Baltimore Ravens ’ star running back Derrick Henry has officially sold his Dallas home, but it’s not just a routine real estate transaction—it’s a symbolic farewell to a long-standing dream. Henry, who was once rumored to be eyeing a future with the Dallas Cowboys , sold the property for $1.6 million, falling short of its original asking price. This move marks the final chapter in his connection to Dallas, a city he once hoped to call his permanent NFL home.Henry originally bought the luxurious 4,154-square-foot home in Inwood Park in 2022. Featuring 20-foot ceilings, floor-to-ceiling windows, marble floors, and hardwood flooring, the property was a high-end investment. The stunning residence offers four bedrooms, four bathrooms, and a spacious three-car garage. Designed for both comfort and style, it boasts a gourmet kitchen, a cozy fireplace, custom walk-in closets, and a lush turf backyard perfect for outdoor relaxation.He first listed it for $1.8 million in 2023 but later took it off the market before relisting it at $1.6 million with a different real estate agency.According to TMZ, the final sale amount has not been disclosed, but sources suggest it was close to the lowered asking price. The sale ends Henry’s residential ties to Dallas, a city he had considered home due to his girlfriend, Adrianna Rivas , having family in the area.While Henry’s Dallas residency was partly personal, it was also fueled by his football aspirations. The running back admitted onpodcast that he had wanted to play for the Cowboys.” Henry said. “Unfortunately for Henry, the Cowboys never approached him.he revealed, making it clear that the interest was one-sided.Many Cowboys fans were thrilled by the idea of Derrick Henry joining the team and teaming up with Dak Prescott. With his powerful running style and Dallas’ solid offensive line, Henry could have brought a whole new level of strength to the offense. His ability to break tackles and wear down defenses seemed like the perfect fit for a team looking to boost its rushing attack. But despite all the excitement and speculation, the Cowboys stuck to their usual cautious approach to building the roster. Instead of making a big move for Henry, they decided to stay the course—meaning the star running back never got the call.Now, he’s set to be a major difference-maker for the Ravens, strengthening their already powerful running game alongside his new teammates. With his size, speed, and experience, he adds another level of dominance to Baltimore’s offense, making them an even bigger threat. Meanwhile, Cowboys fans may be left wondering what could have been, regretting the missed chance to have him in their backfield. But for Ravens fans, this move is cause for celebration. Henry isn’t just switching teams—he’s fully embracing Baltimore’s Super Bowl dreams, bringing his unstoppable energy and determination to help them compete at the highest level.Also read - Cam Heyward says he ""Stole"" DK Metcalf from the Chargers, did he cross the line?","Derrick henry sold his dallas home for $1.6 million, falling short of its original asking price.

Anthony Edwards received a hard elbow from Kevin Durant



The Minnesota Timberwolves faced a moment of uncertainty on Friday night when star guard Anthony Edwards went down after a collision with Phoenix Suns forward Kevin Durant . Edwards had to be escorted to the locker room after taking a hit to the face during the first quarter. The Ant-Man returned to the court, but the hard blow on his nose was a serious concern for the Timberwolves and their fans at the moment.When 2:43 was left in the first quarter, Anthony Edwards attempted to intercept a pass intended for Kevin Durant, but in the process, Durant’s arm caught him across the nose. The impact sent Edwards to the ground in visible pain, where he remained for a minute before walking off with assistance. The incident initially sparked concerns about a possible serious injury, as Edwards had a towel covering his face while heading to the locker room.Dane Moore of Blue Wire described the incident, stating, “Anthony Edwards headed to the locker room with a towel over his face after a collision with Kevin Durant. Looked like he maybe got poked in the eye or something.” Similarly, Duane Rankin of azcentral reported, “Anthony Edwards went down as he and Kevin Durant were going for the ball.”Edwards’ absence in the second quarter raised alarms for Timberwolves fans, considering his exceptional season, where he has averaged 27.3 points, 5.7 rebounds, and 4.6 assists per game on 44.1% shooting. With Minnesota sitting in eighth place and just a half-game behind the Los Angeles Clippers for the final guaranteed playoff spot, every game is crucial.Despite the injury scare, Edwards returned in the second half and finished the game with 20 points, helping the Timberwolves secure a 124-109 victory over the Suns. The win marked a four-game season sweep for Minnesota over Phoenix and extended their winning streak against the Suns to seven games. Edwards is currently averaging 23.7 points per game.Also Read: Stephen Curry returns to lead Golden State Warriors to victory over New Orleans Pelican Julius Randle led the Timberwolves with 25 points, while Collin Gillespie stepped up with a career-high 22 points and nine assists.

Team gives priority to cap space ahead of contract extensions



Mitch Marner's contract situation hangs over



John Tavares and Steven Lorentz in wait-and-see mode



A make-or-break offseason for Toronto



As the NHL summer gets near, the Toronto Maple Leafs are adopting a guarded stance on their roster choices. Based on NHL insider Nick Kypreos , the franchise's first concern is Mitch Marner's future ahead of signing contract extensions on other players, such as John Tavares and Steven Lorentz. Toronto Maple Leafs general manager Brad Treliving is also known to be a Marner enthusiast.The Maple Leafs are said to be waiting on contract negotiations with their upcoming unrestricted free agents until they decide if Marner will remain or if they will have to spend cap room to replace him. “It sounds like pending unrestricted free agents John Tavares and Steven Lorentz will have to wait until the offseason for any contract offers from the Leafs if they are to stay. The Leafs’ top priority remains leaving enough cap space to either re-sign Mitch Marner or bring in one or two players as suitable replacements.” Kypreos said in the Toronto Star.Marner, 27, is set to reach the expiration of his six-year, $65.4 million contract soon, and he continues to perform well on the ice. He has 89 points in 71 games and is still an integral offensive player for the Maple Leafs. Yet if he reaches free agency on July 1, he likely will demand a hefty salary bump, maybe into the $13-14 million per-year area.Despite previous trade speculation, Toronto Maple Leafs general manager Brad Treliving has remained a strong supporter of Marner. The marquee winger wouldn't waive his no-trade clause at the trade deadline, making him the boss of the situation. The Leafs now have to determine if they can keep him or if they will have to look elsewhere.Vet Center John Tavares is also in his seventh and last year of a $77 million, seven-year contract. He has been contributing with 33 goals and 67 points through 65 contests. The Maple Leafs are not hurrying, though, to sign him longer term, holding off to examine how the Marner situation will develop before they commit long-term.Although Tavares is still an asset, Kypreos said his Toronto future will hinge on whether or not the club can generate the cap space necessary.In the meantime, forward Steven Lorentz is going through a one-year, $775,000 deal and has tallied six goals and 16 points in 69 contests. Similar to Tavares, he sits in limbo as the Leafs determine their roster requirements.The Maple Leafs' offseason plan will heavily depend on Marner's choice. If he re-signs, Toronto will have to manage its remaining cap space very carefully to complete the roster. If he departs, the team will have the cap space to go after other high-impact free agents.Also read: Toronto Maple Leafs sign NCAA standout Luke Haymes to two-year contract With free agency only months off, everyone's eyes will be on the Maple Leafs as they make their way through one of the most important off-seasons in recent history.",The toronto maple leafs are said to be waiting on contract negotiations with their upcoming unrestricted free agents.

Where did Jayson Tatum’s nickname come from?



Boston Celtics star Jayson Tatum ’s reaction to a particular nickname has sparked plenty of discussion among fans and media alike.

He responded with a candid answer that sent the Kelce brothers into fits of laughter. “Twitter is not a real place, I’ll say that,” Tatum hared. His reaction made it clear that he wasn’t exactly embracing the nickname, despite its growing popularity.Jason Kelce, however, had a different take. “I would run with that one. I like it. ‘The Anomaly’ is a good one. I don’t know who came up with that.” To which Travis Kelce agreed, saying, “It is a banger.”The origins of ‘The Anomaly’ trace back to social media, where an X user first suggested it, pointing out Tatum’s unique skill set. “Handles like someone 6 inches shorter, shoots pull-ups like a guard, finishes at the rim like a center, and consistently defends 1-5.”The nickname got wide attention, and soon, even official team accounts like the Portland Trail Blazers started using it in their game promotions. Basketball Reference has even added it to Tatum’s list of nicknames.Previously, when asked directly if he liked the name, he hesitated before admitting, “Ahhh, I don’t know.” He went on to mention that friends and teammates call him by other names, such as ‘Big Deuce’ and ‘Taco.’Also Read: Jayson Tatum's injury report (March 26, 2025): Is the Boston Celtics star fit to play against the Phoenix Suns tonight? Regardless of whether ‘The Anomaly’ nickname sticks, there’s no denying that Tatum’s game lives up to the title. At 6’10”, his mobility, ball-handling, and scoring ability make him one of the most versatile players in the NBA. He has been a standout star for the Celtics and is arguably one of the most complete players in the league today.","Boston celtics star jayson tatum was a guest on the new heights podcast.

IPL 2025: How will KKR, MI, CSK, SRH, RCB fare this season?

After being outclassed in their previous matches, title holders Kolkata Knight Riders and Rajasthan Royals are looking for a quick turnaround when they meet in an IPL match today (March 26).The Knight Riders lost to Royal Challengers Bengaluru by seven wickets in their opener, while the Royals suffered a 44-run defeat against Sunrisers Hyderabad.Both teams share a common issue: their once-impressive batting and bowling units have failed to perform. While the Royals might attribute their bowling struggles to playing at a difficult Hyderabad venue, the Knight Riders lack such an excuse.Except for Sunil Narine, none of the KKR bowlers managed to restrain the aggressive RCB lineup, raising concerns about the effectiveness of mystery spinner Varun Chakravarthy, who struggled significantly. Even on Eden Gardens' pitch, which had some grip, Chakravarthy was hit hard by Phil Salt and Virat Kohli.The KKR camp is hopeful that Chakravarthy will regain his form on a Guwahati pitch that typically offers more assistance to bowlers.The Barsapara Cricket Stadium in Guwahati has hosted four matches in IPL history - two in 2023 and two in 2024. The highest total at this ground came courtesy Rajasthan Royals who scored 199 against Delhi Capitals. The RR vs KKR fixture was washed out last year at this venue.Yashasvi Jaiswal, Sanju Samson, Riyan Parag(c), Nitish Rana, Dhruv Jurel(wk), Shimron Hetmyer, Shubham Dubey, Jofra Archer, Wanindu Hasaranga, Maheesh Theekshana, Tushar Deshpande, Sandeep Sharma, Akash Madhwal.Yudhvir Charak/Kunal Singh Rathore.Quinton de Kock (w), Sunil Narine, Ajinkya Rahane (c), Venkatesh Iyer, Angkrish Raghuvanshi, Rinku Singh, Andre Russell, Ramandeep Singh, Harshit Rana, Spencer Johnson, Varun Chakaravarthy.Vaibhav Arora/Manish Pandey.Sanju Samson (c), Yashasvi Jaiswal, Riyan Parag, Dhruv Jurel, Jofra Archer, Shimron Hetmyer, Tushar Deshpande, Wanindu Hasaranga, Maheesh Theekshana, Nitish Rana, Sandeep Sharma, Fazalhaq Farooqi, Kwena Maphaka, Akash Madhwal, Vaibhav Suryavanshi, Shubham Dubey, Yudhvir Singh, Kunal Singh Rathore, Ashok Sharma, Kumar KartikeyaRinku Singh, Varun Chakaravarthy, Sunil Narine, Andre Russell, Harshit Rana, Ramandeep Singh, Venkatesh Iyer, Quinton de Kock, Rahmanullah Gurbaz, Anrich Nortje, Angkrish Raghuvanshi, Vaibhav Arora, Mayank Markande, Rovman Powell, Manish Pandey, Spencer Johnson, Luvnith Sisodia, Ajinkya Rahane (c), Anukul Roy, Moeen Ali, Chetan SakariyaAs the RR vs KKR head-to-head record reads, the two teams have played each other 30 times in the IPL, with the Royals and the Knight Riders winning 14 each.

RCB posted a competitive 196/7, with Rajat Patidar leading the charge with a fortuitous 51 runs off 32 balls, supported by Tim David’s late blitz (22* off 8 balls).Despite early fireworks from Phil Salt (32 off 16 balls) and Devdutt Padikkal (27 off 14 balls), RCB struggled in the middle overs, but Patidar’s knock and David’s late hitting propelled them to a solid total.CSK’s chase never gained momentum as they crumbled to 146/8, with key wickets falling early. Josh Hazlewood was the standout performer with the ball, claiming 3/21, including the vital scalps of Rahul Tripathi and Ruturaj Gaikwad, reducing CSK to 8/3 within the first two overs.Bhuvneshwar Kumar (1/20) also contributed, dismissing Deepak Hooda.Though Rachin Ravindra (41 off 31 balls) and Sam Curran (8) tried to stabilize, the required run rate surged, and wickets fell at regular intervals. Curran was dismissed by Liam Livingstone, and Ravindra was bowled out by Yash Dayal (2/18), who also removed Shivam Dube (19).CSK’s decision to send Ravichandran Ashwin instead of MS Dhoni at this stage signaled their lack of fight. Dhoni’s 30* off 16 balls, including 2 sixes, was a mere consolation.RCB’s bowlers, including Livingstone and Dayal, tightened the screws, and an outstanding performance from Impact Sub Suyash Sharma (4-0-32-0) kept CSK under control.Patidar’s fortunate fifty and Hazlewood's destructive spell were key to RCB’s historic win, marking a rare defeat for CSK at home and a memorable victory for RCB.","Royal challengers bengaluru (rcb) ended a 17-year winless streak at chepauk with a dominant 50-run victory over chennai super kings (csk) in friday's ipl match.

The much-anticipated return of Hardik Pandya from a one-match ban is expected to inject much-needed balance into the Mumbai Indians ' lineup as they face an equally determined Gujarat Titans on Saturday. Both teams are searching for their first victory of the IPL season after disappointing opening matches.Mumbai Indians' perennial opening-game jinx continued with a four-wicket loss to Chennai Super Kings, while Gujarat Titans suffered an 11-run defeat at the hands of Punjab Kings in a high-scoring thriller.The week-long break between games allowed Mumbai Indians to regroup and engage in team bonding activities at Reliance's Jamnagar facility. However, the absence of Jasprit Bumrah and Hardik Pandya in the opener exposed vulnerabilities in their bowling and lower-order batting.Gujarat Titans' bowling attack, heavily reliant on Kagiso Rabada and Rashid Khan, will face a stern test against a potent Mumbai batting lineup. The lack of experienced Indian pacers and Mohammed Siraj’s vulnerability add to their concerns.The batting-friendly conditions at Ahmedabad’s Narendra Modi Stadium, which witnessed a combined total of 475 runs in the opening game, will be a welcome change for Mumbai’s batsmen after the sluggish Chepauk track. The boundaries are 64m and 66m on the sides, and the pitch looks excellent for batting. The grass covering is not expected to be a major factor. A score of 200 has been achieved 10 times in 17 matches at this venue.

Why an icon from Hindi heartland became Chennai’s superhero | #dhoni #ipl I Witness

Gujarat Titans head coach Ashish Nehra displayed visible frustration during Saturday's IPL 2025 match against Mumbai Indians at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad. His reaction came after Gujarat lost five wickets in the final 13 balls, finishing at 196 for eight, though they eventually won by 36 runs.Gujarat's innings started promisingly with opener Sai Sudharsan scoring a powerful 63 runs off 41 balls. The team was well-positioned at 170 for three after 17 overs.Mumbai Indians' effective death-over bowling led to a dramatic collapse for Gujarat. They lost three wickets in just three balls, moving from 179 for four to 179 for six between the 17.5 and 18.2 overs, with Sherfane Rutherford's dismissal by Deepak Chahar particularly triggering Nehra's outburst.This marked Gujarat's second batting collapse in IPL 2025.
