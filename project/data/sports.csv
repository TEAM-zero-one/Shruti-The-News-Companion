NEW DELHI: Bharatiya Janata Party on Saturday welcomed BCCI's decision to instruct Shah Rukh Khan owned Kolkata Knight Riders to release Bangladesh player Mustafizur Rehman from their roster ahead of Indian Premier League.BJP leader Sangeet Som thanked BCCI for its decision and hailed it as a ""victory of the Hindus of the entire nation.""""Thanks to BCCI for its decision in view of the 100 crore Sanatanis of India,"" Som said.""We said yesterday that cognisance will be taken of this matter because the sentiments of 100 crore people cannot be taken lightly.

This will be for his own good and will also protect India's interests,"" Sanjay Nirupam told ANI.Reacting to the controversy, Congress leader Supriya Shrinate said the focus should be on who permitted Bangladeshi players to be included in the IPL auction in the first place.""First of all, I want to ask who put the Bangladeshi players in that pool.

NEW DELHI: Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) on Saturday released Bangladeshi fast bowler Mustafizur Rahman from their IPL 2026 squad following a directive from the Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ).KKR had picked Mustafizur Rahman for Rs 9.20 crore at the IPL auction held in December. However, his selection triggered a political backlash in India after reports emerged of recent mob violence and lynching incidents involving Hindu minorities in Bangladesh.Following the BCCI’s directive, Mustafizur Rahman will not be part of the IPL 2026 season, and the franchise has been permitted to name a replacement player in accordance with league rules.In a media advisory, KKR said, “Kolkata Knight Riders confirms that BCCI/IPL as the regulator of IPL has instructed it to release Mustafizur Rahman from the squad ahead of the upcoming Indian Premier League (IPL) season.” The franchise added that the release was carried out after due process and consultations, and that the BCCI would allow a replacement player as per IPL regulations.The controversy drew reactions from political leaders, with Congress MP Shashi Tharoor coming forward in Mustafizur Rahman’s support, while the BJP strongly opposed his selection and targeted KKR co-owner Shah Rukh Khan , calling him a “traitor.”Congress MP Shashi Tharoor said sports should be separated from political tensions. “Cricket should not be made to bear the burden for attacks on minorities in Bangladesh,” he told reporters, adding that Mustafizur Rahman had no role in the violence.“Mustafizur Rahman is a cricketer and has nothing to do with any of these things. He has not been personally accused of any hate speech or condoning or defending any attacks. Mixing these two things is simply not fair,” Tharoor said.He also cautioned against isolating neighbouring countries. “If we become a country that isolates all of our neighbours, and say nobody is playing with any of them, how does it do any good? It is purely a sporting decision, and we should not let politics come into this,” he added.Congress leader and Karnataka Minister Priyank Kharge criticised the BJP for targeting the IPL franchise, saying overseas players participate in the league as per BCCI and IPL rules.In a post on X, Kharge said, “The BJP and their 'Vichar Parivaar' are outraged over the inclusion of a Bangladeshi player in the IPL. If an overseas player is in IPL, it is because BCCI or the IPL rules allow him. Instead of blaming the franchise, shouldn't the BJP leaders ask why BCCI is allowing Bangladesh players to participate in IPL, when they should be banning it.”He further cited past instances to criticise BJP leaders. “The same BJP leaders have no problem when: India played with Pakistan soon after the Pahalgam attack. IPL shifted matches to Islamic countries during COVID. IPL auctions are held in Islamic countries… For BJP, 'nationalism' appears only when it suits their politics,” Kharge added.Congress MP Tariq Anwar defended KKR co-owner Shah Rukh Khan, calling it inappropriate to target the actor. He said foreign players can only be included after due permission from cricketing authorities and under international norms.Reacting to the controversy, Congress leader Supriya Shrinate said the focus should be on who permitted Bangladeshi players to be included in the IPL auction in the first place.Speaking to ANI, she said, ""First of all, I want to ask who put the Bangladeshi players in that pool. This question is for the BCCI and the ICC. Home Minister's son, Jay Shah, should answer who put the Bangladeshi players in the pool where IPL players are bought and sold, the pool where the players' auction takes place... he is the ICC's chief and the main decision-maker in cricket all around the world.""BJP leader Sangeet Som welcomed the BCCI’s decision and launched a sharp attack on Shah Rukh Khan, calling him a “traitor.” He cited repeated violence against religious minorities in Bangladesh and claimed Mustafizur Rahman would not be allowed to play in the IPL.“Despite all this, traitors like Shah Rukh Khan… invest it in players from a country that is working against India,” Som told ANI, adding that the cricketer would not be able to play in the tournament.Uttar Pradesh Minister Narendra Kashyap also praised the BCCI’s move, saying it respected national sentiment. “We welcome the decision of the BCCI that they understood the sentiments of the nation and removed the Bangladeshi player,” he said.Former India cricketer Madan Lal and World Cup winner supported Shah Rukh Khan, saying the actor had no role in team selection.“This is the decision of the BCCI and the Central government must have taken this decision, given the atrocities are being committed against Hindus in Bangladesh,” he told ANI.He added, “There is no fault of Shah Rukh Khan as they have the team who picks the team.”National President of the All India Muslim Jamaat, Maulana Shahabuddin Razvi Barelvi, said there was no act of betrayal in Shah Rukh Khan selecting a Bangladeshi player.Meanwhile, Imam Umer Ahmed Ilyasi of the All India Imam Organisation said Shah Rukh Khan should apologise to the nation over the selection.Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Nirupam had urged Shah Rukh Khan to remove the Bangladeshi player, saying it would protect India’s interests and prevent the actor from becoming a target.Hindus in Bangladesh have been victims of mob violence and lynching in the aftermath of protests and the killing of student leader Osman Hadi. On December 18, 2025, Dipu Chandra Das was beaten to death by a mob over alleged blasphemy charges in Bangladesh’s Mymensingh district. In another incident, a Hindu youth, Amrit Mondal, was lynched in Rajbari district, triggering protests and strong reactions in India.",Kolkata knight riders (kkr) on saturday released bangladeshi fast bowler mustafizur rahman from their ipl 2026 squad. The decision follows a directive from the board of control for cricket in india ( bcci ).kkr had picked rahman for rs 9.20 crore at the ipl auction held in december.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126323485,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1035993,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

Tyson Kidd’s in-ring success and post-injury WWE role





Natalya Neidhart and Tyson Kidd were born into professional wrestling and WWE universe and have been established since they were 20 years old. Through WWE contracts, television showcases, and decades of steady employment instead of fleeting headlines, both built financial futures. Good record of relevancy, including expanding their combined net worth.Neither is among WWE's top 10 global superstars so far as compensation, at least on the finer points of the evening, but the dollars tell the tale of consistent success for each. Natalya is still appearing regularly, while Tyson Kidd moved into an important backstage position after suffering a career-ending injury. Combined, their earnings have been accumulated with salaries, achievement bonuses, merchandise royalties, and offstage duties not associated with actual wrestling.Natalya Neidhart has had one of the longest, uninterrupted runs in WWE's modern era women's division. Having first debuted on the main roster in the late 2000s, she quickly became a consistent presence on weekly television, premium live events, and overseas excursions. This consistency eventually progressed into an uptick in contract renewals and a small bump in pay every year.ID@undefinedCaption not available.ID@undefinedCaption not available.ID@undefinedCaption not available.The bulk of Natalya's income has traditionally come from a salary she is guaranteed to earn annually, bonuses related to major events, merchandise, and further exposure via WWE-related media.

Her individual net worth has widely been estimated at around $2 million, a figure based on years of reliable earnings, not temporary highs.Tyson Kidd’s real-life identity is TJ Wilson. He started his career working as an in-ring performer, predominantly as a skilled singles male and tag team wrestler.

The contribution of Sidney Crosby in the NHL cannot be overlooked. The 3 time Stanley Cup winner and two-time Olympic gold medalist has made history and won awards during his illustrious career.

Caitlin Clark is a huge Drake Maye fan



Caitlin Clark’s most-awaited recovery and return







With the Super Bowl almost a month away, everyone has their favorites, and so does WNBA’s biggest star, Caitlin Clark. On the recent episode of the “New Heights” podcast hosted by the Kelce brothers, Jason and Travis, the 2024 ROTY winner appeared and sparked a cross-sport debate after naming her favorites for Super Bowl 2026.Though Clark hails from Iowa, she admitted her admiration for the New England Patriots, which is largely influenced by her liking for Patriots star QB Drake Maye. This seemed like a classic case where greatness recognizes and appreciates greatness.The last episode of New Heights for 2025 was anything but not dramatic. In a conversation with Jason and Travis over who is Clark’s favorite to win the next Super Bowl, Caitlin revealed, “I may not be cheering for anybody…but honestly, I am a Drake Maye fan. He’s been incredible.Continuing, she said, “I will probably be pulling for the Patriots, but the Rams are really good too. Sam Darnold seems like a good guy…I could root for him.”Drake Maye and Caitlin Clark began their professional career in 2024 and have been proving to be a cornerstone for their teams. Draye Maye registered a completion rate of 66.6% completing 225-of-338 passes in 2024, over 2,276 yards, and 15 touchdowns.Clark also entered the 2025 season after a historic rookie campaign where she averaged 19.2 points and a league-leading 8.4 assists per game. Though her 2025 season ended early, just after 13 games, due to an injury, the snippets from the USA camp show Clark is healthier and ready to enter the 2026 season with a bang.While the Super Bowl occupies the current headline from who’ll play to who’ll perform at halftime, the Indy fever fans are more concerned with Clark’s physical longevity. Reports suggest her 100% recovery and her focus on strength training to return by the WNBA’s 2026 tip-off.

The New York Rangers couldn't have picked a better time to put together their most complete performance of the season. Mika Zibanejad led the way with a historic night in Friday's Winter Classic, recording five points, including the first hat trick in the event's history, as New York defeated the Florida Panthers 5-1.Zibanejad's five-point performance set an NHL record for outdoor games and sparked a Rangers team that desperately needed something to go right. New York entered the game losers of three straight and missing multiple key players to injury, but found a way to dominate the two-time defending Stanley Cup champions.The sellout crowd of 36,153 at loanDepot park witnessed the Rangers firing on all cylinders. Artemi Panarin added two goals and an assist for a three-point night that gives him seven points in NHL outdoor games, tied for the most all-time. Alexis Lafreniere contributed three assists, matching the outdoor game record.The Rangers talked about treating this game as a fresh start after a difficult stretch. Zibanejad explained that the team spent a couple of days with families and friends before refocusing for game time, and the approach clearly worked.""We talked about it, about a fresh start here,"" Zibanejad said after the game. He expressed hope that the performance could be the beginning of something good for the struggling Rangers.Coach Mike Sullivan praised his team's effort across the board. The power play went 2-for-3 with Panarin scoring his first power-play goal of the season. The penalty kill was excellent at 5-for-6, shutting down Florida's dangerous attack at critical moments. Igor Shesterkin made 36 saves to keep the defending champions at bay.Sullivan noted that having top players show up on the scoresheet puts the team in a better position to win, but emphasized it was more than just offensive production. He thought the Rangers' best players were their very best on both sides of the puck.The challenge now becomes turning one excellent performance into sustained success. The Rangers improved to 20-18-5 but remain just 5-10-3 at home, where they've been shut out six times and outscored 57-34.New York gets its next chance Monday when they host Utah at Madison Square Garden. The team is still missing captain J.T. Miller, who sat out his sixth straight game with an upper-body injury, though he's skating with the team again and nearing a return.Zibanejad acknowledged the team needs to keep building on the foundation laid in Miami. The blocked shots, defensive sacrifice, and timely saves from Shesterkin provided a blueprint for success that needs to become the standard rather than the exception.","New york rangers defeated florida panthers 5-1 in the winter classic.

LeBron James vs Stephen Curry salary breakdown

The net worth battle between LeBron James and Stephen Curry







LeBron James and Stephen Curry are the Mount Rushmore of modern NBA. They just do not dominate the court with their skills and game IQ, but make a significant impact off the court too. It is still wild to imagine how they both were born in the same hospital. Shocked much? As reported by the Beacon Journal in 2015, both James (1984) and Curry (1988) were born at Akron General Medical Center in Ohio, just a few years apart.These two heavyweights just don’t outshine their opponents on the court, but they also command the financial landscape of NBA. From battling for rings to sharing a bond of trust and respect, LeBron James and Stephen Curry have come a long way and so did their bank accounts. One is a certified billionaire business mogul, while the other is currently the highest-paid on-court performer the league has ever seen.If one just looks at the seasonal paycheck, then Stephen Curry is actually winning. For the 2025–26 season, Steph is pulling in a staggering $59.6 million from the Golden State Warriors, making him the highest-paid player in the league, a record that he has held since 2017-18. But LeBron James isn't exactly lagging, despite his Lakers salary for this season sitting at $52.6 million.The difference is Curry’s art of the ""Supermax."" He was the first player to cross the $200 million contract threshold when he signed a 5-year $201 million deal with the Warriors in 2017. And with his recent veteran extension of $62 million for 1-year, Curry’s on his way to becoming the first NBA player to be paid $62 million for a single season in 2026-27. However, while Steph wins the annual salary race, LeBron still leads in total career on-court earnings, having banked over $580 million since he was drafted back in 2003.This is where the comparison gets steep and the difference wide. LeBron James officially hit billionaire status in 2022 and currently sits at a net worth of approximately $1.3 billion. He didn't get there just by playing ball; he built an empire. Between his lifetime Nike deal (rumored to be worth over $1 billion), his production company SpringHill, and stakes in Fenway Sports Group (which owns the Red Sox and Liverpool FC), LeBron is playing a completely different game off the court.Stephen Curry’s current net worth is estimated at $240 million as of late 2025. While that’s a massive fortune, it shows the difference between being a superstar and being a tycoon. Steph’s wealth is climbing fast, though, thanks to his own Curry Brand, which is now independent after breaking with Under Armour and his Unanimous Media production house. At the end of the day, whether you prefer the King’s power or the Chef’s range, both are proving that the modern athlete is just as much a CEO as they are a point guard.Also read: ""“We emptied the cups”: LeBron James and Bronny James get candid on LA Lakers’ Spill The Tea","Lebron james and stephen curry are the mount rushmore of modern nba.

How the game changes without Jokic





when the Denver Nuggets face the Cleveland Cavaliers on January 2, 2026. Denver has ruled out its starting center as he continues to recover from a left knee hyperextension, an injury the team expects will keep him out for at least four weeks.This game was expected to be one of the more notable matchups of the week. Instead, it arrives with Denver missing much of its regular rotation and focused on getting through the night without further issues. The Nuggets are deep into an Eastern Conference road trip and are clearly thinking beyond a single January game.The Denver Nuggets confirmed earlier in the day that Nikola Jokic will not suit up in Cleveland. His absence is part of a planned recovery process, not a late decision or short-term rest.The game tips off at 7:30 p.m. ET at Rocket Arena, which means fans in India will be watching early on January 3. There has been no indication from the team that a return was ever on the table for this matchup.Nikola Jokic suffered a hyperextension of his left knee earlier in the week, with additional concern around a bone bruise. Denver has already outlined a recovery window of more than four weeks, with a re-evaluation expected in about a month.Before the injury, he was averaging 29.6 points, 12.2 rebounds, and 11 assists per game. His absence has already affected Denver’s short-term outlook and could play a role in how the MVP race unfolds this season.Jokic is only one of several Nuggets unavailable tonight. Denver’s injury report is one of the longest it has carried all season, especially in the frontcourt.Jamal Murray is listed with an ankle sprain but is expected to play, which would leave him as the clear focal point of Denver’s offense.Without Jokic, Denver Nuggets loses its main scorer, rebounder, and playmaker. The offense becomes more guard-driven, with fewer easy looks created through the center position.Also read: Denver Nuggets vs Cleveland Cavaliers regular season game: Full injury report, who's out, where to watch, and more (January 2, 2025) Cleveland enters with a healthier lineup and a clear advantage inside.

Though this road game gave fresh wounds to Kings after they faced their 4th straight loss, 102-129, Russell Westbrook reached an individual milestone.Coming into the game, Westbrook trailed Robertson by 16 points. He finished the night with 17 points, bringing his career total to 26,711 points, along with 8 rebounds, and 6 assists while going 6-12 from the field. This milestone is particularly sweet because it cements him as the highest-scoring true point guard to ever play the game.Kings’ head coach, Doug Christie, when asked about Westbrook reaching this milestone, praisingly said, ""I didn’t know he broke another record tonight. (smiles) He continues to break records. Russ is a freak of nature… always been a fan of his. It’s an absolute honor to coach him.”For decades, Robertson’s triple-double records were thought to be untouchable until Westbrook made averaging a triple-double look easy. Along with Oscar Robertson, he has now outscored icons like Dominique Wilkins, Tim Duncan, and Paul Pierce. The next targets on the list are Hakeem Olajuwon (26,946) and Elvin Hayes (27,313).What makes this achievement so remarkable is the time it required to reach the top 15. Now in his 18th season, Russell Westbrook is no longer the primary scoring option, often comes off the bench as a sixth man, but continues to find ways to be productive, be it through his game IQ or veteran experience. This season, Westbrook is shooting a career-high 36% from deep and 42.7% from the field with an average of 14.5 points, 6.7 rebounds, and 7.0 assists.After a turbulent season with Lakers where he failed to meet the expectations, team consistency has been an issue for Westbrook. From 2020-25, he has changed 5 teams and ultimately settled with the Kings in 2025. This was a crucial record, especially since too many questions were raised regarding his performance.For their next meet-up, the Sacramento Kings will be hosting the Milwaukee Bucks at Golden 1 Center this weekend.Also read: NBA’s Highest-Paid Centers This Season: Nikola Jokić, Anthony Davis & More","Russell westbrook surpassed oscar robertson to become the highest-scoring point guard in the history of the nba.

The Rose Parade, officially known as the Tournament of Roses Parade, is one of America’s most celebrated New Year’s traditions. Held on the New Year's Day in Pasadena, California, every year, the parade includes beautifully decorated floats made with flowers, parade bands, etc. It began in 1890 as a way to show off Pasadena’s pleasant weather during the winters and has now grown into a celebration watched by hundreds of thousands in person and by millions on television. The parade takes place early in the morning along Colorado Boulevard and is followed later in the day by the famous Rose Bowl college football game. Volunteers known as “White Suiters” spend hours each year to help prepare the floats and manage the crowd.In 2026, the parade’s theme was “The Magic in Teamwork”, celebrating unity. The Grand Marshal is a position that leads the parade and takes part in the Rose Bowl coin toss. This new year, that is, in 2026, it was NBA legend Magic Johnson. Johnson’s selection as the Marshal goes not only to his legendary basketball career but also his lifelong commitment to teamwork and community work.Magic Johnson’s commitment as the Grand Marshal of the 137th Rose Parade brought even greater excitement to the much-celebrated moment. Johnson, widely regarded as one of the greatest basketball players of all time, enjoyed a brief career with the Los Angeles Lakers as their guard, winning NBA championships and NBA MVP honors.

This major impact has made his role as the Grand Marshal especially very meaningful, celebrating both his personal success and his contributions to society.As the Grand Marshal, Magic Johnson rode down Colorado Boulevard as the head of the parade, waving to the crowds. For many fans, watching a sports icon like him take up this role was something even beyond inspirational, especially for the younger generations who may know him more from the legacy he's created off the court.

Philadelphia 76ers vs New York Knicks Betting outlook (January 3, 2026)





The Philadelphia 76ers visit the New York Knicks on January 3, 2026, for an Atlantic Division game at Madison Square Garden. Both teams come in dealing with injuries, and those absences could decide how this game plays out.New York has been strong at home, while Philadelphia has held its own on the road. With key players listed as out or questionable on both sides, this game is likely to lean heavily on the stars who are available, especially in the fourth quarter.Philadelphia 76ers will be without Kelly Oubre Jr., who is sidelined with a left knee sprain. Trendon Watford is also out due to a left adductor strain. The biggest question is Joel Embiid, who is listed as probable because of right knee injury management. If he plays, the Sixers gain a clear advantage inside. If not, their frontcourt becomes much thinner.The New York Knicks are also missing important pieces. Josh Hart remains out with an ankle injury and has already missed several games. Mitchell Robinson is listed as probable as he continues to manage his own ankle issue. Landry Shamet is unavailable with a shoulder problem, while Karl-Anthony Towns could return after missing time due to illness.Tip-off is set for 7:30 p.m. ET. The game will air on NBA TV nationally, with local broadcasts on NBC Sports Philadelphia and MSG Network. Streaming options include NBA League Pass, the ESPN app, and Fubo.New York enters the night at 23-11 and has been one of the league’s best home teams, going 15-3 at Madison Square Garden. Even with recent injuries, the Knicks have stayed competitive by controlling the glass and limiting second chances.Philadelphia is 18-14 overall and 9-6 on the road. Tyrese Maxey has carried the offense, averaging 30.9 points per game, especially when Embiid’s minutes are managed. The Sixers have had success with strong second quarters, but injuries have made it harder to sustain that level across a full game.The guard matchup between Maxey and Jalen Brunson will set the tone. Both control the pace and take most of the late-game shots. If Embiid plays, his minutes against the Knicks’ bigs will matter just as much. Bench production is another concern, as both teams are missing rotation players.New York is favored by 3.5 points at home. The total sits around 232.5 points. The Knicks are listed between -162 and -166 on the moneyline, with Philadelphia between +136 and +138. Projections lean toward a narrow Knicks win, with recent trends pointing toward another high-scoring game.","The philadelphia 76ers visit the new york knicks on january 3, 2026.
