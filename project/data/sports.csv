Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each. This text is divided into three books with teachings on virtue, wealth, and love and is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality. The Kural has influenced scholars and leaders across social, political, and philosophical spheres.

Life is a grand, unpredictable game. And in this game, strategy is not optional—it is survival. And at the heart of every great strategy lies one powerful ability – the art of reading others.Be it a chessboard or a boardroom, the first move toward mastery is watching for subtle rhythms people unknowingly adopt.One of my favourite illustrations of this is from a classic Vadivelu comedy. He disguises himself in an array of costumes, yet his friends recognize him instantly. Exasperated, he asks, ""How did you know it was me?"" Their answer is simple: “You forgot to hide your trademark beehive hair.” (And isn’t that true for us all? No matter how clever the mask, our patterns betray us.Consider tennis in the 1990s. A young, fiery Boris Becker stunned audiences with his serves—earning the nickname. When he first clashed with Andre Agassi, a master of returns, Becker triumphed easily in the first three matches.But soon, something changed.In their next eleven matches, Agassi won nine times. Years later, Agassi revealed the secret. After the losses, he started watchingof Becker’s matches obsessively and noticed that just before serving, Becker would subtly stick out his tongue. If it pointed right, the serve would follow suit, and vice versa.Agassi saved it for the pivotal moments—break points, set points—when it mattered most. The result? Becker felt, almost eerily, like Agassi could read his mind. When Agassi disclosed the truth post retirement, Becker could only laugh in disbelief.In the game of life, we’re always playing with and against others. Reading them doesn’t just give us an edge—it prepares us.There’s an African saying:Strategy isn’t only about planning. It’s the subtle art of reading your opponent’s motives, not just their moves. Their fears. Their hopes.The Japanese have a word for this—In the business world, Yomi has worked wonders. Consider the curious case of the ‘new Coke’. In the 1980s, Coca-Cola introduced a new formula with a different taste. Thousands of customers wrote letters of complaint. Eventually, the company “listened” and reintroduced the original Coke.Sales soared.Some industry veterans still believe it was all part of a larger plan. Coca-Colataking something away would reignite affection for it. If true, this wasn’t a product failure—it was strategic brilliance.Even Thiruvalluvar, centuries ago, revered this gift. In, he writes:The greatest strategists are not always the loudest or the boldest. They are the ones who quietly listen, observe, and understand. They hide their beehive hair. They watch for the tongue’s direction. They think like rats to catch them. And in doing so, they play not just the game, but the minds behind it.So, the next time you find yourself at the crossroads, pause. Observe the patterns. Listen to the silence between the words. In that moment, you will see not just the obvious, but what is hidden —that will lead you to your next move.Then you will fight, with the power of being a part of your opponent’s mind.","Thirukkural is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality.

"“What is wrong with NFL owners"": Donald Trump can’t believe Shedeur Sanders wasn’t a first-round pick, slams team owners as ‘stupid’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/what-is-wrong-with-nfl-owners-donald-trump-cant-believe-shedeur-sanders-wasnt-a-first-round-pick-slams-team-owners-as-stupid/articleshow/120635077.cms,"NFL owners branded ‘stupid’ by Trump over Shedeur Sanders’ shocking first-round draft omission (Credit: Getty Images)

President Trump slams NFL owners as ‘stupid’ for skipping Shedeur Sanders in first round of 2025 draft



The NFL Draft is known for its unpredictability, but the dramatic fall of Colorado quarterback Shedeur Sanders into the third round of the 2025 Draft has shocked many football fans and analysts. Once touted as a potential No. 1 overall pick, Sanders now finds himself still waiting for a team to take a chance on him—despite boasting an impressive college résumé and pedigree. His fall out of the first and even second round not only stunned onlookers but sparked widespread debate across social and sports media.Shedeur, the son of NFL Hall of Famer Deion Sanders , was projected by many to be a first-round talent, with the Pittsburgh Steelers among the teams frequently linked to him in mock drafts. Yet, after 65 selections, his name still hadn't been called. While draft boards fluctuate and team needs vary, the lack of confidence in Sanders by quarterback-needy teams is puzzling, especially after his standout 2024 season, where he was named Big 12 Offensive Player of the Year, leading Colorado to a strong 9-4 finish.Perhaps the most headline-grabbing reaction came from U.S. President Donald Trump , who launched a scathing rebuke of the league’s team owners on Truth Social. “What is wrong with NFL owners, are they STUPID?” Trump posted. “Deion Sanders was a great college football player, and was even greater in the NFL. He’s also a very good coach, streetwise and smart! Therefore, Shedeur, his quarterback son, has PHENOMENAL GENES, and is all set for Greatness. He should be ‘picked’ IMMEDIATELY by a team that wants to WIN. Good luck Shedeur, and say hello to your wonderful father!”Trump’s passionate post highlights the sentiment shared by many who feel that Sanders’ family background, athleticism, and proven leadership should have made him an early-round lock. With Deion Sanders not only being a Hall of Famer but also Shedeur’s coach at Colorado, the quarterback’s exposure to high-level mentorship and football IQ is undeniable.It’s worth noting that the NFL Draft isn’t just about talent—it’s about fit, timing, and a complex web of organizational strategies. Some franchises may have prioritized other positional needs, while others may be skeptical of media hype or external influences, even one as loud as a former president's endorsement.The real question now isn’t why Shedeur fell—it’s who will finally recognize his potential and make the move. Whether Trump’s loud backing shifts any front office decisions remains to be seen, but the spotlight on Shedeur Sanders burns brighter than ever. One thing is certain: wherever he lands, he’ll arrive with a chip on his shoulder and something to prove.Also Read: Shedeur Sanders suffers massive financial blow after NFL Draft first-round snub","Shedeur sanders, the son of nfl hall of famer deion sanders, was projected by many to be a first-round talent.

What Lauri Markkanen Brings to the Lod Angeles Lakers

Why the Jazz Might Consider This Trade

Is This A Win-Win Deal?

Thehave been performing well in recent games, thanks to dominant performances from Luka Doncic and LeBron James . However, their lack of depth outside the star trio raises questions about roster upgrades. A potential solution? Trading for Utah Jazz forwardThe Los Angeles Lakers' victory in Game 2 demonstrated how much they depended on Austin Reaves and Doncic (who scored 52 points alongside James). There were very little bench contributions; Gabe Vincent scored six points and Dorian Finney-Smith only scored seven in 39 minutes.With limited offensive support, GM Rob Pelinka might explore adding another high-caliber player. As Dean Simon of the Sporting News noted,To acquire Markkanen, the Lakers could offer a package centered around young talent and draft picks:Proposed Trade DetailsThis deal gives Utah expiring contracts, a promising rookie in Knecht, and draft assets while providing the Los Angeles Lakers a proven scorer.At 27, Lauri Markkanen is entering his prime. Though his numbers dipped slightly this season (19.0 PPG, 5.9 RPG), his 2022-23 campaign proved his elite scoring ability (25.6 PPG). Playing for a tanking Jazz team likely impacted his production.Key Strengths:- Elite Shooting: Career 37.1% from three, perfect for spacing alongside Doncic and James.- Pick-and-Roll Threat: His size (7’0”) and athleticism make him a dangerous lob finisher.- Versatility: Can play both forward spots, fitting seamlessly into the Los Angeles Lakers’ system.Utah is in rebuild mode, and Markkanen’s value won’t be higher. Acquiring Knecht—a high-upside prospect—along with a future pick accelerates their youth movement. Hachimura and Vanderbilt provide short-term flexibility with expiring deals.For the Lakers, adding Markkanen creates a ""Big Three"" capable of contending for years. For the Jazz, it’s a chance to stockpile assets. While unlikely, this trade could reshape the Western Conference hierarchy.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Los Angeles Lakers could bag $97 million Brooklyn Nets center to support LeBron James and Luka Doncic in Championship push Would you make this trade if you were Rob Pelinka?

NEW DELHI: Just a season after leading Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) to IPL glory, Shreyas Iyer returns to Eden Gardens in opposition colours, now captaining a rejuvenated Punjab Kings (PBKS).Let go by KKR in a shock off-season move, Iyer has found form and leadership comfort under mentor Ricky Ponting, guiding PBKS to the top five with five wins from eight. With 263 runs and three fifties, Iyer now has a chance to deliver a KL Rahul-style statement knock against his former team.KKR, however, are floundering with five losses in eight. Their top-order is shaky, the middle-order misfiring, and spin options underwhelming on home turf.Calls for change may see Rovman Powell come in, while Angkrish Raghuvanshi remains a lone batting bright spot. Ajinkya Rahane’s conservative approach and Sunil Narine’s lack of impact have also added pressure.PBKS, on the other hand, look confident with Marco Jansen’s early bursts, Nehal Wadhera’s finishing skills, and Arshdeep Singh’s 11 wickets leading the attack. Yuzvendra Chahal, who wrecked KKR in their 95 all-out collapse last week, looms large again.KKR must win five of their remaining six to stay in playoff contention, but with just one home win this season and internal issues, including pitch controversies, they face a tough task.Saturday’s clash is more than just a game: it’s personal, tactical, and possibly season-defining.Rahmanullah Gurbaz (wk), Sunil Narine, Ajinkya Rahane (c), Venkatesh Iyer, Rinku Singh , Andre Russell, Moeen Ali, Ramandeep Singh , Harshit Rana, Vaibhav Arora, Varun Chakaravarthy, Angkrish RaghuvanshiPrabhsimran Singh, Priyansh Arya, Shreyas Iyer (c), Josh Inglis(wk), Nehal Wadhera, Shashank Singh, Marcus Stoinis, Marco Jansen, Xavier Bartlett, Arshdeep Singh, Yuzvendra Chahal, Harpreet BrarBrace for a hot Saturday in Kolkata.

Brief scores:

Chennai Super Kings:

Sunrisers Hyderabad:

Sunrisers Hyderabad dealt a massive blow to Chennai Super Kings’ playoff hopes with a five-wicket win in a battle of strugglers at the MA Chidambaram Stadium on Friday. The victory, SRH's first-ever at Chepauk, was powered by Harshal Patel ’s brilliant 4 for 28 on a sluggish surface and a composed chase that took them over the line in 18.4 overs.Chennai’s batting frailties continued to haunt them as they were bundled out for 154 in 19.5 overs. Dewald Brevis top-scored with a fluent 42 off 25 balls, while Deepak Hooda’s late cameo of 22 helped CSK limp past 150. The SRH pace attack, led by Harshal’s clever variations and supported ably by Pat Cummins (2/21), Jaydev Unadkat (2/21), and Mohammed Shami (1/28), never let the hosts settle.Despite dew aiding the chase, SRH made hard work of the modest target. After early setbacks, Ishan Kishan (44 off 34) anchored the innings, before Kamindu Mendis (32* off 22) and Nitish Kumar Reddy (19* off 13) finished the job with a calm 49-run unbroken stand for the sixth wicket.With this win, SRH moved to eighth in the ten-team table, collecting six points from nine matches. Their playoff hopes, though slim, remain alive — requiring them to win all five of their remaining fixtures, and by a healthy margin to stay in contention.For CSK, it was their seventh loss in nine games, leaving them at the bottom of the table and needing a near-miracle to qualify — five consecutive wins and a favourable points cut-off. The loss also highlighted their mounting concerns: a brittle top-order, a lack of bowling bite, and diminishing confidence across the board.154 all out in 19.5 overs (Dewald Brevis 42; Harshal Patel 4/28).155/5 in 18.4 overs (Ishan Kishan 44).","Sunrisers hyderabad dealt a massive blow to chennai super kings’ playoff hopes with a five-wicket win in a battle of strugglers at the ma chidambaram stadium on friday.

Chad Gable opens up on Jason Jordan’s role backstage

WWE Superstar Chad Gable is embracing a whirlwind of emotions following WrestleMania 41, where he quietly made his mark under a mask. While he was not advertised for the main event, Gable did compete, just not as himself.In a light-hearted yet honest conversation with Rope Breaks, Gable revealed that he felt ""robbed"" of a proper WrestleMania spotlight yet again. “I got robbed again, man,” Gable said, referencing his absence under his real name. “This year, by this new guy, comes out of nowhere. Two matches, and he’s on WrestleMania. Can you imagine how I feel? Twelve years in, thirteen years in?”The “new guy” he’s talking about? None other than El Grande Americano , Gable’s own masked persona. On Night 2 of WrestleMania 41, Gable, as El Grande Americano, faced off against Rey Fenix. The match wasn’t originally scheduled, but Fenix stepped in as a last-minute replacement for the injured Rey Mysterio, who pulled out due to a torn groin.The character switch offered Gable a fun detour from his usual in-ring identity. And while the match was kept under wraps in the lead-up to the event, fans in attendance were treated to a surprise clash that ended with Gable scoring the victory under a mask.Beyond WrestleMania, Gable also spoke candidly in another interview, this time with The Ringer Wrestling Show , about working with his longtime friend and former tag team partner Jason Jordan. Jordan, now a WWE producer, plays a key behind-the-scenes role and often helps lay out Gable’s matches.“I get the biggest smile on my face anytime I see I’m working with him on a Monday,” Gable said. “Everybody does, to be fair. If anybody gets to work with Jason, they are over the moon because he is so good.”Gable and Jordan were part of the tag team American Alpha, a fan-favorite duo known for their strong chemistry and technical wrestling. Even though Jordan had to retire early due to injury, their bond remains intact.“With me, especially, we could do our whole work together and never speak a word,” Gable said. “We were like brothers when we were a tag team. It was something that was for sure meant to be.”As Chad Gable continues to evolve both in-ring and through alter-egos like El Grande Americano, his connection to WWE’s roots - both in friendship and performance, remains stronger than ever. And perhaps, next year, he’ll finally get that WrestleMania spotlight - no mask required.","Wwe superstar chad gable is embracing a whirlwind of emotions following wrestlemania 41.

Sachin Tendulkar at 52: Power, Pride, and a Nation’s Pulse

NEW DELHI: Batting maestro Virat Kohli continues to dazzle in the IPL 2025 season, smashing his fifth half-century as Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) edged out Rajasthan Royals by 11 runs at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium on Thursday. Kohli's 42-ball 70 powered RCB to 205/5 - a total their bowlers successfully defended, securing the team's sixth win of the season and lifting them to third in the points table.Now playing his 18th season - all for RCB - the 36-year-old is second in the Orange Cap race with 392 runs at an average of 65.33 and a strike rate of 144.11. But beyond the numbers, it's Kohli's mindset that continues to inspire.RCB mentor and batting coach Dinesh Karthik was effusive in his praise. ""Virat Kohli, what do you tell about him? There's a loss for words purely because of the hunger that he has,"" Karthik said in a video shared by the franchise. ""It's one thing to play IPL for 18 years, but it's a different thing to be consistent for 18 years.""Karthik revealed Kohli's deep reflection after RCB's early home games. ""He told me, 'Probably could have thought a little better,' and he knows a lot of people turn up just to watch him bat.""""The way he adapts, understands situations... I'm too small a person to even speak about it.

Brandon Hagel Interference Major Against Aleksander Barkov

Aleksander Barkov's injury raises questions before critical Game 3



Florida Panthers' captain Aleksander Barkov had to leave Thursday evening's Game 2 vs. the Tampa Bay Lightning following a big hit from Brandon Hagel that left the Florida Panthers down to one of their most valuable players in the latter stages of the game. It was a dark cloud for Florida's 2-0 victory, which took the Florida Panthers 2-0 up on their first-round Eastern Conference series.The game was turned around midway through the third period when Brandon Hagel collided with Aleksander Barkov, dropping the Florida Panthers captain to a knee. Though Aleksander Barkov skated off on his own, he went straight to the locker room and did not return. The Florida Panthers were down over 10 minutes in regulation before they had to finish without their captain.Officials awarded Brandon Hagel a five-minute major for interference, a call protested on the spot by Lightning head coach Jon Cooper. “I was a little surprised it was a (major) ... five minutes in a 1-0 game with eight minutes to play, nine minutes to play, that's a tough situation to be in,” Cooper said after the game.Panthers head coach Paul Maurice provided no postgame update on Aleksander Barkov's status, merely saying, “Nope,” when asked if the team had any information. “We’ll evaluate him and see where he’s at,” he added.Aleksander Barkov already has three assists in the series, one on the game-winner Thursday night by Nate Schmidt. Schmidt, who also scored twice in Game 1, has become an unwanted offensive savior for Florida at the beginning of this series.

NEW DELHI: Sunrisers Hyderabad 's veteran fast bowler Mohammed Shami made IPL history on Friday at Chennai's MA Chidambaram stadium . He became the first bowler to take a wicket on the first ball of an innings four times in IPL history. His latest victim was Chennai Super Kings ' young opener Shaik Rasheed during their IPL 2025 match.The historic moment came when Shami delivered a perfect seam-up ball that moved away from the off-stump. Rasheed tried to play a hard punch shot but only managed to edge it to Abhishek Sharma in the slips. This dismissal added to Shami's impressive list of first-ball wickets, which includes Jacques Kallis (Dubai, 2014), KL Rahul (Wankhede, 2022), and Phil Salt (Ahmedabad, 2023).The match began with SRH captain Pat Cummins winning the toss and choosing to bowl first at Chepauk.CSK's young opening pair of Rasheed and Ayush Mhatre created their own piece of history.

This makes Rasheed and Mhatre the second-youngest opening pair in IPL history.

What the Bucks need to do differently

Down 2-0, the Bucks need a spark to turn things around—and all eyes are onThe good news for Milwaukee Bucks fans is that Giannis Antetokounmpo will suit up tonight. Despite the team’s struggles in the first two games, the Greek Freak has been dominant, dropping 34 points, 18 rebounds, and 7 assists in Game 2. His presence alone gives Milwaukee a fighting chance, but he can’t do it alone.The injury report is mostly clean for Milwaukee, with only one player under scrutiny:- Tyler Smith (Questionable) – His absence hasn’t heavily impacted the Bucks this season, so his status won’t drastically alter the rotation.Here’s how Milwaukee is expected to line up for Game 3:The Pacers have outplayed Milwaukee so far, capitalizing on the Bucks’ mistakes and lack of urgency. Tyrese Haliburton has been a key factor, and Indiana’s aggressive play has exposed Milwaukee’s weaknesses.- Damian Lillard’s struggles – In Game 2, Lillard managed only 14 points, 7 assists, and 3 rebounds. The Bucks need him to regain his rhythm.- Defensive lapses – The Pacers have controlled the tempo, and Milwaukee must tighten up defensively.- Over-reliance on Giannis – While Antetokounmpo is a force, the supporting cast must step up.Bucks head coach Doc Rivers isn’t panicking yet. He believes the series is far from over and expects a stronger performance at home.""I look at it as a long series (and) we haven’t played a home game,"" Rivers said. ""We have to go home and take care of business, then we can talk. I’m very confident about this series.

NEW DELHI: At 43, MS Dhoni continues to redefine longevity and legacy in cricket. On Friday night at the MA Chidambaram Stadium, during Chennai Super Kings ' crucial clash against Sunrisers Hyderabad, Dhoni walked out for his 400th T20 match, becoming only the fourth Indian to do so, after Rohit Sharma (456), Dinesh Karthik (412), and Virat Kohli (407).From lifting the 2007 T20 World Cup for India to guiding CSK to five IPL titles, Dhoni's influence on the shortest format has been immense.Across these 400 games -- played for India, CSK, Rising Pune Supergiant, and Jharkhand -- Dhoni has scored 7,566 runs at a strike rate of 135.90, with 28 half-centuries and a highest score of 84 not out.Behind the stumps, he remains unmatched, holding a record 34 stumpings and 318 dismissals overall.Though no longer the explosive finisher of his peak, Dhoni still commands respect every time he dons the gloves.His reflexes remain razor-sharp, and his tactical nous continues to steer CSK’s approach in crunch moments.Dhoni has resumed captaincy duties this season after Ruturaj Gaikwad was ruled out with an elbow fracture.It marks his first full-time return to leadership since the unforgettable 2023 IPL final, where CSK clinched their fifth title. While the 2025 season hasn’t been kind, CSK sit near the bottom of the table with just two wins in eight games, Dhoni’s presence still draws packed stands and unwavering fan support.In a match that could define the season for both CSK and SRH, Dhoni’s 400th game is more than a statistic — it’s a celebration of endurance, evolution, and excellence in T20 cricket.

FOR CHACHU WITH LOVE

Sunrisers Hyderabad batter Aniket Verma (R) with his uncle Amit Verma (L).

A NATURAL

Aniket Verma 's childhood hero is Hardik Pandya Aniket was not only captivated by Hardik Pandya's strokeplay but also intrigued by his backstory. His uncle, Amit Verma, narrated the story of how Hardik and his brother Krunal survived on Maggi for three years due to financial constraints. ""Aniket must have been 14 back then. I read it in a newspaper and told him the story while we were on our way to his academy,"" Amit told TimesofIndia.com.The distance between Verma's rented accommodation and the Ankur Cricket Academy, where Aniket trained, was 13 kilometers. Amit recalls that his nephew kept asking him about Hardik Pandya's journey, his struggles, and rise. ""That day, I saw the spirit, the passion, and the hunger in him. He wanted to make it big. Once we reached the stadium, he touched my feet and said, 'I complain about trivial things.' I laughed, but he was serious,"" he says.Fast forward to the present, and Aniket is making waves in the IPL with his six-hitting abilities. In just 56 balls, he has already hit 12 sixes. On Sunday, against Delhi Capitals, with his team at 25 for 3, he smashed a 41-ball 74, studded with five fours and six sixes. Against Lucknow Super Giants, he clobbered a 13-ball 36 with five maximums. The sample size is small, but against spin, he is as effective as his Sunrisers teammate Heinrich Klaasen. He picks up lengths early and muscles the ball over the boundary rope.Aniket lost his mother when he was three. A year later, his father remarried. This forced his grandmother, Parvati Verma, to move to Bhopal alongside Amit.""We moved to Bhopal. I had just finished school. My late father was in the Railways, so my mother received his pension. She took care of me and Anni (Aniket's nickname). Since I called her 'Ma' or 'Mummy,' Aniket also picked it up and calls her the same. It was tough, but we managed,"" recounts Amit.When Aniket turned eight, Amit, a cricket enthusiast, took him to Nand Jeet Singh, a coach at Railways Youth Sports Club in Bhopal. Impressed by young Aniket's hand-eye coordination and aware of their financial situation, Nand Jeet waived his fees. Aniket trained there for two years before Nand Jeet sent him to Jyoti Prakash Tyagi. ""Unique kid. He called me before joining the squad. I gave him my blessings. The family stayed in one of my flats for years. I have seen him grow in stature,"" says Singh.Before the IPL started, when TimesofIndia.com reached out to Aniket for an interview, his first response was, ""Brother, I haven't achieved anything yet. I'm not even a regular for MP. Can we do this interview after the IPL season?"" After some persuasion, the youngster replied, ""You talk to my uncle. He can tell you better. His life has revolved around me.""Amit, who returned to Bhopal after traveling with Aniket for the first three matches, became emotional when he unwrapped the gift Aniket gave him. Aniket had asked him to open it once he reached home. It was a branded shoe with a message: ""To the world's best Chachu.""""My first job was at an automobile showroom. My salary was Rs 3,000. He was playing with torn shoes. I immediately took him to the shop and bought him sports shoes that cost Rs 1,200. I had never worn something that expensive in my life, but for him, I would have done anything. He slept with his new shoes that day,"" laughs Amit, who now works for a private company and earns Rs 20,000 per month.Aniket's coach, Jyoti Prakash Tyagi, says his ward was always a natural and played with aggressive intent, but he feels the 23-year-old is still raw and needs to work on certain areas.""There is no question about his work ethic. I have seen that those who don't think about Plan 'B' or 'C' are the ones who nail their Plan 'A' with precision. I never stopped him from playing aggressive cricket. Now, cricket has changed. His strength is to go aerial and take on the bowlers. Why curb that aggression? It's his strength,"" says Tyagi.""I still feel he needs to learn how to finish games. He must develop that temperament if he wants to play for his country. He will learn from experience, and in the next games, I would like him to take his team home. The intent should remain the same,"" he says.Aniket was scouted by Sunrisers Hyderabad during the 2024 Madhya Pradesh Premier League . Playing for Bhopal Leopards, he amassed 273 runs in six innings, hitting a staggering 25 sixes.""We were over the moon when he was hitting sixes for fun in the MPL. Never thought he would do the same in the IPL,"" said Amit with a laugh.","Aniket verma is making waves in the ipl with his six-hitting abilities. In just 56 balls, he has already hit 12 sixes. On sunday, against delhi capitals, he smashed a 41-ball 74, studded with five fours and six sixers.

Sachin Tendulkar at 52: Power, Pride, and a Nation’s Pulse

NEW DELHI: It’s a moment that will be replayed all season and maybe even for years. During a high-octane IPL 2025 clash between Chennai Super Kings and Sunrisers Hyderabad at the MA Chidambaram Stadium on Friday, Kamindu Mendis pulled off an astonishing catch that’s already being hailed as the “Catch of the Tournament”.In the 13th over, with Dewald Brevis threatening to take the game away from SRH, Harshal Patel delivered a tempting half-volley wide outside off.Brevis, in red-hot form, launched into a fierce lofted drive toward long-off. It looked destined to race away for six until Mendis took flight.The ambidextrous Sri Lankan, already known for his unique bowling ability, showcased outrageous athleticism.Watch:At full stretch and diving wide like a goalkeeper, he clung onto the ball mid-air, barely an inch from the ground.As he landed, he expertly cushioned the fall to prevent the ball from bouncing out. His teammates erupted, led by skipper Pat Cummins, who couldn’t contain his excitement and was the first to embrace Mendis.Brevis, stunned, could only walk off with a respectful nod, having scored 42 off just 25.But that wasn’t the only talking point. Earlier in the match, Ravindra Jadeja was forced to swap his bat after it failed a surprise umpire inspection. The gauge test ruled it out of regulation, causing a brief but curious delay. The same incident happened to batter Noor Ahmad later in the innings.Thanks to another dismal batting performance, CSK could only pose 154 all out in 19.5 overs.","Kamindu mendis pulled off an astonishing catch during ipl 2025 clash between chennai super kings and sunrisers hyderabad.
