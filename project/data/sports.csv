Auston Matthews and his fans got emotional as his mother opened up about the financial struggles of getting him into hockey,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/auston-matthews-and-his-fans-got-emotional-as-his-mother-opened-up-about-the-financial-struggles-of-getting-him-into-hockey/articleshow/121166477.cms,"Image credit - Paige Taylor White/CP

Auston Matthews’ hockey dream wasn’t cheap and his mom took the weight

“I used to work in the morning for Starbucks, in the afternoon the restaurant, i was very fortunate to have two jobs. And believe me, if they would have more hours, I would have more jobs.""





Before Auston Matthews was an NHL superstar, his biggest supporter was clocking into two jobs, trying to make ends meet. His mom, Ema Matthews, didn’t just believe in his dream, she bankrolled it, penny by penny, from behind a Starbucks counter. For families without deep pockets, hockey can be financially brutal. But Ema’s resilience turned obstacles into opportunity and her son into one of the league’s brightest stars. Her story is the heartwarming reminder that every great athlete often has a real-life superhero cheering from the sidelines, sacrificing, hustling, and holding it all together so their child can chase the impossible.Ice time, gear, coaching, travel, youth hockey isn’t just a sport, it’s a financial beast. For the Matthews family, especially with Ema being originally from Hermosillo, Mexico, the culture and cost of the sport were both daunting. But she took on the challenge without hesitation, picking up multiple jobs including a gig at Starbucks to ensure Auston never missed a chance to grow on the ice. She juggled long hours, late nights, and early mornings, often sacrificing her own comfort and time just to make sure Auston’s hockey dreams stayed alive and on track.Ema shared in a past interview that the cost of hockey often reached up to $20,000 a year, a heavy ask for any middle-class family. To make it work, she didn’t just cut corners, she picked up shifts and poured lattes while helping Auston stay focused on the sport. She even deposited small amounts of money in his account so he could grab food with teammates like a regular teen. Beyond that, Ema often drove long hours to tournaments, handled equipment costs, and juggled bills, all to ensure Auston had every chance to chase his dreams without added stress.Ema’s story also breaks stereotypes. In a sport dominated by players from Canada and northern U.S. states, Auston’s rise as a player of Mexican heritage makes his success even more impactful. It's not just about talent, it’s about trailblazing, especially for kids of color or immigrant families who rarely see themselves represented in hockey.Auston Matthews is one of the Toronto Maple Leafs’ biggest stars and a face of the NHL. He’s not just known for his goal-scoring skills but also for his poise and work ethic, traits his mom likely helped instill. While fans celebrate his success on the ice, stories like Ema’s remind us of the sacrifices behind the scenes that made it possible, from long car rides to practices, emotional support during tough losses, and the quiet strength that helped shape his journey to stardom.Ema Matthews’ story shows what’s possible when love, grit, and hustle lead the way, proving that behind every great athlete stands a family whose unwavering support shapes both their character and their incredible achievements. Her journey highlights the sacrifices, encouragement, and strength that fuel success, reminding us that triumphs on the ice are built far beyond the rink, in the hearts and homes of those who believe the most.Also read - “From baptism to strip club”: Pete Blackburn’s unhinged NHL comparison is going viral and fans totally get it","Auston matthews is one of the toronto maple leafs’ biggest stars and a face of the nhl.

Stefon Diggs under fire as viral boat video ignites drug-related rumors

Coach Mike Vrabel and the Patriots respond with discretion





New England Patriots wide receiver Stefon Diggs is back in the spotlight for all the wrong reasons. A recently surfaced video shows the star NFL player on a boat with a group of women, allegedly handing them a bag filled with pink crystals. The footage, which quickly spread across social media, has fueled intense speculation over the nature of the substance — with many users suspecting it to be “pink cocaine,” though there is no confirmation of that claim.In the viral video, Stefon Diggs is seen chatting casually with three women who reportedly referred to him as “Daddy” before he passed around the bag of pink material. “Yikes: NFL fans are speculating that Stefon Diggs handed these three girls what looks to be pink c*caine after he asked them to call him Daddy,” one user wrote on X (formerly Twitter). Others followed suit with similar reactions, suggesting Diggs was “serving pink cocaine” and even labeling him “a football player, pimp and a drug dealer. ”Despite the wave of viral commentary, there is currently no official evidence confirming that the substance was illicit. Still, the video has created a media storm, putting both Diggs and the Patriots in a difficult position during the offseason.When asked about the situation, Patriots head coach Mike Vrabel addressed the controversy during a media session ahead of an optional team practice, which Diggs did not attend.“It’s something that we’re aware of. Obviously, we want to make great decisions on and off the field,” Vrabel said. He added that his discussions with Diggs “will remain between him I and the club.”The NFL has chosen not to comment on the situation at this time, with a league spokesperson telling the Associated Press there would be no statement regarding the video.Also Read: T.J.

Cardi B, who filed for divorce from rapper Offset last year, was reportedly also on the boat during the controversial outing.As the video continues to circulate online, all eyes are on the NFL and Stefon Diggs’ camp for an official response.","New england patriots wide receiver stefon diggs is back in the spotlight for all the wrong reasons.

Mumbai Indians (MI) head into the IPL 2025 Qualifier 2 with a historical edge and recent momentum on their side, as they prepare to face a shaken Punjab Kings (PBKS) on Sunday in Ahmedabad.MI, under Hardik Pandya's leadership, are eyeing a sixth title after a 20-run win over Gujarat Titans in the Eliminator. In contrast, Shreyas Iyer-led PBKS enter the do-or-die clash low on confidence, following a heavy defeat to Royal Challengers Bengaluru in Qualifier 1.MI’s depth and experience in knockout games, coupled with standout performances from Rohit Sharma, Jasprit Bumrah and Suryakumar Yadav, give them a clear advantage. The form of Jonny Bairstow and Richard Gleeson has also strengthened their case. Bumrah’s tactical deployment has been key, offering MI control even on batting-friendly tracks.PBKS, meanwhile, must regroup quickly. Their bowling attack — missing Marco Jansen and Yuzvendra Chahal — looked vulnerable in their previous match. Arshdeep Singh is under pressure to lead an inexperienced unit. The explosive opening pair of Prabhsimran Singh and Priyansh Arya needs to fire, while the team draws belief from a win over MI earlier this season.The outcome may hinge on which bowling unit adapts better to Ahmedabad’s high-scoring conditions.Total matches played: 33Punjab Kings: 16Mumbai Indians: 17The pitch at Ahmedabad is expected to offer ideal conditions for batting, especially as the match progresses. The surface has a consistent grass covering and a hint of early moisture, but the intense heat is likely to dry it out quickly, making it a true wicket with good bounce and carry. The ball should come on nicely to the bat, favouring stroke play throughout the innings. The square boundaries measure 61 and 67 metres, while the straight boundary stretches to 73 metres, offering some help to the bowlers who can vary their lengths smartly.Priyansh Arya, Prabhsimran Singh, Josh Inglis(w), Shreyas Iyer(c), Nehal Wadhera, Shashank Singh, Marcus Stoinis, Azmatullah Omarzai, Harpreet Brar, Arshdeep Singh, Kyle JamiesonImpact Sub: Suryansh ShedgeJonny Bairstow (w), Rohit Sharma, Corbin Bosch, Suryakumar Yadav, Tilak Varma, Hardik Pandya (c), Naman Dhir, Mitchell Santner, Deepak Chahar, Trent Boult, Jasprit BumrahImpact Sub: Karn SharmaSunday’s IPL 2025 Qualifier 2 in Ahmedabad is expected to enjoy clear weather conditions.

India Test squad vs England: Ajit Agarkar full press conference





NEW DELHI: India’s batting mainstays Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma, along with ace spinner Ravichandran Ashwin, have retired from Test cricket, while star pacer Mohammed Shami will miss the crucial five-match series in England due to fitness issues.All eyes are now on the Shubman Gill-led Indian side, widely regarded as one of the most inexperienced teams to tour England in recent memory.In the absence of Kohli and Rohit, India's batting line-up appears quite thin in experience. So, could the selectors consider recalling experienced campaigners like Cheteshwar Pujara or Ajinkya Rahane , who are yet to retire from the traditional format, to strengthen the top order?During a recent interview, Pujara was asked whether Gautam Gambhir had reached out to him regarding the England tour.""No, not yet,"" Pujara told Lallantop when asked, ""Have you received a phone call from Gambhir yet?""Also See: MI vs GT IPL Live Score The 103-Test veteran expressed his readiness to return if given the opportunity.""I am ready. I don't know if they will take me or not. But if I get a chance, yes, it will be an honour to represent the country again. As a cricketer, you always feel that as long as you are fit, as long as you are contributing, and if I have a good performance in domestic cricket, and I am preparing well, if I get a chance, yes, I will be more than happy to be part of the team,"" Pujara said. Shubman Gill has been handed the responsibility of leading the Indian Test team through a “massive transition” period, with the dynamic Rishabh Pant appointed as his deputy for what is expected to be a stern challenge in English conditions.At just 25, Gill becomes India’s fifth youngest Test captain, following in the footsteps of Mansoor Ali Khan Pataudi (21), Sachin Tendulkar (23), Kapil Dev (24), and Ravi Shastri (25). The first Test against England is scheduled to begin on June 20 in Leeds.""Last year or so we have looked at Shubman (for leadership). We are hopeful he is the guy who is going (to take the team forward). It is a high pressure job but he is a terrific player. We wish him all the best,"" said chief selector Ajit Agarkar after announcing the 18-member squad, which included no major surprises.Explaining Pant’s appointment as vice-captain, Agarkar added: ""Pant is one of our best batters in Test cricket over the last four-five years. A wicketkeeper can see the game well and that's why he is Shubman's deputy.""The squad also features maiden Test call-ups for promising left-hander B Sai Sudharsan and left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh.","Virat kohli, rohit sharma and ravichandran ashwin have retired from test cricket.

Paris Saint-Germain won their first-ever Champions League title with a historic 5-0 victory over Inter Milan in Munich on Saturday. Teenager Desire Doue scored twice, while Achraf Hakimi, Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, and substitute Senny Mayulu added goals in what became the most one-sided final in the tournament's 70-year history.The French champions dominated from the start, with Doue setting up Hakimi for the opening goal in the 12th minute. Doue then scored his first goal in the 20th minute through a deflected shot.The teenager added his second goal after the hour mark, effectively sealing the victory before Kvaratskhelia and young substitute Mayulu completed the rout.""This means everything. It's our dream. It's incredible. The result is not by magic. I'm happy we did it like this,"" said PSG midfielder Vitinha.The victory marks a significant milestone for PSG, coming after more than a decade of investment from their Qatari owners and five years after their only previous final appearance, where they lost to Bayern Munich.PSG completed a domestic treble with this victory, becoming only the second French club to win Europe's premier competition after Marseille's triumph in 1993.For manager Luis Enrique, it represents his second Champions League title, following his 2015 success with Barcelona.""It was the objective since the start of last season to make history. I have felt a really strong connection with the players and the supporters,"" Luis Enrique told Canal Plus.This PSG team, rebuilt over the past two years following Kylian Mbappe's departure, has emerged as one of the competition's most impressive sides.Inter Milan, seeking their first Champions League title since 2010, failed to match PSG's intensity throughout the match. The defeat means they end the season without any trophies, having also missed out on the Serie A title to Napoli.""PSG absolutely deserved to win this match. We are very disappointed,"" said Inter coach Simone Inzaghi.""As a coach I am proud of our campaign, but we're not satisfied with tonight's game. PSG outplayed us. I thanked the players for what they did this season. We won no silverware, but I'm proud.""The match at the Allianz Arena saw PSG take control early, with Vitinha's pass finding Doue, who assisted Hakimi for the opener. Hakimi chose not to celebrate against his former club.The second goal came from a counter-attack, with Willian Pacho's clearance leading to a sequence involving Kvaratskhelia, Ousmane Dembele, and Doue, whose shot deflected off Federico Dimarco.Inter's only notable chance came when Marcus Thuram headed wide from a corner in the first half.The second half saw PSG extend their lead further. Dembele and Vitinha combined to set up Doue for his second goal past goalkeeper Yann Sommer.Kvaratskhelia added the fourth goal in the 73rd minute after being released by Dembele.Nineteen-year-old Mayulu completed the scoring in the 86th minute, exchanging passes with Bradley Barcola before finding the net.The five-goal victory marked the first time a team had scored that many in a European Cup final since Benfica in 1962, cementing PSG's place in football history.","Paris saint-germain beat inter milan 5-0 in champions league final in munich.

A high-stakes IPL 2025 Eliminator between Mumbai Indians and Gujarat Titans took an intense turn on Friday, not just for the cricket but for a fiery mid-pitch exchange between Jasprit Bumrah and Rahul Tewatia . While Mumbai sealed a thrilling 20-run win to book a spot in Qualifier 2 against Punjab Kings, the moment between the two Indian players became a talking point.The flashpoint came in the 18th over of Gujarat's tense run chase. Tewatia launched Bumrah for a massive six over deep mid-wicket, sending a jolt through MI’s camp. But the very next delivery saw a swing and a miss, followed by another failed attempt where Tewatia only managed a leg bye. As he rushed to the non-striker's end, he muttered something under his breath — words that seemingly irked Bumrah.The usually composed MI spearhead was caught on stump mic, saying, “Mereko mat bol (Don't say it to me),” making it clear he took the remark personally. Tewatia, caught off guard, quickly clarified: “Main tereko nahi bol raha hoon, main khud ko bol raha (I wasn’t talking to you, I was saying it to myself).”Thankfully, the moment didn’t spiral further. Bumrah returned to his mark without escalating the issue, and Tewatia too kept his focus on the game.

Punjab Kings (PBKS) battled through three bouts of drizzling on Saturday ahead of IPL 2025 Qualifier 2 against Mumbai Indians (MI) at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad.There were three mild showers during PBKS' three-hour training session in Ahmedabad. Ahead of the big match, PBKS may get their most experienced player, Yuzvendra Chahal , back in action. The 34-year-old, who missed PBKS' last three matches due to a wrist injury, would be desperate to play on Sunday.Chahal's right wrist was protected, but the veteran spinner did train. He played football, took catches, and bowled a few balls in the empty net. It is yet to be seen how much his wrist has recovered, but TimesofIndia.com has learned that he is ready to take injections, if needed, to get back into the playing XI.Chahal, a wily customer, will be needed by Shreyas Iyer against the five-time champions MI, who never slip up in the playoffs.Meanwhile, MI have had their own share of injury issues. Deepak Chahar, who didn't play the Eliminator due to a hamstring strain in his left leg, was at the venue for his fitness test.The MI team had reached Ahmedabad at AM on a chartered flight, but their coaching staff and medical team were at the stadium, conducting Chahar's fitness test. The other MI bowler who made it to the stadium was left-arm quick Reece Topley.Chahar looked fine, but if he is not match-fit, then Topley might play his first match for MI.While there have been some light pre-monsoon showers in Ahmedabad in the days leading up to the match, the forecast for Sunday, June 1, suggests a low chance of rain during match hours.The covers from the pitch at the Narendra Modi Stadium came off for barely five minutes, with MI coaching staff, including head coach Mahela Jayawardene, taking a quick look. This is the same pitch on which Gujarat Titans defended 217 against Rajasthan Royals, and Chennai Super Kings defended 230 against the home team. One can expect a run-fest in Qualifier 2. Of the 14 innings played in Ahmedabad, teams have crossed the 200-run mark on nine instances.Rohit Sharma, Jonny Bairstow (wk), Suryakumar Yadav, Tilak Varma, Hardik Pandya (c), Naman Dhir, Mitchell Santner, Deepak Chahar, Reece Topley, Jasprit Bumrah, Trent BoultAshwani KumarPrabhsimran Singh, Priyansh Arya, Josh Inglis (wk), Shreyas Iyer (c), Nehal Wadhera, Shashank Singh, Marcus Stoinis, Azmatullah Omarzai, Harpreet Brar, Kyle Jamieson, Yuzvendra ChahalVyshak Vijaykumar","Yuzvendra chahal is likely to return for punjab kings in the ipl 2025 qualifier 2 against mumbai indians.

Gujarat Titans skipper Shubman Gill has put an end to swirling rumours of a rift with Mumbai Indians captain Hardik Pandya following a viral video from the IPL 2025 Eliminator.On the evening of May 31, Gill took to Instagram to share photos of himself smiling with Pandya, accompanied by a clear message: “Nothing but love.

Gill’s post served as a public clarification that there is mutual respect between the two players and that the perceived tension may have been exaggerated online.The controversy began after a video clip from the toss went viral on social media. In the footage, Hardik Pandya extended his hand for a shake, but Gill appeared to walk past without acknowledging it. The clip immediately drew attention, with many interpreting it as a deliberate snub.Adding to the drama, when Gill was dismissed early in the match for just 1 run, Pandya was seen celebrating animatedly, further fuelling the narrative.However, Gill’s calm and composed response on social media has seemingly ended the speculation.","Gujarat titans skipper shubman gill has put an end to swirling rumours of a rift with mumbai indians captain hardik pandya following a viral video.

The real reason behind Jalen Ramsey trade deadlock







The Miami Dolphins and Jalen Ramsey saga is quickly turning into one of the most talked-about stories in the NFL. Once a key player in Miami’s defense, Ramsey now faces a turning point. His relationship with the team has become strained, and his big contract is making a trade complicated. But is Miami holding back only because of the money, or is there more to this situation that fans and experts haven’t figured out yet?Jalen Ramsey’s time in Miami is undeniably strained. Rumors swirl that his locker room relationships have soured, and the Dolphins appear ready to move on. Yet, the real obstacle isn’t just about player dynamics, it’s about the massive financial burden Ramsey’s contract places on Miami’s salary cap. The Dolphins are clear: they want to trade Ramsey but refuse to shoulder much of his guaranteed money, creating a complicated dance with potential suitors.ESPN insider Jeremy Fowler shed light on the hold-up, emphasizing that while interest in Ramsey is high, teams are wary of taking on the full financial weight of his deal. This isn’t just a minor negotiation; it’s a power play over millions in guaranteed cash. Miami’s strategy is to wait until after June 1, a date when the NFL’s salary cap rules allow them to free up significant cap space by moving Ramsey.This waiting game has frustrated many, as it delays the inevitable.A dam Schefter’s reports underline this growing impatience, noting that a trade announcement could come as soon as June but won’t be processed until the post-June 1 window opens. Meanwhile, Dolphins coach Mike McDaniel keeps a tight lip on the matter, focusing publicly on the current roster and refusing to elaborate on Ramsey’s uncertain future.Amid all this, Ramsey himself took to social media, trying to defuse fan backlash and clarify his mindset. His message was a rare glimpse into his perspective, he hasn’t lost respect for the cities and fans he’s played for, but he’s clearly ready to turn the page.Also Read: Pittsburgh Steelers risk 2025 season by choosing rookie Will Howard over Aaron Rodgers Whatever happens next, Jalen Ramsey’s Miami chapter is closing amid controversy and financial chess, setting the stage for a high-stakes move that could redefine both the player’s career and the Dolphins’ future defense.
