India-Pakistan Asia Cup Match Triggers Political Storm, Opposition Slams PM Modi, BJP

Team India celebrates the Asia Cup win on the podium without the trophy.

The Asia Cup 2025 final between India and Pakistan ended in ugly drama on Sunday night in Dubai, after Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman and ACC president Mohsin Naqvi allegedly walked away with the winners’ trophy, leaving the presentation ceremony in complete disarray.India, who defeated Pakistan by five wickets to clinch a record-extending ninth Asia Cup title, flatly refused to accept the silverware from Naqvi. The players stood firm at a distance from the stage, reportedly informing the organisers that they would not participate in the presentation if the PCB chief attempted to hand over the trophy.The standoff brought the ceremony to a grinding halt. As Naqvi waited awkwardly on the dais, Indian fans inside the stadium booed loudly, chanting “Bharat Mata Ki Jai”, making the atmosphere even more hostile. It was quite apparent that Naqvi didn’t want to see India getting photographed with the trophy, with organisers eventually whisking it away into the dressing room after prolonged delays.Sources revealed that the Indian team had already informed the Asian Cricket Council (ACC) that Naqvi, also Pakistan’s interior minister, was an unacceptable figure to present the cup. The refusal followed a series of frosty exchanges during the tournament — from no handshakes between players, to the absence of the traditional pre-toss photoshoot.An ACC source further revealed that the Indian team made it clear they didn’t want Naqvi on the podium.In another twist, the Pakistan players remained inside their dressing room for nearly an hour after the match, leaving Naqvi stranded on stage. When skipper Salman Agha and his team eventually emerged, they were greeted by deafening chants of “Indiaaaa, Indiaaaa” from the crowd.On the field, however, India’s win was emphatic. Tilak Varma anchored the chase with an unbeaten 69 off 53 balls, adding a crucial 60-run stand with Shivam Dube (33). Earlier, Kuldeep Yadav’s 4-30 dismantled Pakistan’s middle order, restricting them to 146 after a promising start from Sahibzada Farhan (57) and Fakhar Zaman (46).While India celebrated yet another continental crown, the night will be remembered as much for the cricket as for the chaotic and unprecedented trophy fiasco that followed.","India defeated pakistan by five wickets to clinch a record-extending ninth asia cup title.

Heated press conferences: How India and Pakistan went at each other in Asia Cup 2025

Live Score:

NEW DELHI: Another storm brewed at the Asia Cup 2025 final between India and Pakistan on Sunday at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium, as Pakistan pacers Shaheen Shah Afridi and Haris Rauf found themselves at the centre of a fresh controversy.Moments before the blockbuster clash got underway, both teams lined up for the national anthem s. Pakistan’s anthem played first, followed by India’s. While players from both sides stood in attention as per protocol, cameras captured Shaheen and Haris casually chatting during India’s national anthem — a gesture that quickly went viral and was widely slammed as “disrespectful.”The incident has only fuelled tensions in what was already a high-voltage summit clash. It came on the heels of another flashpoint: India skipper Suryakumar Yadav sticking to the “No Handshake” policy against Pakistan.At the toss, Suryakumar shook hands with broadcaster Ravi Shastri but pointedly ignored former Pakistan captain Waqar Younis. Just like in the group stage and Super Four encounters earlier in the tournament, he also skipped the customary handshake with Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha.Adding further intrigue, the toss itself was conducted in an unusual manner, with Shastri interviewing the Indian captain and Waqar handling Pakistan’s leader — a rare arrangement in world cricket.To make things worse, the Pakistan skipper also claimed that Suryakumar had shaken hands with him not once, but twice in private before the handshake snubs started on-camera.For India, the evening also began with a massive setback as skipper Suryakumar confirmed at the toss that star all-rounder Hardik Pandya was ruled out due to a niggle. The absence of Pandya, who has a proven record in big matches against Pakistan, leaves a significant void in India’s line-up.With controversies over handshakes, anthem etiquette, and team selection overshadowing the pre-match proceedings, the stage was set for an emotionally charged finale.In the end, it was India that came out on top after a tense affair in Dubai. After Pakistan were skittled out for a 146-run total, India too, had to overcome early challenges. After being reduced to 20/3 inside the powerplay, the Suryakumar-led side rode on the back of a sensational batting display from Tilak Varma (69* from 53 balls) and a solid partnership with Shivam Dube (33 from 22 balls) to clinch the trophy. In the end, it was Rinku Singh, who faced his first-ever ball of this tournament, who scored the winning runs with a four in the fourth delivery of the final over.",Pakistan pacers shaheen shah afridi and haris rauf found themselves at the centre of a fresh controversy during the national anthem.

Rookie quarterback faces controversy just days before his first NFL start

Giants turn to Jaxson Dart after Russell Wilson ’s struggles as Justin Herbert stays undefeated

A chance for Jaxson Dart to make history against the Chargers’ defense

Jaxson Dart’s NFL journey is off to a dramatic start. Just days before making his debut for the New York Giants, the 22-year-old quarterback found himself caught in the middle of a viral controversy involving a fake Instagram post linking him to pop star Madison Beer, who is rumored to be dating Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert Jaxson Dart hasn’t even taken his first official snap for the New York Giants, but the rookie quarterback is already at the center of controversy. Ahead of his debut against the undefeated Los Angeles Chargers, Dart’s name was linked to a digitally altered Instagram post that appeared to show him connected to Madison Beer — pop star and rumored partner of Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert.The image spread rapidly online, racking up nearly four million views before being debunked. While completely fabricated, the viral post fueled unnecessary drama around Dart’s first professional start, turning what should have been a straightforward quarterback storyline into an off-field distraction.Head coach Brian Daboll made the bold decision to bench Russell Wilson after an 0-3 start, handing the keys of the offense to 22-year-old Dart. The move marks a fresh chapter for the Giants, who have been searching for stability at quarterback since Eli Manning’s retirement.Justin Herbert, meanwhile, has guided the Chargers to a 3-0 start. His undefeated record combined with his rumored relationship with Beer has only heightened the intrigue surrounding this Week 4 showdown. Reports of Herbert attending Beer’s concert and later appearing alongside her in Brazil earlier this month gave the romance speculation more traction, adding to the media spotlight on his personal life.For Jaxson Dart, Sunday’s debut carries more than just personal significance. If the Giants manage to upset the 3-0 Chargers, he would become the first quarterback in 23 years to defeat an undefeated team in his very first NFL start. The last to achieve the feat was Marc Bulger in 2002, while Giants legend Phil Simms pulled it off back in 1979.Also Read: Taylor Swift makes a quick exit from Selena Gomez’s wedding to return to Travis Kelce before Chiefs vs. Ravens showdown The stakes couldn’t be higher: a potential career-defining upset for Dart against one of the league’s most complete defenses, all while trying to shake off an internet-fueled controversy that was never of his making.","Jaxson dart will make his debut for the new york giants against the los angeles chargers on sunday.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi lauded India’s thrilling Asia Cup 2025 triumph over Pakistan with a striking message on X, writing: “#OperationSindoor on the games field. Outcome is the same – India wins! Congrats to our cricketers.”The post quickly went viral, framing the victory as not just a cricketing milestone but also a symbolic triumph in a tense rivalry.This Asia Cup marked the first cricketing encounter between India and Pakistan since the Pahalgam attack and the subsequent Operation Sindoor.The arch-rivals clashed three times in the tournament, and on each occasion, India emerged victorious.On this occasion, Union Home Minister Amit Shah wrote, ""A phenomenal victory. The fierce energy of our boys blew up the rivals again.""External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar wrote, ""Congrats to Team India on winning the Asia Cup. New India delivers.""Reacting to the victory, ICC chairman Jay Shah also congratulated India, penning, ""Congratulations to Team India on lifting the Asia Cup 2025! A proud moment for Indian cricket as Team India showcases excellence, consistency, and character on the biggest stage.Kudos to the players and support staff for a stellar campaign.""On Sunday, Tilak Varma’s unbeaten 69 was the cornerstone of India’s five-wicket win in Dubai, securing a record-extending ninth Asia Cup crown.Chasing 147, India endured early jolts at 20/3 and later 77/4, but the 21-year-old left-hander displayed poise well beyond his years.With three fours and four sixes, he anchored the innings, forging a crucial 60-run partnership with Shivam Dube (33).The final over held its share of drama.India needed 10 runs from six balls after Dube’s dismissal, but Varma swung momentum back with a towering six before Rinku Singh finished the job with a boundary, sparking joyous celebrations in a stadium dominated by Indian supporters.Earlier, Kuldeep Yadav’s spin heroics (4/30) turned the contest in India’s favour.Pakistan had raced to 84 without loss, thanks to Sahibzada Farhan’s 57 and Fakhar Zaman’s 46.Yet their promising platform crumbled as they lost nine wickets for just 33 runs, eventually bowled out for 146 in 19.1 overs. Kuldeep’s 17th-over burst, three wickets in four balls, including skipper Salman Agha, was the decisive strike.The rivalry’s political undertones loomed large. There were no handshakes at the toss or after the match, echoing tensions between the neighbours. Jasprit Bumrah even mirrored Haris Rauf’s earlier gesture to the crowd after bowling him out, adding another fiery subplot to the clash.India’s third win over Pakistan in this tournament not only reaffirmed their dominance but also served as a dress rehearsal ahead of next year’s T20 World Cup.For fans, though, the moment was captured in Modi’s words and Varma’s calm finish — #OperationSindoor had played out on the cricket field, and India had triumphed again.","Prime minister narendra modi lauds india’s thrilling asia cup 2025 triumph over pakistan with a striking message on x.

Heated press conferences: How India and Pakistan went at each other in Asia Cup 2025

The Asia Cup final between India and Pakistan was so dramatic that it could easily inspire a web series, especially after Rinku Singh hit the winning runs.Indian players celebrated the win in jubilation, with man of the moment Tilak Verma playing an exceptional unbeaten 69.While the Indian players were busy celebrating, the Salman Ali Agha-led Pakistan team went straight into their dressing room and locked themselves in.There was absolute chaos as the Pakistan team delayed the post-match presentation, stepping out only after an hour while Indian cricketers and coaching staff were speaking to broadcasters.TimesofIndia.com has learnt that the Indian team did not want to receive the trophy from Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman and Asian Cricket Council (ACC) president Mohsin Naqvi, who also happens to be Pakistan's interior minister.Upon learning about India’s stance, ACC officials held discussions to address the situation. The Indian team had requested to receive the trophy from Emirates Board vice-chairman Khalid Al Zarooni, but the request was denied. Mohsin Naqvi insisted on presenting the medals and instructed that the Asia Cup trophy be taken away.India had already shown its position by avoiding handshakes with Pakistani players during all three Asia Cup encounters and skipping the customary pre-toss photoshoot.When Naqvi approached the presentation stage, Indian supporters in the stadium responded with boos and chants of “Bharat Mata Ki Jai.” Pakistani players, especially fast bowlers Haris Rauf and Shaheen Shah Afridi, were also booed by the Indian fans.Simon Doull announced that the Pakistan team would receive the runners-up medals from Naqvi, who refused. Instead, Bangladesh Cricket Board president Aminul Islam handed over the medals and asked Naqvi to give the runners-up cheque to Salman Ali Agha, which the Pakistan captain threw aside.Simon Doull later stated, “I have been informed by the ACC that the Indian cricket team will not be collecting their awards tonight. So that concludes the post-match presentation.” After this, all ACC officials, including Mohsin Naqvi, left the stadium.The Indian team patiently waited for the trophy as the champions placard was brought twice by groundsmen and then taken back. Hardik Pandya was the first to step onto the podium, taking a selfie, followed by the rest of the team and coaching staff. Captain Suryakumar Yadav mimicked Rohit Sharma's iconic T20 World Cup 2024 walk, celebrating India’s victory with an imaginary trophy.In the post-match press conference, Suryakumar slammed the ACC for withholding the trophy: “I have never seen a champion team being denied a trophy, that too a hard-earned one.” Abhishek Sharma echoed him, taking a cheeky jab: “We actually got one — Surya bhai brought it! We felt it, we knew its weight.”Meanwhile, Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha criticised the Indian team: “If he (Mohsin Naqvi) is the ACC president, then he will only give the trophy. If you don’t want to take it from him, how will you get a trophy?”India Cricket Board secretary Devajit Saikia condemned the PCB’s actions: “We decided not to accept the Asia Cup 2025 trophy from the ACC chairman, who represents a country currently at odds with ours. That was our stance. But this does not give him the right to take the trophy and medals. It is extremely unfortunate and unsportsmanlike. We hope the trophy and medals are returned to India as soon as possible. We will launch a serious protest at the ICC conference in Dubai this November. ”","India beat pakistan in the asia cup final in dubai.

Kevin Stefanski rejects quarterback change talk, urging teamwide responsibility immediately

Game-by-game performance shows Joe Flacco struggling to find rhythm consistently

Career statistics highlight Joe Flacco experience despite current offensive struggles

Browns offensive issues go beyond quarterback play, require whole team fixes

The Cleveland Browns suffered a 34-10 defeat to the Detroit Lions, a game that exposed struggles across the offense and highlighted Joe Flacco’s inconsistent performance. Flacco threw three interceptions, including a pick-six, underlining both his own difficulties and the team’s broader execution problems. Despite the lopsided score, head coach Kevin Stefanski is keeping Flacco in place, emphasizing that accountability must come from the entire roster rather than a single player.Flacco’s rough outing naturally sparked chatter about a potential QB change, but Stefanski remained steadfast: “I understand the question. But it’s not our focus. It’s never going to be about one person. We’re not doing a good enough job. I put myself in there as well. We have to be better.” His words reinforce a collective approach, signaling that fixes will target the whole offense, not just the quarterback.This season, Flacco has battled for consistency. In the Browns vs Lions matchup on Sept. 28, he completed 47.1% of passes for 184 yards, threw two interceptions, and posted a 39.3 passer rating. Two weeks earlier against the Packers, he went 58.3% for 142 yards, with one interception (55.6 rating).Against the Ravens on Sept. 14, he completed 55.6% for 199 yards, throwing one touchdown and one interception, while the season opener against the Bengals saw a 68.9% completion for 290 yards, one TD, two picks, and a 75.2 rating.Despite recent difficulties, Flacco’s career totals are notable: 46,512 passing yards with 259 touchdowns and a 61.6% completion rate. His tenure across the Ravens, Broncos, Jets, and Browns has seen passer ratings often above 80, reflecting his ability to perform at a high level even when individual games don’t go perfectly.The Lions exposed systemic issues, pressuring Flacco consistently and forcing hurried throws. Protection breakdowns and timing errors magnified turnovers, showing that the team’s challenges are systemic. Stefanski’s insistence on shared accountability underscores that improvement must come across the entire offense, not just through one player’s performance.The Browns now face the task of converting reflection into results. With Flacco’s experience, the team has tools to stabilize, but success hinges on clean execution, sharper protection, and better decision-making. Stefanski’s backing signals continuity at quarterback, but the offense must deliver quickly to remain competitive and rebound from the 34-10 loss.Also read: Rookie Jalen Cropper steps into the spotlight to lead Cowboys’ offense during CeeDee Lamb’s absence","The cleveland browns suffered a 34-10 defeat to the detroit lions.

LeBron James enters 23rd NBA season after Los Angeles Lakers decline extension, forcing him to exercise his player option

LeBron James weighs retirement as L.A. Lakers grant him full control over his farewell journey

The 2025–2026 season will soon begin. Amidst all the excitement, the fresh rumors suggest that LeBron James might be retiring soon. The Los Angeles Lakers allegedly declined to re-sign the star this past summer. James attempted to sign an extension, but his team did not back his initiative during the offseason, according to Bleacher Report's Yaron Weitzman.The Lakers reportedly rejected LeBron James' request for an extension this summer, thus he was forced to exercise his player option. Yaron Weitzman said in the same article that James was reportedly certain that he wanted to extend his contract with the Los Angeles Lakers.Earlier this year, though, things did not turn out as planned. He was allegedly forced to exercise his $52.6 million player option as a result. One NBA source familiar with the situation said:“He obviously wanted an extension, and it's also clear that the Lakers wouldn't give it to him.”The news was further announced on X by Lake Show Yo and read:“LeBron James reportedly wanted an extension from the Lakers, but they weren't interested this summer, forcing him to pick up his player option, per @YaronWeitzman.”The Lakers appear to have made the decision to let James make his own decisions going forward. During a recent press conference, Lakers general manager Rob Pelinka , stated,""The first thing we want to do in terms of LeBron and his future is just give him absolute respect to choose his story with his family in terms of how many years he's going to continue to play.He's earned that right, and he's the best one to talk about that.""Towards the end, Pelinka added,""We would love if LeBron's story would be to retire as a Laker. That would be a positive story.""Having exercised his 2025-2026 player option, the final season of a two-year, $104 million deal with a no-trade clause, the winger will start his 23rd season in the league. The 21-time All-Star guided the Los Angeles Lakers to the third seed in the Western Conference during last season. This news, though, implies that the Lakers might reportedly lose the NBA legend.Meanwhile, Lakers officials have recently referred to LeBron's retirement plans and his future within the organization in a press conference. The comments suggested that LeBron is contemplating the next chapter in his life beyond basketball. Fans and commentators have been talking about this news a lot, with many voicing support and worry for LeBron's possible choice.Although he hasn't made a decision on his retirement date, the Lakers organization has granted him complete autonomy over his last decisions and whether or not he wishes to end his career as a Lakers player. James apparently intends to follow in Kobe Bryant 's footsteps and retire rather than follow in Michael Jordan's footsteps and move out of the team slowly.Bleacher Report's NBA writer Yaron Weitzman interviewed several league executives who are also close to James. They discussed with James the importance of storylines, his desire to avoid a quiet retirement like Michael Jordan, and his expectation of a farewell tour like Kobe Bryant . Nevertheless, having said that, he hasn't announced an official date as of yet.Also read: LeBron James’ wife Savannah James shares quirky details in her trending social media video",Lebron james will start his 23rd season in the nba with the los angeles lakers.

The Pittsburgh Penguins have reportedly trimmed their training camp roster, reducing it by at least 15 players.

This move is a part of the annual process of narrowing the field heading into the preseason and regular season. Let’s take a look at who made it into the list for this season of Penguins. The Pittsburgh Penguins have reduced their training camp roster by at least 15 players this season. The announcement was made by the President of Hockey Operations and General Manager, Kyle Dubas, on Saturday. The Penguins have occasionally assigned their players to the junior squads, such as Quinn Beauchesne and Travis Hayes, but haven’t had a mass cut of players from their 2025 training camp.According to the Penguins, “The following players have been assigned to Wilkes-Barre/Scranton’s training camp (AHL), which begins on Monday, September 29 at the UPMC Lemieux Sports Complex: Raivis Ansons, David Breazeale, Tommy Budnick, Kyle Criscuolo, Brayden Edwards, Zach Gallant, Max Graham, Brent Johnson, Jordan Kaplan, Gabe Klassen, Daniel Laatsch, Brett Murray, Maxim Pavlenko, Emil Pieniniemi, and Zach Urdahl.These players will begin their camp on September 29, 2025, at the UPMC Lemieux Sports Complex.

Two weeks ago, the Penguins signed Fleury to a Professional Tryout Contract (PTO) so he could play one last game in Pittsburgh.He is expected to play Saturday’s preseason game against the Columbus Blue Jackets. According to reports, he spent time in practice on Friday to play against the Columbus Blue Jackets.Meanwhile, the Penguins' President of Hockey Operations and General Manager, Kyle Dubas, stated, ""The entire Penguins organization is honored to welcome Marc-Andre Fleury back to the ice in Pittsburgh. This past year, everyone witnessed how beloved and respected Marc is in the game of hockey, but the adoration goes beyond his accolades and career.He further said, “Marc means so much to our team, our fans, and the City of Pittsburgh because of the person he is and the example he sets. The Penguins feel he and his family are most deserving of this opportunity to celebrate this full-circle moment back where it all started in front of the black and gold faithful.""","The pittsburgh penguins have reportedly trimmed their training camp roster, reducing it by at least 15 players.

Heated press conferences: How India and Pakistan went at each other in Asia Cup 2025

India captain Suryakumar Yadav made a heartfelt gesture after leading his side to the Asia Cup 2025 title, announcing that he would donate his entire match fees from the tournament to the Indian armed forces The skipper also did not mince words in expressing his disappointment with the Asian Cricket Council (ACC) for denying the champions their trophy despite a hard-fought campaign.“I think this is one thing I have never seen. Since I started playing and following cricket, a champion team being denied a trophy. That too a hard-earned one,” Suryakumar said after India’s five-wicket win over Pakistan in the final at the Dubai International Stadium.India remained unbeaten throughout the tournament, defeating Pakistan thrice, including in the final. But the absence of the trophy presentation left a sour note amid the celebrations.“For me, the real trophies are sitting in the dressing room — my 14 teammates and the support staff. They are the reason we won this title. Still, a team winning a hard-fought tournament and not getting a trophy is something I have never seen,” he added.On the off-field developments, the Indian captain said it did not affect his captaincy.""I feel it was not that difficult. The boys took it in their stride. They were really happy with the way the campaign was going.""Since day one I have been telling them only one thing: Let's just focus on cricket on the ground. And when we go to the practice sessions, let's enjoy what we are doing. Do the same things that we want to do in the game.""I think the boys took it in a positive way. I feel unbeaten in the tournament, the boys stepped up whenever needed. I think those are the small moments, small trophies, which we won going forward into the World Cup year.""And as I said earlier also, I have never seen this — a team winning a hard-earned tournament and not getting a trophy. We can't say we were disappointed. But if you see, we had a lot of smiles on our faces as we were on the ground enjoying the moment on the podium,"" he said.The India skipper also opened up about his own batting form, brushing aside talk of being “out of form.”“I don’t think I am out of form; I am out of runs. I believe in my preparations. In matches, things go on autopilot. God is watching, and if you keep doing well, everything comes on time,” he said.Capping off his press conference with a surprise announcement, Suryakumar revealed: “As a gesture, I want to donate my match fees from all the games in this tournament to the Indian Army . I don’t know if people will call it controversial, but for me, it’s the right thing to do.”","India captain suryakumar yadav reveals he will donate his match fees from the asia cup 2025 to the indian armed forces.

Heated press conferences: How India and Pakistan went at each other in Asia Cup 2025

As it happened:

Poll Do you believe Pakistan's batting collapse cost them the Asia Cup final? Yes, definitely No, India performed better It's hard to say Other reasons affected the match

Amidst all the drama off the pitch, cricket finally had the last laugh on the last day of the Asia Cup as the final between India and Pakistan went down to the wire.There is a saying that an India versus Pakistan match is not for the faint-hearted, and Sunday's contest proved that belief.Riding on the crafty bowling of Kuldeep Yadav (4/30) and a gritty unbeaten knock by Tilak Varma (69 off 53), India beat Pakistan by five wickets to win the 2025 Asia Cup at the Dubai International Stadium.India started as favourites, while Pakistan were cornered as underdogs. But Pakistan put on a spirited performance and, at multiple stages, had the match in their grasp.Sahibzada Farhan’s blistering 38-ball 57 gave them a flying start, but they collapsed like a pack of cards, losing nine wickets for just 33 runs. Pakistan also had an ideal start with the ball, removing the in-form Abhishek Sharma , Shubman Gill, and the out-of-form Suryakumar Yadav inside the powerplay, leaving India reeling at 20/3.It was a two-paced surface, and as Pakistan head back to Lahore on Monday, they will rue their batting collapse, which kept India in the game.The reigning T20 world champions held their nerves and registered another gritty win in this tournament.Chasing a tricky target, India overcame a shaky start to finish the powerplay at 36/3 before Tilak Varma’s composure, Sanju Samson’s important cameo, and Shivam Dube silencing his critics first with the ball and then with the bat steered India home.Pakistan were all over India at the start. The tone was set when Abhishek Sharma, who had been in red-hot form all tournament, fell cheaply for the first time. After punching a four through cover-point with a defensive stroke that raced away, he perished in single digits to Faheem Ashraf’s clever slower ball. Faheem celebrated animatedly as Haris Rauf clung onto a sharp catch at mid-on. Shubman Gill soon departed as well, miscuing another to the same fielder.Tilak Varma then walked in under pressure and made a statement. In the final over of the powerplay, he launched Faheem for a six and four in quick succession, breaking the shackles with fearless strokeplay. But India suffered another setback when Sanju Samson, dropped once by Hussain Talat, couldn’t capitalise and fell for 24, edging to backward point against Abrar Ahmed.From that point, India’s innings hinged on Tilak’s measured aggression. He mixed caution with calculated risks, slog-sweeping Abrar for six and piercing the gaps with crisp back-foot punches. His 41-ball fifty was a testament to his growing maturity on the big stage.Alongside him, Shivam Dube — who had struggled for timing throughout the tournament — finally found his range. A boundary through extra cover off Rauf gave him confidence, and soon he was clearing the ropes with his long levers, hammering Abrar for a six and punishing Rauf’s misfired yorker with a towering hit over cow corner.Pakistan’s tactics came under scrutiny as Salman Ali Agha turned to pace after spinners had kept things tight. Once Haris Rauf came on, India plundered runs aplenty. His pace-on approach backfired on a slow surface, with Tilak and Dube feasting on predictable lengths. The over that went for 13 against Dube summed up Pakistan’s missed trick—pace on this wicket was easier to hit, while spin posed the real challenge.By the time Tilak and Dube were done, India had transformed a precarious position into a platform. Their partnership not only rebuilt the innings but also shifted the momentum decisively, leaving Pakistan ruing another tactical lapse in a high-stakes match.Dube scored a fine 22-ball 33 before falling while trying to hit a six off the last ball of the 19th over against Pakistan’s best bowler of the night, Faheem Ashraf, who returned impressive figures of 3/29.It was fitting that Rinku Singh, who came in for the injured Hardik Pandya, hit the winning runs.Earlier, after being put into bat, Pakistan endured one of their most dramatic implosions in recent memory, crashing from 113/1 in 12.4 overs to 146 all out. Farhan’s fluent fifty had set them up for a formidable score, but India’s spinners — and Bumrah at the death — engineered a ruthless turnaround.Varun Chakravarthy removed Farhan for 57, sparking a chain reaction. Kuldeep, who was expensive early on, returned brilliantly to dismiss Saim Ayub and later tore through the middle order, finishing with 4/30. Axar Patel chipped in with key strikes, including Mohammad Haris and Hussain Talat, while Fakhar Zaman’s dismissal left Pakistan reeling. From a position of control, Pakistan slumped to 126/4 and then 134/8, undone by reckless strokes and India’s relentless spin choke.Bumrah applied the finishing touches, nailing his yorkers to remove Haris Rauf and Mohammad Nawaz. Pakistan’s innings ended in 19.1 overs, their final nine wickets tumbling for 33 runs.What had promised to be a challenging total turned into a modest one, the result of poor shot selection and India’s disciplined bowling. That, in effect, helped India seal the title in the end, their ninth continental triumph.","India beat pakistan by five wickets to win the 2025 asia cup in dubai.

Heated press conferences: How India and Pakistan went at each other in Asia Cup 2025

Poll Do you think the trophy controversy overshadowed India's victory? Yes, it detracted from the win. No, the win is what matters most.

India’s Asia Cup triumph over Pakistan on Sunday night in Dubai was overshadowed by unprecedented drama after the final whistle. The presentation ceremony turned chaotic when Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman and Asian Cricket Council (ACC) president Mohsin Naqvi allegedly walked away with the winners’ trophy, leaving the stage empty and fans stunned.India, who had just beaten Pakistan by five wickets, refused to accept the silverware from Naqvi. Players reportedly informed organisers beforehand that they would not step on stage if the PCB chief attempted to hand over the trophy.Speaking after the incident, BCCI secretary Devajit Saikia congratulated the team but made his protest clear over the post-match controversy. “My first reaction is that BCCI is extremely happy and we congratulate Indian cricket team for defeating Pakistan, hands down, at the group stage, at the Super 4, as well as in the final. All three matches were one sided and we congratulate our players as well as the support staff for bringing a lot of glory to our country. We are very proud of our team and they have excellently delivered on the cricket pitch,” Saikia said.He used the opportunity to link the victory to a larger sense of national pride, saying, “Our armed forces have delivered in the border area. Now the same thing has been repeated in Dubai.So this is an excellent moment, a momentous occasion for Indian cricket.”On the cash reward, Saikia confirmed what awaits the players following the win in the final. “We are very happy and they have done an extremely good job on the ground, defeating Pakistan 3-0. And there was absolutely no resistance. All the matches were one sided. So we have decided that there will be a cash reward to the Indian team, which will be 21 crores. It will be distributed among the players and all the support staff. ”But his strongest words were reserved for the trophy controversy. “In fact, we have decided not to take the trophy from the ACC chairman, who happens to be one of the leaders of Pakistan. But that does not mean that the gentleman will take away the trophy with him along with the medals. So it is very unfortunate, very unsporting and we hope that the trophy and the medals will be returned to India as soon as possible.”Saikia confirmed that a formal complaint will follow. “This is definitely we are going to do. There is an ICC conference in the first week of November in Dubai. In the next conference, we are going to launch a very serious and very strong protest against the act of ACC chairperson,” he stated.Even as off-field controversy stole the spotlight, the final itself had moments of brilliance. Kuldeep Yadav’s 4/30 broke Pakistan’s middle order after Sahibzada Farhan (57) and Fakhar Zaman (46) gave them a promising start. Bowled out for 146, Pakistan left India with a modest chase, which Tilak Varma (69 not out) and Shivam Dube (33) finished with a composed 60-run stand.Saikia stressed that the victory was in line with India’s sporting policy, adding, “Actually, BCCI from the very first day, we have followed the spirit and the policy formulated by the Government of India regarding all games, cricketers were no exception. When it is a bilateral tournament, India is not going to play against Pakistan or any other hostile country. And BCCI has been doing it for the last 12 to 15 years… But today, with this handsome win over Pakistan and the thumping victory of 3-0, I am sure we will bring a lot of happiness to our people. The country is really proud of the performance of Indian cricket team.”He summed up with a simple note, exclaiming, “Yes, absolutely. I follow your statement that everything is well that ends well.”",India beat pakistan by five wickets in the asia cup final in dubai.

Heated press conferences: How India and Pakistan went at each other in Asia Cup 2025

NEW DELHI: Dubai roared in blue on Sunday night as India clinched their record-extending ninth Asia Cup title with a five-wicket victory over arch-rivals Pakistan — and the Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) wasted no time in rewarding the champions. Soon after the win, the board announced a massive Rs 21 crore prize money for the players and support staff, celebrating yet another milestone in Indian cricket’s glittering history.""3 blows. 0 response. Asia Cup Champions. Message delivered. 21 crores prize money for the team and support staff,"" the BCCI posted on X, underlining both the dominance and the significance of the triumph.On the field, it was Tilak Varma who starred with an unbeaten 69 off 53 balls. Calm under pressure, the 22-year-old anchored India’s chase of 147 with a match-winning 60-run stand alongside Shivam Dube. Despite India slipping to 20/3 and later 77/4, Varma held his nerve, striking three fours and four sixes before finishing the game in style with Rinku Singh , who hit the winning boundary.Earlier, Kuldeep Yadav ’s spell of 4-30 triggered Pakistan’s collapse from a commanding 113/1 to 146 all out in 19.1 overs. Sahibzada Farhan’s 57 and Fakhar Zaman’s 46 gave Pakistan early momentum, but the Indian wrist-spinner ripped through the middle order, including three wickets in a sensational 17th over.The atmosphere was as charged off the field as on it. From Jasprit Bumrah mimicking Haris Rauf’s earlier gesture after bowling him out, to yet another match without handshakes between the two teams, the clash reflected the political and sporting tensions surrounding the rivalry.For India, however, the night was about celebration.

Micah Parsons gears up for an emotional revenge game against the Cowboys

Cowboys’ season already facing early pressure in a stacked NFC East

Sunday Night Football in Week 4 brings one of the most dramatic matchups of the 2025 NFL schedule, as Micah Parsons and the Green Bay Packers (2-1) head back to Dallas to face the Cowboys (1-2). The game is more than just another early-season contest — it’s Parsons’ highly anticipated return to the team that abruptly traded him just before the season began.When Green Bay shipped Parsons out of Dallas at the end of August, the move shocked the NFL . Now, barely a month later, he gets the chance to line up against his old teammates under the national spotlight.Parsons had a quiet outing last week against Cleveland, logging just two tackles and a pair of quarterback hits. Still, the Packers’ defense largely did its job, limiting the Browns to 221 yards. Against his former team, though, Parsons will have extra motivation to make his presence felt.For Green Bay, the bigger concern lies on offense. Quarterback Jordan Love was sacked five times in last week’s 13-10 loss to the Browns, while managing just 183 passing yards with one touchdown and one interception. If the Packers want to spoil Parsons’ Dallas homecoming, they’ll need sharper execution against a Cowboys defense that has been leaky through three games.Dallas enters Sunday night desperate for a win after dropping two straight. They have not beaten Green Bay since 2016, and a third straight loss would further damage their chances in a competitive NFC East, where the Eagles remain unbeaten and the Commanders are 2-1.Injuries have piled up at the worst time. Star wideout CeeDee Lamb is sidelined for three to four weeks with an ankle injury, and rookie guard Tyler Booker is expected to miss up to six weeks with the same issue. On defense, the Cowboys have already allowed 92 points this season, the fifth-most in the NFL.Also Read: Puka Nacua is rewriting history as Rams’ breakout star fuels early MVP chatter Team owner Jerry Jones made it clear the Cowboys won’t hold any tribute for Parsons, but his shadow still looms large.

Puka Nacua delivers another career night to keep Rams rolling

Breaking records while redefining the Rams’ offense

The NFL MVP award has long been the territory of quarterbacks, but Los Angeles Rams wide receiver Puka Nacua is forcing his way into the conversation after a sensational first month of the 2025 season. While history says a wideout won’t win the award, Nacua’s dominance has made him the league’s most impactful player so far.In the Rams’ 27-20 victory over the Indianapolis Colts on Sunday, Nacua delivered a monster performance: 13 catches, 170 yards, and a fourth-quarter touchdown that tied the game. It was his career-best regular-season showing and another example of why Los Angeles sits at 3-1 instead of 0-4.Through four weeks, Nacua has racked up 42 receptions for 503 yards and 52 rushing yards, leading the league in both catches and receiving yards. What makes the numbers more impressive is that he’s managed them despite twice leaving games due to injury before returning to finish strong.The last player to reach 500 receiving yards in his team’s first four games was, remarkably, Nacua himself in 2023. Now, he’s become the first player in NFL history to accomplish that feat twice.Nacua’s importance goes beyond numbers. “The Rams are 3-1, and not 0-4, because of Puka Nacua.Even more so than they are because of Matthew Stafford,” wrote Kenneth Arthur of SB Nation, highlighting how the young star is carrying the offense.Often viewed as the quarterback who elevated great receivers like Calvin Johnson and Cooper Kupp, Stafford now appears to be the one benefiting from Nacua’s consistency. The second-year receiver is versatile, catches nearly everything thrown his way, and has become Stafford’s unquestioned top target.If he maintains this pace, Nacua could threaten NFL single-season records for receptions and receiving yards, potentially becoming the league’s first-ever 2,000-yard receiver. That type of production would put him squarely in the MVP conversation—even in a league where a quarterback has claimed the honor in 17 of the last 18 years.Also Read: Lamar Jackson injury update: Baltimore QB’s setback highlights Ravens’ 1-3 start after loss to Kansas City History may suggest a wide receiver won’t win, but the early months of the season have made one thing clear: the most valuable player in football right now is not a quarterback.
