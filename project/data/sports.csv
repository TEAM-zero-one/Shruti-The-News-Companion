How “Tweaker” Became a Cultural Phenomenon

GELO - Tweaker (Official Video)

Tweaker 's Chart Domination and Viral Impact on Fans

How LiAngelo Ball Went From Basketball to Music Trailblazer

LiAngelo Ball’s transformation from overlooked basketball prospect to music industry headliner has officially reached a historic milestone. His debut single “Tweaker,” released under the stage name Gelo, has achieved platinum status - an achievement that puts him in the same conversation as heavyweight artists like Drake . For an athlete-turned-musician, this level of success is both unprecedented and culturally significant, signaling a genuine crossover moment that few have ever achieved.This accomplishment not only redefines LiAngelo’s public identity but also marks the peak of a rapid rise that began in early 2025. From a player often overshadowed by his brothers Lonzo and LaMelo Ball, LiAngelo has carved out an entirely new lane, proving that his artistic instincts and musical ambition were far more than a curiosity.Released in January 2025, “Tweaker” exploded online almost instantly. Its nostalgic, bouncy beat - powered by piano, organ keys, and lush synth pads - captured the spirit of early-2000s hip-hop. Paired with Gelo’s melodic, sing-song delivery and a catchy “whoa” hook reminiscent of Big Tymers-era anthems, the track resonated widely. Produced by Kunica and Glockie Cheez, the song painted a picture of luxury, swagger, and newfound fame, creating an irresistible vibe that appealed to both younger listeners and fans of classic hip-hop aesthetics.Its momentum grew even stronger as the song spread into sports culture.NBA and NFL teams, including the Detroit Lions, Chicago Bulls, and Cleveland Cavaliers, embraced “Tweaker” as a celebratory anthem in locker rooms and warm-up sessions, pushing its reach far beyond the usual music circles.The success of “Tweaker” eventually led to a massive $13 million record deal with Def Jam and Universal Music Group. The contract included an extraordinary $8 million guaranteed signing bonus—more than what many current NBA players earn annually. This landmark deal solidified Gelo’s credibility and marketability within the hip-hop and R&B world.Adding even more momentum, a high-profile remix featuring Lil Wayne elevated the track’s status, giving it a stamp of approval from one of rap’s most influential figures.“Tweaker” made history by reaching No. 1 on the US Rhythmic Billboard chart - an exceptional feat for a debut single from a former basketball player. The song sparked viral dance trends across social platforms and earned praise from artists like T-Pain, Lil Yachty, and Joe Budden. Its appeal spanned music, sports, and online culture, cementing LiAngelo Ball as 2025’s breakout music star.Before his rise in music, LiAngelo Ball spent years navigating international basketball leagues and the NBA G-League. Eventually, he stepped away from the sport entirely - a decision validated by his explosive success. His debut album League of My Own, released in July 2025, showcased his evolution as an artist and reaffirmed his place in the industry.LiAngelo Ball’s platinum achievement for “Tweaker” is more than a win for himself - it is a defining cultural moment. By stepping into music and dominating charts, he has written a rare success story that bridges athletics, entertainment, and mainstream culture.","Liangelo ball’s debut single “tweaker,” released under the stage name gelo, has achieved platinum status.

Philadelphia 76ers Injury Report vs the Milwaukee Bucks (November 20, 2025)

Theenter tonight’s matchup against the Philadelphia 76ers facing a major setback, as they will be without their franchise cornerstone. The anticipation surrounding this Eastern Conference meeting was already high, with both teams dealing with significant injuries, but thechanges the tone of the contest entirely. Fans expected a high-intensity duel between two playoff contenders, yet the spotlight now shifts to how each side adjusts without key contributors.This matchup was also meant to serve as an early-season measuring stick for both squads. The Bucks have been working to build chemistry under Doc Rivers while navigating depth challenges, and the 76ers are trying to stay competitive amid injury turbulence of their own. But with Giannis officially out, Milwaukee’s offensive and defensive systems will undergo their toughest test of the season so far.Giannis Antetokounmpo will not be available tonight as he recovers from a low-grade left groin strain suffered during a recent game against the Cleveland Cavaliers. The injury occurred in the second quarter, after which he did not return, prompting immediate concern across the organization. Following evaluations and consultations with the medical staff, head coach Doc Rivers confirmed that Giannis is expected to miss roughly one to two weeks.Losing the player who leads the team in both scoring and usage - averaging more than 31 points per game - creates a massive void for Milwaukee.Giannis’ impact extends beyond offensive production; his presence anchors the Bucks’ pace, rim pressure, transition attack, and interior defense. His absence naturally forces the team to rework rotations and identify new offensive initiators.With Giannis Antetokounmpo sidelined, Bobby Portis is expected to take on an expanded role. Historically, Portis has thrived when stepping in for the former MVP, boosting his scoring, minutes, and physical presence on the court. However, Milwaukee’s depth issues extend beyond Giannis: Taurean Prince remains out due to neck surgery, and Kevin Porter Jr. is unavailable following right knee surgery. These combined absences strain the team’s flexibility and reduce Rivers’ lineup options.Also read: Philadelphia 76ers vs Milwaukee Bucks regular season game: Full injury report, who's out, and more (November 20, 2025) The 76ers enter the game with their own health setbacks. Kelly Oubre Jr. is out for at least two weeks because of a knee sprain, while Joel Embiid is listed as doubtful as he continues managing knee discomfort. Even with these injuries, Philadelphia still retains a more stable core for tonight’s matchup compared to Milwaukee, given the magnitude of losing Giannis Antetokounmpo.","Giannis antetokounmpo will not be available tonight as he recovers from a low-grade left groin strain suffered during a recent game against the cleveland cavaliers.

Japanese slugger Kazuma Okamoto ready to make impact

Pitcher Kona Takahashi brings rotation depth and Japanese craftsmanship

It is a historic moment for baseball in Japan. With that, two of the best developed talents in Japan, Kazuma Okamoto and Kona Takahashi, have been posted for the Major League Baseball market and are now able to negotiate with clubs in the U.S.The dual posting is certainly a step forward in international baseball relations, as it highlights the increased prominence of Japanese players around the world. Each being an elite talent with wide-ranging skills and plenty of success in Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB), their arrival could change the upcoming player segment of MLB free-agency. Both players now enter a critical 45-day window to secure MLB deals, after which they would return to their Japanese clubs if unsigned.At 29, Okamoto is seen as one of the premier power hitters in Japan. Since 2014, he's been mostly a corner infielder with the Yomiuri Giants, where he's hit 248 home runs in 1,074 games total, including six seasons in a row of 30 or more homers from 2018-23. Despite injuries constraining him to 69 games in '25, he turned in a superb. 327 batting average with a .598 OPS – showing his bat is still quite potent.Because he can play either end of the infield, Okamoto is not only one of the most powerful bats available in free agency but also one of the most flexible, something most MLB rosters will always be in the market for.His experience and production make him one of the most sought-after players on the international market this offseason.Takahashi, a right-handed starter from the Saitama Seibu Lions, brings a solid pitching resume with him into this posting. He's also sustained more than 1,500 innings of tough work through 2022-23 seasons with a 2.20 ERA and 1.13 WHIP in 330⅔ innings. His numbers did fall off a bit in 2024 and 2025, with ERAs in the low-3. Scouts think of him as a solid mid-rotation option with added potential, still, in the 00s range.His style emphasises command and precision rather than overpowering velocity, an approach that could translate well in MLB if managed carefully. Takahashi presents some good value for the clubs that are going to want solid starters without shelling out for top-shelf arms.Okamoto & Takahashi jointly highlight how Japanese baseball churns Major League-ready talent at the highest levels. Yes, their posting this year adds another layer of strategy and urgency to MLB's international market, and teams that act quickly to lock them down can obtain an unparalleled competitive advantage next season.Also Read: MLB trade rumors: Bo Bichette declines Blue Jays' qualifying offer for 2026 as Toronto braces for a pivot","Kazuma okamoto and kona takahashi have been posted for the major league baseball market.

Her message made it clear that she did not agree to this and wanted it removed.But instead of deleting the video, @Chris_HorrorYT answered another user who called the clip “flattering.”He replied, “Thank you!!!!” and even added a GIF of Vince McMahon. This reply made the situation worse because it looked like he was proud of the fake clip.Many fans online said the video crossed a line because it changed a normal meeting into something false. WWE fans also pointed out that wrestlers already deal with many tough fan situations, and this adds more stress. The video also stayed up all week, even after AJ Lee clearly told him to delete it.Wrestling fans on X/Twitter kept asking the fan to take the clip down and respect AJ Lee’s wishes.

Aaron Rodgers eyes return against Bears after Wrist injury, Adam Schefter confirms

Steelers’ Aaron Rodgers won’t need surgery on fractured wrist | Pro Football Talk | NFL on NBC

Aaron Rodgers’ past battles with Bears adds extra motivation for Steelers match



Aaron Rodgers’ return for Sunday’s showdown against the Chicago Bears remains uncertain after he suffered a broken wrist in last week’s 32-14 win over the Cincinnati Bengals. The 41-year-old four-time NFL MVP is determined but cautious, aware that rushing back too soon could aggravate the injury. Adam Schefter reveals Rodgers is pushing to practice and hopes to take the field, a potential boost for the Steelers as they aim to maintain their position in the division standings.Despite the injury, Rodgers’ drive to play is high. Now leading the Steelers’ offense, he brings veteran leadership and experience to Pittsburgh. Sunday’s matchup against Chicago carries extra significance, offering Rodgers a chance to write another memorable chapter in his legendary career while facing one of the NFL’s most historic rivalries.Rodgers injured his non-throwing wrist late in the first half against Cincinnati when he rolled to his left and landed awkwardly. While it’s not his throwing wrist, he must be able to protect himself and handle the ball safely to be cleared. Rodgers could return to practice as early as Thursday, with Steelers coach Mike Tomlin highlighting Friday as a crucial day for deciding the starting QB. “As for Aaron Rodgers, a big test today,” ESPN’s Adam Schefter said.“He plans to try to practice despite the fact that he has a fracture in his left wrist. We’ll see how that practice goes. Clearly didn’t practice yesterday. Wants to play on Sunday in Chicago. Has been pushing to play.”If Rodgers cannot play, Mason Rudolph is prepared to step in. Rudolph has excelled in previous appearances, posting a QB rating near 120 and helping Pittsburgh stay competitive. He’s ready for any scenario, drawing on past experiences to handle a sudden start. The quarterback room remains upbeat, with Rodgers offering support and guidance, helping maintain focus and cohesion ahead of Sunday’s matchup.Rodgers’ motivation to return goes beyond the Steelers’ playoff push. The 41-year-old four-time MVP has a long history with Chicago, having clashed memorably with the Bears throughout his Green Bay career. “There’s incentive for every opponent, but I have enjoyed many Sundays, Mondays, and Thursdays in that city,” Rodgers said. “It’s a great sports town, phenomenal fans, and a great place to play.” This experience adds another layer of significance to Sunday’s game, even as he navigates recovery from a broken wrist.Rodgers’ return would strengthen the Steelers’ playoff aspirations while testing his recovery from a broken wrist. Pittsburgh’s offense hinges on his leadership, and his performance against the Bears could define the team’s push in the NFL’s competitive division, adding another milestone to Rodgers’ storied career.Also Read: Isaiah Rodgers subtly mocks with $17K penalty comment on Isaac Rochell’s reel after Allison Kuch reacts to Ja’Marr Chase’s $507K fine","Aaron rodgers could return to practice as early as thursday.

Jason Kelce shares solution for Jalen Hurts, Eagles reported issues

The Eagles are in the running for the No. 1 seed after beating the Detroit Lions. At 8–2, the Eagles are tied for the NFC’s best record as they try to defend their Super Bowl crown. But despite their strong start, the team has faced constant reports of internal issues. Star receiver A.J. Brown is reportedly frustrated with his reduced role in an offense that has been under constant scrutiny. Needless to say, some of that frustration has been directed at quarterback Jalen Hurts, whose numbers are good overall but who has struggled at times to consistently feed the team’s top weapons.Jason Kelce, who spent his entire 13-year career with the Philadelphia Eagles, recently opened up about his unhappiness over what he’s hearing about the Eagles this season.After their trip to the Super Bowl in 2022, the Eagles’ 2023 season was full of escalating tensions and even talk that coach Nick Sirianni could be fired. That team exited in the wild-card round, only to rebound and win the Super Bowl the following year.That chaotic 2023 season was also the final one for longtime centre Jason Kelce. Now, it goes without saying that the 2025 squad is showing some similar warning signs. Kelce went on local station SportsRadio 94WIP to talk about what the Eagles can do to fix things inside the locker room.“I think the quotes on Jalen—I think there are frustrations on a team that build up continually. I think Jalen gets a lot of the highlighting of that because he’s the quarterback,” Kelce said. “... This is part of being part on a team, there are so many ups and downs.”Kelce then got emotional while recalling a story about how he and Eagles right tackle Lane Johnson didn't speak for an entire offseason because of a fight they had.""Me and Lane Johnson, one year, at the end of Chip Kelly's career, Lane made a comment in the media and said something along the lines of, 'The up-tempo offense is way too hard on us in practice and we're working too difficult and guys are getting fatigued.' And I remember reading that... and I went out and said something in the media and said, 'What does Lane know? Lane's only been with the Philadelphia Eagles. How does he know what it feels like to do other practices? He's only practiced with Chip Kelly. ..'""Lane then made another comment. Lane and I didn't talk for an entire offseason. Lane is like one of my best friends. Like, I love that guy. And this is part of being on a team. There are so many ups and downs... this thing brings out emotions and sides of people because you all want to win so bad...""Kelce used this reference to address what the Eagles can do to move forward. He added that the only way the Eagles can solve the issues is by being accountable and talking about it.He said, “I think by and large, the body of work Jalen has put out there, you can’t deny, in my opinion. I think you need to continue to work through this and be accountable and maintain these relationships in a healthy way.”Also Read: More coverage from the NFL","Jason kelce shares some solutions for eagles' issues.

Charlie McAvoy Injury takes a slap shot to the face | Boston Bruins vs Canadiens 2025 Highlights

Charlie McAvoy’s injury situation sidelines Boston Bruins' defense





The Boston Bruins enter a challenging phase of their season with star defenseman Charlie McAvoy officially sidelined for an indefinite period. His injury comes at a time when the team was building momentum in the Eastern Conference. Also, making the setback particularly difficult for head coach Marco Sturm’s group. McAvoy’s strong start to the season had been instrumental in Boston’s early success.The 27-year-old was injured during Boston’s 3-2 win over the Montreal Canadiens when he was struck in the face by a powerful slap shot from Noah Dobson. McAvoy was taken to a hospital immediately and later underwent facial surgery. The Bruins quickly confirmed that he would not return anytime soon, creating a major gap on their blue line.Head coach Marco Sturm shared that McAvoy is currently recovering at home but remains without a clear timeline for return. “He’s doing good, but we still don’t know how long he’s going to be out,” Sturm told reporters. With McAvoy out indefinitely, the Bruins must rely heavily on other defensemen to maintain stability in their defensive structure.McAvoy had recorded 14 assists in 19 games and led the Boston Bruins in ice time.And, averaging over 23 minutes per game. His ability to drive play and anchor the defense makes his absence one of the most significant losses Boston could face. Without him, players like Hampus Lindholm and Nikita Zadorov. Also, now shoulder increased responsibilities on the back end.Compounding McAvoy’s injury is Boston’s growing list of sidelined players. This including Elias Lindholm, Viktor Arvidsson, Casey Mittelstadt, and Jordan Harris.As the Bruins push forward in a competitive Atlantic Division, McAvoy’s absence will test their resilience, and the team now looks to stay afloat. While awaiting further updates on their top defenseman’s recovery.Also Read: Will William Nylander play against the St. Louis Blues tonight?

Adam Lowry signs five-year, $25M contract as Jets secure captain for future



Adam Lowry’s future with the Winnipeg Jets is officially locked in, and the timing couldn’t be more strategic. The Jets captain signed a five-year, $25 million contract extension on Wednesday, eliminating any uncertainty around his future just months before he was set to hit unrestricted free agency. The move showcases Winnipeg’s trust in Lowry’s leadership, work ethic, and ability to anchor the team at critical moments, especially with the franchise chasing long-term consistency.Despite missing the first 12 games of the season due to hip surgery on May 27, the 32-year-old forward has quickly made his presence felt since returning to action on November 4, recording three points (one goal, two assists) in seven games. His resilience, coupled with a standout 2023–24 campaign where he posted a career-high 16 goals along with 18 assists in 73 appearances, makes the timing of the deal even more significant. At $5 million average annual value, the Jets have successfully retained an experienced two-way center without heavily impacting their salary cap structure.Lowry’s extension serves as more than just a financial agreement—it represents a tactical step toward preserving locker room stability and competitive intensity.As captain, he brings grit, physicality, and defensive accountability, traits that often prove essential in tightly contested playoff matchups. Since being selected by Winnipeg in the third round (No. 67) of the 2011 NHL Draft, Lowry has accumulated 276 points (122 goals, 154 assists) in 782 regular-season games and 24 points across 62 postseason appearances.For Lowry, the extension offers long-term security and solidifies his status as a foundational piece within the organization. For the Jets, it ensures continuity at center and reinforces a leadership core capable of guiding younger talent. With the franchise aiming to remain a competitive playoff contender, securing their captain signals a long-term vision built around on-ice resilience and locker room influence.As Winnipeg prepares for the stretch ahead, this move underlines their commitment to internal development rather than short-term fixes. With Lowry set to lead the charge over the next five seasons, the Jets have taken a clear step toward building sustainable success through seasoned leadership and on-ice consistency.Also Read: Sharks’ Macklin Celebrini breaks NHL records: Teen star ranks alongside Wayne Gretzky, Sidney Crosby and Mario Lemieux","Winnipeg jets captain adam lowry signs five-year, $25m contract extension.
