It was once a gentle, afternoon pastime. But, for an increasing number of players, making up words on a board is a serious pursuit — for which they crisscross the country and even go abroad, writes Avijit Ghosh

In a chandelier-lit basement of a south Delhi hotel, a bunch of men and women across 30 tables are focused on a board game that seems gender-neutral and age-agnostic. A 10-year-old fourth-grader squares off with a 60+ English professor, and a retired civil servant duels with a young businesswoman. The players take notes, challenge words and, much like chess, press a game timer.But it’s the frequent clatter, much akin to a rattlesnake clicking its tail, that gives the roomy arena its buzz and the game its signature. It’s the sound of the tile bag being jiggled and shaken; that is where consonants and vowels are stored, and from which match-winning words are formed. Welcome to the serious world of competitive Scrabble — once a gentle afternoon pastime, it is now a sharp strategic sport that receives little media attention.Early last month, though, the scenario changed, albeit briefly, when Madhav Gopal Kamath, a class 10 student from Delhi (see box), became the first Indian to win the 2025 World Youth Scrabble Championship. “People were astonished to know Madhav was just 14 years old,” says Harry Bhatia, president, Scrabble Association of India (SAI).Scrabble was invented by unemployed American architect Alfred Mosher Butts during the Great Depression, which haunted the US in the 1930s. While the exact year it arrived in India is fuzzy, senior citizens from English-aware homes recall relishing the game or its variants in childhood.“What we do know is that it emerged as a competitive sport in the mid-1990s in Hyderabad,” says Mohan Chunkath, 69, India’s first national champion. Since then, the sport has gained ground. Scrabble clubs are active in Bengaluru, Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Goa, Hyderabad, Pune, Vadodara, Kochi, with Kottayam the latest addition. From around 60-odd players in the 1990s, India has about 400 registered players now, says Bhatia. Players are ranked and rated on performance. The Chennai-based Chunkath says he was the lone player to represent India at the Melbourne world championship in 1999. That number now has gone up to six-eight.There are more young players on the scene. Vihaan Singhvi, a class 10 student from Jaipur who was part of India’s youth team, learnt the sport from his aunt. “Jaipur doesn’t have too many offline players. I mainly play online,” he says. His sister, Khanak, just 6, is a promising Scrabbler. So is Noida-based Dahlia Verma, 12, who has represented her school at an international inter-school meet.Nine-time national champion Sherwin Rodrigues says domestic tournaments have doubled since he started competing in 2005. “Currently, we have about 10-12 three-day tourneys,” he says, “plus a clutch of one-dayers, making it a packed domestic calendar.”A team-based Scrabble League is also scheduled in Lonavla next month. The KSSA Indian Open, a four-day international meet, will be held in Bengaluru next Jan. Corporates, too, are slowly coming on board, pun intended. “Kids are even putting Scrabble in their college resumes,” says Bhatia. “We are forming more state associations to boost the game’s infrastructure,” he adds.Scrabble is a complex mix of word knowledge, strategy, concentration and chance. Words are loved not for their beauty, but for the points they rack up. India’s top-ranked woman player, Ishika Shivalingaiah, used “roneoed”, in Delhi last week. The word is ‘playable’ and means ‘duplicated’.In the past too, she has used words that would stump most of us. “Gyttja”, for one, which means a fine-grained, high-organic-matter sediment, or, just, “Shh” — to silence someone. The validity of a word can be ‘challenged’. But Scrabble has its own DRS, the all-knowing umpire: the Collins Scrabble Word List, a constantly growing dictionary.Ishika and other Scrabblers also point out that the game is about much more than just employing high-scoring ‘playable’ words to create a “bingo”, the term for any seven-letter word that fetches an extra 50 points. Which is why, as Chunkath points out, the best players are not literature professors, but mathematicians, computer programmers and musicians. “They follow patterns,” he says.Good players practice one-two hours daily. “They must be good at tile-tracking, which means being aware of the letters already played and those yet to come,” says Vihaan. Rack management, balancing vowels and consonants, is another key skill, he says.Nonetheless, an element of randomness is integral to Scrabble. “You have no control over the tile (letter) fished out of the bag,” says Chunkath. But there’s a general consensus that while luck can be critical in a single match, it mostly evens out in tournaments, where every player plays about 25 matches. Attentiveness, too, is vital when you are playing eight games per day, each lasting 50-60 minutes.Simply put, a combination of word knowledge, strategy and attentiveness outdoes the role of chance. “Nigel Richards of New Zealand, the current world champion, is the best because his strategy is unmatched,” Madhav says.Like chess, volleyball and basketball, defence, too, is integral to Scrabble. You play in a way to maximise your own points, but you also block your opponent from piling them up. Madhav recalls being tested in Malaysia against Nigeria’s Abdulqudus Aliu Olawale, who had bested him on previous occasions.“My style is open and high-scoring; He is defence-oriented, a master in limiting the opponent’s scoring opportunity,” Madhav explains. “I had to adapt by becoming a blocker myself.” It was a tight encounter, but Abdulqudus ran into time trouble and Madhav prevailed.Anjana Meira Dev, 61, who teaches English in Delhi’s Gargi College, says Gen Z players are sharper strategists and memorise more. “They can make words they don’t know the meaning of. Which is legal. But we never did that. They also anticipate bingos better,” she says. “They play Scrabble like T20. For us, it is Test cricket,” says Anjana, who started playing when she was six.These days, players also use technology to improve their game. Ishika uses a web app, ‘aerolith’, which offers a fast way to learn words and woogles.io, a free, non-profit online platform for word gamers, which also analyses matches, including the best possible choices you could have made. Madhav refers to a word tool, zyzzyva.Players have taken to Scrabble for different reasons and ended up being its devotees. Ishika, a 43-year-old consultant at PWC, was a former chess player who had sparred against the likes of Tania Sachdev and Harika Dronavalli. She got interested in the word game after participating in a corporate event five years ago. What chess couldn’t give her, Scrabble did: major success.For hotelier Ritu Chadha, the game has been like meditation, her ‘no-mobile time’. “It works like an antidepressant for me,” says Ritu, also treasurer, SAI.Many Scrabblers, like her, are working professionals. Money is invested in, rather than taken out of the game. Prize money is low, sponsors rare, plane tickets and hotel bills footed individually. “Every time, I tell myself I am not doing this anymore. But I end up doing it again,” says Ritu. Then she smiles and says, “I guess I am addicted.” Most tournaments last three days. “Expenses roughly work out to Rs 25,000 for each of them,” says Rodrigues, who plays about five of them every year. The India No.2 won the Delhi Scrabble Open last week and pocketed Rs 20,000. The cost-benefit ratio doesn’t add up.Yet Scrabble thrives, not on prize money, but passion. And, one carefully placed letter at a time.is potentially the highest scoring word in Scrabble. It can net up to 1,778 points, won the World English-language Scrabble Players Association (WESPA) title in 2017. He had represented Bahrain thenMadhav Gopal Kamath’s first memory of Scrabble is watching a game and pointing out how the player had missed out on the word, ‘aediles’, the plural for magistrates in ancient Rome. He had seen his father use the word a fortnight before that and remembered. He was five.The boy could remember well even before he had properly begun to read. When four, he learned the names of 80 dinosaurs from flashcards. “From a very young age, he could concentrate well. We knew he was gifted,” says his entrepreneur father, Sudhir.By the time he was eight, Madhav would occasionally beat Sudhir. “But in the last two years, it has been eight out of 10,” he says. Sudhir is ranked 28 in Scrabble Association of India’s latest official ratings. Madhav is India No.3 — and No.1 among juniors.The Class 10 student of Delhi’s Sanskriti School has bigger plaudits to his name, though. When he became the world youth champion in Malaysia last month, he also pocketed a cash prize of $1,000. He is also the national champion. His ambition is to be world champ. “But I have a long way to go,” he says.“What makes Madhav special is his ability to stay cool under pressure, which is crucial during end games,” says Neeta Bhatia, who was coach and team manager at the Malaysia event.In the Scrabble Association of India (SAI) magazine, Endgame, Madhav spelt out a small list of dream playable words back in Sept 2021. Two of them were: “Caziques” and “Mbaqanga”. Do you know what they mean?","For an increasing number of players, making up words on a board is a serious pursuit.

Carter Hart’s next chapter with the Golden Knights





Golden Knights stand by their decision





Carter Hart is officially back in the NHL , and the Vegas Golden Knights have secured a goalie who once held the spotlight in Philadelphia. The 27-year-old goaltender has signed a professional tryout contract (PTO) with the team, setting the stage for a mid-season return. After months away from the league, Hart is ready to prove himself once again, telling the Las Vegas Review–Journal, “I’ve learned a lot. I’ve grown a lot. I’m ready to move on. I’m excited to get out in the community and show my true character.”Though Carter Hart’s comeback has drawn mixed reactions from fans, his talent is undeniable. Vegas expects him to strengthen an already formidable goaltending room alongside Mitch Marner. While Hart won’t be eligible to play until December 1, the team has ample time to get him back into top form. The Golden Knights could debut him against the Chicago Blackhawks on December 3, or perhaps schedule a dramatic return in Philadelphia on December 11. Either way, expectations are high for a goalie eager to leave past struggles behind.Hart’s career with the Flyers saw highs and lows. Drafted 48th overall in 2016, he amassed a 96-93-29 record with a 2.94 goals-against average and a .906 save percentage, including six shutouts.Yet his last NHL outing in January 2024, where he allowed five goals against the Colorado Avalanche, left fans questioning his consistency. Now reinstated by the NHL and signed for a PTO with Vegas, Hart has a chance to redefine his legacy.Vegas faced criticism for bringing Hart aboard, but the organization emphasized their commitment to core values. A team statement highlighted alignment with the NHL and NHLPA’s process, noting, “We remain committed to the core values that have defined our organization from its inception and expect that our players will continue to meet these standards moving forward.” With a fresh start and clear support, Hart’s journey with the Golden Knights promises to be both closely watched and deeply compelling.Hart’s story is one of resilience, growth, and the pursuit of redemption. As the calendar flips to December, all eyes will be on him to see if he can recapture the form that once made him a rising star in the NHL.Also Read: Connor McDavid leads the way as Oilers rookie Matt Savoie reveals candid thoughts on playing with NHL legends","Carter hart is officially back in the nhl with the vegas golden knights.

Why This Trade Could Work for Both Teams

Key Trade Implications

Theare reportedly exploring a blockbuster move that could redefine the franchise’s future. According to Fansided’s Matt Moore, the team may consider parting ways with long-time defensive anchor Draymond Green to acquire- a player with a massive $175 million contract and generational talent.After a quiet offseason, the Golden State Warriors ’ biggest addition has been veteran forward Al Horford, making them one of the oldest teams in NBA history. Despite that, the front office remains confident that Stephen Curry can still lead the franchise to another deep playoff run.The organization is reportedly waiting until midseason to determine whether this current roster can keep pace with the Western Conference elite. If they prove competitive, major trade talks could intensify before the deadline.“You fundamentally reshape your entire future instead of trying to sneak out one more title. It buys you time to reconfigure and extend your success and avoid a post-Steph rebuild,” Matt Moore said Monday. (H/t: Sporting News)Moore’s statement highlights what could be a defining moment for Golden State - choosing between loyalty to its core and building for the next era.Moore’s trade scenario involves the Golden State Warriors sending several key assets to Milwaukee in exchange for Giannis Antetokounmpo This trade would mean Golden State parting with a franchise icon and its young depth - a steep price even for a two-time MVP. However, pairing Giannis with Curry could immediately catapult the Golden State Warriors back into title contention.The addition of stretch big men like Quinten Post and Al Horford gives the Golden State Warriors more spacing than in previous seasons, allowing Giannis to dominate inside without clogging the floor. His explosive playstyle could perfectly complement Curry’s perimeter shooting, creating one of the most dynamic duos in NBA history.For Milwaukee, the move represents a potential reset. The Bucks have struggled recently despite Giannis’s brilliance, and a package featuring young talents like Moody and Podziemski, along with multiple first-round picks, offers a clear path toward rebuilding.• For the Warriors: A chance to extend their championship window beyond the Curry era• For the Bucks: Long-term assets and flexibility to reshape their roster• For Draymond Green: The possible end of a legendary run with Golden StateTrading Draymond Green - a four-time champion and defensive cornerstone - would be one of the toughest decisions in franchise history. Yet as Moore points out, “You can’t justify moving one of your franchise icons for almost any player. Giannis is not just any player.”Should the trade be completed, it would both end an era and start a new one centered on Giannis Antetokounmpo and Stephen Curry. Additionally, it would be remembered as one of the most significant moves in NBA history.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Golden State Warriors Could Limit $8.6 Million Star’s Minutes as Veteran Core Takes Priority in New Season The Golden State Warriors’ front office faces a defining test this season: stay loyal to a proven core or risk it all for a once-in-a-generation superstar.

Who is Shannon Kobylarczyk?



Milwaukee Brewers 'Karen' Fired By Employer After 'Racist' Rant Against LA Dodgers Fan Goes Viral

Exploring Shannon Kobylarczyk's controversy



Did Shannon Kobylarczyk lose her job?



What did MLB say about the Shannon Kobylarczyk controversy?



The Milwaukee Brewers’ National League Championship Series clash with the Los Angeles Dodgers took a sharp turn off the field when a video from Game 2 went viral for all the wrong reasons. A heated exchange between Brewers fan Shannon Kobylarczyk and Dodgers supporter Ricardo Fosado turned into a national talking point after Kobylarczyk was seen making a racially charged remark. Within days, she lost her job, resigned from a charitable board, and was banned from American Family Field.Shannon Kobylarczyk, a Milwaukee-based attorney, worked at ManpowerGroup, a global staffing firm, and also served on the Make-A-Wish Wisconsin board of directors. Until last week, she was largely unknown outside professional circles. That changed during Game 2 of the NLCS on October 14, when she became the center of an online firestorm.The game, played in Milwaukee, had started as a typical postseason battle — the Brewers took an early lead before the Dodgers surged ahead. Amid the excitement, Fosado, a Los Angeles fan and U.S. Navy veteran, began recording the crowd’s reaction after a Dodgers home run.In his clip, Kobylarczyk can be heard mocking him, yelling, “Real men drink beer, p***y!” Moments later, she tapped another fan and said, “You know what, let’s call ICE. ”Fosado, calm but defiant, replied, “Call ICE. Call ICE. I’m a U.S. citizen, war veteran, baby girl. War veteran, two wars. ICE is not gonna do nothing to me. Good luck.”The exchange escalated, leading to Fosado’s removal from the stadium after Kobylarczyk reported him to security. However, the story didn’t end there, it was only beginning.The viral video, viewed more than 2 million times, quickly drew outrage online. Many criticized Kobylarczyk for using an anti-immigrant remark, especially toward a Latino veteran. The Brewers soon confirmed that both fans were banned from American Family Field due to “offensive statements” and “physical confrontation.”In a statement, the team said, “The Brewers expect all persons attending games to be respectful of each other, and we do not condone in any way offensive statements fans make to each other about race, gender, or national origin.” They emphasized their commitment to maintaining a “safe and enjoyable experience” for all fans.The fallout was swift. ManpowerGroup announced that Kobylarczyk had been placed on leave and later terminated. “As soon as we became aware of this video the individual was placed on immediate leave and we began an investigation,” the company said. “As a result of this process, the employee is no longer with the organization. We remain committed to maintaining a culture grounded in respect, integrity, and accountability. ”She also resigned from Make-A-Wish Wisconsin’s board. The nonprofit confirmed, “Shannon Kobylarczyk resigned from our board of directors this afternoon effective immediately. Make-A-Wish Wisconsin does not condone nor agree with Kobylarczyk’s words and actions.”Major League Baseball and the Brewers shared that such behavior violates league standards. The Milwaukee Police Department also became involved, citing Fosado for disorderly conduct and intoxication, though he wasn’t charged. Both fans, the Brewers said, are barred “from returning to the ballpark for future events.”Interestingly, Fosado himself showed grace toward Kobylarczyk despite the confrontation. Speaking to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, he said, “I don’t think it was like horrible or something that should get her fired. I feel bad for her. We cannot be judged on one mistake, and a lot of emotions were involved.”For Fosado, the night ended on a surprisingly positive note. “This is my first time at a Brewers game and I got kicked out, but you know what? I had a great experience and everybody was really friendly and welcoming,” he said.The viral moment dubbed Kobylarczyk “Brewers Karen” online.Also Read: Brewers 'Karen' fired after viral video identifies her as Shannon Kobylarczyk in racist rant at Dodgers supporter and U.S. war veteran","Shannon kobylarczyk, a milwaukee-based attorney, worked at manpowergroup, a global staffing firm.

"NFL trade deadline 2025 rumors: Eagles reject A.J. Brown calls, Saints extend Olave, Titans ready to sell and more",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/nfl-trade-deadline-2025-rumors-eagles-reject-a-j-brown-calls-saints-extend-olave-titans-ready-to-sell-and-more/articleshow/124677127.cms,"NFL trade deadline buzz: Which teams are gearing up to buy or sell according to Dianna Russini

Saints want to keep Chris Olave long-term not trade him

Titans open to trading nearly everyone except Jeffery Simmons and rookie QB Cam Ward

Eagles shopping for EDGE and cornerback help but A.J. Brown isn’t going anywhere

Jets, Dolphins, and Bengals fielding calls on big defensive names



Chiefs, Cowboys, and Jaguars hunting for defensive reinforcements

The NFL trade deadline is still a little way off, but insider Dianna Russini just turned the volume up with her latest scoop. According to her post on X, front offices across the league are already in overdrive, from the Saints working on a long-term deal with Chris Olave to the Titans reportedly willing to move nearly everyone not named Jeffery Simmons. Add in the Eagles searching for defensive reinforcements and the Chiefs quietly shopping for linemen, and you’ve got all the makings of a spicy trade season ahead.Forget the trade chatter, the New Orleans Saints reportedly want to keep Chris Olave in black and gold for years to come. Russini noted that the Saints and Olave are trying to work out a long-term extension ahead of schedule, which makes perfect sense given his early production. Olave, still on his rookie deal, has been one of the team’s few bright spots in an otherwise inconsistent offense. This move signals that New Orleans is doubling down on building around its young star instead of shopping him at the deadline.Over in Tennessee, the Titans appear ready to clean house. According to Russini, they’re open to trade discussions on almost everyone except star defensive tackle Jeffery Simmons and rookie quarterback Cam Ward.After several seasons of middling results and roster churn, Tennessee looks ready to rebuild around Simmons’ dominance in the trenches and Ward’s potential as the team’s new face. Expect calls to keep coming in on veteran assets as they reshape the roster.In Philadelphia, Russini reports that the Eagles are working the phones for help at EDGE and cornerback, a classic Howie Roseman move as the team eyes another postseason run. But here’s the key line: they’ve rejected all calls on star receiver A.J. Brown. That’s no surprise. Brown is a core part of Philly’s offensive identity, and the team’s defense has been its main area of concern this season.Elsewhere in the AFC, phones are buzzing. Russini says the Dolphins have received calls about edge rushers Bradley Chubb and Jaelan Phillips, while the Jets are getting interest in running back Breece Hall and linebacker Jermaine Johnson. Neither team seems eager to deal, but it shows how high those players’ values are league-wide. Meanwhile, the Bengals reportedly aren’t trading Trey Hendrickson, ending speculation that their top pass rusher could be on the move. It’s a smart call, Cincinnati can’t afford to lose its defensive anchor as they fight for playoff positioning.Russini also noted that Kansas City is shopping for defensive linemen, though not for a running back signaling confidence in their current backfield. The Cowboys and Jaguars are similarly searching for defensive upgrades to solidify their playoff chances. Add in Detroit reportedly looking for an edge rusher and Indianapolis eyeing help at cornerback, and you get a clear theme: contenders are gearing up for the second half of the season, and defense is the name of the game.If Dianna Russini’s thread is any indication, the 2025 NFL trade deadline could be pure chaos. Teams like the Saints and Eagles are locking in stars, while others like the Titans and Chiefs are wide open for business. As the deadline approaches, expect rumors to swirl, deals to heat up, and a few blockbuster surprises that no one sees coming. It’s shaping up to be a wild couple of weeks in the NFL.Also read - Dolphins vs. Browns Week 7 faces hurricane-level winds and nonstop rain prediction","The nfl trade deadline is still a little way off, but insider dianna russini just turned the volume up with her latest scoop.

How Mike Evans’ Hamstring injury could impact Buccaneers vs. Lions in week 7



Balancing performance and health: Mike Evans’ role in Buccaneers’ key matchup



Todd Bowles on Mike Evans Returning to Practice | Press Conference | Tampa Bay Buccaneers

Tampa Bay Buccaneers fans are eagerly awaiting the return of star wide receiver Mike Evans as the team prepares to face the Detroit Lions on Monday Night Football. After missing three weeks due to a hamstring injury, Evans’ expected Week 7 return is a major boost for the Bucs’ offense, but it comes with significant injury concerns.Evans sat out Friday’s practice as part of a planned recovery but is expected back on the field Saturday, putting him on track to play against Detroit. Despite this, medical experts, including social media doctor Deepak Chona, warn of a “high re-injury risk,” which is common with hamstring injuries. Such injuries are delicate and can easily flare up if the player is pushed too hard too soon.The timing of Evans’ return is critical. With teammates Chris Godwin and Emeka Egbuka sidelined, Evans is likely to carry a heavier workload immediately. Unlike a gradual return, he will have to perform at full intensity from the start, increasing the likelihood of another hamstring issue. For Evans, maintaining his streak of 1,000-yard seasons is a top priority, adding pressure to his comeback.Tampa Bay’s receiving depth further highlights Evans’ importance. Without him, the Bucs may have to rely on Sterling Shepard, Tez Johnson, and Kameron Johnson as their top receivers, a scenario that could hinder the team against a strong Detroit defense.Evans’ presence ensures the offense remains competitive and gives quarterback the reliable target needed for high-pressure situations.The Buccaneers face a delicate balance between immediate performance and long-term health. Evans’ return could turn the game in their favor, but careful management is essential to prevent setbacks that could impact the rest of the season. Monitoring his snap count, route assignments, and overall performance will be critical to ensure he handles the workload without aggravating his hamstring.Mike Evans’ anticipated return on Monday Night Football is a key storyline in the NFL, emphasizing both the high stakes of player health and the impact of star talent on team success. For Tampa Bay, having Evans back could be the difference between a win and a tough loss, making this Week 7 matchup one of the most-watched games of the season.Also Read: Justin Herbert and Madison Beer: 2025’s Hottest new couple striking the perfect balance everyone’s talking about","Mike evans set to return for buccaneers vs lions despite hamstring risk.

NEW DELHI: Virat Kohli ’s love affair with Australia is no secret, and his return to the Indian jersey adds extra intrigue to the first ODI of the three-match series starting Sunday at Optus Stadium, Perth. The series also marks the comeback of Rohit Sharma , as both Indian stalwarts will be seen in action for the first time since lifting the ICC Champions Trophy earlier this year.After completing a practice session on Saturday, Kohli took time to interact with fans, signing autographs and clicking pictures with a group of eager supporters. During the session, a few Australian fans were reportedly commenting and laughing at him. Without uttering a word, Kohli’s piercing stare silenced them, displaying the intensity that has defined his career.Kohli’s childhood coach, Rajkumar Sharma, said the star batter has nothing left to prove in international cricket, noting his exceptional record and contribution to Indian cricket. ""Virat doesn't have to prove anything, he has achieved everything, the way he has played, the way he has won the matches for the country, everyone knows his contribution. He is well prepared, and whenever he is well prepared, the results are always good, and I have full faith that he will do well as usual,"" Sharma said.This marks Kohli’s first outing in the Indian jersey since March 9, when India lifted the Champions Trophy.Watch the video here He had been expected to return to the Test format for India’s tour of England for the inaugural Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy, but instead chose to retire from Tests, ending a remarkable 14-year-long journey.Debates continue over how Kohli will handle Australia’s fast-paced pitches and whether this three-match ODI series might be his last appearance Down Under.

Poll Should international cricket teams reconsider touring countries with a history of violence? Yes, safety first No, cricket should promote unity Depends on the current situation

Cricket is a sport that unites millions across the world. However, it has occasionally been marred by violence and terror. From targeted attacks on players to cross-border airstrikes, the game has witnessed moments of shock that shook the global cricket community.During the second Test in Lahore, masked terrorists targeted the Sri Lankan team bus en route to the Gaddafi Stadium. Captain Mahela Jayawardene and deputy Kumar Sangakkara, along with Ajantha Mendis, Thilan Samaraweera, and Tharanga Paravitarana, sustained minor injuries.The attack claimed the lives of six security personnel and two civilians. The Test was immediately called off, and the tour was canceled. This marked the first time sportsmen were specifically targeted since the 1972 Munich Olympics, highlighting the severe risks teams can face abroad.A suicide bomb outside the Pearl Continental Hotel in Karachi forced New Zealand to abandon their Pakistan tour. While players were unharmed, physio Dayle Shackel received minor injuries.ICC referee Mike Procter said, “Due to the security situation, the tour has been called off after mutual consultation between the PCB, NZC and the Black Caps team manager Jeff Crowe.”PCB Director Brig Munawar Rana added, “This indeed is unfortunate for our country and our cricket... but this incident really was beyond our control.”Following a cross-border airstrike in Paktika province, Afghanistan withdrew from a tri-nation T20 series with Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Three young cricketers – Kabeer, Sibghatullah, and Haroon – were killed, along with five civilians.Captain Rashid Khan called the attack “absolutely immoral and barbaric,” while Mohammad Nabi said, “This incident is not only a tragedy for Paktika but for the entire Afghan cricket family and the nation as a whole.”The ICC and BCCI condemned the incident and sided with the Afghanistan Cricket Board following the shocking incident.","Over the years, a number of incidents have marred what has otherwise been a sport that unites millions across communities.

NEW DELHI: Rohit Sharma etched his name in cricketing history on Sunday, playing his 500th international match for India during the first ODI against Australia in Perth. At 38, he became only the fifth Indian to reach this remarkable milestone, joining legends Sachin Tendulkar, Virat Kohli MS Dhoni , and Rahul Dravid. Globally, Rohit is the 11th player to achieve 500 international appearances.Rohit’s illustrious career spans all three formats, featuring 273 ODIs, 67 Tests, and 159 T20Is. He also holds the record for the most T20I appearances for India, highlighting his impact in the shortest format. On the all-time list of international matches, Sachin Tendulkar leads with 664 games (463 ODIs, 200 Tests, 1 T20I), followed by Mahela Jayawardene (652), Kumar Sangakkara (594), and other cricketing greats like Sanath Jayasuriya, Ricky Ponting, Virat Kohli, MS Dhoni, Shahid Afridi, Jacques Kallis, and Rahul Dravid. Rohit’s 500 matches firmly place him among the elite of world cricket.Beyond this milestone, Rohit is chasing another record—the most sixes in ODI cricket. With 344 sixes, he sits just seven short of Pakistan’s Shahid Afridi, needing only eight more to become the leading six-hitter in men’s ODIs.Rohit has also enjoyed tremendous success in Australia, scoring 990 runs in 19 matches at an average of 58.23, including four centuries and two fifties.Crossing 1,000 runs in Australia during this series would make him the first Indian to achieve the feat on Australian soil.His leadership record is equally impressive. Rohit led India to the 2024 T20 World Cup title before retiring from the format, and then captained the team to the 2025 ICC Champions Trophy triumph. Earlier this year, he also announced his retirement from Test cricket, closing a remarkable chapter in the longest format of the game.Australia have won the toss and opted to field. After 223 long days, Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli are finally back in action for India, bringing their experience and firepower to the top of the order. All eyes will be on the two veterans as they step onto the field under Shubman Gill’s captaincy, marking the start of a fresh chapter in Indian ODI cricket.","Rohit sharma played his 500th international match for india during the first odi against australia in perth.
