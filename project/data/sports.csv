Adapting to a single home venue has been tough for some teams, but the Rajasthan Royals (RR) have a double challenge ahead. After starting their campaign in Guwahati, they are set to return to the Sawai Mansingh Stadium in Jaipur nearly three weeks into IPL 2025 , looking to recover from an uneven start.They’ll be facing the Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) today (April 13) afternoon, who are in remarkable form on the road. RCB achieved notable away victories: defeating the Mumbai Indians (MI) at Wankhede for the first time in a decade, beating Chennai Super Kings (CSK) at Chepauk after 17 years, and overcoming the defending champions, Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR), at Eden Gardens.On the road, RCB boast of impressive numbers: averaging 39.6 runs per wicket and scoring at a rate of 10.5 runs per over. In contrast, their home average drops significantly to 22.1 and 8.3, respectively. Their bowling has also been effective away, with an average of 21.2 compared to a higher 56.4 at home.Although they had some time to adjust during previous travels this season, they face a quick turnaround now, having played just two nights ago against the Delhi Capitals (DC).The challenge for the curators at Sawai Mansingh Stadium would be to ensure the surface isn't too dry under the searing Jaipur heat, especially for a day game.Rajasthan Royals predicted lineup: Yashasvi Jaiswal, Sanju Samson(c), Nitish Rana, Riyan Parag, Dhruv Jurel(w), Shimron Hetmyer, Wanindu Hasaranga/ Fazalhaq Farooqi, Jofra Archer, Maheesh Theekshana, Tushar Deshpande, Sandeep Sharma, Kumar KartikeyaRoyal Challengers Bengaluru predicted lineup: Philip Salt, Virat Kohli, Devdutt Padikkal, Rajat Patidar(c), Liam Livingstone/ Jacob Bethell, Jitesh Sharma(w), Tim David, Krunal Pandya, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Josh Hazlewood, Yash Dayal, Suyash SharmaYashasvi Jaiswal, Sanju Samson(w/c), Nitish Rana, Riyan Parag, Dhruv Jurel, Shimron Hetmyer, Shubham Dubey, Jofra Archer, Maheesh Theekshana, Tushar Deshpande, Sandeep Sharma, Fazalhaq Farooqi, Kumar Kartikeya, Yudhvir Singh Charak, Kunal Singh Rathore, Akash Madhwal, Kwena Maphaka, Wanindu Hasaranga, Ashok Sharma, Vaibhav SuryavanshiPhilip Salt, Virat Kohli, Devdutt Padikkal, Rajat Patidar(c), Liam Livingstone, Jitesh Sharma(w), Krunal Pandya, Tim David, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Josh Hazlewood, Yash Dayal, Suyash Sharma, Rasikh Dar Salam, Manoj Bhandage, Jacob Bethell, Swapnil Singh, Lungi Ngidi, Romario Shepherd, Nuwan Thushara, Mohit Rathee, Swastik Chikara, Abhinandan SinghRoyal Challengers Bengaluru and Rajasthan Royals have a close head-to-head record. In the 32 IPL matches between them, RCB have won 15 and RR have won 14 with three ending without an outcome.In IPL 2024, RR did a double over RCB. The reverse was true in IPL 2023 where RCB triumphed in both their games. Go back to IPL 2022 and there was a third clash between these two, in the playoffs, where RR had come out top.The temperature in Jaipur is expected to be unforgiving for the players in the day game (3:30pm IST start). The mercury is expected to reach as high as 37-38 degrees Celsius with no rain to offer respite.","Royal challengers bengaluru (rcb) face rajasthan royals (rr) at sawai mansingh stadium in jaipur.

A goal for the ages: Alex Ovechkin breaks Wayne Gretzky's 26-year record



FULL Alex Ovechkin Celebration Ceremony After Record-Breaking Goal No. 895

A legacy passed down: Anastasia Shubskaya receives diamond tribute from Janet Gretzky



After Alex Ovechkin netted his 895th career goal and broke legendary Wayne Gretzky 's record, Janet Gretzky showed respect to a time-honored hockey tradition by gifting Anastasia Shubskaya , wife of Alex Ovechkin, an eight-carat diamond ring that had been estimated at $280,000. The Capitals may have lost to the New York Islanders by a score of 4-1, but the outcome was an afterthought to a night all about legacy, love, and a new chapter in hockey's history.The moment of history arrived at 7:26 of the second period. Alex Ovechkin let go of a blazing shot through fellow Russian Ilya Sorokin, making himself the NHL's all-time leading goal scorer. Fans inside UBS Arena lost their minds, and Alex Ovechkin commemorated the occasion by executing a belly flop onto the ice—celebrating his big achievement.Alex Ovechkin celebrated this achievement in a pregame ceremony against the Carolina Hurricanes on April 10, 2025. He was given a six-foot sculptural painting by TYP depicting his skates and game-used sticks, with his image on it, with “Most Goals All Time” written on the top and “895 Alex Ovechkin 895” on the bottom.While Alex Ovechkin was absorbing the enormity of his achievement, Anastasia Shubskaya was gifted a symbolic token of the historic night. Continuing a tradition started in 1994, when Colleen Howe (wife of Gordie Howe) gave Janet Gretzky a diamond ring after her husband, Wayne Gretzky, broke Colleen Howe’s husband’s record, Janet Gretzky ensured history repeated itself—this time from one hockey family to another.In an interview with the media, Wayne Gretzky said, “A month ago, my wife said, ‘You know, Colleen Howe started a tradition. I’m not sure if anyone is going to break Alex’s record, but I want to give her (Ovechkin’s wife, Anastasia Shubskaya) something really unique.’ So, we went out and she picked out an eight-diamond ring for Alex’s wife. Not only do hockey guys pass down traditions. So do the families and wives.”The act not only spanned generations of greatness but also underlined the strong relationship between hockey families across generations.Anastasia Shubskaya, who tied the knot with Alex Ovechkin in 2016, is a Russian model who has appeared in numerous Russian magazines during her career and has built a strong social media presence. They are proud parents of two sons- Sergei and Ilya.Also read: “Now the real stuff is coming”: Alex Ovechkin skips The Tonight Show appearance to stay playoff-ready Even though the Capitals fell on the evening, the larger context is one of hope.

Sunrisers Hyderabad secured an impressive eight-wicket victory against Punjab Kings in a high-scoring IPL match at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Hyderabad on Saturday.

Alex Ovechkin's tribute night ruffles feathers among Washington Capitals fans



Ovechkin Makes History, Capitals Make It Special!

Wayne Gretzky's Rolls-Royce comment creates unrealistic expectations



Alex Ovechkin finally broke Wayne Gretzky's record of 894 goals, and he is now the NHL's all-time leading scorer. The Washington Capitals superstar was honoured with a touching ceremony amidst thousands of cheering fans. But while the franchise lavished gifts and accolades on Alex Ovechkin and his family with the finest luxuries, some fans were left feeling disappointed, particularly following Wayne Gretzky's suggestion of a Rolls-Royce gift that created greater expectations.The Washington Capitals threw everything at their disposal into celebrating Alex Ovechkin's record-breaking accomplishment. The 39-year-old forward, who spent 15 games out of the lineup with a broken leg this season, still broke the NHL all-time goal record.President of Hockey Operations Brian MacLellan gave Alex Ovechkin a full-sized golden hockey stick—engraved and constructed as a one-of-a-kind commemorative piece. The star's sons, Sergei and Ilya Ovechkin, accepted miniature versions of the same stick, while Ted Leonsis distributed luxury watches—Rolexes for Ovi and his mother, and a Cartier for his wife, Anastasia Shubskaya.And to top it all off, the Capitals revealed a sculptural piece of art by Detroit artist TYP. The 6-foot work of art, puck-shaped and sporting actual casts of Ovechkin's skates and stick, brought a three-dimensional element to the tribute. While Ovechkin was visibly emotional, fans were divided in their reactions.“We were there, and the lighting made it look like it was papier-mâché, like a piñata? We thought for sure something was going to pop out. Like football kids through the banner…” a fan said.Some of the backlash came as a result of comments Wayne Gretzky made before the ceremony. “I told Mr. Leonsis, when I broke the record, they got me a Rolls-Royce. So I hope they get you something,” he said.“I really thought after the Gretzky comment that Leonsis was going to toss Ovi keys to a new Rolls-Royce,” another fan shared.Also Read: No more chasing—Alex Ovechkin’s hitting back as Capitals surge to top Alex Ovechkin, however, remained grateful. “It’s such a great moment for me, my family, and the organization, for DC.

Bill Belichick acknowledges key mistake in 2018 that impacted New England Patriots’ future,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/bill-belichick-acknowledges-key-mistake-in-2018-that-impacted-new-england-patriots-future/articleshow/120221669.cms,"Image via Imagn Images

Bill Belichick reflects on the missed opportunity that changed Patriots’s QB search

Over the course of his distinguished career, Bill Belichick crafted a formidable dynasty with the New England Patriots, solidifying his legacy as one of the NFL's all-time great coaches. Under his direction, particularly during the Tom Brady era, the Patriots were consistently in Super Bowl contention. Yet, despite his many triumphs, Belichick recently confessed to a significant mistake, one that may have had a lasting impact on the team's success.The mistake Bill Belichick referred to goes back to the 2018 season, a year that, despite ending in a Super Bowl win, was filled with behind-the-scenes tension and questionable decisions. One of the most criticized moves was his decision to sideline cornerback Malcolm Butler in Super Bowl LII. The unexpected benching sparked confusion among players and fans alike, and Belichick now admits it may have disrupted the team's chemistry.In a forthcoming book, Bill Belichick reflects on some of the choices he wishes he could revisit one of the most debated being his decision to pass on Lamar Jackson during the 2018 NFL Draft .With the 31st overall pick, the Patriots had a prime opportunity to secure a future star. Instead, they selected running back Sony Michel, while Jackson was scooped up immediately afterward by the Baltimore Ravens. Since then, Jackson has emerged as one of the league’s most explosive quarterbacks, reshaping the Ravens’ offense with his mobility and earning an MVP title along the way.Although Michel made valuable contributions most notably helping the Patriots win their last Super Bowl in the Tom Brady era his long-term impact hasn’t matched Jackson’s game-changing presence. In hindsight, Belichick admits the decision stands out even more sharply, especially given New England's ongoing search for a dependable quarterback after Brady’s exit.Since Brady’s departure, the Patriots have gone through multiple quarterbacks, none of whom have managed to bring lasting stability. Although the rise of Drake Maye has sparked optimism for what’s ahead, there’s still a strong belief that Lamar Jackson could have been the ideal solution to their quarterback struggles.Despite all of Belichick’s accomplishments over the years, passing on Jackson remains a what-if moment, one that might have completely altered the course of the Patriots’ journey in the post-Brady era.Also Read: “I don’t care, and it never ends”: Josh Berry sounds off on Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce obsession As Belichick reflects on his legacy, it's clear that even the most brilliant minds can second-guess their past decisions. While his career is filled with unmatched achievements, the choice to overlook Lamar Jackson in 2018 serves as a reminder that every draft pick can shape a franchise’s future for better or worse. For Patriots fans, it remains a lingering “what could have been” in the story of life after Brady.","Bill belichick reflects on the missed opportunity that changed patriots’s qb search.

Minnesota Timberwolves were cussed out by coach at halftime

The Minnesota Timberwolves notched an important 141-125 win over the Memphis Grizzlies on Thursday, with shooting guard Anthony Edwards playing a major role by dropping 44 points. In his postgame interview, Edwards shared how head coach Chris Finch cussed out the team at halftime, lighting a fire that helped them snatch the victory from the Grizzlies. The shift in their defensive intensity after the break was evident on the court.According to SportingNews.com, Edwards said, ""We got cussed out at halftime, especially myself, about my effort on defense, so we put emphasis on that side of the court. Gameplan mistakes, myself. I'm talking about blown gameplan mistakes, mental mistakes that I shouldn't be making in five years of experience in the league. I shouldn't make those gameplan mistakes so I gotta be better.""Beyond his honest revelation about being cussed out, Edwards was also a riot during a live interview when he playfully interrupted Minnesota star Julius Randle , shouting, ""I'm the best in the world! Go tell all the girls!"" Randle struggled to continue the interview, laughing and calling Edwards “crazy” in response to the disruption.Speaking with TNT, Edwards also revealed that his trainer sends him motivational videos of Michael Jordan for inspiration. “Hans, my trainer told me to black out tonight, so I tried to do that. We'll be watching, like, I know people are going to love this. He sent me, like, MJ videos every day about, like, blacking out. And I think MJ said something like, why would I worry about a miss if I haven't took the shot yet? So he'd be sending me stuff like that. So I appreciate him.”Also Read: Golden State Warriors regain control of playoff destiny after Memphis Grizzlies fall to Minnesota Timberwolves Thursday’s win gives the Timberwolves a stronger shot at the Western Conference playoffs, as they are now tied with Memphis in the standings.

What is Scottie Pippen's Net Worth in 2025?

Scottie Pippen has played in the NBA for 17 seasons and has six NBA Championship wins under his belt. The athlete is considered to be one of the greatest small forwards in NBA history. Additionally, his achievements include being one of the two players in history who have won an Olympic Gold Medal and an NBA title twice in the same year. After earning great fame and recognition, we are taking a look at how this has impacted his financial portfolio.According to Celebrity Net Worth, Scottie Pippen has a net worth of $20 million. This comes after playing with the Chicago Bulls for 12 seasons, with the Houston Rockets for one season and the Portland Trail Blazers for four seasons. After all the achievements and accolades, his net worth is not as high as his peers. This comes after the star is known to be one of the most underpaid players of all time. He signed a 7-year contract with the Bulls for $18 million. Thus, when the Bulls were at their peak and Michael Jordan would earn $30+ million annually, Pippen would only earn $2.6 million.However, his contract with the Houston Rockets earned him a staggering $67.2 million. Post this, when he joined the Bulls during the last two years of his career, he earned $10 million. While he has earned over $109 million over the years as an NBA player, his net worth has diminished massively.Pippen's net worth also accounted to numerous brand endorsements. He had signed a deal with Avia early in his career. Post this he had also signed a contract with Nike. Other popular brand endorsements include Frito-Lay, McDonald's, Coca Cola, Right Guard and Visa.However, bad financial decisions have dwindled his net worth to $20 million. He lost $20 million due to his financial advisor, who turned out to be a fraud. Additionally, Pippen has eight children and had to pay child support for each of them. The court had ordered him to pay half of his retirement fund from the Chicago Bulls as a divorce settlement. This also had a severe blow to his net worth. He also had to support his family of 12 siblings as his father was paralyzed due to a stroke.Also Read: Exploring the personal life of Scottie Pippen","Scottie pippen has played in the nba for 17 seasons and has six nba championship wins under his belt.

Poll Which team will win the upcoming match: CSK or KKR? KKR CSK

Are CSK making the best use of Jadeja?

CHENNAI: There was much drama in the Chennai Super Kings (CSK) camp on the eve of their must-win game against Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR). Ruturaj Gaikwad , who was hit by a Tushar Deshpande delivery in the game against Rajasthan Royals in Guwahati last week, appears to have a broken elbow.“Ruturaj has been ruled out of the rest of the IPL with a broken elbow. And now a certain uncapped player called MS Dhoni will lead us,” coach Stephen Fleming said.Gaikwad hasn’t been at his best and it will be interesting to see if CSK go back to senior player Rahul Tripathi at the top of the order or throw in one of the rookies — Shaikh Rashid or Andre Siddarth — into the deep end.Asked whether it was difficult to make Dhoni take up the captaincy again, Fleming said, “No, he understood the situation. Ruturaj didn’t want to go but it’s an unfortunate situation.”The injury complicates an already complicated situation for CSK, who have only one win out of five. Another loss here on Friday may just make the uphill road to playoffs qualification all the more difficult. But then, their opponents KKR aren’t exactly better off either.The defending champions have won only two of their five matches and it’s extremely important that they take full points here. There’s one thing, though, that may just help the Knight Riders at the MA Chidambaram Stadium — the pitch. They have complained a lot about their home pitch at the Eden, but here, their spinners might get the purchase they are looking for.For a long time, one of the centrepieces of Chennai Super Kings’ success has been Ravindra Jadeja. It was his consistency over the years that made CSK shell out Rs 18 cr to retain him. However, in the five games that CSK have played so far, it seems that their former captain has been underutilised to a degree.In none of the games did the experienced left-arm spinner get his full quota of four overs. In 13 of the 20 available overs that he bowled, Jadeja gave away 105 runs, going at an economy rate of 8.“We have six options. It’s not a set stage for anybody, we try to go according to the situation,” coach Fleming said on Thursday.Meanwhile, as a batter too, Jadeja has been limited to the role of a finisher at a time when the top order has struggled.“We really like his partnership with MS at the back end. That appeals to us,” Fleming said.",Ruturaj gaikwad has been ruled out of the rest of the ipl with a broken elbow.
