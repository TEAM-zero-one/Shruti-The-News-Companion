Shubman Gill story: From a remote village near the border to India’s Test captain

Poll Will the absence of Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli affect the team's performance? Yes, significantly No, the team is strong

FULL SQUAD:

NEW DELHI: The BCCI on Saturday announced a new-look Test squad for the upcoming five-match series against England, with 25-year-old Shubman Gill named as the new captain. The tour, which is part of the 2025–27 ICC World Test Championship cycle, will take place in England between June and August 2025, with matches scheduled at Headingley (Leeds), Edgbaston (Birmingham), Lord’s (London), Old Trafford (Manchester), and The Oval (London).This series marks the beginning of a new chapter for Indian Test cricket following the recent retirements of senior stalwarts Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli.With Rohit stepping away from Test cricket earlier this month, Shubman was widely tipped to take over the leadership role. A consistent performer in all formats and already seen as a long-term prospect, the young opener will now lead the team in one of its most challenging overseas assignments.Wicketkeeper-batter Rishabh Pant has been appointed as Gill’s deputy. India have included two wicketkeepers in the squad — Pant and promising youngster Dhruv Jurel.Star pacer Jasprit Bumrah returns to the squad after a back injury that ruled him out of action for nearly three months, including India’s victorious ICC Champions Trophy 2025 campaign.Also See: India Test Squad Announcement The 18-member squad features three prominent inclusions — Karun Nair, Arshdeep Singh, and Sai Sudharsan — all rewarded for their stellar performances in domestic cricket.This is a maiden call-up for both Sudharsan and Arshdeep.Karun, who famously scored a triple century against England in 2016, makes a comeback after last playing a Test in 2017. The right-hander was prolific in the 2024–25 domestic season, scoring 863 runs in nine Ranji Trophy matches with four centuries, and 779 runs in eight Vijay Hazare Trophy innings, including five centuries.Nair, already part of the India A setup, is expected to play a key role during the England tour.With Mohammed Shami missing out due to injury, the selectors have reinforced the pace unit. The attack will be led by Bumrah and Mohammed Siraj, and also features Prasidh Krishna, Akash Deep, Arshdeep Singh, Reddy, and Shardul Thakur — offering a mix of experience and youth suited for English conditions.In the spin department, Ravindra Jadeja and Washington Sundar have been included as all-round options, while Kuldeep Yadav has been named the lone specialist spinner.Ahead of the main series, India will play two India ‘A’ matches against the England Lions, with the first game scheduled for May 30 at the St. Lawrence Ground in Canterbury.Rohit Sharma officially retired from Test cricket on May 7, bringing down the curtain on an illustrious 11-year career. He played 67 Tests, scoring 4,301 runs at an average of 40.57, with 12 centuries and 18 fifties.Virat Kohli, too, bid adieu to the longest format earlier this month. The former India captain leaves behind a legendary legacy in red-ball cricket, having played 123 Tests and scored 9,230 runs at an average of 46.85, including 30 centuries and 31 half-centuries. He retires as India’s fourth-highest run-scorer in Tests.Shubman Gill (c), Rishabh Pant (wk/vc), Yashasvi Jaiswal, KL Rahul, Sai Sudharsan, Abhimanyu Easwaran, Karun Nair, Nitish Kumar Reddy, Ravindra Jadeja, Dhruv Jurel (wk), Washington Sundar, Shardul Thakur, Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Siraj, Prasidh Krishna, Akash Deep, Arshdeep Singh, Kuldeep Yadav.","India announce new-look test squad for upcoming five-match series against england. 25-year-old shubman gill named as the new captain.

The league, conceptualised by Hyderabad-based technocrat Suresh Paladugu, was supposed to be held across multiple cities in India, with support from various race clubs.Speaking to TOI, Paladugu, while denying any direct connection to the Jabalpur incident, said that pilots of the league were telecast at different locations across the globe, including the Philippines.""The idea was to move horse racing from betting-style to entertainment style like IPL,"" Paladugu said, adding that he approached Hyderabad Racing Club (HRC) for a stable and track for the league. ""I don't own any of the horses. They are owned, fed, and taken care of by HithaNet. My responsibility is limited to providing technical, streaming support and deal with clubs,"" he said.Sources said HithaNet decided to shift its horses to Jabalpur since the league is on hold.""Paladugu's concept couldn't attract any major sponsors. He wanted to telecast two-horse races, which would be easy to understand even for a layman, and turn it into a profitable business. That way, it could benefit local breed horses as well,"" said a source.While confirming this, HithaNet officials said they chose Jabalpur because the firm has other businesses, such as farming, there. ""Also, our lease with HRC had ended, so we needed a different place to keep our horses,"" said Pavani Gaddam, authorised signatory of the company, maintaining that all the animals were in ""good health"" at the time of being shifted. ""We transported the horses by road and followed all due processes,"" she added.When asked if the horses will be brought back to Hyderabad if HPSL is launched, she said there is no decision on it. ""It is not necessary that the horses are used only for racing. They can be used for breeding, polo, movies, etc. We can also sell them,"" Gaddam said.","The eight race horses that died allegedly due to malnutrition in jabalpur recently were trained in hyderabad to participate in an ipl-style horse racing league.

A bold comeback that highlights her fearless style

Wayne Gretzky’s daughter, Paulina Gretzky , is once again stealing the spotlight — and not just because of her famous last name. The model and social media personality recently dropped jaws with a daring, stripped-down photoshoot that celebrates confidence, authenticity, and feminine power. Fans can’t stop talking about it, and for good reason.Paulina took to Instagram to unveil a new series of intimate photos shot by Miami-based photographer Isabella Lanaro. The shoot captures her posing in nothing but a pair of blue jeans, using only her arms to cover her chest. With loose beach waves styled by celebrity hairstylist Leah Caso and minimal makeup by Joanne Marchevsky, Paulina radiates effortless beauty and confidence. Her caption for the post was simple yet telling: “undone. ”The understated caption paired with the powerful visuals signals a shift in her public persona — one that embraces vulnerability as a form of strength. It's a continuation of the bold aesthetic she previously embraced in 2020 when she shared a similarly revealing photo with the caption: “Je t’aime St. Barts.”Though she’s been in the public eye for most of her life, Paulina has been candid about her journey toward self-acceptance.In a past interview with Kind Magazine, she opened up about the pressures of being constantly scrutinized and the turning point that helped her move past that.“I was stuck in this, ‘What is Paulina Gretzky going to do?’ But like, I don’t always know and it’s OK to not know—not many of us do—but at the same time, I like who I am—I love who I am—and I’m ready to venture out now,” she said.She also spoke to the emotional toll women face from societal judgment, especially from one another. “I feel like women can be our own harshest critics... but sometimes we do it to each other. I’ve learned over time that it’s OK to be upset. Let’s just process it in a healthy way.”Also Read: Wayne Gretzky's daughter Paulina Gretzky stuns Instagram fans with bold topless photo and heartfelt support for husband Dustin Johnson With this recent shoot and her growing confidence, Paulina Gretzky is showing the world that she’s more than a celebrity daughter — she’s a woman reclaiming her identity and redefining beauty on her own terms.","Paulina gretzky took to instagram to unveil a new series of intimate photos.

Poll Should MS Dhoni retire from IPL after the 2025 season? Yes, it's time for him to hang up his boots. No, he still has more to offer.

NEW DELHI: Devon Conway and Dewald Brevis struck impressive half-centuries as bottom-placed Chennai Super Kings wrapped up their IPL 2025 campaign with a commanding 83-run victory over Gujarat Titans on Sunday. Conway, the New Zealand opener, scored 52, while South Africa’s Brevis smashed a blistering 57 off just 23 balls, powering Chennai to a formidable 230 for 5 after electing to bat at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad.Chennai’s bowlers then delivered a collective effort to bowl out Gujarat, who have already secured a playoff berth, for 147 in 18.3 overs.Despite the victory, Chennai bowed out of the tournament with just four wins from 14 games, prompting fresh speculation about the future of veteran MS Dhoni , who took over the captaincy midway through the season after Ruturaj Gaikwad was sidelined with an injury.All attention shifted to Dhoni during the post-match presentation, where he shared his thoughts on the game and his future.""It's good. I won't say it was houseful today. We didn't have a good season, it was one of those perfect performances. We haven't caught very well, but the catching was good today. It depends,"" Dhoni said.""I have 4-5 months to decide, there's no hurry. Need to keep the body fit. You have to be at your best. If cricketers start retiring for their performance, some of them will retire at 22.Will go back to Ranchi, enjoy a few bike rides. I am not saying I am done, not saying I am coming back. I have the luxury of timing. Will think about it and then decide,"" he added.Reflecting on the season, Dhoni said: ""When we started the season, the four games were in Chennai. We decided to bat second, but I felt the wicket was good for batting in the first innings. I was worried about the batting department. We can put runs on the board, but a few holes to fill. Ruturaj doesn't need to worry about too many things next season. He will fit into one of those roles. You feel old. He is exactly 25 years younger than me, that makes me feel I am old. ""While Gujarat Titans remain firmly in the top four with 18 points, the race for the top two spots continues, with Punjab Kings (17 points), Royal Challengers Bengaluru (17), and Mumbai Indians (16) still having one game each to determine the final standings and secure the advantage of two chances to reach the final on June 3.",Chennai super kings beat gujarat titans by 83 runs in ipl 2025.

Auston Matthews and his fans got emotional as his mother opened up about the financial struggles of getting him into hockey,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/auston-matthews-and-his-fans-got-emotional-as-his-mother-opened-up-about-the-financial-struggles-of-getting-him-into-hockey/articleshow/121166477.cms,"Image credit - Paige Taylor White/CP

Auston Matthews’ hockey dream wasn’t cheap and his mom took the weight

“I used to work in the morning for Starbucks, in the afternoon the restaurant, i was very fortunate to have two jobs. And believe me, if they would have more hours, I would have more jobs.""

Before Auston Matthews was an NHL superstar, his biggest supporter was clocking into two jobs, trying to make ends meet. His mom, Ema Matthews, didn’t just believe in his dream, she bankrolled it, penny by penny, from behind a Starbucks counter. For families without deep pockets, hockey can be financially brutal. But Ema’s resilience turned obstacles into opportunity and her son into one of the league’s brightest stars. Her story is the heartwarming reminder that every great athlete often has a real-life superhero cheering from the sidelines, sacrificing, hustling, and holding it all together so their child can chase the impossible.Ice time, gear, coaching, travel, youth hockey isn’t just a sport, it’s a financial beast. For the Matthews family, especially with Ema being originally from Hermosillo, Mexico, the culture and cost of the sport were both daunting. But she took on the challenge without hesitation, picking up multiple jobs including a gig at Starbucks to ensure Auston never missed a chance to grow on the ice.Ema shared in a past interview that the cost of hockey often reached up to $20,000 a year, a heavy ask for any middle-class family. To make it work, she didn’t just cut corners, she picked up shifts and poured lattes while helping Auston stay focused on the sport. She even deposited small amounts of money in his account so he could grab food with teammates like a regular teen. Beyond that, Ema often drove long hours to tournaments, handled equipment costs, and juggled bills, all to ensure Auston had every chance to chase his dreams without added stress.Ema’s story also breaks stereotypes. In a sport dominated by players from Canada and northern U.S. states, Auston’s rise as a player of Mexican heritage makes his success even more impactful. It's not just about talent, it’s about trailblazing, especially for kids of color or immigrant families who rarely see themselves represented in hockey.Auston Matthews is one of the Toronto Maple Leafs’ biggest stars and a face of the NHL. He’s not just known for his goal-scoring skills but also for his poise and work ethic, traits his mom likely helped instill. While fans celebrate his success on the ice, stories like Ema’s remind us of the sacrifices behind the scenes that made it possible.Ema Matthews’ story shows what’s possible when love, grit, and hustle lead the way. Ema Matthews' unwavering dedication turned sacrifice into success, fueling Auston’s NHL dreams. Her story inspires countless families, proving love and grit can break barriers—even in a sport as costly as hockey.Also read - “From baptism to strip club”: Pete Blackburn’s unhinged NHL comparison is going viral and fans totally get it","Auston matthews is one of the toronto maple leafs’ biggest stars and a face of the nhl.

IPL Points Table

Punjab Kings arrived at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium in Jaipur on Saturday with a top-two finish in sight. But Delhi Capitals had other ideas, pulling off a thrilling 6-wicket win in a high-scoring contest. The result, however, does little to change the bigger picture, as both teams hold their respective positions in the table.Asked to bat first, Punjab looked set for a mammoth total with Shreyas Iyer anchoring the innings with a fluent 53 off 34 deliveries. Marcus Stoinis turned on the heat at the death with an explosive 44* from just 16 balls, guiding Punjab to a formidable 206/8. Mustafizur Rahman was the standout bowler for Delhi, picking up 3 wickets and applying the brakes at crucial moments.Delhi's chase got off to a solid start with KL Rahul scoring a quickfire 35 off 21 balls and Faf du Plessis adding 23 off 15. Though both openers fell before the halfway mark, DC’s innings stayed on course thanks to Karun Nair’s dependable 44 from 27 balls.But the real hero of the evening was Sameer Rizvi. Calm under pressure and fearless against pace, Rizvi smashed an unbeaten 58 off just 25 balls, including 5 sixes that deflated Punjab's bowling attack.He sealed the win with a maximum in the 19.3 over, sparking celebrations in the Delhi dugout.Quiz: Who's that IPL player? Despite the morale-boosting win, Delhi Capitals remain 5th on the table with 15 points from 14 matches. For Punjab, the loss is a setback. Still placed 2nd with 17 points, and they now risk being overtaken by RCB or Mumbai Indians, depending on upcoming results.IPL Points Table:With this result, the race for the second spot in the playoffs is wide open. RCB, MI, and Punjab Kings all have a shot at finishing in the top two. Punjab will take on Mumbai Indians in a high-stakes final league game, while RCB face Lucknow Super Giants in their last match. Net run rates and nerves will decide who grabs that crucial No. 2 slot — and the all-important advantage in the playoffs.","Delhi capitals beat punjab kings by six wickets.

Tom Brady could shape UFL’s future with Tampa Bay investment

Exclusive: UFL Trademark Filings Signal Potential Expansion with Four Historic USFL Franchises

Tom Brady may be retired from the NFL, but the seven-time Super Bowl champion is far from done with football. Just months after becoming a part-owner of the Las Vegas Raiders, new reports suggest Brady is eyeing a second ownership opportunity—this time much closer to his Florida home.According to Mark Perry of UFL News Hub, the United Football League (UFL) is considering expansion teams in Oakland, Philadelphia, New Jersey, and Tampa Bay. While Tampa might seem like an odd choice—given the underwhelming past performance of the Bay Vipers in both the USFL and XFL—there’s a key reason it could be revived: Brady.""This location surprised me as it did not do well in the USFL reboot or the XFL under the (Tampa) Bay Vipers,"" Perry wrote. ""However, I have heard from sources that NFL legend Tom Brady is interested in purchasing a UFL team. I did not believe that rumor until I saw this. Brady lives in the Tampa area. The only reason to bring the Bandits back, based on locations run in the XFL and USFL, is if they had an owner in place.""Brady’s involvement would be a game-changer not only for the potential Tampa Bay franchise but for the entire UFL. His iconic status and proven football acumen could instantly boost credibility and attract fans, sponsors, and talent to the still-growing league.Unlike the NFL, where ownership rules are strict and Brady’s Raiders role has limited visibility—especially since he doesn't live in Las Vegas—the UFL offers a more flexible landscape. This could give Brady the creative freedom to influence everything from branding to football operations.It’s also a strategic move: owning a UFL team in Tampa puts him near his residence and reestablishes a professional football presence in a market still rich with fan interest post-retirement.While nothing is confirmed yet, the mere possibility of Brady fronting a UFL expansion team is already generating buzz. His name carries immense weight, and if he does move forward with Tampa Bay ownership, it would mark a bold and calculated step in shaping the sport beyond the NFL.Also Read: Tom Brady fires back with classic wit after Ryan Reynolds jokingly begs for a jersey and a hair strand With expansion talks heating up, all eyes are on Brady once again—not for a comeback on the field, but for a new legacy in football ownership.","The united football league is considering expansion teams in oakland, philadelphia, new jersey, and tampa bay.

Standings after Match 68:

More Than a Team: The Rise of CSK & the Whistle Podu Army

Top-Two Qualification Scenarios:

Gujarat Titans (18 pts)

No matches left.

Will finish in the top two only if both RCB and PBKS lose their final matches.

Punjab Kings (17 pts)

Remaining Match: vs MI on Monday

A win secures a top-two finish, potentially even top spot if RCB loses.

Royal Challengers Bengaluru (17 pts)

Remaining Match: vs LSG on Tuesday

Victory guarantees a top-two finish regardless of other results.

Mumbai Indians (16 pts)

Remaining Match: vs PBKS

A win propels them to 18 points, likely enough for a top-two finish depending on NRR.

Why top two matters:

Since the top-four spots were sealed, five of the seven final league matches have been played, and three of the top four teams — GT, PBKS and RCB — featured in four of them, losing each time.Gujarat Titans, who were sitting comfortably at the top with 18 points and a healthy net run rate, suffered two back-to-back defeats, missing their chance to seal a top-two finish.1.

Mumbai Indians – 16 ptsWith two matches remaining in the league stage — PBKS vs MI on Monday (May 26) and RCB vs LSG on Tuesday (May 27) — every ball bowled will have serious implications for the playoff seeding.Finishing in the top two means a direct entry to Qualifier 1, offering two chances to reach the final — a massive tactical edge. For the teams that slip to third or fourth, it’s sudden death in the Eliminator.The stakes couldn’t be higher. With every side capable of finishing anywhere in the top four, the final two league matches promise intense drama, tactical battles, and playoff-shaping moments.","The indian premier league (ipl) 2025 is delivering a final week full of drama, with playoff berths already sealed.

But I can say we gave our best and we’ll definitely come back stronger next year,” he added.Since the start of the tournament, the spotlight has been firmly on Venkatesh Iyer, ever since KKR forked out Rs 23.75 crore in the IPL auction to bring him back to the setup after initially releasing him, and he was also announced as the team's vice-captain.However, he hasn’t had the best season, and with every poor performance, he managed only 142 runs in 11 matches for KKR.“See, what I can say is, whether a player is bought for Rs 20 crore or Rs 2 crore, the attitude on the field shouldn't change — and I don't think it did,” said Rahane.“Venkatesh was focused on the right things. He was training hard, committed during games, and trying to contribute. His attitude was fantastic.”“One off-season can happen to any player. It’s not about money or pressure from the price tag — it’s about form and the team dynamics. For us, unfortunately, three to four players were out of form simultaneously, and that made the difference.”With 390 runs in 13 matches (one got washed out), Ajinkya Rahane was the leading run-getter for KKR.“Sometimes, after having a couple of good seasons, you start expecting too much from yourself — and that adds pressure,” he said.“It’s human. You’ve done well, people expect a lot, and you start trying to prove how good you are instead of just playing your natural game.”“Two or three of our key batters were going through that phase. It’s not about individuals — it’s something we’ll all learn from.”He remains confident in the potential of his players, saying, “Rinku, Ramandeep, all of them will come back stronger. They’re experienced enough to bounce back.”Rahane also defended his decision not to open for KKR. Rahane was the highest run-scorer in the Syed Mushtaq Ali, playing for Mumbai, he amassed 469 runs in eight innings with a healthy strike rate of 164.“Yes, I’d love to open. I’ve done well in Mushtaq Ali and other formats as an opener. But it’s about what the team needs,” he said.With Quinton de Kock fixed as an opener and last season’s success behind Sunil Narine’s explosive starts, Rahane said he and Angkrish Raghuvanshi adapted to middle-order roles. “We didn’t want to change too much from a winning combination. We thought 3 and 4 were ideal for us.”While the batting unit came under the scanner, Rahane was full of praise for the team’s bowling. Varun Chakravarthy and Vaibhav Arora are at fifth and seventh position in the Purple Cap race with 17 wickets each. Harshit Rana, one of the finds of last season, picked up 15 wickets.“Harshit has been doing well — for India and for us. But the challenge is real. Playing high-intensity games and immediately shifting to IPL is tough. It's not an excuse, but it’s a factor,” Rahane said.On Varun, Rahane said, “He did well in the Champions Trophy too. Such tournaments take a toll on your body and mind.""""Despite that, as a unit, our bowlers — Harshit, Varun, Sunil (Narine), and Vaibhav — were very clear in their thinking. That was very encouraging.","Kolkata knight riders captain ajinkya rahane says bowling unit did a commendable job in the ipl 2025. Rahane also defends his decision not to open for kkr. With 390 runs in 13 matches (one got washed out), rahane was the leading run-getter.

The Big Picture for the Golden State Warriors

isn’t getting any younger, and after another playoff disappointment, thecan’t afford to stand pat. With their championship window still barely open, Golden State needs a game-changing move—andmight be the perfect gamble.The Warriors’ lack of size and secondary scoring was exposed in their playoff exit, leaving the front office with a clear mandate: go all-in now or risk wasting the final years of Curry’s legendary prime. A shocking trade with the Boston Celtics could be the answer—one that reshapes Golden State’s roster and reignites their title hopes.Here’s why this high-stakes deal makes sense for both sides—and how Porzingis could be the missing piece to unlock the Warriors’ next championship run.According to Matthew Wadleigh of the Sporting News , the Golden State Warriors ’ Western Conference Semifinals exit highlighted their need for size and scoring versatility.With Curry, Draymond Green, and head coach Steve Kerr’s window narrowing, Golden State must act fast.As Matthew noted in the original report: ""The clock is ticking on the Curry-Draymond Green era in Golden State."" A proposed trade from Bleacher Report’s Grant Hughes suggests a deal that could shake up both the Warriors and the Boston Celtics Kristaps Porzingis brings three key elements Golden State lacks:- Elite floor spacing: A career 36% three-point shooter who can pull defenders out of the paint.- Post scoring: A reliable option when Curry is doubled.- Rim protection: Averaged 1.9 blocks per game last season.Despite his defensive shortcomings, rookie Quinten Post was crucial to the Warriors' spacing throughout the season as they battled with size. Porzingis finds a solution to that issue without compromising his offensive game.The Boston Celtics must make financial and roster considerations. The Celtics might give flexibility top priority as Porzingis approaches the last year of his $60 million contract. In exchange, they would obtain:- Moses Moody: A young wing with upside.- Buddy Hield: A proven shooter to replace departing guards.- Trayce Jackson-Davis/Gui Santos: Developmental pieces on team-friendly contracts.A lineup of Curry, Jimmy Butler (if acquired), Green, and Porzingis would be a nightmare for opponents. The Warriors would regain their status as title contenders, leveraging Kristaps Porzingis’ unique skill set to unlock new offensive schemes.With Curry’s career winding down, this trade isn’t just a gamble—it’s a necessity.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Los Angeles Lakers could be eyeing $61,980,000 Atlanta Hawks center in a blockbuster deal to bolster squad around LeBron James and Luka Doncic This move could redefine Golden State’s championship hopes—if they’re willing to pay the price.","Kristaps porzingis could be the missing piece to unlock the golden state warriors' next championship run.

Fifteen days ago, Brian Baldinger from the NFL Network shared that former Denver Broncos safety Justin Simmons’ favorite landing spot was the Philadelphia Eagles. And now, two weeks later, Matt Bowen, NFL Writer and Editor at ESPN, explains why Tampa Bay Buccaneers could be the perfect landing spot for Simmons.Also, NFL Beat Writer at Sports Illustrated, Chad Jensen, explains how Simmons was collateral damage at the Denver Broncos because of Russell Wilson. On the contrary, Steve Bradshaw of TWSN believes Simmons might just go back to the Broncos! In this jungle of free agency, let’s read each one of their tropical(vibrant) opinions!Justin Simmons, former safety for Atlanta Falcons, is a perfect fit for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers - explains Matt Bowen, NFL Writer and Analyst at ESPN. Bowen wrote that Cincinnati(Bengals) and Carolina(Panthers) would also work here, but (Justin)Simmons fits really well as an interchangeable safety opposite Antoine Winfield Jr. in Todd Bowles’ defense.The Buccaneers played the most zone coverage in the league last season (71.1% of the time), and Simmons can spin to the post or walk down in Cover 3. He’s an excellent communicator with field awareness. Simmons has picked off 32 passes over his nine-year career, including two last seasons.On May 19, Chad Jensen, NFL Beat Writer at Sports Illustrated, talked about Justin Simmons’ age and performance. Jensen wrote that entering his age-32 season, Simmons is still excellent in several areas, and he will always be as good as it gets from a leadership, football IQ, and character standpoint.Those are valuable intangibles, but at his age, NFL teams are more focused on the tangible traits in the face of the accelerating vagaries of Father Time. The metaphorical expression “accelerating vagaries of Father Time” means time passes quickly as one ages.On May 24, Chad Jensen further called Justin Simmons collateral damage when the Denver Broncos parted ways with their quarterback Russell Wilson. Jensen wrote, “Simmons was a collateral damage in the botched Russell Wilson trade and subsequent extension in 2022.The Wilson release came with an NFL record $85 million in dead-money hits to the Broncos’ salary cap, which meant the team would have to move on from some players to create breathing room. It also necessitated that the team get skinny and young overnight.If the Broncos didn’t have so much dead money due to the Wilson fiasco, would Simmons still have been cut? Perhaps not cut outright, but he probably would have still been approached about a restructure.”On May 24, Steve Bradshaw, Author at The Wrightway Sports Network, wrote, “While the Buccaneers are a good landing spot, I believe that the Broncos will sign the former Pro Bowl safety. The Broncos and the Buccaneers are very close in their 2025 outlook.That being said, the fact that Simmons played his best football with the Broncos should be the deciding factor. Simmons likely believes now that the Broncos can get the best out of him, and it should be a smooth transition rather than having him bounce around.While the Tampa Bay Buccaneers could absolutely sign Simmons, that may not be where he winds up for 2025.”On May 25, NFL Rumors wrote on their X: Former #Broncos and #Falcons Justin Simmons has been linked to the #Eagles and #Ravens.

Niko Mikkola breaks out to propel Florida Panthers toward another Stanley Cup Final,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/niko-mikkola-breaks-out-to-propel-florida-panthers-toward-another-stanley-cup-final/articleshow/121398236.cms,"Image Via Twitter

Niko Mikkola proves his worth on both ends of the ice with Seth Jones

Florida Panthers defenseman Niko Mikkola has done so much in this deep playoff push for the team that it is now only a win away from a third consecutive Stanley Cup Final. In Game 3 against the Carolina Hurricanes, the towering 6-foot-6 blueliner wowed fans with his rare two-goal performance that led to a dominating 6-2 victory. While his on-ice contributions are growing with respect to the team's success, Mikkola fosters energy, humor, and focus around a team that is again hungry for the championship.Along with Seth Jones on the Panthers' second defensive unit, Mikkola has injected muscle and mobility into Florida's blue line. Interestingly, his Game 3 outing in Carolina was only the second multi goal game of his career, the first coming earlier this season, highlighting his recent surge in offensive confidence. He now has five points in these playoffs, which is his career-best, reinforcing his standing as more than just a shutdown defender.An unrestricted free agent, Mikkola was acquired by Florida on July 1, 2023, arriving from the St. Louis Blues and New York Rangers. Bill Zito, the general manager, had for some time admired Mikkola’s killer work ethic, his lateral size, and team-first attitude. Nicknamed “The Condor” because of his wingspan, he uses those wings to glide fast up the ice, usually ambushing his opponents with his pace and poise.The skating and hockey IQ of Mikkola has flourished in Florida’s high-pressure, closing system. Head coach Paul Maurice called Mikkola's ""straight-line speed"" and instincts a mismatch and a perfect fit for their aggressive style. Mikkola showed his quick defense-to-offense transition and improvisational skills in his rush that led to the important goal in Game 1.Mikkola has also gained respect in the dressing room. Brad Marchand admires his intensity and sense of humor; the captain, Aleksander Barkov, talks about him as being ""great for us."" Once an impenetrable opponent, Mikkola has now become one of Florida’s most steadfast pieces in the championship chase.Also Read: Blackhawks to hire Jeff Blashill as head coach; Ryan Donato expected to hit free agencyFrom an unknown free agent to a crucial playoff performer, Niko Mikkola's journey with the Florida Panthers perfectly embodies the recipe for the team win: size, speed, spirit, and freedom to grow.","Florida panthers defenseman niko mikkola wowed fans with his rare two-goal performance that led to a dominating 6-2 victory.

Poll Do you think Abhimanyu Easwaran will make his Team India debut during the England tour? Yes, he will finally get his chance No, he will miss out again

Shubman Gill story: From a remote village near the border to India’s Test captain

India's squad for five-match Test series against England includes Abhimanyu Easwaran , who's been a silent performer over the years in domestic cricket, piling on runs with impressive consistency. The 29-year-old cricketer is yet to make his Team India debut, falling short just when it all seemed certain to click. Easwaran could've been picked in the lineup during the 2018 tour of England, where he led the India-A side. However, Hanuma Vihari was preferred instead by the selectors.Easwaran was further picked in the national squad on four more instances, with India's 2024-25 tour of Australia the most recent of them all. However, Devdutt Padikkal was preferred ahead of the Bengal batter. The upcoming England tour provides a glorious opportunity for Easwaran to end this agonising wait, considering the chance to impress in Rohit Sharma's absence as well as the opportunity to lead India A.""Abhimanyu would've made his Team India debut long back had he got a chance to showcase his prowess in IPL. The tournament makes a big difference due to greater visibility.Abhimanyu is not a flamboyant player and doesn't run around the ground after scoring centuries. These things go against him. Abhimanyu has been a solid performer which is evident from his tally of 7,674 runs in 101 first-class matches at an average of 48.87. His experience across conditions in New Zealand, Australia, England and West Indies further sets him apart from other contenders,"" said Abhimanyu's father Ranganathan Easwaran in an exclusive interaction with TimesofIndia.com.The 29-year-old cricketer is following a specialised routine to prepare for English conditions in Dehradun, with express pacers from Delhi bowling tirelessly using duke balls.""Abhimanyu wakes up at 5.30 AM and spends hours facing pacers. We've organised two dozen duke balls to ensure no gap in preparation. He's batting on a green wicket with red soil because the bounce enables him to prepare extensively for English conditions. Abhimanyu is also engaging in specialised training to face spinners on the fourth or fifth day. He is studying every bowler in the English setup to handle every situation,"" said Ranganathan.Facing the number of disappointments as Abhimanyu can break down the strongest of spirits. However, the Bengal batter continues to battle it out with determination. Well, why wouldn't he, considering he idolises none other than 'The Wall' Rahul Dravid.""Abhimanu says, 'Not selecting me results in an even important thrust. Instead of banging the door, I have to break it. How can anyone shatter my dream just like that?'. His journey has stretched over 23 years, considering my son began playing cricket at six. I also motivate Abhimanyu by urging him to take inspiration from soldiers who train daily for war-like situations and stay mentally prepared for anything,"" said Ranganathan.""His regime is also very strict like soldiers, with focus on hitting the bed by 9.30-10 PM. Abhimanyu doesn't have a girlfriend. All that will have to wait till he achieves his dream of playing for India,"" he added.Gujarat batter Aarya Desai, who's been a friend of Abhimanyu for more than 10 years, highlighted his mamba mentality.""I've seen him push through everything. Nothing can disturb Abhimayu's preparation. One of the wallpapers on his phone is that of the Indian Test cap, which showcases what it means to him,"" said Aarya.""People labelled Abhimanyu as a slow batter who can't smash it big. He simply refuses to pay heed and focuses on scoring runs,"" added the Gujarat batter.Ex-Indian selector Saba Karim has termed Abhimanyu as the perfect candidate to open for India, considering his technique. A solid display for India A could well lead to louder calls for his selection.","India's squad for five-match test series against england includes abhimanyu easwaran.

WWE Superstar Zoey Stark made her comeback to the limelight in a tragic manner on the recent episode of Monday Night RAW. What was supposed to be a critical milestone in her career, Stark got severely injured in her knee in a triple-threat qualifying match for the 2025 Women's Money in the Bank (MITB) ladder match. The incident has not only sidelined her from one of WWE’s most prestigious events but may also signal a prolonged absence from in-ring competition.The accident occurred at the Bon Secours Wellness Arena in Greenville, South Carolina, during a MITB qualifier bout between Zoey Stark, Kairi Sane, and Rhea Ripley. At its climax, Stark tried her characteristic springboard dropkick—a sportslike move that requires agility and accuracy. In targeting Kairi Sane, Stark slipped in executing the springboard, resulting in her awkwardly landing on her right leg.The blow caused her knee to bend in a distinctly unnatural manner, quite visibly startling both supporters and commentators. The match instantly became secondary as paramedics rushed onto the field to treat the hurt athlete. After the botched maneuver, Stark fell to the floor, cradling her right knee and exhibiting obvious signs of pain and distress. The referee stopped the match for a moment and motioned for medical attention. WWE ringside physicians made their way into the ring and evaluated her condition.Despite the extent of the injury, Stark first tried to leave the ring independently. She tried to stand, only to fall again, as she could no longer bear the weight of herself. Eventually, she was assisted backstage by medical personnel, affirming the severity of the ordeal.Veteran WWE play-by-play commentator Michael Cole guessed on-air that Stark may have re-aggravated an old injury. Stark had extensive knee surgery in 2021 to repair a torn ACL, MCL, and meniscus—injuries requiring months of rehabilitation.With the visual similarity and reaction of Stark, there is an increasing fear that her current injury is a recurrence or exacerbation of the same condition of the knee. But to date, WWE has not issued a formal medical diagnosis or recovery timeline. The wrestling fraternity came in support of Stark after the injury. AEW wrestler Thunder Rosa showed her concern with a heartfelt post on social media:""Wrestling is a lovely and risky sport. We leave everything on the table every time we go to the ring, and we also put a lot on the line when we do what we are passionate about. Zoey Stark, I love you, sister, and I hope that you heal soon."" — Thunder Rosa through X (previously Twitter)Zoey Stark's RAW match was her first on television since January. She had last remained an active member of the dissolved faction Pure Fusion Collective, after Sonya Deville and Shayna Baszler left. Stark was competing mainly in non-televised WWE house shows and sporadic Main Event tapings before this return.As a result of her earlier knee damage incurred during her stint in NXT, Stark was drafted to the main roster as part of the 2023 WWE Draft—a testament to how much the WWE believed in her promising future. The MITB qualifier was set to be a career-launching experience, which made her untimely injury so much more heartbreaking.With Stark out, the match went on between the remaining participants. Rhea Ripley took advantage of the situation, overpowering Kairi Sane and finishing the match with her characteristic Riptide finisher. The pinfall win earned Ripley a spot in the upcoming ladder match for Women's Money in the Bank, which is to be held on June 7. Ripley’s victory, however, was overshadowed by the concern surrounding Stark’s health, as WWE fans and analysts alike shifted focus to the severity of the injury.The extent of Stark’s injury remains unconfirmed by WWE, leaving her return date unknown. Given her history of severe knee damage, fans and medical experts fear that she could face another lengthy recovery process. This injury not only removes her from one of WWE’s most career-defining matches but also risks stalling the momentum she had just begun to regain. For now, Zoey Stark’s fans—and the WWE Universe as a whole—await official word from WWE’s medical team.",Wwe superstar zoey stark suffers a painful knee injury during mitb qualifier bout.

Dak Prescott’s comeback might be biggest tale this year

Dallas still needs to tackle running game

The Dallas Cowboys last season suffered a significant loss and ultimately a missed opportunity once their starting quarterback Dak Prescott suffered a hamstring injury. He was unable to play for half of the season and the Cowboys did not make the playoffs. However, things seem to be looking much better for Prescott and the Cowboys. So far, Prescott indicates that he's almost completely healthy, and it's only early in the year. Before the Cowboys start up a new season in September, he'll be ready to be the team's leader again.Pro Football Focus football writer Ryan Smith recently selected Dak Prescott as one of the most thrilling injury returns to witness this season. The Cowboys genuinely missed him last year, but now he is back and determined.During his final full season, Prescott played some of the best football of his life. He was wise with the ball, made huge plays, and helped the Cowboys win games.To assist Prescott further, the team drafted wide receiver George Pickens in a trade. Pickens is physical, fast, and excellent at catching difficult passes.He'll join CeeDee Lamb, perhaps the game's best receiver today. If they're paired together, they'll become one of the league's most feared receiver duos.Also Read: ""Keep Crying"": Dallas Stars' Coach Pete DeBoer Drags Connor McDavid Into Injury Controversy But Gets Brutally Trolled By Fans While Prescott and the receivers are looking solid, the Cowboys still have issues at running back.

The team needs to know who their primary running back will be.If they can repair that aspect of their offense, the Cowboys may be among the best teams again. Prescott's return to health is a huge advantage, and his leadership will be crucial all year long.For the moment, all seems to be going in the right direction. Prescott has returned, his teammates are solid, and the team is expecting a better year.

NEW DELHI: After almost 3000 days, Karun Nair is once again slated to don the India whites. The man who became only the second Indian batter, after Virender Sehwag , to score a triple century in Test cricket had long been out of contention following his last appearance in 2017 against Australia in Dharamsala.He had to wait. He went back to domestic cricket, kept playing, and continued knocking on the selectors’ doors — but those knocks seemed to fall on deaf ears. Still, he didn’t give up.

After 3000 days — or 8 years and 2 months — Nair will once again proudly wear the India Test jersey he waited so long to reclaim.On Saturday, BCCI named Nair in India’s squad for the upcoming five-match Test series in England. The series will take place from June to August 2025, with matches scheduled at Headingley (Leeds), Edgbaston (Birmingham), Lord’s (London), Old Trafford (Manchester), and The Oval (London).Interestingly, Nair made his Test debut against England in 2016. He was the 287th player to represent India in Tests, receiving his cap from the legendary Sunil Gavaskar.Now, at 33, he returns to the Test arena after a long hiatus — once again against England, but this time in their own backyard.Nair’s childhood coach B. Shivanand recalled that during these years, the only thing his student would quietly say while packing his kit bag was, “Cricket will give me another chance.”""He always remained calm. Never spoke about anything. 'Sir, cricket will give me another chance for sure' — that’s all he used to say whenever I looked at him. Seeing him so silent, I never asked him about his snub from the Test team. This guy is a god-gifted player. There are many, and he is one of them. May God bless him always. God is there, and He has given him a second life. I’m confident he will do better this time as well,"" Nair's childhood coach B. Shivanand told TimesofIndia.com in an exlclusive interview.Nair, who managed just four runs in his maiden Test outing, made a stunning comeback in his next match. He scored an unbeaten 303 off 381 balls, laced with 32 boundaries and 4 sixes, joining Sehwag's elite company.Sehwag, the first Indian to score a triple century in Tests, publicly lauded Nair for the feat.""Yay ! Welcome to the 300 club @karun126. It was very lonely here for the last 12 years 8 months. Wish you the very best Karun.Maza aa gaya!,"" Sehwag had poted.Ironically, for Shivanand, the triple century instigated his prolonged exile from Test cricket.""I don’t know what the thinking was behind his ouster. I believe it was the triple ton. Success often comes at a cost. After Sehwag, Nair was the one who scored a triple century in Tests, and instead of giving a talent like him a long rope, they snubbed him. That’s not fair. That’s not fair to any cricketer who is talented and performing. Talented players shouldn’t be treated like tissue paper. Any other cricketer might have given up or even retired, but this guy was truly hungry for a comeback,"" the coach said.""He always said, ‘I have to score runs in domestic cricket and the IPL,’ and he was confident he would be rewarded for his hard work. The wait was too long, and I’m sure, somewhere deep inside, Karun must be crying silently. But this time, you’ll see a different Karun.""He’s not outwardly aggressive, but if you really want to see his aggression, just watch him now — with the bat. I want him to answer all the questions with a century this time, and he will. Watch out for him. That’s all I want to say. He is hungry — very hungry,"" Shivanand said.","Karun nair named in india's squad for upcoming five-match test series in england.

Greenstone Lobo predicts Virat Kohli & Rohit Sharma's ODI future

NEW DELHI: India head coach Gautam Gambhir has finally broken his silence on the high-profile retirements of Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli from Test cricket, calling it a personal choice and urging respect for their decisions.Speaking ahead of India’s five-Test tour of England, which begins on June 20 in Leeds, Gambhir addressed the vacuum left by the exit of two of India’s modern greats.“I think when you start the game and when you want to finish, it’s a very individual decision,” Gambhir said in an interview with CNN-News18. “No one has the right — be it the coach, the selector, or anyone in this country — to tell someone when to retire. It comes from within.”Both Rohit and Kohli stepped away from the longest format earlier this month, ending a chapter of Indian cricket that spanned over a decade.Though Gambhir admitted the team would miss their experience, he emphasised the opportunity this moment presents for the younger players. “Yes, it will be tough, but then there’ll be people putting their hands up for sure,” he said. “Someone missing out might give another person an opportunity to do something special for the country.”He cited India’s Champions Trophy win without Jasprit Bumrah as proof that the team can succeed despite the absence of senior names.As per reports, the BCCI is expected to announce the Test squad and India’s new red-ball captain on Saturday, with Gambhir and chief selector Ajit Agarkar addressing the media.","India head coach gautam gambhir has finally broken his silence on the high-profile retirements of rohit sharma and virat kohli from test cricket.

GT's middle order concerns

Sai Sudharsan’s T20 Evolution: Where skill meets science | TOI Sports Exclusive

NEW DELHI: Shubman Gill is primed to take over from now-retired Rohit Sharma as India's Test captain, starting with the five-match Test series against England from June 20. He has led the national team in five T20I matches and won four of them. In the Indian Premier League he has been the skipper of Gujarat Titans in 25 matches now and won 14, losing 11. So, based purely on numbers, Gill doesn't necessarily build immediate trust.But his teammates speak highly of the 25-year-old. ""He has been great as a player and as a captain. The way he goes about his work is very calm. He understands the game very well. His communication is good, (which) good for us in the team as well,"" said GT's Sherfane Rutherford in an exclusive conversation with TimesofIndia.com.Rutherford has worked under Gill's leadership for 11 matches now and triumphed in eight of them. ""So for him, he has been doing well and as a team, we try to support him as much as we can and play our roles. And he's a very good player. He's going to be very important for us. Hopefully we can come together as a team and win the tournament,"" added the player from West Indies, with GT chasing the title in IPL 2025.""I think he reads the game very well. He's very humble. As a player that's so young, the way he handles an IPL franchise, he definitely has a good head on his shoulders. And he's a guy that communicates well. He wants the best for his players. And there's no doubt that he's going to be the next big player for India.The sentiments are similar to what Gujarat Titans assistant coach Aashish Kapoor had made for Gill. After GT's win against the Delhi Capitals, where the Fazilka-born player motored his innings fantastically, Kapoor spoke highly of not just his form but his leadership.""I have seen him from U-16. Actually, in NCA, I have done two camps with him. So from the U-16 age group, I have seen that he used to use his brains a lot more than a lot of other guys at his age. That is one quality that is needed to be a captain. Where you can use your brains for yourself and for 10 other people. How are you going to win matches? And we have seen this,"" said Kapoor.As things stand, Gujarat Titans are top of the IPL points table and despite the blip against Lucknow Super Giants, losing by 33 runs, they have a strong chance of finishing the league stage in the top-two. The fact that Royal Challengers Bengaluru also lost to an already eliminated team (Sunrisers Hyderabad) did help their cause as well.Concerningly for GT, their middle-order concerns were laid bare. In the 236-run chase, Gill (35), Sai Sudharsan (21) and Jos Buttler (33) departed with 96 runs on the scorecard. It left the onus on the scarcely tested middle order to get them past the finishing line - and fast. When Buttler departed, GT needed 140 runs from 10.3 overs. For a batting lineup whose depth had barely been tested, in large part to the prowess of the top-three, this was uncharted territory.Rutherford (38) and Shahrukh Khan (57) stitched an 86-run stand but when the former fell, it opened floodgates with 182/3 becoming 202/9 in the span of four overs.""Cricket is basically playing your roles. Yes, our top-three have been doing the job, which is good for us. But the thing for us - in the middle - is important for us to stay hungry. The good thing for us is that we have good preparation. We normally do practice games, even though we're not getting to bat in the middle,"" explained Rutherford.""The day before the game, we did a practice stimulation, which are things that as coaches, they try to do to keep us connected to the game and make sure that we are ready. And I think it's important for us as players to have the right mindset. We have been working hard and it's important to just trust what you have been doing and just go and give it your best,"" he added.Rutherford stressed on taking the ""learnings"" from the defeat after discussion within the group on what they could have done better. All those learnings will be tested for the last time in the group stage on Sunday (May 25) when they take on Chennai Super Kings at the relocated venue in Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad.","Gujarat titans skipper shubman gill is primed to take over from now-retired rohit sharma as india's test captain, starting with the five-match test series against england from june 20.
