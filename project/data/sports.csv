John Rocker fumes over canceled bout with Patrick Mahomes Sr., blames “woke liberals”

Brittany and Patrick Mahomes reportedly stepped in to halt the fight

Former MLB pitcher John Rocker is once again in the spotlight, this time for launching a scathing attack on Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes and his wife, Brittany Mahomes . On April 18, Rocker took to social media platform X (formerly Twitter) to blame the couple for canceling a scheduled celebrity boxing match against Patrick Mahomes Sr., a former minor league pitcher and father of the NFL star.“Today is the day I was supposed to fight Pat Mahomes Sr.,” John Rocker wrote in a heated post. “Instead of fighting today he backed out like a little b*tch because his son and his loser wife decided it'd be a bad look to the family name for him to get in the ring. Bunch of f***ing woke liberals.”The match, originally announced by Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy, was part of the ""Rough N Rowdy"" boxing series and scheduled to take place in Wheeling, West Virginia. It stemmed from a staged altercation between Rocker and Mahomes Sr. on Bourbon Street during Super Bowl week, reportedly crafted as a publicity stunt to build hype around the fight.Court filings from Mahomes Sr.’s recent DWI case later confirmed the confrontation was orchestrated for entertainment purposes, with Mahomes Sr. standing to earn a minimum of $85,000 for his participation before the event was scrapped.Dave Portnoy weighed in on the cancellation during an episode of The Unnamed Show podcast, stating that Patrick Mahomes and Brittany played a pivotal role in putting a stop to the bout. According to Portnoy, “Mahomes' agent and Brittany – from what I am told – intervened and were like, ‘There's no way this fight’s happening. We’re going to cut this guy off if he does it.’”Neither Patrick nor Brittany Mahomes have responded to Rocker’s outburst. Instead, Brittany has been focused on family, recently sharing heartwarming photos from a Disney vacation with their three children—Sterling, Bronze, and Golden Raye.As the Chiefs look ahead to the 2025 NFL season, Mahomes is coming off a strong campaign with 3,928 passing yards and 26 touchdowns. Despite finishing the season with a 17-3 record, Kansas City fell short in Super Bowl LIX, losing to the Philadelphia Eagles.Also Read: Patrick Mahomes called ‘biggest loser’ as the Chiefs' face major issues on offensive line after Joe Thuney trade This latest clash between Rocker and the Mahomes family adds a bizarre offseason twist to the NFL drama, one that continues to blur the line between sports and spectacle.","Former mlb pitcher john rocker is once again in the spotlight, this time for launching a scathing attack on kansas city chiefs quarterback patrick mahomes and his wife, brittany.

Is Taylor Swift too ‘white bread’ for Coachella’s cool crowd? Exploring the pop queen’s place in festival culture,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/is-taylor-swift-too-white-bread-for-coachellas-cool-crowd-exploring-the-pop-queens-place-in-festival-culture/articleshow/120382497.cms,"Is Taylor Swift too mainstream for Coachella (Image via Getty Images)

Is Taylor Swift too mainstream for Coachella’s indie vibe?

When it comes to music festivals like Coachella, image matters just as much as the music. It’s not just about who performs—it’s about who belongs. So when Taylor Swift is rumored to make an appearance or even perform, one question keeps popping up: is Taylor Swift too “white bread” for Coachella’s trend-setting, genre-bending scene?On paper, Taylor Swift has the résumé to own any stage. With record-breaking albums, a sold-out Eras Tour, and a massive global fanbase, she’s arguably the biggest pop star on the planet. But Coachella is more than just a concert—it’s a cultural moment, curated for cool. It’s where edgy, experimental, and often underground artists get their shine. It’s where alternative fashion reigns and mainstream pop can sometimes feel… out of place.So why the “white bread” label? It stems from the perception that Taylor Swift’s music—despite its evolution—is still rooted in polished, safe storytelling. While she’s dabbled in indie folk with Folklore and Evermore, and even worked with edgy producers like Jack Antonoff and Aaron Dessner, some still see her as the girl-next-door in a world full of rebellious misfits.Yet that assumption overlooks her savvy reinventions. Taylor has consistently pushed boundaries in her own way—whether it’s re-recording her masters to reclaim her artistry, calling out industry sexism, or subtly weaving political themes into her music. She’s clean-cut, yes, but not without edge. Maybe she’s not flipping off the crowd in a studded leather jacket—but she’s rewriting the rules in a sparkly bodysuit, and doing it on her own terms.The reality is, Coachella has changed too. The lineup now spans everything from reggaeton and K-pop to hip-hop and house. The festival has become a melting pot of genres and identities. If Blink-182, Billie Eilish, and Bad Bunny can all share the same stage, why not Taylor?Also Read: Did Taylor Swift skip Coachella 2025 to avoid being upstaged by other stars? Fans question her absence amid rising speculation Whether she ever headlines or just shows up to support friends (like boyfriend Travis Kelce or producer pals), her presence sparks conversation. And maybe that’s the point. Because if Taylor Swift isn’t Coachella enough—then maybe it’s time to ask what Coachella really stands for in 2025.After all, being too “white bread” might just be the boldest thing you can be in a world obsessed with crust.","Is taylor swift too mainstream for coachella’s indie vibe?

She recently called Carmelo the “best dad” for always being there for their son. However, when speaking about herself, she said that she doesn’t have anyone to have her back. The two have been co-parenting their son, Kiyan Anthony , since their divorce.La La Anthony recently opened up about her work, life after divorce and her son during a chat with Vivian Tu on the show Richer Lives. The couple welcomed son Kiyan in 2007, got married in 2010 and got divorced in 2021. Despite being a successful TV personality and actor, La La opened up about losing her backing post her divorce with Carmelo Anthony.La La also didn’t mince words in praising her ex-husband when it came to what he does for their son. She said that she learnt to co-parent as they navigated the new space. “My son’s dad is the greatest dad I know and I am just so blessed that we have a child together. My son gets to experience having two incredible parents and having a dad like he does,” she said on the show. Kiyan has grown into a successful basketball player with a NIL valuation of $1 million.Opening her heart on how things changed after the divorce, she said, “You’re on your own at that point… and that puts a different responsibility, sometimes a different amount of pressure. Before, I was always financially independent, but in the back of my mind, I knew if anything happens, at least I have this person to help me or bail me out. You realise it’s just you. That just puts a different responsibility, sometimes a different amount of pressure. I am the person that everyone in my family calls. I don’t have anyone to call. There’s pressure there, but I don’t mind it.”La La has, however, held the fort well for the sake of her son and confirmed that she has always been present for his special moments. “For the most part, he can say that my mom’s always been there for all of my moments.

How Adebayo Fits with the Golden State Warriors

Thenarrowly escaped a Play-In disaster against the Memphis Grizzlies , securing the No. 7 seed in the Western Conference. But even with their postseason spot locked in, changes may be necessary this offseason—starting with moving on from Buddy Hield and pursuing Miami Heat star, as predicted by Caleb Hightower of Sporting News Buddy Hield’s early-season promise as a Klay Thompson replacement has faded. His three-point shooting, once reliable, has plummeted to concerning lows:- December: 30.5% from three- January: 31.5% from three- Play-In performance: 1-of-4 from deep against MemphisWhile Hield finished the regular season at 37.0% from beyond the arc, his inconsistency makes him a liability. As Caleb Hightower noted,If the Golden State Warriors exit the playoffs early, targeting Bam Adebayo in a trade could reshape their roster. The three-time All-Star has evolved into a complete two-way force:- 2024-25 Stats: 18.1 PPG, 9.6 RPG, 4.3 APG- Shooting Splits: 48.5% FG, 35.7% 3P- Versatility: Scores inside, handles the ball, and stretches the floorAdebayo’s growth from a defensive specialist to an offensive weapon addresses Golden State’s need for a dynamic big man.1. Scoring Boost: Provides interior scoring and mid-range efficiency.2. Playmaking: Adds a facilitator from the high post.3. Defensive Anchor: Complements Draymond Green’s versatility.The Trade ScenarioA Hield-Adebayo swap wouldn’t improve the Warriors’ outside shooting, but it would give them a proven All-Star to pair with Stephen Curry and Draymond Green.

NEW DELHI: Punjab Kings produced an outstanding bowling effort, which laid the foundation for their five-wicket triumph over the Royal Challengers Bengaluru in a rain-affected IPL encounter.The match was reduced to 14 overs per side due to a rain delay, and the Royal Challengers Bengaluru could only muster a paltry total of 95 for 9.Tim David's unbeaten 50 off 26 balls accounted for more than 50% of RCB's inadequate score.Despite facing initial hiccups, the Punjab Kings chased down the target in 12.1 overs, scoring 98 for 5, and extending RCB's winless streak at home this season.The Kings' hard-hitting openers, Priyansh Arya and Prabhsimran Singh, struggled initially on a pitch that offered considerable bounce to the pacers.Arya, known for his ability to hit through the line, misjudged the conditions and skied a mistimed shot off Josh Hazlewood to David.Prabhsimran fell to Bhuvneshwar Kumar, and the Kings were jolted further when the in-form captain Shreyas Iyer was dismissed, edging Hazlewood to the wicketkeeper.With the score at 53 for 4, the Kings found themselves in a precarious position, but Nehal Wadhera's composed innings of 33 not out off 19 balls, including a couple of sixes off Suyash Sharma, steadied the ship.Wadhera's calm approach played a crucial role as the Punjab Kings eventually crossed the line, boosting their tally to 10 points and moving up to second place on the points table behind the leaders Delhi Capitals.Earlier, the Kings' clever bowling restricted RCB to a disappointing total after Shreyas opted to bowl first. The decision proved fruitful as the bowlers claimed three wickets in the powerplay.Phil Salt perished in the first over, trying to hit Arshdeep Singh out of the park, while Virat Kohli and Liam Livingstone also departed without making a significant impact.Yuzvendra Chahal, making his return to his former IPL home ground, Chinnaswamy Stadium, had a memorable outing, claiming the wicket of Jitesh Sharma. Rajat Patidar played some handsome shots, including a six off Bartlett, but RCB suffered a setback when Patidar (23 off 18) was dismissed by Chahal's tossed-up delivery.Marco Jansen (2/10) used short-pitched balls effectively, dismissing Krunal Pandya and Manoj Bhandage, as the RCB innings unravelled.Despite a few big blows by Player of the Match Tim David, including three consecutive sixes off Harpreet Brar, who also claimed two wickets, RCB's total proved insufficient against the Kings' disciplined bowling effort.","Punjab kings beat royal challengers bengaluru by five wickets. Match was reduced to 14 overs per side due to a rain delay. Tim david's unbeaten 50 accounted for more than 50% of rcb's inadequate score.

“I think we have a great team. We have guys who are willing to go to war. Everybody is staying together, the chemistry is high. So I think we, for sure, have a chance.”

has been determined to win the Championship title, and he has been highly vocal regarding this in a recent interview. Thehave entered the 2025 NBA playoffs as the No. 3 seed in the Western Conference, setting up a first-round matchup against the Minnesota Timberwolves. Central to the Los Angeles Lakers’ renewed championship aspirations is their superstar acquisition, Luka Doncic, who has dramatically transformed the team since joining midseason.Since Luka Doncic’s arrival, the Los Angeles Lakers have posted an 18-10 record when he’s on the court, a 64.2% winning percentage that underscores his immediate impact. Averaging 28.2 points, 8.1 rebounds, and 7.5 assists per game in 28 outings with Los Angeles, Doncic has brought elite-level production and playmaking to a team that had been searching for a consistent offensive leader.Luka Doncic recently showed confidence in his team by saying,His presence alongside LeBron James and rising star Austin Reaves has created a potent trio, bolstered by a solid supporting cast and high team chemistry. Luka Doncic’s playoff pedigree is well established. Just last year, he led the Dallas Mavericks to the NBA Finals despite battling significant injuries, showcasing his ability to elevate his game under pressure. Now healthier and more integrated with the Los Angeles Lakers, Doncic is eager to embrace the challenges of postseason basketball with his new team. He has expressed confidence in the Lakers’ championship potential, emphasizing the team’s unity and willingness to “go to war” together. His career playoff scoring average of 30.9 points per game ranks second only to Michael Jordan, highlighting his capacity to deliver in critical moments.The upcoming series against the Timberwolves promises to be a compelling battle, especially with Doncic’s anticipated matchup against Rudy Gobert, a defensive stalwart and multiple-time Defensive Player of the Year. Doncic thrives in pick-and-roll situations and relishes the opportunity to test his skills against Gobert, which could prove decisive in the series.Despite some skepticism from outside voices, including former champions predicting a disappointing playoff run, the Los Angeles Lakers and their fans are buoyed by the optimism of their star player and coaching staff. Head coach JJ Redick has voiced strong confidence in Doncic’s abilities, noting that no defender can truly contain him. The Lakers’ recent form—19-12 since Doncic’s arrival—combined with the veteran leadership of LeBron James and the dynamic scoring of Doncic, positions them as a formidable contender.Also read: Los Angeles Lakers in Trouble? Magic Johnson reveals his biggest concern involving Anthony Edwards Threat - ""I'm scared for my Lakers!"" In sum, the Lakers’ 2025 playoff outlook is bright, fueled by Luka Doncic’s exceptional talent and the team’s cohesive chemistry. While the path to the championship will be challenging, the blend of experience, skill, and hunger for success makes the Los Angeles Lakers a legitimate threat to claim their 18th NBA title this season. The stage is set for a thrilling postseason, with Doncic poised to lead Los Angeles on a deep playoff run.","Luka doncic has been determined to win the championship title with the los angeles lakers.

From gridiron greatness to emotional vulnerability



When public image collides with private battles



Even the most successful athletes face challenges that stats and accolades can’t capture—and Tom Brady is no exception. Widely regarded as the greatest quarterback in NFL history , Brady's legendary career boasts an unmatched seven Super Bowl titles, yet behind the shine of championship rings lies a more vulnerable, human side he’s beginning to share with the world.For two decades, Tom Brady maintained a laser focus on football, becoming the ultimate symbol of discipline and competitive excellence. But recently, the 46-year-old has revealed glimpses of his personal struggles, particularly in the wake of his divorce from supermodel Gisele Bündchen . Brady, who is usually tight-lipped about his private life, opened up about the emotional toll of navigating heartbreak, admitting he’s dealt with moments of “willful blindness.”This phrase—suggesting a conscious decision to ignore uncomfortable truths—points to the complexities Tom Brady faced in his marriage’s unraveling. While he didn’t name names, the context was unmistakable, especially given recent headlines surrounding Bündchen's ongoing relationship with her jiu-jitsu trainer, who is now widely rumored to be her partner and the father figure in her children’s lives.“Willful blindness” is not just a phrase—it’s a powerful acknowledgment of emotional compromise. Brady’s reflection reveals the cost of chasing perfection on the field while personal issues simmer in the background. The quarterback, once seemingly invincible both in his career and family life, now speaks like someone reckoning with the pain of being left behind. For fans, it’s a rare and raw admission: the GOAT is still just a man.The emotional fallout of watching Bündchen move on publicly is undoubtedly difficult for someone so accustomed to control and success. Reports of her being seen with her new partner and children add emotional weight to Brady’s recent comments, suggesting a sense of betrayal or at least loss.Also Read: Fresh discussion on Tom Brady and Gisele’s Bündchen’s marriage reignites debate over missed red flags Tom Brady’s recent openness signals a shift—not just for him but for the culture surrounding sports icons. His words serve as a reminder that personal pain doesn't discriminate by fame or fortune. As he transitions into the next chapter of his life, his legacy will now also include emotional authenticity—proof that true greatness isn't only measured by rings, but by the willingness to confront what hurts behind closed doors.","Tom brady has revealed glimpses of his personal struggles, particularly in the wake of his divorce from supermodel gisele bündchen.

Best wishes to coach.”This incident comes just five months after Popovich suffered a mild stroke on November 2 at the Frost Bank Center. The stroke occurred a day before a scheduled game against the Minnesota Timberwolves. The franchise announced the news nearly two weeks later, stating he was expected to make a full recovery. “At this point, a timeline for his return to the sidelines has not been determined,” the Spurs said in a statement on November 13.Popovich, who had been away from coaching duties since the stroke, officially confirmed in late February that he would not return for the remainder of the 2024–25 season. In a heartfelt message, he praised his staff and players during his absence. “I’ve decided not to return to the sidelines this season,” Popovich said in a February 27 statement. “Mitch Johnson and his staff have done a wonderful job and the resolve and professionalism the players have shown, sticking together during a challenging season, has been outstanding. I will continue to focus on my health with the hope that I can return to coaching in the future.”While fans and media alike continue to speculate about his future with the team, there is still no official word on whether Popovich will return to coach for the 2025–26 NBA season.

Ukrainian tennis player Tsurenko sues WTA and its chairman for causing ''emotional distress'',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/ukrainian-tennis-player-tsurenko-sues-wta-and-its-chairman-for-causing-emotional-distress/articleshow/120398859.cms,"Ukrainian tennis player Tsurenko sues WTA and its chairman for causing ''emotional distress''

NEW YORK: Ukrainian tennis player Lesia Tsurenko has filed an amended lawsuit that accuses the WTA Tour and its chairman, Steve Simon , of a breach of contract, negligence and the ""negligent infliction of emotional distress"" because of the way it has handled Russian and Belarusian players amid the war in Ukraine. Tsurenko, who was once among the world's top 25, claims in the lawsuit that WTA executives - including Simon, who was its CEO at the time - failed to follow through on assurances made in a meeting with Ukrainian players that the organization would ban Russian or Belarussian players who publicly supported the war with Ukraine.The amended lawsuit, filed Tuesday in federal court for the Southern District of New York, cited examples such as Russian player Veronika Kudermetova wearing a patch at the French Open for sponsor Taneft, a subsidiary of a company that was sanctioned by the European Union for helping to supply the Russian army.""Despite this promise,"" the lawsuit from Tsurenko claims, ""neither Defendant Steve Simon nor Defendant WTA banned Russian and Belarus players who publicly supported the war.""The WTA said in a statement to The Associated Press on Wednesday that it has been ""steadfast and clear in its condemnation of Russia's war on Ukraine and the actions of the Russian government against the Ukrainian people.""""Consistent with our position,"" the statement said, ""the WTA has taken numerous steps to assist our Ukrainian player members, who have faced great challenges as professional athletes. The WTA has been equally clear that it was founded on principles of equality and non-discrimination and its rules provide that competitions are open to all women players who qualify based on their merit, and without discrimination. Consistent with those principles, and in common with other tennis organizations, the WTA has taken the position that individual athletes should not be penalized for the actions of their governments.""Shortly after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the WTA Tour, ATP Tour and International Tennis Federation issued a joint statement in which it said Russian and Belarusian athletes would be allowed to compete as long as they did not compete under their nation's flags. That policy remains in place with Russian and Belarusian athletes competing at last year's Paris Olympics as ""Individual Neutral Athletes;"" Russian players Mirra Andreeva and Diana Shnaider won silver in women's doubles.Tsurenko's lawsuit states that she was forced to withdraw from an event at Indian Wells because of a panic attack from having to potentially play against Russians and Belarusians, and that she had ""developed excessive stress, loss of concentration affecting her performance at tennis games, mortification and injury to her feelings.""Lindsay Brandon, the WTA director of safeguarding, informed Tsurenko in 2023 that Simon would be investigated for violating its code of conduct. But that October, the organization informed her that Simon had not violated its code nor any provision of the employee handbook. Tsurenko tried to appeal but was unsuccessful.""Even in my worst nightmares, I couldn't imagine that the professional tour, which I considered my home, would become a terrifying and alien place, where the (former) CEO of the organization consciously committed an act of moral abuse against me, leading to a panic attack and my inability to do my job,"" Tsurenko wrote Tuesday on social media.The initial complaint filed in November requests a trial by jury.Proskaeur Rose, the law firm representing the WTA, filed a motion last month to dismiss the case on the grounds that Tsurenko's claims were ""legally defective."" The WTA has until April 30 to decide whether it will continue with its motion to dismiss.""While the WTA has the greatest sympathy for the significant challenges that Ms. Tsurenko and our other Ukrainian athletes have faced,"" its statement said Wednesday, ""we are disappointed that she has decided to engage in litigation to seek to hold the WTA responsible for her distress. At all times, the WTA and its management acted appropriately and in accordance with our rules, and we are confident that we will prevail in this litigation.""","Ukrainian tennis player lesia tsurenko sues wta and its chairman for causing ''emotional distress'' wta says in a statement that it has been ""steadfast and clear in its condemnation of russia's war on ukraine"" the wta has until april 30 to decide whether it will continue with its motion to dismiss.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120398899,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-787342,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
