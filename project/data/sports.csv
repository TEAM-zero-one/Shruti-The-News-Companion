The Kansas City Chiefs have Travis Kelce back for the 2025-26 season, but his days as the team's top tight end might be numbered.Kelce returns to the Chiefs at age 35, clearly past his prime years. He's a franchise legend, racking up 12,151 receiving yards over 174 regular season games. But his numbers have steadily declined since 2022, the last season he crossed 1,000 receiving yards.Last season, Kelce caught 97 passes on 133 targets, but managed just three touchdowns—his career-low. It's reassuring to see Kelce on the field again, but the Chiefs should strongly consider increasing Noah Gray 's snaps.Noah Gray, drafted in the fifth round by the Chiefs in 2021, keeps improving. Last season was Gray's best yet, posting career-highs with 437 receiving yards and five touchdowns from 40 catches on 49 targets.At age 26, Gray is entering his prime years. Keeping him limited behind a declining Kelce could be a serious mistake. Kansas City recognized Gray’s potential with a contract extension, clearly seeing his value beyond a typical fifth-round pick.Pro Football Focus graded Gray at 74.2 last season, placing him eighth among all tight ends. Kelce's grade was 70.9, ranking him 15th. Gray objectively outperformed Kelce, suggesting it's time for Kansas City to prioritize youth over legacy.Taylor Swift dominated the recent iHeartRadio Music Awards , earning nine awards, including Artist of the Year, Pop Artist of the Year, and a special honor for her global ""Eras Tour,"" plus six fan-voted categories.Though Swift missed the event at the Dolby Theater in LA, she sent a recorded acceptance speech. Fans speculated her boyfriend, Chiefs star Travis Kelce, filmed the video, citing what appeared to be his reflection in Swift's trophy.While that theory remains uncertain, Donna Kelce, Travis' mother, made her support clear. Mama Kelce proudly posted Swift’s awards haul on Instagram, gathering over 85,000 likes and enthusiastic reactions from fans.a fan another.Donna Kelce has formed a close bond with Swift since she started dating Travis in the summer of 2023, often sitting together at Chiefs games at Arrowhead Stadium. Mama Kelce also openly supports her other daughter-in-law, Kylie Kelce—wife of former NFL player Jason Kelce—recently comforting the couple following the loss of their dog.Swifties have always looked out for Taylor, especially when it comes to her relationships.

“They ain’t holla at me at all,”

Dallas could have been a perfect fit, but now Henry is locked in with the Ravens

Baltimore Ravens ’ star running back Derrick Henry has officially sold his Dallas home, but it’s not just a routine real estate transaction—it’s a symbolic farewell to a long-standing dream. Henry, who was once rumored to be eyeing a future with the Dallas Cowboys , sold the property for $1.6 million, falling short of its original asking price. This move marks the final chapter in his connection to Dallas, a city he once hoped to call his permanent NFL home.Henry originally bought the luxurious 4,154-square-foot home in Inwood Park in 2022. Featuring 20-foot ceilings, floor-to-ceiling windows, marble floors, and hardwood flooring, the property was a high-end investment. The stunning residence offers four bedrooms, four bathrooms, and a spacious three-car garage. Designed for both comfort and style, it boasts a gourmet kitchen, a cozy fireplace, custom walk-in closets, and a lush turf backyard perfect for outdoor relaxation.He first listed it for $1.8 million in 2023 but later took it off the market before relisting it at $1.6 million with a different real estate agency.According to TMZ, the final sale amount has not been disclosed, but sources suggest it was close to the lowered asking price. The sale ends Henry’s residential ties to Dallas, a city he had considered home due to his girlfriend, Adrianna Rivas , having family in the area.While Henry’s Dallas residency was partly personal, it was also fueled by his football aspirations. The running back admitted onpodcast that he had wanted to play for the Cowboys.” Henry said. “Unfortunately for Henry, the Cowboys never approached him.he revealed, making it clear that the interest was one-sided.Many Cowboys fans were thrilled by the idea of Derrick Henry joining the team and teaming up with Dak Prescott. With his powerful running style and Dallas’ solid offensive line, Henry could have brought a whole new level of strength to the offense. His ability to break tackles and wear down defenses seemed like the perfect fit for a team looking to boost its rushing attack. But despite all the excitement and speculation, the Cowboys stuck to their usual cautious approach to building the roster. Instead of making a big move for Henry, they decided to stay the course—meaning the star running back never got the call.Now, he’s set to be a major weapon for the Ravens, forming a lethal ground with his peers. While Cowboys fans may be left wondering what could have been, Ravens fans have every reason to celebrate.

Bruins fans struggle to accept Brad Marchand’s debut for the Panthers

Brad Marchand’s highly anticipated debut for the Florida Panthers has ignited a wave of anger and disappointment among Boston Bruins fans . The NHL veteran, who was unexpectedly traded at the deadline, is set to return to the ice after recovering from an upper-body injury. As Panthers coach Paul Maurice confirmed, ""We are shooting for Friday against Utah right now,"" signaling Marchand’s imminent return. While this marks a fresh start for the seasoned winger, Bruins fans aren’t taking it lightly.Brad Marchand, a key figure in the Bruins’ 2011 Stanley Cup victory, had a rough season before the trade. His exit was a shock, and seeing him suit up for the Panthers so soon has left Boston fans frustrated. With the Bruins currently struggling in the standings, some supporters are hoping that Marchand’s return might not immediately benefit Florida. One fan humorously pleaded, ""Can we just deny it at littleeee bit longer?""The trade was already difficult for many to process, but now, with both teams in direct competition for a playoff spot, emotions are running high. The Panthers are sitting second in the Atlantic Division, while the Bruins are near the bottom.

Ryan Whitney questions the timing of PM Mark Carney’s appearance



Connor McDavid welcomes PM Mark Carney's support



Polarized opinions about political personalities in sports



Former NHL defenseman Ryan Whitney had no qualms expressing his outrage about Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney attending the Edmonton Oilers ' pre-game skate. Whitney, a straight-talker, was taken aback at seeing a politician taking to the ice before an important game and wondered at the wisdom behind it and its effects on the preparation of the players.Showing disbelief at the timing of the visit, Ryan Whitney contended that pre-game skates are essential for the players to get their minds together and prepare. The ex-Edmonton Oilers blueliner noted that politicians should not attend during such times, especially when they are not skilled on ice skates.“This Carney guy, Mark Carney is his name. This guy is out there in a pregame skate… I don't care which way he leans politically. It could be the right-wing guy or the left-wing guy. You don't have a politician on the ice during the pregame skate , not to mention a politician who can't skate,” Whitney ranted. “Don't bring politicians on the ice, let alone on a practice day. We're talking pregame skate. Do you think Ryan Nugent-Hopkins wants some politician standing next to him before a game? You have your preparations.”Whitney's comments quickly resonated with hockey fans , with some thinking that politicians shouldn't interrupt game-day rituals, while others didn't see anything wrong with the visit.Even though Whitney panned the visit, Edmonton Oilers captain Connor McDavid had another take. The superstar forward welcomed Mark Carney's visit, saying it was great to have a lifelong Oilers fan present around the team.“Obviously, it’s nice to have him here. He's an Oilers fan, a lifelong Oilers fan. Oilers fans are welcome here, for sure. I don't know if his security detail would appreciate that too much. But, of course, it's a special thing to bring him here. It was great to meet him,” McDavid said.Mark Carney's ice appearance has ignited controversy, with some regarding it as a friendly gesture and others, such as Ryan Whitney, thinking that it breaks up the team's routine. Support from celebrity figures is welcome to fans, but whether it should only be in the form of off-ice engagement is questionable.Also read: “Nice to have him here”: Connor McDavid on Canada PM Mark Carney's appearance at Oilers morning skate While the Edmonton Oilers' season goes on, the players and their game will continue to be the priority, but the words of Whitney have made sure that Mark Carney's visit will not soon be forgotten.","Canadian prime minister mark carney attended the edmonton oilers pre-game skate.

Team gives priority to cap space ahead of contract extensions



Mitch Marner's contract situation hangs over



John Tavares and Steven Lorentz in wait-and-see mode



A make-or-break offseason for Toronto



As the NHL summer gets near, the Toronto Maple Leafs are adopting a guarded stance on their roster choices. Based on NHL insider Nick Kypreos , the franchise's first concern is Mitch Marner's future ahead of signing contract extensions on other players, such as John Tavares and Steven Lorentz. Toronto Maple Leafs general manager Brad Treliving is also known to be a Marner enthusiast.The Maple Leafs are said to be waiting on contract negotiations with their upcoming unrestricted free agents until they decide if Marner will remain or if they will have to spend cap room to replace him. “It sounds like pending unrestricted free agents John Tavares and Steven Lorentz will have to wait until the offseason for any contract offers from the Leafs if they are to stay. The Leafs’ top priority remains leaving enough cap space to either re-sign Mitch Marner or bring in one or two players as suitable replacements.” Kypreos said in the Toronto Star.Marner, 27, is set to reach the expiration of his six-year, $65.4 million contract soon, and he continues to perform well on the ice. He has 89 points in 71 games and is still an integral offensive player for the Maple Leafs. Yet if he reaches free agency on July 1, he likely will demand a hefty salary bump, maybe into the $13-14 million per-year area.Despite previous trade speculation, Toronto Maple Leafs general manager Brad Treliving has remained a strong supporter of Marner. The marquee winger wouldn't waive his no-trade clause at the trade deadline, making him the boss of the situation. The Leafs now have to determine if they can keep him or if they will have to look elsewhere.Vet Center John Tavares is also in his seventh and last year of a $77 million, seven-year contract. He has been contributing with 33 goals and 67 points through 65 contests. The Maple Leafs are not hurrying, though, to sign him longer term, holding off to examine how the Marner situation will develop before they commit long-term.Although Tavares is still an asset, Kypreos said his Toronto future will hinge on whether or not the club can generate the cap space necessary.In the meantime, forward Steven Lorentz is going through a one-year, $775,000 deal and has tallied six goals and 16 points in 69 contests. Similar to Tavares, he sits in limbo as the Leafs determine their roster requirements.The Maple Leafs' offseason plan will heavily depend on Marner's choice. If he re-signs, Toronto will have to manage its remaining cap space very carefully to complete the roster. If he departs, the team will have the cap space to go after other high-impact free agents.Also read: Toronto Maple Leafs sign NCAA standout Luke Haymes to two-year contract With free agency only months off, everyone's eyes will be on the Maple Leafs as they make their way through one of the most important off-seasons in recent history.",The toronto maple leafs are said to be waiting on contract negotiations with their upcoming unrestricted free agents.

Donovan Mitchell is cleared to play against the Detroit Pistons tonight. He is not listed on the team’s injury report and can be seen on the team’s projected starters list.Mitchell, averaging 23.7 points per game (17th in the NBA) and leading the Cavaliers with 3.3 made threes per contest (8th in the league), remains a critical piece for the Eastern Conference leaders. His availability is key as Cleveland holds the NBA’s top-ranked offense (122.3 PPG) and a +10.4-point differential. The Cavaliers ’ injury report includes Evan Mobley (rest), Jaylon Tyson (knee), and Ty Jerome (knee), all listed as day-to-day.

Cunningham’s absence is a significant blow—the Pistons’ leading scorer (23.8 PPG last 20 games) has been instrumental in their playoff push.

Jayson Tatum reacted to his nickname ‘The Anomaly’ while speaking with Travis Kelce and Jason Kelce



Where did Jayson Tatum’s nickname come from?



Boston Celtics star Jayson Tatum ’s reaction to a particular nickname has sparked plenty of discussion among fans and media alike. Tatum, who has been a star player for the Celtics, recently addressed the growing trend of people calling him ‘ The Anomaly ’ during his chat with NFL star siblings Travis Kelce and Jason Kelce in a new episode a their New Heights podcast .During a guest appearance on the New Heights podcast hosted by NFL stars Travis and Jason Kelce, Jayson Tatum was asked about the nickname that has been making rounds on social media. Travis Kelce, referring to Tatum’s Wikipedia page, brought up the moniker and asked, “Has anybody that is close to you ever actually called you, ‘The Anomaly’?”Tatum was amused. He responded with a candid answer that sent the Kelce brothers into fits of laughter. “Twitter is not a real place, I’ll say that,” Tatum hared. His reaction made it clear that he wasn’t exactly embracing the nickname, despite its growing popularity.Jason Kelce, however, had a different take. “I would run with that one. I like it. ‘The Anomaly’ is a good one. I don’t know who came up with that.” To which Travis Kelce agreed, saying, “It is a banger.”The origins of ‘The Anomaly’ trace back to social media, where an X user first suggested it, pointing out Tatum’s unique skill set. “Handles like someone 6 inches shorter, shoots pull-ups like a guard, finishes at the rim like a center, and consistently defends 1-5.”The nickname got wide attention, and soon, even official team accounts like the Portland Trail Blazers started using it in their game promotions. Basketball Reference has even added it to Tatum’s list of nicknames.Previously, when asked directly if he liked the name, he hesitated before admitting, “Ahhh, I don’t know.” He went on to mention that friends and teammates call him by other names, such as ‘Big Deuce’ and ‘Taco.’Also Read: Jayson Tatum's injury report (March 26, 2025): Is the Boston Celtics star fit to play against the Phoenix Suns tonight?

IPL 2025: How will KKR, MI, CSK, SRH, RCB fare this season?

After being outclassed in their previous matches, title holders Kolkata Knight Riders and Rajasthan Royals are looking for a quick turnaround when they meet in an IPL match today (March 26).The Knight Riders lost to Royal Challengers Bengaluru by seven wickets in their opener, while the Royals suffered a 44-run defeat against Sunrisers Hyderabad.Both teams share a common issue: their once-impressive batting and bowling units have failed to perform. While the Royals might attribute their bowling struggles to playing at a difficult Hyderabad venue, the Knight Riders lack such an excuse.Except for Sunil Narine, none of the KKR bowlers managed to restrain the aggressive RCB lineup, raising concerns about the effectiveness of mystery spinner Varun Chakravarthy, who struggled significantly. Even on Eden Gardens' pitch, which had some grip, Chakravarthy was hit hard by Phil Salt and Virat Kohli.The KKR camp is hopeful that Chakravarthy will regain his form on a Guwahati pitch that typically offers more assistance to bowlers.The Barsapara Cricket Stadium in Guwahati has hosted four matches in IPL history - two in 2023 and two in 2024. The highest total at this ground came courtesy Rajasthan Royals who scored 199 against Delhi Capitals. The RR vs KKR fixture was washed out last year at this venue.Yashasvi Jaiswal, Sanju Samson, Riyan Parag(c), Nitish Rana, Dhruv Jurel(wk), Shimron Hetmyer, Shubham Dubey, Jofra Archer, Wanindu Hasaranga, Maheesh Theekshana, Tushar Deshpande, Sandeep Sharma, Akash Madhwal.Yudhvir Charak/Kunal Singh Rathore.Quinton de Kock (w), Sunil Narine, Ajinkya Rahane (c), Venkatesh Iyer, Angkrish Raghuvanshi, Rinku Singh, Andre Russell, Ramandeep Singh, Harshit Rana, Spencer Johnson, Varun Chakaravarthy.Vaibhav Arora/Manish Pandey.Sanju Samson (c), Yashasvi Jaiswal, Riyan Parag, Dhruv Jurel, Jofra Archer, Shimron Hetmyer, Tushar Deshpande, Wanindu Hasaranga, Maheesh Theekshana, Nitish Rana, Sandeep Sharma, Fazalhaq Farooqi, Kwena Maphaka, Akash Madhwal, Vaibhav Suryavanshi, Shubham Dubey, Yudhvir Singh, Kunal Singh Rathore, Ashok Sharma, Kumar KartikeyaRinku Singh, Varun Chakaravarthy, Sunil Narine, Andre Russell, Harshit Rana, Ramandeep Singh, Venkatesh Iyer, Quinton de Kock, Rahmanullah Gurbaz, Anrich Nortje, Angkrish Raghuvanshi, Vaibhav Arora, Mayank Markande, Rovman Powell, Manish Pandey, Spencer Johnson, Luvnith Sisodia, Ajinkya Rahane (c), Anukul Roy, Moeen Ali, Chetan SakariyaAs the RR vs KKR head-to-head record reads, the two teams have played each other 30 times in the IPL, with the Royals and the Knight Riders winning 14 each.

NEW DELHI: Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) ended a 17-year winless streak at Chepauk with a dominant 50-run victory over Chennai Super Kings (CSK) in Friday's IPL match. RCB posted a competitive 196/7, with Rajat Patidar leading the charge with a fortuitous 51 runs off 32 balls, supported by Tim David’s late blitz (22* off 8 balls).Despite early fireworks from Phil Salt (32 off 16 balls) and Devdutt Padikkal (27 off 14 balls), RCB struggled in the middle overs, but Patidar’s knock and David’s late hitting propelled them to a solid total.CSK’s chase never gained momentum as they crumbled to 146/8, with key wickets falling early. Josh Hazlewood was the standout performer with the ball, claiming 3/21, including the vital scalps of Rahul Tripathi and Ruturaj Gaikwad, reducing CSK to 8/3 within the first two overs.Bhuvneshwar Kumar (1/20) also contributed, dismissing Deepak Hooda.Though Rachin Ravindra (41 off 31 balls) and Sam Curran (8) tried to stabilize, the required run rate surged, and wickets fell at regular intervals. Curran was dismissed by Liam Livingstone, and Ravindra was bowled out by Yash Dayal (2/18), who also removed Shivam Dube (19).CSK’s decision to send Ravichandran Ashwin instead of MS Dhoni at this stage signaled their lack of fight. Dhoni’s 30* off 16 balls, including 2 sixes, was a mere consolation.RCB’s bowlers, including Livingstone and Dayal, tightened the screws, and an outstanding performance from Impact Sub Suyash Sharma (4-0-32-0) kept CSK under control.Patidar’s fortunate fifty and Hazlewood's destructive spell were key to RCB’s historic win, marking a rare defeat for CSK at home and a memorable victory for RCB.","Royal challengers bengaluru (rcb) ended a 17-year winless streak at chepauk with a dominant 50-run victory over chennai super kings (csk) in friday's ipl match.

Watch Dhoni's Magic:

NEW DELHI: At 43, Mahendra Singh Dhoni continues to showcase why he is one of the greatest wicketkeepers in cricket history. In Chennai Super Kings' (CSK) high-voltage IPL 2025 clash against Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) on Friday, Dhoni's incredible reflexes behind the stumps cut short Phil Salt 's blazing innings, leaving fans in awe.Salt, who was in terrific form, had raced to 32 off just 16 balls, smashing five fours and a six. However, his attacking stay at the crease was abruptly ended by Dhoni's sheer brilliance.Also see: CSK vs RCB Live Score Facing a well-disguised googly from Noor Ahmad , Salt attempted a drive but was beaten by the turn. As he momentarily lifted his back foot while trying to regain balance, Dhoni — faster than a blink — whipped off the bails in a flash.The decision was sent upstairs, and replays confirmed what everyone suspected — Salt's foot was in the air when Dhoni executed the dismissal. The MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai erupted as yet another Dhoni masterclass was added to his long list of iconic stumpings.This moment echoed Dhoni's brilliance from CSK's season opener against Mumbai Indians, where he had stunned Suryakumar Yadav with an equally breathtaking stumping. The 43-year-old legend, despite his age, continues to outshine younger wicketkeepers with his unmatched agility and sharp cricketing brain.With every such moment, Dhoni reinforces his status as a generational wicketkeeping genius, proving that in his case, age is just a number.","Ms dhoni's incredible reflexes behind the stumps cut short phil salt's blazing innings.
