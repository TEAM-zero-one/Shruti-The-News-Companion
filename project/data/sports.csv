Chloe Kim and Myles Garrett reveal romance built on support, history-making sports moments, and heartfelt poetry

Love, sports, and a quiet sweet moment came together when Chloe Kim and Myles Garrett shared a touching story this week. The Olympic snowboarder stood beside the Cleveland Browns star during his Sports Illustrated interview, and what happened next surprised many fans. Garrett, known for power and fierce play on the football field, showed a soft and emotional side away from the game.When the interviewer asked him to read his poetry, Kim handed him her phone. Garrett then read lines he had written just for her. The moment quickly became one of the most talked-about relationship stories in sports, reminding fans that even the toughest athletes carry deep feelings off the field.Garrett read the poem aloud, saying, “You enrapture fools to kings, and exist without a peer, put on this Earth for many things, but our love is why you’re here.” The quiet words showed a very different side of the NFL sack leader.Kim later shared that the poem felt deeply personal. She said it was sweet and emotional, and admitted it made her cry when she first read it. The simple gesture showed how strong their bond has become since they made their relationship public in November 2025 after months of rumors.Since then, the two athletes have supported each other at major moments. Kim, 25, has been seen on the sidelines at Browns games, including a viral pre-game kiss that fans loved.She also watched Garrett, 30, create history this season by recording 23 sacks, setting a new league record.Garrett has shown the same support in return. Kim went to support her friend Garrett as he earned a Silver Medal for his performance in the Winter Olympics last month. Kim received an 88.00 in her event, which included a backside 720 and inverted 540 to finish the run. Attending each other’s major events shows the bond of mutual admiration and pride that these two athletes share and their ability to achieve success together.","Chloe kim and myles garrett reveal romance built on support, history-making sports moments, and heartfelt poetry.

Franchise anchor, but unrealistic dream





Themade a major roster move in early February 2026, trading for. Golden State sent Jonathan Kuminga and Buddy Hield to Atlanta, signaling a clear shift toward competing now rather than building for the future.Porzingis has started adjusting to a lineup that includes Stephen Curry, Draymond Green, and Jimmy Butler. His arrival has led to questions around the league about how much he can change the team’s outlook and whether the risk attached to his health is worth it.General manager Mike Dunleavy pursued Porzingis to improve scoring and spacing in the frontcourt after Jimmy Butler suffered a season-ending injury. The trade became official on February 4 and reflected urgency from a team still focused on the playoffs.Letting go of Kuminga meant losing a young forward with long-term upside, while Hield’s departure removed reliable outside shooting. The Warriors accepted that cost to add a skilled seven-footer with prior championship experience in Boston.Porzingis came off the bench in his debut and has shared minutes with Quinten Post and Al Horford as the coaching staff works through rotations.Since the trade, Kristaps Porzingis has averaged about 17-20 points per game, hit over 40 percent of his threes in some appearances, collected 8-10 rebounds, and offered rim protection despite limited playing time.He can shoot from deep, which works well alongside Curry’s constant movement and long-range shooting. Defenses have to spread out to cover both of them, and that opens up room for everyone else. That extra space could make it easier for the team to adjust while Butler is out.The concern is availability. Porzingis has played only a handful of games since the deal, and his injury history remains part of any evaluation. He is also 30, which adds to the debate about long-term value.Porzingis is known for his ability to shoot from distance and protect the rim, and he has hit over 35 percent of his three-point attempts in his career. Some critics, though, question his consistency on defense and point to his injury record when calling him overrated.Before the trade, he averaged 17.1 points and 5.1 rebounds on efficient shooting. Some analysts have placed him among the league’s most overrated players due to declining athleticism. The Warriors are not expecting a franchise-level star, but rather a player who can raise their ceiling without forcing a full roster reset.Golden State Warriors had been linked to Giannis Antetokounmpo , but no trade developed. He publicly committed to Milwaukee, where he continues to play alongside his brothers Thanasis and Alex on a team sitting around the middle of the standings.With that option gone, the Warriors turned to a more realistic addition in Porzingis.Porzingis is not the star Golden State once hoped to land, but he gives them size, shooting, and lineup flexibility. If he stays on the court, the trade could help their postseason chances. If not, the decision to move young talent will face stronger scrutiny.","Kristaps porzingis is averaging 17.1 points, 5.1 rebounds, and 2.7 assists.

Sean Strickland turns media day into a rant about Bad Bunny and the NFL

Misogynistic shots at women’s sports put more pressure on Sean Strickland and Paramount+

Bad Bunny just delivered one of the biggest halftime audiences in Super Bowl history. Sean Strickland still turned him into a target.During a Paramount+ and UFC media day ahead of his fight with Anthony Hernandez, the former UFC middleweight champion went on a sexist, homophobic tirade that circled from women’s sports to the NFL’s Super Bowl LX halftime show and Bad Bunny’s spot on that stage.Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, Strickland unloaded on the NFL’s decision to put the Puerto Rican star at the center of this year’s halftime show at Levi’s Stadium.“Look at the NFL, dude. I don't even want to say the f***t's name because it's just like, somebody give me his name... You know what I'm talking about, the halftime show guy. The Puerto Rican, right? Puerto Rican? Yeah, that f**king f***t. It's so crazy that this is America now.”From there, he framed the league as something that had walked away from what he calls “being a man.”“Like, back in the day, the NFL was the f**king standard of being a f**king man, and now every f**king year, the NFL, I think they all get together around a table and say, ‘You know what, guys? How do we f**king ruin this sport? How do we gy it up? How do we f*cking ruin it? Well, I'll tell you what. Why don't we bring a gy foreigner who doesn't speak f**king English and have him perform it?’”Bad Bunny’s Super Bowl LX halftime show averaged roughly 128 million viewers, with the game itself pulling about 125 million, according to recent broadcast figures.The NFL has been aggressive about using global music stars to grow the audience. Strickland’s problem is not the ratings. It is the idea of a Spanish-speaking Latin pop and reggaeton artist being the face of the league’s biggest night.The comments also ignore a basic detail about the man he is attacking. Puerto Ricans are American citizens. That did not stop Strickland from labeling Bad Bunny a “foreigner” in the middle of a rant about what the NFL represents.Bad Bunny was not the only target. As reported by Variety’s Jack Dunn, Strickland also went at Ronda Rousey, Gina Carano, and women’s sports in general while promoting a Netflix MMA event.“Ronda Rousey can fight,” Strickland said. “That bitch can fight… I think she lost a few fights to her ex, but bitch can fight.”On Carano, he kept the focus on her looks instead of her fighting career. “I like Gina. She’s like super conservative. She was hot, you know. I was like a kid when she fought. I may have jerked off to her once or twice back in the day.”Then he went broad. “No one gives a fuck about women’s sports,” Strickland said, before adding that women “cook” and “clean” and claiming they have been empowered “too much” and “ruined society.”This is the same fighter who was suspended by the UFC in July 2025 after attacking another fighter while working as a cornerman. Now he is back in a main promotional window at a time when Paramount+ has a seven-year, multibillion-dollar rights deal to be the exclusive home of UFC events in the United States.The blowback has started. Former NFL quarterback Robert Griffin III called him out on X after the Bad Bunny comments.“Sean Strickland got hit so hard by a foreigner that he forgot Puerto Ricans are US citizens,” Griffin wrote. “Not to mention that this misogynistic cry baby would get tossed like salad if he ever stepped foot on a football field in the NFL. Worry about not getting knocked out in your next fight.”For the NFL, Bad Bunny’s halftime show was a numbers win. For Paramount+ and the UFC, Strickland’s latest microphone moment is a test of how much bigoted noise they are willing to live with from one of their most volatile names.","Sean strickland turned media day into a rant about bad bunny and the nfl.

Islam Makhachev says Michael Morales is a bigger threat than Ilia Topuria



Welterweight champion Islam Makhachev has played down the threat of Ilia Topuria moving up in weight to challenge him. Topuria recently became lightweight champion after knocking out Charles Oliveira at UFC 317. The Spaniard is now aiming to become the first fighter in UFC history to win titles in three weight divisions. However, Makhachev believes Topuria’s knockout power may not carry the same impact at 170 pounds.Topuria is expected to face interim lightweight champion Justin Gaethje in a title unification bout at a UFC event at the White House on June 14. Before any move to welterweight, he must get past Gaethje. Meanwhile, Makhachev has suggested that other welterweight contenders, including rising star Michael Morales, present a greater danger inside the Octagon.Speaking recently, Islam Makhachev claimed that Michael Morales is a far more dangerous striker at the welterweight division.Islam Makhachev explained that, in his view, Michael Morales carries far more knockout danger. He said Morales can finish opponents with almost every clean punch he lands. He added that Ilia Topuria may not have the same impact at 170 pounds because the division features bigger, taller, and stronger athletes.According to Makhachev, welterweights would find it easier to deal with Topuria, and he does not believe Topuria would pose a serious threat if he moved up.Makhachev had earlier hinted that he could fight Topuria in Washington, D.C., but later clarified that his first welterweight title defense will likely come against a current contender in the division.For now, Topuria’s focus remains on Gaethje. His coach, Javi Clement, is confident of a quick finish.Javi Clement expressed total confidence in Topuria’s ability to stop Justin Gaethje early in the possible White House UFC card. He said the fight would definitely end in the first round and likely in the opening exchange. Clement insisted that once Topuria lands cleanly, opponents cannot keep moving forward. He warned that if Gaethje tries to pressure recklessly, he could face the same outcome as Oliveira. Clement also mentioned that Gaethje has technical flaws that have already been studied, and those mistakes could prove costly on fight night.For now, all eyes will be on Ilia Topuria and Justin Gaethje’s possible bout.",Welterweight champion islam makhachev has played down the threat of ilia topuria moving up in weight to challenge him.

Stephen Curry's 2026 NBA All-Star Press Conference

How Stephen Curry's absence will impact the Warriors

It was expected that the Golden State Warriors (29-26) would return from the All-Star break with Stephen Curry to face the Boston Celtics (35-19) at Chase Center on February 19th. But they will have to play without their offensive cornerstone, as he continues to nurse a persistent knee injury.The 2-time MVP’s absence marks a critical blow for Warriors, as they are currently 8th in the West, and are fighting to avoid the Play-In Tournament. While Curry needed this break to provide a window for rest and recovery, the team’s heavy dependence on him for scoring remains a point of concern. The franchise’s medical staff is cautious with the 37-year-old’s health, as they need him in his optimal condition to make the most out of his talents on the court.Stephen Curry is dealing with knee cap soreness, also known as runner's knee, and due to this, he hasn’t appeared in a game since January 30th, and was also forced to withdraw from the 2026 NBA All-Star Game, his 12th All-Star appearance.Curry told ESPN, ""You have to try to get rid of all the inflammation and pain. It's something we still have to monitor and injury-manage, but it's something where, if I come back too early, it could flare up.""Even Steve Kerr emphasized being “certain” with the injury, as they require Curry to come back completely healed. He stated, “We've got to be certain. He's got to be certain. It is a little nebulous, but that's the nature of the injury.""The game against the Celtics will be Curry’s sixth consecutive game that he has missed and 17th of this season. The baby-faced assassin has played in 39 games so far and has averaged 27.2 points, 4.8 assists, and 3.5 rebounds, while shooting 39.1% from beyond the arc and 46.8% from the floor.According to StatMuse, the Warriors currently have a 6-10 record without Stephen Curry. They have an offensive rating of 119.3 with Curry on the court, but it drops to roughly 106.4 without him, while the shooting efficiency from the floor also drops from 47.5% to 42.7% and from 45.4% to 44.2% from deep.The Warriors are already without Jimmy Butler (season-ending ACL tear) and Seth Curry (sciatica). However, there is a silver lining: Kristaps Porzingis. Acquired in a blockbuster deadline trade for Jonathan Kuminga and Buddy Hield, Porzingis is expected to make his Warriors debut tonight while providing a much-needed interior gravity at the post-up.The Celtics have a 113.5 defensive rating this season, and have been able to limit their opponents to just 108.4 PPG. Without Stephen Curry, the Warriors will struggle offensively, but the team has maintained a solid defense this season and has the 9th-best defensive rating of 113.5%.",Golden state warriors face boston celtics at chase center on february 19th.

Logan Stanley remains an important part of the Winnipeg Jets despite raising doubts

Winnipeg Jets defenseman Logan Stanley made his priorities clear as the March 6 trade deadline approaches. The pending unrestricted free agent wants to remain with the organization that drafted him, despite widespread speculation linking him to contending teams seeking defensive depth.Stanley's stance represents a significant development for Winnipeg's front office. The 27-year-old has emerged as one of the most talked-about trade candidates after posting career-best numbers through 55 games.Stanley’s combination of size, affordability, and playoff experience makes him attractive to teams chasing postseason berths. Ken Wiebe of the Winnipeg Free Press reported Wednesday that Stanley indicated his desire to stay with the Jets.The 6’7” D-man added that contract discussions between his representatives and Winnipeg management are expected in the coming days before he returns to game action. Stanley recorded 18 points this season while taking on increased responsibilities along Winnipeg's blue line.He is already proving this season is different, as he had never even crossed five points in any season since the Jets picked him 18th overall in the first round of the 2016 NHL Draft.His frame has since made him an imposing figure on the blue line, and many teams want him on their back line.For teams that are looking for a deep playoff run, Stanley’s frame provides exactly the type of player they need on their defensive unit. Meanwhile, the sudden increase in points does make a better case for the Jets to keep him on the roster.This breakout performance also gives him the chance to bag a better deal and perhaps even win the championship itself. The upcoming contract discussions introduce an intriguing decision for Winnipeg's front office. Moving him could net future assets in a seller's market hungry for size and defensive depth.But while it does give them a chance to bring some new names to the team, keeping Stanley will make sure that their blue line remains steady. The blueliner has already proved his loyalty to the organization, so at this point it remains upto GM Kevin Cheveldayoff to make the final decision.The Jets could focus on other areas of need while maintaining stability on the back end. They already sit 28th overall in the NHL standings with a 22-25-8 record through the Olympic break and trail the Western Conference playoff race by eight points with 27 games remaining after play resumes February 24.The organization faces critical decisions about its direction heading into the deadline. While keeping the imposing D-man would mean that the Jets still have their playoff dreams alive, for now, it seems hard to realistically secure the postseason. Till then, the management still has 2 more weeks to think.",Winnipeg jets defenseman logan stanley made his priorities clear as the march 6 trade deadline approaches.

Cooper Flagg’s debut jersey sets a new NBA auction benchmark

Victor Wembanyama’s record falls as the market accelerates

Basketball shoes and jerseys have generally only traded for five figures through NBA Auctions, but the market has officially taken a serious step up this week with Cooper Flagg's game-worn jersey from his professional debut selling for an incredible $1 million, a new record for the highest price a jersey has ever sold for via NBA Auctions. It broke the previous record of $762,000 for Victor Wembanyama's first jersey, which was sold in 2023, and shows that there is no shortage of people wanting to buy rookie memorabilia that will be remembered for years to come.Now one of the most expensive pieces of modern basketball memorabilia, the jersey was worn by Flagg in the first half of his NBA regular-season debut with the Dallas Mavericks. The finding underscores how a single moment, particularly one that's connected to the debut of a top prospect on the league's biggest stage, can transform the economics of sports memorabilia and offer clues to evolving collector preferences.On October 22, 2025, Cooper Flagg wore the record-setting jersey for his NBA debut against the San Antonio Spurs. The 19-year-old forward made his mark from the outset with 10 points and 10 rebounds in that game, showcasing the well-rounded talent that has made him one of the most highly touted rookies in years. The jersey was game-worn and photo-matched to the opening half of the contest, both features that elevate the price.Officials at the auction say that some collectors are more interested in pieces linked to specific ""firsts"" and ""first moments,"" and in particular, players whom they view as future franchise cornerstones. In a sport where only all-time legends can push memorabilia past seven figures, Flagg's early career appearances and marketability helped to drive the jersey's final price into seven-figure territory.The sale broke the previous record in NBA Auctions, which was for a San Antonio Spurs debut jersey for Victor Wembanyama that sold for $762,000 in 2023. Wembanyama's jersey was seen as modern memorabilia, but probably not at this scale, given the world's strong interest in the generational center. It is a tip of the hat to that inevitable upward trajectory in player and, in turn, collector confidence in elite young talent. Flagg’s jersey now represents that evolutionary next step in that trend.But in the eyes of industry observers, the increase from $762,000 to $1 million in only two years is another indicator of how fast the market is booming, particularly for items authenticated as game-worn, with provenance clearly established. Flagg’s sale has already had auction houses ready for a spike in future rookie-debut jerseys.","Dallas mavericks rookie cooper flagg's game-worn debut jersey sells for $1 million.

Frank Martin has shared an emotional message for Anthony Joshua during one of the hardest moments of the former heavyweight champion’s life. Joshua was involved in a fatal car crash in Nigeria on December 29, just ten days after his win over Jake Paul. While Joshua survived, two of his close friends and long-time team members, Kevin Latif “Latz” Ayodele and Sina Ghami, sadly lost their lives.The accident happened while Joshua was in Nigeria after Christmas celebrations.

Now, Martin, who once trained alongside Joshua, has spoken openly about reaching out with his condolences during this painful time.Martin, 31, previously trained with Joshua, 36, under coach Derrick James in Dallas. Speaking to SunSport, Martin explained how he tried to contact Joshua after the tragic news.He said, “I reached out to him, but I didn’t get a response. But I reached out to some of the other guys who are around him and I sent my condolences to the friends and the families.”Joshua is still mourning the loss of his schoolfriend Latz and recovery therapist Ghami. Many fighters and fans across the world have continued to show support as he deals with the heartbreaking loss.Martin is also preparing for his own important fight. He returns to the ring on Saturday against Nahir Albright, live on DAZN PPV. The American super lightweight is focused but understands how quickly life can change.He was stopped by Gervonta Davis in 2024, a loss that many believed would slow him down. Instead, Martin moved up to 140 pounds in December and knocked out Rances Barthelemy in strong fashion.Looking back at that tough period, Martin said, “I feel like a lot of people counted me out. But I knew what was going on and with that fight and even outside of that, how I was gonna come back.”He added, “I’m not the type of fighter to take a loss and think it’s over for me. I gotta get back up. It’s like you gotta get back up, so I knew just me staying focused and getting back in the gym and fixing things to make myself better as a fighter.”While Martin prepares for his next bout, his thoughts remain with Joshua and the families affected. In boxing, strength is not only shown in the ring, but also in moments of grief and support.","Frank martin sends heartfelt condolences to anthony joshua after tragic nigeria car crash claims two close friends.

Painful injury nearly ended Adele Nicoll’s Winter Olympics hopes



Adele Nicoll feared her Olympic dream had ended just five months ago after a frightening knee injury during training. The British athlete tore ligaments and could barely walk. Today, the 29-year-old is competing at the Winter Games in Cortina. She has qualified for the monobob and will also pilot the two-woman bobsleigh with former sprinter Ashleigh Nelson. Her recovery has surprised many, as she only recently stopped using crutches.Nicoll is also a three-time women’s shot put champion. Balancing summer and winter sports has made her journey unusual. She finished 18th in the monobob, becoming the first British athlete in that event. Despite the pain and long rehab, she says she now feels fully fit. The Welsh athlete is even considering competing in shot put at the upcoming Glasgow Commonwealth Games.Adele Nicoll explained that the accident happened during a track training run. Her new spikes stuck in the surface while her body kept moving forward, forcing her knee backward. She remembered shouting loudly at the moment of injury, saying the reaction came mainly from shock and fear that she would miss the Olympics rather than from the pain itself.The damage was severe. She suffered a ligament tear at the back of the knee, capsule damage, a small tibia fracture, bone bruising, and strains to both ACL and LCL. She could not put weight on the leg. For weeks she relied on a brace and crutches. Speaking to The Sun , she admitted the timing felt terrible and emotionally overwhelming, but she decided the only solution was total focus on recovery and disciplined daily decisions.Doctors warned her that rushing could create long-term problems, so the team chose a slow and careful plan. She said she is thankful for the support around her because proper rehab allowed her to arrive in Cortina healthy and ready.Nicoll believes her long-term future is in bobsleigh but still hopes to achieve as much as possible in both sports. She carefully manages body weight due to racing limits. She previously lost about 20 kilograms for bobsleigh and discovered her throwing distance improved because power mattered more than body mass. For now, she plans to continue both sports while staying strong and properly fuelled.","Adele nicoll feared her olympic dream had ended just five months ago.

How Suryakumar Yadav and Tilak Varma are hurting India | T20 World Cup

Game on hai

Veteran Pakistan pacer Mohammad Amir has issued a stern warning to India opener Abhishek Sharma after the batter registered three consecutive ducks at the start of the T20 World Cup 2026. Before India’s high-profile clash with Pakistan last Sunday in Colombo, Amir had labelled Abhishek a “slogger,” and the batter’s early struggles have now drawn further scrutiny.In India’s final Group A match against the Netherlands on Wednesday, Abhishek fell on the third ball of the first over to Aryan Dutt. Trying to play a pull shot, he was beaten by the pace as the ball skidded through and hit the stumps. This dismissal marked his third duck in as many games, with just eight deliveries faced across the three matches.With this, Abhishek equalled the record for the most ducks by an Indian in T20 World Cups, joining Ashish Nehra. Pakistan’s Shahid Afridi and Sri Lanka’s Tillakaratne Dilshan top the overall list with five ducks each.Speaking on the Pakistani show, Amir drew parallels between Abhishek’s early struggles and those faced by Pakistan opener Saim Ayub during his initial PSL campaigns. He stressed that young batters are quickly tested by quality bowlers who spot technical flaws.“Saim had the same issue when he came to play the PSL a few years back. He was new and was hitting no-look shots. Nobody knew his weakness because most of his shots were on the leg side.Now, if you bowl at the third or fourth stump line, he struggles to decide. Even in his last two matches, he was dismissed playing on the off side. Unless he improves his off-side game, he cannot progress. Strong bowlers will always test your weakness and push you out of your comfort zone,” Amir said.He added specifically about Abhishek: “Same for Abhishek. He wants every ball in the slot so he can hit. But at the bigger stages, or in ODIs, har ball lapete mein nahi le sakte (you cannot slog every ball in pressure cricket). Salman Agha and Aryan Dutt got him out in similar fashion.
