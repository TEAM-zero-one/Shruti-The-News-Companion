NEW DELHI: Congress leader Tikaram Jully on Thursday sparked outrage by referring to veteran Bollywood actress Madhuri Dixit as a ""second-grade star"" who is ""past her prime.""Jully made the remark during a discussion in Rajasthan assembly where the Congress leader questioned the benefit of recently-held IIFA event to the state. He also questioned government's expenditure, saying, ""In the name of IIFA, over Rs 100 crore of public money was spent. If you saw the hoardings, it was only a promotion of IIFA and not of Rajasthan.""""What did Rajasthan get from IIFA? The stars who came for the event did not visit any tourist place in the state,"" Jully said.""And which big name from the industry appeared? Apart from Shah Rukh Khan, all others were second-grade stars. No other first-grade actor came,"" he added.When house members objected to his comments, Jully further stated, ""Now, Madhuri Dixit is a second-grade star, her prime has gone. She was a star in the times of her movies like 'Dil' and 'Beta'.""BJP MLA Balmukund Acharya defended the event's importance, highlighting that ""Rajasthan hosted an event of IIFA's stature, which usually takes place in mega cities across the world."" He highlighted the global exposure and tourism benefits the event brought to the state.This controversy follows another recent incident involving Congress spokesperson Shama Mohamed, who faced criticism for making derogatory remarks about Indian cricket captain Rohit Sharma on social media.In a now-deleted tweet, she wrote, ""Fat for a sportsman! And of course, the most unimpressive captain India has ever had!""She later retracted her comments and congratulated the team following India's Champions Trophy victory.","Congress leader tikaram jully sparked outrage by referring to veteran bollywood actress madhuri dixit as a ""second-grade star"" who is ""past her prime"" jully made the remark during a discussion in rajasthan assembly where the congress leader questioned the benefit of recently-held iifa event.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118973763,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1049194,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Bengals Allow Trey Hendrickson to Seek Trade Despite His Dominant Season





Protecting Joe Burrow: The Bengals’ Clear Priority

Fans React to the Bengals' Game-Changing Strategy

The Cincinnati Bengals are making waves in the NFL offseason, and the latest buzz has fans on edge — Trey Hendrickson , the team's defensive juggernaut, has been given the green light to explore trade options. It’s a move that's got everyone talking, as the Bengals seem to be weighing their defensive star’s future while keeping one eye firmly on Joe Burrow ’s protection.Trey Hendrickson has been nothing short of a game-changer for the Bengals' defense. Known for his relentless pass-rushing and league-leading sack numbers last season, Hendrickson was a cornerstone of Cincinnati’s defensive unit. When rumors of a potential trade began swirling, many dismissed them — after all, why would the Bengals part ways with a player of his caliber?But the unexpected happened. The team has now given Hendrickson permission to seek a trade, reportedly asking for a first-round pick in return. It’s a stunning shift that suggests the Bengals are open to reshaping their roster — but at what cost?The Bengals have long faced criticism for failing to adequately protect their franchise quarterback, with his injury history a constant concern. Recent free agency moves, including re-signing Joseph Ossai and adding linebacker Oren Burks, hint at a broader plan to balance both sides of the ball.This isn’t just about defense versus offense — it’s about ensuring Burrow stays upright and healthy for a shot at postseason glory. The Bengals appear willing to make bold moves if it means securing their QB's future.The move has sparked debate among fans and analysts alike. While some understand the logic — a healthy Burrow is essential for playoff dreams — others question the cost of letting a sack leader walk away.Naturally, fans are split. Social media is buzzing with takes, from those urging the team to keep their sack leader to others trusting the front office’s long-term vision.As the 2025 season looms, all eyes are on the Bengals’ next moveAlso read - Fans Rally Behind Tua Tagovailoa After 'Dad Bod' Yacht Photos Go Viral — 'Let the Man Relax",Trey hendrickson has been given the green light to explore trade options.

The Los Angeles Lakers , despite not being the outright favorites in the Western Conference, remain strong contenders with stars like LeBron James and Luka Doncic leading the charge.

As the offseason approaches, rumors are swirling about a potential reunion between LeBron James and a former MVP who could add depth to the Lakers’ roster.Russell Westbrook , the $7 million guard, is the name in question. Westbrook, who spent 11 seasons with the Oklahoma City Thunder and had brief stints with the Houston Rockets, Washington Wizards, and Los Angeles Lakers , could be on his way back to Los Angeles. His first tenure with the Lakers in 2021 was marked by high energy but also criticism for his inability to adapt to a winning style of play.

Paul Goldschmidt opened up about his time at Cardinals

Paul Goldschmidt with Meredith Marakovits

""I loved it there. I’ve got nothing bad to say about the organization—the fans were amazing, everything was great. We had high expectations, just like we do here in New York. We wanted to win a World Series, and we didn’t do it, so that will always stick with me as a disappointment. But so many great memories and just a great time overall.""

Details into Paul Goldschmidt's impressive MLB career

It has been more than a decade since Paul Goldschmidt played in the league. Over his career, Goldschmidt has played with three teams. Currently signed with the New York Yankees , Goldschmidt was previously playing with the St. Louis Cardinals for six long seasons.

Moving further, Goldschmidt talked about it in detail, and said:Paul Goldschmidt started his MLB career with the Arizona Diamondbacks in 2009 when the team signed him for $95,000. In 2011, the Diamondbacks and Goldschmidt agreed upon a pre-arbitration agreement worth $414,000, followed by another pre-arbitration deal in 2012 worth $452,000.In 2013, Goldschmidt signed one more pre-arbitration deal with the Diamondbacks worth $500,000, followed by an extension worth $52 Million for 5 years.

Jack Eichel created history with the most points in a single season for the Vegas Golden Knights franchise.

Marchessault achieved 75 points during his first season as Vegas joined the NHL in 2017–2018.Eichel achieves career-high productivity in this season because he surpasses numerous personal and franchise records.

Steve Kerr Explains Why He Told Jimmy Butler to Break NBA’s Unwritten Rule

Jimmy Butler’s Triple-Double Overshadowed by Controversial Shot

Jimmy Butler single handedly forces a shot clock violation

Gary Payton II Scores Career-High 26 Points to Lead Golden State Warriors to Victory

What should have been a straightforward win for the Warriors turned into a mess after the game. Jimmy Butler 's triple-double was overshadowed by a last-second shot that really upset the Portland Trail Blazers players — and it looked like it got under Butler's skin too. A video from after the game showed a tense moment between him and coach Steve Kerr , who later revealed he was the one who told Butler to take that shot. Here’s the whole story behind that unexpected twist.As the clock wound down in the Warriors' 130-120 win over the Portland Trail Blazers, Jimmy Butler was in a bit of a bind. With Golden State comfortably ahead and only a few ticks left, he had to choose between holding the ball or taking a shot. Usually, teams would just let the clock run out in these moments. But after a quick glance at Steve Kerr on the sideline, Butler decided to take an open jumper, which ruffled a few feathers among the Trail Blazers players.Footage from after the game showed Jimmy Butler frustrated during a brief but intense talk with Steve Kerr. Kerr later explained his reasoning, saying, “I told him, we don't do shot clock violations. If there’s a shot clock differential, we always shoot.” Kerr’s firm stance on this philosophy put Butler in a tricky situation, even though he seemed a little reluctant on the court.Butler had a standout performance that evening! He scored 15 points, pulled down 10 rebounds, and tallied 10 assists, marking his second triple-double this season and his first as a Warrior. His previous triple-double was on December 16 while he was with the Miami Heat. The Warriors are sitting pretty with a 12-1 record when Butler plays, highlighting his significant role in their success.While all this is happening, Stephen Curry keeps shining this season, hitting five 3-pointers and bringing his total to 251. This is his 11th season with 250+ threes, which is an NBA record. He’s just two 3-pointers away from being the first player to hit 4,000 career triples.Even with the fuss going on, the Warriors' depth was a key factor in their victory. Gary Payton II had an impressive night, scoring a career-high 26 points and tying his record with four 3-pointers. Buddy Hield also made his mark with six 3-pointers and 20 points, showing off the Warriors' strong offensive lineup.The arguments between Jimmy Butler and Steve Kerr after the game definitely caught some attention, but it doesn't take away from how well the Warriors played. With Stephen Curry on the verge of hitting a major milestone and Butler stepping up with his all-around skills, Golden State is proving they're a force to be reckoned with.Also Read - Shai Gilgeous-Alexander vs Nikola Jokic: Who Truly Deserves the 2025 NBA MVP?

NEW DELHI: Yuzvendra Chahal is set to return to Northamptonshire for the 2025 County Championship season after impressing during his stint with the club in 2024.

According to ESPN, the veteran quarterback has agreed to a two-year contract worth $8 million, with $4.5 million guaranteed.Rudolph, who previously spent several seasons with the Steelers, was a reliable backup and occasional starter during his first stint with the team. Last season, he explored his options in free agency and had interest from multiple teams, including the Tennessee Titans. However, after considering his opportunities, he ultimately decided to reunite with the Steelers.Also Read: Buccaneers sign ex-Lions CB Kindle Vildor in new deal The return of Mason Rudolph provides Pittsburgh with stability at the quarterback position, particularly as the team looks to navigate the challenges of the upcoming season.
