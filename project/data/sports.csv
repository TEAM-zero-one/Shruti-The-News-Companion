Ja’Marr Chase suspension could sideline star receiver for Week 12 Bengals vs Patriots game



More coverage in NFL:

The Bengals-Steelers clash on Sunday left the NFL world talking, not just about the score but about a heated on-field altercation. Steelers cornerback Jalen Ramsey was ejected for punching Bengals star Ja’Marr Chase, but footage suggests Chase may have provoked the fight by spitting on Ramsey. The incident now puts Chase’s availability for Week 12 in serious jeopardy.Cincinnati could be without its top receiver in a crucial matchup against the New England Patriots. Losing Chase would be a massive blow to the Bengals’ offense, forcing quarterback Joe Burrow and the coaching staff to adjust their game plan. The NFL has clear precedent for punishing spitting incidents, making a suspension a real possibility.The NFL is reviewing the incident, with a ruling expected soon. Ramsey claimed Chase provoked him by spitting, though officials did not see the act during the game. Replay footage, however, appears to support Ramsey’s account. Previously, Philadelphia Eagles defensive tackle Jalen Carter was ejected for spitting, and the league treated that as a one-game suspension equivalent. Experts like Mike Florio note that when spitting is missed by officials during a game, a suspension without pay for the next game typically follows.On Sunday, only Ramsey’s retaliatory punch was seen by officials, leaving the NFL to impose potential discipline after the fact. Even if Chase’s act had been caught, the timing late in the game would have made an in-game ejection insufficient. A suspension would mean the Bengals face the Patriots without their top receiving threat, complicating game plans and potentially affecting playoff positioning.Chase has denied the allegations, stating, “I didn't spit on nobody,” while referee Bill Vinovich confirmed his crew did not witness the alleged act. Still, video evidence and Ramsey’s statements make a strong case for league discipline. The NFL’s decision could have major implications for the Bengals’ offensive strategy in Week 12 and influence the team’s positioning in the AFC playoff race. A suspension for Chase would leave Cincinnati without its top receiving threat, forcing adjustments to Joe Burrow’s game plan. The ruling could also set a precedent for how the league handles similar incidents in the future.","Ja’marr chase could miss week 12 after spitting incident.

Interest grows inside the Steelers community as WAGs admit they still haven’t met Aaron Rodgers’ wife

More coverage on NFL:

Aaron Rodgers has brought plenty of intrigue to Pittsburgh this season, and surprisingly, not all of it has to do with football. As the 41-year-old quarterback leads the Steelers through a competitive AFC North race, fans and teammates alike have been buzzing about something completely unrelated to passing yards or touchdowns, the identity of his elusive wife, Brittani.Rodgers stunned the NFL world earlier this year when he casually revealed he got married “a couple months ago,” yet offered no details about the ceremony or his spouse. Months into the season, the mystery remains unsolved, turning Brittani into one of the most talked-about topics around the Steelers’ facility.Rodgers’ performance this season has been strong, with 1,853 passing yards and 18 touchdowns, helping the Steelers sit atop the AFC North with a 5-4 record. But while fans are focused on his comeback and playoff push, those close to the team say an entirely different curiosity is dominating conversations behind the scenes.Rodgers was first spotted wearing a wedding band during his inaugural practice with the Steelers, confirming rumors that he’d tied the knot shortly before joining the team. Since then, however, his wife has remained completely absent from public view, no game appearances, no social media presence, no accidental sightings.According to one unidentified Steelers WAG who spoke to the Daily Mail, “She’s like a phantom. We all want to meet her, to invite her out, get to know her. But we haven’t met her yet. We don’t even know who she is.”Rodgers has long been one of the league’s most private and polarizing stars, so it isn’t shocking that he and Brittani are choosing to stay out of the spotlight. The quarterback is no stranger to intense media scrutiny, and protecting his relationship may be a deliberate attempt to keep a part of his life untouched by the chaos of NFL fame.Still, with Rodgers thriving on the field, curiosity around the couple continues to grow. And unless Rodgers decides to share more, Brittani’s identity may remain one of the NFL’s most persistent and fascinating mysteries, one that even the Steelers’ own WAGs can’t crack.","Steelers quarterback aaron rodgers has sparked curiosity beyond the football field.

Is Victor Wembanyama alright?



What Victor Wembanyama’s absence from the court means for the San Antonio Spurs



The San Antonio Spurs were riding one of their strongest starts in recent memory, fueled by Victor Wembanyama’s explosive third-year leap. That momentum came to a sudden halt after the team confirmed the 21-year-old star had suffered a left calf strain, an injury that will keep him out for at least a few weeks.It’s a setback that hits the franchise at a time when Wembanyama was not only anchoring their surge up the standings but emerging as an early MVP contender. With San Antonio sitting comfortably in the upper tier of the Western Conference, his absence forces the team to recalibrate both expectations and rotations.The injury occurred during Friday’s matchup against Golden State, a game Wembanyama finished with 26 points and 12 rebounds despite discomfort. He was ruled out ahead of Sunday’s win over Sacramento, and further testing confirmed the team’s fears. For a player who has already dealt with significant setbacks in his young career, including last season’s lengthy layoff, this latest development places added pressure on a Spurs roster that leans heavily on his two-way production.The Spurs insist they are taking a cautious path, and early indications suggest the injury isn’t season-threatening.“Obviously, we’ve seen around this league recently, the calf-tightness thing is not something you want to take lightly,” Spurs coach Mitch Johnson said.“Don’t want to push it there.” Wembanyama underwent an MRI over the weekend, with the team revealing the left calf strain on Monday. ESPN reported he will be reevaluated in two to three weeks.Wembanyama’s numbers before the injury underline why the organization is proceeding carefully. He has averaged just over 26 points, nearly 13 rebounds, and a league-leading block rate while playing 35 minutes per game.Replacing Wembanyama’s impact on both ends is nearly impossible. Without him, the Spurs lose their focal point on offense and their most imposing defensive presence. Luke Kornet stepped in as the starting center Sunday and delivered a solid outing, while Kelly Olynyk is expected to absorb expanded minutes. Still, neither replicates the spacing, rim protection, or versatility Wembanyama provides.San Antonio must also monitor the ripple effects. The team is already dealing with a hip injury to Stephon Castle, further thinning the rotation. De’Aaron Fox and the bench unit will shoulder greater scoring and creation duties as the Spurs try to maintain their early-season pace.Also Read: Draymond Green confronts taunting fan after Angel Reese jeers push tensions to a boiling point","Victor wembanyama has been ruled out for at least a few weeks with a left calf strain.

Toronto Maple Leafs head coach Craig Berube hints Matthews may be behind schedule



More NHL coverage

Toronto Maple Leafs fans hoped this stretch of the season would bring clarity, but Craig Berube’s latest update has only raised more questions. The coach revealed that Auston Matthews may be further behind in his recovery than anyone expected. His comments have shifted the mood in Toronto, especially with the team already battling uneven form and a crowded injured list. The Leafs had counted on a quick turnaround for their superstar. Instead, the timeline looks blurry and the concern is growing by the day.Matthews has been sidelined since suffering a lower-body injury in the November 11 meeting with the Boston Bruins. Berube initially estimated that the forward would miss about a week, and the team placed him on injured reserve shortly after. That move meant Matthews could return by November 18 against the St. Louis Blues, but that target now appears doubtful. TSN’s Mark Masters reported that Berube told media on November 17 that Matthews has not even touched the ice since exiting the Bruins game. The coach did say a return against the Blues was still possible, but the tone surrounding the update has left fans uneasy.The forward’s injury history adds weight to this concern. He already missed significant time earlier in the 2024-25 season with an upper-body issue, continuing a trend that has limited him throughout his career.Matthews has played at least 75 regular-season games just once since his rookie year in 2016-17. With Toronto sliding near the bottom of the Atlantic Division after 19 games, Masters’ report triggered strong reactions online. Some fans even responded by saying the team should “throw in the towel” on the season, a stark shift from the preseason optimism that came with top-ten Stanley Cup odds.Complicating matters, Matthews is only one of several key players on injured reserve. Chris Tanev, Brandon Carlo, Anthony Stolarz, and Scott Laughton are all sidelined, and Nicolas Roy is set to miss the matchup against St. Louis as well. That leaves the Leafs relying on a thin center group of John Tavares, Max Domi, Jacob Quillan, and Steven Lorentz. Quillan has just one NHL game, while Lorentz had 19 points in 80 games last season.Even so, the Leafs cannot pin everything on injuries. The roster lacks depth, and the front office is weighing roster-for-roster trades rather than dealing prospects. Elliotte Friedman recently said the team is open to offers for nearly every player except William Nylander, Matthew Knies, Matthews, and Tavares. How the team navigates this stretch may define the rest of their season.",Auston matthews has not played since suffering a lower-body injury on november 11.

Jose Altuve’s foot procedure adds an offseason wrinkle for the Astros



How Jose Altuve’s health shapes Houston’s roster outlook



The Houston Astros entered the offseason with the sting of missing the 2025 MLB playoffs still fresh. Their postseason streak had stretched across eight straight years, producing two championships and cementing the franchise as one of baseball’s modern powerhouses. That run ended this fall, leaving the club facing pointed questions about whether the window that once seemed wide open is starting to narrow. At the center of that discussion is Jose Altuve, the longest-tenured Astro and the face of the team’s recent dominance.Altuve completed his 15th season in Houston showing the kind of durability and competitiveness that has defined his career. He appeared in 155 games at age 35 and remained a productive bat, even as his numbers reflected a player pushing through discomfort. Now, as the Astros begin shaping their plans for 2026, the team is processing new health news surrounding their cornerstone second baseman.Early in the offseason, word emerged that Jose Altuve underwent a minor procedure on his right foot. According to Brian McTaggart of MLB.com, “Astros second baseman Jose Altuve, who was bothered by a sore right foot in the final two weeks of the regular season, underwent a minor skin aspiration Monday, a source told MLB.com.“He will be ready for the start of Spring Training.” McTaggart added, “Altuve had a procedure to remove fluid from a wound between his fourth and fifth toes on his right foot, the source said.”The injury dates back to September 13 against Atlanta, when Altuve was pulled from a game with discomfort and remained out the following night. Still, he played through the issue as Houston fought to stay alive in the playoff race.Once the Astros were eliminated, he finally sat. Even then, his competitive edge showed in flashes. Over his final 22 plate appearances, he posted a .353 average and a .500 on-base percentage, a reminder of the offensive spark he can still provide.Altuve’s surgery is not expected to delay his spring training readiness, but it arrives at a complicated moment for Houston. His overall production dipped in 2025, as he hit .265 with the lowest full-season on-base percentage he has posted in more than a decade. The Astros have also wrestled with how to manage his defensive role. They experimented with him in left field, hoping the short porch could mask range limitations, but manager Joe Espada ultimately returned him to second base.The challenge is that Houston lacks a clear internal replacement. Brice Matthews flashed promise but struck out at a high rate. Mauricio Dubón offers defense but not consistent offense, and his projected salary complicates the evaluation. Ramón Urías, meanwhile, struggled after the trade deadline. Those realities leave Altuve as the primary option for now, though the team remains linked to external possibilities such as Brendan Donovan or Brandon Lowe.Also Read: Javier Báez's wife Irmarie posts a touching tribute to her late mother, receiving warm reactions from MLB partners","Houston astros second baseman jose altuve underwent a minor procedure on his right foot.

Also read:

Adrian Kempe signed an eight-year, $85 million contract with the Los Angeles Kings on Monday. The LA Kings have signed the player to an agreement with an average annual value of $10.625 million. As per the NHL , the 29-year-old forward, who is in the last year of a four-year, $22 million contract ($5.5 million AAV) he signed with the Kings earlier on July 10, 2022, could have become an unrestricted free agent after this season. However, without letting this precious player trade to another team, the LA Kings managed to keep Kempe within $11 million.Kempe has been a key offensive catalyst for the Kings in recent seasons. He has led the team in scoring for the past two seasons and is off to a strong start this year with 19 points in 19 games. In addition to this, he scored an NHL career-high 41 goals in 2022-23 and had a career-high 75 points (28 goals, 47 assists) in 2023-24 before getting 73 points (35 goals, 38 assists) in 81 games last season.In a major move for the franchise’s future, the Los Angeles Kings have agreed to an eight-year contract extension with forward Adrian Kempe, locking him in for the upcoming NHL season. According to multiple sources, the deal is worth $85 million, signing Kempe to an average annual value (AAV) of $10.625 million, comfortably under the $11 million. But, how did they do?The first thing was the structure of the contract. The LA Kings crafted an agreement that suited Adrian Kempe while keeping the salary intact. The second was Kempe’s own preference to remain in Los Angeles, as he believes in the team, and reports suggested that he was willing to take slightly less to ensure a long-term fit.In the end, Kempe opted for familiarity and stability, even though he likely could have earned more if dealt with any other NHL team.Speaking about his contract signing, Los Angeles general manager Ken Holland said, “We are thrilled to have Adrian signed for the next eight seasons. He is an elite competitor who’s developed into one of the League's most dynamic two-way forwards, and his growth since joining the Kings organization has been tremendous. Adrian's presence both as a player and a leader is incredibly valuable to the team.”The manager further stated about how they signed him comfortably with that signing amount, ""Throughout this process, both sides were committed to finding a structure that reflects Adrian’s importance to us while keeping our long-term goals of building a team capable of contending every season in mind. We’re excited to have Adrian remain a core part of our organization for years to come.”It is to be noted that he has 29 points (15 goals, 14 assists) in 28 Stanley Cup Playoff games, including 10 points (four goals, six assists) in six games last season when Los Angeles lost to the Edmonton Oilers in the Western Conference First Round.Moreover, Kempe will also play in Sweden's preliminary roster for the Olympic Winter Games Milano Cortina 2026 after playing for his country at the 4 Nations Face-Off last season.","Adrian kempe signed an eight-year, $85 million contract with the los angeles kings.

The Dallas Cowboys are facing a heartbreak that no team should ever have to endure. Defensive end Marshawn Kneeland passed away during the team’s bye week, just days after celebrating his first NFL touchdown. Kneeland, a second-round draft pick from Western Michigan in 2024, had quickly become a key part of the Cowboys’ defense, especially after Micah Parsons was traded earlier this season. Known as much for his work ethic as his kind personality, Kneeland left a lasting impression on everyone around him, making his sudden death even harder to process.Since news of his passing broke, the Cowboys have been supporting one another through the grief.

Calgary Flames trade rumors 2025: Key players that NHL teams are targeting



TSN’s Noodles On The State Of The Calgary Flames: Trades, Rebuild & Leadership | The Insider Hotline

More coverage on NHL:

The Calgary Flames are enduring a tough season as they remain near the bottom of the NHL standings. With inconsistent performance on the ice, the team is facing mounting pressure to make roster adjustments before the 2025 trade deadline. Trade speculation is intensifying as the Flames look to reshape their lineup and regain competitiveness in the league.While Flames GM Craig Conroy has yet to signal an active rebuild, calls from other NHL teams are reportedly coming in to gauge player availability. The stakes are high, as any major trade could reshape Calgary’s roster and influence their positioning for the 2026 season. Fans are particularly focused on veterans and core players who could attract attention from teams looking to bolster their lineups.Rasmus Andersson, the 29-year-old right-shot defenseman, has become a focal point in trade discussions. With unrestricted free agency looming next July, his contract status is unresolved, making him an attractive option for teams seeking a reliable blueliner. Analysts suggest any potential deal would likely require Andersson to agree to an extension, making negotiations complex but high-stakes. Andersson’s performance this season continues to keep him in trade conversations as the Flames navigate a challenging 2025 stretch.Nazem Kadri, a seasoned center under contract through 2028-29, also draws attention. His $7 million average annual value and no-trade list add layers of complexity, but teams looking for experienced depth at center are reportedly interested, especially with injuries impacting key players like Jack Hughes.Blake Coleman, a versatile left winger, has similarly appeared in trade conversations despite the Flames not actively seeking to move him. His $4.9 million AAV and multi-team trade approval make him a flexible option for teams evaluating deadline acquisitions. Should Calgary decide to engage in the market, Coleman’s combination of experience and adaptability could be a significant bargaining chip.For now, Conroy appears poised to wait for the right opportunity, likely leveraging the trade deadline to maximize returns on key assets. Flames fans can expect heightened speculation in the coming months, with any major moves potentially redefining the team’s trajectory in the NHL.",The calgary flames are enduring a tough season as they remain near the bottom of the nhl standings.

Blake Lizotte delivered one of his most complete performances of the season as the Pittsburgh Penguins shut down the Nashville Predators in a commanding 4-0 victory. With the team searching for a spark after recent struggles, Lizotte stepped up in every zone, setting the tone with energy, discipline, and relentless pressure that Nashville simply couldn’t match.From the opening puck drop, Lizotte played with purpose. His speed disrupted breakouts, his tenacity on the forecheck created turnovers, and his defensive awareness helped neutralize Nashville’s limited scoring chances. Even before he sealed the game with an empty-net goal, his impact was clear that this was the kind of two-way effort that often goes unnoticed on the stat sheet but makes a massive difference in how a game unfolds.Lizotte was deployed on the fourth line once again, but his influence stretched far beyond typical fourth-line minutes. He dominated on the penalty kill, pressuring puck carriers, winning board battles, and refusing to give the Predators any clean looks. His commitment to the defensive side of the game played a major role in securing the shutout.The analytics matched what fans saw on the ice. Lizotte was on for 66.6% of the scoring chances and posted a strong 67.6% expected goals rate, elite numbers for any forward, especially one in a depth role.His work ethic helped stabilize the Penguins’ play and shift momentum at key moments.Injuries forced some lineup shuffling, including Connor Dewar moving up to skate alongside Sidney Crosby. Once healthy, Dewar is expected to return to the fourth line, where he and Lizotte form one of the most effective and irritating checking duos on the team. Their speed, pressure, and chemistry consistently wear down opponents and tilt the ice in Pittsburgh’s favor.Lizotte may have just three goals and four points through 19 games, but his value extends far beyond traditional scoring totals. His ability to drive possession, kill penalties, and outwork opponents makes him a crucial piece of the Penguins’ bottom six. Sunday’s win was a reminder that players like Lizotte often provide the spark needed to shift momentum, and he delivered exactly that in a much-needed victory.",Pittsburgh penguins defeated nashville predators 4-0 on sunday.

New details on the Giants rookie (Image Via Getty)

Abdul Carter was benched for missing a team walk-through at the Giants facility



Abdul Carter, the New York Giants rookie edge rusher, did not play during the first defensive series of the 27–20 loss to the Green Bay Packers on Sunday at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey. This was the first thing reporters noticed because the Giants started the game short on defense. Interim head coach Mike Kafka spoke after the game and said the decision was made by the coaching staff.But soon after the press conference, new information came out explaining why the rookie did not step on the field during that opening drive. The details came from people who were inside the Giants building before the game and saw what happened. The reason mattered even more because the Giants already had several injured players, including Kayvon Thibodeaux, who missed the game with a shoulder injury. That meant the team needed Abdul Carter on the field as soon as possible.According to Dan Duggan of The Athletic, Abdul Carter was benched because he missed the team walk-through on Saturday inside the Giants facility.Duggan reported that Abdul Carter was asleep at the facility when the walk-through took place and did not join the team on time.Duggan also wrote that Abdul Carter had been late to meetings before, and that this was a “trend” former head coach Brian Daboll allowed earlier in the season.When reporters asked Abdul Carter about the situation after the game on Sunday, he kept his answer short. He said, “I made a mistake, and there are consequences.” He did not give any more details about missing the walk-through or about the past late arrivals.Once the first defensive series ended, Abdul Carter played almost the whole game. He took every other defensive snap and finished with one tackle and one quarterback hit.Still, his rookie season has been slow compared to expectations. The Giants picked him No. 3 overall in the 2025 NFL Draft, hoping he would form a strong pass-rush trio with Brian Burns and Kayvon Thibodeaux.So far, Brian Burns has carried the group with 13 sacks this season. Abdul Carter has 0.5 sacks, and Kayvon Thibodeaux has 2.5 sacks. With Thibodeaux out because of his injury on Sunday, Abdul Carter’s workload grew right after the benching.These updates show why Abdul Carter sat out the first series and how the Giants handled the situation inside the locker room.More coverage on the NFL-","Abdul carter, the new york giants rookie edge rusher, did not play during the first defensive series of the 27–20 loss to the green bay packers on sunday.

Luke Littler dominates rival Luke Humphries to secure No. 1 Spot in PDC world rankings



Luke Littler created darts history once again as he became the youngest-ever world number one after a stunning run at the Grand Slam of Darts in Wolverhampton. The 18-year-old English sensation defeated the defending world number one, Luke Humphries, by 16-11 in the final to lift the title for the second straight year. His dominant 16-9 semi-final victory over Danny Noppert had already guaranteed his rise to the top of the PDC world rankings. With this win, Littler also remained unbeaten in the Grand Slam and proved why he is the new face of the sport.This achievement adds to Littler’s rapidly growing legacy. He first shocked the world with his record-breaking run to the 2024 World Championship final. A year later, he became the youngest world champion, and since then, he has become a global star. After his Grand Slam victory, the teenager proudly declared, “I am the best in the world, I can finally say it.” Littler’s rise has been so quick that he overtook Michael van Gerwen’s record, who was 24 when he first reached world No. 1.Luke Littler’s victory over Luke Humphries was a statement. The match swung back and forth early, with Littler leading 2-0 before Humphries won four straight legs. Humphries stayed in front until a brilliant 167 checkout helped Littler level at 8-8.The turning point came at 10-9 when Humphries, in control of the leg, went for a risky 170 finish. He missed, and his follow-up visit also fell apart. Littler seized the chance with a perfect 160 checkout. From there, he powered forward and never let the lead slip.After the win, Littler said, “Now I’m number one, I’m hungry to stay there. I want to be there for the next few years.” He knows the pressure will grow, adding, “There’s going to be a target on my back from Luke and all the other players.”Humphries, who hit 16 180s in his semi-final win over Gerwyn Price, admitted it was an emotional night. “This is the last day as number one. I’ve been so happy and proud of myself,” he said. He added that his focus was now on winning trophies again, “When it gets to the Worlds, I’ve got one opportunity to take it back from him. I’ll be fighting hard; it’s a war now.”Littler’s achievement is remarkable.
