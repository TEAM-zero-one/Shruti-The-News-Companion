BCCI sends a stern message to Mohsin Naqvi over Asia Cup trophy row

NEW DELHI: Pakistan pacer Haris Rauf has been handed a two-match suspension and will miss the upcoming ODIs against South Africa after breaching the ICC Code of Conduct during the Asia Cup 2025 final against India on September 28, the International Cricket Council (ICC) announced on Tuesday.The ICC confirmed disciplinary actions arising from the India–Pakistan fixtures, with sanctions imposed following hearings by the Emirates ICC Elite Panel of Match Referees.“Following a hearing conducted by ICC Match Referee Richie Richardson, Haris Rauf was again found guilty of a breach of Article 2.21. He was fined 30 per cent of his match fee and received two additional demerit points,” the ICC said in a statement.“This takes Rauf’s total to four demerit points within a 24-month period, resulting in two suspension points. In line with the Code, Rauf is therefore suspended for Pakistan’s ODIs against South Africa on November 4 and 6,” it added.Rauf had earlier committed the same offence during the group-stage clash on September 14, for which he was fined 30 per cent of his match fee and given two demerit points.Meanwhile, Pakistan batter Sahibzada Farhan received an official warning and one demerit point for his “gun celebration” after scoring a fifty against India during the Super 4 clash in Dubai.In the same September 14 match, India captain Suryakumar Yadav was also found guilty of breaching Article 2.21, fined 30 per cent of his match fee, and given two demerit points.For the September 21 encounter, Indian pacer Arshdeep Singh was cleared of charges related to obscene or insulting gestures under Article 2.6.During the final on September 28, Jasprit Bumrah accepted a Level 1 offence under Article 2.21, receiving an official warning and one demerit point, thereby avoiding a formal disciplinary hearing.",Pakistan pacer haris rauf has been handed a two-match suspension by icc.

Lamar Jackson’s leadership fuels Ravens’ resurgence



More NFL coverage:

On the same day he was named AFC Offensive Player of the Week, Lamar Jackson made one thing clear — he’s not holding back. The Baltimore Ravens quarterback, who recently returned from a hamstring injury, addressed lingering doubts about his health following last week’s 28-6 win over the Miami Dolphins. “The speculations and what I'm saying [are] totally different,” Jackson said after Wednesday’s practice. “So like I said, I feel good, and I was ready to play. I felt like I did what I needed to do to win.”Against Miami, Jackson threw for 238 yards and four touchdowns, yet ran just five times for 14 yards — one of the lowest rushing totals of his career. It was only the seventh time in eight seasons he’s been held under 15 rushing yards, sparking speculation about whether his hamstring was still bothering him. But Jackson quickly brushed off the concern. When asked if he’s ready to run when needed, he replied simply, “If I have to. ”Jackson, 28, remains the NFL’s all-time rushing quarterback with 6,353 yards — nearly 2,000 more than any active passer. While his 36 rushing yards per game mark a career low, it doesn’t seem to be due to injury. He wasn’t listed on the injury report before or after the Dolphins game, signaling he’s fully healthy and focused on winning.The Ravens believe Jackson’s dual-threat ability will be key again this Sunday against the aggressive Minnesota Vikings defense. “It's tough to blitz a guy like that because of how good he is with,” tight end Mark Andrews said, “obviously, his arm, but his feet, too.”Two weeks ago, Baltimore’s season looked lost at 1-5. Now, they’re riding a two-game win streak, with Jackson and the offense firing on all cylinders. “Yeah, no doubt,” Jackson said when asked if the team’s confidence had returned. “We've been locked in for the last couple weeks, and we got to stay that way. I believe we turned a new leaf, I believe so.”At 3-5, the Ravens aren’t out of danger yet. But if Jackson’s leadership and form continue trending upward, Baltimore could still make a late push for the AFC North crown. For Jackson, the mission is simple: stay focused, win the next game, and prove that the Ravens’ season is far from over.","Lamar jackson was named afc offensive player of the week on monday.

How NHL teams like Maple Leafs, Capitals, and Red Wings are handling injuries and comebacks



The NHL injury situation is still going on, and teams are still suffering and making comebacks in various places. The Pittsburgh Penguins are taking the hardest hit as they lose Tristan Jarry for a minimum of three weeks due to a lower-body injury just when they are about to play the Washington Capitals on Thursday, 7:30 p.m. ET (HULU, ESPN+, SN). Jarry’s injury really hurts Pittsburgh’s goalie position as the 29-year-old netminder had been performing consistently at the beginning of the season with a 5-2-0 record, 2.60 GAA, and .911 save percentage. Now, head coach Mike Sullivan will have to rely on the recalled goalie Sergei Murashov to split the net time while the team gets used to having fewer players.The situation is getting worse for the Penguins as both Noel Acciari and Justin Brazeau will be out with upper-body injuries for at least four weeks, which will really test Pittsburgh’s depth. The team has brought up Danton Heinen and Ryan Graves from Wilkes-Barre/Scranton (AHL) to help the roster stay even. Sullivan pointed out that the team will have to give a “collective response” to get through this period without important veteran players.While Pittsburgh is in chaos, other teams are finding reasons to celebrate. Finally, the Toronto Maple Leafs will see Scott Laughton take the ice for the first time this season on Wednesday against the Utah Mammoth (7 p.m.ET; TVAS, SN, Utah16) after overcoming a lower-body injury. Head coach Craig Berube also provided good news that goalie Joseph Woll will soon be back after taking a personal leave in September.In the case of Washington, Rasmus Sandin is back in the game after a five-game absence due to an upper-body injury. His return brings some strength to the Capitals’ defense that has not been very reliable. On the other hand, not all the news is bad — Pierre-Luc Dubois has a lower-body problem that will keep him out for a long time, but coach Spencer Carbery has reassured us that it is not a season-ending injury.At the same time, Ryan Strome from Anaheim is healing well and could be back soon, while Patrick Kane from Detroit might start practicing on Thursday, indicating that the Red Wings’ offense is getting stronger after nine games missed.Injuries to some players and returns of others have made this week's status report a reflection of the unpredictability of the league. For a team like Pittsburgh, the survival mode is now activated; meanwhile, the Toronto and Washington teams are the ones that finally get to see the light at the end of the tunnel.More coverage on NHL","Pittsburgh penguins are taking the hardest hit as they lose tristan jarry for a minimum of three weeks due to a lower-body injury.

The Bigger Picture: Sending a Message to Tarik Skubal

As the 2025 MLB season officially comes to an end, the focus quickly shifts toward the offseason - a period that promises major shakeups across the league. With a long list of stars expected to test free agency, front offices are already weighing their options between blockbuster signings and strategic trades. For the, one of the biggest storylines centers on their uncertain infield situation and the possible departure of Gleyber Torres.This offseason features a loaded market with names like Kyle Schwarber, Cody Bellinger, Alex Bregman, and Pete Alonso potentially switching uniforms. While many clubs are expected to make aggressive pushes in free agency, others will look to bolster their rosters through the trade market. The Tigers may fall into the latter group, especially if they decide to replace Torres with an established All-Star talent.This winter’s free-agent market is stacked with talent. Stars like Kyle Schwarber, Cody Bellinger, Alex Bregman, and Pete Alonso headline a group of players who could redefine the league landscape. However, while many franchises will dive into free agency, others - like the Detroit Tigers - may prefer the trade route to strengthen key areas.Expect some clubs to move aggressively early in the market, while others play the waiting game to gauge player values. Either way, there’s a sense that this offseason will spark considerable movement, with several marquee names possibly finding new homes.The Detroit Tigers face a crucial decision regarding Gleyber Torres, who is now an unrestricted free agent. Losing him would be a significant blow to the team’s lineup. Torres played in 145 regular-season games in 2025, producing a .256/.358/.387 slash line with 16 home runs and 74 RBIs. His consistency and presence were vital to Detroit’s overall success, making him a priority - though re-signing him may prove difficult given market competition.According to Bleacher Report’s Joel Reuter, the Tigers could make a blockbuster move by trading with the Toronto Blue Jays for two-time All-Star Bo Bichette. Reuter wrote, “Bo Bichette does not turn 28 years old until March 5, and after a down year in 2024, he returned to elite form offensively this season with a .311/.357/.483 line that included 44 doubles, 18 home runs and 94 RBI in 139 games.”Here’s a quick look at how Bichette compares to Torres in 2025:Bichette’s offensive resurgence makes him an ideal candidate for Detroit’s infield. Although his defensive metrics at shortstop suggest limitations, a shift to second base could maximize his strengths while filling Torres’ vacancy.A move for Bichette would carry broader implications beyond filling a positional gap. It would also signal Detroit’s commitment to building a legitimate championship contender. As Reuter noted, “It would also represent a significant move to show Tarik Skubal the front office is serious about building a title contender, as the Detroit Tigers try to hammer out a long-term extension with their ace before he hits the open market after the 2026 season. ”By bringing in an All-Star-caliber talent like Bichette, the Tigers could demonstrate to Skubal - and the rest of the roster - that the organization is intent on competing for a World Series.Also read: MLB trade rumors: Philadelphia Phillies potentially eyeing $190 million star amid Alec Bohm uncertainty The Detroit Tigers’ front office faces a defining offseason. Whether they re-sign Torres or make an aggressive move for Bichette, their decisions will shape the team’s trajectory for years to come.","The detroit tigers face a crucial decision regarding gleyber torres, who is now an unrestricted free agent.

Trey Benson injury update: Could the Arizona Cardinals running back return for Week 10 after knee setback?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/trey-benson-injury-update-could-the-arizona-cardinals-running-back-return-for-week-10-after-knee-setback/amp_articleshow/125110647.cms,"Tired of too many ads? go ad free now

Will Trey Benson be back and who will lead the backfield if he doesn’t?

The Arizona Cardinals’ running game has been a revolving door since Week 4. Trey Benson, who earned the starting role after James Conner went down with a season-ending injury, has been sidelined with a knee problem. In his absence, the team has experimented with a trio of backs — Bam Knight, Emari Demercado, and Michael Carter — each showing glimpses of production but none delivering consistent performance. As the Week 10 matchup against the Seattle Seahawks looms, the Cardinals are left waiting to see if Benson will finally return to stabilize the position.Benson has now passed the four-game minimum required for an injured reserve stint, making him eligible to come back. However, there is still no official word on whether he will be activated. Arizona will get its first chance to gauge his status during Wednesday’s practice session, which kicks off their Week 10 preparation.The moment Benson is officially designated to return from injured reserve will be the clearest signal that he could be back on the field. While his return is still up in the air, there’s a chance he could play this week.Arizona’s backfield has been far from settled in Benson’s absence. Michael Carter initially looked like he might step into the lead role, but that plan didn’t stick. Bam Knight seemed ready to assume control next, only to be edged out by Emari Demercado in Week 9. That week, Demercado saw 15 touches compared to Knight’s 11, gaining five more carries, which hinted at a shift in the rotation. If Benson does not return immediately, the Cardinals will likely continue with a two-man committee featuring Knight and Demercado, with the slight edge going to Demercado in terms of expected workload. Once Benson is healthy and active, he is expected to reclaim the starting role and provide some much-needed stability to the running game.For now, Arizona fans and fantasy players are left in the dark. Benson’s possible return is the main question, and until the team confirms his status, the Cardinals’ backfield will stay unpredictable. How carries are split without him could affect the offense and even the team’s play-calling as Week 10 approaches.","The arizona cardinals’ running game has been a revolving door since week 4.

How Keith Tellus Browner rose to fame as a USC defensive star and left a lasting impact on college football

Keith Tellus Browner Sr., the formidable USC defensive star who went on to leave his mark in the NFL, passed away suddenly at the age of 63, leaving family, fans, and the football community in shock. According to his son, Keith Browner Jr., Browner Sr. was preparing to visit the hospital after experiencing stomach issues, vomiting, and severe fatigue. “I spoke with him Monday night,” Keith Jr. said. “He was feeling sick, tired, and told me he would go to the hospital Tuesday morning.” Tragically, while getting ready, Browner Sr. collapsed at home and passed away, with reports indicating a suspected heart attack.Browner Sr.’s sudden demise has ignited an outpouring of grief across college and professional football circles, not only for his individual accomplishments but also for the enduring legacy he built through his family. Drafted 30th overall in the 1984 NFL Draft by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, he played linebacker and defensive end for five seasons, including stints with the 49ers, Raiders, and Chargers. Beyond his own career, his influence lives on through his children, particularly Keith Jr., who followed in his father’s footsteps to play at Cal and later in the NFL. The Browner name has become synonymous with grit, determination, and leadership, making the loss of its patriarch deeply felt across generations.At USC, Browner Sr. became a defensive powerhouse, earning recognition for his strength, agility, and leadership. Transitioning to the NFL, he demonstrated remarkable versatility, playing both linebacker and defensive end across multiple franchises. Beyond the statistics, his relentless work ethic, discipline, and mentorship left a lasting impression on coaches and teammates, making him a respected figure on and off the field.Browner Sr. is survived by his five children: Keith Jr., Keicha, Amber, Ashley, and Jordan. Keith Jr.’s journey from college football at Cal to the NFL highlights the enduring influence of his father’s guidance and values. “He instilled in us the importance of discipline and passion for the game,” Keith Jr. said in earlier interviews. For fans and players alike, Browner Sr.’s legacy goes beyond his personal achievements, serving as a source of inspiration and a model of dedication.Though Browner Sr.’s physical talent made him a dominant presence on the field, his sudden passing underscores the fragility of life, even for elite athletes. The unexpected heart attack, which struck as he prepared for routine medical care, reminds the football world that even legends face vulnerabilities. Tributes from fans, teammates, and coaches alike highlight the profound and lasting mark he left on the sport, as well as on his family and the community he inspired.Also read: Why is Kirk Herbstreit trending after Tom Brady revealed he cloned his beloved dog?","Keith tellus browner sr. played linebacker and defensive end for five seasons in the nfl.

This moment amplified existing discussions around Acho's off-camera controversies.

Emmanuel Acho reacts to Jennifer Aniston’s surprising boyfriend reveal

More coverage on NFL:

For someone who doesn’t even play anymore, Emmanuel Acho stays trending like an active locker-room storyline. The former NFL linebacker has built a second career, one that often blends celebrity culture, football talk, and social commentary, so when he reacted to Jennifer Aniston officially announcing her relationship with Jim Curtis, it didn’t take long for that tiny moment to become a headline event. Aniston’s relationship debut wasn’t subtle either.She posted a black-and-white photo hugging the wellness coach from behind and called him “my love,” which instantly pulled millions of eyeballs. Acho’s public response? Just three teary-eyed emojis. And that simple subtle comment opened an entirely new thread of online interpretation.Some fans felt his emojis were innocent, a cute “OMG this is sweet” reaction. Others took it deeper, pointing out how Acho and Aniston’s first meaningful connection came during a serious cultural moment, when she reached out in 2020 following his viral “Uncomfortable Conversations with a Black Man.” She was one of the earliest big names to champion it, texting him encouragement that read, “Thank you for the clarity. ”So naturally, people wondered: Were those three emojis nostalgia? Appreciation? Or subtle shade? The internet loves to project meaning onto silence and emojis are the currency of projection.But his trending moment arrived during a time where Acho himself is often discussed more for off-camera tension than on-camera takes. He’s been pulled into messy FS1 chatter before like when LeSean McCoy hinted at alleged “action” involving Joy Taylor, a rumor Acho clearly hated having dredged up again. He even snapped on air: “I’m tired of talking to y’all… I’m tired of this show.”So his Jennifer Aniston moment wasn’t just a throwaway emoji comment, it was lightning hitting a dry pile of previous speculation. When two pop-culture worlds with history collide, even three emojis can become a headline.","Emmanuel acho reacted to jennifer aniston's new relationship with jim curtis with three teary-eyed emojis.

NHL

:

In Pittsburgh, the question surrounding Sidney Crosby’s future has been gaining momentum. Fans and analysts have speculated whether the Penguins’ captain might end his career elsewhere or if his incredible legacy will remain tied to the Steel City. Penguins GM Kyle Dubas has finally addressed it, making it clear that there’s no room for doubt about his commitment—or Crosby’s.The 39-year-old executive, who also shoulders responsibilities with Team Canada’s Olympic roster, has made one thing certain: his plan for Crosby and the Penguins isn’t changing anytime soon. His goal remains focused on building a team capable of contending while keeping its core intact, both for today and tomorrow.Speaking to The Athletic, Dubas shared rare insights into his approach to keeping Sidney Crosby’s future in Pittsburgh aligned with the team’s larger vision. He emphasized the importance of communication and trust, explaining how he keeps both Crosby and his agent, Pat Brisson, informed of every move. “Our goal is not so different,” Dubas said of the 38-year-old captain. “Every day, we're trying to get better. We're trying to put ourselves in a position to win every single day.And I think that's been what we really set out to do from the spring to the summer through the fall.”Dubas acknowledged that results might not always be immediately visible, but his philosophy remains steady. “I communicate that with Sid and with Pat, and I just don't think we can veer from it if we're going to deliver for him a team that can contend while he's still at this level, while he's still playing,” he said. The GM praised Crosby’s character and dedication, noting how his leadership continues to define the Penguins’ culture.He also credited the rest of the leadership core—Evgeni Malkin, Kris Letang, Bryan Rust, Erik Karlsson, and Rickard Rakell—for maintaining that championship mindset. “That in itself is probably the most important part of bringing the team back to that point (contention),” Dubas added.As for what comes next, Dubas isn’t rushing into decisions about Crosby’s long-term future. With two years left on his contract, he believes the best path forward is simple: keep winning. “No, I would never,” he said when asked about trading or disrupting the core. “He's got two years, this year and next year, on his contract. And I just think that if we continue to take the right steps and we continue to win, that's the great solution to everything in sports. Just have to win.”For Dubas, success on the ice remains the answer to everything—including ensuring that Sidney Crosby’s story in Pittsburgh continues exactly where it began.",Penguins gm kyle dubas reveals his plan for sidney crosby’s future in pittsburgh.

Mitchell Robinson's involvement in trade rumors over the past few months has a purpose. The former second-round choice is a useful backup who knows how to position his body for both offensive and defensive rebounds. However, he has recently become a frontcourt presence plagued by injuries.Robinson has already been declared out for the New York Knicks ' next game against the Washington Wizards, meaning his injury problems will continue throughout the 2025–2026 season. Robinson is a game-time decision for Friday, according to coach Mike Brown. Brown recognizes the potential, even though the center's availability will probably continue to be a recurring part this season.Mitchell Robinson finally made his season debut on Friday night against the Chicago Bulls , which was fantastic news for the New York Knicks. Due to a left ankle injury, the center had missed the first four games. He is now ready to be back on the court, contributing to the improvement and strength of the Knicks defense.However, Robinson, who is still dealing with a sore ankle, might make his debut after practicing on Thursday for the first time since the regular season started. Talking about it, the coach said:“Mitch brings a lot to the table. Obviously, he hasn’t played in a while too.So he’s not going to be Mitch Robinson in the next five games probably, no matter when he plays or how much he plays..”He further said:“But his length, his versatility, in terms of being able to guard one through five, his ability to offensive rebound, defensive rebound, he just brings a lot to both ends of the floor. You get a vertical threat offensively and an anchor defensively, that it’s hard to replace because he’s a special player at that position.”Robinson had not exercised or played since the third preseason game, when he was inexplicably benched for ""left ankle injury management."" His ankle seems to be getting better enough for him to continue playing.He is labelled as questionable for today's game, but he should play 20 to 25 minutes against the Bulls. Whatever the cause, there has been a push for his comeback. A source claimed that Robinson even took part in the morning shootaround prior to Tuesday's Milwaukee game.At any point, getting Robinson back into the starting lineup would be considered a victory for New York. It doesn't, nonetheless, alter the truth that the team is reportedly getting tired of his injuries.In 13 minutes during Sunday's 128-116 victory over Chicago, Robinson recorded zero points (0-3 FG), five rebounds, one assist, and two blocks. His workload was extremely light on Sunday as the Knicks continued to exercise utmost care.Robinson's load management was the subject of numerous concerns prior to the season, and this seems like a problem for his team.
