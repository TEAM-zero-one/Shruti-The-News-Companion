Deshaun Watson gets baptized in Israel while Shedeur Sanders gets to know new Cleveland Browns head coach Todd Monken,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/deshaun-watson-gets-baptized-in-israel-while-shedeur-sanders-gets-to-know-new-cleveland-browns-head-coach-todd-monken/articleshow/127820900.cms,"(Image via Getty: Shedeur Sanders and Deshaun Watson)

Cleveland Browns share heartfelt post featuring Shedeur Sanders and Todd Monken

Life changing moments have nothing to do with football

Can’t wait to see the video when Todd Monken meets Myles Garrett

There are two sides to the NFL quarterback position. Cleveland Browns longtime signal-caller Deshaun Watson, who arrived in a blockbuster trade sending Baker Mayfield to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, reportedly revealed he was baptized in Israel.Sports media personality Dov Kleiman shared on X that Watson said the experience was life changing. “I am truly in awe of this wonderful land and the wonderful people who live here.” Kleiman also wrote, “Deshaun is a devout Christian [red heart and folded hands emojis].”Now, the other side of an NFL field general. The Browns’ official X account shared a heartwarming post of QB Shedeur Sanders meeting their new head coach, Todd Monken, who was previously the Baltimore Ravens offensive coordinator and worked with Lamar Jackson and others. Cleveland captions it: “it all worked out.”Monken and Sanders shake hands, then the coach pulls the signal-caller’s shoulder and says, “Hey, we tried to draft your [---] last year for God’s sake! It all worked out. You remember that right?” Sanders chuckles and responds, “That’s what I was about to tell you…” Monken shares, “Someday we’ll get a chance to talk about that.”In Sept. 2025, ESPN’s Adam Schefter reported that the Ravens planned to pick Shedeur Sanders in the fifth round with the No.141 pick. League sources told the NFL Insider that Sanders did not want to play alongside Lamar Jackson because he would not have a chance to play soon.Is that why he chose Cleveland? A veteran like Deshaun Watson was recovering, rookie Dillon Gabriel was on the roster, veteran Joe Flacco was playing, and Super Bowl LIX winner Kenny Pickett was traded from the Philadelphia Eagles to the Browns. Maybe. Just speculation.Anyway, how did cybercitizens react to Watson’s baptism picture and Sanders’ union with a former Baltimore coordinator? Let’s find out.“Nothing wrong with making this move in your life. It’s never too late,” wrote one X user for Watson. Another wrote a wholesome comment for the playmaker, “Whatever people think about him on the field, moments like this are personal.Faith journeys are not about headlines or teams, they are about meaning and perspective. If this experience gave Deshaun Watson peace or clarity, that matters to him. Sometimes life changing moments have nothing to do with football at all.”Watson did not play a single game in his 2025 campaign. And Kleiman reportedly shared a photo of Watson’s baptism from June 2019.ABC13 Houston reported at the time that Watson was in Israel for a week on a trip sponsored by the nonprofit group America’s Voices. While on the trip, he was baptized in the Jordan River.Watson said in a statement then: “This is a part of the world which gets a lot of attention internationally, and this is a chance for me to look beyond the headlines and learn more about the history and culture of this land.I have been blessed to visit many countries around the world, but the chance to visit the Holy Land, see the sites and meet the people of this special place, truly is a special blessing and an amazing opportunity.”Coming to Deion Sanders’ son: “I’ve never seen a backup QB get this kind of treatment,” wrote one X user after seeing a special video of backup QB Shedeur Sanders meeting the franchise’s new head coach.Another user was waiting for a video featuring Cleveland’s star defensive end Myles Garrett: “Can’t wait to see the video when he meets Myles.”A third user spoke for the 23-year-old Colorado Buffaloes former standout QB: “Its clear coach cant wait to work with Shedeur. Say what you want, but Sanders was part of why Monken wanted to come here. That aside this interaction is hilarious [laughing face emojis].”","Cleveland browns shared heartfelt post featuring shedeur sanders and todd monken.

JJ Redick issues hilarious statement showering praise on LeBron James’ performance against Washington Wizards

LeBron James reacts to JJ Redick’s slam dunk contest claims

Age is just a number and LeBron James has been proving it repeatedly in the 2025-2026 season. This is the 23rd season and the athlete seems to be in no mood to slow it down. Recently, the NBA legend led his team to a thunderous win against the Washington Wizards. LeBron pulled off some impressive dunks, combined with his foot skills for the game. Post the win, coach JJ Redick was asked about his opinion on LeBron’s on-court performance. He hilariously praised the athlete, stating how there is still “juice left in those legs,” while revealing the league’s plans for LeBron in the upcoming NBA Slam Dunk Contest.LeBron, on the other hand, had a hilarious response to Redick's slam dunk claims. ESPN's NBA reporter Dave McMenamin posted a clip on X. In that, LeBron was asked about the truth behind Redick's claims. The Lakers legend immediately dismissed the idea.LeBron James missed the first 14 games of the 2025-2026 season. As he returned to the court, initially, LeBron could not rack up many points for the team. But gradually, he got back the momentum and started adding up huge numbers to the final scores of the team.The 41-year-old athlete is in the midst of retirement talks. Despite that, he doesn’t seem to stop. This has garnered appreciation from members of the NBA community. Los Angeles Lakers coach JJ Redick was the latest to join the line.In the post-game media appearance, Redick was asked about his opinion on LeBron’s dunks during the game against the Washington Wizards. Redick stated, “The early rumors are that the league is gonna try to get him to the dunk contest this year.” The dunk contest is an annual competition held during the All-Star weekend. It is interesting that LeBron has never participated in this contest throughout his 23-year-long career. Redick further added, “There's some juice left in those legs, apparently. The great left bionic leg""Just moments after JJ Redick’s statement went viral, LeBron James was asked if the claims were true. Redick stated that the league was planning to involve LeBron in the upcoming slam dunk contest. When the athlete was asked to confirm, he had a hilarious response. LeBron stated, “No chance.” He seemed quite affirmed about his decision.

Why Klint Kubiak might go with the Raiders HC job over the Cardinals,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/why-klint-kubiak-might-go-with-the-raiders-hc-job-over-the-cardinals/articleshow/127825143.cms,"Klint Kubiak “definitely” getting Cardinals or Raiders head coaching job in 2026, as per reports

Seattle Seahawks offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak's next move: Why is the Cardinals the better pick for him?

Seattle Seahawks offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak’s next appointment has quite a few members of the team brass on edge. Reports suggest that Kubiak is a top choice for the head-coaching vacancies with the Las Vegas Raiders and Arizona Cardinals, as both teams are still searching for a head coach.Insiders have claimed that the Raiders and Cardinals are set to bring Kubiak in for second interviews over the weekend, ahead of his expected trip to Super Bowl week. Sports journalist Jeremy Fowler recently reported that Kubiak is favouring the Raiders' opening over the Cardinals’ position.Of course, Kubiak may not end up with either franchise and may remain in Seattle for another season as the Seahawks’ offensive coordinator.“My sense in league circles talking to people is that he would prefer the Raiders job over the Cardinals if he does go that route,” Fowler said. “It is not a slam dunk he leaves Seattle.”“He’s been with multiple teams. He’s been with multiple teams over the years. Just moved his family to the Northwest,"" Fowler added. ""So it would take the right kind of situation for him to leave. But it is believed that the target for Las Vegas and that No.1 pick with Fernando Mendoza would be Kubiak.”Another sports journalist, Adam Schefter, however, said on the ""Pat McAfee Show"" that Kubiak was ""definitely getting"" the Raiders or Cardinals jobs.The Raiders' job might be more appealing to Kubiak than the Cardinals' opening, since Las Vegas is widely expected to select quarterback Fernando Mendoza for the No. 1 overall pick. Reports also suggest that the Raiders have significant salary-cap flexibility and already have promising offensive pieces in place.Arizona, however, is dealing with a tricky quarterback situation and is operating with roughly $50 million less in cap space than the Raiders, which limits their roster-building options.It’s also important to note that even if Kubiak ultimately accepts one of the two positions, NFL rules prevent the appointment from becoming official until after the Super Bowl.","Klint kubiak is a top choice for the head-coaching vacancies with the las vegas raiders and arizona cardinals, as both teams are still searching for a head coach.

The NBA did not reveal the type of infraction or the substance involved, though.According to the guidelines of the NBA Players Association agreement, George's 25-game suspension suggests that this was his first infraction. Meanwhile, in a statement to ESPN, he claimed that he took ""improper medication"" by mistake to treat his mental illness.As per Shams Charania of ESPN, George said:""Over the past few years, I've discussed the importance of mental health, and in the course of recently seeking treatment for an issue of my own, I made the mistake of taking an improper medication..”He continued:""I take full responsibility for my actions and apologize to the Sixers organization, my teammates and the Philly fans for my poor decision making during this process.

Embiid told reporters following Thursday's victory over Sacramento:""Obviously, we've been ducking the tax the last couple of years, so hopefully we keep the same team… I love all the guys that are here. I think we got a shot. I don't know what they're going to do, but I hope that at least we got a chance to just go out and compete because we got a good group of guys in this locker room, and the vibes are great.""For the 76ers, who are presently in sixth place in the Eastern Conference, George has averaged 16 points, 5.1 rebounds, and 3.7 assists in 27 games this season.

Jalen Brunson hits the 10,000 career points milestone



Jalen Brunson’s impact on the Knicks’ franchise



When Jalen Brunson stepped on the free-throw line on Friday night at Madison Square Garden, the home crowd knew a history was about to be written. And Brunson, with a flick of his wrist, sent the ball into the basket and added a prolific 10,000 career points milestone in his NBA resume.The 6’2” Knicks point guard has been rewriting every scout’s report that ever doubted his abilities. The achievement came in a match against the Portland Trail Blazers, whom the Knicks hosted at MSG. From the first quarter, where the Knicks dropped 37 points against their opponents 22, the intention was clear that the win would stay in New York. The deal was sealed in the 4th quarter when the Knicks put up 40 points on the board, almost double of Trail Blazers’ 28, and ended the match in a blowout win with 127-97.When Jalen Brunson entered the contest against the Trail Blazers on January 30th, he was short of 20 points to reach the five-figure club. But with a trademark free throw late in the third quarter, he achieved this feat.He finished the game with a team-high of 26 points, while shooting 8-of-20 from the floor and a perfect 5-of-5 from the free throw stripe. Beyond Brunson’s individual glory, the dominant win marked the Knicks’ fifth consecutive victory and has moved, and placed them to 2nd place in the Eastern Conference with a 30-18 record.Seems like Jalen Brunson’s soul-searching talk has helped the Knicks in getting their minds and bodies on the right track.Brunson’s journey from a highly-efficient secondary playmaker in Dallas to an explosive point scorer in New York has put him amongst the elite in the league. This season, he’s played in 43 games and has averaged 27.6 points, 3.1 rebounds, and 5.9 assists, with a field shooting efficiency of 47.5%.As a free against Jalen Brunson signed a 4-year $104 million contract with the Knicks in 2022. Since his arrival, he has transformed the Knicks' playing style and has elevated them to a contender-worthy franchise. He ended a 25-year-long drought by leading the team to the Eastern Conference Finals for 2024-2025.As a Knicks player, Brunson has accumulated 6,720 points till now and is currently tied with Bill Cartwright for 10th all-time in franchise history for 20-point games (201).

Derrick Rose says he doesn’t want a statue after seeing Dwyane Wade’s

Keeping the Legend in the Lenses

Last Saturday, on January 24, 2026, the rafters of the United Center finally felt complete as Derrick Rose’s No. 1 jersey was raised into the Chicago skyline. Surrounded by his family and the roar of a crowd that never stopped believing in him, the moment brought a wave of emotions for Derrick Rose, who couldn’t stop the stream of tears.What often follows for a player with an illustrious and impactful career, like Derrick Rose, is the franchise building a stature in their honor, but the NBA's youngest MVP didn’t think so. In a recent sit-down on Forbes’ The Enterprise Zone, the Chicago hero made it clear that while he's honored by the love, he wants the organization to keep the bronze in the foundry.The Miami Heat built Dwyane Wade’s statue to honor his 15-year historic career with them on October 27, 2024. The statue depicted Wade’s famous, “This is my house,” gesture. But what followed upon the statue’s unveiling could become a perfect script for a stand-up special. Fans went berserk with their roasting on social media. The most common joke was that the statue looked like anyone but Dwyane Wade.Rose jokingly, upon being asked if he’d like Chacicago Bulls to build a statue for him too, said, ""No knock, D-Wade... I’m good.”Rose added, “You could do the statue of a family crest, but I don’t want no statue of myself. I feel like that’s idolizing in a way and nobody to idolize.”He explained how he doesn’t like idolization, and building a statue is a form of it. It seems like a rare stance in an era where under the spotlight matters as much as being a superstar on the court. For Rose, who grew up in Englewood and became an NBA legend, the jersey retirement wasn’t just his honour, but as he stated, “This journey was never about me. Right from the jump, it was never about me"".By turning down having a statue, Derrick Rose shows that he wants to preserve his legacy in its purest form with just memories. He might have retired without an NBA championship ring, but what he gained more beyond the court remains incomparable. Through his deep emotional commitment to the City of Chicago, Rose’s legacy lives in everyone’s heart. As a hometown hero, Derrick Rose remains everyone’s inspiration who ever thought dreams do not come true.","The miami heat built dwyane wade’s statue to honor his 15-year historic career with them on october 27, 2024.

De’Andre Hunter trade framework draws mixed reactions as Kings, Cavaliers, and Lakers explore multi-team deal

Salary cap limits and future draft picks complicate De’Andre Hunter’s trade possibilities

At this year's trade deadline, the Sacramento Kings are getting ready to make some significant changes. They are also looking forward to the departure of its veterans and doing a fresh start. However, fourth-year guard Keon Ellis is now the most probable candidate to be dealt.According to reports, the Lakers and Cavaliers have explored a trade that would involve a third team, Brooklyn, and send Rui Hachimura and Dalton Knecht out of Los Angeles. The Cavaliers would trade De'Andre Hunter to Sacramento.According to Michael Scotto of HoopsHype, trade talks between the Kings and Cavaliers would send Ellis and Dennis Schröder to Cleveland. The Cavaliers would trade De'Andre Hunter to Sacramento in exchange.Scotto reported on Saturday:""Cleveland and Sacramento have discussed a framework that would send Cavaliers forward De’Andre Hunter to the Kings for Keon Ellis, Dennis Schroeder, and Dario Saric, league sources told HoopsHype. A third team could be looped in to take on Saric, and second-round draft pick compensation also could be added to the framework, sources said.”Additionally, Chris Fedor of Cleveland.com reported on the Wine & Gold Podcast:""My sources tell me that the Cavs and the Lakers have discussed a general framework surrounding De'Andre Hunter of Rui Hachimura and Dalton Knecht and then bringing in a third team.""Although the Cavaliers have emerged as a top destination, Ellis is allegedly receiving some attention on the trade market from roughly half of the league. Additionally, even though he would probably be transferred to a third team, Dario Saric is also involved.Hunter is an intriguing talent who might contribute to the Kings' victory. It is anticipated that the Kings will receive a first-round selection in exchange for the guard, as over half of the league has expressed interest in Ellis.However, the sources further said that although it would be ideal for the Kings to terminate Schröder's contract, accepting Hunter's contract is also not a pleasant scenario.The Cavaliers are past the second apron, which makes it difficult to create any transaction with these teams. Neither team can acquire several players in a trade, nor can they get more money than they put out. In addition, the Lakers are currently under $1 million from their hard cap at the first apron.Hence, as per sources, it would be simple to move during the summer or at the trade deadline the following year if they make this deal now. For the sole purpose of trading Hunter away later, Kings general manager Scott Perry may try to acquire a long wing with a history of involving other teams.Nevertheless, Kings club that isn't in a rush to be competitive would find it worthwhile to take a chance like this because Hunter on an expiring contract is more valuable than a combination of Ellis and Schröder right now.","The lakers and cavaliers have explored a trade that would involve a third team, brooklyn, and send rui hachimura and dalton knecht out of los angeles. A third team could be looped in to take on dario saric, and second-round draft pick compensation also could be added to the framework, sources said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127825277,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-69184,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"

Brittany Mahomes is being recognized for one of the most accomplished soccer careers in UT Tyler history

Brittany Mahomes is going back to where it all started but this time, it’s for one of the biggest honors her alma mater can give. The former UT Tyler soccer standout and current Kansas City Current co-owner has officially been named to the University of Texas at Tyler Athletics Hall of Fame Class of 2026. For fans who mostly know her from the NFL world, this moment is a reminder that Brittany’s sports resume was stacked long before the spotlight found her.Mahomes (then Brittany Matthews) played for UT Tyler women’s soccer from 2013 to 2016 and left as one of the most productive players the program has ever seen. She ranks second all-time in total points (78) and goals scored (31), while also sitting near the top of the record book in game-winning goals (10) and assists (16). She also tied for third in total games played with 74 appearances, showing both durability and consistency across four seasons.Brittany set single-season program records with 40 points, 18 goals, and seven game-winning goals. She also recorded four separate matches with three goals, tying the program’s best single-match scoring mark multiple times in one year.Brittany reflected on the honor in a statement released with the announcement, saying she is grateful for the people and experiences that defined her time in Tyler.She specifically thanked Coach Webb for believing in her and helping shape her journey both on and off the field, adding that UT Tyler will always hold a special place in her heart.After her playing career, she transitioned into growing the game off the field. She is a founding co-owner of the Kansas City Current in the National Women’s Soccer League, a franchise that helped open CPKC Stadium, widely recognized as the first stadium purpose-built for a professional women’s soccer team. Her influence in the league also expanded when she was named to the inaugural NWSL Advisory Board, joining a group of high-profile athletes and sports leaders supporting the league’s growth.Mahomes will officially be inducted during the UT Tyler Athletics Hall of Fame ceremony on March 28, 2026. She joins a class that also includes longtime supporter Dr. Howard Patterson and the 2016 UT Tyler softball team, making it a major celebration of Patriot athletics history.",Brittany mahomes has been named to the university of texas at tyler athletics hall of fame class of 2026.

against the. The Memphis Grizzlies have ruled him out with a left-elbow ulnar collateral ligament sprain, and the current expectation is that he will remain out until around mid-February 2026.His absence leaves Memphis without its main ball handler and scorer. The team will have to adjust on both ends of the floor, and there is no indication that his status will change before tip-off.The NBA injury report for January 31 lists Ja Morant as “Out” with a left-elbow UCL sprain. Memphis is not planning to activate him late and is focused on giving the injury time to heal.Player Status Injury Expected ReturnJa Morant Out Left-elbow UCL sprain Around mid-February 2026The team chose rest and rehab instead of trying to bring him back early to avoid making the injury worse.Ja Morant suffered the sprain during a practice scrimmage earlier in January. After medical tests, the Grizzlies decided he needed several weeks off.The injury followed a right calf contusion that had already forced him to miss six games earlier in the month. Memphis Grizzlies has taken a careful approach with him after several injury interruptions in recent seasons.With Ja Morant out, Memphis Grizzlies will lean more on Jaren Jackson Jr.for scoring. Ball-handling duties will be shared by Tyus Jones, Kennedy Chandler, and the rest of the guard group.The Grizzlies may play at a slower pace than usual. Morant often pushes the ball in transition and attacks the rim, and those chances are harder to create without him. Minnesota is comfortable playing in the half court with Anthony Edwards, Rudy Gobert, and Mike Conley, which could make scoring more difficult for Memphis.Ja Morant should be kept out of fantasy lineups for this game. His absence increases opportunities for Jaren Jackson Jr., Desmond Bane, and Memphis guards, but the offense may not be as productive overall.Minnesota gains an edge with Morant unavailable. The matchup could be more controlled and lower scoring than games where he is on the floor.Memphis is clearly prioritizing Morant’s health and wants him ready for the later part of the season. That approach may cost the team in the short term, but it reduces the risk of a longer absence.Also read: Is Anthony Edwards playing tonight vs Memphis Grizzlies?

Minnesota Timberwovels vs Memphis Grizzlies Game expectation (January 31, 2026)

The Minnesota Timberwolves face the Memphis Grizzlies on January 31, 2026, in a Western Conference matchup between two teams managing several injuries. Even with players unavailable on both sides, the game features enough proven talent to remain competitive.Minnesota comes in with the stronger record and a healthier core group. Memphis, meanwhile, continues to adjust its rotations because of long-term injuries. The difference in styles is clear and that is the Timberwolves rely on size and interior defense, while the Grizzlies depend heavily on guard play and pace.Minnesota is missing a few rotation players, but most of its main contributors are expected to play.• Terrence Shannon Jr. (SG) - Left foot abductor hallucis strain; expected to miss significant time.• Enrique Freeman (G-League two-way) - Ruled out without a specific designation.• Rocco Zikarsky (G-League two-way) - Also listed out on the official report.• Mike Conley (PG) - Back spasms; status depends on pregame evaluation.• Leonard Miller (F) - Dealing with back issues and could see limited minutes if active.Anthony Edwards, Rudy Gobert, and Julius Randle are all expected to suit up.If Conley is cleared, Minnesota keeps a noticeable advantage in size and overall balance.Memphis Grizzlies have dealt with injuries throughout the season, particularly in the frontcourt.• Zach Edey (C) - Stress reaction in the left ankle; no clear return date.• Brandon Clarke (F) - Grade 2 right calf strain; projected return in four to six weeks.• Ty Jerome (SG) - High-grade right calf strain; out indefinitely.• Vince Williams Jr. (SG) - Left knee soreness; not expected to play.• Santi Aldama (F) - Knee issue; often plays with managed minutes.The Grizzlies are expected to rely on Ja Morant, Jaren Jackson Jr., and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope. Younger players such as Jaylen Wells and Scotty Pippen Jr. could take on larger roles depending on lineup needs.Minnesota has a slight edge in the all-time series and has performed better in recent matchups.The teams have already met once this season. Minnesota won a close game behind a 30-point effort from Anthony Edwards and a double-double from Rudy Gobert. The result reflected how the Timberwolves’ interior presence can slow Memphis’ preferred tempo.Minnesota sits in the upper half of the Western Conference with consistent production on both ends of the floor.• Anthony Edwards - About 28.9 points per game; primary scorer.• Rudy Gobert - Roughly 11.4 rebounds per game; anchors the defense.• Julius Randle - Around 5.7 assists per game; key facilitator.Minnesota’s defense remains one of its strengths. Gobert protects the rim, while Jaden McDaniels adds length on the perimeter.Memphis has slipped in the standings compared to last season, largely because of injuries and roster turnover.• Ja Morant - Drives the offense with transition scoring and pick-and-roll play.• Jaren Jackson Jr. - Provides shooting range and shot-blocking.The Grizzlies can still defend effectively when healthy, but injuries to Edey, Clarke, and Aldama have reduced frontcourt depth and contributed to more second-chance points for opponents.Gobert and Randle give Minnesota a strong presence inside. Memphis may have to rely more on outside shooting if it struggles to score in the paint.If Edwards and Donte DiVincenzo convert from long range, Memphis’ defense will need to stretch, which could open driving lanes.Memphis prefers a faster pace led by Morant. Minnesota may try to slow the game, especially if Conley is available to run the offense.• Edwards, Gobert, and Randle remain dependable fantasy options.• Conley carries some risk because of his questionable status but offers value if he plays.• Morant and Jackson Jr. remain top choices.• Caldwell-Pope and Wells gain importance if injuries lead to increased minutes.The matchup projects as physical with a moderate pace. Minnesota’s defense could influence the scoring level, particularly if the Timberwolves have their full backcourt. Minnesota enters the game as the more complete team and holds a slight health advantage. If Mike Conley plays, the Timberwolves should be in a strong position to control rebounding and tempo.Memphis will depend on Morant’s scoring and Jackson Jr.’s two-way impact to stay within reach. The contrast between Minnesota’s interior defense and Memphis’ guard-driven offense should keep the contest competitive.","The minnesota timberwolves face the memphis grizzlies on january 31, 2026.

Main factors in the Portland Trail Blazers vs New York Knicks game (January 30, 2026)

What to expect on Blazers vs Knicks Jan 30

Thein New York with both teams in very different situations. Portland is trying to stop a three-game slide while dealing with several injuries. New York is coming in on a four-game winning streak and has most of its main players available.This game is likely to be decided by depth and basic execution. Portland is missing key guards and needs replacement players to handle the ball and score. New York’s job is not as difficult. They need to defend well, take care of the ball, and use its size advantage.The game will be played at Madison Square Garden, where the Knicks have been strong this season. New York already beat Portland once earlier in the year, and the Blazers are even more short-handed for this meeting.Portland Trail Blazers are 23-25 and have lost three straight. Head coach Chauncey Billups has to rely on a thin rotation.• Damian Lillard - left Achilles management• Scoot Henderson - left knee tear, out for weeks• Matisse Thybulle - right knee tendinopathy• Kris Murray - undisclosed issue• Blake Wesley - sidelined• Duop Reath - right foot stress fracture• Deni Avdija - low back strain, around 25 points and 7 rebounds per game• Robert Williams III - knee managementIf Avdija cannot play, Portland will depend more on Shaedon Sharpe for scoring and on Jerami Grant for defense and secondary offense.Without Lillard and Henderson, Portland lacks steady ball handling. That has led to many turnovers this season.New York Knicks are 29-18 and has won four in a row.• Josh Hart - ankle soreness• Miles McBride - ankle management• Jalen Brunson - around 26 points and 6 assists per game• Karl-Anthony Towns - about 20 points and 11 rebounds• Mikal Bridges• OG Anunoby - around 16 points and 5.4 reboundsIf Hart or McBride sits, Brunson will handle the ball more often, with Bridges and Anunoby helping to create plays.These teams have met 126 times in the regular season. Portland leads the series 70-56. New York won the first meeting this season 123-114 on January 11, 2026. In that game, Brunson and Towns scored more than 40 points combined, and Portland struggled with turnovers.Portland now enters the rematch with fewer healthy guards than it had in that loss.Portland’s last few games include losses by scores of 111-115 and 94-102. The team averages about 16.1 turnovers per game, one of the highest marks in the league.New York has won games by wide margins during its streak, including 119-92 and 103-87. The Knicks have controlled rebounds and limited easy fast-break chances for opponents. Towns anchors the middle, and the wings cover ground on defense. This sets up a simple contrast: Portland must avoid mistakes, while New York looks to force them.Portland needs reliable offense without its top two guards. Sharpe has to score efficiently, Grant has to defend without fouling, and Avdija, if he plays, has to contribute on both ends.New York needs steady guard play if Hart or McBride cannot go. Brunson will see more pressure, so wing support is important. Turnovers will likely decide the pace. If Portland protects the ball, the game can stay close. If New York forces early mistakes, it can build a quick lead.This matchup favors New York. The Knicks are healthier, at home, and have already beaten this opponent once this season. Avdija’s status is the biggest variable. If he plays well, Portland can stay competitive. If he is out, New York should control rebounds, limit mistakes, and manage the game from start to finish.For Portland, the path is simple and that is fewer turnovers and balanced scoring. For New York, it is strong defense, good rebounding, and letting its main players carry the offense.","Portland trail blazers are 23-25 and have lost three straight.

NEW DELHI: Five-time champions India will head into Sunday’s Super Six showdown against arch-rivals Pakistan with revenge firmly on their agenda at the ICC Men’s Under-19 World Cup in Zimbabwe. More than just pride is at stake, with the clash set to decide the fourth and final semi-final spot, as the ICC has outlined detailed qualification scenarios for both teams.The fixture carries extra significance following India’s heavy 191-run loss to Pakistan in the Under-19 Asia Cup final in Dubai last December — a setback that came after India had earlier beaten their rivals by 90 runs in the group stage of the same tournament.Under the leadership of Ayush Mhatre, the Indian side will now aim to set the record straight on the world stage.India are also expected to stick with their ‘no handshake’ policy against Pakistan, a stance they adopted during both the group match and final of the Asia Cup. The decision comes against the backdrop of the Pahalgam terror attack and Operation Sindoor carried out by the country’s armed forces.In terms of the tournament picture, Australia, Afghanistan and England have already booked their places in the semi-finals.The final berth will be decided solely by the outcome of the India-Pakistan contest. England currently lead Group 2 with eight points and a net run rate of +1.757, followed by India on six points with a strong NRR of +3.337. Pakistan sit third with four points and an NRR of +1.484.For India, the path is clear: a victory will confirm their semi-final qualification and also see them finish on top of the group, setting up a last-four meeting with Afghanistan. Even in defeat, India remain in a favourable position, as a narrow loss would still keep them ahead of Pakistan thanks to their superior net run rate.Pakistan, by contrast, face a much steeper climb. As per ICC calculations, if Pakistan bat first and post a total of 250, they would need to beat India by at least 89 runs to leapfrog them into second place and qualify at India’s expense.If Pakistan are chasing, the challenge becomes one of speed. For example, a target of 251 would have to be overhauled in 33.2 overs or fewer to stay alive in the tournament, with any lower target requiring an even faster chase.With both sides aware of the exact equations, Sunday promises a tense battle, and the full picture will become clear at the innings break. With a semi-final spot hanging in the balance, expect a gripping contest at Queen’s Sports Club in Bulawayo.",Five-time champions india will head into sunday’s super six showdown against arch-rivals pakistan with revenge firmly on their agenda.

Bayern Munich dropped points for the second week in a row after being held 2-2 at Hamburg on Saturday.Borussia Dortmund can close the gap to six points if they beat bottom club Heidenheim at home on Sunday.Hamburg, who had lost 17 and drawn three of their last 20 games against Bayern, took the lead in the 32nd minute through a Fabio Vieira penalty.Bayern responded with goals from Harry Kane and Luis Diaz before and after half-time, but Luka Vuskovic quickly equalised for the hosts.Late in the game, Alphonso Davies cleared a chance from Vieira to secure a point for Bayern.Goalkeeper Manuel Neuer said the draw “feels like a defeat,” while sporting director Max Eberl criticised the refereeing.Neuer, clearly dissatisfied, told Sky:""the draw feels like a defeat.

Mitch Evans made a remarkable comeback to the podium after a long time at the rain-drenched Miami E-Prix by registering the 15th victory of his Formula E career. The Jaguar TCS Racing driver was lagging in the championship with no points but went on to finish first despite starting from ninth position on the grid. He managed to beat polesitter Nico Muller and last Miami E-Prix winner Pascal Wehrlein to lift the winner’s trophy.It was a wet and wild Season 12, Round 3 Formula E race at the Miami International Autodrome on Saturday, as Mitch Evans went on to show his expertise behind the steering wheel of a GEN3 Evo car by clinching a win over a testing 41-lap race.

Hopefully this is a good restart to our season and we can continue from 15 wins.”The first half of the race was a tricky affair for the Formula E drivers as polesitter and Porsche driver Nico Muller was leading after a Safety Car start, but it was Andretti rookie Felipe Drugovich who surpassed him by making use of the 350kW Attack Mode activation to climb into P1 early on.Muller regained his lead after Drugovich clashed with Jaguar TCS Racing’s Antonio Felix da Costa.Amid all this, Evans made a perfect switchback move on Lap 27 to surpass Muller, as the latter fell for the dummy move.
