Wayne Gretzky and Gary Bettman to follow Alex Ovechkin’s historic chase

Hockey history waits to be rewritten, and the all-time leading goal scorer, Wayne Gretzky , will be there to see it. The Great One will be on hand for games as Alex Ovechkin approaches breaking his historic mark of 894 career goals.With only eight goals to reach and 16 games left in the Washington Capitals' regular season, the excitement is building to a fever pitch. The NHL is going all out to celebrate this historic milestone, including a special in-arena ceremony when Ovechkin finally scores goal number 895.NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman will also be tracking Ovechkin’s journey across North America. Though details on when Gretzky and Bettman will begin attending games remain unclear, their presence underscores the significance of this record-breaking moment.""Alex Ovechkin's pursuit of the NHL's all-time goal-scoring record is a major milestone not just for hockey, but across the entire sports world,"" said Jon Weinstein, the NHL’s chief communications officer. ""We're looking forward to marking this historic chase in multiple ways that reflect the magnitude of this incredible moment.""Unlike Gretzky, who established his goal-scoring marks early in his career with jaw-dropping seasons of 92, 87, 73, and 71 goals, Ovechkin has sustained his dominance over more years. The 39-year-old has reached an incredible nine 50-goal seasons and has reached at least 40 goals 13 times. Even after breaking his left leg earlier this season, he only missed 16 games, showing the resilience that has characterized his career.The pursuit of 895 occurs in the midst of unusual circumstances. Ovechkin has played under a lockout-compressed season, two COVID-interrupted seasons, and the Russia-Ukraine war, adding another layer to his legacy. Others would suggest that if it weren't for those interruptions, he would already be over Gretzky.Also Read: Wayne Gretzky: The Great One reflects on his legacy, Hockey culture, and life lessons amid ongoing backlash With the NHL and hockey world in attendance, Ovechkin's quest to break Gretzky's goal record is more than a player milestone—it's a tribute to two eras of hockey greatness.

Champions Return: Rohit, Hardik, Shreyas, Gambhir return after India's title triumph

NEW DELHI: The Hundred Draft witnessed a notable absence of Pakistani cricketers , with none of the 50 players from the country receiving bids. This development has sparked discussions and raised questions about the potential factors contributing to this outcome.Among the Pakistani contingent, prominent names such as Naseem Shah , Saim Ayub, and Shadab Khan , who were placed in the top price brackets, failed to attract any bidders.Naseem and Shadab were listed in the highest category of GBP 120,000, while Ayub positioned himself in the GBP 78,500 segment. Similarly, the female cricketers from Pakistan , including Aliya Riaz, Fatima Sana, Yusra Amir, Iram Javed, and Jaweria Rauf, did not receive any offers.One potential reason cited for this lack of interest in Pakistani players is the involvement of Indian Premier League ( IPL ) owners in the Hundred teams.Currently, four IPL franchises hold stakes in various Hundred teams, including Mumbai Indians in Oval Invincibles, Lucknow Super Giants in Manchester Originals, Sunrisers Hyderabad in Northern Superchargers, and Delhi Capitals in Southern Brave.Additionally, Sanjay Govil, an Indian-American entrepreneur, has acquired a 50% stake in Welsh Fire, while Cricket Investor Holdings Limited, a consortium of Silicon Valley tech entrepreneurs, has purchased a 49% stake in London Spirit.While the influence of IPL owners cannot be discounted, another factor that may have contributed to the lack of bids for Pakistani cricketers is their modest form in white-ball formats.The recent performances of these players in limited-overs cricket might have played a role in deterring potential buyers from investing in their services.It is worth noting that last year, players like Naseem Shah and Shaheen Shah Afridi faced challenges related to obtaining No Objection Certificates (NOCs) from the Pakistan Cricket Board ( PCB ), which ultimately curtailed their participation in the Hundred.Such administrative hurdles could also have impacted the decision-making process of the teams during the draft.","The hundred draft witnessed a notable absence of pakistani cricketers.

Jason Kelce reveals the toughest NFL player he ever faced during his 13-year NFL career,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/jason-kelce-reveals-the-toughest-nfl-player-he-ever-faced-during-his-13-year-nfl-career/articleshow/119017584.cms,"Credit: Getty Images

Jason Kelce Reveals His Most Challenging Opponent – And It’s Not Who You’d Expect



After battling some of the NFL's most dominant defensive linemen for 13 seasons with the Philadelphia Eagles , Jason Kelce recently opened up about the most difficult opponent he ever faced—and the answer has surprised many. Despite facing elite players like Aaron Donald and Dexter Lawrence, Kelce named journeyman defensive tackle Poona Ford as the player who consistently gave him the most trouble throughout his career.During his 13-year career, Jason Kelce went head-to-head with some of the best defensive linemen of his era. Naturally, Aaron Donald—a future Hall of Famer—was the obvious choice when Kelce was asked about the best player he ever faced. While appearing on the Pardon My Take podcast, Kelce admitted, ""The best player I ever played against was Aaron Donald, for sure."" However, Kelce explained that Donald often lined up against guards rather than centers, which meant that direct matchups between them were rare.Kelce also acknowledged the challenges posed by other elite players, including Dexter Lawrence and Damon ""Snacks"" Harrison. Lawrence, in particular, emerged as a major challenge in the latter part of Kelce's career due to his size and strength. Harrison, known for his dominance in the interior line, also made a lasting impression on Kelce.However, when pressed to name the player who gave him the most consistent trouble, Kelce’s response was unexpected: Poona Ford.Kelce’s explanation of why Ford gave him so much trouble highlights the nuances of NFL trench battles. Ford, despite being just 5-foot-11 and 310 pounds, possessed a rare combination of shorter height and longer arms that made him uniquely difficult to handle. Kelce admitted, ""I was always for some reason like not the best guy (against) Poona Ford... He had longer arms and he's shorter than me. At least with the bigger guys I can get under him and get leverage on him, and if I play a shorter guy, at least I have longer arms. So when you play someone shorter with longer arms, I've negated every technical advantage I have.""This physical mismatch stripped Kelce of the leverage and arm-length advantage that he typically relied on against other defenders. ""I have no mass advantage... I hated playing Poona,"" Kelce added, highlighting just how frustrating these encounters were for him.What makes Kelce's revelation even more surprising is Ford's relatively low profile in the NFL. Unlike Donald or Lawrence, Ford hasn’t earned Pro Bowl nods or major accolades. However, his stats reflect his quiet effectiveness. Over seven seasons, Ford has accumulated 11.5 sacks, 229 tackles, 37 tackles for loss, and 39 quarterback hits—solid numbers for a player who has quietly made a significant impact despite not being a household name.Ford’s journeyman career has seen him play for three teams, and he is set to join his fourth for the 2025 season. While most fans might overlook him, Kelce's respect for Ford’s unique skill set speaks volumes about his effectiveness.Also Read: Did Travis Kelce record his podcast at Taylor Swift’s NYC home? Swiftie spot key detail Kelce’s career saw him take on the best in the league, but it was Ford's rare combination of size and reach that gave the veteran center the most trouble. For someone with Kelce’s resume to single out a lesser-known player like Ford as his most difficult matchup underscores just how much of an impact Ford quietly made on the field.","Jason kelce recently opened up about the most difficult opponent he ever faced.

Anna Marie Kupp reacts to Cooper Kupp’s release



The Los Angeles Rams have officially parted ways with Super Bowl LVI MVP Cooper Kupp after eight seasons, marking the end of an era for one of the franchise’s most decorated players. Kupp’s departure on Wednesday came after the team failed to find a suitable trade for the veteran wide receiver, despite his instrumental role in the Rams' recent success. The news was met with an emotional response from his wife, Anna Kupp, who took to social media to express her unwavering support.Although the announcement didn’t come as a surprise—given that Kupp had previously revealed the team’s intentions to trade him—it still marks a significant shift for the Rams and their fan base. The 30-year-old receiver, who was drafted in the third round of the 2017 NFL Draft, quickly established himself as one of the league's most consistent and dynamic playmakers. His standout 2021 season, in which he secured the NFL’s Triple Crown (leading the league in receptions, receiving yards, and touchdowns), culminated in a Super Bowl MVP performance that cemented his legacy.However, injuries and the natural effects of aging have slowed Kupp’s production over the past three seasons. He’s set to turn 32 in June, and despite his declining numbers, Kupp remains confident that he can still contribute at an elite level. His release reflects the Rams’ broader effort to reshape their roster and manage salary cap constraints, but Kupp’s departure leaves a noticeable gap in the team’s offensive lineup.Following the announcement, Anna Kupp shared an emotional and inspiring message on Instagram, underscoring her confidence in her husband’s future. She posted a picture of Cooper in his Rams uniform, paired with heartfelt words about his leadership and impact both on and off the field:“Wherever we go, wherever we land, is going to be so f*ing lucky to have you in their building. You have the ability to turn the tides of any organization you step foot into.”Anna continued, highlighting Kupp’s unwavering dedication and influence on those around him:“The man that you are, the leader that you embody, the brother on and off the field. The standard you hold yourself to and bring others along in your pursuits. People want to be better because of who you are and how you conduct your business.”Her tribute concluded with an expression of faith in Kupp’s ability to thrive in the next phase of his career:“The joy and passion you exude in your preparation and execution is contagious. I am so excited for the impact you will have in these coming years, the relationships waiting for you, and for you to continue to tear apart your opponents. To the moon, my King.”Kupp also addressed the situation himself, posting a confident message on X (formerly Twitter):“Next chapter starts now. Best is yet to come.”Anna has been a constant presence in Kupp’s life since they began dating in 2012 while attending different high schools in Washington state. The couple, who are set to celebrate a decade of marriage this summer, have weathered the ups and downs of Kupp’s career together. From his rise to becoming a Super Bowl champion to now facing the uncertainty of free agency, Anna’s unwavering support remains a driving force for Kupp.Also Read: ""What is $5 million more going to do"": Bills’ Josh Allen jokes about giving the team a $5 million “discount” on his new contract As Kupp prepares to join a new team, the football world will be watching closely to see if he can reclaim his spot among the NFL's elite. Despite his recent struggles, the belief shared by both Kupp and his wife suggests that the next chapter of his career may be just as impactful as the last.","Cooper kupp has been released by the los angeles rams after eight seasons.

Reports suggest Rodgers may step away from playing in 2025 and join the San Francisco 49ers ’ staff, potentially setting the stage for a major leadership role in the future.Rodgers has repeatedly dismissed the idea of coaching post-retirement, but circumstances change. As one of the most intelligent quarterbacks in NFL history, he possesses the strategic mind that could make him a successful coach. With insiders predicting that he may not suit up in 2025, some believe he could step into a coaching role with the 49ers, possibly positioning himself as Kyle Shanahan ’s eventual replacement.""While Kyle Shanahan is safe for the 2025 NFL season, there is a real chance that his future in 2026 is not,"" Marissa Myers noted. ""With that in mind, it presents the perfect opportunity for Rodgers to take the next step in his career, and enter the realm of coaching."" (via: Sporting News)Also Read: Steelers set to sign veteran QB in 2025 Free Agency, but it’s not who you think Shanahan has guided San Francisco to multiple deep playoff runs, but his tenure has also been marked by inconsistency. With four playoff misses in eight seasons, concerns about his long-term viability continue to grow. Critics argue that his inability to adapt is holding the 49ers back. Rodgers, a four-time MVP, could bring a fresh perspective and serve as a mentor for young quarterback Brock Purdy, helping the team transition into its next phase.Adding to the intrigue, Rodgers’ California roots make this move even more compelling. A lifelong 49ers fan, he once dreamed of being drafted by them. If he transitions into coaching, leading his hometown team would be a full-circle moment in his storied career.Rodgers remains unpredictable, keeping fans and analysts on edge. But if he decides to swap his helmet for a headset, the 49ers could be his next big move, one that shakes up the NFL landscape and redefines his legacy.","Reports suggest aaron rodgers may step away from playing in 2025 and join the san francisco 49ers ’ staff.

Jimmy Butler and Steve Kerr Exchange Heated Words After Controversial Late-Game Shot in Warriors' Win Over Portland Trail Blazers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/jimmy-butler-and-steve-kerr-exchange-heated-words-after-controversial-late-game-shot-in-warriors-win-over-portland-trail-blazers/articleshow/118941015.cms,"Image Via Getty

Steve Kerr Explains Why He Told Jimmy Butler to Break NBA’s Unwritten Rule

Jimmy Butler’s Triple-Double Overshadowed by Controversial Shot

Jimmy Butler single handedly forces a shot clock violation

Gary Payton II Scores Career-High 26 Points to Lead Golden State Warriors to Victory

What should have been a straightforward win for the Warriors turned into a mess after the game. Jimmy Butler 's triple-double was overshadowed by a last-second shot that really upset the Portland Trail Blazers players — and it looked like it got under Butler's skin too. A video from after the game showed a tense moment between him and coach Steve Kerr , who later revealed he was the one who told Butler to take that shot. Here’s the whole story behind that unexpected twist.As the clock wound down in the Warriors' 130-120 win over the Portland Trail Blazers, Jimmy Butler was in a bit of a bind. With Golden State comfortably ahead and only a few ticks left, he had to choose between holding the ball or taking a shot. Usually, teams would just let the clock run out in these moments. But after a quick glance at Steve Kerr on the sideline, Butler decided to take an open jumper, which ruffled a few feathers among the Trail Blazers players.Footage from after the game showed Jimmy Butler frustrated during a brief but intense talk with Steve Kerr. Kerr later explained his reasoning, saying, “I told him, we don't do shot clock violations. If there’s a shot clock differential, we always shoot.” Kerr’s firm stance on this philosophy put Butler in a tricky situation, even though he seemed a little reluctant on the court.Butler had a standout performance that evening! He scored 15 points, pulled down 10 rebounds, and tallied 10 assists, marking his second triple-double this season and his first as a Warrior. His previous triple-double was on December 16 while he was with the Miami Heat. The Warriors are sitting pretty with a 12-1 record when Butler plays, highlighting his significant role in their success.While all this is happening, Stephen Curry keeps shining this season, hitting five 3-pointers and bringing his total to 251. This is his 11th season with 250+ threes, which is an NBA record. He’s just two 3-pointers away from being the first player to hit 4,000 career triples.Even with the fuss going on, the Warriors' depth was a key factor in their victory. Gary Payton II had an impressive night, scoring a career-high 26 points and tying his record with four 3-pointers. Buddy Hield also made his mark with six 3-pointers and 20 points, showing off the Warriors' strong offensive lineup.The arguments between Jimmy Butler and Steve Kerr after the game definitely caught some attention, but it doesn't take away from how well the Warriors played. With Stephen Curry on the verge of hitting a major milestone and Butler stepping up with his all-around skills, Golden State is proving they're a force to be reckoned with.Also Read - Shai Gilgeous-Alexander vs Nikola Jokic: Who Truly Deserves the 2025 NBA MVP?

NEW DELHI: Yuzvendra Chahal is set to return to Northamptonshire for the 2025 County Championship season after impressing during his stint with the club in 2024.

In 2024, he made an immediate impact, taking five wickets on debut against Kent in the One-Day Cup and later delivering a sensational 9-99 against Derbyshire in the County Championship—a career-best performance.His contributions proved vital as Northamptonshire secured back-to-back wins against Derbyshire and Leicestershire, with Chahal finishing the season with 19 wickets at an average of 21 across just four first-class games.“I thoroughly enjoyed my time here last season, so I’m very happy to be coming back. There are some great people in that dressing room, and I can’t wait to be part of that again.

Mason Rudolph rejoins Steelers on two-year deal



BREAKING: STEELERS BRING BACK MASON RUDOLPH

Why Mason Rudolph’s return matter for Pittsburgh?

The Pittsburgh Steelers are making moves ahead of the 2025 season, and one of their latest decisions brings back a familiar name to their quarterback lineup. As the team looks to solidify its depth under center, reports confirm that a former Steelers signal-caller is set to return to the black and gold.In a move that has caught the attention of fans and analysts alike, quarterback Mason Rudolph is officially making his way back to Pittsburgh. According to ESPN, the veteran quarterback has agreed to a two-year contract worth $8 million, with $4.5 million guaranteed.Rudolph, who previously spent several seasons with the Steelers, was a reliable backup and occasional starter during his first stint with the team. Last season, he explored his options in free agency and had interest from multiple teams, including the Tennessee Titans. However, after considering his opportunities, he ultimately decided to reunite with the Steelers.Also Read: Buccaneers sign ex-Lions CB Kindle Vildor in new deal The return of Mason Rudolph provides Pittsburgh with stability at the quarterback position, particularly as the team looks to navigate the challenges of the upcoming season. Having spent years learning the Steelers' system, he brings familiarity and experience that could prove invaluable in a supporting role or in the event of an unexpected shake-up at the position.While Mason Rudolph’s past performances in Pittsburgh had their ups and downs, his experience and understanding of the franchise make him a logical fit. With the Steelers aiming to build a strong roster for the 2025 campaign, bringing back a quarterback who knows the system inside and out could be a strategic move in ensuring depth and reliability at the position.As the new season approaches, all eyes will be on how Mason Rudolph integrates back into the team’s plans. Whether as a backup or a potential starter, his presence ensures that the Steelers have an experienced option in place should the need arise. The return of a familiar face under center might just be what Pittsburgh needs to stay competitive in a demanding AFC landscape.","Mason rudolph has agreed to a two-year contract with the pittsburgh steelers, according to reports.

Champions Return: Rohit, Hardik, Shreyas, Gambhir return after India's title triumph

NEW DELHI: Retired Test opener David Warner has cast doubt on whether England’s high-octane "" Bazball "" approach will hold up on Australian soil, insisting it’s a risky tactic against the conditions Down Under.“I don’t know if 'Bazball' is a myth now, but I can’t see it happening in Australia,” the 38-year-old told reporters this week, as quoted by Fox Sports.Warner, who called time on his international career last year, had a front-row seat to England’s aggressive style during the 2023 Ashes . While the approach earned praise for its entertainment value, he believes the fast-paced batting might falter on bouncier Australian pitches .“With the bounce and everything, the fields Australia set last time in England, it would be pretty high risk to play that in Australia,” he said.“It’s probably not the way to go about it. If that is the way they go … it’s going to be high tempo, high energy and we’ll all get a couple of days off at the back end.”England’s ""Bazball"" era, led by Test captain Ben Stokes and coach Brendon McCullum , has seen mixed results since kicking off three years ago. The team surged to a dominant home summer in 2022, then made headlines with a record-breaking 3-0 whitewash in Pakistan.However, their fortunes turned in 2023. England failed to retain the Ashes on home soil and later slumped to a 4-1 series loss in India, reigniting doubts about the long-term sustainability of the ""Bazball"" strategy in varied conditions.Meanwhile, Warner is gearing up for a new challenge. Earlier this week, he was picked up by the London Spirit for AU$245,000 in The Hundred Draft . He’ll reunite with former Australian coach Justin Langer as the 100-ball tournament kicks off in August.Warner’s home ground will be Lord’s—where tensions famously boiled over during the 2023 Ashes, as he and his teammates clashed with MCC members in the Long Room. Asked about the reception he expects from Spirit fans, Warner was candid.“We’ll just have to wait until I step foot on that park first, won’t we? Then we’ll see how the reception is,” he said.“I’ll have to walk past the Long Room first to get to the changing room! I actually want them to come at Australians. I love that stuff, that’s what gets me going but I want them to support London Spirit.ALSO SEE: Why all 50 Pakistan cricketers went unpicked in The Hundred Draft “If they want to boo me, boo me, but don’t boo the team. We’re not there playing for the Australian cricket team so they can cheer a little bit for myself but most importantly cheer for the team.“I’m really looking forward to it, I know how English crowds are and it excites me.”",David warner doubts england's 'bazball' approach will hold up on australian soil.
