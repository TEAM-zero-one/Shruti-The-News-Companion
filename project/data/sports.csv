Bangladesh cricket in turmoil: What it means for the T20 World Cup?

Poll Should the ICC consider changing the tournament venue for Bangladesh matches? Definitely, due to security concerns. No, they should stick to the original plan.

NEW DELHI: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), on Tuesday, has formally written to the International Cricket Council (ICC) expressing its support for Bangladesh’s refusal to play matches in India at the 2026 Men’s T20 World Cup. The development comes a day before the ICC Board is set to meet on Wednesday to take a final call on Bangladesh’s participation in the tournament.According to an ESPNcricinfo report, the PCB’s communication to the ICC also copied members of the ICC Board, underlining Pakistan’s alignment with the Bangladesh Cricket Board’s (BCB) stance amid what it termed political and security concerns in the region. Bangladesh, backed by its government, has asked for its group-stage matches to be shifted to Sri Lanka, co-hosts of the tournament.The report further indicated that the governing body has so far remained firm on its position. The ICC has repeatedly conveyed to the BCB that the tournament schedule will not be altered and that Bangladesh are expected to play their matches in India as originally planned.Despite multiple rounds of discussions between the ICC and BCB, neither side has softened its stance.While the ICC has insisted that logistical and security assessments do not warrant a venue change, the BCB has maintained that it cannot send the team to India under the current circumstances. January 21 had been set as the deadline for a final decision, with the tournament scheduled to start on February 7.The PCB’s late intervention follows days of speculation about its role in resolving the impasse. Unverified reports suggested that Pakistan had offered to host Bangladesh’s matches, while others claimed the PCB was even reassessing Pakistan’s own participation depending on how the situation unfolded.The standoff traces back to the BCCI’s decision to ask IPL franchise Kolkata Knight Riders to remove Bangladesh pacer Mustafizur Rahman from their IPL 2026 squad — a move that was never fully explained but widely linked to deteriorating political ties. That episode prompted the Bangladesh government to formally state that the national team would not travel to India for the World Cup.The fallout has since escalated, triggering unrest within Bangladesh cricket, including a brief player boycott during the BPL after controversial remarks by a senior BCB official.","Pakistan cricket board (pcb) has formally written to the international cricket council (icc) expressing its support for bangladesh’s refusal to play matches in india.

A controversial call that changed the game

Travis Kelce’s light-hearted reaction

Bills New Coach, Championship Preview, Wedding Advice & The New Era of TEs with Greg Olsen | EP 176

The Buffalo Bills’ playoff exit against the Denver Broncos did not end quietly. It sparked a fresh debate over officiating, rule interpretation, and what really counts as a catch in the modern NFL. At the centre of the storm was a late interception ruling that many Bills fans felt cost them the game. But while the fanbase fumed, some of the league’s biggest names came out firmly in support of the officials including Joe Burrow and Travis Kelce The flashpoint came late in the contest on a deep throw from Josh Allen to Brandin Cooks. Cooks appeared to make a stunning grab before Broncos defender Ja’Quan McMillian wrestled the ball away as both went to the ground.After a lengthy review, officials ruled that Cooks had not completed the process of the catch. The interception stood, and within minutes Denver marched down the field to set up the game-winning score.For many Bills fans, it felt like another season had ended on a single ruling. Clips of the play spread quickly across social media, with thousands questioning how the call could go against Buffalo in such a crucial moment.Amid the backlash, Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow stepped in with a rare post on X, offering a firm defence of the officials.“The amount of ppl that don’t understand what a catch is in the rule book flabbergasts me,” Burrow wrote. “And it’s not the officials. The two plays yesterday were not difficult calls, and they got them both right.”It was Burrow’s first post on the platform in months, and his blunt tone immediately drew attention. While many Bills supporters disagreed, several players and analysts backed his interpretation of the rule.Burrow’s post soon made its way to the “New Heights” podcast, hosted by Travis Kelce and his brother Jason Kelce, with former tight end Greg Olsen also discussing the play.Kelce’s reaction, however, focused less on the ruling and more on Burrow’s choice of words.“I love it. I don’t even care what he said to the world,” Kelce joked. “I’m just glad he used the word flabbergasted.”Olsen quickly joined in, laughing, “Flabbergasted. What a great word.”Behind the humour, both Kelce and Olsen agreed with Burrow’s view. Olsen explained that because Cooks was going to the ground, he had to complete the process of the catch, which he did not.For Buffalo, the explanation brought little comfort. The loss reopened old wounds, with fans recalling past playoff exits that hinged on controversial moments. Calls for rule clarity and consistency grew louder online.Still, the support from players like Burrow, Olsen and Kelce carried weight. Their message was clear: the rule may be frustrating, but it was applied correctly.As the playoffs move forward, debates over catches, control and survival are unlikely to fade. For now, one word from Joe Burrow and Travis Kelce’s amused reaction to it has become an unexpected footnote in another painful chapter of Bills playoff history.",The buffalo bills lost to the denver broncos in the nfl playoffs. A controversial interception ruling cost the bills the game. Joe burrow and travis kelce came out in support of the officials.

“Engaged to a mean girl and a bully”: Fans flood Travis Kelce’s Instagram with warnings and backlash amid Taylor Swift legal controversy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/engaged-to-a-mean-girl-and-a-bully-fans-flood-travis-kelces-instagram-with-warnings-and-backlash-amid-taylor-swift-legal-controversy/articleshow/127065979.cms,"Travis Kelce saw his Instagram flooded with criticism after texts linked Taylor Swift to the Justin Baldoni and Blake Lively legal drama. Fans posted warnings, insults, and emojis, dragging Kelce into the controversy as he weighs major decisions about his NFL future.

Taylor Swift backlash reaches Travis Kelce as fans turn his Instagram into a battleground

The noise did not start on a red carpet or in a courtroom. It started in a comment section. As fresh legal details tied Taylor Swift to the escalating Justin Baldoni and Blake Lively dispute, fans went looking for a pressure point. They found it on Travis Kelce’s Instagram.Within hours, Kelce’s page shifted from game talk to relationship judgment. Supporters, critics, and spectators crowded the space, reacting not to his play on the field but to his proximity to a storm he did not create. The reaction exposed how fast celebrity controversy now travels and how little separation exists between personal and public lives.“According to the docs, Taylor was anything but an innocent bystander who was set up by Blake during her NYC penthouse showdown with Justin Baldoni,” the report from TMZ stated. “In fact, Taylor seemed to be involved in Blake’s strategy, texting Blake, ‘If Justin was strategic, he would be like no Taylor Swift in the trailer because that gives you more power over the film, that’s your ally not his.’""In Lively’s deposition, she said, ‘I sent Taylor the script on her way to my apartment because Justin was still there, and I asked her to read them. I told her she didn’t have to, I didn’t want her to feel pressure to do that, but I hope that she would.’Taylor responded in text, ‘I’ll do anything for you!!’ Lively said at the apartment, Taylor endorsed the revised draft.”Travis Kelce’s comment section explodes after th messages resurface . One comment read, “Taylor, and Blake are exactly like Amber heard.” Another added, “Wow. How disappointing TS…”As screenshots spread, the tone hardened. A user wrote, “Taylor's messages to Blake she is not a nice girl. I would run Travis”. Another warned, “Travy you better run for the hills.”Others went further. “Love that Taylor can't handle the drama and turned off her comments!!!! What a baby” appeared among the replies. One of the most pointed messages asked, “What does it feel like to be engaged to someone who is a mean girl and a bully, and who was complicit in Regina Lively's plan to destroy an innocent man? #justiceforjustin”.The comments landed at a delicate moment. Kelce is weighing his NFL future after a disappointing end to the season with the Kansas City Chiefs. Instead of focusing on football decisions, his social feed became a live debate about loyalty, character, and guilt by association.What makes this episode travel so fast is not just fame. It is access. Fans now speak directly into the digital spaces of athletes and artists, collapsing distance and amplifying emotion. Kelce has not responded, and his comments remain open. For now, silence is his only defense as the internet keeps talking.","Travis kelce saw his instagram flooded with criticism after texts linked taylor swift to the justin baldoni and blake lively legal drama.

Jeanie Buss reacts to LeBron James report



What did the report say about Jeanie Buss and LeBron James?



The Los Angeles Lakers found themselves at the center of a fresh storm on Wednesday as a detailed ESPN report stirred questions about leadership, loyalty, and long-standing power dynamics. At the heart of the story was Jeanie Buss and her relationship with LeBron James . Certainly, their partnership is often viewed as one of the league’s most stable. The report challenged that perception and triggered immediate reaction across the NBA landscape.Buss did not allow the narrative to linger for long. Within hours, she publicly addressed the claims, revealing that her bond with the Lakers’ biggest star had never fractured. Her response reframed the discussion and redirected attention toward how off-court family matters had been intertwined with James’ name.Jeanie Buss moved quickly to distance LeBron James from what she described as internal family issues. Speaking to The Athletic, she rejected the idea that her appreciation for James had ever wavered. She further shared that the portrayals in the narrative are both inaccurate and unfair.“It’s really not right, given all the great things LeBron has done for the Lakers, that he has to be pulled into my family drama,” Buss said. “To say that it wasn’t appreciated is just not true and completely unfair to him.”Her words directly countered the ESPN report, which painted a picture of growing frustration behind closed doors. Buss emphasized respect for James’ contributions, including his role in delivering the franchise’s 2020 championship and helping sustain relevance during turbulent seasons.By responding early, Buss ensured James was not left answering questions about issues that were not his creation.The ESPN article, written by Baxter Holmes, described complicated internal dynamics following the sale of the Lakers’ majority stake to Mark Walter. According to team sources cited in the story, Buss had privately voiced concerns about James’ “outsized ego” and the influence of Klutch Sports within basketball operations.The report also revisited past flashpoints. These included frustration over accountability after the failed Russell Westbrook trade in the 2021-22 season and Buss’ belief that James did not show enough gratitude when the Lakers selected Bronny James with the No. 55 pick in the 2024 NBA Draft.“When the Lakers drafted James’ son Bronny with the 55th pick in the 2024 draft, Jeanie privately remarked that James should be grateful for such a gesture, but she felt that he wasn’t, people close to the team told ESPN,” the report stated.James’ agent Rich Paul brushed off the controversy on his podcast, offering a blunt dismissal of the speculation.“There’s an article written every day,” Paul said.James has not responded to the report as of writing.",Lakers owner jeanie buss responds to espn report on her relationship with lebron james.

Matchup Outlook

The Cleveland Cavaliers are in Charlotte on January 21, 2026, dealing with a short-handed lineup. Several rotation players are unavailable, which places more responsibility on the players who remain active.One question matters most before tipoff.. He is not listed as out or questionable and is cleared for the game. With other key players missing, Cleveland will rely heavily on him to run the offense.The game tips off at 7:00 p.m. ET at Spectrum Center. The broadcast will be available on ESPN, FDSSE, and FDSOH.Cleveland Cavaliers enter the game without Darius Garland, who is sidelined by a right great toe sprain. Max Strus remains out following left foot surgery, and Sam Merrill is unavailable due to a right hand sprain. These absences remove much of the Cavaliers’ backcourt depth and shooting.Charlotte is also missing key contributors. Mason Plumlee is out after right groin surgery, while KJ Simpson is sidelined with a left hip flexor injury. Rookie forward Tidjane Salaun is listed as probable despite left Achilles soreness.With Garland out, Mitchell becomes the primary ball-handler and main scoring option. There is no minutes restriction reported, and the team expects him to carry a large share of the offense.In Cleveland’s recent game against Oklahoma City on January 19, Donovan Mitchell scored 19 points. His shot was inconsistent, but he remained involved throughout and continued to create chances for teammates. That same approach is expected again in Charlotte.Also read: Is LaMelo Ball playing tonight vs the Cleveland Cavaliers? Latest update on the Charlotte Hornets star's injury report (January 21, 2026) Charlotte’s defense has allowed guards to get into the lane, which plays into Mitchell’s game. That is why scoring lines above 26.5 points have drawn attention.The Hornets will lean on LaMelo Ball and Brandon Miller to keep pace. For Cleveland, the plan is simple.

Cleveland arrives as the favorite, but injuries have narrowed the gap more than the odds suggest.LaMelo Ball has been on the floor consistently lately, suiting up for 14 straight games after a stop-start beginning to the season. There are no injury concerns heading into this one, and nothing suggests any limits on his workload.

Tip-off is scheduled for 7:00 p.m. ET.Cleveland remains the stronger team on paper, but missing key backcourt players changes the matchup.Charlotte, playing at home, will look to take advantage of those gaps, especially on the perimeter.Ball has been productive since returning to a steady rhythm. Over his last 14 games, he is averaging 20.9 points, 6.8 assists, 4.2 rebounds, and 1.3 steals. His outside shooting has stood out, with 3.7 made three-pointers per game over his last 10 outings.That shooting volume has driven expectations that he will again be Charlotte’s leading scorer.

The Cavaliers, however, will be missing several rotation players, which shifts more responsibility onto their remaining starters, particularly Donovan Mitchell.With Cleveland missing key pieces and Charlotte putting the ball in his hands, the game is likely to flow through Ball.

Matthew Stafford owns the result, but he said he “didn’t get into a great rhythm” vs. Bears

Kelly Stafford has a very specific NFL complaint this week, and it has nothing to do with coverages or play-calling.On Tuesday, Jan. 21, Stafford posted an Instagram story showing herself bouncing between team apps while trying to secure a ticket for the Los Angeles Rams’ upcoming NFC Championship Game against the Seattle Seahawks. Multiple outlets reported the post and her frustration.Stafford didn’t dress it up. She shared the clip and wrote, “Honestly though … this whole you have to download the other team’s app to get your ticket to the game is getting a little absurd,” per Sportskeeda’s report.That’s the part that hits because it’s relatable. Most fans expect one clean path to their seat. Stafford’s post suggests she had to jump through extra steps even with a direct tie to the Rams’ quarterback. She showed herself scrolling through other teams’ apps, including the Chicago Bears app, before deleting it and downloading the Seahawks app to try to book tickets for the next game.The timing matters. Stafford attended the Rams’ divisional-round playoff game against the Bears at Soldier Field on Sunday and posted photos afterward, including matching outerwear with her daughters. Sportskeeda reported her caption from that post: “Anyone else feel like the stress of these games is shaving years off your life??!2-0.#mvd Thank goodness the Rams handled the cold better than my jacket,” with the family wearing matching “Stafford” coats and Matthew Stafford’s No. 9.While Kelly Stafford’s story centered on ticket access, Matthew Stafford’s week still sits under the playoff microscope.After the divisional-round win, Stafford addressed his own performance in his postgame press conference on Sunday, Jan. 18. He commented: “I definitely didn’t get into a great rhythm today,” Stafford said. “There’s no question about that. Had some opportunities in the past game. Just some things that made it tough.

Tyreek Hill reacts as Mike McDaniel is expected to join the Los Angeles Chargers

Tyreek Hill is once again getting NFL fans talking. On Tuesday night, the Miami Dolphins wide receiver reacted online after news broke that former Dolphins head coach Mike McDaniel is expected to become the Los Angeles Chargers’ new offensive coordinator. Tyreek Hill’s short post quickly went viral and made many people wonder if he could one day follow his former coach to the West Coast.The timing of Tyreek Hill’s message stood out. As he continues to recover from a serious leg injury, his reaction suggested he is still closely watching coaching moves around the league. For many fans, it felt like a small hint that Tyreek Hill would be open to reuniting with Mike McDaniel again.On Tuesday, ESPN insider Adam Schefter reported that Mike McDaniel is expected to become the Los Angeles Chargers’ offensive coordinator.The report said McDaniel has told other teams he is no longer looking for a head coaching job and that the Chargers are his clear focus.Adam Schefter wrote on X, “Former Dolphins HC Mike McDaniel is expected to become the Chargers offensive coordinator barring a change of heart, per Jeff Darlington and me.McDaniel has informed other teams that they’re out, the Chargers clearly want him, and the two sides are having dinner tonight. But the expectation across the league is that McDaniel will be staying in LA.”Soon after that post went live on Tuesday night, Tyreek Hill shared his own reaction on X. He wrote, “Mike to the chargers hm.”The short message was simple, but many fans took it as a sign that Tyreek Hill liked the idea of Mike McDaniel working in Los Angeles.If the move becomes official, Mike McDaniel would be joining Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert . The pairing would give Los Angeles one of the league’s most creative offensive minds working with one of its strongest young passers.Mike McDaniel first became Tyreek Hill’s head coach in 2022, when the Miami Dolphins hired McDaniel and traded for Hill from the Kansas City Chiefs.That same year, Tyreek Hill had one of the best seasons of his career. He finished with over 1,700 receiving yards and was one of the most feared receivers in the NFL.Tyreek Hill followed that up with another huge season in 2023, again passing 1,700 receiving yards under Mike McDaniel’s offense.Those two years are widely seen as the most productive of Tyreek Hill’s career. The Dolphins later fired Mike McDaniel at the end of the 2025 regular season after the team failed to meet expectations.Tyreek Hill’s own 2025 season ended early and painfully. In September 2025, he suffered a serious leg injury during a game, dislocating his knee and tearing multiple ligaments, including his ACL.Since then, Tyreek Hill has been focused on rehab and recovery. Even while injured, Tyreek Hill has dropped hints about possible future moves.In November 2025, he posted “I need to go home” on X, which many fans linked to a possible return to the Kansas City Chiefs. Now, with Mike McDaniel heading toward Los Angeles, Tyreek Hill’s latest post has opened the door to another possible reunion story.",Mike mcdaniel is expected to become the los angeles chargers' offensive coordinator.

He has been on the list since the Denver game in 2005. However, he never came close to receiving enough votes this year to advance to the West Conference's starting five.

NBA commissioner Adam Silver will step in to fill the teams if there aren't enough domestic or foreign players for the All-Star reserves chosen by the NBA coaches.Position will not be a factor in the selection of this year's All-Stars. A survey of NBA players (25%), a media panel (25%), and a fan vote (50%) were used to choose the starters. Ernst & Young, a major accounting and services company, oversaw and approved the surveys.Later, the method for allocating the players to the two American teams will be decided.

Carlos Beltrán’s Hall of Fame election brings back Astros scandal debate

Carlos Beltrán was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame on Tuesday night after getting enough votes from the Baseball Writers’ Association of America. The former MLB outfielder built a powerful 20-year career, playing for teams like the Kansas City Royals, Houston Astros, New York Mets, and New York Yankees. He finished with 435 home runs, over 2,700 hits, and nine All-Star selections, numbers that placed him among the top players of his generation.But minutes after the results were announced, the focus quickly shifted from his stats to his past. Many MLB fans began questioning why Carlos Beltrán was honored, because he was directly tied to the Houston Astros’ 2017 sign-stealing scandal. On social media, fans shared shock, anger, and confusion, saying his role in the scandal should have mattered more in the Hall of Fame vote.Major League Baseball released its investigation report in January 2020 after looking into how the Houston Astros used illegal video systems during their 2017 season.The report said the team broke league rules by using cameras to steal catchers’ signs and pass them to hitters.Carlos Beltrán, who was playing his final season in 2017, was the only player mentioned by name in that report. MLB investigators said he played a major role in the system and was seen as a clubhouse leader behind it.Because of that finding, Beltrán lost his job as New York Mets manager before ever managing a game. When the scandal became public, the Mets and Beltrán agreed to part ways.After his Hall of Fame election, fans quickly reposted old headlines and clips. One fan wrote, “How is the only player named in the cheating report now in Cooperstown?” Another said, “Great player, but the scandal changed everything.”After the results were announced, Carlos Beltrán spoke about the moment and his past. He thanked the writers who voted for him and admitted his career included both proud and difficult chapters.In a short statement shared through media outlets, Beltrán said he was grateful for the honor and understood why people still talk about 2017. He added that baseball taught him many lessons, on and off the field.The Hall of Fame induction ceremony is scheduled to take place in Cooperstown, New York, this summer, where Beltrán will officially receive his plaque. Until then, the debate continues.Some fans believe his career numbers earned him the spot. Others feel the scandal should have closed the door forever.Online, the reaction remains split, emotional, and loud, showing how deeply the 2017 Astros season still lives in the minds of baseball fans.","Carlos beltrán was elected to the national baseball hall of fame on tuesday night.

Kris Knoblauch questions Oilers’ urgency after third-period turnover last night

The Edmonton Oilers saw another opportunity slip away Tuesday night. Despite a dominant third-period push that saw them outshoot their visitors 13-3 in the final frame, the home side could not overcome a two-goal deficit as New Jersey held on for a 2-1 victory at Rogers Place.The loss marked a frustrating pattern for a club desperately trying to build momentum in the standings. Edmonton entered the contest riding a two-game winning streak and looking to string together three consecutive victories for the first time all season, only to fall short once again in a tight contest that exposed lingering concerns about the team's approach and consistency.Oilers head coach Kris Knoblauch addressed the defeat with candid observations about his team's mentality through the opening 40 minutes. When asked how the third period looked so different from the first two, Knoblauch pointed to a critical shift in urgency.""We just played with urgency and simplicity,"" Knoblauch said. ""We just wanted to win in the third period, where I think we just kind of thought it was going to be easy. Once we dug in in the third period and showed its emergency and nothing fancy, we didn't drop any plays.”Knobauch believes that once the team played with more seriousness, they got a lot faster and even ended up winning some more battles.However, while the franchise also got a few scoring chances, Edmonton couldn’t capitalize on the occasion, and New Jersey took the win.The assessment drew a pointed follow-up question about whether it was frustrating that the team thought victory would come easily, given Edmonton has not won three straight games all season. Knoblauch did not shy away from the concern.""Absolutely, yeah, the fact that we haven't been able to get a little run,"" Knoblauch said. ""We want to obviously get some momentum and win some games in a row, and that's how you climb up the standings. I like the fact that we respond well after losses.”While the Oilers continue to have a good record of 25-18-8 as they stand second in the Pacific Division just behind Vegas, Knoblauch wants something more. He wants Edmonton to finally get that third win in a row and start building momentum for the playoffs.The Oilers will have the chance to avenge this loss on Thursday night as the Pittsburgh Penguins pay a visit to Rogers Place. Sidney Crosby looks to be in top form, so Edmonton will need to bring their A-game unless they want to drop another game.",Edmonton oilers lost 2-1 to new jersey devils on tuesday night.

Michael J. Spears draws a Jordan vs. LeBron parallel



LeBron James will be absent from West’s All-Star first five



For the first time since 2004, the All-Star hardwood will be missing one of its most prominent figures. LeBron James, the league’s all-time leading scorer and a 21-time All-Star starter, was notably absent when the Western Conference All-Star starters were announced on Monday.The King finished at 8 on the All-Star voting and was overshadowed by players like teammate Luka Dončić , reigning MVP Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, and the skyrocketing Victor Wembanyama. While some saw this as a natural response to the upcoming generational talents, Marc J. Spears of ESPN drew a parallel to Michael Jordan's 2003 All-Star starter snub. This story reminded the fans that time doesn’t stop for anyone, not even the greatest titans.""Michael Jordan went through the same thing in 2003,"" Spears noted. ""The difference is Michael Jordan said he was retiring."" The comment has ignited a firestorm across NBA social media, speculating whether this step is the beginning of LeBron’s farewell tour.In 2003, a 40-year-old Michael Jordan was famously voted in as a reserve, only to have Vince Carter give up his starting spot as a gesture of respect. Like MJ back then, LeBron is currently battling the ravages of time at 41.Despite averaging 22.5 points, 7 assists, and 6.0 rebounds in his 23rd season, James missed 14 games early this year due to sciatica, something that was a bold indication of his body aging.Michael Jordan’s 2003 snub felt like a final goodbye because the world knew he was hanging them up. But with LeBron, the silence regarding his retirement makes this absence less of a tribute and more like a cold block. The fans still love him, as shown through the 1.8 million votes he received, but that wasn’t enough to crack the first five.The West conference starting five includes the greatest shooter, Stephen Curry, Slovenian sensation Luka Dončić, 2024-25 MVP SGA, Serbian star center Nikola Jokić, and French prodigy Victor Wembanyama. This lineup, dominated by international stars, represents a combination of elite fan power and the shift to new generational talents, and it left LeBron on the outside.While LeBron could still make the roster as a reserve chosen by coaches, the aura of invincibility surrounding his All-Star status has finally cracked. Whether he follows the Jordan path of a pre-announced exit or continues to defy physics into his early 40s, the 2026 All-Star starters list proves that the NBA landscape has officially moved on from its longest-tenured ruler.","Lebron james will be absent from west’s all-star first five for the first time since 2004.

Cole Caufield’s last-second goal saves Montreal Canadiens from overtime

The Montreal Canadiens snatched victory from the jaws of defeat on Tuesday night in dramatic fashion. Cole Caufield scored with just 15 seconds remaining in regulation to lift Montreal to a thrilling 4-3 victory over the Minnesota Wild at Bell Centre.The dramatic winner gave the Canadiens their third and final lead of the evening. Caufield's heroics continued his remarkable track record of delivering in clutch moments throughout his young career. He also entered a very exclusive club with his latest goal and joined other all-time greats.Caufield positioned himself at the top of the right faceoff circle as the Canadiens desperately searched for the game-tying goal. Nick Suzuki found him with a perfect pass that the winger one-timed past Jesper Wallstedt's glove before the goaltender could react.The goal completed Montreal's comeback and sent the Bell Centre crowd into a frenzy. The Canadiens had battled back multiple times throughout the game before finally breaking through in the dying seconds.""We just found a way to keep the puck alive, and luckily it went in,"" Caufield said modestly after the game.""That's why you play the full 60 or 65, whatever it is. They all count the same, but it feels good to get two points tonight.""The dramatic goal represented Caufield's 21st game-winning goal in the third period or overtime since his NHL debut in 2020-21. That total puts the 24-year-old in elite company among the league's most clutch performers.Only four players have scored more such goals over that span. Leon Draisaitl and Sebastian Aho lead the way with 28 apiece, while Sidney Crosby and Steven Stamkos have each recorded 23.For Caufield to rank fifth on that list at his age speaks volumes about his ability to deliver when games hang in the balance. The former first-round pick has developed a reputation as a clutch scorer who thrives under pressure.The victory also marked the return of forward Kirby Dach to the Canadiens' lineup. The 24-year-old played 16:46 in his first game since breaking his foot on November 15.Dach registered two shots on goal while shaking off the rust after missing nearly two months of action. His return would finally give the Canadiens a reliable name in the 2C position as the franchise continues to battle through an extremely competitive Atlantic Division.With both the Tampa Bay Lightning and Detroit Red Wings giving Montreal a run for its money, Dach’s return has given head coach Martin St. Louis another possible choice for his top six.",Cole caufield scored with just 15 seconds remaining in regulation to lift montreal to a thrilling 4-3 victory over the minnesota wild at bell centre.

Cody Bellinger’s versatility could help the New York Mets more than the New York Yankees

Cody Bellinger, the two-time All-Star outfielder and free agent, has become the most talked-about player in the MLB offseason this January 2026. Bellinger chose out of his contract to try free agency after having a very successful season with the New York Yankees in 2025, hitting .272 with 29 home runs and driving in 98 runs.While the Yankees sought him back and supposedly presented a significant deal, Bellinger and his crew have not settled on terms.

A well-known MLB insider said Bellinger is more than just a hitter, he’s like a “Swiss army knife” who can fill many roles for a team.MLB insider Joel Sherman said on January 22, 2026, that Bellinger’s ability to play many positions makes him a special player, especially for the New York Mets.Sherman said Bellinger can play all outfield spots, can play first base, hits well against left-handed pitchers, and has a high baseball IQ. He also said Bellinger knows how to handle big media cities like New York, which is important for both fanbases.Sherman added that for the Mets, Bellinger could solve problems the team still has after trading away some players and missing out on other stars like Kyle Tucker.The Mets have changed their roster a lot, and Bellinger could add more value because he can be in many spots on the field.The New York Mets didn’t stop at talking about Bellinger. On January 20–21, 2026, the Mets traded for outfielder Luis Robert Jr. from the Chicago White Sox in exchange for infielder Luisangel Acuña and pitching prospect Truman Pauley.Robert is known for his defense and speed, even if his bat was not as strong last season, and he could fill a big role in left or center field for the Mets.Earlier in the offseason, the Mets also signed shortstop Bo Bichette to a large contract after losing out on free agent Kyle Tucker to the Los Angeles Dodgers.These moves show that the Mets are trying many ways to improve their roster this winter. As they add players like Bichette and Robert, their need for Bellinger might change, but his versatility still keeps him in the conversation.","Cody bellinger, the two-time all-star outfielder and free agent, has become the most talked-about player in the mlb offseason.
