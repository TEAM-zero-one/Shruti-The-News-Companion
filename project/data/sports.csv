Nestor Cortes immediate impact of elbow strain

Nestor Cortes's injury history and future outlook

The Milwaukee Brewers issued a statement declaring that Nestor Cortes, their starting pitcher, has been put on the 15-day injured list owing to a strain in his left elbow flexor. The move questions the depth of the pitching staff and also Nestor Cortes' health, more so considering the history of similar injuries.The Brewers put left-hander Nestor Cortes on the 15-day injured list on April 6, 2025, because of a left elbow flexor strain . It is the second time in eight months that Nestor Cortes has suffered this specific injury; he was previously out due to the same reason playing for the New York Yankees in September 2024. Despite that, he was available again in time to serve during the World Series.Nestor Cortes has had a rollercoaster ride of a season in terms of ups and downs. He miserably failed in his debut for the Brewers, giving up eight runs, five of which were home runs, over two innings against his old team, the Yankees. He returned with vengeance in his second appearance, throwing six shutout innings and taking the Brewers to a nail-biting 1-0 win against the Cincinnati Reds.Nestor Cortes' chronic elbow problem is concerning. His previous IL stint back in September of 2024 was also attributed to the same flexor strain. Even in light of all these, Brewers assistant GM Matt Kleine sounded optimistic by describing the current injury as unlikely to be a ""long-term issue.""During his career, Cortes has recorded 34-22 with a 3.88 ERA in 137 games. The Brewers bullpen has been significantly damaged by the early injury troubles of the season. Nestor Cortes is the seventh rotation starter to have gone onto the injured list, proving the team's ongoing issue of keeping healthy in the rotation.While the Brewers endure these missteps, attention will be given to their roster and seeing that guys like Cortes are given whatever care they must have to again get back into top form. Team officials, along with the fans, will be watching eagerly for his comeback, hoping he can come back swiftly and fully in action on the mound.Also Read: “Going To Learn A Lot”: Brewers’ Nestor Cortes Reflects On Tough Game Against New York Yankees","Nestor cortes has been put on the 15-day injured list with a left elbow flexor strain.

“Naturally hate him”: Pat McAfee didn’t shy away from connecting Travis Kelce’s public image and his relationship with Taylor Swift,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/naturally-hate-him-pat-mcafee-didnt-shy-away-from-connecting-travis-kelces-public-image-and-his-relationship-with-taylor-swift/articleshow/120038534.cms,"Image via Getty Images

Taylor Swift’s influence shines as Travis Kelce makes $3.3 million donation to homeless youth in Kansas City

Pat McAfee opened up on Travis Kelce’s generosity while acknowledging Taylor Swift’s impact on his growing philanthropic presence. While Travis Kelce continues to make headlines as a Kansas City Chiefs superstar and a three-time Super Bowl champion, it’s his growing off-field legacy that’s earning admiration this week—one that’s closely tied to his high-profile relationship with Taylor Swift . The NFL tight end has made a powerful philanthropic move, donating $3.3 million toward a transitional home for homeless youth in Kansas City, and some are crediting Swift’s influence as part of the inspiration behind it.The 6,500-square-foot facility, built in partnership with the nonprofit Foster Love, will offer more than just a roof over young people’s heads. Designed with heart and purpose, the home includes six bedrooms, five bathrooms, a game room, a study area, a spacious kitchen, and outdoor features like a fire pit and garden. But more importantly, it will provide mentorship, education, and a sense of belonging to youth who are often overlooked.Pat McAfee, speaking on his ESPN show, didn’t shy away from connecting Kelce’s public image and his relationship with Swift to this generous gesture. “There are people that just naturally hate him because he's very popular, very famous,” McAfee said. “Especially now because he's dating the most popular and famous person in the world in Taylor Swift.”He emphasized that Kelce’s decision to invest in social good over luxury or personal gain should be celebrated: “So him giving back, making the world a better place, I think should be chatted about.” McAfee added, “He could have bought something for himself or his family but instead wanted to give it back to society.”Kelce’s charity work isn’t new. Through his 87 & Running Foundation, established in 2015, he’s long championed programs for underserved youth, focusing on education, leadership, and athletics. However, this latest donation feels like a deeper evolution—both in scale and intention.Also Read: Bon Iver’s Justin Vernon calls Taylor Swift’s ‘Exile’ performance an ‘out of body’ moment during Eras Tour reflection Swift’s presence seems to align with this transformation. Known for her own extensive philanthropic efforts, including recent multimillion-dollar disaster relief donations, she brings with her a culture of giving and a massive spotlight—one that may be encouraging Kelce to broaden his impact.In the end, this isn’t just about a donation—it’s about a growing legacy shaped by love, leadership, and the desire to give back.","Travis kelce donated $3.3 million toward a transitional home for homeless youth in kansas city.

NFL Rumors: Aaron Rodgers reportedly prefers Vikings over Steelers despite Tomlin connection,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/nfl-rumors-aaron-rodgers-reportedly-prefers-vikings-over-steelers-despite-tomlin-connection/articleshow/120038440.cms,"Image via Imagn Images

Aaron Rodgers is weighing legacy versus fit as he eyes the NFC North for one last run

Vikings offer a legacy move, but JJ McCarthy may be in the way



Aaron Rodgers is once again at the center of NFL offseason drama, and this time, his decision could reshape the balance of power in the NFC North. While the Pittsburgh Steelers are considered the frontrunners in the race to land the four-time MVP, fresh reports suggest that Rodgers has his sights set elsewhere—specifically, the Minnesota Vikings.Although Rodgers has been linked to Mike Tomlin’s Steelers in what many believe would be a natural pairing, the quarterback reportedly finds himself drawn to the Vikings’ high-powered offense and young talent. The franchise finished 14-3 last season and boasts superstar wideout Justin Jefferson, whose precise routes have been described as “Picasso with cleats.”Rodgers has long admired Minnesota’s head coach Kevin O’Connell, describing him as a “synchronized QB whisperer.” Their mutual respect dates back years, and Rodgers seems to see something special in this Vikings system. “I’ve always respected Mike [Tomlin] from afar,” Rodgers acknowledged in December, “but Minnesota’s built different.”While Rodgers appears to favor a Minnesota move, the team’s recent decision to draft quarterback JJ McCarthy may block his path. O’Connell is playing it cool, stating, “We’re rolling with JJ… unless he faceplants.” Translation? Rodgers’ shot at wearing purple and gold may depend entirely on whether the rookie struggles out of the gate.Still, for Rodgers, who famously values self-reflection, this may be about more than schemes and stats. “Authenticity is everything. You want to be proud of the person in the mirror,” he once said. And perhaps Minnesota, a franchise ready to contend but still searching for its next legendary QB, offers that clarity.Over in Pittsburgh, Tomlin is reportedly all-in. Multiple meetings, extended calls, and an open-ended approach show his willingness to bring Rodgers into the fold. But with Mason Rudolph re-signed and wide receiver George Pickens waiting for a consistent QB1, the Steelers may not feel like the perfect match.Also Read: Aaron Rodgers is the NFL’s problem child — and the league just can’t seem to let go Their $32.9 million in cap space could be stretched to meet Rodgers' rumored $40 million price tag—but does Rodgers see them as contenders or pretenders? At 41, he’s not chasing contracts—he’s chasing legacy. And if legacy means owning the NFC North one more time, then don’t be surprised if Rodgers rides off in purple instead of black and gold.","Aaron rodgers is weighing legacy versus fit as he eyes the nfc north for one last run.

Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) face Gujarat Titans (GT) at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Hyderabad today, desperate to halt a three-match losing streak.Despite an explosive 286-run start to the IPL season, SRH’s all-out attacking approach has backfired, with scores of 190, 163, and 120 in the subsequent games.Their batting stars, including Travis Head, Ishan Kishan, and Heinrich Klaasen, have failed to deliver consistently, and the bowling unit — led by skipper Pat Cummins — has struggled, with high economy rates and no bowler completing four overs in every match.Also See: GT vs SRH Live Score, IPL 2025 Currently at the bottom of the points table, SRH risk slipping out of playoff contention.In contrast, the Gujarat Titans are gaining momentum, buoyed by a big win over RCB. With a strong top order of Gill, Sudharsan and Buttler, and finishers like Rutherford and Tewatia, they look balanced.While Rabada’s absence is a blow, options like Coetzee or Phillips could fill the gap. Titans also boast a more disciplined bowling attack, giving them an edge.Hyderabad’s red soil pitch promises bounce and carry, but it slows as the ball ages. Despite average boundaries (69m, 67m, 79m), on average 24 sixes are hit per game. It’s a dry, grassless, firm surface.

Inside Jordon Hudson’s 24th birthday bash and how she’s honoring Bill Belichick’s latest coaching move



Jordon Hudson ’s 24th birthday wasn’t just about cakes and candles—it became a heartfelt celebration of love, loyalty, and life’s unexpected journeys. The former college cheerleader and current partner of legendary NFL coach Bill Belichick used her special day to offer a unique tribute to the man who has stood beside her despite the headlines, criticism, and their 48-year age gap.On April 4, Jordon Hudson took to Instagram to showcase a thoughtful snapshot: a bouquet of red roses and a University of North Carolina basketball jersey with “Jordon” emblazoned above the number 24. It wasn’t just a birthday nod—it was a clever homage to her own age and Michael Jordan’s college legacy, all while acknowledging Belichick’s new beginning with the Tar Heels. The jersey symbolized more than a gift—it marked her deep-rooted support for Belichick as he transitions into his first-ever college football coaching role.It’s not the first time Hudson has publicly backed her partner. After facing online scrutiny over their relationship, she shared a bold message on Instagram in December 2024: ""Nothing changed for us in 2024 except for 'public knowledge': yet somehow everything changed. Going strong. I can't wait to take punches for you in 2025. Keep swinging, Keyboard Warriors. Your illusion of righteousness only fuels my authenticity."" Her statement echoed the kind of emotional resilience that often keeps high-profile relationships afloat.The pair's journey began in an unlikely setting—on a flight to Florida in February 2021. Hudson, then a college student with a passion for philosophy, had Belichick sign her “Deductive Logic” textbook. He penned a note that read, “Thanks for giving me a course on logic! Safe travels! Bill Belichick,” complete with Super Bowl win numbers. That simple exchange bloomed into a connection that, despite public skepticism, has only grown stronger.In February 2025, Jordon Hudson commemorated their four-year “meetiversary” with a post saying, “Happy Meetiversary @billbelichick — Cheers 🥂 to the fact that you still let me give you lengthy philosophical lectures four years later.” A slideshow accompanied the caption, featuring a touching photo of the couple holding hands during Super Bowl week in New Orleans.Her recent birthday post also included a stylish red beaded handbag by STAUD, inspired by the Year of the Snake—a nod to Hudson’s creative side. Fans have often seen glimpses of her DIY flair, whether it’s bedazzling a UNC sweatshirt or crafting a rhinestone lobster purse to raise awareness for Maine fishermen.While Belichick is gearing up for his new role at UNC, their life together continues to reflect a delicate balance between legacy and love.

A rainy race day on the cards at the Japanese Grand Prix

After Australia, another wet and wild race is on the cards at the Japanese Grand Prix on Sunday. Red Bull’s Max Verstappen secured pole position on Saturday, setting the stage for the final race at Suzuka. According to the weather forecast, there are chances of rain during the race, which has made his fans even more confident about his victory. However, it's difficult to predict what will happen at the Suzuka Circuit , as it’s not just Verstappen in the race—McLaren’s Lando Norris is also a strong contender and is high on confidence after winning the rain-affected race in Melbourne.The race will start at 2 p.m. local time. It will take place over 53 laps of the 5.807-kilometre Suzuka Circuit and is expected to last around 2 hours.According to the weather forecast shared by the FIA, showers are likely in the morning, which could dampen the dry grass. The temperature is expected to be higher than on the first two days, hovering around 17 degrees Celsius. After the morning showers, it may become a bit cloudy, with slightly reduced chances of rain during the race. However, the timing of the rain is unpredictable, and track conditions could fluctuate between wet and dry throughout the day.The storm and rain in Australia had overturned race strategies for many, resulting in multiple incidents and crashes on the wet track. In Japan, there's more to worry about than just the track. The frequent grass fires during practice sessions and qualifying race left drivers frustrated due to multiple red flags and the loss of precious time. Drivers may lose sleep over the weather prediction for Sunday, but many Formula 1 fans are expecting a more unpredictable and exciting race.As the official X (formerly Twitter) handle of Formula 1 asked the fans, “Anyone packed an umbrella?” many expressed their desire to see a wet race. One fan tweeted, “That would make things interesting.” Another wrote, “I would actually like to see a wet race. More chances to see Max coming out on top.” “Oh, exciting... Australia repeat?” asked a fan. One fan also said sarcastically, “At least the grass won’t burn.” Another comment read, “What’s with F1 scheduling races on every rainy weekend? Get it together, FIA.”Also Read: Grass Fires at the Japanese Grand Prix: Causes, concerns and why current efforts aren't enough Many, including Lewis Hamilton and Oscar Piastri, struggled in the rain-hit season opener in Melbourne.

NEW DELHI: Young spinner Digvesh Singh Rathi is making waves in IPL 2025 for two standout reasons — his impressive bowling performances and a unique action that mirrors mystery spinner Sunil Narine . Rathi delivered a composed and effective spell during Lucknow Super Giants ' 12-run win over Mumbai Indians. His figures of 1/21 in the high-scoring clash earned him the Player of the Match award.With Lucknow Super Giants gearing up to face Kolkata Knight Riders next, LSG skipper Rishabh Pant helped fulfill Rathi's dream of meeting his idol, Narine.In a video shared by LSG, Pant is seen walking alongside Narine during a practice session at Eden Gardens in Kolkata and introducing the two.“The great Rathi. The great Sunil Narine,” Pant says while bringing them together.Also See: IPL Live Score, SRH vs GT “Hanji.. yahi hai,” Pant tells Rathi, pointing towards Narine.After receiving the Player of the Match award, Rathi had shared: “I saw Sunil Narine bowl, and since then I’ve loved bowling.""“I want to make my mindset more attacking, like Sunil Narine. The way he handles pressure situations, he stays calm there too. I also want to do that,” he said.Approximately five years ago, during open trials conducted by the Delhi and District Cricket Association (DDCA) for the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, Rathi faced a pivotal moment.After delivering a ball that was dispatched out of the ground by an established IPL player, he sought a replacement ball but was instead sidelined for the remainder of the trials, ultimately not making the shortlist.Undeterred by this setback, Rathi resolved to refine his bowling skills, focusing intensely on minimizing runs conceded. He immersed himself in local club and corporate matches around Delhi-NCR, where maintaining an economical bowling rate was crucial for continued selection and match fees.Emulating Narine, Rathi transformed his bowling style to prioritise accuracy and control, aiming to prevent boundaries and earn recognition for his disciplined approach.This dedication bore fruit when the Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) recognized his potential and included him in their squad for IPL 2025.

Jos Buttler Exclusive Interview: I owe Jayawardene for letting me open in T20

Saturday served up a doubleheader delight for IPL fans. In the opening clash, Delhi Capitals extended their unbeaten streak in IPL 2025 with a 25-run victory over five-time champions Chennai Super Kings at the MA Chidambaram Stadium. Later in the evening, Rajasthan Royals produced a dominant performance, thrashing Punjab Kings by 50 runs at the Maharaja Yadavindra Singh International Cricket Stadium.Delhi Capitals climbed to the top of the IPL 2025 points table with a historic win at Chepauk, their first victory at the venue since 2010. Powered by a classy 77 from KL Rahul, who opened in place of the injured Faf du Plessis, DC posted a competitive 183/6. Chennai Super Kings, despite a valiant unbeaten 69 from Vijay Shankar, managed only 158/5 in response, handing Delhi a 25-run win.DC’s bowlers executed their plans to perfection on a surface that didn’t allow free stroke-play. Vipraj Nigam impressed with figures of 2/27, while the rest of the bowling unit chipped in, barring Mohit Sharma and Axar Patel.Mukesh Kumar gave DC the ideal start, removing Rachin Ravindra with a return catch off a leading edge. Mitchell Starc then trapped Ruturaj Gaikwad with a short ball that was pulled straight to deep square leg. Nigam joined the party by dismissing Devon Conway, and CSK’s powerplay ended at a shaky 46/3.With the pitch slowing down, DC kept Shivam Dube and Shankar in check. Dube eventually fell for 18 to Nigam, and Kuldeep Yadav struck with a googly to trap Ravindra Jadeja leg-before for two. Though Shankar was given a few lifelines—two dropped chances and a missed lbw—he broke a 28-ball boundary drought with a couple of crisp shots, bringing up his fifty off 43 balls.MS Dhoni, playing in front of his family, provided late fireworks with an unbeaten 30 off 26 balls, but the target proved too much as CSK suffered their second consecutive home loss. Yashasvi Jaiswal returned to form in style, scoring a fluent 67 to lead Rajasthan Royals to a commanding 50-run win over Punjab Kings at the Maharaja Yadavindra Singh International Cricket Stadium in Mullanpur.Jaiswal, who had struggled in his first three outings, struck three fours and five sixes in his 45-ball knock, sharing an 89-run opening stand with skipper Sanju Samson (38). Riyan Parag (43* off 25) and Shimron Hetmyer (20) provided the finishing touches as RR posted a daunting 205/4—the first 200-plus total at the venue in six matches.In reply, Punjab never recovered from the double blow inflicted by Jofra Archer in the first over. Archer dismissed Priyansh Arya with the first ball of the innings and sent back captain Shreyas Iyer with the last, finishing with 3/25.Despite a counterattacking 62 off 41 balls from Nehal Wadhera and a brisk 30 from Glenn Maxwell, Punjab’s chase crumbled. The pair added 88 runs before Maheesh Theekshana dismissed Maxwell, and Wanindu Hasaranga struck the next ball to remove Wadhera.

NEW DELHI: Chennai Super Kings ' lack of urgency in a tricky chase cost them dearly as they slumped to a 25-run defeat against Delhi Capitals in their Indian Premier League 2025 clash at the MA Chidambaram Stadium on Saturday.Chasing 184, CSK were reeling at 74/5 in 10.4 overs when MS Dhoni walked in — his earliest entry in a full 20-over match since 2023. With 110 needed off 56 balls, he joined Vijay Shankar , who was on 24 off 23. The stage was set for a counterattack, but what followed was a sluggish and baffling passage of play.Despite their reputation as big-hitters, Dhoni and Shankar crawled to just 32 runs in the next 4.2 overs. Shankar eventually brought up his fifty in the 17th over off 43 balls — the slowest half-century of the season. Alarmingly, CSK now account for three of the four slowest fifties in IPL 2025 , raising concerns over the intent of their batters.Also See: SRH vs GT, IPL Live Score Dhoni, too, endured a forgettable outing. His first boundary — a six off Mukesh Kumar — came off the 19th ball he faced, the slowest any batter has taken to hit a boundary in this season. Though the duo added an unbeaten 84-run partnership, it came in 9.2 overs — far too passive to make an impact.Earlier, KL Rahul anchored Delhi’s innings with a classy 77 off 51 balls to take them to 183/6.
