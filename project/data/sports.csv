How “Tweaker” Became a Cultural Phenomenon

GELO - Tweaker (Official Video)

Tweaker 's Chart Domination and Viral Impact on Fans

How LiAngelo Ball Went From Basketball to Music Trailblazer

LiAngelo Ball’s transformation from overlooked basketball prospect to music industry headliner has officially reached a historic milestone. His debut single “Tweaker,” released under the stage name Gelo, has achieved platinum status - an achievement that puts him in the same conversation as heavyweight artists like Drake . For an athlete-turned-musician, this level of success is both unprecedented and culturally significant, signaling a genuine crossover moment that few have ever achieved.In addition to redefining LiAngelo's public persona, this achievement represents the pinnacle of a swift ascent that started in early 2025. LiAngelo, a musician who was frequently overshadowed by his brothers Lonzo and LaMelo Ball, has carved out a whole new path, demonstrating that his musical drive and artistic intuition were much more than a curiosity.Released in January 2025, “Tweaker” exploded online almost instantly. Its nostalgic, bouncy beat - powered by piano, organ keys, and lush synth pads - captured the spirit of early-2000s hip-hop. Paired with Gelo’s melodic, sing-song delivery and a catchy “whoa” hook reminiscent of Big Tymers-era anthems, the track resonated widely. Produced by Kunica and Glockie Cheez, the song painted a picture of luxury, swagger, and newfound fame, creating an irresistible vibe that appealed to both younger listeners and fans of classic hip-hop aesthetics.Its momentum grew even stronger as the song spread into sports culture. NBA and NFL teams, including the Detroit Lions, Chicago Bulls, and Cleveland Cavaliers, embraced “Tweaker” as a celebratory anthem in locker rooms and warm-up sessions, pushing its reach far beyond the usual music circles.The success of “Tweaker” eventually led to a massive $13 million record deal with Def Jam and Universal Music Group. The contract included an extraordinary $8 million guaranteed signing bonus—more than what many current NBA players earn annually. This landmark deal solidified Gelo’s credibility and marketability within the hip-hop and R&B world.Adding even more momentum, a high-profile remix featuring Lil Wayne elevated the track’s status, giving it a stamp of approval from one of rap’s most influential figures.“Tweaker” made history by reaching No. 1 on the US Rhythmic Billboard chart - an exceptional feat for a debut single from a former basketball player. The song sparked viral dance trends across social platforms and earned praise from artists like T-Pain, Lil Yachty, and Joe Budden. Its appeal spanned music, sports, and online culture, cementing LiAngelo Ball as 2025’s breakout music star.Before rising to prominence in the music industry, LiAngelo Ball spent years navigating the NBA G-League and international basketball leagues. Eventually, he gave up the sport entirely, a decision that was validated by his outstanding achievements. His debut album League of My Own, which was released in July 2025, showcased his growth as a musician and cemented his place in the industry.Also read: Angel Reese responds with 4-word message after her name is dragged into viral NBA courtside altercation LiAngelo Ball’s platinum achievement for “Tweaker” is more than a win for himself - it is a defining cultural moment.

LiAngelo Ball’s Viral Comments on Tipping

Lonzo Ball Pushes Back, Defends Traditional Tipping Norms

A Closer Look at the Tipping Culture Divide

What This Debate Reveals About Changing Social Expectations

has unexpectedly thrust himself into the national spotlight - this time not for basketball highlights, but for a conversation that touches a nerve across America: tipping culture. What began as a casual remark during a family podcast episode quickly transformed into a viral talking point, igniting debates about wealth, responsibility, service work, and changing social expectations. With many already frustrated by rising tipping prompts and surcharges, Ball’s comments landed in the middle of an ongoing cultural clash.The discussion resonated so widely because it cut across demographics - fans, service workers, and everyday diners all joined in. For some, Ball’s stance echoed a growing fatigue over automatic tipping expectations. For others, it came across as tone-deaf coming from a multimillionaire athlete. In essence, one candid confession about restaurant habits opened the door to a sprawling, emotionally charged conversation.LiAngelo Ball, the middle brother of the well-known Ball family, revealed that he typically leaves between $10 and $20 in tips—even on restaurant bills reaching $400 or more.He shared this openly during a recent episode of the “Ball in the Family Podcast,” sparking intense discussion online and among sports fans. According to Ball, this habit reflects his philosophy on tipping: the amount should depend on service and not the total price of the meal.He explained his thinking bluntly: “If I’m at a restaurant, I might leave a small tip… But I can get, like, a $400 meal, and I’m only giving a $10 or $20 depending on the service. That’s just how I rock, for real.” He added that he occasionally increases the tip to $100—but only when the server genuinely impresses him. Otherwise, as he put it, “If you did a great job, you might get $20. If you were just okay, you’ll get $10 for showing up. ”Michael Porter Jr. Backs Ball, Calls Tipping Expectations “Excessive”NBA star Michael Porter Jr., who appeared alongside the Ball brothers during the discussion, agreed with LiAngelo’s position. Porter argued that the standard 20% guideline feels disproportionate when large checks are involved. He framed his criticism around logic rather than money: If someone spends $3,000 on a meal, should a server automatically receive $600 in tips? To Porter, that expectation doesn’t make sense.He also questioned why food delivery services - like Uber Eats - are expected to receive consistent 20% tips regardless of order size. Both athletes maintained that tips should be based primarily on effort and quality of service rather than the cost of the food being served.The Ball family isn’t aligned on the matter. Lonzo Ball countered his brother’s stance by supporting the customary 20% tipping standard, especially for good service. He emphasized that a great server can elevate a dining experience, while a poor one can diminish it. According to Lonzo, rewarding excellent hospitality upholds fairness and acknowledges the hard work that often goes unnoticed in the service industry.This disagreement among the Ball brothers mirrors wider public division. While some praised LiAngelo and Porter Jr. for challenging tipping culture, others criticized them for what they saw as unnecessary penny-pinching - especially given the athletes’ substantial earnings.LiAngelo Ball’s comments highlight longstanding tensions in American dining culture. While tipping norms typically fall between 15% and 20%, many servers earn below minimum wage and rely heavily on tips to make ends meet. Critics of Ball’s position argue that low gratuities from diners - especially affluent ones - make an already unstable livelihood even more precarious.Supporters of Ball’s perspective see tipping differently. They view gratuity as a reward for service quality rather than an automatic fee. Their stance is that check size shouldn’t dictate tip size, especially when large bills reflect group sizes or luxury items rather than increased effort from staff.LiAngelo Ball may have intended only to share his personal approach to tipping, but he inadvertently triggered a conversation that extends far beyond basketball or celebrity culture. His viewpoint taps into broader frustrations about tipping inflation, service industry wages, and shifting consumer expectations.It raises questions many diners face: Should tips always scale with the price of the meal? Does presenting a bottle of champagne justify an $80 gratuity? And should a server’s income depend so heavily on subjective customer judgment?Also read: LiAngelo Ball Makes Platinum History with Breakout Hit “Tweaker” featuring Drake In the end, while LiAngelo Ball may tip $20 on a $400 dinner, he has undeniably made a far larger contribution to the national debate on tipping—one that shows no signs of slowing down.","Liangelo ball, the middle brother of the well-known ball family, revealed that he typically leaves between $10 and $20 in tips.

Jake Paul’s “ready to die” stance fuels the buildup



Anthony Joshua’s Usyk-style training signals a serious approach



Jake Paul’s rise from viral entertainer to headline boxer has never lacked spectacle, but his latest declaration has pushed the drama to a new level. As he prepares for what may be the most improbable matchup of his career, Paul insists he’s willing to give everything for a chance at a historic upset.The 28-year-old says his commitment is absolute, even if it means stepping into territory far more dangerous than anything he’s experienced in the ring so far.The fight, set for December 19 at the Kaseya Center in Miami and streamed live on Netflix, pairs Paul with Anthony Joshua, a former unified heavyweight champion. It’s a matchup that feels surreal on paper, yet both men are leaning into the moment. Paul is selling belief. Joshua is selling dominance. And the spectacle is drawing global attention.Jake Paul didn’t hold back at the opening press event, delivering one of the most intense statements of his career. Asked if he truly believed he could beat Anthony Joshua, Paul doubled down. “100% Self-belief is the most powerful thing in the world, and it's been there since my first fight,” he said.Then he went further, offering a line that stunned even longtime boxing observers: “I want him to cut me up, I want him to break my face, but guess what, he's gonna have to kill me to stop me, and I'm ready to die.Seriously, ready to die in the ring to win this fight.”Paul framed the matchup as a potential repeat of the Andy Ruiz shocker that handed Joshua his first loss. He even tossed his new diamond ammo chain into the mix as a wager. Joshua didn’t bite on the bet, but he didn’t shy from the tone Paul set. “If I'm being honest, I'ma break his face,” Joshua said. “I'ma break his body up, I'ma stomp all over him.”The bout comes after Paul canceled his planned fight against Gervonta Davis following allegations against the lightweight star.While Paul leans on bravado, Anthony Joshua is making quieter but meaningful adjustments behind the scenes. Instead of staying in London or working with longtime trainer Ben Davison, Joshua relocated to Spain to train under members of Oleksandr Usyk’s team. The change follows his knockout loss to Daniel Dubois last year and reflects a reset in his approach.“I won't be trained by Ben Davison,” Joshua confirmed. “I was invited to train with team Usyk. I've been in Spain, we've been doing some good training. He's one of the best in the world. It's been phenomenal man. It's been a great experience and it's very challenging.”Joshua, who hasn’t fought since September 2024, is expected to earn around $50 million for this bout. Despite the size of the paycheck, he insists his mentality hasn’t softened. “I'm going to break his face, I'm going to break his body up, I'm going to stomp all over him,” he said. “That's my mentality, that's a fighter's mentality. I know what's in my heart, what's in my mind. I'm here to compete.”The face-off has only extended the hype for the upcoming fight.Also Read: Saudi boxing chief makes tense Jake Paul statement moments after Anthony Joshua fight update",Anthony joshua and jake paul will fight in miami on december 19.

Sacramento Kings veteran DeMar DeRozan opens up about team’s emotional struggles

Sacramento Kings veteran DeMar DeRozan didn't sugarcoat things after his team's recent embarrassing loss, straightforwardly stating that the squad's mentality is in a ""sh**ty place. "" The six-time All-Star's frank statements surfaced amid a challenging kickoff to the 2025-26 NBA season.The breaking point hit on Thursday, November 20, 2025, when the Kings faced a brutal 137-96 defeat against the Memphis Grizzlies in Sacramento. This marked their eighth straight loss, with three of those being by over 30 points, leaving them with a dismal 3-13 record to start the season. Even without some of their star players, the Grizzlies took control right from the start, jumping to a 15-point lead after the first quarter and stretching it to 37 by halftime. Memphis' bench came alive with significant contributions, while Sacramento's defense fell apart, giving up 42 assists and managing only 46.3 percent shooting from the field.After the game, DeRozan opened up in a chat with Sacramento Bee's Chris Biderman. When he was questioned about how the team was feeling, the 36-year-old guard was completely honest.""In a sh**ty place,"" DeRozan said to Biderman after the Grizzlies loss.He elaborated, telling Biderman, ""Don’t nobody want to lose the way we’ve been losing. I think it’s just everything right now for us is just sh**ty, honestly. Sometimes when you’re in the deep end, it’s hard to hear anything. You’re just trying to swim your way out, one way or another.""DeRozan's comments reflected the team's overall fatigue. The Kings have been losing by an average of 14.1 points each game during this rough patch, according to NBA.com advanced stats, transforming what was meant to be a dynamic offense into a chaotic situation. His reduced playing time—his lowest since coming to Sacramento—highlighted the night's hopelessness, as he sat on the bench while the gap widened beyond reach.The veteran was feeling frustrated, and it went beyond just the court. With all the trade rumors flying around him during the Kings' slump, DeRozan spoke directly to Biderman about his uncertain future: ""I’m pretty sure everything comes into question when you’re in the situation like we’re in now. That’s another thing that’s frustrating.That’s another thing. Only time will tell. We’ll see."" As he enters the last year of his three-year, $74 million contract, DeRozan has been connected to teams like the Warriors, but he’s still focused on turning the season around.Also Read: Giannis Antetokounmpo exits Milwaukee Bucks’ matchup with the Cleveland Cavaliers after intentional foul in second quarter","Sacramento kings veteran demar derozan says team is in a ""sh**ty place"" after 8th straight loss.

The affection Jahmyr Gibbs shows for Nicole Anderson mirrors the devotion Myles Garrett has for Chloe Kim



More coverage on Jahmyr Gibbs and Myles Garrett:

Picture this: Myles Garrett, the Cleveland Browns’ top-earning defensive end, making a grand entrance for Olympic Gold Medalist Chloe Kim at the 2025 Crunchyroll Anime Awards in Tokyo. Fast forward a few months, and the tables turn as the superstar snowboarder surprises Garrett at his practice, just days after his headline-grabbing 100 mph speeding incident. Their magnetic connection is mirrored in the romance between Jahmyr Gibbs and his girlfriend, Nicole Anderson, who brings together Korean and Swedish heritage.The Myles-Chloe chemistry is undeniable, especially when Garrett gazes at Kim with unwavering focus during a Tokuriki Channel interview, and the second-generation Korean-American returns the favor on their first red carpet walk, unable to take her eyes off him. This kind of love finds its echo in Detroit Lions running back Jahmyr Gibbs and fashion model Nicole Anderson. When Anderson recently posted six stunning close-ups on Instagram , Gibbs couldn’t help but comment, “Lil fine shi,” a lighthearted acknowledgement of her attractiveness. Even Christen Harper Goff, wife of quarterback Jared Goff, chimed in with an enthusiastic, “Obsessed.”This is hardly the first time the two-time Pro Bowler has showered his affection in the comments.

A look at Julie and Zach Ertz’s earnings and longtime contributions

Inside the financial growth and future plans of the power couple

Zach Ertz and Julie Ertz are one of America’s most accomplished sports couples. They are each building remarkable careers in football independently. One of them is in the NFL, and the other is in women’s soccer. By 2025, their combined net worth reflects not only years of top-notch athletic performance but also smart financial planning. Their endorsements and long-term investments are quite praiseworthy. Together, they have created a strong financial foundation that continues to grow.Julie Ertz is a two-time World Cup champion and one of the most respected players in U.S. women’s soccer. She earned millions throughout her professional career. According to sources, Julie’s reported salary stands at roughly $2.8 million per year. This is nothing but a reflection of her on-field earnings, sponsorship deals, and various off-field income sources. Earlier reports from some of the sources estimated her annual breakdown as $700,000 from on-field activities and $1.3 million from endorsements.Julie’s club career included significant time with the Chicago Red Stars before joining Angel City FC in 2023.Her 123 appearances for the U.S. Women’s National Team, World Cup victories, and Olympic performances have all contributed to her financial success. Even after announcing her retirement from international soccer in 2023, Julie remains active in philanthropic work, brand partnerships, and sports-related initiatives, ventures that continue to add to her earnings.Zach later continued his career with the Arizona Cardinals and Baltimore Ravens, earning additional salary, incentives, and signing bonuses that contributed significantly to his net worth. Beyond the field, he has invested in training centers, real estate, and charitable initiatives, particularly through the Ertz Family Foundation, which he and Julie run together.By 2025, estimates place the couple’s combined net worth at well over $30 million, though exact figures vary depending on endorsements, business investments, and career transitions. Their wealth is diversified across athlete income, brand partnerships, real estate, and charitable ventures they’ve nurtured throughout their careers.One notable aspect of their financial strategy is the balance between steady income and purpose-driven investment. Their foundation supports youth sports, education, and community development, showing that their financial success is closely tied to giving back.As of 2025, both Zach and Julie are transitioning into new chapters, Julie into retirement and media opportunities, and Zach into the later stages of his NFL career while exploring post-football ventures. Their combined financial footprint reflects not just athletic excellence but intelligent long-term planning, ensuring their legacy will extend far beyond their playing days.More NFL Coverage: Washington Commanders tight end Zach Ertz ranked shockingly low on PFF list despite strong 2024 season","Julie ertz is a two-time world cup champion and one of the most respected players in u.s. women’s soccer.

WTC Final: Steve Smith on future, facing South Africa and revised format

Poll Who do you think won the battle of words between Monty Panesar and Steve Smith? Monty Panesar Steve Smith It's a tie

The first Test of the Ashes has begun with an unexpected off-field storm, as former England spinner Monty Panesar unleashed a blistering response to Australia's stand-in captain Steve Smith , escalating what has become the most unlikely feud of the series. Smith had earlier mocked Panesar's infamous Celebrity Mastermind appearance while reacting to the former cricketer's advice that England should needle the Australian skipper by resurrecting memories of the 2018 Sandpaper Gate scandal. The Australian star told reporters to “do yourself a favour” and watch Panesar's quiz-show errors — including mixing up Athens' location and calling America a city — calling it “pretty comical”.But Panesar struck back with ferocity in a Telegraph column, claiming he had “won the battle” and branding Smith's press-conference comments as proof of “mental vulnerability” ahead of a blockbuster series opener.“To think that he wanted to talk about me before one of the biggest days of his career… is flattering and nothing short of hilarious,” Panesar wrote. “I cannot believe he has dug out the old YouTube clip of my shocker and memorised it word by word.”Panesar conceded his Mastermind performance was “terrible” and “a shocker”, but insisted it was still preferable to Smith's own missteps. “We've both made mistakes, but at least mine was on a celebrity quiz show.His was on a cricket field, and we both have to live by them. It seems right now only one of us can.”The former spinner went further, saying if he ever confronted Smith, he would question whether the 36-year-old could “look himself in the mirror yet” after Cape Town 2018. “I would ask Steve whether he can actually admit he was part of Sandpapergate — the worst example of Australian cheating in history.”Panesar suggested Smith's reaction proved England had already succeeded in getting inside his head. “I am delighted to have got so far inside his mind… imagine how much damage Ben Stokes and his side are going to be able to do once play starts in Perth?”He even offered sledging scripts for England players: “If I was Jofra Archer, I'd be telling him ‘I'm swinging the ball even without sandpaper'; if I was Joe Root: ‘Fine or coarse paper, mate? Tell us the tricks of your trade.'”With both sides gearing up for the brutal on-field contest, the Panesar–Smith saga has added an unexpected psychological subplot to an already high-voltage Ashes opener.",Former england spinner monty panesar hits back at steve smith.

India batting coach Sitanshu Kotak shares key update on Shubman Gill's fitness ahead of second Test in Guwahati

NEW DELHI: India Test captain Shubman Gill has been released from the squad ahead of the Guwahati Test and has already left for Mumbai on Friday. The youngster travelled with the side on November 19 but didn't turn up for training on November 20. It is learnt that he will be resting in Mumbai for the next two-three days before seeking specialist opinion from Dr Dinshaw Pardiwala. As of now, there is no trip planned to the BCCI Centre of Excellence (CoE) and more clarity is expected in the coming days.In Gill's absence, Pant will lead the side in the crucial second Test vs South Africa starting November 22. The team management will have to take some tough Playing XI calls and as TimesofIndia.com had reported, Sai Sudharsan and Nitish Kumar Reddy are frontrunners to be picked with Axar Patel likely to return on the bench. In the training session on eve of the match, only KL Rahul, Yashasvi Jaiswal and Sudharsan turned up as the rest took it easy.India lost the first Test at the Eden Gardens inside three days and a lot of focus has been on the playing surface since then. While Eden wasn't the ideal surface, Guwahati is expected to roll out a red soil pitch which will offer both turn and bounce. It may not be as unplayable as Eden but will keep the spinners in play.India batting coach Sitanshu Kotak spoke at length about the pitch for the opening Test and felt it wasn't something they expected.""See, in the last match wicket, Gautam said that he took all the blame on himself. He said that he took the blame because he felt that he should not put the blame on the curators,"" Kotak said. ""Now, what happened in the last match, after a day, it felt like it was crumbling. There was a little bit of soil [that came up after the ball pitched]. All of you can see that. That was not expected. Even if the spin was expected, it was after 3 days or on the third day in the evening. Sometimes, the weather, sometimes, even the curators did not want it. I am telling you the truth. No one wanted it to be like this.""",India test captain shubman gill has been released from the squad ahead of the guwahati test.

Atul Wassan criticises Congress leader Shama Mohamed for comments on Sarfaraz Khan

NEW DELHI: Sarfaraz Khan ’s continued absence from the Indian Test team has led to questions from several former players. The Mumbai batter has not played a Test since November 2024.Meanwhile, former India cricketer Aakash Chopra said Sarfaraz has been affected by a perception issue. Sarfaraz has played six Tests so far, scoring 371 runs at an average of 37.10, with three fifties and one century. His highest score in Tests is 150.""I think there is a clarity issue in the case of Sarfaraz. I think it is a case of perception and understanding. I am trying to think—they might have a perception that he may not do as well in swinging conditions or play fast bowling well. Maybe he is not our guy in SENA countries. So he did not get the chance. But even to make that perception, I have to allow him to fail. He is not even being allowed to fail. And now there is no place in the team as well,"" Chopra said on Shubhankar Mishra's YouTube channel.Chopra added, ""I think Sarfaraz should play, or else it would be unfair.""Sarfaraz has also has had a difficult Ranji Trophy season so far, scoring 178 runs in five matches with one fifty.The right-hander batter’s returns are indeed low for the lofty standards he has set in the Ranji Trophy in the seasons preceding his India Test call-up.

Poll What do you think about Usman Khawaja being barred from starting the innings? Poor decision by the management Necessary for player safety Indifferent, it happens in cricket

Australia’s opening day of the Ashes took an unexpected turn when Usman Khawaja was barred from starting the innings.The opener, who had spent an extended period off the ground with stiffness, did not meet the minimum on-field requirement to bat.Stand-in captain Steve Smith tried to bring him back shortly before England’s innings ended, but the collapse came too quickly for the 38-year-old to regain eligibility.That forced a reshuffle, with Marnus Labuschagne walking out alongside debutant Jake Weatherald.Former Australia allrounder Tom Moody criticised the confusion on Fox Cricket, calling it “poor management… Beyond a joke… like Starc led the attack, we needed Uzzie [Khawaja] to lead the batting.”Weatherald’s debut lasted only two balls, trapped lbw by Jofra Archer after a review, leaving Smith to take strike much earlier than planned. Khawaja, still unable to bat because the dismissal came too soon after his return to the field, remained in the dressing room as Australia attempted to settle after the disruption.He finally came on after the wicket of Marnus Labuschagne in the 15th over, but only managed 2 runs and lasted just an over.The day had already swung violently before the batting order drama.Mitchell Starc demolished England with a fiery 7/58, ripping through the top order inside the first hour and returning after lunch to break the middle order.Only Harry Brook (52) and Ollie Pope (46) offered resistance as England were dismissed for 172, with debutant Brendan Doggett supporting Starc with 2/27.Australia’s reply was equally turbulent. England’s quicks hit back hard, led by captain Ben Stokes, who produced a six-over burst returning 5/23. Archer and Brydon Carse added two wickets each as Australia slid to 123/9 by stumps, still trailing by 49.Smith and Labuschagne held through the early storm, but England maintained pressure throughout the evening session.With the match finely balanced, both sides head into day two with the contest wide open.","Usman khawaja was barred from coming on to open for australia and from coming in as the no. 3 batter due to a specific rule in cricket.

Why coach Gautam Gambhir can't continue with his IPL ways in Test cricket

India’s evolving approach to their batting order has once again raised eyebrows, with head coach Gautam Gambhir and the team management making another unexpected shuffle during the first Test against South Africa at Eden Gardens. In a move that surprised many, India fielded four frontline spinners and sent Washington Sundar in at number 3, a slot previously occupied by Sai Sudharsan in the West Indies series earlier this year. Before that, both Sudharsan and Karun Nair had been used at the same position during the tour of England.Former India batter Aakash Chopra voiced his concerns over the continuous reshuffling and questioned whether the team was lacking clarity in its long-term plans.“Washington Sundar has presented himself as a phenomenal option who can bat at the top of the order, and of course is a more than handy bowler. The bigger question that Gautam and the team management need to answer is are we going to keep changing goalposts after every series?” Chopra said during a JioStar media day interaction.Sudharsan, who made scores of 7, 87 and 39 against the West Indies, found himself out of the XI for the opening Test against South Africa. Sundar replaced him at number 3 and made 29 and 31 in the match.“You’re well within your rights to go with Washington, but if Washi is your long term choice, then were we just wasting time with Sai Sudharsan or even Karun Nair to bat at 3?” Chopra asked.He stressed that India’s top order must prioritise pure batting attributes above all else.“You would first want to prioritise the batting capabilities, not only the skill but also the temperament and the patience and the ability to bat time. That is why you look for the purest specialists who have only one job to do. Your top 4 or 5 are there just to bat and nothing else.”Chopra added that if Sundar is indeed being groomed primarily as a batter, the last several months of experimentation may have served little purpose.“If you choose Washington Sundar as a batter, fair enough, but it just feels like the last six or seven months were futile and you didn't really gain anything from it,” he said.He also questioned the messaging to Sudharsan, who performed reasonably well but still lost his place.“What message do you give to Sai Sudharsan that we gave you a chance, you scored the runs, but we had a change of heart. Transition gives you the chance to experiment, but what makes it easier is clarity and consistency,” Chopra concluded.",India's evolving approach to their batting order has once again raised eyebrows.

Why is the series called The Ashes?



What is inside the urn?



NEW DELHI: England and Australia are facing off in the opening Test of the 2025-26 Ashes series at the Optus Stadium in Perth, renewing one of cricket’s most iconic rivalries. The contest derives its famous name from a mock obituary printed in 1882 after Australia claimed their first Test win on English soil.For both nations, the Ashes series carries immense prestige, often regarded as being on par with the honour of winning a World Cup. Its name has a unique and storied origin rooted in cricket history.The term originated on August 29, 1882, when English journalist Reginald Shirley Brooks published a tongue-in-cheek obituary in the Sporting Times following England’s defeat at The Oval.""English cricket was dead and the body will be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia,"" Brooks wrote in the Sporting Times.England captain Ivo Bligh vowed to reclaim those “ashes” during the team’s upcoming tour of Australia later that year. England went on to win the series 2-1.After that triumph, a small urn was presented to Bligh’s team, giving rise to the tradition of calling every future Test series between England and Australia “The Ashes.”What the urn actually contains has long been debated. Some believe it holds the ashes of a bail from the third match of the 1882 series, while others speculate it might contain remnants of a burnt ball cover or stump.In 1998, Bligh’s daughter-in-law offered another theory, claiming the urn held the ashes of her mother-in-law’s burnt veil.The original urn was handed over to the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) at Lord’s after Bligh’s death in 1927, and since then, teams have competed for a replica of the treasured artifact.Today, the England–Australia rivalry remains one of cricket’s most iconic and fiercely contested battles, with both sides determined to claim the coveted urn.",England and australia face off in the opening test of the 2025-26 ashes series at the optus stadium in perth.
