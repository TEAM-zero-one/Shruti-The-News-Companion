COLOMBO: It was barely five minutes after the match was over at the Premadasa Stadium on Sunday when Hardik Pandya and Shivam Dube were back in the middle, bowling on the practice pitches. No over-the-top celebrations, no outpouring of emotions, just a sense of another routine victory against a Pakistan team that India don’t think are their match at the moment.The 61-run win, the fourth on the bounce after their hat-trick of victories against their once arch-rivals in the Asia Cup, have now ensured a Super-8 spot for India. A lot had happened in the build-up to this game and even on Sunday, the much-anticipated handshakes between the captains didn’t happen.While the unease off the pitch persisted, India were just too much when the ball rolled. Even a few months ago, Ishan Kishan (77 off 40 balls) wasn’t even close to a spot in the Indian T20 team. But now that he is there, the 27-year old is proving that he can give his teammate Abhishek Sharma a run for his money as the best T20 opener in the world.Abhishek’s early dismissal on a slow Premadasa track could have been a big blow, but not when Ishan was in the form that he is in. The Pakistan bowlers were dealt with disdain and the cuts and sweeps that the Jharkhand boy unleashed took India to 52 runs in the first six overs, which was at least 20 over par on this track.“The pitch was not that easy. Sometimes, you just have to believe and focus on your strengths. I was just watching the ball, sticking to my strengths and making them run as much as possible,” Man of the Match Kishan said at the end of the match.After his exit, India showed smartness to reach a total of 175 against some quality spin, pushing Pakistan into taking tremendous risks right at the beginning of their chase.They were not up for it with Jasprit Bumrah (2-17) and Hardik Pandya (2-16) doing the early damage. The spinners, who bowled 18 of Pakistan’s 20 overs, came into play for India only after the pacemen had all but sealed the deal.“This is for India. We played the brand of cricket we wanted to play. We thought 175 was 15-20 runs over par — 155 would have made it a very tight game,” captain Surya Kumar Yadav said, as the thousands of touring Indian fans went home a happy lot.",India beat pakistan by 61 runs to reach super-8 of asia cup.

Pakistan’s reliance on spin against India in Colombo entered the record books after they bowled 18 overs of spin in a single T20 World Cup innings, equalling the tournament record.Led by Salman Ali Agha, Pakistan sent down 18 overs of spin, matching the most spin overs delivered in a T20 World Cup innings. The only other time 18 overs of spin were bowled in an innings in a T20 World Cup match was when Pakistan used the same approach against Australia at the same venue in the 2012 edition.Other spin-heavy efforts in T20 World Cup history include Afghanistan’s 16 overs of spin against England in Delhi in 2016 and against West Indies in Nagpur in the same year. Pakistan also bowled 16 overs of spin against the USA in 2026.The 18 overs of spin against India also places the game among the most spin-dependent innings in all T20Is between full-member teams. Zimbabwe bowled 18 overs of spin against West Indies in Port of Spain in 2010. Pakistan’s 18 overs against Australia in 2012 remains another instance, while New Zealand bowled 17 overs of spin against India in Lucknow in 2023.In the match, Pakistan won the toss and chose to field. A 77 off 40 balls from Ishan Kishan, along with 32 from 29 balls by captain Suryakumar Yadav and 27 off 17 from Shivam Dube, helped India post 175 for 7 on a pitch that offered assistance to bowlers.Saim Ayub was Pakistan’s leading bowler with figures of 3 for 25 in four overs.

Axar Patel press conference: 'We see them as a team, don't see rivalry' after India beat Pakistan

NEW DELHI: India’s emphatic triumph over arch-rivals Pakistan in the ICC T20 World Cup wasn’t just another win — it was, in Sachin Tendulkar ’s words, a takeover scripted in the powerplay itself.The batting icon summed up the night’s defining phase in a post on X. “The powerplay was where India took the game away from them. Ishan Kishan in the first innings, and the clinical bowling we saw in the second innings, made all the difference. We were always in the driver's seat. India rocked it tonight,” he wrote.That early surge came despite a shaky start. After Abhishek Sharma fell for a duck, Kishan unleashed a counterattack, smashing a brutal 77, off just 40 balls, that shifted momentum instantly. Tilak Varma added a steady 25, before skipper Suryakumar Yadav (32), along with Shivam Dube (27) and Rinku Singh (11 not out), delivered a composed finish to lift India to 175/7. Saim Ayub (3/25) was Pakistan’s standout bowler with three wickets.If Kishan seized the initiative, India’s bowlers sealed the verdict. Hardik Pandya , Jasprit Bumrah and Axar Patel tore through the top order, reducing Pakistan to 34/4 inside powerplay.Usman Khan fought alone with 44, but Varun Chakaravarthy and the rest ensured Pakistan were bundled out for 114 in 18 overs.Former opener Virender Sehwag didn’t hold back either. “Ishan Kishan played like a real Dhurandhar. Among all minnows Pakistan looked like the easiest to beat for Bharat because of their 17th century approach to T-20 cricket, and they have taken a proper beating as usual. Full kambal kuttai,” he posted.The crushing win pushed India to a dominant 8-1 head-to-head record in tournament history and secured their Super 8 spot with three straight victories.","Sachin tendulkar says india took the game away from pakistan in the powerplay.

TimesofIndia.com in Colombo:

T20 World Cup: India humiliate Pakistan again

On a surface where timing was a luxury and survival itself felt like an act of resistance, Ishan Kishan produced one of the most belligerent innings of the ongoing T20 World Cup.Against Pakistan, on a R Premadasa Stadium pitch that gripped, turned and repeatedly forced batters to check their strokes, Kishan played an innings that lifted India to 175 for 7.The left-hander scored a stroke-filled 77 off 40 balls, while the rest of the Indian batters managed only 98 runs off 80 deliveries.From the very start, the signs were unmistakable. When Shaheen Afridi dug one in short, Kishan swivelled and sent it soaring into the stands. It was not reckless bravado. It was intent. With purchase for the spinners, Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha opened the bowling himself and got rid of Abhishek Sharma, the batter everyone was talking about before the match.What transpired was a four-ball duck for Abhishek, who is yet to open his account in the T20 World Cup. Salman's decision to open the bowling turned out to be a masterstroke. After three dot balls, Abhishek decided to go for a hoick, but the delivery was not there to pull and he miscued it to mid-on, where Shaheen completed an easy catch.Kishan understood early that Pakistan wanted the surface to do the damage. His answer was to stay ahead of it.Spin arrived quickly, and with it came the real examination. The off-spin of Salman Ali Agha and Saim Ayub found turn straightaway, with the ball holding up and deviating sharply off a length. Kishan responded not by retreating into defence, but by expanding his options. Sweeps, slog-sweeps, reverse hits and inside-out strokes flowed in succession, forcing Pakistan’s fielders into constant recalibration.The fifty came off just 27 balls, pumped straight back over the bowler’s head, and it told a story larger than numbers. This was Kishan batting with clarity, reading lengths early and trusting his hands even when his feet were not always planted. At one point, a possible cramp on right leg did little to slow him down. If anything, it sharpened his resolve.Against Abrar Ahmed’s googlies, Kishan showed rare adaptability. When the length was full, he went straight. When it was short, he rocked back and pierced the gaps. Even mistimed strokes fell safe, a testament to how deep Pakistan were forced to set their field. The message was clear. Defensive lines would not work.The most brutal phase came against Shadab Khan. A floated delivery on middle disappeared into the crowd via a ferocious slog-sweep. Another drifted down leg and was punished behind square. Pakistan’s plan of strangling India in the middle overs was being dismantled ball by ball.What made the innings stand out was not just the strokeplay, but the context. This was not a flat track designed for excess. The pitch demanded patience, yet Kishan refused to be trapped by it. He understood that in a high-pressure India-Pakistan contest, momentum matters as much as runs. Every boundary dented belief, every six silenced Pakistani fans in the stands.His dismissal, fittingly, came through craft rather than force. Saim Ayub slowed it down, drew Kishan across the crease and let the surface do the rest. The ball gripped, turned and clipped the top of middle and leg. Pakistan celebrated with visible relief.But, by then, the damage was done.Kishan walked back to a standing ovation, his 77 off 40 balls having completely altered the trajectory of the innings. On a pitch where run accumulation felt like wading through sand, he had sprinted. In a match where margins are thin and conditions often dictate terms, this was an innings that stood apart. It was fearless without being reckless, aggressive without being careless. More than anything, it was a reminder that in the biggest games, the bravest batters do not wait for conditions to improve. They bend them to their will.","Ishan kishan produced one of the most belligerent innings of the ongoing t20 world cup.

India vs Pakistan prediction: Greenstone Lobo reveals the winner

There was no handshake after the match between India and Pakistan at the T20 World Cup clash in Colombo, continuing the icy stand-off that began during the Asia Cup last September.“I will break the suspense tomorrow. Wait for 24 hours,” Suryakumar Yadav had said on the eve of the match. Twenty four hours later, the message was clear and unambiguous. There would be no handshakes.The frost between the two sides remained evident not only at the toss but also after the game. Just as in their meetings during the Asia Cup in Dubai last year, the players did not exchange handshakes once the contest ended on Sunday.On the field, India produced a commanding performance. Opener Ishan Kishan ’s supersonic 77 off 40 balls powered India to 175 for seven after being asked to bat first on a tacky surface. He shared an 87 run stand with Tilak Varma, whose contribution was 11, as Kishan dominated the Pakistan attack.The match began on an unusual note with Pakistan skipper Salman Ali Agha bringing himself on for off spin in the first over and dismissing Abhishek Sharma, who holed out to Shaheen Shah Afridi. Saim Ayub, who finished with 3 for 25, and Agha kept the pressure on during the power play.Kishan, however, turned the tide. He pulled Afridi for a towering six and then dismantled the spinners.Abrar Ahmed and Shadab Khan were struck for boundaries and sixes as Kishan raced to a 27 ball fifty. He eventually fell trying to carve Ayub over mid wicket, missing the ball and losing his stumps.Pakistan clawed back through Ayub, who removed Tilak Varma and Hardik Pandya off successive deliveries to leave India at 126 for four. Suryakumar Yadav made 32 off 28 balls, while Shivam Dube added 27 off 17. A 15 run final over from Afridi, in which Dube and Rinku Singh attacked, carried India to 175 for seven.In reply, India’s bowlers never allowed Pakistan to settle. Hardik Pandya struck in the opening over to dismiss Sahibzada Farhan for a duck. Jasprit Bumrah followed with a double strike, removing Saim Ayub and Salman Agha as Pakistan slumped to 13 for three.Axar Patel bowled Babar Azam and later dismissed Usman Khan, who top scored with 44 off 34 balls. A brief 39 run partnership between Usman and Shadab Khan offered resistance before another collapse set in.Varun Chakravarthy claimed two wickets in the 16th over, and Hardik returned to take the final wicket as Pakistan were bowled out for 114 in the 18th over. Hardik, Bumrah, Axar and Varun took two wickets each, while Kuldeep Yadav and Tilak Varma picked up one apiece.",There was no handshake after the match between india and pakistan at the t20 world cup clash in colombo.

Saif, a fourth-division cricketer from Bengaluru, booked his flight, hotel and match tickets two months in advance. He even landed in the Sri Lankan capital three days before the match.“Pakistan is no match for India. Inshallah, we will beat them,” a jubilant Saif tells TimesofIndia.com on Sunday.Saif is among the 18,000 Indian fans who have travelled from India to watch the highly anticipated India-Pakistan match.Also See: IND vs PAK Live Score, T20 World Cup 2026 Then there is Mohammad Infaz, a tuk tuk driver in Colombo who speaks fluent Hindi and echoes sentiments similar to Saif’s.“India are too strong. I think it will be a one-sided affair. Itna khatarnaak Indian team kabhi nahi dekha (This is the strongest Indian team I have seen). In T20s, on a given day anything can happen, but I have a feeling India will win,” he says while driving this reporter to the R Premadasa Stadium.Meanwhile, Muhammad Usama, who has travelled from Lahore and is among the 12,000 Pakistani fans, carries a glimmer of hope.“We have never done well against India in World Cups. But this time, I feel we have an upper edge because we know the conditions better,” says Usama.The toss will take place at 6:30 PM local time and IST, but fans from both countries began lining up as early as 1 PM. All stadium gates will open to the public at 3:00 PM. A Sri Lanka Cricket official confirmed to TimesofIndia.com that all tickets have been sold out.Approximately 2,000 police officers and nearly 600 military personnel have been deployed to maintain security and regulate traffic for the match.Sri Lanka Mirror, a local daily, has reported that India’s RAW intelligence agency, Indian security personnel, as well as private security officers assigned to the players, have arrived in Colombo to provide security for Indian players and spectators. It is also learnt that Pakistan’s security and intelligence agencies have reached Colombo to coordinate and assist with the security arrangements.Prasanna, who runs an Airbnb on Havelock Road, complains about not getting a match ticket for his die-hard Hardik Pandya fan.“No tickets for the locals,” he laughs. “We are only here to provide hospitality to our Indian and Pakistani friends.”Ryan de Silva, an ardent Mumbai Indians fan who also drives a tuk tuk, says he too wanted to see Suryakumar Yadav, Hardik Pandya and Jasprit Bumrah in action.“I have been trying to get a ticket to see my Mumbai boys in action for a month, but I didn’t get lucky,” says de Silva, a Lasith Malinga fan.After so much build-up, the stage is set for the battle between two bitter rivals, and both captains admitted in their pre-match press conferences that this is far more than just a game.“If you play any game, there is always pressure. When you play India-Pakistan, it is more about the occasion. No matter how much you say it is just another game, at the back of your mind you know which game you are playing,” Suryakumar Yadav said.Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha echoed similar views. “This game between India and Pakistan has always been a high-magnitude match and will continue to remain so in the future.”Former England captain Michael Atherton, in his column for The Times, described the India-Pakistan contest as a “toxic and politicised spectacle.”Atherton argued that the fixture has become too big to fail, underpinning the fragile global cricket economy, even as it serves as a proxy for political point-scoring.Yet, his view comes with privilege. Ask the vendors outside the R Premadasa Stadium selling flags, the cafe owners, or the tuk tuk drivers who have waited for this match since the schedule was announced.“Today I will earn more than ten times what I make in a month,” says a 55-year-old vendor selling jerseys outside the stadium.The India-Pakistan game will always matter.

Abhishek Sharma is back and India to unravel a mystery slinger

NEW DELHI: Former India cricketer Harbhajan Singh has come out in support of young Indian batter Abhishek Sharma after former Pakistan pacer Mohammad Amir called him a “slogger” ahead of the big India vs Pakistan match in the T20 World Cup 2026.Harbhajan strongly disagreed with Amir’s comment and said Abhishek is a proper and skilled batsman, not someone who just blindly hits the ball.Amir had earlier made the remark while speaking on a Pakistani TV show, which sparked debate ahead of the high-voltage clash.Also See: IND vs PAK Live Score T20 World Cup 2026 Reacting to it, Harbhajan praised Abhishek’s batting ability and consistency. He said, ""Abhishek Sharma is a quality player, and he is a player who is determined to win matches on his own. And not once, but he can do it again and again. I have played cricket, and I know that he is a proper batter who has all the shots; a lot of batsmen don't have all the shots. A slogger is someone who only sees the ball and slogs; if it connects, great, and if it doesn't, that's fine too. He is not like that. He hits the first ball. And as long as he is on the crease, he keeps hitting. So, he is a proper batsman.""Harbhajan also said it is unfair for critics who have never bowled to Abhishek to judge him.He added, ""People may say whatever they want. Because, in my opinion, I don't think they have ever bowled in front of such a batter, and hence, it is wrong to comment that Abhishek is a slogger.""He urged Abhishek to prove his talent on the field, saying, ""If I tell you the definition of a slogger, then a lot of people will get angry. So, I don't want to say that. Because we don't operate on that level, that they say something and we react again and again. I don't want to do that. Because maybe he wants us to react.""But, anyway, I'll say, Abhishek, show us tomorrow what you showed us before. And show us, what Abhishek can do. And I have a lot of hope from Abhishek.

NEW DELHI: Defending champions India sent a strong message to the cricketing world with a 61-run demolition of Pakistan in their high-stakes Group A clash at the R. Premadasa Stadium in Colombo on Sunday, securing their spot in the Super Eights.“I think this is for India,” said captain Suryakumar Yadav after India's big win.“We played the same brand of cricket we wanted to play. Batting first was the better option on this wicket. Ishan thought something out of the box. After 0/1, someone had to take responsibility and the way he took it was amazing.”The defining moment came at the top as Ishan Kishan unleashed a breathtaking 77 off 40 balls, including 10 fours and three sixes, to put India firmly in control. Tilak Varma (25) and Suryakumar Yadav (32) added crucial support, ensuring India reached 175/7 despite a challenging surface. Shivam Dube’s quickfire 27 in the death overs pushed the total to a competitive 176.Pakistan’s reply never gained momentum. Hardik Pandya struck in the first over, dismissing Sahibzada Farhan for a four-ball duck. Jasprit Bumrah then tore through the top order, sending Saim Ayub and captain Salman Agha back to the pavilion inside two overs. Usman Khan offered resistance with a fluent 44, stitching minor partnerships with Babar Azam and Shadab Khan, but his stumping to Axar Patel ended any faint hopes of a comeback.The Indian bowlers were ruthless in unison. Kuldeep Yadav trapped Mohammad Nawaz, Tilak Varma removed Shadab Khan, and Varun Chakaravarthy added two late wickets. Pandya, after seeing a couple of catches go down off his bowling, ensured the finale by knocking back Usman Tariq’s middle stump. Pakistan’s innings folded for 114 in just 18 overs, their third-lowest T20 World Cup total.“It was great to see everyone contributing with the ball,” Surya said.“We’ll go back, have a good time together as a team and then think about the other games when we take the flight to Ahmedabad,” he said.","Defending champions india beat pakistan by 61 runs in their t20 world cup group a clash.

NEW DELHI: India’s commanding 61-run demolition of Pakistan in the T20 World Cup in Colombo was as much about mindset as it was about skill, and vice-captain Axar Patel made that clear with a statement that reflected the team’s ruthless clarity. Despite the historic rivalry and hype, Axar insisted India approached the contest with calm detachment and focus.“See, we are seeing them as a team. So we are not thinking about these rivalry or whatever. So we are playing against one team, and we are just focusing on cricket,” Axar said after the win. He added, “I treat it as one match against an opponent. So I'm not thinking about any rivalry or whatever.”The result extended India’s World Cup dominance over Pakistan to 8-1 and sealed their Super 8 qualification with a third successive win.The foundation was laid by a sensational 77 off 40 balls from Ishan Kishan on a difficult surface. Axar was full of praise, saying, “The way he batted was sensational. It is one of the great knocks as it wasn't easy. The ball was spinning and some were going straight under the lights. It was a challenge.”He added that Kishan’s form and confidence made the difference, noting, “There's a lot of confidence and obviously he has got skill too. He has not hit all his shots in one place as he can score all around the ground.”India posted 175/7 after contributions from captain Suryakumar Yadav , Shivam Dube and Rinku Singh. Axar explained that India’s selection of three spinners was a calculated move. “We feel that selection should be according to the pitch. And when you get help from the pitch, you will go for it… we made the team combination according to that,” he said.The bowlers then dismantled Pakistan for 114, with Axar, Hardik Pandya, Jasprit Bumrah and Varun Chakaravarthy sharing the wickets, while Usman Khan’s 44 was the lone resistance.Axar said the team’s success came from trusting their own process rather than external comparisons. “Whatever captain says we are focusing on our strength… We are just thinking about our plan and our execution,” he said. “We are taking one match at a time… today was the Pakistan team, so we are focusing on them.”",India beat pakistan by 61 runs in the t20 world cup in colombo.

NEW DELHI: India’s dominant 61-run victory over Pakistan in their high-voltage T20 World Cup clash in Colombo not only secured a place in the Super Eights but also produced a fiery on-field moment involving Hardik Pandya and Kuldeep Yadav that quickly went viral on social media.The incident occurred during the 18th over of Pakistan’s chase, when Hardik Pandya was bowling to Shaheen Afridi. Afridi pulled a short delivery towards long-on, where Kuldeep Yadav was stationed near the boundary.Despite getting both hands to the ball, Kuldeep failed to complete the catch, instead allowing it to go for a six. Moments earlier, Ishan Kishan had also dropped a chance behind the stumps off the same batter.Visibly furious, Pandya pointed towards both fielders and shouted at them, using a couple of expletives in frustration. The animated reaction displayed the intensity of the India-Pakistan rivalry and the pressure of a World Cup match, even though India were firmly in control of the game.However, Pandya quickly backed up his aggression with performance.He kept his composure and won the match for India in the same over, bowling Usman Tariq with a full delivery that crashed into the middle stump. Pandya finished with figures of 3 overs, 16 runs, and 2 wickets, playing a key role in wrapping up Pakistan’s innings for just 114 in 18 overs.Earlier, India had posted a competitive total of 175/7, largely thanks to Ishan Kishan’s superb 77 after an early wicket. Suryakumar Yadav and Shivam Dube added valuable runs to push the total beyond Pakistan’s reach on a pitch that was expected to assist spinners.Pakistan’s chase collapsed early as Jasprit Bumrah struck twice in the powerplay, reducing them to 13/3. Usman Khan’s 44 was the only notable contribution, but the rest of the batting lineup failed to handle India’s pace and spin attack.",India beat pakistan by 61 runs in their t20 world cup clash in colombo.

Afghanistan vs UAE

England vs Italy

Australia vs Sri Lanka

Three crucial group stage matches are set to be played on February 16 in the ICC T20 World Cup 2026, with qualification scenarios beginning to tighten across groups.The day begins with a Group D clash between Afghanistan and the United Arab Emirates. Afghanistan are still searching for their first win of the tournament after suffering defeats to New Zealand and South Africa. Their loss to South Africa was particularly heartbreaking as the contest was decided after two Super Overs, leaving them fourth in the standings.Afghanistan have shown glimpses of resilience but have struggled to convert strong phases into victories. They were outplayed by New Zealand in their opener, yet pushed South Africa to the limit in a dramatic encounter. Sharper decision making in key moments will be essential if they are to keep their Super 8 hopes alive.The UAE have experienced contrasting fortunes. After a heavy 10 wicket defeat to New Zealand, they bounced back strongly to edge past Canada in a tight contest. That win has given them renewed confidence and a valuable foothold in the group heading into this important fixture.The second match features England taking on Italy in Group C.England moved up to second in the standings after a vital win over Scotland. Their campaign has been uneven so far. They were stretched by Nepal, beaten by West Indies, and then recovered with a composed chase against Scotland. While the win steadied their progress, concerns remain over their top order consistency.Italy, meanwhile, are gaining belief. After a heavy defeat in their opening game, they responded with an impressive victory over Nepal to register their first World Cup win. Their discipline with the ball and confidence at the top of the order stood out. Facing England presents a far sterner test, but Italy will look to build on their momentum and challenge an established side.The final and most significant contest of the day sees Australia face Sri Lanka in a match that could shape Australia’s tournament fate. A defeat would not mathematically eliminate Australia, but it would leave them needing an extraordinary turnaround in their final game. For Sri Lanka, victory would secure qualification for the Super Eights.Australia’s recent loss to Zimbabwe has intensified scrutiny. Questions have been raised about both their batting depth and bowling strike power, particularly after managing only two wickets in that defeat. The injury to Mitchell Marsh has further complicated their campaign, especially with some players short of form and match practice.Sri Lanka enter the clash with momentum. They defeated Ireland and Oman convincingly, with Kusal Mendis , Pavan Rathnayake and captain Dasun Shanaka producing half centuries. Kamindu Mendis also impressed earlier in the tournament. With a confident batting unit and growing rhythm, Sri Lanka have the tools to test an Australia side under pressure.",Afghanistan take on the united arab emirates in group d. england take on italy in group c. australia take on sri lanka in the final game of the tournament.

Why did Joe Rogan quit fighting?



Joe Rogan Experience #2453 - Evan Hafer

Joe Rogan recalls an incident that propelled him to end his fighting career



In combat sports, Joe Rogan is known as the voice behind the action. Long before he became a fixture on Ultimate Fighting Championship broadcasts, he chased a very different dream. As a teenager, he immersed himself in taekwondo and later moved into kickboxing and Muay Thai. By his early twenties, he had built a strong competitive résumé. He could have pursued fighting at a higher level. Instead, he stepped away at 22 and shifted his motivation toward standup comedy. It was a decision propelled by health concerns.Rogan did not drift out of the sport. During a recent episode of The Joe Rogan Experience, he laid out the reasons, saying that brain trauma was serious. Also, there was a limited financial opportunity. Then he suffered a serious knee injury.Joe Rogan has said he walked away from fighting at 22, around the same time he began exploring standup comedy at 21.He has explained that a series of moments pushed him away from competition. Primarily, it was seeing the effects of brain damage. He noticed it in other fighters and even in friends. After hard sparring sessions, he would lie in bed with headaches and ask himself, “Where does this lead?” especially since he was not earning real money from fighting at the time.“I started doing boxing and kickboxing and I saw so much brain damage. I saw so much unreported brain damage. Just weird stuff. Guys would tell you the same story they just told you five minutes ago. They just tell it to you again,” Rogan explained.He added, “I realized oh these guys can’t remember that they just said this thing five minutes ago. It was like they were stoned and they weren’t. They were just starting to exhibit the beginning signs of brain damage.”At the time, there was no major promotion offering life changing paydays. “There was essentially no way to have a career other than teaching,” Rogan said. “And so when I started to get into stand up comedy, I realized, ‘Oh wow, I could make a living doing this.’ Like there’s actually a real path.He went on to add, “While everyone I know in fighting is broke or they’re slurring their words. Guys from the gym would be in gym wars; they don’t know where they parked their car.”One tournament in California was hard hitting for him. “There was a guy that I hurt really bad in a tournament,” Rogan explained.“I knocked this one guy out when I was 19 in California, I was competing in the nationals. I [knocked out] this guy and he never got up. They had to take him on a stretcher and he was on a stretcher for half an hour and they took him to the hospital and it freaked me out. Because I was like that could have easily been me. It easily could have been me. That one bothered me because it’s like what am I doing? Like why am I doing this?”Later, the thought of “waking up in the hospital” lingered on his mind. Soon after, he tore his ACL. “I tore my ACL and when I tore my ACL, I had to have surgery and I couldn’t do anything for like six months,” Rogan said. “Then I realized my body’s vulnerable. You’re counting on your tissue staying in tact in order to live this life that you want to live.”He continued, “So I had to get my knee reconstructed. I was 22 I think when I blew it out. 21, somewhere around there. It was right around when I was thinking about stopping competing.Later, “comedy became a thing,” and it was very exciting for him. He left the competition behind. He stayed in the fight world as an analyst and black belt.","Joe rogan has said he walked away from fighting at 22, around the same time he began exploring standup comedy.

Team USA just had a brilliant opening campaign at the 2026 Winter Olympics, as the team defeated Team Latvia. The United States opened its chase for the gold medal by scoring 5-1 at Milano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena on Thursday (12 February).

According to TSN, Auston Matthews has scored more goals than any other player since he entered the NHL. But the goal he scored on Thursday night felt very different.The team initially faced certain hiccups in their opening match, with two apparent goals overturned in the first period after successful challenges by the Latvian bench. Despite the scoreboard remaining tied 1-1 after 20 minutes, Team USA maintained its focus and turned the tables with a dominant second period.Team USA captain Auston Matthews ’ timely score helped Team USA register its first win over Latvia at the opening match of the Winter Olympic Games of men’s ice hockey.Matthews scored the final goal in Team USA’s 5-1 win over Latvia, despite having a tough start with two goals not counting and a quick 1-1 tie, but the team managed to come back strong.Sharing his thoughts on their opening win, Team USA captain told TSN, “It’s pretty cool. This is such a special opportunity, and still feels pretty surreal to be here and be able to compete and put on this jersey and play with this group of guys. It’s a great start for us in this tournament, and we’ll look to build off it.”Matthews further spoke about the early adversities the team faced at the initial stage, “It’s fine. Those things happen all the time. You know, can’t really complain about it. The ref maybe didn’t see it. Was a little shaken up, but felt fine and just kept playing and just go from there,” he said.As per reports, Brady Tkachuk scored first at 5:29 in the first period with help from his brother Matthew. In the second period, Team USA took control as the team got three goals from Brock Nelson and Tage Thompson. Besides, Jack Hughes also had two assists on Nelson's goals, and Quinn Hughes, Matthew Tkachuk, and Jack Eichel had two assists too.Even coach Mike Sullivan appreciated the effort of the team for staying calm and following the correct game strategy.

Chris Paul’s rise from rookie of the year to perennial All-Star

Chris Paul's retirement marks the end of a historic statistical legacy

Chris Paul, one of the best and most respected point guards in NBA history, has officially called it quits after 21 seasons in the NBA. Confirming the end of his storied career, the 40-year-old made the announcement in an emotional statement. Paul embodied elite leadership, precise playmaking, and fierce competitiveness over the next two-plus decades, cementing a legacy as one of the greatest floor generals in the history of the sport.Paul has been a consistent Hall of Fame-level talent since back when he was a teenage legend. The retirement closes the book on a career that spanned three eras of the NBA and signals the end of one of the most impactful careers the league has seen.Chris Paul was the fourth overall pick in the 2005 NBA Draft, selected by the then-New Orleans Hornets; he quickly became a franchise player. Winning the NBA Rookie of the Year award in 2006, he was soon distinguished by his nearly unparalleled awareness on the court, his ball handling, and his defensive acumen.During his career, Paul was named to 12 NBA All-Star selections, received 11 All-NBA honors, and nine consecutive All-Defensive Team nods.His leadership made several franchises better, and most famously, he led the Los Angeles Clippers to heights they had never reached before, guiding the “Lob City” era and making the team a regular playoff team.Aside from his stint with the Clippers, Paul played a pivotal role for the Houston Rockets, Oklahoma City Thunder, Phoenix Suns, Golden State Warriors, and San Antonio Spurs. He took the Suns to the 2021 NBA Finals, two wins short of clinching the elusive title that eluded him during his Phoenix playing days.Chris Paul's retirement was swift, but it ended a career filled with records and consistent greatness. He's 2nd all-time assists and steals 2nd respectively, arguing his position as the greatest playmaker and best perimeter defender of all-time. Reinforcing his blend of scoring and distribution, Paul has scored more than 20,000 points while recording over 10,000 assists.Paul should have a room full of those fine letters, but no NBA title ever be displayed, crowning his résumé. He was president of the National Basketball Players Association, a trusty mentor to younger stars, and an embodiment of professionalism and basketball smarts.","Chris paul has announced his retirement after 21 seasons in the nba.

Team Canada will play without two key players as they are all set to lock horns against Team Switzerland in their upcoming men's ice hockey action at the 2026 Winter Olympics, scheduled for Friday. The news has been confirmed recently by the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) ahead of their clash against the opponent team.The decision came as Josh Morrissey sustained an undisclosed injury recently during Canada’s opening match against Czechia. While Brad Marchand’s reason for exclusion is unknown at this time. The 37-year-old had one assist in 9:29 of play in Canada’s bottom-six in his first Olympic appearance, according to reports.Earlier, Canada kicked off its Olympic campaign in Group A with a 5-0 win over Czechia, where 19-year-old Macklin Celebrini opened the score for the team on 12 February, as reported by Olympics.com. Meanwhile, Czechia also gave a tough fight to the mighty Canadians. Team Canada will play on February 13, 2026, without two key players due to injury and other unfortunate circumstances. These key players are Brad Marchand and Josh Morrissey, who are considered the marquee players of the team.Their absence from today’s lineup was confirmed by IIHF. However, Team Canada will replace these players with two other significant players.According to Daily Faceoff, Josh Morrissey will miss the match, as he was last seen leaving Canada’s tournament opener on Thursday against Czechia after sustaining an injury. At present, the status of Morrissey’s injury is unclear, but if he is unable to return, his roster spot will be difficult to replace after Canada officially registered 25 players on February 10.Announcing the same on X/Twitter, Steven Ellis stated, “Both Brad Marchand and Josh Morrissey are listed as scratches for Canada today against Switzerland. Jordan Binnington also went dress. #Olympics.” Meanwhile, according to Kyle Bukauskas, ""Brad Marchand is taking a rest, too."" It is expected that Marchand will be back, but for now, he can recharge and get ready for the upcoming important matches.As per reports, in place of these players, Carolina’s Seth Jarvis will make his Olympic debut. He will play alongside Bo Horvat and Sam Reinhart on Canada’s third line. The other three forward lines will remain untouched, with Sam Bennett serving as the 13th forward. In addition, this defenseman, Travis Sanheim, will take Morrissey’s place as the seventh defenseman for the match.It will be interesting to see what Team Canada will display with their strong and talented team against Switzerland at the Milano Santagiulia Arena, with both teams looking to secure positioning in the Olympic preliminary round.","Seth jarvis to make olympic debut as brad marchand and josh morrissey to remain absent.
