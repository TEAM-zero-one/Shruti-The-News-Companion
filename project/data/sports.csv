Country’s first blind Army officer in active service shoots to national award,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/countrys-first-blind-army-officer-in-active-service-shoots-to-national-award/articleshow/125755670.cms,"President Droupadi Murmu presents Lt Col C Dwarakesh with the National Award for Persons with Disabilities on Wednesday





PUNE: A basketball match at a military station in 2014 was one of the last things Lt Col C Dwarakesh saw before an accident left him blind. He would spend the next eight months in hospital, healing and adjusting to life without eyesight while his mind envisioned new possibilities.On Wednesday, President Droupadi Murmu presented the 36-year-old with the National Award for Persons with Disabilities, recognising an Army career that even disability couldn’t cut short, and one that now includes a world record in para shooting.Lt Col Dwarakesh is the first officer of the Indian armed forces to continue in active service despite total blindness. It’s an achievement made possible by the derring-do of a young officer who never gave up on himself despite no precedent.“As an Army officer, I was trained to have conviction, courage, willpower and tenacity. But blindness is an impediment I couldn’t have prepared for,” Lt Col Dwarakesh told TOI from Delhi. “I overcame this hurdle through academics and technology, clearing multiple competitive exams along the way. I now research para sports, especially for people living with blindness. I converted my disability into a power and found ways to express the way those with vision do.This mindset has helped me reach new heights.”Supported by AI tools and assistive technology, Dwarakesh performs his responsibilities with the same proficiency and precision as his colleagues. In paralympic sports, he is a national champion in swimming and shooting, ranked world No. 3 in the 10m air rifle event. His most recent achievement was a world record score of 624.6 at the Shooting World Cup in the UAE this Oct. As part of the Indian para shooting team, he trains at Army Marksmanship Unit in Mahou.Dwarakesh, who joined the Army in 2009, terms the national award a “full-circle moment”. “I remember being granted commission by the President,” he said. “And to be receiving an award from the President 16 years later for something that redefined me, that’s quite something.”The officer, a native of TN, has also qualified for the UGC NET, making him one of the few visually impaired academicians in management, human resources, labour law, and sports research.","Lt col c dwarakesh is the first officer of the indian armed forces to continue in active service despite total blindness.

"Guns to games: Surrendered Naxals back on the field, this time for Bastar Olympics",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/guns-to-games-surrendered-naxals-back-on-the-field-this-time-for-bastar-olympics/articleshow/125755441.cms,"RAIPUR: For years, Kamla, a former Maoist from Bastar in Chhattisgarh’s Narayanpur district, ran through forests with a gun on her shoulder. This winter, Kamla is running again – but with a rope in her hand, digging her heels in the red soil as she practises the tug-of-war. Kamla, who laid down arms recently, will participate in the final round of Bastar Olympics, scheduled for later this month. “I surrendered this year. Now, every pull on this rope feels like I am pulling my life onto the other side,” she said.Podiyam Bhima, also known as Lokesh, was with the Maoist movement until early this year. He had heard that many of the surrendered Maoists were participating in the Bastar Olympics. “I used to think that one day when I surrender, I would take part too. Bastar Olympics was one of the big attractions for me in deciding to lay down arms,” Bhima said.Today he is training for the archery event. This is the second year of Bastar Olympics, having over three lakh registered participants ranging from block to district and divisional level across the seven districts of Bastar.Union home minister Amit Shah, who had attended last year’s event, will participate on the final day this year on Dec 13, coming close on the heels of his ministry’s call to end Maoist extremism in India by March 31, 2026.At a recent event in New Delhi, PM Narendra Modi cited the Bastar Olympics as a marker of change. He recalled a time when even journalists needed multiple permissions to enter Bastar. “Last year, about 300 surrendered cadres took part. This time, more than 500 rehabilitated ex-Maoists and over 600 participants under the Nuva Baat identity are in the fray, alongside Naxal-affected players with disabilities,” Chhattisgarh deputy CM Arun Sao said.Over 10,000 block-level winners have moved up to district events, and 3,000-3,500 athletes will now compete at the divisional and final stage in Jagdalpur from Dec 11 to 13. Players from all seven districts — Bastar, Kanker, Kondagaon, Bijapur, Dantewada, Sukma and Narayanpur — are competing in 11 disciplines: athletics, archery, kabaddi, kho-kho, football, hockey, badminton, volleyball, karate, weightlifting and tug-of-war.","This is the second year of bastar olympics, having over three lakh registered participants.

Still have doubts? Virat Kohli blows World Cup trumpet with another masterclass

NEW DELHI: Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma appeared unfazed by the growing chatter around their futures, focusing instead on a demanding net session under the floodlights ahead of India’s second ODI against South Africa on Wednesday.Speculation has intensified over what lies ahead for the senior duo, especially with the road to the ICC ODI World Cup 2027 now part of the discussion.But fresh off back-to-back match-winning performances against Australia and South Africa, neither Kohli nor Rohit showed any signs of easing up during training on Tuesday.Kohli looked sharp and assertive, taking on throw-down experts Raghu (right-arm) and Nuwan Seneviratne (left-arm), who pushed the pace throughout the session. The battle was compelling to watch — Kohli found the middle of the bat repeatedly, though there were moments when Raghu’s extra pace beat him.Head coach Gautam Gambhir stood positioned between the two nets, observing the session closely.When Kohli wrapped up his batting, he rested both bats on his shoulders and walked past Gambhir without exchanging a word — a moment that would not go unnoticed considering the recent narrative surrounding Indian cricket.Rohit, who followed Kohli into the nets and then toward the dressing room shortly after, did pause briefly for a conversation with Gambhir before heading inside.While all eyes naturally gravitated toward the two senior players, training intensity remained high across the nets as India look to clinch the series after taking a 1-0 lead with Sunday's win in Ranchi.With the match to be played on a black-soil surface at the Shaheed Veer Narayan Singh Stadium, the batting group trained with intent, showcasing aggression from the outset.Yashasvi Jaiswal sent multiple deliveries soaring over the leg side boundary, and even rolled his arm over to bowl to Rishabh Pant — the last batter to take his turn in the nets.The second ODI is scheduled for Wednesday, 3 October. India will be hoping to win and seal the three-match series after taking the opening game. The team is also likely to continue with the same combination.","Virat kohli and rohit sharma trained ahead of india's second odi against south africa on wednesday.

Joe Burrow’s viral reaction after Lane Kiffin leaves Ole Miss for LSU becomes the story everyone is talking about,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/joe-burrows-viral-reaction-after-lane-kiffin-leaves-ole-miss-for-lsu-becomes-the-story-everyone-is-talking-about/articleshow/125755987.cms,"Joe Burrow breaks silence on Lane Kiffin joining LSU (Via X)

Joe Burrow reacts to Lane Kiffin hire



LSU’s decision to hire Lane Kiffin has stirred a wave of reactions across the college football world, but few were more talked about than what came from Joe Burrow . The Cincinnati Bengals quarterback still carries the glow of LSU’s 2019 title run. His history with the school keeps fans looking toward him whenever big changes happen in Baton Rouge. This time was no different. When asked about the Tigers bringing in Kiffin, Burrow kept his response short, and it added a layer of intrigue to an already dramatic coaching move.Kiffin arrives at LSU with a strong record, leaving behind an Ole Miss team positioned for a playoff run. His departure created a storm, not just in Oxford but across the SEC. With LSU searching for a path back to national prominence after seasons of inconsistency, the hire marks a bold attempt to revive its championship identity. Burrow understands how difficult that climb can be, yet he avoided making any bold declarations about the move.At his weekly press conference, Burrow was asked about LSU’s decision. His words were brief but revealing. He said, “I think he’s a good coach. I guess we’ll see how it goes.Those are my thoughts.” The pause before he spoke circulated widely online, sparking speculation about what he truly felt. With the Bengals fighting to keep their season alive, he kept his focus on the NFL, but his measured tone showed the weight of the situation.Kiffin also addressed his exit from Ole Miss. He said, “After a lot of prayer and time spent with family, I made the difficult decision to accept the head coaching position at LSU.” He added that he wanted to finish Ole Miss’ playoff run but was denied the chance, explaining, “My request to do so was denied by Keith Carer despite the team also asking him to allow me to keep coaching them so they could better maintain their high level of performance. ” He closed that chapter by saying, “Unfortunately, that means Friday’s Egg Bowl was my last game coaching the Rebels.”LSU hopes Kiffin can restore the powerhouse atmosphere that defined Burrow’s championship season. With elite recruiting, proven success and a hungry fan base, the pressure is already intense. Whether Kiffin meets that standard will shape LSU’s future, and Burrow, from a distance, will watch like everyone else as the next era begins.Also Read: Travis Kelce’s unfiltered comments about Taylor Swift during their European vacation intensify speculation about their future","Lsu's decision to hire lane kiffin has stirred a wave of reactions across the college football world.

Auston Matthews’ captaincy questioned as former Leafs GM hints the team elevated the wrong figure,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/auston-matthews-captaincy-questioned-as-former-leafs-gm-hints-the-team-elevated-the-wrong-figure/articleshow/125697194.cms,"Former Leafs GM slams current leadership and claims Auston Matthews was the wrong choice for captain (Getty Images)

Former Leafs boss criticizes leadership group and suggests Auston Matthews isn’t the captain Toronto desperately needs





The Toronto Maple Leafs find themselves in a moment of uncomfortable reflection. What began as a bold shift in leadership by handing Auston Matthews the captaincy has now become a topic of pointed criticism, sparked by a former executive who feels the team lost its compass. The question drawing attention across the hockey world is simple. Did the Leafs pick the wrong captain, and are they now paying the price through uninspired play and fragile identity?Former Leafs GM Gord Stellick spoke plainly about the heart of the issue. He believes leadership and talent are not synonymous. He said, ""There's nothing wrong if your best player isn't a leader. All I can say is last year, you couldn't be more of a team guy, a classy guy, the way he (John Tavares) handled the transition, and then the leadership meant nothing, it's not even a visible thing. It's almost like an award to wear the C. "" His words echo the sentiment of many frustrated fans who now look back at that decision with uneasy hindsight.Stellick did not stop at questioning Auston Matthews as captain. He revealed who he would have chosen. ""If you would have asked me a few years ago, I would've picked Morgan Rielly. He kind of strikes me as a captain, but its an important thing being the captain, and the leadership group is important.""Rielly has longevity and presence, but like Matthews, has never quite taken command of the locker room in that commanding way a captain must.Tavares remains the quiet constant. A professional who knows when to speak, when to deliver and when to let his play do the talking. Yet the captaincy shift forced him to take a step back in title, even if not in spirit. Stellick suggested the leadership change carried symbolism more than substance, raising the concern that the Leafs valued optics over intrinsic leadership dynamics.Still, accountability now rests on the current leaders. As Stellick put it, ""At some point you got to evolve to be the real leaders, and that's where we're going to find out now, a litmus test, about a team that has no business [being] where they are right now, and can this leadership group lead them?"" That test is already underway.If Matthews and his leadership group cannot steer this franchise back to identity and resilience, then the Maple Leafs may soon find John Tavares acting as the quiet stabilizing force once more. Captain or not, his presence still commands respect, even without the C sewn onto his jersey.Also Read: Connor Bedard’s fearless statement after Ducks game shows he’s ready to change the NHL narrative",Former leafs gm slams current leadership and claims auston matthews was the wrong choice for captain.

Tyson Foerster's upper-body injury update affects Philadelphia Flyers' season outlook



The Philadelphia Flyers are facing a crucial early-season test after news broke. About that Tyson Foerster will be unavailable for a prolonged period. The young forward has been one of the brightest offensive sparks on the roster. And losing him mid-season threatens to disrupt the momentum Philadelphia has carefully built so far.This development arrives at a delicate point in the schedule. Along with the Flyers grinding through a demanding stretch of NHL matchups. As part of the latest NHL news roundup, the injury has quickly become a focal point among league observers, with questions emerging about scoring depth, line combinations, and how the Flyers respond without one of their most reliable goal producers.According to the team, Foerster is expected to miss approximately two to three months after suffering an undisclosed upper-body injury. At just 23 years old, he had emerged as the Flyers’ leading goal scorer, posting 10 goals in 21 games. Skating regularly on a top line alongside Noah Cates and Travis Konecny, Foerster played a major role in driving five-on-five offense and providing timely scoring.The timing of this injury could not be more challenging. The Philadelphia Flyers currently sit just above the playoff cutoff.That too, in the Eastern Conference. With a record that keeps them barely inside the Wild Card conversation. Every lineup change now carries added weight. Removing a top scorer forces the coaching staff. In order to reshuffle lines and lean heavier on secondary contributors.From an NHL injury updates perspective, this absence places added pressure on Philadelphia’s middle-six forwards to elevate their scoring output.Ultimately, how Philadelphia responds over the next several weeks may define whether this injury becomes a temporary hurdle; or the start of a difficult slide in an unforgiving conference.Also Read: NHL Update: Brad Marchand and his family hosts Thanksgiving to comfort teammates missing home","Philadelphia flyers right wing tyson foerster is expected to miss approximately two to three months after suffering an undisclosed upper-body injury.

Elden Campbell’s death leaves the NBA community grieving the loss of a homegrown Laker

If you grew up watching the Lakers in the ’90s, this one hits a little too close to home. Elden Campbell, the smooth, quiet, dependable big man who held down the paint long before the Shaq–Kobe era truly exploded, has died at just 57. The news has left longtime fans stunned, teammates emotional, and the basketball world revisiting a career that deserved way more love than it got in real time. Let’s break down his legacy, the tributes flooding in, and why Elden mattered more than most people ever realized.Elden Campbell passed away on December 2, 2025, at the age of 57, according to confirmed reports from major outlets. The cause of death has not been publicly disclosed, leaving fans and former teammates devastated and searching for answers. Campbell wasn’t just another NBA role player, he was literally a hometown kid. Born in Los Angeles, he went to high school in the city, and then got drafted by the team he grew up watching: the Los Angeles Lakers.He spent 8½ seasons with the franchise, bridging the gap between the Showtime era and the dynasty that would soon emerge with Shaquille O’Neal and Kobe Bryant. Over his 15-year NBA career, Campbell played 1,044 regular-season games, averaging 10.3 points and 5.9 rebounds per game.In 1996–97, he posted his best season: 14.9 points and 8.0 rebounds per night, a testament to his steady, underrated dominance.Although he never won a championship in purple and gold, Campbell finally captured a ring in 2004 with the Detroit Pistons and yes, in a full-circle plot twist, it came against the Lakers. But that moment didn’t change how Lakers fans remembered him. Campbell was known for his calm, effortless style, earning him the nickname “Easy E.” He played the game with a cool fluidity that contrasted the high-energy flashiness of the era.He wasn’t a headline-chasing star. He was the guy who did the dirty work: rebounding, blocking shots, and anchoring the defense. And every team he played for valued that. Former teammate Byron Scott described him as a “good dude” and said losing him was “painful.” Cedric Ceballos wrote that the loss “hurt to the bone,” reminding fans of how deeply Campbell was connected to the L.A. basketball community.Elden Campbell’s story is the kind that sticks with fans, a local kid who made it to the Lakers, stayed loyal, put in the work, and earned respect in every locker room he entered. His death at just 57 is heartbreaking, but the legacy he leaves behind is undeniable.Also read - Klay Thompson names his boat “SS Stallion” after Megan Thee Stallion — fans lose their minds","Nba champion elden campbell dies at 57.

Inside Elden Campbell’s illustrious career and glorifying legacy

Elden Campbell' journey peaked in 1997 and later shaped Detroit’s 2004 title run

The Los Angeles Lakers have suffered an untimely death of another family member. Elden Campbell, the former center of the Los Angeles Lakers who was part of the NBA championship winning team of the Detroit Pistons in 2004, passed away at the age of 57.The ex-Lakers (1990-1999), Hornets, Pistons, Nets, and Pistons player was found dead due to unknown reasons. Elden Campbell, who took home over $69 million in his 15-year NBA journey, had a scoring average of 10.3 points and 5.9 rebounds. Moreover, he was also worth $20 million. Throughout his NBA career, Elden's salary alone was about $70 million.Elden Campbell, who played in the NBA for 15 seasons, from 1990 to 2005, was always a reliable and constant figure. He was a power forward and center, and his versatility, together with his defensive skills, shot-blocking, and scoring, allowed him to build a successful and long-term career with various teams, particularly with the Lakers, where he was the main man for most of his prime.Though never selected as an All-Star, Campbell played the “go-to guy” role in different teams and even took the ring home with the Pistons in 2004.The mix of his big body, great skills, and lots of experience counted a lot and thus his long stay in the league was made possible.The Lakers of Los Angeles picked Campbell as the 27th pick during the 1990 NBA Draft. In the beginning of his career, he was a backup for famous big guys like Vlade Divac and Sam Perkins, but slowly he got more playing time because of his fame as a shot-blocker and rebounder.Elden Campbell scored an average of 14.9 points per match for the Lakers in the season of 1996-97, while he was playing with two other stars, Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant. The peak of Campbell's career was the time he spent with the Charlotte Hornets, where he posted averages of 15.3 points and 9.4 rebounds.Elden Campbell had only earned $69 million during his 15 years in the NBA. He had an average of 10.3 points and 5.9 rebounds.The best times of Campbell's career with the Lakers were in the 1990s middle to end. He was in the 1996-97 season already a steady starter and one of the most productive players in the interior of the team. His scoring and rebounding numbers were the highest in his career during the 1996-97 campaign.However, the arrival of Shaquille O'Neal in 1996 reduced Campbell's role, and he was finally traded to the Charlotte Hornets in 1999. After the Hornets moved to New Orleans in 2002 he was with the new New Orleans Hornets only a short time before getting traded to the Seattle SuperSonics. Campbell's life as a player took a major shift when in 2003 he inked a deal with the Detroit Pistons.He was a key backup player in Detroit's 2004 championship run, helping the Pistons overcome the strongly favored Los Angeles Lakers in the NBA Finals. Following his championship win, Campbell briefly played for the New Jersey Nets then returned to the Pistons before retiring in 2005.Elden Campbell, an NBA champion with the Detroit Pistons, was involved in the mother of all basketball battles.

The impact of Daniel Jones’ fractured Fibula on the Colts’ offense



Daniel Jones Broke His Fibula and Wants to Play Through the Pain - Doctor Explains

What the Colts must do to stay competitive moving forward



The Indianapolis Colts entered the 2025 NFL season with high expectations, quickly rising to the top of their division standings. However, recent developments have slowed their momentum, as the team now sits in second place. Quarterback Daniel Jones ’ fractured fibula has emerged as a key factor affecting the Colts’ offensive efficiency and overall performance.While Jones remains active on the field, the injury has clearly limited his mobility, raising concerns about how sustainable the Colts’ early-season success will be. With Anthony Richardson on Injured Reserve, Indianapolis’ depth at quarterback is limited, leaving Jones as the primary option despite his compromised condition.According to ESPN’s Jeremy Fowler, Jones can technically play through the fractured fibula, but his movement appears restricted. “He’s clearly not 100 percent, and coaches who have prepared for the Colts or watched them closely say that his mobility appears compromised,” Fowler reported. Limited mobility affects a quarterback’s ability to escape pressure, execute designed runs, and maintain timing with receivers—all critical for maintaining an effective offense.During Indianapolis’ recent loss to the Houston Texans, Jones connected on several downfield throws when the pocket remained clean, demonstrating flashes of his skill. However, ESPN analyst Dan Graziano highlighted that the missing mobility made the offense appear constrained, reducing options and forcing the Colts to rely more heavily on short, safe passes. While injuries alone do not explain the Colts’ drop to second place, Jones’ health has been a central component in their performance challenges this season.With rookie Riley Leonard as the backup, the Colts’ options are limited. Indianapolis will need to maximize Jones’ contributions while minimizing risk, a balancing act that will be critical over the next stretch of games. How the coaching staff adjusts the offensive game plan around his limitations could determine whether the Colts reclaim the top spot in their division or face continued difficulties.Jones’ ability to perform under these conditions will remain a focal point for analysts and insiders, as the Colts navigate the rest of the 2025 season. The team’s success will depend on protecting their starting quarterback while maintaining offensive productivity, a challenge that could define Indianapolis’ season outcome.Also Read: Molly Qerim speaks out after shocking First Take exit, stands firmly by friend facing serious legal trouble","The indianapolis colts entered the 2025 nfl season with high expectations, quickly rising to the top of their division standings.

finally coming back?

Why Jayden Daniels’ possible Week 14 return has the NFL watching closely



actual

If there’s one question hovering over the NFL this week like a stubborn cloud, it’s this:Commanders fans have been refreshing their timelines nonstop, waiting for any tiny hint about their rookie star’s Week 14 status. His elbow injury shook the team’s momentum, and the vibes haven’t felt the same since he went down. Now, with the Vikings matchup days away, the suspense is very real and every update has turned this into one of the most-watched storylines of the week.Jayden Daniels’ availability for Week 14 all comes down to one thing: contact clearance. The rookie quarterback has been limited in practice but active enough to spark optimism. He’s reportedly gone through “functional contact drills,” the kind where you roll, dive, and take controlled hits without real defenders slamming into you. That’s encouraging but he still hasn’t been cleared forcontact against opponents, which is the one box the medical staff can’t skip.Washington coaches say they’ll decide on Friday, a classic “wait until the last second” move that shows how tight this call really is. Some insiders describe his chances as “realistic,” but still not guaranteed.Daniels dislocated his left elbow back in Week 9, a scary-looking injury that instantly raised questions about his season. Luckily, early reports confirmed he avoided ligament damage, meaning no surgery, no long-term reconstruction, and no season-ending label.But elbow injuries are weird. Even with good news, the recovery depends on strength, stability, and whether the player can absorb hits without flinching or risking re-injury. For a mobile quarterback like Daniels, who thrives on scrambling and taking off downfield, the elbow becomes even more crucial. This isn’t just about throwing, it’s about landing, bracing, and surviving chaotic plays.If Friday comes and the medical staff still isn’t sold, Washington will roll into Week 14 with Mariota again. That means another week of conservative play-calling, fewer big designed runs, and more emphasis on safe drives.It wouldn’t be ideal, but it’s better than throwing Daniels into chaos before his elbow is ready. A setback now could cost them far more than one game. Jayden Daniels may be inching toward a return, but Week 14 is still a tight race against time. The progress is real, the optimism is growing, and the practice participation is encouraging yet nothing is locked in until that final clearance lands.Also read - Justin Herbert injury update: Chargers QB listed day-to-day after hand surgery ahead of Eagles game","Jayden daniels’ availability for week 14 all comes down to one thing: contact clearance.

Gilbert Arenas calls out Los Angeles Clippers for reportedly disrespecting legend Chris Paul

Lou Williams reveals why the Clippers moved on from $120M veteran Chris Paul

The NBA world was surprised when the Los Angeles Clippers abruptly parted ways with Chris Paul, sending the 40-year-old veteran home early this season. According to ESPN's Shams Charania, head coach Ty Lue and Paul were reportedly at odds for several weeks before Paul abruptly left the team on Wednesday, December 3.After the news broke, former NBA player Gilbert Arenas said the Clippers should pack their bags and leave Los Angeles. He went on to say that they are upset with the organization for disrespecting Chris Paul by sending him home during his retired season.The Clippers parted ways with the 12-time NBA All-Star guard in the middle of the night, prompting Arenas to embark on a heated TikTok rant on Wednesday. He said:""Ooooooh, I done had it with the Clippers now.. Y'all gon' send the best Clipper y'all ever had home and not let him finish his last year?! Okay! We playin' games?! Take y'all a**es back home then! Go back to Buffalo! Yeah! We don't want you here!""Arenas continued:""Take y'all asses back to Buffalo! We don't want you in Los Angeles! The only reason you have fans here is because you got 1980 s*x worker prices. We can take out the kids for $40!""For context, the Clippers were the Buffalo Braves in the 1970s. They relaunched as the San Diego Clippers in 1978, but then-owner Donald Sterling moved the team to Los Angeles in 1984. Following the Clips' recent move, Agent Zero believes it is time to turn back the clock and return to New York.For context, the Clippers and Chris Paul have parted ways. Announcing the news, ESPN insider Shams Charania wrote on his X account:""Chris Paul and his leadership style clashed with the Clippers, sources tell ESPN.Paul has been vocal in holding management, coaches and players accountable, which the team felt became disruptive. Specifically: Ty Lue was not on speaking terms with Paul for several weeks.”Additionally, Clippers president of basketball operations Lawrence Frank confirmed in a text message to ESPN Wednesday morning:""We are parting ways with Chris and he will no longer be with the team… Chris is a legendary Clipper who has had a historic career. I want to make one thing very clear. No one is blaming Chris for our underperformance. I accept responsibility for the record we have right now. There are a lot of reasons why we've struggled. We're grateful for the impact Chris has made on the franchise.""Former Paul's teammate Lou Williams provided insight into what may have prompted the decision. Williams stated that Paul's negative remarks about the Clippers' management office may have been the final straw in the team's decision to break up with him.This past offseason, Paul returned to the Clippers for what he eventually said would be his final NBA season before retiring. He posted on his Instagram Story that he was being sent home before the Clippers' road game against the Atlanta Hawks on Wednesday.To move on from Paul, the Clippers would need to waive him and pay his $3.6 million contract, agree to a buyout, or transfer him after the December 15 no-trade deadline. Los Angeles has lost 14 of its last 16 games, including five straight losses, and is 5-16 through the first 21 games of the 2025–26 NBA season.Also read: ""He has to pay 20 to $50,000""- Gilbert Arenas and Melli Monaco weigh in on Tyreek Hill’s costly divorce battle with Keeta Vaccaro","The los angeles clippers parted ways with chris paul on wednesday, december 3.

Arvid Lindblad’s old exchange with Lando Norris comes true

Arvid Lindblad recalls meeting Lando Norris five years ago



Formula 2 champion Arvid Lindblad is all set to make his Formula 1 debut with Racing Bulls in 2026. The Indian-origin racer will also be the youngest F1 driver on the grid next season, as he joins Liam Lawson in the driver line-up. Lindblad has now shared a glimpse of his quick meet-and-greet with Lando Norris five years ago, and how their tiny, casual conversation ended up coming true. Norris is currently leading the championship, which will conclude this weekend in Abu Dhabi.Arvid Lindblad will not only be competing with Lando Norris but also with senior F1 drivers like Fernando Alonso and Lewis Hamilton, who joined F1 even before Lindblad was born.A day after his F1 debut with Racing Bulls was confirmed, Lindblad shared a video from his brief meeting with Lando Norris, back when he was a fan and aspiring driver. In the video posted on his Instagram Stories, Lindblad tells Norris while shaking his hand — as the latter walks past surrounded by fans — “I want you to remember me. I'm going to see you in five years.” Norris responds, “Oh, that's nice to think of.”The video was originally posted by an Instagram page named Infour.A fan commented, “The fact he was spot on with the 5 years!! Kudos to him.” Another wrote, “Can’t wait to see this handshake again and Arvid saying, ‘I’m here 5 years later as promised!’” A fan called it “Manifestation at peak.”Arvid Lindblad had approached Lando Norris at an event after a friend challenged him, saying he didn’t have the guts to talk to the McLaren star. Recalling the incident, Lindblad told Motorsport, “I'd gotten a bit of inspiration from the Lewis Hamilton – Ron Dennis story, saying, ‘I'm going to drive one of your cars one day.’ I think he was a bit taken aback and said something like, ‘Oh, that's nice to think of.’ I'm sure there are lots of people who say those kinds of things, so it didn't really mean anything at the time. ”“But as I said, I had this belief that I would make it to F1. I had it when I said that to Lando, and I have that same belief today. It's a funny story to look back on because it has now become true. Five years later, it finally has,” he added.Arvid Lindblad is the son of a Swedish father and an Indian-origin mother.
