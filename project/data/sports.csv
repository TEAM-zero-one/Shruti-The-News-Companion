Wayne Gretzky’s son Ty Gretzky followed a different path while honoring his father’s legendary hockey legacy

While Wayne Gretzky is known around the world as the “Great One” of hockey, his eldest son Ty Gretzky has built a name for himself outside the NHL spotlight — all while preserving the legacy of his father through coaching, entrepreneurship, and family pride.Born on July 9, 1990, Ty Gretzky is the second child of Wayne and Janet Gretzky and the first of their sons. Although Ty didn’t pursue a professional hockey career like his iconic father, the sport still plays a significant role in his life. In fact, Ty co-founded The Gretzky Hockey School in 2014 with Wayne, a venture that gives young athletes across North America a chance to learn hockey fundamentals from the family that helped shape the sport.“He was my hockey guy. He loves hockey,” Wayne said about Ty during a 2021 episode of The Steam Room podcast. “We do hockey camps all over North America. He is one of my best friends and I love it.”Interestingly, Ty wasn’t named after a hockey legend — but rather a baseball icon. “I named Ty after Ty Cobb because I love baseball,” Wayne shared. It’s a nod to the family's appreciation for multiple sports, even as hockey remains central to their identity.Outside of hockey, Ty is a devoted husband and father. He married Sara Marie Cusick on February 29, 2020, in a glamorous Gatsby-style wedding in Brooklyn, New York. Together, they’ve welcomed two daughters, Sicily in 2021 and Vienna in 2023, adding another generation to the Gretzky legacy.Ty has also paid homage to his father through creative ventures like Gretzky’s Basement, a Toronto pop-up replicating Wayne’s famous memorabilia room filled with artifacts from his historic career. It’s an immersive tribute to both Wayne’s impact on hockey and the family's role in keeping that legacy alive.Also Read: Wayne Gretzky's son Ty Gretzky shows favouritism, backs Rick Tocchet's return as Flyers head coach with enthusiastic message Although Ty Gretzky may not have skated on NHL ice, he has built a legacy rooted in family, tradition, and the values passed down by one of hockey’s greatest — a quiet leader off the rink who continues to inspire the next generation.","Ty gretzky was born on july 9, 1990, in toronto, canada.

British boxer Georgia O’Connor passed away just two weeks after her engagement

The boxing community is mourning the devastating loss of British boxer Georgia O’Connor, who passed away on May 22 at the age of 25 following a courageous battle with a rare and aggressive form of cancer. A rising star with both amateur and professional success, O’Connor’s death has left a void that’s being felt deeply across the sport. O’Connor’s tragic passing followed just two weeks after the engagement announcement.Born and raised in Durham, Georgia O’Connor was a force in the ring. Her journey began with gold at the 2017 Commonwealth Youth Games, followed by podium finishes at the Youth Worlds & European Championships. She went on to win five national titles as an amateur and represented Team GB before turning professional in 2021 under Boxxer Promotions.As a pro, she maintained a perfect 3-0 record. Just months after her last fight, O’Connor faced a life-altering diagnosis— ulcerative colitis, a chronic inflammatory bowel condition. Then, in early 2024, her health took a more tragic turn when she revealed she had been diagnosed with cancer.Despite the mounting challenges, O’Connor showed remarkable strength. In February, she shared a heartfelt tribute to her partner, Adriano, writing, “If you have a man who loves you more than anything, who would burn the whole world down before he’d let it take you, hold on to him, because that kind of love is rare.”She continued, “From the moment I was diagnosed with cancer, Adriano didn’t hesitate. He quit his job without a second thought and made it his mission to fight this battle alongside me.”Her love story reached a poignant moment just two weeks before her death, when she announced their marriage on Instagram, writing: “The day I married the love of my life.” She adopted his surname and became Georgia Cardinali, giving her followers a glimpse of hope amidst her fight.The outpouring of tributes from the boxing world has been overwhelming. Boxxer Promotions, where she turned pro, said: “We are heartbroken by the passing of Georgia O'Connor. A true warrior inside and outside the ring, the boxing community has lost a talented, courageous and determined young woman far too soon. Georgia was loved, respected and admired by her friends here at Boxxer. Our thoughts are with her loved ones at this difficult time. ”Ben Shalom, CEO of Boxxer, added: “It’s hard to make sense of this. Georgia was an inspirational person and one I’ll never forget. So sorry for her family and all her friends. Truly heartbreaking.”England Boxing honored her legacy, stating: “A gifted boxer and beloved member of the amateur boxing community, she won medals at the Commonwealth Youth Games, Youth Worlds and European Championships.”Queensberry Promotions also offered condolences: “All of our thoughts are with her friends and family during this difficult time. Rest in peace, Georgia.”Also Read: UFC color commentator Daniel Cormier voices concern over the recent coach switch by Ilia Topuria ahead of UFC 317","British boxer georgia o’connor passed away on may 22 at the age of 25.

Why the Los Angeles Lakers Would Do It

Why the Warriors Would Consider It

Theandare under pressure to make big moves this offseason. After disappointing playoff exits, both teams face tough decisions—and a surprising trade involvingcould be on the table.According to Colin Keane of Sporting News , the Warriors, led by Stephen Curry , Draymond Green, and Jimmy Butler, fell short in the Conference Semifinals against the Minnesota Timberwolves. Their lack of depth and youth was exposed, signaling a need for fresh talent.Built on LeBron James and Luka Doncic, the Lakers also had defensive issues and lost to the Timberwolves in the first round. The front staff has been compelled to explore significant retooling due to their roster imbalance.Here’s the potential deal that could shake up both franchises: Draymond Green (4-time All-Star, defensive anchor)- Dalton Knecht (young sharpshooting wing)- Rui Hachimura (expiring contract)- 2031 first-round draft pick LeBron James , now 40, is still elite, but the Los Angeles Lakers must maximize their championship window.Draymond Green’s defensive versatility and playmaking would immediately elevate their roster.- Defensive Upgrade: Green’s ability to guard multiple positions fixes a major Lakers weakness.- Leadership: His vocal presence and playoff experience would bolster the locker room.- Win-Now Move: Knecht’s potential doesn’t align with the Lakers’ urgency to contend.As writer Colin Keane noted: ""Green would be heartbroken to trade in his Warriors uniform and go somewhere else, but his positive relationship with LeBron has been well-documented.""According to Colin, trading Draymond Green would be emotional, but the Golden State Warriors must plan for life after Curry.- Future Assets: Knecht and the 2031 pick offer long-term upside.- Financial Flexibility: Hachimura’s expiring deal clears future cap space.- Youth Movement: Green’s departure accelerates a rebuild around younger talent.While this specific trade might not be enough, the Warriors should keep an open mind if better offers emerge.Both teams are at a crossroads. The Los Angeles Lakers get a proven winner in Draymond Green, while the Golden State Warriors secure assets for the future. Whether this deal happens or not, one thing is clear: major changes are coming for these franchises.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Golden State Warriors could eye $70 million Boston Celtics point guard to boster squad after unfortunate playoff exit This trade scenario remains speculative, but it highlights the tough choices ahead for both teams.

"“Doing less than he used to”: Former Dallas Cowboys' quarterback raises eyebrows, suggests Taylor Swift may be changing Travis Kelce’s entire life",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/doing-less-than-he-used-to-former-dallas-cowboys-quarterback-raises-eyebrows-suggests-taylor-swift-may-be-changing-travis-kelces-entire-life/articleshow/121315979.cms,"Tony Romo speaks about the Travis Kelce-Taylor Swift phenomenon (Getty Images)

Tony Romo weighs in on the Travis Kelce-Taylor Swift phenomenon



Tony Romo believes Travis Kelce 's relationship with Taylor Swift is beneficial, asserting ""he’s probably doing less than he used to when he was younger."" Romo suggests the increased media attention masks a quieter lifestyle, arguing, ""it can be a net positive if you look at it closely. ""Former Dallas Cowboys quarterback and current CBS Sports analyst, Tony Romo, offers a unique perspective on the highly publicized relationship between Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce and pop superstar Taylor Swift. Far from viewing it as a distraction, Romo contends that the high-profile romance is a ""net positive"" for Kelce, both professionally and personally.Tony Romo, 45, who himself experienced the spotlight dating Jessica Simpson during his NFL career, suggests that the public perception of Kelce's social life might be misleading. ""People won’t even realize this, but he’s probably doing less than he used to when he was younger,” Romo exclusively told Us Weekly. He elaborates that the frequent photographs of Kelce and Swift dining out merely capture a routine activity, akin to a married couple.“If you get your picture taken going to dinner with your superstar girlfriend, it looks like you’re going out or something. No, he just went to dinner. Almost as if he’s married, going to dinner with his wife or something.He didn’t get photographed when he was going out with his buddies all the time.”According to Romo, the increased media coverage actually belies a more settled existence for the athlete. “He’s far less out there. He’s doing far less things than when he was younger. It’s just the fact that if you’re written about a lot and it’s not about football, some people are always going to think that it plays a role. But the truth is that it can be a net positive if you look at it closely.”Addressing Kelce's statistically modest 2024 season, which saw career lows in touchdowns and receptions, Romo believes it was a natural adjustment to the intense scrutiny. “That was his first whole season being under that microscope,” Romo noted, referencing the start of their relationship in September 2023. “It was the first full season and offseason where the public and the world knew. Like anybody, we all learn through experience and we get wiser. ”Romo expresses full confidence in Kelce's ability to navigate this new level of fame, drawing parallels to his own experiences. “Not that [Kelce] has to do anything,” Romo explained.“The guy is a [future] Hall of Famer who has played at the highest level. He’s won Super Bowls. He’s made some of the biggest plays in the most clutch situations ever. I think he’ll figure things out real quick, even if there was something to figure out. I think everyone should just put their trust in him.” He concluded by adding, “And I think he’s got himself a wonderful, wonderful girlfriend.”On a personal note, Romo, now a father of three, embraces a busy family life, finding comfort and convenience in his Skechers Hands Free Slip-ins®. “Me and my wife are taxi cab drivers these days,” Romo joked.“Going from practice to practice to pickup to games. It’s a blast. It’s really one of the great times in my life doing all of this. That’s where Skechers works because I have the slip-on shoe and can be like, ‘Oh, gotta go to the next one. Oh! Didn’t realize we had another one. Slip it on and go.’”Also Read: Did Travis Kelce just confirm he’s living with Taylor Swift?

Luke Kornet's playoff surge and Boston's financial constraints could pave the way for a Lakers acquisition

The Lakers in Los Angeles are trying to enhance their team with stars like LeBron James and Luka Doncic, and they’re reportedly interested in Boston Celtics center Luke Kornet as a potential new player. Kornet has had some standout moments, particularly in the 2025 playoffs, making him a hot free-agent target. This situation creates extra tension for Celtics fans, as the idea of losing a key player to their historic rivals is quite nerve-wracking during the offseason.During Game 5 of the Eastern Conference Semifinals against the New York Knicks, Luke Kornet put on a fantastic show, scoring 10 points with perfect accuracy, collecting nine rebounds, and achieving a career-high of seven blocks in merely 26 minutes. This performance highlighted his defensive capabilities and his talent for rising to the challenge when it matters.During the 2024–25 NBA season, Kornet put up an average of 6.0 points, 5.3 rebounds, and 1.6 assists each game, boasting a remarkable 66.8% shooting percentage across 73 regular-season games. His playoff performance showcased even more of his skill, as he shot 72.4% from the field.This offseason, the Boston Celtics are facing major financial hurdles, being more than $40 million over the luxury tax and $20 million into the second apron, which results in significant financial penalties.With Kornet becoming an unrestricted free agent, the Celtics could have a hard time holding onto him, especially if other teams make more appealing offers.The Los Angeles Lakers are on the lookout for a dependable center to support LeBron James and Luka Doncic, and they might see Kornet as a perfect match. His skills as a lob threat and rim protector fit right into what the Lakers need. Plus, bringing Kornet on board would not just fill a gap in their lineup but also take away a key player from their rivals, the Celtics.The Lakers aren't flying solo in their pursuit. It seems the Golden State Warriors have their sights set on Kornet too, aiming to strengthen their frontcourt without adding to their luxury tax concerns.Also Read: Caitlin Clark says Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce are in ‘vacation mode’ as Indiana Fever fans hope for a surprise game visit Luke Kornet has been performing consistently, and with the Celtics facing financial limits, he’s a top target for teams like the Lakers.

It was around 3 AM in Canada when Damandeep Singh's mobile started buzzing. When he finally woke up, there were hundreds of congratulatory texts about his son, Harvansh Singh Pangalia, getting selected for India’s U-19 squad for the upcoming tour of England ""15-16 ghante truck chalaane ke baad neend kahaan khulti hai (After driving a truck for 15-16 hours, you can't wake up that easily from a mobile's vibration),"" Damandeep told TimesofIndia.com over the phone from Brampton.""There are so many congratulatory messages. It feels good. It brings back so many memories of when Harvansh said 'no' to me about moving to Canada. He was rigid, and he's living his dream,"" said Damandeep.India U-19 wicketkeeper-batter Harvansh Singh hails from Gandhidham, a small town in Gujarat's Rann of Kutch. Growing up, he saw his father, Damandeep Singh, and uncle, Kunwarajeet Singh, who played cricket in their town. Interestingly, both of them were wicketkeepers. Now, Harvansh's family is settled in Canada, where his father drives a truck in Brampton.""My elder brother and I were crazy about cricket. We used to play for the sake of a hobby,"" he recollected.""Even Rajkot is 200 km away from our city. It was only in 2012 when the Saurashtra Cricket Association (SCA) opened an academy in our town. I enrolled Harvansh in it when he was six. He picked up 'keeping from me, as I used to don the gloves as well. But he turned southpaw because of Yuvraj Singh . He's a massive Yuvraj fan and hasn't seen peak Yuvraj, but he was obsessed with the video of him hitting six sixes off Stuart Broad,"" said Damandeep.Damandeep never thought a video of Yuvraj Singh's six sixes would make his son so obsessed with the game that he would vow to represent his country.In 2017, Damandeep decided to move to Canada to join his elder brother and sister, but his son Harvansh refused to leave. He wanted to pursue cricket and was hell-bent on making a name for himself in the sport.""My mother, elder brother, and sister all moved to Canada. My plan was the same, but Harvansh wouldn't agree to leave India. He wanted to pursue his dream of playing for India. My wife, Jaspreet Kaur, and I tried hard to convince him, but he was determined,"" said Damandeep.""Papa India hi khelna hai (I want to play for India only). Many relatives tried hard to make him understand that it would be easier for him to play cricket in Canada because the competition is less there. But he kept on arguing, 'easy kuch bhi nahi chahiye aur jab khelna hi hai toh India ke liye khelunga' (I don't want anything easy in my life, and when I play, I will play for India only).'""After a while, Damandeep and Jaspreet gave up.""I told him, 'Fine, you play your cricket. Let's make a decision after U-19. If you don't get picked for India, then just pack your bags and move to Canada,'"" he said.The family got divided. Damandeep is settled in Brampton, putting in hours driving a truck on the road to earn money, while Harvansh stayed back in Gandhidham with his mother. The teenager, however, made a promise to his father that one day he would get them back to India.""I live with my mother, and he lives with his,"" laughed Damandeep.While Harvansh took a giant step in cricket with the help of SCA, and especially Jaydev Shah (president of the SCA), who has taken a keen interest in Harvansh's career growth, Damandeep, on the other hand, is battling the ongoing recession in Canada.""I used to sit in our office and look at our transport business. Here in Canada, I'm driving a truck. Life is hard here—six days a week on the road, driving 15-16 hours every day. It's not easy. But when I see him taking these giant leaps, I feel the hardship is worth it. He keeps telling me to come back. And like any desi father, I tell him that I'm saving money for his future if cricket doesn't work out,"" said Damandeep.Damandeep is set for another 14-hour drive, while about 13,296 km away in Bengaluru, Harvansh has checked into the National Cricket Academy (NCA) for their one-month camp before the England tour. Damandeep is hopeful that one day there will be no distance, and he will be cheering every run hit, every catch, and every stumping by Harvansh from the stands.","India u-19 wicketkeeper-batter harvansh singh hails from gandhidham, a small town in gujarat's rann of kutch.

Patrick Mahomes Olympic Flag football dream; Can NFL star dominate LA28’s Olympic sport?



Patrick Mahomes has already cemented his status as one of the NFL’s all-time greats with three Super Bowl wins under his belt. Yet, the Kansas City Chiefs superstar is now setting his sights on something far less conventional for a football player: an Olympic gold medal. With flag football officially added to the 2028 Los Angeles Olympic Games, Mahomes’ expressed interest in representing Team USA has ignited a heated conversation about the future of football and the intersection of professional sports with the Olympic movement.In May 2025, NFL owners approved a historic decision of allowing league players to compete in the Olympic flag football tournament at LA28. This marks football’s official entry onto the Olympic stage in a faster, non-contact form that emphasizes agility and skill. But is flag football really a natural fit for NFL stars like Patrick Mahomes, or is it a bridge too far?Mahomes has been candid about the challenges. “There’s the want to, I just don’t know if my skill set is what is required for flag football,” he said. Unlike traditional quarterbacks who often stay in the pocket, flag football demands scrambling, dodging, and nonstop movement. By 2028, Mahomes will be in his early 30s—an age when many players start to slow down. He even joked about possibly joining as a coach or consultant instead, showing respect for the flag football athletes who have been mastering their craft for years.The debate also touches on the unique prestige of Olympic gold. For many American athletes from golf to basketball, an Olympic medal is the ultimate achievement, one that goes beyond professional success. Mahomes chasing Olympic gold suggests he wants to expand his legacy beyond the NFL and earn a truly global honor.Also Read: Dallas Cowboys could sign Amari Cooper after George Pickens trade Critics worry, however, that this could blur the lines between sports and turn the Olympics into a showcase for crossover stars instead of specialists. As LA28 approaches, the spotlight will be on Mahomes and the future of football at the Olympics. Will this be a groundbreaking new chapter or spark ongoing controversy? The game of football is evolving in ways few expected.","Nfl star patrick mahomes has expressed interest in representing team usa at la28.

Amari Cooper comeback could be the key to Dak Prescott ’s success



Why The Hell Did The Steelers Trade George Pickens For A 3rd Round Pick?! | Pat McAfee Show

The strategic case for bringing Amari Cooper back to Dallas



The Dallas Cowboys bolstered their offense by trading for George Pickens, but their pursuit of wide receiver help may not be over. Prior to the trade, reports linked the team to a possible reunion with Amari Cooper, now a free agent. With depth still a concern, Cooper remains a potential target as Dallas looks to stay competitive in the NFC East.While the George Pickens trade has sparked excitement among Cowboys fans, questions remain about whether Dallas has done enough to support Dak Prescott. If the team hopes to keep pace with NFC East rivals like the Eagles, it may need more than just Pickens and CeeDee Lamb. That’s where a potential Amari Cooper reunion enters the conversation.Once the Cowboys' top wideout, Cooper was traded to the Browns in 2022 and then moved to the Bills in 2024. Now a free agent, his name is resurfacing in Dallas—a move that could bring veteran stability to a receiving corps still searching for consistency.The Cowboys opted not to draft a receiver this year, showing confidence in players like Jalen Tolbert and Jonathan Mingo. However, both remain unproven. Depending solely on Lamb and Pickens could leave the offense vulnerable, especially in high-stakes matchups.Re-signing Cooper would be both strategic and familiar. He totaled nearly 4,000 receiving yards and 27 touchdowns during his time in Dallas and earned his fifth Pro Bowl nod in 2023. Spotrac projects his market value at $37 million over two years, but with the offseason winding down, a more affordable deal isn't out of the question.Also Read: NFL rookie Ashton Jeanty gives up Mercedes-Level cash for Jersey No. 2 Jerry Jones is well-known for making bold, high-profile moves that often involve bringing back former stars to reignite the team’s success. Amari Cooper fits perfectly into this pattern. As the Dallas Cowboys face tough competition from NFC East rivals like the Washington Commanders and Philadelphia Eagles. Re-signing Cooper wouldn’t just be a sentimental nod to the past; it could be a crucial, strategic move to bolster the Cowboys’ receiving corps and give Dak Prescott the reliable weapon he needs to compete at the highest level.","Cowboys eye cooper return to boost offense.

WWE Superstar Zoey Stark made her comeback to the limelight in a tragic manner on the recent episode of Monday Night RAW. What was supposed to be a critical milestone in her career, Stark got severely injured in her knee in a triple-threat qualifying match for the 2025 Women's Money in the Bank (MITB) ladder match. The incident has not only sidelined her from one of WWE’s most prestigious events but may also signal a prolonged absence from in-ring competition.The accident occurred at the Bon Secours Wellness Arena in Greenville, South Carolina, during a MITB qualifier bout between Zoey Stark, Kairi Sane, and Rhea Ripley. At its climax, Stark tried her characteristic springboard dropkick—a sportslike move that requires agility and accuracy. In targeting Kairi Sane, Stark slipped in executing the springboard, resulting in her awkwardly landing on her right leg.The blow caused her knee to bend in a distinctly unnatural manner, quite visibly startling both supporters and commentators. The match instantly became secondary as paramedics rushed onto the field to treat the hurt athlete. After the botched maneuver, Stark fell to the floor, cradling her right knee and exhibiting obvious signs of pain and distress. The referee stopped the match for a moment and motioned for medical attention. WWE ringside physicians made their way into the ring and evaluated her condition.Despite the extent of the injury, Stark first tried to leave the ring independently. She tried to stand, only to fall again, as she could no longer bear the weight of herself. Eventually, she was assisted backstage by medical personnel, affirming the severity of the ordeal.Veteran WWE play-by-play commentator Michael Cole guessed on-air that Stark may have re-aggravated an old injury. Stark had extensive knee surgery in 2021 to repair a torn ACL, MCL, and meniscus—injuries requiring months of rehabilitation.With the visual similarity and reaction of Stark, there is an increasing fear that her current injury is a recurrence or exacerbation of the same condition of the knee. But to date, WWE has not issued a formal medical diagnosis or recovery timeline. The wrestling fraternity came in support of Stark after the injury. AEW wrestler Thunder Rosa showed her concern with a heartfelt post on social media:""Wrestling is a lovely and risky sport. We leave everything on the table every time we go to the ring, and we also put a lot on the line when we do what we are passionate about. Zoey Stark, I love you, sister, and I hope that you heal soon."" — Thunder Rosa through X (previously Twitter)Zoey Stark's RAW match was her first on television since January. She had last remained an active member of the dissolved faction Pure Fusion Collective, after Sonya Deville and Shayna Baszler left. Stark was competing mainly in non-televised WWE house shows and sporadic Main Event tapings before this return.As a result of her earlier knee damage incurred during her stint in NXT, Stark was drafted to the main roster as part of the 2023 WWE Draft—a testament to how much the WWE believed in her promising future. The MITB qualifier was set to be a career-launching experience, which made her untimely injury so much more heartbreaking.With Stark out, the match went on between the remaining participants. Rhea Ripley took advantage of the situation, overpowering Kairi Sane and finishing the match with her characteristic Riptide finisher. The pinfall win earned Ripley a spot in the upcoming ladder match for Women's Money in the Bank, which is to be held on June 7. Ripley’s victory, however, was overshadowed by the concern surrounding Stark’s health, as WWE fans and analysts alike shifted focus to the severity of the injury.The extent of Stark’s injury remains unconfirmed by WWE, leaving her return date unknown. Given her history of severe knee damage, fans and medical experts fear that she could face another lengthy recovery process. This injury not only removes her from one of WWE’s most career-defining matches but also risks stalling the momentum she had just begun to regain. For now, Zoey Stark’s fans—and the WWE Universe as a whole—await official word from WWE’s medical team.",Wwe superstar zoey stark suffers a painful knee injury during mitb qualifier bout.

Poll Who was the standout performer in the match between Lucknow Super Giants and Gujarat Titans? Mitchell Marsh Nicholas Pooran Shahrukh Khan Akash Singh

Lucknow Super Giants secured a consolation 33-run victory over Gujarat Titans in Ahmedabad on Thursday, powered by Mitchell Marsh's maiden IPL century of 117 runs off 64 balls. The win prevented GT from sealing a top-two spot in the league table, as LSG posted 235 for 2 in their 20 overs while restricting GT to 202 for 9.Mitchell Marsh's innings featured 10 fours and eight sixes, standing as the backbone of LSG's impressive total. He partnered with Aiden Markram for a 91-run opening stand and later added 121 runs with Nicholas Pooran in just 8.3 overs.Nicholas Pooran continued his strong form, scoring his fifth half-century of the season in 23 balls, finishing with an unbeaten 56 off 27 deliveries. Markram contributed 36 runs off 24 balls to the team's cause. LSG's batting performance included a record 17 sixes in an IPL match. Marsh, who started slowly, showed exceptional control in hitting both straight and square off the wicket using his reach.Will O'Rourke, who replaced Mayank Yadav in the LSG squad, proved to be standout bowler with 3 for 27.Gujarat Titans' chase began promisingly with Sai Sudharsan scoring 21 off 16 balls and captain Shubman Gill making 35 off 20 balls. However, both openers failed to convert their starts into substantial innings, falling before the close of the 8th over. Jos Buttler contributed 33 runs off 18 balls before falling to a clever delivery from Akash Singh, who managed to bowl despite injuring and bleeding from his right hand.Shahrukh Khan and Sherfane Rutherford provided hope for GT with an explosive 86-run partnership in just 6.4 overs. Shahrukh scored 57 off 29 balls while Rutherford made 38, but their efforts proved insufficient against the large target. LSG's bowling attack faced some pressure as Akash Deep and Shahbaz Ahmed struggled to contain runs. The team's ground fielding also showed room for improvement.Gujarat Titans, despite already qualifying for the playoffs, missed an opportunity to secure 20 points and strengthen their position in the top two. They will now need to win their final match to maintain their chances of a top-two finish.Punjab Kings and Royal Challengers Bangalore remain in contention for the top position, making the final league matches crucial for playoff positioning.Marsh's century came off 56 balls, with particularly aggressive batting against R Sai Kishore, who had previously been economical in the tournament. His batting display included consecutive sixes off Purple Cap holder Prasidh Krishna, demonstrating his dominance over the GT bowling attack.The match highlighted LSG's batting strength when their top order performs, with Marsh, Markram, and Pooran showcasing their ability to dominate opposition bowling.","Lucknow super giants beat gujarat titans by 33 runs.
