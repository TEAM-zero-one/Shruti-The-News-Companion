Juan Soto says things don't feel the same with Aaron Judge batting behind him

""It's definitely different. I had the best hitter in baseball hitting behind me.""

Yankees insider reports Juan Soto ""got what he wanted"" but lost something huge

and said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not really going to go back and forth with this. Juan Soto just needs to keep being himself. He‚Äôs going to be fine.‚Äù

The 2025 MLB season is already hot, and fans are buzzing about one major story: Juan Soto's performance with the New York Mets. Following his massive deal to sign a $765 million contract and depart the Yankees to join the Mets, everyone is looking at him. The Mets signed Juan Soto to bring offense to their team, but his start hasn't been so great. He has hit .250/.392/.467 this year, below his normal figures. That's not what fans were hoping for from one of baseball's superstars.In an interview with Mike Puma of the New York Post, Juan Soto expressed his opinions. He stated that it feels odd to no longer have Aaron Judge hitting behind him like he did when he was with the Yankees. Juan Soto explained that pitchers would be more cautious when Aaron Judge was up next, and now things are different.He stated,These were words that made headlines in a hurry, and some Yankees fans took it personally.Certain baseball analysts would assert that Juan Soto is slowly settling into the Mets, and time may just be needed. Despite his present stats being low, he still manages to get on base a lot and hit balls hard. Barely three days ago, he registered a solid homer off the Minnesota Twins. Thus, he is still a scary hitter.An anonymous individual in the Yankees' organization had a forceful response to Juan Soto's statement. He stated, ""What was he expecting? The guy wanted his money; he received it. But he surrendered a lot too."" This illustrates that some believe Juan Soto made a decision out of money, but perhaps didn't consider what he'd be losing at the Yankees, such as playing alongside Aaron Judge.Even Aaron Judge was asked about it. He stayed calmAaron Judge doesn‚Äôt seem angry, he just wants Juan Soto to focus and do well.Also Read: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Definitely Different‚Äù- Mets‚Äô Juan Soto Opens Up About Pitching Changes After He Left Yankees","‚Äúwhat did he expect?‚Äù- yankees fire back after juan soto remarked on aaron judge. ‚Äúit's definitely different.

Patriots‚Äô bold QB shift: What Milton‚Äôs trade means



HIGHLIGHTS: Joe Milton III's Best Plays vs. Buffalo Bills | NFL Week 18

The New England Patriots are making significant waves this offseason, but not all of their moves are as straightforward as they might seem. After a deeply disappointing 4-13 season, head coach Mike Vrabel is taking decisive action to overhaul the team‚Äôs roster, with a sharp and strategic focus on revitalizing the quarterback position. While much of the media attention is centered around rookie quarterback Drake Maye , who promises to be the team‚Äôs future under center, a surprising decision has raised more than a few eyebrows: the trade of the promising young QB Joe Milton III to the Dallas Cowboys.Joe Milton III showcased impressive talent during his brief appearances last season, including a notable debut in Week 18. With a cannon of an arm and raw potential, many believed he could be the future of the Patriots' quarterback room. However, the team‚Äôs decision to trade him for a fifth-round pick rather than developing him further, has many wondering if New England is betting too early on their new direction.The Patriots are putting their chips on Drake Maye, the No. 3 overall pick in 2024, and veteran Joshua Dobbs as the backup. With a revamped offensive line and new playmakers like Stefon Diggs , New England is prioritizing stability and experience under center. But is moving on from Milton too soon?Given Milton‚Äôs impressive athleticism and untapped upside, trading him now could very well be a missed opportunity for the Patriots. Teams with uncertain quarterback futures, especially those looking to rebuild, could have offered a more valuable return for Milton earlier in the offseason. By moving him so quickly, New England may have rushed the decision, potentially leaving room for regret if Milton goes on to find success as a starter elsewhere.Also Read: ‚ÄúI'm not Taylor Swift‚Äù - Serena Williams breaks silence on Super Bowl cameo with Kendrick Lamar The timing of the trade only adds to the uncertainty surrounding the move, raising more questions than answers. If Milton develops into a solid starter or even an elite quarterback down the line, the Patriots‚Äô decision to trade him so soon could become a major regret. New England‚Äôs gamble on Drake Maye could certainly pay off, but only time will tell if they made the right call in letting go of a player with so much potential. For now, the Patriots are focused on the present, but the future of their quarterback situation remains anything but certain.","Joe milton iii was traded to the dallas cowboys for a fifth-round pick.

Drew McIntyre breaks down John Cena and The Rock‚Äôs WWE personas

""Those guys [Rock and Cena] don't have to do it. Aside from the fact they made their name in wrestling and WWE at the top, top level, they're Hall of Famers, they've won everything there is to win, and giant household names. Then they transitioned over to Hollywood to show that wrestlers can do it all. Like, Rock's the biggest box office attraction in the world. Cena's absolutely killing it right now. There's no reason they have to come back and do what they're doing. They come back because they love it, because they're addicted to the crowd reaction, 'cause it's in their blood,"" said the WWE star.

""It's so cool to see that even as successful as they are, legitimately, especially Rock's case, the biggest stars in the world, they still want to come back and feed that addiction, which is the adrenaline addiction, the crowd reaction that you get.""

'I take the blame': Ajinkya Rahane after KKR's defeat to Punjab Kings

NEW DELHI: In a dramatic moment during Kolkata Knight Riders ' (KKR) Indian Premier League 2025 clash against Punjab Kings (PBKS) in Mullanpur, Sunil Narine's bat failed the official gauge test ‚Äî highlighting the BCCI's recent clampdown on oversized bats during live IPL matches.The incident occurred just before KKR began their unsuccessful chase of PBKS' modest 112-run target.Also See: DC vs RR Reserve umpire Saiyed Khalid conducted random checks outside the playing area, where Narine and fellow KKR batter Angkrish Raghuvanshi stood together. While Raghuvanshi's bat passed the standard test, the thickest part of Narine's bat couldn't slide through the house-shaped gauge, violating ICC's prescribed bat size limits.Despite the bat drama, Narine had a mixed outing ‚Äî claiming 2 for 14 with the ball but managing just 5 runs with the bat. Raghuvanshi top-scored for KKR with 37 off 28, yet the team crumbled from 62 for 2 to 95 all out.A second bat-related interruption came in the 16th over when Anrich Nortje was stopped by on-field umpires Mohit Krishnadas and Saidharshan Kumar. Nortje's bat also failed the gauge test, prompting substitute Rahmanullah Gurbaz to rush in with a replacement. However, the match ended before he could face a ball, as Andre Russell was dismissed immediately.These live checks mark a shift in BCCI protocol, with bat dimensions now scrutinised mid-match to prevent players from gaining illegal advantages through oversized blades. While previously done in dressing rooms, this season has seen on-field checks involving several players, including Shimron Hetmyer, Phil Salt, and Hardik Pandya.The ICC allows a maximum bat face width of 10.79 cm, blade thickness of 6.7 cm, edge width of 4 cm, and overall length of 96.4 cm.","Kolkata knight riders batsman sunil narine's bat fails gauge test.

Humpy got the good vibes after Divya played ‚Äòh6‚Äô on the 11th turn i n t h e Fo u r Knights Symmetrical English, an opening in which both are not regulars.Though the engine did not object to Divya‚Äôs pawn push, Humpy felt it was ‚Äúbad‚Äù. The 38-year-old even searched for a mating attack by first putting her knights in the centre and then getting a double bishop advantage (against knight and bishop; in rook and pawns each endgame).But she had to recalibrate her thoughts after Divya fought well. Humpy had to accept that the likelihood of mating attack had evaporated. She had to be flexible, ruthless and practical in this phase when queens were exchanged. And she squeezed out the winning advantage in a professional manner.Divya resigned when she was about to lose material. Earlier, Divya felt she had not made the time control after the first 40 moves. Her move sheet was showing only 38 moves since she had written them close to each other and not in the designed rectangles.Here again Humpy‚Äôs wisdom showed as she made some waiting moves to ensure that she would make the time control even if the fault could be spotted in her notation of moves later",K humpy beat her rival divya deshmukh in the third round of the fide women‚Äôs grand prix on wednesday. Humpy is the reigning world rapid champion and has maintained her status as india's premier woman player.
