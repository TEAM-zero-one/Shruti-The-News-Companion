NEW DELHI: Team India fast bowler Mohammed Siraj has etched his name into Indian cricket history by surpassing the legendary Sachin Tendulkar in total international wickets.With his fiery spell amassing four crucial wickets on Day Two of the fifth Test against England at The Oval, Siraj’s international wicket tally now stands at 203, comprising 118 in Tests, 71 in ODIs, and 14 in T20Is, eclipsing Tendulkar’s career total of 201 (46 in Tests, 154 in ODIs, and 1 in T20Is).The landmark came as Siraj led a gritty Indian fightback after England’s openers launched a fierce counterattack on a seamer-friendly pitch.Ben Duckett and Zak Crawley raced to 92 in just 77 balls before Duckett’s dismissal brought some relief. Siraj, however, rose to the occasion in the afternoon session, delivering an incisive eight-over spell that dismantled England’s middle order.He removed key batters Ollie Pope, Joe Root, and Jacob Bethell in quick succession.Siraj’s signature nip-backers and a lethal yorker showcased his command over seam movement and swing, underlining why he’s become such a potent force in India’s bowling arsenal. Prasidh Krishna supported brilliantly, finishing with four wickets of his own, including the tail-enders, as England were bowled out for 247, just 23 runs ahead. Harry Brook’s explosive 53 off 64 briefly resisted the slide, but Siraj’s intensity and relentlessness proved too much.By stumps, India had seized momentum. Yashasvi Jaiswal’s aggressive 51 not out and India’s 75 for 2 in their second innings gave them a lead of 52, setting the stage for a thrilling contest ahead.","Mohammed siraj surpasses sachin tendulkar in total international wickets.

Night 1 of WWE SummerSlam 2025, held at the MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey saw an electric crowd. For the first time in the history of the event, SummerSlam is a two-night show, and Night 1 saw an audience of 53,161 inside the arena. There were six matches set for the night, and each one had the fans cheering for their favorites.From chants of The OTC to boos for Logan Paul and of course, the main event of the night - CM Punk vs. GUNTHER that everyone was waiting for, the first night of the 38th edition of SummerSlam was a resounding success. With Cardi B hosting the big event, it started off with a bang. And now let's take a look at all the winners and top performers of the night.The opening match of the night was a tag team match between Roman Reigns and Jey Uso , who faced off against Bron Breakker and Bronson Reed. All hell broke loose from the very beginning, as the four opponents were at each other's throats as soon as the bell rang. Reigns missed a chunk of the action at the beginning, before he finally got tagged in. The match ran for over 21 minutes, with Reigns and Uso emerging as the winners.Raquel Rodriguez and Roxanne Perez vs. Charlotte Flair and Alexa Bliss was going to be an explosion of power-packed performance from the very beginning. Bliss and Flair were always the crowd favorite with their reluctant partnership act, and though the Judgment Day duo had a lot of power in them, it wasn't enough to overcome the veterans. The match ended with Charlotte Flair and Alexa Bliss becoming the new WWE Women's Tag Team champions.The first singles match of the night saw Sami Zayn and Karrion Kross come up against each other once again. The tides kept shifting from one side to another for the whole time. And of course, it wouldn't be complete without Scarlett trying to interfere for her partner, this time with a steel pipe, and then distracting the referee. But in this match-up, Zayn managed to take the win over Kross once again after a Helluva Kick to his opponent. Tiffany Stratton vs. Jade Cargill was the shortest match of the night, running for just a little over seven minutes. But both women kept the momentum of the night going with their powerful performances. The current Queen of the Ring challenged Stratton for her title belt, who has yet to lose a match this year. And Stratton showed Cargill why she is the reigning champion, as she managed to retain her belt after yet another title defense.This fight began even before the bell rang, when Logan Paul punched Jelly Roll, leading to a heated exchange between all four wrestlers. The fight was heated, with each one of them trying to gain the upper hand. Roll was almost led off the stage by officials after a splash by Paul turned way too much for the celebrity wrestler. But he came in to help his partner, Randy Orton . Unfortunately, it didn't work for long, and a Claymore Kick from Drew McIntyre and a Fall From Grace frogsplash from Paul, the match ended with Roll taking the pin.The main event of SummerSlam Night 1 saw CM Punk and GUNTHER come face to face for the third title match of the night. With the World Heavyweight Championship title on the line, GUNTHER was not going to have Punk take it away from him that easily. The match continued for more than 30 minutes before CM Punk finally emerged as the winner and the new World Heavyweight Champion of WWE.His emotions after getting the title belt and the tears spoke more than any words could. But the night is yet to end, as Seth Rollins walks in with Paul Heyman, who still has his Money in the Bank briefcase. But Rollins is injured, right? Well, not anymore, as he rushes in after throwing away his crutches and taking off his leg brace, and finally cashes in his MITB briefcase.It was too easy to pin an exhausted Punk, and ladies and gentlemen, Seth Rollins is now the newest World Heavyweight Champion of WWE.

CM Punk and Gunther Pulled Off a Masterpiece Before Seth Rollins Ruined the Party

In what stretched over 30 minutes, the main event between CM Punk and Gunther for the World Heavyweight Championship delivered big time. Moreover, ‘The Best in the World’ clinched his first world title in over 12 years in the WWE . However, that celebration did not last long as a returning Seth Rollins pulled off yet another heist of the century to capture the crown after cashing in his Money in the Bank contract on a battered Punk right after his hellacious war with the Austrian juggernaut. Talk about being the ultimate party popper!For those unaware, Rollins reportedly injured his right knee during a match against LA Knight at Saturday Night’s Main Event. While attempting a Lion sault off the second rope, Rollins landed awkwardly on his feet and immediately clutched his leg in visible pain. He quickly retreated to the corner, where he spoke with the referee, Paul Heyman, and the ringside doctor.An improvised finish followed, and Knight capitalized, picking up the win with a BFT moments later. In the days that followed, Rollins was seen wearing a knee brace at Evolution 2, and Triple H even gave a bleak update on his condition. But as it turns out, it was all part of a grand deception.As Punk struggled to recover after his grueling match, the arena exploded when Rollins’ music hit, sending a jolt through the crowd.

Gunther dominated early with powerful strikes and submission attempts, nearly finishing Punk multiple times. Punk showed resilience, countering a sharpshooter into a Figure Four and surviving a series of punishing powerbombs, lariats, and a top-rope frog splash.After a brutal fall through the announce table left Gunther bloodied, Punk mounted a comeback. He unloaded a flurry of offense with punches, a running knee, a clothesline, and an elbow drop. Gunther then locked in a sleeper, but Punk broke free, hit a GTS that barely fazed Gunther, then delivered a second to finally put him away.Also read: WWE SummerSlam 2025 Night 1 Quick Highlights: List of All Winners, Top Performers, and More In a hard-fought battle, Punk overcame the odds, dethroned the dominant Gunther, and reasserted himself as the top star on Raw.

Intense Browns QB competition puts rookie Shedeur Sanders under pressure



🚨BREAKING....Shedeur Sanders MAJOR INJURY Will Give SHEDEUR More Reps Next Week

Missed time could cost Shedeur Sanders his roster spot

Next few weeks could decide Shedeur Sanders’ NFL future in Cleveland

Shedeur Sanders’ NFL journey has taken another difficult turn, and his future with the Cleveland Browns is suddenly uncertain. The rookie quarterback, drafted in the fifth round at No. 144 overall, is already facing stiff competition for a roster spot. Now, an untimely injury is threatening to derail his hopes of proving he belongs in the league.Sanders entered the 2025 season with something to prove after a dramatic NFL Draft slide. Once projected as a potential first-round pick, he fell to the fifth round, where the Browns took a low-risk flyer on him. However, Cleveland’s quarterback room is already crowded. Veteran Joe Flacco brings experience, Kenny Pickett is looking for a fresh start, and fellow rookie Dillon Gabriel, selected 50 picks earlier, has an early edge in the competition.In this tight race, every rep counts, and Sanders can’t afford to miss time. That’s why the recent injury update is so concerning. The Browns revealed that Sanders is dealing with arm soreness and was held out of training camp drills. While the team hasn’t labeled the injury as serious, it’s still a red flag for a rookie quarterback trying to earn his spot.For a late-round quarterback, availability is critical. Every practice, every preseason snap is an opportunity to impress coaches and climb the depth chart. With Sanders sidelined, the Browns will give more reps to Flacco, Pickett, and Gabriel, potentially pushing Sanders further out of the rotation.If he cannot showcase his skill set soon, the Browns could explore tough options, cutting or trading the rookie. NFL teams rarely invest heavily in late-round quarterbacks, and the lack of trade interest during the draft suggests his market would be limited.Sanders’ arm soreness may seem minor, but timing is everything in the NFL. He must recover quickly and make the most of preseason opportunities to secure a role in Cleveland. Otherwise, his NFL journey could be cut short before it truly begins.Also Read: Cowboys star Micah Parsons’ NFL trade demand slammed as ‘Overhyped’ by Skip Bayless With the Browns facing tough roster decisions, Shedeur Sanders is now battling not just injury but the harsh reality of life as a late-round quarterback fighting to survive in the league.","Shedeur sanders is dealing with arm soreness and was held out of training camp drills.

Where was that energy when Jalen was under fire?

“Cam ain’t never had one of these.”

Johnny Manziel calls Gillie “the biggest loser on the planet,” threatens violence



“Yo @gilliedakid you may be the biggest fucking loser on the planet.

Talking like you’ve fucking done anything on a football field. If I see you just know I’m going to slap the fuck out of you, trust.”

“Take Jalen’s d**k out of your mouth for a couple minutes. Pretty sure he’s already got a chick.”

Fans are confused, Cam Newton is quiet, and the internet is eating it up



“IK JOHNNY MANZIEL AIN’T TALKING 😂😂😂,”

Johnny Manziel just went full savage on Gillie Da Kid in the weirdest football beef of the year.

“Not the beef I was expecting to see today,”

“This feels like an episode of a fake football reality show.”

So what’s the verdict? Just another chaotic NFL-adjacent internet moment



Of all the random feuds to erupt on the internet, this one might take the crown. Johnny Manziel, the former Cleveland Browns QB and poster boy for what-could’ve-been just launched an unfiltered verbal missile at rapper-turned-podcaster Gillie Da Kid. Why? Because Gillie came at Cam Newton over Jalen Hurts. Yes, it’s that messy.To really get this mess, you have to rewind a bit. This whole feud kicked off when Cam Newton dropped his list of the top 10 quarterbacks in the NFL and straight-up left Jalen Hurts off it. Gillie Da Kid, a proud Philly native and co-host of “Million Dollaz Worth of Game,” was not about to let that slide.Things escalated when Gillie publicly called Cam “fraudulent” for how he handled the Jalen Hurts situation. He accused Newton of staying silent when the Eagles QB was getting dragged by media and fans during the team’s slump only for Cam to suddenly speak up for Hurts after Philly re-committed to him.Gillie’s whole vibe was:Then, at his birthday party, Gillie held up a prop Lombardi Trophy and trolled Newton with the line:He also added that he was “done going back and forth” with Newton but the jab had already landed.So now we’ve got Manziel, a guy who hasn’t touched a football professionally in years, beefing with Gillie over something Cam Newton didn’t even comment on. And to no one’s surprise, the whole thing is playing out messily and publicly on X (formerly Twitter).Johnny hopped on X and didn’t hold back, posting two wild tweets aimed straight at Gillie. In one, he wrote:And just when you thought it couldn’t get any more unhinged, Manziel added:Oof. No metaphors, no filters, just pure chaos from Manziel’s keyboard.Reactions online have been priceless. Some fans are dragging Manziel for having the audacity to come at anyone considering his NFL flameout. One user clapped back,while another asked if this was the same guy who fumbled his career over “a little cocaine and OxyContin.”Others are just here for the mess, with comments like,andMeanwhile, Cam Newton has said exactly nothing, which tracks, he didn’t even respond to the original Gillie clip.There’s no real winner here, except maybe the X algorithm. Gillie Da Kid was firing shots at Cam Newton for being quiet. Then Johnny Manziel came in hot with threats and NSFW language, defending who exactly? Hurts? Cam? Himself?

The reigning best player in the NHL may stay loyal to Edmonton, but the fine print of his next deal could shape the future of both McDavid and the team.Connor McDavid isn’t just negotiating any contract- he’s expected to ink a deal that would make him the highest-paid player in NHL history. NHL insider Frank Seravalli weighed in, noting, “I don’t think $20 million is unreasonable given what he provides and how significant of an impact he has as the best player in the world. If I were looking at the Connor McDavid situation, as best I can handicap it at this point in time, my guess is somewhere between $16 and $17.5 million in AAV. Those are just ballparks. That’s the best that I can glean at this moment in time.” Seravalli estimates the ballpark figure to be between $16 million and $17.5 million in average annual value (AAV).Yet, despite the optimism surrounding a massive contract, it’s not just about the money.McDavid is likely weighing more than just figures—he’s considering legacy. The Oilers have repeatedly fallen short of lifting the Stanley Cup, including a bitter playoff exit to the Florida Panthers last season. If that trend continues, the superstar’s patience might wear thin.While rumors about Connor McDavid potentially heading to the Toronto Maple Leafs made waves recently, those talks have cooled. He remains expected to sign an extension with Edmonton. However, Seravalli provided a warning rooted in McDavid’s immense leverage: “If he decides after four years or three years or whatever that the Edmonton Oilers aren’t getting it done...the best player in the world just raises his hand and says: ‘I want out. ’”This isn’t just hypothetical. McDavid has been eligible to extend his contract since July 1, but personal matters reportedly delayed the process. Now, discussions are finally set to commence—but for how long will Edmonton be enough? The specter of a late-career switch, especially to his hometown Maple Leafs, still looms.The Oilers need more than just a signature. They need to prove to McDavid that Edmonton is where champions are made. Because if the promise of the Stanley Cup continues to fade, even the most loyal star might look elsewhere for glory. However, no matter to what extent trade rumors appear, it is Connor McDavid, who will decide his future. Will he become the highest paid player in league? Fans and critics will be watching very closely.Contract discussions were delayed due to personal matters, but they are now expected to begin soon.He is expected to sign an extension, but could leave if the Oilers fail to deliver results in the coming years.His upcoming deal is projected to make him the highest-paid player in NHL history, reflecting his elite impact on the game.Also Read: Without Mitch Marner, can Auston Matthews still carry the Maple Leafs to a Stanley Cup?","Connor mcdavid is reportedly ready to open contract discussions with the edmonton oilers.
