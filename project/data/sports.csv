Erika Kirk breaks silence after TPUSA’s halftime tribute divides Super Bowl audience

The night of Super Bowl LX was more than just football and a show. A competing halftime show away from the main broadcast stirred up feelings, controversy, and political symbolism. Turning Point USA pushed its All American Halftime Show as a patriotic alternative, drawing attention not only for its message but for the personal grief woven into the production.In the hours after the show aired, Erika Kirk broke her silence. Her words reframed the night as something deeper than a ratings fight or culture war moment. For supporters, it became a tribute. For critics, it raised fresh questions about politics, platform power, and how grief is carried into public space.The alternative show, organized by Turning Point USA, aired opposite Bad Bunny ’s NFL halftime performance during the championship game between the New England Patriots and the Seattle Seahawks. Headlined by Kid Rock, the event leaned heavily into honoring the late Charlie Kirk, who was killed in September.A montage played during the broadcast featured Kirk’s own words, including: “I want to honor God in all that I do. I want to be a great husband, a great father.I want to serve this country,” followed by: “I want to try to continue to lead this movement and to speak truth and to never lie, to stop thinking about yourself all of the time, and instead think about what you should do to help other people and defend this country above yourself.She further added, “I am so inspired by this army of freedom fighters. We’re going to be around for the next 100, 200 years because we know in the end our ideas will win.”Erika Kirk did not attend the event, but she later praised it publicly, calling the show “so incredible” and adding, “Charlie would’ve absolutely loved it. Thank you to the millions that tuned in.”She closed her message with a personal note that resonated across social media: “Ultimately, this is what it’s all about, making Heaven crowded.…I love you Charlie baby, this is all for you.”Despite being blocked from streaming on X, the broadcast claimed millions of viewers across platforms. Whether those numbers hold or not, the emotional weight of the tribute ensured the night would be remembered for more than just music or politics.","Erika kirk spoke out after turning point usa aired its alternative super bowl lx halftime show honoring her late husband, charlie kirk.

Abhishek Sharma in hospital - latest on his recovery and India nets

Poll Will Abhishek Sharma be fit to play against Namibia? Yes, he will recover in time No, he will miss the game

NEW DELHI: India batter Tilak Varma has provided encouraging fitness updates on teammates Abhishek Sharma and Jasprit Bumrah ahead of the side’s ICC T20 World Cup encounter against Namibia at the Arun Jaitley Stadium, while adding that final decisions on their participation will be taken closer to match time.Abhishek had been hospitalised earlier this week after suffering a stomach infection and missed training on Tuesday evening. Assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate had earlier confirmed that the young opener was down with a stomach bug, raising doubts about his availability. Speaking at the pre-match press conference on Wednesday, Tilak revealed that the left-hander has now been discharged and is recovering well.“When we reached Delhi, he (Abhishek) went to the hospital for the examination. I think he was discharged today, and he is doing well. We have got one more day for the game. Hopefully, we will decide by tomorrow how he feels, and we will go with it,” Tilak said.If Abhishek fails to recover in time, Sanju Samson could partner Ishan Kishan at the top of the order.Tilak also addressed concerns around pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah, who missed India’s campaign opener against the USA.The left-handed batter sounded optimistic about the star pacer’s return.“He (Bumrah) is absolutely fine now. He is doing better. As I said, we have got one more day. Hopefully, he will be back in the team. If he is doing better, the team will take a call. I think he will be back tomorrow for the second game,” he added.Beyond the Namibia clash, Tilak said the team is already gearing up for the high-voltage contest against Pakistan in Colombo on February 15. “We are very excited to play… We are watching how other teams are doing, and the preparation is on. Now we are in the match zone, and the planning will start soon,” he concluded.",Abhishek sharma was hospitalised earlier this week after suffering a stomach infection and missed training on tuesday evening.

Poll What do you think is Pakistan's biggest strength in cricket? Bowling Attack Batting Flexibility Unique Identity Team Spirit

NEW DELHI: Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha struck a confident and defiant tone after guiding his side to a convincing 32-run victory over the United States in their Group A clash at the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup, declaring that the team’s unique cricketing identity remains their biggest strength.Reflecting on the performance at the Sinhalese Sports Club, Agha summed up his team’s philosophy with a dramatic line that captured attention: “We are Pakistan, we do things differently to the world.”The Pakistan skipper, known for his calm demeanour, appeared relaxed during the post-match presentation as he praised a much-improved batting effort, particularly through the middle overs. “I always smile. When have you seen me not smile? (laughs). Clinical win. Last game we didn't bat well in the middle overs, but today we did. Once we scored 190, we knew we could defend that,” he said.Agha revealed that he would have preferred to bat first regardless of the toss, expressing full faith in Pakistan’s bowling attack to defend even modest totals. According to him, the team’s belief in setting targets reflects their fearless mindset and willingness to challenge conventional strategies.“With the kind of bowling we have, we know we can win even with 160-170,” he added.Despite that preference, the captain emphasised the adaptability within Pakistan’s batting order, highlighting a flexible approach that allows the side to respond to different match situations. “We’re comfortable with chasing as well. Our batting order is flexible. First three will probably go in the same order, but we’re flexible after that,” Agha explained, pointing to the presence of finishers who can be promoted if required or held back to close out games.While pleased with the result, Agha stressed that the team still has areas to refine, especially with the ball in the powerplay. “Always room for improvement. We like to bowl well in the powerplay. In patches we were good, but we can be more clinical,” he said.With momentum building and a high-profile clash with India on the horizon, Pakistan’s captain believes their unconventional mindset could be the difference-maker.",Pakistan beat the united states by 32 runs at the icc men's t20 world cup.

Abhishek Sharma in hospital - latest on his recovery and India nets

The ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2026 continues on February 12 with three key group-stage fixtures: Sri Lanka vs Oman, Nepal vs Italy, and India vs Namibia.Sri Lanka will face Oman after registering a 20-run win over Ireland in their previous outing. Oman, meanwhile, will be playing their first match of the tournament. However, Sri Lanka have suffered a setback ahead of the clash, as Wanindu Hasaranga has been ruled out of the World Cup due to injury. Dushan Hemantha has been named as his replacement. The match will be played at the Pallekele Stadium in Sri Lanka, starting at 11 am IST.In the second game of the day, Nepal take on Italy at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai at 3 pm IST. Nepal enter the contest high on confidence after nearly pulling off a stunning upset against two-time T20 World Cup winners England. Nepal fell short by just four runs, which was also the second-lowest winning margin for a Full Member nation against an Associate team. Italy, on the other hand, come into the match after suffering a 73-run defeat to Scotland.The third fixture will see India face Namibia at the Arun Jaitley Stadium in New Delhi at 7 pm IST. India are coming off a 29-run win over the USA, but there is a concern in the camp. Opener Abhishek Sharma is likely to miss the game due to a stomach infection, accompanied by high fever and severe weight loss. Sanju Samson , who was the designated first-choice wicketkeeper ahead of the World Cup, is likely to open the batting. Samson was dropped for Ishan Kishan because of a poor run of form in the New Zealand series.

for theagainst the Orlando Magic on Wednesday,. He is not listed on the official injury report, which usually indicates that a player is fully available. Unless there is a late change before the game, Flagg should take on his usual role in the starting lineup.His availability comes at an important time for Dallas. The team has leaned on him heavily in recent weeks, and with injuries affecting other key players, Flagg remains central to their offensive structure.Cooper Flagg sprained his left ankle in mid-January during a game against the Denver Nuggets. He missed a few games afterward and was briefly given questionable and doubtful tags for matchups against Utah and Minnesota.Since returning, he has practiced without restriction, played extended minutes, and has stayed off injury reports. Coverage before the Mavericks’ February 10 game against the Phoenix Suns also noted that he was participating normally and considered available.There have been no new concerns reported ahead of the Orlando game. As of February 11, the Mavericks have not flagged the ankle or any other injury.Dallas Mavericks enters the contest with a 19-34 record and sits near the bottom of the Southwest Division.Flagg has been one of the team’s most consistent contributors, averaging about 19 points, six to seven rebounds, and five to six assists per game while adding defensive production through steals and blocks.His role becomes more important with Kyrie Irving still out because of a knee injury and Klay Thompson listed as day-to-day. Dallas needs Flagg’s ball-handling, scoring, and passing to maintain offensive balance against an Orlando team known for its size.Flagg is expected to start alongside Max Christie, Tyus Jones, and Klay Thompson if Thompson is cleared to play. Daniel Gafford or P.J. Washington is likely to fill the remaining frontcourt spot.He is projected to play around 32 to 36 minutes and should remain the primary option in the offense.Player designations can change after morning shootaround, so checking closer to tip-off is recommended. Fans can review the NBA’s official injury report or follow team accounts and local reporters for updates.For fantasy and betting decisions, Flagg should be considered expected to play, with only a small chance of a last-minute scratch.Also read: Milwaukee Bucks vs Orlando Magic injury report: Who's playing, injured and questionable players, head-to-head records, team stats, and more (February 11, 2026) As of February 11, 2026, Cooper Flagg is healthy and on track to play when the Mavericks face the Magic.

Portis provides strong three-point shooting for a big man.Banchero leads the team in scoring, rebounding, and assists. Bane has been reliable at the free-throw line.Milwaukee must replace Giannis’ rebounding and rim protection. Turner and Portis will be important against Banchero and possibly Carter Jr. Even if Carter does not play, Orlando has enough size to compete inside.Perimeter defense could also matter. Orlando averages more steals, and Milwaukee could be thinner at guard if Rollins is unavailable.Milwaukee relies heavily on three-point shooting, with Portis and Kuzma stretching the floor. Orlando scores consistently by attacking the basket and converting free throws.: Ryan Rollins (or AJ Green): Kevin Porter Jr.: Kyle Kuzma: Bobby Portis: Myles Turner: Kevin Porter Jr. His scoring and playmaking will be important with Giannis out.: Jalen Suggs: Desmond Bane: Anthony Black: Paolo Banchero: Wendell Carter Jr. (or Goga Bitadze): Paolo Banchero.

Key storylines that could decide the Atlanta Hawks vs Charlotte Hornets game (February 11, 2026)

Theon Wednesday,, in a game that matters for both teams as they try to stay in the playoff race. Atlanta is 26-29 and third in the Southeast Division, while Charlotte is close behind at 25-29 in fourth place. With little separating them in the standings, this result could become important later in the season.The teams have already split their earlier meetings, and another tight game is expected. Player availability could shape the matchup, as Atlanta is tracking several injuries while Charlotte is missing depth in the backcourt.Atlanta Hawks may have to make game-time decisions on key players.• Jonathan Kuminga (bone bruise, left knee)• RayJ Dennis (out; G-League assignment status)• Caleb Houstan (G-League assignment)• Jalen Johnson (left knee inflammation; day-to-day)• Dyson Daniels (right ankle inflammation)• Zaccharie Risacher (left quadriceps contusion)Nickeil Alexander-Walker, CJ McCollum, Buddy Hield, Onyeka Okongwu, Christian Koloko, Mouhamed Gueye, Nikola Đurišić, Gabe Vincent, Keaton Wallace, Jock Landale, Asa Newell, and the rest of the active roster are expected to play unless there is a late update.Atlanta has lost its last two games, including a 138-116 defeat in Minnesota. Johnson’s availability is especially important because of his role in scoring and playmaking.Charlotte Hornets have fewer injuries but is still dealing with absences that affect guard depth behind LaMelo Ball.• Coby White (left calf strain; expected to miss time through the All-Star break)• Liam McNeeley (sprained left ankle)G-League / two-way assignments:• Tosan Evbuomwan• Antonio ReevesLaMelo Ball, Miles Bridges, Brandon Miller, Josh Green, Tre Mann, Collin Sexton, Pat Connaughton, Grant Williams, Tidjane Salaun, PJ Hall, Ryan Kalkbrenner, Mason Plumlee, Sion James, Kon Knueppel, KJ Simpson, and the rest of the active roster are expected to play.With White and McNeeley out, players such as Knueppel, James, and Simpson could see more minutes off the bench.Atlanta’s performance could depend on whether Johnson and Daniels are cleared before tip-off. If they do not play, the offense is likely to rely more on McCollum in half-court situations, with Hield providing perimeter shooting. Charlotte still has its main lineup of Ball, Miller, Bridges, and Sexton, but the bench could be tested.The season series has been competitive, with each team winning on the other’s home floor. Charlotte defeated Atlanta on February 7, ending a short losing streak and entering this game with some momentum.Atlanta holds a slight edge in the all-time regular-season series, but Charlotte has been more competitive since LaMelo Ball joined the team and following recent roster changes. With both teams near .500, this game carries added importance.Atlanta’s offense often runs through Johnson and McCollum, while Charlotte depends on Ball to create opportunities and on Miller for scoring. Neither team has been dominant defensively, which could lead to a higher-scoring game.Atlanta’s approach may change depending on injuries. If Johnson and Daniels play, the Hawks can push the pace more effectively. If not, the offense may slow down.Charlotte continues to adjust its rotation with White unavailable and is relying on its starting group for production. Matchups in the paint against Okongwu, Koloko, and Gueye could also matter.Both teams remain within reach of the sixth to eighth seeds in the Eastern Conference, so head-to-head results in February could affect the standings later.This game is likely to be shaped by player availability and execution. Atlanta’s chances improve if Johnson and Daniels are active, while Charlotte will look for steady play from Ball and consistent scoring from Miller.Monitor injury updates before the game, as they could influence how the matchup unfolds.","Atlanta hawks face charlotte hornets (february 11, 2026) in a game that matters for both teams as they try to stay in the playoff race.

Panthers forward Matthew Tkachuk all set to display peak form for Olympic debut with Team USA,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/panthers-forward-matthew-tkachuk-all-set-to-display-peak-form-for-olympic-debut-with-team-usa/articleshow/128223730.cms,"Matthew Tkachuk, a star forward for the Florida Panthers, feels he's in peak form for his Olympic debut with Team USA against Latvia. Recovered from a significant injury that sidelined him for much of the NHL season, Tkachuk is eager to showcase his skills, aiming to help the U.S. secure its first Olympic gold medal in decades.





Matthew Tkachuk is at his best as the Panthers forward plays with Team USA against Latvia

As Team USA is all set to lock horns against Team Latvia at Milano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena on Thursday, NHL forward Matthew Tkachuk has declared that he is at his best form heading into his Olympic debut with Team USA against Latvia. The Florida Panthers star seems very confident about his preparations as he timed his recovery perfectly from a major injury.It is to be noted that the forward suffered from a major injury where he sustained a torn adductor muscle and sports hernia while playing for the United States in the 4 Nations Face-Off last season. He missed the final 25 games of the regular season. However, he returned Jan. 19 when the Panthers were seventh in the Atlantic Division and 12th in the Eastern Conference. Fortunately, the star forward managed to play 10 games before the Olympics and had eight points (three goals, five assists). Florida Panthers star forward Matthew Tkachuk said he feels in top form as he prepares to make his Olympic debut for the United States men's hockey team at the 2026 Winter Olympic Games in Milano Cortina, Italy.The player who underwent a tough surgery due to an injury that he sustained during the 4 Nations Face-Off, prompted the club to sideline him for much of the NHL season.Owing to this situation, he has struggled with uncertainty about his readiness early in the year. However, after returning to play for the Panthers and contributing in recent games, the 27-year-old admitted that he feels ""at my best"" and is ready to showcase his abilities against the world's top teams, as stated by NHL.com.""I'm at my best. I expect to be at my best, and there's no better time to show it off than now,"" Tkachuk stated very confidently about his game. As reported by the NHL, he was one of the first six players named to Team USA's Olympic roster. But the NHL player had to undergo a major surgery on August 22, for which he could not make it to the United States Men's Olympic Orientation Camp in Plymouth, Michigan.Head coach Mike Sullivan and Team USA officials see Tkachuk are seeing him as a key offensive and leadership presence. Sharing his concern for Tkachuk, Sullivan stated, ""I was very concerned, because he's a really important player for our team -- not only on the ice, but off the ice.""""In a lot of ways, he's one of the heart-and-soul guys that I think create the identity that we're trying to create with the group, and so he's such an important player for us on so many different levels. So, was I concerned throughout the course of the year? Of course,"" U.S. coach Mike Sullivan said.With Tkachuk's peak form, dedication, and self-confidence, Team USA is hoping for its first Olympic men’s hockey gold medal in decades, since its first Olympic men's hockey gold medal in 1980, and the first best-on-best title since the 1996 World Cup.","Matthew tkachuk, a star forward for the florida panthers, feels he's in peak form for his olympic debut with team usa against latvia.

Details of Corbin Carroll injury and recovery outlook

What Corbin Carroll absence means for Team USA and the Diamondbacks

The Arizona Diamondbacks star had his Team USA dreams for the 2026 World Baseball Classic go up in smoke following a major preseason hand injury. An injury this week during a batting practice session caused the closest outfielder to the team to break the hamate bone in his right hand, and the injury in its own right was enough to take him out of the tournament. Carroll was also regarded as a possible key American contributor.It is also a major blow to the Diamondbacks in the fight against the new Major League Baseball season. Carroll had the fracture surgically repaired, and it is too early to tell how long the recovery will take. Although the operation went well, the injury will endanger his appearance on Opening Day, prompting both his club and national team to reassess their respective plans.Carroll sustained the injury while taking live swings during preseason workouts, a staple in spring training prep. One of many fractures of the right hamate bone experienced by vertical baseball hitters after a swing at high speed, loading the hand. Despite the size of the bone, recovery can be tricky and take extensive rehabilitation to full strength.Medical personnel promptly assessed the damage and suggested an operation, which Carroll underwent the following day.You can expect players who incur this type of fracture to miss, on average, multiple weeks, and may still take time beyond that to recover full grip strength and bat speed. That timeline is why the Diamondbacks are bracing for the worst, their star outfielder missing at least a portion of the early regular season schedule.This coming at this time is absolutely disastrous for Carroll. He was coming off another outstanding season and was eager to play for his country in one of baseball's premier international events. Now it will be 100 percent healed and back on the field for Arizona.The loss of Carroll is big for Team USA with only weeks to go before the World Baseball Classic. Because of his speed, his defense, and his developing power, he was a natural for the tournament. His absence means the American roster will have to turn to alternatives in the outfield and adjust its lineup strategy leading up to the first games.It means just as much for the Diamondbacks. Carroll has rapidly emerged as the face of the franchise and one of the more electrifying young players in MLB. The bat and the legs made up the integral change-factor for Arizona's success in recent weeks, but that kind of production will be difficult to replicate.","Corbin carroll broke the hamate bone in his right hand during a batting practice session.

Tom Pelissero, Mike McCarthy, and DK Metcalf keep the door open for Aaron Rodgers to come back to Pittsburgh

Terry Bradshaw, Jeremy Fowler, and the Steelers’ staff add more smoke to the one-more-year rumors

Aaron Rodgers spent last summer telling the world he was “pretty sure” the 2025 season would be his last. One AFC North title later, the noise around a quiet exit has shifted to a much louder question about whether the 42-year-old is actually done.Rodgers helped the Pittsburgh Steelers go 10-7, win the division, and reach the playoffs before a 30-6 Wild Card loss to the Houston Texans. As of Feb. 11, 2026, he has not announced his plans and is set to hit free agency after playing 2025 on a one-year deal in Pittsburgh.The latest push for a reunion started on Super Bowl weekend. On NFL Network’s pregame show, insider Tom Pelissero said “the odds are increasing” that Rodgers returns to the Steelers for a second season and a 22nd year in the NFL, noting that the quarterback has spoken several times with new head coach Mike McCarthy and wide receiver DK Metcalf about his future.Pelissero added that “the plan is for Rodgers to take a little bit more time, and everyone hopes [he] comes to a decision prior to the start of free agency in mid-March,” and later said “at this point it would not be a surprise if Rodgers is back in Pittsburgh.” That matches what McCarthy has already said publicly.Introduced as the Steelers’ head coach on Jan. 27, McCarthy called Rodgers the best-case scenario at quarterback and did not hide that he wants him back.“Definitely. I don’t see why you wouldn’t,” McCarthy said, adding that he watched most of Pittsburgh’s games and “thought he was a great asset for the team.” Given their 13 years together with the Green Bay Packers and a shared Super Bowl win, the football fit is obvious if Rodgers wants one more run.The Rodgers talk has not been limited to national TV hits and press conferences. Steelers legend Terry Bradshaw told 103.7 The Buzz that he had heard Rodgers already sent a message before McCarthy’s hire became public: “If you want me to come back for a year, I’ll come back and join you.” Bradshaw did not clarify whether that “Mike” was Mike Tomlin or McCarthy, and he did not name his source, so it sits in the rumor bucket, but it lines up with the rest of the offseason chatter.ESPN’s Jeremy Fowler reported that Rodgers came out of his first year in Pittsburgh feeling “refreshed” and “in a much better place” than he was after his two seasons with the New York Jets, writing that he “greatly valued his experience in Pittsburgh” and that teammates “raved about him” in exit meetings. Fowler also noted that the Steelers have been open to a Rodgers return since early in the season.There is still a business side to all of this. Rodgers made just over $394.3 million in career earnings and played 2025 on a one-year contract with a $10 million base salary and incentives. As Pelissero put it, “If he’s gonna come back, they need to work out a contract.” With McCarthy in place, familiar assistants joining the offensive staff, and multiple voices publicly nudging him toward one more year, Pittsburgh looks ready.Now it comes back to Rodgers. He can run it back in black and gold for one last shot, or finally cash out on the “pretty sure” retirement he floated last June. Until he says it himself, everyone else is just trying to read the signs.","‘odds are increasing’: is aaron rodgers really about to run it back with the steelers in 2026?

Have Cardi B and Stefon Diggs broken up?

Cardi B, the 33-year-old Grammy-winning rapper, recently posted three snapshots from her Super Bowl LX moments on Instagram . None of them included New England Patriots star wide receiver Stefon Diggs. The first was a reel featuring all the celebrities who appeared in Bad Bunny’s Super Bowl LX halftime show.Cardi looked happy as she left the gridiron. She sang and danced on her way out. The next image showed her posing in her cameo ensemble, leaning over a royal table with a royal cabinet in the background. The last image showed her, in royal posture, calmly sitting on a sofa.The mom-of-four captioned the post: “We had a time at the game, honey! Then we took that energy back to the Airbnb for a whole photoshoot [nail polish emoji] Thank you @airbnb for always setting up me and the team up with the best stays while we’re on the road! [red heart emojis].”A source from Entertainment Tonight said the split happened “recently” when Diggs told reporters that an engagement was “on the agenda” after the Super Bowl. Breakup rumors surfaced on cyberspace when they both unfollowed each other after the Big Game [at the moment, only Cardi can see her followers, and Stefon has the same social media setting].The source said they could possibly get back together, and the split could be temporary.The mom-of-four is currently focused on her Little Miss Drama Tour and her family while figuring out their next steps.The NFL power couple launched their romance with an NBA courtside appearance in May 2025, welcomed a baby in November 2025, and engagement rumors began spreading online in early February. By mid-February [post-Super Bowl LX], their breakup was on everyone’s mind.In her current IG post, there was no sign of Diggs. Could this hint at their supposed post-Super Bowl breakup?
