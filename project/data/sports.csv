When hockey legend Wayne Gretzky first met Janet Jones , neither of them could have predicted that a chance encounter on a television set would grow into a lifelong love story. Today, the couple shares over three decades of marriage, five children, and a reputation as one of sports’ most enduring power couples.The pair first crossed paths in 1981 on the set of Dance Fever, where Wayne Gretzky was a celebrity guest judge and Jones a dancer. Though sparks didn’t fly right away, their story reignited six years later. In 1987, they ran into each other at a Los Angeles Lakers game — Wayne Gretzky with his friend Alan Thicke and Jones with a girlfriend. That night, the casual meet-up led to dinner and a conversation that revealed how similar their outlooks on life were.“We got along very well the first time we sat and actually chatted with each other,” Wayne Gretzky later recalled. “Mindset was very similar and our goals were the same in life. We started off that night where we were both on the same page. It makes life that much more simple.”Their whirlwind romance moved quickly. Gretzky proposed over the phone while Jones was away filming, and in July 1988, the couple married in Edmonton in what was famously described as a “wedding of royal proportions.”Thousands of fans lined the streets to witness the ceremony, and the event became a city-wide celebration.Family soon became the heart of their relationship. Their first daughter, Paulina, was born later that year, followed by four more children over the next 15 years. Despite busy careers — Gretzky rewriting hockey history and Jones pursuing acting — both prioritized raising their family. “Our goals were the same in life. Family was of number one importance,” Gretzky said.Also Read: Inside Sidney Crosby and Kathy Leutner’s private love story that has lasted more than 15 years From their early connection to their life as parents and grandparents, Gretzky and Jones have shown that the Great One’s greatest victory may well be found off the ice.","The pair first crossed paths in 1981 on the set of dance fever.

The photos showed her holding the fluffy pup close, planting gentle hugs, and sharing what looked like an afternoon of pure affection.Fans immediately recognized the tiny dog that has made recurring appearances in her posts over the past year. Earlier this summer, Bryant posted about the same pup after it accidentally smeared red lipstick across its fur, leading to a hilarious and heartwarming cleanup moment. Despite the mischief, Bryant couldn’t resist showing love, sealing the moment with another sweet kiss.It’s not the first time she’s shared glimpses of their bond. In a past post, she captured her pet sound asleep on her lap, writing, “Can’t move now,” proving that even a small dog can take over her heart— and her couch. The Bryant family has also been seen traveling with the little companion, with Natalia Bryant once posing with it during a walk through Central Park in New York City.Vanessa’s affection for her pets goes beyond the occasional social media post. Alongside her teacup pup, she’s also mom to a German Shepherd named Loki , who joined the family in early 2022. “My girls are happy,” she wrote at the time, sharing a photo with her daughters and their new “Big Boy.” Loki’s arrival helped fill the void left by Crucio, the beloved family dog who passed away just a month prior.""We love you, Crucio,"" she wrote in her farewell post. ""Thank you for everything sweet boy. Thank you for watching over us. We’re going to miss you. #GoodBoy #RestEasy.""Over the years, Vanessa Bryant has used her platform to share moments of love, family, and healing.

Alex Ovechkin’s journey to greatness and the woman who stands beside him

Anastasia Shubskaya’s life before marriage: modeling, film, and family legacy

Ovechkin family: legacy of love and sport

For years, the famed Washington Capitals captain Alex Ovechkin, now the all-time leading goal scorer of the NHL , has exerted his domination in the rink with power and laser-target precision. Behind his glories, there stands a woman who kept quietly weaving the other side of his world — that woman being Anastasia Shubskaya. Their love story is of perfect timing, of dedication, and of merged dreams, entwining sports, glamour, and family into one gifted tapestry.When, in April 2025, Alex Ovechkin came to surpass Wayne Gretzky's goal record, the hockey world cheered for the achievement and for the family who stood by his side with pride. Anastasia, as well as their two boys, Sergei and Ilya, were on the ice, amongst the cheering crowd, celebrating the man who had manifested greatness into a new vision.At the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, they met for the first time, exchanged numbers, and lost contact with each other in no time. Social media fever rekindled the flame of their old acquaintance into something far more serious over a few years. The couple finally tied the knot in a private ceremony in Russia in 2016, followed by a grand reception in Moscow.Together, they have continued to forge stronger and deeper connections through each personal and professional milestone.Long before becoming Mrs. Ovechkin, Anastasia named herself in Russia. She, daughter of Vera Glagoleva, late actress and director-had a film and culture-packed upbringing. Studying at the Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography in Moscow, she entered modeling as well as film production. She was admired for her grace and force of presence in the several films and fashion campaigns she appeared in-had she not been overtly associated with her famous family. Long before the story of Ovechkin came into the public gaze, she was an embodiment of charm and ambition.The family life of the Ovechkin family reflects those values shared by the parents perfectly. Their sons, Sergei and Ilya, are very popular among the fans and often accompany their father to games. The name Sergei is in memory of Alex’s late brother and shows the depth of the player's commitment to family and honor.Alex himself comes from the highest sporting traditions. His mother, Tatyana Ovechkina, is a two-time Olympic gold medalist in basketball, and his late father, Mikhail Ovechkin, was a professional soccer player. The number 8 on Ovechkin's jersey derives from his mother, and with every goal he scores, he keeps close to his heart the memory of his brother Sergey.Ovechkin has been seen back in full-contact practices with the Caps; this was a true indication that he is quite spot-on, armed up for the 2025–26 NHL season, translated to the full participation of the NHL for the coming season.The remarkable achievement of Alex Ovechkin is made possible through both his ability with hockey and the unwavering love and support of Anastasia Shubskaya. From as far back as her model and film days, right through to life as a devoted wife and mother, she has remained a silent yet indispensable factor in hockey's greatest tale — the heart behind the legend.Also Read: Scott Laughton injury update: Maple Leafs forward expected to miss weeks of action",Alex ovechkin is the all-time leading goal scorer of the nhl.

Is Xavier Worthy playing in Week 5 of Monday Night Football against the Jacksonville Jaguars?

“Kansas City Chiefs had a little sort of injury scare, I would say. Yesterday, Xavier Worthy popped up on the injury report with an ankle, along with his shoulder. My understanding is kind of just turned his ankle a little bit, woke up swollen. They put it on the report. He is fine. He is expected to go. More of a precaution than anything else. Worthy has been excellent since he returned, playing with that torn labrum.”

“I'm told that while the Chiefs have Xavier Worthy listed as questionable (shoulder/ankle), the expectation is he will be okay for MNF against the Jaguars. We'll see how his body feels tomorrow, but KC is hopeful he'll be able to go.”

Connor McDavid stays composed amid speculation

As the Edmonton Oilers prepare for the 2025-26 NHL season, all eyes are on their captain, Connor McDavid, who is entering the final year of his eight-year, $100 million contract. Despite his incredible impact on the franchise, McDavid’s future in Edmonton remains uncertain and according to NHL insider Darren Dreger, that uncertainty is starting to make the organization nervous.During a recent segment, Dreger revealed that Oilers owner Daryl Katz is becoming “a little antsy” as Connor McDavid continues to deliberate on his next move. While Darren Dreger clarified that there’s “no animosity” between McDavid and the front office, he admitted there’s growing unease within the organization about the lack of progress.“There's no animosity here,” Dreger explained. “Is there nervousness building? Sure, you know, I mean, Daryl Katz is probably getting a little antsy, the owner of the Edmonton Oilers. And then that message would be delivered to Jeff Jackson and on to Stan Bowman, the general manager.”Dreger noted that Edmonton is “ready to close whenever Connor is ready,” but the timeline remains entirely in Connor McDavid’s hands. He estimated the chances of an extension happening soon at “50-50” and suggested that any potential deal could be short-term, possibly just two years, a prospect that could unsettle both management and fans.While some worry about the distractions, NHL analyst Eddie Olczyk believes McDavid won’t let the situation affect his performance. “Well, I don't think it's going to hang over Connor McDavid because, just, he breathes different air,” Olczyk said. “I don't think it's going to affect him one bit.”Also Read: Edmonton Oilers reportedly exploring shocking reunion with 40-year-old Marc-Andre Fleury Since his debut in 2015, McDavid has consistently proven to be a generational player, leading Edmonton to consecutive Stanley Cup Final appearances and surpassing the 100-point mark eight times.

Travis Hunter’s development is still a major storyline for the Jaguars



Travis Hunter entered the NFL as one of the most hyped rookies in years. The Jacksonville Jaguars drafted him No. 2 overall in 2025 after he won the Heisman Trophy at Colorado, where he starred on both sides of the ball. But his NFL role so far has been limited, and his status heading into Monday Night Football against the Kansas City Chiefs is in question.Let’s see where things stand.Yes, Travis Hunter will be available for the Jaguars on Monday Night Football. Hunter is not listed on Jacksonville’s final Week 5 injury report, meaning he is cleared to play against the Chiefs.Through four games this season, Hunter has played 260 total snaps, 159 on offense at wide receiver and 101 on defense at cornerback. His impact has been uneven, with Pro Football Focus grading him higher on defense (69.6 overall) than offense (54.5 overall).The Jaguars have yet to give Hunter the same freedom he enjoyed at Colorado. Injuries to the secondary forced him into more defensive snaps in Weeks 2 and 3, while Week 4 saw him back on offense with a season-high 42 receiving yards against the San Francisco 49ers. Head coach Liam Coen has emphasized patience, saying Hunter is “very coachable” and still adjusting to the speed of the NFL.The Jaguars host the three-time defending AFC champions on Monday Night Football. Jacksonville is 3-1 and off to its best start since 2018, while Kansas City enters at 2-2 after back-to-back wins.Here’s everything you need to know:Patrick Mahomes leads the Chiefs after throwing four touchdowns in their Week 4 win over the Baltimore Ravens. On the other side, Trevor Lawrence and running back Travis Etienne aim to continue Jacksonville’s surprising rise under new coach Liam Coen.Hunter has shown flashes of the two-way talent that made him a national star in college, but the Jaguars have been cautious with his usage. Through four games, he has 13 catches for 118 yards on offense and 11 tackles with one pass breakup on defense.Pro Football Focus grades suggest he has been more effective in coverage than as a wideout, but Jacksonville continues to view him as a long-term weapon on both sides. For now, Hunter’s playing time is situational, dictated by injuries and matchups.His wife, Leanna Lenee, has also become a fan favorite in Jacksonville, building a strong social media following with gameday outfits and family updates. The couple married in May 2025 and welcomed their first child in August.Hunter’s journey is only beginning, and Monday night against Mahomes and the Chiefs gives him another chance to prove why he was one of the most coveted prospects in recent memory.","Travis hunter is not listed on jacksonville’s final week 5 injury report, meaning he is cleared to play against the chiefs.

Game Dynamics and Season Outlook

Thewill open their 2025-26 NBA preseason campaign on October 6, 2025, setting the tone for what promises to be an exciting season ahead. This matchup will be less about the scoreboard and more about assessing player fitness, lineup depth, and early chemistry among young prospects. With both teams managing significant absences due to injuries and rest strategies, the game will serve as an important checkpoint in evaluating each roster’s readiness before the regular season tips off.The Oklahoma City Thunder will approach their preseason opener with caution, prioritizing long-term health over short-term results. Head coach Mark Daigneault will rest several of his key contributors, including star guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, who will sit out for rest. Rising big man Chet Holmgren and defensive anchor Lu Dort will also be rested, along with newly acquired center Isaiah Hartenstein.Jalen Williams will continue to recover from wrist surgery and will not participate in the game. Rookie Ajay Mitchell will remain sidelined with an ankle sprain, while veteran Kenrich Williams will still be unavailable following knee surgery.In addition, young forward Thomas Sorber will continue his recovery from a torn ACL suffered during offseason training.On a positive note, Cason Wallace - who had previously rested in the last game - will be available to play. His return will be particularly significant, given his Dallas roots and strong fan following in the area.With a busy preseason schedule ahead, the Oklahoma City Thunder will carefully manage workloads to avoid unnecessary injuries. The coaching staff’s plan will focus on giving bench players and emerging prospects extended minutes to prove their worth. This developmental approach will align with Oklahoma City’s long-term goals, especially as they prepare for their championship ring ceremony and home opener later in October.The Dallas Mavericks will face their own set of challenges entering the preseason. Star guard Kyrie Irving will remain sidelined as he continues recovering from a left ACL tear sustained last season. Early projections indicate he could return by January 2026, leaving the team to adjust its offensive schemes in his absence.Center Daniel Gafford will also be unavailable due to a sprained ankle suffered during training camp and is expected to miss two to three weeks. Brandon Williams, meanwhile, will deal with a hamstring strain that could keep him questionable heading into the start of the regular season.Despite these setbacks, the Dallas Mavericks will receive a major boost with Anthony Davis expected to suit up. Davis, coming off eye surgery, will wear protective gear during games but is fully cleared for action. His return will inject leadership and defensive presence into the frontcourt, providing stability amid roster uncertainty.The Dallas Mavericks ’ preseason agenda will center around introducing new offensive structures under assistant coach Jay Triano and evaluating the progress of their younger players. Dereck Lively II and rookie sensation Cooper Flagg will both see significant minutes, while Ryan Nembhard will compete for a role in the backcourt rotation.

Key Trends



Heat games trending over totals; Bucks thrive on star offense





The 2025 NBA preseasonmatchup is shaping up to be an exciting contest with plenty of storylines for fans and bettors. Scheduled for Monday, October 6, 2025, at the Kaseya Center in Miami, the game will tip off at 7:30 p.m. EST. With revamped rosters and early-season chemistry on display, this game offers a valuable look at both teams’ readiness ahead of the regular season.The Milwaukee Bucks enter the 2025 preseason with a retooled lineup following a series of significant offseason moves. The team made headlines by waiving Damian Lillard, freeing up cap space to sign Myles Turner, Cole Anthony, and Gary Harris. Giannis Antetokounmpo remains the focal point of the franchise, expected to dominate both ends of the court. With Turner bolstering interior defense and floor spacing, the Bucks possess an enviable blend of depth and versatility, making them early favorites to impress during preseason play.On the other hand, the Miami Heat have reinforced their roster by acquiring Norman Powell and Simone Fontecchio, while also re-signing defensive specialist Davion Mitchell. However, Tyler Herro’s absence due to offseason surgery leaves a noticeable gap in Miami’s scoring arsenal. Head coach Erik Spoelstra’s squad continues to rely on its defensive discipline and structured rotations, anchored by Bam Adebayo and Nikola Jovic.Despite their strong defensive identity, the Heat have struggled to find rhythm offensively, as seen in their recent preseason loss to the Orlando Magic.Heading into the game, the Bucks remain 0-0 in the preseason, while the Heat stand at 0-1. Historically, the rivalry between these two Eastern Conference powerhouses has been closely contested. Out of 66 prior meetings, the Heat hold a narrow edge with 35 wins compared to Milwaukee’s 31. The most recent regular-season encounter took place on April 6, 2025, with Miami claiming a 121–115 victory in a high-scoring affair.The betting landscape slightly tilts in Milwaukee’s favor, thanks to their offensive firepower and depth. The spread is currently set at Miami Heat -2.5, with total points projected between 217 and 217.5. On the moneyline, the Bucks are listed as +125 underdogs, while the Heat are priced at -155 favorites. Miami’s home-court advantage and defensive prowess give them an edge in oddsmakers’ eyes, but Milwaukee’s efficient offense and tempo control make them an attractive pick.Predictions lean toward a Bucks win, with a projected final score of 105–98. Milwaukee’s pace and shot efficiency could prove decisive, especially if Giannis finds early success in the paint and transition.• Giannis Antetokounmpo Over Points: Giannis has surpassed the 29.5-point mark in his last six games, making the over on his points a strong play at roughly -109 odds.• Bam Adebayo Over Assists: Bam has recorded more than 4.5 assists in four of his last five games. At +110 odds, this bet holds solid value, considering Miami’s offensive structure often runs through him.• Total Points Over 215: Both teams have shown a tendency toward high-scoring outcomes. The Bucks’ up-tempo play combined with Miami’s quicker offensive adjustments makes the over (215) an enticing option with a 55–60% win probability.• Same Game Parlay: Bettors might consider combining Over 209.5 points, Heat +1.5 on the spread, and Giannis to score over 28.5 points for a well-rounded parlay option.The Bucks enter as narrow underdogs on the moneyline but may outperform expectations based on their offensive depth and overall balance. Miami’s defense and home-court comfort could keep things tight, making their -2.5 spread a viable choice for cautious bettors. Public betting trends show 74% of wagers leaning toward the Heat, reflecting faith in their defense despite recent struggles.Milwaukee’s revamped rotation - with added spacing from Turner and bench stability from Anthony and Harris - could prove pivotal in countering Miami’s aggressive half-court defense. The key battleground will be rebounding and transition efficiency, areas where Milwaukee has the clear upper hand.• Miami’s last five games have all gone over the total points line, indicating a shift toward faster-paced offense.• Milwaukee often thrives when Giannis dictates tempo, with outcomes heavily tied to his efficiency and free-throw performance.• The Heat’s 17–23 record against the spread on the road suggests bettors should approach Miami’s spreads with caution.• Keep tabs on live prop updates, as preseason minutes distribution can drastically alter player performance outcomes.Preseason contests are inherently unpredictable, but statistical and tactical indicators favor the Milwaukee Bucks in this matchup. The team’s improved roster depth and Giannis’ dominance give them the upper hand against a Miami side still adapting to lineup changes without Herro.Expect a competitive yet controlled game, where the Bucks’ offensive versatility proves decisive down the stretch. Bettors are advised to back the Bucks to win outright, consider the over on total points, and explore prop bets centered on Giannis Antetokounmpo’s scoring and Bam Adebayo’s playmaking. Miami could still cover the spread due to their defensive consistency, but Milwaukee’s momentum and superior depth make them the likelier victors.The 2025 Milwaukee Bucks vs Miami Heat preseason showdown promises an entertaining, analytics-driven contest that sets the tone for both teams’ regular-season ambitions. With star power, new faces, and tactical battles on display, fans can expect a thrilling early-season preview between two Eastern Conference contenders.","The 2025 nba preseasonmatchup is shaping up to be an exciting contest with plenty of storylines for fans and bettors.

Kansas City Chiefs star tight end Travis Kelce marked his 36th birthday on October 5 in style, with a heartfelt tribute from his mother Donna Kelce that shed light on his high-profile relationship with pop icon Taylor Swift . Donna shared a nostalgic baby photo of Travis on her Instagram Story, accompanied by a snippet of Taylor Swift’s new track “Opalite” from her latest album The Life of a Showgirl. The song, which Travis has called his favorite from the album, features lyrics that capture a hopeful new chapter in Taylor’s life, inspired by her relationship with the NFL star. Donna’s choice to pair the birthday message with “Opalite” was a clear nod to the couple’s bond.Earlier this year, during an August episode of New Heights, Travis confided to his brother Jason Kelce that “Opalite” stood out to him as his favorite song on Taylor’s 12th studio album, released just days before his birthday. “I always found myself dancing to it,” Travis admitted. The track’s lyrics reflect a new phase in Taylor’s life — moving past old relationships and embracing a fresh start with Travis. Lines like “But my mama told me, ‘It's alright,’ / You were dancing through the lightning strikes / Sleepless in the onyx night / But now, the sky is opalite” speak of the emotional depth behind the upbeat melody.Beyond “Opalite,” Taylor Swift’s latest release is packed with references to her relationship with the Chiefs’ tight end. Songs like “Wood” take a more fun, NSFW approach, while “The Fate of Ophelia” tells the story of how Travis helped Taylor escape a darker time in her life. Meanwhile, “Honey” offers a sweet glimpse into their personal pet names and affectionate moments. The album’s themes of renewal and love clearly resonate with fans, who have watched this high-profile NFL and music power couple grow closer over the past year.On Travis’s birthday, he joined Taylor at the “Official Release Party of a Showgirl,” held in theaters.

Type “NFL” on X, and the first post that appeared a few days ago was from an account named Giordano Bruno. The picture it carried was of Super Bowl 2026’s headliner, Bad Bunny , with the caption: “🏈 Dear NFL , Americans are sick of this crap 🤮.” What followed was a myriad of comments backlashing at the league for choosing him. One wrote, “Seriously, this is who you hire for a football game? @NFL. ” Another said, “I don't want to watch a man in a dress that sings in Spanish.” A third fan expressed, “So tired of this woke nonsense.” Now, what is the relation between the LGBTQ+ community and Bad Bunny? Let’s go back in time.In March 2020, John Paul King of Washington Blade reported that rapper Bad Bunny, known as a longtime LGBTQ ally, had never discussed his own sexuality until an interview with the LA Times. In that conversation, the Puerto Rican recording star said, “It does not define me. At the end of the day, I don’t know if in 10 years I will like a man. One never knows in life. But at the moment I am heterosexual and I like women.”Three years later, in October 2023, Michelle Ruiz of Vanity Fair interviewed Bad Bunny following accusations of “queerbaiting.” He had worn traditionally feminine clothes like skirts, kissed a male backup dancer, and performed in drag for his “Yo Perreo Sola” music video.Bad Bunny explained, “I get endless number of negative comments and sexist and homophobic ones, without being homosexual, for dressing like that. Maybe the queer person suffers more, but it is not like I put on a skirt and go out, and they say–Look how cool. They’re going to attack me either way. You don’t know the reasons why a person is wearing that. You weren’t in his mind when he decided to put on a skirt or a blouse. You don’t know what’s inside him, what’s in his heart.”Two years later, in September 2025, the National Football League announced Puerto Rican musician Bad Bunny as the headliner for the 2026 Super Bowl halftime show in Santa Clara. John Ferrannini, Assistant Editor for the San Francisco Bay Area LGBTQ community, reported the rapper stated in a release, “What I’m feeling goes beyond myself. This is for my people, my culture, and our history.”In September, Bernardo Sim, Out’s deputy editor, explored Bad Bunny’s popularity in the LGBTQ+ community. He highlighted how Bad Bunny has worked for years to challenge the “machista” archetype that dominated reggaeton as a musical genre for decades. Bad Bunny has been trying to help fight misogyny, racism, homophobia, and transphobia within the Latino community—an aspect that keeps getting lost among U.S. audiences.In February 2020, Stephen Daw of Billboard reported that Bad Bunny and Sech performed ""Ignorantes"" on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. The rapper made a statement with his shirt. Bunny was dressed in a long skirt and a large pink jacket, which he stripped away to reveal a white shirt that read: ""Mataron a Alexa, no un hombre con falda,"" which translates to: ""They killed Alexa, not a man in a skirt.""","The national football league announced puerto rican musician bad bunny as the headliner for the 2026 super bowl halftime show in santa clara.

Elliotte Friedman reveals Connor McDavid’s plan for the future of the Oilers

Can You Take the Cap Higher? | 32 Thoughts

Darren Dreger suggests 50-50 odds as the Oilers wait on McDavid’s move

The hockey world is spinning once again around Connor McDavid and the Edmonton Oilers, with contract talks heating up before a new NHL season. The buzzword of the present is clarity-words almost incessantly repeated by fans and insiders throughout the days. The captain of the Oilers, a man known for his loyalty and grit, now stands before a defining moment that will provide the very framework of his own life and the spirit of the franchise.NHL insider Elliotte Friedman sent Twitter into a frenzy when he declared that McDavid wants to bring ""clarity"" to the Oilers' situation before the puck drops this season. Friedman said, on the 32 Thoughts podcast, ""I do think that McDavid wants to give the Oilers clarity before the season begins by either signing or explaining why specifically he wouldn't sign.""McDavid is said to be very rational in his considerations, being in the last year of an eight-year deal thought to be worth $100 million. Friedman stated that centers of such caliber may find their decisions swayed by their allegiance to teammates such as Leon Draisaitl, Ryan Nugent-Hopkins, or Darnell Nurse. This trust might indeed push McDavid towards opting for a short-term extension, one that juggles his own aspirations against the team's cap realities.While discussing this player movement, TSN insider Darren Dreger added drama by stating that the circumstances surrounding McDavid's return to the Oilers were at 50-50. On the Barn Burner podcast, he said, ""If it happens, and I'm still 50-50 that it is going to happen.""Dreger stated that there is no friction between McDavid and the team, but that tension is starting to develop. Owner Daryl Katz is said to be ""getting a little antsy"" as McDavid weighs his options. Earlier during training camp, McDavid stated somewhat cautiously: ""We think about it, we talk about it... Gauge where we're at, what we're feeling. Nothing's really changed as of now, and just excited to be here."" Fans are gearing up for what is likely to be a suspenseful start to the season as this drama unfolds.As the big announcement draws nearer, fans eagerly devour every insider tidbit and wonder when the unveiling will finally happen. Whenever he signs, whether it's sooner or later for the perfect timing, the thing about this decision is it will forever shape McDavid's legacy, along with the Oilers' trajectory for another Stanley Cup run.Also Read: Inside the love story of Alex Ovechkin and Anastasia Shubskaya: How romance fueled a hockey icon","Connor mcdavid is in the last year of an eight-year deal thought to be worth $100 million.

In 2025, she retires after a significant win in her final match, and now many people discuss the substantial amount of money she earned throughout her career.Cecilia Braekhus has a net worth of approximately $ 5 million as of 2025, which primarily stems from her steady income from fights and endorsement deals with major brands throughout her long career in boxing.

On top of that, team-ups with brands like Nike brought in extra money and helped her savings grow bit by bit.Moreover, she earned substantial amounts from top fights, such as $250,000 when she faced Jessica McCaskill in 2020 and $200,000 against Victoria Bustos in 2019.

Comedian John Oliver jumped into the talk about the NFL picking Bad Bunny for the Super Bowl Halftime Show. Using his usual humor, he pushed back against Republicans who didn’t like the choice. The NFL announced Bad Bunny during the Cowboys vs. Packers game on September 28. Since then, some people have been upset about whether the Puerto Rican rapper, Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio, was the right pick — and Oliver wasn’t about to stay silent.On the October 5 broadcast of Last Week Tonight, Oliver first gave credit where it was due — to the NFL for making a bold pick. “The NFL controversially gave the Super Bowl Halftime show to one of the hottest, most commercially successful people alive,” he joked. He then pivoted to address commentary by figures such as Trump adviser Corey Lewandowski, who warned that ICE agents would be present during Bad Bunny’s performance. Oliver went beyond the music controversy and called out broader enforcement policies.“If ICE can show up and bother some guys at their roofing job, then bystanders should be able to bother ICE at their state‑sanctioned kidnapping job. It is only fair,” he said, adding, “And look, this administration is clearly still hell-bent on trying to intimidate communities with shows of force, which is why it is so important for them to be met with strong pushback each and every time.”Bad Bunny didn’t shy away from addressing the controversy. At the Season 51 premiere of Saturday Night Live, he poked fun at his critics and celebrated the opportunity. “I’m very happy, and I think everyone is happy about it, even Fox News,” he said, before the show cut to edited news clips reading: “Bad Bunny is my favorite musician. He should be the next president.” Acknowledging that not all viewers might understand every lyric, he quipped, “If you did not understand what I just said… You have four months to learn. ” He also used the platform to acknowledge the collective effort of Latino artists, saying, “Especially all of the Latinos and Latinas in the world here in the United States who have worked to open doors. It’s more than a win for myself, it’s a win for all of us. Our footprints and our contribution in this country, no one will ever be able to take that away or erase it.”In the end, Bad Bunny’s Super Bowl show isn’t just about entertainment — it’s also sparked a bigger debate about culture, identity, and who belongs in the spotlight.","The nfl announced bad bunny during the cowboys vs. packers game on september 28.
