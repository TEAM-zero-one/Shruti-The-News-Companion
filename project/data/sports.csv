Confirmation of Ahmedabad as the host city for the 2030 Commonwealth Games (CWG) has sounded the starting gun for an accelerated infrastructure race across the Ahmedabad-Gandhinagar belt. The Commonwealth Sport General Assembly’s approval on Wednesday has pushed the twin cities into delivery mode, with officials stressing that major venue construction plans are locked into a firm timeline.Speaking to the media in Glasgow after Ahmedabad won hosting rights, Gujarat principal secretary (sports, youth and cultural activities) Ashwani Kumar said that the city is poised to be the sports capital of India. “The construction of the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Sports Enclave (SVPSE) and the Police Academy Sports Hub will begin in April 2026 and finish by late 2028 or early 2029,” he said.He announced that funding for both these projects had been secured by the govt and that “most venues for the 2030 Games are ready”. He also said that the “organising committee will be constituted within a month”.Much of the Games’ footprint will be centred on the SVPSE — a purpose-built zone that will anchor Gujarat’s longterm sporting ecosystem.The enclave will house an arena, aquatic centre, tennis courts, training zones, and athlete villages. The Karai Police Academy complex will host athletics, shooting and other disciplines. For Gujarat, the CWG is as much about global visibility as about creating infrastructural and sporting capacity that endures beyond 2030.Unlike some sporting meets that span multiple states, the 2030 Games will be strikingly compact, concentrated almost entirely within the Ahmedabad-Gandhinagar cluster. That will enable faster movement and a lower carbon footprint. “This compactness cuts athlete travel time and allows seamless integration of metro, BRTS and electric mobility,” states the document, ‘Games Vision, Concept and Legacy — Commonwealth Games 2030’, presented before the CWG committee. Only two disciplines — cycling at the Statue of Unity (near Kevadia) and women’s cricket in Vadodara — will take place outside this hub.The Narendra Modi Stadium, the world’s largest cricket stadium, will host the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2030 Games — massive productions that are expected to reflect the Commonwealth Sport values.Beyond the Games, Gujarat — which hosted the National Games in 2022 — is pushing lesser-known disciplines like netball, lawn bowls, kabaddi, and yogasana into the spotlight. The bigger shift is strategic — Ahmedabad and Gandhinagar aim to become year round sports cities, with high performance labs, community spaces and university-linked infrastructure to ensure post Games utilisation.Ahmedabad also plans to discuss sustainability, diversity and inclusion during the Commonwealth heads of govt meeting (CHOGM) 2026 and 2028.Tejas Joshi, president of Credai Gujarat, said, “Hosting the CWG will be a game changer for Ahmedabad. The city’s infrastructure will see a drastic change with improved roads and connectivity. It will create demand for around 20,000 star-category hotel rooms and boost hotel and retail development. It will also eventually bring new migration to the city, resulting in increased housing demand.”Accommodation is expanding fast. “Ahmedabad and Gandhinagar offer 5,420 hotel rooms in the 3-5 star range, with 3,000 more planned, including 1,500 new 5-star rooms. Upgraded university hostels will house athletes during the Games and serve students later,” states the proposal.Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International (SVPI) airport, handling 13.4 million passengers annually, will add a new terminal by 2026 to double its capacity and introduce e-gates and kiosks.“World-class sports academies will be set up, encouraging a sports culture among city youths. After the Commonwealth Games, Ahmedabad aims to host the 2036 Olympics. The next decade will bring historic developments to the city,” said Joshi.Behind the scenes, athlete development is accelerating. Gujarat’s sports budget has grown from Rs 2.5 crore to Rs 521 crore over two decades, strengthening long-term athlete development pathways and strengthening academies. Part of the focus is also on scaling up talent hunts like Khel Mahakumbh, which saw engagement from 7 million participants, and schemes such as Shaktidoot to support athletes.Public participation will also be a defining layer. Programmes like Active Gujarat will convert riverfronts and parks into fitness zones. At the same time, Sabarmati Sundays — weekly openstreet events — will be expanded in the run-up to 2030. College students will join as youth ambassadors through the National Service Scheme (NSS) and the National Cadet Corps (NCC). By 2030, Gujarat plans to train 10,000 volunteers and create over 30,000 jobs linked to the Games.","Ahmedabad has been confirmed as the host city for the 2030 commonwealth games.

'Biggest fault is your ...

Gautam Gambhir fiery press conference: On whitewash, Rishabh Pant shot, pitch and more

NEW DELHI: Former India spinner Harbhajan Singh did not hold back after India slipped to their second home Test series defeat against South Africa. He said that if Indian cricket wants to protect its “future generations”, the team management must rethink its approach to home pitches and move away from heavily spin-assisted surfaces that previously helped them dominate for over a decade — a run that ended when New Zealand handed India a whitewash last year.Speaking on his YouTube channel, Harbhajan criticised the current standards of Test preparation, saying Indian players have forgotten how to compete over five days because of surfaces that consistently produce two- or three-day matches. He added that the nature of these pitches contributed to declining batting numbers for stars like Virat Kohli Cheteshwar Pujara and Ajinkya Rahane, eventually leading to their exit from the Test setup.""We do not know how to play matches for five days. We have got so used to playing so many matches on wickets where matches last for two-three days... Nowadays, it has reduced averages of our batters like Virat Kohli, Pujara, Rahane to 35-40 from 50... Our old greats were greats because they knew how to play five days of Test match cricket.""He urged Indian cricket to move on from its past and prioritise better pitches over favourable results.""For the betterment of Indian cricket, I think they should forget what has happened in the last 10 to 12 years... start playing on better wickets to save the future generation of Indian cricket.""Harbhajan added that Test cricket demands patience and discipline — qualities he feels have faded due to recent conditions.""The kind of temperament needed to play Test cricket requires effort, hard work, discipline, and I feel that for many years this has been missing.""He further argued that good wickets produce fair contests and reveal the true winner over the full duration of a match.""But what happens on a good wicket? A good wicket makes the game last five days... This lottery type situation, earlier New Zealand got lucky, now South Africa got lucky...""Harbhajan also analysed India’s performance in Guwahati, where the pitch appeared fair and the match reached the final day — yet India collapsed twice.""South Africa won the toss on this pitch and made 489... And then in the second innings, Team India collapsed for 140... So this is not just the fault of the pitch. I feel the biggest fault is your temperament.""South Africa dominated the Test through strong batting contributions led by Senuran Muthusamy’s maiden century and Marco Jansen’s explosive 93. Jansen, who also took 6/48 in the first innings, dismantled India’s batting order before Simon Harmer completed the rout with a match-winning 6/37 in the second innings. Ravindra Jadeja’s fifty and Sai Sudarshan’s gritty 139-ball vigil were among the few bright moments in a forgettable chase of 549.South Africa sealed a commanding 408-run win, with Harmer finishing as Player of the Series for his 17 wickets across two Tests, while Jansen claimed the Player of the Match award for his all-round brilliance.","Former india spinner harbhajan singh criticised the current standards of test preparation.

Ilia Topuria steps back as Justin Gaethje and Paddy Pimblett wait for next move

UFC lightweight champion Ilia Topuria said he will not fight in the first quarter of 2026. He shared this in a short statement on social media. He said he is going through a “hard moment” in his personal life and wants to spend time with his children. Ilia Topuria said he needs to fix things at home first before he can fight again. He also said he does not want to “hold up the division,” so the UFC can book other fighters while he takes a break.This news is big for fans because Ilia Topuria is one of UFC’s biggest stars right now. He is the lightweight champion after beating Charles Oliveira with a first-round knockout at UFC 317 in June 2025. He also won two belts in two different weight classes. Many fighters were hoping to face him soon, but now they will have to wait until at least April 2026.Ilia Topuria had a huge last two years. He beat Max Holloway and Alexander Volkanovski in 2024 in featherweight title fights. Then he moved up to lightweight and planned to fight Islam Makhachev. But Islam Makhachev moved up to welterweight, so Ilia Topuria fought Charles Oliveira instead and won the lightweight belt.Now Ilia Topuria is the No. 2 fighter in the Pound-for-Pound list. Only Islam Makhachev is above him. Even with all this success, Ilia Topuria says he needs time for his family. He said that when everything is okay, he will tell the UFC he is ready to come back.This break changes things in the lightweight division. Justin Gaethje and Paddy Pimblett, who both want a title shot, will now need to wait. UFC may book new fights or even an interim title while Ilia Topuria is away. Fans are also curious because Max Holloway posted a message showing support for Ilia Topuria.For now, Ilia Topuria is taking time for his kids and his personal life.

Pros, Cons, and Overall Winner

Talk around the league has escalated as theare increasingly positioned as a potential landing spot for Milwaukee Bucks superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo . With the franchise eyeing a future built around Luka Dončić , the possibility of pairing him with another generational MVP has created a wave of speculation across NBA circles.This momentum is driven by recent indications that the Lakers are exploring aggressive paths to remain contenders beyond the LeBron James era. Reports suggest they are more willing than ever to make short-term sacrifices if it means strengthening their core around Dončić, who continues to perform at an MVP level.Among the most detailed proposals is a five-team structure that envisions the Lakers acquiring Giannis along with Olivier-Maxence Prosper from Dallas and Tyrese Martin from Brooklyn. In this scenario, LeBron James heads to Dallas, Brooklyn gains Dalton Knecht, and Los Angeles sends Milwaukee a haul of wings - RJ Barrett, PJ Washington, Caleb Martin, and Naji Marshall - along with extensive draft control. The Bucks’ return would include swap rights in 2026, 2028, 2030, and 2032, plus a 2031 first-round pick. Meanwhile, the Raptors and Nets secure young pieces and trade exceptions to reshape their flexibility.Alternate proposals maintain the same intention but reduce the complexity. One such idea involves the Lakers sending LeBron, Austin Reaves, and two first-rounders directly to Milwaukee in exchange for Giannis and Kyle Kuzma. These frameworks prioritize Milwaukee’s need for draft capital and young talent rather than retaining an aging LeBron.For the Lakers, landing a 30-year-old superstar in his prime alongside a 26-year-old Dončić offers a pathway to multiple championship runs. Their recent head-to-head battles - highlighted by Dončić’s 41-point performance in a dominant win - underscore the potential of their combined offensive strength.Milwaukee, on the other hand, would gain assets to address the team’s drop-off when Giannis is off the floor. Their pursuit of additional scorers such as Zach LaVine and Anfernee Simons shows a desire to rebalance the roster, and a major trade could accelerate a full-scale retool.Dallas would reload instantly with LeBron’s leadership beside rising talent. Brooklyn and Toronto would walk away with young guards like Knecht and Hardy, plus valuable exceptions.The Lakers benefit from a potential dynasty-forming duo capable of combining for over 65 points per game while boosting the league’s global appeal. The Bucks secure valuable rebuilding tools but risk alienating fans by moving their franchise icon. The complexity of multi-team negotiations and Knicks-related timing issues remain hurdles.Also read: NBA trade rumors: Golden State Warriors could chase $54.2 million Dallas Mavericks superstar in blockbuster 3-team trade to fix center depth If such a scenario were to play out, the Lakers emerge with the clearest long-term upside, while Milwaukee transitions into a new era fueled by assets and flexibility.","The lakers are increasingly positioned as a potential landing spot for milwaukee bucks superstar giannis antetokounmpo.

At 36, his clutch plays and football IQ demonstrate a level of play that suggests years of elite contribution remain. His strategic approach to career decisions, coupled with his on-field indispensability, makes him a vital asset, regardless of this season's outcome.

Taylor Swift Reveals Favorite Track, Talks Travis Kelce And New Album “The Life Of A Showgirl”

Travis Kelce’s performance sends a message about longevity and leadership

For months, the talk around Travis Kelce has been less about catches and more about calendars, specifically whether this season would mark the final chapter of his storied NFL career. But on Thanksgiving night, under the bright lights of AT&T Stadium, the 36-year-old tight end delivered the kind of performance that didn’t just help the Kansas City Chiefs turn a game around, it shifted the conversation entirely.As fans scanned the stadium for his fiancée Taylor Swift, Kelce was busy doing what he has always done best: making clutch plays, boosting Patrick Mahomes , and reminding everyone that elite football IQ and relentless competitiveness age differently than the rest of the body. His game wasn’t just productive, it was defiant.Kelce’s first-half touchdown was the spark Kansas City desperately needed after trailing Dallas early. His two-yard score wasn’t flashy, but it was one of those emblematic “Kelce plays”, perfect timing, sharp awareness, and total trust from Mahomes. His second big moment, a 22-yard reception in Q2, further showcased that while defenses might be younger and faster, they still haven’t decoded how to neutralize Kelce’s intuition.Fans and analysts recognized it too. Chiefs insider Pete Sweeney posted: “I think we all came into this season thinking that this would for sure be Travis Kelce's last season, but he's been playing like he has year(s) left.” Another fan wrote: “Travis Kelce playing this great at 36 years old isn’t being talked about enough.His longevity isn’t appreciated enough.”Those words matter, but Kelce himself has been clear that career decisions won’t be emotional. They’ll be strategic. Reflecting on retirement talk earlier this year, he explained: “You know, seeing my brother go through it … I want to give the Chiefs a good opportunity to know whether I come back or not.”Kelce’s $34.25 million contract and locker-room legacy give him leverage, but Thursday’s game gave him something else: proof that he’s still indispensable. Whether or not this is his final season, one truth is undeniable, the Chiefs aren’t just better with Kelce on the field; they’re sharper, calmer, and more dangerous. If this was meant to be a farewell tour, Kelce is performing like someone who isn’t ready to leave the stage just yet.Also Read: Taylor Swift’s Eras docuseries faces fan backlash as Travis Kelce’s presence takes center stage","Travis kelce's stellar thanksgiving performance has silenced retirement speculation.

Fuzzy Zoeller’s cause of death

Fuzzy Zoeller’s legacy at a glance



Fuzzy Zoeller, one of golf’s most familiar and charismatic figures, has died at 74, leaving the sport reflecting on a career defined by talent, humor, and moments that shaped his legacy. The two-time major champion, who won both the Masters and U.S. Open, remained a recognizable presence long after his final competitive rounds. News of his death surfaced Thursday, with tributes pouring in from across the golf world, though the cause has not yet been disclosed.Zoeller’s passing has sparked an outpouring of emotion from fellow players, fans, and prominent figures who remembered him for both his achievements and the joy he brought to the game. His death marks the end of an era for a golfer whose personality once drew galleries as much as his skill.Details surrounding Fuzzy Zoeller’s cause of death have not been released, but the news was confirmed after his daughter informed Brian Naugle, tournament director of the Insperity Invitational.His death also prompted immediate tributes from influential names. “Very sad to hear that the highly respected and beloved Professional Golfer, Fuzzy Zoeller, has passed away,” President Donald Trump wrote, adding, “A truly remarkable person and player, he will be missed!”The PGA Tour Commissioner Jay Monahan said, “Fuzzy was a true original whose talent and charisma left an indelible mark on the game of golf.”Monahan highlighted Zoeller’s mix of competitive fire and humor, a combination that helped define his appeal.Zoeller built a distinguished résumé with 10 PGA Tour wins, including the 1979 Masters, where he became the last golfer to win the event on his first attempt, and the 1984 U.S. Open at Winged Foot. His playoff victory over Greg Norman remains one of the championship’s signature moments. Beyond the majors, he collected wins around the world and represented the United States in three Ryder Cups.Yet his career also carried a lasting controversy. During the 1997 Masters, Zoeller made racially insensitive remarks about Tiger Woods’ future Champions Dinner menu. Though he apologized repeatedly, the comments sparked a backlash that followed him for years. “I’ve cried many times. I’ve apologized countless times for words said in jest that just aren’t a reflection of who I am,” he later reflected. “Still, I’ve come to terms with the fact that this incident will never, ever go away. ”Fuzzy Zoeller’s legacy stretches far beyond scorecards. Born Frank Urban Zoeller Jr. in New Albany, Indiana, he rose from a standout high school athlete to a national champion at the University of Houston before turning pro in 1973. His Masters and U.S. Open triumphs cemented his place among the sport’s elite, while his easygoing personality made him a fan favorite.Zoeller also found success later in life on the PGA Tour Champions, winning the Senior PGA Championship in 2002. He finished his career with 19 global victories and left behind moments that remain etched in golf history.Zoeller is survived by his three children. His wife, Diane, died in 2021.Also Read: Who was Fuzzy Zoeller?

Bukayo Saka chooses luxury London hotel for heartfelt proposal



Bukayo Saka balances personal milestone with standout season for Arsenal



Bukayo Saka has stepped into a new chapter off the pitch, marking a major personal milestone after proposing to his longtime girlfriend, Tolami Benson, during a private evening at one of London’s premier hotels. The couple, both 24, have been together since 2020 and have kept their relationship mostly away from public view, choosing to share only selective glimpses over the years. Their engagement follows a stretch of standout performances for both club and country, adding a meaningful moment to an already defining period in Saka’s life.While the football world has grown used to seeing Saka deliver big performances for Arsenal and England, this moment unfolded far from stadium lights. The evening was described as intimate and meticulously planned, setting the tone for a proposal that insiders say left Tolami “totally blown away.” Their engagement now ties together a relationship that has quietly strengthened in the background while Saka’s career surged to new heights.The proposal came during what sources described as a “special night” inside a top London hotel. One insider said, “Bukayo went all out for the proposal – and the ring he chose is absolutely enormous.He’d organised a special night at a top London hotel and proposed there. It was incredibly special and Tolami was totally blown away” (via The Sun).The evening capped a five-year relationship that began privately before becoming publicly known during the 2022 World Cup, when Tolami was seen supporting Saka alongside the partners of other England players.Tolami later made appearances during Euro 2024, where she wore a jacket marked with the number 87, a nod to Saka’s first Arsenal squad number. The pair also shared a pitchside kiss after England’s draw with Slovenia in June, offering a rare look into their usually discreet dynamic. Tolami, who is originally from Hatfield, studied Public Relations and Media at Birmingham University and now works as a senior planning executive in London.Saka’s engagement arrives during a strong run of form for Arsenal, who sit atop both the Premier League and Champions League tables. He recently helped the Gunners defeat Bayern Munich, continuing a season where he has delivered goals, assists, and leadership, even wearing the captain’s armband in Martin Odegaard’s absence.With his personal and professional life aligning in a year full of milestones, Saka now looks ahead to Arsenal’s upcoming Premier League clash with Chelsea. Tolami, like always, will be by his side.Also Read: Fuzzy Zoeller's cause of death: Golf legend and two-time major winner dies at age 74","Bukayo saka proposes to girlfriend tolami benson at top london hotel.

Lamar Jackson’s Week 13 injury status and what it actually means for Baltimore

How to watch Ravens vs. Bengals on Thanksgiving (Week 13)

Date: Thursday, Nov. 27



Kickoff: 8:20 p.m. ET



Matchup: Cincinnati Bengals (3-8) at Baltimore Ravens (6-5)



Location: M&T Bank Stadium, Baltimore, Md.



Broadcast: NBC



Streaming: Peacock



Lamar Jackson walked into Week 13 with more questions than usual. The Baltimore Ravens quarterback has dealt with a hamstring strain, knee soreness, ankle issues, and now a toe injury that briefly stalled his practice week. It is the most physically taxing stretch of his eight-year career, and his play has reflected it.He is still expected to start on Thanksgiving night against the Cincinnati Bengals, but the conversation has shifted from availability to whether Jackson can look anything like the quarterback who once dragged Baltimore through games with speed and power. Even the Ravens know he is not moving the same. “God, he got me right there,” Jackson said earlier this week when asked about a hit from Dallas Turner that left him grabbing his lower back.Jackson is officially off the injury report. He practiced fully after sitting out Monday’s walkthrough with a toe issue. That checkmark looks good on paper, but nothing about his recent play looks fully comfortable.Baltimore has won five straight, but Jackson has been held under 200 passing yards for three consecutive games and has not scored in two straight. He is taking more hits, getting the ball out faster than any season of his career, and showing reluctance to run.His longest carry since returning from the hamstring injury is 17 yards. For context, last December he hit 21.25 miles per hour on a 48-yard touchdown run. This year, his top speed is 19.39.The Ravens will not publicly blame the injuries, but the numbers tell on him. His pressure rate is at 35.6 percent, which is on pace to be the highest of his career. He has been sacked 24 times in eight starts, already surpassing last season’s total. Even Patrick Ricard admitted “he’s a tough guy” and that the team will take Jackson even at “50%.”The matchup only raises the stakes. Joe Burrow is returning from turf toe surgery two weeks earlier than expected, and Cincinnati is treating this like a last stand. The Bengals have lost eight of their past nine, but Burrow’s presence always shifts the tone of the rivalry. Baltimore knows it. Zay Flowers said, “They got their quarterback back, so there probably won't be any more excuses.”Jackson has dominated Burrow historically with a 6-1 record, but that version of Jackson was healthier and more explosive. If Baltimore wants to keep control of the AFC North, they need something closer to that player tonight, not the slowed version from the past three weeks.If Jackson is healthy enough to move, Baltimore can control the game. If he is not, the Ravens will need the cleanest defensive performance of their season to hold off a Burrow return that Cincinnati has treated like a movie premiere. The Ravens have been first in the division for only a few days. They cannot afford a regression night now.","Lamar jackson is officially off the injury report.

Why Brand Luukkonen, Andrei Svechnikov, and more are driving this week’s NHL rumors



LUUUUUUUUK! Ukko-Pekka Luukkonen Highlights From 2024-25 Buffalo Sabres Season

The NHL rumor mill is again generating a lot of speculation around a few of the more persistent players. The Montreal Canadiens are looking for a solution in-goal, plus some of their other issues, such as Andrei Svechnikov's situation and Brad Lambert's contract, are making insiders quite interested and keeping them posted about several situations, depending on how these teams decide to evaluate their depth and long-term plans. Reports this week from Sportsnet, TSN, and The Athletic have ignited a debate throughout the league, and just about everyone has a theory about what might happen.The Canadiens’ campaign has been a tumultuous one, and the poor quality of their goaltending has not been a great help. The offense’s inconsistent performances have indeed made the discussions about a possible upgrade in the goal area servicing the team more and more. On the other hand, the situation in Carolina regarding Svechnikov's ice-time at the beginning of the season has taken an unpredictable turn, while on the other side of the league, Lambert’s name keeps coming up as the Jets contemplate their next step.According to Sportsnet’s Elliotte Friedman, the Montreal Canadiens have been very interested in the Central Predator thought to be the celebrity goalie of the moment - Ukko-Pekka Luukkonen, whose name has been going around the rumor mill after he had a slow start and an early-season injury.Although the young Finnish goalie has a contract through 2028–29 with a $4.75 million cap hit and has a five-team no-trade clause, Friedman pointed out that the Habs are considering each and every option out there. But on the other hand, Buffalo is not ready to be quite clear in its reluctance—the Sabres won’t risk losing their call-up goalie, Colten Ellis, on waivers, which rules out the possibility of trading Luukkonen for now.From Carolina's side, earlier this week, TSN's insider reports indicated that Andrei Svechnikov was not happy with his limited ice time, but now the scenario seems less tense. Svechnikov said to the media that the gossip was “not true,” while coach Rod Brind’Amour swayed over the player’s endorsement of his top-line role, which he traced back to an uptick in the forward’s performance since October.In Winnipeg, The Athletic’s Murat Ates has reported that Brad Lambert has been granted permission to hold talks with interested teams, but GM Kevin Cheveldayoff is not in a hurry to trade. The Jets have the upper hand as they can keep Lambert, who is waiver-exempt until next season and will only let him go if they get something significant in return—possibly along with a draft pick right before the March 6 deadline.Things are still shifting in all three cases; nevertheless, the insiders are in agreement: Montreal, Carolina, and Winnipeg are near each other with very important decisions on the trade talks.Also Read: NHL Trade Rumors: Vancouver Canucks considering trades as Montreal Canadiens show interest in Ryan O’Reilly","Ukko-pekka luukkonen, andrei svechnikov, and more are driving this week’s nhl rumors.

Trevon Diggs and the Dallas Cowboys explain his return timeline

Trevon Diggs has been away from the Dallas Cowboys for several weeks, and fans want to know when he will return. Trevon Diggs has missed games because of a concussion he suffered in an at-home accident, not during a game. The accident happened earlier in the season in Dallas, and the team has still not said exactly how it happened. Along with the concussion, Trevon Diggs has also been dealing with a knee issue, which made things even harder for him.Because of his injuries, Trevor Diggs was placed on Injured Reserve by the Dallas Cowboys, hence missing at least four games as per NFL rules. Though he was qualified to return this week, the Dallas Cowboys did not activate him, therefore, he would miss a fifth straight game. Many supporters are worried about his time outside as his comeback is yet uncertain.Trevon Diggs can be activated from Injured Reserve at any time, but the Dallas Cowboys did not take that step this week.They also did not designate him to return, meaning the earliest he can play is Week 14, and even that is not guaranteed.Once the team gives him the “return from IR” tag, the Cowboys will have 21 days to activate him, so his comeback could still take weeks after that.Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones tried to calm concerns when he spoke to reporters in Dallas.When asked if Trevon Diggs will return this season, Jerry Jones said, “Why not? Yes. Why not?” He added that the team will wait to see how Trevon Diggs heals and that the cornerback is “physically there in full shape for us.”His words show hope, but also remind fans that Trevon Diggs needs time. There has been good news at practice.Trevon Diggs has been working with the Cowboys’ rehab group during sessions in Frisco, Texas, which means he is moving closer to playing again.Coaches said the rehab work is a good sign, but they want to avoid rushing him because of his injury history over the last few years.The Dallas Cowboys also know Trevon Diggs’ long-term future is unclear. His contract has an option the team can use after this season, and many reports in Dallas suggest they may use it.For now, the team’s main focus is getting him healthy, one step at a time, as they wait to see when he can return to the field.Also Read: Is Drake London Playing In Week 13 Vs The Jets?

Golden State Warriors face tough moment as Stephen Curry’s health scare puts pressure on the team

Stephen Curry’s injury leaves Golden State Warriors with uncertain future

After limping off the floor following Wednesday's 104-100 NBA Cup loss to the Houston Rockets, Golden State Warriors star Stephen Curry is scheduled for an MRI. According to the Warriors, the problem is a contusion involving the right quad area.When Curry hobbled out of the field late in the fourth quarter, the Warriors announced an MRI would be performed on Curry later on to determine the severity of the problem. Although he struggled with his shot and turned the ball over, he still managed 14 points, six rebounds, and five assists.Due to a right quad contusion, Golden State Warriors star Stephen Curry departed Wednesday's game against the Houston Rockets, raising questions about his availability for the team's next game. The head coach of the Warriors found the news to be promising when he spoke to the media following the defeat. He said:“When I heard it was a quad, I was actually relieved… Better than an ankle or a knee. So, hopefully he can recover quickly and be okay, but we gotta hold down the fort..”Throughout the game, Curry was involved in multiple severe collisions. Earlier in the game, Houston center Alperen Şengün left Curry startled with a hard screen, while Rockets star Amen Thompson downed the four-time NBA champion with a shoulder on a drive to the basket in the fourth quarter.Eventually, Curry limped to the locker room with noticeable trouble after departing the bench with 35 seconds remaining in the game.He finished with 14 points, six rebounds, five assists, and seven turnovers in 33 minutes.Rookie Will Richard told reporters:“That's a challenge, if Steph is out everybody else has to kind of improve their game a lot to fill that void..”However, veteran Jimmy Butler said that ""it's just sad"" to see the club disregard their strategy in Curry's absence. He also urged his teammates to ""care more"" about the little things. Butler stated to reporters:“What will change the most? I think we're going to have to be damn near perfect.. We ain't going to have the ultimate bailout on our team, but even when he is on the floor we're going to have to do our job because we make the game real difficult…”He went on to say that even though Curry was a fantastic basketball player, he had a very demanding job every day.During the fourth quarter of the 104-100 loss to the Houston Rockets on Wednesday in San Francisco, Curry suffered injuries from two incidents. The 10-10 Warriors, who have lost four out of the past five games, will host the New Orleans Pelicans on Saturday.Curry's exact return date is not known and will be based on the MRI results. This year, Golden State is only 1-3 without Curry and has the 22nd-rated offense because of the struggles they’ve faced on offense.When the Warriors line up against the New Orleans Pelicans on Saturday, off guard Brandin Podziemski is expected to see increased play action if Curry is out. On the other hand, Curry is putting up 27.9 points, 4.0 assists, and 3.7 rebounds in 16 games started so far this year.Also read: Stephen Curry hints at reason for wearing Sabrina Ionescu’s Nike sneakers in Golden State Warriors–Utah Jazz clash","Golden state warriors face tough moment as stephen curry’s health scare puts pressure on the team.

Fuzzy Zoeller has died at the age of 74, as confirmed by Sky Sports and the USGA. Zoeller was one of golf’s most well-known players.

He also won the 1984 U.S. Open.Fans knew him for his happy personality, fast play, and funny moments on the golf course.

But Norman had not won yet, and Zoeller came back the next day to win in an 18-hole playoff.Fuzzy Zoeller’s career had great wins, but he also faced a big problem in 1997 when he made a hurtful comment about Tiger Woods during the Masters. He later said sorry and called it “the worst thing I’ve gone through in my life,” as written in Golf Digest.Fuzzy Zoeller was born Frank Urban Zoeller Jr. in New Albany, Indiana.

Sky Sports wrote that he was the last Masters rookie to ever win the event.In the 1984 U.S. Open at Winged Foot, Zoeller thought Greg Norman had made a birdie, so he waved a white towel.

The Kansas City Chiefs will head into Thanksgiving down tight end Noah Gray. The team ruled him out for Week 13 as he remains in the concussion protocol, according to reporting from Nate Taylor and RotoWire. He did not practice on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday, and the short week left no path for clearance.The timing matters. Kansas City visits the Dallas Cowboys on Thursday at 4:30 p.m. ET in one of the most-watched regular season windows each year. The Chiefs need every weapon they can get to stabilize a 6-5 season that has tightened their playoff margin. Losing Gray strains a position that already funnels most of its work through Travis Kelce.Gray has operated as Kansas City’s second tight end all season and plays a steady role in Patrick Mahomes ’ intermediate structure. With Gray sidelined, the Chiefs will turn to Robert Tonyan and Jared Wiley for snaps behind Kelce. That depth shift matters more than usual on a short week, especially against a Dallas defense that leans on pressure and tight man coverage.The team also ruled out All-Pro guard Trey Smith and corner Christian Roland-Wallace.That leaves Kansas City thin on the interior line and in the slot, adding pressure to compensate with clean timing routes and reliable secondary targets. The Chiefs still expect Kelce, Rashee Rice, Xavier Worthy, and Isiah Pacheco available, but losing Gray affects how flexible their personnel packages can be.Gray’s next opportunity to return arrives on Dec. 7 against Houston, per RotoWire’s reporting.The Kansas City Chiefs face the Dallas Cowboys at 4:30 p.m. ET on Thursday, Nov. 27, 2025, inside AT&T Stadium. The game airs on CBS with Jim Nantz, Tony Romo, and Tracy Wolfson on the call. Viewers can stream the matchup on NFL+, with access available through the Apple App Store and Google Play. Here's the NFL schedule for Thanksgiving Dallas enters the holiday at 5-5-1, while Kansas City arrives at 6-5 after back-to-back wins over Indianapolis and Philadelphia. This is one of the biggest windows of the regular season and traditionally draws massive numbers, which is why the broadcast and streaming schedule is loaded across platforms. Those outside the CBS viewing area can also access the game through Paramount+ and YouTube TV’s Sunday Ticket, depending on regional availability.","Noah gray ruled out for the chiefs’ thanksgiving game as he remains in the concussion protocol.
