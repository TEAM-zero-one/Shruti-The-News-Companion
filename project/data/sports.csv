T20 World Cup: India humiliate Pakistan again

Former Pakistan captain Shahid Afridi launched a scathing attack on the senior core of the Pakistan national cricket team after their crushing 61-run defeat to India national cricket team in the ICC Men's T20 World Cup at R Premadasa Stadium.Led by Suryakumar Yadav , India dominated the Group A clash on Sunday, handing Pakistan a heavy blow and leaving them in a must-win situation against Namibia to have any chance of reaching the Super 8s.Afridi, speaking on Samaa TV, did not hold back and urged the team management to make bold calls ahead of the crucial fixture. He called for the exclusion of senior players including Babar Azam , Shadab Khan and Shaheen Shah Afridi, stating that they had been given ample opportunities over the years without delivering consistent results. Notably, Shaheen is married to Afridi’s daughter Ansha.""Drop Shaheen, drop Shadab, and drop Babar. Try fresh faces against Namibia and give the new players a chance to build confidence. They've been playing for a long time. Whenever we expect them to perform, they don't. If these senior players aren't giving us the performances we desire, then play the juniors who are sitting on the bench. What is the difference?"", Afridi said during a Live show.Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha admitted after the match that the spinners failed to deliver on a surface that offered assistance.""We were believing in our spinners, and they had an off day today. Execution was missing in some parts of the game. We were obviously going to always believe our spinners, because they've done really well in last six month. And with the batting I think we didn't start well and in T20 games if we lose 3 or 4 wickets in powerplay, you are always chasing the game,"" he said in the post-match presentation ceremony.Salman also criticised the batting unit for not adapting to the conditions.""I think, to be very honest, like in first inning it was a bit tacky. The ball was gripping as well. So, the execution was, I think, missing when it comes to bowling, but I think the pitch better played better in the second inning than first inning. But our bowlers like, we didn't bowl according to the situation. And when it comes to batting, we didn't apply ourselves and gave us a chance to go deep in the game,"" he said.",Shaheen shah afridi calls for the exclusion of senior players including babar azam and shadab khan.

The upcoming T20 World Cup Group B fixture between Zimbabwe and Ireland is far more than just another league game — it could decide Australia’s fate and shape the Super 8 line-up.On Monday, Sri Lanka stormed into the Super 8s with a dominant eight-wicket win over Australia. Pathum Nissanka ’s breathtaking unbeaten 100 off 52 balls powered the chase of 182, while the Sri Lankan spinners derailed Australia after a flying 104-run opening stand between Mitchell Marsh (54) and Travis Head (56). The result left Australia teetering on the brink.With three wins in three matches, Sri Lanka have already sealed qualification. Zimbabwe sit second with two wins in two games and a healthy net run rate (NRR) of +1.984. Australia, now third with one win in three matches and an NRR of +0.414, are in serious danger. Ireland, placed fourth with one win in three games (NRR +0.150), are still mathematically alive. Oman are eliminated.The equation is simple yet dramatic.If Zimbabwe beat Ireland, they will qualify for the Super 8s — and Australia will be knocked out of the tournament. However, if Ireland win, the group opens up dramatically. Net run rate will then come into play, with Australia needing a strong victory over Oman and hoping the NRR swings in their favour.Zimbabwe have already shown their pedigree by outplaying Australia earlier in the tournament. But Ireland, fighting for survival, will view this as a golden opportunity.In essence, the Zimbabwe-Ireland clash is a virtual knockout — not just for themselves, but for Australia too.","Zimbabwe vs ireland could decide australia's fate at t20 world cup.

T20 World Cup: India humiliate Pakistan again

NEW DELHI: Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha on Sunday shared his thoughts on the defeat to India and admitted his team did not perform well.He said the team trusted their spinners, but they had a bad day and failed to execute their plans properly. He explained that losing early wickets in T20 cricket makes it very hard to recover.""We were believing in our spinners, and they had an off day today. Execution was missing in some parts of the game. We were obviously always going to believe our spinners, because they've done really well in the last six months. And with the batting, I think we didn't start well, and in T20 games, if we lose 3 or 4 wickets in the powerplay, you are always chasing the game,"" Agha said in the post-match presentation.Agha also explained why Pakistan chose to bowl first. He said the pitch was difficult early on, with the ball gripping, but it became better for batting later. He admitted the bowlers did not adjust to the situation, and the batters did not play long enough to take the game deep.Talking about pressure in big matches, he added, ""In these kinds of games, the emotions are always going to be high. We just need to deal with that because we have played enough cricket and we have played enough games like that.So, it's just we need to gather ourselves very quickly, and we have a game in two days' time, and we need to look forward to that as well.""Looking ahead to the rest of the tournament, he stressed staying positive and focusing on the bigger goal, saying, ""Yeah, obviously, you have to see the bigger picture. We have a game in two days' time. We need to win that game and qualify for the Super Eights and then it's a new tournament start again.""On the field, India dominated. Ishan Kishan scored 77 to help India reach 175/7. Then India’s bowlers bowled Pakistan out for 114, giving India a 61-run win.India are now top of Group A, while Pakistan sit third with two wins and one loss.

Suryakumar Yadav press conference: How SKY trolled India-Pakistan rivalry

NEW DELHI: India’s march in the T20 World Cup 2026 gathered further momentum in Colombo as they outclassed Pakistan by 61 runs, reinforcing their dominance in the tournament’s most intense rivalry. It was India’s eighth win in nine T20 World Cup meetings against their neighbours, and the comprehensive result ensured qualification for the Super Eight stage with room to spare.Yet, while the scoreline reflected control and authority, the talking point after the final ball had little to do with numbers.Moments after Pakistan were bowled out at the R. Premadasa Stadium, television cameras captured an animated exchange involving Hardik Pandya , captain Suryakumar Yadav and Kuldeep Yadav . As players lined up for the customary handshakes, Hardik appeared visibly charged up, gesturing toward Kuldeep in what seemed like a heated discussion. Tilak Varma watched on with concern before Rinku Singh stepped in, seemingly attempting to cool tempers.Speculation quickly swirled on social media, with fans debating whether frustration had spilled over despite the comfortable win.Suryakumar, however, moved swiftly to diffuse the narrative.The India skipper shared a light-hearted video on social media in which he is seen walking up to Kuldeep and hugging him warmly.He captioned it: “Gussa chodh do bhai”. The post instantly went viral.India had earlier set the tone through Ishan Kishan ’s explosive 77 off 40 balls, an innings studded with boundaries that lifted the total to 176. Tilak Varma and Suryakumar ensured stability through the middle overs.The bowlers then dismantled Pakistan with clinical precision. Hardik struck in the opening over, while Jasprit Bumrah’s incisive spell derailed the chase.Axar Patel and Kuldeep tightened the screws as Pakistan’s middle and lower order folded under pressure.",India beat pakistan by 61 runs in their t20 world cup group b clash.

NEW DELHI: Former Pakistan fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar launched a fierce attack on Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chief Mohsin Naqvi after Pakistan’s heavy 61-run loss to India in the T20 World Cup.Akhtar said Pakistan’s current situation is the result of poor leadership and bad decisions over many years.Speaking to ABP News after the match, he criticised the PCB leadership, saying, ""One guy who does not know anything has become the Pakistan Cricket Board's chairman. What can you do? How will the team run?""He also slammed the team’s reliance on underperforming superstar players, saying, ""You have made a superstar out of a player who cannot win you a game.""Akhtar added that poor appointments are a major problem, calling it ""The biggest crime in the world is to give a particular job to incompetent people.""He even described Naqvi as ""incompetent and 'jaahil'"" and said he was not fit to lead the board.Akhtar also criticised Pakistan’s performance, saying the team was far behind India and lacked modern-day cricket standards.He said Pakistan have failed to invest in talent for years and can no longer compete with India at the highest level.In the match, India scored 175/7 thanks to Ishan Kishan’s 77 and useful contributions from Suryakumar Yadav and Shivam Dube.Pakistan’s chase collapsed early, falling to 13/3 in just two overs.

Mike Hesson press conference: 'Ishan took the game away from us' after India beat Pakistan

NEW DELHI: Former India spin-bowling all-rounder Ravichandran Ashwin came down hard on Pakistan following their comprehensive defeat to the Men in Blue in the 2026 T20 World Cup, identifying the toss as the turning point of the contest.India registered a commanding 61-run win in Colombo, and Ashwin felt Pakistan’s decision to bowl first after winning the toss handed India a decisive edge on a surface where chasing has been challenging throughout the tournament.“Where did they win to lose the plot? Pakistan lost the game when they opted to bowl first after winning the toss because we saw the match between Australia and Zimbabwe. Australia struggled to get 170. When we see IPL matches, teams win easily if they need 100 runs off the last 10 overs. But it’s not happening in this World Cup. In Premadasa Stadium, you can’t chase 100 in ten overs. The way Pakistan deals with pressure, India are 100 times better in that aspect. I don’t think Pakistan are there. Honestly, Pakistan have become tactically better under Salman Agha and Mike Hesson. But the way they brought Shaheen Afridi after Agha’s first over was a terrible mistake,” Ashwin said on his YouTube channel Ash ki Baat.Ashwin also raised questions over Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha’s use of his bowlers in the powerplay, particularly the early introduction of Shaheen Afridi instead of exploring alternate match-ups.“You took Abhishek Sharma’s wicket, and he is leaking runs left, right and centre. We noted in the preview how dangerous Ishan Kishan is against left-arm seam. I feel cricketers need to be explained, ‘This is your match-up’. Data tells the truth. When you say Ishan is taking on left-arm seam, he is taking it on. I’m not saying don’t bowl left-arm seam to him, but they must do something different. If Shaheen was getting whacked, I would’ve loved to see him come round the wicket to the left-hander. He didn’t do it, and the second over should have been Saim Ayub.""He further criticised Pakistan’s failure to regain control in the death overs, pointing out how Afridi’s return spell allowed India to surge ahead.“The fast bowler released the pressure. India were 159 after 19 overs, and Afridi was brought again, and he leaked runs again. Afridi gave away 16 runs in the final over,” he added.India will wrap up their league-stage campaign against the Netherlands in Ahmedabad on Wednesday before shifting focus to the Super 8s.",India registered a commanding 61-run win in colombo.

Johannes Høsflot Klæbo is one of the biggest stars in winter sports. The Norwegian cross-country skier has dominated the Olympics and World Cup circuit for years. Off the snow, his personal life has also drawn attention. Klæbo is engaged to Pernille Døsvik, a young professional from Trondheim. The couple confirmed their engagement in June 2025 after several years together. Fans often see her supporting him during competitions and training periods.Klæbo first competed in the World Cup in the 2015-16 season. He quickly became a sensation. At the 2018 PyeongChang Winter Olympics, he won three gold medals and established himself as Norway’s leading skier. He later defended sprint titles and added more medals in Beijing. By 2026, he had collected 11 Olympic medals, including nine golds. Many close to him say Døsvik’s support has played a major role in his consistent success.Pernille Døsvik is a 24-year-old from Trondheim. She is studying civil engineering in marine technology at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). Alongside her studies, she also works in social media and brand promotion.She has handled digital content for several fashion labels, including ella&il.

After that project, she began an official Instagram collaboration with the brand.Johannes Høsflot Klæbo and Pernille Døsvik met through mutual friends. Their connection began online after he reacted to one of her Instagram photos. She later added him on Snapchat, and they started talking regularly. Both grew up in the same city, which helped their relationship develop quickly.The skier had earlier said his training schedule left little room for dating. That changed in 2018, when they became a couple. Since then, they have lived together and appeared frequently in his YouTube vlogs. The videos show their travels, workouts, and daily routines.Døsvik is also careful during winter seasons. She follows strict health precautions to avoid bringing illness into Klæbo’s training environment. Their engagement announcement came on June 15, 2025, through a joint social media post.

Switzerland is ready to give its all against Italy despite immense pressure



Switzerland faces a dangerous single-elimination matchup Tuesday when it takes on host Italy at Rho Arena in the Olympic qualifying playoff round. The fifth-seeded Swiss drew the 12th-seeded Italians in a game that carries enormous pressure despite the seeding difference.Captain Roman Josi made it clear his team cannot afford to overlook the hosts, even after Italy suffered an 11-0 loss to Finland in its final preliminary game. The veteran defenseman knows one mistake sends Switzerland home empty-handed.The Swiss finished 2-1-0-0 in Group A play after defeating Czechia 4-3 in overtime Sunday, a character-building victory that provided important lessons heading into the knockout stage. That win secured second place in the group and set up Tuesday's qualifier at the smaller, more intimate venue known as HC2 for the Olympics.Josi emphasized the importance of winning the game in front of them before thinking about what comes next. If Switzerland advances, a quarterfinal matchup with Finland awaits, but the captain made it clear that's not where his team's attention belongs.""You've got to win that game before you can think about anything else,"" Josi said.""And I think you saw Italy; they played great against Sweden and played really well against Slovakia. There were tight games.""The Swiss captain pointed out that Italy's preliminary round wasn't as disastrous as Saturday's blowout suggests. The Italians hung with Sweden in a 5-2 loss that was tied 2-2 early in the second period, then lost just 3-2 to Slovakia before the Finland debacle.""I think every team would say that there's no easy game,"" Josi continued. ""So yeah, our focus is on tomorrow. We've got to play our best tomorrow, and then what happens after we can look to.""Switzerland's overtime victory against Czechia on Sunday gave the team valuable experience in handling a high-stakes game with momentum swings. The back-and-forth contest saw both teams trade goals before the Swiss found a way to win.""There were a lot of different challenges throughout the game,"" Josi said. ""It was a high-stakes game; there was a lot on the line. They tied it up, we scored again, and they tied it up again. There were a lot of ups and downs, and at the end we found a way to win it, which is a great character win for our group.""The qualifier begins at 6:10 a.m. ET Tuesday at Rho Arena, where an electric crowd is expected as Swiss fans travel from across the nearby border to support their team against the hosts.",Switzerland faces a dangerous single-elimination matchup against italy.

Only 72 players are in the field, but there will still be a cut after 36 holes.The top 50 players and ties will move to the weekend rounds, which adds early pressure. Last week’s AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am also had a $20 million purse, but it paid $3.6 million to the winner because the field was larger and had no cut.

The purse stays the same, but the competition looks stronger, which should make the weekend battle exciting for fans.Prize money distribution (top 10):Players who finish 50th will still earn $52,000, showing how valuable every position is.

Twins owner Tom Pohlad says Framber Valdez was top target in free agency

Framber Valdez begins new chapter with Detroit Tigers

Framber Valdez has officially started a new chapter in his career after signing a three-year, $115 million contract with the Detroit Tigers. But before landing in Detroit, another American League Central team was seriously trying to bring him in. The Minnesota Twins were among the teams pursuing the star left-hander this offseason. Twins owner Tom Pohlad revealed that the organization made a strong push to sign Valdez before he ultimately chose Detroit.Valdez, who spent six seasons with the Houston Astros, shared a heartfelt goodbye message to Houston fans on Instagram after his deal became official. His post included moments from his Astros journey, including a photo with the 2022 World Series trophy and highlights from key games. He wrote, “Houston, I want to say thank you for giving me the chance to be an Astro, and for being part of the family since the beginning. ” His message reflected gratitude as he closed one chapter and prepared to begin another in Detroit.As rumors surrounded Minnesota’s offseason plans, Pohlad confirmed that Valdez was viewed as the top pitcher available on the market.“He was the best pitcher on the market at that point,” Pohlad told The Minnesota Star Tribune.“We would’ve had a hell of a 1-2-3 punch [in the rotation], and it would be crazy not to look at that.”Valdez posted a 3.66 ERA with 187 strikeouts and a 13-11 record in 31 starts last season with Houston. The 32-year-old was considered a marquee free agent, especially for teams looking to strengthen their starting rotation.Pohlad also said adding Valdez would have shown fans that the organization was serious about competing.“It would’ve been fun to make a splash and show the organization and the fans that we’re committed,” Pohlad said. “I do know that payroll matters to people. It wasn’t just about adding to the payroll. It was a decision that [General Manager Jeremy Zoll] thought was in the best interest of the team, and if he thought that, then I was going to be willing to go there for us.”Despite missing out on Valdez, Pohlad expressed confidence in Minnesota’s direction. The Twins finished 70-92 last season, fourth in the AL Central, but the owner pushed back on low expectations for 2026.“I want to be aggressive,” Pohlad said. “That’s my personality. But there is only so much we can do given the timing that we were in. We tried to be aggressive on some things. Those things didn’t work out, and here we are. But we really like our team.”Valdez made his MLB debut with Houston in August 2018 and quickly became a core part of the rotation. During his Astros career, he earned two All-Star selections, won the 2022 World Series, and was named to the All-MLB First Team.After entering free agency, he agreed to the major deal with Detroit on February 10. According to ESPN MLB insider Jeff Passan, the contract carries the highest average annual value ever for a left-handed pitcher and also the highest among Latin American pitchers. The Tigers secured one of the top pitchers on the market, even as a division rival tried to do the same.","Twins owner tom pohlad says framber valdez was top target in free agency.

San Jose Sharks place forward Jeff Skinner on unconditional waivers for contract termination,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/san-jose-sharks-place-forward-jeff-skinner-on-unconditional-waivers-for-contract-termination/articleshow/128436809.cms,"Jeff Skinner looks to regain form while guiding Sharks’ youth ( Image via Getty Images)



Veteran forward Jeff Skinner put on unconditional waivers for contract termination

In a significant roster move, veteran forward Jeff Skinner was placed on unconditional waivers by the San Jose Sharks on Monday to terminate his one-year, $3 million contract, as per reports by Elliotte Friedman of Sportsnet.Previously, Skinner signed a one-year, $3 million contract with the Sharks last July. He had an impressive season, as the forward has posted six goals, 13 points, 56 shots on net, and 17 hits across 32 appearances with San Jose in the 2025-26 season. After his contract gets terminated, he will become an unrestricted free agent. This decision by the Sharks would bring a huge shift in Skinner’s tenure and would prompt speculation regarding the veteran forward's next landing spot. Veteran forward Jeff Skinner was placed on unconditional waivers by the San Jose Sharks on Monday for purposes of terminating his one-year, $3 million contract on Monday. Announcing the same, NHL Insider Elliotte Friedman wrote on his X/Twitter handle, “Jeff Skinner (SJ) on unconditional waivers for purposes of contract termination.”As for his performance, the 33-year-old forward has recorded 6 goals and 13 points with 56 shots in 32 games this season, but has been a healthy scratch for the last 10 outings before the Olympic break.He was acquired last July after playing with Edmonton and a buyout from the Buffalo Sabres, but couldn't secure a consistent lineup spot amid roster crunches.As per reports, Skinner joined the Sharks on a one-year deal worth $3 million that he signed in July, followed by a similar arrangement with the Edmonton Oilers for the previous season. In the 2024-25 season, he achieved 16 goals and 29 points in 72 games with Edmonton, also contributing one goal and two points during their playoff run to the Stanley Cup Final.Skinner also has an illustrious career in the NHL so far. The player had played an impressive 1,110 career games, and he has amassed 379 goals and 712 points. He scored over 30 goals in five seasons, achieving a personal best of 40 goals with the Buffalo Sabres during the 2018-19 season.If he clears the waivers unclaimed, Skinner would become an unrestricted free agent to sign elsewhere, freeing $3 million in cap space for San Jose. As Skinner’s time with the Sharks comes to an end, his future in the NHL remains uncertain. However, as many clubs are looking for potential candidates for their team, his NHL performance and experience may attract interest from other teams in need of a seasoned forward.","Jeff skinner was placed on unconditional waivers by the san jose sharks on monday for purposes of terminating his one-year, $3 million contract.

T20 World Cup: How Australia can still qualify for Super 8s

NEW DELHI: A shattered Mitchell Marsh did not hide his emotions after Australia crashed to a crushing eight-wicket defeat against Sri Lanka in a must-win clash at the Pallekele International Cricket Stadium on Monday, conceding his side’s fate in the tournament is now out of their hands.Australia posted 181 after a blazing start but were blown away by a sensational chase led by Pathum Nissanka , whose unbeaten century sealed Sri Lanka’s place in the Super 8s and left the former champions staring at an early exit.“It is a devastated group. We’re in the lap of the gods now, I think, with the way it’s shaped up,” Marsh said in a brutally honest assessment. “There’s a lot of emotion in the rooms right now. We haven’t been at our best… we’re a disappointed bunch at the moment.”At the halfway stage of their innings, Australia looked firmly in control. Marsh (54) and Travis Head (56) powered their side to a commanding 110/2, setting the platform for a massive total. But what followed was a dramatic collapse in momentum, as Sri Lanka’s bowlers tightened the screws.“Well, I thought it was a competitive total at the halfway mark.There’s no doubt we probably left ourselves a few short after the start that we had. So that’s disappointing,” Marsh admitted. “We know that at our best we can make big scores. And we just lost our way a little bit there towards the back-end. Couldn’t get a partnership going and Sri Lanka bowled really well.”He added with resignation: “Coming off, we knew we were a few short… not much else to say other than Sri Lanka outplayed us tonight.”Sri Lanka made Australia pay dearly. Nissanka’s breathtaking 100 not out off just 52 balls turned the chase into a statement, as Australia’s bowlers had no answers on a night when everything seemed to slip away.The defeat marked Australia’s second consecutive loss and left them in a precarious position in Group B. With just one win from three matches, their Super 8 hopes now hinge on other results — particularly the crucial clash between Zimbabwe and Ireland.Marsh admitted the team could only watch and hope.“We watch the Zimbabwe-Ireland game and we hope… but yeah, we’re a disappointed bunch at the moment,” he said.The qualification equation is tense and unforgiving.If Zimbabwe beat Ireland on Tuesday, Australia will be eliminated from the tournament. However, an Ireland victory will keep Australia’s hopes alive and open up a three-way fight for the remaining Super 8 spot.In that scenario, Zimbabwe’s final group match against Sri Lanka on February 19 will become decisive. A Zimbabwe win over the co-hosts will take them through to the Super 8s alongside Sri Lanka, ending Australia’s chances regardless of other results.But if Zimbabwe lose to Sri Lanka — and Ireland have already beaten Zimbabwe — then Zimbabwe and Ireland will both finish on four points, bringing net run rate into play to determine the second qualifier from the group.Australia, who face Oman on February 20 in their final match, will then enter the contest with a clear net run rate equation. They will need a convincing win and a favourable swing in numbers to stay alive and secure a dramatic late qualification.",Australia crashed to a crushing eight-wicket defeat against sri lanka in a must-win clash at the pallekele international cricket stadium on monday.

Axar Patel press conference: 'We see them as a team, don't see rivalry' after India beat Pakistan

NEW DELHI: India wicketkeeper-batter Ishan Kishan credited the fans and his teammates after delivering a match-winning performance against Pakistan in the T20 World Cup on Sunday, saying the Player-of-the-Match honour was not his alone.Kishan said he approached the high-voltage clash with a calm mindset, treating it like any other fixture. He focused on watching the ball closely, assessing the pitch and target, and backing his natural game. There was no sense of panic, he noted, and he drew confidence from the plans discussed within the group. However, he stressed that the job is far from complete and that his focus has already shifted to the next game.Continuing his rich vein of form in T20s, Kishan countered Pakistan’s spin strategy with authority, striking his second consecutive T20 World Cup fifty. His fluent knock of 77 powered India to a commanding 61-run victory in Colombo. Behind the stumps too, he made a significant impact, highlighted by a sharp stumping to dismiss the dangerous Usman Khan, who was attempting to rebuild with a measured counter-attack.In a video shared by the Board of Control for Cricket in India, Ishan Kishan said: ""Not only for me, I feel this is for all the supporters who were supporting us throughout the game, throughout the tournament, when we were preparing very hard. So credit goes not just to me, but to the whole of India.""I think I was just keeping it simple, like I said in the press conference earlier that day it's just another game. You have to watch the ball and play your shots, which you believe in, which are on. You have to assess the wicket, how is it playing, what's the good total for all of our teammates, I think they had that in plan and that was giving me much confidence. There was no panic about anything before the match or in between the games. I was just keeping it simple and playing my shots. No, I think the job is not over. So I wouldn't say I'm very satisfied we need to forget this one and move on to the next game,"" he said.After winning the toss, Pakistan opted to bowl. India suffered an early setback when Abhishek departed for a duck, but Kishan’s aggressive 77 and Tilak’s composed 25 steadied the innings. The Men in Blue slipped to 126/4, losing their set batters along with all-rounder Hardik Pandya (0). Skipper Suryakumar, along with Shivam and Rinku, then ensured a strong finish, timing their acceleration well under challenging conditions. India posted 175/7, with Saim Ayub (3/25) emerging as Pakistan’s most successful bowler.In reply, Pakistan were rocked early, reduced to 34/4 by strikes from Hardik, Jasprit Bumrah and Axar Patel. Usman Khan fought back with 44 off 34 balls, including six fours and a six, but lacked substantial support as India bowled Pakistan out for 114 in 18 overs to seal their third straight win and advance to the Super 8 stage.Axar (2/29) led the bowling effort, while Hardik (2/16), Bumrah (2/17) and Varun Chakaravarthy (2/17) also chipped in with crucial wickets. India sit atop Group A with three wins from three matches. Pakistan are third with two victories and a defeat, while the USA hold second place with two wins and two losses.

Nate Diaz vs Conor McGregor tie-breaker could drive huge numbers



Nate Diaz Hoping For UFC Return, Wants White House Card | TMZ Sports

Nate Diaz is gearing up for a return to mixed martial arts and has already named the opponent he wants to face the most. The fan favorite has been away from the UFC since September 2022. He finished Tony Ferguson by submission in his last contracted fight. After that, he tried boxing and faced the likes of Jake Paul and Jorge Masvidal. Now, fit and ready to return, Diaz says he wants real competition again. He mentioned Conor McGregor first, and also spoke about Dustin Poirier and Mike Perry as possible opponents.Talk about a Diaz vs. McGregor trilogy is growing because the UFC is planning a major event on June 14. The promotion hopes to hold the show on the White House South Lawn during the United States’ 250th anniversary celebrations. Dana White has said the card is being finalized. Diaz and McGregor both showed interest. Their rivalry is tied at one win each from 2016. McGregor is expected to be eligible to compete again in March 2026.Nate Diaz explained in an interview that he feels ready to return to serious competition. He indicated his top choice is a third fight with Conor McGregor. He also suggested a bout with Dustin Poirier and mentioned Mike Perry as another possibility, while criticizing Poirier’s reluctance to fight.Diaz has continued to hint at an octagon comeback even during his boxing run.Poirier, however, retired after his third fight with Max Holloway last year. He has not fully committed to returning, though he has admitted a bout with Diaz, even in boxing, is interesting to him.Former fighter Brendan Schaub recently opened up on the matter. He believes the UFC needs the trilogy if it wants a record audience for the White House show. He said casual viewers would only tune in for recognizable stars and that the roster alone may not be enough to achieve massive viewership without a nostalgic matchup.Schaub also questioned Diaz’s current level. He pointed to moments in Diaz’s last UFC appearance where he seemed unfocused. In his view, the fight would attract attention mainly because of history rather than elite performance. He compared the potential event to comfort entertainment, explaining fans may not expect the highest technical quality but would still watch because the rivalry is memorable and satisfying.",Nate diaz has been away from the ufc since september 2022.

Winter Olympics participation does not come with a salary

The 2026 Winter Olympics are past the midway mark, and Team USA has stayed in the spotlight. The team figure skating squad won gold. Chloe Kim earned a silver medal in the snowboard halfpipe. Madison Chock and Evan Bates also finished second in ice dancing. More medal chances are still ahead. Fans around the world continue watching closely as athletes compete at their highest level. The performances have created excitement and raised new questions about the lives of Olympians.Many fans assume Olympic athletes earn big salaries during the Milano Cortina Games. The reality is very different. Competing at the Olympics requires years of training and heavy spending. Athletes travel often and work with coaches, trainers, and equipment specialists. Because of this, many fans now want to know how much they are actually paid. Former U.S. figure skater Adam Rippon recently explained the situation and surprised many people with his answer.Adam Rippon, who won bronze in the 2018 team figure skating event, spoke about the topic during an NBC News LA interview. He made it clear that athletes do not earn money simply for competing at the Olympics.“Damn, I wish,” Rippon joked in the clip posted on TikTok. “No, you don’t. Actually, you don’t get paid to go to the Olympics at all.”He added that athletes still face large expenses while attending the Games.“So, as an athlete, you still have the expenses of bringing your coach there. You do get paid by the U.S. Olympic Committee if you win a medal. It’s nothing substantial in comparison to your expenses of being an athlete. But that’s the only time that you’ll make money. You’re just there, and you’re racking up a bill”, he added.The only direct earnings come from medals. The U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee provides “Operation Gold” bonuses. Athletes previously received $37,500 for gold, $22,500 for silver, and $15,000 for bronze. These payments apply to each medal won. Multiple medals increase total earnings, but they rarely cover years of training costs.In simple terms, Rippon suggested that Olympians mainly compete for honor, not income. He explained that participation alone brings no salary. Only medal winners receive limited payments. Athletes often still spend more money than they earn while representing their country.","Adam rippon, who won bronze in the 2018 team figure skating event, spoke about the topic during an nbc news la interview.

After the heartbreaking defeat against South Africa, the Afghanistan team converged in the manager's room for dinner. The team sat down, just hours after going down in twin Super Overs, and talked positively about their effort.There was very good reason to be downbeat after such a loss. They could have won in regulation time. They could have won in the first Super Over but for a last ball six by Tristan Stubbs. And then a hat-trick of sixes wasn't enough in the second Super Over. Rashid Khan , a leader in the dressing room and one of the most experienced players in the format, stressed the need to keep their heads up or they would go ""one or two years back.""The dinner helped as well. The squad devoured Peshawari food, including Dal Bukhara (Dal Makhani) and Tandoori Chicken, to ""vent their anger."" It is understandable that the Afghan squad misses home food as they travel from country to country and are stationed away from home.Ever since becoming a Full Member of the ICC, Afghanistan have never played at home and have used different training facilities to prepare for major events such as the T20 World Cup. From Dehradun at start to Sharjah now, Afghanistan have never found a home footing.""What we miss a lot is the home food, to be honest. We go around everywhere, we're not getting that Afghani home food, and that's something which we struggle with,"" said Rashid on the eve of their contest against the UAE at the Arun Jaitley Stadium in New Delhi.""Other than that, I feel we have enough people around the team who give us the best company and we don't really miss home. And also, wherever we go, we get so much love from everyone, and that's something which doesn't even let us to feel like we are not home.""But sometimes you do feel, you do miss your home. You want to be having your own crowd, people cheering for you, but unluckily we are not having that opportunity where we can play in front of that crowd. But still, it's harder.""Professional cricket, you have to manage yourself with all these and not too much think about all those other stuff. I think what we're here for; we have to put that thing first. And there are people who don't go home for five, 10 years. We're lucky. We go after the tour to home, and we have a good time with the family,"" he continued.Delhi, which hosted Afghanistan's most recent match in the ongoing T20 World Cup, has a sizeable Afghan population. There are pockets in the national capital - such as Lajpat Nagar and Bhogal - which the refugees have called home for many years now.Some of them made the trip to the Arun Jaitley Stadium on Monday morning carrying flags and some wearing the traditional attire. Their presence, and noise, became even more important in the aftermath of the heartbreak that the team suffered less than a week ago.As it transpired, the Afghan team needed every ounce of that positive energy to go past the UAE -- winning by 5 wickets with four balls remaining -- and keep their T20 World Cup Super Eight hopes alive. New Zealand are still favourites to seal the second spot from the group, alongside the already qualified South Africa, if they beat Canada on Tuesday. That would render Afghanistan's final contest against Canada as a dead rubber.""Hoping for the best. Yes, (we) still have a little bit of hope, we can make it to the next stage and we just need to come up with a positive mindset (against Canada),"" said Rashid after beating the UAE, once again stressing on the need to remain upbeat.""Next game, you never know, it's a T20 game, we'll have to come up with a good brand of cricket. Even if we don't make it to the next round, we want to play with the same brand of cricket and make the country and our people proud and happy.""Having already faced heartbreak of gigantic proportions, as the ask got tougher in the 161-run chase vs UAE, the nerves started to climb.Coach Jonathan Trott expressed pride in how the team turned things around, especially after the suffering in Ahmedabad.""We were under pressure (and) that's the pleasing thing for me as coach. I would have liked it (if it was a) lot easier. But at the end of the day when you come out on the right side of pressure situations... like we were having the history of the last game, I've certainly seen a shift. We've lost tight games like that and then after that it's very much - been hard to pull it back, the confidence. So I see a bit of an improvement in the resilience, cricketing-wise, but also mentally,"" said Trott in the post-match press conference.In the aftermath of a win, their first of the tournament, the mood in the team hotel would be a bit more upbeat. However, a trip to Lajpat Nagar for some home style food would be unfathomable, despite the suggestions of a reporter.

Axar Patel press conference: 'We see them as a team, don't see rivalry' after India beat Pakistan

One of the heartening features of West Indies' unbeaten run in the 2026 T20 World Cup, which has seen them win all their three league games so far to storm into the Super 8s, has been the fine form of their former captain Jason Holder . The 34-year-old all-rounder took three for 30 in the opener against Scotland at the Eden Gardens in Kolkata, before chipping in with a vital 17-ball 33, which included four massive sixes against England at the Wankhede Stadium in his team's 30-run win over their traditional rivals.Holder was taken off the attack after going wicketless while conceding 34 in just two overs against England. However, on Sunday, at the same venue, the seasoned pacer rediscovered his mojo against Nepal, taking a wicket off his first and last balls to finish with four for 27, even though his final over went for 16.“Yeah, it was a bit up and down. But I will take it. Getting four wickets in a World Cup can be a bit special, and to be able to do it today was good,” Holder told reporters after the match.With seven wickets in three matches at 13.00, Holder is currently the highest wicket-taker for the West Indies.Sunday's win offered relief to the West Indies after they had stunningly lost a T20I series to the Associate nation 1-2 in September last year at Sharjah. “Nepal has obviously been a team that’s been very competitive, and they’ve beaten us in the recent past as well. We knew we had to come up really hard in this game and make sure we started really well,” Holder said.Holder asserted that being a captain or simply a player in the team didn't matter to him, as long as he was contributing to the team's success as a senior player, putting all his experience in internationals and franchise cricket to good use. ""Look, my role in the teams I've played in has been very clear for me. I guess here in this team, we've got a lot of heavy power in terms of our batting. So my role with the bat is probably a little less demanding than the role with the ball. But having said that, for me, it's just playing the situation. Post-captaincy or captaincy, it doesn't make a difference to me. For me, it's about what I need to do in order for this team to be successful,"" the veteran all-rounder analysed.Asked about the lack of express fast bowlers coming out of the West Indies these days, Holder said that much of that could be put down to the slow pitches in the Caribbean at present. ""Look, there's been a lot of debate as to why, over the years, we've had some very slow pitches. We don't quite get the quick pitches that we used to get on a consistent basis in the Caribbean. So, that may have a bit to do with it, but look, it is what it is in terms of what we've got. I think what is important for us is to use what we've got well, put some support behind them and ensure that we can develop them in a way that they can be world-class bowlers,"" he said.The seasoned fast bowler pointed out that pace alone wasn't the sole factor to guarantee success in international cricket, but “accuracy and skill” were. ""You don't necessarily have to be ‘express’ to be successful at this level, but if you're very accurate and skilful, you can get some good success here at this level. So, it's important for the West Indies to continue to put some support behind our fast bowlers to ensure that they keep developing their skills. ""Holder said that a good team environment was one of the key reasons for the West Indies enjoying a fine run in the 2026 T20 World Cup. ""In the dressing room, we've created an environment where everybody is a lot more comfortable, a lot more clear. We've been having a lot of in-depth conversations. And it's been good to see the maturity level of each individual putting their hands up,"" Holder explained.""And so far, we've been doing a really good job. And the beauty about each game that we've won is that different people have stepped up and it hasn't been like one consistent person in every single game. The main thing for us is to stay focused and ensure that we continue with this momentum.""",West indies have won all three of their t20 world cup games so far. Jason holder has taken seven wickets in three matches at 13.00. The 34-year-old all-rounder said that a good team environment was one of the key reasons for the west indies' fine run. We've been having a lot of in-depth conversations.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128428325,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-79178,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"
