Drake Maye's offseason plans center on wife Ann after Super Bowl LX defeat



Drake Maye did not talk about stats, schemes or revenge tours. After the Patriots fell 29-13 to the Seattle Seahawks in Super Bowl LX, Drake Maye made it clear what matters most to him now. The season ended. The locker room emptied. And as New England enters a 10 week break before players return, the quarterback already knows where his focus lies.The loss hurt. It ended a remarkable run that pushed the Patriots further than many expected. Yet when Maye faced reporters for the final time this season, his mind was not on missed opportunities. It was on home. More specifically, on the woman who has stood beside him since middle school and became his wife in June 2025.What is Drake Maye looking forward to this offseason? His answer came without hesitation.""I got a beautiful wife, so I look forward to spending my offseason with [her]... that's gonna be the highlight of my offseason, I can tell you that,"" Maye said.That response says plenty about who he is beyond the helmet. While fans debate roster moves and draft needs, Maye plans to step away from the spotlight and lean into a relationship that began when he was just 12 years old.He and Ann Michael grew from childhood friends into partners for life, long before the NFL cameras arrived.They married last summer, months before Maye led New England on a deep postseason push. In February 2026, he reflected on that milestone with uncommon honesty.“Getting married is one of the best decisions I’ve made in my life,” Maye told reporters in February 2026. “Good things happen when you get married, and I think that’s been the case so far in my life.”Ann has also carved out her own space in the public eye. Her TikTok cooking videos gained traction during the playoff run, turning her into a fan favorite among Patriots supporters. Maye welcomes the attention she has earned.“She’s got her own little journey that’s been awesome. Just being herself — that’s the best thing about her and what I love her for,” Maye said.Those close to the couple say Ann has rarely missed a game since junior high. From small school fields to the Super Bowl stage, she has remained a constant. The championship result did not deliver the ending they hoped for. Still, their story feels bigger than one February night.For Maye, the offseason is not about escape. It is about returning to where it all began.","Drake maye's offseason plans center on wife ann after super bowl lx defeat. Maye and ann michael grew from childhood friends into partners for life.

Who is Tiffany Stratton’s new boyfriend?

What happened between Tiffany Stratton and Ludwig Kaiser?

WWE Superstar Tiffany Stratton has always made headlines when it comes to in-ring action, but her personal life has also been making headlines in the recent past as well. The former NXT Women’s title holder, known to fans as the Buff Barbie, has moved on from her relationship with WWE star Ludwig Kaiser. Pregnant speculation over their demise had been reaching for months, since the pair stopped publicly appearing together.Stratton's now seemingly moved on with a brand-new partner, and social media is already in a frenzy. This week, her rumored boyfriend made his homage to the WWE star more dramatic and arguably permanent, with a tattoo of Stratton's eye on his forearm. Needless to say, the bold move quickly went viral and proved to a lot of fans that this new romance is more than just a love affair.The man behind Stratton's new romance is Shady Elnahas, an up-and-coming star currently signed to WWE. Elnahas was a national-level judoka before transitioning into professional wrestling, and represented Canada on the international stage as well. That background as an athlete eventually led him to WWE, where he has spent the past several years in the NXT system, honing his craft.For months, Elnahas and Stratton had been seen appearing together at WWE events and in personal posts on social media.They never put a label on their relationship to the public, but their interactions said it all. The most conspicuous verification arrived when Elnahas displayed the huge tattoo of a definite picture of Stratton's eye on him, instantly catching the attention of wrestling fanatics around the world.Stratton casually showed off the tattoo in a short video he posted online, where he got it inked on his arm. Fans wasted little time commenting that the seriousness of the relationship must be great for this person to make such a permanent statement. The two have since continued making appearances together and further exciting fans in doing so.Stratton was previously in a long-term relationship with WWE star Ludwig Kaiser before she began dating Shady Elnahas. With both of them really rising up the WWE power ladder at the same time, the couple was one of the most buzzed-about couples in the company. They used to make many social media and public appearances together for some time.Fans started speculating about trouble when they realized the duo had stopped posting about each other. Afterward, Kaiser was spotted with another woman, and a presumed split appeared to be in order. Kaiser and Stratton never directly commented on the breakup, but their radio silence said more than enough.","Wwe superstar tiffany stratton has moved on from her relationship with wwe star ludwig kaiser.

LATEST ON PATRICK LAINE: Canadiens Trade Plans, Interested Teams & Potential Landing Spots!

Calgary Flames and Nashville Predators evaluate trade options before the March 6 deadline

Nazem Kadri (Flames): Elliotte Friedman reported last Thursday that NHL teams lost interest in him because other centers were available for selection, who included Vincent Trocheck and Robert Thomas.

Blake Coleman (Flames): Friedman rejected all rumors that connected him to Montreal.

Jonathan Marchessault (Predators): Friedman thinks Jonathan becomes a potential candidate when he decides to lift his no-movement clause.

Ryan O’Reilly (Predators): The Canadiens still want O'Reilly, although Nashville's future remains uncertain because Barry Trotz will leave his GM position after the team finds his successor.

The Montreal Canadiens have improved their ability to compete this season, which has changed how people view Patrik Laine. Laine scored 20 goals during 52 games last season, which helped Montreal reach the playoffs. The Canadiens currently hold the second position in the Atlantic Division and maintain the third-highest scoring rate in the NHL with 3.46 goals per game, demonstrating their capacity to score points without depending on a single player.Laine, who is currently 27 years old, has returned to skating after completing his recovery from abdominal surgery. His current situation has become a focal point as the March 6 NHL trade deadline approaches. The Montreal decision makers must consider three elements of his contract, which include his $8.7 million cap hit, his eligibility for unrestricted free agency this summer, and his 10-team no-trade list.The Montreal Canadiens reportedly plan to retain 50 percent of Laine's salary, according to Sportsnet reporter Eric Engels. The Canadiens will not include extra assets for his trade, according to league sources.Marco D'Amico, who writes for RG.org, identified multiple teams that could match their needs.The Calgary team must sell its players because they lack playoff prospects. The Kings added Artemi Panarin to their roster, but need to strengthen their center position. Laine has two problems with his injury history and rental status, which prevent Carolina and Seattle from making strong trade offers.David Staples from the Edmonton Journal reported that Sportsnet analyst Nick Kypreos suggested that Edmonton should acquire Laine. Staples questioned the idea, noting the Oilers' tight cap situation.Trade discussions are still happening:The Montreal team demonstrates a long-term vision through its handling of Laine instead of making emotional responses to his situation. The Canadiens now possess the ability to wait for their players to develop because their scoring capacity has expanded and their operational methods have become more adaptable.","Montreal canadiens could explore patrik laine trade options.

Erika Kirk breaks silence after TPUSA’s halftime tribute divides Super Bowl audience

The night of Super Bowl LX was more than just football and a show. A competing halftime show away from the main broadcast stirred up feelings, controversy, and political symbolism. Turning Point USA pushed its All American Halftime Show as a patriotic alternative, drawing attention not only for its message but for the personal grief woven into the production.In the hours after the show aired, Erika Kirk broke her silence. Her words reframed the night as something deeper than a ratings fight or culture war moment. For supporters, it became a tribute. For critics, it raised fresh questions about politics, platform power, and how grief is carried into public space.The alternative show, organized by Turning Point USA, aired opposite Bad Bunny ’s NFL halftime performance during the championship game between the New England Patriots and the Seattle Seahawks. Headlined by Kid Rock, the event leaned heavily into honoring the late Charlie Kirk, who was killed in September.A montage played during the broadcast featured Kirk’s own words, including: “I want to honor God in all that I do. I want to be a great husband, a great father.I want to serve this country,” followed by: “I want to try to continue to lead this movement and to speak truth and to never lie, to stop thinking about yourself all of the time, and instead think about what you should do to help other people and defend this country above yourself.She further added, “I am so inspired by this army of freedom fighters. We’re going to be around for the next 100, 200 years because we know in the end our ideas will win.”Erika Kirk did not attend the event, but she later praised it publicly, calling the show “so incredible” and adding, “Charlie would’ve absolutely loved it. Thank you to the millions that tuned in.”She closed her message with a personal note that resonated across social media: “Ultimately, this is what it’s all about, making Heaven crowded.…I love you Charlie baby, this is all for you.”Despite being blocked from streaming on X, the broadcast claimed millions of viewers across platforms. Whether those numbers hold or not, the emotional weight of the tribute ensured the night would be remembered for more than just music or politics.","Erika kirk spoke out after turning point usa aired its alternative super bowl lx halftime show honoring her late husband, charlie kirk.

Devon Witherspoon’s first Super Bowl victory with the Seattle Seahawks was not just a career defining moment. It was also a deeply personal one shaped by the quiet presence of someone who has shared the highs and lows of his rise to the NFL. As the Seahawks secured a 29 to 13 win over the New England Patriots, the spotlight naturally fell on the players. But just beyond the bright lights, Witherspoon's partner Nijeria McClain was living the moment in her own unforgettable way.For Witherspoon, the night represented how quickly life can change in professional football. From draft-day expectations to Super Bowl confetti, the journey has moved fast. McClain’s support throughout that journey added emotional weight to the celebration, turning a championship win into a shared milestone rather than a solo achievement.On Monday afternoon, McClain shared a carousel of photos that captured the spirit of the night from her point of view. The images showed her celebrating Witherspoon and the Seahawks while also expressing her own personality. She wore a custom long sleeved, off the shoulder dress featuring Witherspoon’s image across the front. The look was paired with brown leather boots and a clear stadium style handbag, a mix of fashion and game day practicality.Her caption carried the emotion of the moment without overthinking it. “Gosh what a nightttt 💚💙Every win is sweeter with #21 , Especially a a SUPERBOWL WIN !” The words reflected pride, excitement, and the joy of standing beside someone at the peak of his profession.The pair then took photos on the field enjoying the view long after the final whistle. As the crowd thinned and the celebrations went on around them, the pictures became personal even with the huge stage. To Witherspoon, the victory was another milestone to a young career that had a bright future.Chosen at the fifth overall pick in the 2023 NFL Draft by the Seattle Seahawks, he was entering the league with big expectations and performance, and the night proved to be more than that. This was a reminder that behind every Super Bowl moment is a personal walk of support, belief, and shared dreams.","Devon witherspoon and nijeria mcclain celebrate seahawks' super bowl win.

Aaram se, jaldi khaa liyo

Opener Abhishek Sharma has been hospitalised due to a stomach infection and remains doubtful for India’s next match against Namibia in New Delhi. It has been reliably learnt that he was unwell even before the previous game against the USA, and his condition worsened after he took the field in the T20 World Cup opener on February 7. The youngster was running a high temperature in Mumbai and was administered drips for immediate relief.The left-hander skipped the team’s first training session at the Arun Jaitley Stadium on Tuesday. While “upset stomach” is the official word from the Indian camp, TimesofIndia.com has learnt that he is suffering from an infection.“Abhi (Abhishek) still has a few issues with his tummy. We are hopeful that he’ll be available for the game in two days’ time,” assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate said during a media interaction on Tuesday.After being dismissed for a golden duck in the tournament opener, the aggressive southpaw did not come out to field and was not spotted in the team dugout or dressing room. Sanju Samson fielded for the entire innings, forcing fielding coach T Dilip to wear the bib and handle drinks duties along with Kuldeep Yadav.This was because Washington Sundar had not yet joined the squad, while Jasprit Bumrah was also unwell. Although Bumrah made a brief appearance during one of the drinks breaks, the responsibilities were largely shared between Kuldeep and Dilip.Abhishek did not even come out for the post-match handshakes.Although he travelled with the team to Delhi, his condition deteriorated over the last 24 hours. Abhishek was seen with the rest of the squad outside head coach Gautam Gambhir ’s residence on February 8, but all was not well. Towards the latter part of the innings, Gambhir appeared visibly concerned when Abhishek was dismissed. “(take it easy, eat early),” was the Indian coach’s brief advice to the youngster.In Abhishek’s absence during the practice session, Sanju Samson was the first batter to take to the nets and looked uncomfortable while facing Hardik Pandya and Arshdeep Singh. The wicketkeeper-batter appeared low on confidence and had a scratchy session before receiving extended treatment on his left arm.“We’re waiting on Abhi’s fitness more than anything, and that will again open up a few different combinations,” ten Doeschate said while discussing possible Playing XI options.Wednesday’s net session and the pre-match press conference are expected to provide greater clarity on Abhishek’s fitness and recovery timeline.",Abhishek sharma has been hospitalised due to a stomach infection.

How PCB, ICC, BCB reached a resolution on India vs Pakistan T20 World Cup match

NEW DELHI: Sri Lanka batter Bhanuka Rajapaksa has clarified his recent comments about the bats used by Indian cricketers after they sparked major controversy during the T20 World Cup 2026.His earlier remarks were interpreted by many as an allegation of “bat-tampering” or unfair equipment advantages for Team India, but Rajapaksa said his words were misunderstood and taken out of context.In a social media post, Rajapaksa explained that his intention was to praise India’s cricketing setup and equipment standards, not accuse anyone of wrongdoing.“Hi all, just a quick clarification about comments from a recent interview that have been interpreted differently and, in parts, lost in translation,"" he wrote.“My point was meant as praise: Indian cricket is incredibly advanced, from its systems and infrastructure to its equipment standards. Their bat manufacturers are truly among the best in the world. In hindsight, I could have provided clearer context. Nothing but respect always,"" he added.The controversy began after Rajapaksa was quoted as saying, “Indian players have bats that are far superior to the best bats we get. It feels as though a layer of rubber has been applied. I can’t imagine how that’s possible. These bats can’t even be bought by others — all players know this.""These comments led to online debates and speculation about whether Indian players were using special or modified bats.However, no official complaint was made to the ICC, and neither India nor Sri Lanka issued any formal statement on the matter. The episode mainly remained a social media and fan discussion.In cricket, ball tampering has long been a sensitive topic, but bats have also been discussed in the past, especially regarding size and power.The ICC has rules on bat dimensions, such as the maximum thickness of the edges, but there are no regulations on the quality of the willow used to make bats.With English willow becoming rarer and more expensive, some fear that wealthier teams and players could gain an equipment advantage.","Sri lanka’s bhanuka rajapaksa sparks controversy with comments about indian bats.

Why is Ahmedabad likely to be the sporting capital of India? | Bombay Sport Exchange

The ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2026 continues on February 11 with three major group-stage matches featuring Afghanistan vs South Africa, Australia vs Ireland, and England vs West Indies. These games bring together former champions, title contenders, and dangerous underdogs, making it a crucial day in the tournament.In Group D, Afghanistan face South Africa at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad. Afghanistan will be eager to bounce back after a five-wicket loss to New Zealand in their opener. Despite the defeat, they are considered a dangerous side, having beaten teams like New Zealand and Australia in the previous World Cup and reaching the semi-finals.Led by Rashid Khan , Afghanistan have a strong spin-heavy squad with key players like Rahmanullah Gurbaz, Mohammad Nabi, Mujeeb Ur Rahman, and Noor Ahmad.South Africa, meanwhile, started their campaign strongly with a 56-run win over Canada. The Proteas, led by Aiden Markram, are one of the strongest teams yet to win a T20 World Cup and boast stars like Quinton de Kock , David Miller, Kagiso Rabada, and Anrich Nortje. Historically, South Africa have dominated Afghanistan, winning all three of their previous meetings.Recent form suggests South Africa have been more consistent, while Afghanistan have had mixed results.In another Group D match, Australia take on Ireland. Australia, the 2021 champions, begin their campaign against Ireland, who are looking for their first win after losing to Sri Lanka. Mitchell Marsh captains the Australian side, which includes key players such as Travis Head, Glenn Maxwell, Marcus Stoinis, Adam Zampa , and Tim David.Although Australia’s recent form has been inconsistent, they are expected to build momentum as the tournament progresses. Ireland, led by Paul Stirling, have a history of causing upsets and previously beat England in the 2022 edition.Their squad includes Josh Little, Curtis Campher, Harry Tector, and George Dockrell. Australia have won both previous T20 World Cup encounters against Ireland, but Ireland’s recent form suggests they could be competitive.In Group C, England and West Indies meet at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai in a high-profile clash between two-time champions.

Wilburn, a native of Memphis, was 62 years old.The tragedy occurred in the early morning hours in the Orange Mound neighborhood of Memphis. The Memphis Fire Department responded to a house fire at a residence on Douglass Avenue around 2:00 a.m. After battling the blaze, firefighters discovered Wilburn unresponsive in a rear hallway.

Lions in 1994).Following the news, the Washington Commanders released a statement expressing deep sadness for the loss of a franchise icon. Former teammates and the Memphis community have remembered him not just as a fierce competitor with ""ball-hawk"" instincts, but as a local role model who inspired younger generations of athletes in his hometown.Wilburn’s legacy is defined by his 20 career regular-season interceptions and his reputation as one of the most reliable cornerbacks of his era.

Radko Gudas is looking forward to adding another Olympic medal to his family’s collection



Radko Gudas smiled when talking about his father, Leo, who won bronze as a defenseman for Czechoslovakia at the 1992 Albertville Olympics. He was just 18 months old at the time, but the medal has been part of family lore ever since.He has held it many times. He thinks he wore it as a kid. And his father makes sure he never forgets about it. The 35-year-old Anaheim Ducks captain and Team Czechia alternate is making his second Olympic appearance and wants nothing more than to bring an Olympic medal to the national side.With Gudas on the Czech squad at Sochi 2014, he brings much-needed veteran presence to his side. While he would’ve loved to be part of the 2018 Games in PyeongChang or the 2022 Games in Beijing, NHL players didn’t participate in either.But his dad’s medal continued to be his motivation till he got his second chance at the Winter Olympics. ""My dad is always waving at me the bronze medal from Albertville, so it's kind of like, I need to beat him to be able to wave at him something too,"" Gudas said after practice at Santagiulia Arena on Tuesday.Gudas has played 872 games over 14 NHL seasons with Tampa Bay, Philadelphia, Washington, Florida, and Anaheim. He remains one of the league's most physical players, ranking second in hits since 2012-13 with 3,205, behind only Matt Martin.When asked if he's aging like fine wine, Gudas offered a different comparison. ""I'm more of a beer guy than wine,"" he said with a laugh. ""But yeah, I never thought I was going to be at this age at this level, so I'm really happy.""Vancouver Canucks center David Kampf, a Team Czechia teammate, knows what it's like facing Gudas from the other side. ""It's always tough to play against him,"" Kampf said. ""He's a heavy, heavy guy and playing hard, so it's nice to have him on my side.""Gudas said his father will travel to Milan later in the tournament, perhaps for the most important games. His mother, wife, and kids are already there, soaking in the experience.""It's a fun time in our family,"" he said. ""The kids are really enjoying it. We show the kids that their grandpa was at the Olympics, too. Now I'm here too, so they're kind of soaking it in.""The Czechs open against Canada on Thursday in what Gudas called one of their biggest challenges. He believes this team can compete with anyone in the tournament despite facing powerhouse nations loaded with NHL talent.","Radko gudas is looking forward to adding another olympic medal to his family’s collection.

Starting against Slovakia, Juuse Saros will try to redeem himself with his national side



Things have not gone the way Juuse Saros wanted this season. The Nashville Predators' goalie has struggled to find consistency, posting career-worst numbers through 56 games. Now, on the eve of the men's hockey tournament at the Olympic Winter Games Milano Cortina 2026, Saros is looking for a hard reset with Team Finland.Saros has been one of the busiest netminders in the NHL this season, tied with Karel Vejmelka of the Utah Mammoth for the league lead with 44 starts. But the workload has not translated to success, as his .892 save percentage ranks as the lowest of his 10-season career. The Predators sit at 26-23-7, fifth in the Central Division.The 30-year-old will get the nod when Finland opens Group B play against Slovakia on Wednesday at 10:40 a.m. ET at Santagiulia Arena. Saros said he is viewing the Olympics as a completely different challenge from his NHL struggles.""This is a completely different game and a different tournament, and I am trying to focus on this for as long as we are here,"" Saros told reporters Tuesday. He is expected to be Finland's No. 1 throughout the tournament as the defending gold medalists chase back-to-back titles.Despite his NHL struggles, Saros has earned the trust of his teammates and coaching staff.Boston Bruins defenseman Henri Jokiharju dismissed the redemption storyline surrounding his goalie. ""I don't think he has to prove himself to anyone,"" Jokiharju said.""He's a top goalie in the NHL and in this tournament, and he doesn't need to prove himself to anyone."" Saros struggled at last season's 4 Nations Face-Off, but he rebounded brilliantly at the 2025 World Championships.He posted a 4-2-0 record with a .943 save percentage and a 1.67 goals-against average, showing the form that made him one of the league's elite netminders. Finland coach Antti Pennanen referenced that performance when discussing his No. 1 goalie.""He is one of the best goalies in the NHL, and last [Worlds] he was really, really good,"" Pennanen said. ""We trust in him because he is a really good goalie."" Vancouver Canucks goalie Kevin Lankinen, who will back up Saros, praised his teammate's work ethic and athletic ability.""He's obviously super talented,"" he said. ""He's not the biggest guy, but he's athletic."" Lankinen also pushed back on the notion that Saros needs to redeem himself, calling the Olympics ""a clean slate for all of us.""Finland will face Sweden on Thursday at 6:10 a.m. ET before concluding Group B play against Italy on Saturday at 10:40 a.m. ET.

Speculation intensified when Cardi left the event early and reports surfaced alleging Diggs was seen with another woman in a hotel room hours after the loss.

Cardi B and Stefon Diggs face split speculation after hotel room claim

Tension around Cardi B and Stefon Diggs has moved from whispers to full-blown speculation, with fans closely watching every digital and public move. What once looked like a high-profile romance backed by public appearances and loyalty now appears strained, especially after Super Bowl weekend triggered a fresh wave of questions.Online observers were quick to notice subtle but telling changes. Social media connections vanished. Public support faded. Cardi, who had long defended Diggs and showed up for his biggest career moments, appeared distant during a night that usually brings couples closer together. That silence spoke louder than words for many fans following the pair closely.The speculation intensified after reports surfaced about an alleged incident following the Super Bowl loss. According to circulating claims, Diggs was seen with someone unexpected shortly after the game, sparking renewed debate about trust within the relationship. One claim spreading rapidly online states:“caught TONIGHT (February 8) sneaking his girl bestfriend into his hotel room not even an hour after he lost the superbowl.”Neither Cardi B nor Stefon Diggs has publicly addressed the allegation. Still, fans connected the dots after Cardi reportedly left the Super Bowl event early following her appearance during Bad Bunny’s performance. She did not stay on to support Diggs, a move that felt unusual given her past commitment to cheering him on from the stands.The timeline has just contributed to the mystery. Later that year in late 2024, the couple started dating and created the first child together named Baby Brim in November, 2025.The abrupt change of tone also seemed more acute with that milestone because it was more personal to people following their story.At this, all is still unproven. But in the celebrity relationship world, silence can be called upon to draw conclusions. No matter which way this chapter is closed, be it reconciliation or separation, the allure around Cardi B and Stefon Diggs is not going to decrease.","Cardi b and stefon diggs unfollowed each other following the super bowl.

Group B preview: Who leads Men's Hockey at Olympic Winter Games Milano Cortina 2026?

The Men’s Hockey at the Olympic Winter Games Milano Cortina 2026 is set to commence this Wednesday, with 12 teams divided into three pools competing against one another for playoff spots. The Group B bracket, which includes Sweden, Finland, Slovakia, and the home team, Italy, is arguably one of the more evenly contested in the draw, boasting both medal contenders and dark horse candidates.Each team will play the others through a round-robin schedule, with the winners of the groups as well as the best second-placed team qualifying for the quarterfinals. Qualification playoffs will be on Feb. 17 for the eight teams, while the quarterfinals will be on Feb. 18. The medal games will wrap up the tournament, with the gold medal determined on Feb. 22. The coverage will be shown on NBC outlets in the USA and CBC in Canada.Sweden will start as a group B team and will be expected to win gold. Sweden won silver medals at the last Sochi Winter Olympics, held in 2014, and they have top talent in their lineup as well as a level of roster depth that will be valuable. Gabriel Landeskog will be their leading forward, who will be backed by Nylander, Zibanejad, and Forsberg, while the team’s strength will lie at the back, where Hedman, Karlsson, Dahlin, and Forsling will be an unmatchable combination of talent and depth.Only between the pipes will they be uncertain, with Gustavsson expected to start, though their main challenge will be against rival Finland, which will be their potential rivals for top honors.Finns, the current Olympic champions after claiming the top prize in 2022 without NHL players, once again rely on structure, discipline, and work ethic. While they boast offensive weapons in Mikko Rantanen, Sebastian Aho, and Roope Hintz, defensive and goaltending issues remain areas of concern, especially with the loss of Aleksander Barkov to injury into the arms of goalies Juuse Saros, Kevin Lankinen, and Joonas Korpisalo. Mikael Granlund takes on the role of team captain.It looks like the dark horse that might spoil the party is Slovakia. As the bronze medal winners of the last tournament in 2022, they have some young talents such as Juraj Slafkovsky and Simon Nemec. Additionally, they have some older and more experienced players, such as the NHL defensemen Erik Cernak and Martin Fehervary. The other contributor to the forward line is the veteran Tomas Tatar.Italy completes the group, serving as the host and underdog. Under the guidance of the 2022 world champions’ head coach, Jukka Jalonen, Italy aims for improvement and contention. Damian Clara helms the predominantly European-based Italian squad from their home country with dreams of upsetting the opposition and gaining valuable world championship exposure.","The men’s hockey at the olympic winter games milano cortina 2026 is set to commence this wednesday.

Iliia Malinin's early life



Iliia Malinin's career



Iliia Malinin's earnings



Ilia Malinin has become one of the most significant figures in the history of men's figure skating. Universally known by his self-coined nickname ""Quad God."" His competitive dominance has been striking. However, Malinin's significance goes beyond the stats. Ilia has highlighted an unusual appreciation for skating as entertainment, purposefully incorporating non-scoring elements, such as backflips and signature transitions, to excite audiences and increase the sport's popularity. According to Celebrity Net Worth , the American Olympian has a net worth of $1 million.Ilia Malinin was born on December 2, 2004, in Fairfax, Virginia. He comes from an elite family of skaters. Tatiana Malinina, his mother, who represented Uzbekistan in the 1998 Winter Olympics and went on to win the Grand Prix Final, and his father, Roman Skorniakov, represented Uzbekistan at the 1998 and 2002 Winter Games. Valery Malinin, his grandfather, was a Soviet athlete and coach for many years.Malinin did not take to skating right away, even with the lineage. As a child, he also preferred soccer and other activities, but his dedication began to stand out once his jumping ability did.The moment skating became a vehicle for self-expression rather than inheritance.Malinin's first significant international breakthrough marked his victory at the 2022 World Junior Championships. That victory followed a controversial setback earlier that year, when he was left off the U.S. Olympic team. The transition to senior competition came quickly. Malinin won his first senior U.S. national title and soon established himself as a regular on the Grand Prix podium.He became the first skater to land a quad axel in competition, a 4½-rotation jump long viewed as impossible under pressure. He became the only skater to do seven quadruple jumps in a single free skate, giving him a significantly higher scoring ceiling far above his rivals.Malinin popularized characteristic moves like the ""raspberry twist,"" a horizontal spin leap that was named after the translation of his Russian surname, and spectacular backflips that never win points but always electrify audiences.Malinin's career took a significant shift when he brought Hall of Fame coach Rafael Arutyunyan to his club. Under his guidance, he refined his efficiency and competitive strategy. Choreographer Shae-Lynn Bourne helped him hone his musicality and performance quality.Malinin has also emerged as the Winter Olympics' most commercially valuable figure skater. He earned roughly $700,000 over 12 months leading up to the 2026 Olympics, making him the highest-paid skater at the Games. The majority of his income has come from official Olympic sponsors, including Coca-Cola and Xfinity, with agreements structured to limit overexposure and safeguard long-term value.Athletes like Chloe Kim and Lindsey Vonn, who turned their Olympic victories into multimillion-dollar yearly salaries, have drawn comparisons to Malinin.","Ilia malinin was born on december 2, 2004, in fairfax, virginia.

The move immediately adds a veteran presence and a familiar face as the team attempts to build on a recent step forward.When the centers were announced earlier this month, fans and players created plenty of buzz in the immediate aftermath, but few reactions stood out more than current Tigers ace Tarik Skubal. The newly acquired left-hander took to the social media platform to celebrate the signing, adding some context on how pleased he was for Verlander to join the clubhouse. Detroit baseball had already delivered a lot of excitement, but his response added to the viral moments of the day.On Tuesday, the Tigers announced that Justin Verlander will once again pitch for the state of Detroit during the regular season. This one-year, $13 million deal is almost poetic for the former MVP and multi-time Cy Young Award winner.Verlander made his debut with the Tigers in 2005, developing into one of the most dominant pitchers of his generation in the Old English D.Verlander was traded away in 2017, but later accomplished even more with a few other teams. He won more titles, achieved more career milestones, and kept showing he could play with the best in the world well into his 40s. As he heads back to where it all started, Detroit is looking to his experience and leadership to help guide a burgeoning, young, talented roster back to the postseason.Number one on that celebration list was Tarik Skubal, the current guy at the front of the line in the Detroit rotation. Not long after the team announced the signing, Skubal took to X (formerly Twitter) to post an animated reaction that really summed up his excitement. Tigers fans and media outlets latched onto Verlander's exquisite self-portrait.Skubal also had a particularly weighty quip to offer, given that over the previous two seasons he's risen to become one of the better pitchers in baseball. Now the American League Cy Young winner of 2021, he has been the anchor of Detroit's rotation, and the idea of a Verlander-to-Skubal pairing immediately gained the attention of the fanbase. The respect and love the veteran commands within the game was noted by many supporting Skubal over the weekend.","Justin verlander returns to the detroit tigers on a one-year, $13 million contract.
