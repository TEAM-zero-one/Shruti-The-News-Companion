After a whirlwind summer filled with international travel and celebrity encounters, Tom Brady is back home in sunny Miami—and already turning the spotlight to someone else: his kids. The seven-time Super Bowl champion, now settled post-retirement, took to social media recently to boast about his 15-year-old son Benjamin’s impressive dunking skills. In true Brady fashion, the post wasn’t just a proud dad moment—it was a nudge to his alma mater. “He got game 100 [percent],” Brady wrote on his Instagram story. “Future Wolverine @umichbball.”It’s no secret that Tom Brady takes immense pride in his kids. While Benjamin might have inherited his dad’s height and athletic build, his interests stretch far beyond the field. Though he’s shown flashes of talent in football and basketball, he’s also a budding musician and artist. Brady once candidly recalled a moment with his then-wife Gisele Bündchen that shaped his parenting approach: “I was like, 'C'mon, let's do this. ' And he was like, 'Nope.' And I was like, 'What? No, do this!'. And Gisele kept saying to me, 'Would you effing understand that your son is different?’”The legendary quarterback admitted that this conversation was a turning point in learning to embrace his children’s unique paths.Still, Benjamin did surprise his father last year by saying he wanted to give football a shot. “My son is gonna play football this year, Benny,” Brady shared on a SiriusXM show. “He’s an amazing kid and he’s got a lot of talents. He’s a really talented musician and artist. And then he told me this year, ‘Dad, I’m playing football. ’” His dream? To be a tight end like Rob Gronkowski. “He was like, ‘Tight end. I wanna be like Gronk!’” Brady said, adding that he even passed the message to his longtime teammate: “‘My boy wants to be like you!’ And he loved it.”Brady’s oldest son Jack, 17, whom he shares with actress Bridget Moynahan, is another rising star in his own right. Whether it’s playing football or shooting hoops, Jack’s bond with his father has been endearing to fans. From viral golfing moments—“Love this boy, not sure about this game”—to courtside selfies captioned “Luckiest Dad in the world,” their connection feels authentic and deep.In a 2022 podcast with Larry Fitzgerald and Jim Gray, Brady glowed while speaking of Jack’s football journey. “I think one of the great highlights of my life is watching him play and him grow and develop... He’s way smarter. He’s got a great work ethic. He’s just a great kid. But I can definitely help him at quarterback.”As for whether either of his sons will ever follow his NFL path or blaze a trail in basketball, only time will tell. But one thing is clear—Tom Brady will be there on the sidelines, cheering the loudest.Tom Brady has three children—Jack, Benjamin, and Vivian—with two different women.Bridget Moynahan is the mother of his son Jack, while Gisele Bündchen is the mother of Benjamin and Vivian.Yes, both Jack and Benjamin have shown interest in sports, with Jack playing football and Benjamin dabbling in basketball and football.Also Read: Ciara stuns in jean shorts and Giants gear, effortlessly outshining Russell Wilson at training camp","Tom brady took to social media to boast about his son benjamin's dunking skills.

Hailee Steinfeld stirs the pot as fantasy concerns grow around Josh Allen’s draft value

Quarterbacks face declining fantasy worth as scoring systems evolve



FAQs

1. Why is Josh Allen’s fantasy football value being questioned?

2. What did Hailee Steinfeld say about Josh Allen and fantasy football?



3. Is Josh Allen still a good pick in fantasy football?



Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen may be the reigning NFL MVP, but his fantasy football stock isn’t exactly matching the hype. While fans in Buffalo still celebrate his electric 2024 season—which featured 40 total touchdowns—some fantasy analysts believe selecting Allen early in fantasy drafts could be a costly mistake, especially when considering other positional values.Interestingly, even Allen’s off-field life is catching attention. Pop star Hailee Steinfeld, Allen’s high-profile wife, has reportedly teased him over his fantasy value. While her comments remain lighthearted, they echo what many in the fantasy community are seriously debating—whether Allen is worth an early-round pick anymore.Fantasy analyst Gary Davenport of Bleacher Report added weight to this conversation by stating: “For starters, although Allen played very well last year, three quarterbacks scored more fantasy points. Also, even if the first quarterback drafted in fantasy actually finishes in that spot (which almost never happens), the edge gained by fantasy managers isn't worth the hole that taking a signal-caller this early creates at running back or wide receiver. ”The fantasy football landscape has changed in recent years. Quarterbacks no longer receive six points for passing touchdowns in most leagues, which levels the playing field and increases the risk of picking them too early.Running backs and wide receivers, due to positional scarcity and depth concerns, now offer more weekly upside—especially in PPR formats.Davenport explained this dynamic clearly: “The gap between the No. 1 quarterback (Lamar Jackson of the Baltimore Ravens) and the No. 12 quarterback in fantasy points per game (Bo Nix of the Denver Broncos) last year was 6.8 points—a smaller gap than between the 'best' and 'worst' weekly starters in the backfield and at wideout.""While Allen remains a fan-favorite and a dynamic leader for the Bills, fantasy football players may want to reconsider drafting him too early. Flashy stats and MVP trophies aside, success in fantasy leagues often comes down to smart value—not star power.Also Read: Matty Healy's mother thrashed Taylor Swift for her lyrics as Travis Kelce hard launches their relationship on Instagram Despite his MVP season, analysts say other quarterbacks outscored him and his early draft cost outweighs his fantasy return.Hailee Steinfeld reportedly joked about Allen’s fantasy value, adding fuel to ongoing concerns about drafting him too early.He’s a strong quarterback, but experts warn that drafting him early may hurt overall roster depth compared to RBs and WRs.","Despite josh allen's mvp season and 40 total touchdowns, fantasy football analysts are questioning his early draft value.

Vikings starting QB J.J. McCarthy signs fans’ jerseys at training camp facility,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/vikings-starting-qb-j-j-mccarthy-signs-fans-jerseys-at-training-camp-facility/articleshow/122961044.cms,"J.J McCarthy just spent some time bonding with fans at Vikings' training facility.

J.J. McCarthy went around Vikings' facility to sign jerseys and talk to fans

A lot is riding on J.J. McCarthy this season. The first-round pick of the 2024 NFL Draft can be pegged as the face of the season, especially after Sam Darnold’s exit. And McCarthy is starting the season on the right foot by making his fans happy! The QB went around the Vikings' facility on a sweltering day just to make fans happy.The Minnesota Vikings' camp is being held in Eagan, Minnesota, and McCarthy spent hours going around the facility to talk to fans and listen to their requests. In a video shared on social media, McCarthy can be seen wearing a red jersey right outside the facility, interacting with fans who were standing on the overhead bridge and taking jerseys and gear from them to sign. Fans on X praised his commitment to his fans, especially since it was a humid day and McCarthy spent quite a long time outside in the heat just for his fans.Although fans and top brass have shown their trust in McCarthy, he is yet to win over all his teammates, it might seem. Recently, Vikings’ wide receiver, Justin Jefferson was asked about McCarthy and he was actually slammed by fans for his underwhelming response.“He’s pretty much a rookie,” he said. “Last year pretty much doesn’t count for him. He’s still new to the scheme… You have to have that patience. You’re not really expecting him to have the same mindset as a veteran.You can’t really have that expectation from him.”It goes without saying that the Vikings have an interesting year ahead after their roster change. They did not sign Aaron Rodgers, let Sam Darnold walk away, and also split with Nick Mullens and Daniel Jones. It has become evident that Vikings consider McCarthy a long-time asset.McCarthy was unable to play in his rookie season because of a torn meniscus in his right knee. But he did show enough development to make it to 2025 training camp as the Vikings' expected starting quarterback.A few days ago, Minnesota Vikings coach Kevin O'Connell talked about a meeting he had with McCarthy to discuss future strategies. As per reports, they spent an hour meeting one-on-one in O'Connell's office.""The one thing I learned about him in those meetings is that he had great questions, and that validated that he was receiving and getting something out of that time. And as I've told him, it doesn't really guarantee you anything, but once you're fighting the fight on a daily basis of growing within the system, he would be able to rely on some of what we did together,” O’Connell said.","J.j. mccarthy went around vikings' facility to sign jerseys and talk to fans.

Why Edgecombe Stands Out

Theturned heads at the 2025 NBA Draft by selectingwith the No. 3 overall pick, and the buzz surrounding the rookie intensified when All-Star Paul George showered the young guard with praise. As the Sixers look to reshape their roster, Edgecombe is quickly emerging as a potential cornerstone of the franchise’s future.Before landing in Philadelphia, VJ Edgecombe made waves at Baylor University, where he earned Big 12 Freshman of the Year honors in the 2024-25 season. He averaged 15 points, 5.6 rebounds, 3.2 assists, and 2.1 steals per game, setting a new freshman record for steals at the school. His blend of scoring, defense, and athleticism positioned him as one of the most complete prospects in the draft.Scouts lauded his high motor and defensive tenacity, while executives took note of his maturity and professionalism - qualities that made him a perfect fit for a Sixers team hungry for young talent with immediate impact. Paul George didn’t hold back his admiration for VJ Edgecombe during a recent episode of his podcast. “We know who we’re taking. VJ’s our guy. Great kid, works hard. You got the resume. The footage backs up everything,” George said, underlining the team’s confidence in their selection.Following Edgecombe’s electrifying summer league debut—28 points, 10 rebounds, 4 assists, 2 blocks, and a steal - Paul George compared his game to a young Jimmy Butler. “He has that competitive edge. Watching him felt like observing a young Jimmy… that same mid-range aggressiveness,” he said. The comparison to Butler - a former Sixer and two-way star—highlighted the expectations surrounding Edgecombe’s development.VJ Edgecombe admitted he was caught off guard by the Sixers ’ pick, recalling, “I didn’t know till like 15 seconds before they called my name… I’m really going to Philly now.” Now, he looks forward to growing under the guidance of veterans like Paul George, Joel Embiid, and Tyrese Maxey, soaking up knowledge and embracing the challenge ahead.Edgecombe joins a promising young core in Philadelphia, alongside Tyrese Maxey and fellow rookie Jared McCain. With the team navigating injury concerns around stars like Embiid and George, the emergence of young, dynamic players could define the next phase of Sixers basketball.George’s presence adds value not just on the court but as a mentor. His vocal support for Edgecombe speaks volumes about the rookie’s potential, and his comparisons to high-character, high-impact players signal the franchise’s long-term vision.VJ Edgecombe’s selection wasn’t just about his stats - it was about his mindset. The Sixers front office praised his competitiveness, especially his refusal to let opponents score easily. That intensity, paired with his physical tools, could solve some of the team’s defensive struggles from last season.Draft analysts gave Philadelphia a respectable “B” grade for their draft class, citing Edgecombe as a great match for the team’s current needs with All-Star potential down the road.With the season fast approaching, Sixers fans are buzzing with optimism. Paul George’s high praise isn’t just lip service - it’s a sign that Edgecombe has already earned the respect of one of the league’s most respected veterans. If the rookie can channel that belief into continued growth and performance, Philadelphia may have found its next breakout star.Also read: Tyrese Haliburton Proposes to Longtime Girlfriend Jade Jones in Heartfelt Arena Moment Edgecombe’s journey is just beginning, but with strong mentorship, a relentless work ethic, and the spotlight of a passionate fanbase, the 76ers’ No. 3 pick is poised to make a lasting impact.","Philadelphia 76ers selected vj edgecombe with the no. 3 overall pick in the 2025 nba draft.

What’s Next for Dixon?

In a move to strengthen their depth ahead of the 2025-26 NBA season, thehave officially signed 6-foot-8 forward- Villanova’s all-time leading scorer. The team also welcomed three other notable players: RJ Davis, Arthur Kaluma, and Augustas Marčiulionis. The signings come as the Lakers prepare for training camp and continue shaping a roster that aims to support stars like LeBron James and newly-acquired Luka Doncic The Los Angeles Lakers confirmed the signings via a press release on Saturday, stating: “The Los Angeles Lakers have signed guard RJ Davis, forward Eric Dixon, forward Arthur Kaluma, and guard Augustas Marčiulionis.”Among the four additions, Eric Dixon stands out for his prolific college scoring career at Villanova University. Despite not being selected in the 2025 NBA Draft, Dixon agreed to terms with the Los Angeles Lakers in late June. Until recently, his status remained uncertain due to a foot injury.Dixon’s senior season stats are a testament to his scoring prowess:• Points per game: 23.3 (led the NCAA)• Field goal percentage: 45.1%• Three-point percentage: 40.7%• Rebounds: 5.1 per game• Assists: 1.9 per gameThese numbers helped him earn All-Big East First Team honors in 2024-25. His consistent performance over five seasons also earned him two All-Big East Second Team selections in earlier years.He played a program-record 162 career games, starting 141 of them, and averaged:• 14.3 points• 5.6 rebounds• 1.4 assistsover 27.5 minutes per game.Dixon’s scoring total of 2,314 points makes him the highest scorer in Villanova history - a remarkable feat for any college player.Though Dixon agreed to a deal in late June, his official signing was delayed, raising questions among fans. Trevor Lane of Lakers Nation cleared the air by saying: “There are tweets and stuff with Shams Charania saying he agreed to a contract with the Lakers, but that’s different than actually signing with the Los Angeles Lakers.”Despite missing Summer League action due to his foot injury, Dixon ultimately secured his spot with the team shortly after Lane’s remarks were published. His ability to thrive as a pick-and-pop specialist and execute strong downhill drives gives the Los Angeles Lakers a versatile offensive option with room to grow.While Dixon is expected to start his professional journey in the NBA G-League, his offensive versatility and scoring pedigree make him a player to watch. His transition from college star to pro prospect might take time, but he brings a valuable toolkit to a Lakers team focused on development and depth.Also read: Los Angeles Lakers Bring in Four Undrafted Rookies on Exhibit 10 Deals Ahead of 2025-26 Season The Los Angeles Lakers’ latest signings reflect a commitment to balancing experience with youthful upside.

Ryne Sandberg, one of baseball’s most respected second basemen and a beloved Chicago Cubs icon, passed away on July 28 at the age of 65 after a valiant fight with metastatic prostate cancer. He was revered for both his stellar career and quiet leadership. Sandberg leaves behind an indelible legacy not just in Chicago but across the entire baseball world.Known affectionately as “Ryno,” Sandberg became the heart and soul of the Cubs for over a decade and a half. Originally drafted by the Philadelphia Phillies in 1978, he arrived in Chicago through a now-legendary trade in 1982, and it changed the franchise’s fortunes.In his rookie season, Sandberg flashed his potential by hitting .271 with 32 stolen bases. But it was the 1984 campaign that truly launched him into stardom. He batted .314, led the National League in runs and triples, and captured the NL MVP award. That same year, he authored one of the most iconic games in Cubs history — the ""Sandberg Game"" — where he blasted two game-tying homers against Hall of Famer Bruce Sutter in a dramatic 12-11 win over the Cardinals.""Ryne Sandberg was a hero to a generation of Chicago Cubs fans,"" said Cubs executive chairman Tom Ricketts. ""His dedication to and respect for the game, along with his unrelenting integrity, grit, hustle, and competitive fire were hallmarks of his career.""Sandberg's career accolades are as impressive as his work ethic: 10 All-Star selections, nine Gold Gloves, seven Silver Sluggers, 282 home runs, 2,386 hits, and a .285 lifetime average. He also held the record for most home runs by a second baseman at the time of his retirement in 1997.In 2005, Sandberg was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame. His induction speech was a masterclass in humility and sportsmanship:“I was taught you never, ever disrespect your opponent or your teammates or your organization or your manager — and never, ever your uniform,” he said. “Because the name on the front is a lot more important than the name on the back.”Off the diamond, Sandberg remained close to the game.

Old Trafford cricket ground: A stadium tour of the iconic venue in Manchester

Poll Do you agree with Dale Steyn's view that an early handshake should have been offered? Yes, it's the gentlemanly thing to do. No, it's not necessary in this context.

The fourth Test between India and England at Old Trafford ended in a gripping draw, but not without drama in the final hour. As the match moved beyond any realistic result, England captain Ben Stokes and Harry Brook offered to end the game early on mutual agreement. However, Indian batters Ravindra Jadeja and Washington Sundar chose to continue batting in pursuit of their centuries.Following the game, rumours circulated suggesting that Stokes refused to shake hands with Jadeja after the match ended. While that claim has been debunked, the moment has sparked contrasting opinions from former cricketers.Among those adding their voice to the debate is former South Africa pacer Dale Steyn . In a detailed post on X, Steyn acknowledged the complexity of the situation, writing, ""This onion has many layers to it, and each one will make someone cry.""He continued, ""The only issue I see here is the one thing people aren’t realizing, the batters weren’t playing for 100s, they were batting for a DRAW. That was the goal. Draw the game.""Steyn explained that once the draw was assured and a result was out of the question, accepting a handshake would have been the sportsmanlike thing to do. ""Once that was accomplished, and a result was out of the question, a handshake was offered. That’s the gentlemanly thing to do right?""He added, ""It’s not then the time to realize they safe and now say no we’d prefer some free milestones… although within the rules, just seems a little, well, odd.""Despite this, Steyn did credit the Indian batters for their performance. ""That said, they did bat well, and maybe with the last hour approaching they should have been more aggressive in reaching those milestones. At least then, we could all agree, no team tried to outdo the other in this weird situation.""The final Test at The Oval now promises to be a charged decider, with both teams and fanbases fired up. India will look to pull off a win in the final Test while the hosts will look to seal the series in fashion with a win on the Test starting July 31.","Dale steyn believes an early handshake should have been offered to ravindra jadeja and ben stokes.

NEW DELHI: In Batumi, Georgia, the final handshake left nineteen-year-old Divya Deshmukh full of raw emotions and tears — not just for the game she had just won, but for what it meant: India, for the first time ever, had a Women’s World Cup chess champion — her closest companion in that moment were not her parents, coach or a fan, but a humble banana.Yes, a banana, untouched through the tension and triumph, now turned into the most unassuming witness to one of Indian chess’s most glorious days.In chess, White pieces traditionally hold the advantage by virtue of the first move.But Divya had the black pieces, going into the decider of Monday’s rapid tie-break against thirty-eight-year-old legendary Grandmaster (GM) Koneru Humpy, after all three previous classical and rapid games had ended in draws.The game teetered delicately, move after move, until Humpy cracked under the time pressure on move 40.Her sequence, 40.e4 followed by 41.d5, forced Divya to play 42...cxd5, and the veteran survived the first time. But it was not the last.The game stayed on a knife’s edge from there, with both players trading blunders and brilliance, led more by instinct than calculation as the clock ticked menacingly.When Humpy played 69.h7, the evaluation bar dropped again but never climbed back in her favour.Six moves later, the two-time World Rapid champion resigned. And with it came the coronation of a champion, a new queen of 64 squares, India's 88th GM.It felt like a dream that the 15th-seed teenager, with no Grandmaster norms coming into the tournament, had just become only the fourth female in India after Humpy, D Harika, and R Vaishali to achieve the distinction. But unlike the other three, she did it in one swing, without amassing the three GM norms.The playing hall rose in applause. But there, quietly soaking up all the drama, sat the banana, an omnipresent figure in Divya's games these days.It had followed the Indian prodigy through round after round, a prop that puzzled many and amused more.Let’s rewind to Sunday evening, after the draw in the second classical game of the final, Divya was eventually asked about it. “I mean, what else am I going to do with the banana? I'm going to eat it,” she answered. “I don't know what you're wondering about. I'm going to eat it, obviously.”Except, she never did.“My opponents are never letting me eat it,” she smiled, when pressed further. “If I start eating a banana, then you should know that I’m pretty relaxed in my body.”But since there was no room for relaxation, the banana became her constant in the chaos.When asked if it was proving lucky, she laughed it off with a quick “No!” But then again, we’ve all seen Rafael Nadal fuss over his water bottles and MS Dhoni with his glove rituals.Nevertheless, the banana sat just centimetres away, enjoyed the best view as Divya took down a player twice her age, earning the admiration of legends and the love of a 150-crore-strong nation.And now, while Divya may not have bitten into that, she has something far sweeter to sink her teeth into: a gold medal.Divya Deshmukh survived Batumi. So did the banana.","Divya deshmukh beat koneru humpy to become the fide women's chess world cup in georgia. Her companion through it all was a banana.

Ben Stokes press conference: On handshake controversy, India fightback, his own fitness

Legendary England cricket Geoffrey Boycott has slammed Ben Stokes and his team for showing the poor sportsmanship on the final day of the Manchester Test.Drama erupted at the start of the final hour of the match on Sunday when home skipper Ben Stokes offered to shake hands with Indian batters, realising that an outright result was not possible.Jadeja and Washington batting on 89 and 80 respectively refused the offer, leaving the England captain frustrated. Stokes later said that he made the offer since he didn't want to risk injury to his fatigued frontline bowlers.""There is no way I would have let anyone drag me off on 89 after I had worked hard all day to save the game for my team,"" Geoffrey Boycott wrote in his column for The Telegraph.""Ravindra Jadeja and Washington Sundar deserved their hundreds. They left the ball well, played with the full face of the bat and defended their wickets at all costs. Well done.""I’m not sure what it is with modern players. You hear a lot of them mouthing off. It never really happened when I was playing. It will carry on at the Oval and India will go there thinking they got a win at Old Trafford.""You learn more from failure than you do from success. And we failed to bowl India out. The draw highlighted the deficiencies in our bowling. If you think about it, when your best bowler in both innings is the England captain, who is a batsman-bowler, something is not right.""England are leading the five-match Test series 2-1.

Sunil Gavaskar

The Stokes-Jadeja controversy towards the end of the fourth Test at Manchester has led to a fierce online debate. But far worse happened in the 1983 Bangalore Test against Pakistan when skipper Zaheer Abbas had arbitrarily left the field with his team on the last day leaving opener Sunil Gavaskar stranded on 86.The TOI reported that play was interrupted for 27 minutes while Sandeep Patil wrote in his autobiography, 'Sandy Storm', that “half an hour” was wasted. Gavaskar, who was suffering from “bronchial infection” for the previous two days, his opening partner Anshuman Gaekwad and the two umpires, Madhav Gothoskar and Swaroop Kishen, stayed on the ground during this period.In his book, 'Runs ’n Ruins', Gavaskar vividly recreated the scene at the stadium. “The crowd was getting restive and impatient and had begun to boo and shout a little angrily now. The officials of the Karnataka State Cricket Association rushed to confer with both the umpires as well as the manager of the Pakistan team, Intikhab Alam.”The Times of India report detailed what had led to the Pakistan team’s exit. “Zaheer’s contention was that Pakistan had completed their quota of 77 overs for the day…. There was a great deal of wrangling over the rules before wiser counsels prevailed on Zaheer and manager Intikhab Alam…He (Zaheer) relented when the umpires pointed out that that the stipulation of 14 overs per hour in the playing condition did not apply for the last day when the mandatory overs had to be gone through,” the report said.Interestingly, the report also said that the umpires had clearly explained the law to Zaheer, fondly called Zed, in the morning. “He perhaps saw the light when it was made clear to him that the match would be awarded to India if his team did not return to the field, England captain (Ray) Illingworth had acted similarly on the tour of Australia and had to bring his team back,” TOI said. The newspaper added, ""a potentially explosive situation was thus defused. ""Despite the loss of considerable time, the light was good enough for the game to resume. “After this kind of drama one gets disturbed, especially a batsman. But Sunil, without any problem, completed his hundred,” wrote Patil. Gavaskar's description went, “When play finally did start, I managed to get to my century in the 20th (mandatory) over. As the ball streaked to the boundary, I glanced at Zaheer and he was already walking towards the pavilion along with his players and we followed. ” It was Sunny's 28th Test ton, leaving him one short of Don Bradman’s record 29 centuries. Gavaskar ended with 34 Test centuries.All-rounder Madan Lal, who was awarded MoM in that game, told TOI over phone that it was the right decision and within the rules to call the Pakistan team back. “A batsman works hard to reach a century. Why shouldn’t he be allowed to complete it?,” he asked.Not everyone in the Pakistan team condoned Zaheer’s action. “The walk-off by Zaheer had left a bad taste in the mouth and later in the evening on the flight to Delhi some of his players were critical of his actions, which they felt was unnecessary and unsporting,” Gavaskar said.For the record, the Test ended in a tame draw.","Gavaskar was left stranded on 86 in the 1983 bangalore test against pakistan.

India stay alive, England frustrated after draw; handshake drama at Old Trafford and more

NEW DELHI: Ravindra Jadeja has etched his name into cricketing folklore by equalling an iconic record held by the legendary Sir Garfield Sobers. On Day 5 of the fourth Test at Old Trafford, the Indian all-rounder brought up his fifth 50-plus score of the ongoing Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy 2025, matching Sobers' 1966 record for the most 50+ scores at No.6 or lower in a Test series in England.Both Jadeja and Sobers achieved the feat in eight innings, underlining the consistency and impact of the Indian all-rounder in the lower-middle order. Jadeja’s performance has now firmly placed him alongside the West Indian great in multiple elite lists.Jadeja also became the joint-most prolific visiting batter in England with nine fifty-plus scores at No.6 or lower — a record he now shares with Sobers. Furthermore, he is one of only two visiting cricketers to score over 1000 runs at that position in England, the other being Sobers again.Adding to his all-round dominance, Jadeja has now taken 34 wickets in England, making him only the third visiting player to score 1000+ runs and take 30+ wickets in a country, after Sobers and England great Wilfred Rhodes (in Australia).In the fourth Test, Jadeja’s unbeaten 107 was part of a heroic rearguard that saw India claw back from 0/2 to finish at 425/4, securing a hard-fought draw against England's massive 669-run first innings.Jadeja’s five fifty-plus scores in the current series is the most by any Indian batting at No.6 or lower in a single Test series, equalling VVS Laxman ’s record from 2002 in the West Indies.With 12 fifty-plus scores in SENA countries while batting lower down the order, Jadeja is now second only to MS Dhoni (13), and he’s done it in just 47 innings — an astonishing strike rate for someone long considered a bowling all-rounder.Jadeja’s current series scores — 89, 69*, 72, 61*, 20, and 107* — highlight not just consistency, but the ability to shape match outcomes under pressure. He remains central to India’s hopes ahead of the final Test at The Oval, with England leading the series 2-1.","Ravindra jadeja equalled sir garfield sobers' record of nine fifty-plus scores at no.6 or lower in a test series in england.

What happened to Christian Gonzalez at Patriots training camp?

Is Christian Gonzalez’s injury serious?

How important is Christian Gonzalez to the Patriots' 2025 season?

What’s next for Christian Gonzalez and the Patriots



The New England Patriots' training camp took a worrying turn on Monday. Star cornerback Christian Gonzalez, arguably the most important piece of the Patriots’ defense, was seen limping off the field after covering wide receiver Stefon Diggs in a drill. For a fanbase hungry for a turnaround in 2025, it was the last thing anyone wanted to see.According to ESPN’s Mike Reiss, the injury occurred during early 11-on-11 work when Gonzalez was covering Diggs on a crossing route. He made his way to the athletic training shed under his own power, which is a positive sign, but the fact that he left practice at all has raised concerns. While the Patriots have yet to release an official statement, early signs suggest it may be a leg-related issue.For New England, Gonzalez isn’t just another starter—he’s a franchise cornerstone. Drafted in the first round in 2023, he quickly developed into one of the league’s top young defensive backs. His elite coverage skills, athleticism, and football IQ made him a standout in a defense that already prides itself on discipline and structure.The Patriots are entering a transitional phase, especially on offense, with new players and a new quarterback under center.That means the defense will likely be leaned on heavily, and Gonzalez is expected to lead the secondary against high-powered AFC East offenses led by the likes of Josh Allen and Aaron Rodgers.A setback, however minor, could ripple through the defense. Depth at cornerback is still unproven, and without Gonzalez, the Patriots may struggle to contain top-tier receivers. His presence alone shifts game plans, and his absence would force New England to get creative, possibly even rethinking its coverage schemes.Christian Gonzalez appeared to suffer a leg-related injury during an 11-on-11 drill while covering Stefon Diggs. He limped off the field and headed to the athletic training shed under his own power, raising concerns among Patriots fans.As of now, the New England Patriots have not released an official injury update. However, since Gonzalez was able to walk off the field without assistance, there is cautious optimism that the injury is not severe.Christian Gonzalez is a key player in the Patriots' secondary and one of the top young cornerbacks in the NFL. His health is critical for the team's defensive success in 2025, especially with tough AFC East matchups on the schedule.There’s hope this is nothing serious. Gonzalez walking off the field is encouraging, and precautionary exits are common during training camp. Still, with just weeks until preseason games begin, fans and coaches alike will be watching closely for any updates.Also Read: Brotherhood born in bathroom: Aaron Rodgers and DK Metcalf’s hilarious bond is more than just QB-WR duo at Steelers training camp The Patriots need their top cornerback healthy and ready.
