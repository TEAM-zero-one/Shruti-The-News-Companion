The Proposed Trade: Moody for Washington

Why this trade makes sense for both teams





Theface a pivotal offseason as they balance developing young talent with maximizing Stephen Curry’s championship window. A potential trade involving Moses Moody for Dallas Mavericks forwardcould be the key to strengthening their roster.Although the Warriors' youthful nucleus of Moses Moody, Brandin Podziemski, and Jonathan Kuminga has shown promise, the squad might require more seasoned players to fight for the championship. Golden State is looking into trades to acquire playoff-tested players as Curry enters his 17th season.Key reasons for the potential move:- Curry’s timeline demands win-now moves. The Warriors lack reliable wing depth.- PJ Washington offers two-way versatility and shooting.Washington, a 6’7” forward, had a strong 2024-25 season with the Mavericks, averaging:His ability to stretch the floor and defend multiple positions makes him an ideal fit in Steve Kerr’s system. As : ""With the incoming arrival of Cooper Flagg, teams are expecting the Mavericks to make PJ Washington available on the trade market for a rotational upgrade this summer."" (H/t: Sporting News)As proposed by Evan Sidery and elaborated by Dean Simon , the Golden State Warriors could offer:- Moses Moody (young guard with potential)- Future second-round picksIn return, Dallas would send PJ Washington, giving Golden State a proven forward on an expiring $46 million deal.- Warriors get a playoff-ready wing to support Curry.- Mavericks free up space for future roster moves while adding a developmental piece in Moody.Losing Moody would be a tough decision, but the Warriors must prioritize Stephen Curry ’s remaining prime years. Washington’s experience and skill set could be the missing piece for another deep playoff run.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Josh Giddey’s $120M Payday - The Chicago Bulls’ High-Stakes Bet on Their Aussie Superstar As Dean Simon noted in the original report, Washington’s extension eligibility in August could spark a competitive trade market, making this a move Golden State should consider sooner rather than later.",The golden state warriors are reportedly considering trading moses moody and future second-round picks to the dallas mavericks for pj washington.

Oklahoma City Thunder earns Magic Johnson’s respect





The Oklahoma City Thunder sent a strong message to the league with their commanding 124-94 victory over the Minnesota Timberwolves, clinching the Western Conference title in five games. Their performance secured a trip to the NBA Finals for the first time since 2012. Further, the win also made believers out of former doubters. One of them was NBA legend and Lakers icon Magic Johnson, who issued a public apology to the Thunder after their dominant display.Los Angeles Lakers legend Magic Johnson took to X to admit he had underestimated the Thunder and praised their rise to the NBA's biggest stage. “I want to apologize to the Oklahoma City Thunder for underestimating them and not thinking they were ready to compete for a Championship,” Johnson posted. The apology came after OKC overwhelmed Minnesota in Game 5, securing a 30-point win.Johnson didn’t stop there. He gave special credit to Thunder GM Sam Presti, writing, “Oklahoma City Thunder’s fan base needs to give their GM Sam Presti a standing ovation for putting together an amazing roster!” The franchise's patience and smart drafting paid off as they outplayed the experienced Timberwolves squad at every turn.Oklahoma City set the tone early in Game 5, going on a 22-4 run and ending the first half with a 65-32 lead—their largest playoff halftime margin in franchise history, according to ESPN. They matched a playoff record with 14 steals, nine of which came before halftime. The Timberwolves, meanwhile, committed 21 turnovers and never looked locked in. Johnson pointed out their lack of urgency, posting, “The Minnesota Timberwolves did not put forth a desperation effort in tonight’s game. They had bad body language and played like they were already on vacation.”Shai Gilgeous-Alexander was once again the heart of the Thunder’s success. The All-Star guard was named the 2025 Western Conference Finals MVP, claiming the Earvin Magic Johnson Trophy. He posted 34 points, eight assists, and seven rebounds in Game 5, and previously had a career-high 40-point performance in Game 4. Over the series, he averaged 31 points, five rebounds, and eight assists per game.Johnson congratulated Shai for winning the Western Conference Finals MVP award, a trophy named in his honor. ""Congratulations to Shai Gilgeous-Alexander for winning the MVP of the Western Conference Finals named after me. What I love about Shai is that he dominates on the court and is humble off the court!"" he wrote on X.In addition to Gilgeous-Alexander, Chet Holmgren added 22 points, and Jalen Williams dropped 19. Former Laker Alex Caruso also received a shoutout from Johnson, “Congratulations former Laker and NBA champion Alex Caruso who now plays for the Oklahoma City Thunder and is headed to the NBA Finals!”Also Read: Minnesota Timberwolves vs Oklahoma City Thunder (05/28): Box score, player stats, game summary and more The Thunder will now face the winner of the Pacers-Knicks series.

But true to how he’s carried himself all year, the star guard kept the focus off himself. Speaking with ESPN’s Lisa Salters right after the win at Paycom Center, Gilgeous-Alexander chose to shine the spotlight on his team instead of celebrating his own achievement.",The oklahoma city thunder defeated the minnesota timberwolves 124-94 in game 5 of the western conference finals.

NEW DELHI: Mumbai Indians held their nerve better in a pressure-cooker Eliminator to outclass Gujarat Titans by 20 runs in a high-scoring IPL 2025 clash on Friday. Rohit Sharma (81 off 50) capitalised on early chances to play a pivotal knock, while Jonny Bairstow (47 off 22) made an instant impact on debut, powering MI to a commanding 228 for five in their 20 overs.After sealing a place in Qualifier 2, Player of the Match Rohit Sharma expressed pride in his side's all-round effort.""I have got only four fifties. Would have loved to score more fifties. Good day for us as a team. I do understand the importance of playing this Eliminator and going through this and taking the next step forward. Really proud of a complete team effort,"" Rohit said at the post-match presentation.""When I play the game, I try to do my best keeping everything aside. Making sure how I can do the job for the team. I had to make the most of the luck. I am glad I could do that. Get the team into a good position. It was going to be challenging with the dew coming. The bowlers held their nerves really well. To be honest, I have played those shots before in the tournament and found fielders.""Somewhere down the line you got to be lucky and today was that day for me. I got lucky as those catches were dropped.But even after that you got to play. I was focussing on keeping the momentum and tempo going. Was a good bowling effort.

The winner will meet Royal Challengers Bengaluru in the IPL 2025 final on June 3.Gujarat Titans, despite being erratic in the field and with the ball, managed to stay in the hunt thanks to a masterful knock from Sai Sudharsan (80 off 49), but eventually fell short at 208 for six, bowing out of the tournament.Ultimately, it was Mumbai who won the crucial moments to stay alive in the playoffs. Despite the heavy dew, chasing down such a mammoth total in a knockout match demanded something extraordinary — and Sudharsan nearly delivered just that before his dismissal in the 16th over tilted the contest.Bumrah’s trademark yorker accounted for Washington Sundar (48 off 24), and Richard Gleeson struck the decisive blow by dismantling Sudharsan’s stumps when the left-hander missed a scoop, turning the tide in MI’s favour.While he was at the crease, Sudharsan’s strokeplay was a sight to behold. In a match dominated by brute power, the elegant left-hander stood out, threading gaps with surgical precision and timing.With the equation down to 36 off 12 balls, and left-handers Rahul Tewatia and Sherfane Rutherford at the crease, MI debutant Gleeson was handed the final over with 24 runs needed.

Fernandes, who is currently 30 years old, scored 19 goals last season and is United’s key player. Al Hilal’s big money could tempt United to sell him to fix their finances. The club thinks every player has a price, but losing Fernandes could hurt their plans to rebuild the team.

Fans are worried but hope their captain will stay to help United get better.Manchester United’s money problems are serious, but selling Fernandes could cause trouble.

Travis Hunter and his wife, Leanna Lenee, have been through a lot and now, former NFL star Cam Newton has weighed in on the controversy that Hunter has been facing. Since the last few months, many fans have called Leanna Lenee a “gold digger” which even prompted her to delete her social media.

Veteran Jonathan Toews ready for NHL return with Maple Leafs reportedly in the mix,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/veteran-jonathan-toews-ready-for-nhl-return-with-maple-leafs-reportedly-in-the-mix/articleshow/121511368.cms,"David Banks/Associated Press

Jonathan Toews is back: Why the Blackhawks legend wants another shot



Why the Maple Leafs are a rumored landing spot







It’s the NHL comeback story fans didn’t know they were waiting for. Jonathan Toews — the three-time Stanley Cup champion, longtime Chicago Blackhawks captain, and one of the most respected leaders in hockey has officially signaled he’s ready to return to the ice. After two seasons away battling health issues, Toews is back in the conversation, and yes, the Toronto Maple Leafs are reportedly one of the teams on his radar. With free agency approaching on July 1, this is suddenly a headline-grabbing moment for Leafs fans and hockey followers across the league.After a decorated career in Chicago, Toews stepped away in 2023, citing struggles with Chronic Immune Response Syndrome and long COVID. It was unclear if the 36-year-old would ever lace up his skates again at the NHL level. But now, according to his agent Pat Brisson, Toews has made it clear: he’s fully committed to a return for the 2025–26 season.Brisson says he will begin taking calls from interested teams as free agency opens. That’s big news not just because Toews is a marquee name but because his return symbolizes an unfinished business on the ice.So why is Toronto even in this conversation? For starters, the Leafs need depth.With a superstar-heavy top six, the team’s bottom lines have often been where playoff series are won or lost. Adding a veteran like Toews, someone who’s been in the trenches, lifted the Cup three times, and knows how to lead in high-pressure moments could be exactly the glue Toronto’s locker room needs.It’s also worth noting that Toews wouldn’t come in as a high-scoring savior. His 2022–23 season (15 goals, 31 points) showed he’s no longer at his offensive peak, but what he brings in leadership, defensive awareness, and faceoff skill is still highly valuable. Media analysts note that Toews could be the kind of low-risk, high-upside signing that pays off in the playoffs, especially for a team desperate to break through.Also read - Winnipeg Jets lose captain Adam Lowry to hip surgery, recovery set for half a year","Chicago blackhawks captain jonathan toews has officially signaled he's ready to return to the ice.

Luka Doncic's donation restores defaced 'Mambas Forever' mural





Luka Doncic showed his support by spending $5,000 to restore a vandalized mural. The mural, “Mambas Forever,” at 14th and Main streets in downtown Los Angeles was spoiled with graffiti and Doncic expressed his anger and had the artwork repaired quickly. The donation not only paid for the restoration but also showed how much he respects Bryant and wants to help the Los Angeles community.The ""Mambas Forever"" mural, crafted by artist Louie Palsino (known as Sloe Motions) back in 2020, became a beloved homage after the tragic passing of Kobe and Gianna Bryant in a helicopter crash. The piece illustrated Kobe in his Lakers uniform, tenderly holding Gianna, who was grasping a basketball, with the words ""Mambas Forever"" painted in purple and gold. The mural had been left alone until it was recently marred by black and white graffiti, covering much of the original design. In response, Palsino initiated a GoFundMe campaign to raise $5,000 for its restoration.

Bryce Harper’s elbow injury: Latest updates

Phillies' strategy and Harper's impact





Philadelphia Phillies fans really want to know if their favorite player, Bryce Harper, will play tonight against the Milwaukee Brewers. The game starts at 6:45 p.m. ET at Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia. Harper got hurt a few days ago, and everyone’s wondering if he’ll be back for this important game. The Phillies are doing great this season, and Harper is a big part of that. Fans can watch the game on MLB Network, NBCS-PH, or FDSWI.In Tuesday's game against the Braves, Harper was hit with a blister-fast pitch on the right elbow. Hurting very much, he had to leave the game before it ended. The news was good: X-rays showed nothing broken inside the elbow area, greatly pleasing the team and its fans. Phillies manager Rob Thomson stated that Harper's elbow remained swollen and sore through Thursday, so he was out of the lineup for the day. The club is being more cautious outright, considering Harper underwent surgery on that elbow in 2022.Yesterday, Harper's elbow started feeling better, with less swelling, but he hasn’t tried hitting a ball yet. The Phillies will decide if he can play tonight just before the game at 6:45 p.m.ET. If Harper can’t play, other players like Edmundo Sosa or Alec Bohm will take his spot. Bohm might play first base. The team hopes Harper will be back soon and won’t miss too many games. They want him to be completely healthy before he plays again.Also Read: A.J. Smith-Shawver injury update: When will the Braves rookie pitcher return after manager Brian Snitker says ""doesn't look good"" The Phillies are having an awesome season, winning 34 out of 53 games so far. They've won nine of their last ten games before playing the Brewers. Harper helps a lot, hitting .267 with eight home runs and 33 RBIs this year. If he can’t play, it might make things harder against the Brewers, who have good pitchers. Manager Rob Thomson says the team is ready, with players like J.T. Realmuto and Max Kepler able to help.Harper is tough and has come back from injuries before, like after his elbow surgery in 2023. His hitting and energy are super important for big games like tonight at Citizens Bank Park. To avoid injuries in the playoffs, the Phillies likely won’t use Harper if there is any cause for concern. The game will start airing at 6:45 p.m.","Bryce harper was hit with a blister-fast pitch on the right elbow on tuesday. X-rays showed nothing broken inside the elbow area.

NEW DELHI: Royal Challengers Bengaluru stormed into their first Indian Premier League final since 2016 with a comprehensive eight-wicket win over Punjab Kings in a lopsided Qualifier 1 on Thursday. Punjab’s ultra-aggressive approach proved costly as the home side was skittled out for just 101 in 14.1 overs. RCB, still chasing their maiden IPL title despite making the finals in 2009, 2011, and 2016, made short work of the modest target. Phil Salt led the charge with a blistering 56 not out off 27 balls, taking the team home in just 10 overs.With a near-flawless performance, RCB advanced to the title clash scheduled in Ahmedabad on June 3. Punjab Kings, who returned to the playoffs for the first time since 2014, will have another shot at making the final in Qualifier 2 on June 1, also in Ahmedabad.The match, however, wasn't without controversy.RCB’s star batter Virat Kohli , who was visibly pumped up throughout the game—celebrating each Punjab Kings wicket and the team’s victory—faced criticism for an alleged inappropriate remark towards debutant Musheer Khan.The incident occurred when 20-year-old Musheer, playing his first IPL match as an Impact Substitute, walked out to bat.Also See: IPL Eliminator GT vs MI Live Score Kohli was seen gesturing something from the field, and was reportedly heard calling Musheer a ‘water-boy’, referencing the youngster having carried drinks earlier in the innings.The gesture and remark sparked a major debate on social media.Some fans online claimed that Kohli said, “Ye paani pilata hai” (“This guy carries drinks”) as Musheer prepared to face his first delivery.""Look at Virat Kohli at the first slip. Just letting him know that he's a debutant in a pretty big match. He's saying, 'who is this guy?'"" Matthew Hayden, who was on-air at the time, remarked as Musheer took guard.Kohli’s gesture toward Musheer was also caught on camera, prompting Hayden’s comment.Harsha Bhogle, who was in the commentary box alongside Hayden, added that Musheer could offer a cheeky response of his own. ""He might just turn around and say, 'you know my brother, he hit 150 playing for India',"" Bhogle said, referencing Musheer’s elder brother Sarfaraz Khan , who has shared the Test dressing room with Kohli.",Royal challengers bengaluru beat punjab kings by eight wickets in qualifier 1.

NEW DELHI: India’s batting mainstays Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma, along with ace spinner Ravichandran Ashwin, have retired from Test cricket, while star pacer Mohammed Shami will miss the crucial five-match series in England due to fitness issues.All eyes are now on the Shubman Gill-led Indian side, widely regarded as one of the most inexperienced teams to tour England in recent memory.In the absence of Kohli and Rohit, India's batting line-up appears quite thin in experience. So, could the selectors consider recalling experienced campaigners like Cheteshwar Pujara or Ajinkya Rahane , who are yet to retire from the traditional format, to strengthen the top order?During a recent interview, Pujara was asked whether Gautam Gambhir had reached out to him regarding the England tour.""No, not yet,"" Pujara told Lallantop when asked, ""Have you received a phone call from Gambhir yet?""Also See: MI vs GT IPL Live Score The 103-Test veteran expressed his readiness to return if given the opportunity.""I am ready.

The first Test against England is scheduled to begin on June 20 in Leeds.""Last year or so we have looked at Shubman (for leadership).

'I don't want to be a one-season wonder': Punjab Kings' Shashank Singh





NEW DELHI: After Mumbai Indians posted a daunting total in a crucial knockout clash, Gujarat Titans would have banked on a solid start from openers Shubman Gill and Sai Sudharsan to lay the foundation for the massive chase. However, their hopes were dashed early as skipper Shubman Gill was dismissed in the very first over by MI’s strike bowler Trent Boult , delivering a significant early setback.Boult got the ball to swing in late and at pace. Pitching full on middle and leg, the delivery tempted Gill into a pre-determined hoick across the line. He missed it completely, and the ball crashed into his pads. The umpire raised his finger immediately.Hardik Pandya roared in celebration, as did Boult and the rest of the MI camp. Gill reviewed the decision, but the replays didn’t favor him, and he walked back disappointed.Following his dismissal, fans took to social media and started trolling the Gujarat Titans skipper.Earlier, Rohit Sharma capitalised on some early luck to craft a stroke-filled 81, while Jonny Bairstow made an immediate impact on his MI debut, propelling the five-time champions to a formidable 228/5 against a sloppy Gujarat Titans outfit in the IPL Eliminator.With a surface offering less grass than the one used for Qualifier 1, Mumbai chose to bat first — and their decision paid off.Gujarat Titans were listless in the field, dropping three crucial catches — two of Rohit (81 off 50) and one of Suryakumar Yadav (33 off 20) — and offered little control with the ball.Rohit, the former captain, was dropped twice during the powerplay — first by Gerald Coetzee in the deep, and then by Kusal Mendis, who had a forgettable GT debut after fumbling a straightforward take behind the stumps off Mohammed Siraj.It was Bairstow (47 off 22) who set the tone, unleashing a flurry of boundaries to give Mumbai Indians the early momentum in the powerplay. The England batter, returning to the IPL after not featuring regularly in recent seasons, carried his county form into the game, having recently hit back-to-back fifties for Yorkshire.This marked the third straight match in which Gujarat Titans conceded a total in excess of 225 — a worrying trend for the 2022 champions.","Gujarat titans skipper shubman gill was dismissed in the very first over by mi’s strike bowler trent boult.

Poll Can Gujarat Titans overcome Buttler’s absence in the Eliminator? Yes, Mendis can rise to the occasion No, Buttler’s impact will be hard to replace

Josh Hazlewood - we picked up momentum from Jitesh’s knock in Lucknow





The Gujarat Titans will take the field in the IPL 2025 Eliminator without one of their most reliable stars—Jos Buttler, who has returned to England for international duty.Buttler’s absence, though expected, comes as a big blow. He was central to Gujarat’s top-order dominance this season, forming a formidable trio with Shubman Gill and Sai Sudharsan. Across key matches, his ability to accelerate in the middle overs and finish games gave GT much-needed stability and aggression.With England’s summer fixtures beginning in early June, Buttler has flown back to join national camp, a development that GT had been preparing for. In his place, Sri Lankan wicketkeeper-batter Kusal Mendis has been brought into the XI. Mendis, though yet to feature prominently this season, brings international experience and strokeplay that could serve Gujarat well on an unfamiliar surface in Mullanpur.GT's warm-up sessions reflected this change—Anuj Rawat kept to the bowlers, while Kumar Kushagra, also in gloves, stood behind Rawat, suggesting a shift in roles. Correspondents on ground noted that Kusal Mendis was not sighted during warm-ups, but he is confirmed in the squad as Buttler’s replacement.Quiz: Who's that IPL player? GT will hope Mendis can slot in seamlessly, though replacing a player of Buttler’s calibre in a high-pressure knockout game is no easy task.Alongside the absence of Kagiso Rabada , who has also left for South Africa duty, Gujarat’s depth will be tested. All eyes will now be on how Shubman Gill’s men adapt to these changes against a resurgent Mumbai Indians unit.","Jos buttler has returned to england for international duty.

Blending persona and personal values

Rey Mysterio reacts with pride





WWE Intercontinental Champion Dominik Mysterio has unveiled a striking new chest tattoo that pays tribute to his father, lucha libre legend Rey Mysterio. Shared via his Instagram Story after this week’s episode of Monday Night RAW, the ink represents more than just body art — it marks a deeper connection between the Mysterio family legacy and cultural symbolism.The tattoo, featuring skeletal-style wings under his collarbone, closely resembles the winged design that appears on Rey Mysterio’s iconic wrestling masks. It is also placed in the same location where Rey sports a chest tattoo with similar Aztec-style features, blending visual heritage with family homage.Known for his “Dirty Dom” persona, Dominik’s new tattoo appears to contrast sharply with his heel character in WWE storylines. While his on-screen behavior often involves taunting his father and generating crowd heat, this personal gesture reveals a more respectful and introspective side.The five-hour tattoo session resulted in a design that aligns with both wrestling history and Mexican tradition. In Aztec culture, eagle wings hold sacred meaning, symbolizing power, protection, and a spiritual warrior’s strength. This deeper message suggests Dominik may be embracing the cultural roots his father has long celebrated through his career.Despite their on-screen rivalry, Rey Mysterio has expressed pride in his son’s accomplishments. Speaking at the WrestleMania After Dark party in Las Vegas, Rey said, “As a father, that would give me the biggest sense of pride to see him as IC Champion… I would love nothing more than to step in and challenge him and see if he really has what it takes to beat his dad.”Rey is currently recovering from a groin injury suffered just before WrestleMania 41, while Dominik continues to build his reign as Intercontinental Champion.Speaking on the Intoxicados podcast , Dominik said he is focused on becoming a Grand Slam Champion in WWE. “Right now, I want to continue being the greatest Intercontinental Champion of all time… Hollywood, I’m sure one day, but as of right now, I’m definitely focused on putting the Mysterio name and Guerrero name on my back.”With personal tributes and professional ambition intertwining, Dominik Mysterio seems poised to carry his family’s legacy into a new chapter - inside and possibly beyond the wrestling ring.","Dominik mysterio has unveiled a striking new chest tattoo that pays tribute to his father.

The stage was set, the stakes high, and Rohit Sharma delivered a vintage performance when it mattered most. In the IPL 2025 Eliminator against Gujarat Titans at the Mullanpur Stadium, the Mumbai Indians stalwart smashed a timely half-century, reaching two historic milestones in the process — 7000 IPL runs and 300 sixes.Rohit opened alongside Jonny Bairstow and got MI off to a dream start. The pair added 79 runs in the powerplay without loss, attacking Gujarat’s bowlers with calculated aggression. Rohit, in particular, looked sharp from the outset, mixing timing with power in an authoritative knock.The Gujarat Titans, already missing Jos Buttler and Kagiso Rabada, were left ruing their mistakes in the field. Rohit was given two lives — both dropped catches — which proved costly as he went on to complete a fluent fifty.The experienced opener showed poise and control, anchoring the innings while continuing to find boundaries with ease.The toss went MI’s way as Hardik Pandya elected to bat first, citing scoreboard pressure and a dry surface at Mullanpur.

Poll Should Gujarat Titans invest in more young players like Sai Sudharsan? Yes, youth is the future! No, experience is key.





In a night where records tumbled at the Maharaja Yadavindra Singh International Cricket Stadium, Gujarat Titans' Sai Sudharsan etched his name into history books by becoming the youngest ever to score 700 runs in a single IPL season. The 23-year-old southpaw achieved the milestone during GT’s steep run-chase of 229 against Mumbai Indians in the IPL 2025 Eliminator on Friday.While the match largely tilted in MI’s favour—with Rohit Sharma (81) and debutant Jonny Bairstow (47) powering the five-time champions to a daunting 228/5—it was Sudharsan’s calm amidst the chaos that gave GT hope.
