Harshit Rana press conference: 'Team wants to groom me as an all-rounder'

NEW DELHI: Washington Sundar ’s decision to walk out to bat despite a visible injury during the first ODI against New Zealand in Vadodara has sparked debate around the Indian team management’s handling of injured players. Sundar was seen limping and struggling to walk but still came out to the middle when India needed support for KL Rahul in a tense chase of 301 runs.The spin-bowling all-rounder was risked despite his fitness concerns, and the move backfired as his injury worsened. Sundar remained unbeaten on 7 off 7 balls in the series opener, playing a supporting role as Rahul guided India to a four-wicket win. However, shortly after the match, Sundar was ruled out of the remainder of the series and was replaced by Ayush Badoni.Sundar’s appearance at the crease raised several questions, particularly about the Gautam Gambhir-led team management’s approach to player welfare. Among those critical of the decision was former India cricketer Mohammad Kaif , who openly questioned the logic behind sending an injured player into the middle.Kaif pointed out what he described as a double standard, drawing parallels with Shubman Gill ’s injury management during the South Africa Test series.He reminded the Indian team management that Gill was rested and not allowed to bat to prevent aggravation of his injury.""You will remember when Shubman Gill was injured, he did not come out to bat in that Test match, the Kolkata Test. It was a high-scoring game and people thought that even 20 or 30 runs from him could help India win, but he still did not bat. That was done to give full protection to the player so the injury would not aggravate. But the same approach was not applied with Sundar. That is why I feel it was a wrong call. KL Rahul's running between the wickets was affected. Even though India won the match, I feel there were higher chances of aggravating the injury in yesterday's game,"" Kaif said on his YouTube channel.Kaif further explained why sending Sundar in such a situation carried unnecessary risk.""If he is injured and you need runs at a run-a-ball, you should first try someone else. When a player is injured and you send him in under pressure, the injury can worsen. He couldn't run doubles even though the ball was going to deep point or square leg, and he was only managing singles. Although the required run rate was around a run-a-ball and the match was under control, I felt that sending an injured player was risky. What might have been a one-week or ten-day injury could stretch to 20, 25, or even 30 days,"" he added.""I believe that was a wrong call. You could have sent Kuldeep, or anyone else, even Siraj or Prasidh Krishna, if you just needed to play out the run-a-ball situation. Only when it becomes absolutely unavoidable, right at the end, should you send Washington Sundar,"" Kaif asserted.Sundar is part of India’s squad for the T20 World Cup 2026, which begins on February 7, making his fitness a key concern going forward.","Washington sundar was seen limping and struggling to walk but still came out to bat.

Travis Kelce’s seating rule says more than any wedding detail

Engagement Advice, Birds Banner Night, Chiefs in Brazil & Season Preview with Alex Smith | EP 152

When wedding bells loom, most couples start with colors, venues, or guest lists. Travis Kelce, however, has zeroed in on something far more revealing. The Kansas City Chiefs star is already thinking about how people will interact once they sit down, laugh, and spend hours together. It is not about numbers or status. It is about chemistry.As his engagement to Taylor Swift continues to dominate headlines, Kelce’s comments have offered fans a rare glimpse into how seriously he approaches personal relationships. Even before venues or menus enter the picture, the focus is on creating a room that feels natural, warm, and drama free.On New Heights with Jason and Travis Kelce, a casual question turned into a telling moment. When asked if members of the podcast team would make the guest list, Kelce laughed it off before delivering an unexpectedly thoughtful answer..“Bachelor party, man, how do you even know there's a bachelor party coming?” he said. He followed with, “I haven't thought about it one second. But I invite you guys everywhere.”.The tone shifted when the conversation turned to the wedding itself. Kelce explained his philosophy without hesitation.“You know, we're going to see how it all shakes out because I don't want to put them at a table that they wouldn't mesh with, so I would just probably not invite them at all if that was the case.”That mindset reflects how the couple has handled their engagement so far. Travis Kelce recently shared how meaningful it felt introducing Taylor Swift as his fiancée to teammates, calling the experience exciting and personal. “It's been really fun telling everybody who I'm going to be spending the rest of my life with,” he said. “It was my first time introducing Taylor as my fiancée to a few of my teammates.

Milwaukee Bucks vs Minnesota Timberwolves Tip-Off and Context (January 13, 2026)

The Minnesota Timberwolves travel to Milwaukee on January 13, 2026, to face the Bucks at Fiserv Forum. On paper, this game looks like a clash between two teams with playoff expectations. In reality, it is a test of who can survive with what remains of their rotation.Injuries and a suspension have stripped both sides of important contributors. With lineups shortened and roles expanded, this game is less about star power and more about execution, minutes management, and which team avoids mistakes.Minnesota Timberwolves will be without Anthony Edwards, who is sidelined due to foot injury management. His absence removes the team’s leading scorer. Rudy Gobert is also unavailable after receiving a one-game suspension for accumulated flagrant foul points.The injury list does not end there. Terrence Shannon Jr. remains out with a left foot abductor strain, while Enrique Freeman and Rob Dillingham are also unavailable. With limited options, the Timberwolves will rely heavily on Julius Randle, Naz Reid, Jaden McDaniels, and Donte DiVincenzo to carry extended minutes on both ends of the floor.Milwaukee Bucks also enters the game short-handed. Taurean Prince is out following neck surgery, though some reports describe the injury as a herniated disk. Myles Turner is listed as questionable due to illness, which could affect the Bucks’ frontcourt depth if he is unable to play.What Milwaukee does have is a healthy Giannis Antetokounmpo, who remains the focal point of the offense. He will be supported by Kevin Porter Jr. and Ryan Rollins, both of whom have taken on larger roles this season.Randle is averaging 21.1 points, 6.7 rebounds, and 5.4 assists, while Reid adds 16.0 points, 6.9 rebounds, and 2.8 three-pointers per game. Minnesota also loses Gobert’s 11.4 rebounds per night.For the Milwaukee Bucks, Antetokounmpo is posting 29 points, 9 rebounds, and 5.7 assists. Porter Jr. averages 17.7 points, 7.6 assists, and 2.2 steals, while Rollins contributes 14.8 points and 2.3 made threes. Turner, if available, brings 11.8 points and 1.4 blocks.The game tips off at 8 p.m. ET (7 p.m. CT) on Tuesday. It will air on FanDuel Sports Network, TNT, NBA League Pass, and Fubo.Minnesota enters around 26-14, built on defense but missing key pieces. Milwaukee sits near 17-23 and leans heavily on Giannis. With rotations thin on both sides, this game is likely decided by which supporting cast holds up longer.","Minnesota timberwolves will be without anthony edwards, who is sidelined due to foot injury management.

Mike Tomlin daughter Harley Tomlin shines beyond the NFL spotlight



Mike Tomlin’s daughter Harley Tomlin stepped into the national conversation as news of the Steelers icon walking away reshaped both football and family focus. The unexpected shift sent ripples through Pittsburgh, but it also pulled fresh attention toward a young athlete building her own name far from the NFL sidelines. The timing felt poetic. As one chapter closed after nearly two decades of leadership, another gained momentum under bright arena lights. Harley Tomlin, already climbing within college gymnastics, suddenly found her journey intersecting with a historic moment in pro football.A late and unexpected vacancy has spun the NFL's offseason coaching carousel into overdrive. Mike Tomlin is stepping down from the Pittsburgh Steelers after a 19-year run leading the storied organization, the team announced Tuesday. Steelers president Art Rooney II confirmed the decision, sharing Tomlin’s words after the Wild Card loss to Houston.""During our meeting today, coach Tomlin informed me that he has decided to step down as our head coach,"" Steelers President Art Rooney II said in a statement. ""Obviously, I am extremely grateful to Mike for all the hard work, dedication and success we shared over the last 19 years. It is hard for me to put into words the level of respect and appreciate I have for coach Tomlin.He guided the franchise to our sixth Super Bowl championship and made the playoffs 13 times during his tenure, including winning the AFC North eight times in his career. His track record of never having a losing season in 19 years will likely never be duplicated.”With more time suddenly available, Tomlin’s role as a proud father has come into sharper focus. His sons, Dino and Mason, carved their own football paths, but Harley has long held a special place in his heart. ""Even my boys know that Harley is my favorite. #GirlDad"" -- Tomlin tweeted in 2020.Harley’s gymnastics roots run deep. Her mother Kiya, a former collegiate gymnast, passed along both technique and toughness. Now a sophomore at Georgia, Harley is thriving. She helped the GymDogs defeat No. 21 Ohio State, opening lineups with confidence and posting a career high 9.875 on the beam. Her earlier debut told the same story. Big stage. Calm execution.Tomlin once called her the “best athlete in the house no doubt”, praise that feels earned rather than sentimental. With Georgia set for seven nationally televised meets this season, Harley Tomlin is not borrowing attention from her last name. She is commanding it, one composed routine at a time.Also Read: Drake Maye’s wife Ann Michael sparks curiosity with ‘baby steps’ post that quietly grabs fans’ attention","Pittsburgh steelers head coach mike tomlin is stepping down after 19 years.

Drake Maye wife Ann Michael draws attention with subtle TikTok moment

Drake Maye's wife Ann Michael has quietly become one of the most talked about figures in New England, sharing the spotlight with the Patriots quarterback during a remarkable season. As Drake Maye continues to command national attention with his calm control and sharp decision making, fans have also turned their eyes toward the woman who has stood beside him since childhood. Her presence adds a personal layer to a year already filled with momentum and belief.The Patriots did not reach a 14-3 finish by accident. Maye’s leap in his second season reshaped expectations and pushed the franchise back into the AFC title conversation. Yet behind the wins and headlines sits a story rooted in patience, loyalty, and shared growth. Ann Michael Maye has been part of Drake’s journey since they were 12 years old. Their bond began long before sold out stadiums, draft buzz, or playoff pressure entered the picture.Ann Michael Maye has built her own following through TikTok, where fans often see her baking, preparing for game days, and sharing quiet slices of life.Her latest post, released on January 13, sparked curiosity for its soundtrack choice. She paired her full game day routine with Olivia Dean’s song “Baby Steps,” a detail that did not go unnoticed by a fan base always reading between the lines.The meaning remains open. Some viewers saw it as a gentle nod to progress, a reminder that even Super Bowl runs happen one step at a time. Others believe it was simply a song she enjoys. Neither Drake nor Ann Michael has hinted publicly about expanding their family, despite natural speculation given their long history and recent marriage in the summer of 2025. The post felt personal, not performative, which only deepened the intrigue.What is not subtle is the support they show each other. After the Patriots’ January 11 win over the Los Angeles Chargers, Drake made sure to acknowledge his wife while speaking to reporters. “And obviously Ann Michael, can't forget about her,” Drake said with a smile on his face while telling reporters about his family's attendance at the game.In a season defined by growth and belief, the Mayes continue to move forward together. Sometimes, as Ann Michael’s post suggests, progress really does come in baby steps.Also Read: Aaron Rodgers retirement: Steelers playoff collapse raises serious questions as veteran QB dodges direct answers about what comes next","Drake maye's wife ann michael has quietly become one of the most talked about figures in new england.

Anthony Davis gets a major injury update



Anthony Davis trade speculation intensifies



There has been a new development surrounding Anthony Davis ’ injury update. Trade chatter around Davis surged again this week as new injury details extended the speculation about how teams view his availability and value. Reports out of Dallas suggested a clearer recovery window for the Mavericks star, opening the door to renewed conversations ahead of the February 6 trade deadline.The timing of all rumors surrounding the trade aligned perfectly with AD’s consistent injuries. Davis remains sidelined with ligament damage in his left hand, yet league insiders now see a path that keeps both Dallas and rival front offices engaged rather than resigned.The sudden shift triggered a swift and public response from Davis. As speculation spread across platforms, the 32-year-old also fired back. He challenged the accuracy of circulating timelines and assumptions.ESPN’s Shams Charania reported that Anthony Davis will not need immediate surgery and is expected to miss at least six weeks before a re-evaluation. That update softened earlier fears of a season-ending absence and aligned with Marc Stein’s reporting that there is internal belief Davis could return around March.Stein wrote, “There is some optimism in Dallas that Anthony Davis could return at some point in March, even if he is forced to undergo surgery on his left hand. ”Charania also framed how rival teams interpret that window. “These are teams that feel like, ‘OK, maybe Anthony Davis has a chance to return during the playoffs’ and also could have a long-term future with said team for the next two to four years,” he said on ESPN’s NBA Today. The injury occurred late against Utah while Davis defended Lauri Markkanen, yet he finished with 21 points and 11 rebounds, reflecting how effective he remains when available.As trade noise grew louder, Davis addressed the rumors directly on X. “Y’all better stop listening to all these lies on these apps!” The message appears to be aimed at days of conflicting reports and signaled his intent to control the narrative around his recovery.Dallas continues to evaluate options without urgency. Davis has played 29 regular-season games for the franchise and remains under contract with significant salary commitments ahead, including a $62.7 million player option. He is also eligible for a major extension this summer.League interest has not faded. Charania noted on X, “The Mavericks are having renewed Davis trade talks with multiple interested teams,” pointing to a market that still believes in his impact if he returns in time for meaningful games. For now, Dallas gathers medical clarity, and Davis focuses on rehab.Also Read: ""Stop listening to lies"": Anthony Davis responds after reports suggest hand surgery could impact his season",Anthony davis is expected to miss at least six weeks with ligament damage in his left hand.

Ravens head coach search: AFC North rival emerges as surprise favorite to replace John Harbaugh,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/ravens-head-coach-search-afc-north-rival-emerges-as-surprise-favorite-to-replace-john-harbaugh/articleshow/126511138.cms,"Image via IMAGN

Why Kevin Stefanski is suddenly in the mix

A bold but calculated move

Also Read:

The Baltimore Ravens are officially in unfamiliar territory. After moving on from long-time head coach John Harbaugh, Baltimore has begun a high-stakes search for its next leader and a surprising name from within the AFC North is now emerging as a serious favorite. According to ESPN Insider , former Cleveland Browns head coach Kevin Stefanski is gaining strong traction inside league circles as a potential replacement. The idea of a division rival stepping into the Ravens’ locker room may seem bold, but the logic behind it is becoming increasingly clear.Stefanski’s resume quietly checks many of the boxes Baltimore is prioritising. During his time in Cleveland, he was widely respected as a calm, detail-oriented leader with a strong offensive background. While his Browns tenure had mixed results, many around the league believe he was limited more by instability at quarterback than by coaching ability.That context matters because in Baltimore, Stefanski would inherit one of the NFL’s most dynamic players in Lamar Jackson.Unlike his time in Cleveland, where Stefanski cycled through multiple starting quarterbacks, the Ravens job offers something rare: a true franchise QB in his prime.League executives believe the chance to build an offense fully around Jackson’s strengths could be extremely appealing to the former Browns coach.Another factor working in Stefanski’s favor is familiarity. He has faced Baltimore twice a season for several years and understands the Ravens’ roster, culture, and defensive identity.

In the podcast, Dreger stated, “I know that trade talk around certain individuals with the Vancouver Canucks has elevated of late, and maybe that's coming off the weekend loss in Toronto, and they're getting set for the Montreal Canadiens here.”He further stated, “That's not what the Canucks are trying to do here. So use any 'r' word you want: renovate, retool, rejig, whatever. It doesn't matter, but they're moving pieces. For sure, they are… And I think, for the most part, Alvin and Jimmy Rutherford are open to any communication about just about any player.”Speculations suggest that the potential trade targets include veteran defenseman Tyler Myers, with a $3 million cap hit and one year left. Another player includes a forward like Jake DeBrusk, and others such as Evander Kane.Meanwhile, on the ice, the Canucks also suffered a 6‑3 loss to the Montreal Canadiens on Monday.

Why Justin Sourdif’s absence matters for Washington Capitals right now



Capitals' Justin Sourdif Tallies Three Goals For First Career Hat Trick

The Washington Capitals are once again facing the problem of injuries, as Justin Sourdif's presence or absence is the main issue to discuss before their duel against the Montreal Canadiens. As changes in the lineup are about to happen and the fight for the playoffs is still on, the team from Washington is compelled to modify its plans again; thus, the condition of Sourdif is a pressing issue for the coach and the fans alike.The Sourdif injury is an issue that the Capitals have to face, and it is quite serious, especially with the Canadiens coming to Capital One Arena. The situation is changing dynamically, and the Capitals are careful, realizing that short-term injuries can develop into long-term ones very quickly during a congested schedule.Capitals head coach Spencer Carbery has announced that Justin Sourdif is day-to-day and that he will be absent after suffering an upper-body injury during his encounter with the Nashville Predators. The incident took place in the second period when a puck that had been deflected hit Sourdif in the face during a forecheck, thus sending him to leave the game prematurely. He was on the ice for a very short time and did not come back as Washington lost 3-2.Sourdif's absence presents a bad scenario as he has been one of the key contributors among Washington's forwards recently. The 23-year-old has accumulated 10 points in his last seven games and is having a breakout year in his first full NHL season. After playing 45 games, he has scored nine goals and made ten assists, besides being a major contributor defensively, as is shown by his +15 rating.Connor McMichael is likely to move to center with Sourdif being out, and Sonny Milano will come back to the team. If the injury lasts longer than expected, then a call-up is still an option. On the other hand, Jakob Chychrun is a decision of the day because of sickness, while Tom Wilson is still out, but Carbery said he is “getting closer” to coming back.The Capitals have to depend on their flexibility and depth to remain competitive as injuries keep piling up. The situation of Sourdif will be watched closely, as his coming back could give a timely boost to Washington’s fight to stay in the Eastern Conference.Also Read: Detroit Red Wings retire Sergei Fedorov’s iconic No. 91 jersey, closing a long‑awaited chapter","Justin sourdif is sidelined with an upper-body injury.

How will Erik Karlsson’s two-week absence affect Pittsburgh Penguins’ defense?

Which players were called up or sent down as injuries impact multiple NHL teams?

The Pittsburgh Penguins have put Erik Karlsson on the injured reserve list due to a lower-body injury, and he will not be activated until two weeks later, creating a huge void in the defense. Such a situation is being experienced by the Penguins as they are going through the phase of injuries to star players, just like the Tampa Bay Lightning and Seattle Kraken.Aside from Karlsson, there are other players experiencing roster changes due to injuries or personal issues. The AHL has sent Ryan Graves and Tristan Broz to support Pittsburgh, while in Tampa Bay, Brayden Point sustained a lower-body injury while scoring, and Chandler Stephenson from Seattle has finished his personal leave. These shifts have consequences for team rotations and strategies just before the Olympic break.Erik Karlsson, the veteran defenseman, who has achieved four goals and 29 assists, thus totaling 33 points, in 44 games, is going to be out for a minimum of two weeks because of a lower-body injury. He spent more than 23 minutes on the ice during Pittsburgh's last game against Boston, then he left the rink. The Penguins can not afford to lose Karlsson right now since it will be the turning point of the season, so they have to change the patterns of their defense and use their remaining defenders more while passing through the tough schedule that leads up to the Olympic break.Ryan Graves and Tristan Broz have been called up from the AHL to join the Pittsburgh lineup to support their defense and the center positions. On the other hand, Rafael Harvey-Pinard was demoted to the minors after not being included in the active player pool for recent games. In Tampa Bay, Brayden Point got a lower-body injury after scoring and had to leave Philadelphia. His recovery will be under careful observation. For Seattle, Chandler Stephenson came back from personal leave, while Oscar Fisker Mølgaard was sent down to the AHL.Erik Karlsson’s injury is bad luck for the Penguins, but bringing back Graves and Broz reveals the team’s ability to cope with difficult situations. The next few weeks of the Penguins’ performance will be monitored with great interest, and each game will be important to stay in the standings race.Also Read: Detroit Red Wings retire Sergei Fedorov’s iconic No. 91 jersey, closing a long‑awaited chapter","Pittsburgh penguins have put erik karlsson on the injured reserve list due to a lower-body injury.

What problems did NHL find during Milan Olympic hockey test run?

Milan’s beleaguered Olympic hockey arena gets 1st test

The NHL, the Milan Winter Olympics, the Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena, and the Olympic hockey preparations have all become topics of interest after NHL officials, including Commissioner Gary Bettman, inspected the site during its first test events. With NHL players getting ready for their Olympics return, the league is very interested in monitoring the ice quality, construction progress, and player safety in Milan. It was a critical checkpoint ahead of the international competition that representatives from the NHL and the NHL Players’ Association (NHLPA) were on site to make the evaluation.At the time of the arena’s first obligatory test run, Santagiulia hosted Italian Cup games as part of its pre-Olympic preparations, and that is where the worry started. The organizers conceded that the venue would not be entirely ready before the onset of the women’s tournament, although the officials were confident that the ice surface would be fit for play. That guarantee was quickly put to the test as some of the visible problems arose during competitive play.As per ESPN, the executives of the NHL and NHLPA were present at the observation of seven Italian Cup games during the period of January 9 to 11.These games included the semifinals and finals. Officials categorized the occurrence as a ""good trial run,"" yet the worries came up right after that. Right before that particular game, a pit in the ice layer had appeared and had to be mended before the start of the game. The league accepted that such situations might happen with fresh ice, especially in the case of venues that are still being constructed.Later on, Commissioner Gary Bettman mentioned that these difficulties were anticipated given the conditions, and he added that the local organizers have assured the league that all the remaining work will be done on time. In support of those efforts, the NHL has provided ice specialists who are going to be based in Milan for the purpose of assisting with preparation. IIHF President Luc Tardif has also shown his faith and said that ice quality and player safety are the main concerns.Concerns are still there due to the ice not being ready, also locker rooms not being finished, seating capacity being reduced, and the rink not meeting NHL size standards. The inspection will go on.With Olympic hockey piling up, the NHL’s attention on Santagiulia is a reflection of how much it is for the world’s best players to be in perfect conditions.Also Read: Detroit Red Wings retire Sergei Fedorov’s iconic No. 91 jersey, closing a long‑awaited chapter","Nhl officials, including commissioner gary bettman, inspected the site during its first test events.

Jon Cooper remains the greatest coach for Tampa Bay Lightning with recent milestone

Also Read:

Jon Cooper etched his name further into NHL history Monday night when the Tampa Bay Lightning defeated the Philadelphia Flyers 5-1, giving the veteran coach his 600th career victory. The milestone came in Cooper's 1,005th game behind the bench, making him the second-fastest coach to reach 600 wins in league history.Only Hockey Hall of Famer Scotty Bowman reached the mark faster, accomplishing the feat in 1,002 games with the St. Louis Blues and Montreal Canadiens. Cooper becomes the 25th coach in NHL history to hit the 600-win plateau, joining an elite group that includes only three other active coaches above that threshold.Every single one of Cooper's 600 victories has come with Tampa Bay, a remarkable display of longevity and sustained success with one organization. The 58-year-old Prince George, British Columbia, native was hired as Lightning head coach in March 2013 after Guy Boucher was fired and has built a dynasty in Florida.His winning percentage has been a testament to his strategic mind, as in the 1005 games that the Lightning played under him, they've lost just 319 games.Not to mention, he also led the franchise to back-to-back Stanley Cups in 2020 and 2021 while also making it to the finals twice more in 2015 and 2022.He transformed the side from a mid-table team to a constant playoff contender and raised the competition in the Atlantic Division. However, what really makes his time in Tampa special is how long he has managed to remain the head coach.In an era where your average tenure as a coach lasts barely 2.5 years, he's been leading the Lightning for the past 12 seasons. In those 12 years, he's missed the playoffs just once. His recent victory over the Philadelphia Flyers on Monday just proved why.Brandon Hagel, Jake Guentzel, and Nikita Kucherov each recorded a goal and an assist in Monday's victory, helping the Lightning extend their winning streak to 10 games. The win keeps Tampa Bay second in the Atlantic Division with a 28-13-3 record.Cooper's coaching excellence extends beyond the NHL. He won the Calder Cup with the Norfolk Admirals in 2012 and recently guided Team Canada to victory at the 4 Nations Face-Off. He will serve as head coach for Canada at the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milan.Despite his remarkable success, Cooper has never won the Jack Adams Trophy as coach of the year, having been a finalist twice. The milestone victory came during his 1,000th game week with the Lightning, cementing his status as one of the greatest coaches in franchise history.","Jon cooper becomes the 25th coach in nhl history to hit the 600-win plateau.

This year’s NHL scoring race has been one of the most thrilling years. Gone are the days when Connor McDavid single-handedly dominated the charts. This year, his Canadian teammate and Avalanche star Nathan Mackinnon has also entered the discussion.The two veterans are separated by just one point, with Mackinnon (81) currently holding the lead over McDavid (80). Meanwhile, rookie sensation Macklin Celebrini has also impressed the critics this season as he tries to break his way into the claim for the Art Ross Trophy.MacKinnon has picked up right where he left off after winning the Hart Trophy in 2023-24. With 81 points (36 Goals, 41 Assists) across 45 games this season, he has been in sensational form. His two-way play has even helped the Avs maintain a 33-4-8 record as they sit atop the Central Division.He rarely experiences extended slumps and maintains production even when the Avalanche struggles as a team. That reliability has helped him build a slim lead in the scoring race. However, that doesn’t mean he has an undisputed claim to the Art Ross Trophy.McDavid sits just one point behind MacKinnon with 80 points through the same number of games.The Edmonton Oilers captain remains on pace for another remarkable season despite the razor-thin margin.The 29-year-old continues rewriting the record books with his otherworldly offensive production. McDavid has won the Art Ross Trophy five times in his career and appears destined to challenge for a sixth scoring title this season.His ability to create offense from seemingly nothing separates McDavid from every other player in the league. The generational talent routinely makes plays that leave opponents and fans alike shaking their heads in disbelief. But just behind Mackinnon and McDavid is a name no one expected.Macklin Celebrini remains the most shocking member of this three-man race. Trailing considerably behind the two former MVP winners, the 19-year-old has scored 70 points through the first half of the season. He remains the sole driving force behind the Sharks this season.With the youngster already making his way to the Team Canada roster, the fans remain thrilled about just how far he can push. Many even believe that if by any miracle San Jose does make the playoffs, Celebrini poses the best argument for the Hart Trophy.While other veterans like Nikita Kucherov (67) and McDavid’s linemate Leon Draisaitl (64) are also in the top five, most experts believe that the race will be limited to the first two men.

Why India need leader Shreyas Iyer for 2027 World Cup | Greenstone Lobo prediction

NEW DELHI: Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma continue to play an active role in India’s long-term plans for the ODI team, including preparations for next year’s World Cup, batting coach Sitanshu Kotak said on Tuesday.Kotak said both batters, who remain central to India’s 50-over batting line-up, are fully aligned with the team management, including head coach Gautam Gambhir ""They definitely make plans. Now that they're playing only one format, they want India to win everywhere when they are there,"" Kotak said on the eve of India’s second ODI against New Zealand.""With the amount of experience they have, they can share a lot of ideas with other players, and they do discuss. They discuss with Gautam the ODI format, the matches that we have and our plans for South Africa.""Kotak added: ""Most of the time I'm there and if I'm listening, they definitely share the experience and I always see them talking. Obviously, on social media, you see a lot of things which I try to avoid seeing. But (from) what I see, there are a lot of positives.""The relationship between Kohli, Rohit and the new coaching setup has been under discussion recently, particularly after India’s struggles in Tests and both batters’ decision to step away from red-ball cricket before last year’s England tour.Kotak said India would need to revise its ODI batting strategy once the T20 World Cup concludes in March, taking into account the new one-ball rule after the 34th over. Under the new rule, bowling teams must select one of the two balls to continue from overs 35-50.""It's still a huge difference between T20Is and ODIs. More or less every game is going over 300, particularly in India. We see more 300-plus scores and then (at times) you're chasing as well,"" Kotak said.""After (the) T20 World Cup, I think there'll definitely be more ODIs. We'll have to set up one template as to how we play after this new rule of (having) 34 overs only have one ball.""Kotak also explained the rationale behind Ayush Badoni’s maiden call-up when Washington Sundar was ruled out.""He’s been performing and it’s (the) selectors who pick the team. If we had only five bowlers (in first ODI) and Washington got injured on fourth (or the) fifth over, then who would have bowled those overs?,"" Kotak said.""Somebody should be able to bowl four-five or (even) three-four overs, whatever (the situation) requires. I think that would be the reason (for his selection) and he has scored runs (and) he can bowl. He's been performing in IPL also,"" he added.Kotak dismissed concerns over Badoni’s recent lack of runs in the Vijay Hazare Trophy, saying a few low-scoring innings do not matter.“Our boys, (the) amount of cricket they play, I don't think for any batter two (or) three innings would make any difference, and it shouldn’t,"" he said.","Virat kohli and rohit sharma continue to play an active role in india’s long-term plans for the odi team, says batting coach sitanshu kotak.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan once again found themselves in an uncomfortable spotlight in the Big Bash League. Just a day after Mohammad Rizwan’s unusual “retired out” moment, Hasan Ali added to the embarrassment with a poor piece of fielding on Tuesday.The incident happened during the match between Melbourne Stars and Adelaide Strikers, with the Stars were chasing a small target of 84 runs. They were 35 for 2 in the eighth over. Tabraiz Shamsi was bowling. The fifth ball was pushed towards the cover region.Hasan Ali ran in to stop the ball before it reached the boundary. However, he misjudged it badly. And despite him giving his all till the last moment, the ball slipped past and crossed the rope.The third umpire later confirmed it was a boundary. The moment quickly went viral, with social media accounts of both Fox Sports and Big Bash League sharing the video.This came just one day after another awkward episode involving a Pakistan player.On Monday, Mohammad Rizwan was retired out during a Big Bash League match between Sydney Thunder and Melbourne Renegades.Rizwan struggled to score quickly near the end of the innings.He made 26 runs off 23 balls. His knock included two fours and one six.Failing to add momentum, Rizwan was called back by the Renegades.Captain Will Sutherland replaced him at the crease. Rizwan became the first overseas player in BBL history to be retired out.On Tuesday, the match itself was a one-sided affair. Tom Curran produced a career-best bowling performance to help Melbourne Stars crush Adelaide Strikers. The Strikers were bowled out for just 83 runs in 19.3 overs.Curran’s spell with the new ball caused early damage. The Strikers were reduced to 21 for 4 by the end of the powerplay. A small partnership between Jamie Overton and Liam Scott briefly lifted the score near 40. The collapse soon followed.Chasing 84, the Stars lost early wickets. Sam Harper made nine.

Virat Kohli is one big innings away from setting a new Indian record as India face New Zealand in the second ODI at Rajkot on Wednesday.The 37-year-old has scored five consecutive fifty-plus scores in ODIs. The sequence began in the final ODI against Australia in Sydney and continued in the first ODI against New Zealand in Vadodara, where he scored 93 off 91 balls with eight fours and one six. He scored at a strike rate of over 100.With five successive fifty-plus scores, Kohli is currently level with Sachin Tendulkar, Rahul Dravid, Rohit Sharma and Ajinkya Rahane among Indian batters. A half-century in Rajkot would make him the first Indian batter to record six consecutive fifty-plus scores in ODIs.At the global level, Pakistan’s Javed Miandad leads the list with nine successive fifty-plus scores in ODIs, followed by Imam-ul-Haq with seven. Players who have achieved six successive fifty-plus ODI scores include Kane Williamson, Shai Hope, Babar Azam, Paul Stirling, Ross Taylor and Chris Gayle.In his last five ODIs, Kohli has scored 469 runs at an average of 156.33, including two hundreds and three fifties.If his two innings in the Vijay Hazare Trophy for Delhi are added — scores of 131 and 77 — he has seven straight fifty-plus scores in List A cricket. Across these seven innings, he has scored 677 runs at an average of 135.4, with three centuries and four fifties.India began the series with a four-wicket win over New Zealand in Vadodara. However, Washington Sundar has been ruled out of the rest of the series due to a side strain.The selectors have named Delhi all-rounder Ayush Badoni as his replacement.

LONDON: Former England cricketer Stuart Broad rubbished the talks of the England men's team indulging in heavy drinking during their Ashes tour to Australia, saying that senior players are not ""party animals"" and just a ""couple of guys who made mistakes"" got viral across all media.England lost the Ashes Down Under by 4-1, snapping their 18-match winless streak in Australia at Melbourne, Joe Root's two centuries, which broke his Test ton duck in Australia and the rise of Jacob Bethell towards the back end of the series being the key positives.However, after the Ashes were lost during the Adelaide Test, a few clips of opener Ben Duckett seemingly drunk and Jacob Bethell partying went viral on social media, which seemed to be coming from their trip to Noosa after the loss at Brisbane in the second Test. The pictures did not go down well with several English fans, and players were trolled for their off-field indulgences.Speaking on the For the Love of Cricket podcast with co-host and star batter Jos Buttler, Broad said, ""I look at this England team, they are not drinking. I have seen loads of things about a drinking culture, but there is not one. (Zak) Crawley, (Ollie) Pope, (Ben) Stokes, (Joe) Root, they are not really drinkers.They are not party animals.""Broad said it was just a couple of guys making mistakes and them surfacing in the media, and it is upto the teammates to get their players out of such situations.""And that is when your culture is really strong,"" he added.Ahead of the fourth Test, England team's managing director Rob Key had said that he would examine what actually happened during the break and decide whether any action was needed.""If there are things where people are saying that our players went out and drank excessively, then of course we will be looking into that,"" Key said, as quoted from ESPNcricinfo.""Drinking excessive amounts of alcohol for an international cricket team is not something that I would expect to see at any stage, and it would be a fault not to look into what happened there. But from everything that I have heard so far, they were very well behaved,"" he noted.""I have read what has been written in the last day or so, and if it goes into where they are drinking lots and it is a stag do, all that type of stuff, that's completely unacceptable. I am not a drinker. I think a drinking culture does not help anyone in any stretch whatsoever,"" he added.","England lost the ashes down under by 4-1, snapping their 18-match winless streak in australia.
