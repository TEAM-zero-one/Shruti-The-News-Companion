The gust of boycott wind around the India vs Pakistan Asia Cup clash has made its way into the Indian dressing room.TimesofIndia.com can confirm that the players had a long conversation with head coach Gautam Gambhir and other support staff, with questions swirling far beyond the boundary rope.The players have been told to stay professional and take the match just like any other. But can they?It is a young team, with most of the cricketers keeping tabs on social media the moment they get their phones back after an intensive net session. They are professionals, but they too were shaken during the border skirmish between the two countries in May, and now with the calls for boycott in the backdrop.Also See: IND vs PAK Live Score, Asia Cup 2025 The tension can be sensed, as ahead of a big match like this, neither the head coach, captain nor any player came for the pre-match press conference.On the eve of the match, India’s assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate was asked if players would be carrying the sentiments of a wounded public.He replied: ""Yes, I think they will.""It is a very sensitive issue. I have no doubt the players share the compassion and feelings of the vast majority of the Indian public. The Asia Cup was in limbo for a long period of time and we were just waiting.""We didn’t think we were going to be coming at one stage. But obviously, you know what the government’s stance is.Now the team, particularly the players, have to put their sentiments and emotions behind,"" he added.The Dutch coach later admitted that the team did go into a huddle on Saturday and addressed the situation in the team meeting.""We’re aware of people’s feelings. At the same time, we will put it behind us and the guys will get a chance to play for their country again tomorrow. They will be as professional and focused as they can be given the circumstances,"" he said.Ryan ten Doeschate discovered how India vs Pakistan begins long before the first ball.His face often slipped into a void of expression, his silences dragging longer than comfort allowed, each word measured as if it carried the weight of a landmine. In real time, he was discovering that India-Pakistan cricket is never merely a game; it is a battlefield disguised as sport.""I guess the other side of the argument is that you separate sport from politics, and people have got different opinions on that. Hopefully the way we play can represent how we feel about the country,"" he said.""I understand the position and, like I explained, the sentiment, but we are following the direction of what the BCCI and the Indian government have decided is right for the country at the moment.""This will be ten Doeschate’s second India-Pakistan match. It was in Dubai that he first tasted the rivalry during the Champions Trophy earlier this year.When coaxed about whether there was anything different in preparation, he said:""I will be honest, no. I was expecting a lot more needle during the Champions Trophy game, and I didn’t really feel that either. The preparation or focus hasn’t been any different to any other important game. Pakistan has also started to come to terms with how they want to play T20 cricket. So it’s going to be a slightly different challenge compared to the last 24 months. We want to focus on what we are doing and how we want to play.""Ten Doeschate had survived the press conference, and before signing off, revealed coach Gautam Gambhir’s message to his team ahead of the clash.""We obviously are aware of the sentiments and the strong feelings. And Gauti’s message has just been very professional about not worrying about things that are not in our control.""Just trying to be emotionless when approaching the cricket side of things. The guys are professional enough now. I’m sure individuals have different levels of feeling on the spectrum of where they feel the whole situation is. But the messaging has been to just focus on the cricket and try to just focus on the one game tomorrow.""Whoever wins the match on Sunday, one thing is for sure: the India-Pakistan rivalry has been reignited. Yes, it has lost some flair; the cricket is trying to serve as a stage, but the play is stretching far beyond it.","The players have been told to stay professional and take the match just like any other. The tension can be sensed, as neither the head coach, captain nor any player came for the pre-match press conference.

India-Pakistan match draws ire: Opposition terms it betrayal to martyrs; government says 'two separate issues',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-pakistan-match-draws-ire-opposition-terms-it-betrayal-to-martyrs-government-says-two-separate-issues/articleshow/123879078.cms,"Poll Do you think that cricket should be kept separate from political issues? Yes, sports should be apolitical. No, politics and sports are intertwined.

Why is Opposition against the match?



How has government defended the match?



Fans divided over match



NEW DELHI: The India-Pakistan Asia Cup match in Dubai has become a political battlefield even before the first ball is bowled, with opposition parties condemning the match while the government defending it as a sporting necessity. Shiv Sena (UBT) workers staged “sindoor” protests in Maharashtra and urged citizens to boycott the game, calling it an insult to soldiers and victims of the Pahalgam terror attack. Former Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal questioned whether the match was ""also being done under Trump's pressure.""Meanwhile, Shiv Sena Shinde-faction defended the match pointing to Congress-era when ""international cricket matches were played between India and Pakistan even when relations were tense.""Cricket fans, however, remain divided over the issue, as some believe that the match shouldn't take place given that ""such a big incident took place in our country.""The Opposition is against India’s participation in the Asia Cup match against Pakistan primarily because they view it as a betrayal of national sentiment following the Pahalgam terror attack and Operation Sindoor.For Shiv Sena (UBT), led by Uddhav Thackeray , the match is symbolic of what they call the government’s “business of patriotism.”Thackeray accused the BJP of prioritising money over martyrdom, questioning how the prime minister could once declare that “blood and water cannot flow together” but still allow cricket ties with Pakistan. The party staged ‘Sindoor’ protests in Mumbai, with its women workers sending vermilion to the PMO as a symbolic gesture, arguing that cricket with Pakistan is an insult to soldiers and terror victims.""Our Prime Minister said blood and water cannot flow together, then how can blood and cricket flow together. How can war and cricket be at the same time?. They have done business in patriotism. The business of patriotism is only for money. They are going to play the match tomorrow also because they want all the money they will get from that match,"" he said.Former Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal also questioned the match saying, “What is the need for the Prime Minister to organise a match with Pakistan? The whole country is saying that this match should not happen. Then why is this match being organised?""""Is this also being done under Trump's pressure? How much will you bow down to Trump?"" he said.""Playing a match with Pakistan is a betrayal of the country. Every Indian is extremely angry about this,"" he declared.Calling for an outright boycott of the match, Aaditya Thackeray said, ""The match can be boycotted even today, even now. The @BCCI can still show India that it belongs to India, and not to greed of money. The BCCI can still prove that it isn’t anti- national. Do 2 points really matter to the best team in the world? Those playing today on the field, must realise that they are playing against a country from where terrorists came into ours, massacred innocent lives. Think of the families who lost their loved ones in Pahalgam.""""Nothing can come beyond boycotting a country that harbours terrorists. What a shame to be knowing all of this and still going ahead with the game. Today, we miss a Union Government that would have strongly come down on such anti- national acts. Sadly, we see BJP having changed its ideology and definition of patriotism,"" he added.AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi echoed these concerns, attacking the BJP for allowing the fixture despite Pakistan’s role in the Pahalgam killings. He asked whether the monetary gains from the match, potentially worth thousands of crores, outweighed the value of 26 Indian lives lost. For the opposition, the issue is not just about sport, but about national dignity, security, and respect for the victims of terrorism, making their call for a boycott a political as well as moral stance.""My question to the chief minister of Assam, the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, and all of them is that you don't have the power to refuse to play a cricket match against Pakistan, which asked for the religion of our 26 citizens in Pahalgam and shot them,"" Owaisi said.The government has defended India’s participation in the Asia Cup 2025 match against Pakistan by drawing a clear line between cricket and conflict. Union minister Manohar Lal said the game and Operation Sindoor were “two different issues,” and argued that opposing the match was unfair to the players who had worked hard to reach this stage. He stressed that the decision to go ahead was taken “thoughtfully” and that cricket carried its own sentiment beyond politics.""Both issues are different. As far as the matter between India and Pakistan (the cricket match), Operation Sindoor, and other things are concerned, nobody will say that the match will happen just by comparing them. But as far as the game is concerned, the game has sentiment, and players also worked hard for it, so it is not fair to oppose it. That's why whatever has been decided has been decided thoughtfully,"" he said.Moreover, Eknath Shinde-led Sena and MP Naresh Mhaske targeted Congress saying, ""UBT (Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray) had no moral right to oppose the match. During the Congress era too, international cricket matches were played between India and Pakistan even when relations were tense.""""Until terrorism stops, cordial relations cannot be built. Playing an Asia Cup match doesn't mean a change in policy. The IPL doors are still closed to Pakistani players. In international competitions, such matches have always been played, including World Cup games,"" he added.Maharashtra deputy CM Ajit Pawar said that a country of 140 crores was bound to have ""differences of opinion over the cricket match.""""The country has a population of 140 crore. In such a vast country, there are bound to be differences of opinion over the cricket match. Some people may feel that since relations between the two countries are strained, there should be no match. At the same time, others may support the game,"" he said.The fans remain divided over the match. While many see the game as a moment of national pride and sporting excitement, others believe holding the contest so soon after the Pahalgam terror attack is insensitive and should be avoided.In Mumbai, cricket follower Shubham Chavan told ANI, ""Match should not take place. The match should not take place. But as a sportsman, it should. India vs Pakistan is a big match. The matches are thrilling. It goes till the last over. So, it will be entertaining. India will win.""Another cricket fan Asgar Ali from Ahmedabad expressed similar sentiments saying, ""This match should not be played. Such a big incident took place in our country, but still we are playing a cricket match against them. According to me, we should boycott this completely.""Others countered that sport should be kept separate from politics and conflict. Fans like Praveen Kashyap in Delhi maintained that the rivalry is part of cricket’s appeal and should go ahead regardless of strained relations.""This is a match which everyone would want to watch...People have a special affinity for sports. Everybody wants to watch the India vs Pakistan match...A few people view sports just as sports,"" he said.",The india-pakistan asia cup match in dubai has become a political battlefield.

For them, kickboxing is more than jab-cross drills and roundhouse kicks; it is a battle against financial struggles and a path towards sporting glory.Together, these teenagers have stacked up an impressive medal tally - multiple state golds, national silvers, bronzes, and even international podium finishes. ""Their haul includes international medals across prestigious events such as Turkey Kickboxing World Cup (2023), Uzbekistan Kickboxing World Cup (2024) and Open International Championship in Delhi (2025),"" said C Suresh Babu, chief coach of the Indian kickboxing team.Among the youngsters is M Dharshan (14), a Class 9 student of Don Bosco, Villivakkam. His father, J Murali, is a fish seller at Kolathur, and his mother, M Kamatchi, a homemaker. Known for sharp front kicks that unsettle opponents, the boy has already won a bronze at the 2025 International Championship in Delhi, along with other state and national medals. ""I have been training in kickboxing for four years.

Despite his hardships, he sends me to these competitions. I want to make him proud on the international podium,"" she said.For 15-year-old Rahul, the journey is even more arduous. ""I lost my father when I was young. My mother, M Bhuvana, works as a domestic help. Despite her meagre salary, she encourages me to train in kickboxing,"" he said. From Perungalathur, Bharth Vishnu S (17), son of a daily wage labourer, has dominated the ring with state and national golds and international triumphs, including a gold in Turkiye.Siblings Jeevitha BM (14) and Yogesh BM (16) of Nazareth Matric Higher Secondary School sharpen their skills side by side. While Jeevitha has swept state and national golds over six years, Yogesh added a national gold in 2024 in the junior national championships despite tough competition. ""Our father is a driver.

Shedeur Sanders avoids straight answer on Ravens draft rumors following Browns’ embarrassing loss to division rivals,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/shedeur-sanders-avoids-straight-answer-on-ravens-draft-rumors-following-browns-embarrassing-loss-to-division-rivals/articleshow/123889623.cms,"Shedeur Sanders avoids addressing Ravens draft rumors (Getty Images)

Shedeur Sanders draft decision raises eyebrows



Did Sanders make the right call with the Browns?



When Week 2 of the NFL season kicked off, the drama was already in full swing. ESPN’s Adam Schefter dropped a bombshell: the Baltimore Ravens had planned to draft Shedeur Sanders in the fifth round of April’s draft before the young quarterback made it clear he wanted no part of Baltimore. Hours later, Sanders and his Cleveland Browns were handed a lopsided 41-17 loss to those very Ravens, sparking fresh questions about what might have been.According to Schefter, the Ravens were ready to use the 141st overall pick on Sanders. But the Colorado star reportedly told the team he didn’t want to sit behind Lamar Jackson, a two-time MVP with one of the most secure jobs in football. “Before the Ravens could turn in the card, the former Colorado star let it be known to Baltimore that he didn't want to be on a roster with Lamar Jackson,” Schefter reported.That bold move paved Sanders’ path to Cleveland, who traded up three spots later to grab him. Yet when asked about the reports after Sunday’s defeat, Sanders chose not to dig into the past. “My response is I’m focused on the now,” Sanders said via Cleveland.com. “I don’t really talk about anything in the past and whatever happened in the past, it is what it is. I’m more focused on now and I’m more focused on this game we just had and figuring out how to move forward from that.Pressed further, Sanders leaned on humor and deflection: “You wouldn’t believe my memory don’t even go back that far. I don’t remember anything post-draft. I remember I’m here, I go to practice every day and there’s a 24-hour rule.”The Browns may not be the powerhouse the Ravens are, but Sanders’ road to playing time is much clearer in Cleveland. Veteran Joe Flacco is 40, and rookie Dillon Gabriel already leapfrogged Sanders for the backup role after a sharp preseason showing. If Flacco falters or the Browns stumble out of playoff contention, the door could open for Sanders sooner rather than later.Still, some argue Baltimore would have offered more stability and long-term growth under John Harbaugh. For now, Sanders must prove he made the right call. If his talent shines, the Browns could finally stabilize their long-shaky quarterback future. If not, Cleveland risks reliving a familiar cycle.Also Read: Eagles escape with narrow 20-17 win over Chiefs after Travis Kelce’s late blunder costs Kansas City dearly",Shedeur sanders avoids addressing ravens draft rumors.

Michael Penix Jr. earns starting nod after late-season surge

Kirk Cousins remains a high-paid backup with experience on standby



The Atlanta Falcons are facing the Minnesota Vikings in Week 2 of the 2025 NFL season, but all eyes won’t be on Kirk Cousins. Instead, the spotlight belongs to rookie Michael Penix Jr. , who has been named the Falcons’ starting quarterback over the veteran signal-caller. This shift marks a new chapter for Atlanta as they embrace younger talent in a key position.Despite his high-profile four-year, $180 million contract, Cousins found himself relegated to backup duty following a rough end to the 2024 season. Over a five-game stretch, Cousins completed just 62.7% of his passes, threw one touchdown against nine interceptions, and saw the Falcons go 1-4.Falcons coach Raheem Morris explained the move, saying, ""After review we have made the decision Michael Penix will be the Atlanta Falcons starting quarterback moving forward. This was a football decision and we are fully focused on preparing the team for Sunday's game against the New York Giants.""Penix, in limited action, showed promise with 775 passing yards, three touchdowns, and three interceptions over three games.The Falcons evidently felt that the rookie’s performance and potential warranted the starting role, a decision that has reshaped the team’s quarterback dynamics for the season.While Cousins no longer starts, his presence on the roster remains significant. The 37-year-old veteran brings experience and leadership to the sidelines, ready to step in if needed. During his first year with the Falcons, he finished 14 starts with a 7-7 record, 3,508 passing yards, 18 touchdowns, and 16 interceptions. Though his passer rating of 88.6 was below the league average, his knowledge and ability to mentor a young quarterback like Penix remain valuable assets.Also Read: Which NFL teams observed a moment of silence for Charlie Kirk amid nationwide mourning in Week 2?

Poll How crucial was Pandya's first-ball wicket in setting the tone for the match against Pakistan? Extremely crucial Not very important

NEW DELHI: India all-rounder Hardik Pandya etched his name into the record books by claiming a wicket with his very first delivery in the Asia Cup Group A clash against arch-rivals Pakistan on Sunday. He became only the second Indian bowler to achieve the feat in T20Is.The landmark moment came in the opening over of the match. After starting with a wide down the leg side, Pandya adjusted his line and struck immediately with the next ball. Pakistan opener Saim Ayub, looking to punch the outswinger through the off side, could only find Jasprit Bumrah at point. The opener departed without scoring a single run.With this, Pandya joined fellow pacer Arshdeep Singh in a rare club. Arshdeep was the first Indian to claim a wicket off his first legitimate ball in a T20I, dismissing USA’s Shayan Jahangir in New York during the 2024 T20 World Cup. However, the left-arm pacer has yet to feature in this Asia Cup, having also been left out of India’s opening game against the UAE.While Pandya’s first-ball wicket set the tone, two more Indian bowlers made dents in Pakistan's batting line-up instantly.

Bob Goodenow dies at 72: The man behind NHL’s toughest labor battles

Remembering Bob Goodenow’s legacy in NHL and beyond



NHL insider Frank Seravalli has confirmed the sudden passing of Bob Goodenow, the former Executive Director of the NHL Players’ Association, at the age of 72. Widely regarded as one of hockey’s most influential labor leaders, Goodenow guided players through some of the league’s most turbulent chapters. His leadership not only reshaped the NHL’s labor landscape but also expanded the game’s global footprint.Goodenow assumed leadership of the NHLPA in 1992 and wasted little time in making his mark. Within months, he orchestrated a players’ strike that showcased his determination to protect athletes’ rights. Over the next decade, his leadership was tested by two defining labor disputes.The 1994-95 lockout shortened the NHL season to 48 games, while the 2004-05 standoff resulted in the unprecedented cancellation of an entire season. Though criticized by some, Goodenow’s uncompromising approach earned him the unwavering support of many players who viewed him as a fearless advocate.Goodenow stepped down from his NHLPA role in 2005 but remained active in shaping the sport globally. Partnering with Russian businessman Alexander Medvedev, he helped establish the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL), which soon became a powerful alternative to the NHL.This move underscored his influence not just in North America, but on the international stage. His vision helped elevate competition worldwide and created new opportunities for players seeking alternatives outside the NHL.Despite years of contentious negotiations, NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman offered a respectful tribute, describing Goodenow as “a skilled attorney and tenacious advocate” who left a lasting mark on the league. Many former players have also acknowledged his relentless commitment to protecting their interests, even in the face of criticism. Goodenow is survived by his wife, Wendy, and their three children.Also Read: Sidney Crosby holds the key to Buffalo Sabres’ playoff hopes and his absence could cost them big While today’s generation of fans may not widely recognize him, Bob Goodenow’s leadership reshaped the economics of hockey, secured greater rights for players, and played a key role in the sport’s global expansion. His legacy continues to shape the NHL and professional hockey worldwide.","Bob goodenow, the former executive director of the nhl players' association, has died at the age of 72.

Tired of too many ads? go ad free now

Out of all the things NFL fans could’ve freaked out over this week bad throws, contract holdouts, roster drama, the internet instead chose blue nail polish. Yep. Caleb Williams decided to show up with his fingers looking fabulous, and suddenly, it was like half of football Twitter lost its mind. Some folks went full 1950s, others were screaming “GOAT energy,” and honestly, the comments section turned into its own Super Bowl.After the photo of the QB Caleb Williams surfaced online, Twitter/X turned into a war zone. Comments ranged from weirdly obsessed to weirdly supportive.One user posted:Another chimed in with:Some were just straight-up confused:

Caleb Williams trends as fans question his sexuality over blue nail polish photos

The NFL’s masculinity crisis: Why nail polish still sends people into meltdown mode

Gen Z fans are done with the fake outrage and fully support their painted-nail kings

This isn’t even new. The moment a male NFL player does something remotely outside the “football guy” mold whether it’s wearing pink, painting nails, or dressing like they’ve seen a fashion show, a chunk of the fanbase acts like the league's collapsing. We’ve seen it with Cam Newton’s outfits, OBJ’s cleats, and even Joe Burrow’s swagger fits.Let a man do his thing and throw a 40-yard dime? Why are we mad?The best part? Younger fans weren’t just not mad, they were loving it. The phrase “PERIODT!!” was literally trending under the photo. TikTok is already making edits. And people are reposting with captions like,If you’re throwing touchdowns and dropping bombs downfield, you could show up in glitter boots and eyeliner and still be That Guy. Football Twitter might still be adjusting to players expressing themselves, but Gen Z already made their choice, they're riding for QBs who can sling the ball and rock a mani. Whether it was a fashion flex, a personal vibe, or just a fun moment, the message is clear: blue nail polish is not the crisis y’all think it is. And if he throws a touchdown with those nails? That’s just extra polish on the win.","Caleb williams showed up with blue nail polish on his fingers. Twitter/x turned into a war zone. Comments ranged from weirdly obsessed to weirdly supportive.

Dan Campbell wants to win against his friend Ben Johnson while the Chicago Bears’ head coach aims for a quick turnaround in Detroit

Super Bowl hopes for the Detroit Lions vs questions about Ben Johnson’s role as Bears head coach

Also Read:

Back in May, Jeffri Chadiha of NFL Network mentioned one of the three biggest takeaways for the Chicago Bears—“Ben Johnson’s reunion comes early: It won’t take long for the new Bears head coach to meet up with his former team. The ex-Lions offensive coordinator will see Detroit in Week 2 in what should be a fun matchup. The Bears have been loading up this offseason to give Johnson the offense he needs, and the Lions will be breaking in a new defensive coordinator(in Kelvin Sheppard).”Now that the matchup is finally here, Detroit Lions head coach Dan Campbell says, “We are going to win this game. We have to.” And Chicago Bears head coach Ben Johnson responds, “We gotta turn the page quickly in Detroit.”Who’s going to win? We can’t wait to find out! For now, what else did the head coaches say? And—more importantly—what does NBC Sports’ Mike Florio think about this much-anticipated faceoff between two friends? Let’s read on.Talking to Nolan Bianchi of The Detroit News, Dan Campbell assured that he’s going to win against his friend’s team:“Ben(Johnson)’s my friend. He’s always going to be my friend. But nothing about that’s going to change.We’re going on, getting ready to play Chicago. We’re going to win this game. We have to.”After losing to the Minnesota Vikings in Week 1, Ben Johnson promised a quick turnaround in Detroit:“No one’s going to feel sorry for us. This is going to be a quick turnaround here to get going for Sunday in Detroit, our first road game. We gotta turn the page here quickly.”On September 14, Mike Florio of NBC Sports reported that it’s a big game for both head coaches.Ben Johnson’s Monday Night loss to the Minnesota Vikings, coupled with another loss against his former team, the Detroit Lions, would drop the Chicago Bears to 0-2. That would raise questions about whether Johnson is more suited for a coordinator’s role than a head coach.On the other hand, Dan Campbell entered the 2025 season with Super Bowl dreams, and a 0-2 start against divisional rivals would make the Detroit Lions the NFL’s most disappointing team through two weeks.","Detroit lions head coach dan campbell says, “we are going to win this game.

I hope they continue to inspire us all and we give them more reasons on the ground whenever we get an opportunity to put a smile on their face,” he said at the post-match presentation.Unusual scenes unfolded at the end of the match after Suryakumar sealed the win with a six, shook hands only with batting partner Shivam Dube, and walked off without acknowledging the Pakistani players.A similar moment occurred at the toss, when Suryakumar and Salman Ali Agha skipped the customary handshake. Even broadcaster Ravi Shastri, who conducted the toss, did not exchange pleasantries with Agha.At the post-match press conference, Suryakumar said: “I think that was our proper reply. Our government and the BCCI were aligned, and together we took a call. We came here only to play cricket.”He added: “I feel a few things in life are ahead of sportsmanship. I said at the presentation as well that we stand with all the victims of the Pahalgam terror attack. And we stand with their families too, expressing our solidarity.""Also, as I said at the post-match presentation, we dedicate this win to our brave armed forces who took part in Operation Sindoor. And as they continue to inspire us all, we will try our best, whenever given an opportunity, to inspire them as well, if possible.”Pakistan coach Mike Hesson confirmed Salman Ali Agha’s absence from the presentation was a reaction to India’s stance.“I think it's just the flow-on effect of the fact that we were obviously keen to engage and shake hands at the end of the match. That didn't happen. That was pretty much the end of it,” Hesson said.“Obviously, we were ready to shake hands at the end of the game. We were disappointed that our opposition didn't do that. We sort of went over there to shake hands and they were already going to the changing room. That was a disappointing way for the match to end. In a match where we were already disappointed with the way we played, we were at least willing to go and shake hands.”",India captain suryakumar yadav and pakistan captain salman ali agha skipped the customary handshake at the toss.

No handshakes

A few days ago, R Ashwin cheekily suggested that South Africa be thrown into the Asia Cup mix and the event be rechristened the Afro-Asia Cup, just to inject some real competition. After Sunday, he may have had a point.On Sunday, under the sweltering Dubai heat, the so-called ""arch-rivalry"", once again, felt like a damp squib.The only real drama came when India captain Suryakumar Yadav refused the customary handshake at the toss with his counterpart Salman Ali Agha. Beyond that, Pakistan barely showed up, reduced to mere spectators in what was once cricket’s fiercest duel.After opting to bat first, Pakistan batters looked rattled against pace and were all at sea against India's quality spinners. Shaheen Afridi’s unbeaten 33 off 16 balls, laced with four sixes—including a brutal assault on Hardik Pandya in the final over — dragged Pakistan to 127/9. India won the match comprehensively by seven wickets.India, with Suryakumar Yadav and Shivam Dube in the middle, marched back to their dressing room the moment the game ended.The Indian pairing exchanged handshakes with teammates in the dugout, before the entire squad disappeared upstairs. The door shut firmly, echoing Suryakumar Yadav’s snub at the toss, as the Indian cricket team once again refused to shake hands with Pakistan.Caught in the middle, Salman Ali Agha’s men stopped mid-way after head coach Mike Hesson ordered them towards their dressing room. But not a single Indian player emerged. A visibly miffed Hesson then stormed to India’s dressing room, found no response, and was later spotted in a heated discussion with match referee Andy Pycroft.Later, SKY dedicated the win to the armed forces and expressed solidarity with the victims of the Pahalgam terror attack. ""We stand by the victims of the families of the Pahalgam terror attack. We express our solidarity. Want to dedicate the win to all our armed forces who showed a lot of bravery,"" he said in the post-match press conference.Hardik Pandya struck off the very first legal delivery of the match, sending Saim Ayub packing for his second golden duck in a row. Jasprit Bumrah then removed Pakistan’s recent hero Mohammad Haris, thanks to a sharp catch from Hardik Pandya.Thereafter, there was some spunk shown by Sahibzada Farhan (40 off 44; 1x4, 3x6), who has replaced Babar Azam in the team. He briefly resisted with a couple of sixes off Bumrah.The battle between Sahibzada Farhan and Jasprit Bumrah was fascinating. Pakistan's highest run-getter of the match tonked Bumrah over mid-on for a six.A ball later, there was a change in field. Shubman Gill walked to short mid-wicket from the only slip, and Bumrah tried an attempted yorker. The low full toss took Farhan by surprise and it nearly carried to Bumrah in the follow-through, but despite his full-stretched dive, it fell short.For the second match in a row, Bumrah bowled three overs on the trot in the powerplay. This time, Farhan dispatched him into the second tier. It was angling into the body, and the Pakistani opener swivelled his blade, got wood, and became only the sixth batter to hit multiple sixes off Bumrah in T20Is. To add to that, he also became the first Pakistan batter to hit a six off Bumrah's bowling in this format.Next ball, Farhan tried another maximum but ended up miscuing it and it fell in no man's land.Farhan added 39 runs while Fakhar Zaman, whose cameo ended at 17, was dismissed by Axar Patel.After that, India’s spinners tore through Pakistan’s middle order.Axar’s twin blows and Kuldeep’s double-strike ripped through Pakistan’s innings, choking their scoring despite desperate aggression. At one stage even 100 looked out of reach, before Shaheen’s late fireworks lifted them to something to fight with.Kuldeep Yadav (3/18) was once again India’s trump card, with Axar (2/18), Bumrah (2/28), Varun (1/24) and Pandya (1/34) ensuring Pakistan never settled.Abhishek Sharma started the chase in a way he always does. He made Shaheen Shah Afridi look like a club bowler—hitting a four and a six in the first two balls of the innings. He gave Shaheen the same treatment in his second spell, hammering him for a four and a maximum.Abhishek looked in a hurry, clattering Saim Ayub for back-to-back boundaries. With him at the crease, it looked like India would chase it down inside ten overs.But Saim Ayub, who is failing miserably with the bat, removed both Indian openers.Shubman Gill was deceived by a carrom ball. After being hit for two boundaries, Ayub bowled the ball of the match. The carrom ball dipped on off stump, Gill pressed forward but it turned away, beating the outside edge. Haris whipped off the bails in a flash. Saim then sent back Abhishek with a slower off-break, caught at long-off by Faheem Ashraf. Abhishek scored a quickfire 13-ball 31.Tilak Varma (31 off 31b; 2x4, 1x6) and Suryakumar Yadav (47 not out off 37 balls) put on a steady run-a-ball 56-run partnership for the third wicket to knock Pakistan out of the game.The duo looked at ease, rotated strike, hit a few audacious shots, and managed to keep Pakistan at bay.It was Saim Ayub who finally broke the partnership with another ripper. A quicker off-break on middle drifted in, pitched, and turned sharply. Tilak went back to defend but was beaten by the spin as the ball crashed into the off-stump. Saim Ayub had his third, while Tilak stood surprised at where it had pitched.Saim Ayub (3/35) was the pick of the Pakistan bowlers.Suryakumar Yadav sealed the match with a six, with 25 balls to spare, as India chased down the total comfortably.Overall, it was a nothing performance from Pakistan, and it looked like a mismatch competition both on paper and on the field.",India beat pakistan by seven wickets in the second t20 in dubai.

Dominant India cruised to a seven-wicket win over arch-rivals Pakistan in their high-stakes Asia Cup 2025 Group A clash on Sunday at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium, but the result was overshadowed by off-field drama as Indian players skipped the customary post-match handshake.Chasing 128, skipper Suryakumar Yadav (47 not out off 37 balls) and Shivam Dube sealed the victory in 15.5 overs in Dubai.However, instead of greeting their opponents, the Indian pair walked straight to the dressing room after the winning six hit by Suryakumar. Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha and head coach Mike Hesson later approached the Indian camp, but no players came out to shake hands. Hesson appeared visibly annoyed by the snub.The India captain later spoke about his team's performance and how he felt scoring the winning runs on his birthday. Greeted by former India cricketer Sanjay Manjrekar, Suryakumar said, ""This is the perfect return gift to India.""He then made use of the winning moment to dedicate the win to India's armed forces. ""We stand by the victims of the families of Pahalgam terror attack. We express our solidarity. We want to dedicate today's win to all our Armed Forces who showed a lot of bravery.Hope they continue to inspire us all and we give them more reasons on the ground whenever we get an opportunity to make them smile,"" said the skipper. His comment was received with a roar of applause from the crowd.India's decision to not shake hands after the match on the other hand, was the second no-handshake episode of the day, after Suryakumar and Agha declined to exchange hands at the toss.The tension had already been stoked before the start, when organisers mistakenly played the wrong anthem for Pakistan, forcing an awkward pause before the correction.In the post-match press conference as well, Team India skipper answered questions about not shaking hands with the opposition. Posed with the same task of explaining his decision, he said. ""Few things in life are ahead of sportsman spirit also.""Team India and the players came under the microscope ahead of the Pakistan clash, given the charged atmosphere surrounding the match and amidst calls for boycotting the game. Speaking about handling the noise around such a game, the skipper said the squad had kept distractions away. “In my team, we decided to cut the outside noise. I don’t know what is happening on the social media,” he said.Pakistan head coach Mike Hesson was also straightforward in the way he answered questions about the handshake incident. ""We were ready to shake hands, disappointed opposition didn’t do that,” Hesson said after the game. He added that Pakistan were expecting to shake hands, but that India did not reciprocate.On the field, India’s spinners dominated. Kuldeep Yadav (3/18) and Axar Patel (2/18) choked Pakistan’s middle order after Hardik Pandya and Jasprit Bumrah struck early blows.Only Sahibzada Farhan (40 off 44) and Shaheen Afridi (33* off 16) offered resistance, taking Pakistan to 127/9.In reply, India made short work of the chase. Abhishek Sharma blazed 31 off 13 balls, Tilak Varma steadied with 31 off 31, and Suryakumar finished things off with trademark composure.Both sides came into the clash on the back of convincing wins, India crushing UAE and Pakistan thrashing Oman. But the simmering political tensions between the neighbours spilled onto the field, with the absence of handshakes adding another layer to the rivalry.India now top Group A, while Pakistan are left with question marks both on and off the field after another of the fancied rivalry went the Men in Blue's way.","No handshakes between the two teams after the game.
