Rohit Sharma’s Final Test Practice: Exclusive Farewell Visuals

Rohit Sharma Unplugged: Funniest Press Conference Moments

India's Test cricket captain Rohit Sharma announced his immediate retirement on Wednesday at the age of 37. His final appearance was during the fourth Test against Australia in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, which resulted in a defeat. He was subsequently dropped for the fifth Test as India lost the series 1-3.Sharma took over the Test captaincy in 2021 following Virat Kohli 's resignation. His tenure began with a two-match series against Sri Lanka, and he led India to the World Test Championship final in the 2021/23 cycle, where they ultimately lost to Australia.The initial phase of Sharma's captaincy showed promise with successful campaigns. He secured a series victory in the West Indies and followed it with a commanding 4-1 triumph over England in 2024.However, his later tenure faced significant challenges. A 0-3 home series loss to New Zealand and a 1-3 defeat in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy against Australia created mounting pressure. His retirement comes before India's upcoming five-match Test series in England scheduled for June.Under Sharma's leadership, India played 24 Test matches, winning 12, losing 9, and drawing 3. His captaincy record includes notable series victories against Sri Lanka (2-0 at home), Bangladesh (2-0 away), and Australia (2-1 at home).The team also achieved positive results against West Indies (1-0 away win) and drew 1-1 with South Africa away from home. A significant highlight was the 4-1 victory over England at home, followed by another 2-0 success against Bangladesh at home.Quiz: Who's that IPL player? Sharma's batting performance showed distinct patterns during his captaincy period. As captain, he scored 1,254 runs in 24 matches at an average of 30.58, including four centuries. In comparison, his record before captaincy showed 3,047 runs in 43 matches at a higher average of 46.87, with eight centuries.His series results as captain demonstrate a mixed record of success and setbacks. The initial victories against Sri Lanka and Bangladesh set a positive tone, while the World Test Championship final loss to Australia marked a significant disappointment.The comprehensive victory over England in 2024 represented a high point in his captaincy. However, the subsequent losses to New Zealand at home and Australia away proved challenging. Notably, Sharma did not captain India during their victory in the first Test in Perth against Australia.His retirement marks the end of a significant chapter in Indian cricket, with reports suggesting Shubman Gill as the likely successor to the Test captaincy role.","Sharma took over the test captaincy in 2021 following virat kohli's resignation.

Rohit Sharma on Wednesday announced his retirement from Test cricket.Rohit's last Test appearance was in Melbourne during the fourth Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. However, for the fifth Test in Sydney, Rohit dropped himself.“I spoke to the coach and the selector, and they kind of agreed, well, there was an argument around it,” Rohit told former Australian captain Michael Clarke during the Beyond23 Cricket podcast.“I had to be honest with myself. I wasn’t hitting the ball well. I didn’t want to put myself there only because we had dropped the other guys who were struggling as well.“I didn’t have a great game (in Adelaide). Then I went back to the room, and I was like, I should have opened, man. I would rather fail doing what I do and where I do it. That’s my place, that’s my position. I would rather go there and bat, whether I get success or not, it’s a different story. But I’m in my natural position for the team,” he told Clarke.Rohit had struggled in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy series in Australia, which India lost 3-1. He averaged just 6.20 in five innings and also dropped himself for the final Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground. Before that, Rohit had a forgettable time in India’s 3-0 home series defeat to New Zealand, averaging just 15.16.However, back then in Australia, Rohit had said that he had no immediate plans to retire and that he believed he could turn around his form.“I have come from such a long distance; I have not come here to sit outside or to not play the match,"" Rohit had told Star Sports in Sydney.""I have to play and make the team win, and from the first day when I came to the dressing room in 2007 till now, I have been thinking that I have to make the team win.""But sometimes you have to understand what is the need of the team. If you do not put the team first, then there is no use. That is why we call it a team, because eleven people are playing, not one person or two people; eleven people are playing, so it is a team. Whatever is the cost to the team, try to do that.”Rohit's career batting average was 40.57 across his 67 Test matches, including 12 hundreds and 18 half centuries.India are due to face England in a five-Test series this summer, starting at Headingley on June 20.",Rohit sharma has announced his retirement from test cricket.

Anthony Rizzo signs with Red Sox after Triston Casas injury shake-up

Veteran Anthony Rizzo could steady Boston's infield

The Boston Red Sox have taken a daring step to solve their first base problem. The Red Sox are signing veteran first baseman Anthony Rizzo, who played last for the arch-rival New York Yankees, reports The Athletic. The move follows just days after Boston lost Triston Casas to a severe knee injury. Anthony Rizzo is bringing experience, leadership, and Gold Glove-level defense to a young Red Sox roster struggling to remain competitive in the AL East.Following the loss of Triston Casas to a ruptured left patellar tendon, the Red Sox had a large void to fill at first base. Triston Casas was injured on Friday attempting to beat out an infield single and was put on the injured list on Saturday. With only Romy Gonzalez as an internal solution, Boston turned outside for assistance and found it in a familiar name.Former Yankee and three-time All-Star Anthony Rizzo will be sporting a Red Sox jersey once again. Anthony Rizzo was initially drafted by Boston in 2007 before he was traded away. The 34-year-old Anthony Rizzo comes with a wealth of experience after playing in the 2024 World Series with New York and earlier assisting the Cubs to win a title in 2016.Though his bat isn't what it used to be he batted a mere.224 with eight home runs and a.637 OPS last season. Anthony Rizzo is still a good defender. He might take a little time to get rid of rust before diving into everyday work, but his glove and leadership should serve Boston immediately.Anthony Rizzo's signing indicates that Boston is not ready to give up on the playoff chase even without Casas. Although internal solutions such as Gonzalez provide some flexibility, Anthony Rizzo provides a genuine first baseman's glove and veteran leadership.His return to the Red Sox is almost two decades since the team originally drafted him. The signing also creates intrigue for future Yankees. Red Sox games, as Anthony Rizzo now wears the uniform of the Bronx Bombers' arch-nemesis.Boston hasn't yet made an announcement about when Anthony Rizzo will officially become a part of the roster or how many at-bats he'll accumulate before being activated, but the switch provides the team with a clear direction as they get accustomed to life without Casas.Anthony Rizzo’s return to Boston brings leadership, defense, and experience offering hope for the Red Sox as they fight to stay competitive without Triston Casas.Also Read: “He Is Certainly Athletic Enough”- MLB Insider Suggests Red Sox Outfielder’s Name For Triston Casas’ Replacement",Anthony rizzo signs with red sox after triston casas injury shake-up.

Rohit Sharma’s Final Test Practice: Exclusive Farewell Visuals

Rohit Sharma Unplugged: Funniest Press Conference Moments

Indian cricket’s senior statesman Rohit Sharma announced his retirement from Test cricket on Wednesday, closing the chapter on a distinguished red-ball career that spanned over a decade. The 38-year-old made the announcement via an Instagram story, writing, ""Hello everyone, I would just like to share that I am retiring from Test cricket. It's been an absolute honour to represent my country in whites. Thank you for all the love and support over the years.""The decision follows speculation over his place in the Indian Test side, particularly with the five-match series in England on the horizon. As reported by TOI earlier this week, the BCCI was already considering a change in leadership, and Rohit's Test selection was no longer guaranteed.Rohit, however, clarified that he will continue to be available for selection in the ODI format. The veteran opener had earlier retired from T20Is after leading India to a title win in the 2024 ICC T20 World Cup, ending the nation’s 13-year drought in ICC tournaments.Rohit’s Test career began in 2013, and he went on to play 67 matches, scoring 4,301 runs at an average of 40.6, including 12 centuries and 18 fifties. His highest score was a masterful 212. Known for his elegance and timing, Rohit matured into a dependable opener in the latter half of his career.His recent Test form, however, was underwhelming. In his last nine Tests, he averaged just 10.93. During the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Australia, he even opted to drop himself for the Sydney Test, saying, “I have to be honest to myself… I wasn’t hitting the ball well.”Australia went on to win that match and reclaim the Border-Gavaskar Trophy 3-1.With his whites now hung up, Rohit’s legacy will continue in the shorter formats—where his leadership and batting remain invaluable.","Rohit sharma announced his retirement from test cricket on wednesday.

Michael McLeod defense questions David Humphrey complainant's version of events



""They were laughing at me"": Female complainant tells the jury at world juniors sex assault trial

The trial of five former players of Canada's 2018 World Junior Championship squad, including now-former NHL player Michael McLeod , escalated into a contentious phase on Tuesday as defense counsel David Humphrey resumed his cross-examination of the complainant. The female complainant, identified only by the initials E.M. for reasons of a court-ordered publication ban, claims she was sexually assaulted inside a London, Ontario hotel room following a Hockey Canada gala last June.Michael McLeod, along with Carter Hart, Alex Formenton, Dillon Dube, and Cal Foote, have entered not guilty pleas to one charge of sexual assault. Michael McLeod has a second charge of sexual assault as a party to the offence.David Humphrey, acting for Michael McLeod, concentrated considerably on E.M.'s memory of that night's events—specifically at Jack's Bar, where she met McLeod and other players. Humphrey alluded to a man, Matt Maccarone, a bar customer and support figure; a police detective had testified earlier about a man who had talked favorably about McLeod. Asked if he had heard anything concerning McLeod being ‘an elite player’, E.M. said she had not, remembering instead that Maccarone had characterized him as ""a good guy"" who had money.Security video from the nightclub dance floor was shown during the session, with Humphrey pointing out frames where E.M. seems to put her hand on McLeod's crotch voluntarily. Although E.M. admitted to that incident, she maintained that team members had manipulated her hand in similar manners throughout the evening, making it difficult for her to know what she was consenting to.“They made it seem like it was fine, and with the amount I had to drink, I thought I’d go along with it. I thought maybe I should feel flattered and not question it too much.” said E.M.Humphrey asked further why E.M. didn't leave the bar or McLeod, to which she replied, “I've always had a hard time saying no to people.”Additional attention was paid to two video recordings inside the hotel room, at 3:25 a.m. and 4:26 a.m., during which E.M. can be heard stating that the acts were consensual. Humphrey relied on this evidence to challenge her credibility, but E.M. insisted that her consent then was influenced by pressure and alcohol consumption, claiming McLeod only sought verbal confirmation at the point of filming.“I didn't feel like I had a choice,"" she reaffirmed in testimony, describing the tone of the evening changed significantly after the videos. Asked about her earlier assertions regarding ‘rude’ conduct, she testified McLeod uttered a dismissive comment: “Are you leaving anytime soon?”Also read: The jury saw the surveillance footage of hockey players from the 2018 Hockey Canada sexual assault scandal Humphrey finished up his cross-examination by challenging the complainant's romantic involvement at the time, inferring that she acted out of guilt feelings over having cheated on her boyfriend.

1. Something big is being planned for the “Big Dog”

Paul Heyman WrestleMania 41 highlights | Betrayal of CM Punk and Roman Reigns

2. Reigns might be injured

3. Roman might deal with Rollins alone

Paul Heyman aligns with Seth Rollins, BETRAYING CM Punk and Roman Reigns: WrestleMania 41 highlights

After getting betrayed by his “Wiseman” Paul Heyman, the “OTC” Roman Reigns retaliated on the first RAW episode after WrestleMania 41 by attacking Seth Rollins. But in a monumental shock, he was in for a huge surprise as Bron Breakker emerged to be the new disciple of the Wiseman and pulverized Roman, before doing the same with CM Punk(who was also betrayed by Heyman at WrestleMania).Then on this weeks’ RAW, Seth Rollins challenged Jey Uso for the World Heavyweight Championship the world anticipated for Roman to come back and do something about it. But instead it was Punk who saved the day for the “Yeet” master.Let’s explore the reasons and repercussions of Roman Reigns absence from Raw this weekRoman Reigns has constantly been in action over the last six months, after he came back from a hiatus following his defeat at WrestleMania 40. He even main evented WrestleMania 41, night one. In that match, he was backstabbed by his Wiseman Paul Heyman who decided to side with his arch nemesis Seth Rollins. Following that he made an appearance on the next RAW episode, where he was annihilated by the brand-new duo of Rollins and Bron Breakker, under the guidance of Heyman. Now it is being murmured around that Roman and Punk are gonna team up against the team of Rollins and Breakker, possibly at SummerSlam. So to build that match up, Roman might have taken a sabbatical from WWE TV.There were also rumors that the “Head of the Table” might have suffered minor injuries during either of the WrestleMania main event or the RAW episode in which he appeared. To nurse that injury he might have taken a rest of week or two. Since he would have been required in some kind of action on RAW, WWE might be circumspect with Roman, as he is one of the biggest stars and crowd pullers in the WWE currently.Although Heyman betrayed both Punk and Reigns on the same night, when he decided to help Rollins through a steel chair, there might be plans by the WWE management to put Rollins against Roman separately. Reigns not being a part of the RAW segment involving Rollins, Punk and Breakker also indicates the same. Therefore, Reigns might be utilized to have a one on one storyline against one of Seth or Breakker going ahead.","Roman reigns has been absent from wwe tv for the last six months.

Bombay Sport Exchange Ep 4: Prof. Ratnakar Shetty on BCCI, cricket politics & Indian cricket's growth

Mumbai Indians were supposed to fly to Chandigarh on Wednesday evening and from there to Dharamsala, but that plan has now been cancelled due to logistic hurdles. This is because several airports along the border of Pakistan – Jammu, Srinagar, Leh, Jodhpur, Amritsar, Bhuj, Jamnagar, Chandigarh, and Rajkot – have been closed until 5:30 am IST on May 10th, following India's strikes on Pakistan terrorist camps early Wednesday as part of Operation Sindoor.There is no clarity yet on whether they would be able to fly out of Mumbai. The team was all packed and set to fly, but with the government order on airport shutdowns, they are still camped in Mumbai. However, Mumbai airport runway operations are scheduled to be closed for six hours tomorrow (Thursday, May 8th) for pre-monsoon maintenance, not due to Operation Sindoor.Multiple airlines have already issued advisories and have suspended operations because of the current geopolitical situation. It is now set to impact the travel plans of few Indian Premier League (IPL) teams who are in Dharamsala, and were scheduled to reach this week for their respective matches.While Punjab Kings (PBKS) and Delhi Capitals (DC) are already there for their match on May 8, Mumbai Indians (MI) were scheduled to reach later this week.As of now, unless there is a government directive, the match between DC and PBKS will go as per schedule.With Dharamsala airport, and neighbouring Amritsar and Chandigarh airports shut, the teams and the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) would look to swing a travel plan in action.""We will have to wait and watch for now. There is no option because even Chandigarh airport is shut so we need to see what can be done. Two teams are already here and MI were supposed to arrive later this week for their match on May 11. The nearest option is the Delhi airport but that would mean a long road journey for the teams. We are tracking government advisories and will take the call as necessary,"" said a senior BCCI official.Both PBKS and DC haven't heard anything from the Indian cricket board.Dharamsala is set to host two fixtures this week and the current airspace situation could well force the Indian cricket board to keep the alternatives ready.","Several airports along the border of pakistan have been closed.

Will Robert Woods be the fix for Steelers' young offense?



Steelers reportedly trading WR George Pickens to Cowboys | Pro Football Talk | NFL on NBC

The Pittsburgh Steelers shook up their offseason by trading for DK Metcalf , pairing him with the explosive George Pickens to create a formidable receiving duo. However, while the top of the depth chart shines, the bottom remains a concern. Enter Robert Woods coming off his worst season yet. At 32, can he really provide the depth the Steelers need, or is Pittsburgh’s gamble on Woods a sign of a bigger problem?Instead of using the 2025 NFL Draft to address a thin wide receiver corps, the Steelers went a different route.They selected quarterback Will Howard and running back Kaleb Johnson as their only offensive picks leaving out a rookie receiver or any real development on the depth chart. The team is clearly placing its trust in Metcalf and Robert Woods to carry the load. But is that a smart bet?Signing the 32-year-old Woods to a one-year, $2 million deal may seem low-risk, but it raises more questions than answers. After all, Woods is coming off the worst season of his 12-year career with just 20 catches, 203 yards, and zero touchdowns. On a Texans team ravaged by injuries, Woods still couldn’t make an impact. That’s not a bad year, it’s a decline.Still, Pittsburgh is hoping Woods can provide veteran leadership and solid run-blocking, shoring up a fragile receiver room. But this move feels more like desperation than a strategic play. With Calvin Austin III still unproven, and limited options beyond Metcalf and Pickens, is Woods really the answer?Also Read: Why trading George Pickens to Dallas could backfire spectacularly Arthur Smith’s offense values physicality and veteran know-how, but relying on Woods, who hasn’t scored in over a year, feels like patching up a much bigger problem. The Steelers had a chance to inject some youthful energy into the position during the draft but chose to roll the dice on a veteran who might be past his prime. If Woods can turn back the clock and make an impact, it will be a welcome surprise. This move is more of a gamble than the Steelers are willing to admit. As they chase playoff contention, the weight of this decision could make or break their chances.","Pittsburgh steelers signed dk metcalf, george pickens, and robert woods.

Rafael Devers shifting to first could open the door for Nolan Arenado at third

Cardinals have leverage, and Chaim Bloom’s Boston ties could shape the deal

Just as the Boston Red Sox were starting to gain some momentum in their playoff chase, the bottom fell out. Slugger first baseman Triston Casas was lost for the season with a knee injury suffered in a collision at first base, leaving a hole to fill in the infield and in the batting order. Now, as the front office looks to get off the mat somehow, one name has resurfaced — Nolan Arenado. The St. Louis Cardinals have been trying to trade the veteran third baseman, and the Red Sox, suddenly in need of infield help, may finally be a match.So rather than stand pat for the next few seasons, as top prospect Triston Casas (currently held back by a sprained thumb) plays his way up to the majors, the Red Sox could fast-track a maneuver that’s been whispered about inside the team for some time. Devers has been competent at third, but he has never been a defensive secret, and moving him over to first could both help the team’s collective glove work and extend his career. That would, of course, open up third base — where Arenado would fit perfectly.He had a tough year in 2024, but the veteran Gold Glover is making a comeback in 2025, and he still provides imposing defensive value and leadership. He was in his prime, but he has the potential to bolster any lineup. For the Red Sox, Arenado would represent a pure stopgap solution, but could also represent a longer-term fix at the hot corner.Any deal involving Arenado will come with financial considerations. The Cardinals are reportedly insistent that any team trading for him absorb a significant chunk of his remaining contract. With the Red Sox now in need and willing to compete, St. Louis might find itself in a rare position of leverage.The potential deal is complicated by the presence in the Cardinals’ front office of Chaim Bloom. Bloom had previously headed Boston’s baseball operations and had played a big part in drafting and developing many of their current prospects. His knowledge of Boston’s farm system could also expedite conversations and close valuation gaps. It might not just be speculation: An Arenado-to-Boston blockbuster could happen if the stars align.Also Read: Red Sox’s Alex Bregman is one swing away from joining the 200 HR club","Red sox could pursue nolan arenado as star 1b heads to il.

""It’s been an absolute honour to represent my country in whites. Thank you for all the love and support over the years,"" he wrote.
