Carlos Alcaraz completed his post-match TV interviews after defeating Novak Djokovic 6-4, 7-6 (4), 6-2 in the U.S. Open semifinals on Friday.Before beginning the interviews, Alcaraz paused to check his phone for updates on Jannik Sinner's semifinal match against Felix Auger-Aliassime, which was still in its first set.Sinner later secured his place in the final with a 6-1, 3-6, 6-3, 6-4 victory over Auger-Aliassime. This set up a historic US Open final between No. 1 Sinner and No. 2 Alcaraz, marking the first time two players will face each other in three consecutive Grand Slam finals in one season.""These two players are the best in the world right now,"" said Djokovic, a 24-time major champion.The duo has dominated men's tennis, splitting the past eight major trophies and claiming 10 of the past 13. Alcaraz currently holds five Slam titles, while Sinner has four.The upcoming final will also determine the No. 1 ranking, with President Donald Trump expected to attend.The rivalry between Alcaraz and Sinner has intensified throughout the year, with Alcaraz winning at the French Open in June and Sinner prevailing at Wimbledon in July.Sinner aims to become the first repeat men's champion in New York since Roger Federer's five consecutive victories from 2004 to 2008.

So we know each other very well,"" Sinner said.Alcaraz had previously lost to Djokovic in their last two encounters - the Paris Olympics gold-medal final and the Australian Open quarterfinals. ""It's not easy playing against him, to be honest. I'm thinking about the legend; what he has achieved in his career. It's difficult not to think about it,"" Alcaraz added.Djokovic, at 38, showed signs of fatigue by the match's end. He reached semifinals in all four Slams this season but was eliminated each time, with three losses to either Alcaraz or Sinner.""It's frustrating on the court when you are not able to keep up with that level physically, but at the same time, it's something also expected, I guess. It comes with time and with age,"" the veteran admitted.""I still want to play ... (a) full Grand Slam season next year. Let's see whether that's going to happen or not, but ... Slams are Slams. They are just different from any other tournament. They are the pillars of our sport, the most important tournaments we have. But I do fancy my chances a bit more in best-of-three.""Despite leading 3-0 in the second set, Djokovic couldn't maintain his advantage against Alcaraz.""Today, I'd say, it wasn't the best level of the tournament for me, but I just kept a cool level (from) the beginning until the last point,"" he explained.Alcaraz appeared in a pink sleeveless shirt, sporting regrown hair after a recent buzz cut necessitated by his brother's failed attempt at being a barber.When asked about maintaining his new look if victorious on Sunday, Alcaraz responded: ""Even better. You will see. ... Surprise, surprise.""","Carlos alcaraz defeated novak djokovic 6-4, 7-6 (4), 6-2 in the u.s. open semifinals on friday.

Deion Sanders’ advice for Travis Hunter as a new dad



Travis Hunter embraces fatherhood and NFL dreams



Travis Hunter is stepping into fatherhood and the NFL at the same time, and one man who has been by his side throughout this journey is Deion Sanders. The Hall of Famer, who once recruited Hunter to Jackson State and later coached him at Colorado, recently shared heartfelt fatherly advice for the Jacksonville Jaguars rookie as he embraces life’s two biggest milestones — becoming a professional athlete and a dad.For Deion Sanders, Travis Hunter has always been more than a player. Their bond goes back to 2021 when Hunter, then the No. 1 recruit in the nation, shocked everyone by committing to Jackson State instead of a powerhouse like Florida State. He later followed Sanders to Colorado, where he won the 2024 Heisman Trophy as a two-way sensation. Through it all, Sanders played a fatherly role, especially during Hunter’s toughest moments.On the night Hunter lifted the Heisman, his biological father was absent due to legal troubles. Sanders stepped in, embracing the young star in what became one of the most emotional moments of Hunter’s career. Years later, when Sanders was quietly battling a bladder cancer scare and couldn’t attend Hunter’s wedding, the rookie showed up at his coach’s Texas ranch, standing by him as the two shared quiet moments fishing together.“Oh my god, I’m taking a deep breath because I love him to life — I love him like he’s my son,” Sanders said. “It’s funny when your son is now a father… it’s a beautiful thing.“The thing that I told him is let’s correct all the things that we think we didn’t receive as children and let’s do that in our fatherhood. No matter what happens, let’s make sure we are the best darn father that ever walked. That’s what I told him. I’m proud of him, I love him to life, and I miss him dearly.”It wasn’t coach-speak. It was a father figure speaking to someone he considers family. And Hunter will also be happy to get some off-field advice from Coach Prime.Travis Hunter, just 22, is now a husband and a father. He and his longtime girlfriend, Leanna Lenee, tied the knot earlier this year before welcoming their first child, a baby boy. In a heartfelt video titled “Dear Son…”, Hunter can be heard saying to his newborn, “Gotta be better than me.”The timing couldn’t be more symbolic. On September 7, Hunter will make his NFL debut when the Jaguars face the Carolina Panthers. It marks the start of two parallel journeys: one on the field as a top draft pick, and one at home as a father. With Sanders’ wisdom and his own determination, Hunter now carries two legacies — as a rising NFL star and as a dad committed to doing things right. Fans and critics will be watching Travis Hunter how he make his debut a dreamy one. he is ready to show what he is capable of and to prove that he is indeed a two-way player and rare.Hunter showcased his versatility in his regular-season debut, contributing on both offense and defense during Jacksonville’s 26-10 win over the Carolina Panthers on Sunday. ""I did my job,"" said Hunter, the No. 2 pick in the NFL draft. ""That was the main focus. I did what they asked me to do. I know I can do more and I know I can do better.""Also Read: Justin Jefferson injury update: Vikings may take cautious approach as hamstring issue raises long-term concerns","Deion sanders gives travis hunter fatherhood guidance.

Following the sudden passing of her ex-boyfriend, Konstantin Koltsov, in March 2024, the Belarusian star found support in a new relationship with Brazilian entrepreneur Georgios Frangulis.

She credited Georgios Frangulis with helping her focus on joy beyond the pressures of tennis.“There was a really tough period where I was really happy to have him by my side, always cheering me up, always making sure that we are doing some fun stuff,” Sabalenka told People. “But I make sure I kind of forget about tennis and focus on the good things and enjoy my life. Even when things are going wrong in my career. So yeah, he was my biggest support and yeah, really happy to have him by my side.”Their relationship became public when they were first pictured together in April 2024.

After graduating in 2014, he moved to the United States, first living in Miami and later in California.A spiritual person, Frangulis has spoken about how faith shaped his outlook. “I go to church a lot, talking to God does me good. I was influenced by both branches of the family. The spiritual side has always been important to me – as well as intuition,” he told Forbes Brazil.In 2016, Frangulis founded Oakberry, an açaí-based brand that has since expanded worldwide. Known for its bowls and smoothies, Oakberry now has hundreds of locations across more than 40 countries.

It's like an energy bowl, so I feel ready to go after I have it.”Beyond business, Frangulis balances his entrepreneurial career with his passion for motorsports. He has raced in Porsche GT3 Cup Challenge events and the Porsche Mobil 1 Supercup, finding in racing both adrenaline and escape.Georgios Frangulis has a visible presence in Aryna Sabalenka’s careerWhile Oakberry has sponsored tennis tournaments before, Frangulis admitted the experience of sitting in Sabalenka’s box is far more intense. “The toughest part is being in the box. It’s one of the most stressful situations I’ve ever experienced,” he said.“I never say anything during matches. I try not to show too much emotion, because Aryna notices everything – what everyone is doing in the box. I just clap as loudly as I can and make sure she feels supported.”Also Read: Who is Naomi Osaka’s husband?

What This Trade Means for Doncic and James

Thehave pulled off a blockbuster three-team trade designed to satisfy the competing timelines of two NBA superstars: Luka Doncic and LeBron James. The deal bringsto Los Angeles, giving the Lakers a much-needed big man to complement both James’ immediate championship aspirations and Doncic’s long-term potential. The trade also involves the Utah Jazz and the Miami Heat, with draft picks and key role players exchanged in a move that reshapes each team’s future.The proposed deal was outlined by Bleacher Report’s Andy Bailey and highlights how the Lakers aim to build a roster that balances short-term title hopes with long-term growth. As CBS Sports’ Jasmyn Wimbish noted, “Doncic being just 26 gives the Lakers a far longer timeline to build a championship-contending team, but that doesn’t mean they can slow down and take their time.”The Los Angeles Lakers face a delicate balancing act. LeBron James, now in the later stages of his career, is focused on competing for a championship before retirement. His camp, led by agent Rich Paul, has made it clear that James values “a realistic chance of winning it all.” At the same time, Luka Doncic, who is only 26, is pushing for a quicker rebuild rather than a slow, drawn-out process.LeBron’s priorities are clear. His agent told ESPN, “LeBron wants to compete for a championship.He knows the Lakers are building for the future. He understands that, but he values a realistic chance of winning it all.”Doncic, too, made his intentions known. He told Lakers president Rob Pelinka and coach JJ Redick in May that he isn’t interested in waiting and wants the team to build aggressively.The Lakers, stuck between these timelines, now hope that Lauri Markkanen’s arrival provides both a present threat and future opportunity.• Los Angeles Lakers• Utah Jazz• Miami Heat• Lauri Markkanen• Rui Hachimura• Austin Reaves• Gabe Vincent• Dalton Knecht• 2026 first-round pick• 2031 first-round pick• Terry Rozier• Rui Hachimura• Gabe Vincent• Dalton Knecht• 2026 first-round pick (from Lakers)• 2031 first-round pick (from Lakers)• 2031 first-round pick (from Heat)• Lauri Markkanen• Svi Mykhailiuk• Austin Reaves• Svi Mykhailiuk• Terry Rozier• 2031 first-round pick• Acquire Lauri Markkanen, a versatile forward-center who fits both James’ immediate title ambitions and Doncic’s long-term rebuilding timeline.• Gain cap space flexibility by offloading multiple players and draft assets.• Add a reliable lob threat and interior presence that Doncic has been pushing for.• Sacrifice depth by trading away multiple rotation players.• Give up valuable future draft capital.• Receive a collection of players to strengthen their bench and future prospects.• Acquire three first-round picks, including two from the Lakers, enhancing their long-term rebuild.• Lose a key contributor in Lauri Markkanen.• Part ways with Svi Mykhailiuk.• Add depth by picking up role players like Austin Reaves and Svi Mykhailiuk.• Lose Terry Rozier and a future first-round pick.For Luka Doncic, the trade ensures he has a weapon at the rim, solving a longstanding issue for his style of play. Though he remains focused on long-term success, this acquisition shows that the Lakers are committed to building a contender without unnecessary delays.For LeBron James, Markkanen’s presence addresses his need for a big man who can help him compete immediately. The trade signals that the Lakers are serious about giving him a legitimate shot at another title before he retires.As Jasmyn Wimbish wrote, “Doncic being just 26 gives the Lakers a far longer timeline to build a championship-contending team, but that doesn’t mean they can slow down and take their time.”This blockbuster trade is a calculated gamble that attempts to balance the Lakers’ dual priorities - present success with LeBron and future contention with Doncic. While it costs them depth and draft assets, it finally gives them a foundational piece in Lauri Markkanen.For the Jazz and Heat, the trade offers opportunities to rebuild and retool for the future, while the Lakers double down on immediate relevance.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Los Angeles Lakers Explore Trade for $100 Million Brooklyn Nets Superstar; Austin Reaves as Key Asset?

NEW DELHI: At a Grand Slam where fashion goes hand-in-hand with tennis, it was Aryna Sabalenka who had the last laugh at Flushing Meadows. More than that, she created a lasting impression on and off the court while it rained outside the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in Queens, New York.On the court, she beat Amanda Anisimova 6-3, 7-6 (3) to successfully defend her US Open title. In the process, she pocketed her fourth Grand Slam title and 100th victory at majors.And at the trophy ceremony, the fashion supremacy kicked in as the Belarusian wore a metallic silver jacket, matching perfectly with the silver of the trophy she had received from 18-time major champion Chris Evert Sabalenka has four now, in comparison, including two at the US Open, winning back-to-back titles. No one had won two in a row at Flushing Meadows since Serena Williams in 2013-14. Before the tournament began, she was asked about this long run.""Wow, that's insane, you know, how unpredictable women's tennis is, right? Should we change it? Should we try at least to change it?"" said the 27-year-old, before adding, ""My thought is to change that.""And she changed that successfully on Saturday evening with the roof closed over Arthur Ashe Stadium.Despite what the scoreline suggests, it wasn't all smooth sailing as she would have liked. Sabalenka, who likes to express her feelings on court, and lets her box know in the process, started slowly as Anisimova forced her into the corner.And that is one position Sabalenka doesn't enjoy. She was shoved into that place during the French Open final loss to Coco Gauff, acknowledging how stressed she got against the American in Paris.This time, too, she was broken at 3-2 in the opening set and smacked the ball away in frustration.Instead, she won the next four games, as Anisimova's risk-reward game of winners to unforced errors tipped towards 13-15. Sabalenka converted all three of her break point chances, served better, returned better, kept the error rate down. In fact, she made three unforced errors in the first five games and made none in the next four.Then in the second set, the World No. 1 twice led by a break, served for the title at 5-4 and came within two points of closing it out. An overhead had her backpedalling, and the smash went flush into the middle of the net. Anisimova converted the break point, and the 24,000 fans were up on their feet.Was this going to be the breaking point for Sabalenka? And the turning point for New Jersey-born Anisimova? Not quite.About 15 minutes later, Sabalenka was on her knees, both her hands covering her face in jubilation, having just converted her third match point opportunity in the tiebreak.That her first major of the year, after two painful final losses to Americans, came in a tiebreak felt fitting. It extended her record to 21-1 in breakers this season, including 19 in a row, and underscored that the defeat to Gauff in Paris was a rare blip.“All those tough lessons (were) worth this one,” Sabalenka said. “I’m speechless right now.”“It’s been tough this year. In those finals, I was really terrible. But come on, it’s worth it, right? Thank you so much. I love you; you’re my family. Thank you to my boyfriend — without your support, I wouldn’t be able to make it,” she continued.As the silver jacket shimmered under the artificial Arthur Ashe lights, Sabalenka’s victory felt bigger than the previous three. It was the culmination of a season in which she turned lessons from painful defeats into fuel, and a reminder that women’s tennis, often accused of unpredictability, now has a figure who is setting the tone at the very top.Her brash energy on court, the roars, the clenched fist directed at her team are contrasts to the poise and flair she projects once the battle is over. Few athletes today blur the lines between raw emotion and refined spectacle quite like Sabalenka; and in New York, the stage rewards both.","Aryna sabalenka beat amanda anisimova 6-3, 7-6 (3) to successfully defend her us open title. She pocketed her fourth grand slam title and 100th victory at majors. No one had won two in a row at flushing meadows since serena williams in 2013-14.

NHL Trade Rumors: Could trading Brandon Carlo be the Maple Leafs’ only path to a top-six forward?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/nhl-trade-rumors-could-trading-brandon-carlo-be-the-maple-leafs-only-path-to-a-top-six-forward/articleshow/123746780.cms,"Brandon Carlo (Getty Images)

Brandon Carlo as a key trade asset and team cornerstone

The challenge of balancing the roster post-trade

The Toronto Maple Leafs are facing a difficult decision as they look to strengthen their forward group for a Stanley Cup run. Rumors suggest defenseman Brandon Carlo could be on the trade block, a move that could provide the team with a top-six scoring forward. While this approach may seem like “robbing Peter to pay Paul,” it reflects the modern NHL reality: acquiring elite offensive talent often requires moving a significant current asset.Carlo was brought in to anchor the Maple Leafs’ blue line, offering a steady presence and defensive balance alongside offensively-minded players like Morgan Rielly. His value league-wide is undeniable—a durable, right-shot defenseman in his prime is a coveted asset for any contender. As such, Carlo represents GM Brad Treliving’s most substantial leverage to pursue a game-changing forward. While depth options like Jack Roslovic exist, they don’t provide the kind of impact a true top-six forward can offer.Trading Carlo would solve one problem but immediately create another. His departure would leave a hole on the right side of the defense, requiring the Leafs to acquire a puck-moving, offensively capable defenseman to maintain balance.Pursuing a player like Erik Karlsson is a tantalizing idea, yet the logistics and financial implications make it a complex endeavor. Treliving would essentially need to orchestrate a multi-team, multi-player strategy to achieve both goals without compromising the team’s defensive core.Also Read: NHL Trade Rumors: Toronto Maple Leafs could part ways with Calle Jarnkrok and David Kampf For Leafs fans, this is a high-stakes puzzle: could trading Carlo finally provide the offensive spark the team needs, or is it too risky to gamble with a cornerstone defender?

The 31-year-old wide receiver enters the 2025 season with an NFL record streak of 11 consecutive 1,000-yard receiving seasons.

The Fever are coming into this matchup as favorites, with sportsbooks offering aand apoints in their favor. The implied probability for an Indiana win stands between 70% and 75%, signaling strong confidence from betting markets. Washington enters as underdogs with, reflecting their struggle in recent games and statistical gaps.• Indiana Fever: -250 to -288, indicating a strong likelihood of winning outright.• Washington Mystics: +200 to +230, making them an underdog option for bettors seeking higher payouts.• The spread favors the Fever by 6.5 to 7 points, suggesting that sportsbooks expect them to dominate but still account for some competition.• The Fever’s recent form and key player performances support the notion that they’ll cover the spread.• The total points line is set between 160.5 and 161.5, with prior meetings between these teams often trending higher than the line.• Expect a moderately high-scoring game, especially given the Fever’s offensive consistency and the Mystics’ defensive vulnerabilities.Kelsey Mitchell is the driving force behind the Fever’s offense. Averaging over 20 points per game along with 4-5 assists, she frequently surpasses this combined prop, making it a solid choice for bettors.Mitchell’s growing role as a facilitator enhances the value of this prop bet. She’s been actively creating opportunities, and the odds of +122 reflect confidence in her distributing the ball.For the Mystics, rookie standout Sonia Citron has struggled to consistently score. Recent trends suggest she’ll likely fall below this threshold, making this an attractive bet.• Same game parlays combining these props with the Fever covering the spread and the total going over 160.5 points can offer enticing higher payouts for bettors willing to take calculated risks.The Fever lead in offensive rating, scoring efficiency, and net rating, while also holding a slight edge in rebounding and assists. The Mystics are relatively close in defensive efficiency, but their struggles in scoring and turnovers give the Fever a decisive advantage heading into the contest.• Covered the spread in 4 of their last 5 games.• Hold an 8-1 record against weaker Eastern Conference teams.• Kelsey Mitchell continues to be a scoring leader, while Aliyah Boston anchors both rebounding and assists as a center.• Offensive and defensive metrics signal sustained momentum leading into this matchup.• Lost their last 5 games, revealing inconsistency.• Slightly better against the spread when playing at home, but overall underperforming.• Rookies like Kiki Iriafen (top rookie rebounder) and Sonia Citron (leading rookie in 3-point shooting) offer flashes of promise but can’t offset team-wide deficiencies.• The team ranks low in free throw percentage and steals, both potential liabilities against a sharp, well-rounded opponent like the Fever.Based on statistical analysis, betting odds, and expert predictions, Indiana Fever are the clear favorites. Their superior record, net rating, and balance between offense and defense give them a clear edge. The Fever’s ability to cover the spread has been demonstrated in recent games, and sportsbooks are aligning with this outlook.The Mystics’ home court advantage and young talent provide intrigue but are unlikely to compensate for their broader struggles, particularly in scoring efficiency and turnovers.• Take the Fever moneyline at -250 to -288 or the spread of -6.5 to -7 points with odds around -110.• Focus on Kelsey Mitchell’s over 23.5 points + assists or over 4.5 assists, where her role as the team’s primary scorer and facilitator is undeniable.• Explore same game parlays including the Fever covering the spread, Mitchell’s assist prop, and the total points going over 160.5 for higher payouts.• Mystics moneyline bets should generally be avoided unless presented with unusually high odds, as their form and stat deficits make them a risky choice.• Check player availability and late-breaking injury news before placing bets, as absences or returns could dramatically shift the betting landscape.The upcoming matchup promises an engaging contest between a dominant team in the Indiana Fever and a struggling but youthful Washington Mystics squad. With better efficiency, stronger defense, and consistent star performances, the Fever are well-positioned to secure a win.
