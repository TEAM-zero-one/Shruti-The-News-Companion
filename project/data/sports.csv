Gretzky emphasized the allure of traditional hockey markets like Edmonton, contrasting them with the financial benefits of playing in Florida.

Wayne Gretzky, the face of hockey greatness, has ignited a fierce debate that goes beyond the ice rink—one that’s raising eyebrows across NHL circles and beyond. While appearing on The Pat McAfee Show, ""The Great One"" opened up about the financial disparities in the league, taking subtle aim at how no-state-income-tax franchises like the Florida Panthers might be gaining an upper hand in the talent war.Speaking candidly, the Great One, Wayne Gretzky stated, “Obviously Florida and Tampa Bay is a unique situation…from a financial point of view, if that’s what a player’s thinking about, obviously, but if a player’s thinking, you know, what I want to play in a hockey culture, like playing and living in the city of Edmonton, I loved it for 10 years.”Gretzky’s words struck a chord—highlighting the growing tension between market-driven decisions and hockey's traditional roots. While Florida teams like the Panthers can offer higher take-home pay due to their tax structure, cities like Edmonton offer something money can’t buy: fan intensity and legacy.The Panthers’ on-ice success, including multiple Stanley Cup Final runs, has coincided with the state’s tax-friendly policies, allowing the team to recruit and retain talent without overspending. That advantage, though legal, raises a question of fairness. Could this be undermining the NHL’s competitive balance?Wayne Gretzky didn’t directly accuse teams of exploiting the tax loophole—but his tone was clear.When discussing Edmonton, he reflected, “You leave the arena in Edmonton, you know you’ve been in a hockey game…1.3 million have watched that game and the other 200,000…the only reason they didn’t is because they were working.”In response to the buzz, Panthers head coach Paul Maurice emphasized the area’s growing sports culture and praised efforts to build community over competition. ""I think there’s room for all of us down here, certainly enough people. And I think that it’s a great thing that you have sports that are foundational—football, basketball, baseball, and then the new sport, hockey—and there’s room for everybody there. So how about we just share it? We share the spotlight. ”Maurice also lauded GM Bill Zito’s cross-sport cooperation with the Dolphins and Marlins, saying, “Bill’s been kind of involved. Best practices…our team services people get together, right, to scout out the best of things when we travel.”Also Read: “It took a toll”: Wayne Gretzky's daughter Paulina Gretzky opens up about parenting struggles, body image In the end, Wayne Gretzky’s comments have lit a fuse—pitting hockey tradition against market innovation.

Cam Skattebo's viral moment provokes criticism over NFL history blind spot



Does Cam Skattebo know ball? 🧠

A generation gap or something more?



by face





New York Giants first-year running back Cameron Skattebo became the focus of an unintended NFL tempest—nothing on the field, but for seemingly not knowing anything about the league's greatest legends. In one recent video making its rounds on the internet, Cameron Skattebo can't recognize NFL legends from their pictures, kicking off an emotional Reddit discussion in which fans toggle between anger and empathy.Cameron Skattebo, who played college football at Sacramento State Hornets and Arizona State Sun Devils before the New York Giants drafted him in the fourth round of the 2025 NFL Draft, soon found himself a topic of conversation on Reddit—but not the kind related to his athleticism.In one clip of him now circulating, Cameron Skattebo misidentifies players during a quiz segment. When presented with a picture of Calvin Johnson, better known as ‘Megatron,’ confusion set in.Redditors were both amused and frustrated. One of the top comments stated, “Not knowing Calvin is wild, but an NFL player not knowing Brett Favre is crazy ffs.”Another commenter joked, “Banish him from the league for this,” and others reluctantly empathized, one of them noting, “To be fair, though, Calvin retired when Skattebo woulda been like 13 or 14, and he wasn’t a guy who was in many commercials or broadcast booths.So it’s not thaaaat crazy with all that in mind.”""They’re so disappointed they’re almost speechless by the end lol. The joy fully sucked out of the room,"" another user said.""Well we didn’t teach him memory skills at ASU I guess,"" a fan joked.""Tbf I haven’t seen most of these guys without a helmet on,"" another defended, ""I got Colston and Megatron though.""""This dude off my draft board,"" one Reddit user said to which another replied, ""I imagine Cam needs to watch it again too. Dude looked like he got concussed 4 times during it.""A fan tried to defend Skattebo's 'ignorance' by commenting: ""Calm down guys, memory is hard. I can't even remember the last time the Buffalo Bills won a superbowl.""""As a filthy casual with incredible face blindness I feel seen,"" another added.The discussion soon escalated beyond Cameron Skattebo, with wider questions about how younger players identify with the history of the league. One commenter wrote that most players don't grow up watching the NFL but rather center on their own development or college careers. “A lot of these guys don't even follow the NFL til they get to the league. Might have been a college fan, or just doesn't watch football,” another Redditor wrote.Even fans conceded trouble identifying helmet-wearing players by face alone. “Not really. I wouldn’t recognize Joe Montana from face alone probably. I definitely wouldn’t recognize megatron from face alone. I think people here are forgetting these dudes play in helmets lol. Outside of a handful of players there’s probably not many non-Eagles I could recognize,” admitted one commenter.""I mean, not knowing Golden Tate, Kam Chancellor, and Darren Sprolesis honestly understandable,"" one more added.Nevertheless, the overall opinion was tilted towards incredulity, particularly in light of Johnson's place in NFL legend.While the NFL-Fan base in turn roasted and justified Cameron Skattebo's viral blunder, the moment highlighted something greater—the transience of fame, the changing tides of fandom across generations, and the way legacy players disappear from popular consciousness sooner than we want them to. Skattebo learned this lesson not offered in college: understanding the past can inform how you're perceived in the present.Also Read : Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce delight fans with synchronized dance at Tennessee wedding",New york giants first-year running back cameron skattebo can't recognize nfl legends from their pictures.

Allen Iverson shares posts dedicated to son Isaiah Rahsaan Iverson and wife Tawanna Turner





Former NBA legend, Allen Iverson shares a heartwarming post for his son, Isaiah Rahsaan Iverson on his Instagram. The post contains photos from Isaiah’s childhood, teenage years, and graduation ceremony. Allen went on to praise him saying that he’s the true definition of what a son should be, and the way he always looks out for family is what makes him better than others. He goes on to say how proud of a father he is. However, this post came days after Allen dedicated an entire post for ex-wife, Tawanna Turner.Allen Iverson talks profoundly about his son Isaiah on his recent Instagram post. He talks about Isaiah’s qualities and how he is a son that every father will be proud of.“The true definition of a son,” says Allen as he starts the post, showing how proud he is of Isaiah.Iverson further went on to say how Isaiah takes care of his mother and siblings, and never disrespects his parents. He also went on to say that Isaiah always puts family first and takes responsibility heads on. From his post it seems after Allen and Tawanna separated, it was Isaiah who put on the ""head of the family"" tag and took good care of the family.However, this post comes days after Allen dedicated an entire post to ex-wife Tawanna Turner, with whom he shares five children, Allen Iverson II, Isaiah Rahsaan Iverson, Dream Alijha, Tiaura, and Messiah Lauren. The post had a montage of the couple’s photos from prom, early court days, and as such. Allen captioned the photo as “HER” followed by heart and crossed fingers emoticons.Allen and Tawanna tied the knot in 2001, and had a happy marriage for quite some years. However, trouble entered their married life in the form of lavish expenditures, Iverson’s questionable parenting skills, and alcohol habits. In 2013, when Iverson retired from the world of NBA, his married life also came to an end. The couple called it quits in 2013 and agreed to co-parent their kids. Their divorce made headlines back in 2013 due to all the chaos it unraveled. With Iverson being officially bankrupt and declaring in the court that he doesn't even have money for a cheeseburger to Tawanna literally pulling out $61 from her purse and giving it to the NBA legend, the couple has seen it all. Tawanna has been Iverson's rock through all ups and down, and they still remained friends after the divorce. Iverson even gave a special shoutout to Tawanna in his Hall of Fame speech in 2016.However, it seems Allen’s life turned upside down soon after his lady luck left. After retirement, Allen spent all of his fortune on expensive cars, and lavish lifestyle. Due to this, he became bankrupt by 2015. Despite getting into the Hall of Fame in 2016, life was still in shambles for Iverson. The once NBA legend was back in square one, starting from scratch.Allen was at his top during his time with the Philadelphia 76ers, when he won the MVP of the year in 2001. He also went on to win the Rookie of the Year award in 1997. During the Game 1 of NBA Finals of 2001, Iverson scored 48 points against the Los Angeles Lakers, which was a record in itself. It was during this time that Iverson was the peak of his career, after which his life took a complete 180-degree turn.However, things have started taking turn for Iverson as he recently signed a deal with Reebok and agreed to be the Vice President of basketball division for the brand. He had earlier made a lifetime deal with Reebok back in 2001, which brought him $800,000 per year. The contract also had a clause that stated Iverson will get an additional $32 million at the age of 55. Will the new role help Iverson turn the course of events or will he fall back into old habits? It remains to be seen.Also Read: Carmelo Anthony spilled beans on weirdest reason why Larry Brown suspended LeBron James, Allen Iverson, and Amar’e Stoudemire just before Olympics",Allen iverson shares posts dedicated to son isaiah rahsaan iverson and wife tawanna turner.

Poll Do you think Vanessa Bryant handled the pregnancy rumors well? Yes, very cleverly No, she should have addressed them directly





After days of unrelenting speculation, Vanessa Bryant took to Instagram Stories on Sunday, June 1, to put the rumors to rest. Her response wasn’t a press statement or a legal warning, it was a wild meme with a big middle finger to the internet trolls. The meme featured music icon Rihanna floating in water with a snorkel mask on her head, holding a drink, and flipping her middle finger.“Me protecting my peace, not pregnant & having fun all summer,” Vanessa Bryant wrote in the caption on her response to the online trolls who spread her pregnancy rumors about five years after her husband, Kobe Bryant’s, untimely and devastating demise.It was clear, clever, and vintage Vanessa who shut down noise without saying a word about the origin of the gossip. No press release needed when you’ve got Rihanna energy with a direct middle finger gesture.The rumors had emerged out of nowhere, with some users pointing to photos allegedly showing a ""baby bump,"" though no timestamps or context were attached to those images. Vanessa hasn't been publicly linked to anyone romantically, and there’s been zero confirmation from her side—until now.Also Read: Is Vanessa Bryant pregnant with her 5th child? The Internet speculates about her relationship with rumoured BF In another Instagram Story later that evening, Vanessa shared a motivational quote that hinted at how she views the entire situation and what matters to her personally.“The only way to impress me, is by being a good person,” the quote read. “I don’t care what you have, what you wear, where you live, or what you drive. I just have deep respect for people with pure hearts and good intentions.”Adding one final touch to her trilogy of clapbacks, she posted another Rihanna meme, this one stating, “I’m not mean, I’m just not the one.”With the classic Rihanna memes, Vanessa showed that she is busy being a proud mom to her daughters while being the powerhouse of her business ventures. While she does not care about the rumor mill, her reaction explicitly showed that she is urging privacy.Vanessa, who shares four daughters with Kobe— Natalia, Bianka, Capri, and the late Gianna— has remained devoted to family and philanthropy. Most recently, she shared footage of a joyful family ski trip over the holidays, showing the tight-knit bond she maintains with her children.Vanessa and Kobe Bryant tied the knot in April 2001. Tragically, in January 2020, Kobe and their 13-year-old daughter Gianna lost their lives in a helicopter crash that also killed seven others. They were headed to Kobe’s Mamba Sports Academy for a youth basketball game when the accident occurred. Kobe was 41 at the time. The loss shook the sports world and left a lasting impact on fans, friends, and loved ones across the globe. Kobe has left a huge legacy to his name as well, he is considered one the of the elite NBA superstars of all time with astounding stats, records and intense playmaking abilities. His demise created a huge void in the NBA world as fans are still mourning his untimely passing.Since their passing, she’s kept their memory alive through meaningful business ventures and charitable work. Kobe launched the Mamba Sports Foundation in 2016, aiming to support young athletes. After his death, Vanessa renamed it the Mamba & Mambacita Sports Foundation in honor of both Kobe and Gianna. Today, the foundation helps underserved boys and girls in sports, pushing forward the mission they believed in. It's her way of carrying on their legacy with purpose and heart.Vanessa Bryant’s response was indeed witty and empowering as she hinted that she deserves privacy and reminded the world that while she may be a public figure, her peace and dignity aren’t up for debate, especially not over unfounded gossip.","Vanessa bryant addressed her pregnancy rumors in a wild instagram story.

Wayne Gretzky’s past support of Donald Trump sparks criticism—and vandalism

Fans defend The Great One and focus on his legacy





As the Edmonton Oilers chase their first Stanley Cup title since the Gretzky era, some fans are revisiting a controversy that’s been simmering in the background—Wayne Gretzky’s open ties to Donald Trump. But for many in Edmonton, politics are taking a backseat to playoff pride.Earlier this year, Wayne Gretzky found himself at the center of political backlash after appearing at Donald Trump’s inauguration alongside his wife Janet Jones. He had previously been seen socializing with Trump at Mar-a-Lago and even appeared to give a thumbs-up to Team USA as honorary captain during the 4 Nations Face-Off. The optics didn’t sit well with many Canadians—especially after Trump suggested Canada could become the “51st state” of the U.S.The fallout was swift. A petition to rename Wayne Gretzky Drive garnered over 14,000 signatures, and a statue of the hockey legend outside Rogers Place was smeared with what smelled like feces. Security fences were later added to protect the statue from further vandalism.Despite the controversy, local support for Gretzky remains strong—especially as the Oilers try to capture their sixth Stanley Cup. “Let’s forget about the past.What he did here was a lot for the city, a lot for hockey,” said Craig Hiscock, who was seen taking a photo with Gretzky’s statue ahead of Game 1.Longtime fans like Brian Foulken echoed the sentiment. “At the end of the day, (Gretzky) played here for a long time. The diehard Oilers (fans), we love him,” he said. Darren Rogers added that Gretzky’s leadership and records outweigh his political appearances: “Politics aside, that accomplishment should matter more.”Now 64, Gretzky is still learning about the new culture surrounding the game. After Edmonton’s Game 1 overtime win, he was puzzled by the team’s latest post-game tradition. “Pink Pony—is that a band or is that a song?” he asked on TNT Sports, referring to Chappell Roan’s viral hit.“It’s the new generation, Wayne,” replied Paul Bissonnette. Smiling, Gretzky responded, “I gotta get that (as) my ringtone.”Also Read: Wayne Gretzky sparks controversy by accusing Florida Panthers of buying success with tax loopholes",Edmonton oilers are chasing their first stanley cup title since the gretzky era.

Lauren Kyle’s personal touch and passion win praise from Connor McDavid





While Connor McDavid continues his relentless quest for the Stanley Cup with the Edmonton Oilers, his wife Lauren Kyle is quietly building a legacy of her own—and the NHL superstar couldn’t be more impressed. Known for her creative drive and entrepreneurial ambition, Kyle is turning heads not just as McDavid’s partner, but as a force in business, design, and hospitality.Lauren Kyle is currently managing five different ventures—ranging from a thriving interior design firm to a chic fashion label, a furniture showroom, a cookbook brand, and most recently, a trendy small-bites restaurant called Bar Trove. The restaurant’s launch in downtown Edmonton coincided with the Oilers’ return to the Stanley Cup Final, and it quickly became a local sensation.McDavid, in a rare and heartfelt comment, revealed what sets Kyle apart from other business minds. “Vision is one thing. Kyle's gift is making it come to life,” he said. “She comes up with an idea and just gets after it… So many people just don't follow through, and I think that's what separates her. It's been fun to watch her try something and then follow through and do it.”Beyond her professional achievements, McDavid noted that it’s Kyle’s compassion and heart that truly drive her success.He highlighted how her ventures aren’t just about aesthetics or profit—but about creating meaningful experiences for others.“She's got a big heart.

Controversy around the Imane Khelif’s gold medal at Paris Olympic



IOC calls findings misinformation



Response of World Boxing

Fairness and safety concerns from athletes and federations



Ongoing debate on gender and sport eligibility





A leaked medical report from the 2023 World Championships has revealed that Olympic boxing champion Imane Khelifis biologically male, according to chromosome analysis. The report, made public just days after World Boxing ordered Khelif to undergo sex testing for eligibility in future female competitions, shows she has a male XY karyotype. This revelation challenges the International Olympic Committee’s (IOC) earlier dismissal of such tests and has intensified debate over fairness and safety in women’s boxing. The findings come amid ongoing controversy surrounding Khelif’s participation in women’s events, sparking calls for stricter verification procedures in sport.The report, published on the 3 Wire Sports website, states that Khelif’s chromosome analysis is “abnormal” and confirms a male karyotype. It was conducted by Dr Lal PathLabs in New Delhi, a lab accredited by the American College of Pathologists and certified by the International Organisation for Standardisation. This directly challenges the IOC’s spokesperson Mark Adams, who had described such test results as “ad hoc” and “not legitimate” during a press conference at the Paris Olympics.The controversy surrounding Imane Khelif ’s Olympic gold medal run began as early as her first bout in Paris, where she faced Italy’s Angela Carini.Carini, an experienced and respected boxer, was visibly shaken during the match. Overwhelmed by Khelif’s strength and intensity, she appeared distressed and left the ring in tears after the fight, later telling media she had feared for her safety. The unease only deepened in the final bout, where Khelif defeated Taiwan’s Lin Yu-ting in a dominant display that many felt was physically one-sided. The power difference between the fighters drew sharp criticism, with commentators and athletes calling it “uncomfortable to watch” and likening it to watching a man beat a woman in the ring. The moment became one of the most controversial of the Paris Games, fuelling an international debate over fairness and inclusion in women’s sport.IOC president Thomas Bach dismissed the report as part of a Russian-led misinformation campaign, citing ethical and financial issues within the International Boxing Association (IBA), which conducted the tests. Despite these claims, the legitimacy of the Indian lab’s certification has increased pressure on the IOC to clarify its position and respond to questions about Khelif’s eligibility.Following the leak, World Boxing has declared that Khelif must pass mandatory chromosome testing before competing in any future female events. The 26-year-old Olympic champion, who was allowed to compete in Paris due to her female passport status, has so far not provided evidence to confirm female chromosomes. World Boxing now requires all athletes over 18 in its competitions to undergo PCR genetic testing to verify their sex, a measure introduced in response to this controversy.The case has raised serious safety and fairness concerns within the boxing community. Opponents like Italy’s Angela Carini and Mexico’s Brianda Tamara have spoken out about the physical challenges they faced competing against Khelif. Latin American federations have been particularly vocal, urging that women’s competitions be restricted to athletes assigned female at birth, in order to protect fairness and athlete safety.The Khelif controversy highlights the complex and sensitive issues surrounding transgender and intersex athletes in competitive sport. It underscores the need for clear, consistent policies that balance inclusivity with fairness and safety. As governing bodies reassess their rules, the case remains a key example of the challenges faced in maintaining the integrity of women’s sports.The ongoing debate around Imane Khelif’s case brings to light just how complex and emotionally charged the conversation about gender and eligibility in sport has become. At the heart of it are real athletes — women who train for years and step into the ring expecting fairness. Many feel blindsided and unheard when competing against opponents whose physical attributes raise legitimate concerns about safety and equality. This isn’t about exclusion, but about protecting hard-won opportunities for women in sport. Khelif’s story reminds us that governing bodies must act transparently, thoughtfully, and with empathy for all athletes involved.",Imane khelif ’s medical report contradicts ioc’s official position.
