NEW DELHI: New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon made a remark related to rivalry in cricket between the two nations during a joint press conference with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday, which led to laughter. Luxon mentioned New Zealand’s recent cricket losses to India and thanked Modi for not bringing them up.""I really appreciate that PM Modi didn't raise New Zealand's Champions Trophy loss to India and I didn't raise our Test victories in India. Let's keep it that way and avoid a diplomatic incident,"" Luxon said.India won the ICC Men’s Champions Trophy for the third time on March 9, defeating New Zealand by four wickets in the final at the Dubai International Stadium. In November 2024, New Zealand had defeated India 3-0 in a Test series. This was the first time India was whitewashed in a Test series of three or more matches at home.Also read: First time in 91 years!

They welcomed the signing of a Memorandum of Cooperation on Sports to strengthen collaboration and engagement.

Is Rodgers headed for a coaching role in San Francisco?



Aaron Rodgers Caught Deeply Contemplating His Future On Beach | Pat McAfee Show

Why the 49ers and Why now?



Aaron Rodgers’ future in the NFL remains one of the biggest talking points in football. While teams like the Pittsburgh Steelers and New York Giants are rumored to be in the mix, a surprising alternative has emerged—coaching. Reports suggest Rodgers may step away from playing in 2025 and join the San Francisco 49ers ’ staff, potentially setting the stage for a major leadership role in the future.Rodgers has repeatedly dismissed the idea of coaching post-retirement, but circumstances change. As one of the most intelligent quarterbacks in NFL history, he possesses the strategic mind that could make him a successful coach. With insiders predicting that he may not suit up in 2025, some believe he could step into a coaching role with the 49ers, possibly positioning himself as Kyle Shanahan ’s eventual replacement.""While Kyle Shanahan is safe for the 2025 NFL season, there is a real chance that his future in 2026 is not,"" Marissa Myers noted. ""With that in mind, it presents the perfect opportunity for Rodgers to take the next step in his career, and enter the realm of coaching."" (via: Sporting News)Also Read: Steelers set to sign veteran QB in 2025 Free Agency, but it’s not who you think Shanahan has guided San Francisco to multiple deep playoff runs, but his tenure has also been marked by inconsistency. With four playoff misses in eight seasons, concerns about his long-term viability continue to grow. Critics argue that his inability to adapt is holding the 49ers back. Rodgers, a four-time MVP, could bring a fresh perspective and serve as a mentor for young quarterback Brock Purdy, helping the team transition into its next phase.Adding to the intrigue, Rodgers’ California roots make this move even more compelling. A lifelong 49ers fan, he once dreamed of being drafted by them. If he transitions into coaching, leading his hometown team would be a full-circle moment in his storied career, cementing his legacy in a way few could have predicted.Rodgers remains unpredictable, keeping fans and analysts on edge. But if he decides to swap his helmet for a headset, the 49ers could be his next big move, one that not only shakes up the NFL landscape but also solidifies his place in football history as both a legendary player and a strategic mastermind on the sidelines.","Reports suggest aaron rodgers may step away from playing in 2025 and join the san francisco 49ers ’ staff.

Donna Kelce’s health struggles highlight importance of support systems



Travis Kelce, the NFL's most well-known star, has been the subject of debate regarding his future in football. While fans wonder if he will retire, fresh reports indicate that personal reasons, such as his mother Donna Kelce's health issues, are taking center stage in his decision-making.The Kansas City Chiefs tight end, Travis Kelce has never been shy about his tight-knit relationship with his family, especially his mom, Donna Kelce. She recently shared about a difficult health condition that has touched their family deeply. Though details are not made public, it's clear that her condition has given Kelce's already grueling career an added emotional burden.Her fight is a harsh reminder of the need to put both physical and emotional health first. The NFL has come a long way in advancing health awareness, from pushing regular medical check-ups to developing mental health programs. Kelce, through his own experiences, is also increasing the call for these conversations.Travis Kelce's retirement has become a burning issue, particularly following another Super Bowl win with the Chiefs. Whereas his physicality in the sport has been questioned extensively, now his mental and emotional health become important factors.Balancing the constant demands of professional football with personal issues is no simple matter. Kelce's case highlights how deeply personal issues can drive an athlete's career choices. Whether it's injuries, family obligations, or mental exhaustion, these issues weigh heavily in deciding how long to remain in the game.Mental health activism in sport has gained pace over the past decade, with great numbers of athletes openly discussing their dilemmas. Kelce's case further reiterates the need for support mechanisms, both team-based and family-based, to allow players to make choices that promote their well-being.Kelce's impact is felt off the field as well.

Kylie, 32, and Jason, who tied the knot in 2018, are already proud parents to Wyatt, 5, Ellie, 4, and Bennett, 2. As her due date comes closer, Kylie has remained remarkably candid about the challenges and joys of pregnancy, offering her fans an unfiltered look into her life through her popular podcast, Not Gonna Lie With Kylie Kelce.Throughout her pregnancy, Kylie has kept things real, sharing both the excitement and the discomfort that comes with carrying a child.

""Get your foot--- thank you.""After a brief cut in the recording, Kylie humorously explained the situation. ""There’s no room in there anymore,"" she admitted while trying to adjust her body for comfort. ""I can't breathe. And it hurts,"" she added with a laugh. Despite the discomfort, Kylie managed to keep her sense of humor, resuming the podcast with a cheerful, ""And we’re back!""Beyond choosing a name for her fanbase, Kylie and Jason are also grappling with the challenge of naming their fourth child. During the same podcast, Kylie shared how they’ve yet to settle on a name and might even surprise everyone with an unconventional choice. ""There is a good chance that this child doesn't even get two T's,"" Kylie teased. ""People are very invested in this, but I just feel like a curveball might be fun.""Kylie Kelce also opened up about the physical toll of pregnancy in a previous episode. She described how her ""child’s butt is so far into [her] lungs"" that she struggles to breathe properly. Despite the discomfort, Kylie’s down-to-earth attitude and candid updates have resonated with her listeners.As for her podcast fanbase name, Kylie hinted that she’s leaning toward ""The Real Ones.""

Porter's exceptional three-point shooting could address the Lakers' weaknesses as they aim for a deep postseason run. However, Denver's desire to retain Porter might complicate the deal.

""Denver was adamant about retaining Porter amid NBA trade rumors this season,""

The Los Angeles Lakers are reportedly considering a major roster shakeup as they weigh the possibility of parting ways with Austin Reaves to pursue Denver Nuggets star Michael Porter Jr. The move, which could significantly bolster the Lakers' three-point shooting, comes amid their push to solidify their position in the Western Conference playoff race.Since acquiring Luka Doncic in a blockbuster trade on February 2, the Lakers have shown flashes of brilliance but have struggled recently, losing their last three games. The team is still in the running for the No. 2 seed in the West despite the defeats. Under head coach JJ Redick, the team's three-point shooting has been a clear problem this season, as they only shoot 35.7% from beyond the arc.This has led to speculation that the Los Angeles Lakers may target Michael Porter Jr., a proven three-point specialist, in the offseason. Porter, who signed a $179 million contract with the Nuggets, has been one of the league's most consistent long-range shooters since entering the NBA. As a rookie, he shot an impressive 42.2% from downtown and has maintained a high level of efficiency, connecting on at least 39.7% of his three-point attempts in four of his last five seasons.This season, the 2023 NBA champion is averaging 18.2 points and 6.9 rebounds per game while shooting 50.6% from the field and 39.9% from three-point range. His ability to move without the ball and deliver a flawless release makes him an ideal fit for a Los Angeles Lakers team in need of reliable perimeter shooting.While Austin Reaves has been a versatile and valuable asset for the Lakers, Porter's elite shooting could provide the team with a significant upgrade. Reaves has been a key contributor, but his skill set may not be enough to address the Lakers' most pressing needs.However, acquiring Porter won't be easy. The Nuggets have consistently expressed their commitment to keeping him, especially after his crucial role in their championship run.making it unlikely they would part with him unless he experiences a decline in performance.Also read: NBA Offseason Rumors: Golden State Warriors eyeing $90 million Los Angeles Clippers star to push Stephen Curry and Jimmy Butler's championship aspirations As the playoffs approach, the Los Angeles Lakers are expected to keep a close eye on Porter's situation.

Wayne Gretzky’s Wife, Janet Jones, Was Struck By A “Dislodged Plexiglass Pane” When She Attended A Match In 1997



Ulf Samuelsson knocks out Wayne Gretzky's wife

Wayne Gretzky , the former NHL player, has been facing a tough time ever since he got involved in a controversy where fans have accused him of supporting Team USA at the 4 Nations Face Off. His wife, actress Janet Jones , have tried defending him against the trolls but has failed miserably. But there was a time when Wayne Gretzky’s wife, Janet Jones, went to support him at a match and ended up unconscious.Back in 1997, Wayne Gretzky’s team, the New York Rangers , was playing against the Chicago Blackhawks when his wife, Janet Jones, decided to support her husband and attend the match.But an eventful match quickly turned into a disaster when two women, including Wayne Gretzky’s wife, Janet Jones and an unidentified woman, were hit by a “dislodged Plexiglas pane”.Wayne Gretzky’s wife, Janet Jones, became unconscious as soon as she was hit on her head by the Plexiglass pane. She also suffered a cut in her lower lip due to the force.The Plexiglass pane was dislodged when the New York Rangers’ Ulf Samuelsson checked the Chicago Blackhawks’ Sergei Krivokrasov. Both of them ran into the boards which was near the benches after they lost balance,This caused the Plexiglass pane to be dislodged and struck Wayne Gretzky’s wife, Janet Jones on her head.Janet Jones was taken to St. Luke - Roosevelt’s Hospital in Manhattan while the former NHL player, Wayne Gretzky, concentrated on his game after he was assured about his wife’s health.As per the New York Times, Wayne Gretzky spoke about the incident and said, “It’s tough to put it out of my mind. It was one of those can’t-win situations when I got out there. Maybe I shouldn’t have gone back out.”He added, “There really wasn’t a lot for me to do at that time. Kevin Stevens’s wife was with her. We knew at that point that she was going to be O.K.

3. Rikishi to come to Jey Uso’s aid in winning the World Heavyweight Championship

2. The Queen of Stratusfaction might double up Tiffy Time



1. The Texas Rattlesnake to inflict venomous wounds on the Brahma Bull

The Road to WrestleMania has been lit up already and it keeps on getting exciting with every succeeding day. WrestleMania 41 might be big in terms of wrestling icons returning to the ring to craft masterpieces.As WrestleMania 41 has already seen some epic storylines in the mix while speculations soar through the roof about the rest, fans simply cannot wait for the caravan to reach Las Vegas. If John Cena’s heel turn wasn’t already a major talking point, now it is about what surprises lie ahead.Until now, four matches have already been booked, even though the stars being a part of the story arc may vary as per late-minute inclusions or detractions. John Cena will be taking on Cody Rhodes for the WWE Undisputed Championship while Tiffany Stratton will be locking horns with Charlotte Flair for the WWE Women’s Championship.In another couple of match-ups at Las Vegas, Gunther will be defending his title against Jey Uso, and Iyo Sky will be duking it out with Bianca Belair to defend her Women’s World Championship. With more matches to come and more tales to tell, WWE will also be keen on crafting iconic returns for the Showcase of Immortals. Here are three superstars who can return at WrestleMania 41.Off late, Rikishi has been quite active on social media and has been reacting to the Bloodline posts. With all the speculations garnering momentum, it can well be expected that Jey Uso won’t be standing alone. Gunther, being the heel, definitely would be doing everything in his arsenal to try to put down Jey. Just when the chips feel down, and Rikishi’s music could hit, and the fans would be going absolutely bonkers over the father-son duo. Add the Banzai Drop to the mix and the roof’s coming off in the Allegiant Stadium.Trish Stratus teamed up with Tiffany Stratton at the Elimination Chamber while taking on the duo of Nia Jax and Candice LeRae. Now with Charlotte Flair being the opposition of Tiffany Stratton, there are high chances that another rivalry might take centerstage. Back in 2019, Charlotte went all guns blazing against Trish as a rivalry of generations unfurled. As the duo locked horns at the SummerSlam 2019, it was eventually Flair who won the battle. It is not new for WWE to rekindle the past, and if Trish Stratus costs Charlotte the title, it would be aiding Tiffy and, at the same time, avenging her defeat from six years earlier.Earlier in an interview, Stone Cold Steve Austin used the remark ‘Anything can happen’. Since then, it is expected that an age-old rivalry that used to drive the audiences crazy back in the day might be reignited. As The Rock gears up for John Cena’s challenge against Cody Rhodes, SCSA might come down the pike once again to aid the American Nightmare, thereby sparking a colossal pop that will be one to savor over the years. Whatever the scene is, it won’t be surprising if the glass breaks all over the titantron once again.Also read: Steve Austin Refuses to Offer John Cena Any Advice After Shocking Heel Turn in WWE","The road to wrestlemania 41 has been lit up already and it keeps on getting exciting with every succeeding day.

He proved his pivotal prowess in offensive and defensive fronts last year.Mookie Betts will be sent back to LA to recover from illness completely!Dave Roberts shared a shocking update on Mookie Betts' recovery from his illness. According to The Atheltic’s Fabian Ardaya’s tweet, the team is contemplating keeping the shortstop star entirely away from the Tokyo Series exhibition games and sending him back to LA to speed up his recovery.Per the team’s latest plans, Mookie will likely be given complete rest to ensure faster recovery. Thus, he will be missing from the upcoming clash against the Chicago Cubs scheduled this week at the Tokyo Dome. Explaining Mookie’s condition, Roberts said:“He’s still trying to find his way [physically].” He continued, “I think the question is, what’s best to get him ready for opening day? We’re still talking. That’s on the table.”The situation is disappointing for the Dodgers team and fans. Their two-way genius, Mookie Bett, is struggling with an illness, which LA Times’ Jack Harris confirmed in his report dated March 16, 2025, to be a ‘ stomach virus infection .’Earlier, Roberts, while talking to the press about the Tokyo experience on Saturday, also revealed Mookie’s condition.He said he was feeling better and planned to engage him in hitting balls and taking ground balls the next day. However, the latest update seems to suggest something different.In February 2025, Mookie announced moving to a shortstop position from his right-field forte. The change was strategized to strengthen the Dodgers’ infield as Mookie showed good form as the shortstop last year when he played 65 of 116 games at this position.Mookie is an OG shortstop, as the Boston Red Sox drafted him to command this spot. However, his golden era began after moving to the right outfield, where he bagged recognitions like All-Star and Gold Glove during his time with the Red Sox and the Dodgers.Mookie's stunning performance last year cemented his position on the Dodgers’ team. The team’s plan to give him complete rest is a thoughtful step to help him be at his best at the regular-season game against the Detroit Tigers on March 27.Also Read: Mookie Betts confident in shortstop role despite Manny machado’s concerns over tough transition","Dodgers manager dave roberts shared a shocking update on mookie betts ‘illness’ he shared that the team is contemplating sending him back to la.

Liv Morgan Revenge Tour

Liv Morgan isn’t just another WWE champion. She’s a problem. The kind that makes crowds boo louder, the kind that hijacks segments, the kind that gets exactly what she wants—even if it means wrecking the lives of everyone around her. Theis running strong, and there’s no end in sight.She’s done waiting for WWE to believe in her. They gave her a couple of runs as a babyface, but let’s be real—those weren’t it. The crowd wanted to root for her, but it never felt. She’d climb, she’d fall, rinse, repeat. WWE had her play the underdog so long, people forgot she could bite back. Now? She’s all bite. No leash.The second she got back from injury, Liv Morgan went after Rhea Ripley . She didn’t even wait for a match—just took a steel chair, went backstage, and wrecked her. A few months later, Ripley was injuredand forced to vacate the Women’s World Championship. Morgan took the title for herself. And now she’s spending every week making Dominik Mysterio ’s life hell while Judgment Day watches in horror.This isn’t the Liv Morgan WWE tried to build. This is the one she built herself.Long before WWE, Liv Morgan was just a kid in New Jersey, wrestling in a homemade ring with her brothers, pretending to be Lita. There was no roadmap. No indie scene. Just a girl who liked wrestling and got lucky in a way most wrestlers don’t.She wasn’t grinding in small promotions or building a reputation on the circuit. She was working at Hooters, where she met an unnamed wrestler who changed everything. She told them she was a fan, rattled off her wrestling knowledge, and the next thing she knew, she was introduced to trainer Joe DeFranco. DeFranco trained Triple H . He had. And when WWE didn’t have an open tryout, he got them to fly her out anyway.Liv Morgan signed in 2014 and started training at the WWE Performance Center in Orlando. It wasn’t pretty.Her first big moment inwasn’t even in the ring—it was as a planted fan at, jumping Tyler Breeze during his entrance. She wrestled a few months later under the name “Marley” and got squashed by Eva Marie. She was bad. She knew it.She kept losing. Then she rebranded as Liv Morgan and started losing. WWE didn’t see her as a star. She was just there. She got her first televised win nearly a year later against Aliyah, but by then, everyone already knew what came next—call-ups were happening, and she wasn’t on the list.Then WWE did what WWE does. They threw her into a faction.Liv Morgan didn’t get called up alone. She debuted onin November 2017 with Ruby Riott and Sarah Logan as. It was chaos from day one—they ran through Becky Lynch , Naomi, Charlotte Flair, and Natalya, making it clear they weren’t just filler.The chemistry kept them together longer than planned. Ruby Riott later admitted that WWE never had a long-term plan for them, but Vince McMahon liked the energy. That’s all it took. They lasted until 2019 before WWE split them, and just like that, Morgan was on her own.WWE tried, They gave her video vignettes. They teased a new character. They had her interrupt Lana and Bobby Lashley’s wedding to say she’d been having an affair with Lana. And then? Nothing.Rusev (now AEW’s Miro) later revealed that WWE only wrote the segment formoment—to get a reaction. No long-term story. No follow-up. Just shock value.After that? WWE threw her back with Ruby Riott and called itagain. It lasted a year before WWE fired Riott.Morgan was alone again, but this time, WWE actually pulled the trigger.She wonin 2022. Cashed in the same night. Beat Ronda Rousey for the SmackDown Women’s Championship. It was a huge moment. But the reign itself? A mess.WWE booked her weak. At, she technically tapped to Ronda Rousey’s armbar, but the ref counted Rousey’s shoulders down. The crowd turned on her. By, Rousey took the belt back.She pivoted to tag teams, won the WWE Women’s Tag Team Championships with Raquel Rodriguez (twice), got injured (twice), and disappeared.Then she came back. And everything changed.Liv Morgan’s return at thewas big. She entered last at No. 30, made it to the final two, and lost to Bayley. Then she lost again at, eating the pin from Becky Lynch.But instead of fading back into the background, she did something WWE didn’t expect—she made herselfstory.She went after Rhea Ripley. No match. No buildup. Just a steel chair and an injury that ended up beingreal. Ripley had to vacate the Women’s World Championship, and when WWE booked a battle royal for the vacant title, Morgan almost won—but Lynch got her again.Thenhappened. Dominik Mysterio “accidentally” helped Liv Morgan win. Suddenly, she was Women’s World Champion.Since then? She’s beenMysterio’s life.She kissed him after he cost Becky Lynch a rematch. She stole his vest. She gave him a hotel room key. Judgment Day is losing their minds. Mysteriolike he’s trying to resist, but is he? Or is WWE slowly setting up the biggest betrayal in months?The best part? Nobody knows.What’s clear is that WWE has found something thatwith Liv Morgan. The audience hates her. She’s getting booed louder than most top heels. Her pairing with Dominik Mysterio is getting more heat than half of Judgment Day.It took a decade, but Liv Morgan finally figured out how to thrive in WWE.Here’s the truth: Liv Morgan has never hadmatch.She’s solid in the ring, but she’s not Rhea Ripley. She’s not Becky Lynch. She’s not Bianca Belair. She’s never delivered a match that defines a career.What shehave is the best character work of her career. Theis WWE’s best women’s storyline right now. But is that enough?Charlotte Flair is waiting. Bianca Belair is coming back. Rhea Ripley isn’t gone forever.Morgan’s reinvented herself. Now she has to prove she can stay at the top.Also Read: WWE SmackDown: Liv Morgan Expects an Apology from Bianca Belair After Jade Cargill’s Attacker Exposed","Liv morgan’s rise to the top of wwe started in backyard rings and a hooters restaurant.

Sacramento Kings injury report for tonight’s game against the Memphis Grizzlies (March 17, 2025)

When and where to watch the Memphis Grizzlies play tonight against the Sacramento Kings (March 17, 2925)?

Memphis Grizzlies star Ja Morant is listed as OUT with a shoulder injury ahead of Monday’s matchup against the Sacramento Kings at Golden 1 Center. The Grizzlies, currently 43-25, are already dealing with multiple injuries, and Morant’s potential absence could significantly impact their performance.Ja Morant, averaging 19.6 points and 5.5 assists over the last 20 games, is a key player for Memphis. His shoulder issue adds to the team’s injury woes, with Zyon Pullin out (knee), Vince Williams Jr. day-to-day (ankle), and Santi Aldama day-to-day (calf). The Memphis Grizzlies, who lead the NBA in scoring with 122.7 points per game, rely heavily on Morant’s playmaking and explosiveness.The Kings, sitting at 33-33, have their own injury concerns. Jae Crowder is day-to-day with a back issue, while Trey Lyles is questionable due to a back injury. Despite these setbacks, Sacramento remains competitive, ranking ninth in the league with 116.3 points per game. Zach LaVine, their leading scorer, averages 23.6 points, while Domantas Sabonis dominates the boards with 14.1 rebounds per game, the best in the NBA.The game, scheduled for 10 p.m. ET on March 17, will be broadcast on NBCS-CA and FDSSE, with live streaming available on Fubo. Fans can also engage with the action through FanDuel Fantasy.Memphis’ depth will be tested with Ja Morant being sidelined. Desmond Bane, averaging 17.4 points and 6.7 rebounds, and Jaren Jackson Jr., contributing 16.9 points and 3.6 rebounds, will need to step up. The Memphis Grizzlies’ rebounding strength, second in the league at 47.6 per game, could be a deciding factor against Sacramento’s 44.6 average.As both teams navigate injuries, Monday’s game promises high stakes. Ja Morant’s absence will be a blow for the Grizzlies and could tilt the balance in this Western Conference showdown.","Ja morant, averaging 19.6 points and 5.5 assists over the last 20 games, is a key player for memphis.

All-out Performance from Jesper Bratt & Heroics of Darcy Kuemper

Montour matches NHL record scoring 4 SECONDS into OT! 🦑🚨🫨

The NHL had an extremely exciting week of record-breaking performances and entertaining finishes. Jesper Bratt dominated the scoreboard for the New Jersey Devils, recording an incredible nine-point mark, and maintaining rock-solid goaltending for the Los Angeles Kings Darcy Kuemper. Seattle Kraken's Brandon Montour made history with a record-equalling overtime goal, and now Jack Eichel has set a new single-season points record for the Vegas Golden Knights. Meanwhile, players had their safety issues brought back to life as reckless hits opened old wounds.Joseph Bratt, though, came as close to what might reasonably be termed the most effective week for any NHL forward with a tally of three points in games against both the Columbus Blue Jackets and the Edmonton Oilers. This was thereafter followed up with another 3-point, 3-assist night in a 7-3 defeat by the Pittsburgh Penguins and sealed him with a nine-point haul, making him the top scorer in the league for the week.Meanwhile, it was a near-impenetrable defensive wall as he played three games, allowing only one goal, with a shutout victory against the Washington Capitals and Nashville Predators for his 200th NHL career victory. The above also accounts for a top-notch contribution to the playoff push of the Kings with an unbelievable 98.7% save percentage. Florida Panthers' Sergey Bobrovsky also made a personal best when he got his 424th win in the NHL, placing him in the top 10 goaltenders of all time.Brandon Montour's Lightning-Fast Goal & Record-Breaking Season For Jack Eichel: Only four seconds elapsed from the start of overtime when defenseman Brandon Montour of the Seattle Kraken provided one of the season's most electrifying moments with a game-winning goal. This all followed a perfectly executed faceoff play by Chandler Stephenson to set Montour up for a blistering finish past Jakub Dobes. With that, he recorded the fastest overtime goal, tying him with Claude Provost, Denis Savard, and James van Riemsdyk in the record books as tied for this league mark. Moreover, Montour broke a franchise record for goals in a season by a Kraken defenseman.Eichel of the Vegas Golden Knights eclipsed the franchise record of William Karlsson for points in a single season, finishing with 80 this season. He is also quite close to making it a potential 100-pointer, having left 16 games behind, which would boost his already impressive standing as an elite forward in the NHL. Unfortunately, the week resulted in even more than action: it was a week of unearthed bone-judging towards player safety. Bursting from the unfortunate collision, Buffalo Sabres' Jiri Kulich got a severe hit, while Vancouver Canucks' Filip Chytil, a concussion history patient, took an even more dangerous hit from Jason Dickinson of the Chicago Blackhawks. Many called for suspending Dickinson, but he somehow escaped. Ladislav Smid, former NHL defenseman, emphasized that players needed to show more respect for each other on the ice, thus needing stricter enforcement against reckless plays.Also Read : Brandon Montour Makes NHL History with the Fastest OT Goal in the Seattle Kraken’s Comeback Win From Jesper Bratt's show-stopping offensive play to Brandon Montour's monumental goal, the NHL has provided stellar entertainment.

Penta’s brother Rey Fenix could be joining WWE



Rey Fenix in not the only new alleged member to join SmackDown



In a mysterious teaser clip shown to fans on last Friday's episode of WWE SmackDown, on March 14, we got to see a luchador sitting on top of the corner turnbuckles. The identity of the masked man is yet to be revealed, but fans are speculating that someone very familiar could be joining the WWE squared circle. The latest and newest masked wrestler in WWE was Penta - who became one of the biggest names in the promotion soon after he joined. And now, it looks like his brother, Rey Fenix might be making an entrance into the stage as well. But the Lucha Bros are still a far off dream.The former AEW star Rey Fenix might soon join his brother Penta on the WWE roster . The speculations started soon after his contract with the AEW officially and finally came to an end, despite some hiccups. But now that all is done and dusted, it looks like Rey is ready to join his brother in WWE. But as of now, it seems he could be joining WWE under the SmackDown brand instead of RAW, unlike his brother.Many fans were hoping for a Tag-Team duo with the brothers now that Rey Fenix is alleged to be joining WWE. But those aspirations will have to take a back seat for now, unless Triple H and the people working backstage think that bringing back the Lucha Bros to the ring is something they really want. Considered one of AEW’s best tag teams, the Lucha Bros were once a thing of beauty. But with the rumors currently afloat, chances are Fenix will be making his WWE entry as a standalone star like his brother.The last episode of SmackDown showed not one but two mysterious teaser clips. While one of them is speculated to be of Rey Fenix because of the silhouette shown on the clip and Rey’s recent update about contract expiration, the other clip did not give us a glimpse into the upcoming star. But what caught everyone’s eyes was the number 4 that popped up on our screens in the clip.But that was enough for some fans to speculate that Aleister Black could be making his comeback to WWE, after a few okayish years in the AEW. Black was one NXT’s biggest standout stars before he left WWE to join AEW and run the House of Black as Malakai. But now, with recent updates of his contract having expired with AEW, Black could be making his comeback to WWE alongside Rey Fenix, this time under the SmackDown brand.

Florida Panthers Make Sam Bennett's Extension A Priority

Sam Bennett is about to become one of the hottest free agents in the NHL, although he will probably stay with the Florida Panthers . The speculation about his future gets hotter as his contract expires after July 1. On the other hand, some reports have recently come to note that the Panthers have resumed their negotiations for contracts with him.Sam Bennett, 28, is wrapping up this final year of four years on a $17.7 million contract, carrying a cap hit of $4.425 million. Since joining the Panthers through a trade in 2021 from the Calgary Flames, he has established himself as an important cog in the system. The combination of offensive prowess and physicality makes him indispensable.Over 278 games in Florida, Bennett has scored 92 goals and added 98 assists. In the playoffs, he has scored a prolific 37 points from 54 postseason games. Bennett was for the Panthers in their 2024 Stanley Cup run as he notched 14 points in 19 playoff games while leading with 87 hits.He is characteristic of a blend of very skillful, gritty, and very leadership qualities. This indeed makes him valuable in all battles and in deepest playoffs. Bennett plays a dual game and can thus contribute in all areas. He can show up in scores or just through relentless forechecking; in the end, it's all Bennett. Florida has depended greatly on him for delivering such important moments, and unfortunately, his departure leaves that squad one massive gap.Once again, Bennett has proven to be up to the challenge with 22 goals and 45 points in 65 games this season. His combination of offensive flair and toughness would bolster any team's roster, hence why he is attracting teams' interest, with the Maple Leafs reported to be one of the interested teams. However, Panthers GM Bill Zito has made it very clear that he wants both Sam Bennett and other pending free agents, Aaron Ekblad, to stay in Florida. The front office is negotiating actively to secure such a deal before free agency begins.Also Read: ""I Haven't Played to the Expectations,"" Admits Vancouver Canucks Forward Elias Pettersson Sam Bennett's future is uncertain due to the coming free agency, but the Florida Panthers are doing anything possible to ensure that they will be able to acquire him. An agreement may be in sight before July 1 if the negotiations are back on course.

The rattling of the jar was the pennies on the dollar they let their Captain go for. Sick.”Another fan wrote, “Interesting phrasing…”Florida traded for Marchy” as opposed to “I traded Marchy to Florida”. Separating himself from the decision he made. Also like how his volume lowered every time he told a condition of the trade ending with a whisper “50% retention” “A third fan wrote, “Brutal.Terrible way to end it”, while another user wrote, “Guy should’ve been fired on the spot.

When Wayne Gretzky And Janet Jones Fell In Love In 1987 And Got Married Soon After



Wayne Gretzky | This Past Weekend w/ Theo Von #471

Wayne Gretzky, the NHL legend, has found himself at the centre of controversy as fans blame him for not supporting Team Canada at the 4 Nations Face Off’s final match against Team USA. While Wayne Gretzky has not issued a statement on the matter yet, his wife, Janet Jones, has defended him against the trolls. The two have been married for decades and it is pretty interesting how their love blossomed.Wayne Gretzky met his wife, Janet Jones, back in 1981 on the sets of Dance Fever. While Wayne Gretzky was there as a celebrity judge, Janet Jones was a dancer. While the two met there for the first time, they fell in love years later.In 1987, the two bumped into each other in Los Angeles and they soon went on a date and the rest is history.
