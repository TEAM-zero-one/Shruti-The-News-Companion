All eyes on Dak Prescott as Cowboys prepare for season-defining clash in Philadelphia



The Dallas Cowboys traded game-day gear for glamour on Monday night, hosting a Blue Carpet premiere for their upcoming Netflix documentary, which will debut on August 19. While the evening was filled with cameras, celebrities, and suited-up players, quarterback Dak Prescott still found himself in the headlines — this time for being labelled “overpaid” by ESPN’s Stephen A. Smith.Smith, one of the Cowboys’ most persistent and outspoken critics, wasted no time delivering his verdict on Tuesday’s edition of First Take. While the panel initially debated whether Dallas would be taking a bigger gamble by trading star pass rusher Micah Parsons or by locking him into a record-setting extension, Smith quickly shifted the conversation to Prescott.Calling the Cowboys quarterback “overpaid,” Smith argued that the team’s repeated restructuring of his contract five times in total was proof that the franchise has mishandled its financial planning. He reminded viewers that Prescott’s deal briefly made him the highest-paid player in the NFL last season, a status Smith insists is not justified by his postseason résumé.The criticism is nothing new for Prescott, who has often found himself under the microscope during his nine seasons with Dallas. Despite putting up strong regular-season numbers, his playoff record has fuelled doubts among pundits, with Smith being one of the loudest voices questioning whether he can lead the Cowboys to a Super Bowl.While Smith sharpened his barbs, the Cowboys enjoyed their Hollywood moment. Owner Jerry Jones, speaking at the premiere, said he relishes the attention, whether from fans or detractors, because it reflects the team’s enduring relevance.Also Read: Tom Brady on Josh Allen and Lamar Jackson: ‘I don’t love predictions and hypothesizing’ about first Super Bowl win That spotlight will intensify in Week 1, when Dallas travels to Philadelphia to face the defending NFC champions during their Super Bowl banner-raising celebration.

Green Bay Packers quarterback Jordan Love will undergo a minor procedure this week to treat a ligament in his left thumb, but according to the team, it’s not expected to affect his availability for the regular-season opener. The injury, sustained during a preseason game against the New York Jets, involves Love’s non-throwing hand, and Green Bay is confident he will return to practice as soon as next week.General Manager Brian Gutekunst shared the update during his press conference on Tuesday morning, reassuring fans that while the surgery is necessary, the timeline remains on track. Love was already back at practice Monday, with his thumb taped and participating in limited drills.Jordan Love hurt his thumb during the final play of a preseason matchup against the New York Jets. While the injury wasn’t immediately serious, medical evaluations revealed ligament damage that required minor surgical repair. “That last play when he kind of split two guys, I think a helmet just got it,” Gutekunst said.“I think he had some options with what he could do,” Gutekunst said, adding, “Obviously, you guys saw him out there, he certainly was able to function.But as we looked at all the options – and he did as well – the best option, I think, for him to get back the fastest and feel the best was to do this. And he wanted to go out there yesterday to kind of see how it felt. And once we got through that, we made the decision. And he should meet us in Indy on Wednesday. ”Though any injury during the NFL offseason raises concern, especially to a starting quarterback, the Packers seem to be treating this one as more of a bump than a roadblock. Gutekunst said, “I think as he gets back, we’ll kind of assess where he’s at. It’s one of those things where I think he’ll be back at practice next week. How much he can do leading into that Seattle game, we’ll kind of see. It’ll be day-to-day a little bit. You never want any of these guys to be out because you want to be working as a team. They all need the work, obviously. More importantly, he’ll be ready for Week 1, and that’s the most important thing.” He added, “I think we’ll get him back in plenty of time. And I don’t foresee this affecting him long-term at all.”The Packers are scheduled to travel to Indianapolis on Wednesday ahead of joint practices with the Indianapolis Colts on Thursday. The teams will square off in a preseason matchup on Saturday, though Love’s availability for that game is still unclear and likely dependent on how he recovers in the coming days.Love has looked good in training camp and his short recovery time isn’t expected to slow him down as the Packers get ready for Week 1.","Green bay packers quarterback jordan love will undergo a minor procedure this week to treat a ligament in his left thumb.

Florida Panthers’ veteran core pursues historic third Stanley Cup win



The Florida Panthers Are Aiming to Become a Dynasty

Matthew Tkachuk's status remains uncertain



A new wave of Florida Panthers prospects on the rise



The Florida Panthers head into the 2025-26 NHL season with one situation on the horizon—a chance to become part of hockey lore with a third straight Stanley Cup title. A tough-minded vision that has already etched its name on the biggest of stages is heading the team, and the Florida Panthers blend a mixture of issues: burnout from deep playoff runs, injury issues regarding top forward Matthew Tkachuk, and whether new additions and young players can shoulder the burden.The Florida Panthers roster remains pretty much the same as the team that beat the Edmonton Oilers in consecutive Stanley Cup Finals. But the pursuit of a three-peat will push them to their limits as never before.This year's journey will be made even more challenging by a condensed schedule to fit in the Olympic Winter Games Milano Cortina 2026. With over eight Panthers likely to represent their nations, head coach Paul Maurice will be required to monitor minutes closely.The biggest question hanging over camp is Matthew Tkachuk's health. The 27-year-old winger contributed 23 points in last season's playoffs with a torn adductor muscle and sports hernia suffered at the 4 Nations Face-Off. How and when he recovered isn't known, with general manager Bill Zito not ready to comment on whether Tkachuk had surgery.If Matthew Tkachuk starts the season on long-term injured reserve, the Panthers will enjoy short-term salary cap relief.But if he's healthy for opening night, Florida may be forced to make roster moves to stay under the $95.5 million cap.Goaltending depth in the spotlightVeteran netminder Sergei Bobrovsky, set to be 37 in September, is still Florida's undisputed starter. But the team will need backup, Daniil Tarasov, to play at least 20–25 games. Tarasov, acquired on a one-year contract, replaces Vitek Vanecek and has a checkered NHL resume, but the Panthers believe that goaltending coach Rob Tallas and Roberto Luongo's crew can help him elevate his game.Outside of the primary roster fight, Florida's system is a source of hope. Defenseman Matvei Shuravin, a 6-foot-4, mobile blue-liner, was a standout in the MHL in Russia, and University of Denver product Jack Devine paced the NCAA in scoring and might find his way onto the Panthers' roster earlier than anticipated.Also read: Competitive windows: Florida Panthers and Dallas Stars set the pace as goaltending remains a problem The Florida Panthers have built a championship culture defined by resilience, star power, and adaptability. This season will test all three. Whether it’s a healthy Matthew Tkachuk returning to form, Daniil Tarasov proving himself in the net, or fresh faces making their mark, Florida’s fate will hinge on balancing the grind of history with the hunger for one more Cup.","The florida panthers are aiming for a third straight stanley cup title.

Steve Kerr needed more minutes on the court to prove his mettle and gain visibility in the NBA sphere. An unexpected departure of Michael Jordan from basketball in 1993 provided precisely that. Kerr joined the Chicago Bulls via a non-guaranteed deal, and to affirm his position, he needed visibility. With more minutes, Kerr’s performance started showing up and helped him shape his career further. So, according to Kerr, it was ‘good for him’ that Jordan took a break from basketball.Kerr made this interesting revelation on the Glue Guys Podcast. He also took the listeners on a journey of what it was like playing with NBA giants like Scotty Pippen and Bill Cartwright, among others. He shared that these experiences transformed his career.Steve Kerr appeared on the Glue Guys Podcast and talked about his starting years with the Chicago Bulls. Kerr reminisced about the time when he had just started and hoped to share the court with legendary Michael Jordan. But Jordan took a break when Kerr entered the Bulls camp. As per Kerr, it worked in his favor. He called it a personal benefit. Talking about that experience, Kerr said:“Well, when I got there, it was right when Michael decided to go play baseball.So, I was I went there expecting to play with him or at least be on the team with him. I was actually trying out with a non-guaranteed contract, just trying to keep, you know, keep my place in the league.”Kerr needed play time to boost his presence on the team and NBA, and with Jordan not around, he got what he required. He said, “Yeah. So, um, it actually was to my benefit in some ways that he went because it opened up a bunch of playing time. Uh, it was bad for the rest of the Bulls and their fan base, but it was good for me.”Kerr’s performance followed an upward curve in Jordan’s absence. He became an 8-point player from the 5-point one, with play time increased to about 24 minutes per game. The exposure allowed him to play the high-stakes games and taught him to perform well even under pressure.Kerr’s candid confession received laughs from the podcast hosts, and they prodded him further to share his experience as the new player on the Bulls’ team.In the same podcast, Steve Kerr further shared how he amassed career-definingexperience while playing with the NBA biggies. He shared that he understood how easy it becomes to develop a championship-worthy team when the right team is in place. Kerr said:“It was uh, that's kind of where I reestablished my career. It was my fifth year, and I was probably on my way out of the league. But um, you know to to step in there and learn from Phil and play with Scotty Pippen and Horus Grant and Bill Cartwright, these champions, um, changed my whole career.”The Chicago Bulls resurrected when Michael Jordan came back after two years, and the wins started coming in thereafter, per Kerr. Talking about his learnings from playing in the company of great players, Kerr shared:“What I learned was it's a lot easier to develop a role, um, on a great team with great players than on an average team, where everybody's just like kind of confused as to, you know, who's the man and all that stuff.”Kerr shared how the clear hierarchy in Chicago allowed him to pitch in efforts precisely when needed, and it gave him a masterclass on building an impregnable forte, which he indeed applied later as an NBA coach.Also Read: Steve Kerr and Draymond Green share behind-the-scenes Golden State Warriors adopted to bolster defense Steve Kerr’s revelation tells how things fall into place when one is destined to play a bigger role.

This includes a whopping $500,000 as a one time settlement and a public apology from Anthony Edwards.These demands were detailed in court documents filed recently by Ayesha Howard in Los Angeles Superior Court.However, this has sparked outrage among fans even though many fans have blamed Anthony Edwards for getting involved in this legal mess.A fan by the username @cloud9_nb took to X and wrote, “He fell for it —Fellas need to watch whom they stick their d*cks into.”Another fan by the username @THEKingBuckeye wrote, “He brought this on himself. We can all sit here and have a conversation about how fucking retarded this girl sounds but at the end of the day Ant had no business having unprotected s*x with this chick this was supposed to be a one off or a side chick at the most there’s no reason you should be in this situation, but you did it to yourself.”A third fan by the username @FYMITSQ wrote, “Looking at your child like a cash grab is beyond loser shit, I don’t care how rich the dude is. This h*e is a LOSER.”Another fan by the username @uzinatorgxc wrote, “For life, not until the kid is 18?? An apology from Ant for not being the perfect prey or what? + $500k? You'd think a 39 year old woman didn't know that unprotected s*x leads to pregnancy. I hope she loses this time like the loser she is.“While Anthony Edwards remains silent, his ex girlfriend Ayesha Howard has issued a statement.As per US Weekly, Ayesha Howard said, “I want to make it clear that my request for compensation was never tied to agreeing to any custody orders.

A massive campaign involving wide receiver Jadon Sancho is turning into one of the most talked-about stories of the NFL offseason – and it’s not just about money or contracts. Fans of Besiktas, a major team in Türkiye, are doing everything they can online to convince the 25-year-old to make the jump. After reports linked Sancho to the team, fans stormed his Instagram with over 5 million comments, nearly all saying the same thing: “Come to Besiktas.” The post has since gone viral on social media.Nothing has been finalized yet, but the interest is clearly mutual – and fans are making sure their voices are heard. The English media has taken notice as the Instagram campaign has exploded. Several UK media outlets picked up the story after Sancho’s latest post got flooded with millions of comments. Most of them were just one message repeated over and over: a plea for him to join Besiktas. Sancho hasn’t said anything publicly yet about the possible transfer, but the attention around him is growing fast.Besiktas president Serdal Adali gave a direct update about the team’s interest. He made it clear they are serious about going after Sancho – but also realistic about what it would take to make the move happen. “Just as much as the community wants him, I want him too,” Adali said, adding, “What matters is not only our desire, but also if the player wants to come to Türkiye.We have a budget, and we will do our best to bring him here. ”Adali also admitted that it’s not easy to land a player like Sancho, who has played for some of the biggest clubs in Europe and may prefer teams in bigger competitions. “Players like Jadon Sancho usually prefer clubs playing in the Champions League. Whether it happens today or not, it is hard to say. If it is possible, we will get him. Besiktas fans can rest assured.”Jadon Sancho does have other options. He’s been linked with Borussia Dortmund, where he has played before and also with Juventus in Italy. But neither club is moving quickly at the moment. Dortmund is said to be unsure about bringing him back again, and Juventus is focused on selling players before adding anyone new. Another twist came when Chelsea decided not to keep him permanently after a loan spell. They paid a penalty fee instead of making a long-term deal, which put Sancho back on the market.Now, Besiktas sees an opportunity. The club is pushing hard and the fans are doing their part. But the final decision is still up to Jadon himself – and time will tell whether all the noise will lead to a deal.","Fans flood jadon sancho’s instagram in viral attempt to force manchester united exit.

"NHL Trade Rumors: Montreal Canadiens eye Mason McTavish, but Anaheim Ducks’ asking price for star center is steep",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/nhl-trade-rumors-montreal-canadiens-eye-mason-mctavish-but-anaheim-ducks-asking-price-for-star-center-is-steep/articleshow/123244737.cms,"Ric Tapia/GettyImages

Anaheim Ducks set high asking price for Mason McTavish, targeting Canadiens prospect David Reinbacher

Why Mason McTavish could be the perfect addition to the Montreal Canadiens’ roster

Trade chatter is swirling around Anaheim Ducks center Mason McTavish, with the Montreal Canadiens emerging as a frequent link. While Ducks general manager Pat Verbeek has made it clear he wants to keep the 22-year-old, reports indicate he’s open to moving McTavish if the return is right. That return, however, comes with a high price tag, one that could force Montreal into a tough decision.According to multiple reports, including Jimmy Murphy’s, Verbeek would only consider parting with McTavish for a young, right-handed defenseman capable of playing in a top-four role immediately, with the potential to grow into a first-pairing cornerstone and significantly impact the team’s long-term competitiveness while addressing their current defensive depth concerns.Within the Canadiens’ system, that description points directly to David Reinbacher, the fifth overall pick in the 2023 NHL Draft. The 20-year-old is widely viewed as Montreal’s top defense prospect and a key part of their future blue line.The Ducks’ reported request is straightforward, Reinbacher for McTavish — but it’s a steep cost for the Habs, who have been cautious about moving their top young assets.McTavish, 22, stands 6-foot-2, weighs 220 pounds, and plays a strong two-way game.Selected third overall by Anaheim in 2021, he has already compiled 140 points in 229 NHL games, including 60 goals. Last season, he tallied 52 points in 76 games, often in a third-line role and with limited power play time, suggesting even more offensive upside.For Montreal, McTavish would slot perfectly as a second-line center behind Nick Suzuki, giving the team a reliable scoring threat and added size down the middle. His combination of skill, strength, and playoff-style play makes him an appealing target, but surrendering Reinbacher could leave a long-term hole on the right side of their defense.The McTavish-to-Montreal speculation highlights a classic NHL trade dilemma, balancing the allure of an NHL-ready young star against the value of a blue-chip prospect. While McTavish could address an immediate need for the Canadiens, Anaheim’s high asking price ensures this deal, if it ever happens, will require serious consideration from both sides. Until then, the trade rumors are likely to remain a hot topic.Also Read: Rasmus Andersson breaks silence on Calgary Flames trade rumors, contract status, and offseason speculation","Anaheim ducks set high asking price for mason mctavish, targeting canadiens prospect david reinbacher.

From Kanata to downtown: Michael Andlauer ’s Ottawa Senators plan move to LeBreton Flats

Brady Tkachuk, Michael Andlauer and city leaders rally behind Ottawa Senators’ downtown arena vision

After seven long seasons without playoff hockey, the Ottawa Senators finally punched their ticket to the NHL postseason this year — and for captain Brady Tkachuk, it was a milestone that had been a long time coming. Since joining Ottawa, Tkachuk had played six full seasons without a single playoff appearance, while his brother Matthew lifted the Stanley Cup. This year changed that story. Under new ownership and first-year head coach Travis Green, the team not only broke its playoff drought but also took a major step toward changing its home ice. The Senators are set to move from their long-time suburban home in Kanata to a new downtown arena at LeBreton Flats, a shift fans believe will redefine both the team and the city.Earlier this week, the National Capital Commission (NCC) and Capital Sports Development Inc. (CSDI) approved the purchase and sale of 11 acres at LeBreton Flats to the Ottawa Senators . The team has played at the Canadian Tire Centre in Kanata since 1996, but the arena’s location — roughly 25 kilometers from downtown — has long been criticized.“It had to be done. Transportation to the Canadian Tire Center is abysmal. You build an arena in a good part of downtown Ottawa, and you’ll get fans,” one supporter wrote online.Another fan called the move “Great news for my hometown. Common sense prevails.”The new site sits beside the Ottawa River and within walking distance of Parliament Hill, addressing long-standing transportation complaints. Even fans who liked the Kanata arena see the change as positive. “I enjoyed being at that arena, but it was pretty far from everything else, and Ottawa has a beautiful downtown and shops to explore,” one hockey fan shared.In a statement on Monday, Senators President and CEO Cyril Leeder said, “We are pleased to reach an agreement of purchase and sale with the NCC to take the next step in this process. There are still many more hurdles to clear, and we look forward to working with the NCC and other stakeholders to achieve our shared vision.”NCC CEO Tobi Nussbaum echoed the excitement, noting the facility would “inject new energy and excitement into the core of the nation’s capital and further catalyze the development of LeBreton Flats” while also providing “a lively and convenient attraction for residents and visitors.”Fans agree. “This ownership group keeps hitting the mark,” one said after the team’s most successful season in seven years. Another added, “This is going to be such an improvement! It will take time, but so happy to see this progress!” TSN columnist Bruce Garrioch has reported it will take another five to six years before the Senators can take the ice in the new venue.The Ottawa Senators have pursued the LeBreton Flats project since 2019, but it stalled after a fallout between former owner Eugene Melnyk and business partner John Ruddy. Now, two years into Michael Andlauer’s ownership, the deal has grown from the original 5.8-acre site to 11 acres. Coming off their first playoff berth in seven years, Ottawa’s momentum is carrying from the ice to the city’s core — and fans are already imagining the roar of the crowd in their future downtown home.Also Read: Ilya Solovyov, Yan Kuznetsov, and Jeremie Poirier: Are these the next big names on the Calgary Flames’ blue line in 2025-26?",The ottawa senators are set to move from their long-time suburban home in kanata to a new downtown arena at lebreton flats.

His NBA career includes stints with the Nets, Sacramento Kings, and most recently, the Mavericks, as well as valuable development time in the G League.The Mavericks signed Edwards to a two-way contract for the 2024–25 season, but injuries to key players gave him extended minutes.

His versatility even saw him fill in as a small-ball center, a testament to his adaptability and defensive awareness.At 6’8”, Edwards fits the Denver Nuggets ’ defensive philosophy of switchable wings who can guard multiple positions.Denver values spacing for its offense, and Edwards’ three-point accuracy makes him a perfect complement to Nikola Jokic’s playmaking.Edwards joins on an Exhibit 10 training camp deal, giving him a chance to compete for Denver’s final roster spot without major financial commitment.The Nuggets have a track record of developing overlooked players into playoff contributors - names like Bruce Brown and Christian Braun prove it.

What This Means for the Lakers

Thehave emerged as a possible landing spot for, a key bench shooter from the 2024 championship roster, according to Zach Kram of ESPN.With Boston president and general manager Brad Stevens dismantling core parts of the team’s recent title-winning lineup to cut costs, multiple players - even role players like Hauser - could be available for trade. The Los Angeles Lakers, now featuring All-Star guard Luka Doncic , may see Hauser as a seamless fit given Doncic’s effectiveness alongside elite three-point shooters.Stevens’ roster shake-up has been swift and calculated, aimed at avoiding the league’s harsh luxury tax penalties - especially the repeater tax - in a transitional season without injured All-Star Jayson Tatum.• Kristaps Porzingis to Atlanta Hawks in a three-team deal with Brooklyn Nets• Boston received: Future second-round pick, Georges Niang• Later flipped Niang and two future second-rounders to Utah Jazz for rookie RJ Luis Jr. and an $8 million trade exception• Jrue Holiday to Portland Trail Blazers for Anfernee Simons• Simons brings scoring talent but questionable defensive fit• Waived point guard JD Davison, officially moving Boston below the second tax apronKram’s analysis points to Sam Hauser’s profile as exactly what the Los Angeles Lakers could use.Luka Doncic’s game thrives with reliable floor spacers, particularly those deadly from the corners.“The current supply of shooting in the NBA is so great that the skill set is generally available for cheap,” Kram said in his ESPN piece, noting players like Luke Kennard, Grayson Allen, and Hauser as attainable options. (H/t: Sporting News)The Los Angeles Lakers, already retooled with Doncic in the backcourt, may not need a high-usage scorer but could greatly benefit from a proven marksman who spaces the floor. Sam Hauser, who shot over 41% from deep in the regular season, fits that role perfectly and would likely come at a reasonable trade cost.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Los Angeles Lakers Reportedly Could Sign $121 Million Golden State Warriors Superstar; LeBron James Key Trade Asset?
