India T20Is vs New Zealand:

India T20 World Cup:

Chief selector Ajit Agarkar on Saturday announced India’s squads for the upcoming ICC T20 World Cup and the five-match T20I series against New Zealand. The T20I series will begin on January 21 in Nagpur and will serve as India’s final assignment in the format before the global tournament, scheduled from February 7 to March 8.India have been drawn in Group A for the T20 World Cup, alongside Namibia, the Netherlands, Pakistan, and the United States. The hosts will open their campaign against the USA on February 7 in Mumbai.Despite a lean run with the bat in the recently concluded T20I series against South Africa, which India won 3–1, Suryakumar Yadav has been entrusted with the captaincy for the marquee event. In 20 matches and 18 innings this year, Suryakumar has scored 213 runs at an average of 14.20, striking at just over 125, without registering a single half-century.Suryakumar Yadav (c), Abhishek Sharma, Sanju Samson (wk), Tilak Varma, Hardik Pandya, Shivam Dube, Axar Patel, Jasprit Bumrah, Rinku Singh, Harshit Rana, Arshdeep Singh, Kuldeep Yadav, Varun Chakaravarthy, Washington Sundar, Ishan KishanSuryakumar Yadav (c), Abhishek Sharma, Sanju Samson (wk), Tilak Varma, Hardik Pandya, Shivam Dube, Axar Patel, Jasprit Bumrah, Rinku Singh, Harshit Rana, Arshdeep Singh, Kuldeep Yadav, Varun Chakaravarthy, Washington Sundar, Ishan KishanIndia’s T20 World Cup squad sees some major changes. Notably, Shubman Gill , who was India’s vice-captain in the T20 setup, has been dropped, with all-rounder Axar Patel named as the new vice-captain.Gill had struggled to find form since opening the innings. Brought back into the playing XI as part of the management’s long-term leadership plan, his performances remained underwhelming. In 15 T20 matches since his comeback, Gill has scored 291 runs at an average of 24.25 and a strike rate of 137, failing to register a single fifty.Meanwhile, Sanju Samson, who had performed exceptionally well, including scoring three centuries as an opener, was moved down the order. His Asia Cup performance was mixed, though he finished as India’s third-highest run-scorer with 132 runs, behind Abhishek Sharma (314) and Tilak Varma (213). A solitary outing in Australia at No. 3 yielded little impact, after which Samson was dropped from the playing XI.In the last T20 against South Africa, Samson opened the innings again and scored a solid 37 off 22 balls, giving India a good start. The team management now plans to return to their original composition of playing a wicketkeeper at the top. Consequently, Jitesh Sharma has been dropped, and Ishan Kishan has been drafted as the second keeper.Ishan Kishan and Rinku Singh make the T20 World Cup squad, while Shubman Gill and Jitesh Sharma miss out. Kishan comes off a stellar domestic season in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, where he captained Jharkhand to their maiden T20 title. He finished the season as the highest run-scorer, amassing 517 runs in 10 games at an average of 57.44 and a strike rate of 197.","Ishan kishan and rinku singh make the t20 world cup squad, while shubman gill and jitesh sharma miss out.

Why the Mumbai Maidans are being ignored? | Bombay Sport Exchange

NEW DELHI: India all-rounder Hardik Pandya produced a blistering display of power-hitting to lead India to a commanding 30-run victory over South Africa in the fifth and final T20I in Ahmedabad on Friday, sealing the five-match series 3-1. Pandya’s explosive knock set the tone as India piled up a daunting 231 for 5.Pandya smashed a 16-ball half-century — the second-fastest by an Indian in T20 internationals — on his way to a stunning 63 off just 25 deliveries. His innings was laced with five boundaries and five towering sixes.The carnage was complemented by Tilak Varma, who continued his rich vein of form with a fluent 73. Together, the duo stitched a punishing 105-run partnership for the fourth wicket that completely wrested momentum away from the visitors.One of Pandya’s massive sixes led to an unexpected moment off the field when the ball struck a cameraman stationed near the boundary.Showing concern beyond the contest, Pandya immediately walked up to check on the cameraman’s well-being after his innings, ensuring he was attended to and even helping apply an ice pack.Pandya also hugged the cameraman, a gesture that quickly went viral and earned widespread praise from fans.In reply, South Africa began positively and remained in the chase as long as Quinton de Kock was at the crease. The left-hander scored a fighting 65, but once he was dismissed, the innings unravelled rapidly. Varun Chakravarthy spun a web around the middle order, claiming four wickets as South Africa lost seven wickets for 81 runs to finish on 201 for 8.Pandya’s all-round impact and match-defining innings earned him the Player of the Match award.""Winning games is what you play for and it’s always exciting when your contribution helps the team get over the line. No, I actually didn’t know (he has the second fastest fifty for India) until I got out and went back. Our social media guys told me I was the second-fastest,"" Pandya said.Watch the video here ""My first reaction was, “Ah, I missed the top spot!” But happy that Yuvi pa holds that record. Today I just felt it. I actually told my partner beforehand that I was going to step out first ball and try to hit it for six. I was confident it would come off,"" he said.""The situation suited my style; I backed myself and it worked. I took a calculated risk and thankfully it went my way. I’ve always enjoyed the challenge. No matter how many setbacks you face, the aim is to come back stronger, better, and make a bigger impact. When it all comes together, it feels satisfying.

Career night ends in frustration for Rams star

Sean McVay stands by Puka Nacua

Also Read:

Los Angeles Rams wide receiver Puka Nacua once again found himself at the center of controversy following Thursday night’s dramatic loss to the Seattle Seahawks, as frustration over officiating spilled onto social media before being quickly walked back.Despite producing the best game of his young NFL career, Nacua’s postgame reaction overshadowed what should have been a headline performance.Nacua was nearly unstoppable against Seattle, finishing with 12 receptions for 225 yards and two touchdowns. The second-year receiver repeatedly torched the Seahawks’ secondary and played a key role as the Rams built a commanding 16-point lead.However, Los Angeles watched that advantage disappear, eventually falling 38-37 in overtime. A late officiating decision that went against the Rams became a major talking point, drawing visible frustration from players on the sideline and fans watching at home.Shortly after the final whistle, Nacua took to X (formerly Twitter) and appeared to take a jab at NFL officials. “Can you say I was wrong,” he wrote, adding, “Appreciate you stripes for your contributions. Lol.”The post was deleted within minutes, but screenshots spread rapidly, ensuring the message reached a wide audience.The timing and wording were widely seen as a direct reference to a controversial late-game call that helped Seattle extend the contest and ultimately secure the win.When asked about the tweet after the game, Nacua acknowledged that emotions got the better of him. “It was just a lack of awareness and frustration after a tough, intense game,” he said.The wide receiver admitted that while players often feel inconsistencies in officiating, those thoughts should remain internal. “There are comments that I should definitely say in the locker room,” Nacua explained. “My job is to focus on my technique so there’s no issue with the call.”Rams head coach Sean McVay was initially unaware of the deleted post during his postgame press conference, declining to comment on something he had not yet seen. However, McVay has already publicly backed Nacua earlier in the week following separate controversy stemming from a livestream appearance.“I know this guy’s heart,” McVay said previously. “He’s a great kid who’s continuing to learn about the platform that he has. We’re going to put our arm around him and help him grow.”Public criticism of officiating has historically drawn fines from the league, and Nacua’s latest comments could again put him on the NFL’s radar. The situation comes at an awkward time, as the receiver had only just issued an apology earlier in the week for unrelated remarks.For the Rams, the priority remains correcting late-game execution after another painful loss. For Nacua, the message is becoming clearer: his elite on-field performances are undeniable, but staying out of controversy off the field will be just as important as the season progresses.","Los angeles rams wide receiver puka nacua took to twitter after thursday night's loss to the seattle seahawks.

John Mateer’s path to Oklahoma football, his faith, and the betting allegations

University of Oklahoma quarterback John Mateer has had a college football journey full of big moments, tough questions, and deep belief. At just 21 years old, he became one of the biggest names in Oklahoma football during his first season in Norman. Mateer helped the Sooners reach the College Football Playoff after a strong 10–2 season. Oklahoma also finished the year with four straight wins, showing clear growth when it mattered most. But John Mateer’s path was not smooth. Before he ever took a snap for Oklahoma, his name was linked to a viral sports betting claim. At the same time, Mateer has openly spoken about his faith and how prayer shaped his journey. From a transfer decision to public pressure, his story has drawn attention across college football.As Oklahoma prepared to face Alabama in the first round of the CFP, Mateer made one thing clear, he does not take any moment for granted.“This is everything I could ever ask for as a kid,” Mateer told reporters on Monday, December 15. “I prayed for this opportunity, worked for it, and I’m glad it’s here. I don’t take it for granted.”John Mateer was born in Little Elm, Texas, where football is a big part of life. While his parents were both swimmers, Mateer chose a different road.His father later became a swimming coach at the University of Texas, but football was always Mateer’s passion.“In Dallas, football is so big,” Mateer told Cougfan.com. “I played both football and baseball through high school and just didn’t have any interest in swimming.”John Mateer began his college career at Washington State Cougars. After redshirting in 2022, he played 11 games in 2023. In 2024, he won the starting job and had a breakout year, throwing for 3,139 yards and 29 touchdowns. That season changed everything.In December 2024, Mateer announced his transfer to the Oklahoma Sooners. Soon after, screenshots appeared online in August 2025 showing old Venmo payments labeled “sports gambling.” The claims spread fast.John Mateer responded on X with a clear statement.“The allegations that I once participated in sports gambling are false,” he wrote. “My previous Venmo descriptions did not accurately portray the transactions in question but were instead inside jokes between me and my friends. I have never bet on sports.”He added, “I understand the seriousness of the matter… I can assure my teammates, coaches, and officials at the NCAA that I have not engaged in any sports gambling.”John Mateer was not suspended and faced no punishment.Away from football, his faith remains central.

Patrick Mahomes’ injury, surgery, and the timeline Kansas City is now staring at

Randi Mahomes thanked supporters as Patrick Mahomes posted ‘why this had to happen’

Patrick Mahomes is already in rehab after a season-ending left knee injury, and his mom is making it clear she is reading every message that comes in. Randi Mahomes posted public thanks this week after the Kansas City Chiefs quarterback underwent surgery, telling supporters she and her family appreciate the prayers and the words of encouragement.The update lands at the worst possible moment for Kansas City. Mahomes tore his left ACL and LCL in Week 15 against the Los Angeles Chargers, and the loss pushed the Chiefs out of playoff contention for the first time in the Mahomes era.Athlon Sports reported Mahomes suffered the injury against the Chargers and later underwent surgery on Monday. The report said the procedure was performed by Dallas Cowboys head physician and orthopedic surgeon Dan Cooper. Kansas City placed Mahomes on injured reserve, and the quarterback has already begun rehab.The medical timeline matters because it shapes everything the Chiefs do next. Chiefs vice president of sports medicine and performance Rick Burkholder said the recovery expectation is nine months, though it could swing by a month or two in either direction, per USA Today. That puts Mahomes’ 2026 season availability at the center of every offseason decision, even if the team stays quiet publicly.ID@undefinedCaption not available.ID@undefinedCaption not available.ID@undefinedCaption not available.Mahomes’ injury also closes the book on a season where he still produced. Athlon Sports noted he recorded 22 passing touchdowns and five rushing scores in 2025 before the knee gave out. Now the conversation shifts from stats to survival: how Kansas City steadies itself without the player it has been built around, and how quickly Mahomes can get back to full strength.The Chiefs missing the playoffs is the loudest headline. Athlon Sports called the Chargers loss the final blow to Kansas City’s postseason hopes. It is also a rare swing in the Mahomes era. Andy Reid’s teams had been a January constant, and Athlon Sports noted Kansas City reached the Super Bowl five times in the last six seasons, winning three. That is the standard Mahomes and the Chiefs are judged by, and it is why this injury lands like a crisis instead of a routine rehab story.The emotional side of this hit the public right away. TMZ reported Mahomes posted a message on X after the injury report became public, and he did not try to dress it up.“Don’t know why this had to happen,” Mahomes wrote. “And not going to lie, it’s hurts. But all we can do now is Trust in God and attack every single day over and over again.” He also addressed the fan base directly in the same TMZ report.“Thank you, Chiefs kingdom, for always supporting me and for everyone who has reached out and sent prayers. I will be back stronger than ever.”TMZ noted Randi Mahomes shared his message with a heart and prayer emoji, and her own posts kept the focus on gratitude. Athlon Sports reported she wrote a public message while also sharing about her “Home for the Holidays” event for the Kansas City community.“Thank you all for the prayers and kind messages for Patrick. We truly appreciate every one of them,” she wrote.Athlon Sports also reported she added a second note on her Instagram Stories. “Thank you for lifting Patrick up in prayer. We’re so thankful for this community.”That is the cleanest read on the moment. The family is not selling false optimism. They are acknowledging reality, leaning on faith, and keeping the message tight: Mahomes has surgery behind him, rehab in front of him, and a fan base watching every step.For the Chiefs, the next part is not dramatic. It is practical. Mahomes’ rehab is the story now, and the rest of the roster gets judged by how it responds to life without him. The one piece of good news, per Athlon Sports, is that Mahomes is on track to return to full health when the 2026 NFL season comes around. The rest is patience, and nine months can feel like forever when you are Kansas City.Moreover, Travis Kelce addressed speculation about his future with Patrick Mahomes on Friday, Dec. 19, after reporters asked whether the two might no longer play together following Mahomes’ season-ending knee injury. The 36-year-old Kansas City Chiefs tight end called the idea hard to process, responding, “Oh man, that’s crazy,” before making it clear his focus remains on the team. Kelce acknowledged this is “a unique time” in his career but stressed that he is locked in on finishing the season strong, saying he wants the attention on winning games and supporting the locker room rather than discussing what comes next.What's interesting is that the Tennessee Titans host the Kansas City Chiefs on Dec. 21 at Nissan Stadium, still searching for their first home win in 413 days after last winning in Nashville on Nov. 3, 2024, against the New England Patriots. Tennessee faces a rare opportunity against a Chiefs team already eliminated from playoff contention and without Patrick Mahomes, who suffered ACL and LCL tears last week. Gardner Minshew is set to start at quarterback, leading most analysts to expect a close, low-scoring game with mixed predictions on whether the Titans can finally snap their home losing streak.",Randi mahomes thanks fans for their prayers as patrick mahomes begins rehab after season-ending knee surgery.

Maple Leafs fans on edge after reporter claims Auston Matthews trade talks may be closer than believed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/maple-leafs-fans-on-edge-after-reporter-claims-auston-matthews-trade-talks-may-be-closer-than-believed/articleshow/126059895.cms,"Auston Matthews trade rumor (Getty Images)

Auston Matthews and the pressure point Toronto cannot ignore

The mood around the Maple Leafs has shifted from confidence to caution. Toronto entered the season expecting its captain to set the pace, yet nights now pass where the scoreboard stays silent for stretches that feel unfamiliar. Auston Matthews still generates chances, still competes hard in all three zones, but goals no longer arrive with the same inevitability. In a market that measures greatness shift by shift, that absence has grown louder than any cheer.What makes this moment heavier is timing. Toronto is not rebuilding or experimenting. This is a team built to win now. When production stalls at the center of that plan, anxiety spreads quickly. Conversations that once felt unthinkable are now whispered openly, not because Matthews has fallen off, but because expectations around him remain sky high.The tension spiked when Maple Leafs reporter Howard Berger suggested the organization will not move forward until Auston Matthews asks for a trade, possibly by this year’s trade deadline. That idea alone rattled the fanbase. Matthews has been the franchise constant for nearly a decade.Imagining Toronto without him feels like pulling a load-bearing wall from the house.On the ice, the frustration has roots. Auston Matthews continues to win faceoffs, backcheck, and handle defensive responsibility. Yet Toronto pays him to swing games offensively. At five-on-five, his line has not consistently owned shifts. On the power play, the dominance that once felt automatic has faded into predictability. The looks are there, but the finish has gone missing.That gap between effort and outcome feeds scrutiny. In Toronto, leadership is judged through goals when the stakes rise. When scoring dries up, every shift becomes a test of authority and legacy. Nick Kypreos tried to strike a more hopeful tone in the Toronto Star, but optimism struggles to breathe when results lag behind reputation.The coaching staff has searched for answers. Different wingers, altered looks, and tactical tweaks have come and gone. The puck still moves well, but the instinctive scoring touch that defined Matthews has not returned with consistency. There is also quiet talk of tension with coach Craig Berube, another layer that complicates an already delicate situation.Trading a captain in his prime is not standard practice. Neither is standing still while doubt grows inside a contender. Toronto management now faces a narrow path where action and inaction both carry consequences. Whether Berger’s report proves prophetic or premature, it captures how fragile this stretch feels.Matthews remains elite. Yet in this market, elite alone no longer settles the noise. The next few months will decide more than standings. They will define how this era is remembered, and whether Auston Matthews and Toronto find clarity together or part under pressure.Also Read: Are Auston Matthews and Craig Berube drifting apart as Maple Leafs struggles spark tense locker-room speculation?","The mood around the maple leafs has shifted from confidence to caution.

Anthony Joshua vs Jake Paul fight night showed spectacle first, boxing second

Anthony Joshua did what most people expected him to do. He beat Jake Paul. Anything else would have been a disaster for his career. A two-time heavyweight world champion losing to a YouTuber was never an option. Still, the fight raised one big question. Why did it take so long?Many fans thought the fight would end in one round. Instead, it lasted until the sixth. That delay made people talk. Was it planned? Was it scripted to make Jake Paul look brave and tough? No clear answer exists. And it may never come.Anthony Joshua never said the fight was fixed. Paul denied nothing either. He fought on with a broken jaw and later said, “I had a blast. This is what boxing’s all about.” For many, that line felt hard to accept. A smaller man taking punishment from a heavyweight champion is not what boxing should be. Still, Paul survived. That alone surprised millions watching around the world on Netflix.The fight took place at the Kaseya Center in Miami, a 20,000-seat arena. Tickets were still available when fans arrived, but the crowd filled up by the main event. The buzz came less from boxing love and more from curiosity.Netflix was the real driver. With over 300 million subscribers worldwide, even a small share of viewers meant massive reach. This was entertainment first. Boxing came second.Anthony Joshua entered wearing a fashion-style battle outfit. Paul danced his way in with yellow sunglasses. The mood felt strange. More wonder than wild excitement. The American announcers tried to hype the crowd, shouting, “Make some noise,” but it took time.Inside the ring, Joshua started slow. Paul moved well and even seemed to win the first round with quick shots. Joshua picked it up in the second but held back his big right hand. Paul mixed movement with clinching. Anthony Joshua wrestled him down instead of finishing him. The referee warned him for that.The ring was bigger than usual. It looked designed to give Paul more space to move and avoid being trapped. That raised more eyebrows. Then things changed. Joshua stopped playing. He landed clean shots. Paul went down hard. The fight ended when Joshua finally let his power go.Afterward, Anthony Joshua looked ahead. He said, “If Tyson means it I’m ready,” hinting at a future fight with Tyson Fury. Big money talks are already happening, with Saudi backers ready to pay even more. As for Jake Paul, he promised more strange matchups. Just maybe not another one with someone as dangerous as Anthony Joshua.Also Read: Anthony Joshua Net Worth In 2025: Inside His Boxing Earnings, Career, And Payday Before Jake Paul Fight","Was anthony joshua vs jake paul fight scripted or real?

How Seth Jarvis’ injury could impact the Carolina Hurricanes’ season



Seth Jarvis’ injury has sent a push through the Carolina Hurricanes’ season at a time when consistency and scoring depth were all that mattered. The forward went down hard in overtime against the Florida Panthers at Amerant Bank Arena, and the result is worrying for the team as he is set to be “out for a while,” as per the head coach Rod Brind’Amour.The moment unfolded quickly and brutally. Twenty seconds into overtime, Jarvis drove hard to the net while being pressured by Evan Rodrigues and crashed full speed into the left post. He could not get back to his feet on his own, needed support to leave the ice, and disappeared. Brind’Amour did not sugarcoat it afterward, calling the injury “not good,” leaving Carolina fans concerned about a significant absence.Before the injury, Jarvis was not just another piece of the lineup. He was one of the Hurricanes’ most productive forwards this season, sitting second on the team with 29 points from 19 goals and 10 assists in just 34 games. He also delivered two assists in that very game, helping Carolina race to a 3-0 lead before Florida fought back, forced overtime, and eventually won 4-3 in a shootout. Losing a player producing at that level is a major competitive blow.Beyond current form, Jarvis has been a central part of Carolina’s offense in recent years.The 23-year-old star has already established himself as a well-renowned name in the NHL with 240 points under his belt and a pattern of upping his game come playoff time with 43 points in 55 postseason games. This particular skill of his makes the injury particularly troublesome with a Hurricane franchise still seeking consistency.With no fixed time frame on when he would return, Carolina finds himself dealing with lineups that will need some changes, new roles, and new players being called on to provide the same level of point production that Jarvis brings. His absence changes matchups, special-teams decisions, and overall offensive rhythm. For a team built on depth and structure, this is a real test. As the Hurricanes navigate the coming weeks, every update on Seth Jarvis will matter because his health could shape not only their immediate stretch of games but also the direction of their season.Also Read: Seth Jarvis injury update: Andrei Svechnikov’s high stick takes Hurricanes forward out with upper-body setback","Seth jarvis went down hard in overtime against the florida panthers.

Montreal Canadiens bring back Phillip Danault from Los Angeles Kings in major trade move,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/montreal-canadiens-bring-back-phillip-danault-from-los-angeles-kings-in-major-trade-move/articleshow/126093118.cms,"Phillip Danault reunites with Montreal Canadiens (Image via: Getty Images)

The Montreal Canadiens’ strategy in bringing back Phillip Danault from Los Angeles Kings



The Montreal Canadiens have reacquired center Phillip Danault from the Los Angeles Kings in exchange for a second-round pick in the 2026 NHL Draft. Danault, 32, returns to the team where he played from 2015 through 2021, bringing familiarity, experience, and stability to Montreal’s lineup as the team looks to improve midseason.Danault’s return is straightforward: the Canadiens wanted to get better. Known for his defensive reliability and versatility, he can contribute at both ends of the ice. With one year remaining on his $5.5 million contract, Danault adds depth down the middle while mentoring younger players in Montreal’s roster.Danault was originally a first-round pick by the Chicago Blackhawks in 2011 and has since played 741 NHL games, scoring 399 points, including 125 goals and 274 assists. In 62 playoff games, he scored 28 points, proving his ability to perform in high-pressure scenarios.From 2015 to 2021, Danault recorded 194 points in 360 games with the Canadiens. He has five assists in 30 games this season with the Kings, but he does more than just score. He can handle challenging matchups against elite opponents and is a good defensive player who excels on penalty kills.Adding Phillip Danault to the lineup is also expected to bring some stability to the team's scoring lineup because Danault has extensive experience with the system used by the team.Danault’s experience with the Canadiens goes beyond the stats as well. He knows the locker room, the culture of the team, as well as the ability to mentor some of the young players. This will go a long way in maintaining some sort of balance, something the Canadiens would need as they make a push for the playoffs.In general, the Canadiens are doing what is required of them at this stage; this is because the team is looking for a trusted and seasoned center who can play the opposition from start to finish. The return of Danault is expected to boost the depth, veteran leadership, and overall performance of the Canadiens ahead of the playoffs.Also Read: NHL trade rumors: Phillip Danault linked with potential move from LA Kings as Montreal Canadiens, New Jersey Devils and Carolina Hurricanes emerge as top contendors","The montreal canadiens have reacquired center phillip danault from the los angeles kings in exchange for a second-round pick in the 2026 nhl draft.

Broncos defense faces a major test, but Jones’ message sets the tone

The Denver Broncos’ Week 15 win felt like a very strong promise to see and envision a strong playoff push. However, the mood shifted once news broke that Brandon Jones would miss the rest of the season. The Denver Broncos safety suffered an unfortunate pectoral injury, which has now severely impacted what had been one of his most impactful years in the NFL Jones’ spirit and determination seem to be intact despite the injury, as seen in his new post on Instagram.

Locke is expected to take on a larger role, and while his numbers are modest, the coaching staff believes he can step up within the system.

Anthony Davis powers through illness as Dallas Mavericks prepare for tough road test against Philadelphia 76ers

Anthony Davis’ long-term future in Dallas faces fresh doubt as trade talk grows louder

The Dallas Mavericks, who have an uncomfortable 11-17 record and are ranked 11th in the West, will play the Philadelphia 76ers tonight. Throughout the season, the Mavs have appeared disconnected from success. Cooper Flagg, their newest recruit, had a difficult rookie season, and Anthony Davis, Luka Doncic's successor, is probably going to be replaced shortly.Despite being in challenging physical condition, Davis performed admirably in a victory against the Detroit Pistons last time out. Despite having a damaged left calf and an illness, the Mavericks big man continued to play a lot of minutes and had a great influence despite missing a recent game due to the ailment.On Saturday night, the Philadelphia 76ers (15-11) will play the Dallas Mavericks (11-17) in the second half of a back-to-back game. The upcoming 25th Anniversary Celebration Game, which is sponsored by Crypto.com and has a retro Hardwood Classic theme, will begin at Xfinity Mobile Arena at 7 p.m. ET.Without Anthony Davis, Dallas defeated the Detroit Pistons 116-114 in overtime on Thursday. With 23 points and 10 rebounds, top choice Cooper Flagg—who turns 19 on Sunday—recorded his fourth NBA double-double.The last time out, Davis made a valiant attempt against the Detroit Pistons. Despite nearly missing the game, Davis played a significant amount of time and finished with an outstanding 15 points, 18 rebounds, and 3 blocks in an overtime victory.In 37 minutes of action, he ended with 15 points, 18 rebounds, and 3 blocks to help the Mavs win 116-114 in overtime on Thursday. Davis stated after the game that although he is still feeling under the weather, he did his best to support his team's victory.“Still feel under the weather,” Davis said. “I actually threw up twice during the game, but I’m just trying to compete. I’m just trying to do whatever I can to help the team win. Just leaving it all on the floor.”The Mavs will now travel to Philadelphia on Saturday to play the 76ers. Despite his illness, Davis is listed as probable for the forthcoming game. This season, Davis has made 12 appearances and averaged 19.6 points, 10.8 rebounds, 3.1 assists, and 1.8 blocks per contest.It's possible that Anthony Davis' future in Dallas won't be as unclear as the Mavericks would like. Despite Dallas's public indications that an extension might still be in the works, ESPN's Tim MacMahon stated this week that he anticipates Davis being dealt.“The Mavericks are telling people, ‘Oh, we still might extend him this summer,’” MacMahon said. “If you do that, that’s not gonna be good business for the Mavericks. I’m being told that and I don’t believe that.“I’ll put it like that. I think it’s a matter of when and not if Anthony Davis is traded. I just don’t know when.”Davis may be the most likely trade departure since he gives the Bulls the most opportunity to recover choices, according to Sam Quinn of CBS Sports.“A trade seemed certain the moment Nico Harrison was fired. Now, there’s a bit of uncertainty. The Mavericks are playing well. Kyrie Irving could return. Could Harrison’s dream be fulfilled by his successors? That’s the question mark here,” Quinn wrote.In August, Davis will be eligible for a four-year deal worth a maximum of $275 million. In addition to earning $54.1 million this season and $58.5 million the following year, he has a $62.8 million player option for 2027–2028.Also read: NBA injury update: Dallas Mavericks guard Dante Exum ruled out for entire season after knee surgery","The dallas mavericks, who have an uncomfortable 11-17 record and are ranked 11th in the west, will play the philadelphia 76ers tonight.

What happened to Tee Higgins as the Cincinnati Bengals recorded a poor season?



Tee Higgins, the Cincinnati Bengals’ star player, has remained missing from the field ever since he sustained a brutal concussion against the Buffalo Bills for the second time in this season.While Tee Higgins’ injury had sparked panic among fans, there have been a few new developments as the Cincinnati Bengals gear up to face the Miami Dolphins on Sunday night.In the last few days, the Cincinnati Bengals’ star wide receiver has been a limited participant in the practice sessions.As per reports, Tee Higgins was recorded as a limited participant on Wednesday and Thursday.

Luka Doncic goes into Saturday night without a clear answer attached to his name. He is not listed as out or questionable for the Lakers’ December 20 game against the Clippers, which usually points toward availability. Still, the situation is not clean. The Lakers are short-handed, and Doncic has dealt with small interruptions this season that make any appearance worth monitoring.Since arriving in February 2025, Doncic has carried a heavy load. The Los AngelesLakers depend on him to organize the offense, control pace, and close games. With the roster thinned by injuries, his presence or absence matters more than usual.The Lakers and Clippers meet again at Crypto.com Arena, a matchup that rarely needs added context. Both teams are chasing position in the West, and games like this often matter later when tiebreakers surface.

Sebastian Coe’s words fuel belief in Britain’s next middle-distance star Ben Hoggins



Sebastian Coe: The Record-Breaking Legend Behind World Athletics #shorts

Some athletic records seem untouchable. Sebastian Coe ’s British 800-metre record of 1:41.73, set in 1981, is one of them. For almost 50 years, it has stood as the standard for every British middle-distance runner. Now, the conversation is shifting as new talent emerges and belief grows that the mark could finally fall.That belief has been backed by Coe himself. The World Athletics President has publicly praised the 23-year-old Olympian Ben Hoggins. His comments have added serious weight to growing expectations around British middle-distance running. With Scotland producing world champions and confidence rising across the squad, the moment feels right for a challenge to one of the sport’s greatest national records.Sebastian Coe has rarely spoken so openly about a young British runner. His praise for Hoggins reflects more than talent. It highlights mindset and belief. Speaking to Athletics Weekly, Coe said, “He’s very talented, and you need to win things and with that comes an infectious confidence.”He then compared Hoggins to Britain’s current stars and said, “I’ve seen that with Jake (Wightman) and Josh (Kerr) as well. You need to get up onto pole position ,and sometimes the rest of your career just follows.It’s a psychological breakthrough as much as anything.”Britain is currently enjoying a golden era in middle-distance running. Wightman ended a 38-year wait for a men’s 1500m world title in 2022. Kerr followed by winning the world championship a year later. Both victories echoed the dominance of Coe’s own era.While Hoggins looks to the future, another British runner has already come close to Coe’s record. At the 2025 World Championships in Tokyo, Max Burgin ran a personal best of 1:42.29. That time was just 0.56 seconds away from the legendary mark.The race was described by Coe as a “proper, proper 800m race.” It was fast from the opening lap. The pace helped push Burgin to a new level. After the race, Burgin said he now feels “comfortable at that low 1:42” and added that it “makes sense next year to be pushing to those 1:41s.”That performance showed the record is no longer safe. With Burgin closing in and Hoggins earning Coe’s trust, British athletics may finally be approaching a historic run.Also Read: Adam Peaty and Holly Ramsay escape to Lapland for holidays ahead of wedding amid family drama and swimmer’s mom's 60th birthday","Sebastian coe's british 800-metre record of 1:41.73 is no longer safe.
