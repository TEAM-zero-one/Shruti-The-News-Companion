""People Who Are..."" MEA Responds To Viral Mallya And Modi “Biggest Fugitive” Video

NEW DELHI: Reacting to a video that surfaced showing fugitives Lalit Modi and Vijay Mallya at a party in London, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) on Friday reiterated that India remains firmly committed to bringing back individuals wanted by law to face justice in the country.“We remain fully committed that people who are fugitive and are wanted by law in India, they return to the country.

But we remain committed to bring them back to the country so they can face trials before the court here,"" Jaiswal said.The MEA’s remarks come days after Lalit Modi shared a video on Instagram from Mallya’s 70th birthday celebrations, in which he referred to himself and his fellow fugitive as the “two biggest fugitives from India.”“Let me do something to break the internet again.

NEW DELHI: Extolling the valour of the Sahibzade (sons) of the tenth Sikh Guru, Guru Gobind Singh, PM Narendra Modi Friday said their supreme sacrifice represents the ultimate expression of India's indomitable courage, against the cruel Mughal Sultanate, shaking the very existence of religious fanaticism and terror.The PM said the saga of the 'Sahibzades' sacrifice should have been on the lips of every citizen, but unfortunately, even after independence, the mentality of slavery continued to dominate.

Draymond Green goes candid on Steve Kerr altercation calling it a “huge moment of growth”,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/draymond-green-goes-candid-on-steve-kerr-altercation-calling-it-a-huge-moment-of-growth/articleshow/126177971.cms,"Draymond Green with Golden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr (Image via: Getty Images)

How Draymond Green's stepping away from conflict marked a defining moment?



Draymond Green’s candid reflection highlights maturity as the Golden State Warriors focusses on legacy

Draymond Green has never shied away from expressing his emotions or his feelings, and that spark has long been part of what defines him as a distinct player of the Golden State Warriors. However, one altercation with head coach Steve Kerr became more than just a matter of intense talk inside the NBA. Speaking candidly, Draymond Green described the incident as a moment of self-growth, showing a sight of self-reflection from a player who is often known for speaking his heart out.According to Draymond Green, this whole situation taught him a big lesson, making him understand when to step away rather than escalating and intensifying an already intense situation. He went on to explain that he did not in any way want one thing to become two, explaining how quickly words spoken in anger could create further damage to the reputation of a player. By removing himself and choosing to stay quiet, Green felt that he protected not only the integrity of the team but also his years-long relationship with Kerr.For a veteran player like Draymond Green, his decision to remove himself from the entire situation is quite impactful.Because the Warriors have built their team as well as their legacy based on trust and values carried forward by Kerr as their head coach. Thus, for Green, understanding what words to choose in a crucial situation such as this, and understanding when emotions cross their lines, is very important, especially given his influence over his younger teammates, watching him, and learning how to respond under pressure.The incident also highlighted one important learning that no matter how professional one is on-court, it doesn't define their off-court impact and the weight they carry as a part of their career. Green also acknowledged that some words, “you can’t come back from tomorrow”, reflected his maturity and his presence of mind that he has gained through his years of experience in the big league. Rather than getting frustrated and gaining unnecessary public attention, he chose to remain silent, reflecting upon the importance of emotional control and self-esteem, which one needs to maintain as an athlete.At this stage, what matters most for Green is his evolution as a player, as his career demands him. The Warriors are no longer just running after winning games, but they are trying to create a legacy of their own. And Green’s self-reflection on an intense situation like this is proof that in a league as big as the NBA, it is important to maintain personality and growth not just on the court but also off it.By openly talking about the altercation, Draymond Green also sent a very powerful message that, rather than playing blame games, it is important for a player to focus on their own game and choose their words wisely. In a league where there is trash talk going on, almost on a regular basis, his words showed a sign of responsibility and strength. For the Golden State Warriors, this incident could be taken as a moment to build trust between players and the coach, turning an intense situation into a meaningful one.Also Read: ""It was actually amazing” – Warriors’ Draymond Green loved his 12-game suspension for heartfelt Christmas moment","Golden state warriors forward draymond green was involved in an altercation with head coach steve kerr.

Seattle’s toughest stretch reshaped the conversation around the team

For much of the 2025 NFL season, the Seattle Seahawks have lived outside the national spotlight. While fans and analysts spent weeks arguing over the Super Bowl credentials of the New England Patriots and Denver Broncos, Seattle kept stacking important wins. They have now earned the respect of none other than Tom Brady.Brady expressed his surprise at the team’s rise and performance, admitting that he is now a big fan. With an 18-16 win over the Colts and an incredible triumph of 38-37 against the Rams, the Seahawks are becoming the team that everyone is turning to as they continue to deliver consistent performances.The Seahawks’ early success was often brushed aside as predictable by critics and detractors, who insisted that the real test would come when faced with the elite teams. That moment arrived with the big wins against the Colts and the Rams. Head coach Mike Macdonald has emphasized trust and teamwork for the season as he addressed the media recently.He said, “It's who we are. It's what we do. You believe in who you are, and then you keep doing it and keep proving it, really to yourself and to our guys.” After the Rams win, Macdonald reinforced that mindset, stating, “They understand who they are, and when it's time to put it on the line, they're ready to go.”The rise of the Seahawks surprised many, even veteran Tom Brady, who was initially skeptical. As a FOX Sports analyst, Brady had previously kept Seattle just outside the top spot in his power rankings. They sat at No. 4 in week 14. This week, he has placed the team at No. 1, as stated, “I can admit I was a little slow to come around on this team.”He further added, “But they've proven their worth. The only question surrounding this team might be those uniforms. Are you feeling the Oregon vibes?” With two games left against the Panthers and 49ers, the Seahawks now shift from proving their worth to maintaining their consistency.Also read: Will Charles Cross play against the Los Angeles Rams tonight?

How the Celtics vs Pacers game may play out

, 2025, when the Boston Celtics visit the Indiana Pacers at Gainbridge Fieldhouse. He remains out as he continues to recover from right Achilles repair surgery and was officially listed as unavailable on the NBA injury report.This game was already shaping up to be uneven because of injuries on both sides. With Jayson Tatum still sidelined, Boston again enters without its top scorer and main offensive option. Indiana is dealing with similar problems, leaving both teams short-handed heading into a late-December matchup.Jayson Tatum injured his right Achilles during last season’s playoffs and had surgery on May 13, 2025. The original recovery timeline was eight to nine months, and there has been no indication that he is close to returning. There were no late updates or signs of a surprise appearance for this game.Without him, Boston leans on Jaylen Brown, Derrick White, and Payton Pritchard to carry most of the workload. The Celtics have managed stretches without Tatum before, but the offense is simpler and more predictable when he is not on the floor.Boston Celtics’ roster is further limited by several additional absences.Jordan Walsh is listed as probable and could play, but Boston’s main rotation remains thin.Indiana’s injury list is just as long, with several regular contributors unavailable.With Haliburton out, Indiana relies more on Pascal Siakam and Andrew Nembhard, but the team plays at a slower pace without its lead guard.Boston Celtics recently beat Indiana Pacers 103-95 while dealing with similar injuries, and this matchup looks like another low-scoring game shaped by depth and execution. Brown is expected to take on a larger scoring role, while Indiana looks to stay competitive through half-court offense.Also read: Boston Celtics vs Indiana Pacers regular season game: Full injury report, who's out, where to watch, and more (December 26, 2025) Tip-off is scheduled for 7:00 PM ET on NBA TV and local broadcasts.

Joel Embiid listed as doubtful as Philadelphia 76ers manage key injuries ahead of Bulls clash

Injury update ahead of Bulls game: Joel Embiid remains doubtful, while several Sixers are battling illness

After the Christmas break, the Philadelphia 76ers will play five games on the road starting on Friday against the Chicago Bulls. After losing to the Brooklyn Nets at home on Tuesday, the Sixers will be trying to climb back into the win column. According to the most recent injury report, Joel Embiid is expected to play if there are no problems during pregame warm-ups.Careful management has shaped Joel Embiid's 2025–26 campaign. Due to problems with both knees, he missed time earlier and has hardly ever played on consecutive nights. Last season, Embiid struggled with a knee issue that eventually necessitated in-season surgery. In less than a year, he underwent his second knee surgery. Due to injury, he missed the first two years of his NBA career and didn't play for the 76ers until the 2016–17 campaign.With the players' injuries largely resolved, the Philadelphia 76ers are getting ready for their regular-season game against the Chicago Bulls on December 26, 2025. According to the injury report, the Sixers will be without Trendon Watford (left adductor strain) and Kelly Oubre Jr. (left knee sprain).In an effort to get back on the floor, both players are still working through their customised exercises.Joel Embiid is doubtful against the Bulls due to his right knee ailment. He had a scare in the third quarter when he momentarily departed after grabbing at the knee, but he was still able to play against the Nets.His listing is related to regular knee care rather than a recent injury. That distinction is important. The Sixers have been transparent about Embiid's absences throughout the season. The squad did not hesitate to rule him out when his knees flared up earlier. The team feels he is healthy enough to be on the floor this time.When the 76ers lost to the Brooklyn Nets in their most recent game, Embiid was back in the starting lineup. In just over 31 minutes, he concluded that game with 27 points, six rebounds, four assists, and two blocked shots. He had missed two straight games before that one. Due to an injury scare, Embiid briefly left the Nets game.Embiid has only made 12 appearances overall for the 76ers this season. With splits of 43.5 percent from the field, 24.1 percent from the 3-point line, and 82 percent from the free-throw line, he has been averaging 21.0 points, 6.6 rebounds, 2.9 assists, and 1.3 blocked shots.Even though former MVP Joel Embiid has missed a lot of time this season, Tyrese Maxey and the Philadelphia 76ers have been among the NBA's more unexpected teams. The Chicago Bulls, who are 14-15 this season and on the periphery of the East play-in picture, will be the Sixers' slight road favourites on Friday.Due to illness, Dominick Barlow, Quentin Grimes, and VJ Edgecombe are all classified as questionable. They were all absent from the Nets' defeat on Tuesday. After winning four straight games, Chicago is now ranked No. 10 in the East, although it is still ranked 23rd in the league in net rating and 28th in opponent points per game.The Sixers, on the other hand, have recently made significant progress on defence, rising to the 11th spot in the league in defensive rating. On Friday, the Sixers and Bulls will tip off at the United Centre at 7:30 p.m. EST.Also read: NBA injury update: Will Luka Doncic suit up for Christmas Day as Los Angeles Lakers await big decision vs Houston Rockets?","Philadelphia 76ers face chicago bulls on friday night.

Frank Warren fuels talk of a blockbuster Tyson Fury fight



Tyson Fury’s comeback plans have taken a new turn after his promoter hinted at a huge fight announcement. Just weeks after confirming he plans to return to the ring, Fury is once again at the center of boxing speculation. The former two-time heavyweight champion had announced another retirement in January. That decision came shortly after his second straight loss to Oleksandr Usyk. Many believed that the chapter was closed for good.However, Fury has continued to tease fans with mixed signals over the past few months. Earlier this month, the 37-year-old made it clear that he sees unfinished business in boxing. His words suggested a renewed hunger and a desire to reclaim his place at the top.Tyson Fury recently broke his silence with an emotional message about returning to the ring. He said the journey back would be difficult and lonely but hinted that greatness and legacy awaited him at the end. His statement was widely seen as confirmation that another comeback is coming soon.Soon after, Frank Warren stirred excitement among fans. The Queensberry Promotions boss shared that a huge fight deal has already been agreed.He said an announcement would be made in the coming days or weeks and described the matchup as something special. His message instantly sparked debate across the boxing world.Many British fans are hoping the news involves a long-awaited clash between Fury and Anthony Joshua. Joshua recently added to the drama after his dominant win over Jake Paul in Miami. Speaking after the fight, AJ said he was ready for bigger challenges in 2026. He openly questioned Fury’s seriousness and challenged him to stop talking online and settle things in the ring. Joshua made it clear that if Fury truly believes he is the best, then a fight between them should finally happen.Despite the excitement, Warren poured some cold water on immediate plans. In an interview with The Sun, he explained that Fury fighting as early as February would be unrealistic. He noted that Joshua is expected to fight around that time, which complicates scheduling. Warren also said that if the fight happens at Wembley Stadium or in Riyadh, timing becomes even more difficult. Wembley, in particular, would likely mean waiting until summer.He added that Fury would not want to stay inactive for several more months after already being out of the ring for nearly a year. One thing Warren made very clear was that Fury’s return will not involve facing a YouTuber.For now, fans must wait. But with both Fury and Joshua speaking openly, the biggest fight in British boxing may finally be edging closer to reality.Also Read: Frank Warren names perfect time in place for Tyson Fury vs Anthony Joshua showdown",Frank warren fuels talk of a blockbuster tyson fury fight with anthony joshua.

Steelers maintain silence amid growing scrutiny

Also Read:

Veteran quarterback Aaron Rodgers has addressed the controversy surrounding DK Metcalf, as questions continue to mount following the Steelers star’s sideline altercation with a fan during Week 16 action.Metcalf was suspended for two games by the NFL after video surfaced showing him shoving a fan seated near the field during Pittsburgh’s win over the Detroit Lions. While Metcalf’s associates have alleged the fan used an offensive slur, the individual has publicly denied the accusation. After reviewing available evidence, the league chose to uphold the suspension, signaling that no mitigating circumstances were found.Rodgers, who had a close view of the incident from the field, offered measured remarks when asked about the situation. While stopping short of defending Metcalf’s actions, the veteran quarterback emphasized that player-fan interactions have grown increasingly volatile.“I don’t condone what happened,” Rodgers said. “But I think there’s a mindset that you buy a ticket and can say whatever you want. There should be some kind of code of conduct.”Rodgers also noted that players are subjected to more personal and aggressive remarks than ever before, particularly in high-stakes environments. He stressed that while accountability matters, context should not be ignored.Although the league discipline appears settled, the matter may not be over. According to Pro Football Talk’s Mike Florio, the fan involved is planning a press conference, a development that has fueled speculation about possible civil action.If legal proceedings follow, analysts warn that public statements made by players or team personnel could become relevant. While no lawsuit has been filed at this stage, the NFL’s decision to uphold Metcalf’s suspension may carry weight if the issue moves beyond league governance.The Pittsburgh Steelers haven't said much in public, which is in line with head coach Mike Tomlin's long-standing propensity for dealing with delicate issues behind closed doors. Since Metcalf won't be able to play for the rest of the regular season, it seems like the organization's major goal right now is to keep things stable throughout this important stretch of games.Rodgers' calm and thoughtful words show how hard it is for players to talk about difficult events, especially those that could lead to legal problems.For now, Metcalf will serve his suspension, but we don't know what will happen next. What happens off the field in the near future may be just as important as what happens on the field when it comes to whether the incident goes away or gets worse.The NFL is still trying to figure out how to deal with changing fan behavior and player safety, both physical and personal. The Metcalf case is a reminder that things that happen near the edge of the field can quickly become problems that go beyond the game itself.","Pittsburgh steelers quarterback aaron rodgers says he doesn't condone dk metcalf's actions.

Kendall Wesenberg looks forward to a tough comeback and final push for the 2026 Winter Olympics



Chasing an Olympic dream is difficult at any age. Doing it at 35, after a serious spinal injury, is even harder. Kendall Lorraine Wesenberg is proving it can still be done. The American skeleton racer, who competed at the 2018 Winter Olympics, spent nearly 600 days recovering from a major back problem. Many believed her career was over. Instead, she returned to competition and is now pushing for a spot at the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milan.Wesenberg recently spoke honestly about her long recovery journey. She shared how every step forward brought a tougher challenge. Making the World Cup team again was a major milestone. With Olympic qualification approaching, her focus is clear and unwavering.Kendall Wesenberg reflected on her recovery journey in a recent Instagram post.“Each time I’ve reached a milestone in this recovery, the next goal that follows has been an even more difficult one. And when I made our World Cup team in November, I was well aware that racing on the top tour would be the biggest challenge yet”, she wrote.Her return showed promise early. At the Fall Selection Races at Utah Olympic Park, she finished second overall in women’s skeleton. The following day, on November 1, she won the race with the fastest two-run combined time of 1:39.49.The result earned her a place on the 2025-26 World Cup circuit.However, the World Cup season brought new struggles. At Cortina d’Ampezzo, Wesenberg placed 23rd. In Lillehammer, she finished 27th individually, though Team USA won silver in the mixed team event. Looking back, she admitted the start was harder than expected.“Some errors on my part, some unlucky draws, and my push not being back in the way I hoped it would be have led to missing more cuts in half of a season than in the rest of my career combined. This has put me in a tough spot in terms of qualifying, but it’s not over until it’s over”, she added.Despite the setbacks, USA Bobsled & Skeleton named her to the official World Cup roster on November 1, 2025. Wesenberg now looks ahead to tracks she knows well. Winterberg, St. Moritz, and Altenberg are next on her schedule. She wrote, “My three best tracks on circuit this year are up next, and I plan on giving it everything I have in the final World Cup races of the season.”Team USA will announce its Olympic skeleton team on January 17.

“That guy, his skill set, he seems to have some crazy power that could translate to the higher weight classes.”

“It really comes down to technique, will power, and fighting spirit,”

“Ilia has those.”

Ilia Topuria is already making history in the UFC, and now a respected voice believes he could go even further.

How LaMelo Ball’s Availability Changes the Game

for the Charlotte Hornets’ game against the Orlando Magic on December 26, 2025. He has not been ruled in or out, leaving Charlotte without a firm answer as game time approaches.The Hornets have dealt with injuries all season, and Ball’s situation fits that pattern. He has played through ankle and wrist problems for months. While his name continues to appear on injury watchlists, the team has not given a final update. Anyone waiting to see him play will need to check the official report closer to tip-off.LaMelo Ball remains listed as uncertain. No new injury has been specified for this matchup, but his recent history includes left ankle soreness and wrist issues that have affected his availability throughout the season.Charlotte Hornets’ injury concerns extend beyond LaMelo Ball. Ryan Kalkbrenner is out with a left elbow sprain. Mason Plumlee will miss the game with a right groin strain. Grant Williams remains sidelined after right knee surgery. With several rotation players unavailable, Charlotte’s margin for error is thin.Orlando Magic also enters the game short-handed. Franz Wagner is out due to a left high ankle sprain, removing one of the Magic’s main scoring options.Jalen Suggs is listed as doubtful with a left hip contusion. Goga Bitadze is questionable because of a left knee strain.Even with those absences, Orlando has played well at home. The Magic are 10-4 at the Kia Center this season and have relied on defense and depth to stay steady when starters are missing.When LaMelo Ball plays, Charlotte’s offense looks different. In recent games when healthy, he has been around 23 points and nine assists per night, while also stretching the floor with his shooting. Without him, the Hornets have struggled to generate consistent offense.If Ball does not play, more responsibility will fall on Miles Bridges, who leads the team at 20.6 points per game. Orlando could take advantage of that by leaning on its defensive guards and home-court comfort. With Ball’s status unresolved, the shape of this game depends on a late decision.",Lamelo ball has not been ruled in or out for charlotte hornets vs orlando magic.

Gautam Gambhir's year as India coach ends like it started - on a chaotic note

As the year drew to a close, Indian cricket found itself sharing space with an unfamiliar kind of headline. Vaibhav Sooryavanshi, still three months short of his 15th birthday, was named a recipient of the Prime Minister’s National Award for Children, the Pradhan Mantri Rashtriya Bal Puraskar. It is the country’s highest civilian honour for achievers between the ages of five and 18. No cricketer had ever received it before. That alone set him apart. The fact that he now sits alongside names like chess stars R Praggnanandhaa and R Vaishali only underlined how extraordinary his rise has been.The award felt like a natural conclusion to a year in which Sooryavanshi did far more than chase records. He rewrote expectations of age, time and readiness. In 2025, no Indian cricketer was searched more on Google. Not Virat Kohli. Not Rohit Sharma. Instead, it was a schoolboy left-hander from Motihari, Bihar, whose name kept reappearing on screens across the country. What began as curiosity soon turned into understanding. This was not noise built on novelty. It was attention driven by performance.The defining moment arrived quietly, without television cameras or primetime build-up.In a Vijay Hazare Trophy match against Arunachal Pradesh, Sooryavanshi produced an innings that seemed to belong to another era. He smashed 190 off just 84 balls, striking at 226.19, with 16 fours and 15 sixes. That knock made him the youngest player in the history of List A cricket to score a century, breaking a 39-year-old world record previously held by Pakistan’s Zahoor Elahi.Yet this was no sudden eruption. Months earlier, on April 28 in Jaipur, Sooryavanshi had announced himself on the IPL stage with startling clarity. At 14 years and 32 days, he scored a breathtaking 101 off 38 balls against Gujarat Titans. It was fearless, explosive and unapologetic. Seven fours, eleven sixes, and a tally of maximums that equalled Murali Vijay’s IPL record. At 14, he also became the youngest player ever to score a T20 century.Even his final appearance of the IPL season felt scripted. Against Chennai Super Kings, he struck 57 off 33 balls to seal a Rajasthan victory. Broadcasters framed it as “Gen Bold vs Gen Gold”. By then, the identity of the poster boy was already clear.Records trailed him everywhere. He made his Ranji Trophy debut at 12 years and 284 days, becoming India’s youngest first-class cricketer. At just 13, he earned an IPL contract worth Rs 1.1 crore, the youngest player ever to be bought at an auction.His impact stretched beyond domestic cricket. Against Australia Under-19, he blasted 104 off 58 balls, the fastest Under-19 century by an Indian and the second-fastest worldwide. Across consecutive Under-19 Asia Cups, he remained central to India’s batting narrative. In 2025, he went even further, hammering an audacious 144 off 42 balls against UAE, an innings that included a 32-ball hundred.Indian cricket has known prodigies before. Very few, however, have shaped an entire year around themselves before finishing school. Vaibhav Sooryavanshi did exactly that.","Vaibhav sooryavanshi was named a recipient of the prime minister’s national award for children, the pradhan mantri rashtriya bal puraskar.

Gautam Gambhir's year as India coach ends like it started - on a chaotic note

On this day in 2020, December 27, Ajinkya Rahane played an innings that quietly altered the course of Indian Test cricket. It did not come wrapped in noise or bravado. It arrived in the aftermath of trauma. India had been bundled out for their lowest-ever total in the previous match - a humiliating 36 all out in Adelaide. Captain Virat Kohli had flown home on paternity leave. Mohammed Shami was ruled out of the tour. Umesh Yadav was injured. Confidence was fractured, belief questioned, and Australia sensed blood. What followed at the Melbourne Cricket Ground was not merely a response but a reclaiming of dignity, led by a stand-in captain who spoke with his bat.India began the second Test carrying the weight of collapse and expectation. When Day 2 started, they were 36 for 1 after Australia had been bowled out for 195, the echoes of Adelaide still loud. The morning was overcast, the ball moved, and Australia’s fast bowlers bowled disciplined lines.Australia struck early. Shubman Gill and Cheteshwar Pujara fell in quick succession, briefly threatening another collapse.Yet Rahane stood firm. From the very first delivery he faced, there was clarity in his intent. He drove straight when the ball was full, pulled with control when it was short, and trusted his defence when Australia searched for errors. A dropped catch on 78 off the second new ball proved decisive. Rahane marched on, making Australia pay for every missed chance.He stitched the innings together patiently. Partnerships with Hanuma Vihari, Rishabh Pant, and eventually Ravindra Jadeja rebuilt India’s hold on the match. Vihari and Pant showed promise before falling, but Jadeja became the perfect partner. Jadeja left well, chose his scoring areas carefully, and allowed Rahane to dictate the tempo. Their century stand for the sixth wicket broke Australia’s resistance. The bowlers tired, the new ball lost its threat, and frustration crept in. Even when Starc struck Rahane on the handle late in the day, fortune stayed with him as another chance was spilled. By stumps, India had surged to 277 for 5 and momentum had firmly shifted. Rahane’s century was not just technically sound; it was emotionally stabilising. It gave India belief when very little existed.Rahane’s stay ended on 112 off 223 balls the following morning, in unfortunate fashion — run out after a mix-up following Jadeja’s call. There was no visible frustration or anger. Instead, Rahane walked back and gently patted Jadeja on the shoulder, a quiet acknowledgement that such moments are part of the game. Only a week earlier in Adelaide, Rahane himself had been involved in Virat Kohli’s unfortunate run-out, a moment that triggered India’s dramatic collapse in the first innings. Perspective came easily to him. India eventually added a few more runs to be bowled out for 326, but by then the damage to Australia had already been done.Australia’s second innings only deepened the shift. India strangled their scoring, conceding almost nothing. Australia were bowled out for 200 in 103.1 overs, their slowest home Test innings in decades. They did not manage a single half-century. R Ashwin closed it out, Jasprit Bumrah provided the hostility, and Mohammed Siraj continued his remarkable rise. India were left chasing just 70.There were flickers of tension. Mayank Agarwal fell early. Pujara followed. Memories of 36 briefly hovered. But this was not the India from Adelaide. Shubman Gill batted with freedom, and fittingly, it was Rahane who struck the winning runs. India went from humiliation to dominance in the space of a week.That hundred at Melbourne did more than win a Test. It reset the tour. It restored belief. It laid the foundation for what would become one of India’s greatest Test series victories. Quietly, without theatre, Ajinkya Rahane played one of the most important innings in Indian cricket history.Rahane will forever remain an enigma in Indian cricket. Over the years, he played several outstanding overseas innings, often in some of the most difficult conditions imaginable. He remains one of the rare Indian batters whose Test average away from home is better than his record in India, a statistic that speaks volumes about his technique and temperament. Remarkably, India have never lost a Test match when Rahane scored a century, and under his captaincy, the team remains unbeaten in Test cricket.At the same time, his overall numbers never quite reflected the full extent of his ability. An average of 38.46 does not truly capture the quality of a batter who delivered when conditions were hostile and margins were fine. Rahane’s last few home series were particularly challenging, played on surfaces where batting was extremely difficult and excessive turn made run-scoring a constant struggle. These conditions did not affect him alone. The averages of Cheteshwar Pujara, Rahane, and Virat Kohli all took a hit during this phase, largely because India played on wickets where survival itself was an achievement.Rahane played his final Test in 2023 against the West Indies. He had earned a recall for the World Test Championship final earlier that year and responded by finishing as India’s highest run-scorer in the match, with scores of 89 and 46 in the two innings. That performance briefly suggested a late-career revival.However, the subsequent tour of the West Indies proved disappointing. India played two Tests, but the runs did not come. Soon after, he was dropped from the Test side. Since then, Rahane has remained out of the national team, and it appears highly unlikely that he will represent India in Test cricket again.His career, much like his personality, defied easy definition. Understated, resilient, and often underappreciated, Rahane leaves behind a legacy that stats alone cannot fully explain.","Gautam gambhir's year as india coach ends like it started - on a chaotic note. On this day in 2020, ajinkya rahane played an innings that quietly altered the course of indian test cricket. India had been bundled out for their lowest-ever total in the previous match - a humiliating 36 all out in adelaide.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126192805,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-894494,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

David Tomasek and Oilers expected to part ways with contract termination, here's why it makes sense for both sides



According to reports, the situation between the Edmonton Oilers and forward David Tomasek appears to be nearing a contract termination, a move that would likely open the door for the Czech winger to return to Sweden and continue his career in the SHL. The development has been described as a sensible outcome for both sides, addressing a roster fit that never fully clicked without forcing a complicated trade.From Edmonton’s perspective, this kind of resolution brings something valuable in today’s cap-tight environment: freedom to manoeuvre. It is expected that the Oilers would regain full contract value, offering a little extra space that can matter as the season stretches on. Depth decisions, injuries, and form swings are constant, and even small cap margins can influence how a contender manages its lineup.For Tomasek, the situation carries a different weight. At 29, he arrived in Edmonton looking to prove he belonged in the NHL after productive seasons with Farjestad BK from 2022 to 2024. It was expected that his experience could translate into a steady role on a competitive team. Instead, his time in Edmonton never truly settled into a rhythm.Reports indicate Tomasek featured in 22 games, producing three goals and five points while rotating between appearances and nights as a scratch. For players arriving later in their careers, consistent trust and opportunity can define whether an NHL stint sticks or fades, and that alignment never quite formed here.As the season developed, it gradually became clearer that the fit wasn’t ideal for either side. Edmonton needed roster versatility and specific role stability. Tomasek needed minutes, responsibility, and a genuine chance to showcase what he does best. A return to Sweden would give him that platform, in a league where he has previously thrived and remains valued.If the reporting holds, the outcome feels pragmatic rather than dramatic. The Oilers gain flexibility at an important time. Tomasek gets the chance to reset his career in a familiar environment. Both move forward, albeit with a quiet sense that the opportunity in Edmonton never truly had the time or conditions to grow.","David tomasek and oilers expected to part ways with contract termination.

Elliotte Friedman warns Maple Leafs could face “uncomfortable conversations” as inconsistency raises concerns,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/elliotte-friedman-warns-maple-leafs-could-face-uncomfortable-conversations-as-inconsistency-raises-concerns/articleshow/126190000.cms,"Elliotte Friedman warns Maple Leafs must act fast to fix inconsistency (Image via: Getty Images)

Maple Leafs face midseason challenge with consistency and leadership under pressure



Elliotte Friedman talks Connor McDavid, Kirill Kaprizov and more.

The Toronto Maple Leafs face a difficult few games beginning this week. The performance of this team has not been very consistent recently, and raises some questions as to how consistent they can remain going forward. The added importance of each game helps to make the ability for the Leafs to bounce back from poor performances over the next couple of weeks something everyone will be paying attention to.Sportsnet’s Elliotte Friedman was blunt ahead of the short break, warning that the Maple Leafs are headed towards a lot of very uncomfortable conversations if they don’t sort this out. His comment highlights the immediate need for the team to fix their inconsistencies and strengthen leadership on the ice and in the locker room.The team is now under greater scrutiny than ever with respect to leadership, performance and accountability. Outside of a few defensive breakdowns, inconsistent goaltending, poor special team, and a lack of consistency in their top forward lines; it has been evident that many areas of concern will need immediate attention by this team. In all likelihood, coaches will need to look at making changes in their tactical strategy, line combinations and roles for their players in order to create the balance and consistency that is needed to be a successful team.Very few of the top forwards have been able to find the chemistry that is needed to build a consistent top line, and many pairs of defense have had difficulties keeping the opposing teams to a minimum in scoring chances. Every game is magnified even more than before, thus forcing the management to make some difficult decisions behind the scenes in order to maintain or prevent a downfall from occurring.The execution of plays on the ice will be very critical. Players must focus all their efforts on playing to the best of their ability, while coaches should concentrate on the tactical adjustments made to apply them correctly during each play. Leadership from within the locker room will dictate how well the players hold each other accountable and continue to build the structure of the organization as they grow together.If not addressed quickly, the Maple Leafs could face a difficult stretch. How the team performs in the coming games will determine whether they can regain stability and build momentum for the rest of the season. Elliotte Friedman has emphasized team to act quickly to improve consistency and reinforce accountability among players if they hope to avoid a midseason slide.Also Read: Phillip Danault trade rumors: Elliotte Friedman weighs in on LA Kings center amid slow NHL season","Elliotte friedman warns maple leafs must act fast to fix inconsistency.
