The beloved pop star and the Kansas City Chiefs tight end walked hand-in-hand into the opening night of Tight End University in Nashville on June 23, 2025, and it was nothing short of a rom-com-worthy moment.Co-founded in 2021 by Kelce, alongside NFL peer George Kittle and sportscaster Greg Olsen, Tight End University serves as a three-day summer training camp focused on elevating the skill set of NFL tight ends. According to the event's official website, it’s a place where tight ends “bond, collaborate with, and learn amongst their peers while participating in a variety of activities including film study, on-field drills, recovery, rehabilitation, and more. ”But this year’s kickoff wasn’t just about football. The spotlight landed squarely on the couple as they made their first official red carpet entrance together.

Will the Utah Jazz trade Walker Kessler to the Los Angeles Lakers?



Why Los Angeles Lakers eyeing Walker Kessler to include in their roster?



The Los Angeles Lakers continue to show strong interest in acquiring Utah Jazz center Walker Kessler, according to recent reports. The team is reportedly willing to include multiple draft picks in a potential deal. It appears that they are serious about adding frontcourt depth. While talks have taken place, Utah has yet to accept any offer. So far, the situation is fluid as trade discussions continue. With LeBron James and Luka Doncic already headlining the roster, the Lakers appear focused on strengthening their interior defense ahead of the upcoming season.The Utah Jazz are heading into the 2025 NBA Draft with four picks and a roster full of young talent. After finishing with a league-worst 17 wins last season, the team is clearly in rebuild mode. Trade buzz has started to grow, especially around their frontcourt duo of Lauri Markkanen and Walker Kessler.Kessler, in particular, has drawn attention from playoff contenders like the Los Angeles Lakers. Despite the outside interest, Utah hasn’t shown much willingness to move the young center. However, Bleacher Report’s Dan Favale predicted the Jazz could “sell high” on Kessler before next season.""Freshly installed Utah Jazz president of basketball operations Austin Ainge is decidedly anti-tank. Dealing Walker Kessler would seem to run in opposition to that moral compass. Except not tanking in the Western Conference looks a lot like going about your business as usual. The Jazz aren't nearly close enough to contention for them to aggressively consolidate, and Kessler is someone more valuable to a team that needs a finishing touch rather than a cornerstone,"" Favale shared.Favale added, ""Extending the 23-year-old is absolutely on the table. Despite Utah's overall struggles, he has shown that he can act as the base of an interior defense, and his offensive utility may stretch beyond traditional big-man means if you buy into his 54 percent clip from floater range and three-point exploration. But this is all precisely why they may be able to get a tiny ransom for his services. Do the Los Angeles Lakers offer the Mark Williams Special (Dalton Knecht, 2031 first-round pick and a swap in 2030 and/or 2032)? Could the Jazz finagle another lottery pick from the Toronto Raptors (No. 9)? Or, along with other stuff, from the Chicago Bulls (No. 12)?""NBA insider Andy Larsen has recently shared that the Lakers have a strong interest in the $13,372,418 Power forward/ Center.Here’s why the Lakers could be interested in Kessler—- Walker Kessler may be more valuable to a contending team than to a rebuilding roster like Utah’s.- Extending Kessler is still a possibility, given his age (23) and defensive value.- Kessler has shown growth offensively, including shooting 54% from floater range and showing signs of three-point potential.Also Read: NBA Trade Rumors: Philadelphia 76ers reportedly exploring options to move $212 million star Paul George In the 2024-25 season, Kessler averaged 11.1 points per game, 12.2 rebounds, 1.7 assists, with a 66.3 field goal percentage.",The los angeles lakers continue to show strong interest in acquiring utah jazz center walker kessler.

Aaron Ekblad: Two-Time Stanley Cup Champion Talks Season, Free Agency, Parade, More

Why the lack of negotiation with Aaron Ekblad is raising alarm



What the Aaron Ekblad contract update means for the Florida Panthers



How does this surprising turn affect the Panthers' offseason plans



What comes next for Aaron Ekblad and the Florida Panthers



The Florida Panthers may be on the verge of losing one of their most reliable cornerstones. Aaron Ekblad, a crucial part of Florida’s 2025 Stanley Cup-winning squad, is reportedly leaning toward free agency. For most fans, this was the last thing they expected. Ekblad had stated his desire to remain with the Panthers long-term, giving many the impression that a deal would be easily reached.While names like Brad Marchand and Sam Bennett have dominated Florida’s offseason headlines, the silence surrounding Aaron Ekblad has become deafening. Reports suggest that there has been little to no negotiation between Ekblad and the Panthers all year. TSN’s Pierre LeBrun confirmed this sentiment, noting that he believes Ekblad is headed to the open market.It’s a puzzling development. Ekblad is only 29 and still one of the league’s top blue-liners, he has shown loyalty, consistency, and high-level performance on both ends of the ice, yet, unlike his teammates. There appears to be no concrete progress in keeping him, this sudden disconnect between player and team suggests something deeper.Whether it's cap flexibility, future planning, or a mutual shift in priorities.The Florida Panthers entered the summer with high expectations and several big names to lock down. Losing Aaron Ekblad would not only be a hit to the roster but also to the team’s identity. As a former No. 1 overall pick and a long-time leader, Ekblad has been synonymous with the Panthers’ rise in recent seasons.Chris Johnston’s revelation has reset the narrative. The idea of Ekblad staying on a hometown discount no longer feels guaranteed. With no formal offer known to be on the table and free agency fast approaching, Florida may soon have a massive void to fill. Ekblad’s next move could become one of the biggest headlines of this offseason.Also read: Don Cherry ends Grapevine Podcast and career at 91 with final “toodaloo” as legendary hockey broadcaster ends iconic run","The florida panthers may be on the verge of losing one of their most reliable cornerstones.

Gabrielle Union and Dwyane Wade have proved how strong their marriage is after the NBA legend went through cancer and a major surgery



Dwyane Wade’s wife, Gabrielle Union, has always maintained her separate identity even after being married to one of the most popular and talented players in the history of NBA.

Florida Panthers facing tough offseason decisions

Brad Marchand adds leadership and a winning formula



Brad Marchand made headlines during the Florida Panthers’ Stanley Cup parade, but not just for celebrating a championship. The 37-year-old veteran dropped a subtle yet revealing joke that could speak volumes about his plans for the future. While addressing the crowd, Marchand mentioned teammate Sam Bennett in a way that caught attention across the league.Given how effective both Marchand and Bennett were throughout the postseason, it’s easy to see why the Panthers would want to retain them. Marchand scored 10 goals and racked up 20 points in 23 playoff games, with six of those goals coming during the Stanley Cup Final. His role was critical to Florida’s back-to-back championships. Further solidifying his place as a perfect fit in their lineup.Despite the mutual desire between Brad Marchand and the Florida Panthers to continue their partnership. The reality of the NHL salary cap could complicate matters, both Marchand and Sam Bennett are unrestricted free agents, and re-signing them won’t come cheap. The Panthers are already tight on cap space, which means general manager Bill Zito must get creative.But in today’s cap-driven league, fit alone doesn’t guarantee a contract. As the free agency period approaches, Zito must weigh short-term success against long-term flexibility.Beyond his scoring ability, Brad Marchand brought something intangible. Yet invaluable to the Florida Panthers, a winning mentality, at 37, his presence in the locker room, leadership on the ice, and competitive fire gave the Panthers an edge that numbers alone don’t capture.His playoff performance proved that age has not slowed him down. With nearly a point per game and relentless energy in high-stakes situations, Marchand not only fit the Panthers' system, but he elevated it. That level of impact is hard to replace, especially for a team with legitimate championship ambitions.Whether or not both Marchand and Sam Bennett return next season, their connection and Marchand’s parade joke will be remembered as more than just humor. It was a glimpse into a veteran’s commitment to a team that may have become his new home.Also Read: NHL trade news: New York Rangers confirm they are trading 2025 12th overall pick to Pittsburgh Penguins",Brad marchand made headlines during the florida panthers' stanley cup parade.

Poll What do you think was the biggest factor in Prithvi Shaw's decline? Poor choices and distractions Lack of discipline and fitness Loss of passion for cricket

India Outplayed at Headingley | England Go 1-0 Up in the Series | IND vs ENG 1st Test

NEW DELHI: Once touted as the next big thing in Indian cricket Prithvi Shaw has made a frank and emotional admission about the struggles that have derailed his once-promising career.In a recent interview, the 25-year-old revealed how poor choices, distractions, and a shift in priorities led to his decline, both on and off the field.“There are a lot of things. It is different for people to see. Because I know what has happened. I can understand it. I have taken a lot of wrong decisions in life. I started giving less time to cricket. I used to practice a lot. For example, I used to bat for 3-4 hours in nets. I never got tired of batting. I used to go to the ground for half a day. I admit that there was a distraction,” Shaw told News24.“After that, I started considering what was not necessary as necessary. I made some wrong friends. Because I was at the top at that time. Friendship is also formed. Then they took me here and there. All those things. Then I got away from the track. I used to give 8 hours of practice on the ground. Now it is 4 hours.""Shaw, who made a dream Test debut in 2018 with a century against the West Indies, quickly rose to fame, even drawing comparisons with the likes of Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag.But over time, lapses in disc ipl ine and fitness saw him fall out of favour.From being dropped by Mumbai for poor fitness to going unsold in the IPL 2025 auction, the downturn was steep and public.Now, the right-handed opener is looking to reset.Shaw has officially parted ways with the Mumbai Cricket Association, seeking a fresh start with Maharashtra as a professional player.In his letter to the MCA, Shaw expressed gratitude for their support but said he believes a move is necessary for his growth.While he made brief comebacks, including a stint in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, consistent performances remained elusive.With a new state team, a renewed mindset, and honesty about his past missteps, Prithvi Shaw is aiming to turn the page.Whether this marks the beginning of a redemption arc or a slow fade from top-tier cricket remains to be seen; but for now, he’s choosing the hard road back.","Prithvi shaw has made a frank and emotional admission about the struggles that have derailed his once-promising career.

The NBA draft is about to start. All team owners have their eyes on the prospects. They chase the game-changers, the players with character in their performance. Also, they want the best pick at a reasonable price. In the current set of prospects, Cooper Flagg is ruling the popularity chart. He is being deemed safest by the game experts. He has a few more companions on the safest draft picks’ list.Let’s find out who they are and why they are considered draft picks with a high floor.The buzz around Cooper Flagg being the safest draft pick has been the most prominent this year. And why would it not be? Cooper brings to the table a rare combination of high floor and high ceiling. It means a safe player with excellent tools at hand.Duke Blue Devils freshman turned heads with his stellar performance. He made the mark with 19.2ppg on average. His phenomenal court dominance earned him the recognition of National Player of the Year, too.Since April 2025, when he declared himself for the draft, Cooper has been a topic on all platforms where basketball is discussed.Kon Knueppel serves as a safe option owing to his ability to score from all three levels - deep, midrange, and rim.His elite shooting and exceptional basketball IQ make him an error-proof player.Standing at approx. 6”7”, he makes a suitable choice for the third and fourth positions. His ability to step in and perform whenever needed complements the NBA environment perfectly.A staggering 91.4% success in the free-throw line as a Duke Blue Devils pivot earned him praises from Copper Flagg, too. For his positional size and mechanics, scouts placed him high among the safest draft picks of 2025.Bursting with energy and supported by strong athleticism, Carter Bryant makes the good books of league owners. When it comes to a safe draft pick, he makes a unique choice because of a lack of star power, but a lot of promise.Bryant is considered a high-floor player because of his versatile play. He can fit into any of the positions like a glove and make an impact.Though Bryant shows scope for improvement in scoring ability, his versatile defense fills the gap. Compared to OG Anunoby, Patrick Williams, and Trey Murphy III by the analysts, the player aptly fits the role of 3-and-D-wing (3-pointer and defense).V J Edgecombe checks most of the boxes as a safe draft pick. His strength lies in being the elite perimeter defender. Noticeable performance statistics, such as 3.8% steal rate and 2.3% block rate, make him a solid case for one of the safest draft picks.According to NBA Draft Scouting Reports & Analysis’s records, his excellent leaping helped him score 33 dunks in his freshman season. Defense is the trump card of Edgecombe, where he excels with good anticipation and disruptive turnovers.The Baylor freshman has decent numbers to support his reputation as a safe draft pick. He scored a 50.4% effective FG rate, which is comparable to several long-term NBA players. Edgecombe got the selector’s attention with his 30-point performance against Kansas State.With virtues like consistency, athleticism, and strong defense, Edgecombe justifies being one of the safest 2025 draft picks.Ryan Kalkbrenner emerged as one of the top finishers and defenders in the NCAA Division 1. His growing reputation as an experienced college basketball upperclassman made him a safe pick for the 2025 draft.Having five years of experience in college basketball, he has outgrown the status of an untested freshman. His experience brought the surety that scouts needed in a draft pick.The four-time Big East Defensive Player of the Year has physical attributes that make him an elite choice for defensive roles on the team. An exemplary wingspan of 7’6″ and 9’4″ reach provides him the impetus needed for foul-less defense.Also Read: “I’m not worried” - Cooper Flagg gives his honest thoughts on succeeding Luka Doncic in Dallas Mavericks roster The 2025 NBA Draft picks’ list indeed demonstrates immense potential.

Poll Do you believe Rishabh Pant is revolutionizing Test cricket with his batting style? Yes No, not really

Former India coach and Australia cricketer Greg Chappell has heaped praise on Rishabh Pant after the wicketkeeper-batter’s record-setting twin hundreds at Headingley, calling him a game-changer and comparing his impact to that of Australian great Adam Gilchrist.Pant, now India’s Test vice-captain, became only the second wicketkeeper-batter in history after Zimbabwe’s Andy Flower to score a century in each innings of a Test match. His explosive batting was one of the standout performances in the series opener at Headingley, even though India fell by five wickets to the hosts on Day 5.“The beauty of it (Pant’s batting) is that he gets his runs at a very fast rate, which gives you time to win cricket matches. It was a phenomenal performance; some of the shots that he played probably weren’t in the MCC coaching manual when I last looked at it,"" Chappell said at an event in Mumbai.Chappell believes Pant is revolutionising Test batting with a fearless approach that makes the best use of modern bats and the 27-year-old's vey own natural flair.“He is reinventing the game as a batter. You know, modern technology, the bats are very different.You can play shots that weren’t possible with the old bats. But man, he’s exciting to watch,” he added.Pant’s ability to keep bowlers guessing also impressed Chappell. “You never quite know what to expect from the first ball at any stage. He’s likely to jump down the wicket to the pacers, or he’ll play the falling ramp shot. You never quite know what to expect, so it keeps the opposition on their toes,” he explained.Recalling his early impressions of the left-hander, Chappell said, “When I first saw him, he was a different sort of player, of course, but he reminded me very much of Adam Gilchrist.”Pant’s twin hundreds also saw him rise to a career-best seventh in the ICC Test rankings for batters. India will look to make the best use of his explosive form in the second Test set to commence on July 2. A win would bring the visitors level in the series.",Former india coach greg chappell has heaped praise on rishabh pant. The wicketkeeper-batter scored twin centuries against england at headingley.
