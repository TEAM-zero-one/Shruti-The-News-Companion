Wayne Gretzky's attendance sparks unrelated controversy



Alex Ovechkin Breaks Gretzky's Record for Most Goals in NHL History 🚨

Wayne Gretzky faces backlash over Kash Patel appearance



Alex Ovechkin etched his name into NHL history, scoring his 895th goal to surpass Wayne Gretzky ’s all-time record. But what should’ve been a celebration of hockey greatness took an unexpected turn. The spotlight drifted from the ice to the stands, specifically to Gretzky’s guest, Kash Patel . The former government official’s appearance sparked a wave of political chatter, clouding what was meant to be a milestone moment in the sport.Here’s what happened: Gretzky, invited to witness Ovechkin’s history-making night, was spotted at recent Capitals games alongside Patel, a former U.S. government official with Republican ties. That detail, insignificant to some, became headline fodder across social media.Suddenly, instead of reflecting on the end of one era and the start of another, online chatter shifted to whether Gretzky’s presence next to Patel carried political weight. Some fans, particularly from Canada, voiced disappointment, questioning Gretzky’s silence on past political issues and reading into his choice of company.Frank Seravalli, a respected NHL insider, thought so. He was quick to dismiss the controversy, reminding fans that Patel isn’t some outsider looking for a photo op—he’s a longtime hockey guy with actual time on the ice. According to Seravalli, dragging Gretzky into a political debate during a celebratory hockey moment is a misfire.Let’s not forget what actually happened on the ice. Ovechkin scored a power-play goal in the second period against the Islanders, a goal that not only broke Gretzky’s record but redefined the ceiling for future scorers.Gretzky handled the moment with quiet grace. He didn’t make it about himself. He didn’t push a narrative. He showed up, clapped, and passed the torch with a short message that was more personal than political. “I know how hard it is to get to 895,” he said, reflecting on his own kids being close in age to Ovechkin’s when he set the record.Also Read: Alex Ovechkin’s record ignites nostalgia as Penguins’ Mike Sullivan remembers legends who built NHL It was hockey history in real time.

Internet swoons as Brittany Mahomes posts sweet moment of Bronze saying his real name at age two



Brittany and Patrick Mahomes are giving fans another heartwarming glimpse into their growing family, this time with a rare and adorable appearance by their 2-year-old son, Bronze. The Kansas City Chiefs quarterback and his wife, Brittany, are never shy about sharing special moments with their children, but this recent video truly struck a chord with fans.On April 8, Brittany Mahomes took to Instagram Stories to post a touching clip of her and Bronze enjoying some outdoor time. In the video, Brittany gently asks her toddler, “What’s your name?” With a shy grin, he replies, “Bronzie.” When prompted about his real name, the little boy proudly responds, “Patrick Mahomes Three,” holding up three tiny fingers. A glowing Brittany smiles and responds with, “Nice job.”Though the couple often refers to their son by his nickname, Bronze, his full name—Patrick Lavon Mahomes III—is a meaningful tribute to his father. Patrick Mahomes has long envisioned passing down his name, once sharing, “I've thought about that since I was really like five, six years old.” The nickname “Bronze” not only creates a unique identity for their son but also keeps with a fun family tradition. Their two dogs are named Steel and Silver, and their daughters, Sterling Skye and Golden Raye, also have metallic-inspired names.The sweet exchange between Brittany and Bronze wasn’t just confined to her Instagram. Patrick also reshared the video, accompanied by three “A-OK” emojis, proudly acknowledging the moment. It’s clear that this family cherishes every milestone, no matter how small.During a January appearance on The Kelly Clarkson Show, Brittany joked about using Bronze’s formal name, saying, “I have to say his real name or his dad will get mad,” further confirming just how personal the name is for Patrick. It’s evident the couple puts thought and meaning into every aspect of their children’s lives.The Mahomes family has had an eventful start to 2025, recently welcoming their third child, Golden Raye, just weeks before Patrick competed in his fifth Super Bowl. Despite the Chiefs’ tough loss to the Eagles, Patrick’s message to fans was one of humility and determination. “I let ya’ll down today… I’ll always continue to work and try and learn and be better for it.”Through all the highs and lows—on and off the field—Brittany and Patrick Mahomes remain grounded in family. Their latest video with Bronze not only showcases a touching parenting moment but also reminds fans of the values that truly matter to them: love, legacy, and connection.Also Read: Rookie QB Caleb Williams already feeling the pressure from Ben Johnson’s coaching style","Brittany and patrick mahomes' 2-year-old son, bronze, says his real name.

Steelers’ pursuit of Aaron Rodgers faces mystery roadblock as new doubts surface



Could Aaron Rodgers make Steelers decision at Pat McAfee event? | Pro Football Talk | NFL on NBC

Aaron Rodgers remains the centerpiece of the Pittsburgh Steelers ' offseason headlines, but the veteran quarterback has yet to offer any clarity about his next move. Many anticipated that his long-awaited decision might be revealed during Pat McAfee's highly anticipated 'Big Night Aht' at PPG Paints Arena, but that moment came and went without any announcement. As of now, the Steelers are still in suspense — and that may remain the case until after the 2025 NFL Draft.The uncertainty surrounding Aaron Rodgers’ potential arrival in Pittsburgh is now believed to be more strategic than financial. In a recent interview with 93.7 The Fan, Pro Football Talk's Mike Florio addressed the core of the delay, stating, “I think that’s the bigger issue,” when asked about the Steelers' draft plans potentially affecting Rodgers’ decision. Florio further added, ""And it goes more like this: what if we determine halfway through the season that this just isn’t a year for the Steelers to do anything significant? OK, let’s find out what the young guy has... So I think you introduce a potential awkwardness. I don’t think he wants to go into a situation where there’s going to be a chance.""This echoes a scenario that played out recently with another veteran quarterback — Kirk Cousins. The Atlanta Falcons handed Cousins a $180 million contract, only to draft Michael Penix Jr. with the eighth overall pick the very same offseason. That move left Cousins as a highly paid backup while Penix took the spotlight as the team’s future. Rodgers, known for being deliberate and cautious about his decisions, appears unwilling to walk into a similar situation.Pittsburgh has been actively scouting quarterback prospects, including Colorado’s Shedeur Sanders and Ole Miss’s Jaxson Dart during recent pre-draft visits. This signals that the team is eyeing long-term solutions at quarterback — and might be ready to draft one in the first round.Still, the Steelers' interest in drafting a quarterback doesn't necessarily signal a lack of desire for Rodgers. In fact, the organization envisions a mentorship dynamic where a young quarterback can develop under Rodgers’ guidance. It’s a model that could serve Pittsburgh both in the present and in the future.For now, the Steelers — and the NFL world — continue to wait. Whether Aaron Rodgers dons black and gold or chooses another path, his next chapter remains one of the most intriguing storylines heading into the draft and beyond.Also Read: Steelers fans hoping for Aaron Rodgers news just got a reality check from Pat McAfee","Aaron rodgers remains the centerpiece of the pittsburgh steelers'offseason headlines.

A goal for the ages: Alex Ovechkin breaks Wayne Gretzky's 26-year record



FULL Alex Ovechkin Celebration Ceremony After Record-Breaking Goal No. 895

A legacy passed down: Anastasia Shubskaya receives diamond tribute from Janet Gretzky



After Alex Ovechkin netted his 895th career goal and broke legendary Wayne Gretzky 's record, Janet Gretzky showed respect to a time-honored hockey tradition by gifting Anastasia Shubskaya , wife of Alex Ovechkin, an eight-carat diamond ring that had been estimated at $280,000. The Capitals may have lost to the New York Islanders by a score of 4-1, but the outcome was an afterthought to a night all about legacy, love, and a new chapter in hockey's history.The moment of history arrived at 7:26 of the second period. Alex Ovechkin let go of a blazing shot through fellow Russian Ilya Sorokin, making himself the NHL's all-time leading goal scorer. Fans inside UBS Arena lost their minds, and Alex Ovechkin commemorated the occasion by executing a belly flop onto the ice—celebrating his big achievement.While Alex Ovechkin was absorbing the enormity of his achievement, Anastasia Shubskaya was gifted a symbolic token of the historic night. Continuing a tradition started in 1994, when Colleen Howe (wife of Gordie Howe) gave Janet Gretzky a diamond ring after her husband, Wayne Gretzky, broke Colleen Howe’s husband’s record, Janet Gretzky ensured history repeated itself—this time from one hockey family to another.In an interview with the media, Wayne Gretzky said, “A month ago, my wife said, ‘You know, Colleen Howe started a tradition. I’m not sure if anyone is going to break Alex’s record, but I want to give her (Ovechkin’s wife, Anastasia Shubskaya) something really unique.’ So, we went out and she picked out an eight-diamond ring for Alex’s wife. Not only do hockey guys pass down traditions. So do the families and wives.”The act not only spanned generations of greatness but also underlined the strong relationship between hockey families across generations.Anastasia Shubskaya, who tied the knot with Alex Ovechkin in 2016, is a Russian model who has appeared in numerous Russian magazines during her career and has built a strong social media presence. They are proud parents of two sons- Sergei and Ilya.Also read: “Now the real stuff is coming”: Alex Ovechkin skips The Tonight Show appearance to stay playoff-ready Even though the Capitals fell on the evening, the larger context is one of hope.

With the NHL playoffs coming, Alex Ovechkin and the Washington Capitals aim to ride the wave of history toward what would be a fairy tale conclusion to the 2025 campaign.","Anastasia shubskaya, wife of alex ovechkin, was gifted an eight-carat diamond ring that had been estimated at $280,000.

Ed Sheeran recalls inseparable bond with Taylor Swift during the Red tour

Ed Sheeran: You Either Love Me or Hate Me (Full Episode)

Singer-songwriter Ed Sheeran has opened up about his long-standing friendship with Taylor Swift — and his nostalgic reflections have stirred up more than a few whispers among fans. While speaking on the Call Her Daddy podcast , Sheeran shared intimate memories of their time touring together, describing their past bond as nearly inseparable. With Taylor now in a high-profile relationship with NFL star Travis Kelce, the timing and tone of Sheeran's comments have sparked chatter on social media.Looking back on his early days of touring with Taylor Swift, Ed Sheeran painted a vivid picture of closeness. “I literally spent almost every single day with her for about six months,” he said, referring to the time he spent as the opening act on Swift’s Red tour. “I lived in Nashville, and she lived in Nashville, and we used to fly to and from the gigs together.”That period, according to Sheeran, left a lasting impact on him. He admitted to revisiting old text messages and voice notes from that time, describing a sense of deep nostalgia. “I think that period of time, I do, you know, I see her when I see her,” he said, adding that while they’re not as constantly in touch now, the bond is still intact.Even with their hectic careers, Sheeran noted that he and Swift make time for meaningful catch-ups. “I probably see her like four times a year and we do what I said, like proper sit-down, six-hour catch-ups,” he revealed. The two recently reunited during Swift’s Eras Tour at Wembley Stadium in August 2024, where they performed their hit Everything Has Changed — a nostalgic nod to their earlier collaboration on the Red album.While there’s no evidence of tension between Sheeran and Kelce, some fans have raised eyebrows over the emotional tone of Sheeran’s memories. With his emphasis on the “inseparable” connection they once shared, speculation has naturally followed about how Kelce might feel about the close bond. Regardless of public perception, both Swift and Sheeran have built a friendship that spans over a decade — one that continues to thrive even as their lives evolve.Also Read: “Spent almost every single day with her”: Ed Sheeran shares insight into his 10-year friendship with Travis Kelce's beau Taylor Swift While neither Swift nor Kelce has publicly addressed the buzz surrounding Sheeran’s comments, the timing couldn’t be more sensitive.

The resurfacing of Taylor’s close ties with Ed — especially framed in such heartfelt terms — has only intensified fan speculation. Still, insiders insist that Swift and Kelce are secure in their relationship and that Sheeran’s remarks are simply a reflection of genuine friendship, not romantic undertones.","Singer-songwriter ed sheeran has opened up about his long-standing friendship with taylor swift.

Kanye West unleashes explosive social media rant targeting targets Taylor Swift

Kanye West sparked a fresh wave of controversy late Wednesday night after posting over 100 messages on X (formerly Twitter), touching on everything from his strained relationships with fellow celebrities to personal stories about his past. The posts, raw and often explicit, once again placed the rap mogul at the center of a media storm.Among the most notable moments from the barrage of posts was Kanye West’s unexpected apology directed toward longtime friend and collaborator JAY-Z. West addressed a past tweet in which he insulted the rapper’s children, saying: “I’m sorry JAY-Z. I be feeling bad about my tweet but I still feel I gave my life to this industry and thought so many people were my family but when I needed my family on some real shit none of these rap n-ggas had my back.”The apology, however, did little to temper the more controversial elements of the rant. One of the most shocking claims involved pop superstar Taylor Swift. West, who has a well-documented and tumultuous history with Swift dating back to the 2009 MTV VMAs, alleged that the singer was involved in a threesome with Justin Bieber and Harry Styles.He wrote: “Justin Bieber and Harry Styles f**ked Taylor Swift from both sides and didn’t call me… ON EVERYTHIIING THIS TWEET IS ONE THOUSAND PERCENT TRUE.” Swift has not responded to the comments, which have already sparked heated debates on social media.West also made sensational claims about his own romantic past, stating that he had relationships with Ashley Olsen and Madonna. “I used to f*ck Ashley that’s why the twins got the [shout] out on N-ggas in Paris,” he wrote, adding about Madonna: “When I made out with Madonna she was bragging about how she f*cked Basquiat and PAC. I was like damn she love to brag just like meee.”Despite the apology to JAY-Z, West followed up with a crude question about the rapper’s marriage to Beyoncé, asking: “Do Beyonce ever let Jay get p*ssy. I mean like at least a couple times.”He also took aim at Tyler, The Creator, stating: “Why I never asked Tyler to rap on my albums. Cause he can’t rap.” The posts continued with remarks about his ex-wife Kim Kardashian, race, sexuality, and even his own past life beliefs, with West stating that he believed he was both Hitler and Jesus in previous lives.Also Read: Is Travis Kelce just Taylor Swift’s next song title?

Why Aaron Rodgers’ weekly appearances are raising eyebrows in sports media — Has Pat McAfee given him too much power?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/why-aaron-rodgers-weekly-appearances-are-raising-eyebrows-in-sports-media-has-pat-mcafee-given-him-too-much-power/articleshow/120163670.cms,"Image via Imagn Images

Aaron Rodgers’ influence may be changing the tone and focus of The Pat McAfee Show

When Pat McAfee welcomed Aaron Rodgers onto The Pat McAfee Show as a regular guest, it was a ratings jackpot. Rodgers, a future Hall of Fame quarterback known for his strong opinions and unpredictable commentary, brought a mix of authenticity, controversy, and star power to the show. But as time has gone on, fans and critics alike have begun asking: has McAfee given Rodgers too much influence on the show and its direction?Pat McAfee’s rise in sports media has been fueled by his unapologetically unfiltered style and close connections with big-name athletes. His willingness to give Aaron Rodgers a space to speak freely was initially praised as groundbreaking. But as Rodgers continues to use the platform to make bold statements—ranging from vaccine skepticism to conspiracy theories—some argue the balance has shifted.Rather than challenging Rodgers, McAfee often appears to agree or laugh off controversial remarks, which has led to criticism that the show enables rather than questions. What started as an entertaining segment has morphed into something larger—an unmoderated soapbox for one of the NFL’s most polarizing figures.There’s also the question of whether Rodgers' influence has shifted the show's broader identity. McAfee built his brand on humor, relatability, and insight into the sports world. However, the increasing focus on Rodgers' worldview—often far removed from football—has left some longtime viewers feeling alienated.Rodgers doesn’t just make headlines when he’s on the show—he is the headline. While that might be good for clicks and engagement, it may be hurting the show's credibility with audiences looking for balanced coverage and football-first commentary.At the heart of this dilemma is the blurred line between friendship and media responsibility. McAfee clearly respects and likes Rodgers, but as a media figure with growing influence, he may need to consider the long-term impact of giving a single guest such an unchecked platform.Also Read: Is Aaron Rodgers really a perfect match for the Steelers? Why the saga needs to end now before it gets messier As the NFL season progresses and public scrutiny intensifies, McAfee faces a tough call: continue giving Rodgers free rein or reassert editorial control. Because in the court of public opinion, giving someone a mic is easy—taking it back is much harder.","Aaron rodgers' influence may be changing the tone and focus of the pat mcafee show.

Astrologer Predicts: Will Hardik Pandya & Mumbai Indians work out?

NEW DELHI: The crowd at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium kept roaring and cheering, even as Royal Challengers Bengaluru faced defeat against Delhi Capitals . The reason? Their hometown hero KL Rahul was putting on a show at his home ground. Rahul lit up the evening with his elegant strokeplay, thrilling the fans with towering hits across the park. When he sealed the win by launching Yash Dayal over the long leg boundary and celebrated with a chest thump, the stadium erupted — a heartfelt ovation for their very own local lad.KL Rahul produced a batting masterclass on Thursday to lead Delhi Capitals to a convincing six-wicket win over Royal Challengers Bengaluru. Chasing a tricky 164 on a two-paced surface, Rahul stood tall amid early chaos, anchoring the innings with a sublime unbeaten 93 off just 53 balls, laced with nine fours and five sixes.Rahul’s calm amidst the storm came after Delhi’s top order collapsed to 30 for 3 in the fifth over. But the wicketkeeper-batter kept his composure, stitched crucial partnerships with Axar Patel (15) and later Tristan Stubbs (38* off 23), and saw the chase through with 13 balls to spare.With this win, Delhi Capitals extended their unbeaten run to four matches, firmly holding onto second place on the points table, just behind Gujarat Titans.Earlier, RCB posted a below-par 163 for 7 after electing to bat, a total that never truly looked threatening once the Delhi spinners got into rhythm.Phil Salt gave the hosts a blazing start with a 17-ball 37, taking Mitchell Starc for 30 runs in one over, and helping RCB reach 61 by the end of the fourth over. But once Salt was run out in a mix-up with Kohli, the innings spiraled downward.Vipraj Nigam turned the game on its head with his leg-spin, first dismissing the dangerous Kohli for 22 and then removing Krunal Pandya later in the innings. His spell of 2 for 18 in four overs was instrumental in derailing the RCB charge. Kuldeep Yadav also chipped in with his guile, picking up two crucial wickets — Rajat Patidar (25) and Jitesh Sharma (3) — to ensure the middle order couldn’t capitalise on the platform.Despite a few powerful late hits from Tim David, who remained unbeaten on 37 off 20 balls, RCB’s total lacked the punch needed to challenge Delhi’s deep batting unit.However, Delhi didn’t have the smoothest of starts.Faf du Plessis was out for 2, Fraser-McGurk fell for 7, and Porel followed soon after, leaving the visitors reeling. But KL Rahul played the perfect anchor, absorbing the pressure and gradually shifting gears. His six off Livingstone over midwicket and a glorious straight drive off Hazlewood were just glimpses of his dominance.After Axar fell trying to force the pace, Stubbs joined Rahul and ensured there were no further hiccups. The duo added 111 runs for the unbroken sixth wicket stand and finished things off in style — KL rahul sealing the match with a six in the 18th over.","Kl rahul produced a batting masterclass to lead delhi capitals to a convincing six-wicket win over royal challengers bengaluru.

NEW DELHI: Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) stalwart Virat Kohli has added yet another feather to his already glittering cap.The batting maestro became the first-ever player to hit 1,000 boundaries -- including 721 fours and 280 sixes -- in the Indian Premier League ( IPL ), reaching the historic milestone during RCB’s clash against Delhi Capitals (DC) at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium on Thursday.Also See: RCB vs DC In front of a buzzing home crowd, Kohli stroked his way into the record books with a typically crisp six that brought up the moment fans had been waiting for.With over 8,190 IPL runs to his name, Kohli's landmark further cements his position as the undisputed king of consistency in the tournament’s history.Although the joy was short-lived as Kohli was dismissed for 22 off 14 balls by young leg-spinner Vipraj Nigam, it was a knock that had enough flair to showcase why he remains a force at the top of the order.Nigam’s delivery, a teasing leg-break, lured Kohli into a drive that resulted in a stunning catch by Mitchell Starc at long-off, momentarily silencing the electrified Chinnaswamy crowd.Earlier, DC skipper Axar Patel had won the toss and opted to bowl first.Delhi, unbeaten in the tournament so far, made a surprise change, bringing in Faf du Plessis for Samir Rizvi.RCB, on the other hand, stuck with a consistent XI as captain Rajat Patidar emphasised the importance of home wins and building momentum.""We would have loved to chase, but the surface looks hard, we'll look to put up a good total and defend it. I always back my instincts, but I do plan as well. It's important to win home matches as well, important to have the momentum going,"" RCB batter Rajat Patidar said at the toss.","Virat kohli becomes the first-ever player to hit 1,000 boundaries in the indian premier league ( ipl) kohli reached the historic milestone during rcb’s clash against delhi capitals (dc) at the m chinnaswamy stadium on thursday.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120166179,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-178772,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Pakistan's senior all-rounder Shadab Khan has expressed frustration over repeated allegations of favouritism and promotion due to his relationship with Saqlain Mushtaq , his father-in-law and a mentor appointed by the Pakistan Cricket Board ( PCB ).Saqlain, who has held influential positions within the PCB, including head coach of the national team and a role at the National Cricket Academy, has been accused of favouring Shadab in selection matters.Shadab, who has been part of the Pakistan team for nearly seven years, made a surprise comeback to the T20 squad for the New Zealand tour as vice-captain after being out of the team since the ICC T20 World Cup last year.This move has fueled speculation and criticism from former players and critics, suggesting that Shadab's selection is influenced by his familial ties to Saqlain.""It is frustrating and disappointing to hear such things because my career is nearly seven years long,"" Shadab told the Pakistani media, as quoted by PTI.""I have given some good performances since debuting for Pakistan.

Marcell Ozuna’s series of injuries and recovery history

Will Marcell Ozuna play tonight or rest again?

Atlanta Braves fans eagerly wait for updates regarding their favorite players, and Marcell Ozuna is one of them. All the fans are curious to know will Marcell Ozuna will play tonight when the Atlanta Braves take on the Philadelphia Phillies at Truist Park at 7:15 pm ET. Marcell Ozuna is the best hitter for the team, and his absence was noticed in the last games. His fans are hoping he will return but so far have received no word from the Braves if they plan to play or not tonight.During a match with the Arizona Diamondbacks, Marcell Ozuna got his right hamstring tightened up. This followed after attempting to leg out a ground ball and being unable to reach first base. The team immediately had him leave the game and be ""day-to-day.""Although the injury does not appear to be that bad, hamstring problems can worsen if they are not handled delicately. The Braves would not give him a return timetable. They simply stated that Marcell Ozuna is being evaluated by the medical staff and that they will watch him daily.Marcell Ozuna has gotten off to a fantastic start in the 2025 season. He already had 3 home runs on his resume and has been one of the Braves' best producers in the lineup. His ability to hit home runs is a plus for the team, particularly in this type of clutch game against the Phillies.Till now, there are no official reports on whether Marcell Ozuna will be included in the lineup today. He was spotted doing light exercise during practice, which denotes he is healthy, and it is a positive sign, but it does not necessarily guarantee that he will play. The Braves might opt to rest him for one more day to ensure he is fine.With the season up to this point long, the Braves don't want to risk losing him to a more serious illness. Marcell Ozuna will likely be back shortly, but whether tonight or eventually will depend on how he is feeling and what the doctors advise.Fans will be eagerly waiting for the official lineup announcement closer to game time in Truist Park. Ozuna has been a key piece of the Braves' offense this season, and his presence in the lineup provides both power and experience. However, the team’s cautious approach highlights their long-term focus, prioritizing player health over short-term gains. If Ozuna does sit out tonight, expect the Braves to rely on their bench depth to fill the gap in the batting order.Also Read: ""I Made A Mistake"": When Marcelll Ozuna Apologized For Domestic Violence Controversy","Atlanta braves star marcell ozuna got his right hamstring tightened up against the arizona diamondbacks.
