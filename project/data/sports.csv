Bengals Say Goodbye to Trey Hendrickson Despite His Dominant Season

the

$15M Investment Signals Shift from Defense to Offense

Fans React to the Bengals' Game-Changing Strategy

The Cincinnati Bengals just made a move that has fans scratching their heads — parting ways with their defensive powerhouse Trey Hendrickson and splashing $15 million on a new star, all in the name of protecting Joe Burrow . It’s a bold shift, trading sack stats for quarterback security, and it's got everyone talking.Trey Hendrickson wasn’t just a key part of the Bengals' defense — he wasguy. A relentless pass-rusher, Hendrickson led the league in sacks last season, proving his value week in and week out. His ability to disrupt offenses made him a cornerstone of Cincinnati’s defense. Even when trade rumors started swirling about his future with the team, a prominent quarterback stepped up and publicly backed him, adding weight to the belief that Hendrickson wasn’t going anywhere — or so it seemed.But now? In a stunning turn of events, Hendrickson is out, leaving fans and analysts alike shocked. The Bengals have pivoted in an unexpected direction, signaling a bold shift in their defensive strategy.In place of Hendrickson, the Bengals have invested $15 million in a new player, not to bolster their defense but to fortify the offensive line. The clear motive? Keep Joe Burrow upright.After seasons marred by injuries and constant pressure, it seems Cincinnati is done taking risks with their franchise QB’s health. This isn’t just a trade — it’s a statement. They’re prioritizing Burrow’s protection over defensive dominance.The move has sparked debate among fans and analysts alike. While some understand the logic — a healthy Burrow is essential for playoff dreams — others question the cost of letting a sack leader walk away.Hendrickson’s absence will surely leave a gap in the Bengals’ defense, but the team seems confident that bolstering the offensive line will pay off in the long run.This roster shakeup marks more than just a swap — it’s a recalibration of the Bengals' identity. Defense wins games, but a protected Joe Burrow wins championships. The franchise seems to be betting that keeping their star quarterback safe is the key to long-term success.Now, all eyes are on the 2025 season. Will this gamble pay off, or will the Bengals regret trading sacks for security?What’s your take — did the Bengals make the right move to put Burrow’s health above all else?Also read - Fans Rally Behind Tua Tagovailoa After 'Dad Bod' Yacht Photos Go Viral — 'Let the Man Relax","Cincinnati bengals traded defensive star trey hendrickson for $15 million.

It has been more than a decade since Paul Goldschmidt played in the league. Over his career, Goldschmidt has played with three teams.

Steve Kerr Explains Why He Told Jimmy Butler to Break NBA’s Unwritten Rule

Jimmy Butler’s Triple-Double Overshadowed by Controversial Shot

Jimmy Butler single handedly forces a shot clock violation

Gary Payton II Scores Career-High 26 Points to Lead Golden State Warriors to Victory

What should have been a straightforward win for the Warriors turned into a mess after the game. Jimmy Butler 's triple-double was overshadowed by a last-second shot that really upset the Portland Trail Blazers players — and it looked like it got under Butler's skin too. A video from after the game showed a tense moment between him and coach Steve Kerr , who later revealed he was the one who told Butler to take that shot. Here’s the whole story behind that unexpected twist.As the clock wound down in the Warriors' 130-120 win over the Portland Trail Blazers, Jimmy Butler was in a bit of a bind. With Golden State comfortably ahead and only a few ticks left, he had to choose between holding the ball or taking a shot. Usually, teams would just let the clock run out in these moments. But after a quick glance at Steve Kerr on the sideline, Butler decided to take an open jumper, which ruffled a few feathers among the Trail Blazers players.Footage from after the game showed Jimmy Butler frustrated during a brief but intense talk with Steve Kerr. Kerr later explained his reasoning, saying, “I told him, we don't do shot clock violations. If there’s a shot clock differential, we always shoot.” Kerr’s firm stance on this philosophy put Butler in a tricky situation, even though he seemed a little reluctant on the court.Butler had a standout performance that evening! He scored 15 points, pulled down 10 rebounds, and tallied 10 assists, marking his second triple-double this season and his first as a Warrior. His previous triple-double was on December 16 while he was with the Miami Heat. The Warriors are sitting pretty with a 12-1 record when Butler plays, highlighting his significant role in their success.While all this is happening, Stephen Curry keeps shining this season, hitting five 3-pointers and bringing his total to 251. This is his 11th season with 250+ threes, which is an NBA record. He’s just two 3-pointers away from being the first player to hit 4,000 career triples.Even with the fuss going on, the Warriors' depth was a key factor in their victory. Gary Payton II had an impressive night, scoring a career-high 26 points and tying his record with four 3-pointers. Buddy Hield also made his mark with six 3-pointers and 20 points, showing off the Warriors' strong offensive lineup.The arguments between Jimmy Butler and Steve Kerr after the game definitely caught some attention, but it doesn't take away from how well the Warriors played. With Stephen Curry on the verge of hitting a major milestone and Butler stepping up with his all-around skills, Golden State is proving they're a force to be reckoned with.Also Read - Shai Gilgeous-Alexander vs Nikola Jokic: Who Truly Deserves the 2025 NBA MVP?

Superstar Roman Reigns made headlines when he returned to WWE on the March 10 episode of Monday Night RAW.

Later, he went on to attack CM Punk, who was joined by his friend Paul Heyman, with a vicious spear, ultimately gifting Rollins the win.This action led everyone to wonder why the OTC did not join his cousin Jey Uso who locked horns with Grayson Waller in the singles match and then later attacked by Austin Theory and Gunther. Let's find out the possible reason for his decision to not join and help Jey Uso, but his arch-rival Seth Rollins.During the main event, Roman Reigns made a comeback after his hiatus after the Royal Rumble 2025. The OTC entered the RAW to intervene in the steel cage match between Seth Rollins and CM Punk.The Tribal Chief came back with vengeance in his mind, after Rollins had previously taken him out with two stomps at the Royal Rumble match. This incident added speculation that the company is possibly planning a triple-threat match between Reigns, Seth Rollins, and CM Punk at the upcoming WrestleMania 41 Meanwhile, Jey Uso, who happens to be Reigns' cousin, also participated in the same event. During the WWE RAW match, Jey Uso locked horns with Grayson Waller. Though Uso won the match against Waller, the feud did not end there. He was subsequently attacked by Austin Theory and Gunther.Similarly, fans are wondering why Reigns did not join the bandwagon to help Jey Uso from Gunther and Theory, given the fact that the Tribal Chief has resolved all issues with Jey Uso.The possible reason behind it may be the company's decision to not make a crossover between them. It could have happened that the OTC did not reach the venue and had different timelines in their appearance.Besides, the Triple-H creative team has something different in their plan about the upcoming triple-threat match.

Fans Support The Boston Bruins’ Decision To Trade Brad Marchand To The Florida Panthers



Brad Marchand, the former captain of the Boston Bruins, recently got traded to the Florida Panthers and fans are still in shock about it. Recently, former NHL players Paul Bissonnette and Ryan Whitney spoke about how the Boston Bruins were unwilling to settle on an amount with Brad Marchand, which resulted in his trade to the Florida Panthers. But fans dont agree with this.On a recent episode of the Spittin Chiclets podcast, Paul Bissonnetee said, “It was offered exactly what he's making now for three years…and Marchand's camp wanted seven and a half. And Marchand had a meeting with Don Sweeney…and they would not come up on their offer. I thought that that was insane. You wouldn't give Brad Marchand the same amount that you paid Lindholm. That's crazy to me.”However, fans feel otherwise about the whole situation; a fan commented, “dude, they wanted him out... its that simple”, while another fan wrote, “They didn't like his leadership, money was not the problem.”A third fan wrote, “Hes almost 37, frequently injured lately (double hip surgery) & slowing down. 16 yrs in Boston or not, you can't write him a blank check & handcuff a drowning team longer. Bergy, Chara, even Krejci took less at the end to build a better team. Seems like Marchy wouldn't do that”.Another user wrote, “He’s not worth even 5M a year at 37 years old 😂”, while a sixth one noted, “Send me the list of players over 37 that got that high an AAV for 3 years. I’ll wait. We will see what he gets on the open market. I think he will be disappointed”.Brad Marchand’s trade to the Florida Panthers has sent shockwaves across the league. Many fans have slammed the Boston Bruins’ team as well as Don Sweeney for deciding to trade Brad Marchand.However, at a recent interview, Brad Marchand, the former captain of the Boston Bruins have hinted at a possible return to his former team in July. He said, “I know it didn’t come together now. Can things change down the road? Potentially, but that’s to be seen.

Mike Williams reunites with Chargers on a one-year deal to strengthen wide receiver lineup,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/mike-williams-reunites-with-chargers-on-a-one-year-deal-to-strengthen-wide-receiver-lineup/articleshow/118956646.cms,"Credit: Getty Images

Mike Williams Makes a Comeback to the Chargers on a One-Year Deal



Mike Williams is set to make a return to the Los Angeles Chargers after spending just one season away from the team. According to NFL Network's Tom Pelissero, Williams has agreed to a one-year contract worth up to $6 million. This reunion marks a significant moment for both Williams and the Chargers, as the team looks to strengthen its offense after a challenging season.The Chargers originally selected Williams with the seventh overall pick in the 2017 NFL Draft. He spent his first seven seasons with the team, establishing himself as a reliable target for the Chargers' offense. However, Williams left Los Angeles last offseason, signing with the New York Jets in a move that was expected to elevate his career alongside Aaron Rodgers. Unfortunately, that plan unraveled quickly when Rodgers suffered a season-ending injury. Williams was then traded to the Pittsburgh Steelers in November, where he finished the 2024 season.Williams struggled to make a significant impact during his time with the Jets and Steelers. Over 18 games last season, he managed just 21 receptions for 298 yards and one touchdown. Interestingly, that lone touchdown came during his debut with the Steelers — a game-winning catch that briefly hinted at the playmaking ability he had displayed with the Chargers in previous years.Williams's last full season with the Chargers in 2023 was cut short after he suffered a torn ACL in Week 3, forcing him to miss the rest of the season. However, his contributions to the Chargers' offense before the injury were undeniable. He led the team in receiving yards during both the 2021 (1,146 yards) and 2022 (895 yards) seasons, showcasing his ability to be a dominant downfield threat.The Chargers' decision to bring Williams back reflects their urgent need for experienced pass catchers to support quarterback Justin Herbert. The team's receiving corps faced significant setbacks last season, prompting new general manager Joe Hortiz to make adjustments. Williams’s return offers Herbert a familiar and reliable target, which could help stabilize the offense. Despite his struggles last season, Williams remains a physical receiver who can use his size to make contested catches — a skill set that could be valuable in the red zone and on critical third downs.While Williams’s stock may have dipped following his disappointing stint with the Jets and Steelers, a return to a familiar system with Herbert under center could be exactly what he needs to rejuvenate his career. Ladd McConkey is expected to lead the receiving unit, but Williams will likely compete with Quentin Johnson for snaps. With the Chargers also expected to add more weapons through the 2025 NFL Draft, Williams will have to prove he still has enough left in the tank to earn consistent playing time.Also Read: “Trade them and move on”: Former NFL star Robert Griffin III criticizes Cowboys' handling of Micah Parsons' contract negotiations Williams's return to the Chargers feels like a last chance to prove he can still be a difference-maker. If he can stay healthy and regain his form, he could provide a much-needed spark for the Chargers’ offense. His familiarity with Herbert and the offensive system gives him a strong foundation to bounce back and potentially make this comeback season one to remember.","Mike williams has agreed to a one-year contract with the los angeles chargers, according to nfl network's tom pelissero.

Despite his busy schedule, Brady has maintained a balance between his professional commitments and fatherhood, ensuring that his children—Benjamin, Vivian, and Jack—remain a priority.Brady’s unwavering connection to football was highlighted when he shared an Instagram story showing him throwing a football with the caption, “true love.” This subtle yet powerful statement reflects that his passion for the game remains unchanged. Speaking on The Pivot Podcast in May 2024, Brady admitted that his motivation was never about winning titles but rather about the sheer joy of the game. “It was never to be a champion. I love just throwing the football. When I throw the football and I see that ball spiral out of my hands, I’m like, ‘Woo! Love that! You guys want to go to the beach? Let’s throw the football. I’ll have a hell of a time. We would laugh, we would probably play for three hours out there,’” Brady shared, underscoring how football remains a fundamental part of his identity.Gisele Bündchen has also moved forward gracefully.

The couple has been spotted vacationing together in Costa Rica, often accompanied by their daughter, Vivian, reflecting a harmonious and supportive family dynamic.Bündchen has openly spoken about the emotional challenges following her split from Brady. In a 2023 interview with Vanity Fair, she reflected on the complexities of their relationship, stating, “When I was 26 years old and he was 29, we met, we wanted a family, we wanted things together. As time goes by, we realize that we just wanted different things, and now we have a choice to make. That doesn’t mean you don’t love the person.” Bündchen’s candid acknowledgment highlights the mutual respect that remains between them despite their separation.Motherhood continues to be central to Bündchen’s life. She recently welcomed a baby with Valente, though the details have been kept private. To relax during her postpartum period, Bündchen was spotted enjoying a yacht trip in Miami with Valente in March 2025. Her recent comments about feeling “like she lived in Tom [Brady’s] shadow for a long time” suggest that she has now reclaimed her independence and sense of self. Bündchen has also embraced a more balanced lifestyle, focusing on self-care and mindfulness.While Brady and Bündchen have taken different paths, they remain committed to co-parenting their children with mutual respect. Brady’s acknowledgment of Bündchen in his Mother’s Day Instagram story in May 2024 reflects the amicable nature of their post-divorce relationship.

Champions Return: Rohit, Hardik, Shreyas, Gambhir return after India's title triumph

NEW DELHI: Pakistan cricket has once again found itself in the middle of controversy and chaos following its first-round exit from the Champions Trophy 2025 — a tournament they were hosting on home soil after 29 years.The disappointment has not only triggered fan outrage but also exposed deep divisions among past and present coaching figures. Mickey Arthur , who led Pakistan during one of their more successful white-ball phases, was brutally honest in his criticism. Speaking to talkSport, Arthur said, “I love this quote, to be brutally honest. Jason Gillespie is a wonderful coach, wonderful man. Pakistan cricket just continues to shoot itself in the foot. It is its worst enemy.”Arthur believes Pakistan had made the right moves by appointing Jason Gillespie and Gary Kirsten to helm the red-ball and white-ball squads, respectively.However, he expressed regret at the ongoing instability that continues to plague the system. “There are so many good players; they’ve got the resources now; there's so much young talent. They have incredible skill. And yet, it's still so chaotic. It's really disappointing to see.”In a sharp rebuttal to Aaqib Javed’s comments blaming Pakistan’s recent struggles on “too many changes”, Gillespie accused the newly appointed coach of trying to “undermine them” and even called Javed a “clown.”Arthur echoed those concerns, pointing to deeper issues in Pakistan’s cricketing structure. “They had got some really good coaches who could take them forward. But then that machine that works in Pakistan just keeps undermining, and agendas are driven in the media,” he said.ALSO SEE: Jason Gillespie calls Pakistan's Aaqib Javed a 'clown' “It's a jungle out there and I feel desperately sorry for Gary and Jason.

ICC defends protocol as controversy erupts over missing Pakistani representative

India win Champions Trophy title; Rohit Sharma confirms he's not retiring

Former Pakistan wicketkeeper-batter Kamran Akmal has stirred controversy with his blunt remarks regarding the absence of a representative from host nation Pakistan during the prize distribution ceremony of the recently concluded ICC Champions Trophy Akmal asserted that Pakistan did not ""deserve"" to have a representative on stage, citing the team's poor performance and lack of respect on the international stage.""The ICC showed us the mirror,"" Akmal said on his YouTube channel. ""The tournament's director (Sumair) was there. He was available, and why wasn't he in the ceremony? It is because we don't deserve to be there. We are not playing good cricket. Minow teams have shown us the mirror.""He further expressed his disappointment with the current state of Pakistan cricket, adding, ""No one discussed how Pakistan hosted the tournament. If we play such cricket, we will be treated like this. If you play for yourself, there will be no respect.""The controversy erupted when Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chief executive and Champions Trophy tournament director Sumair Ahmad Syed, who was present at the venue in Dubai, was not invited on stage for the final presentation. India clinched the Champions Trophy title for the third time by defeating New Zealand by four wickets, but Pakistan's absence from the ceremonial proceedings drew widespread criticism back home.The PCB lodged a formal complaint with the International Cricket Council (ICC), calling the incident ""unacceptable."" A PCB official was quoted by PTI as stating, ""We have filed a formal complaint with the ICC as what happened is unacceptable to us.""ALSO SEE: 'Pakistan is its worst enemy': Former coach Mickey Arthur backs Jason Gillespie after ‘clown’ jab at Aaqib Javed However, ICC sources have reportedly dismissed the complaint, indicating that the PCB is unlikely to receive a formal explanation or apology. The ICC maintained that the protocol did not mandate the presence of the tournament director on stage.Responding to the criticism, an ICC source explained to PTI, ""If the PCB mandarins look up, even ICC CEO Geoff Allardice wasn't present on stage. The reason is protocol. Sumair Ahmed is an employee of the PCB and not an office-bearer. Also, please check when has a tournament director been on stage for presentation?""During the prize distribution ceremony, BCCI president Roger Binny presented white jackets to Indian players and handed medals to match officials, while ICC chairman Jay Shah presented the trophy to India skipper Rohit Sharma. Other dignitaries on stage included BCCI secretary Devajit Saikia and New Zealand Cricket CEO Roger Twose.","Former pakistan wicketkeeper-batter kamran akmal has stirred controversy with his blunt remarks regarding the absence of a representative from host nation pakistan.
