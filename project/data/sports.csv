'Nothing new': Rohit Sharma on his struggles ahead of England ODIs

What does Shubman Gill's horoscope say about his captaincy future

Rohit Sharma's batting in ODIs has been game changing: Shubman Gill

NEW DELHI: ""India win the T20 World Cup after 17 years. The drought is over. Despair a thought for what Hardik Pandya has done i n the last half an hour"" — the passionate words of the former cricketer and ex-Team India head coach Ravi Shastri still resonate in the ears of Indian cricket fans. India clinched the T20 World Cup 2024 trophy after defeating South Africa in a thrilling final.India's star all-rounder, Hardik Pandya — one of the architects of India’s T20 World Cup triumph — spoke to the ICC in an interview, reflecting on the exhilarating final against South Africa and how he maintained his composure in the pressure-cooker atmosphere.Pandya also shared insights into his strategy for dismissing the dangerous Heinrich Klaasen ""There wasn't much spoken. Rohit and I have played together for so many years. He knows my character, my personality, and how much I value cricket awareness. Just before the ball, I told him that I was going to bowl wide to Klaasen. I just knew he would be expecting a delivery on the stumps. His stance was slightly leg-side dominant, so I anticipated he would try to hit me there,"" Pandya said.""Just before my run-up, right before I started, I looked at him and was about to say, 'I am going to bowl a slower one.' But I hadn’t set a field for a slower ball. I had to outfox him, to be one step ahead in the game so he wouldn’t anticipate the delivery. The way he was hitting was just tremendous. That moment, I think, opened the door for us.""I have always thrived in and enjoyed these high-pressure situations; they bring out the best in me. I have always visualized myself bowling the last over or scoring the winning run in a World Cup final.""In Barbados, there was a strong breeze blowing toward the dressing room side. If he wanted to drag me, he would have to hit against the wind, which increased the chances of a mistimed shot. My strength would have been a stump yorker, but we deliberately went outside off-stump for a specific reason—if he wanted to hit us, he had to do it against the odds, not in his favorable zone. That was pure situational awareness and understanding our strengths. I think that’s why we remained calm and composed with our plans.""Rohit and I spoke after the game as well. When the ball went up in the air, it initially looked like it would land inside the 30-yard circle or that a fielder would have to run in. But then we saw the wind carrying it farther and farther, and it just kept going—it didn’t stop.""And obviously, what Surya did in that moment, with such presence of mind and calmness, was sheer brilliance. We won as a team, but for me to play such a crucial role—it feels surreal. It’s a dream that actually came true.""It felt like a huge weight had been lifted off my shoulders. The relief of the past six, seven, eight months just washed over me. I’m really, really proud of how I stood strong. Maybe I didn’t show much emotion, but everything I had been going through just came out in that moment. The pressure, the burden I had been carrying, just lifted, and I thought, ‘Yes… finally, I did it for my country,’"" Pandya said.","India clinched the t20 world cup 2024 trophy after defeating south africa in a thrilling final.

India captain Rohit Sharma expressed unease over questions around his future in international cricket at the pre-match press conference in Nagpur on Wednesday, ahead of the first ODI against England.After the Suryakumar Yadav-led India defeated England 4-1 in the T20I series, Rohit assumed captaincy of the ODI team for a three-match series, beginning on Thursday.Rohit, who is under the scanner for his poor run since the start of this season, said it's not relevant to talk about his career when there is the series against England and Champions Trophy after that lined up.""How is it relevant that I talk about my future plans when there are three ODIs and the Champions Trophy! The reports (on my future) are going on for a number of years, and I am not here to clarify those reports,"" Rohit said.""For me, the three games (against England) and the Champions Trophy are very important. My focus is on these games and I will see what happens thereafter,"" he added.Rohit scored just 31 runs in five Test innings during the Border Gavaskar Trophy series on India's tour of Australia, after which speculation related to his retirement have been rife.Rohit retired from T20Is after India's T20 World Cup triumph in June last year.""This is a different format, different time. As cricketers, there will be ups and downs and I have faced those a lot in my career. This is nothing new to me. We know everyday is a fresh day, every series is a fresh series,"" said Rohit.""I am looking forward to the challenge, not looking at what has happened in the past. There is no reason for me to look behind too much. It's important that I focus on what is coming up and what lies ahead for me. Look to try and start this series on a high,"" he added.The three-match series against England ends on February 12, and the Champions Trophy begins on February 19 in Pakistan. India will play all their matches in Dubai as the tournament was turned hybrid following the Indian team's refusal to travel to Pakistan.","Rohit sharma is under the scanner for his poor run since the start of this season.

'Nothing new': Rohit Sharma on his struggles ahead of England ODIs

Despite Rishabh Pant 's return to the ODI squad, KL Rahul will continue as India's wicketkeeper for the ODI series against England and likely for the Champions Trophy as well, India captain Rohit Sharma confirmed.Rahul took on wicketkeeping duties during India's 2023 World Cup campaign in Pant's absence while he was recovering from a car accident. Although Rahul performed well in the tournament, Pant made a successful comeback to the T20I squad for the 2024 T20 World Cup, which India won in Barbados.Rohit emphasised that Rahul has proven his worth in the ODI format and earned his place in the playing XI for the England series. He also noted that Pant’s return provides the team with flexibility in selection, calling it a ""good headache"" to have.""Look, obviously KL has been keeping wickets for us in the ODI format for a number of years now and he's done pretty well. You know, if you look at the last 10 or 15 ODIs, he's done exactly what the team required him to do.""Rishabh is well, you know, he's there. You know, we've got an option of playing either one of them. Both are quite capable of winning games on their own. So it's a good headache to have whether to play KL or Rishabh. But obviously looking at what we have done in the past, having that continuity is also very important for us. So that is where we stand as a team,"" said Rohit while addressing the press conference ahead of the first ODI against England in Nagpur.Rohit acknowledged that the team had limited ODI matches last year but affirmed their commitment to playing aggressive cricket.""There is a certain type of cricket that we want to play, certain brand of cricket we want to play and whether it means that we have to go and do what we did in the World Cup, we will try and do that.But again, the World Cup was one-and-a-half years back, you know. So clearly we need to regroup as a group now and think about what we need to do here. Obviously, there is a lot of experience in the squad so you can't keep telling them exactly how you need to prepare for every series. They understand what is expected of the team. So, there's not much talk about what kind of approach we want to have.These guys know exactly what is required of each one of us. So it's just about coming together now because it's been a while since we played this format. So, it's just about coming together and trying to do where we left off during the World Cup. If it takes a little bit of time. So we get, you know, it's not easy to start what we did in the World Cup. As I said, the World Cup was one-and-a-half years ago. So we need to try and think about what we need to do here now and start fresh,"" said Rohit.The India captain outlined the reasoning behind selecting leg-spinner Varun Chakravarthy in the ODI squad, despite already having Ravindra Jadeja , Kuldeep Yadav, and Axar Patel in the lineup.""He has certainly shown something different. I understand that it is in T20 format, but he's clearly got something different about him. So we just wanted to have an option and see what we can do with it. Clearly, during the series it presents us an opportunity to play him at some stage and see what he is capable of.When asked if the team management is considering Chakravarthy for the Champions Trophy, Rohit responded that while he isn't currently focusing on Chakravarthy for the squad, the leg-spinner is certainly in contention.""Right now we are not thinking about whether we're going to take him or not, but definitely he will be in contention. If things pan out really well for us and he does what is required, then definitely there is something that we need to think about,"" he added.India's captain refused to talk about who all are in the picture as replacements for a fast-bowling allrounder in case Hardik Pandya gets injured like he did in the 2023 World Cup. ""Why do you have negative thoughts,"" Rohit said. ""We should have positive thoughts.""Why do you want him to get injured? Let's all pray that every player is 100 per cent fit and remains fit,"" he added.",Kl rahul will continue as india's wicketkeeper for the odi series against england and likely for the champions trophy as well.

SA20: MICT coach Robin Peterson lauds team's performance after win over Pretoria Capitals

Lhuan-dre Pretorius is 18 and has played for the South Africa U19s. He's scored 338 runs this SA20 season.Ryan Rickelton is 28 and cracked 303 runs in this third edition of the T20 league.Kwena Maphaka is 18 and is early into his Proteas career while notching five wickets for MI Cape Town.21-year-old Dewald Brevis is also a newbie on the big stage while making his mark in the SA20 2025 - 253 runs and three wickets.These four, and many more, are coming through the ranks and carrying the mantle for South African cricket as they undergo a resurgence having reached the T20 World Cup last year and booking a place in the World Test Championship final in June.Former South Africa allrounder Vernon Philander believes the talent has always been there in South African cricket, it just needed to be brought to the fore with the right guidance.Drawing parallels with past transitions, Philander noted how South Africa seamlessly moved from legends like himself, Dale Steyn, and Morne Morkel to Anrich Nortje , Marco Jansen, and Kagiso Rabada.""South Africa's always had a rich pool of talent. What a tournament like this (SA20) really does is it presents that sort of opportunity. With a six-team tournament, it allows your youngsters to come in and really excel and express themselves,"" the SA20 commentator told select media during the first qualifier between MI Cape Town and Paarl Royals on Tuesday.""You rub shoulders with real international superstars and I think that's the confidence that these youngsters will take away at the end of the day, having been in the same team.""Sometimes it's not about the performance but it's about the learning that takes place within that team. I think Paarl Royals, it's a pity that they've lost Joe Root because I think he's been exceptional. If you ask me about players who have really made an impact, I think Joe Root's probably the one that comes to mind straight away. He's left a massive legacy in terms of the experience that he's carried over to those younger players. And like I said, it's invaluable lessons learned for these youngsters,"" he added.During the league stage, Dinesh Karthik became the first Indian player to feature in the SA20. Philander, who included Suryakumar Yadav, Virat Kohli and Jasprit Bumrah in his wishlist for Indian players to come play the SA20, said rubbing shoulders with the veterans of the sport will aid South African cricket and its path forward.""It was massively needed in South Africa to have a T20 league to give the guys exposure. I think what it has also done is, you have foreign international players that come down and interact with the domestic players which is important. To rub shoulders with the likes of Root, Williamson etc,"" stated Philander who played 64 Tests, 30 ODIs and seven T20Is for South Africa.""And as much as it is a T20 competition, there's a lot of guys that, from a personal perspective, would learn a great deal. You can see, it's starting to pay off.""To make the World Test Championship Final was a massive (step) up for South Africa. Let's not forget, South Africa being in the World Cup T20 Final. All in all, cricket in South Africa is going in the right direction.""And for the first time, you have an Indian player in SA20. Dinesh Karthik is a wonderful athlete, he's a wonderful professional. It's great to have him over here. I think many of these guys, the youngsters especially, would learn a great deal from Karthik, having been a part of the IPL for a number of years.""I think a lot of these youngsters, like Pretorius, in years to come, might end up in one of these IPL teams. And you'd have learned a great deal and would have had great insights up front, learning from a guy like Karthik, being in the same changing room as him,"" further added Philander.As it stands, Pretorius is the second-highest run-scorer this SA20 season with Rickelton in third. Brevis is seventh on the list. How they do by the end of the tournament, and for the Proteas later, remains to be seen.","Former south africa allrounder vernon philander believes the talent has always been there in south african cricket, it just needed to be brought to the fore with the right guidance. Philander included suryakumar yadav, virat kohli and jasprit bumrah in his wishlist for indian players to come play the sa20.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117944997,imgsize-43668,width-400,resizemode-4/117944997.jpg"

Shami, who last played for India, before the England series, in the ICC Men's Cricket World Cup final in November 2023, is seen as a crucial asset for the team ahead of the upcoming ICC Men's Champions Trophy ""My biggest concern about India when they came for Australia in the Test series was [Jasprit] Bumrah not having Shami there as a backup and him having to burden most of the load,"" Ponting said on The ICC Review.""And that's probably what happened, and might even have something to do with why he [Bumrah] got hurt. He probably ended up having to bowl a bit more in that series with Shami not being there.""So look, if Shami's fit, that's a positive.""Shami made his return in the third and fourth T20Is against England, putting up an impressive performance with figures of 3/25 in his latest outing.Former India head coach and cricketer Ravi Shastri emphasised the importance of managing Shami's workload in the upcoming ODI series against England.""It will be interesting to see if India play him out in all three, or they give him the first one and the third one, and then ease him into the Champions Trophy ,"" Shastri said.""But he'll be watched very closely because 10 overs is totally different to four overs, and then you're going to see how he pulls up in the field as well having bowled those 10 overs.""Shami's form and fitness will be crucial for India as they begin their ICC Men's Champions Trophy campaign against Bangladesh on February 20 in Dubai.

India’s updated squad for ODI series against England:

NEW DELHI: The suspense around pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah 's fitness continues as the updated squad for the ODI series against England released by the BCCI on Tuesday does not feature his name, while he was earlier expected to be available for the third match of the series.The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) added mystery spinner Varun Chakaravarthy to the squad, rewarding him for the 14 wickets, including a five-wicket haul, he took in the five-match T20I series against England. It earned him the 'Player of the Series' award.Initially, when India's ODI squad was announced last month, the BCCI chief selector Ajit Agarkar had expressed hope for Bumrah to recover in time from his back injury for the third match.Bumrah suffered back spasms during the Sydney Test and could not bowl during Australia's second innings.""With Bumrah, we are waiting to hear about his fitness and when he's likely to be available,"" Agarkar had said while announcing the squad for the England white-ball series and Champions Trophy. ""At the moment I don't think he is likely to be fit for the first couple of games (ODIs vs England) at least from what we gather. We will probably hear more in the next week or so about his fitness.""I know he was asked to offload for five weeks of bowling, which is early first week February if I'm not wrong. And we'll probably find out a bit more around that time what exactly and with regards to what his medical condition is...It's better it comes from the (BCCI) medical department than me trying to explain what exactly is wrong with him. But that's the time frame that we've been told. And hopefully, he's okay after that.""However, on Tuesday, the updated ODI squad for the England series released by the BCCI did not feature Bumrah's name.As reported by Timesofindia.com earlier, Bumrah reached Bengaluru on February 2 and was scheduled to undergo scans and further assessment under the watchful eyes of BCCI's medical team.Bumrah has been named in India's Champions Trophy squad but his participation in the eight-team tournament depends on the outcome of the scans and assessment at the National Cricket Academy.The first ODI against England will be played in Nagpur on February 6, and the next two on February 9 and 12.

‘Great that two Chennai boys played the final’

CHENNAI: Grandmaster R Praggnanandhaa left 2024 behind with a tinge of disappointment. But he started the new year with a bang, toppling newly-crowned world champion and compatriot D Gukesh in tie-breakers to claim his maiden Tata Steel Chess title in Wijk aan Zee , the Netherlands. In doing so, he became only the second Indian to win the prestigious event, after Viswanathan Anand After finishing runner-up in the 2023 World Cup, the 19-year-old’s form took a hit in 2024. Pragg finished fifth at the Candidates Tournament but played a key role in India’s gold at the Budapest Chess Olympiad. However, his loss to USA’s Wesley So in the penultimate round ended India’s unbeaten run in the Open section.“It feels really good because I didn’t have a great end to 2024. I was highly motivated for this event and worked hard with my coach RB Ramesh sir. I think my efforts paid off, and I’m very happy that I managed to start the year with such a result,” Pragg told reporters after receiving a warm welcome from Sports Development Authority of Tamil Nadu (SDAT) officials at the Chennai Airport on Tuesday.Pragg’s victory at Tata Steel Chess was shaped by a mix of his brilliance and besides ‘lucky’ contributions from his Olympiad gold-winning squad members. Arjun Erigaisi ’s win over Gukesh in the final round pushed the latter into tie-breaks, while Pentala Harikrishna ’s draw with Nodirbek Abdusattorov kept the Uzbek GM out of the playoffs.But it wasn’t just in one way that Pragg’s teammates played roles in his run to the crown.When asked how he motivated himself after a challenging period, the Chennai boy said: “The results of other Indian chess players, like Gukesh winning the World Championship or Arjun Erigaisi crossing 2800 (Elo rating in classical chess), have definitely inspired me to work harder and keep going. That is one of the reasons, but not the only one. I was not really happy with my game quality, and I wanted to play better. I knew I could, and that’s what kept me going. So, I kept practising.”With the big victory, Pragg earned 25 circuit points, placing him second on the 2025 FIDE circuit leaderboard – an important step toward qualifying for the Candidates Tournament next year. Pragg said while the win was significant, there’s still a long road ahead. “It’s still the start of the year. Many huge tournaments are coming up in 2025, like the World Cup and Grand Swiss, and all these are very important for Candidates qualification. Still, this win is important for my confidence because I wasn’t happy with my games in the last few months, whereas I was satisfied with all the games I played at Tata Steel Chess.”In the intense final moments, the two Chennai boys, Pragg and Gukesh, fiercely vied for the title. “At the end of the day, the title came to our city, so that’s a proud feeling. It was nice to have two Chennai boys in the final. Huge congratulations to him (Gukesh) as well; he played really well. After the match, we spoke a bit about our game, but both of us were exhausted after such a long day,” said Pragg, who will next compete at the Prague Masters, scheduled from Feb 25 to March 7.","Gm r praggnanandhaa claims maiden tata steel chess title in wijk aan zee.

Rohit Sharma's batting in ODIs has been game changing: Shubman Gill

Will Rohit Sharma win another ICC trophy? Here's what the horoscope says

NAGPUR: Under the twilight sky of Birmingham in 2013, two young men revelled in the sheer joy of triumph. One, an exuberant 24-year-old, swayed to the beats of the viral sensation 'Gangnam Style'. The other, just a year older, clung to the Champions Trophy like a child unwilling to part with his most cherished possession. Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma — two names that would go on to redefine Indian cricket — stood on the cusp of greatness that day. The victory was more than just a moment of celebration; it was redemption. Indian cricket had been tainted by the scars of match-fixing in the Indian Premier League just weeks before, and this win was a cleansing fire.Twelve years later, the same two men stand at a crossroads. Rohit, the captain with an insatiable hunger for dominance, and Kohli, the run-machine whose name in cricket’s pantheon of greats still smells of fresh ink. As India readies itself for a three-match ODI series against England — a precursor to the much-awaited Champions Trophy in Pakistan and Dubai — the focus is sharper than ever on the two titans.For Rohit, this series is more than just another assignment; it is a reaffirmation of his position as India’s batting bedrock. The 2023 ODI World Cup saw him revolutionize India’s approach to the format, his fearless starts propelling the team to within inches of the title.Also See: Champions Trophy Full Schedule 2025 Indian vice-captain Shubman Gill too was all praise for his skipper’s style of play. “The way Rohit bhai has been batting in the ODIs in the past year and a half, it's been game-changing for us. Taking the momentum right through from the start and taking the game away from ball one, it makes the job of the non-striker and the batsmen coming in a bit easier and it has helped our team a lot,"" Gill said.Though he was unstoppable in white ball cricket last year, the whispers surrounding Rohit’s future have only grown louder. Speculation lingers, questions loom — does the Hitman still have bullets left in his chamber? His extended net session under the punishing Nagpur sun on Tuesday hinted at a man preparing to answer in the only way he knows — by sending the ball soaring into the stands. He looked sharp in the nets and was seen involved even when the spinners were bowling.Numbers, too, tell the story of Rohit’s blitzkrieg. Since 2023, India’s powerplay run rate has surged to 6.5 under Rohit’s aggressive blueprint. A balls-per-boundary ratio of 5.8, an astonishing 75 sixes in the last two years — the most by any batter in ODIs — underline his role as a modern-day maverick. And yet, a six-month hiatus from the format raises questions about his rhythm, readiness, and whether time away from the 50-over grind has dulled his edge.For Virat, the series is an opportunity to script yet another chapter in his illustrious ODI legacy. His red-ball struggles have been well-documented, but in the white-ball arena, he remains an unyielding force. With 13,906 runs to his name, he stands just 94 runs away from becoming only the third batter to breach the 14,000-run mark in ODIs. A milestone beckons, Kohli would love to etch it in Nagpur, a city where he has an average of 81.25. Kohli’s ODI prowess remains unparalleled — since 2023, he boasts the best average in the format, scoring the most centuries.For Rohit and Virat, the three ODIs, and the Champions Trophy that follows, are a battle against perception. The echoes of Edgbaston 2013 linger, but as the two stalwarts take the field once again, they seek not nostalgia — but new beginnings.","Virat kohli and rohit sharma stand at a crossroads ahead of odi series against england.

NAGPUR: Always the talking point in cricket, Nagpur pitches haven’t been short of controversies. While the pitch was rated ‘poor’ by the ICC in 2015, the Test against Australia in 2023 also saw the visitors criticising the surface. For Thursday though, a fresh, hard surface has been rolled out for the first ODI between India and England.“It seems a 300+ wicket right now, with some help to the spinners in the second half. It looks grassy now, but it might be shaved off,” said a source from VCA.Indian vice-captain Shubman Gill reckoned the wicket will dry soon. “You can never really predict how the wicket is going to play. No instructions have been given by the Indian camp regarding the pitch. I haven't seen grass being shaved off the pitch. The wicket dries here soon, so they might have kept some grass so that the surface retains moisture,” he said while addressing the media.Only one Ranji Trophy match was played on the pitch between Vidarbha and Gujarat in November 2024. Vidarbha had posted 500+ runs and the match ended in a draw.Also See: 2025 Champions Trophy","The pitch in nagpur was rated 'poor' by the icc in 2015.
