NEW DELHI: India’s pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah remains a doubtful starter for the fourth Test against England at Old Trafford, scheduled to begin on July 23 in Manchester. With India trailing 1-2 in the ongoing Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy series, Bumrah’s availability is seen as crucial—especially in light of the pre-series plan that he would feature in only three of the five matches.Having already played the first and third Tests at Leeds and Lord’s, the Indian team management now faces the decision of whether to field him in the fourth or save him for the series finale.Veteran Indian cricketer Ajinkya Rahane has suggested that left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh should step in if Bumrah is rested.""If Bumrah is not playing, Arshdeep is the guy. Because in England, you need a left-arm seamer who can swing the ball both ways, and also, with a different angle, he can create that rough for the spinners. So, if Bumrah doesn't play, Arshdeep should play the next one,"" Rahane said on his YouTube channel.Rahane also weighed in on the team’s spin options, specifically Kuldeep Yadav.""Depending on the condition of the wicket, I feel Kuldeep should play. If the wicket is similar to the last three Test matches, Kuldeep should play because you need guys who can get you those wickets. Our batting unit is doing really well. Even if you score 25-30 runs less, that's okay.But you need people who can get you those wickets. You don't want to depend on your leading fast bowlers every time.""Arshdeep, who has picked up 99 wickets in 63 T20Is, is still awaiting his Test debut. However, his participation in Manchester has been thrown into doubt due to an injury suffered during a practice session.The pacer sustained a cut when he was hit by a ball while training, prompting medical attention.""He took a ball while he was bowling there. So he hit a ball, and he tried to stop it and it's just a cut. So we have to see how bad the cut is. Obviously, the medical team have taken him off to see a doctor and obviously, if he needs stitches or does he not, that will be important to our planning for the next few days.""With just two matches left in the series, India must win both to clinch a comeback series victory.",Jasprit bumrah remains a doubtful starter for the fourth test against england at old trafford.

Training camp and podcast break mark a temporary goodbye to fans

Travis Kelce’s solo drive through Los Angeles has raised eyebrows, as girlfriend Taylor Swift remains deeply involved in helping her father recover from a serious heart surgery. The NFL star’s quiet absence during such a personal crisis has sparked speculation about cracks in their high-profile relationship.While Taylor Swift remains focused on helping her father recover from a life-altering quintuple heart bypass, Travis Kelce was seen taking a low-key evening drive through Los Angeles—marking a rare solo moment amid a deeply emotional time for both families.Scott Swift, 73, underwent the major operation more than a month ago after doctors noticed an issue during a routine checkup. “The doctor found something and everything happened so fast. But they took care of it,” a source told the Daily Mail. Fortunately, his recovery has been described as “fantastic” by someone close to the singer, and he’s been surrounded by his family throughout—including Taylor, her brother Austin, and his wife of 37 years, Andrea.Behind the scenes, Travis Kelce has proven himself to be more than just Taylor’s high-profile partner.According to insiders, the NFL star has stepped up during the family’s first major crisis together—ordering food for Taylor to make sure she was eating and personally checking in on Scott after surgery.“This was their first crisis together and Travis was doing everything right. If Taylor wasn't ready to marry him before, she sure is now. They were in love before, but now it seems unbreakable,” a source shared.In a heartwarming show of just how far he’s come with the Swift clan, Travis reportedly received the ultimate sign of family acceptance: a notification that he had been added to their family group chat.As Kelce prepares for Kansas City Chiefs training camp kicking off July 22, his availability is shifting. He and his brother Jason announced a pause on their wildly successful podcast New Heights. “We have come to the end of the road,” Jason told fans, with no set return date confirmed.While fans may miss the podcast and his usual NFL content, Kelce’s quiet moments in LA reveal a different side—one where personal devotion and love come first.Also Read: Travis Kelce’s secret wingwoman from Taylor Swift’s camp helped set their love story in motion",Travis kelce was seen taking a low-key evening drive through los angeles.

My Verdict on Marcus Smart Joining the Los Angeles Lakers

Thehave made a calculated offseason splash, signing Marcus Smart to a two-year, $11 million deal following his buyout with the Washington Wizards . The move, confirmed in July 2025, adds a seasoned defensive presence to a team in need of grit and backcourt toughness. While some fans celebrate the addition of a proven veteran, others raise questions about injuries and long-term viability.Here’s a breakdown of everything surrounding the deal—from what led to the signing to how it reshapes the Lakers’ championship aspirations.Marcus Smart had been circulating in trade talks throughout the offseason, with the Los Angeles Lakers often mentioned as a potential destination. With a pressing need for perimeter defense—especially after struggling to contain top guards in the playoffs—Los Angeles appeared ready to offer a trade package featuring players like Gabe Vincent, Jarred Vanderbilt, and future draft picks. However, Smart’s declining trade value, due to injury history and a hefty salary, pushed Washington and Smart toward a buyout agreement.Once the buyout was finalized, the Lakers moved quickly. Though the Milwaukee Bucks were also in the hunt, aggressive recruiting from Luka Doncic and the Lakers’ clear defensive need helped seal the deal.The modest salary and flexible terms make this a low-risk contract, especially when compared to what the Lakers might have given up in a trade.- Elite Perimeter Defense: A former Defensive Player of the Year and three-time All-Defensive Team selection, Smart is one of the league’s toughest defenders. He offers a skill set no current Laker can replicate.- Championship Experience: With deep playoff experience and a proven leadership presence, Smart adds another veteran voice next to LeBron James and Luka Doncic.- Locker Room Culture: Known for his vocal leadership and on-court toughness, Smart contributes to a winning mentality—something LA hopes to reinforce during its title chase.- Versatility & Toughness: His physicality and willingness to do the dirty work align perfectly with the Lakers’ need for playoff-caliber grit.- Value Signing: Signing Smart after a buyout instead of trading for him allowed the Lakers to conserve key assets while still upgrading their defense.While the upside is evident, the move does not come without baggage.- Injury History: Smart has played just 54 games over the past two seasons, a worrying trend that could limit his postseason impact.- Offensive Limitations: A career 32.3% shooter from beyond the arc, Smart doesn’t fix the Lakers’ floor-spacing issues. The team already ranks near the bottom in both attempts and efficiency from three.- Age Factor: At 31, Smart’s prime years may be behind him. Expecting him to maintain elite-level performance—especially defensively—could be ambitious.- Role Burden: With few other reliable defenders on the roster, LA risks overusing Smart, potentially increasing his chances of re-injury.- Optimism: Many Lakers fans welcomed Smart with open arms, calling him a “culture-changer” and praising his playoff pedigree. Clips of Smart’s best defensive plays trended across platforms shortly after the signing.- Cautious Hope: Others remained skeptical due to his injuries and age, drawing comparisons to previous signings of aging veterans who failed to deliver in the playoffs.- Some analysts commended the Lakers for finding a solution to their biggest weakness without giving up key assets. “The Lakers addressed their most urgent need—defensive toughness on the perimeter—while keeping their core intact,” noted original article writer in a succinct assessment.- However, critics emphasized Smart’s offensive shortcomings and injury risk. Without better shooting or backup options, the Lakers could be left exposed if Smart misses extended time.One subplot that drew attention was Luka Doncic’s active role in recruiting Smart. It signaled a shift in the Lakers’ approach—focusing on chemistry and toughness as much as star power. That alone, according to many national pundits, made this move one of the more compelling of the offseason.Marcus Smart’s arrival in Los Angeles Lakers is a strategic roll of the dice. The Lakers didn’t surrender valuable assets, and in return, they got a former Defensive Player of the Year with a chip on his shoulder. If Smart can stay healthy and accept a focused role, he could be a playoff x-factor.But if the injuries persist or his offensive liabilities hurt spacing, the Lakers may find themselves in the same position they were last spring—short on answers when it matters most.Also read: Bill Simmons Loses It in 6-Word Reaction as Celtics Icon Marcus Smart Signs Two-Year Deal with the Los Angeles Lakers In a summer of few big moves, this signing stands out not for its price tag, but for its potential to change the Lakers’ identity on both ends of the floor.","The los angeles lakers made a calculated offseason splash, signing marcus smart to a two-year, $11 million deal.

Connor McDavid’s uncertain future triggers wild speculation



Could the Maple Leafs pull off the ultimate power move?



FAQs



Is Connor McDavid a free agent now?

No, McDavid is under contract with the Oilers until the end of the 2025–26 NHL season.



Has McDavid started contract extension talks with the Oilers?

No, according to Chris Johnston, there have been no discussions about an extension yet.



Why are the Maple Leafs linked to Connor McDavid?

With Toronto's roster changes and McDavid’s Toronto roots, many believe the Leafs could make a serious push if he becomes available.



The NHL world is buzzing with speculation as Connor McDavid edges closer to the final stretch of his contract with the Edmonton Oilers. With no current negotiations in place for an extension, as confirmed by NHL insider Chris Johnston, questions are being raised about McDavid’s future, especially with the Toronto Maple Leafs circling as a potential landing spot. Could the most electrifying player in hockey reunite with his hometown roots?Connor McDavid isn’t a free agent yet. But the clock is ticking. His current deal with the Oilers runs through the end of the 2025–26 season, and in NHL terms, that’s not far off. By this point, most superstars would have already begun discussions on what could be a career-defining contract. But not McDavid. “There have been no discussions yet about an extension,” reported Johnston, a statement that has ignited serious chatter across the league.This silence from both camps has left fans in Edmonton nervous. After all, McDavid’s next contract is expected to be the most significant in NHL history—both in financial scope and franchise implications. If the Oilers fail to deliver a strong campaign next season, it could push the generational talent to explore new horizons. And there’s one destination that keeps surfacing: Toronto.Toronto Maple Leafs general manager Brad Treliving is in the middle of a massive roster shakeup.With Mitch Marner shipped off to the Vegas Golden Knights, the Leafs have created both cap flexibility and a sense of urgency to bring in a true game-changer. McDavid, a Toronto native, could be that missing piece.Treliving has already begun reinvesting wisely—signing Matias Maccelli, Dakota Joshua, Nicolas Roy, and Michael Pezzetta with funds freed from Marner’s exit. The groundwork is being laid, and the timing aligns eerily well.Add the emotional weight of McDavid having grown up in the Greater Toronto Area, and suddenly the speculation feels more like a potential script. If Edmonton stumbles again, don’t be surprised if the Leafs make a seismic play for the NHL’s brightest star.Also Read: NHL Trade Drama: Was Bowen Byram’s contract extension just a strategic move for a future trade?","Connor mcdavid is under contract with the edmonton oilers until the end of the 2025–26 nhl season.

Edmonton Oilers focus on forward depth and defensive stability



After falling short in back-to-back Stanley Cup Finals, the Edmonton Oilers are heading into the 2025-26 NHL season with one goal in mind—finishing what they started. Coach Kris Knoblauch made it clear after the loss to Florida that the team can't keep doing the same things and expect different results. This season, changes are happening.Following another tough Finals loss to the Panthers, Coach Knoblauch promised a fresh approach: “There will be changes to our system. We will be doing things a little bit differently.” That started with the forward group, which now features new names and a few surprise moves.The projected 2025-26 Oilers lineup includes star regulars like Connor McDavid Leon Draisaitl , Zach Hyman, and Ryan Nugent-Hopkins. Alongside them, new additions Andrew Mangiapane and Isaac Howard have been brought in to add fresh energy. Mangiapane, who recorded 28 points last season with Washington, will be expected to play a larger role. Isaac Howard, acquired in the Sam O’Reilly trade.Other forward names include Trent Frederic, Vasily Podkolzin, Adam Henrique, Matt Savoie, Mattias Janmark, and Kasperi Kapanen. With a mix of veterans and younger players, the team hopes to find better chemistry up front.The defense group remains mostly unchanged: Mattias Ekholm, Evan Bouchard, Darnell Nurse, Brett Kulak, Jake Walman, and TY Emberson return to the blue line.

Q3: How many goals did Sam Bennett score in the 2024 NHL Playoffs?

The Florida Panthers may have lifted the Stanley Cup for the second straight year, but the spotlight didn’t stop there. While the Cup toured across South Florida and beyond, Panthers standouts Sam Bennett and Aleksander Barkov quietly added their names to more legendary NHL trophies this summer, cementing their places in hockey history.After a dominant playoff run, Sam Bennett was honored with the Conn Smythe Trophy as the most valuable player of the 2024 Stanley Cup Playoffs. The Florida center scored 15 postseason goals—more than anyone else—and delivered when it mattered most, notching eight goals in the Panthers’ final six road games.Shortly after earning the Conn Smythe, Bennett signed a massive eight-year, $64 million contract extension to stay with Florida. It was a move that showed the team’s commitment to keeping its championship core intact and keeping Bennett’s momentum rolling.At the same time, Aleksander Barkov added two more major honors to his already impressive resume. The Panthers captain was awarded his third Selke Trophy, given to the NHL’s top defensive forward. Known for his calm presence, elite puck control, and all-around play, Barkov remains one of the most respected two-way players in the league.But it was Barkov’s impact off the ice that earned him the King Clancy Memorial Trophy. The award celebrates leadership and community work—both of which Barkov has shown in abundance. Since the 2019–20 season, he’s pledged $1,600 for every goal and $800 for every assist to Joe DiMaggio Children’s Hospital. To date, he has donated more than $400,000.When he found out about the King Clancy honor, it was the children from the hospital who delivered the news, a fitting tribute to a player who’s made such a difference in their lives.Also Read: Sidney Crosby trade rumors intensify as Canadiens and Avalanche emerge as top contenders This summer wasn’t just about lifting the Stanley Cup.

The three-time Norris Trophy winner (2012, 2015, 2023) has tallied 22 goals and 109 points over the past two seasons. Even on a middling Pittsburgh Penguins team, he’s shown he can still move the puck and drive offense at a high level.Adding Karlsson wouldn’t come without complications. His current cap hit stands at $11.5 million through 2028, a figure too large for Carolina to absorb outright. Seravalli noted that teams would only bite if the number dropped to the $7 million–$7.5 million range, meaning the Penguins would need to retain salary or involve a third party.The biggest hurdle in a Karlsson trade is financial. The Hurricanes are tight on cap space and don’t have any obvious expiring contracts on the blue line.While the front office has room to maneuver, it would take creative accounting to land a player with Karlsson’s salary, no matter how badly they want a Cup.Still, desperation can drive bold moves. The Florida Panthers have set the standard after back-to-back Stanley Cup titles and retaining key free agents this summer. If Carolina believes Karlsson is the difference-maker, they need to match that level, expect an aggressive push, especially if the Penguins are willing to meet halfway on salary.Karlsson may not be a perfect fit, but in the pursuit of a championship, perfection can be a negotiable goal.Also Read: Edmonton Oilers linked to $27m veteran Jonathan Marchessault, pressure mounts as Oilers eye scoring boost for NHL 2025-26 season","Nhl insider frank seravalli has linked carolina to pittsburgh penguins defenseman erik karlsson.

Richie James signs off at the age of 29

''It took time, but I have come to realize I am retired from the NFL. 7th round out of MTSU. I feel like I was just a ballplayer to last that long. Unfortunately, my knee never healed properly. I have been playing hurt since ‘'22.''

Richie James' NFL curve is no less than a fairytale

Also read:

There's no certain age to hang up the boots for an NFL player, but doesn't 29 look like a waste of potential? Too early an age to drop the bundle in the locker room, indeed! But Richie James, Kansas Chiefs Wide Receiver, made the call, unshaken. Remember that crazy' 184-yard mark at Green Bay? The Chad plays, that iconic kick return touchdown that set the 49ers veteran apart from any other regular left round guy, still haunts the football freaks. But Richie, the crown jewel of a relatively younger roster of the 49ers, heading towards 2025, decided to leave no ordinary footsteps behind. His magic boy era is done for good, and he lets it be remembered like this forever. No scratches, no dents.James, 29, was suffering from a stubborn knee injury from 2022, a common side effect of being under the on-field grind. But the problem in his case is that he never really healed, even after long treatment. The former Tennessee middle star still doesn't feel at his best using his knees for the plays. And that made him eventually consider a wrap. Yes, that's all about it. It's all or nothing for the Super Bowl champ.He doesn't want to compromise his performance.A single Twitter post revealed his deepest commitment as a quality player:The confession, carrying a lot of silent pain and sacrifice, didn't allow him to go for a traditional retirement celebration. It's quiet, hollow, uninvited, yet inevitable, just like his meteoric rise to the lore from a mere 7th-round pick.Dating back to the NFL draft season of 2018, a small 5 ft 10 guy from Florida made it to the San Francisco locker room as a late seventh-round pick. He has gone from rags to riches once he started to hit the field. His grit, indomitable talents didn't go unnoticed. As a rookie, he mounted for 655 yards on 35 kick returns (18.7 average) and even took one back 97 yards to the house. Add in nine catches for 130 yards and a classy touchdown. Enough to certify his class. Early.That was only the prelude to a full-blown song. Richie called it a career worth lauding. 2020 came as a crucial turning point that solidified his status as a star. That nine catches for 184 yards and a touchdown against the Packers was a remarkable feather in his cap.But things started to change afterward as injury got the better of him. After missing the season opener in 2021, Richie couldn't really get back to his form under Shanahan. He moved on with the Giants and Chiefs and won the Super Bowl LVIII. Again, a watershed moment to make people stop and stare! But who could see that was going to be the final pose of Richie with a trophy, ever! A tragic short story that could have turned into a novel but didn't. Richie James, 29, stands out, regardless, loud and proud.","Richie james, 29, announced his retirement from the nfl on twitter.

John Cena and Cody Rhodes' SummerSlam contract signing

With SummerSlam a little over two weeks away, WWE is full steam ahead. And this means, this week's Friday Night SmackDown is basically a stepping stone for the upcoming Premium Live Event. From the Frost Bank Center in San Antonio, Texas, the July 18 edition of SmackDown was already going to be an important one, as fans already knew of John Cena and Cody Rhodes coming together to sign their SummerSlam contract. Along with these two heavyweights, fans also got to feast on some exciting match cards, so let's get in with it already.The night started with a segment starring the MFTs, who had been in a car accident. SmackDown GM Adam Pearce and a few cops are seen talking to the stable where Solo Sikoa asks Pearce to get Jacob Fatu. But soon enough, the night moves towards its first fight when Charlotte Flair is seen backstage with Alexa Bliss, where the former tells the latter that she has gotten them a shot at the WWE Women’s Tag Team Titles at SummerSlam.Charlotte Flair and Raquel Rodriguez face each other inside the ring while Alexa Bliss and Roxanne Perez are standing outside. Both women seem to have a similar standing in the game, with neither being able to gain an upper hand. Perez tries to launch a sneak attack, but Bliss is there to take care of that. Finally, just when Perez thought she could create a distraction, Bliss hits Rodriguez with one of her pompoms, and Flair uses this opportunity to roll her for a pin and win.The backstage segment with the MFTs starts again, and the cops take Jacob Fatu with them in suspicion of the accident earlier. Things then turn to Carmelo Hayes and Damian Priest, who, ""Earlier Today,"" we're seen having a confrontation before a fight is announced between them.Carmelo Hayes started with a right hand into Damian Priest’s back even before the bell rang, but Priest was not one to take it quietly. He retaliated with a big foot and the tone of the night was set. At the end, Priest slams Hayes face-first into the announce desk, and just as he was about to go for an Old School, Alistair Black shows up and trips Priest.The MFTs are seen taking to the ring after the alleged car accident, where Solo Sikoa lays it on thick, blaming Jacob Fatu for what went down. But out of nowhere, Jimmy Uso and Jacob Fatu pop out from a police car, and everyone gets to know that Fatu had been cleared of all suspicion because of security footage. Fatu is inside the ring soon enough, and with Uso sneaking behind the MFTs, all hell breaks loose. Pearce is seen calling the cops when things get out of hand, and Sikoa is seen being led out by the cops for staging the earlier car crash. And the Steel Cage match between Solo Sikoa and Jacob Fatu at SummerSlam is also officially announced.Possibly for the shortest match of the night, Stephanie Vaquer faces Alba Fyre of the Secret Hervice with Piper Niven watching. They go after each other from the very beginning, but Vaquer is definitely the one with the upper hand here and soon goes for the Devil’s Kiss, and then a package backbreaker. Though Fyre manages to give the slip the first time, the second time becomes too much, and Vaquer manages to get the three count after pinning her.Piper Niven, of course, comes after Vaquer, but the latter shoves her off. And though Niven tries to go after her again, Fyre stops her. Meanwhile, the Wyatt Sicks are seen trolling the Street Profits after their loss last week, right before a four-way tag team match is set to take center stage.To determine the #1 contenders for the WWE Tag Team Championship, #DIY's Johnny Gargano and Tommaso Ciampa, Rey Fenix & Andrade tag team, Fraxiom's Nathan Frazer and Axiom, and Motor City Machine Guns' Chris Sabin & Alex Shelley take to the ring. MCMG and Fraxiom are at it when #DIY jumps them. This brings Andrade and Rey Fenix into the mix as well. It's chaos inside the ring, but what else can we expect? Lastly, fans see Andrade hitting Ciampa with The Message and taking the win.Finally, the moment everyone had been waiting for. Adam Pearce brings Cody Rhodes to the stage who right away signs the SummerSlam contract. He then asks the crowd, ""What do you want to talk about?” He talks to the crowd for a while before Pearce brings John Cena out. And it's not what anyone is expecting. Cena tells everyone that Hollywood has been draining these days, and so, he won't be at SummerSlam. Everyone is shocked, but Cena goes on to say that maybe they can have the rematch later, but he won't be signing the contract now, as he does not intend to show up at the New Jersey event. He goes to walk away, and that's when things take a turn.Fans see Rhodes charging up the ramp and attacking Cena from behind. It's a mess, as both men try to gain the edge over the other. Cena tries to use his championship belt as a weapon, but Rhodes is not having that and grabs it from his opponent, smashing Cena with it. He then climbs the top rope and does a Frog Splash, driving Cena through the announcer's table. He then grabs a pen and forces Cena to sign the SummerSlam contract. The night ends with Cody Rhodes holding on to the Undisputed Champion belt.Also Read: WWE SummerSlam 2025 just got bloodier as Solo Sikoa v Jacob Fatu 2.0 moves inside the Steel Cage","This week's friday night smackdown is basically a stepping stone for the upcoming premium live event.

Robert Griffin III’s post triggers outrage

Shaquille O’Neal threatens Robert Griffin III with a punch over Angel Reese controversy

Shaquille O’Neal attempted to defend Angel Reese with a punch, but Dan Dakich wasn’t having any of it. The OutKick host went off on the NBA legend with insults, labeling him a ""fat a**"" and ""big stupid"" while supporting Robert Griffin III. It all kicked off with a racist meme, but now it’s turned into a nasty feud packed with personal digs, old receipts, and social media drama you can’t overlook.Dan Dakich, once a college basketball coach and now a candid sportscaster for Outkick, a platform celebrated for its fearless takes. He posted an intense rant on Outkick’s Instagram, aligning with Griffin and tearing into O’Neal with a slew of insults, particularly calling him a ""fat a**."" He later added, “I mean, go back and look at shaq's history. Restraining orders, all kind of other stupid. So yes, it's shack, it's the big stupid I really wish. Rg 3 would say. Bring it big boy, bring your fat ass around here. Punch me, let's see how that works out for you.”.This is not all, he continued and said, “Sha's full shack's an insecure little baby. Shack's the kind of guy that still talks about his high school championships.You know. I got four rings. Oh good for you. Shaq, he's a useful idiot for a number of businesses across the country. Yeah, he's done nice things, but he should do nice things. Makes 50 Million a year. What are you doing?”.Straight from Dakich’s mouth, “The big stupid decided he is going to go after Robert Griffin after RG III posted a photo that depicted Angel Reese as a Monkey,” he started, as quoted in the query from Outkick’s Instagram.The drama started when Robert Griffin III, who used to be an NFL quarterback and is now a media figure, tweeted about Angel Reese, a rising talent in women’s basketball for the Chicago Sky. On X, Griffin posted a photo of Reese depicted as a monkey and claimed that people close to her mentioned she ""hates"" Caitlin Clark, a fellow standout with the Indiana Fever.The monkey imagery wasn’t just a random shot; it’s a racist stereotype with a nasty history when aimed at Black athletes, which made Griffin’s post immediately controversial. His assertion about Reese and Clark only intensified the situation, playing into a rivalry narrative between the two players that fans and media have been blowing out of proportion.Shaquille O’Neal has been mentoring Reese since her college days at LSU, where he also played. While on the Off The Record podcast, O’Neal made a bold threat towards Griffin. “RG3, tweet one more monkey post about my girl Angel Reese, and I’m punching you in the f**king face,” he said at the 23:49 mark of the episode.“Enough’s enough. I don’t usually speak up like this, but seriously, stop it.

In all of the 82 games played in the 2024 NHL season, there were only 38 wins, 32 losses, and 12 overtime losses for the Pittsburgh Penguins. These numbers are heavy. Heavy for the team members. For the front offices. And for their captain–Sidney Crosby.When the fans and the media are finding it cumbersome to separate Crosby from his parent team, there’s one NHL Insider who thinks otherwise. Chris Johnston openly talked about the Canadian professional ice hockey center on the SDPN (The Steve Dangle Podcast) podcast–a tiny excerpt? “The idea that even having a discussion is disrespectful to Sidney Crosby? I think that’s misplaced.”NHL Insider, Chris Johnston, pointed out that everyone in the NHL is having a discussion about Crosby’s continuance with the Penguins or a trade to a different NHL team. Penguins are thinking. Every other NHL team that wants a stellar player like Crosby is thinking. “People get offended–like with the whole Crosby thing. We had a full conversation about it last week. The idea that even having a discussion is disrespectful to Sidney Crosby? I think that’s misplaced.Johnston continued, “I can tell you, every single person in hockey is having discussions. It’s the absolute elephant in the room. It would be naive to think that Kyle Dubas and the Penguins’ front office haven’t thought about it. And the same goes for other front offices, too. Especially for those who might want Crosby on their roster. Everyone is thinking about this–his representatives, his family, his childhood team, the teams that just suffered devastating playoff losses. It is happening at the highest levels.”The NHL insider later provided a hint as to who would make the final decision. And that was none other than Sidney Crosby himself. “We know who makes that decision and why. Because he wants to be in Pittsburgh, but the minute that changes, he’ll no longer be a Penguin.”When a co-host of the SDPN podcast asked Chris Johnston why the Penguins captain hadn’t addressed these buzzworthy trade rumors, the Insider said, “That’s cause he’s only going to speak publicly better at once–when it happens.”20 years–from the 2005 NHL season till now.
