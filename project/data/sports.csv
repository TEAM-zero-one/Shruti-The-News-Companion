It also underscores the emotional challenges athletes face when roster decisions upend carefully laid career plans.In steering the team through this delicate phase, head coach Mike McDaniel has approached the situation with measured precision and deep empathy. Recognizing the strong bonds that have formed within the team, McDaniel‚Äôs handling of the quarterback competition aims to blend tactical necessity with human understanding.

Giannis Antetokounmpo could not save Game 5 for the Milwaukee Bucks



The Indiana Pacers lead the playoff series 4-1



The Milwaukee Bucks are far from catching a break as Giannis Antetokounmpo and company faced another devastating defeat against the Indiana Pacers by one point at the Gainbridge Fieldhouse in Indianapolis.

Brook Lopez, surprisingly quiet, went scoreless from the field in under eight minutes.

Details



LeBron‚Äôs Player Option



LeBron James holds a $52.6M option for 2025-26. If he opts in, he can veto any trade due to his no-trade clause.

A Father's Pride: How RR, Dravid & Vikram Shaped Vaibhav Suryavanshi

More Vaibhavs in the pipeline

On a cold January night in 2024, Ashutosh Aman saw Vaibhav Suryavanshi shadow practicing in a hotel gallery in Patna. Ashutosh, who was the captain of Bihar, enquired, ""(Have you eaten?)."" A stunned 12-year-old fumbled and replied, ""(I don't feel like eating)."" Ashutosh instructed him to wear a jacket and cap and took him out for dinner. On the dinner table, a confused Vaibhav asked, ""(Brother, I am not able to understand the menu, just order mutton and rice for me).""The next day, Vaibhav made his Ranji Trophy debut against Mumbai. On Day 2, when Vaibhav was padding up to open, he was struggling to lace his shoes. Ashutosh again came to his rescue and asked, ""(Don't you know how to lace your shoes?)."" Vaibhav just nodded.""Those four days I was very nervous. When I saw him at the nets, I wanted him to play. Even the selectors and Bihar Cricket Association (BCA) officials wanted to blood him. I was worried. What if he got hurt? How would he deal with the pressure? He scored 19 in the first innings against Mumbai, and I nonchalantly said in the dressing room, '(Bihar has got its first cricketing superstar),"" recalls Aman.Ashutosh was right about his prophecy. On Monday, Suryavanshi smashed the quickest ton by an Indian in the IPL, and made Rahul Dravid forget that he was on a wheelchair. The entire Sawai Mansingh Stadium chanted the name of the 14-year-old.(Exceptional knock),"" was Ashutosh's crisp reply on the knock.In 2000, when Jharkhand was carved out from Bihar, a Bhojpuri song titled ""(Now Jharkhand is separate, eat sweet potato),"" became an instant hit in salons, in buses, and even at weddings. The song was a taunt that with Jharkhand taking all the mineral resources and industries, Bihar was only left with sweet potato.A wave of migration began as millions left the state for better opportunities. Even Ashutosh, like the many who went searching for better education and jobs, left Bihar last year for a coaching gig with Services. Cricketing infrastructure was, and still is, a mess but the sight of Vaibhav hitting those towering sixes on Monday night made Ashutosh, a left-arm spinner, very emotional.""There was no cricket in Bihar , and those who had tried their hand at cricket were left unemployed. Let's not even talk about the infrastructure,"" says Aman.""When I saw Vaibhav hitting those sixes yesterday, I got emotional. He will be for Bihar what MS Dhoni is for Jharkhand. Vaibhav has put Bihar on the cricketing landscape. People now know about Samastipur . One thing that is in Bihari DNA is that we don't fear because we have got nothing to lose. He started his IPL career by hitting a six off Shardul Thakur and then completed his century with a six off Rashid Khan,"" said Aman, who has played 34 first-class matches.The list of cricketers from Bihar shifting trade elsewhere doesn't end there. Ishan Kishan went to Ranchi from Patna because his father is a businessman. Pacer Mukesh Kumar moved to Kolkata in 2012 to help his father‚Äôs taxi business, which was suffering losses. He used to play cricket in Kolkata's maidan for Rs 400-500 before he was spotted by Ranadeb Bose, former Bengal pacer and bowling coach.Another Indian pacer, Akash Deep, had a similar story. He went to Kolkata to become a truck driver and ended up playing cricket. He has now opened a cricket academy in Sasaram. ""The sole reason for building that academy was so that no kid should face the hurdles I had to endure when I was young. They don't have to leave Bihar to go to other states to get good facilities. I will provide them with world-class infrastructure,"" he told TimesofIndia.com before the start of the IPL.The BCA president, Rakesh Tiwary, who saw the knock from the stands on Monday, couldn't believe what he had witnessed.""The crowd was chanting 'Vaibhav! Vaibhav!', and it is still giving me goosebumps. It was an experience of a lifetime for sure,"" said Tiwari.Tiwari is confident that more Vaibhavs will come through from the state.""You will see more talented cricketers coming out of Bihar now. There is no dearth of talent.""""We are working on the infrastructure. The BCA has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the state government, which grants BCA a 30-year lease on the Moin-ul-Haq Stadium , which sets the stage for the redevelopment of the stadium, poised to transform it into a state-of-the-art, international-standard sporting complex. There is another stadium that we are building in Rajgir. There are more smaller centers across the state that are in the pipeline,"" he said.","Vaibhav suryavanshi smashed the quickest ton by an indian in the ipl.

Poll What do you think about Vaibhav Suryavanshi becoming the youngest centurion in men‚Äôs Twenty20 cricket? I don't follow cricket. Just a lucky game. Impressive for his age. A remarkable achievement!

On Monday evening, when Vaibhav Suryavanshi was hitting sixes with such ease at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium in Jaipur, 1177 km away in Bihar's Samastipur district, the Suryavanshi household was surrounded by well-wishers.

We are absolutely thrilled with his knock. There is a festive atmosphere in our house,"" he adds.In his brief career, Vaibhav has been fortunate to work with VVS Laxman at the National Cricket Academy (NCA) and Rahul Dravid at the Rajasthan Royals.

And now Rahul Dravid sir has taken him under his wing,"" says Vaibhav's coach Manish Ojha.Suryavanshi grabbed headlines when he became the youngest player to earn a contract in the lucrative IPL at the age of 13 and father Sanjeev credits the Royals management for his son's significant growth as a batter.""Yes, he has worked hard, but credit must go to the Rajasthan Royals team management. For the past three to four months, Rahul Dravid, Vikram Rathour , and Zubin Bharucha have worked on his game, and now he is reaping the rewards,"" he explains.Rajasthan Royals batting coach Vikram Rathour has called Vaibhav a special talent and has showered praise on his technique.""He's a special, special talent. Technically, he has a great downswing, which helps him generate that kind of power. Today, he showed everyone exactly how good he is. Honestly, you could keep talking about that knock endlessly,"" Rathour told reporters after the match.""For a 14-year-old kid to play like that ‚Äî that itself is special. We first saw him around four months ago during the trials, and from that moment, we knew we had found something extraordinary. It was up to us to nurture him and bring him to this level.

Jimmy Butler has yet to fully recover from his aching tailbone but went against all odds to help the Golden State Warriors secure another crucial win against the Houston Rockets in Game 4 of the first round of the NBA playoffs. The team clinched a narrow 109‚Äì106 victory, with a clearly uncomfortable Butler giving his all to secure a final rebound despite the injury.The Golden State Warriors now lead the first-round series 3‚Äì1 and are on the brink of advancing to the Western Conference semifinals. During the post-game press conference, Butler was asked to explain the final rebound he grabbed for the team. Responding to the reporter, Butler said, ‚ÄúI saw that I wasn't battling with Stephen Adams the last play. So I was able to go up there and be a semi-athlete, but I wanted to rebound. I told Dray (Draymond Green), if you get a stop. I will get the rebound and he got the stop and I got the rebound.‚ÄùFans were highly impressed with Curry‚Äôs execution and leadership on the court.
