Kim Meylemans and Nicole Silveira on their Olympic rivalry



Valentine’s Day is in the air, but it will look different for Kim Meylemans and Nicole Rocha Silveira. Instead of dinner plans, the married couple will hurtle headfirst down an icy track, chasing Olympic medals for different countries. At the 2026 Milan Cortina Winter Olympics, Belgium’s Meylemans and Brazil’s Silveira are competing in the women’s skeleton event, lining up against each other less than a year after their wedding.After the first two heats, Meylemans sits eighth, 0.84 seconds off the lead. Silveira stands 12th, 1.30 seconds back. Austria’s Janine Flock leads heading into the final two heats, scheduled for Saturday.A year after marriage, skeleton stars Kim Meylemans and Nicole Silveira meet in Olympic showdown. However, this is not their first Olympic meeting. At the 2022 Beijing Games, Rocha Silveira finished 13th and Kim Meylemans 18th. Meylemans also competed at the 2018 PyeongChang Olympics. Since then, both athletes have grown on the World Cup circuit.Meylemans recently secured Belgium’s first overall women’s skeleton World Cup title after medaling in six of seven events this season. Silveira delivered Brazil’s best ever Olympic sliding result in 2022 and later earned two World Cup bronze medals during the 2024 to 2025 campaign.They met on the Skeleton World Cup tour in 2019. In 2021, they shared their relationship publicly. Silveira proposed in Brazil in 2024, and they married in Calgary in January 2025, where they now live and train.Both athletes describe competition as intense yet grounded in partnership. Meylemans acknowledged her wife’s role in her success.“This team right here is something truly special though and a big part of this success, I wouldn’t have achieved this goal without them, especially my wife,” Meylemans wrote in an Instagram post. “Don’t think anyone truly understands how much I needed her with me (pushing & supporting me) to achieve this.”Silveira also shared her thoughts. “Proud to be your wife and to walk this walk next to you,” she commented.Sharing the Olympic stage as rivals is a different experience altogether. “It’s very special to be able to share Olympic Games with your partner,” Silveira said. “It’s an extremely stressful, high-pressure period, so to have my person there as a comfort and safe space is of immense value to me, and also my performance. It brings a sense of calmness and normality into the [craziest] weeks of our career.”The couple, however, has a clear Olympic goal. “At the end of the day, we're working as a team, so if one of us is on the podium, in our small situation then that's great for us,” Meylemans told Olympics.com last year.Catch their Olympic journey on NBC, Peacock, and NBCOlympics.com, with the third heat at 12 p.m. ET Saturday and the final at 1:35 p.m. ET.","Kim meylemans and nicole rocha silveira are competing in the women's skeleton at the 2026 milan cortina winter olympics.

My Opinion On This Mock Trade

Trade discussion has picked up around the Los Angeles Dodgers as the 2026 season approaches, with reports connecting the club to Cincinnati Reds starter Hunter Greene. The idea of a deal involving Roki Sasaki has drawn attention because it would affect the direction of both pitching staffs.The Dodgers are preparing to use a six-man rotation again, while the Reds are trying to build on an 83-79 finish that earned them a Wild Card spot in 2025. There is no confirmation that the teams are negotiating, but Greene’s name has appeared often in offseason speculation.FanSided’s Christopher Kline suggested a scenario in which Los Angeles sends Sasaki, who is under rookie control through 2030, to Cincinnati for Greene. The proposal could also include prospects from the Dodgers’ farm system. Greene remains under team control as well, with the Reds holding a $21 million option for the 2029 season that would keep him with the club through age 29.Greene has said trade rumors have not bothered him, but his contract status and performance make him one of Cincinnati’s most valuable players.Los Angeles Dodgers enter 2026 after a strong postseason showing.Dodgers starters combined for a 1.54 ERA across eight playoff games, the second-lowest mark for teams that played at least eight games.Yoshinobu Yamamoto and Blake Snell are expected to remain central to the rotation. Sasaki had uneven results as a starter, posting a 4.72 ERA with 22 walks in 34.1 innings. He improved late in the season after adjusting his mechanics while pitching in relief and is projected to return to a starting role. Still, the Dodgers have enough depth to consider moving him.Hunter Greene, 26, led Cincinnati’s rotation in 2025. He recorded a 2.76 ERA over 107.2 innings and struck out 31.4 percent of hitters. His fastball is the foundation of his approach, and opponents averaged a 90.4 mph exit velocity against him. Greene is from California, which could make a move to Los Angeles a comfortable transition.The Reds finished with a 3.86 team ERA, with Greene standing out as the staff’s most consistent pitcher.Hunter Greene would give Los Angeles another established starter to slot alongside Yamamoto and Snell. His production, age, and control through 2029 would help the club manage payroll while keeping the rotation stable. Moving Sasaki could also reduce concerns tied to his walk rate while bringing in a pitcher with a longer track record.Cincinnati Reds would receive a 24-year-old pitcher with high-end velocity and several years of team control. Sasaki’s late-season relief work showed progress and suggests room for growth. Adding him could strengthen a young core without forcing the Reds out of contention.Clear rotation upgrade with Greene’s 2.76 ERA compared to Sasaki’s 4.72; controlled starter who fits a team focused on competing now.Loss of Sasaki’s long-term upside and possible prospect depth.Younger pitcher under control for more seasons who could develop into a frontline arm.Departure of the starter who helped drive an 83-win season and uncertainty about Sasaki’s adjustment to a full MLB workload.Also read: MLB trade rumors: Toronto Blue Jays target $4.26 million St. Louis Cardinals relief pitcher after Missing Out on Bo Bichette and Kyle Tucker The deal would represent a swap between present reliability and future potential. The Dodgers would add a proven starter as they pursue another title, while the Reds would bet on Sasaki’s development. Los Angeles appears better positioned to absorb the risk, but the outcome would depend on how both pitchers perform after the move.","Roki sasaki is under rookie control through 2030.

The end of a player’s time with a team is often measured in numbers, but for Chris Bassitt, his Toronto chapter will be remembered for something far more meaningful. As the veteran right hander officially begins a new journey in the American League East, the Toronto Blue Jays chose to highlight his impact beyond baseball. Before fans focused on contracts or roster changes, the organization made sure to recognize the difference he made in the community.Over three seasons, Bassitt and his wife Jessica committed themselves to Jays Care initiatives that support youth through sport and mentorship. Their Pitch-In initiative became a steady source of funding for programs aimed at helping children grow through baseball. The impact was not symbolic. It was financial, consistent, and deeply personal.“Thank you to Chris and Jessica Bassitt for their incredible support of Jays Care over the past three seasons. 💙 Through the Bassitts Pitch-In initiative, the Bassitt family generously donated over $500,000 CAD to kids in Jays Care programs and made an immeasurable impact on our community. We’re deeply grateful and wish you all the best in your next chapter!”That message captured why Bassitt’s departure carries emotional weight.His $500,000 CAD donation will continue supporting children across Canada, ensuring his influence remains long after his final outing in Toronto.Now, Bassitt turns the page with the Baltimore Orioles, staying in the competitive AL East. His move keeps him in a division he knows well, but in a new uniform and role.Last season, Bassitt went 11 9 with a 3.96 ERA across 32 regular season appearances as Toronto claimed the American League pennant. During the postseason, he stepped into a relief role and posted a 1.04 ERA with 10 strikeouts in seven outings. His flexibility and steady presence proved valuable in high pressure moments.Entering his 11th major league season, Bassitt will turn 37 on Feb. 22. Throughout his career with the Chicago White Sox, Oakland Athletics, New York Mets, and Toronto, he has compiled an 83 65 record with a 3.64 ERA. For Baltimore, he adds experience and stability. For Toronto, he leaves a lasting legacy that extends far beyond the mound.","Blue jays thank chris bassitt for $500k commitment to jays care programs.

NEW DELHI: India and Pakistan will train at different times ahead of their big T20 World Cup match on Sunday in Colombo.

Tilak Varma has performed well against Pakistan in the latest Asia Cup final and will try to continue that success.Since Sri Lanka’s pitches usually help spinners, Varun Chakravarthy could be an important bowler for India in this match.","India and pakistan will train at different times ahead of their big t20 world cup match on sunday.

Inside ESPN’s ‘Year of the Super Bowl’ campaign and how it works

Why Disney is pushing ‘We’re Going’ and what brands get out of a year-round Super Bowl

ESPN is not treating its first Super Bowl broadcast as a one-night job. The network, in partnership with the NFL and The Walt Disney Co., has rolled out “The Year of the Super Bowl,” a 12-month campaign that started right after Super Bowl 60 and runs through Super Bowl 61 on Feb. 14, 2027, on ESPN and ABC.The push is one of the biggest cross-company projects in ESPN and Disney history, with coordinated programming, park activations and ad inventory built around a single game. It also raises the obvious question: can fans stay locked in on the Super Bowl for an entire year without burning out on the branding?The campaign officially kicked off with “The Handoff,” a made-for-TV bridge from this year’s Super Bowl to next year’s. Chris Berman appeared from Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, the site of Super Bowl 60, and passed coverage to Scott Van Pelt at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, where Super Bowl 61 will be played.ESPN then turned the moment into a 24-hour activation. Shows like “SportsCenter,” “Super Bowl Live,” “First Take” and “NFL Live” moved to Disneyland Park in Anaheim, tying NFL coverage directly to Disney’s theme-park machine.“With the full strength of The Walt Disney Company and in collaboration with the NFL, ESPN has embarked on a year-long Super Bowl celebration,” ESPN chairman Jimmy Pitaro said.“This fan-focused initiative unites our Company’s beloved brands with industry-leading storytelling and technology to showcase football’s greatest stories, heroes, and moments like never before.”Content is the backbone of the plan. ESPN has launched “I Scored a Touchdown,” a weekly short-form series that will highlight 61 players who have scored in the Super Bowl before the 2027 game kicks off. Former New York Giants wide receiver David Tyree, remembered for his helmet catch in Super Bowl XLII, led things off.There is also “The Biggest Game,” a weekly video podcast hosted by Jeremy Schaap. The show looks back at six decades of Super Bowl moments, from on-field performances to halftime shows and the off-field storylines that usually spill into the news cycle. The first episode features Berman, who has covered 44 straight Super Bowls.To sell the scale of the project beyond hardcore NFL fans, Disney and ESPN built a separate marketing play: “We’re Going.” The spot reimagines the “I’m going to Disney World” line that Super Bowl champions made famous, this time packing in Disney characters, ESPN faces and ABC personalities all heading to Super Bowl 61.“Few phrases are as instantly recognizable in sports as ‘I’m going to Disney World,’” Asad Ayaz, chief marketing and brand officer of The Walt Disney Co., said. “This campaign brings together the scale of ESPN, the global power of Disney’s brands and characters, and the excitement of the Super Bowl to create a shared moment that signals just how big this milestone is for our company and fans.”“‘We’re Going’” sits on top of a bigger ad play. Disney Advertising plans cross-platform opportunities across ESPN, ABC and other company properties, giving brands a shot at tying into the Super Bowl build-up months before kickoff instead of fighting for 30 seconds in the game.“‘We’re Going’ is just the beginning of a year-long adventure to our first Super Bowl,” Tina Thornton, ESPN’s executive vice president of creative studio and marketing, said. “It sets the tone for how we’re approaching Super Bowl LXI, by bringing together the storytelling power of Disney with the scale, voice, and passion of ESPN.”Over the 2026-27 NFL season, fans can expect more programming, in-park events and NFL tentpole integrations around the draft and Monday Night Football. ESPN, Disney and the NFL are betting that “The Year of the Super Bowl” can keep fans engaged for 12 months and still have something left for kickoff in Los Angeles.","Espn, disney and the nfl are using “the year of the super bowl” to stretch one game into a 12-month content and marketing machine.

Matt Weston and Alex Howard-Jones plan their wedding after Milano Cortina Winter Olympics 2026



British skeleton racer Matt Weston is on the verge of winning Great Britain’s first medal of the 2026 Winter Olympics. The 28-year-old has made a strong start in Milano Cortina and leads the standings after the opening two runs. He holds a 0.30-second advantage heading into the final runs on Friday evening. Expectations were high because he arrived as the reigning world, European and overall World Cup champion, and he has so far matched the hype.Away from the ice track, Weston is also enjoying a big year in his personal life. He is engaged to his long-time partner Alex Howard-Jones, and the couple plan to marry in July after the Games. Their relationship has been visible on social media for years, with photos together dating back to 2016. They also share their home with a ten-year-old cocker spaniel named Logan.While Matt Weston chases Milano Cortina Winter Olympics 2026 success, his fiancée Alex Howard-Jones has built her own career. She is a chief operating officer (COO) and a founding member of pltfrm search, an executive search firm based in London. Reportedly, the couple plans to celebrate their wedding just months after the conclusion of the Winter Olympics, meaning 2026 could become the biggest year of Weston’s life both professionally and personally.Notably, Matt Weston did not begin his sporting journey in skeleton racing. He first played rugby and later trained in taekwondo. Many people expected that he would become one of Britain’s top winter athletes. He only started skeleton racing in the summer of 2017 and made his World Cup debut in January 2020.His rise was quick. In 2021, Weston won a World Cup gold medal. It was the first time a British man had done so in more than 13 years. He then became Britain’s first skeleton world champion in eight years in 2023. The last British champion before that was Lizzie Yarnold back in 2015, while Kristan Bromley was the last British male champion in 2008.Last season proved his most successful yet. Weston secured back-to-back overall World Cup titles and also reclaimed his world championship. That form made him one of the favourites for the Milano-Cortina Games.","British skeleton racer matt weston is on the verge of winning great britain’s first medal of the 2026 winter olympics.

2018: Chloe Kim turns PyeongChang into a launchpad

2022: Beijing cements the back to back halfpipe champion

Where Chloe Kim sits now in snowboarding history

On a snowy night in Livigno, Italy, Chloe Kim led the women’s halfpipe final after an 88.00 opener, then watched 17 year old Gaon Choi snatch gold with a 90.25 on her last run. Kim fell on her own final attempt and settled for silver at the 2026 Winter Olympics.This was the shot at a once in a lifetime headline: the first three straight Olympic golds in any snowboarding event. Instead, Kim walks away with three Olympic medals total, two gold and one silver, and remains the only woman with back to back halfpipe titles while Shaun White still stands as the only rider with three golds overall.A month before Milan Cortina, Kim tore the labrum in her left shoulder during training in Switzerland and admitted she was unsure she would even make it to the Games.She still qualified first, then played it safe on her opening run in Livigno, banking that 88.00 while other riders slammed in heavy snow. Choi crashed hard in her first run, needed treatment in the pipe, then came back to land the run of the night and grab gold on her third attempt.Kim had a choice on that last drop: repeat the cleaner, safer first run or throw the hardest combo on her sheet, including the cab double 1080 that has defined her progression.She chose violence. She caught the wall, slid out, and the three peat vanished.Even then, she refused to mope. “In my eyes, I’m a winner, because I was able to persevere and fight through,” she told reporters, per Time. On the way down the hill she walked hand in hand with boyfriend Myles Garrett of the Cleveland Browns, who called watching her ride “exciting but terrifying.”She is expected to undergo shoulder surgery once she is back in the United States.Kim did not arrive in PyeongChang as a mystery. She already had X Games golds and had become the first woman to land back to back 1080s in competition.At 17, she turned that hype into something concrete, winning women’s halfpipe gold with a 93.75, then nearly touching perfection with a 98.25 on her final run. She became the youngest woman to win Olympic snowboarding gold and the youngest to land two 1080s in a row at the Games, jumping past Kelly Clark’s age record in the process.Four years later in Beijing, Kim arrived with fame, pressure, and time away from the sport behind her. She qualified first, then ended the final early with a 94.00 on her opening run in Genting Snow Park.Her last two attempts turned into lab experiments.

But the bigger picture is ugly for everyone else: even on a torn shoulder, even on a night when a teenager finally beat her, the bar in this sport still has Kim’s name on it.","Chloe kim fell on her final run in the women's halfpipe final in milan cortina.

Johannes Høsflot Klæbo moves level with Winter Olympics legends after dominant 10km freestyle victory

Norway’s Johannes Høsflot Klæbo added another huge moment to his already legendary career after winning the men’s 10km freestyle race at the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milano-Cortina. The victory gave him his eighth Olympic gold medal, tying the all-time Winter Olympics record. Klæbo finished 4.9 seconds ahead of France’s Mathis Desloges, showing once again why he is one of the biggest stars in cross-country skiing right now.It was also his third gold medal at these Games, making him one of the standout athletes of the tournament so far. His win quickly became one of the most talked-about moments of the day. Fans have watched him dominate event after event, and many now wonder if he will go on to break the record before these Olympics end. With more races still ahead, the Norwegian skier has a real chance to make even more history in Milan.Johannes Høsflot Klæbo’s latest win added another chapter to a career that has already been packed with success.Before Milano-Cortina, he had won gold medals at the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang and again at the 2022 Games in Beijing.His titles include victories in the individual sprint, team sprint, and relay events, making him one of the most complete skiers in the sport.Now tied on eight gold medals with Norwegian greats Bjørn Dæhlie, Marit Bjørgen, and Ole Einar Bjørndalen, Klæbo has placed himself among the biggest names in Winter Olympics history.More importantly, he still has three races left at these Games: the relay, team sprint, and 50km mass start, meaning the record could soon belong to him alone.Klæbo’s performances have also caught the attention of fans beyond the skiing world. A video of his uphill sprint from earlier in the Games went viral online, gaining over 15 million views on X.American skier Ben Ogden, who finished behind him in the sprint race, summed up the challenge of racing against the Norwegian by saying, “I like to go to every race thinking that it’s a race for the win, but these days, a lot of the time it’s a race for second.”With the final week of competition still ahead, all eyes are now on Klæbo to see how much further he can push his Olympic legacy.","Johannes høsflot klæbo won the men’s 10km freestyle race at the 2026 winter olympics in milano-cortina.

Slovakia will be facing Sweden in its last preliminary fixture



Slovakia is making believers out of everyone in Milan. After shocking the hockey world with a 4-1 dismantling of defending Olympic champion Finland in their opener, Slovakia held off a spirited Italian side 3-2 at Rho Arena on Friday to remain perfect in Group B.It was not the blowout many expected, but captain Tomas Tatar and his teammates found a way to secure the victory. Italy, playing in front of a passionate home crowd, refused to go quietly against Slovakia; they pushed even harder in today’s game.Slovakia has been the biggest dark horse so far. Despite lacking any of the firepower of the “Big 4 Nations,” they have thrilled fans and critics alike. Meanwhile, the hosts had already proven against Sweden that they could compete with elite competition, trailing just 2-2 in the second period before eventually falling 5-2.The 35-year-old Tatar, who spent 14 NHL seasons with six different teams, has been instrumental in Slovakia's success. He recorded 496 points across 927 regular-season games at the highest level before returning to Europe this season with Zug in Switzerland's National League.His leadership on Slovakia's top line alongside Juraj Slafkovsky and Adam Ruzicka has given the Slovaks one of the tournament's most dangerous units.Slafkovsky, the 2022 Olympic MVP, already has nine career Olympic goals at just 21 years old, trailing only Marian Hossa and Miroslav Satan on Slovakia's all-time list.Despite the loss, Italy has earned respect throughout the tournament. With zero NHL experience on their roster, they have competed hard against Sweden and Slovakia, two teams loaded with professional talent.The host nation has shown they belong at this level, even if the results have not gone their way. Their supporters at Rho Arena created an electric atmosphere that nearly willed them to an upset. Slovakia sits atop Group B at 2-0-0-0 following their narrow victory.Finland has already bounced back from their opening loss with a 4-1 win over Sweden in Friday's other Group B action, leaving the group wide open heading into the final round of preliminary games.

Jannik Sinner applauds Federica Brignone’s comeback as Italian skier wins Super-G gold at Milano-Cortina Winter Olympics

Italian tennis star Jannik Sinner shared heartfelt words for fellow Italian athlete Federica Brignone after her inspiring gold medal win at the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milano-Cortina. Brignone, who suffered a serious leg injury less than a year ago, returned to competition and claimed gold in the Super-G event. Her victory quickly became one of the biggest stories of the Games, not just because of the medal, but because of the difficult journey she went through to get back on the slopes.The 35-year-old skier had broken her left leg during the Italian championships and needed two major surgeries. Many people believed she might miss the Olympics completely. Instead, she returned in remarkable fashion and even set a new milestone by becoming the oldest Alpine skier to win Olympic gold. After the race, Sinner openly admired her determination and praised her effort in a moving reaction.Jannik Sinner spoke about Brignone’s achievement in an interview with La Gazzetta dello Sport, calling her comeback extraordinary.He said, “She’s a phenomenon. After everything she’s been through, being able to come back and achieve this result is something extraordinary.”Sinner had earlier spoken about how difficult injury recovery can be, especially in a sport like skiing. During the Australian Open, he explained that skiing carries huge risks and long recovery periods.He said, “Skiing and tennis are totally different sports because on the slopes, if you get hurt during the season, you’re out all year. It’s a really dangerous sport; when you step out of the gate, you have to be brave.”He also praised Brignone’s hard work behind the scenes, adding, “What Federica has done… to be able to experience the Olympics is incredible… she’s done something incredible that almost no one can do.”While Brignone celebrates her historic win, Sinner is now turning his attention back to tennis. The Italian started his 2026 season at the Australian Open but lost in the semifinals to Novak Djokovic.He is expected to return to action at the Qatar Open in Doha, where rival Carlos Alcaraz is also set to compete. Djokovic, however, has withdrawn from the tournament.Brignone’s victory and Sinner’s reaction have brought together two major Italian sports stories, showing how athletes from different fields often inspire each other during big moments like the Winter Olympics.",Federica brignone won gold in the super-g event at the 2026 winter olympics in milano-cortina.

This is such a special opportunity, and still feels pretty surreal to be here and be able to compete and put on this jersey and play with this group of guys. It’s a great start for us in this tournament, and we’ll look to build off it.”Matthews further spoke about the early adversities the team faced at the initial stage, “It’s fine. Those things happen all the time. You know, can’t really complain about it. The ref maybe didn’t see it. Was a little shaken up, but felt fine and just kept playing and just go from there,” he said.As per reports, Brady Tkachuk scored first at 5:29 in the first period with help from his brother Matthew. In the second period, Team USA took control as the team got three goals from Brock Nelson and Tage Thompson.

Chris Paul’s rise from rookie of the year to perennial All-Star

Chris Paul's retirement marks the end of a historic statistical legacy

Chris Paul, one of the best and most respected point guards in NBA history, has officially called it quits after 21 seasons in the NBA. Confirming the end of his storied career, the 40-year-old made the announcement in an emotional statement. Paul embodied elite leadership, precise playmaking, and fierce competitiveness over the next two-plus decades, cementing a legacy as one of the greatest floor generals in the history of the sport.Paul has been a consistent Hall of Fame-level talent since back when he was a teenage legend. The retirement closes the book on a career that spanned three eras of the NBA and signals the end of one of the most impactful careers the league has seen.Chris Paul was the fourth overall pick in the 2005 NBA Draft, selected by the then-New Orleans Hornets; he quickly became a franchise player. Winning the NBA Rookie of the Year award in 2006, he was soon distinguished by his nearly unparalleled awareness on the court, his ball handling, and his defensive acumen.During his career, Paul was named to 12 NBA All-Star selections, received 11 All-NBA honors, and nine consecutive All-Defensive Team nods.His leadership made several franchises better, and most famously, he led the Los Angeles Clippers to heights they had never reached before, guiding the “Lob City” era and making the team a regular playoff team.Aside from his stint with the Clippers, Paul played a pivotal role for the Houston Rockets, Oklahoma City Thunder, Phoenix Suns, Golden State Warriors, and San Antonio Spurs. He took the Suns to the 2021 NBA Finals, two wins short of clinching the elusive title that eluded him during his Phoenix playing days.Chris Paul's retirement was swift, but it ended a career filled with records and consistent greatness. He's 2nd all-time assists and steals 2nd respectively, arguing his position as the greatest playmaker and best perimeter defender of all-time. Reinforcing his blend of scoring and distribution, Paul has scored more than 20,000 points while recording over 10,000 assists.Paul should have a room full of those fine letters, but no NBA title ever be displayed, crowning his résumé. He was president of the National Basketball Players Association, a trusty mentor to younger stars, and an embodiment of professionalism and basketball smarts.","Chris paul has announced his retirement after 21 seasons in the nba.

Team Canada will play without two key players as they are all set to lock horns against Team Switzerland in their upcoming men's ice hockey action at the 2026 Winter Olympics, scheduled for Friday. The news has been confirmed recently by the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) ahead of their clash against the opponent team.The decision came as Josh Morrissey sustained an undisclosed injury recently during Canada’s opening match against Czechia. While Brad Marchand’s reason for exclusion is unknown at this time. The 37-year-old had one assist in 9:29 of play in Canada’s bottom-six in his first Olympic appearance, according to reports.Earlier, Canada kicked off its Olympic campaign in Group A with a 5-0 win over Czechia, where 19-year-old Macklin Celebrini opened the score for the team on 12 February, as reported by Olympics.com. Meanwhile, Czechia also gave a tough fight to the mighty Canadians. Team Canada will play on February 13, 2026, without two key players due to injury and other unfortunate circumstances. These key players are Brad Marchand and Josh Morrissey, who are considered the marquee players of the team.Their absence from today’s lineup was confirmed by IIHF. However, Team Canada will replace these players with two other significant players.According to Daily Faceoff, Josh Morrissey will miss the match, as he was last seen leaving Canada’s tournament opener on Thursday against Czechia after sustaining an injury. At present, the status of Morrissey’s injury is unclear, but if he is unable to return, his roster spot will be difficult to replace after Canada officially registered 25 players on February 10.Announcing the same on X/Twitter, Steven Ellis stated, “Both Brad Marchand and Josh Morrissey are listed as scratches for Canada today against Switzerland. Jordan Binnington also went dress. #Olympics.”As per reports, in place of these players, Carolina’s Seth Jarvis will make his Olympic debut. He will play alongside Bo Horvat and Sam Reinhart on Canada’s third line. The other three forward lines will remain untouched, with Sam Bennett serving as the 13th forward. In addition, this defenseman, Travis Sanheim, will take Morrissey’s place as the seventh defenseman for the match.It will be interesting to see what Team Canada will display with their strong and talented team against Switzerland at the Milano Santagiulia Arena, with both teams looking to secure positioning in the Olympic preliminary round.","Seth jarvis to make olympic debut as brad marchand and josh morrissey to remain absent.

Bad Bunny has divided the country with his Super Bowl LX performance

Bad Bunny, the Super Bowl LX halftime show headliner, broke records on Sunday night with his performance even though it has divided the country.While Bad Bunny set the stage on fire, his ex girlfriend and supermodel, Kendall Jenner, was also spotted at the show along with her sister, Kim Kardashian and her new romance, Lewis Hamilton. Amid this, a clip of Bad Bunny and Kendall Jenner leaving together in a luxurious car has sparked chaos.A few hours ago, a clip of the popular Grammy winner Bad Bunny and Kendall Jenner hopping into his $3 million Buggati Chiron have sparked panic among fans.Much to the disappointment of fans, the clip is actually three years old.

Stefanos Tsitsipas recalls Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal bond during 2019 Laver Cup and how it shaped him



Stefanos Tsitsipas gave fans a story they had never heard before. Speaking on the What’s The Call? podcast with his former girlfriend Theodora Petalas and co-host Andrea, the Greek star opened up about a night with Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal that changed something small but personal in his life. He said it was the first time he ever drank alcohol. And yes, it happened during a Laver Cup week. Stefanos Tsitsipas did not hold back. He explained how Federer gently pushed him to try a drink. “I got drunk for the first time with Rafa and Roger [at the Laver Cup].That was the very first time I ever drank alcohol in my life. I had no idea what to order. I had never tried anything in my life. Roger is like, ‘Come on, you’ve got to have a drink,’ and I am like, ‘Ok, if Roger says I have got to have a drink, I have got to have a drink.’” Then he shared how he sees both legends off the court. “Rafa is a bit of an introvert; he is not going to talk like Roger does. Roger is a very confident guy. He will come to you, talk to you, ask you silly questions. He is a kid, Roger is a kid, in a good way. I like Roger being this way.” That night, he said, was full of laughter. He and Dominic Thiem were dancing and singing on tables. For Tsitsipas, it felt less like rivals and more like teammates.The night he described happened during the 2019 Laver Cup in Geneva. That year, Tsitsipas played doubles with Rafael Nadal in one match and with Roger Federer in another. He lost both matches in three sets, but Team Europe still lifted the trophy.Later, Tsitsipas told the Laver Cup website that the event brought him closer to his idols. “It brought me closer to my heroes. It brought me closer to their personalities and what they feel like in real life. I was able to admire them in a different way, on a different scale than I was before. And getting to meet them, getting to talk to them in a way that I do not usually do when I am on the regular tour. It brought a lot of emotions and a lot of great memories. ”Right now, Tsitsipas is ranked World No. 32. His 2026 season has not started smoothly. He lost early in Adelaide. At the Australian Open and at the ATP 500 event in Rotterdam, he won one match but could not go further. Even so, moments like the Laver Cup remind him why he loves the sport. For him, tennis is not only about winning. Sometimes, it is about shared memories with legends like Federer and Nadal.",Stefanos tsitsipas opened up about a night with roger federer and rafael nadal.
