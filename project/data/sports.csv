Concern is mounting in Edmonton over the health of Leon Draisaitl after fans noticed the Oilers superstar repeatedly icing his right hand during Germany's Olympic Games. The injury appears to be lingering from an incident against the Minnesota Wild on January 31.Draisaitl left that game to have his right hand evaluated by the Oilers medical staff, but returned to play. With the Olympics on the horizon, any player would push through pain to represent their country at such a significant event. Unfortunately, the Olympics may be worsening whatever hand issue Draisaitl is dealing with.Fans have observed him icing his right hand on the bench after nearly every shift during Germany's first two games at the Milano Cortina 2026 tournament. Despite the apparent injury, Draisaitl continues to give his best effort for Germany.He has one goal and three assists through two Olympic games and leads all German players in shots on goal. Germany opened with a 3-1 victory over Denmark before falling 4-3 to Latvia in a stunning upset on Saturday morning.

What happens if rain washes out IND vs PAK T20 World Cup match?

NEW DELHI: The highly anticipated India vs Pakistan match in the T20 World Cup 2026 is scheduled to be played on Sunday at the R Premadasa Stadium in Colombo, but rain could spoil the big game.Both teams have started the tournament well. India, the defending champions, beat the United States and then thrashed Namibia by 93 runs. Pakistan had a shaky start against the Netherlands but pulled off a close win and then comfortably defeated the USA.India and Pakistan have been in the same group in many recent tournaments, including the last five T20 World Cups and the previous two ODI World Cups. India has dominated Pakistan in T20 World Cup history, winning 7 out of 8 matches. India also has a strong record in Colombo, winning most of their matches at this venue.Weather forecasts show a high chance of rain during the day, though it may ease in the evening.For the match to have a result, each team must play at least five overs.If that doesn’t happen, the match will be abandoned and both teams will get one point each, since there is no reserve day for group-stage games.But weather remains out of anyone’s control.If the match is completely washed out, broadcasters will lose advertising money, and fans may get refunds on tickets, which would hurt Sri Lanka Cricket’s earnings.A washed-out India vs Pakistan match would cause major financial losses for everyone involved.","R premadasa stadium, in colombo, sri lanka.

The end of a player’s time with a team is often measured in numbers, but for Chris Bassitt, his Toronto chapter will be remembered for something far more meaningful. As the veteran right hander officially begins a new journey in the American League East, the Toronto Blue Jays chose to highlight his impact beyond baseball. Before fans focused on contracts or roster changes, the organization made sure to recognize the difference he made in the community.Over three seasons, Bassitt and his wife Jessica committed themselves to Jays Care initiatives that support youth through sport and mentorship. Their Pitch-In initiative became a steady source of funding for programs aimed at helping children grow through baseball. The impact was not symbolic. It was financial, consistent, and deeply personal.“Thank you to Chris and Jessica Bassitt for their incredible support of Jays Care over the past three seasons. 💙 Through the Bassitts Pitch-In initiative, the Bassitt family generously donated over $500,000 CAD to kids in Jays Care programs and made an immeasurable impact on our community. We’re deeply grateful and wish you all the best in your next chapter!”That message captured why Bassitt’s departure carries emotional weight.His $500,000 CAD donation will continue supporting children across Canada, ensuring his influence remains long after his final outing in Toronto.Now, Bassitt turns the page with the Baltimore Orioles, staying in the competitive AL East. His move keeps him in a division he knows well, but in a new uniform and role.Last season, Bassitt went 11 9 with a 3.96 ERA across 32 regular season appearances as Toronto claimed the American League pennant. During the postseason, he stepped into a relief role and posted a 1.04 ERA with 10 strikeouts in seven outings. His flexibility and steady presence proved valuable in high pressure moments.Entering his 11th major league season, Bassitt will turn 37 on Feb. 22. Throughout his career with the Chicago White Sox, Oakland Athletics, New York Mets, and Toronto, he has compiled an 83 65 record with a 3.64 ERA. For Baltimore, he adds experience and stability. For Toronto, he leaves a lasting legacy that extends far beyond the mound.","Blue jays thank chris bassitt for $500k commitment to jays care programs.

Matt Weston and Alex Howard-Jones plan their wedding after Milano Cortina Winter Olympics 2026



British skeleton racer Matt Weston is on the verge of winning Great Britain’s first medal of the 2026 Winter Olympics. The 28-year-old has made a strong start in Milano Cortina and leads the standings after the opening two runs. He holds a 0.30-second advantage heading into the final runs on Friday evening. Expectations were high because he arrived as the reigning world, European and overall World Cup champion, and he has so far matched the hype.Away from the ice track, Weston is also enjoying a big year in his personal life. He is engaged to his long-time partner Alex Howard-Jones, and the couple plan to marry in July after the Games. Their relationship has been visible on social media for years, with photos together dating back to 2016. They also share their home with a ten-year-old cocker spaniel named Logan.While Matt Weston chases Milano Cortina Winter Olympics 2026 success, his fiancée Alex Howard-Jones has built her own career. She is a chief operating officer (COO) and a founding member of pltfrm search, an executive search firm based in London. Reportedly, the couple plans to celebrate their wedding just months after the conclusion of the Winter Olympics, meaning 2026 could become the biggest year of Weston’s life both professionally and personally.Notably, Matt Weston did not begin his sporting journey in skeleton racing. He first played rugby and later trained in taekwondo. Many people expected that he would become one of Britain’s top winter athletes. He only started skeleton racing in the summer of 2017 and made his World Cup debut in January 2020.His rise was quick. In 2021, Weston won a World Cup gold medal. It was the first time a British man had done so in more than 13 years. He then became Britain’s first skeleton world champion in eight years in 2023. The last British champion before that was Lizzie Yarnold back in 2015, while Kristan Bromley was the last British male champion in 2008.Last season proved his most successful yet. Matt Weston secured back-to-back overall World Cup titles and also reclaimed his world championship. That form made him one of the favourites for the Milano-Cortina Games.","British skeleton racer matt weston is on the verge of winning great britain’s first medal of the 2026 winter olympics.

2026: A torn shoulder, a silver medal, and a different kind of win

2018: Chloe Kim turns PyeongChang into a launchpad

2022: Beijing cements the back to back halfpipe champion

Where Chloe Kim sits now in snowboarding history

On a snowy night in Livigno, Italy, Chloe Kim led the women’s halfpipe final after an 88.00 opener, then watched 17 year old Gaon Choi snatch gold with a 90.25 on her last run. Kim fell on her own final attempt and settled for silver at the 2026 Winter Olympics.This was the shot at a once in a lifetime headline: the first three straight Olympic golds in any snowboarding event. Instead, Kim walks away with three Olympic medals total, two gold and one silver, and remains the only woman with back to back halfpipe titles while Shaun White still stands as the only rider with three golds overall.A month before Milan Cortina, Kim tore the labrum in her left shoulder during training in Switzerland and admitted she was unsure she would even make it to the Games.She still qualified first, then played it safe on her opening run in Livigno, banking that 88.00 while other riders slammed in heavy snow. Choi crashed hard in her first run, needed treatment in the pipe, then came back to land the run of the night and grab gold on her third attempt.Kim had a choice on that last drop: repeat the cleaner, safer first run or throw the hardest combo on her sheet, including the cab double 1080 that has defined her progression.She chose violence. She caught the wall, slid out, and the three peat vanished.Even then, she refused to mope. “In my eyes, I’m a winner, because I was able to persevere and fight through,” she told reporters, per Time. On the way down the hill she walked hand in hand with boyfriend Myles Garrett of the Cleveland Browns, who called watching her ride “exciting but terrifying.”She is expected to undergo shoulder surgery once she is back in the United States.Kim did not arrive in PyeongChang as a mystery. She already had X Games golds and had become the first woman to land back to back 1080s in competition.At 17, she turned that hype into something concrete, winning women’s halfpipe gold with a 93.75, then nearly touching perfection with a 98.25 on her final run. She became the youngest woman to win Olympic snowboarding gold and the youngest to land two 1080s in a row at the Games, jumping past Kelly Clark’s age record in the process.Four years later in Beijing, Kim arrived with fame, pressure, and time away from the sport behind her. She qualified first, then ended the final early with a 94.00 on her opening run in Genting Snow Park.Her last two attempts turned into lab experiments. She tried new tricks, fell both times, and still won by a margin that made everyone else look like they were fighting for silver. That result made her the first woman ever to win back to back Olympic halfpipe golds.There is still no true three peat in Olympic snowboarding. Kim’s silver joins failed bids this week from Ester Ledecka in parallel giant slalom and Anna Gasser in big air, both of whom also saw their runs at a third straight gold shut down in Milan Cortina.Kim’s resume is already in rare air: three Olympic medals, eight X Games golds and a stack of world titles, plus progression tricks like the double cork 1080 and a historic 1260 that moved the entire field’s ceiling.So yes, the golden three peat story died in the Italian snow. But the bigger picture is ugly for everyone else: even on a torn shoulder, even on a night when a teenager finally beat her, the bar in this sport still has Kim’s name on it.","Chloe kim fell on her final run in the women's halfpipe final in milan cortina.

The victory gave him his eighth Olympic gold medal, tying the all-time Winter Olympics record. Klæbo finished 4.9 seconds ahead of France’s Mathis Desloges, showing once again why he is one of the biggest stars in cross-country skiing right now.It was also his third gold medal at these Games, making him one of the standout athletes of the tournament so far. His win quickly became one of the most talked-about moments of the day. Fans have watched him dominate event after event, and many now wonder if he will go on to break the record before these Olympics end. With more races still ahead, the Norwegian skier has a real chance to make even more history in Milan.Johannes Høsflot Klæbo’s latest win added another chapter to a career that has already been packed with success.Before Milano-Cortina, he had won gold medals at the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang and again at the 2022 Games in Beijing.His titles include victories in the individual sprint, team sprint, and relay events, making him one of the most complete skiers in the sport.Now tied on eight gold medals with Norwegian greats Bjørn Dæhlie, Marit Bjørgen, and Ole Einar Bjørndalen, Klæbo has placed himself among the biggest names in Winter Olympics history.More importantly, he still has three races left at these Games: the relay, team sprint, and 50km mass start, meaning the record could soon belong to him alone.Klæbo’s performances have also caught the attention of fans beyond the skiing world. A video of his uphill sprint from earlier in the Games went viral online, gaining over 15 million views on X.American skier Ben Ogden, who finished behind him in the sprint race, summed up the challenge of racing against the Norwegian by saying, “I like to go to every race thinking that it’s a race for the win, but these days, a lot of the time it’s a race for second.”With the final week of competition still ahead, all eyes are now on Klæbo to see how much further he can push his Olympic legacy.","Johannes høsflot klæbo won the men’s 10km freestyle race at the 2026 winter olympics in milano-cortina. The victory gave him his eighth olympic gold medal, tying the all-time winter olympics record. It was also his third gold medal at these games, making him one of the standout athletes of the tournament.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128315197,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-48106,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"

Slovakia will be facing Sweden in its last preliminary fixture



Slovakia is making believers out of everyone in Milan. After shocking the hockey world with a 4-1 dismantling of defending Olympic champion Finland in their opener, Slovakia held off a spirited Italian side 3-2 at Rho Arena on Friday to remain perfect in Group B.It was not the blowout many expected, but captain Tomas Tatar and his teammates found a way to secure the victory. Italy, playing in front of a passionate home crowd, refused to go quietly against Slovakia; they pushed even harder in today’s game.Slovakia has been the biggest dark horse so far. Despite lacking any of the firepower of the “Big 4 Nations,” they have thrilled fans and critics alike. Meanwhile, the hosts had already proven against Sweden that they could compete with elite competition, trailing just 2-2 in the second period before eventually falling 5-2.The 35-year-old Tatar, who spent 14 NHL seasons with six different teams, has been instrumental in Slovakia's success. He recorded 496 points across 927 regular-season games at the highest level before returning to Europe this season with Zug in Switzerland's National League.His leadership on Slovakia's top line alongside Juraj Slafkovsky and Adam Ruzicka has given the Slovaks one of the tournament's most dangerous units.Slafkovsky, the 2022 Olympic MVP, already has nine career Olympic goals at just 21 years old, trailing only Marian Hossa and Miroslav Satan on Slovakia's all-time list.Despite the loss, Italy has earned respect throughout the tournament. With zero NHL experience on their roster, they have competed hard against Sweden and Slovakia, two teams loaded with professional talent.The host nation has shown they belong at this level, even if the results have not gone their way. Their supporters at Rho Arena created an electric atmosphere that nearly willed them to an upset. Slovakia sits atop Group B at 2-0-0-0 following their narrow victory.Finland has already bounced back from their opening loss with a 4-1 win over Sweden in Friday's other Group B action, leaving the group wide open heading into the final round of preliminary games.

Jannik Sinner applauds Federica Brignone’s comeback as Italian skier wins Super-G gold at Milano-Cortina Winter Olympics

Italian tennis star Jannik Sinner shared heartfelt words for fellow Italian athlete Federica Brignone after her inspiring gold medal win at the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milano-Cortina. Brignone, who suffered a serious leg injury less than a year ago, returned to competition and claimed gold in the Super-G event. Her victory quickly became one of the biggest stories of the Games, not just because of the medal, but because of the difficult journey she went through to get back on the slopes.The 35-year-old skier had broken her left leg during the Italian championships and needed two major surgeries. Many people believed she might miss the Olympics completely. Instead, she returned in remarkable fashion and even set a new milestone by becoming the oldest Alpine skier to win Olympic gold. After the race, Sinner openly admired her determination and praised her effort in a moving reaction.Jannik Sinner spoke about Brignone’s achievement in an interview with La Gazzetta dello Sport, calling her comeback extraordinary.He said, “She’s a phenomenon. After everything she’s been through, being able to come back and achieve this result is something extraordinary.”Sinner had earlier spoken about how difficult injury recovery can be, especially in a sport like skiing. During the Australian Open, he explained that skiing carries huge risks and long recovery periods.He said, “Skiing and tennis are totally different sports because on the slopes, if you get hurt during the season, you’re out all year. It’s a really dangerous sport; when you step out of the gate, you have to be brave.”He also praised Brignone’s hard work behind the scenes, adding, “What Federica has done… to be able to experience the Olympics is incredible… she’s done something incredible that almost no one can do.”While Brignone celebrates her historic win, Sinner is now turning his attention back to tennis. The Italian started his 2026 season at the Australian Open but lost in the semifinals to Novak Djokovic.He is expected to return to action at the Qatar Open in Doha, where rival Carlos Alcaraz is also set to compete. Djokovic, however, has withdrawn from the tournament.Brignone’s victory and Sinner’s reaction have brought together two major Italian sports stories, showing how athletes from different fields often inspire each other during big moments like the Winter Olympics.",Federica brignone won gold in the super-g event at the 2026 winter olympics in milano-cortina.

This is such a special opportunity, and still feels pretty surreal to be here and be able to compete and put on this jersey and play with this group of guys. It’s a great start for us in this tournament, and we’ll look to build off it.”Matthews further spoke about the early adversities the team faced at the initial stage, “It’s fine. Those things happen all the time. You know, can’t really complain about it. The ref maybe didn’t see it. Was a little shaken up, but felt fine and just kept playing and just go from there,” he said.As per reports, Brady Tkachuk scored first at 5:29 in the first period with help from his brother Matthew. In the second period, Team USA took control as the team got three goals from Brock Nelson and Tage Thompson.

Chris Paul’s rise from rookie of the year to perennial All-Star

Chris Paul's retirement marks the end of a historic statistical legacy

Chris Paul, one of the best and most respected point guards in NBA history, has officially called it quits after 21 seasons in the NBA. Confirming the end of his storied career, the 40-year-old made the announcement in an emotional statement. Paul embodied elite leadership, precise playmaking, and fierce competitiveness over the next two-plus decades, cementing a legacy as one of the greatest floor generals in the history of the sport.Paul has been a consistent Hall of Fame-level talent since back when he was a teenage legend. The retirement closes the book on a career that spanned three eras of the NBA and signals the end of one of the most impactful careers the league has seen.Chris Paul was the fourth overall pick in the 2005 NBA Draft, selected by the then-New Orleans Hornets; he quickly became a franchise player. Winning the NBA Rookie of the Year award in 2006, he was soon distinguished by his nearly unparalleled awareness on the court, his ball handling, and his defensive acumen.During his career, Paul was named to 12 NBA All-Star selections, received 11 All-NBA honors, and nine consecutive All-Defensive Team nods.His leadership made several franchises better, and most famously, he led the Los Angeles Clippers to heights they had never reached before, guiding the “Lob City” era and making the team a regular playoff team.Aside from his stint with the Clippers, Paul played a pivotal role for the Houston Rockets, Oklahoma City Thunder, Phoenix Suns, Golden State Warriors, and San Antonio Spurs. He took the Suns to the 2021 NBA Finals, two wins short of clinching the elusive title that eluded him during his Phoenix playing days.Chris Paul's retirement was swift, but it ended a career filled with records and consistent greatness. He's 2nd all-time assists and steals 2nd respectively, arguing his position as the greatest playmaker and best perimeter defender of all-time. Reinforcing his blend of scoring and distribution, Paul has scored more than 20,000 points while recording over 10,000 assists.Paul should have a room full of those fine letters, but no NBA title ever be displayed, crowning his résumé. He was president of the National Basketball Players Association, a trusty mentor to younger stars, and an embodiment of professionalism and basketball smarts.","Chris paul has announced his retirement after 21 seasons in the nba.

Team Canada will play without two key players as they are all set to lock horns against Team Switzerland in their upcoming men's ice hockey action at the 2026 Winter Olympics, scheduled for Friday. The news has been confirmed recently by the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) ahead of their clash against the opponent team.The decision came as Josh Morrissey sustained an undisclosed injury recently during Canada’s opening match against Czechia. While Brad Marchand’s reason for exclusion is unknown at this time. The 37-year-old had one assist in 9:29 of play in Canada’s bottom-six in his first Olympic appearance, according to reports.Earlier, Canada kicked off its Olympic campaign in Group A with a 5-0 win over Czechia, where 19-year-old Macklin Celebrini opened the score for the team on 12 February, as reported by Olympics.com. Meanwhile, Czechia also gave a tough fight to the mighty Canadians. Team Canada will play on February 13, 2026, without two key players due to injury and other unfortunate circumstances. These key players are Brad Marchand and Josh Morrissey, who are considered the marquee players of the team.Their absence from today’s lineup was confirmed by IIHF. However, Team Canada will replace these players with two other significant players.According to Daily Faceoff, Josh Morrissey will miss the match, as he was last seen leaving Canada’s tournament opener on Thursday against Czechia after sustaining an injury. At present, the status of Morrissey’s injury is unclear, but if he is unable to return, his roster spot will be difficult to replace after Canada officially registered 25 players on February 10.Announcing the same on X/Twitter, Steven Ellis stated, “Both Brad Marchand and Josh Morrissey are listed as scratches for Canada today against Switzerland. Jordan Binnington also went dress. #Olympics.” Meanwhile, according to Kyle Bukauskas, ""Brad Marchand is taking a rest, too."" It is expected that Marchand will be back, but for now, he can recharge and get ready for the upcoming important matches.As per reports, in place of these players, Carolina’s Seth Jarvis will make his Olympic debut. He will play alongside Bo Horvat and Sam Reinhart on Canada’s third line. The other three forward lines will remain untouched, with Sam Bennett serving as the 13th forward. In addition, this defenseman, Travis Sanheim, will take Morrissey’s place as the seventh defenseman for the match.It will be interesting to see what Team Canada will display with their strong and talented team against Switzerland at the Milano Santagiulia Arena, with both teams looking to secure positioning in the Olympic preliminary round.","Seth jarvis to make olympic debut as brad marchand and josh morrissey to remain absent.

Bad Bunny has divided the country with his Super Bowl LX performance

Bad Bunny, the Super Bowl LX halftime show headliner, broke records on Sunday night with his performance even though it has divided the country.While Bad Bunny set the stage on fire, his ex girlfriend and supermodel, Kendall Jenner, was also spotted at the show along with her sister, Kim Kardashian and her new romance, Lewis Hamilton. Amid this, a clip of Bad Bunny and Kendall Jenner leaving together in a luxurious car has sparked chaos.A few hours ago, a clip of the popular Grammy winner Bad Bunny and Kendall Jenner hopping into his $3 million Buggati Chiron have sparked panic among fans.Much to the disappointment of fans, the clip is actually three years old. The popular clip was taken in April 2023 when Bad Bunny and Kendall Jenner were publicly dating and had gone to Tyler, the Creator’s concert.The “Debí Tirar Más Fotos” artist, Bad Bunny and Kendall Jenner went public with their high profile relationship in 2023 but went their separate ways by the end of that year.Later, in 2024, the two did get back together for a few months but ended things again. Since then, both Bad Bunny and Kendall Jenner have moved on in their respective lives with other people.While Bad Bunny’s picture at the 68th Annual Grammy Awards with Kendall Jenner’s best friends, Hailey Bieber, and Justin Bieber did spark rumors of a reunion, nothing has been confirmed yet.Neither Bad Bunny nor Kendall Jenner have commented on rumors of them rekindling their romance yet.Despite their high profile relationship coming to a dramatic end, it seems both remain on friendly terms as Kendall Jenner was even spotted enjoying Bad Bunny’s record breaking performance at Super Bowl LX halftime show.While Bad Bunny’s show broke records, it has also divided citizens across the country and the world.To make things worse, President Donald Trump has brutally slammed Bad Bunny’s performance at Super Bowl LX.President Donald Trump took to social media to post, “The Super Bowl Halftime Show is absolutely terrible, one of the worst, EVER! It makes no sense, is an affront to the Greatness of America, and doesn’t represent our standards of Success, Creativity, or Excellence…”However, Bad Bunny has stayed away from commenting on it.","A clip of bad bunny and kendall jenner leaving together in a luxurious car has sparked chaos among fans.
