NEW DELHI: Well-knowned politician and Congress MP Shashi Tharoor has sparked a fresh discussion about wicketkeeper-batter Sanju Samson 's batting position following India's victory in the 2025 Asia Cup final against Pakistan in Dubai on Sunday.He questioned the decision to include vice-captain Shubman Gill as an opener, resulting in Samson batting in the middle order.Both Gill and Samson had modest performances in the tournament. Gill, who opened regularly, scored 127 runs in seven innings with a strike rate of 151.19. Samson, batting between No. 3 and No. 5, managed 132 runs in four innings at a strike rate of 124.53.""It is fair to ask a few questions, without in any way detracting from our victory. Was it right to break up the hugely successful opening partnership of Abhishek Sharma and Sanju Samson, and relegate a three-time centurion to a middle slot where he was uncomfortable? Did Gill's performances at the #AsiaCup justify such a change? Would it not be better to restore Sanju to the place where he has shone for India, put Gill at number three, and have Surya take the number five slot instead?"" He wrote on X.Prior to the tournament, Samson was India's preferred opener.The team's decision to bring back Gill and appoint him as vice-captain made him a permanent fixture in the playing eleven.Samson contributed 20 runs in the final match.He helped stabilise the innings after India lost three early wickets during the powerplay.""Yeah, I really enjoyed the pressure actually. I have not played many India-Pakistan games, but today, I think the pressure was all over there. Three wickets down in the powerplay, so I just had to use my experience, calm the nerves down, and just watch the ball and react. That's what I did, and it came off nicely. I think I had a really good partnership with Tilak, and really enjoyed playing the game today,"" he said after the match.",Shashi tharoor questions india's decision to include shubman gill as an opener. He also questions the decision to place wicketkeeper-batter sanju samson in the middle order.

Kapil Dev’s bold take on India-Pakistan Asia Cup drama: 'It’s time to…',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/asia-cup/kapil-devs-bold-take-on-india-pakistan-asia-cup-drama-its-time-to/articleshow/124223524.cms,"Pakistan's captain Salman Agha and India's captain Suryakumar Yadav.

Inside details of how PCB chief Mohsin Naqvi ran away with the Asia Cup trophy!

Poll Should politics be kept separate from sports like cricket? Yes, absolutely No, they are interconnected

Former Indian cricket captain Kapil Dev called for keeping politics separate from cricket following India's refusal to accept the Asia Cup trophy and medals from Pakistan 's Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi after their five-wicket victory over Pakistan in the final at Dubai International Cricket Stadium on September 28, 2025.The presentation ceremony was delayed and shortened after the Indian team declined to receive the awards from Naqvi, who heads both the Pakistan Cricket Board and the Asian Cricket Council. The Indian team instead celebrated their victory on the field without the official awards.The match itself saw Pakistan make a strong start with an 84-run opening partnership between Fakhar Zaman and Sahibzada Farhan. However, they suffered a dramatic collapse, losing nine wickets for just 33 runs to finish at 146 in 19.1 overs. India successfully chased down the target despite losing three early wickets.""I just want to say — your responsibility, and responsibility for the entire media also we should look into the sports side rather than looking into the politics side. Yes, media has the responsibility to bring everything on the table, but as a sportsman, I would like to see that we should stick to sports. It will be much better,"" Kapil Dev said in an interview with India Today.The controversy extended beyond the trophy presentation. Pakistan's Haris Rauf received a fine of 30 percent of his match fee for making a provocative 'plane crash' gesture during the Super Four match. Additionally, Sahibzada Farhan received a warning for his 'gunshot' celebration after scoring fifty runs, which he defended as a cultural expression.Kapil Dev, who led India to their first World Cup victory in 1983, also commented on the current state of Pakistani cricket talent compared to previous generations.""Yeah, I think they don't have the similar talent they used to have in the '80s, '90s or before that. Pakistan has given us, to the world, one of the best cricketers. You can talk about Imran Khan, you can talk about Javed Miandad, Zaheer Abbas, Wasim Akram , Waqar Younis. They have given us that talent. But unfortunately, we can't see similar talent today — not even one percent of what they used to have,"" Kapil Dev added.The Asia Cup final victory marked a significant achievement for India, despite the controversy surrounding the presentation ceremony. The team's performance demonstrated their ability to handle pressure situations, successfully chasing down the target with two balls remaining in their innings.The incident has highlighted the ongoing challenges in keeping sports separate from political tensions between the two nations. Despite these challenges, the focus remains on the cricket played on the field and the sporting achievements of both teams.The match will be remembered not only for India's victory but also for the broader context of cricket diplomacy and its role in India-Pakistan relations. The events surrounding the trophy presentation have added another chapter to the complex history of cricket encounters between these two cricket-playing nations.","Former india captain kapil dev calls for keeping politics separate from cricket.

NFL insider hints at a major change in Russell Wilson’s future in the league



Russell Wilson has had a pretty difficult start to the new season



The New York Giants recorded their first win in the new season after defeating the Los Angeles Chargers on Saturday and now, all eyes are on Russell Wilson. With Russell Wilson being benched for rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart, it has raised many eyebrows. Amid all the speculation, NFL insider Ian Rapoport has shared an update on Russell Wilson’s situation.A few hours ago, NFL insider Ian Rapoport of NFL Network, reported that there are possibilities that the NFL veteran, Russell Wilson, might be traded by the New York Giants.According to NFL insider Ian Rapoport of NFL Network, “Don’t be surprised if another team wants to find out.”Ian Rapoport added, “Wilson is expected to emerge as a trade candidate prior to the deadline on Nov. 4, the target of a QB-needy team in need of a veteran, according to sources around the league…”Amid all the speculations and rumors, neither the New York Giants nor Russell Wilson has broken their silence on it.While Russell Wilson is being benched, a few days ago, the NFL veteran had opened up on how he wants to help his team.Russell Wilson said, “I’m focused on helping this team win…I’m focused on helping Jaxson. . . . I want to be here.”The NFL veteran added, “I love this organization, I love the process of it all. I love the guys in the locker room. I’m not giving up on us and this season.”The new season has been a bit difficult for the 36 year old NFL star, Russell Wilson, after he signed a one year contract with the New York Giants for a whopping $10.5 million.Before the season began, the New York Giants had confirmed that, despite Jaxson Dart joining the team, Russell Wilson would be their starting quarterback.However, the New York Giants experienced brutal losses in the first few matches of the new season and it led to fans booing Russell Wilson and demanding Jaxson Dart to be the starting quarterback.Despite all the criticism that Russell Wilson is facing, the NFL veteran continues to be positive and very supportive of Jaxson Dart and the team.Also Read: NFL trade rumors: Insider reveals New York Jets weighing big decision on Breece Hall amid slow start to the season","Nfl insider hints at a major change in russell wilson’s future in the league.

How Tyreek Hill’s season-ending injury changes the Miami Dolphins offense and Jaylen Waddle’s role



Why Tyreek Hill’s injury creates long-term questions about his contract and the Miami Dolphins’ future



The Tyreek Hill injury update hit like a gut punch for Miami Dolphins fans. The wide receiver dislocated his left knee during Monday night’s 27-21 win over the New York Jets. By Tuesday, ESPN’s Adam Schefter confirmed that Hill tore multiple ligaments, including his ACL, and would have surgery. His 2025 season is finished.The injury happened in the third quarter when Tyreek Hill caught a 10-yard pass from Tua Tagovailoa and was tackled out of bounds. Hill’s left leg twisted underneath him. Trainers placed an air cast before he was carted off as teammates gathered around.Drew Rosenhaus, Hill’s agent, told WSVN 7News that doctors were checking for every possible complication. “Are there any torn ligaments, is there torn cartilage, are there any broken bones, to check on the blood flow, any, god forbid, nerve damage? All of this is getting checked out,” Rosenhaus said.Despite the scene, Hill managed to smile, wave, and joke as he left the field. Mike McDaniel said, “He was probably in the best spirits of any player that I've ever seen [have] such a terrible experience. He immediately had wide eyes and was talking, 'I'm good, just make sure the guys get this win.’”The Miami Dolphins’ first win of the season came in a bittersweet package, as their 27-21 victory over the New York Jets was overshadowed by Tyreek Hill’s devastating injury.The superstar wideout was carted off in the third quarter with a dislocated knee, later confirmed to involve multiple torn ligaments requiring surgery. NFL insider Ian Rapoport confirmed that Hill’s 2025 season is over, and his availability for 2026 remains uncertain, a crushing blow for a franchise built around his speed and explosiveness.Ahead of surgery, Hill shared a heartfelt message on social media: “You guys have been awesome… I’m absolutely honores, granted the situation, but I love you guys so much.” (@cheetah) #PhinsUp. His agent Drew Rosenhaus also posted a photo from the hospital showing Hill flashing a peace sign, smiling alongside family, while Hill himself gave a thumbs up with the caption “here we go” and a peace sign emoji. These gestures have inspired the Dolphins’ locker room, reminding teammates that leadership and energy extend far beyond the field. Jaylen Waddle now steps fully into the WR1 role, with head coach Mike McDaniel leaning more on Puka Nacua and Durham Smythe to fill the offensive void, but Hill’s message and resilience continue to shape the team’s spirit as they prepare for Week 5 against the Carolina Panthers.Tyreek Hill entered the game leading the Dolphins with 198 receiving yards. He added 67 yards on six catches before leaving. His absence immediately shifts Miami’s offensive balance. Jaylen Waddle becomes the clear WR1, while second-year receiver Malik Washington will be asked to step up after flashing in training camp.Tight end Darren Waller returned Monday night with two touchdown catches, and De’Von Achane continues to be one of the most productive pass-catching backs in the league. “There is no replacing [Hill], but I feel like we got guys that can get the job done,” Waller said.McDaniel noted that Hill’s energy kept the Dolphins locked in. “I saw him make eye contact and rip a joke or two to [Jaylen] Waddle and De'Von [Achane]. A lot of guys got back into the game provoked by what he said verbally,” he added.Tyreek Hill is 31 and under contract with the Miami Dolphins through 2026. His base salary for 2026 is $29.9 million, with $11 million guaranteed in March and another $5 million in roster bonuses. Releasing him before June 1 could save the Dolphins $36.3 million in cap space.That math is brutal. Hill will be 32 before he plays another down, and this injury could change how Miami views his future. The franchise has to weigh whether to gamble on a full recovery or cut ties with one of the most explosive wideouts in NFL history.The Dolphins had entered 2025 as dark horse Super Bowl contenders, but this Tyreek Hill injury update leaves their title window in doubt. Without his speed stretching defenses, Miami’s offense no longer has its most dangerous weapon.","Tyreek hill dislocated his left knee during monday night’s 27-21 win over the new york jets.

Cristiano Ronaldo to Play Only 75% of Al Nassr Matches as Jorge Jesus Monitors Workload: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/saudi-football/news/cristiano-ronaldo-to-play-only-75-of-al-nassr-matches-as-jorge-jesus-monitors-workload-report/articleshow/124237573.cms,"Cristiano Ronaldo (Image Source: Getty)

Jorge Jesus implements strategic workload plan for Cristiano Ronaldo

Cristiano Ronaldo's absence in recent matches

Cristiano Ronaldo, who is currently 40 years old, has reportedly settled with Al Nassr's new manager Jorge Jesus, that he will only play around 75 % of the matches. It is also known that the decision comes within the framework of smart workload management of Ronaldo's aids, so that he always performs well with Al Nassr and the Portugal national team. The deal is a measured approach to player management that is sensitive to on-field performance, player longevity, and the rigors of professional football.Cristiano Ronaldo and Jorge Jesus have reportedly reached an agreement to limit the playing time of the forward. As part of this plan, Ronaldo will not play a minimum of 25 percent of Al Nassr's matches so he can rest and recover sufficiently. It also highlights the club's decision to manage the veteran's fitness given the number of big matches coming up soon, including internationals.They will closely monitor his training load and recovery routines. According to reports, Jorge Jesus is liaising extensively with the club's medical and fitness staff to ensure Ronaldo remains in top shape without picking up any more injuries as he enters the latter stages of his playing career, continuing to play at the domestic and international level. The manager knows that players have different needs and expectations, and Ronaldo is, without any doubt, one of the all-time greats of the sport, so it makes sense to handle his career, from now on, in a tailored fashion.As part of this load management system, Cristiano Ronaldo missed Al Nassr's King Cup game against Jeddah, which the team won 4-0. However, manager Jorge Jesus explained the decision was made to keep Ronaldo fit and ready for his next league matches, adding that a player of his age and experience requires strategic rest. ""By rotating Ronaldo with careful attention, the club ensures that he is fit and in optimal condition for the matches where his presence is most vital.Also Read: Saudi Arabia’s $225 million football king: Meet Cristiano Ronaldo, the richest player in the Kingdom This is not an isolated incident, as such a rethinking of tactics aligns with a larger philosophy being adopted in football today, whereby clubs are placing much less of an emphasis on regular match appearances over long periods of time and are heavily invested in maximizing the capabilities of their squad.

Bronny James 2025 Lakers Media Day Interview | September 29, 2025

Bronny James reflects on his offseason growth

Bronny James, the eldest son of LeBron James , has been around since the very beginning of the NBA star’s illustrious career. In fact, Bronny was born when his father was already playing for the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2004. Now, as LeBron confirms he will play his 23rd NBA season, Bronny has shared his reaction. With players set to head into training camps before the season begins, his remarks drew plenty of attention.During media day on Monday, Bronny James was asked about his father’s decision to return. The 20-year-old replied, ""I'm just as surprised as everyone else. I don't know how he's doing it. It's just crazy to be a part of that. And I've been here from literally the start… literally since my dad has been playing in the league.”After the video surfaced online, one YouTube user joked, “FINALLY someone used 'literally' literally.” Others, however, couldn’t help noticing Bronny’s receding hairline. A fan commented, “Hair already falling out, he about to reach his prime.” Another wrote, “Bro losing his hair, bro gonna be a goat.”Last year, Bronny James joined LeBron James in a historic development as part of the Los Angeles Lakers.Reflecting on his offseason, where he played in the G-League, Bronny said his game is “miles different” compared to last season. “I feel very confident in my game right now. I am ready,” he said, adding that he’s willing to take any opportunity, early or late in the season, describing himself as a “dirty work guy.”Asked about his personal goals, Bronny explained, “I think just growing up as a player every day. Just coming in and learning from the guys ahead of me and being ready whenever those guys need me. I am just here for the ride, learning every day, working every day, and trying to better myself in any way I can.”Meanwhile, LeBron James has clarified that he won’t wait to play alongside his younger son Bryce James, who is currently in college. He also emphasized that the decision about his retirement will only involve three people — himself, his wife Savannah, and their daughter Zhuri.Also Read: Is LeBron James jealous of Bronny?

Miami Dolphins players react to losing Tyreek Hill after their first win of the season



The Miami Dolphins finally secured their first win of 2025, beating the New York Jets 27-21 on Monday night. The celebration did not last long. Wide receiver Tyreek Hill suffered a devastating knee injury in the third quarter, tearing multiple ligaments. Quarterback Tua Tagovailoa ’s postgame thanks to God for “keeping us safe, for the most part” turned into the headline moment as fans questioned his words while Hill was rushed to the hospital.Tua Tagovailoa opened his ESPN interview with thanks. “All glory belongs to God, my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ,” he said. “Just want to thank Him for this victory and keeping us safe, for the most part.”The phrasing immediately lit up social media. “Keeping us all safe, except our best player, whose leg is now backwards,” one fan wrote on X. Others pointed to Tagovailoa’s concussion history, joking about memory loss.An edited clip stripped out his mention of Hill, but the full interview shows Tagovailoa adding: “My prayers go out to all of those who got injured tonight, my boy Tyreek.” The full quote did little to stop the backlash.Tyreek Hill went down in the third quarter while being tackled along the sideline. Trainers placed his leg in an air cast before carting him off Hard Rock Stadium.He was then taken by ambulance to a Miami hospital.Head coach Mike McDaniel confirmed Hill would stay overnight. “I know he’s at the hospital. I know he’s staying overnight. I know it was a dislocation,” McDaniel told reporters. He called Hill’s calm reaction inspiring: “He immediately had wide eyes and was talking, ‘I’m good, just make sure the guys get this win.’”ESPN’s Adam Schefter later reported that Hill tore his ACL and other ligaments. The 31-year-old will need surgery and is out for the season. Medical experts noted that severe dislocations raise concerns about arteries and nerves in the leg, which is why Hill was hospitalized so quickly.The Dolphins extended their lead just three plays after Hill was carted off, but the team described the moment as bittersweet. Left tackle Patrick Paul called it “a huge blow… a leader for our team, someone who’s very vocal.” Defensive lineman Zach Sieler admitted he could not look at the replay, saying he immediately began to pray for Hill.Jaylen Waddle described the loss as emotional: “It’s mixed emotions having one of our captains, leader, and a player that just means so much to the team. Prayers to him. It’s tough.” Running back De’Von Achane said, “We just got to face the fact that we might not have him.”Former teammates also chimed in.

Nevertheless, certain media outlets continued to ask about Horford and his compatibility with the Warriors. Jimmy Butler was questioned regarding his relationship with Horford on the same day.

NHL analysts debate possible blockbuster trades to replace Aleksander Barkov

Who should Panthers target to help fill Barkov injury void?

Panthers coach Paul Maurice admits there’s no true Barkov replacement

The Florida Panthers’ Stanley Cup title defense has taken a serious hit with captain Aleksander Barkov sidelined following surgery to repair torn ACL and MCL ligaments. The recovery window of seven to nine months means the Panthers could be without their franchise cornerstone for nearly the entire season, forcing the team to explore high-profile replacements.On TSN’s That’s Hockey, analysts Frankie Corrado and Martin Biron discussed potential paths Florida might take. Biron suggested the Panthers could swing for the fences: “If you're going to be aggressive and you want to hit that grand slam, you go after (Penguins’ Evgeni) Malkin. Look, he's on an expiring contract. He's on a bad team. ... I think Malkin gets moved this year.""Corrado, meanwhile, highlighted more practical names such as Alex Wennberg, JG Pageau, and even Columbus captain Boone Jenner, who has ties to Panthers GM Bill Zito. He also floated a more daring scenario: if the Los Angeles Kings stumble early, Florida could pursue Anze Kopitar, noting, “And then you replace a Selke centerman with another Selke centerman and Kopitar.”The analysts agreed that patience could pay off, as struggling teams may become more open to trading top talent by November or December.Despite the trade chatter, Florida head coach Paul Maurice was blunt about the irreplaceable nature of his captain.“What we’re going to get to experience now is you’ll get to know some of the other leaders that we have in our room. We’ll get to see other players.

Max Domi projected to take first-line trial with Auston Matthews and Matthew Knies in Toronto Maple Leafs’ lineup

Impact on Toronto Maple Leafs lineup structure, depth chart, and long-term NHL strategy

The Toronto Maple Leafs are expected to address Mitch Marner’s absence with Max Domi projected to take his spot on the top line alongside Auston Matthews and Matthew Knies. According to Sportsnet insider Luke Fox, this projected lineup could play in the final preseason game, though changes are possible ahead of the Oct. 8 home opener.Domi, 30, has reportedly impressed enough in training camp to secure the right-wing role on Toronto’s first line. Head coach Craig Berube explained that he wants Domi to be more aggressive, shoot the puck, and avoid overpassing, traits that make him a fitting complement to Matthews’ elite scoring ability. Knies provides size and puck retrieval, giving the line a clear mix of skill, speed, and physical presence.While Marner traditionally drove play through extended possessions, Domi thrived in quicker transitions. His ability to move the puck rapidly and attack the slot could accelerate Toronto’s offensive tempo at five-on-five. The chemistry between Matthews and Domi from last season also makes this adjustment less of a gamble, especially in the high-pressure environment of opening night.With Max Domi moving up to the first line, Toronto can test Matias Maccelli, in third-line or situational roles, helping ease pressure on newcomers while maximizing roster depth.According to Sportsnet insider Luke Fox, this projected lineup is expected to dress for Toronto’s final preseason tune-up against the Detroit Red Wings before key players rest ahead of the Oct. 8 home opener.This approach allows head coach Craig Berube to maintain consistency on the top line while experimenting with versatility across the rest of the roster. It also signals that the Maple Leafs may lean into a more direct, vertical style of play compared to previous seasons, designed to create higher-danger scoring chances and reduce dead time in the offensive zone.Max Domi stepping into Marner’s role may not be a permanent solution, but it reflects a calculated decision to balance chemistry, depth, and pace. As Toronto prepares for the season opener, all eyes will be on how well Auston Matthews, Matthew Knies, and Domi mesh together. For now, the Maple Leafs’ emphasis on stability over heavy experimentation seems like a logical first step.Also Read: Montreal Canadiens waiver update: Sean Farrell and four others not claimed, assigned to Laval Rocket","Max domi projected to take first-line trial with auston matthews and matthew knies in toronto maple leafs’ lineup.

A brutal collision leaves Tyreek Hill facing a career-defining challenge

From dominance to uncertainty: what’s next for the Dolphins and the “Cheetah”?

Miami Dolphins wide receiver Tyreek Hill suffered a devastating knee injury on Monday Night Football, leaving fans and experts questioning his NFL future. With multiple torn ligaments confirmed, including an ACL tear, medical specialists warn the “Cheetah” may never return to his explosive form—or the league at all.The injury unfolded early in the second half of the Dolphins’ Week 5 matchup against the New York Jets. Tyreek Hill caught a pass from Tua Tagovailoa along the sideline before being tackled by defensive back Malachi Moore. In the process, Hill’s leg twisted awkwardly, leaving fans stunned as the star wideout writhed in pain.Initial reports described a dislocated knee, but ESPN’s Adam Schefter later confirmed the worst: Hill tore multiple ligaments, including his ACL. Dr. Jesse Morse, a respected sports medicine physician, did not hold back on the long-term implications.“At minimum, this is season-ending,” Morse explained. “But remember, Tyreek will be 32 in March. This is at least a 15-month recovery. That knocks him out not only for all of 2025, but possibly 2026 too.”For a player whose game is built on speed and agility, such an injury could be career-ending. Morse added, “I don’t know how many teams will be eager to sign Tyreek at 34 or 35, coming off a left knee dislocation and ACL tear at that age.”Hill, nicknamed “The Cheetah” for his unmatched speed, has long been one of the most feared weapons in football. Yet, this season had already started slowly—just 21 receptions, 256 yards, and one touchdown before the injury. Now, questions swirl over whether fans will ever again see the version of Hill who once left defenders in the dust.In a tearful hospital message, Hill pleaded with fans: “Keep your boy in your prayers.” His words shook the NFL community, with teammates and rivals alike expressing support on social media.Also Read: What happened to Tyreek Hill?

Losing Hill not only robs Tagovailoa of his most dynamic target but could also derail a Dolphins season that once held promise. For Hill himself, the challenge is even greater—proving that at 32, he can defy medical odds and rewrite his story after one of the most devastating injuries in recent NFL history.","Miami dolphins wide receiver tyreek hill suffered a devastating knee injury on monday night football.
