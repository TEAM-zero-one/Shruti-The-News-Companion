Nitish Kumar To Take CM Oath For Record 10th Time At Patna's Gandhi Maidan, PM Modi To Attend

Hectic parley on ministerial berth

NEW DELHI: Patna is set to witness a major political show of strength on Thursday, with JD(U) chief Nitish Kumar scheduled to take oath as chief minister for a record 10th time at the historic Gandhi Maidan. He resigned on Wednesday as head of the outgoing NDA government.Governor Arif Mohammad Khan accepted his resignation on Wednesday and asked him to continue as caretaker CM until the new government is sworn in.Kumar was elected leader of the NDA legislature party earlier in the day during a meeting of newly elected MLAs of the alliance partners. The proposal was moved by JD(U) senior leader Vijay Choudhary and seconded by BJP leaders Samrat Choudhary and Vijay Sinha. MLAs of the LJP (RV), HAM and RLM also supported the proposal, JD(U) minister Shrawon Kumar said.Soon after his election as NDA leader, Kumar visited Raj Bhavan with senior alliance leaders, including Union minister Chirag Paswan, RLM chief Upendra Kushwaha and Uttar Pradesh Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya, to submit his resignation and stake claim to form the new government. He is expected to hand over a formal letter of support from all NDA constituents to the governor before the oath ceremony.Several top leaders of the NDA are expected to attend the event at Gandhi Maidan, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union home minister Amit Shah, defence minister Rajnath Singh, Union minister Dharmendra Pradhan and chief ministers of various states.Consensus has also been reached among NDA partners on key positions. BJP’s Prem Kumar is likely to be the next Speaker of the assembly, while the post of Deputy Speaker is expected to go to the JD(U).Sources told news agency PTI the new Cabinet will feature five to six new faces from the two main constituents of the alliance, the BJP and the JD(U), along with representation for the smaller partners.LJP (RV) is likely to get three berths in the new Cabinet, while HAM and RLM are expected to receive one berth each. Up to 16 ministers from the BJP and 14 from the JD(U), including Nitish Kumar, are likely to be sworn in.From the JD(U) side, senior leaders such as Bijendra Prasad Yadav, Vijay Kumar Choudhary, Shrowan Kumar, Sunil Kumar, Lesi Singh, Sheila Mandal, Madan Sahni, Ratnesh Sada, Mohammad Zama Khan, Jayant Raj, Umesh Singh Kushwaha and Ashok Chowdhary are seen as strong contenders. Others in consideration include Rahul Kumar Singh, Sudhanshu Shekhar, Kaladhar Prasad Mandal and Panna Lal Singh Patel.BJP sources indicated that most ministers from the outgoing Cabinet will continue in their roles. These include Samrat Choudhary, Prem Kumar, Mangal Pandey, Vijay Kumar Sinha, Nitish Mishra, Renu Devi, Jibesh Kumar, Neeraj Kumar Singh, Janak Ram, Hari Sahni, Kedar Prasad Gupta, Surendra Mehta, Santosh Kumar Singh, Sunil Kumar and Motil Lal Prasad. The party is also weighing three new additions, including former IPS officer Anand Mishra, Rana Randhir, Gayatri Devi and Vijay Kumar Khemka.Nitish Kumar’s swearing-in today marks yet another turning point in Bihar politics as the NDA prepares to return to power with a fresh Cabinet and renewed equations among its partners.","Jd(u) chief nitish kumar scheduled to take oath as chief minister for a record 10th time.

Travis Kelce is soaking in a major win and this time, it has nothing to do with the scoreboard. The Kansas City Chiefs star is celebrating his fiancée Taylor Swift after her guest appearance on New Heights was named one of Apple’s top podcast episodes of 2025.

Let’s drop that sucker down.”The episode offered fans a rare, candid look into Swift’s life.

Potential Concerns

Will the Trade Actually Happen?

Thehave burst out to a strong 9-3 start, winning four of their last five games, but there’s still a noticeable gap in their backcourt. With Fred VanVleet sidelined for the entire 2025-26 season due to an ACL injury, Houston is operating without a true point guard - and that absence is shaping the conversation around the team’s long-term ceiling. Amen Thompson has stepped up admirably, yet the franchise ideally wants him back in his natural off-ball role, pushing the front office to explore creative options.That exploration has led to a surprising blockbuster trade idea: reuniting Kevin Durant with NBA champion Kyrie Irving. The concept, highlighted by CBS Sports’ Sam Quinn, suggests Houston could take advantage of Dallas’ uncertainty around Irving’s future while addressing its own need for a primary playmaker. With the Rockets already thriving without VanVleet and Dorian Finney-Smith yet to suit up, the proposal is gaining attention - especially with Irving expected to return later this season from his ACL setback.The Houston Rockets are navigating the season with Amen Thompson stepping into playmaking duties, but the organization ideally wants him back in his natural off-ball role. Meanwhile, VanVleet is expected to miss the entire 2025-26 season, leaving Houston without a veteran distributor.According to CBS Sports writer Sam Quinn, Kyrie Irving stands out as a surprisingly logical target given the Rockets’ roster construction and timeline. As Quinn wrote last Thursday, “Irving’s trade value is a total mystery. There’s really only one team that makes sense, and that’s Houston, where he could reunite with Kevin Durant.” (H/t: Sporting News)Irving is currently recovering from a torn ACL but is projected to return later this season - unlike VanVleet. Even with the risk, the potential reward of pairing Irving with Durant again is enough to generate intrigue for the surging Western Conference team.Here is the structure of the hypothetical deal outlined by Quinn, which brings significant star power to the Houston Rockets without heavy disruption to their rotation:Quinn notes that the Houston Rockets “wouldn’t really miss” Finney-Smith in this scenario since the veteran forward has yet to debut for Houston this year.Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving shared the court for 2.5 seasons with the Brooklyn Nets. Although their tenure fell short of championship expectations, the duo delivered some of the most electric basketball of the early 2020s.• Irving’s elite ball-handling and shot-making• Durant’s effortless scoring from all three levels• Their ability to take over games individually or interchangeably• Ratings-friendly, highlight-heavy playstyleThe Nets didn’t capture a title or even reach the Finals during their run, but few duos matched their entertainment value or scoring chemistry.• The Rockets are winning without a true point guard• VanVleet is sidelined all season• Irving is expected to return before the playoffs• Durant benefits from high-level shot creation next to him• The Western Conference race is tightening, making veteran experience valuableIf Houston continues its strong play deep into the season, taking a calculated swing on Irving could elevate the team into legitimate contender territory.• Irving’s health following ACL recovery• Contract commitment (three years remaining, $118 million)• Team chemistry with a young core• Fit alongside Durant in a new system• Long-term flexibility versus short-term upside• A true point guard with elite scoring ability• A proven playoff performer when healthy• Immediate pressure relieved from Amen Thompson• Championship-level tandem with Durant• Availability issues• Contract size• Risk of disrupting team rhythm• Defensive liabilities in certain matchupsEverything hinges on timing. If Houston maintains its momentum and Irving nears a healthy return, the franchise may find it worthwhile to “give the former Cleveland Cavaliers star a look on the trade market,” as the original article suggests.For now, the rumor exists as an intriguing hypothetical - one that connects an overachieving young team with two aging superstars who once formed one of the league’s must-watch duos.Also read: NBA trade rumors: Los Angeles Lakers could sign $54 million Dallas Mavericks superstar to for deadly duo with Luka Doncic And as Sam Quinn emphasized, “They’re not going to trade Irving just to trade him. They’d have to get something of substance.” Whether Houston decides to be that team will be one of the season’s most fascinating subplots.","The houston rockets are off to a strong 9-3 start, winning four of their last five games.

Brady Tkachuk expected to return soon as Ottawa Senators captain aims for Thanksgiving,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/brady-tkachuk-expected-to-return-soon-as-ottawa-senators-captain-aims-for-thanksgiving/articleshow/125440006.cms,"Brady Tkachuk (Image Via Twitter)

When will Brady Tkachuk be cleared to play again?

The comeback timeline of Brady Tkachuk is gradually becoming clearer, which makes the Ottawa Senators fans have a much better idea of their captain's possible return to the ring. After a long period of recovery steps and increasing his on-ice load, the 26-year-old seems to be nearing an important change in his situation. His rehabilitation, which has incorporated skating, sessions, and doctor visits, has been positive and is now crossing over to a more promising stage.The most recent news came out of the Wingmen podcast, released on Wednesday, where Tkachuk said that he is aiming for a return around the Thanksgiving holiday in the US. This is in accordance with Postmedia’s Bruce Garrioch, who mentioned earlier in the week that Tkachuk had gone to New York to see a hand specialist to get permission to increase the level of his activities. The seven-game road trip ahead of Ottawa puts more pressure on his schedule, with the games against the Vegas Golden Knights and St. Louis Blues falling right in the period he hopes to be back on the ice.Brady Tkachuk has not played 16 games since he had the surgery to fix a torn thumb ligament on October 16, an injury that was expected to take 6-8 weeks to heal.He mentioned in the podcast that there will be another doctor’s appointment in the next few days, and he is hoping to be declared “all clear” so he can start his full-intensity competition again. Before the injury, he had three assists in three games, having come from a 55-point season in 2024-25. At present, in his seventh NHL season, he has in total 191 goals and 407 points in 515 games, proving once again that he is one of the cornerstones of Ottawa’s roster.The Senators are currently in the fifth position of the Atlantic Division, but they are just three points behind Detroit, which is atop the division, so Tkachuk's expected return next week could extremely benefit the team in gaining momentum. If he is given the go-ahead as expected, his coming back may happen at the time when Ottawa needs its captain the most.Also Read: NHL Rumors: Insider reveals money tension rising in Matthew Knies deal as Maple Leafs struggle with cap space","Brady tkachuk has not played 16 games since he had the surgery to fix a torn thumb ligament.

NFL WAGs know how to make the most of their time together. Some throw lively parties, others organize fun celebrations, and a few even break a sweat side by side.

She joined fellow Bengals WAGs at Orangetheory Fitness Newport for a group workout session.

But just three months into his rookie year, his season took a tough turn.He suffered an ankle injury in Week 2 against the Jacksonville Jaguars, which kept him out for four games and delayed his return until Week 7. In Week 9 against the Chicago Bears, a knee injury led the team to place him on injured reserve, and he is expected to be out until at least Week 15.

Although she placed sixth in the 100m final, she stunned in the relay, playing a key role in Jamaica’s silver-medal finish behind Team USA. With eight Olympic medals and 17 World Championship medals, Fraser-Pryce has finished her career as one of the top sprinters.Her latest appearance at the World Cup qualifier proves that even after retiring, she still motivates and supports Jamaica, on the track, in the community, and now from the stands.Also Read: Olympics star Jordan Chiles reaches ‘Dancing with the Stars’ finale, calls out for votes ahead of grand showdown",Shelly-ann fraser-pryce attended jamaica's fifa world cup qualifier against curacao at independence park in kingston.

Braeden Bowman’s rise adds crucial edge to Golden Knights’ offensive setup



Rookie forward Braeden Bowman is rapidly becoming a story to watch in Vegas. In just his fourth NHL appearance, the 22-year-old delivered a crucial early goal against the New York Rangers, signalling a promising rise for the Golden Knights. His ability to read plays and react under pressure has given him an edge, especially on the power play, where he has already shown remarkable consistency.Bowman made his debut on November 13 against the Islanders and has since scored twice, both on the man advantage. Against Igor Shesterkin, he positioned himself perfectly to capitalise on a rebound after feeding Mitch Marner, one-timing the puck past the goaltender to put Vegas ahead. His previous goal in St. Louis also came on the power play, making him the fourth Golden Knight to score his first NHL goal on special teams. Impressively, his strike stood as a game-winner, making him just the fifth in franchise history to achieve this feat.Signed initially as an undrafted free agent, Bowman earned his AHL contract with Henderson in July 2024 before securing his entry-level deal with Vegas on March 3, 2025.His rapid progression reflects his strong work ethic and the Golden Knights’ ability to develop young talent effectively. Bowman’s early chemistry with experienced players like Marner hints at valuable long-term potential. His quick adaptation to NHL pace has impressed coaches and strengthened his case for increased ice time.With two power-play goals in just four games, Bowman is emerging as a reliable offensive option, particularly in high-pressure situations. His awareness around the net and ability to execute rebounds are proving valuable for a Vegas team pushing for consistent scoring depth. If his form continues, he could become one of the most impactful rookies of the season.Bowman’s journey from undrafted talent to early standout shows promise for the Golden Knights’ future. As his confidence builds and his role expands, Vegas may have uncovered a rising star ready to contribute when it matters most. If he continues developing at this pace, he could secure a key role for Vegas in the seasons ahead.Also Read: “Proud of YOU and US”: Brittany Lucic shares appreciation post for Milan Lucic on overcoming challenges two years after 2023 Boston case",Braeden bowman has scored two power-play goals in four games for vegas.

Dayton Raiola’s decommitment raises new questions about Dylan Raiola’s future at Nebraska

Dayton Raiola, a three-star quarterback from Georgia and the son of former Nebraska star Dominic Raiola, has stepped away from his long commitment to Nebraska. He made this move on Wednesday, just weeks before the 2026 signing period. His choice surprised many fans because he had been committed for more than a year and comes from a family deeply tied to the Nebraska football program.Dayton Raiola is also the younger brother of Nebraska quarterback Dylan Raiola and the nephew of offensive line coach Donovan Raiola. This family link made his commitment feel strong, so his decision to leave has raised new questions about what the Raiola family might be planning next.Dayton Raiola plays for Buford High School in Georgia, where he has led the team to an 11-0 record this season.He has completed 63% of his passes for 1,649 yards, 24 touchdowns, and only four interceptions, according to 247Sports.His only other reported offers are from Appalachian State and Charlotte. He shared his decommitment on Instagram on Wednesday, and the news spread quickly across Nebraska football circles.Right after the announcement, many fans wanted to know what this could mean for Dylan Raiola, who has been Nebraska’s starting quarterback since 2024.Dylan Raiola has thrown for 4,819 yards and 31 touchdowns in 22 starts. Nebraska is 13-9 with him under center, and he helped the team win its first bowl game in years.Dylan Raiola was having a big season under offensive coordinator Dana Holgorsen before he broke his fibula in the third quarter of a game against UCLA. He had surgery the next week and has been recovering.Some people wonder if Dayton Raiola decommitted because Dylan might consider a move once he is healthy.Dylan has transferred multiple times before college, and he also decommitted from Ohio State and Georgia before choosing Nebraska. Others believe Dayton simply saw too much quarterback depth at Nebraska.The room already includes Dylan Raiola, TJ Lateef, and Marcos Davila. Another top quarterback, Trae Taylor from Illinois, is also committed for 2027.Also Read: “A Healthy Amount Of Bullying”: Jonas Brothers Hilariously Tell Jason Kelce The Secret To Working With His Brother Travis Kelce Nebraska now has nine commits in the 2026 class, led by four-star cornerback Danny Odem and four-star tackle Claude Mpouma.The group also includes wide receivers Nalin Scott and Larry Miles, tight end Luke Sorensen, running back Jamal Rule, offensive linemen Hayden Ainsworth and Rex Waterman, and linebacker Jase Reynolds.","Dayton raiola, a three-star quarterback from georgia, decommitted from nebraska on wednesday.

Maple Leafs lose Matthew Knies and Auston Matthews to injury, depth under pressure



The Toronto Maple Leafs are heading into a critical stretch of the season with mounting concerns, as another key forward joins the injury list. First, it was superstar Auston Matthews, and now Matthew Knies has been ruled day-to-day with a lower-body issue after missing Tuesday’s 3-2 overtime win against the St. Louis Blues. The timing couldn’t be worse, with Toronto already trying to regain form following their longest winless streak since April 2021.Knies had featured in all 19 games before the setback, recording five goals and ranking third on the team with 22 points. His consistency and early-season impact have made him a vital contributor to Toronto’s offensive structure. Losing both Knies and Matthews has raised serious questions about roster depth, especially as the team fights to build momentum despite injury disruptions.TSN Hockey Insider Chris Johnston confirmed that Knies now joins an expanding injury list also featuring Matthews, Nicolas Roy, Scott Laughton, Chris Tanev, Brandon Carlo, and goaltender Anthony Stolarz. Head coach Craig Berube acknowledged the growing concern but stressed the importance of a ""next man up” mentality to keep the team competitive. His message comes at a time when Toronto needs immediate contributions from replacement players if they are to maintain their standing in the Eastern Conference.Despite the adversity, the Maple Leafs secured a much-needed breakthrough win, with William Nylander scoring the overtime winner to snap their five-game slump. However, the celebration was tempered by Knies’ absence, which further highlights the urgency of his recovery. Toronto’s forward depth will be under scrutiny in the coming games, as the team seeks consistency without two of its most reliable performers.The Maple Leafs will keep a close watch on Knies’ recovery as they look to prevent any early-season setback. A swift return would provide a major boost to their offensive balance, but for now, Toronto must push through November with grit and adaptability. With injuries mounting and pressure increasing, their response in the upcoming fixtures could define momentum heading into a crucial mid-season phase. Every game from this point forward will be vital in maintaining their playoff chances and stabilising team morale.Also Read: Matthew Schaefer turning heads in 2025 NHL season: Could he become the next Cale Makar?","Matthew knies has been ruled day-to-day with a lower-body issue.

“Last week Joe Burrow told me he’s returning wayyyy sooner than was expected and gave me the timeline of ‘Thanksgiving-ish.’ Now, will start practicing on a limited basis. Absolutely unreal attack of rehab and response. At first, medical people didn’t believe he’d be back before the playoffs. Huggggge jump for him! He’s a G!”

“First of all, Joe Burrow told me that 12 days ago, that would be two months ahead of schedule. Just absolutely ridiculous. So this week, Joe Burrow actually practiced. He just did 7-on-7. Yesterday he texted me saying, ‘Felt great. Let’s see how this week goes.’ This week, they’re gonna move him up to do 11-on-11. And then they’re just gonna see how he progresses. But two months early? He’s a gangster!”

“The Bengals record in their last 16 games when Joe Burrow is starting: 7-1. Their record when someone that is not Joe Burrow is starting: 1-7.”

Joe Burrow was projected to miss at least three months

More coverage on Joe Burrow:

In just one whirlwind week, NFL Insider Jay Glazer’s updates on Joe Burrow have gone from shock and awe at his Thanksgiving-ish comeback timeline to marveling at Burrow’s leap into 7-on-7 drills and texting about feeling great. Now, Burrow is already gearing up for 11-on-11 action, leaving everyone stunned at his two-months-early progress. Glazer can barely keep up with Burrow’s relentless drive.So, Glazer goes from this:on November 11 to this:on November 16.Meanwhile, SleeperBengals recently released a tweet with not-so-shocking facts:At the beginning of the season, despite being known for slow starts, Burrow led the Cincinnati Bengals to a 2-0 start. Now they have gone 1-3 without him under Jake Browning, who was Burrow’s backup, and 1-4 under Joe Flacco, who was acquired from the Cleveland Browns.Back in September, when Burrow had missed two of four games, Mike Moraitis of The Sporting News shared an injury update. Burrow had a serious case of turf toe, a Grade 3 issue that required surgery and a long absence from the field. NFL Insider Ian Rapoport then reported that the 28-year-old quarterback would miss at least three months.“They’re saying three months, I don’t see three months being an actual timeline,” Glazer said in September via The Sporting News. “I think more or so (Burrow has) a chance (to return) if they make the playoffs, but only because it’s Burrow. Somebody else, I’d say no. But he has a Mamba Mentality, maybe yes. It’s such a difficult injury to return from.”Cut to the present: Glazer is thrilled to announce that Burrow may return two months earlier than expected!

More NFL coverage

Even though Matt Ryan hung up his cleats last year, the former Atlanta Falcons quarterback hasn’t exactly disappeared from football fans’ view. The 40-year-old has been everywhere, analyzing film and breaking down storylines on CBS’s pregame desk, joining a podcast with ex-Rams star Aaron Donald and longtime Atlanta reporter Zach Klein, and giving his unique insight into the league.Ryan’s connection to the Falcons remains strong. During the 2024 season, he mentored Michael Penix Jr., guiding the rookie through his first year as the team’s starter. Even in retirement, Ryan is clearly invested in helping the next generation of quarterbacks thrive. Now, he’s stepping away from the pregame desk for a bit to join the NFL Christmas Gameday broadcast, giving fans another reason to tune in over the holidays.The NFL recently unveiled its Christmas Day schedule, and Netflix is back in the mix for the second year in a row. The streaming platform will air the first two games of the holiday triple-header, starting with the Dallas Cowboys at the Washington Commanders at 1 p.m. ET, followed by the Detroit Lions at the Minnesota Vikings at 4:30 p.m. Matt Ryan will serve as a game analyst, joining CBS Sports’ Ian Eagle and Nate Burleson in the booth for the Cowboys-Commanders matchup.This allows him to remain front and center in the NFL world while providing fans with his perspective as one of the most accomplished quarterbacks of the last 15 years.Despite still being in excellent shape, Ryan has made it clear that returning to play is not on his agenda. Ahead of the Week 8 game between the Cincinnati Bengals and New York Jets, he joked with sideline reporter Aditi Kinkhabwala about picking up tips from Joe Flacco, another 40-year-old quarterback still active in the league.Kinkhabwala passed along Flacco’s advice: “Drink more water.” The moment drew laughs on the broadcast, and some even speculated that teams might be curious about Ryan making a return. But he quickly ended the conversation. “I’m good,” he said, smiling as he shut the door on the idea.For now, Ryan is focused on sharing his knowledge from the broadcast booth, mentoring young quarterbacks, and keeping fans engaged with his expert analysis. While he’s no longer taking snaps on Sundays, Matt Ryan is still very much a visible, respected voice in the NFL, proving that retirement doesn’t mean stepping away from the game entirely.","Former atlanta falcons quarterback matt ryan will join the nfl christmas gameday broadcast.
