Charlie Kirk’s assassination has shocked the world and now, his old controversial comments about Taylor Swift have resurfaced. While Taylor Swift has remained silent about it, Charlie Kirk’s wife and his business partner, Erika Kirk, has dragged in the billionaire pop star into the drama again. This has sparked outrage among fans.A few hours ago, right wing podcast host and an employee of Charlie Kirk’s organisation, Turning Point USA, Alex Clark made a post on X that read as, ""Last night Erika gave us specific direction: 'I want the Taylor Swift concert to look like nothing compared to this.' As a Swiftie I know what that means and what the challenge is. Buy your flights.

The India-Pakistan Asia Cup Super Four clash in Dubai delivered yet another spicy moment when Abhishek Sharma and Haris Rauf locked horns in the middle, forcing the umpire to intervene.The incident unfolded in the fifth over of India’s chase. Shubman Gill, already looking in fine touch, faced Rauf’s short-of-a-length delivery outside off.With minimal fuss, Gill swivelled and short-arm jabbed the ball wide of mid-wicket, splitting the gap perfectly for four.The stroke raced away to the fence, intensifying pressure on Pakistan’s premier fast bowler.But instead of the camera following Gill’s brilliance, attention quickly shifted to the non-striker’s end.Abhishek Sharma and Rauf were seen exchanging words, with tempers flaring enough for on-field umpire Gazi Sohel to step in between the two.Though the microphones didn’t capture the exact words, the animated body language told its own story, with the young Indian opener refusing to back down and the fiery Pakistani quick just as unwilling to let things slide.Watch:This latest exchange came on the heels of earlier flashpoints involving India’s openers and Pakistan’s fast bowlers.Abhishek had already rattled Shaheen Afridi with a first-ball six followed by a verbal jab, while Gill had pointed out the direction of a boundary after cutting loose against the left-arm spearhead.By the time Rauf got involved, the rivalry had gone well beyond bat and ball.For India, these charged-up moments underlined a fearless approach in chasing 172, Pakistan’s highest T20I total against them batting first. For Pakistan, the visible frustration of their frontline bowlers hinted at how rattled they were by India’s aggressive start.The Dubai crowd roared with every boundary and every heated exchange, as the India-Pakistan rivalry once again proved that in this fixture, the cricket is inseparable from the emotion.",Abhishek sharma and haris rauf involved in heated face-off.

What did Suryakumar Yadav, Kuldeep Yadav and others say on playing Pakistan? | Asia Cup 2025

The India-Pakistan Asia Cup Super Four clash in Dubai erupted with early drama as India’s openers Abhishek Sharma and Shubman Gill both went after Pakistan’s premier fast bowler Shaheen Afridi — with the bat and with words.The fireworks began on the very first ball of the chase.Shaheen went short, angling it into Abhishek, who swivelled, caught a top edge on the pull, and watched the ball sail over fine leg for six.Instead of walking away, Abhishek turned towards the bowler and had a few words, setting the stage for a charged contest.But the tension didn’t end there.Two overs later, Gill joined the act. Dancing down the track to a length delivery outside off, he smashed Shaheen past extra cover for four.The shot screamed authority, but what followed lit up the moment even more, Gill pointed with his hand in the direction where the ball sped away, almost as if to remind Shaheen exactly how cleanly he had been struck.The Pakistan pacer, visibly irritated, chose not to engage and simply turned his back.These fiery exchanges added to an already high-stakes chase after Pakistan had posted 171/5, their highest total against India when batting first in T20Is.Sahibzada Farhan’s half-century and Faheem Ashraf’s late burst powered the innings, while India’s sloppy fielding — including four dropped catches — only piled on frustration.For Abhishek, who had been guilty of two dropped chances in the field, the intent to counter-attack was both a redemption arc and a statement of confidence.With Gill backing him up in equal measure, India’s openers not only provided a brisk start but also sent a clear message: Shaheen Afridi, Pakistan’s strike weapon, would not have it easy tonight.","Abhishek sharma, shubman gill slap shaheen afridi with fiery exchanges.

Who is Chelsea Wolfe: Past controversies, clashes with US cycling and Olympic journey

Chelsea Wolfe, a transgender BMX freestyle rider from Florida, is facing huge backlash after celebrating the murder of Charlie Kirk. On September 10, 2025, Charlie Kirk, the 31-year-old conservative activist, was shot and killed while giving a speech at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah.

In one post, she wrote:In another story, she compared Kirk again to a Nazi, saying:The posts drew swift attention.

She made history in June 2021 by qualifying as the first openly transgender athlete for Team USA at the Tokyo Olympics, where she was listed as an alternate in women’s BMX freestyle.But Wolfe has long courted controversy. Back in 2021, she wrote on Facebook: “My goal is to win the Olympics so I can burn a US flag on the podium.” In interviews with Fox News, she later said she did not hate the country but wanted to stand against “fascism.”Also Read: Andre Agassi And Steffi Graf’s Son Jaden Agassi Shares Unseen Photos With Catherine Holt As Couple Celebrates Love Her BMX career ended in July 2023 when the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) banned transgender women from competing in women’s events.Chelsea Wolfe admitted the rule change left her heartbroken and said she was on “suicide watch” during that time.

Meanwhile, in the WNBA's opinion, that second remark probably deserved a fine.Clark, however, has been out since July 15 due to a groin injury.Later, Clark's teammate, Sophie Cunningham reposted Clark's post and joked that someone ought to start a fundraising to help Clark cover the fee. Cunningham wrote:""That’s gonna really break the bank for her.

NFL issues warning: No protection for players joining Tom Brady’s Saudi flag football game,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/nfl-issues-warning-no-protection-for-players-joining-tom-bradys-saudi-flag-football-game/articleshow/124022729.cms,"The NFL has cautioned players about participating in Tom Brady's flag football event in Saudi Arabia. The league clarifies it does not endorse the event. Player injuries during the event will not receive NFL benefits. Star players like Saquon Barkley and Rob Gronkowski are expected to participate. This raises concerns about career risks versus global sport promotion.

NFL warns players of consequences without league backing

Star power adds intrigue, but risks loom large

The NFL has sent a clear message to its players: think twice before stepping onto the field for Tom Brady’s upcoming flag football showcase in Saudi Arabia. Despite the excitement surrounding the March 2026 event, the league is distancing itself from the exhibition, warning players that participation carries risks outside official protections.According to a memo circulated to all 32 teams, the NFL emphasized that it “will not be part of Saudi exhibition game” and reminded organizations that player involvement requires written approval. The league clarified, “This Event is not an NFL-sanctioned event, and the league has no role in the organization or production of the game.”More critically, the statement highlighted that “any injury sustained while participating in the Event will be considered a Non-Football Injury.” In plain terms, this means no salary protection, no insurance coverage, and no team responsibility if a star player gets hurt while competing. For athletes whose livelihoods depend on their health, that’s a high-stakes gamble.Still, the roster Brady has assembled is hard to ignore. Saquon Barkley, Christian McCaffrey, CeeDee Lamb, Maxx Crosby, Sauce Gardner, Myles Garrett, George Kittle, Fred Warner, and Rob Gronkowski are among the headliners expected to play.The event mirrors the Olympic-style format set to debut at the 2028 Los Angeles Games, adding to its prestige and appeal.For many players, the Saudi tournament represents more than an exhibition—it’s a chance to grow the sport globally and share the field with icons in a lighter, faster-paced version of football. Yet the NFL’s firm stance introduces a sobering reality: athletes may have to weigh personal ambition against career security.Also Read: Controversial Josh Allen kneeldown sparks Dolphins–NFL discussions, Mike McDaniel believes ball was fumbled With Brady and Gronk bringing their star power back into the spotlight, fans are eager to see history in the making.

Brittany and Patrick Mahomes’ stylish date night at 1587 Prime



1587 Prime: A new Kansas City dining experience



It was a stylish night out for Patrick Mahomes and his wife, Brittany, as the couple enjoyed an intimate evening at Kansas City’s newest hotspot, 1587 Prime. The steakhouse, co-owned by the Chiefs quarterback and his teammate Travis Kelce , has quickly become the talk of the town. For the Mahomes, it wasn’t just dinner — it was a celebration of milestones, family, and new beginnings.On Friday, Sept. 19, Brittany Mahomes, 30, gave fans a glimpse of their outing by posting mirror selfies from inside the restaurant. She wore a chic denim minidress with a slim belt, matching heels, and a black handbag, while Patrick, also 30, kept it bold in a striped Louis Vuitton shirt, dark pants, and sneakers. The outing gave the couple a rare evening away from their three children — Sterling, 4, Bronze, 2, and Golden, just 8 months old.The evening held extra meaning, as the steakhouse had officially opened its doors on Sept. 17, aligning with Patrick’s 30th birthday. Days earlier, the couple had already marked the milestone with friends after the Chiefs’ home game. Guests included country star Kane Brown, his wife Katelyn, Travis Kelce, and Taylor Swift , who all posed together inside the elegant space.Brittany shared a heartfelt tribute to her husband on Instagram, writing, “Happy 30th Birthday!!! You are so special to us, and we love you to forever and beyond!” She added, “The way you love us is so comforting, and the way you go about life is just so inspiring! Keep being YOU 🤍.”The steakhouse isn’t just another upscale eatery. Its name pays homage to Mahomes’ and Kelce’s jersey numbers, 15 and 87. The menu highlights classic favorites, including steaks, lobster tails, wild king salmon, and chicken parmesan, while the cocktail list adds a playful twist. Drinks like “Showtime” and “The Big Yeti” nod to the star athletes’ nicknames, while “Queen B” and “Alchemy” give a toast to Brittany and Taylor Swift.With its blend of fine dining, celebrity buzz, and personal touches, 1587 Prime has already become more than a restaurant.

The Kansas City Chiefs face a pivotal challenge on Sunday Night Football as they take on the New York Giants in a must-win battle to avoid an 0-3 start. While Patrick Mahomes leads his team on the road under the bright lights of MetLife Stadium, his wife Brittany Mahomes is tackling her own demanding game plan at home with their three children.Brittany, who has been a constant presence cheering on her husband, recently showed fans a glimpse of her lively household. In an Instagram Stories video, she revealed a movie theater room scattered with toys as daughter Sterling, 4, and son Bronze, 2, turned it into what looked like a playground. “Every room in our house has turned into a playground,” Brittany joked, giving followers a candid look at life behind the scenes.This isn’t the first time the Mahomes kids have taken center stage. From Bronze diving into a ball pit to mom and dad setting up elaborate obstacle courses, the couple often embraces the chaos. Just last week, Brittany stunned in a red crop top at the Chiefs’ home opener while cradling baby Golden, then switched gears to celebrate Patrick’s 30th birthday at 1587 Prime Steakhouse—his new Kansas City restaurant with Travis Kelce—where she even snapped a memorable photo with Taylor Swift.Kansas City Chiefs battle pressure in must-win matchupWhile Brittany manages the whirlwind at home, Patrick Mahomes and Andy Reid are facing one of the toughest stretches of their careers. The Chiefs are 0-2 for the first time in Mahomes’ eight seasons as the starting quarterback. Counting their Super Bowl loss to the Philadelphia Eagles, Kansas City has now dropped three straight games—something that has never happened under Mahomes.The challenge grows bigger against a fired-up Giants crowd, but history shows the Chiefs rarely stay down for long. Much like the Patriots dynasty under Bill Belichick and Tom Brady, the Mahomes-Reid duo remains a constant Super Bowl threat as long as the quarterback stays healthy and the head coach keeps leading.As Patrick tries to steady the Chiefs on the field, Brittany is proving that sometimes the toughest job isn’t under the stadium lights—it’s keeping order in a house full of toddlers.Also Read: Pregnant Cardi B fiercely addresses paternity drama surrounding Stefon Diggs with unapologetic message to critics",Brittany mahomes shares playful chaos inside family home with her three children.

Chargers running back Najee Harris suffers non-contact injury



Harris’ career achievements and impact



Los Angeles Chargers running back Najee Harris was carted off the field in the second quarter of Sunday’s game against the Denver Broncos after suffering a concerning lower left leg injury. The 27-year-old went down in a non-contact situation at SoFi Stadium, leaving both teammates and fans holding their breath as he was ruled out for the remainder of the game.The moment unfolded as Harris planted his left leg while preparing to take a handoff in the backfield. Almost immediately, he collapsed to the turf in visible pain and was unable to get up. Medical staff rushed to his side before he was carted away, unable to put weight on his leg. Later, the Chargers announced he had sustained an ankle injury.It was another tough setback for Harris, who had already dealt with adversity this year. He missed much of the offseason while recovering from an eye injury caused by a fireworks accident on July 4. Despite limited training camp participation, Harris was cleared in time for the regular season and had shown flashes of promise before Sunday’s scare.Prior to exiting the game, he recorded six carries for 28 yards, adding to his season total of 61 yards on 15 carries and three receptions for 25 yards.Harris has built a reputation as a reliable workhorse since entering the league. A first-round draft pick out of Alabama, he was selected by the Pittsburgh Steelers in 2021 and earned Pro Bowl honors in his rookie season. Over five NFL seasons with the Steelers and Chargers, Harris has logged 4,373 rushing yards, 28 touchdowns, and 183 receptions for 1,174 yards with six additional scores.His consistent production and ability to carry an offense make his absence a huge concern for the Chargers. While the team awaits further updates, the hope is that this injury is not as severe as it initially appeared. For now, fans will be watching closely, hoping Harris can return to the field and continue the career that has already made him one of the league’s most dependable backs.Also Read: Patrick Mahomes and wife Brittany turn heads during date night at his and Travis Kelce’s new dining venture",Najee harris was carted off the field in the second quarter of sunday's game against the denver broncos.

VJ Edgecombe met NBA legend Dwyane Wade at Aramis launch in a surreal moment before 2025–26 season





Dwyane Wade joins Aramis as global ambassador as Gabrielle Union-Wade shares photos on social media

At the Aramis launch event in Bloomingdale this week, rookie guard VJ Edgecombe of the Philadelphia 76ers had an amazing experience. During the same, he connected with Dwyane Wade , a player he was compared to prior to the draft. Wade has been collaborating with Aramis, an Estée Lauder fragrance brand, as part of his off-court commercial endeavors. Images that Edgecombe met Wade at the Aramis launch event have recently gone viral on social media as well.The Philadelphia 76ers wanted to improve their lineup for the upcoming season after the 2024-25 NBA season ended in disappointment. In the 2025 NBA draft, they chose VJ Edgecombe with the third overall pick.Edgecombe was regarded as one of the best players in the 2024 class and a five-star prospect by most. He started getting attention shortly after he joined the league as Benedict Mathurin made headlines by disparaging him before his NBA debut.During his first summer league match against the Utah Jazz, VJ Edgecombe left a mark even after reportedly facing hate speech. The 76ers fans eagerly awaited him during the 2025–2026 NBA season. Edgecombe, however, got a chance to meet a legend before the season started.He met NBA legend Dwyane Wade at the widely shared Aramis launch, according to the social media images that went viral. Wade and Aramis work together on his off-court commercial endeavors. Seeing him at the launch ceremony was expected, but for Edgecombe, it was surreal.The Hall of Famer was present there because he has been aggressively building his post-NBA portfolio through ownership, sponsorships, and the media. However, it was a full-circle introduction for Edgecombe Edgecombe had been compared with D-Wade. Wade was a skilled scorer who could dominate in crucial situations and create the half-court when he first joined the NBA. In contrast, Edgecombe remains undeveloped in areas such as creating shots, pulling up shots, and managing significant offensive responsibilities. Nevertheless, he is talented and with right guidance and enough practice, he can actually be like Wade.NBA legend Dwyane Wade made news last month when it was announced that he would be the new face of the high-end fragrance line Aramis. Gabrielle Union-Wade , his actress wife, then posted a touching Instagram story that captured his husband's recent achievement.During an event of Aramis, the couple were dressed in matching black and white outfits. The event took place three months after the NBA icon announced that he will serve as Aramis' global ambassador.Later, during an interview, while talking about it, D-Wade said:“As a young boy, you’re very impressionable. And I was impressed by my father and my uncles growing up.. I saw them do [it] every time they got ready: when they got fresh, they hit themselves with the cologne before they walked out the door. I used to wear my dad’s cologne when I was a kid—it was way too strong for me back then.”Aramis and the player also collaborated on the campaign's artistic direction.Also read: Gabrielle Union shares Instagram story in matching outfits with Dwyane Wade to celebrate his Aramis debut","Philadelphia 76ers rookie guard vj edgecombe met nba legend dwyane wade at aramis launch.

Beware Pakistan! Abhishek Sharma hits massive sixes in the nets

Fire, fury, and fireworks

Pakistan cash in on India’s sloppy fielding

""The best mirror is an old friend,” is a classical line by famous English poet George Herbert.Those lines seemed to have been written for Shubman Gill and Abhishek Sharma when the duo were batting together against Pakistan in their Super 4s clash at the Dubai International Stadium on Sunday.Gill and Abhishek were matching each other shot-for-shot and put on 105-runs for the opening wicket.On the eve of yet another highly-anticipated India vs Pakistan clash, only three Indian cricketers turned up for the optional practice session. Shubman Gill and Abhishek were two of them. Gill was struggling for runs, and it was Abhishek who lent him the comforting arm . He bowled in tandem with the net bowlers for an hour to Shubman. He challenged him to play sweep shots, teased his inability to hit the reverse sweep, and requested Varun Chakravarthy to trouble Gill with his variations. A day later, the duo, who have batted together since their U-12 days in Punjab , were at their destructive best.Chasing a stiff target of 172, India’s chase got off to a fiery start as Abhishek Sharma and Shubman Gill smashed a 100-run stand in just 8.4 overs. If Abhishek was at his destructive best, it was Gill who showed why he is such a delight to the eyes. In an expected high-voltage clash, which became even more dramatic due to the events of the past weeks , the Pakistani seamers Shaheen Shah Afridi and Haris Rauf started to abuse them in Punjabi. Shaheen had a go at Abhishek after being smacked for a six off the first ball.Shaheen then hurled a few abuses at Shubman, who looked at Shaheen and pointed with his hand where the ball went. There was a shade of Aamer Sohail vs Venky Prasad from 1996 to it. Haris Rauf hurled abuses at Abhishek, who hammered him for two boundaries, and the umpires had to intervene to separate Rauf and Abhishek.Abhishek set the tone by pulling Shaheen Afridi for a six off the very first over, while Gill, who had worked tirelessly in the nets on the eve of the match, struck boundaries with authority off Saim Ayub's off-spin. Their aggression only grew, with Abhishek dispatching Abrar Ahmed for towering sixes and Gill unfurling a reverse sweep — a stroke his partner had teased him about less than 24 hours ago.Abhishek raced to a 25-ball fifty, surviving two dropped chances along the way, while Gill kept the tempo high with crisp drives and sweeps. The partnership was finally broken at 105 when Gill, after battling cramps, was bowled by Faheem Ashraf for a brisk 47 off 28.India’s openers had set the chase alight with their fearless strokeplay and fiery exchanges, leaving Pakistan searching for answers. Abhishek departed for a sizzling 39-ball 74.India did lose quick wickets - Gill and then Suryakumar Yadav in the space of four balls - but it was too late for Pakistan. India chased down the total in 18.5 overs with six wickets in hand.India’s fielding woes came to the fore as they spilled five chances, allowing Pakistan to post a competitive 171/5.Sahibzada Farhan, the biggest beneficiary, rode his luck to a breezy half-century after being dropped twice by Abhishek Sharma.Abhishek first misjudged a regulation chance at third man when Farhan was on zero. The opener made India pay with crisp strokeplay, taking on Jasprit Bumrah for two boundaries and carting Varun Chakravarthy for back-to-back fours. He even finished the powerplay with two more boundaries off Bumrah as Pakistan raced to 55/1 after six overs.Farhan’s second life came in Varun’s over when Abhishek, stationed at long-on, covered ground to his right and leapt full stretch but failed to hold on, palming the ball over the ropes for six. The right-hander didn’t look back, slamming Kuldeep Yadav and Axar Patel for towering sixes to bring up his fifty, and his celebration took you back to MS Dhoni's first hundred against Pakistan.At 91/1 in 10 overs, Pakistan looked in control before Shivam Dube’s golden arm turned things around. He broke the 72-run stand by deceiving Saim Ayub with a slower one; this time Abhishek made amends with a diving catch running in from deep square. Dube then accounted for Farhan with another slower ball, Surya Yadav holding his nerve despite the batter’s bat flying out of his hands mid-shot.Kuldeep tightened the screws as Pakistan endured 21 balls without a boundary. Hussain Talat fell cheaply before skipper Salman Ali Agha ended the boundary drought, which lasted for 37 balls, with a six off the first ball of the 17th over. Dube’s fine spell, however, was blemished when Nawaz plundered 17 runs. Nawaz was then found napping as he didn’t plant his bat in the crease and Surya’s direct hit connected on the bounce.Fielding lapses continued to haunt India. Shubman Gill spilled a sitter at deep mid-wicket, giving Faheem Ashraf a reprieve. Bumrah endured a rare off day, finishing wicketless for 45 runs in his four overs. Pakistan eventually closed at 171/5, aided by India’s butterfingers as Faheem’s late six came off yet another dropped chance, this time the culprit was Shivam Dube, who misjudged a catch at the third-man region.For India, despite the five missed opportunities, their bowlers kept Pakistan in check, but the lack of discipline in the field left the contest delicately poised heading into the chase.","Abhishek sharma and shubman gill put on 100-run stand in just 8.4 overs. Pakistan seamers shaheen shah afridi and haris rauf started to abuse them in punjabi. India chased down the total in 18.5 overs with six wickets in hand.

'My job is to play': Haris Rauf stays calm as Pakistan ride out Asia Cup drama

WACTH:

NEW DELHI: The high-octane India vs Pakistan clash in the Asia Cup 2025 Super Four in Dubai on Sunday, did not just serve up a six-wicket win for India — it also delivered fresh controversy. Pakistan pacer Haris Rauf found himself in the middle of a storm after he taunted Indian fans with a provocative “6-0” gesture near the boundary ropes, a moment that has since gone viral on social media.The gesture, captured in multiple videos and photos, showed Rauf raising his hand to signal “6-0,” a reference to Pakistan’s unverified and politically charged claims of downing six Indian fighter jets during a four-day military scuffle following Operation Sindoor. During the match at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium, the pacer even acted out the motion of a crashing plane, further fuelling tensions.The incident unfolded while Rauf was fielding close to a packed Indian section of the crowd. Fans had been chanting “Kohli, Kohli” to rile him up, a reminder of Virat Kohli’s iconic straight six off his bowling in the T20 World Cup 2022. In response, the 31-year-old pacer gestured towards them with the controversial signal, triggering loud boos from Indian supporters and sparking outrage online.The cricket, however, was dominated by India. Chasing 172, Abhishek Sharma hammered a blistering 74 off just 39 balls, including six fours and five towering sixes. His 105-run opening stand with Shubman Gill (47) laid the perfect platform, as Tilak Varma (30*) and Hardik Pandya (7*) sealed the win in 18.5 overs.On-field tensions between Rauf and Indian players also flared. In the fifth over, after Gill cracked a crisp boundary, Rauf exchanged heated words with Abhishek Sharma, forcing umpire Gazi Sohel to step in.

How Shubman Gill is getting ready for Pakistan challenge in Asia Cup

Poll Should the Indian players have shaken hands with their Pakistani counterparts after the match? Yes, it's a sportsmanlike gesture No, tensions are too high

The handshake controversy between India and Pakistan refused to die down on Sunday, with Indian players once again walking past their opponents without doing the customary gesture at the Asia Cup Super Four clash in Dubai.The incident mirrored what unfolded in the group-stage meeting a week earlier, when India captain Suryakumar Yadav had avoided shaking hands with Pakistan skipper Salman Agha at the toss.That moment had sparked heated discussion among fans and media, with questions raised about whether the tension would spill over into their next encounter.At the toss this time, Suryakumar ignored Agha once again, heading directly to commentator Ravi Shastri before greeting match referee Andy Pycroft. The Indian captain later said, “We are going to bowl first. It is a good pitch. Some dew came during our practice session last night. I am really looking forward to this game. Jasprit Bumrah comes back, Varun Chakaravarthy also comes back in for Harshit Rana and Arshdeep Singh. ”The absence of a handshake at the end of the game drew even more attention. After completing the chase, India batters Tilak Varma and Hardik Pandya turned towards their dressing room and headed straight to the team camp, skipping the traditional handshake with the Pakistan players.To make things even more tense, Indian players headed out of the dressing room after the win, started to walk towards the Pakistani players, only to shake hands with the umpires and match officials and turn back.India, thanks to an aggressive chase, won the game in style, with Tilak Varma hitting the winning four, meaning India won by six wickets and with 7 balls to spare. The 172-run target set by Pakistan proved to be too less to avoid a second defeat to the defending Asia Cup champions.Ahead of the clash, Suryakumar had already faced questions about the issue during a press conference, though he deflected them. When asked indirectly about whether India’s “no-handshake” stance would continue, he replied: “What other things are you talking about? You are talking about our performance with the ball? It is a good contest between bat and ball. The whole stadium is packed to the rafters. The best thing is to put your best foot forward and do the best for your country. ”The episode made sure that the spotlight stayed on the off-field tensions, even as the cricket itself provided its own drama. The handshake row has now become one of the biggest talking points of the Asia Cup 2025, and shows no signs of fading.",India beat pakistan by six wickets in the asia cup super four clash.

How Shubman Gill is getting ready for Pakistan challenge in Asia Cup

Poll Who should be credited as the standout player in India's victory over Pakistan? Abhishek Sharma Suryakumar Yadav Shivam Dube Shubman Gill

India maintained their dominance over Pakistan in this Asia Cup , defeating their arch-rivals by six wickets in the Super Four clash on Sunday. Opener Abhishek Sharma led the charge with a blazing 74, putting on a record 105-run opening stand with Shubman Gill as India chased down 172 with seven balls to spare.The contest was played under tense conditions following the handshake controversy from their previous group-stage meeting, but Suryakumar Yadav, India’s captain, focused on the on-field performance rather than off-field drama.Speaking to reporters after the win, Suryakumar downplayed the idea of a rivalry. “You guys should stop asking questions about the rivalry between India-Pakistan. According to me, if two teams play 15-20 matches, and if it is even, then it is a rivalry. 10-0, 10-1, I don't know what the stat is, but this is not a rivalry anymore. I think we played better cricket than them (Pakistan), and also from a bowling point of view,” he said, referring to India’s dominant head-to-head record in T20Is, which now stands at 12-3.India faced some fielding challenges during Pakistan’s innings, with several catches dropped early on. The captain joked about the errors, saying, “I think the fielding coach has already emailed players whose hands had some butter on them.It’s good that this happened early on because we have more crucial games going forward.” He also rejected the idea that floodlights were to blame. “Floodlights can’t be an excuse. ”Abhishek Sharma’s innings was the highlight of the chase. Yadav praised the opener’s composure and game awareness: “He is very selfless. He can bat in the same way after the powerplay. But he analyses it beautifully. He is learning every day.”He also showered praise on the opening duo, saying, ""They are ice and fire. They complement each other very well.""On the team’s strategy, he explained the decision to field first after winning the toss: “When we played on the 14th, the wicket was better from the batting point of view. The wicket has improved.”India’s bowling heroics also received praise, with Shivam Dube’s four overs turning the match in India’s favour. “Shivam Dube’s spell was the turning point. He bowled his entire quota and he was very happy,” Yadav added. Dube claimed key wickets of Pakistan opener Sahibzada Farhan and Saim Ayub to dampen the flow of runs early in the innings.The win not only strengthened India’s position in the Super Four but also showed the balance between power-hitting and bowling in their squad, with Suryakumar choosing to focus on performance over rivalry.",Suryakumar yadav said that there is no 'rivalry' anymore with pakistan. He pointed to india's level of dominance and winning record against them. India beat pakistan by six wickets in the super four clash on sunday.
