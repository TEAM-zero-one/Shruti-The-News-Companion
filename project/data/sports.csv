Player Metrics and Team Fit

Player Age Contract Status 2025 WAR Team Need Fit Kyle Schwarber 32 Free Agent 3.6 Power DH Jarren Duran 28 Team Control (through 2028) 2.7 Speed / Defensive outfielder

Who Wins the Deal?

Theare once again linked to a potential reunion with Kyle Schwarber, one of the most powerful hitters in baseball and a former Fenway Park favorite. With the Philadelphia Phillies exiting the NLDS and Schwarber heading into free agency, the timing seems right for both sides to explore a comeback. Yet, the move comes with important considerations surrounding roster balance, defense, and the team’s long-term payroll structure.At 32 years old, Kyle Schwarber delivered one of the best seasons of his career, leading the National League in both home runs and RBIs while earning his second All-Star nod. His offensive numbers reaffirmed his reputation as one of baseball’s premier power bats.Technically, the Boston Red Sox wouldn’t need to trade for Schwarber - he’s now a free agent after completing his four-year, $79 million contract with Philadelphia. However, a sign-and-trade scenario could emerge if the Phillies seek to gain value rather than let him walk for nothing.A hypothetical trade could look like this:• Boston Red Sox receive: Kyle Schwarber (DH)• Philadelphia Phillies receive: Jarren Duran (OF) and a mid-tier pitching prospect such as Wikelman GonzalezThis framework would allow Boston to move an excess outfielder while gaining the middle-order slugger the lineup has lacked since Rafael Devers’ departure.For Philadelphia, Duran’s athleticism and defensive range would fill a major need in their outfield, offering youth and control through 2028.1. Elite Power Addition: The Boston Red Sox finished 18th in MLB in home runs (176), well below playoff-caliber teams. Schwarber’s 50-plus homer potential would immediately fix that deficiency.2. Clubhouse and Fan Familiarity: During his 2021 stint with Boston, Schwarber quickly became a fan favorite. His leadership and postseason experience could stabilize a young roster headlined by Roman Anthony and Ceddanne Rafaela.3. Perfect Fenway Fit: Schwarber’s pull-heavy swing from the left side matches perfectly with Fenway Park’s short right-field porch, reminiscent of how David Ortiz thrived in the designated hitter role.1. Luxury Tax Flexibility: Schwarber’s next deal is expected to command between $25 and $35 million per year. The Phillies already have major financial commitments to Bryce Harper, Trea Turner, and Zack Wheeler, so shedding that salary would bring relief.2. Improved Defensive Balance: Duran brings elite speed and defensive versatility - qualities the Phillies currently lack outside of Brandon Marsh.3. Future-Proofing the Roster: Acquiring controllable players would help Philadelphia stay competitive while avoiding the payroll crunch looming in future seasons.In 2025, Boston ranked 23rd in slugging percentage (.398), while Philadelphia finished top five (.448). Adding Schwarber’s production would likely boost Boston’s team OPS by around 20 points - enough to elevate the offense closer to league leaders.From an immediate standpoint, Boston clearly benefits more by acquiring one of baseball’s most dangerous power hitters. Kyle Schwarber’s bat alone could add several wins to the Boston Red Sox offense, potentially improving their team WAR by approximately +4.0 in 2026 projections.For the Phillies, the benefits lie in long-term strategy - saving roughly $30 million annually while replenishing their roster with younger, cost-controlled assets. Although losing Schwarber’s production would sting, the move would give them financial breathing room and lineup balance.If the deal materializes, the Boston Red Sox emerge as short-term winners, gaining the kind of middle-order thunder that has been missing in their lineup. Kyle Schwarber’s familiarity with Fenway Park and connection with fans make the move both sentimental and strategically sound.For the Phillies, it’s a calculated decision - trading short-term firepower for financial stability and roster flexibility.Also read: MLB Trade Rumors: Boston Red Sox Predicted to Land $10.15 Million Detroit Tigers Star to Bolster Squad Around Garrett Crochet Ultimately, this could turn out to be one of the most impactful reunions of the 2025–26 MLB offseason, especially if Boston leverages Kyle Schwarber’s power to reignite their postseason ambitions.","The boston red sox are once again linked to a potential reunion with kyle schwarber.

Thesquare off on October 15, 2025, at the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas for one of the most anticipated NBA preseason matchups of the year. Coming just a day after both teams play back-to-back games, this contest is heavily shaped by rest decisions, injury management, and the differing preseason priorities of each franchise.Under head coach Jason Kidd, the Dallas Mavericks approach this preseason finale with a clear focus on building chemistry among their projected starting lineup ahead of the regular-season opener against the San Antonio Spurs. Kidd fields a strong rotation that included Cooper Flagg at point guard, Klay Thompson on the wing, P.J. Washington and Anthony Davis in the frontcourt, and Dereck Lively II anchoring the paint. Anthony Davis will play a crucial role in this matchup as he continues adjusting to his role as a power forward. The Dallas Mavericks plan to give Davis over 25 minutes of playing time to help him find rhythm and cohesion with his new teammates.The spotlight shifted to Cooper Flagg, who might be given the opportunity to run the offense and showcase his ability to control tempo and facilitate scoring opportunities for veterans like Thompson and Davis.The Los Angeles Lakers enter the game facing a long list of injury concerns and load management decisions.LeBron James remained sidelined with ongoing sciatica issues affecting his right side, and his absence was confirmed for the early portion of the season. Other key contributors - Jarred Vanderbilt, Rui Hachimura, Gabe Vincent, and Jaxson Hayes - were also rested for the second game of their back-to-back schedule, signaling the Los Angeles Lakers’ commitment to preserving veteran health before the season tip-off.A significant update came from rookie forward Adou Thiero’s recovery process. After dealing with persistent knee swelling, Thiero’s rehabilitation showed positive signs as he gradually increased his on-court workload. Team doctors projected another evaluation within two to three weeks, reflecting the organization’s cautious but optimistic outlook on his development.With multiple veterans unavailable, the Lakers can test their bench and younger players. Gabe Vincent was expected to handle point guard duties alongside Dalton Knecht at shooting guard, with Vanderbilt, Hachimura, and Hayes rounding out the frontcourt - though this lineup was adjusted with several players sitting out. As a result, players like Nick Smith Jr. saw increased minutes, allowing the coaching staff to evaluate depth and individual readiness ahead of the regular season.The approaches of both teams stood in sharp contrast. The Dallas Mavericks leaned toward a regular-season simulation, playing their main core extended minutes to fine-tune chemistry and assess lineup combinations. Meanwhile, the Los Angeles Lakers prioritized rest, recovery, and developmental minutes for their younger rotation members.Jason Kidd’s emphasis on integrating Anthony Davis into the Dallas Mavericks’ system was a key storyline. Davis’ combination of defensive versatility and frontcourt scoring offered a new dynamic for Dallas, particularly in spacing and rim protection. The absence of Luka Doncic provided an opportunity for the Mavericks’ supporting cast to shoulder offensive responsibilities and build confidence heading into the season.For the Los Angeles Lakers, the primary goal was long-term durability rather than short-term results. Head coach Darvin Ham’s conservative management of star players underscored a broader strategy focused on keeping the team healthy and cohesive for the long haul. Despite missing key figures like LeBron James and Rui Hachimura, the team’s younger players gained valuable experience in live-game scenarios against one of the stronger Western Conference rosters.While the Los Angeles Lakers managed their roster with caution, the Dallas Mavericks entered with higher intensity, reflecting a readiness for the regular season. Dallas’ deeper rotation and more aggressive approach positioned them as favorites heading into the matchup. For fans, this game offered an intriguing blend of youthful energy and veteran adjustments, setting the stage for both franchises’ ambitions in the upcoming campaign.Also read: Dallas Mavericks vs Los Angeles Lakers Preseason Showdown: Odds, Predictions, and Betting Guide (October 15, 2025) Though the final score was secondary to preparation, the preseason clash served its purpose - offering a glimpse into each team’s evolving identity, player health, and readiness for what promises to be a competitive 2025-26 NBA season.","The dallas mavericks and los angeles lakers square off on october 15, 2025, at the t-mobile arena in las vegas.

Rashee Rice ready for a full workload against Raiders





Chiefs’ offense could reach a new level with Rice’s return





The Kansas City Chiefs are already buzzing after their gritty Week 6 win over the Detroit Lions, but their momentum could skyrocket even further in Week 7. Star wide receiver Rashee Rice, who’s been sidelined for six weeks due to suspension, is officially back — and the Chiefs aren’t wasting a second. As they prepare to face the Las Vegas Raiders, Kansas City looks ready to unleash its most dangerous version of the offense yet, with Rice set to play a massive role right out of the gate.According to ESPN insiders Dan Graziano and Jeremy Fowler, the Chiefs plan to throw Rice right into the mix. “The Chiefs won’t be easing Rashee Rice back into action,” Fowler reported. “They will be allocating a heavy workload for him as soon as possible.”Rice, who has been back at the team facility since late September, has impressed coaches with his conditioning and commitment. Fowler added, “Rice has been in the building for weeks, had an excellent training camp and is in peak physical shape. A team source says Rice will be ‘full bore’ this week as he gets back onto the practice field.”Head coach Andy Reid echoed that sentiment, emphasizing Rice’s readiness while keeping expectations grounded.“Listen, I know he’s been working like crazy,” Reid said. “I think it’s just a matter of getting him back in the swing… I know he’s in good shape, that’s the one thing that I do know.”Kansas City’s offensive plan this week could mark the debut of a long-anticipated trio: Rashee Rice, rookie sensation Xavier Worthy, and veteran deep threat Hollywood Brown — a combination that could redefine the Chiefs’ passing game. With Tyquan Thornton and JuJu Smith-Schuster providing depth, Kansas City suddenly boasts one of the deepest receiving corps in the league.Before his injury and suspension, Rice had already proven he could be a game-changer. As a rookie in 2023, he caught 79 passes for 938 yards and seven touchdowns. Even in a limited role early last season, he averaged nearly 100 yards per game before a knee injury ended his campaign. His return gives quarterback Patrick Mahomes another reliable and explosive option — something the Chiefs have missed through the first six weeks.Kansas City, now winners of three of their last four after a rocky start, leads this week’s Sports Illustrated NFL Power Rankings. Mahomes is once again the MVP favorite, Travis Kelce continues to dominate defenses, and now with Rice’s comeback, the Chiefs’ offense looks poised to reach another gear.As Fowler put it, the Chiefs “have long envisioned an offense” featuring Rice, Worthy, and Brown together. That vision might finally become reality this Sunday — and it could make the Kansas City Chiefs even scarier than before.Also Read: ""My heart now belongs..."": Why is Charles Leno’s retirement tied to the emotional anniversary of his daughter’s miscarriage?",Insider reveals why chiefs won’t ease rashee rice back into action.

Jimmy Butler has a clear goal for the Golden State Warriors. He wants to help Stephen Curry and Draymond Green win their fifth NBA title.

You can’t say, ‘Who was on your team?’ You’ve done it with multiple different types of players and rosters. You get five, nobody is questioning anything about anybody that got five”, he added.Ever since he joined the team, Butler has made winning his main goal. “They’ve already solidified themselves in the basketball hall of fame and in the league, we get that.But to separate themselves from other individuals, you get five, like, you’re there”, he continued.Curry has already built a strong legacy with four titles, one Finals MVP, and two MVP awards. Butler believes another title will push Curry into the NBA’s top 10 all-time players.Jimmy Butler's stint with the Miami Heat ended with tension over contracts. However, he stated that he holds no grudges. In fact, he is grateful to be with the Golden State Warriors. “I wouldn’t change it for the world…I love where I am at right now,” he said. “I don’t think I can be in a better place, organization-wise, team-wise, headspace-wise. When I say I’m genuinely happy, I’m really, really happy right now.”The Warriors will open their NBA 2025-25 season on October 21 against LeBron James’ Los Angeles Lakers.

My Final Thoughts on This Signing

has officially agreed to sign with the Sacramento Kings for his 18th NBA season, marking one of the most intriguing veteran signings of the 2025 offseason. This move represents a strategic shift for both Westbrook and the Kings, offering the former MVP a fresh opportunity to extend his legacy while providing Sacramento with much-needed experience and energy.After spending months as a free agent, Russell Westbrook - nine-time All-Star and 2017 NBA MVP - finalized an agreement with the Sacramento Kings following weeks of behind-the-scenes discussions. Sacramento had been in contact with Westbrook’s camp since the offseason, intent on strengthening their backcourt depth and locker room leadership.To make room for the veteran guard, the Sacramento Kings explored moving pieces like Malik Monk to balance a guard-heavy roster. The team’s front office, led by new GM Scott Perry, emphasized bringing in proven leaders capable of driving a high-effort culture.While specific contract terms have not been disclosed, Westbrook’s signing aligns with a busy Sacramento offseason that also included the addition of Dennis Schröder and trades for key names such as De’Aaron Fox , Zach LaVine, and DeMar DeRozan. Russell Westbrook is expected to fill a flexible role - either as a situational starter or more likely as a high-impact sixth man guiding the second unit.• Gains a veteran presence with unmatched motor and leadership experience.• Fills a major void in bench scoring and playmaking, as the Kings ranked 28th in bench points and 29th in bench assists last season.• Aligns perfectly with the team’s cultural reset under Scott Perry, emphasizing accountability, toughness, and intensity.• Joins a legitimate playoff contender with established stars and a clear role.• Reunites with familiar faces in both the locker room and front office, making for a smoother transition.• Has the chance to continue building on his legendary statistical resume, potentially chasing Oscar Robertson’s all-time point guard scoring record and the 10,000 assists milestone.• Younger players like Devin Carter may see a dip in playing time but gain invaluable mentorship from one of the game’s most respected competitors.• If Malik Monk is traded to facilitate the signing, another team could benefit from adding a dynamic scorer just entering his prime.• Bench Stability and Star Power: Westbrook averaged 13.3 points, 6.1 assists, and 4.9 rebounds on 44.9% shooting last season, thriving as a sixth man.• Playoff-Ready Mindset: His postseason experience brings an element of urgency and competitive fire to a roster featuring new stars like LaVine, DeRozan, and Sabonis.• Cultural Fit: Known as one of the league’s hardest workers, Westbrook’s presence reinforces Sacramento’s focus on effort and discipline.• Age and Decline: At nearly 37 years old, Westbrook’s athleticism has naturally declined, and maintaining consistent production could be a challenge.• Crowded Backcourt: The addition creates a logjam among the team’s guards, possibly hindering the development of younger players.• Ball Dominance: Sharing playmaking duties with other veterans could pose lineup challenges that require chemistry and trust to resolve.Russell Westbrook remains one of the most accomplished players in NBA history, holding the record for the most triple-doubles (203) and joining LeBron James as the only players ever to record at least 25,000 points, 8,000 rebounds, and 8,000 assists. He currently sits just 506 points away from surpassing Oscar Robertson as the highest-scoring point guard of all time.The Sacramento Kings ’ roster now blends seasoned stars like DeMar DeRozan, Zach LaVine, and Domantas Sabonis with emerging talents such as Devin Carter and Doug McDermott. Russell Westbrook’s addition injects a level of championship urgency and veteran stability that Sacramento has lacked in recent years.After missing the playoffs twice since their 2023 postseason return, the Sacramento Kings are clearly positioning themselves as a serious contender in the Western Conference. Russell Westbrook’s relentless style of play and leadership make him a strong complement to the team’s offensive firepower and evolving identity.Both parties emerge as winners in this deal. The Sacramento Kings address their glaring need for veteran playmaking and second-unit production, while Westbrook gains a fresh environment that values his experience and drive. The move enhances Sacramento’s playoff ambitions and provides Westbrook with a meaningful opportunity to extend his career, contribute to winning basketball, and continue climbing the all-time leaderboards.In the end, the partnership between Russell Westbrook and the Sacramento Kings represents a low-risk, high-reward scenario - one that boosts the team’s competitiveness and adds another compelling chapter to Westbrook’s remarkable NBA journey.","Russell westbrook has officially agreed to sign with the sacramento kings for his 18th nba season.

Chris “Mad Dog” Russo says Molly Qerim wanted to save face



“If I’m not going to do First Take, I don’t want to do SportsCenter,”

Marcellus Wiley and Burke Magnus share more reasons behind Qerim’s exit

“and more about her wanting to turn the page and try something new.”

Molly Qerim shocked everyone when she suddenly left ESPN and her longtime role as First Take host last month. Many thought she would stay until the end of the year, but she announced her exit early through Instagram. A day later, First Take co-host Stephen A. Smith revealed that she had left ESPN completely. Now, veteran broadcaster Chris “Mad Dog” Russo has shared a surprising reason for her sudden move. Russo believes Molly left early because she felt embarrassed about being quietly replaced on the show.Chris Russo spoke about Molly’s exit on the SI Media Podcast this week. He said ESPN bosses might have been planning to move her off First Take and “try something different,” even though the show’s ratings were fine. “It’s the nature of the beast,” Russo said. “You’re on air forever, and sometimes they just want to make a change.”According to Russo, ESPN probably wanted to keep Molly in the company but in a different role. He believes Molly didn’t want to take that offer because she may have seen it as a step down.he guessed she thought. Russo said she might have felt embarrassed if fans believed she was just waiting to be removed from the show.“I didn’t talk to her about the details,” Russo said. “But that’s what I think happened. She probably wanted to leave before everyone thought she was a lame duck.”Earlier, former ESPN host Marcellus Wiley claimed that Molly Qerim was unhappy with her pay. On his Dat Dude TV podcast, Wiley said she earned around $500,000 per year, while Stephen A. Smith makes close to $20 million annually.Marcellus Wiley said Molly felt disrespected by the difference, especially since she had co-hosted one of ESPN’s most popular shows for a decade.Also Read: Simone Biles Opens Up About Her Mental Health Struggles During Argentina Trip Inspiring Millions With Honesty He also said Molly wanted to start her own show, but ESPN didn’t approve it. “That wasn’t happening,” Wiley said. “They weren’t signing off on her doing her own show. Molly finally woke up and said enough is enough.”ESPN President of Content Burke Magnus later confirmed that Molly’s exit came as a surprise. He told The Athletic that contract renewal talks had failed and that Molly wanted to “explore other things.”Burke Magnus called her “a wonderful person and teammate,” adding that after ten years, she likely wanted a fresh start. “It became less about her role,” he said,Molly Qerim’s sudden departure from First Take marks the end of a ten-year run that made her one of ESPN’s most familiar faces. While fans are still wondering what’s next, it seems her exit was a mix of timing, money, and a desire to move on.","Espn veteran chris russo’s bold claim reveals what really pushed molly qerim to quit first take.

Jaguars are not utilizing the rookie as much as Deion Sanders did at the Colorado Buffaloes

Revolutionize modern-day Pro Football

Unusual kid who likes football, video games, and fishing

No way should Travis Hunter have chosen to be baptized on a game-day morning - but here’s why he did

Little kid at heart—chasing footballs is like chasing frisbees

Also Read:

What started as a podcast episode about why Travis Hunter chose to get baptized at one o’clock before the Jacksonville Jaguars vs. Seattle Seahawks matchup on Sunday Night Football soon turned to what’s on the two-way star’s mind. Renowned sports commentator Skip Bayless centers his latest episode of “The Skip Bayless Show” on Hunter’s baptism. He also covers Hunter’s favorites—football, video games, and fishing—as disclosed by NFL legend and Colorado Buffaloes head coach Deion Sanders. Bayless discusses how Sanders used Hunter to his best advantage. He also explores why Hunter may soon lose interest and say football’s not fun anymore if the Jaguars don’t use the cornerback and wide receiver combo more.On his latest episode, Skip Bayless strongly voiced his opinion on rookie two-way star Travis Hunter’s mindset before the Seahawks vs. Jaguars’ SNF game. Bayless shared, “The Jags are using him so little, especially on defense, where he is the most gifted, all-time gifted, that Travis Hunter is starting to lose interest. He's starting to check out mentally on the Jags.So, he was actually happy to be baptized on a game-day morning because football isn't taking that much concentration, focus, or pregame mental preparation. Nope. Not now. Now, I'm certainly not suggesting that getting baptized was any kind of protest on Travis's part.It was just a stunning indication of where his head is at or not at right now. It's not really into football right now.”Bayless further explained that after a big win against the Kansas City Chiefs, Hunter’s attitude before the Jaguars vs. Seahawks matchup was, “Hey, they're not using me that much anyway. Why not get baptized on a game day morning? Even after they had had one of the biggest wins in franchise history the previous Monday night at home against Kansas City. Why not get baptized before a 1 o’clock game against a very good Seattle Seahawks team in Jacksonville? Why not?”The Jacksonville Jaguars are currently not utilizing two-way star Travis Hunter to his full potential, especially compared to how Deion Sanders did at Colorado. This underuse is central to Bayless’s argument about maximizing Hunter's impact on the field. Bayless compared how Deion Sanders used Hunter at Colorado (87% offense, 83% defense) with how the Jaguars use him now (63% offense, 39% defense).“Last year at Colorado, my man Deion Sanders, spiritual to the core is Deion, he utilized Travis Hunter 87% on offense and 83% on defense. And Deion told me before this Travis Hunter draft that he would, if he coached Travis in Pro Football, utilize him. exactly the same way. And I am all for it 1,000%.Through six games so far with the Jacksonville Jaguars, Jacksonville has used Travis Hunter 63% of the time on offense. That's 24% less than Deion did last year at Colorado. And here's the killer — 39% on defense has Jacksonville used him. That's 44% less than Deion utilized Travis last year in college football on defense,” said Bayless.Bayless argues that Hunter has the potential to revolutionize pro football as a two-way player if the Jaguars utilize him as much as Sanders did. He asserts that minimizing Hunter’s defensive snaps is a mistake, and given proper opportunities, Hunter could achieve Pro Bowls on both offense and defense, possibly becoming the second-best cornerback after Deion Sanders. This emphasizes the main argument that full utilization is key to unlocking Hunter’s impact.Bayless shared, “Deion by far the greatest cornerback ever. Travis, potentially in his orbit in Deion's orbit, especially as a cornerback. But I'm going to say this again—what Jacksonville is doing to him, especially on defense, is just so wrong. Again, if given the correct opportunities, Travis Hunter will revolutionize modern-day Pro Football as a two-way player, offense and defense. Pro Bowls on offense, definite Pro Bowls on defense, where he will ultimately be the second-best cornerback who ever played Pro Football to his father figure, Deion Sanders. ”The long-standing journalist further shared what the NFL legend Deion Sanders told him about Hunter. “Deion said—well, it's a very unusual kid here. He likes three things in his world. He likes football. He likes video games. And he really likes to fish. Deion has told me that Travis Hunter can fish all day and all night and be totally content. And yet Troy (Aikman) added, as he talked about those three likes of Travis Hunters, he added—not necessarily in that order.As much as God has blessed Travis Hunter with extremely rare ability on defense and offense, just extraordinary ball in air ability, track ball, catch ball on both sides of the ball. So rare I get goosebumps even talking about it. But as gifted as he is, God did not give him football overdrive. God did not give him supreme dedication to football.Football's just something that comes pretty easily to him. Not that he isn't dedicated. Not that he practices hard. When it's time to practice, he practices. But his life doesn't revolve around football. It's something he really enjoys playing because he's really, really good at it and he enjoys winning and competing at the highest level.”Bayless further shared how to keep Hunter engaged in football: “Deion (Sanders)' point to Troy (Aikman) was and a point he has made to me is that you actually need to play Travis Hunter a lot to keep him engaged in football. He's so good at it and it does come so easily for him that you need to keep his interest peaked by playing him on both sides of the ball at a very high rate. He's one of those kids.He's got a lot of little kid in the big kid. He's still a little kid at heart. It's like chasing footballs is like chasing frisbees, you know? It's just like, ""Oh god, this is fun. I'm going to go snatch this ball out of the sky."" Like the catch he made on Monday Night Football on the deep ball from Trevor Lawrence. But if you don't play him, he's going to throw up his hands and say it's not that fun anymore.”","Skip bayless speaks out for jacksonville jaguars two-way star travis hunter.

That’s what happened with Buffalo Bills star quarterback Josh Allen . His beloved wife, renowned actress Hailee Steinfeld , changed his perspective… and made him think about life beyond football . Talking to ESPN’s Marty Smith, Allen shared, “Maybe I am more than a football player. My whole dream as a kid, you know, has been to be in this position, and I have never thought of anything outside that or beyond that. But there is life after it as well.”Before the Atlanta Falcons vs. Buffalo Bills showdown, 2024 NFL MVP Josh Allen spoke to ESPN’s Marty Smith on “Monday Night Football.” Smith asked Allen about the most fulfilling thing in his life. Allen replied, “Most fulfilling? My wife. My wife is an unbelievable, undeniable rockstar in her work and as a person. She’s everything I need.”Smith then asked Allen what Steinfeld taught him during their time together: “Maybe that I am more than a football player,” the quarterback said. Allen elaborated on that, saying, “My whole dream as a kid, you know, has been to be in this position, and I have never thought of anything outside that or beyond that. Hopefully, I get to still play this game for a very long time, and ultimately, my goal is to play this for as long as I physically can.But there is life after it as well.”Allen further shared that, in his life beyond football, he would love to have a Super Bowl… he called it his Great White Buffalo. Benjamin Alva Polly of Explore Big Sky describes the Great White Buffalo as a sacred symbol for Native American tribes, representing hope, purity, and renewal. “Getting married was the coolest, it was the most important day of my life. I get to understand that what I do is not normal, but I’d also be content with a different part of my life, however that may have looked. I know, as a man, that in my life I will be great. But in doing what I do, and how I’ve done it for my entire career, putting everything I have into my job and winning a Super Bowl, it’ll always be the Great White Buffalo. That will sit with you for your entire life once you're done playing football,” Allen said.","2024 nfl mvp josh allen’s most fulfilling thing in life is his undeniable rockstar wife hailee steinfeld.
