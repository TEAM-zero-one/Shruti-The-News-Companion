The Storm then also came out and mocked Stratton, leading her to go after Cargill until security intervened to keep them separated.As Nathan Frazer was making his way to answer Ilja Dragunov's US title open challenge, Tomasso Ciampa came down to try and take his opportunity. However, Dragunov instead chose Frazer, and both superstars gave a highly captivating and intense match that led to fans erupting in a 'This is Awesome' chant.Following the exciting bout, the last minute saw Dragunov hit the H-bomb on Frazer to retain his title. Ciampa came out again and attacked Frazer as he was leaving the ringside area.Both superstars engaged in a back-and-forth contest on WWE SmackDown this week.

However, Miz blindsided him with an attack and laid him out with a Skull Crushing Finale.Former friends turned rivals, Alexa Bliss and Nia Jax had an exciting match on SmackDown. Despite the size disadvantage, Bliss held her own against the powerful Jax. In the final moments, he was going for the Annihilator only for Charlotte Flair to cause a distraction. This gave Bliss enough time to drop The Irresistible Force on the mat and cover her for the pinfall.Alex Shelly and Chris Sabin squared off against J.C. Matteo and Tama Tonga in tag team action. Both sides displayed an excellent showing as a unit, delivering a thrilling contest. In the end, Tama hit the cutthroat finisher on Sabian to pick up the win.

However, they were taken out and overpowered as Solo Sikoa and MFT stood tall.Both superstars met in the ring for the contract signing for their Undisputed WWE Title match at Saturday Night's Main Event. Drew McIntyre refused to sign it stating that Cody Rhodes would use easy means like DQ or countout to retain the title. As he was leaving, Rhodes stopped him saying that if he could disqualified or counted out, he will lose his title, to which McIntyre agreed. Both exchanged jabs until McIntyre brought up his daughters, leading to Rhodes striking him. However, McIntyre escaped only to come back and hit a Claymore and drop Rhodes on the table to end the show.Also read: WWE stars Bray Wyatt and Bo Dallas’ father Mike Rotunda in Hospice care, confirms former tag team partner

What to Expect from Tonight's Boston Celtics vs Philadelphia 76ers Matchup

Thereceived a major boost ahead of their NBA Cup opener on October 31, 2025, asagainst the Boston Celtics . This matchup serves as one of the marquee games in the in-season tournament, with both Eastern Conference contenders eager to make a statement early in the competition. For Philadelphia, Embiid’s availability brings renewed hope, especially with the Sixers aiming to preserve their perfect start to the 2025–26 season.Boston enters the contest hungry for redemption after an uneven start to the year, while the Sixers look to maintain momentum. The spotlight, however, firmly rests on Embiid, whose health has been closely monitored since the preseason. His ability to perform - even under restricted minutes - could dictate the rhythm of the game and set the tone for the Sixers’ Cup campaign. Joel Embiid has been battling lingering knee issues that have limited his playing time in recent weeks. Nonetheless, the Philadelphia 76ers medical staff has cleared him for action, with his minutes expected to be managed carefully - approximately 20 minutes of floor time. This conservative approach aims to ensure that the reigning MVP-caliber big man remains effective without risking further strain.This development is particularly encouraging for Philadelphia fans, as Embiid struggled in his last outing against Boston during the season opener, managing only four points.Since then, he has bounced back impressively, delivering strong scoring performances that reaffirm his leadership role. The Sixers’ offense, often revolving around Embiid’s inside dominance, will benefit immensely from his presence, even in a limited capacity.The Philadelphia 76ers will field a balanced starting lineup featuring Tyrese Maxey at point guard, VJ Edgecombe at shooting guard, Justin Edwards at small forward, Kelly Oubre Jr. at power forward, and Joel Embiid anchoring the center position. While Joel Embiid’s return headlines the roster, Philadelphia continues to deal with notable absences. Both Paul George and rookie Jared McCain remain out - George is recovering from surgery, while McCain is sidelined due to lingering injury issues. Their absence will test the team’s depth and chemistry, especially against a formidable Celtics squad.Tonight’s contest tips off at 7:00 p.m. ET and will be broadcast live on Amazon Prime Video. The stakes are high - not just for Cup advancement, but for the psychological edge between two long-standing rivals. The Sixers will look to avenge their previous loss to Boston while proving that their early-season dominance is no fluke.Joel Embiid acknowledged the frustrations of managing his knee but emphasized his commitment to contributing in any capacity. His return injects confidence into the Philadelphia locker room and gives the team a crucial interior advantage. With Embiid leading the charge, the Philadelphia 76ers hope to continue their unbeaten streak and send a strong message to the rest of the league.Also read: Boston Celtics vs Philadelphia 76ers regular season injury report: Who's playing, who's out, and more (October 31, 2025) In summary, Joel Embiid is officially playing tonight against the Boston Celtics.

What It Means for Atlanta

Thecould be preparing to make one of the biggest moves of the 2026 offseason, potentially acquiring. A trade for Skubal, whose projected market value hovers around $400 million, would form a dominant rotation trio alongside Chris Sale and Spencer Strider, instantly elevating the Braves’ World Series aspirations.Heading into 2026, Atlanta Braves’ front office - led by Alex Anthopoulos - is expected to focus heavily on both the bullpen and starting rotation. The bullpen remains the team’s most pressing concern after inconsistencies during key moments of the 2025 season.One key decision involves reliever Tyler Kinley, who emerged as one of the most reliable arms for the Atlanta Braves last year.“So far, he’s proved to be a steal. In 21 games pitched since coming to Atlanta, Kinley has a 0.41 ERA and a 0.73 WHIP over 22 innings of work. He’s averaging nearly a strikeout per inning as well. It was a low-risk gamble that brought high reward,” wrote SI’s Harrison Smajovits. (H/t: Sporting News)For just $6.5 million, the Braves have the opportunity to retain a quality late-inning option. If Kinley continues his impressive form, this decision could be one of the most cost-effective bullpen moves of the offseason.While bullpen reinforcements are vital, the Braves are reportedly eyeing a blockbuster trade for Tarik Skubal, one of MLB’s most dominant starting pitchers. Skubal has just one year of team control remaining, which could make him available if the Tigers look to maximize his trade value before free agency.HTHB’s Eric Cole highlighted the potential challenge and magnitude of the move: “Okay, this is the big one and also the toughest one to pull off. The Braves want starting pitching depth and there is a good chance that soon-to-be multiple Cy Young winning Tarik Skubal is available in the right trade.”Cole also suggested that a trade package similar to the one used to land Kyle Tucker last offseason could be a realistic starting point for negotiations.Here’s the revised and properly formatted table you asked for:While such a deal would come at a steep cost, the payoff could be enormous. Adding Skubal would immediately create one of the most fearsome pitching rotations in the league.If the Atlanta Braves were to acquire Skubal, their projected top three starters would be:1. Tarik Skubal – Cy Young contender, elite left-hander2. Chris Sale – Veteran ace with championship pedigree3. Spencer Strider – Strikeout machine and franchise cornerstoneAtlanta would be a nightmare for opposing hitters thanks to this trio's ideal combination of power, experience, and left-right balance.For General Manager Alex Anthopoulos, landing Tarik Skubal would be a career-defining move - one that could be remembered for years in Atlanta Braves history. It would not only reinforce the team’s championship window but also address the long-term stability of the rotation as veterans age.Also read: MLB trade rumors: New York Mets predicted to land $150 million Philadelphia Phillies star to bolster team and title chances As Eric Cole summarized, this would be “the toughest one to pull off,” but it’s exactly the kind of bold decision that could make the Atlanta Braves unstoppable in 2026 and beyond. If Anthopoulos pulls the trigger, this could be remembered as the defining trade that set the stage for another Braves dynasty.","The atlanta braves are reportedly eyeing a blockbuster trade for detroit tigers ace tarik skubal.

How Brandon Miller ’s parents shaped his mindset long before his NBA dreams began

Brandon Miller’s mother battled cancer privately while supporting her son’s college journey

Surgeries later Yolanda Miller turned pain into her greatest victory

How Yolanda Miller’s cancer battle built Brandon Miller’s unbreakable spirit

Brandon Miller's journey goes beyond just basketball. It's a tale of strength forged through quiet struggles and the resilience of family. Growing up in Tennessee, Brandon was immersed in the values of hard work. His dad, Darrell, played football for Alabama, and his mom, Yolanda, brought the spirit of a runner into their home. When Yolanda faced a breast cancer diagnosis, she opted for silence instead of seeking sympathy.Brandon was still shining on the court, completely unaware of the challenges his mother was going through. When the truth surfaced, the family didn’t break apart. They actually became stronger together. That collective struggle turned into the emotional core of Brandon’s ambition to win, not just in sports but in life overall. His mother’s courage changed pain into strength and assisted him in creating an unyielding spirit that shapes his narrative today.In her younger years, Yolanda was all about track running, using her speed and endurance in her daily routine.Darrell, on the flip side, was a tight end for the University of Alabama's college football team in the early '90s, coached by Gene Stallings.He later considered how he influenced Brandon's direction without any pressure. ""I didn’t talk him into going to the University of Alabama,"" Darrell told the Tuscaloosa News in January 2023. ""I wanted to give him a choice. But in a way, I kind of instilled it in him when he was born. ""Brandon was really influenced by his athletic background. He gives a lot of credit to his parents for shaping his mindset. ""Growing up, my parents instilled in me a relentless work ethic and the belief that I could achieve anything if I put my mind to it,"" Brandon said. ""Their constant encouragement is what drives me to push past my limits on the court.""The couple's older kids got into sports too. Their son Darrell Jr. played basketball at Fisk University and is now playing abroad. Their daughter Britany joined Cumberland University. Sports were a big part of their home, transforming challenges into team efforts.Yolanda waited for months before sharing the news with her children, handling the unknown on her own. She concealed her feelings during Brandon's tournament journey. ""Didn’t tell him. Want him to stay focused,"" she explained to ESPN's Jeremy Schaap in a 2023 interview. ""What he’s doing, he had enough to worry about than have to think about his mom’s health is failing.""As a mother, protection came naturally. ""As a mom, you want to protect your kids and your family at all costs,"" Yolanda said in her October 10, 2025, Spectrum News 1 interview. ""That's what I did. I didn't need them to know that I wasn't doing well."" She faced fears of chemo or radiation sidelining her from games.""You can’t cry enough, you can’t be mad enough, you can’t be disappointed or confused because you’re dealing with the unknown,"" she shared. ""I didn’t know what I was going to experience. I just knew people go through chemo, radiation, and I worried I wouldn’t have the strength to make my kids’ games.""Support anchored her. ""When I tell you the Miller family is my ride or die, they are my ride or die,"" Yolanda told WSOC TV on October 24, 2025. Darrell and the kids rallied once informed, turning her fight into a family stand.The treatment kicked off quickly. The first lumpectomy didn’t get all the tissue out, so she had to go through two more lumpectomies, a double mastectomy, and then reconstruction. Luckily, there was no need for chemo or radiation because it was caught early. By the middle of 2023, the doctors said she was cancer-free.Relief washed over her. ""Now that I’m cancer-free, I’m just happy and excited to be alive and grateful for everybody that was involved,"" Yolanda said. Scars became symbols. ""Seeing the scars is a reminder every day that I’m alive,"" she added to WSOC TV on October 24, 2025.Faith fueled her. ""I didn't give up. No matter what the doctor said, I still had faith,"" Yolanda said in her Spectrum News 1 interview. ""I still had hope that this was going to pass."" She now leads Team Miller Foundation efforts for awareness.Yolanda's struggle reflects Brandon's determination on the court. He leads the Miller Foundation, connecting resources for disadvantaged youth just like his mom did. Her strength in tough times showed him how to keep going. Whether it's Alabama games or NBA nights, the Millers are his support system.""I'm so grateful to be alive,"" Yolanda told. Her message rings clear: ""Breast cancer doesn't always have to be viewed as a death sentence. It's something that if you react fast, this can be something of your past. Just keep the faith. Stay hopeful and stay encouraged because there's a bigger thing in this life for you to experience.""The Millers' tale shows that family and faith can overcome any storm. Yolanda's journey didn't just save her; it also built her son's resilience, paving the way for countless others.Also Read: Is Giannis Antetokounmpo alright?

Starting center Zach Edey remains sidelined due to a left ankle injury, while Brandon Clarke (right knee), Ty Jerome (right calf), and Scotty Pippen Jr. (left great toe) are all ruled out. On a positive note, guard Vince Williams Jr. is expected to make his season debut after recovering from a right ankle injury that kept him out of the first five games. Despite the injury troubles, Memphis has managed to post a solid 3-2 record, displaying resilience and depth as they navigate the early stages of the season.The Los Angeles Lakers’ situation is even more concerning, with a total of six players appearing on their injury list. Superstar LeBron James remains sidelined with right sciatica and has yet to make his season debut. Luka Doncic, who has been battling a left finger sprain along with a lower left leg contusion, is listed as questionable for the matchup. Marcus Smart is also questionable due to a right quadriceps issue.Among those definitively ruled out are Maxi Kleber (abdominal muscle), Adou Thiero (left knee), and Gabe Vincent (left ankle). The absence of LeBron and the uncertainty surrounding Doncic leave the Los Angeles Lakers’ rotation in flux. However, Austin Reaves has stepped up as the team’s primary offensive weapon, putting up remarkable numbers - averaging 40 points, 10 assists, 5.3 rebounds, and 2.3 steals per game - and keeping Los Angeles competitive during this challenging stretch.With both teams missing multiple key players, the game’s outcome could hinge on which side better compensates for its absences. The Memphis Grizzlies will sorely miss the size and defensive presence of Zach Edey, which could leave their interior defense and rebounding vulnerable. On the other hand, the Lakers’ lack of LeBron James and the uncertainty over Doncic’s availability threaten to undermine their offensive flow and leadership on the court.Still, Austin Reaves’ recent surge provides a glimmer of hope for Los Angeles. His dominant performances have injected life into the team, but the supporting cast will need to elevate their play to keep pace with a Grizzlies squad known for its grit and tenacity. Memphis, despite its own injury struggles, has shown strong adaptability and will look to exploit any weaknesses in the Lakers’ shorthanded lineup.Fans can expect an intriguing contest filled with tension and unpredictability. Will Doncic return to give the Los Angeles Lakers the boost they need, or will the Memphis Grizzlies capitalize on their opponents’ injury woes to secure a key early-season victory?Tip-off for this Western Conference showdown is scheduled for 9:30 PM ET at the FedExForum in Memphis, as both teams aim to overcome adversity and keep their NBA Cup campaigns on track.","The los angeles lakers and memphis grizzlies are set to clash in a highly anticipated nba cup regular season matchup on october 31, 2025, at the fedexforum in memphis.

What to Expect from Tonight’s Boston Celtics vs Philadelphia 76ers Matchup Tonight?

Thesquare off in a highly anticipated regular season matchup on October 31, 2025, marking one of the early headline clashes of the 2025–26 NBA season. Both teams come into the contest looking to establish their dominance in the Eastern Conference, with the Sixers seeking to preserve their perfect record and the Celtics aiming to extend their winning streak.The game carries significant importance beyond the court, as both franchises face notable injury setbacks that reshape their rotations and strategic outlooks. With championship aspirations on the line, coaches Joe Mazzulla and Nick Nurse have to make crucial adjustments to keep their teams competitive despite missing key contributors. This matchup is also viewed as an early test of depth and adaptability, with fans eager to see which side could overcome adversity to seize control of their conference trajectory. Boston Celtics enter the clash with a relatively healthy roster but faced the major absence of star forward Jayson Tatum. The All-Star suffered a right Achilles tendon injury earlier in the season that is expected to sideline him for most, if not all, of the campaign.His absence dealt a major blow to Boston’s offensive rhythm and leadership on the floor. Aside from Tatum, the Celtics enjoy a clean bill of health, allowing players like Jaylen Brown and Derrick White to take on expanded roles as the team looked to sustain its winning momentum.The injury situation is more concerning for the 76ers, who entered the game without several key contributors. Paul George remains out following arthroscopic surgery on his left knee during the offseason and has yet to make his season debut. Forward Dominick Barlow is also sidelined due to a laceration on his right elbow, while rookie guard Jared McCain continues recovering from thumb surgery. These absences force Philadelphia to lean on its younger players and test its roster depth.Despite these setbacks, reigning MVP Joel Embiid is cleared to play, though his minutes are being carefully managed due to an ongoing knee issue. His limited court time - around 20 minutes per game - will be crucial for maintaining the Sixers’ rhythm on both ends of the floor. Embiid’s availability gives Philadelphia a significant boost as they look to maintain their undefeated 4-0 start.The contrasting health situations highlight two different challenges. The Celtics, still adjusting to life without Tatum, are relying heavily on Brown’s scoring and White’s playmaking to carry the offensive load. Boston had recently regained form with back-to-back wins, including a 125-105 victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers.For the 76ers, depth is the defining issue. George’s absence creates a hole on the wing that young forward Justin Edwards could attempt to fill, though replicating George’s two-way production proved difficult. Without Barlow and McCain, Philadelphia’s bench rotation is thinner than usual, placing additional pressure on Embiid, Tyrese Maxey, Kelly Oubre Jr., and rookie V.J. Edgecombe to perform consistently.Injuries inevitably shape the dynamics of this Eastern Conference showdown. While Boston grapples with losing its franchise cornerstone, Philadelphia faces a cluster of absences that will test its balance. Yet, the matchup promises competitive fire, as both teams seek to make an early statement in the season’s opening stretch..","The boston celtics and philadelphia 76ers square off in a highly anticipated regular season matchup on october 31, 2025.

Cardi B gets surprise invite from Patriots RB Antonio Gibson’s wife Victoria to WAGs game day bash as rapper awaits baby with Stefon Diggs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/cardi-b-gets-surprise-invite-from-patriots-rb-antonio-gibsons-wife-victoria-to-wags-game-day-bash-as-rapper-awaits-baby-with-stefon-diggs/articleshow/124999584.cms,"Victoria Gibson, wife of Patriots running back Antonio Gibson, extended an invitation to Cardi B to join the NFL's WAG community via an Instagram video. Gibson shared her own journey of adjusting to NFL life, emphasizing that family remains the priority despite the lifestyle's inherent uncertainties.

Family comes first despite the uncertainty of the NFL lifestyle





Also read:

When Cardi B announced she was expecting her fourth child — her first with New England Patriots wide receiver Stefon Diggs — fans everywhere celebrated. But Victoria Gibson, wife of Patriots running back Antonio Gibson, had a different idea: she wanted to personally welcome the rapper into the NFL’s WAG (wives and girlfriends) community, inviting her to experience the fun, camaraderie and traditions of game-day tailgates alongside players’ families.Gibson teamed up with fellow WAG Jayda Kamryn Hawkins to post a fun Instagram video inviting Cardi to a tailgate they were hosting that weekend. “Hey Cardi, it’s two of your future favorite WAGs,” Gibson said in the clip, adding, “A lot of people are looking forward to meeting you.”In an interview with PEOPLE, Gibson explained why the invitation was important. “We were thinking about the tailgate and how much fun it was going to be, and that’s when we were like, ‘Oh, we should invite her,’” she said. “We want to extend that invitation to everybody that’s part of the family — part of the community — who wants to come, so that’s why we wanted to make sure she knew.”Gibson admitted it’s unclear if Cardi saw the message. “We didn’t know how to get in touch with her. I don’t know if she’s seen it.” Even without Cardi attending, Gibson says the tailgate was a success, drawing roughly 50 guests who shared food, danced, and made TikToks together. “She might be like, ‘Girl, get off of me, but that’s just who I am,’” Gibson laughed. “She has nothing to be nervous about if she’s got me!”Gibson admits she didn’t grow up knowing much about football.“I had to Google what ‘Redskins’ was because it sounded really familiar,” she said. “I only attended Super Bowl parties for the Rotel dip and for the halftime show. So no, I didn’t know anything about football.” Today, her NFL life includes wrangling her children on game day, cheering for Antonio from the family section at Gillette Stadium, and joining him for postgame meals. “They do a lot of nice things for us,” she said of the Patriots.Gibson also acknowledges the uncertainty of the NFL lifestyle. “I think about it — is this the year we have to move again? You could have to go from the East Coast to the West Coast.”Still, family comes first. She and Antonio, who married earlier this year, have vowed never to split their household no matter where his career takes them. Recently, the family enjoyed a trip to the Big E state fair following Antonio’s record-breaking 90-yard kickoff return touchdown.","Victoria gibson, wife of patriots running back antonio gibson, invited cardi b to a tailgate they were hosting.

The Challenge Ahead: Facing a Healthy Memphis Squad

Final Outlook: A Game-Time Decision That Could Define the Night

Theare set for an exciting NBA Cup showdown against the Memphis Grizzlies tonight, but all eyes are on one question - willfinally return to the lineup? With the Lakers eager to build momentum early in the season, Doncic’s availability could be the difference between victory and another test of depth for JJ Redick’s squad.Both the Lakers and the Grizzlies are off to competitive starts, and their clash in Memphis promises high-intensity basketball. For Los Angeles, having their superstar back could tip the scales, especially after a string of gritty performances without him. Fans across the league are eagerly refreshing injury updates as tip-off approaches, hoping to see Doncic’s name officially cleared to play.Luka Doncic, who has been out for the last three games, is officially listed as questionable for tonight’s October 31 contest against the Memphis Grizzlies . The Los Angeles Lakers star has been managing multiple injuries - a sprain in his left finger and a contusion to his lower left leg - both sustained during the Lakers’ 124-119 win over the Minnesota Timberwolves on October 24. Despite being visibly in pain, Doncic showcased his trademark toughness by finishing that game, even requiring on-court treatment for his left hand.Since then, the Lakers have taken a cautious approach with their new franchise cornerstone. The team upgraded Luka Doncic’s status to questionable, indicating he’s making progress but remains a game-time decision. Head coach JJ Redick recently noted that while Doncic is “very close to returning,” the staff will prioritize long-term health over rushing him back too soon.A return in the next couple of games appears highly likely, even if he sits out tonight.In Luka Doncic’s absence, the Los Angeles Lakers have managed to stay competitive, going 2-1 in their last three games. Austin Reaves, in particular, has stepped up as a surprising leader, shouldering the offensive load with composure and confidence. His playmaking and perimeter shooting have kept the Lakers’ offense fluid, while teammates like D’Angelo Russell and Rui Hachimura have provided valuable support on both ends of the court.JJ Redick’s system has emphasized ball movement and defense, helping the Lakers stay afloat without their primary scorer. However, there’s no denying the void left by Doncic’s all-around brilliance. His ability to create shots, orchestrate plays, and deliver in clutch moments remains irreplaceable, and his return could reignite the Lakers’ offensive rhythm.Before the injury setback, Luka Doncic was off to one of the most explosive starts of his career. Through his first two games, he averaged a staggering 46 points, 11.5 rebounds, and 8.5 assists - numbers that reflect his MVP-caliber influence. His combination of elite scoring and playmaking has transformed the Lakers’ offense, giving them a dynamic edge few teams can match.If Doncic suits up tonight, expect the Los Angeles Lakers to reestablish their inside-out attack, leveraging his pick-and-roll chemistry with Anthony Davis and his ability to collapse defenses to free up shooters. Conversely, if he remains out, the Lakers will rely heavily on Reaves and Russell to initiate plays while leaning on their defensive identity to keep the Grizzlies contained.The Memphis Grizzlies enter this contest with a 3-2 record and a mostly healthy lineup, posing a formidable challenge for the visiting Lakers. Their fast-paced, aggressive style - anchored by Ja Morant’s explosiveness and Jaren Jackson Jr.’s defensive versatility - makes them one of the toughest teams to beat at home. The Grizzlies’ balanced scoring and energetic bench could exploit any rust the Lakers show if Doncic sits out again.Still, Los Angeles has shown resilience and adaptability, finding ways to win even without their top star. With a deep roster and a motivated locker room, they remain capable of pulling off an upset - especially if Reaves and Davis can replicate their recent form.As of now, Luka Doncic’s participation remains uncertain. The Los Angeles Lakers have listed him as questionable, and his return will likely depend on how he responds during pregame warmups. Even if he doesn’t suit up tonight, fans can take solace in the fact that his comeback is imminent - possibly within the next couple of games.Whether or not Doncic plays, tonight’s matchup between the Los Angeles Lakers and Memphis Grizzlies promises intensity, emotion, and elite basketball. A healthy Doncic would give the Lakers a major boost, but even in his absence, the team has proven capable of grinding out wins through collective effort and strong leadership from its supporting cast.Also read: Los Angeles Lakers vs Memphis Grizzlies regular season injury report: Who's playing, who's out, and more (October 31, 2025) All eyes will be on FedExForum as tip-off approaches.

The teams are off to strong starts when the Portland Trail Blazers take on the Denver Nuggets at 10 p.m. ET on Friday. Meanwhile, Jamal Murray, the All-Star point guard for the Denver Nuggets, has continued to write a brilliant start to the 2025–26 season.However, his speed recently got halted as he was listed on the Nuggets' injury report with a doubtful tag. This is due to the soreness in his left calf before their NBA Cup game against the Portland Trail Blazers on Friday night.After losing to Golden State on opening night, Denver has won three straight games, including Wednesday night's 122-88 victory. On the other hand, Portland lost their first game, but they have since won three of four games, including two in a row.Despite spending the whole last game on the bench, Murray managed to play 25 minutes, which is the fourth most of any player on the club. He struggled with the same issue in the 2024 postseason, and it was evident that it affected him when he faced a physically demanding Timberwolves team in the Conference Semifinals.Denver announced their official report to the NBA on Thursday, listing Murray as questionable with left calf tightness. The team wrote on X:“Injury Report ahead of tomorrow's game against the Trail Blazers: PROBABLE: Cameron Johnson (Right Shoulder Inflammation) QUESTIONABLE: Jamal Murray (Left Calf Tightness) #MileHighBasketball.”Murray has put on a number of incredible performances and averaged 27.0 points, 6.0 assists, and 4.3 rebounds for Denver in their first four games of the season. However, a recent update from the Nuggets has raised doubts about his availability for their first NBA Cup game of the year.Given that Murray's amazing start to the new season was halted by a calf injury, Denver could be better off either keeping him out of their next game completely or thinking about limiting his minutes.Murray would probably face Portland's All-Defensive Team-caliber forward Toumani Camara if he were to play for the Nuggets on Friday night. This would be a one-on-one match that would require the 28-year-old guard to put in a lot of effort and use extra force in an attempt to get open looks.Murray has averaged 27 points per game on 50/41/94 shooting splits so far this season, which is comparable to his 2023 Western Conference Finals performance against the Lakers, when he averaged 30 points.He has only averaged 15.8 points a game in October throughout his career, which is significantly lower than his numbers. He's made significant progress this season in an attempt to earn his first All-Star selection, but the much-needed momentum he's established from the start could be derailed if this injury keeps him out for a while.Injury has been a major factor, and his persistent calf problems are also a worry. Throughout his career, he has struggled with left calf pain, most notably during the 2024 NBA Playoffs. His next chance would be on Monday at home against the Sacramento Kings if he is unable to play on Friday.Also read: Portland Trail Blazers Vs Minnesota Timberwolves (10-22-2025) game preview: When and where to watch, expected lineup, prediction, and more","Denver nuggets face portland trail blazers at 10 p.m. Et on friday night.

NHL trade rumors grow around New Jersey Devils’ Nico Daws



Jacob Markstrom’s return adds uncertainty to the Devils’ goaltending plan



Possible trade destinations and scenarios for Nico Daws



The New Jersey Devils are once again making headlines in the latest NHL trade rumors, this time surrounding young goaltender Nico Daws. After a string of sharp performances, Daws has proven he’s ready for consistent NHL action; however, with veterans Jacob Markstrom and Jake Allen also in the mix, the Devils face a difficult roster decision as the season progresses.The challenge for New Jersey lies in roster management and waiver rules. Once Daws crosses the 30-day or 10-game threshold at the NHL level, he’ll require waivers to be reassigned to the AHL. Losing a promising 24-year-old goaltender for nothing would be a setback, making a mid-season trade a realistic option for general manager Tom Fitzgerald.Nico Daws’ steady play has not gone unnoticed by scouts across the league. His recent outing against the Minnesota Wild showed poise and confidence under pressure. Further fueling speculation that the Devils might use his value in trade discussions, NHL insiders believe multiple teams are monitoring his situation. Particularly those struggling with goalie depth or injuries early in the season.The return of Jacob Markstrom from injury could significantly impact how the Devils handle their goaltending trio, Markstrom’s veteran presence and Jake Allen’s experience make it challenging to keep all three goaltenders on the roster, and with the Devils pushing for playoff positioning.Now, Daws could be the odd man out unless a suitable trade emerges.Teams like the Vegas Golden Knights and Ottawa Senators. The Buffalo Sabres could be interested if their goalie depth weakens. A trade involving Daws might bring back a young forward or a mid-round pick. For now, New Jersey seems patient, but if the market heats up, expect calls to start soon.Also Read: Latest update on former Anaheim Ducks star Ryan Kesler’s criminal sexual conduct allegations","The new jersey devils are once again making headlines in the latest nhl trade rumors, this time surrounding young goaltender nico daws.
