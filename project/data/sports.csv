Dwyane Wade and Gabrielle Union's relationship went through a rocky patch before they got engaged

Dwyane Wade on Telling Gabrielle Union He Was Having A Kid With Another Woman | CLUB SHAY SHAY

Dwyane Wade, the NBA legend, recently went through a tough battle against cancer, and his wife, famous actress, Gabrielle Union , stayed by his side all through it. While the two have been married for more than a decade now, there was a time when their relationship had become difficult to manage. In 2023, Dwyane Wade appeared on Shannon Sharpe’s Club Shay Shay podcast and opened up about what happened when he had a child with another woman.According to Dwyane Wade, apparently in 2013, he had hit a rough patch with his now wife, Gabrielle Union, when they were dating. This had caused the couple to take a break in their relationship.It was during their break that Dwyane Wade fathered a son with his long time friend Aja Metoyer. However, things became rocky when Gabrielle Union came back into Dwyane Wade’s life.Dwyane Wade said, ""I tried to break up with her, ‘Hey, you know things has been bad lately. We've been having some distance in our relationship anyway.' Like I tried all that. She kept showing up.”But all worked out well for Dwyane Wade and Gabrielle Union as the two ended up getting engaged in December 2013, one month after his son with Aja Metoyer, Xavier, was born in November 2013.However, it seems like the couple faced some problems in their marriage. Dwyane Wade spoke about his marriage to Gabrielle Union and said, “It hasn’t been perfect, it will never be perfect but that was nine years ago.”He added, “We go to therapy, we’ve had shouts about it, we’ve had regular conversations about, and so it’s been something that going to be something that I have to work at and work on.”When Dwyane Wade spoke about this in 2023, he had not gone through one of the most painful experiences of his life - his cancer diagnosis . It was in December 2023 when he was first tested and later underwent a major kidney surgery.His wife, Gabrielle Union, became a huge source of strength during his battle with cancer and the couple has continued to be very much in love with each other even today. They continue to be one of the most popular couples in the world of sports and entertainment and are pretty happy with their lives as they raise their daughter together.Also Read: ""I started feeling invisible"": Dwyane Wade’s wife Gabrielle Union opens up about her unsettling Hollywood experiences in new documentary","Dwyane wade and gabrielle union's relationship went through a rocky patch before they got engaged in december 2013.

As Mumbai Indians (MI) host Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) in a high-octane IPL 2025 encounter at the Wankhede Stadium today, all eyes will be on the mouth-watering individual battles — particularly Virat Kohli vs Jasprit Bumrah , and the long-standing rivalry between India’s modern-day batting icons, Kohli and Rohit Sharma Also See: MI vs RCB, IPL Live Score While MI vs RCB is a marquee clash in itself, the showdown between Kohli and Bumrah has become one of the most anticipated match-ups in T20 cricket.Bumrah has dismissed Kohli five times in 16 IPL innings — an impressive record — but Kohli has scored 140 runs off just 95 balls against the ace pacer, at a strike rate of 147.36, hitting 15 fours and five sixes. The contest remains even, with both players exchanging blows in different seasons, making it one of IPL’s most compelling duels.Kohli, in his 18th consecutive season for RCB, has started IPL 2025 strong, scoring 97 runs in three matches at a strike rate of over 134. Bumrah, returning from a back injury sustained during the Border-Gavaskar Trophy earlier this year, will be eager to make a statement in front of his home crowd.Meanwhile, the Kohli vs Rohit narrative adds another layer of drama. Kohli boasts 27,599 international runs to Rohit's 19,700, but in the IPL, Rohit has the silverware edge — five titles to Kohli's none. Against MI, Kohli has scored 855 runs with a top score of 92, while Rohit has 831 runs vs RCB, including a best of 94.At the Wankhede, the numbers lean in MI’s favour. RCB haven’t won here since 2015, losing six in a row. Kohli has 301 runs at the venue against MI at an average of 43, while Rohit has piled up 307 against RCB at an average of 43.86 and a strike rate of over 154.","Mumbai indians (mi) host royal challengers bengaluru (rcb) in a high-octane ipl 2025 encounter at the wankhede stadium today.

Bombay Sport Exchange Ep. 2: GroupM's Vinit Karnik on IPL's growth and emerging sports

NEW DELHI: Former cricketer Basit Ali has called for the resignation of Pakistan's selection committee in the wake of the national team's disappointing performance, culminating in a 3-0 clean sweep loss to New Zealand in a recent One Day International (ODI) series.This call for change comes amid a period of underwhelming performances by the Pakistani cricket team, notably since their exit from the Champions Trophy at the group stage, an event they previously won.Also See: MI vs RCB, IPL Live Score Basit Ali, expressing his dissatisfaction with the selection committee's decisions, suggested that the committee, which includes Aleem Dar, Aqib Javed, Asad Shafiq, Azhar Ali, and Hassan Cheema, lacks expertise in team formation.He highlighted the committee's failure to include spinners in the Champions Trophy squad as a critical oversight.""The selection committee should resign. They don't know how to make teams. From the Champions Trophy until now, it has been a flop show. Even the tomato seller was asking why you didn't include spinners in the Champions Trophy. Aqib should step down. If you stay for four months, you will lose against Bangladesh as well,"" Basit said on his YouTube channel, as quoted by ANI.In an effort to rebuild and focus on future competitions, including the 2026 T20 World Cup and the 2027 ODI World Cup, Pakistan embarked on a tour of New Zealand, which included five Twenty20 Internationals (T20Is) and three ODIs.For the T20I series against New Zealand, Pakistan opted for a younger, less experienced squad, excluding key players such as Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan.Despite the infusion of new talent, Pakistan was defeated 4-1 by a relatively young New Zealand team led by Michael Bracewell.The subsequent ODI series, aimed at preparing for the 2027 World Cup, also ended in disappointment for Pakistan, even with the return of Azam and Rizwan to the lineup.Additionally, Basit proposed that the Pakistan Cricket Board ( PCB ) Chairman, Mohsin Naqvi, should consider organising a T10 cricket tournament.""PCB chairman should host a T10 tournament. Babar, Rizwan, Imam-ul-Haq, Salman Agha, Tayyab Tahir , and Abdullah Shafique need to learn power hitting,"" he added.","Former cricketer basit ali has called for the resignation of pakistan's selection committee.

NEW DELHI: India's middle-order batter and Punjab Kings skipper Shreyas Iyer experienced an emotional moment during the first practice session of the Champions Trophy 2025, where he found himself in tears due to his inability to perform as expected.Despite coming off a successful series against England, Iyer struggled with his form in the nets, leading to a rare display of vulnerability. This incident marked a significant moment for Iyer, who admitted to rarely crying.Also See: IPL Live Score, MI vs RCB ""Last time I cried was during Champions Trophy, first practice session. Like literally crying, crying. Because I batted in the nets, and it didn't go well. I was so angry with myself that I started crying. And I was also shocked at the fact that I don't cry that easily,"" Shreyas Iyer said on Punjab Kings' show.However, his resilience and ability to quickly understand the playing conditions paid off, as he became a crucial player for India throughout the Champions Trophy. His contribution was particularly notable in the finals, where he scored 48 runs off 62 balls, helping his team in the middle overs.Under Iyer's captaincy, Punjab Kings suffered a heavy 50-run defeat at the hands of Rajasthan Royals in Mullanpur, as their IPL 2025 campaign tasted its first defeat.Chasing a daunting 206, PBKS faltered early with both openers, including captain Shreyas Iyer, dismissed inside the powerplay by a fiery Jofra Archer.Archer finished with 3/25, setting the tone for Rajasthan’s commanding bowling performance.Earlier, Yashasvi Jaiswal starred with the bat, scoring a fluent 67 off 45 balls, supported by Sanju Samson (38) and a late flourish from Riyan Parag (43 not out). Their efforts propelled RR to a formidable 205/4. Despite some resistance in the middle order, PBKS couldn’t recover from early blows and ended at 155/9.The loss raises concerns for Punjab, particularly around their top-order fragility and captain Iyer’s underwhelming form, while Rajasthan Royals regained much-needed momentum and a healthy net run rate boost with the victory.","Shreyas iyer found himself in tears during the first practice session of the champions trophy 2025.

But Kohli wasted no time in asserting dominance.Facing Bumrah for the first time in IPL 2025, Kohli launched the second ball of the fourth over over deep mid-wicket for a towering six – his first of the match and a powerful statement in their ongoing duel.Despite the early blow, Bumrah kept it tight, conceding just 10 runs in the over with figures of 1 6 1 1 0 1.Before the match, Bumrah had dismissed Kohli five times in 16 IPL innings, but Kohli’s aggressive strike rate of 147.36 against the pacer keeps the battle perfectly poised.",Virat kohli hits towering six off jasprit bumrah's first over in ipl 2025.

NEW DELHI: India captain and Mumbai Indians opener Rohit Sharma's lean patch in IPL 2025 persisted as he was dismissed for just 17 against Royal Challengers Bengaluru at the Wankhede Stadium on Monday.Chasing a daunting 222, Rohit showed brief promise, cracking a six off Bhuvneshwar Kumar in the first over and following it up with two successive boundaries off Yash Dayal. However, the fourth delivery from Dayal — a sharp inswinger — sneaked past Rohit’s bat and crashed into his leg stump.It marked his highest score of the season so far, after three disappointing outings earlier: 0 vs CSK, 8 vs GT, and 13 vs KKR. Rohit, who missed MI’s previous match due to a minor injury, has now scored just 38 runs in four innings.His recurring struggles against left-arm pace also came to the fore — this being the 12th time since 2024 he’s fallen to a left-arm pacer in T20s.Earlier in the evening, RCB posted 221/5 thanks to fifties from Virat Kohli (67) and Rajat Patidar (64).

Travis Kelce vs. Rob Gronkowski: A simple debate post turned into pure chaos, with fans flooding X with stats, jokes, and Swiftie warnings



""It's kelce. Gronk missed almost 40 games in New England.""

""Not even close. Gronk. Kelce isn’t a TE. He’s a receiver positioned in the TE slot.""

""IDC about the numbers, Travis Kelce never was and never will be a better FOOTBALL PLAYER than Rob Gronkowski. Let’s end this today lol. The film don’t lie. Kelce hands are covered in doo doo butter, all Gronk did was make men look like kids weekly.""

the

So who’s really ahead: let’s break down the numbers and see which tight end is leading the legacy game



Rob Gronkowski – The powerhouse who bullied defenses

Super Bowl wins:

Career receiving yards:

Touchdowns:

Pro Bowls:

Blocking:

Record highlights:

Holds the most combined receptions (23) and receiving yards (297) by a tight end in Super Bowl history

First tight end ever to lead the league in receiving touchdowns (17 in 2011)

Known for elite route running and separation ability that’s helped power the Chiefs’ dynasty

The verdict: Two legends, two different legacies



NFL fans are usually divided on teams, but now the trenches have shifted to the tight end position. One simple question—Travis Kelce or Rob Gronkowski? This has snowballed into a full-blown civil war. Every corner of the football internet is sounding off, and no one seems willing to back down. Whether it’s about stats, rings, blocking, or even Taylor Swift, the lines have been drawn.Forget team rivalries—this is nowvs., and it’s getting personal.It all started with a viral post that reignited the age-old question: who’s better—Rob Gronkowski or Travis Kelce? From there, the comment section became pure mayhem.People brought receipts, emotions, and even their inner Swiftie energy:""I’m surprised the Swifties weren’t barking in this comment section.""Yes, that was a real post. Yes, this is how deep the internet is in.Some fans argued Gronk was a once-in-a-generation force who bulldozed defenses and made blocking an art form. Others said Kelce’s route running, longevity, and chemistry with Mahomes make himguy of the modern era.And then came the wildcards—shoutouts to Tony Gonzalez, Jay Novacek, and even “15K yards > rings” energy. It’s safe to say the post opened Pandora’s box.With all the noise online, let’s get into the facts.4 rings (XLIX, LI, LIII, LV)9,28692 career TDs5-time selectionWidely respected as one of the best blocking tight ends everGronk was the total package—physical, explosive, and nearly impossible to cover or stop once the ball was in his hands.

Kelce is a surgical route technician whose longevity and production have set new standards for the position.Gronk's legacy is already sealed, but Kelce’s still-unfolding career is giving fans every reason to believe he could finish as the most statistically dominant tight end in NFL history.Also read - Erin Andrews and Charissa Thompson tease a wild new podcast chapter after FOX exit So who's the GOAT?
