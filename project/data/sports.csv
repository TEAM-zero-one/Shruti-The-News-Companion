'Had you made reciprocal tariffs to zero ...': Piyush Goyal's cheeky 18% jab at US ambassador Sergio Gor,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/if-youd-made-reciprocal-tariff-zero-goyals-cheeky-cricket-jab-at-us-after-t20-clash-sergio-gor-18-percent/articleshow/128137342.cms,"“Trade Deal Wouldn’t Happen Without Him”: Goyal Praises US Envoy Gor

NEW DELHI: Union minister Piyush Goyal on Monday drew a parallel between trade and sport, remarking that the United States’ 18 per cent tariff on Indian goods mirrored the margin by which India defeated the US in their T20 World Cup match.Goyal praised the performance of the US cricket team despite its loss, using the occasion to make a pointed comment on trade ties between the two countries. He was speaking at a reception hosted at the residence of US Ambassador Sergio Gor.“The US may not have won yesterday's match (against India in the T20 World Cup), but I must say, for a country which has not known Cricket and has started on Cricket a few years ago, the performance was fabulous,” Goyal said.Recalling a light-hearted exchange with the ambassador during the match, he added, “Sergio was there to enjoy the match... Sergio pointed out one very important factor - the US lost the match by 18% and a very humble request I made to him as a suggestion that if only you had made the reciprocal tariff zero, you would possibly have won the match.”Goyal said he was impressed by the progress made by the US side in the sport. “I was indeed amazed by the fabulous performance US cricket team did..,”he said, referring to what he described as the rapid rise of cricket in a country with limited exposure to the game until recent years.India and the United States on Saturday issued a joint statement outlining the details of the recently announced trade pact, under which tariffs on Indian products entering US will drop from 50% to 18%. The development follows months of negotiations that started back in February 2025.For India, the deal will reduce duties on a range of items such as textiles and apparel, leather and footwear, plastic and rubber goods, organic chemicals, home decor, artisanal products and select machinery. For US, India will scrap or lower duties on the full range of American industrial products as well as on a wide selection of farm and food items, including dried distillers’ grains, red sorghum used for animal feed, tree nuts, fresh and processed fruits, soybean oil, and wine and spirits.","Union minister piyush goyal drew a parallel between trade and sport, remarking that the united states’ 18 per cent tariff on indian goods mirrored the margin by which india defeated the us in their t20 world cup match.

Warriors drop latest update on Jimmy Butler injury



Is there a return timeline for Jimmy Butler



The Golden State Warriors shared meaningful news on Jimmy Butler on Monday. The franchise has offered some clarity after weeks of uncertainty. The veteran forward has undergone surgery to repair a torn right anterior cruciate ligament. While the injury ended his season, the organization described the procedure as successful, framing the update as a positive development.Butler suffered the injury on January 19 against the Miami Heat and has since missed nine games. As of now, no short-term return expectations have been attached, but the language used by the team suggests confidence in Butler’s long-term outlook and physical recovery.Golden State confirmed the surgery through an official release, Warriors PR wrote on X:""Warriors forward Jimmy Butler III, who suffered a torn right anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) on January 19 against the Miami Heat, underwent successful surgery earlier today in Los Angeles.""The organization further shared that the surgery, “a reconstruction of the torn ACL, was performed by Dr. Bert Mandelbaum.” Butler has already missed nice games and will be “sidelined for the remainder of the 2025-26 season and will begin rehabilitation immediately.”“He is expected to make a full recovery and an update on his progress will be provided early next season.”Butler played in 38 games this season and averaged 20.0 points, 5.6 rebounds, 4.9 assists, and 1.5 steals in 31.1 minutes per game.From the date of his acquisition on February 6, 2025, until his injury on January 19, 2026, the Warriors recorded 48 wins, the fourth-highest total in the NBA during that span, behind only Oklahoma City, Boston, and Detroit.Now in his 15th NBA season, Butler holds career averages of 18.4 points, 5.4 rebounds, 4.4 assists, and 1.6 steals across 907 games, including 802 starts. He has played for the Bulls, Timberwolves, 76ers, Heat, and Warriors since being selected 30th overall by Chicago in the 2011 NBA Draft following three seasons at Marquette University.The Warriors stopped short of outlining a specific return window. The team confirmed that updates on Butler’s progress will come early in the 2026-27 season, signaling a long-term recovery plan. Butler’s agent, Bernie Lee, previously described the injury as a “gut punch.”His absence has been a huge blow to the Warriors’ plans. Although his return this season is very unlikely, the Warriors can prepare him for the coming season.",Jimmy butler has undergone surgery to repair a torn right anterior cruciate ligament.

My two cents on this mock trade

Trade talk is building around the Los Angeles Lakers as the 2025-26 season moves through February. Reports suggest the team may try to acquire Giannis Antetokounmpo in the offseason and place him alongside LeBron James and Luka Dončić If it happens, the move would show the Lakers are still focused on winning immediately. It would also raise practical questions about cost, roster balance, and whether Milwaukee would consider moving its franchise player.Giannis Antetokounmpo is under contract with the Milwaukee Bucks through the 2026-27 season and has a player option for 2027-28. He is earning $54.1 million this season and is scheduled to make $58.5 million next year. A deadline trade is unlikely, but Milwaukee could review its options in the summer depending on results and the player’s stance.The Lakers currently have LeBron, Dončić, Austin Reaves, Rui Hachimura, Deandre Ayton, Marcus Smart, Jarred Vanderbilt, Dalton Knecht, Adou Thiero, and future first-round picks. One proposed structure meets salary rules and reflects the type of return Milwaukee would likely demand.• Giannis Antetokounmpo (F, 31, $58.5M in 2026-27)• Thanasis Antetokounmpo (F, minimum contract)• Austin Reaves (SG, projected $15-18M in 2026-27)• Rui Hachimura (PF, projected $13-15M)• Dalton Knecht (SF, rookie-scale)• Adou Thiero (SF, rookie-scale)• 2026 first-round pick or swap• 2030 first-round pick swap• 2032 first-round pick swapThe package would give Milwaukee younger players and draft flexibility while allowing the Lakers to match Giannis’s salary.Adding Giannis Antetokounmpo would give Los Angeles three players who can control the offense and score in different ways.The group would provide scoring, playmaking, and interior defense. Dončić, at 26, would remain the long-term piece, while Giannis (31) and LeBron (41) suggest a shorter title window. From a business view, a roster led by two international stars and one of the league’s most recognizable players would carry strong global appeal.If the Bucks decide to move Antetokounmpo, the priority would likely be future assets. Reaves has playoff experience and a manageable contract. Hachimura adds size and flexibility. Knecht and Thiero would be developmental players. Multiple picks would give the team options to rebuild or pursue another star.Milwaukee would still have rotation players such as Myles Turner, Thanasis Antetokounmpo, Cole Anthony, and Gary Harris, so the roster would not be empty during a transition.Giannis Antetokounmpo has said he is not leaving Milwaukee, but league discussion continues about where he might consider playing if the situation changes. The Knicks and Heat are often mentioned as possible destinations.Los Angeles Lakers would offer a ready-made contender and strong market visibility. The adjustment would come from sharing possessions with two other primary creators and handling the defensive workload that comes with a fast system.- Advantages: stronger title chances, defensive improvement, and commercial impact.- Risks: reduced depth, fewer future picks, possible fit issues, and age-related durability concerns.- Advantages: draft capital, younger contributors, and avoiding a later free-agency situation.- Risks: losing the face of the franchise, uncertainty around player development, and possible fan reaction.In the short term, the Los Angeles Lakers would likely improve their championship chances. Milwaukee’s long-term result would depend on how well it uses the picks and young players.For Giannis Antetokounmpo, the decision would shape the later years of his prime, whether that means continuing as Milwaukee’s centerpiece or joining a roster built to compete immediately.Also read: NBA trade rumors: Golden State Warriors predicted to land $240 million Utah Jazz star center to support Stephen Curry and Jimmy Butler A trade sending Giannis to the Los Angeles Lakers is still speculative but possible under league rules. There is a lot of risk involved but so is the potential reward and that is a roster built around three of the league’s most productive players. The direction each team chooses later this year will determine whether the idea stays theoretical or turns into the biggest move of the 2026 offseason.","Giannis antetokounmpo is under contract with the milwaukee bucks through the 2026-27 season and has a player option for 2027-28.

"""Just catch it"": Julian Love reacts to 'dream' interception that sealed Super Bowl LX win for Seattle Seahawks",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/just-catch-it-julian-love-reacts-to-dream-interception-that-sealed-super-bowl-lx-win-for-seattle-seahawks/articleshow/128110789.cms,"Julian Love’s pivotal pick becomes dream moment in Seahawks’ Super Bowl LX victory over Patriots.Image via: Getty

Julian Love turns interception into defining Super Bowl LX moment



Julian Love did not celebrate right away. He just held on to the football. In a game that had slowly tilted Seattle’s way all night, one moment in the fourth quarter finally slammed the door. The former New York Giants safety, who once thought he would spend his entire career in New York, is now a Super Bowl champion with the Seattle Seahawks. Super Bowl LX never fully felt out of Seattle’s control. Their defense set the tone early, building a 19-0 lead and keeping the New England Patriots chasing. Still, early in the fourth quarter, the Patriots cut it to 19-7 and had the ball again. There was at least a hint of tension inside Levi’s Stadium. Then Drake Maye tried to go deep.After picking up two first downs, Maye looked for Kyle Williams downfield. The pass hung in the air just long enough. Love was in perfect position, reading the play the whole way. He secured the interception and ran it back 35 yards, helping set up Jason Myers’ fifth field goal of the night. That kick effectively ended any comeback hopes and pushed Seattle closer to its championship celebration.“I’d be kidding if I didn’t dream of that in the backyard when I was 8, 9 years old,’’ Love said. “To see that ball in the air and it was right to me, all I thought in my mind was ‘Just catch it.’ ’’Love spent his first four seasons with the Giants after being drafted in the fourth round in 2019. He wanted to stay but eventually signed with Seattle. Three seasons later, the move paid off in the biggest way possible. Seattle’s offense did not rely on its biggest star. AP Offensive Player of the Year Jaxon Smith Njigba was targeted 10 times by Sam Darnold but finished with just four catches for 27 yards. His longest gain was 16 yards. “There’s been games where I caught two balls — I don’t know what I had today — and we won,’’ Smith-Njigba said.The Seahawks led 9 0 at halftime on three Myers field goals. The Patriots never scored before the break, and teams are now 0 15 in Super Bowls when shut out at halftime. Darnold made history as well. He became the first starting quarterback to win a Super Bowl with his fifth NFL team after previous stops with the Jets, Panthers, 49ers and Vikings.Head coach Mike Macdonald, 38, became the third-youngest coach to win a Super Bowl and the first defensive play caller to do so. General manager John Schneider reached multiple Super Bowls with different head coaches and entirely different rosters. For Love, none of that mattered in the moment. The ball came his way, and he caught it. Everything else followed.","Julian love’s pivotal pick becomes dream moment in seahawks’ super bowl lx victory over patriots. The former new york giants safety, who once thought he would spend his entire career in new york, is now a super bowl champion with the seattle seahawks.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128116550,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-62244,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"

Megyn Kelly cries over Kid Rock’s TPUSA show and takes a public swipe at Bad Bunny

Bad Bunny’s historic Super Bowl audience shows where most fans actually tuned in

Megyn Kelly made it very clear which halftime show moved her on Super Bowl Sunday. The former Fox News host said she was “in tears” watching Kid Rock headline Turning Point USA’s “All-American Halftime Show,” an alternative stream timed against Bad Bunny’s official Super Bowl LX performance at Levi’s Stadium.After the show, Kelly jumped on X and posted, ""Congratulations @TPUSA, I am in tears at that BEAUTIFUL half time show. Everyone did a spectacular job - it was perfect. THANK YOU!"" She then doubled down when former U.S. ambassador Michael McFaul praised Bad Bunny, firing back, ""Nah, I like my half time shows in English from ppl who love America.""Turning Point USA pitched its event as a family-friendly answer to the NFL’s choice of Bad Bunny, branding the concert a celebration of “faith, family, and freedom” and closing with a tribute to late founder Charlie Kirk. Kelly’s reaction gave the show one of its loudest media boosts on the right, framing it as the “real” halftime option for viewers who share her politics and language preferences.Her “in English” line turned a simple concert review into culture-war content. In one post, Kelly managed to praise Kid Rock, signal frustration with a Spanish-language Super Bowl headliner, and cast TPUSA’s production as the patriotic choice.That is exactly the type of signal that plays well with an audience already angry about the NFL’s pick.The numbers, though, tell a very different story from Kelly’s timeline. TPUSA’s “All-American Halftime Show” drew about 6.1 million concurrent viewers on YouTube, a strong figure for a political media brand but a fraction of the main event.Bad Bunny’s official Apple Music Super Bowl LX Halftime Show is estimated at roughly 142.3 million viewers, breaking the previous all-time halftime record and underscoring how much bigger the NFL stage still is than any rival stream. He also made history as the first artist to perform a Super Bowl halftime show primarily in Spanish, turning what critics framed as a “controversial” booking into a record-setting moment.So while Kelly was in tears over Kid Rock’s set and TPUSA’s message, most football fans were still watching Bad Bunny under the league’s lights. Her posts didn’t change who won the ratings battle, they just made her halftime allegiance impossible to miss.","The former fox news host said she was “in tears” watching kid rock headline turning point usa’s “all-american halftime show,” an alternative stream timed against bad bunny’s official super bowl lx performance.

The Super Bowl LX halftime show at Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara sparked conversation long before kickoff. Bad Bunny ’s appearance drew mixed reactions ahead of time as critics questioned whether a Spanish-language performance fit the NFL’s biggest stage. However, following the performance, he turned the halftime show into one of the night’s most discussed moments.Vanessa Bryant made sure to share her reaction with a heartfelt gesture. Kobe Bryant ’s widow reacted on her Instagram while sharing Bad Bunny’s previous tribute to Kobe. The post inherently reflected respect and support for the musician.Bad Bunny, whose real name is Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio, took the Super Bowl stage during the New England Patriots vs. Seattle Seahawks matchup. The 31-year-old artist delivered a visually striking performance that leaned heavily into Puerto Rican culture. Despite the early controversy, the show generated buzz across social media, often rivaling discussion around the game itself.Vanessa Bryant, a proud Mexican and Latina, shared her reaction on Instagram. She posted a photo of the artist and wrote a single word that spoke volumes: “Felicidades”.Vanessa’s support also reopened memories of Bad Bunny’s tribute to Kobe Bryant following the Lakers legend’s death. The Puerto Rican singer honored Bryant through music, releasing the song “6 Rings” in tribute to the five-time NBA champion, his daughter Gianna, and their legacy.The track includes audio from Bryant’s historic 81-point game against the Toronto Raptors and closes with his final words to fans: “From the bottom of my heart, thank you. And what can I say? Mamba out.” Bad Bunny sings, “Black Mamba forever. Forever we’ll remember you,” capturing grief and admiration in equal measure.After Bryant’s passing, Bad Bunny shared his personal connection in a heartfelt Instagram message, “I would’ve never imagined that this would pain me so much!,” he wrote in Spanish. “I still remember the first time I saw a basketball game, at age 7 with my dad, and it was a game of his genius, and since that day he became my favorite player forever!!”Vanessa has acknowledged these gestures over the years, recognizing the respect shown to her husband’s legacy.",Vanessa bryant gave a shout-out to bad bunny following his super bowl halftime performance.

‘Terrifying’ Olympic Ski Star Lindsey Vonn’s Crash Seen In Shocking Photos

Lindsey Vonn’s coach shares a heartwarming post after her crash



Supportive prayers came for Lindsey Vonn

American viewers experienced a range of emotions during the women's downhill final at the Winter Olympics in Milan-Cortina. When Lindsey Vonn was taken away in a yellow helicopter on February 8, after a severe crash, the crowd went from cheering to dead silence. In contrast, her colleague Breezy Johnson was at the top of the podium and went on to win the gold medal. And there was nothing, but only one thing that existed between the two was respect.According to TNT Sports, Vonn’s coach, Aksel Lund Svindal, shared a tribute post on social media that highlighted the 41-year-old's level of selflessness. While she was yelling for help after the horrific incident, the American had a message to deliver to the entire world, particularly her team: “Tell Breezy congrats and good job,” she said, as her teammate took the lead.Svindal wrote in the Instagram post, “Lindsey. You’re incredibly brave. You inspire people who follow your journey and us who work closely with you every day. Yesterday was a tough day on the mountain. For everyone, but most of all for you. Still, something happened that I think says everything.”He added, “Your teammate was in the lead, and that’s the message you wanted the US ski team coaches to remember before you got airlifted to the hospital.Real character shows up in the hard moments.”The gesture highlighted Vonn's genuine sportsmanship, which she embodies. The 41-year-old tore her ACL completely in late January but was still determined to compete at the Olympic Games. However, she hit the gate with her right ski pole while running, and because it happened right around the initial jump, the skier lost control and fell on the snow.Among those in the grandstands, which also included the Vonn family, there is a huge concern. A few hours later, Lindsey Vonn was confirmed to have had surgery for a broken left leg and to be in stable condition. And while suffering from severe pain, she also wanted to convey a message about her teammate’s success.Johnson became the second American woman to win an Olympic gold in the downhill final with this win. Indeed, it was Vonn only who took that first gold in the category way back at the 2010 Vancouver Games.Johnson stated following her victory, “People are jealous of people with Olympic gold medals. They’re not necessarily jealous of the journey it took to get those medals. I don’t think my journey is something that people are envious of. It’s been a tough road, but sometimes you just have to keep going because that’s the only option. If you’re going through hell, you keep walking.”Breezy Johnson joined other athletes praying for Vonn’s recovery, as she said, “I don’t have anything except that her coach said that she was cheering for me in the helicopter. I hope that it’s not too bad. My heart aches for her. It’s such a brutal sport sometimes.”Mikaela Shiffrin stated she was speechless and said, “💔🙏🙏🙏” Retired ski legend Tina Maze also chimed in, stating, “We all know the difficulties that Lindsey was going through these last days, and to come to the race, I think she just leveled up too much and risked too much, and that’s why this kind of crash can happen.”Lindsey Vonn’s final Olympics ended in a motivational message for her fellow Team USA skier. This showed that her legacy isn’t just defined by medals but also by aesthetics.","Ski legend lindsey vonn’s supportive message to breezy johnson emerges after her olympic gold victory.

Why is Giannis Antetokounmpo off the court tonight vs the Orlando Magic (February 9, 2026)

Milwaukee Bucks adjusting without their star

Tough road game ahead

Return window still unclear

when theface the Orlando Magic on February 9, 2026. The team has listed him as out on the official injury report due to a right calf strain.This will be another game Milwaukee has to handle without its best player. The Bucks are on the road against a strong Orlando side, and Antetokounmpo’s absence continues to affect both the lineup and the team’s chances.Giannis Antetokounmpo has missed six straight games since aggravating the injury in late January against the Denver Nuggets. He has not yet returned to full team activity.The Bucks are listing the injury as day-to-day and are taking a cautious approach to his recovery. With the All-Star break approaching and the team still in the postseason race, Milwaukee is avoiding any move that could make the injury worse.Head coach Doc Rivers recently said Giannis is “getting close,” but added that the team wants him fully healthy before he returns.Milwaukee is also dealing with injuries to other rotation players, leaving the squad short-handed for the trip to Orlando.The Milwauekee Bucks are 6-14 in games Antetokounmpo has missed this season.Despite that record, they enter this matchup on a three-game winning streak.Kevin Porter Jr. and Andre Jackson Jr. have taken on larger roles, particularly in ball-handling and scoring. The bench has also seen more minutes as the coaching staff looks for stable combinations.Even so, the team does not have the same interior scoring, transition play, or defensive support that Giannis usually provides. The matchup against Orlando will test how well the group can hold up without him.Milwaukee Bucks go into the game as a double-digit underdog. Orlando has won two straight and remains near the top of the Eastern Conference standings, making this a difficult matchup.Without Giannis Antetokounmpo, the Bucks will rely more on guard play and rotation depth. The frontcourt is expected to see increased minutes as Milwaukee tries to handle Orlando’s inside scoring.The Bucks have not set an exact return date. Reports suggest the team is aiming for a return after the All-Star break if his recovery continues without problems.Antetokounmpo has previously said this type of calf strain can take four to six weeks to heal. That points to a possible return sometime in mid-to-late February.Also read: Milwaukee Bucks vs Orlando Magic injury report: Who's playing, injured and questionable players, head-to-head records, team stats, and more (February 9, 2026) When he is cleared to practice fully, the team is expected to monitor his minutes.

Milwaukee Bucks vs Orlando Magic Game factors to watch

Milwaukee without Giannis

Orlando at home

What could decide the Milwaukee Bucks vs Orlando Magic game

The Milwaukee Bucks travel to the Kia Center on February 9 to face the Orlando Magic in an Eastern Conference matchup with playoff implications for Orlando. Milwaukee enters the game without Giannis Antetokounmpo, while the Magic continue to rely on their regular rotation led by Paolo Banchero.Availability is the main storyline. The Bucks must adjust their offense without their primary scorer, and Orlando will look to take advantage at home. Shot selection, rebounding, and ball control are likely to influence the result.Milwaukee will be missing two rotation players.• Giannis Antetokounmpo (F) - OUT: Out with a right calf strain and expected to miss several weeks. His absence removes the team’s main interior scorer and playmaker, placing more responsibility on the guards, especially Ryan Rollins.• Taurean Prince (F) - OUT: Recovering from neck surgery. Milwaukee loses a wing defender and perimeter shooter who had been part of the bench rotation.• Alex Antetokounmpo (F) - OUT (Two-way): Assigned to the G League and not on the active roster.No other Bucks players are listed as questionable or doubtful.Orlando has one key player to monitor.• Franz Wagner (F) - QUESTIONABLE: Managing a left high ankle sprain and considered a game-time decision.If he does not play, Orlando is expected to give more ball-handling duties to Jalen Suggs and Cole Anthony.• Colin Castleton (C) - OUT (Two-way): Out with a thumb injury, which affects depth but not the starting lineup since Wendell Carter Jr. remains available.No other core rotation players are ruled out.• PG - Ryan Rollins: Averaging over 20 points and five assists while handling primary creation duties.• SG - Gary Trent Jr.: Known for three-point volume.• SF - Kyle Kuzma: Provides scoring and rebounding.• PF - Bobby Portis: Expected to start despite earlier hip issues.• C - Myles Turner: Leads the team in blocks and can space the floor.Key bench players include A.J. Green, Kevin Porter Jr., Cole Anthony, Jericho Sims, and Gary Harris.• PG - Jalen Suggs: Primary ball-handler and perimeter shooter.• SG - Cole Anthony: Scoring guard who can run pick-and-roll.• SF - Franz Wagner if available; otherwise Tristan da Silva or another wing.• PF - Paolo Banchero: Producing about 22 points and seven rebounds per game.• C - Wendell Carter Jr.: Interior defender and rebounder who can pass from the high post.Mark Sears, Jonathan Isaac (if healthy), and other role players provide depth.• February 9, 2026 - Milwaukee at Orlando (7:30 p.m. ET)• February 11, 2026 - Milwaukee at Orlando (7:00 p.m. ET)• March 8, 2026 - Orlando at Milwaukee (8:00 p.m. ET)In their earlier meetings, Milwaukee averaged around 122.7 points to Orlando’s 113.5. The Bucks shot better from the field and from three, while Orlando had the edge at the free-throw line.Milwaukee has been the more efficient offensive team, shooting higher percentages from the field and from three while generating more assists. Orlando has the better record, leads its division, rebounds slightly more, and shoots better from the free-throw line.The Bucks will depend on Rollins for scoring and ball movement. Turner, Portis, and Kuzma will need to manage the paint against Banchero and Carter Jr.The Magic are 16-8 at home this season. Their defensive structure has been more consistent on their home floor, and Wagner’s availability would strengthen both ends.Tempo and shot profileMilwaukee prefers to play faster and relies on three-point shooting, converting 38.5% as a team. Orlando typically operates in the half court, working through Banchero and Carter before passing to perimeter shooters such as Suggs and Anthony.Milwaukee must show it can produce offense without its top player and remain efficient in half-court possessions. Wagner’s status remains important for Orlando’s spacing and defense.Rebounding could favor the Magic, while Milwaukee’s perimeter shooting provides a counter. Orlando’s free-throw accuracy may also matter in close stretches.Also read: Is Giannis Antetokounmpo playing tonight vs the Orlando Magic?

Minnesota Timberwolves

Anthony Edwards injury report vs the Atlanta Hawks (February 9, 2026)

Minnesota Timberwolves relying on Edwards as playoff race tightens

Anthony's availability matters after Sunday’s loss

when thehost the Atlanta Hawks at Target Center. He was listed on the injury report earlier in the day with “right foot injury maintenance,” but the team has confirmed that he is active and will start in the backcourt.The listing caused some concern before the game, largely because of his recent foot issues. That uncertainty is now gone, and Minnesota will have its leading scorer available as it looks to get back on track.Anthony Edwards has been dealing with soreness in his right foot since late 2025, when a toe-related injury and infection forced him to miss several games in December. Since returning, the Timberwolves have regularly included him on the injury report with either a “questionable” tag or a maintenance designation.Even with those labels, he has not missed a game in 2026 and continues to play heavy minutes. The latest listing is viewed as precautionary rather than a sign of a new injury, with the team focused on managing his workload during a busy part of the schedule.Edwards is averaging about 25.9 points, 4.7 rebounds, 3.3 assists, and 1.1 steals per game entering Monday. His scoring and ability to create shots continue to drive Minnesota’s offense.The Timberwolves are 32–22 and sit sixth in the Western Conference, making each game important as the All-Star break approaches.Atlanta comes in at 26–28, ninth in the Eastern Conference, and depends heavily on Jalen Johnson, who is averaging around 23.4 points per game. The Hawks use a perimeter-based offense and are expected to rotate defenders on Edwards, with De’Andre Hunter likely among the primary matchups. Slowing his drives and pull-up shooting will be a priority, though he has consistently created his own offense this season.Anthony Edwards has remained durable despite the repeated maintenance tags, helping Minnesota Timberwolves stay competitive in the standings. His availability is notable after the team’s 115–96 loss to the Los Angeles Clippers on Sunday, a game that exposed defensive problems.For fantasy players and bettors, his confirmed status improves Minnesota’s outlook. He has recorded several high-usage games recently, including performances near the 30-point mark, and the matchup could allow him to score again.Also read: Atlanta Hawks vs Minnesota Timberwolves injury report: Who's playing, injured and questionable players, head-to-head records, team stats, and more (February 9, 2026) As of February 9, 2026, Anthony Edwards is active and starting against the Hawks.

Which teams could target Vincent Trocheck, Conor Garland, and Bobby McMann before the deadline?

New York Rangers TRADE Vincent Trocheck To Detroit Red Wings? | NHL Trade Rumors

MY GOD! WHAT A HUGE TRADE! SENDING TWO CANUCKS PLAYERS AWAY? VANCOUVER CANUCKS NEWS TODAY!

Vincent Trocheck's name is rapidly gaining prominence in NHL trade rumors, especially after the New York Rangers' trade involving Artemi Panarin. As the March 6 trade deadline approaches, curiosity is growing throughout the league regarding the Rangers' next move.Meanwhile, Conor Garland of the Vancouver Canucks and Bobby McMann of the Toronto Maple Leafs have also become subjects of speculation. Three different teams, three different situations, but the common factor is that contenders are viewing these players as potential roster upgrades.After Artemi Panarin’s trade to the Los Angeles Kings, attention in New York has turned to Vincent Trocheck. The 32-year-old center carries a $5.625 million cap hit through 2028-29, making him a valuable long-term piece. Sportsnet’s Elliotte Friedman reported the Kings attempted to acquire him in the Panarin deal, but Trocheck prefers to stay in the Eastern Conference and has a 12-team no-trade list. Friedman also indicated that the Detroit Red Wings had shown interest in him during 2022, while RG.org’s Marco D’Amico believes they will make another attempt because they require a center and have sufficient salary cap room.Conor Garland maintains his position as a player who creates trade rumors for the Vancouver team management.Thomas Drance of The Athletic reported that Garland and Brock Boeser are not actively being shopped, but the Canucks would consider the right offer. The Province’s Paul Chapman pointed out that Garland’s new six-year, $36 million extension — which includes a full no-movement clause starting July 1 — could complicate any potential deal. Teams appreciate his competitive nature and physical playing style, but some organizations hesitate to approve his extended contract because they want to evaluate his future performance.Bobby McMann has become a player whom Toronto teams should watch if the Maple Leafs decide to trade away their players. Friedman reported that Toronto is seeking a first-round pick in return, reflecting McMann’s perceived value around the league. The interested teams, which include Colorado, Dallas, Edmonton, Minnesota, and Vegas, have already made their first-round picks for 2026, which will force the Leafs to change their trade demands as they approach the deadline.The upcoming trade deadline makes Vincent Trocheck the most important player to follow after the Rangers traded Panarin, while Conor Garland and Bobby McMann maintain their ability to attract interest from other teams. The upcoming playoff race will experience significant changes based on the choices that New York, Vancouver, and Toronto will make during the next few weeks.","After artemi panarin’s trade to the los angeles kings, attention in new york has turned to vincent trocheck.

Tasha K Leaks Alleged Receipts: Stefon Diggs Scandal Shakes Up Super Bowl LX

(Image via: Tasha K's X)

""Everything is alleged... draw your own conclusions,""

As the world watches Super Bowl LX today, a messy off-field drama is threatening to overshadow the big game. A viral series of ""alleged"" receipts from celebrity blogger Tasha K has put Patriots star Stefon Diggs in the hot seat, just hours before he is expected to propose to Cardi B The drama started when Tasha K posted a scathing series of tweets claiming that Stefon Diggs had a woman named Pree on the secured NFL practice field at Levi’s Stadium yesterday.According to Tasha K, Pree was spotted wearing an official ""WAGs"" (Wives and Girlfriends) jacket and was accompanied by Diggs’ own mother and inner circle.Tasha K emphasized that practice field access is strictly regulated, meaning Pree could only be there with authorized team clearance usually reserved for a player's primary partner. To back up the claim, the blogger shared ""alleged"" photos of the group on the field, asserting that Pree is a long-time associate of Diggs who ""goes way back"" with his family.This report is especially explosive because Cardi B is currently in San Francisco to support Diggs in the biggest game of his career. The couple welcomed their son just three months ago in November 2025.Cardi has reportedly spent over $1.2 million this weekend on private jets and luxury suites for 100 guests to celebrate Diggs. Tasha K and Cardi B have a bitter legal history; Cardi famously won a $3.9 million defamation lawsuit against the blogger in 2022. Tasha K’s latest ""leak"" is being seen by many as a calculated move to disrupt Cardi’s high-profile weekend. In her tweet, Tasha K remained defiant, stating,while reminding followers she was right about previous pregnancy rumors.Before this scandal broke, the main narrative was whether Diggs would propose to Cardi B on the field after the game, a move he teased during media week as being ""on the agenda."" Now, the question is whether Cardi will show up to the game at all, or if the ""Pree"" sightings will trigger the ""done"" clause of her ultimatum.","Celebrity blogger tasha k claims stefon diggs had a woman named pree on the secured nfl practice field at levi’s stadium yesterday.

when theface the Cleveland Cavaliers on Monday at Ball Arena. The center is listed as probable on the injury report with a left ankle sprain, which usually means a player is expected to be available unless something changes close to tipoff.Denver has also indicated that Jokic is on track to suit up, and betting markets reflect the same expectation. With several Nuggets dealing with injuries, his availability carries added importance heading into this matchup.The NBA’s injury report from February 9 lists Nikola Jokić as probable with an ankle issue, and Denver’s February 8 report carries the same update. Christian Braun is also probable with a left ankle sprain, while Jamal Murray is questionable because of left hip inflammation.Cleveland is short on frontcourt depth. Evan Mobley is out with a left calf strain, and Max Strus remains sidelined after left foot surgery. Jaylon Tyson and Dean Wade are both questionable with left ankle sprains.Given the absences on both sides, Denver is expected to rely heavily on Jokic to organize the offense.Nikola Jokic returned in late December 2025 after missing time with a left knee bone bruise and has played regularly since then.In a recent stretch that included more than 30 minutes in three straight games, he averaged about 28 to 29 points, 12 rebounds, and 10 to 11 assists. He shot close to 59 percent from the field and over 40 percent from three-point range during that span.The ankle sprain appeared more recently and created some uncertainty before a game against Chicago. He was still considered day-to-day and expected to play. His current probable status suggests the team believes he can handle his normal role, though a slight reduction in minutes remains possible.The Denver Nuggets are trying to maintain their place in a competitive Western Conference, making Jokic’s presence important against a strong Cavaliers team finishing a road trip.Denver is already without Aaron Gordon, Peyton Watson, and Spencer Jones. That leaves Jokic with a larger share of the scoring and playmaking duties. Despite his expected availability, the Nuggets enter the game as slight home underdogs, showing how much the team depends on him when the roster is thin.If he plays, Denver will likely run its offense through him at the high post and in pick-and-roll situations to challenge Cleveland’s size and perimeter defense.• Minutes: Denver could manage his workload because of the ankle, but the stakes of the game may require extended playing time.• Partnership with Murray: If Murray is cleared, their pick-and-roll remains central to Denver’s half-court offense.• Defensive pressure: Cleveland may send extra defenders, which often allows Jokic to create open shots for teammates such as Braun.Fantasy players and bettors should still check for a final update before the game, but the probable tag points toward him being available.Also read: Cleveland Cavaliers vs Denver Nuggets injury report: Who's playing, injured and questionable players, head-to-head records, team stats, and more (February 9, 2026) Nikola Jokic is expected to play against the Cleveland Cavaliers and is officially listed as probable with a left ankle sprain.

Joel Embiid's Official injury report details vs Portland Trail Blazers (February 9, 2026)

Joel Embiid's Recent performance and team impact

What the questionable tag usually means

When will Embiid's status will be confirmed

Thewhen they take on the Portland Trail Blazers on Monday night. The center is listed as questionable, and a final decision is expected closer to tip-off.Embiid is dealing with right knee injury management, the same concern the team has monitored since his return from last season’s knee issues. Philadelphia has been careful with his workload, especially during long stretches of games.The league’s injury report lists Joel Embiid as questionable for the Philadelphia Phillies vs Portland Trail Blazers matchup because of his right knee. Team updates reflect the same status as the Sixers finish a five-game trip through the Western Conference.This has been a familiar pattern. When Embiid is available, he plays major minutes, but the team avoids using him in back-to-back games and evaluates the knee regularly. Philadelphia has prioritized his long-term availability rather than pushing him into every regular-season contest, which is why his status often remains unsettled until game day.Embiid has been productive when on the floor. Over his last 18 games since late December, he has averaged 30.1 points, 8.2 rebounds, and 4.7 assists in 34.4 minutes per game.He is shooting 52.4% from the field and 37.5% from three-point range during that span.The Sixers are 13-5 in those games and currently hold a top-six spot in the Eastern Conference. With home-court advantage still a priority, the staff must decide whether to play Embiid in the final game of the trip or give him extra rest before the team returns home.For Joel Embiid, questionable typically means the training staff will check the knee after shootaround and again before the game. If his mobility is normal and the discomfort is manageable, he usually plays. If there is swelling or stiffness, the team has shown a willingness to hold him out.The situation is worth watching because this is the last game of a five-game road stretch. Portland is also managing several injuries, which could factor into the decision. At the same time, Philadelphia has won six of its last seven games and may prefer to keep that run going before the All-Star break.The clearest update should come about 90 minutes before tip-off, when the final injury report is released and team reporters share availability. Warmups can also offer a hint. If Embiid moves well during drills, the chances of him playing improve.If he does not play, Tobias Harris and Kelly Oubre Jr. are expected to see more time in the frontcourt. Tyrese Maxey and Quentin Grimes would likely take on a larger share of the scoring. If Embiid is cleared, the Philadelphia 76ers regain their primary scoring option and interior presence.Also read: Philadelphia 76ers vs Portland Trail Blazers injury report: Who's playing, injured and questionable players, head-to-head records, team stats, and more (February 9, 2026) As of February 9, 2026, Joel Embiid has not been ruled out, but he is not guaranteed to play.

He has missed games at different points this season. If he plays, Philadelphia gains a clear advantage inside.• Paul George (F) - Out (league suspension). His absence removes an important wing defender and scorer.• Kelly Oubre Jr. (F) - Available (left knee; injury recovery - brace). He is expected to play, though his minutes may be monitored.Tyrese Maxey, Jared McCain, Adem Bona, Kyle Lowry, and Trendon Watford are expected to be active unless there is a late change.Portland Trail Blazers (25-28, 9th in West) enter the game with several injured players.• Deni Avdija (F) - Questionable (low back strain).

Portland leans more on guard play and transition scoring but has struggled defensively with key perimeter players out.If Embiid and Williams both play, the game may slow down and focus on interior scoring. If neither is available, the pace could increase.- Interior matchup: If Embiid is active, he is likely to face Donovan Clingan, Yang Hansen, and possibly Williams. Philadelphia would have the advantage near the basket.- Maxey against Portland’s guards: Maxey is averaging about 25-26 points and 6-7 assists. With Sharpe and Thybulle out, he may see less resistance on drives and perimeter shots.- Perimeter defense: Portland is without one of its top defenders in Thybulle, which could affect its ability to contest shooters.- Offense without Lillard: Portland has relied on Henderson, Holiday, and Grant to handle scoring duties. Half-court execution becomes important against a structured defense.- Bench production: Philadelphia’s second unit, including McCain, Watford, and Bona, has provided steady minutes. Portland’s bench depth has been affected by injuries.Philadelphia has the advantage if Embiid plays, even without Paul George.
