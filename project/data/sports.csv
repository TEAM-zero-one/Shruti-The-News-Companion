This meant he would miss a few games to be with his wife Nahomi as they prepared to welcome their first child. The Mets were about to begin a three-game series against the Washington Nationals at Nationals Park in Washington, D.C.That same day, Mets manager Carlos Mendoza told reporters that Alvarez was not available for the game because he was at the hospital with his wife.

No more tour, all touchdowns—Taylor Swift to support Travis Kelce every step of the 2025 season







As the NFL gears up for the 2025 season, Taylor Swift is preparing for a quieter, more grounded fall — and it’s all by choice. For the first time since her relationship with Travis Kelce began in 2023, the global superstar will head into football season without the weight of a world tour pulling her in opposite directions.“Taylor is really looking forward to the upcoming NFL season. Not just because she loves supporting Travis, but because for the first full season since they started dating, she’s not juggling a packed tour schedule,” an insider shared exclusively with PEOPLE. The change marks a significant shift in their relationship dynamic, offering both Swift and Kelce the rare luxury of time.In the past two seasons, the couple managed to stay close despite crisscrossing continents and balancing high-pressure careers. “The past two seasons were a whirlwind between performing across multiple countries, long flights, and trying to squeeze in alone time together wherever possible. It wasn’t easy but they made it work,” the source added. Their ability to maintain their connection through it all has become a testament to their commitment.Swift officially wrapped her record-breaking Eras Tour in December 2024 in Vancouver. Spanning five continents and grossing over $2 billion in ticket sales, the tour became the highest-grossing in history.But now, without rehearsals, flights, and nightly performances filling her calendar, the 14-time Grammy winner has space to breathe — and cheer.With her schedule finally free, Swift is expected to be a more regular face in the Arrowhead Stadium stands. “Her schedule is much more open now that the Eras Tour is wrapped and she’s genuinely excited to have the time and flexibility to show up for Travis more consistently,” the source noted. “Taylor plans to be at as many of his games as possible.”That’s good news for Kansas City fans. While all eyes remain on Patrick Mahomes and his offensive arsenal — including Rashee Rice, Xavier Worthy, Hollywood Brown, and, of course, Kelce — the added energy from Swift’s presence brings its own kind of buzz to game day.After their public debut in September 2023, Swift’s regular appearances at Chiefs games, including the AFC Championship and Super Bowl LVIII, became headline moments. Now, without international flights cutting into her weekends, she and Kelce have a chance to settle into something more stable.“It’s a chance for them to settle into more of a routine and they’re both really happy about that,” the insider added.With football season approaching and fewer distractions in the way, Swift and Kelce are entering a new chapter — one that could be defined less by chaos and more by companionship.Also Read: Hailee Steinfeld gives first clear look at massive engagement ring after secretive romance with Josh Allen","Taylor swift and travis kelce have been dating since 2023.

Are Patrick and Brittany Mahomes done having kids?



Brittany Mahomes: The Truth About Pregnancy, Staying Active, And Being An NFL Wife

Chiefs Andy Reid, Patrick Mahomes Trent McDuffie & Xavier Worthy Press Conference | JANUARY 14, 2025





Patrick Mahomes may have fallen just short of a historic Super Bowl three-peat at the end of the 2024 NFL season, but his life off the field has never looked brighter. As 2025 kicks into high gear, the Kansas City Chiefs quarterback is thriving in both his personal and professional life, celebrating the arrival of his third child and preparing for yet another demanding NFL season.The Mahomes family welcomed a new member on January 12—a baby girl named Golden Raye. She joins her siblings Sterling Sky, born in February 2021, and Patrick “Bronze” Lavon, born in November 2022. With the addition of Golden, the Mahomes household has grown to five, and the couple seems perfectly content with that number.Brittany Mahomes, Patrick’s wife and longtime partner since their high school days, shared her thoughts on growing their family during a candid chat on the WHOOP Podcast. “Nope. We're done, we're done for a while. Three,” she said with a smile. “I don't know, I mean I feel like you can never like say you're done, but I think three is all I need.”Patrick echoed his wife’s words in a press conference shortly after Golden’s birth. “I'm good with three for right now,” he stated. “We'll see down the line, maybe. But my goal was always three. So, we've had three. And we'll stick there for a while and see if we need to come back and get another one later on.”The couple, who began dating in 2012 and married in a stunning Hawaiian ceremony in 2022, have navigated life’s biggest transitions together—from college sweethearts to NFL fame, and now parenthood. Their bond remains strong as they juggle high-profile careers and family responsibilities.As a three-time Super Bowl champion, Mahomes isn’t taking his foot off the gas. He’s already back in action, attending OTAs with the Chiefs ahead of his ninth season. The team is gearing up for a global showcase, with their season opener set in Brazil against the Los Angeles Chargers—marking an international milestone for both the franchise and the league.Away from the stadium lights, Mahomes also opened up about the support he receives from Brittany, especially in terms of inspiration. “I admire my wife Brittany's confidence,” he told People. “Whether it's in business, or supporting our family, she always leads with strength and purpose. That kind of confidence is powerful; it pushes me to be better every day.”With family fulfillment and football focus going hand-in-hand, Mahomes seems more driven than ever. Whether it’s leading the Chiefs into another title run or being a present father at home, his commitment to excellence remains unwavering.Also Read: Is Travis Kelce preparing for a graceful NFL exit? 5 veterans who might retire after the 2025 season","Patrick and brittany mahomes welcomed a baby girl on january 12.

Jason Kelce shares his honest reaction after spotting a wild NSFW tattoo from a die-hard Eagles fan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/jason-kelce-shares-his-honest-reaction-after-spotting-a-wild-nsfw-tattoo-from-a-die-hard-eagles-fan/articleshow/121814828.cms,"Fan tattoos Jason Kelce naked on their leg (Getty Images)

Jason Kelce can’t believe Eagles fan got him tattooed nude







Jason Kelce has always had a unique relationship with Philadelphia Eagles fans — built on mutual love, grit, and a healthy dose of humor. But even the future Hall of Famer was left scratching his head when a rather bold tribute started making rounds on social media.The buzz began when Crossing Broad shared a video featuring a passionate Eagles fan who got a tattoo of Jason Kelce — completely nude, pin-up style. Tattoo artist Joe the Wizard created the unconventional ink, complete with an eagle drawn strategically over Kelce’s groin area. The tattoo, permanently inked on a forearm, quickly went viral for all the obvious reasons.Jason, known as much for his personality as his dominance on the field, took to X (formerly Twitter) after seeing the tattoo and delivered a classic Kelce reaction:""I'm not sure if I should be offended or flattered."" He later replied to his own post, ultimately deciding, ""I think it’s more flattered, it’s a generous bird, good sized head."" That prompted a playful comment from fellow former NFL star Andrew Whitworth, who added,""I was going to say strong Beak!""Kelce’s reaction struck the perfect balance of humor and humility — much like the man himself, who spent 13 seasons with the Eagles, earning six first-team All-Pro selections and anchoring one of the NFL's toughest offensive lines. Even in retirement, Kelce’s popularity hasn’t faded. If anything, his post-football charisma — now amplified by his podcast and TV appearances — is fueling even more fan devotion.However, no one was more surprised than his wife, Kylie Kelce. Commenting on the original TikTok video, she expressed a mix of amusement and disbelief: ""Excuse me???"" She followed that up with, ""I don’t even know where to start.""The tattoo drama comes right as Kylie prepares for Father’s Day festivities.On the June 12 episode of her Not Gonna Lie podcast, Kylie jokingly considered gifting Jason something outrageous to match his unique fashion sense.""I'd probably buy him a banana hammock,” she laughed, referencing the infamous Borat outfit. Then she added with a smile,“Just kidding. Four kids is enough.”Despite the chaos, Kylie did confirm she’s made dinner plans at a restaurant both she and Jason love: “The key is that Jason also loves it, so that's a win-win right there.”From outrageous tattoos to heartfelt family dinners, the Kelce household continues to live at the intersection of hilarity, humility, and heart — making them one of football’s most beloved families.Also Read: Taylor Swift’s fall Sundays are booked, ready to back Travis Kelce’s quest for another Super Bowl: ""She’s not juggling a packed tour schedule""","A philadelphia eagles fan got a nude tattoo of jason kelce on their leg.

After days of unrelenting speculation, Vanessa Bryant took to Instagram Stories on Sunday, June 1, to put the rumors to rest. Her response wasn’t a press statement or a legal warning, it was a wild meme with a big middle finger to the internet trolls. The meme featured music icon Rihanna floating in water with a snorkel mask on her head, holding a drink, and flipping her middle finger.“Me protecting my peace, not pregnant & having fun all summer,” Vanessa Bryant wrote in the caption on her response to the online trolls who spread her pregnancy rumors about five years after her husband, Kobe Bryant ’s, untimely and devastating demise.It was clear, clever, and vintage Vanessa who shut down noise without saying a word about the origin of the gossip. No press release needed when you’ve got Rihanna energy with a direct middle finger gesture.The rumors had emerged out of nowhere, with some users pointing to photos allegedly showing a ""baby bump,"" though no timestamps or context were attached to those images. Vanessa hasn't been publicly linked to anyone romantically, and there’s been zero confirmation from her side—until now.In another Instagram Story later that evening, Vanessa Bryant shared a motivational quote that hinted at how she views the entire situation and what matters to her personally.“The only way to impress me, is by being a good person,” the quote read. “I don’t care what you have, what you wear, where you live, or what you drive. I just have deep respect for people with pure hearts and good intentions.”Adding one final touch to her trilogy of clapbacks, she posted another Rihanna meme, this one stating, “I’m not mean, I’m just not the one.”With the classic Rihanna memes, Vanessa showed that she is busy being a proud mom to her daughters while being the powerhouse of her business ventures. While she does not care about the rumor mill, her reaction explicitly showed that she is urging privacy.Vanessa Bryant, who shares four daughters with Kobe— Natalia, Bianka, Capri, and the late Gianna— has remained devoted to family and philanthropy. Most recently, she shared footage of a joyful family ski trip over the holidays, showing the tight-knit bond she maintains with her children.Vanessa and Kobe Bryant tied the knot in April 2001. Tragically, in January 2020, Kobe and their 13-year-old daughter Gianna lost their lives in a helicopter crash that also killed seven others. They were headed to Kobe’s Mamba Sports Academy for a youth basketball game when the accident occurred. Kobe was 41 at the time. The loss shook the sports world and left a lasting impact on fans, friends, and loved ones across the globe. Kobe has left a huge legacy to his name as well, he is considered one the of the elite NBA superstars of all time with astounding stats, records and intense playmaking abilities. His demise created a huge void in the NBA world as fans are still mourning his untimely passing.Since their passing, she’s kept their memory alive through meaningful business ventures and charitable work. Kobe launched the Mamba Sports Foundation in 2016, aiming to support young athletes. After his death, Vanessa renamed it the Mamba & Mambacita Sports Foundation in honor of both Kobe and Gianna. Today, the foundation helps underserved boys and girls in sports, pushing forward the mission they believed in. It's her way of carrying on their legacy with purpose and heart.Vanessa Bryant’s response was indeed witty and empowering as she hinted that she deserves privacy and reminded the world that while she may be a public figure, her peace and dignity aren’t up for debate, especially not over unfounded gossip. After the viral response via memes, Vanessa has seemingly closed the chapter as she did not extend the matter any further with any other comments about it afterwards.Also Read: Is Vanessa Bryant pregnant with her 5th child?

How Wiggins Fits With LeBron and Doncic





Theare weighing their options this offseason, and according to a popular NBA analyst, one potential move involves swapping a key forward for a proven NBA champion.The Los Angeles Lakers have two clear paths in free agency: pursuing a dominant center or trading for an experienced wing player to bolster their championship aspirations. According to recent reports, the franchise may lean toward the latter by targeting Miami Heat star Andrew Wiggins.Lake Show Life’s Svyatoslav Rovenchuk suggests the Lakers could package forward Rui Hachimura in a deal to acquire Wiggins from the Miami Heat.""The fit of Rui Hachimura alongside (Luka) Doncic and (LeBron) James has quickly come under scrutiny after a premature first-round exit to the Minnesota Timberwolves,"" Rovenchuk wrote. ""This has led many to believe the Lakers are better off trading the starting forward."" (H/t: Sporting News)Andrew Wiggins could provide the Los Angeles Lakers with much-needed perimeter scoring and defensive versatility. Here’s why this trade could work:- Salary Match: Hachimura ($17 million) plus another expiring contract could match Wiggins’ $28.2 million salary for 2025-26.- Proven Playoff Performer: Wiggins was instrumental in Golden State’s 2022 title run, averaging 17.2 points and 4.5 rebounds per game.- Immediate Upgrade: While Hachimura is solid, Wiggins offers better two-way impact and championship experience.Once considered an underachieving talent in Minnesota, Wiggins revitalized his career with the Golden State Warriors . His improved motor and efficiency made him a key piece in Golden State’s success.However, after a slow start in 2024-25, the Warriors traded him to Miami in the Jimmy Butler deal.Wiggins’ skill set complements the Lakers’ star duo:- Reliable three-point shooting for better floor spacing.- Strong perimeter defense to ease the load on LeBron James.- Playoff-tested mentality, crucial for deep postseason runs.With the Heat struggling, Wiggins may welcome a move to a contender like the Lakers.While Hachimura has been a steady presence, Wiggins represents a clear upgrade for a Los Angeles Lakers team in win-now mode. If Los Angeles can structure the right deal, adding the former Warriors champion could be the move that pushes them back into title contention.","The los angeles lakers have two clear paths in free agency: pursuing a dominant center or trading for an experienced wing player.

New look, new game: How Travis Kelce’s transformation reflects a career reboot





Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce has once again found himself at the center of attention—but this time, it's not for his jaw-dropping touchdown grabs or viral podcast moments. Instead, the three-time Super Bowl champion has debuted a brand-new look that has fans and critics alike buzzing, and it may say more about his mindset than it does about his hair.Kelce appeared at his cousin Tanner Corum’s wedding in Knoxville, Tennessee, with noticeably longer hair—a sharp departure from the polished, clean-cut image he’s carried for much of his career. Accompanying him was none other than Taylor Swift , making yet another public splash for one of pop culture’s most talked-about couples.While photos of Kelce’s new hairstyle quickly went viral, social media reactions were anything but unanimous. One fan joked, “Looks like someone’s grandfather,” poking fun at the dramatic transformation. But others praised the look, interpreting it as a sign of growth—both personal and professional.And that interpretation may hold weight.After a difficult 2024 season that ended in a crushing Super Bowl LIX loss to the Philadelphia Eagles, retirement whispers grew louder for the 35-year-old tight end. But instead of walking away, Kelce doubled down, signing a reported $17 million extension to stay with the Chiefs.According to those close to the team, Kelce’s energy has shifted. He’s leaned into wellness, taken up padel as a low-impact fitness tool, and slimmed down considerably. “He looks like he’s dropped a few pounds and is moving better than I’ve seen in a while,” a Chiefs insider shared. Even Patrick Mahomes commented that Kelce looks “fresher” and “leaner” heading into 2025.While Kelce’s commitment to excellence on the field is nothing new, his relationship with Taylor Swift has added an extra layer to his off-field persona. Whether it’s showing up at weddings or appearing in commercials, Kelce seems more comfortable than ever in the spotlight.Also Read: Is Travis Kelce preparing for a graceful NFL exit? 5 veterans who might retire after the 2025 season With his physical transformation, mindset reset, and strong connection with Mahomes still intact, the Chiefs veteran is clearly not done chasing greatness.

'Cricketers Aren’t Cattle... ': Harish Thawani on the IPL and Business of Indian Cricket





NEW DELHI: Former India spinner Harbhajan Singh has backed young left-hander Sai Sudharsan to bat at No. 3 in India’s upcoming five-Test series in England, calling it a crucial opportunity for the youngster.""In my opinion, Sai Sudharsan should play at No.3. He's a left-hander, in top form, and just came off a very impressive IPL. His technique is sound, and I believe he could be the solution at that position,"" Harbhajan said, as quoted by IANS.The Indian squad for the England tour indicates a substantial change. Following the retirement of veterans like Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli and R Ashwin from the format, an altered 18-member team will compete under 25-year-old Shubman Gill 's leadership, with Rishabh Pant serving as his deputy.Selection head Ajit Agarkar explained that Jasprit Bumrah was not considered for captaincy due to workload management concerns.""Gill is a new captain, and the team is quite young — there's no Rohit, Virat, Pujara, or even Ajinkya Rahane. It's going to be challenging, but I expect our youngsters to rise to the occasion and perform well,"" Harbhajan said.He requested supporters and analysts to remain understanding during the team's development: ""Just because they don't win right away doesn't mean we start criticising them.The team needs support right now. They're going through a transitional phase — a new team, a new era — and I hope it turns out to be a successful one for Indian cricket.""""The team needs to believe in themselves — believe that they can win. This team has the ability,"" Harbhajan added. ""These are the same youngsters — Shubman Gill, Rishabh Pant — who broke Australia's fortress at the Gabba. Now it's their turn to make history again. The opportunity is massive, and they should grab it with both hands.""The squad selection features first-time Test call-ups for B. Sai Sudharsan and Arshdeep Singh, whilst Karun Nair and Shardul Thakur return. The exclusion of Shreyas Iyer and Mohammed Shami has generated discussion, with both fans and former captain Sourav Ganguly expressing concerns about Iyer's omission.""Shreyas Iyer is a very fine player. He's proven himself in ODIs, performed in the World Cup, Champions Trophy, and IPL. So yes, he should've been in the squad. But maybe the selectors don't see him as a red-ball player right now,"" Harbhajan said. ""If I were part of the selection committee, I would have considered him. But this is not the end — his journey is long, and he might even be a future ODI captain. One missed tour doesn't mean his career is over.

NEW DELHI: Young Indian batter Sarfaraz Khan made a special visit to Lord’s on Thursday alongside his father and long-time coach, Naushad Khan , as the second day of the World Test Championship (WTC) Final between Australia and South Africa unfolded in dramatic fashion.Sarfaraz, who shared glimpses of the visit via his Instagram stories, was seen soaking in the atmosphere at the iconic venue, one where he no doubt dreams of making his mark someday.It was a father-son cricket pilgrimage of sorts, with Naushad having famously mentored Sarfaraz and his younger brother Musheer from Mumbai's maidans to international reckoning.On the field, Australia seized control of the WTC Final, largely thanks to a masterclass in fast bowling from skipper Pat Cummins Cummins delivered a sensational spell of 6-28, claiming his 300th Test wicket and dismantling South Africa for just 138.He took four wickets for just one run in a post-lunch burst that shredded the Proteas’ lower order. South Africa had resumed at 43/4 and managed a brief recovery through a 64-run stand between Temba Bavuma (36) and David Bedingham (45), but collapsed shortly after. Kagiso Rabada had earlier starred with the ball for South Africa, taking 5-51, and he returned in the second innings to remove both Usman Khawaja and Cameron Green in the same over.At tea, Australia were 32-2, holding a 106-run lead with Marnus Labuschagne and Steve Smith at the crease.As Sarfaraz watched from the stands, he witnessed not just a gripping day of Test cricket but also a landmark moment in Cummins’s career, capped by a standing ovation from the Lord’s crowd, a far cry from the jeers he received during the 2023 Ashes for the Bairstow incident.","Sarfaraz khan visits lord's with father and long-time coach, naushad khan.

Stephen Curry’s Influence Extends Beyond Basketball as He Builds a Fanbase the NBA Never Had

Magic Johnson joins Get Up! 👏 His message to Luka Doncic 🗣️ 'IN LA, WE EXPECT CHAMPIONSHIPS!' 🏆





Drawing in a massive following of young fans and rewriting the rules of basketball, Stephen Curry is not just altering the Golden State Warriors — he’s changing the definition of an NBA superstar. Magic Johnson, the Lakers icon, pointed out on ESPN’s Get Up that Curry’s reach is much greater than his remarkable four NBA championships, two MVPs, and exceptional shooting ability. Discover how this superstar has connected generations, influenced the culture, and claimed his position at the top of the game.Magic Johnson didn’t hold back — “kids love Steph Curry… they love how he shoots the basketball, but also how he carries himself.” That feeling really sums up what makes Curry so special—his influence goes way past the usual basketball stats. For sure, Curry broke records—more than 3,390 career three-pointers, the highest in NBA history—and he was the first player to be a unanimous MVP in 2016, helping the Warriors achieve a 73-win season.The magic of Curry lies in his ability to pull in a new generation of fans—kids who admire his long-range shooting and his chill demeanor.This isn’t just luck — Curry is among the NBA’s leading jersey sellers, and his family-oriented image featuring adorable snapshots of his daughter Riley and wife Ayesha—is crucial to his widespread brand influence.Curry's on-court achievements really solidify his impact: he's got four championships (2015, 2017, 2018, 2022), one Finals MVP, and two league MVPs, with one being the only unanimous choice ever. His success has propelled the Warriors to worldwide fame and sparked a change in basketball strategy—now, hitting deep threes is a must.According to Magic Johnson, Curry’s greatness isn’t just in scoring—it’s in making his teammates better: “there’s very few guys… who’s ever made their teammates better.” Curry's selfless style of play, shown through his knack for assisting, leadership qualities, and mentor-like vibe, has built strong trust and unity in Golden State.Also Read: Tyrese Haliburton scores 22 points in NBA Finals Game 3 and then roasts his dad John Haliburton Beyond basketball, Curry's impact keeps growing through charity work and cultural projects.

Peja Stojakovic Accuses Rich Paul of Blackmail in De’Aaron Fox Trade From Sacramento Kings to San Antonio Spurs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/peja-stojakovic-accuses-rich-paul-of-blackmail-in-deaaron-fox-trade-from-sacramento-kings-to-san-antonio-spurs/articleshow/121812022.cms,"(Image Source- Getty Images)

Peja Stojakovic claims Rich Paul controlled De’Aaron Fox trade destination to the San Antonio Spurs





What began as an exciting three-team trade has now turned into a scandal. Peja Stojakovic, the former Sacramento Kings star and executive, has made a shocking claim — he says that agent Rich Paul essentially ""blackmailed"" the Kings into trading De’Aaron Fox to the San Antonio Spurs, not for the best deal, but to push Klutch Sports’ interests.On the NBA Out of Bounds and NBA Mozzart podcasts, Peja Stojakovic mentioned that Rich Paul gave a ""directive"" about where De’Aaron Fox should go, essentially ""blackmailing the Kings"" into sealing the deal with the San Antonio Spurs. Consequently, Sacramento Kings was said to have missed out on the chance to consider offers from other teams, which Peja Stojakovic thinks restricted their negotiation options.At the center of the deal was a three-team swap in February 2025 that sent De’Aaron Fox and Jordan McLaughlin to the San Antonio Spurs, while Zach LaVine, another Rich Paul client, landed in Sacramento King from the Chicago Bulls, along with multiple future draft selections. The Kings received three first-round picks (for 2025, 2027 and 2031) plus three seconds, and flipped prospect Sidy Cissoko for center Jonas Valanciunas.Statistically, De’Aaron Fox had impressive stats in his 17 games with the San Antonio Spurs, averaging 19.7 points, 6.8 assists, and 4.3 rebounds before a finger injury at the end of the season put him out of action.On the other hand, Zach LaVine joined Sacramento’s backcourt, but the team ended up with a 40–42 record and didn’t make the playoffs.Peja Stojakovic believes that if the Kings had explored more options for trading De’Aaron Fox, they could have gotten a better return than just draft picks and one standout player.This isn't the first time Rich Paul has faced accusations of manipulating things behind the scenes: critics were quick to blame him during the Anthony Davis trade to the Lakers back in 2019.Now, the growing claims from a well-respected former executive highlight how influential agents, particularly those representing several high-profile clients, can sway trade dynamics and impact franchise decisions.Peja Stojakovic's statements make us rethink if NBA trades are just a front-office thing or if agents like Rich Paul actually have a say in the matter. If teams are limited by what their clients want, especially with the risk of losing star players, it seems like the power dynamics in trade discussions could be changing. For Kings fans, the lingering question is: was De'Aaron Fox really worth the price they paid?","Peja stojakovic claims rich paul controlled de’aaron fox trade destination to the san antonio spurs.

NEW DELHI: Australia skipper Pat Cummins delivered a breathtaking bowling performance at Lord’s, grabbing 6 for 28 to rip through South Africa’s batting order and tilt the World Test Championship final heavily in his side’s favour.Cummins’s masterclass saw him register his 14th five-wicket haul in Tests and reach a major personal milestone, surpassing Indian great Bishan Singh Bedi and matching Richie Benaud with nine five-fors as a Test captain, the second-most in history behind Pakistan's Imran Khan (12).The South African innings collapsed spectacularly on Day 2, skittled out for just 138 in reply to Australia’s modest 212.Cummins, who had already taken two wickets in the morning session, returned after lunch to produce a blistering burst, four wickets for one run in just 17 balls, leaving South Africa reeling.Temba Bavuma and David Bedingham had briefly steadied the ship with a 64-run partnership for the fifth wicket. Bavuma, who started the day on 3 not out, showed some fight with a stylish six off Cummins and a lofted drive off Starc, but was dismissed soon after, caught at cover by a diving Marnus Labuschagne.Cummins struck again quickly after lunch, removing Kyle Verreynne lbw and trapping Marco Jansen for a duck in the same over. He then ended Bedingham’s 111-ball effort by inducing an edge to the keeper before the lower order completely disintegrated.A farcical run-out of Keshav Maharaj only added to South Africa’s woes, and Cummins fittingly wrapped up the innings with his 300th Test wicket, dismissing Kagiso Rabada , caught at deep square leg by Beau Webster.With this performance, Cummins not only reaffirmed his status as one of the premier fast bowlers of his generation but also etched his name alongside the game’s greats as a captain who leads by fiery example.",Australia captain pat cummins takes 6 for 28 on day 2 of world test championship final.
