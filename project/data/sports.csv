When is Lamar Jackson returning to the field? Ravens star confirms comeback and sparks locker-room shake-up ahead of Dolphins clash,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/when-is-lamar-jackson-returning-to-the-field-ravens-star-confirms-comeback-and-sparks-locker-room-shake-up-ahead-of-dolphins-clash/articleshow/124926500.cms,"Lamar Jackson is back for the Baltimore Ravens, boosting team confidence and offensive rhythm for their crucial game against the Miami Dolphins. His dual-threat ability and leadership are expected to revitalize the team's dynamic play. This return marks a significant moment as the Ravens aim for a strong resurgence after a period of inconsistency.

Lamar Jackson’s return reshapes Baltimore’s identity and confidence

A defining test awaits as Ravens aim for resurgence



Baltimore Ravens fans can finally breathe a sigh of relief, Lamar Jackson is officially back. After weeks of uncertainty surrounding his hamstring injury, the Ravens quarterback has been cleared to play in Thursday night’s high-stakes matchup against the Miami Dolphins. His return comes at a critical juncture in Baltimore’s season, as the team looks to rebound from an inconsistent start and regain its offensive rhythm.For the first time in weeks, head coach John Harbaugh will have a fully healthy 53-man roster, a welcome change after a series of injuries derailed the Ravens’ early momentum. Jackson’s reappearance not only restores Baltimore’s dynamic offense but also revives the leadership that the team has sorely missed.The former MVP’s impact extends well beyond the stat sheet. His dual-threat capability—both as a passer and a runner, forces opposing defenses to cover every inch of the field. With Jackson back under center, offensive coordinator Greg Roman can reintroduce designed quarterback runs, play-action schemes, and deep passing routes that have long been hallmarks of Baltimore’s success.But Jackson’s influence isn’t purely tactical. His leadership has quietly transformed the Ravens’ locker room over the past few weeks.In a move that grabbed headlines, Jackson reportedly asked for table games like ping-pong to be removed from team facilities, emphasizing focus over fun. It wasn’t about cutting out camaraderie, it was a message about accountability. The quarterback made it clear that celebration would return only once the team rediscovered its winning rhythm.The Ravens managed to snap a four-game losing streak last week behind backup Tyler Huntley, a victory that gave them a glimmer of hope before Jackson’s return. Now, Baltimore faces a resurgent Miami Dolphins defense, a perfect test of whether their restored health can translate into consistent performance.Jackson’s readiness couldn’t have come at a better time. If his confidence matches his physical recovery, Baltimore’s offense may finally return to the explosive, clock-controlling form that once made them a powerhouse in the AFC North. For a team searching for momentum, Lamar Jackson’s comeback feels less like a return and more like a revival.Also Read: Brittany Mahomes' heartwarming hidden detail in her Chiefs game day outfit proves she’s Patrick Mahomes’ No. 1 cheerleader","Lamar jackson is back for the baltimore ravens, boosting team confidence and offensive rhythm for their crucial game against the miami dolphins.

Cam Newton Breaks Down What REALLY Happened With That Mascot on Live TV

Cam Newton reflects on lessons and reactions



Cam Newton has finally addressed the viral clip showing him in a heated moment with Alabama A&M’s mascot “Butch” during ESPN’s First Take live event in Birmingham. The former NFL star insists the interaction wasn’t as serious as it appeared online, saying the entire exchange was meant in good humor.During the 4th and 1 podcast, Newton said the short clip that made headlines didn’t tell the full story. “Everything was all in good fun,” he explained. “If people really wanted to dig deep, they could’ve dug deeper in finding the other clip, but that was the only clip you saw. What am I gonna do? I’m gonna let it air out.”The incident took place on October 24 at Legion Field in Birmingham, ahead of the Magic City Classic between Alabama A&M and Alabama State. As part of the pregame festivities, the schools’ mascots took part in a 40-yard dash. When Newton celebrated with the winning mascot, Butch appeared to take offense, leading to a brief shoving exchange that aired live on television.The clip quickly went viral, with fans and even Birmingham Mayor Randall Woodfin initially believing it was a genuine fight. But Newton cleared the air, saying, “I just thank God no one got hurt, as we were doing what we were doing.It was all in good fun.”Newton, 36, added that the situation reminded him of a valuable life lesson from his father, Cecil Newton Sr. “Son, you can be on top of the world. The next day, the world’s gonna be on top of you,” his father once told him — a line that perfectly fits how quickly online moments can spiral out of control.The former Heisman Trophy winner also used humor to lighten the mood, joking that Butch should thank him for becoming “Meme of the Year.” Despite the chaos that followed, Newton emphasized the importance of perspective, reminding fans that not everything seen online reflects reality.“Everything was playful, but it didn’t look like it was playful,” he added. For Newton, the moment was a lighthearted misunderstanding that snowballed into viral frenzy — proof that in today’s digital age, even the most harmless moments can take on a life of their own.Also Read: Patrick Mahomes breaks silence with bold four-word message about ‘hostile’ Bills fans before AFC showdown","Cam newton says viral mascot altercation was all in fun.

"Governor Jeff Landry declares war on LSU leadership, blocks Scott Woodward from choosing next coach after Brian Kelly's costly fallout",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/governor-jeff-landry-declares-war-on-lsu-leadership-blocks-scott-woodward-from-choosing-next-coach-after-brian-kellys-costly-fallout/articleshow/124926269.cms,"Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry has asserted that the LSU Board of Supervisors, not Athletic Director Scott Woodward, will select the next head football coach. Landry cited concerns over costly buyouts and potential conflicts of interest, stating, ""I’m tired of rewarding failure."" This unexpected power shift signals a new focus on fiscal responsibility for the prominent athletic program.

Governor Jeff Landry says the Board will take charge of hiring LSU’s next coach

Scott Woodward’s legacy questioned amid Kelly fallout and costly contracts

A defining moment for LSU’s football future

Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry made a bold statement this week that sent shockwaves through Baton Rouge’s sports and political circles. Following the sudden firing of LSU head football coach Brian Kelly , Landry announced that Athletic Director Scott Woodward will not be the one choosing Kelly’s replacement, a decision that immediately sparked debate about power, accountability, and the future of LSU football.During a press conference primarily focused on SNAP benefits amid the ongoing government shutdown, Gov. Landry didn’t hold back when questioned about the Tigers’ coaching search. “I can tell you right now, Scott Woodward is not selecting the next coach,” Landry said. “The Board of Supervisors is going to come up with a committee and they are going to find us a coach.”The statement came as a surprise even to LSU’s Board of Supervisors, whose chair, Scott Ballard, told reporters that the group “had no idea” they’d be handling the decision. Still, Ballard appeared ready to embrace the challenge, saying, “Well then, I better get to it!” as he exited an interview with WBRZ.The development marks an unusual shift in control for one of the most high-profile athletic programs in the country, especially given that athletic directors typically oversee such hiring decisions.Scott Woodward, who took over as LSU’s athletic director in 2019, has built a reputation as a big-game hunter when it comes to coaching hires, previously bringing in big names like Jimbo Fisher at Texas A&M and Brian Kelly at LSU.But Governor Landry was clear that he doesn’t want a repeat of those costly arrangements.“Right now we have a $53 million liability and we are not doing that again,” Landry said, referring to Kelly’s buyout. “I’m tired of rewarding failure in this country.”Landry also hinted at potential conflicts of interest, noting that “the agent who wrote Fisher’s contract represents both Woodward, Kelly and some players.” Kelly is represented by Trace Armstrong, while Fisher’s agent is Jimmy Sexton, both major figures in college sports negotiations.The power shift suggests Landry and the LSU Board intend to prioritize fiscal responsibility and performance over prestige in choosing the next head coach. As the search intensifies, all eyes will be on Baton Rouge, not just to see who leads the Tigers next, but who truly holds the reins of Louisiana’s most influential football program.Also Read: “Just being cruel”: Benedict Polizzi faces backlash after mocking Mark Sanchez’s stabbing with controversial Halloween costume",Governor jeff landry says lsu board of supervisors will choose next head coach.

It is the longest active streak in the NHL and highlights his growing status as one of the league’s most consistent and effective playmakers.Between the pipes, Jakub Dobes improved to a flawless 6-0-0 this season. The rookie netminder made 18 saves, staying poised even as the Canadiens’ lead slipped away during Seattle’s late surge. His steady presence continues to be a major bright spot for Montreal’s rebuilding roster.After the win, the milestone moment took center stage online. Canadiens captain Nick Suzuki shared the team’s celebratory graphic on Instagram and gave Caufield a simple but fitting nickname: “Mr. OT”. It captured exactly what Caufield has become. When the pressure rises, he delivers. The Canadiens earned a huge road win and showcased why their young core is widely viewed as the future of the franchise.

After spending around three minutes against the Indiana Pacers on Sunday, October 26, Anthony Edwards had to exit the court suddenly due to an injury in his right hamstring. Then, on Monday, October 27, he was reported to miss the game against the Denver Nuggets. With the Minnesota Timberwolves now set to take on the Los Angeles Lakers on October 29, the burning question remains as to whether or not Edwards' playing. He is actually doubtful to suit up for the Wolves against the Lakers.Due to a hamstring injury, Minnesota Timberwolves guard Anthony Edwards exited Sunday night's game against the Indiana Pacers early and did not return. The three-time All-Star returned to the locker room after complaining of stiffness in his right hamstring. He would not participate in the games going forward, the Timberwolves later declared.According to ESPN's Shams Charania, Edwards was ruled out for the game against the Denver Nuggets and will miss two weeks due to a health issue. It means that he won't be able to play in any of Minnesota's next games.Edwards is officially labelled as OUT on the team's most recent injury report, indicating that the Timberwolves will be without their top guard for the foreseeable future.Minnesota is playing the second night of a back-to-back and trying to keep up early-season momentum, so the setback comes at a difficult time.For the Wolves, his absence is a huge blow. The 23-year-old set the tone for what appeared to be an MVP-caliber season by scoring 41 points in the first game and then 31 points in the second. To allow their star player time to heal, the Timberwolves will be inclined to let Anthony Edwards rest for the time being.On Wednesday night, the Los Angeles Lakers will travel to play the Minnesota Timberwolves in a Western Conference matchup. However, their star player Anthony Edwards is not well. In addition, the Timberwolves' injury report for Wednesday's game includes another player. Due to a left calf strain, Jaylen Clark's availability for the game is uncertain.Now, the Timberwolves have suffered a severe setback, and while Edwards is out, Terrence Shannon Jr. and Mike Conley may be given bigger roles.Edwards participated in at least 72 games in his NBA career, including some from the last season. Therefore, it will be difficult for the rest of the team to make up for his prolonged absence.He is shooting 51.9 percent from the field and 47.4 percent from three-point range this season, averaging 25.7 points, 4.0 rebounds, and 2.0 assists per game. He should be able to make a comeback in two weeks and continue to compete for postseason honors.Also read: Is Sam Merrill playing tonight?

NBA official report confirms Jaylen Brown’s probable status ahead of Boston Celtics vs Cleveland Cavaliers

Boston Celtics prepare for Cleveland Cavaliers matchup as 4.5-point underdogs

Jaylen Brown is now listed as probable for the Boston Celtics game against the Cleveland Cavaliers, as per the latest injury report from the NBA. This is an improvement from his previous questionable status, as he works on recovering from a left hamstring strain. Head coach Joe Mazzulla mentioned that the team is hopeful Brown will be able to play, but they will keep an eye on him right up until tip-off. With Jayson Tatum still out, Brown's involvement could significantly impact Boston's offense tonight.As per the NBA's official injury report, Jaylen Brown is listed as probable due to a left hamstring strain as part of his injury management. This is a step up from his previous 'questionable' status in the days before the game. The report, put together by the NBA team athletic trainers and sent to the league office, clearly states the condition as ""Injury/Illness - Left Hamstring; Strain Injury Management"" for Brown.ESPN's injury tracker, which was updated right after the official announcement, confirmed this status, saying Brown is ""probable"" and expected to play even with the lingering hamstring issue. This careful optimism fits with the probable tag, which generally shows a high chance of participation over 75% in most instances unless something unexpected comes up.With Jaylen Brown likely to play, the Celtics are set to face off against the Cavaliers tonight at 7:30 p.m. ET, coming in as 4.5-point underdogs. The Celveland Cavaliers are strengthened by Donovan Mitchell and Evan Mobley, but they're missing Garland. Cleveland's wing defense is weakened without Max Strus and Isaac Okoro, who was traded during the offseason, which means De'Andre Hunter is their main perimeter defender, this could work in Brown's favor for his slashing and pull-up shots.Boston's 1-3 record features narrow defeats against teams that are likely to make the playoffs, but Tatum's injury has pushed Brown into a 30% usage role. A victory tonight could help solidify the rotation, with Brown stepping up as the emotional leader; his four All-Star selections and 2024 Finals MVP experience establish him as the clear alpha.Also Read: Golden State Warriors vs Los Angeles Clippers (28/10/25) - Key moments, highlights more","Nba official report confirms jaylen brown’s probable status ahead of boston celtics vs cleveland cavaliers.

He suffered a dislocated ankle, a fibula fracture, and a deltoid ligament rupture, all of which will need a long recovery. He had surgery Sunday night to close the open wound, and the Giants said he was released from the hospital Monday morning. Soon after, Skattebo posted an emotional message thanking fans and sharing his determination to recover. It read, “Thank you everyone for the support!! Surgery went well. I just want to thank the city of Philly for taking the best care of me... This is just the beginning of my journey and I can’t wait to show you guys all about it!!! GOD has a plan for me, stick the course and it will all work itself out, BRB 🫡 #LFG.”The decision to operate so quickly raised questions among fans, but medical experts say there was no time to wait. The injury caused an open fracture, creating a risk of infection that required immediate treatment. Dr. Guillem Gonzalez-Lomas, an orthopedic surgeon at NYU Grossman School of Medicine (who did not treat Skattebo), explained the urgency and said, “An open injury is considered an orthopedic emergency… The big concern is that the sterile inside can be contaminated by bacteria on the dirty outside and you can have an infection complicate whatever injury you have. ” He noted that performing surgery right away was likely essential to preventing long-term complications.Head coach Brian Daboll described the situation as a “long road” to recovery for his young running back. Experts estimate Skattebo’s rehab could take up to eight months, meaning his focus now shifts toward being ready for training camp in 2026. Dr. Gonzalez-Lomas added that recovery will depend heavily on how his body responds over time. He said, “The devil is in the details... The main thing is you want to be like Goldilocks: You want to be doing everything just right. ”While the injury marks a tough break for one of the Giants’ most promising young players, Skattebo’s positive mindset and faith suggest this may just be another step in a long NFL journey.","Giants rookie jacob skattebo undergoes emergency surgery.

Nuggets Await Nikola Jokic’s Game-Time Decision

’ matchup against the New Orleans Pelicans on October 29, 2025, due to an elbow injury. The reigning MVP’s status remains uncertain as the Nuggets await the coaching staff’s final assessment ahead of tip-off. Jokic’s availability will be determined after pregame updates, leaving Denver fans anxious about whether their star center will take the court tonight.Jamal Murray also appears on the Nuggets’ injury report as questionable with an ankle issue, adding further concern to Denver’s lineup situation. However, the more pressing injury storyline centers around forward Cameron Johnson, who signed a $94.5 million deal and is now dealing with a right shoulder injury sustained during the recent contest against the Minnesota Timberwolves.Johnson was forced to exit the game early but showed strong mental toughness by returning to try and play through the pain. Unfortunately, his discomfort intensified in the fourth quarter, forcing him back to the locker room for further evaluation. His injury now poses a major question mark for the Nuggets’ rotation heading into tonight’s matchup.Nikola Jokic has been in top form this season, recording multiple triple-doubles and anchoring Denver’s dominant start.His impact extends far beyond scoring - he remains the focal point of Denver’s offense, controlling tempo, spacing, and ball movement. Without him, the Nuggets risk losing their offensive rhythm and interior control, especially against a Pelicans team that has struggled but still possesses strong frontcourt talent.Denver’s success largely depends on Jokic’s ability to facilitate plays and lead both offensively and defensively. If he’s unable to play, the team will need significant contributions from its bench and secondary scorers to maintain their winning form.While the Nuggets deal with lineup instability, the New Orleans Pelicans are hoping to take advantage of the situation and end their recent struggles. The Pelicans have had difficulty finding consistency this season, and a win over Denver - especially at Ball Arena - would provide a much-needed confidence boost.With potential absences of Jokic and Johnson, the Pelicans could exploit mismatches in the paint and push for an aggressive offensive approach. However, Denver’s depth and home-court advantage still make them formidable opponents even when short-handed.The Denver Nuggets will host the New Orleans Pelicans at Ball Arena, with tip-off scheduled for 9 p.m. EST. The game will be broadcast locally and available for streaming on NBA League Pass and various other platforms for fans eager to follow the action live.In summary, Nikola Jokic’s participation remains uncertain for tonight’s game against the Pelicans, as he continues to manage elbow soreness. The final decision on his status will come shortly before game time.

Back in 2020, the then New Orleans Saints safety C.J. Gardner-Johnson was punched twice by the then Chicago Bears wide receiver Javon Wims. And now, after going in and out of five NFL teams, the 27-year-old safety has found a home in the Bears. It is no wonder a fan shared a flashback video of Wims punching Gardner-Johnson with the caption: “Wild how things have come full circle. ” Another questioned, “Wait, was that the last time he was at Soldier Field??? 😬.” A third fan wrote, “I never understood what set Wims off.”February with the Philadelphia Eagles. March with the Houston Texans. September with the Baltimore Ravens. October with the Chicago Bears! Maybe the first player in NFL history to be in and out of teams within a span of a few months—February to October, in particular! NFL Insider Adam Schefter dropped the crucial news of C.J. Gardner-Johnson being chosen by Ben Johnson’s Chicago Bears. The Insider wrote on X, “Bears are signing S Chauncey Gardner-Johnson to their active roster after his visit yesterday, per his agents Kevin Conner and Robert Brown of @unisportsmgmt. Gardner-Johnson now reunites with Bears DC Dennis Allen, who coached him with the New Orleans Saints.”Midway through the third quarter of the 2020 season’s game between the Chicago Bears and the New Orleans Saints, Bears wide receiver Javon Wims walked up to Saints safety C.J.Gardner-Johnson. Wims supposedly pulled out the safety’s mouthpiece or tapped on his chest. When Gardner-Johnson turned to look at him, Wims punched him in the helmet. Gardner-Johnson did not immediately retaliate and simply blankly stared at Wims, who then punched him a second time. At that point, NFL referees intervened, a flag was thrown, and Saints cornerback Janoris Jenkins jumped in the fray. An NBC Sports report from November 2, 2020 indicated that Wims and Gardner-Johnson had been talking after an earlier play when the safety had grabbed Wims’ mouthpiece off his facemask and thrown it to the ground. In the Bears’ next possession, Wims retaliated with the punches. For violating of unsportsmanlike conduct rules, the NFL suspended Javon Wims for two games without pay.","Chicago bears sign safety c.j. Gardner-johnson to their active squad.

Aljamain Sterling on Tom Aspinall’s reaction in the cage

“When Tommy got poked in the eye, the first thing he said was, ‘I cannot see.’

… You can’t say those words; otherwise, the referee is inclined to stop the fight.”

“I got illegally kneed, blasted in the head … I know if I said that I’m done the fight is over.”

Inside the UFC 321 eye-poke incident between Tom Aspinall and Ciryl Gane



“The whole narrative on oh Tom wanted out, he was losing the fight, he found a way out… You’re talking about the guy that fought Sergei Pavlovich… You’re telling me that guy was looking for a way out?”

“Don’t be mad at me.”

On 25 October 2025, during UFC 321 at the Etihad Arena in Abu Dhabi, England’s heavyweight champion Tom Aspinall faced off against France’s former interim champion Ciryl Gane. Midway through the first round, Gane accidentally poked Aspinall in the eyes and the fight was declared a no-contest. Former bantamweight champion Aljamain Sterling has since weighed in, insisting Tom Aspinall should have handled the situation differently and he’s stood firm despite a backlash.Aljamain Sterling’s view is clear: when Tom Aspinall said “I cannot see” after the eye poke, that wording alone pressured the referee to stop the fight.On his YouTube channel, Sterling said,Sterling added he isn’t questioning Aspinall’s integrity. He said, “I never questioned Tommy’s integrity.” Yet he felt Aspinall should have asked for the full five-minute recovery window instead of immediately signalling he couldn’t continue.Fans were quick to respond on social media after Sterling’s comments went public. Some felt Sterling was unfair, given Sterling himself once won his title via disqualification when he was fouled at UFC 259.Sterling referred to that:Tom Aspinall made his first defence of the undisputed heavyweight title against Ciryl Gane at UFC 321. The fight came to a halt at about the 4:35 mark of round one when Gane’s fingers struck both of Aspinall’s eyes as he attempted to block a kick.The injury forced the referee to end the bout as a no-contest. Medical checks after the fight raised concern, as Aspinall was taken to the hospital for further evaluation.Despite panic among fans, his doctor later said there was nothing “dangerous” about the eye injury.

Thesquare off in a regular-season battle on October 29, 2025, as both teams navigate a series of injuries that could heavily influence the outcome. With key stars sidelined, this matchup promises an intense test of depth and resilience for both rosters.The Los Angeles Lakers enter the contest shorthanded, missing several major contributors. LeBron James continues to be out due to right sciatica and is not expected to return until mid-November. Luka Doncic is also sidelined after suffering a left finger sprain and a left lower leg contusion in a recent game against Minnesota. The injury will keep him out for at least another week.Additionally, Gabe Vincent remains unavailable with a left ankle sprain, and Maxi Kleber continues to recover from an abdominal muscle strain. Jaxson Hayes and Marcus Smart are both listed as questionable - Hayes is battling left patellar tendinopathy and has already missed three consecutive games, while Smart is managing a right quadriceps contusion.Adou Thiero remains out following left knee surgery recovery.With these absences, Austin Reaves becomes the focal point of the Lakers’ offense. Reaves has risen to the challenge this season, already posting multiple 40-point performances and playing a key role in keeping the Lakers competitive despite the adversity.The Minnesota Timberwolves will also be without their star guard, Anthony Edwards, who is recovering from a right hamstring strain expected to sideline him for approximately two weeks. Jaylen Clark is listed as questionable with a left calf strain, leaving his availability uncertain for the matchup.Despite these setbacks, Minnesota still boasts capable scorers in Jaden McDaniels and Julius Randle. McDaniels has been impressive, recently notching 25 points and 3 rebounds, while Randle added 24 points in the team’s previous outing. Naz Reid continues to provide reliable production off the bench, contributing valuable scoring and rebounding support to keep Minnesota’s frontcourt strong.The Lakers’ injury woes place tremendous pressure on Austin Reaves , who will once again be tasked with leading the offense in the absence of LeBron James and Luka Doncic. His playmaking, scoring efficiency, and leadership will be critical in keeping Los Angeles afloat. The rest of the Lakers’ rotation will need to step up on both ends of the floor, particularly on defense, to contain Minnesota’s physical lineup.For the Timberwolves, this game presents an opportunity to capitalize on a depleted Lakers squad. McDaniels and Randle are expected to carry the offensive load in Edwards’ absence, while the team’s defensive focus will likely center on limiting Reaves’ production. Fatigue could become a factor for Los Angeles, given the team’s current lack of depth and ongoing injury challenges.Despite the injuries, both teams are expected to bring energy and intensity, with role players having the chance to shine in expanded roles. Fans can look forward to a hard-fought, entertaining matchup as these two Western Conference teams battle for early-season momentum.The game will air nationally on ESPN, with local coverage available on Spectrum SportsNet and FanDuel Sports Network North. Streaming options include NBA League Pass and Fubo, ensuring fans won’t miss a minute of the action.This clash between the Los Angeles Lakers and Minnesota Timberwolves offers more than just a typical regular-season game.

Dallas Mavericks vs Indiana Pacers - Game Prediction

The Dallas Mavericks have a home game in their hands, and this time they will be hosting the Indiana Pacers. Both teams are grappling to hold a decent position this season, but so far, neither has been able to make their mark. The Mavs have played 4 games so far, out of which they have won only 1, while the Pacers have lost all 3 games they have played this season.This will be their first faceoff since their match back in March during the 2024-25 season. Let's get into the details from the two teams, including their predicted starting lineups, injury reports, and more, as the Mavs and the Pacers face each other for the first time this season.The matchup between the Dallas Mavericks and the Indiana Pacers will kick off at 8:30 pm ET on October 29, 2025. The Mavericks will host the Pacers at the American Airlines Center in Dallas, Texas, and the game will be streamed on NBC and Peacock.The Dallas Mavericks, as well as the Indiana Pacers, are both sitting at the rear end of their respective tables, just one spot shy of being #15. The Mavericks have been playing all home games so far this season, and their face-off against the Pacers will be their last one at home for now, before they travel to Detroit for their next game.The Mavs are on a 1-3 run while the Pacers are on a 0-3 run this season, and will both look for a win today.Both teams are heavily replete with injuries - for the home team, Anthony Davis, who finally got to start playing for the Mavs this season since his first game after the trade last February, has been marked questionable for their game against the Pacers - who are even more down, with about 8 players from their squad out with injuries. With both teams down badly, chances are the Mavs will be able to take advantage of having their home court and fans to get a win.Also Read: Boston Celtics vs Cleveland Cavaliers (10-29-2025) game preview: When and where to watch, expected lineup, injury report, prediction, and more","The dallas mavericks and the indiana pacers will face each other for the first time this season.

Drake Maye shows up in costume for a good cause



A breakout season on the field, and a big heart off it



The Patriots’ lasting commitment to community

The New England Patriots traded their game jerseys for costumes this week — and rookie quarterback Drake Maye was front and center. As Halloween approaches, the Patriots teamed up with the Kraft family, the New England Patriots Foundation, and the New England Revolution Foundation to host a special Halloween party for children fighting pediatric cancer. The event took place at Gillette Stadium on October 28, giving kids and their families a chance to forget hospital rooms for a night and simply have fun.Maye, the third overall pick in the 2024 NFL Draft, arrived dressed as Charizard, the fiery Pokémon character, drawing smiles and laughter from everyone there. The young quarterback was joined by teammates Kayshon Boutte, DeMario Douglas, Mack Hollins, Marcus Jones, and Ben Brown, along with team mascot Pat Patriot, the Patriots Cheerleaders, and New England Revolution forward Malcolm Fry and mascot Slyde. More than 40 children from hospitals including Boston Children’s Hospital, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Hasbro Children’s Hospital, Mass General Hospital, UMass Memorial Health, and One Summit attended the event with their families. They took part in Halloween activities like pumpkin decorating, cookie design, and fun games, surrounded by players who made sure every kid felt special.While fans know Maye for his breakout rookie season — with 2,026 passing yards, 15 touchdowns, and just three interceptions — he’s also making an impression off the field.He’s added 250 rushing yards and two more touchdowns on the ground, quickly becoming a fan favorite across New England. But appearances like this show another side of him — one that connects deeply with fans and the local community. “They've been through it, and the fans have been through it the last couple years,” Maye said. “So it's just credit to them. I know the fans have been awesome. Like I said, I think they're the best fans in the league, and they continue to show out every week.”The New England Patriots Foundation, started by Robert Kraft in 1994, continues to help families across the region through year-round programs and partnerships. Its sister organization, the New England Revolution Foundation, launched in 1996, focuses on supporting local initiatives around childhood cancer, social justice, and inclusion. Together, they’ve built a strong community presence — and this Halloween celebration was another reminder that for the Patriots, giving back is just as important as winning on Sundays.","The new england patriots teamed up with the kraft family to host a halloween party for children fighting pediatric cancer.

On Wednesday night, the Boston Celtics and Cleveland Cavaliers will clash at TD Garden in Boston, Massachusetts. The tip-off time is set for 7 p.m. ET. However, the Cavaliers' development may be halted by the recent injury setback. Sam Merrill, their star player, reportedly won't be at their upcoming game. Merrill will have to sit out at least one game due to his health issue after leaving Monday's game against the Detroit Pistons in the first quarter. Friday's encounter with the Toronto Raptors will be his next match.Following a first-round 0-3 after cashing, the Cavaliers bounced back to crush the Detroit Pistons on Monday night as a 2-point favorite and picked up their first cover of the year. On the other hand, the Celtics visited the New Orleans Pelicans, betting as a 4.5-point favorite. The Celtics were led by G Anfernee Simons' 25 points off the bench.However, recently, unfortunate for the Cavs, Sam Merrill has been labelled as OUT for tonight's game against the Boston Celtics due to a right hip injury. Merrill was only able to play 18 minutes because of the injury he sustained during the third quarter of Cleveland's victory over the Detroit Pistons on Monday night.Despite having grasped his hip earlier in the game, Merrill played until the third quarter. Stating the same, Cavs’ head coach Kenny Atkinson said after the win:“He’s hurting.. When Sam can’t come back in the game, it’s [painful]. I think Evan [Mobley] actually hit him in the hip. Somehow they [collided]. Looks like a hip pointer. Those are painful, so we’ll see. But he’s hurting right now.”Aside from Sam Merrill, Max Strus and Darius Garland are also sidelined due to injury . The Cavaliers can start Jaylon Tyson on Wednesday while Darius Garland continues preparing to play in spite of the setback.Sam Merrill was chosen to start for Cleveland in the 2025–26 season to replace Darius Garland and Max Strus. Merrill has had an early-season breakout, averaging 17.3 points on 52.5% shooting from the field and 51.4% from three-point range through the team's first four games.For a Cavaliers squad that was just beginning to establish, Merrill's injury came at the worst possible time. The team's 3-1 start has been largely due to his perimeter shooting, as he has made 18 threes in four games. The rotation had begun to stabilize with De'Andre Hunter's return, but Cleveland will once again need to make adjustments.Merrill has been the Cavaliers' best player in their first three games, according to head coach Kenny Atkinson during Sunday's victory over Milwaukee Bucks . He will now probably look to Lonzo Ball or Jaylon Tyson to replace Merrill. When the Cavaliers host the Toronto Raptors on Friday, October 31, Merrill will have another opportunity to make a comeback.With an average of 4.5 3-point field goals made, Merrill leads the squad. He is shooting 51.5 percent from the field and 51.7 percent from beyond the arc. Hence, it is safe to say that he is a phenomenal player.Also read: Is Jayson Tatum playing tonight?
