Wilyer Abreu's impressive play is compared to that of Aaron Judge and Kyle Tucker

Wilyer Abreu's development and destiny with Boston Red Sox

The Boston Red Sox have delivered a surprise superstar performance at the beginning of the 2025 MLB season. A relatively not-so-famous player earlier is now creating a sensation and being likened to some of the league's top performers. The supporters are taking notice as this athlete's incredible statistics continue to reach new heights.Boston Red Sox 26-year-old right fielder Wilyer Abreu has started the 2025 season on record-high numbers. During his first 11 games, he registered a.424 batting average, posting 14 hits in 33 at-bats. Offensively, he has logged three home runs, three doubles, and 12 run batted in (RBIs). Abreu has walked eight times, reporting a league-high on-base percentage of.537 and an on-base plus slugging (OPS) of 1.324.This type of performance places Abreu among the league's top performers. Notably, only Chicago Cubs' Kyle Tucker and New York Yankees' Aaron Judge have had a Wins Above Replacement (WAR) of 1.0 so early in the season. Tucker and Judge are famously remembered for having huge contracts as well as solid high-level performance.Aaron Judge, known for his powerful hitting, has continued to play impeccably for the Yankees. Similarly, Kyle Tucker has been an iconic player for the Cubs and has been part of their major offensive lineup. Abreu's recent performance statistics are drawing favourable comparisons with such seasoned stars as he highlights the potential contribution towards the Red Sox's season.Wilyer Abreu 's journey here has been one of steady development and resolve. After being acquired by the Boston Red Sox from the Houston Astros in a trade on August 1, 2022, Abreu worked on honing his skills in the minor leagues. Abreu debuted in the Major Leagues on August 22, 2023, and played in 28 games that season, batting.316 with two home runs and 14 RBIs.In the 2024 season, Abreu's playing time expanded as he played in 132 games, with 106 of them being right field starts. He ended the season with a batting average of.253, and 15 home runs and 58 RBIs. His defense was recognized with the Fielding Bible Award and the American League Gold Glove Award for right fielders.Abreu's offseason work ethic and dedication obviously came in handy, as evidenced by his amazing first half of the 2025 campaign. His new plate discipline is particularly astounding, with eight walks and six strikeouts to date, a welcome change from the 125 strikeouts and 40 walks of last year.Even if it is uncertain whether Abreu can maintain this level of performance for the entire season, his early production has been a large reason why the Red Sox have been successful. Pundits and fans alike will be keeping their eyes on what becomes of his season and whether he can keep up with the play of established stars like Aaron Judge and Kyle Tucker.Also Read: Red Sox's Jarren Duran Shares Emotional Journey Through Depression And Recovery In New Netflix Documentary","Boston red sox right fielder wilyer abreu has started the 2025 season on record-high numbers.

“Travis Kelce breaks up with Taylor Swift”: Internet explodes with false breakup rumors as the power couple secretly go off-grid,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/travis-kelce-breaks-up-with-taylor-swift-internet-explodes-with-false-breakup-rumors-as-the-power-couple-secretly-go-off-grid/articleshow/120096599.cms,"Image via Getty Images

What sparked the Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift breakup rumors?

Sources say the couple is “still very much together and in love”

In recent days, social media has been buzzing with rumors suggesting that Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift may have called it quits. The trending phrase “Travis Kelce breaks up with Taylor Swift” quickly made its rounds online, sparking concern among fans. However, sources close to the couple have stepped in to set the record straight — the power couple is still very much together.The speculation began after both Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift noticeably stepped back from the public eye following a whirlwind few months. After the Kansas City Chiefs lost the Super Bowl to the Philadelphia Eagles in February, and with Swift wrapping up the final leg of her record-breaking Eras Tour and attending the Grammys, fans noticed a lack of appearances and updates. This silence was enough to ignite rumors of a possible split.But insiders familiar with the couple’s dynamic have confirmed that the rumors are nothing more than unfounded speculation. The two are still going strong, choosing instead to prioritize rest and downtime after months of demanding schedules.According to a source quoted by US Weekly, “Taylor and Travis are doing great, and they’re still very much together and in love. They’re just taking a break from the public eye. They’re enjoying some R&R after working their butts off, making the most of their time off.” This insight gives fans a clearer picture of what’s really going on — not a breakup, but a much-needed pause from constant public scrutiny.The same source added that both stars are seeking a more grounded lifestyle following months of nonstop media attention, viral moments, and career obligations. “They’re looking to enjoy a ‘normal life’ after some chaotic past months,” the source explained.Despite their effort to stay low-key, the couple’s past outings — from romantic dinners to music festivals — continue to make waves online. A clip from Coachella 2024 recently resurfaced, showing Kelce and Swift walking hand-in-hand, radiating ease and affection.Also Read: Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift savor quiet moments together, amid uncertain future together So, while the internet may be quick to jump to conclusions, fans can breathe easy knowing that this Hollywood-meets-NFL romance is still thriving, just away from the spotlight for now.","Travis kelce and taylor swift are “still very much together and in love,” a source said.

Cody Bellinger gets ill after consuming chicken wings

Trent Grisham and Ben Rice fill in while Cody Bellinger is out

New York Yankees outfielder Cody Bellinger wasn't found in Tuesday's game against the Detroit Tigers' lineup. There was no explanation initially for him missing the lineup, and it had fans scratching their heads trying to make sense of it all. As the game drew closer, manager Aaron Boone revealed the surprising reason for Bellinger's absence. It all started when he ate something the night before.Last Monday night, April 7, 2025, Cody Bellinger ate chicken wings for dinner. Already in the early morning of Tuesday, April 8, he began to feel ill. Vomiting all night, New York Yankees manager Aaron Boone reported. The team believes that he got food poisoning after consuming the chicken wings on Monday night. Aaron Boone informed the journalists before Tuesday's game in Comerica Park in Detroit, Michigan.Boone supplemented, ""Hopefully he's feeling a little bit better now, and we'll see if we can get him going and make him available as the game goes.""Even though Cody Bellinger's condition did not improve in time for the game, the team hopes he will return soon.This condition coincides with a difficult stretch already for Bryant Bellinger. The 28-year-old left-fielder also missed Friday, April 4, and Saturday, April 5, of the Yankees' two-game series against the Pittsburgh Pirates because of a sore back.Now, just a few days back from returning, food poisoning has benched him once more. The Yankees have not shown that he will be available for the team's next game, but he is under close observation by the medical staff of the team.Manager Aaron Boone did mention that none of the other members of the team had any illness, and the rest of the roster was fine. The food seems to have affected Bellinger alone.While Cody Bellinger was out of action, Trent Grisham began in center field. This was Grisham's sixth straight game there. But he would have been in the lineup regardless, as the Yankees were facing Tigers left-handed starter Tarik Skubal.Ben Rice also got some time on the field, becoming the designated hitter. The left-handed batter had to deal with a tough left-on-left matchup against Skubal, but the team believed he was capable of handling it.The Yankees will just keep watching Cody Bellinger's health and see how he's doing before they make any decision on when he'll return to the lineup. At the moment, the team is merely trying to keep the roster healthy and adjust as needed.Also Read: Will Cody Bellinger Play Today Against Detroit Tigers?

When it comes to repping the Eagles, Kevin Hart might’ve just out-fanned every fan on Earth—possibly even the ones in shoulder pad costumes at Lincoln Financial. The Philly-born comedian took his Birds loyalty to the next level, and now even Saquon Barkley is stunned. Why? Because Kevin didn’t just cop some Eagles merch or post a hype video. He bought two—yes, the real, flying, majestic kind—and named one of them after Saquon Barkley himself.

Under the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act, private ownership of eagles is banned in the U.S. without a federal permit—and violations can lead to heavy fines or jail time.

Will LeBron James play tonight against the OKC Thunder? Los Angeles Lakers injury report for tonight’s game (April 8, 2025)

Lakers’ performance so far in this season

Theface potential setbacks as Luka Doncic , and Austin Reaves were all listed as questionable for Tuesday’s game against the Oklahoma City Thunder. The trio’s status raises concerns as the Lakers prepare for a critical back-to-back, including a high-profile matchup against the Dallas Mavericks on Wednesday. LeBron James is listed as probable for tonight’s game. So, there is some uncertainty surrounding tonight’s game against the OKC Thunder. Luka Doncic is also listed as questionable. Austin Reaves, Dorian Finney-Smith, Gabe Vincent, and Bronny James are also dubious, in addition to James and Doncic. Maxi Kleber, who has not yet made his Los Angeles Lakers debut, and Rui Hachimura have been ruled out. It appears likely that important players will be rested against the Thunder because the game is the first of a back-to-back, followed by a crucial game against the Dallas Mavericks.With four games remaining in the regular season, the Lakers are currently 48-30 and the third seed in the Western Conference. Maintaining their lead over the Denver Nuggets (1.5 games back) and Los Angeles Clippers (2 games back) is crucial for playoff seeding, even though it seems improbable that they can catch the Houston Rockets for the No. 2 seed.LeBron James, Luka Doncic, and Austin Reaves played crucial roles in Sunday’s win over the Thunder, combining for 69 points. Doncic led the charge with 30 points, seven rebounds, and six assists, while LeBron James contributed 19 points and seven assists. Reaves added 20 points, including four three-pointers. Despite their strong performances, the Los Angeles Lakers may opt to rest one or more of them to prioritize Wednesday’s game in Dallas.The Mavericks matchup holds extra significance for Doncic, marking his first return to Dallas since joining the Lakers. Emotions are expected to run high, especially with former Laker Anthony Davis now anchoring the Mavericks’ lineup. Teammates have acknowledged the importance of the game for Doncic, hinting at a possible strategic rest against the Thunder.The Los Angeles Lakers will go to Dallas to play Doncic's old squad following the Thunder matchup. Since this will be Doncic's first time playing for his old team in front of Dallas supporters, the game will be worth seeing.Also read: Will Luka Doncic play tonight against the OKC Thunder?

FULL Alex Ovechkin Celebration Ceremony After Record-Breaking Goal No. 895

A legacy passed down: Anastasia Shubskaya receives diamond tribute from Janet Gretzky



After Alex Ovechkin netted his 895th career goal and broke legendary Wayne Gretzky 's record, Janet Gretzky showed respect to a time-honored hockey tradition by gifting Anastasia Shubskaya , wife of Alex Ovechkin, an eight-carat diamond ring that had been estimated at $280,000. The Capitals may have lost to the New York Islanders by a score of 4-1, but the outcome was an afterthought to a night all about legacy, love, and a new chapter in hockey's history.The moment of history arrived at 7:26 of the second period. Alex Ovechkin let go of a blazing shot through fellow Russian Ilya Sorokin, making himself the NHL's all-time leading goal scorer. Fans inside UBS Arena lost their minds, and Alex Ovechkin commemorated the occasion by executing a belly flop onto the ice—celebrating his big achievement.While Alex Ovechkin was absorbing the enormity of his achievement, Anastasia Shubskaya was gifted a symbolic token of the historic night. Continuing a tradition started in 1994, when Colleen Howe (wife of Gordie Howe) gave Janet Gretzky a diamond ring after her husband, Wayne Gretzky, broke Colleen Howe’s husband’s record, Janet Gretzky ensured history repeated itself—this time from one hockey family to another.In an interview with the media, Wayne Gretzky said, “A month ago, my wife said, ‘You know, Colleen Howe started a tradition. I’m not sure if anyone is going to break Alex’s record, but I want to give her (Ovechkin’s wife, Anastasia Shubskaya) something really unique.’ So, we went out and she picked out an eight-diamond ring for Alex’s wife. Not only do hockey guys pass down traditions. So do the families and wives.”The act not only spanned generations of greatness but also underlined the strong relationship between hockey families across generations.Also read: “Now the real stuff is coming”: Alex Ovechkin skips The Tonight Show appearance to stay playoff-ready Even though the Capitals fell on the evening, the larger context is one of hope.

Poll Do you believe Rathi's previous celebrations were too provocative? No, they were fine Yes, definitely

NEW DELHI: Lucknow Super Giants ' rising spinner Digvesh Rathi made headlines once again, not just for his bowling but for his unique way of celebrating after dismissing none other than his cricketing idol, Sunil Narine During a high-octane clash against Kolkata Knight Riders at Eden Gardens, Rathi picked up the prized wicket of Narine and followed it up with a brand-new celebration.Also See: IPL Live Score, CSK vs PBKS In the 7th over of KKR's innings, Rathi bowled a deceptive googly that lured Narine into a mistimed big shot.Narine couldn’t get the power he needed, and Aiden Markram ran in from long-off to complete a clean sliding catch.What followed was a moment of maturity and restraint from Rathi, who has come under fire for his earlier, more provocative ‘notebook’ celebration.This time, instead of mimicking writing, Rathi bent down and theatrically signed the grass, perhaps symbolising a respectful autograph or signature moment rather than a taunt.Watch:The wicket was extra special for Rathi, who has publicly admired Narine and even styled parts of his bowling around the West Indian all-rounder.Fans and cricket experts watching the game picked up on the emotional significance, with social media quickly buzzing about the symbolism of a young bowler dismissing his hero.While Rathi’s celebratory antics have previously landed him in hot water -- including fines totaling over Rs 5.6 lakh and multiple demerit points, the gesture this time seemed playful but far less confrontational.With a number of crucial wickets already in IPL 2025 and becoming a reliable option for Rishabh Pant in crunch situations, Rathi is fast becoming one of the most exciting young spinners in the league.","Digvesh rathi shows off new celebration after dismissing sunil narine.

Warrior Princess’ Diana Belbiță ends her 10-Year MMA journey

Diana Belbiță never planned on getting this far. That’s what makes her journey so easy to root for. She didn’t grow up dreaming about the UFC or imagining walkouts under the bright lights. But somehow, she made it—fought in Europe’s toughest promotions, stepped into the Octagon eight times, and left it all in there every single night. And now, at 28, she’s calling it a career. No big sendoff, no spotlight. Just a quiet, honest post on social media, reflecting on a ride she never expected. Diana Belbiță ’s pro career started in 2014, mostly under the radar in Romania. She wasn’t hyped as a phenom. She wasn’t fast-tracked. But she fought often, stayed consistent, and eventually caught the attention of KSW—one of Europe’s most respected MMA promotions. That’s where she had her first real breakthrough, even fighting for a title before heading to the UFC.Her run in the UFC wasn’t perfect. It wasn’t supposed to be. She went 2-6 over six years, picking up wins against Hannah Goldy in 2021 and Maria Oliveira in 2023. She lost some tough ones, including her last three, with her final appearance ending in a submission loss to Dione Barbosa this past weekend.A few days later, she posted a simple message on X.“It was fun fighting at the highest level,” she wrote. “I never even dared to dream that I will get there, but I ended up spending my last 6 years fighting for the best promotion in the world. It was a fun journey and I loved it. Now it’s time for me to start a new chapter.”That last part hits hardest. Not everyone who makes it to the UFC feels like they belong. For Belbiță, just being there meant everything. She wasn’t chasing belts—she was chasing something bigger than that. She was proving to herself that she could stand among the best.Her second-to-last fight came against Molly McCann, another gritty veteran who recently retired herself. There’s something fitting about that—two fighters who gave it their all, even when the wins didn’t come easy, stepping away on their own terms.Also Read: Michal Oleksiejczuk Teams Up with The Fighting Nerds Ahead of UFC 314 Fight vs. Sedriques Dumas Diana Belbiță won’t go down as a UFC legend.

NEW DELHI: Kolkata Knight Riders captain Ajinkya Rahane expressed dissatisfaction with the pitch at Eden Gardens, noting its lack of assistance for spinners following the team's home defeat.Rahane, while cautious in his remarks, hinted at the potential controversy surrounding discussions of 'home advantage.'The match against Lucknow Super Giants , which ended in a narrow four-run defeat for KKR, marked their second loss in three home games this season.Rahane highlighted the ineffective spin bowling conditions, contrasting with expectations for the match.""Firstly, there was no help for the spinners, let me clear that,"" Rahane said in the post-match press conference. ""They used the boundary really well, you know, bowling to the longer end, I mean longer boundary, they did that really well, our bowlers tried as well, but again, (Nicholas) Pooran and Mitchell Marsh batted really well in between, they took their chances which came off really well for them.""""It was a lovely wicket, we all saw that, scoring almost 500 runs on this track, hard for the bowlers, but again, they used the conditions and used the boundary really well.""The game saw a high-scoring affair with LSG setting a formidable total of 238/3, and KKR falling short at 234/7.Rahane's strategy to bowl first did not yield the desired outcome as the opposition batters, notably Nicholas Pooran and Mitchell Marsh, capitalized on the conditions effectively.KKR's spin duo, Sunil Narine and Varun Chakravarthy, struggled, failing to secure any wickets and conceding runs at a rate of over nine per over.This performance led to questions about the relevance of 'home advantage' in the IPL , a topic Rahane approached with caution to avoid controversy.""See, there's been enough talk about the wicket. Aap logon ne bahut usko yeh kar diya hai. Toh agar main abhi kuch bolunga na, toh bawal ho jayega. (You people have already hyped it up a lot.

The Western Conference playoff race remains wide open as thefight to secure their spot. With every game carrying postseason implications, the Grizzlies face the Charlotte Hornets tonight in what should be a must-win matchup. The biggest question looming over the game: Willsuit up after missing the previous contest?Memphis received a scare when their star point guard Ja Morant was ruled out last minute against the Pistons due to food poisoning. However, interim head coach Tuomas Iisalo provided positive updates ahead of tonight’s game.Key takeaways from the injury report:- Ja Morant (food poisoning) – Expected to return- Zyon Pullin (knee injury) – Out- Brandon Clarke (knee) – Out for the seasonMorant’s return is crucial for Memphis, as he leads the team with averages of 22.9 points, 4.2 rebounds, and 7.3 assists per game. His absence was felt, but the Memphis Grizzlies managed back-to-back wins against Miami and Detroit without him.With Morant back in action, Memphis is expected to field a strong starting five.
