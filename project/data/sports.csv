How and why Rishabh Pant's England tour could come to an abrupt end due to toe fracture

Poll How impressed are you by Rishabh Pant's performance despite his injury? Extremely impressed Somewhat impressed Not very impressed

Around 11 am local time, Rishabh Pant arrived at Old Trafford cricket ground with his injured right foot protected and secured inside a moonboot. He used a crutch for support and slowly made his way to the away dressing room. In lightning quick time, the wicketkeeper-batter changed to the Indian whites and was captured in the balcony behind head coach Gautam Gambhir He had not accompanied the rest of the team in the bus to the ground and it was later revealed by Shardul Thakur that an early hospital visit forced him to arrive nearly two hours later. The visuals of Day 1 were still fresh in everyone's mind and it was difficult to even entertain the outrageous thought of Pant coming out to bat in that condition. The swelling, the bleeding and the inability to put the injured foot down made it impossible to imagine the 27-year-old walking down the staircase from the dressing room to the ground.All heads panned towards the steps when Shardul Thakur was dismissed and the capacity crowd was up on its feet when they saw Pant hobble out to the middle. The scoreboard, the situation of the match and cricket took a backseat because what was unfolding in front of everyone was an exhibition of grit, courage and the desire to contribute for the team.There was a sense of shock in the opposite camp too because they didn't expect Pant to play any part in the Test and him walking out did catch them a bit off guard.He stretched his overnight score of 37 to 54, hit a six off Jofra Archer, limped for singles and gave another example of why impossible is ‚ÄòI'm possible‚Äô in Pant's dictionary. If batting with a painful finger at Lord's wasn't enough, the left-hander took it to a different level by batting with a fractured toe. An injury which required him to rest for at least six weeks but all that took a backseat as Pant wanted to score those crucial runs lower down the order.Multiple trips to the hospital and the hours put in by the medical team kept the plan of keeping him ready to bat in place, and there was a lot of excitement in the dressing room. They were aware of the seriousness of the injury but knew the grit would take over.""Everyone was very excited to see how he would approach his innings. And I think what he showed today, the passion he showed for the team is unmatched. We have seen a lot of instances in the past where he has batted in fractures. I think there was a time when Graeme Smith was batting in the South African team. His hand was fractured.""So, in these moments, the grit of the player comes into play. And I think Rishabh's positivity and his grit keeps him away from all the pains and whatever pain he has. His pain bearing capacity is very high. If he is in pain, it is a big injury,"" said Shardul Thakur in the post-day presser.With Pant, it has been the case of grit over matter and will not be a surprise if it remains that way in the second innings too. There is no official word on his participation in the last Test but it is very unlikely.Manchester, however, could see another glimpse of the freak who dances to his own tunes. If the situation demands and the team needs, the crutches will be ditched, the moonboot will come off and he will descend those steps again to give his all for the team. Possibly one last time in the series.",Rishabh pant limped out to bat on day two of the second test against england. The wicketkeeper-batter had a fractured toe which required him to rest for six weeks. The 27-year-old scored 54 not out and hit a six off jofra archer.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122894641,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-90074,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Pittsburgh Penguins require upside, and Lukas Reichel fits the profile

Chicago Blackhawks Looking To Trade Lukas Reichel? | Potential Offseason Trade Packages

Rationale behind making the trade



FAQs

Q1: Has Reichel been officially placed on the block?

Q2: What would Reichel do on the Penguins?

Q3: Could a change in scenery be a catalyst for Reichel to start playing better?

As the Pittsburgh Penguins retool their core, in addition to possible trades with regard to some veteran assets like Erik Karlsson and Bryan Rust, they should also evaluate fresh prospects for their future. One fella that stands out is Chicago Blackhawks forward Lukas Reichel. At 23 years old, Reichel hasn't found his stride with Chicago, but given his raw talent and his first-round pedigree, he might shine in a steadier setting such as the one in Pittsburgh.The Pittsburgh Penguins are at a crossroads, one that asks whether they decide to fully rebuild or simply retool around their aging stars. For whichever path they pursue, however, Lukas Reichel certainly represents a low-risk, high-reward proposition. Last season, for instance, he only had 22 points in 70 games, but you can't just cast away the flashes of offensive brilliance he has shown in the past. He scored 15 points in just 23 games in the 2022‚Äì23 season, which means he still obviously has untapped scoring potential that Pittsburgh can help to unlock.The kid was once considered the great hope for the Chicago pipeline. However, due to an inconsistent deployment and the general struggles of the Blackhawks attempting to rebuild, Reichel has been unable to solidify himself in a top-six role.Pittsburgh offers a somewhat more veteran-led environment and structured system, and this might be just the trigger he needs in his development.The Penguins cannot simply look to shed contracts; they need to build a bridge to the future. Lukas Reichel fits into that; he is under a controllable contract and is still years away from his prime. Unlike a rental player, Reichel can grow alongside the team but also contributes at the highest NHL level right away. This trade would likely not require giving up anything premium-child fare; a mid-round pick or a somewhat secondary prospect would most likely suffice, making it a very appealing risk.Something about Chicago just didn't click with Reichel, so a change of scenery might be just what he needs. From Pittsburgh's standpoint, it's about investing in someone who may be on the brink of blossoming, especially if surrounded by experienced creators like Sidney Crosby or Evgeni Malkin.Also Read: Matthew Tkachuk and Ellie O‚ÄôConnell celebrate their wedding with grandeur weeks after the Stanley Cup win For a team balancing the old and the new, Reichel represents a clever, forward-thinking acquisition. With little risk and extraordinary upside, he just might be the missing piece in this retooling.Ans: No, not officially, though several sources have stated that the Blackhawks are willing to move him.Ans: Probably middle-six forward, with a chance to move up if he ever discovers his scoring touch.Ans: Yes, many feel that a more structured environment, supported by veterans, might be what Reichel's game has needed.","Lukas reichel could be a smart long-term bet for the pittsburgh penguins amid roster revamp.

FAQs



Why was Maxim Tsyplakov eligible for arbitration so early?



How did Tsyplakov perform in his rookie NHL season?



What is the value of Tsyplakov‚Äôs new contract?



Is it common for rookies to go to arbitration?



Maxim Tsyplakov‚Äôs arbitration case with the New York Islanders was unlike most others in the National Hockey League (NHL); because he almost went to a hearing just one season into his NHL career.But on Friday, the Islanders slammed the door shut on that possibility by inking the 26-year-old winger to a two-year, $4.5 million contract. The deal arrives four days ahead of his scheduled hearing and makes Tsyplakov the second player this week to settle early, after Seattle Kraken‚Äôs Kaapo Kakko struck his own deal.Most players don‚Äôt hit arbitration eligibility right after their rookie campaign. Tsyplakov, however, did; thanks to a little-known rule in the NHL‚Äôs collective bargaining agreement. Because he signed his first NHL contract at 25 years old in 2024, all it took was 10 games of professional experience last season to qualify.Tsyplakov joined the Islanders in May 2024 after tearing up the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL) with 31 goals and 47 points in 65 games for Spartak Moscow. In his first NHL season, he posted 10 goals and 35 points across 77 games; solid, if unspectacular, numbers for a rookie learning North American ice.New York clearly believes Tsyplakov‚Äôs numbers will grow. The cap hit of $2.25 million annually is affordable, but also a clear sign they expect more than just middle-six production moving forward.He signed his first NHL contract at 25, which allowed him to qualify after just 10 professional games under the league‚Äôs CBA rules.He scored 10 goals and 35 points in 77 games for the New York Islanders during the 2024‚Äì25 season.The deal is worth $4.5 million over two years, with a $2.25 million average annual value.Not at all. Tsyplakov‚Äôs case is considered rare due to his age and contract status when entering the league.This was more than a simple contract; it was a message that the Islanders see Tsyplakov as part of their future core.

Why Aaron Rodgers‚Äô new helmet still falls in the NFL‚Äôs yellow safety category

Aaron Rodgers criticizes new helmet after two decades with Schutt

Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Aaron Rodgers has arrived at the training camp field donning a new piece of gear: the Schutt Air XP Pro VTD II helmet, equipped with a custom F7 pro facemask. This marks a significant transition for the All-Pro player, who had to abandon his former helmet after the NFL banned it prior to the 2025 season. The information was first revealed through a post from @_MLFootball on X, which announced, ""NEWS: #Steelers All-Pro quarterback Aaron Rodgers is using a new helmet this season."",Aaron Rodgers has switched to a new helmet, the Schutt Air XP Pro VTD II, which combines a sense of familiarity with compliance to NFL regulations. It features a custom F7 pro facemask, crafted to mirror elements of his previous gear while still meeting the league's safety standards. NFL insider Mike Garafolo pointed out this change on X, explaining that Rodgers opted for this helmet after trying out several others, as it‚Äôs ""closer in design to his old one. "" Although it‚Äôs not listed among the NFL‚Äôs top-recommended helmets, it is categorized as ""yellow,"" meaning it‚Äôs ""not recommended but allowed""; this legal option lets Rodgers keep some comfort while playing.The switch wasn‚Äôt a personal decision. Rodgers‚Äô old helmet, the Schutt Air XP Q11, was one of seven models that the NFL banned this offseason. Each year, the league, in collaboration with the NFL Players Association, carries out a helmet performance and safety study to assess equipment based on lab tests and concussion statistics.Helmets that don‚Äôt meet the new safety standards are gradually removed, going from 'not recommended' to 'prohibited.' The Schutt Air XP Q11, which was allowed in the past despite mediocre ratings, didn‚Äôt pass the safety tests this year.Aaron Rodgers has made it clear that he's not happy. At a press conference during the Steelers' minicamp, he expressed his frustrations to the reporters, stating, ""I can‚Äôt stand the [new] helmet. I‚Äôve worn a Schutt for 20 years and somehow it finally didn‚Äôt pass the safety standards"".His journey to the Schutt Air XP Pro VTD II wasn‚Äôt straightforward, he first tested the Schutt F7 Pro, a highly rated model, but found it lacking. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt stand the helmet,‚Äù he talked again about the F7 Pro before transitioning to the Air XP Pro VTD II during training camp. While it's not the best option, it gives him a vibe similar to his old Q11, blending familiarity with adaptability.Also Read: Justin Jefferson sends bold message to J.J.

Daniel Cormier reveals that Brock Lesnar is banned from TKO



DANIEL CORMIER SOUNDS OFF on JON JONES, ASPINALL, MMA GURU?! | EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW

Will Brock Lesnar return to WWE?



FAQs

Is Brock Lesnar banned from WWE and professional wrestling?



Why was Brock Lesnar‚Äôs name linked to the Vince McMahon lawsuit?



When did Brock Lesnar last appear on WWE programming?



Brock Lesnar, once the most dominant force in both WWE and UFC, now finds himself in an unthinkable position. He has been sidelined, silent, and reportedly banned from professional wrestling altogether. As per reports, WWE is distancing itself from Lesnar. Additionally, insiders are dropping cryptic but serious comments, which have extended the speculation. Now the question remains, is this the end of The Beast Incarnate‚Äôs career?Daniel Cormier has recently shared up update on Brock Lesnar that put the wrestling world in a frenzy. On The MightyCast with Demetrious Johnson, the former UFC Heavyweight Champion revealed that Brock Lesnar is currently blacklisted from professional wrestling. Though Cormier declined to elaborate, his tone left little room for doubt.‚ÄúBrock is on the banned list right now,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBrock got into so much trouble. You know what Brock did. I ain‚Äôt telling you on air what Brock did. Brock is in so much trouble.‚ÄùThe remarks come amid the fallout from the high-profile lawsuit filed by former WWE employee Janel Grant, who accused Vince McMahon and others of se*ual misconduct and trafficking.Though Lesnar‚Äôs name was initially listed in the documents and later removed, his association with the case has had lasting consequences on his career.In fact, Lesnar hasn't appeared on WWE programming since his loss to Cody Rhodes at SummerSlam 2023. He has been scrubbed from WWE marketing material, future events, and even casual mention by the promotion itself. A source close to the company told multiple outlets that Lesnar is being treated as ""radioactive"" amid ongoing legal uncertainty. It would be a miracle if he can make a return after all this trouble, although never say never.While Lesnar has avoided the spotlight, he was recently spotted in public, looking fitter than ever. Fans shared photos of the 46-year-old taking selfies outside a restaurant, his shredded physique sparking whispers of a potential comeback. When asked about returning to WWE, he reportedly offered a vague reply: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll see.‚ÄùStill, without a clear path forward and no statement from either WWE or TKO, Lesnar‚Äôs future remains up in the air. Though Cormier‚Äôs knowledge of WWE‚Äôs internal decisions can be debated, the weight of his comments can‚Äôt be dismissed lightly, especially when paired with the company‚Äôs decision to effectively erase Lesnar from its present and near-future plans.For now, Lesnar‚Äôs focus seems to be on family. While The Beast may be lying low, fans and critics alike are left wondering, has the final bell already tolled for Brock Lesnar? So far, it‚Äôs hard to tell. Still, many fans would want to see The Beast making his WWE return with a surprise, especially as a worthy opponent of John Cena in his retirement tour. But as for the current situation, at least, according to Cormier, it is far-fetched.Also Read: Roman Reigns Confronts Paul Heyman on Raw to Sow Seeds for a Huge Clash at SummerSlam According to Daniel Cormier, Lesnar is on the ""banned list,"" though WWE hasn‚Äôt officially confirmed it.Lesnar was initially named in the lawsuit filed by Janel Grant, who alleged trafficking and misconduct, but his name was later removed.Lesnar hasn‚Äôt been seen on WWE TV since his match against Cody Rhodes at SummerSlam 2023.","Daniel cormier reveals that brock lesnar is banned from tko.

Hulk Hogan was a giant in his prime years

Hulk Hogan's multiple injuries affected him physically

Terry Bollea, known to the whole wide world as Hulk Hogan , was one of the biggest stars the world of wrestling ever saw, sometimes quite literally. At his prime, standing at a massive height of 6 ft 7 in, which is roughly around 201 cm tall, he was one of the tallest stars in the in-ring game who was a regular participant for decades. While he retired in 2012 from being an active wrestler, Hogan was still a part of the WWE until his last day. Unfortunately, the veteran star passed away in the morning of July 24, bidding goodbye to the world of wrestling forever. Hulk Hogan was one of the tallest stars who played an active part in the world of wrestling. While not the tallest ever, that spot definitely belongs to Giant Gonzalez, who stood at a monstrous height of 8 ft, he was still up there. At 6 ft 7 in, Hogan was one of the tallest stars with a long-standing career, despite his hulking physique. In his prime, he even hulked over Lou Ferrigno , star of the 1970s television series, The Incredible Hulk.Allegedly, when Hulk was working the wrestling circuit in Memphis, he appeared on a local talk show alongside Ferrigno, who was 6 ft 5 in or 196 cm tall. Side by side, Hulk Hogan easily dwarfed the man who was supposed to be playing the biggest Avenger at the time. Weighing 295 pounds (134 kg) with 24-inch (61 cm) biceps, his physique was a true marvel that had fans all over the world cheering for him. With such an expansive career, he was regarded as the most recognized wrestler in the world.Several injuries and surgeries led to Hulk Hogan losing a few inches later in life. Being one of the biggest stars in wrestling meant working a lot over the years, which unfortunately, led to many health issues for the Hulkster. He had over 25 surgeries in his lifetime, and even lost a couple of inches because of problems in his spine.Hogan has had over a dozen back surgeries, neck surgeries, and knee surgeries. Also, rumor has it that 3 or so of his vertebrae shrank because of multiple injuries, which led to his losing a few inches of height. And of course, with age too, he was bound to lose some. At the end of the line, it was assumed that he was around 6 ft 4 in.Also Read: Hulk Hogan's car collection was just like him - muscly and loud - adding to his impressive net worth","Terry bollea, known to the whole wide world as hulk hogan, was one of the biggest stars the world of wrestling ever saw, sometimes quite literally.

How many rushing yards did Bijan Robinson have in the 2024 season?

Bijan Robinson, the running back for the Atlanta Falcons, is creating quite a stir. After an outstanding 2024 season in which he totaled 1,887 yards from scrimmage, Robinson has made it onto the renowned NFL Top 100 Players list at No. 62. Yet, the most striking comment came from Philadelphia Eagles superstar Saquon Barkley, who didn‚Äôt just compliment Robinson he also sent out a ‚Äúscary‚Äù warning to the league about the young player‚Äôs capabilities.Every year, the NFL unveils its Top 100 Players list, chosen by the players themselves, just ahead of the season kickoff. This time around, Robinson made his first entry on the list, highlighting his increasing influence. When the NFL Top 100 countdown was revealed, Saquon Barkley, who just had a remarkable 2024 season, stepped into the limelight to cheer on Robinson.‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nobody who‚Äôs able to cut like Bijan in the NFL. There‚Äôs not,‚Äù Barkley declared, speaking directly on the NFL‚Äôs official broadcast. ‚ÄúYou can go argue with your mom about that to be honest. ‚Ä¶ Trust me, I love myself and I think I have great cuts. His vision, his agility, and he can catch the ball too.It‚Äôs finna get scary for a lot of people.‚ÄùThat's a big shout-out from a dude who really gets how to run the ball. Barkley, the 2024 Offensive Player of the Year, has made history as just the ninth player in the NFL to rush for over 2,000 yards in one season.Bijan Robinson's 2024 season was absolutely thrilling. In his second year with the Falcons, the 23-year-old rushed for 1,456 yards and scored 14 touchdowns on 304 attempts, ranking third in the NFL for rushing yards, just behind Barkley and Derrick Henry.But that‚Äôs not all. Robinson also caught 61 passes for 431 yards, bringing his total scrimmage yards to an impressive 1,887‚Äîmaking it the fourth-best in the league.He really showed off his skills, whether it was shaking off defenders on the ground or grabbing passes from the backfield. Pro Football Focus noted that he forced 70 missed tackles, proving the agility and vision Barkley talked about. That performance got him a Pro Bowl nod and confirmed his place as one of the top young stars in the league.Robinson still believes there's room for improvement. His longest run this season was just 37 yards, and he only had one play that went over 30 yards all year. This is quite different from Barkley, who had seven runs of 40+ yards in 2024.With rookie Michael Penix Jr. taking over as the starting quarterback, the Falcons are expected to depend a lot on Robinson to power the offense. A strong running game can relieve some pressure from a young QB, and Robinson has proven he can handle it. In 2024, he took 66.9% of the team‚Äôs rushing attempts, a notable increase from his rookie year, even with Tyler Allgeier in the backfield.Also Read: Aaron Rodgers debuts Schutt Air XP Pro VTD II helmet after NFL bans his old gear The offensive line is super important.

Shaquille O'Neal sparks controversy over less paying WNBA salaries,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/shaquille-oneal-sparks-controversy-over-less-paying-wnba-salaries/articleshow/122904697.cms,"Via Getty Images: Shaquille O‚ÄôNeal

Shaquille O'Neal wants to bridge the gap between the NBA and WNBA players' salaries

Why The WNBA Isn't Profitable Despite Record-Breaking Year

‚ÄúPay them what they‚Äôre worth,‚ÄúI‚Äôve played at the highest level. I know talent when I see it.‚Äù

The backlash and bigger implications of Shaquille O'Neal's thoughts

Shaquille O'Neal has ignited a fiery discussion on the stark pay disparity between NBA and WNBA players, calling the gap not just unfair but outright unacceptable. Shocked by the salaries of WNBA stars, Shaq proposed a controversial solution: slightly lowering the rim in the WNBA to boost dunks, highlight plays, and fan engagement. His goal is to make the game more marketable, drive revenue, and justify higher player salaries.During a recent interview with Bailey Jackson, Shaq‚Äôs idea draws parallels to sports like golf, where adjustments like closer tee-offs exist to enhance play without diminishing skill. He argues that tweaking the WNBA‚Äôs product could draw more viewers, boost profits, and fund salaries that reflect players‚Äô worth. Whether you agree or not, Shaq‚Äôs outspoken stance has thrust the WNBA‚Äôs pay issue into the spotlight, demanding a broader conversation about equity in professional sports is what all he meant. He points to stark numbers: A‚Äôja Wilson earns roughly $200,000 annually, Caitlin Clark around $80,000, while Stephen Curry rakes in $55 million a season , more in one game than Wilson earns in two years. Clark and Angel Reese combined wouldn‚Äôt approach Curry‚Äôs payday over multiple seasons. He‚Äôs not alone in noting the pay gap; the numbers speak volumes, with top WNBA salaries dwarfed by NBA earnings.Social media erupted, with supporters praising his intent and critics arguing it undermines female athletes‚Äô prowess. Shaq, however, insists it‚Äôs about amplifying the game‚Äôs appeal, not questioning talent. Not everyone embraces Shaq‚Äôs rim-lowering proposal. Some WNBA players and fans argue it implies women need assistance to match the NBA‚Äôs excitement, potentially devaluing their athleticism. Critics see it as a misguided fix that shifts focus from systemic issues like unequal media coverage and sponsorship deals to altering the game itself.Shaq counters that his suggestion isn‚Äôt about diminishing talent but about creating a product that draws more eyes and revenue, ultimately benefiting players. Shaq‚Äôs call-out isn‚Äôt aimed at the athletes but at a system that fails to reward them commensurately. His idea, while divisive, underscores a shared goal: elevating WNBA stars like Wilson, Clark, and Reese to household names with paychecks to match. Love or hate the rim idea, Shaq‚Äôs advocacy amplifies a critical issue.The debate he‚Äôs sparked isn‚Äôt just about rims it‚Äôs about fairness, visibility, and the future of women‚Äôs sports, with a larger-than-life ally pushing for change.Also read:","Shaquille o'neal has ignited a fiery discussion on the stark pay disparity between nba and wnba players.

Q: Why don‚Äôt the Browns have a logo on their helmets?

The Cleveland Browns are once again turning heads with their choice of helmet. On Wednesday, the team unveiled an all-new alternate helmet design that will debut during the 2025 NFL season. Dubbed the ‚ÄòAlpha Dawg,‚Äô this fresh look features a matte brown finish with orange striping ‚Äì a dramatic change from the team‚Äôs traditional bright orange shells. It's the first time the Browns have ever introduced brown helmets in their history, adding a new chapter to a franchise known for its otherwise minimalist style.For a team that prides itself on tradition ‚Äì and whose primary helmet has gone largely untouched for decades ‚Äì the introduction of the ‚ÄòAlpha Dawg‚Äô is a surprising but possibly intentional move. According to the Browns, this helmet is more than just a visual refresh. It's designed to reflect the toughness and leadership the team hopes to embody on the field. ‚Äú‚ÄòAlpha Dawg‚Äô embodies what we set out to be as the Cleveland Browns, the leaders of the pack.

This will mark a stark contrast from the club‚Äôs usual aesthetic, which has centered around the orange helmets since 1952.While the Browns have never featured a logo on their helmets ‚Äì a point of pride for the franchise ‚Äì they have experimented more with helmet color in recent years. Over the past two seasons, the team occasionally wore white throwback helmets, a subtle nod to their roots in the All-America Football Conference and early NFL days (1950‚Äì51). Then they switched to orange in 1952 ‚Äì the style that's remained largely unchanged until now.Despite their historical significance, the white alternates didn‚Äôt bring much luck on the field. The Browns went just 2-4 in games wearing them, including the Week 2 contest in 2023 when star running back Nick Chubb suffered a rather serious knee injury.The Browns partnered with DUDE Wipes to promote the helmet launch, a branding choice that quickly caught the attention of fans across the internet.
