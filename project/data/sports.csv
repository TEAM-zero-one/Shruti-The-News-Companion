Bangladesh seek T20 WC match shift from India after Mustafizur Rahman's IPL exit

A senior Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) official’s comment calling former captain Tamim Iqbal ""an Indian agent"" has drawn criticism from players in the country. Tamim, one of Bangladesh’s leading openers, had advised the BCB not to be driven by emotion while deciding on the national team’s participation in the T20 World Cup in India.Nazmul, chairman of the BCB finance committee, made the remark in a Facebook post.""This time, the people of Bangladesh witnessed, with their own eyes, the emergence of yet another proven Indian agent,"" he wrote.The post received immediate backlash from former and current cricketers, including Taskin Ahmed, Mominul Haque, and Taijul Islam.The Cricketers’ Welfare Association of Bangladesh (CWAB) also expressed concern.""A comment made by BCB director M Nazmul Islam regarding former national captain Tamim Iqbal has come to the attention of the Cricketers' Welfare Association of Bangladesh. We are stunned, shocked, and outraged by it. Such a remark by a board official about the most successful opener in Bangladesh's history, who represented the country for 16 years, is utterly condemnable.""""Not only because it concerns a player like Tamim, but such comments about any cricketer of the country are unacceptable and insulting to the entire cricketing community,"" the players’ body said in a statement.The 36-year-old Tamim played 70 Tests, 243 ODIs, and 78 T20 Internationals for Bangladesh.""We strongly protest against this comment. When a responsible board director makes such remarks on a public platform, it also raises serious questions about the code of conduct of board officials,"" CWAB said.""We have already submitted a protest letter to the BCB president, demanding a public apology from the concerned board director and that he be brought under accountability. We hope the BCB president will take appropriate action as soon as possible,"" the statement added.Bangladesh had written to the International Cricket Council requesting their T20 World Cup games be moved out of India after the BCCI asked IPL franchise Kolkata Knight Riders to release Mustafizur Rahman ahead of the 2026 edition.""Cricket is the life of Bangladesh. A recent comment surrounding a former national captain who has made a major contribution to the game has caused many to reflect,"" said pacer Taskin.""I believe that such remarks directed at a former cricketer of the country are not helpful in the interest of Bangladesh cricket. I hope the concerned authorities will consider the matter seriously and adopt a more responsible stance in the future,"" he added.In 2007, Tamim’s half-century had helped Bangladesh eliminate India from the ODI World Cup in the Caribbean.Former Bangladesh captain Mominul said Nazmul’s remarks were unacceptable.""The comment made by BCB director M Nazmul Islam regarding former national captain Tamim Iqbal is completely unacceptable and insulting to the country's cricketing community. Such behaviour towards a cricketer is in direct conflict with the board's responsibility and ethics,"" Mominul said.""A senior cricketer was not given even the minimum respect; instead, he was deliberately humiliated in public. Such remarks show a lack of even basic decorum regarding where and how to speak while holding such a high responsibility.""I strongly condemn this comment and firmly demand a public apology from the concerned director and that he be brought under accountability. I call upon the BCB to take swift and strict action,"" he added.","Bangladesh cricket board (bcb) official m nazmul islam called former captain tamim iqbal ""an indian agent"" in a facebook post.

Shubman Gill press conference: Breaks silence on T20 World Cup snub, and more on his future

NEW DELHI: Virat Kohli ’s presence in an Indian dressing room is often felt in moments that don’t make the highlights reel, and a small episode from India’s training camp in Vadodara has once again underlined that side of his leadership. Ahead of the opening ODI against New Zealand, a video surfaced on social media showing Kohli engaging with a local net bowler during an intense practice session, a clip that has quickly gone viral.The incident took place at the Kotambi Stadium on Saturday, January 10, where India were putting in the final touches before the three-match ODI series gets underway on Sunday. After an extended net session, Kohli paused to offer words of encouragement to the net bowler, later signing a cricket ball for him.The interaction came after a demanding practice routine in which Kohli and the net bowler spent close to an hour and a half facing Indian pacers, spinners and throw-down specialists. Fresh off appearances in the Vijay Hazare Trophy, the sessions were designed to replicate match-like pressure, and Kohli appeared fully invested in every detail.During the exchange, Kohli was heard delivering a pointed yet motivational message: “Agar maar padh bhi jaati hai to koi baat nahi, par conviction se, ki main wo ball daal raha hu jo mujhe daalna hai, main wo ball nahi daal raha jo batsman mujhse dalwa raha hai (Even if you get hit, it’s fine.But you should have the conviction that you are delivering a ball that you want to, not the one the batter wants you to bowl).”Kohli arrives into the ODI series in red-hot form.After scores of 77 and 131 in the Vijay Hazare Trophy, he looked sharp against both pace and spin, even though inconsistent bounce from throw-down specialists challenged him in the nets.Now a single-format international player, Kohli skipped Delhi’s third Vijay Hazare match to join the national squad.His recent numbers underline his momentum. Kohli was named Player of the Series against South Africa after scoring 302 runs in three matches at an average of 151. He scored two centuries in the series.Against New Zealand, his ODI record remains formidable, with 1,657 runs from 33 matches at an average of 55.23.","Video shows virat kohli engaging with a local net bowler during an intense practice session.

What happened to Micah Parsons?

Micah Parsons return and impact on the Packers’ defense

Also Read:

Tonight, the Green Bay Packers will play the Chicago Bears in a high-stakes Wild Card game. The big issue leading up to the game has been whether or not Micah Parsons will be able to play. Sadly for Packers supporters, the answer is a clear noThe star linebacker will not play tonight after suffering a season-ending knee injury late in the regular season. The absence is a massive blow for Green Bay, who brought Parsons in specifically to make a difference in January football.Micah Parsons went down in Week 15 against the Denver Broncos with a non-contact knee injury while rushing the passer. An MRI later confirmed a torn ACL, immediately ruling him out for the remainder of the season, including the playoffs.Parsons underwent successful surgery on December 29 and has already begun the rehabilitation process. While the operation went as planned, the recovery timeline makes a return this postseason impossible.ACL injuries typically require a recovery period of eight to twelve months for NFL players, depending on progress and setbacks. Even in the best-case scenario, there was no realistic path for Parsons to return in time for a playoff game just weeks after surgery.As a result, the Packers will face the Bears without the defensive centerpiece who led the team in sacks and pressures during the regular season.The Green Bay Packers defense will miss Parsons a lot. He had 12.5 sacks in only 14 games this season and was always double-teamed, which gave his teammates chances. One of the main reasons Green Bay made the playoffs and had a good record was that he could interrupt plays without support from the blitz.Without him, the Packers will rely on a committee approach to generate pressure, leaning on rotational edge rushers and creative blitz packages. Defensive coordinator adjustments will be critical, especially against a division rival that knows Green Bay well.While tonight is off the table, the focus now shifts to the 2026 season. Parsons has publicly indicated that his goal is to be ready for the start of next year. If his rehab goes smoothly, a return around September is possible, though the team may choose to be cautious and ease him back early in the season.Green Bay will need to be sharp defensively against the Chicago Bears, particularly without their top pass rusher. Containing the Bears’ offense and winning key third-down situations will be tougher without Parsons’ elite edge presence.",The green bay packers will play the chicago bears in a wild card game tonight.

How Boston Celtics are Managing Without Jayson Tatum

What to Expect Against San Antonio

Thewhen they face the San Antonio Spurs. Tatum remains sidelined as he continues to recover from surgery on his right Achilles.His absence has shaped much of Boston’s season. With no clear return date, the team has adjusted its approach and leaned on depth rather than waiting for its star to come back.Jayson Tatum tore his right Achilles during last season’s playoffs and had surgery in May 2025. Recovery from this injury usually takes nine to twelve months. That timeline places a possible return around late March 2026 at the earliest, though nothing has been confirmed.As of January 9, Tatum is officially listed as out for the Spurs game. Boston has made it clear that his rehab will not be rushed, even if it means missing most of the regular season.The Boston Celtics have stayed near the top of the Eastern Conference despite missing their leading scorer. Instead of relying on one player, the Celtics have spread the workload across the roster and focused on team defense and ball movement.Boston is not fully healthy. Josh Minott is questionable with a left ankle injury, and Chris Boucher is out due to illness. Even so, the Celtics have continued to compete by rotating players and keeping their game plan simple.The San Antonio Spurs face a Boston Celtics team that lacks Jayson Tatum’s scoring and wing defense but remains organized. Boston is likely to rely on outside shooting and disciplined defense to stay in control.San Antonio’s biggest edge comes inside. Victor Wembanyama gives the Spurs a clear size advantage, especially with Tatum unavailable. How Boston handles him in the paint could decide the game.Also read: NBA Player Props: Best Over and Under Picks to Target on Saturday (January 10, 2026) This matchup is less about star names and more about execution.

Stefon Diggs and Cardi B’s nonstop drama emerges as a growing Patriots distraction ahead of the NFL playoffs despite Drake Maye’s elite MVP form,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/stefon-diggs-and-cardi-bs-nonstop-drama-emerges-as-a-growing-patriots-distraction-ahead-of-the-nfl-playoffs-despite-drake-mayes-elite-mvp-form/articleshow/126404396.cms,"Stefon Diggs, Cardi B (Getty Images)

New England Patriots face growing Stefon Diggs distraction before playoffs

Update:

The New England Patriots are winning games again, but the noise around them refuses to fade quietly. Foxborough has always known how to handle pressure. What feels new is how often football headlines now compete with celebrity drama. Inside the building, optimism runs high around a second-year quarterback who already looks like the future of the franchise. Outside it, the conversation keeps drifting toward social media clips, relationship rumors, and tabloid-style chaos that threatens to pull attention away from the field.That contrast defines this Patriots season. On one end is the wholesome image of Drake Maye’s inner circle, led by Ann Michael Maye, whose viral moments feel harmless and community driven. On the other is a constant swirl around Stefon Diggs and his superstar partner Cardi B, a storyline that never seems to cool down for long. The disconnect tests the calm culture Mike Vrabel is trying to protect.The uncomfortable truth is that the New England Patriots need Stefon Diggs, even when the attention becomes exhausting. Strip away the drama and the numbers tell a blunt story. Diggs was the engine of the passing attack, finishing with 1,013 receiving yards. No other wide receiver came close. Kayshon Boutte trailed by 462 yards, while tight end Hunter Henry ranked second overall with 768.Without Diggs’ explosiveness, Drake Maye’s ceiling drops fast.That is why patience exists where it normally would not. If Stefon Diggs carried a lower profile, the tolerance would likely be gone already. But playoff football is ruthless, and Maye needs a receiver who can flip momentum in a single snap if the Patriots want a legitimate Super Bowl push.The latest Stefon Diggs and Cardi B episode arrived at the worst possible moment, just as the postseason began. The rap icon clapped back at Diggs’ most recent accuser, extending a pattern that has followed the team all year, even after the couple welcomed their newborn son in November. It makes for viral content, not ideal preparation for chasing a Lombardi Trophy.That context made the Patriots’ timing feel deliberate when they released a mic’d up sideline exchange.""I can throw some blocks if you need,"" Diggs quips.""You need to shut the f**k up,"" Vrabel retorts.The exchange came across as playful, almost reassuring. The message was clear. Stefon Diggs is engaged. Vrabel is in control. Rookie lineman Will Campbell later praised Vrabel’s ability to connect with different personalities, reinforcing the idea of unity.Still, even the strongest coaches grow weary of constant off-field noise. As the Chargers loom in the Wild Card round, the Patriots know one thing for certain. Talent wins games, but distractions have ended more than a few championship dreams. Whether this one proves manageable will define how far New England Patriots really goes.Stefon Diggs has received an updated court date ahead of the playoffs. According to court documents, his arraignment has been postponed to February 13. The original date for his strangulation and assault charges was scheduled for January 23.Also Read: John Harbaugh's future: 3 possible landing spots for former Ravens' coach","Stefon diggs has received an updated court date ahead of the playoffs.

Corey Perry placed on non-roster status by Los Angeles Kings

On Wednesday, the Los Angeles Kings said that forward Corey Perry had been given non-roster playing status, which means he can leave the team to deal with a family issue, and the company said that Perry is going home because someone in his family is sick, but they didn't say when he would be back or give any other details.The news comes at a very important time in the NHL season, when the Kings are trying to get into the playoffs in the Western Conference, and Perry's absence is a big change for the team because he has been a key part of the Kings' lineup as a veteran player and a competitive edge, and this news quickly made its way into the latest NHL news roundup, which got a lot of attention from fans all over the league.Corey Perry signed a one-year, $3.5 million contract with the Los Angeles Kings ahead of the 2025–26 campaign after his stint with the Edmonton Oilers. The 40-year-old forward missed the opening weeks of the season due to a preseason knee injury but returned to make a strong impact. In 35 games, Perry registered nine goals and 12 assists for 21 points, placing him among the team’s top contributors alongside Anze Kopitar.Following Corey Perry’s departure, the Los Angeles Kings recalled forwards Andre Lee and Taylor Ward from their American Hockey League affiliate, the Ontario Reign, on an emergency basis.The call-ups are intended to provide immediate depth as the team prepares for upcoming NHL matchups during a tight schedule.Los Angeles currently sits in a Wild Card position in the Pacific Division, making every NHL match today crucial. While Perry’s time away is unrelated to on-ice performance or injury, his leadership will be missed in the dressing room. The Kings organization and fans alike have expressed support, with hopes that Perry will return once his personal situation allows.The organization emphasized privacy and support, asking fans to respect Perry and his family during this time.

Bryson DeChambeau won’t quit golf for YouTube thinks Michael Kim



Bryson DeChambeau looks for ways to challenge himself



There has been much discussion about Bryson DeChambeau's future, particularly since Brooks Koepka left LIV. The 5x major champion’s contract with LIV ran through 2026, but he left earlier. Notably, with DeChambeau’s contract coming to an end in 2026, many wonder what he will do next. Many anticipate he will take up content creation on a full-time basis. Michael Kim, a pro on the PGA Tour, isn't entirely persuaded.Kim commented under an X post, hinting that the LIV golfer might be a full-time YouTube golfer who only performs in major events.“Idk Bryson well, but he is a golf competitive psycho. YouTube has been great for him, but I have a very hard time believing that just YouTube will fulfill that competitiveness. They both need each other, and I would be shocked if they don’t get a deal done.”There are more than 2.56 million subscribers on Bryson DeChambeau's YouTube channel, with over 244 videos, and his videos have gained more than 500 million views. Each video receives 2 million per video. The LIV golfer's fame as a YouTube sensation has only increased over time.He enjoys a variety of challenges, such as the Break 50, Random Club Challenge, and Shot Cup Challenges, to make his content engaging and enjoyable.However, DeChambeau invites fellow golfers, YouTubers, athletes from other sports, and celebrities. Among the celebrities that have made appearances in his videos are Kevin Hart, Adam Sandler, Donald Trump, Jason Kidd, Phil Mickelson, and John Daly.This gave some fans and observers the impression that he could abandon professional golf in favor of a full-time career in entertainment. Michael Kim, however, disagrees. He feels it's improbable that DeChambeau will quit LIV and concentrate only on YouTube because of how competitive he is.DeChambeau is known for being a fiercely competitive professional golfer. He even took a unique physics-based approach to become one of the biggest drivers in golf. In 2021, the American professional declared that he would keep improving his skills in a ""relentless pursuit of excellence.” Therefore, he might not give up on competitive golf that easily. But the conclusion of the contract discussions will also have an impact.“Because I could just do YouTube golf and be totally fine as well,” is what DeChambeau said in an interview with Flushing It Golf.“I mean, look, it’s confidential. I’m not going to share too much, but the conversations are in process. We have to get to a place where both parties have a good understanding of one another. It is getting to a place that makes sense for both sides,” he claimed.Bryson DeChambeau discussed a mental quality that, in his opinion, keeps him concentrated under duress. In a Bryan Bros Golf video uploaded on December 29, 2025, the 2x US Open winner said that he tries to create a competitive atmosphere even when creating YouTube content.DeChambeau said, “That’s why I do YouTube challenges in content creation because it keeps me locked in.” That’s his way of getting comfortable in the most uncomfortable situations.A clean divorce from LIV Golf seems improbable for someone like Bryson DeChambeau, as Michael Kim's analysis highlights. While YouTube continues to grow its influence, the need for real competition may keep it tied to the Saudi-backed league.Also read: Bryson DeChambeau and Lilia Schneider combined net worth: LIV Golf earnings, endorsements, and relationship buzz","Bryson dechambeau's contract with liv golf runs out in 2026.

‘Past girlfriends’ as ‘adversaries’?

A lot of noise. Donna Kelce’s ‘past girlfriends’ line on “The Traitors” had the internet reading between every word. (Images via Getty)

Donna Kelce’s ‘past girlfriends’ line landed because it hit Travis Kelce’s public dating history

The Traitors US | Friend or Foe? The Cast Predicts Who They’ll Meet in the Castle

The timing is not subtle with ‘ The Traitors ’ premiere and Taylor Swift in the picture

Donna Kelce did not name names. She did not need to. In a promo video posted Wednesday, Jan. 7, the 73-year-old mother of Jason Kelce and Travis Kelce said she did not want to run into “Maybe some of my sons’ adversaries,” adding, “That could either be on other teams, or it could be coaches, or it could be past girlfriends.” The clip ran ahead of Peacock’s Season 4 premiere of “The Traitors” on Thursday, Jan. 8, at 9 p.m. ET, per Page Six, which also quoted the exchange.Donna Kelce framed it like a mom joke, but the phrasing did the work. She grouped “past girlfriends” with rival teams and coaches, and that is why it stuck. She also described them as “adversaries,” even if she delivered it with a wink.Multiple outlets picked up the moment, including Us Weekly, Parade, and Page Six. All of them pointed to the same core detail: she talked about “past girlfriends” as people she would rather not see inside the “Traitors” castle.The context matters. Jason Kelce has kept most of his dating life private before he married Kylie Kelce in 2018. Travis Kelce has not had that luxury. His relationships became public storylines.Before his engagement to Taylor Swift , Travis dated Kayla Nicole on and off for years before they split in 2022, per Us Weekly and Parade.He also dated Maya Benberry after his 2016 dating show “Chasing Kelce,” per Page Six. Donna Kelce did not point at any one woman. She still handed the internet a headline-ready quote.Donna Kelce has also joked about her sons’ dating lives before. On Jason and Travis’ “New Heights” podcast in May 2025, she said, “Jason, you didn’t really bring a lot of ladies home.” She followed that up with, “You dated but I didn’t know any of them,” and then added, “With Trav, I met one or two. I knew nothing of anybody you guys were dating in college. You told me zero.” Jason leaned into it with his own self-burn, saying, “I had zero game and I looked like an overweight oompa loompa,” before Donna replied, “You’ve changed, so that’s good. ”That track record is why her “Traitors” line reads less like a scandal and more like Donna Kelce staying consistent. She teases. The internet turns it into a referendum.Donna Kelce is stepping into a reality-TV format built for suspicion, alliances, and confessionals. Even a throwaway line becomes a plot hook. That is why her “past girlfriends” mention popped ahead of the Season 4 premiere on Thursday, Jan. 8.She also walked into this moment with her family already sitting under a microscope. Travis Kelce’s relationship with Swift became one of the most covered celebrity sports crossovers since they started dating in 2023. Donna Kelce has publicly supported it. In 2023, she told WSJ.com, “I can tell you this, he’s happier than I’ve seen him in a long time,” and added, “God bless him, he shot for the stars!”So when she casually lumps “past girlfriends” into the “adversaries” category, people read it through that lens. Fans treat it like a message. Even when it is not one.Donna Kelce also made clear she had her own wish list for the castle. She said she hoped to see Martha Stewart, Stevie Nicks, and Shaquille O’Neal, per Us Weekly and Page Six. She did not get that lineup. She did get a cast full of reality-TV and entertainment names, and she is now part of the story instead of just adjacent to it.Bottom line: Donna Kelce did not call out a specific ex. She did not accuse anyone of anything. She delivered one clean sentence that sounded like a mom joke, and it hit harder because Travis Kelce’s dating life has been public for years. That is the whole spark. That is why it traveled.","Donna kelce’s ‘past girlfriends’ line on ‘the traitors’ had the internet reading between every word.
