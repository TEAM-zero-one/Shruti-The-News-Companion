Poll What was the key factor in Delhi Capitals' victory over Lucknow Super Giants? Mukesh Kumar’s brilliant 4-wicket haul KL Rahul’s composed half-century

NEW DELHI: KL Rahul led from the front with a composed half-century as Delhi Capitals cruised to an emphatic eight-wicket victory over his former team, Lucknow Super Giants , on Tuesday. KL Rahul remained unbeaten on 57 off 42 deliveries, laced with three fours and three sixes, and in the process, crossed the 5,000-run milestone in the Indian Premier League. Delhi chased down the 160-run target with ease, reaching 161/2 in 17.5 overs to draw level with Gujarat Titans at the top of the table, both teams sitting on 12 points from six wins.Abishek Porel played a key role in Delhi’s chase, hammering 51 off 36 balls in a free-flowing knock. Aiden Markram, who bowled his off-spin, was the only successful bowler for Lucknow, claiming both wickets for 30 runs.After sealing the win, KL Rahul took to social media and shared a cryptic yet telling message.""Always good to be back in Lucknow,"" KL Rahul wrote.Earlier in the evening, despite a strong 87-run opening partnership between Aiden Markram (52) and Mitchell Marsh (45) off 60 balls, Lucknow failed to capitalize and were restricted to 159/6. Delhi’s fast bowler Mukesh Kumar was the standout performer with the ball, finishing with impressive figures of 4 for 33.Kumar struck at crucial intervals, beginning with a toe-crushing yorker that knocked over Marsh. He then removed Abdul Samad, who managed just 2 runs and never looked settled at the crease. Nicholas Pooran, one of LSG’s most consistent batters this season, fell to a clever slow short ball from Mitchell Starc and was dismissed for just 9.Returning for the final over, Kumar removed Ayush Badoni (36), who had threatened to boost the total at the end. Rishabh Pant , who has struggled with form throughout the season, endured another poor outing—getting out for a duck after miscuing a reverse lap and dragging the ball onto his stumps against Mukesh.Delhi's clinical all-round performance keeps their momentum going as the playoff race heats up.","Delhi capitals beat lucknow super giants by eight wickets in ipl.

Kevin Gates apparently started LeBron James' beef with a bold comment about Savannah James



Rapper Kevin Gates ’ latest remarks about LeBron James ’ wife, Savannah James , have ignited serious backlash from the NBA legend himself. The back-and-forth feud escalated, starting a new beef after James’ recent heated verbal clash with Stephen A. Smith as the ESPN analyst made comments on the Los Angeles Lakers legend’s son’s NBA tenure. Here’s what went down that sparked the online clash.It all started on April 19, when Gates posted a now-viral Instagram video in which he criticized Savannah’s demeanor toward her husband during games. “He’s one of the greatest players to ever play the game, but I wouldn’t want to trade places with him,” Gates said. His reasoning? “I don’t like the way Savannah look at LeBron. I like the way them white women look at LeBron. As soon as he walks out there, they just be like, ‘Oh oh oh.’”He didn’t stop there. The rapper went so far as to describe Savannah as “the warden of the jail”, claiming she polices LeBron’s every move. “When he go to do the handshake with the main player on his team … you act like I’m bothering you, b—h. I’m the greatest player in the world — one of ’em … and you act like the warden.” Gates said the energy LeBron brings is “so loving and giving” that it “hurt me to see that.”Unsurprisingly, fans and critics alike were quick to call out the rapper for crossing a line, accusing him of disrespecting Savannah and promoting problematic stereotypes. But it was LeBron’s response that truly set the tone with royalty.On April 20, LeBron posted two affectionate photos with Savannah on Instagram, including a caption that left no doubt about how he felt about Gates’ remarks:“Kings don’t concern themselves with the opinions of peasants,” he wrote, followed by a Black queen emoji. “Where to next Queen?!?! Let’s get it!”Still, Gates didn't back down. In a follow-up video posted the same day, the rapper doubled down on his comments. “The truth hurts, but it heals,” he said. “And 'Bron, I love you.” He then added, “Long as you being celebrated, I don't care who don't like me. Long as you being celebrated, that's all I care about.” Even as he expressed his admiration for LeBron, saying that his views were rooted in emotional honesty: “I love LeBron and I hate that for him,” he said.“I know a lot of people gonna hate what I just said,” Gates noted in the original clip. “But I’m gonna be honest, if everybody like me then I’m p---y.”Also Read: “Jokic defense impression” – Shaquille O'Neal’s wild TV moment sparks fan comparisons to Nuggets star James has been under constant scrutiny, primarily for his son Bronny James’ NBA career as many believe that he has made it into the Los Angeles Lakers’ main roster for his father’s influence. James' prolonged feud with Stephen A. Smith was a headline grabber in the recent times and as his back-and-forth clash with the ESPN analyst seemingly ended, the new beef with the rapper puts the NBA veteran in the cycle of unending feud. As for James, he has been very protective of his family and Savannah also grabs headlines for her comments defending her family she share with the King. The couple shares three kids Bronny James, Bryce James, and Zhuri James.","Rapper kevin gates made controversial comments about lebron james' wife, savannah james.

From gridiron greatness to emotional vulnerability



When public image collides with private battles



Even the most successful athletes face challenges that stats and accolades can’t capture—and Tom Brady is no exception. Widely regarded as the greatest quarterback in NFL history , Brady's legendary career boasts an unmatched seven Super Bowl titles, yet behind the shine of championship rings lies a more vulnerable, human side he’s beginning to share with the world.For two decades, Tom Brady maintained a laser focus on football, becoming the ultimate symbol of discipline and competitive excellence. But recently, the 46-year-old has revealed glimpses of his personal struggles, particularly in the wake of his divorce from supermodel Gisele Bündchen . Brady, who is usually tight-lipped about his private life, opened up about the emotional toll of navigating heartbreak, admitting he’s dealt with moments of “willful blindness.”This phrase—suggesting a conscious decision to ignore uncomfortable truths—points to the complexities Brady faced in his marriage’s unraveling. While he didn’t name names, the context was unmistakable, especially given recent headlines surrounding Bündchen's ongoing relationship with her jiu-jitsu trainer, who is now widely rumored to be her partner and the father figure in her children’s lives.“Willful blindness” is not just a phrase—it’s a powerful acknowledgment of emotional compromise. Tom Brady’s reflection reveals the cost of chasing perfection on the field while personal issues simmer in the background. The quarterback, once seemingly invincible both in his career and family life, now speaks like someone reckoning with the pain of being left behind. For fans, it’s a rare and raw admission: the GOAT is still just a man.The emotional fallout of watching Gisele Bündchen move on publicly is undoubtedly difficult for someone so accustomed to control and success. Reports of her being seen with her new partner and children add emotional weight to Brady’s recent comments, suggesting a sense of betrayal or at least loss.Also Read: Fresh discussion on Tom Brady and Gisele’s Bündchen’s marriage reignites debate over missed red flags Tom Brady’s recent openness signals a shift—not just for him but for the culture surrounding sports icons.

How Randy Orton can break John Cena's WWE World Title record,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/wwe/top-stories/how-randy-orton-can-break-john-cenas-wwe-world-title-record/articleshow/120519422.cms,"Randy Orton’s championship legacy

John Cena might have engraved his name into WWE history with a record-breaking 17th world title at WrestleMania 41, but it seems his long-time rival isn’t ready to let him ride into retirement unchallenged. On RAW after WrestleMania, just as Cena was celebrating his historic win and taunting fans with talks of retirement, RKO outta nowhere silenced the new champion. Randy Orton’s return to the title picture was loud, lethal, and left a clear message - the Apex Predator has unfinished business.Randy Orton is already a 14-time WWE World Champion. With Cena now holding the record at 17, the numbers might seem distant, but they’re not unreachable - especially with Cena hinting at only 26 more appearances in his farewell tour.Orton’s path to the record could be driven by two key factors: WWE’s preference for storytelling symmetry, and Orton’s revival after a long injury layoff. His recent appearances have shown he’s still in top physical condition, and if WWE is booking a redemption arc, putting him back in the title spotlight would make for great television - especially with Cena in heel mode for the first time in over two decades.With WWE Backlash set to take place in Randy Orton’s hometown of St. Louis, the storyline writes itself. A championship match between Cena and Orton could not only deliver a nostalgic clash of titans but also possibly mark Orton’s 15th world title win - narrowing the gap to just two.Add in another potential run by the end of 2025, possibly at SummerSlam or Survivor Series - and Orton could find himself at 16, tied with Ric Flair. From there, one more world title win would put him on level terms with Cena. A WrestleMania 42 main event showdown between Cena and Orton for the record-breaking 18th title could be the climax WWE fans never knew they needed.While Cena may be in his farewell year, Orton has hinted at having more in the tank. If WWE wants to build one final generational arc, Orton is the most credible and compelling challenger to not just face Cena - but surpass him. The record isn’t sealed just yet. The Viper is watching, waiting, and could very well strike his way into the record books.","Randy orton is already a 14-time wwe world champion.

Shah Rukh Khan: The superstar who turned IPL into a blockbuster

Chennai Super Kings (CSK) captain MS Dhoni has revealed the ""most ridiculous"" rumour he had heard about himself.When MS Dhoni exploded onto the cricketing scene in the early 2000s, his incredible power-hitting and remarkable fitness fueled widespread speculation about his diet.Rumours circulated that his daily intake included a staggering five litres of milk, and this was believed to be the reason behind him hitting those massive sixes.At a promotional event in Chennai, he was asked about this year-old rumour. The former India captain replied with a smile: ""I drink five litres of milk a day.""""I used to drink maybe a litre of milk, you know, spread throughout the day. But four litres, you know, it's a bit too much for anyone,"" he added.The former India captain also laughed at the rumour about him making lassi in a washing machine.He said: ""First of all, I don't drink lassi.""The 43-year-old is currently leading CSK in the absence of regular captain Ruturaj Gaikwad, who has been ruled out due to an elbow injury.Having already lost six out of eight games, the bottom-placed CSK will find it extremely difficult to win all their remaining six games to make it to the last four stage, which looks like a long shot at the moment.Dhoni rarely gives his opinion on any issue, but he didn't mince words in dissecting his team's poor batting. CSK have consistently failed to either chase or put up big scores.""I think we were quite below par, because we all knew that dew would come in the second half, and we were in a position to exploit the middle overs,"" Dhoni said, speaking about the lack of cricketing sense among the batters.","Chennai super kings (csk) captain ms dhoni has revealed the ""most ridiculous"" rumour he had heard about himself.

Travis Kelce’s competitive nature may be keeping him out of the spotlight

Taylor Swift’s loyalty might have lead her to skip major events too

In recent weeks, fans of both Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift have noticed their conspicuous absence from high-profile events like Coachella and various award shows. While the internet buzzed with speculation, a new theory has emerged — could Kelce’s lingering guilt from the Kansas City Chiefs ’ devastating loss in Super Bowl LIX be the real reason behind their low profile?Known for his fierce competitiveness and larger-than-life personality, Travis Kelce is no stranger to pressure. But after a crushing defeat in Super Bowl LIX, where the Chiefs fell short in a heart-wrenching overtime loss, sources close to the NFL star suggest he hasn’t quite shaken off the emotional weight.Despite putting on a brave face during post-game interviews, insiders reveal that Travis Kelce has been especially withdrawn since the loss. This self-imposed hiatus from the public eye could be a result of his personal disappointment and a desire to avoid media scrutiny.As Travis Kelce grapples with the aftermath, Taylor Swift has reportedly chosen to stay by his side rather than attend solo appearances. Her absence from Coachella — a festival she’s often rumored to attend — and notable award ceremonies has only fueled speculation.Swift, currently in the midst of her Eras Tour , is known for fiercely protecting those she loves. By skipping high-profile appearances, she may be signaling solidarity with Kelce during this rough patch.Fans worried about the status of their relationship can breathe a sigh of relief.

Poll Should the BCCI intervene in this situation involving Azharuddin? Only if evidence is provided No Yes

Huge prediction! KL Rahul would play in place of Rishabh Pant in 2026 T20 World Cup

Former India captain Mohammad Azharuddin has expressed deep disappointment over the Hyderabad Cricket Association (HCA) Ombudsman’s directive to remove his name from the North Stand at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium.The former cricketer did not hold back his emotions, calling the situation “heartbreaking” and a “complete disgrace to the sport.”""It pains me deeply to say this, but I sometimes regret having played cricket. It’s heartbreaking to see individuals with little to no understanding of the game now in positions to teach and lead. It’s a complete disgrace to the sport,"" he told IANS.Azharuddin, who served as HCA president from September 2019 to September 2023, said he intends to take legal action and urged the Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) to step in.""I am determined to pursue legal action against this injustice, and I urge the BCCI to intervene and take appropriate action. This issue isn’t isolated – Sunrisers Hyderabad also had a dispute with the association over passes, highlighting a pattern of mismanagement and conflict,"" the former skipper said.He further added that the situation has become personal, especially after he was barred from contesting the HCA elections .""What’s unfolding is beyond comprehension, and it hurts me on a personal level. I was not allowed to contest the HCA elections, simply because I exposed the corruption within the system. That truth made me a target,"" he said.The decision to remove Azharuddin’s name from the stadium stand was taken by Justice (Retd) V. Eswaraiah, the HCA’s ethics officer, following a petition filed by Lords Cricket Club — a member unit of the state association.The petition alleged that Azharuddin, during his tenure as HCA president, misused his position by taking arbitrary decisions. It pointed specifically to an Apex Council meeting in December 2019, just a month after he took office, where a resolution was passed to name the North Stand after him.

NEW DELHI: Rishabh Pant ’s batting order has taken a surprising turn in IPL 2025 , marking a rare shift from his usual role as a dynamic top or middle-order batter. In Delhi Capitals ’ recent clash against Lucknow Super Giants , Pant walked in at No. 7 — a position he hadn’t batted in across his last 113 IPL innings.This was only the third time in his entire IPL career that he batted so low, with the previous two occasions occurring back in his debut season in 2016.The move, however, failed to bear fruit. Pant was bowled for a golden duck by Mukesh Kumar, capping off a disappointing outing as LSG wrapped up their innings at 159 for 6.Mukesh Kumar, who cleaned up Pant with a sharp delivery, was Delhi’s standout bowler. He returned with figures of 3 for 34 in his four overs, claiming key wickets including Mitchell Marsh and Abdul Samad to derail LSG’s momentum.Pant’s struggles with the bat have been a recurring concern this season.Across nine matches so far, the DC skipper has managed just 106 runs at a below-par average of 13.25 — a far cry from the explosive form fans have come to expect from him.",Rishabh pant was bowled for a golden duck by mukesh kumar.

Alex Ovechkin dwarfed Ivan Demidov in the playoffs

Looking to game 2: Ovechkin on strong ground with the capitals

An exhilarating Game 1 was played in the first round of the series between the Washington Capitals and Montreal Canadiens, and Alex Ovechkin demonstrated the ability to stake a claim at least for one moment in time on the ice. Ovechkin's brilliant performance, capped by an overtime goal , dashed the Montreal Canadiens ' hopes of a comeback and constituted a defining moment of the 2025 Stanley Cup Playoffs. The night was momentous for the newcomer Ivan Demidov , the latest Russian prospect, who faced his first test against the veteran Ovechkin, after previously making waves by stating his admiration for Evgeni Malkin over the likes of Ovechkin.A night when youth was not served; 39-year-old Alex Ovechkin proved to the world that he is still the undisputed captain of the Washington Capitals. It was Ovechkin's leadership that kept the team in the fight, while the Washington Capitals beat Montreal 4-3 in overtime. His final score was two goals, one assist, and a flurry of big hits. His sudden-death overtime goal became the first in his storied playoff career. Young Ivan Demidov, 22 years of age and gaining recognition for his talent, was under intense scrutiny during his first playoff game. Even though he possessed tons of potential, Demidov was able to play for just 11:57 minutes on the ice.Ovechkin sent out ripples through the hockey world reminding everyone the Great 8 is far from done. In the hours leading up to the game, Demidov made headlines when he commented that he would take Malkin over Ovechkin. Ovechkin likely took that to heart and found a few extra minutes to settle accounts with Demidov through physical play, gently reminding him of the pecking order.The reality of being in the NHL's most prestigious tournament settled in for Demidov. The chances he got to showcase his talent were very few, and throughout the game, it was the presence of Ovechkin that took center stage. What happens with Demidov in the following games depends on how head coach Martin St. Louis views him. Nonetheless, one thing is certain: any success the rookie hopes to achieve in the league will demand stepping up against giants like Ovechkin.The leadership and skill of Alex Ovechkin were put on full blast during Game 1, and in Game 2, the Capitals look to go on from strength to strength in the series. As for Ivan Demidov, this first playoff experience will only help him develop, but right now, legendary status is reserved completely for Ovechkin. Challenges are bound to come Demidov's way as the series progresses, and how he deals with them will, in some sense, define his life in the NHL.Also Read: Alex Ovechkin, the Greatest Of All Time, sets the tone, and the Washington Capitals boys follow itThis brings us to the end, Alex Ovechkin reaffirmed himself as one of the few ever to play the game. A tough outing for Ivan Demidov, but definitely a worthwhile learning experience for the young Russian star.","The washington capitals beat the montreal canadiens 4-3 in overtime in game 1.

Fans slam Edmonton Oilers goaltender Stuart Skinner for letting in the 5-6 winning goal for the Los Angeles Kings

A lot of animosity came for Edmonton Oilers goaltender Stuart Skinner because he gave away 4 goals in the first 17 shots to the Los Angeles Kings . One X user wrote, “You guys need a new goalie”, and another fan said the Edmonton Oilers would have won if Calvin Pickard was the goaltender and not Stuart Skinner - “That’d be a win if Pickard was playing.”Another fan called out two Oilers players - ice hockey defenseman Evan Bouchard and goaltender Stuart Skinner - “Skinner is a horrendous goalie, then add Bouchard and you have a recipe for disaster…Skinner should never had started the third (Bouchard should have been loading the bus), that loss is on the coaching staff.”Guess, these two players took the most heat, “Bouchard is a 5-6 on any other team in the playoffs. He can’t play against other teams top 6! Absolutely horrible! How deflating to come all the way back and Skinner let’s that in for the game winning goal!”Edmonton Oilers shared an X post on their platform with the final score of the Oilers vs Kings match on April 22. More than 500 comments are there on that post. But most of them were directed toward Edmonton Oilers goaltender Stuart Skinner and ice hockey defenseman Evan Bouchard.

I didn't have to watch them come back and see Skinner let in another pathetic, back breaking goal. He is not a difference maker.”“Gotta go Pickard”“Watching Mcdavid in his prime while have Stuart in net is a crime. Feel bad for this man”“IF PICKARD WAS IN NET TONIGHT, GUARANTEED WE WOULDVE WON!!”“Announce pickard starting game 2”“It has to be Pickard’s net the rest of the way these playoffs. Skinner just doesn’t make big saves anymore and ALWAYS lets in 1-2 bad ones.”“This should be bouchards last season as an oiler”“Came all the way back just for Skinner to f*ck us.

Steelers’ options for the 2025 NFL Draft

Could the Steelers draft a quarterback?



With the 2025 NFL Draft fast approaching, the Pittsburgh Steelers ’ quarterback situation remains one of the most pressing issues heading into the new season. While the team currently has veterans Mason Rudolph and Skylar Thompson on the roster, there’s still uncertainty surrounding the position. General manager Omar Khan has made it clear that he is exploring all options to strengthen the quarterback room, and the upcoming draft could play a significant role in shaping the team’s future.As the 2025 NFL Draft approaches, the Pittsburgh Steelers are preparing to move forward with the expectation of having Mason Rudolph and Skylar Thompson as their quarterbacks. Omar Khan said during a pre-draft press conference, “Right now, we have two on the roster” meaning Pittsburgh will need to add at least two more quarterbacks.While the team has met with veteran quarterback Aaron Rodgers , no definitive decision has been made about whether or not he’ll be joining the Steelers. Rodgers’ potential impact on Pittsburgh’s quarterback strategy remains unclear. Khan emphasized that no matter the outcome, the team will have the right number of quarterbacks when training camp opens in Latrobe.The question remains that will Pittsburgh look to the draft to address its quarterback needs? Holding the 21st overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft gives the Steelers a solid position to either trade up for a highly regarded rookie or select one later in the first round. Adding a young quarterback could help the team build for the future, but it also means the Steelers may need to shift their focus away from veteran options like Rodgers.However, head coach Mike Tomlin has made it clear that the draft will not be influenced by Rodgers’ situation. ""It does not affect the draft,"" Tomlin remarked when asked about the veteran quarterback’s potential signing. This suggests that Pittsburgh’s draft strategy will proceed as planned, regardless of Rodgers’ future.Also Read: Jalen Hurts makes it official: Marries longtime girlfriend in secret ceremony As the 2025 NFL Draft kicks off on Thursday, all eyes will be on Pittsburgh to see how they address the quarterback position.

Claude Giroux's bold take on Brady Tkachuk's critics

PLAYOFFS: Shane Pinto, Claude Giroux, Nick Cousins, and Travis Green Pregame Media vs TOR

Brady Tkachuk's lifelong feud with fans

Brady Tkachuk ’s return from injury has been anything but smooth sailing. The Ottawa Senators forward, making his playoff debut after a lengthy hiatus, faced a rude awakening when the Toronto Maple Leafs dominated them in a 6-2 blowout. A most unfortunate loss was made to seem worse with the taunting chants against Tkachuk in the Scotiabank Arena - the crowd, after all, couldn't hold back on the cruel jeers. While Tkachuk shrugged off the wisecracks, Giroux voiced different sentiments, deeming those attempts at mocking more like a reluctant compliment to his junior teammate.If anything, the argument to be had was underway while the Senators were barely keeping pace with the Leafs. The wild crowd in Toronto turned their frustration toward Tkachuck with chants of ""Brady Sucks,"" and it was somewhat of a statement. They tried their best to rattle the skilled forward. Tkachuk, however, wasn’t moved by the animosity. “I guess I expected it. Couldn’t care less. I don’t really give a [expletive], to be honest. That’s not going to affect me,” Tkachuk remarked, showing he was unfazed by the jeers.Giroux, ever the supportive veteran, took a different angle when discussing the incident. “No, I mean, in my eyes it’s a compliment for Brady.” he explained. “They don’t do that if you actually suck, so. So, I mean it’s a compliment; I’ve got booed at Pittsburgh before and to be honest, it’s the best games to play.” Giroux’s comments highlight the underlying truth: hostile crowds can often be an indicator of a player’s impact. This might make Tkachuk increasingly important in the game as it apparently makes some of the Leafs' fans very bitter toward him.Tkachuk's well-documented history with vocal fans is something that subjectively doesn't really add up to much. In the past few seasons, hecklers have invaded just about every single home game-witness also included that of a Tampa Bay Lightning game held at the Canadian Tire Centre in 2023, where Senators fans booed their team right off the ice. With all that negativity, Tkachuk is unambiguous as to where his frustration lies: ""It irks you even more when the boo-ers seem to just fuel the fire.Earlier this year, Tkachuk visibly reacted and escalated tensions before the game even commenced when Canadian fans jeered against the American national anthem. After all, Giroux believes that Tkachuk would only grow stronger in the face of such tests.As far as I know, this young star is not at first disoriented by the emotional weight of fan criticism. Whether to go faster or slower, surely, with which some of it shoulders him, that totally irrefutable point remains at odds with the validity of question now: whether Tkachuk will rise to new heights as the Senators approach their first home game of the series or if the pressure will simply sink its claws in deeper.Also Read: Connor McDavid suffered from a lower-body injury, and Leon Draisaitl suffered from an undisclosed injuryIn other words, as a whole Tkachuk has yet to prove his metal on ice, whether in the face of unruly fan behavior or not, to be worth all that faith the Senators put in him. Undoubtedly he will be robust enough to overcome it; that determination will factor into Ottawa's fortunes.","Brady tkachuk made his playoff debut after a lengthy hiatus.

GTA 6 Crypto Rumor: Could you get paid in Bitcoin in GTA 6? Here’s the real story behind the crypto rumor,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/esports/gta/could-you-get-paid-in-bitcoin-in-gta-6-heres-the-real-story-behind-the-crypto-rumor/articleshow/120391964.cms,"Source: Rockstar Games

Crypto payments in GTA 6? The rumor started with fan hype and streamers



Adin Ross Is Making GTA 6 Crypto Coin

Mods and RP servers might still make it happen even if Rockstar doesn’t

Just when we thought the GTA 6 rumor machine couldn’t go any harder, here comes the internet with another banger: cryptocurrency in Grand Theft Auto. That’s right, players are now convinced they might get rewarded in Bitcoin-style crypto while causing mayhem in Vice City. And honestly, it sounds so wild it almost fits the GTA vibe. But is it real? Is Rockstar actually building a crypto-based payout system into its most hyped game ever? Or is this just another fan fantasy spiraling out of control? Let’s break it down.The idea that you might earn cryptocurrency while playing GTA 6 has been gaining serious traction. Over the past few months, fans have speculated about Rockstar potentially adding a crypto-based currency system, or even letting players earn rewards in digital tokens.One of the more viral sparks came from Adin Ross, the controversial streamer known for his GTA RP content, who claimed he’s working on a crypto-integrated GTA 6 roleplay server . That got people thinking: if GTA RP can do it, maybe Rockstar's next big game will too?The rumor really exploded when a few fan tweets and Discord screenshots mentioned a fictional in-game currency called $RSTAR, supposedly being tested in development. That was all it took for the community to lose it.Even though $RSTAR isn’t real at least not yet it’s become a fan-favorite idea. According to speculation, it would be an in-game cryptocurrency you could earn by completing heists or trading within GTA 6’s open world. Think of it like a modern parody of Bitcoin, built right into the satirical fabric of the game.As of now, Rockstar Games has made zero official comments about crypto being part of GTA 6. In fact, their track record suggests the opposite. Back in 2022, Rockstar actually banned crypto and NFTs from all GTA Online servers, citing their policies against monetization through blockchain-based assets.Here’s where things get interesting. Even if GTA 6 doesn’t launch with any kind of official crypto system, modders and RP creators like Adin Ross could absolutely build it themselves. Custom RP servers have already added NFT characters, gambling systems, and fake crypto trading into their GTA Online worlds.So yeah, maybe you won’t be cashing out actual Bitcoin from GTA 6 but fan-run servers might still give you that experience. Just don’t expect it in the vanilla version of the game.Also read - GTA VI might melt your PC: Here’s what you’ll actually need to run Rockstar’s next-gen beast","Crypto payments in gta 6?

The Boxing Federation of India ’s (BFI) elections descended further into chaos with the resignation of returning officer (RO) RK Gauba, a former Delhi high court judge.Gauba stepped down attributing his decision to an “unhealthy and uncalled smear campaign” allegedly orchestrated by different factions within the federation, which are intent on gaining control over the sports body.Gauba was appointed RO on March 7 by former BFI president Ajay Singh. The current term of the executive committee of BFI, led by Singh, ended on Feb 2, and no new elections for office-bearers for the 2025-2029 tenure have been held. Consequently, the federation is currently being managed by a six-member interim committee.This panel was established by World Boxing , the sport’s global governing body, on April 7 and is chaired by Singh. In his resignation letter, Gauba stated, “Unhealthy and uncalled for smear campaign is being indulged in by various parties, with ill-advised sense of impunity.I find it below the dignity of my position and standing to be a part of such discourse. In this view, I do not wish to continue discharging the responsibilities of RO and, thus, hereby recuse and resign from such position forthwith.” Gauba mentioned receiving several emails from factions challenging Singh’s attempt for a third consecutive term as the BFI president",Boxing federation of india elections descended further into chaos with the resignation of returning officer (ro) rk gauba.

Pat Cummins-led Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) will take on Hardik Pandya 's Mumbai Indians in match no 41 of the Indian Premier League (IPL) at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Hyderabad on Wednesday.With only two wins in seven outings, Pat Cummins ’ side is under immense pressure to turn things around. Their campaign has been riddled with inconsistency, especially in the batting department which, despite boasting of explosive names, has flattered to deceive. The bowling unit too has lacked bite, and the combination of both has left SRH languishing in the bottom half of the table.On the other hand, the Mumbai Indians arrive in Hyderabad riding high on momentum. After a shaky start to the season, the five-time champions have bounced back emphatically with three consecutive wins, the latest being a dominant nine-wicket victory over Chennai Super Kings. Chasing 180 on a flat surface, MI romped home with more than four overs to spare — a statement win that underlined their return to form.The pitch at Hyderabad is likely to be a belter. There have been four scores of 240-plus this season in eight innings so far, so expect a lot of runs. Hyderabad as a ground has the highest strike-rate amongst batters and also the place where most sixes have been hit this season.Ryan Rickelton, Rohit Sharma, Will Jacks, Suryakumar Yadav, Tilak Varma, Hardik Pandya, Naman Dhir, Mitchell Santner, Deepak Chahar, Trent Boult, Jasprit Bumrah, Karn SharmaVignesh PuthurTravis Head, Abhishek Sharma, Ishan Kishan, Nitish Kumar Reddy, Heinrich Klaasen, Aniket Verma, Pat Cummins, Harshal Patel, Zeeshan Ansari, Mohammed Shami, Eshan Malinga, Abhinav ManoharWiaan Mulder241014It's going to be a warm evening after a hot day, where the max temperature is forecast to be 38° C in Hyderabad.The SRH vs MI match will be available on Star Sports network with livestreaming on JioHotstar.Pat Cummins (c), Ishan Kishan (wk), Atharva Taide, Abhinav Manohar, Aniket Verma, Sachin Baby, Smaran Ravichandran, Heinrich Klaasen (wk), Travis Head, Harshal Patel, Kamindu Mendis, Wiaan Mulder, Abhishek Sharma, Nitish Kumar Reddy, Mohammed Shami, Rahul Chahar, Simarjeet Singh, Zeeshan Ansari, Jaydev Unadkat, Eshan Malinga.Hardik Pandya (c), Rohit Sharma, Suryakumar Yadav, Robin Minz, Ryan Rickelton (wk), Shrijith Krishnan (wk), Bevon Jacobs, Tilak Varma, Naman Dhir, Will Jacks, Mitchell Santner, Raj Angad Bawa, Vignesh Puthur, Corbin Bosch, Trent Boult, Karn Sharma, Deepak Chahar, Ashwani Kumar, Reece Topley, VS Penmetsa, Arjun Tendulkar, Mujeeb Ur Rahman, Jasprit Bumrah.","Sunrisers hyderabad (srh) take on hardik pandya's mumbai indians in match no 41 of the indian premier league (ipl) at the rajiv gandhi international stadium in hyderabad on wednesday.

Pune: When the going is too good, you pinch yourself and then imagine hurdles along the way. IM Alina Kashlinskaya of Poland, 31, experienced that on Tuesday. And it did not end well. She was on the verge of beating overnight sole leader K Humpy in the eighth and penultimate round of the FIDE Women’s GP chess ’ fifth leg at Amanora The Fern, Hadapsar.She had never beaten the veteran Indian GM in classical chess, and that was added motivation. On the 48th move of the Ruy Lopez Anderssen variation, Kashlinskaya moved her hand to move her rook in the ‘d’ file to the ‘d5’ square — the strongest move suggested by the engine.That would have taken the evaluation to almost 4 in her favour. But then she said later that she felt there could be some fortress from the opposition and decided to play the seemingly forced line. In the process, she moved her other rook from b6 to b7. That devalued her a6 pawn and gave Humpy the escape route.The top seed didn’t need a second invitation and liquidated the position to a dead draw in rook, knight and pawns endgame after gobbling up the Pole’s ‘a’ pawn. Humpy even set up a mating trap along the way. The draw helped Humpy deny Zhu Jiner the sole leadership.Zhu had outplayed Divya Deshmukh earlier in the day. Both Humpy and Zhu are on six points with a round to go. Humpy plays Nurgyul Salimova of Bulgaria in the ninth and last round on Wednesday. Zhu will have black pieces against Polina Shuvalova of Russia.Kashlinskaya, who has managed only 2.5 points so far, tried to look at the brighter side during the media interaction. “Maybe it’s better to have all wrongs in one event than scattered over many tournaments,” she said. Zhu defeated Divya with white pieces in a Four Knights game. She played an early Kh2 and slowly drove home the advantage after Divya played a questionable queen move.","Im alina kashlinskaya of poland, 31, experienced that on tuesday.
