Acceptance of a name that would define a legacy

Panthers Win Game 5 to Take 3-2 Lead in Stanley Cup Final | NHL on TNT

Wayne Gretzky is a name synonymous with greatness in the NHL , but the origin of his famous nickname, ""The Great One,"" has a surprising twist. During a recent segment on NHL on TNT’s Face Off, Wayne Gretzky shared that his father, Walter Gretzky, was not a fan of the moniker when it first appeared during his youth hockey days.Long before Wayne Gretzky shattered NHL records, he was just a ten-year-old prodigy from Brantford, Ontario, netting an unbelievable 400 goals in a single season. A reporter from the London Free Press came to profile the young phenom. At the conclusion of the article, the journalist proposed a fitting nickname: “The Great One,” drawing inspiration from legends like “Mr. Hockey” and “The Golden Jet.”“They said, ‘We should just call him The Great One,’” Gretzky recalled. “Well, my dad tried to kill that right away — it just kept coming back.”Gretzky believed such a title placed unnecessary pressure on his young son. He didn’t want Wayne to bear the weight of premature hype. But despite his father's objections, the nickname gained traction and became permanently linked to the budding superstar.Over time, the family had no choice but to embrace the label. “Finally, I just was like, ‘Well, we’re going to have to live with it,’” Gretzky admitted.And live with it he did. By the time he retired in 1999, Wayne Gretzky had not only fulfilled but exceeded the expectations that came with such a grand title. With 894 goals, 2,857 career points, and 61 NHL records, “The Great One” wasn’t just a nickname—it became his rightful legacy.Switching gears to current NHL action, Wayne Gretzky also shared his thoughts on the Edmonton Oilers' Game 5 loss to the Florida Panthers. “Right from the get-go, Florida played a really smart, intelligent road game,” he said, noting that Edmonton looked “cautious” and “on their heels” early on.Also Read: No longer Canadian: Wayne Gretzky’s Canadian identity questioned after Donald Trump friendship sparks controversy Wayne Gretzky’s nickname, “The Great One,” once resisted by his father, ultimately came to represent not just early talent, but a lifetime of excellence, From a childhood nickname to a storied NHL career, Gretzky’s story remains one of humility, brilliance, and enduring greatness.","Wayne gretzky's iconic nickname, ""the great one,"" originated from a profile of his youth hockey dominance.

Washington Wizards aim for Dylan Harper or Jeremiah Fears with bold trade offers

Dylan Harper and Jeremiah Fears could reshape the Washington Wizards’ future

The Washington Wizards are reportedly willing to trade some ‘surprising names’ in an effort to move up to the No. 2 pick. The Washington Wizards may be planning something big.

Now, a report says they want to move up—way up. Who they’re after might surprise you.According to Grant Afseth, who shared the news on X (formerly Twitter), the Washington Wizards want to get the No. 2 overall pick.They’ve made several offers to teams in the top five. In these talks, they even offered to trade some “surprising names” from their roster. That’s what league sources told Grant Afseth.Right now, the Wizards have pick No. 6 and pick No. 18. But they want more.Why? They are targeting two of the best young guards in the draft—Dylan Harper and Jeremiah Fears.Dylan Harper is a 6'5"" guard known for his smart plays and calm game. He is from Don Bosco Prep in New Jersey and is ranked as a top prospect. Most experts think he will be picked in the top three.Jeremiah Fears is another top guard.He’s known for his quick moves and strong defense.

NEW DELHI: Former Indian cricketer Sanjay Manjrekar hailed Rishabh Pant as the country's ""greatest wicketkeeper-batter ever"" following his stunning century against England, calling him a ""breath of fresh air."" Pant continued his brilliant form in Test cricket by registering his seventh Test century, breaking multiple records during his innings in the first Test against England at Leeds.Speaking on Match Centre Live after the first session, JioStar expert Manjrekar said, ""By far, India's greatest ever Test batter-keeper. I was worried when he was in the 90s that he might end up getting his 8th 90 of his career. It is just unbelievable that he has so many 90s! But he's a breath of fresh air.""""When he got out and raised his bat, there were a lot of English supporters who stood up and applauded that innings. That's what we love about England -- these guys come to watch good cricket. They want their team to win, but when they see excellence from the opposition, you can see true appreciation for it,"" he added.On Saturday, Pant surpassed MS Dhoni to become the Indian wicketkeeper with the most Test centuries. His knock of 134 off 178 balls, laced with 12 fours and six sixes at a strike rate above 75, came in testing overseas conditions — a territory where Pant continues to shine.This was his fifth Test century in SENA (South Africa, England, New Zealand, and Australia) countries — the most by any Asian batter. Three of these have come in England, with the remaining two in Australia and South Africa.Pant also equalled Sri Lanka’s Kumar Sangakkara (seven centuries) for the most Test hundreds by a designated wicketkeeper from Asia.Earlier on Friday, Pant crossed the 3,000-run mark in Test cricket, becoming only the second Indian wicketkeeper after Dhoni to do so. He also overtook Dhoni in terms of runs scored by an Asian keeper-batter in SENA countries.In 44 Tests, Pant has scored 3,082 runs at an average of 43.40, with seven centuries and 15 fifties in 76 innings — all at a strike rate of 73.69.In the match, after England chose to bowl first, centuries from Yashasvi Jaiswal (101), captain Shubman Gill (147), and Pant (134) helped India post a total of 471.

Deion Sanders Jr. Says He “Whooped” Travis Hunter in Tennis Match



Deion Sanders Jr. Has Built a Strong Brand Around Colorado Football

A funny thing happened this weekend that fans can’t stop talking about. It wasn’t on a football field, but it still involved big names from the Colorado Buffaloes. Deion Sanders Jr. , also known as Bucky, shared a bold statement that has caught everyone’s attention. He says he beat Travis Hunter not once, but twice and he didn’t hold back while saying it.Deion Sanders Jr. shared a video on Instagram on Friday, June 14, 2025, after a light tennis tournament during a family vacation. It happened at a private tennis court, where the Sanders family and close friends gathered for enjoyment.In the video, Bucky, wearing a headband and holding a tennis racket, confidently says, “I just beat Travis in tennis twice. I whooped him twice… So bro is really a*s, bro.” The clip went viral across fan pages and X (formerly Twitter), especially among Colorado Buffaloes fans.Travis Hunter, who has a close bond with Bucky since his time at Jackson State in 2021, didn’t respond online, but fans were quick to joke about the friendly rivalry. Hunter had previously called Bucky his “big brother.” Their friendship has been strong since Hunter shocked the football world by choosing to play under Deion Sanders at Jackson State, and later followed him to Colorado.The tennis match was just for fun, but Bucky didn’t miss the chance to brag a little, leaving fans laughing and tagging Hunter for a rematch.Deion Sanders Jr. isn’t just Coach Prime’s son — he’s also behind the popular Well Off Media YouTube channel that has made Colorado Buffaloes one of the most followed college football teams in the country.Also Read: Fanatics Fest explodes with surprises as Travis Scott,Tom Braddy and Tracy McGrady show up for epic panels Since Deion Sanders became head coach in 2023, Bucky has filmed the team’s practices, locker room speeches, and daily life.

The videos are posted on YouTube and Instagram and have helped grow the team’s social media numbers by over 500%.Coach Prime himself said Bucky “changed the game completely” when it comes to building the team’s image and helping with recruiting. Bucky also wrote a song for his younger brothers, Shedeur and Shilo, which played at Travis Hunter’s wedding earlier this year, showing how close the group really is.Though the weekend tennis win was light-hearted, it gave fans a peek into the tight bond between Sanders Jr., Hunter, and the whole Colorado family.","Deion sanders jr. shared a video on instagram saying he beat travis hunter in a tennis match.

Los Angeles Lakers open to trading Austin Reaves this offseason but one name in Utah's package could seal the deal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/los-angeles-lakers-open-to-trading-austin-reaves-this-offseason-but-one-name-in-utahs-package-could-seal-the-deal/articleshow/121998121.cms,"(Image Source - Getty Images)

Utah Jazz's pitch could tempt Rob Pelinka if it includes both size and scoring help

The whispers are growing louder in Los Angeles. Austin Reaves, a breakout performer and fan favorite, may not be wearing the purple and gold for much longer. While the Lakers aren’t actively shopping him, they're listening and one team, the Utah Jazz, is emerging as a serious suitor. What makes this more than just noise is the inclusion of a specific name in Utah’s package. If Walker Kessler is involved, this deal could become very real, very fast.The Jazz are reportedly focused on Reaves, and the Lakers are closely monitoring the situation. What gives this trade potential is the blend of two very different yet equally valuable players: Walker Kessler and Collin Sexton. Kessler, a 7-foot defensive force, provides the rim protection and size that the Lakers have been missing during their playoff difficulties.At the same time, Sexton brings a scoring surge off the bench, able to fill the score sheet when LeBron James or Luka Dončić need assistance. This combination meets multiple needs for the Lakers — interior defense, athleticism, and bench scoring — and together they represent the kind of immediate impact that Rob Pelinka would need to justify parting ways with Reaves.Reaves isn’t just a dependable contributor — he’s coming off a breakout season where he averaged over 20 points, nearly 6 assists, and shot close to 38% from beyond the arc.He’s shown composure in critical moments, has good chemistry with the stars, and perhaps most importantly, is tied to a four-year deal that averages around $13.5 million per season.That’s incredible value in today’s cap-heavy league. However, with a player option on the horizon in 2026, the Lakers risk losing him for nothing if they don’t take action now. It’s that ticking clock — paired with a package like Utah’s — that makes these trade discussions so serious.Even though Reaves is a fan favorite in the locker room and has expressed his desire to stay a Laker for life, the NBA operates as a business — and Pelinka is running out of time to create a championship team around LeBron and Luka. With Desmond Bane leaving Memphis and Jayson Tatum sidelined in Boston, there's a unique opportunity to advance in the West.Also Read: Tracy McGrady breaks silence on what could’ve happened if he played alongside Shaquille O’Neal during the Kobe Bryant era The Lakers aren't going to trade Reaves just to make a deal. However, if Utah offers both Kessler and Sexton, the front office will definitely have a serious discussion — and fans should brace themselves for a move that might sting now but could yield great rewards later.","Utah jazz's pitch could tempt rob pelinka if it includes both size and scoring help.

Tennis star Kei Nishikori caught up in messy scandal after alleged years-long affair with model

Japanese tennis player Kei Nishikori has been embroiled in a controversy after Japanese media reported that he was cheating on his wife, Mai Yamauchi, with model Azuki Oguchi. The claim was proven true with his public apology to his family, fans, and sponsors. The news comes at a time when Kei Nishikori had withdrawn from Wimbledon 2025 and has shocked the tennis world, casting further doubts over his off-court woes.Kei Nishikori married Mai Yamauchi in December 2020, and they have two children together. The scandal erupted when reports claimed that the former world No. 4 and now world No. 61 had been dating Japanese model Azuki Oguchi since 2022. Their romance reportedly began in Hawaii, and they were spotted at the Tokyo residence of Oguchi on June 11, 2025.In a statement, he apologized to his family, fans, sponsors, and tennis officials for the ""dishonest behavior"" and emotional distress it inflicted. “I deeply apologize for causing discomfort to everyone who supports me—tennis fans, tennis associations, sponsors, and other related parties—and for their concern and inconvenience due to my dishonest behavior,"" his apology read. ""In addition, I deeply regret that I made my wife, children, and each ‘parent’ feel hurt.From now on, in order to fulfill my life as a responsible member of society, I will solely focus on tennis competitions and produce results. We will do our best to regain your trust.""Kei Nishikori's career has been a trailblazer for Japanese and Asian tennis. He was the first and only Japanese man to win a Grand Slam singles final of the Open Era and won an Olympic bronze medal at the 2016 Rio Olympics against Rafael Nadal. But now with this controversy, it is being marred off-court, a situation that has been rare in his previously low-profile private life.Also read: Roland Garros draw: Carlos Alcaraz starts against Kei Nishikori as Iga Swiatek gets tough draw Whether his fans and the tennis world will be ready to look to the future with him is yet to be seen, but one thing is certain: the next installment in the career of Kei Nishikori will be scrutinized more than ever.","Tennis star kei nishikori caught up in messy scandal after alleged years-long affair with model azuki oguchi.

Brittany Mahomes chooses Travis Kelce over Patrick Mahomes in Chiefs night out

Brittany Mahomes enjoyed a concert night out with Travis Kelce and friends, while her husband Patrick Mahomes and Kelce's partner Taylor Swift were not present in all shared photos. This outing showcased the strong comradery among the Chiefs' extended circle beyond football.Although the Kansas City Chiefs push through their preseason minicamp, key players like quarterback Patrick Mahomes and tight end Travis Kelce are in rigorous coaching. Yet, even amidst the work, these professional athletes found a moment to step away and enjoy a concert on a recent Thursday evening.Brittany Mahomes, Patrick's wife, offered a glimpse into their off-field life through her Instagram. She initially shared a video capturing a sweet, relaxed moment with her husband. However, what truly caught the attention was a picture featuring Brittany surrounded by friends, with Travis Kelce among them. Noticeably absent from this particular photo were Patrick Mahomes and Kelce's acclaimed partner, Taylor Swift.This casual gathering came to existence shortly after Kelce and Swift's high-profile appearance at the Stanley Cup Final, making Swift's absence from this concert all the more remarkable to fans.Brittany, embracing the chance for a different kind of social engagement, seemed to appreciate the time spent with Kelce and their mutual friends. It appeared to be a favourable time for them to relax, far from the usual pressures of their football and ‘parenting duties. ’As for Patrick and Brittany, family remains a central pillar, especially with ‘three young children at home.’ They handle the complexities of the demanding NFL schedule alongside their significant ‘parenting’ responsibilities. Still, they understand the value of withdrawing personal time to refresh and reconnect.Their night out discreetly highlights the close-knit bonds that extend beyond the football field within the Chiefs organization.

Magic Johnson praises Jeanie Buss and Mark Walter in heartfelt reaction to record-setting Lakers sale



The Los Angeles Lakers legend Magic Johnson could not hide his feelings after a bombshell report that the franchise was being sold. In a stunning move that has redefined sports business history, the Los Angeles Lakers— one of the NBA's most valuable franchises— has been sold for a record-breaking $10 billion. Jeanie Buss and her family agreed to sell their 66% majority stake to billionaire Mark Walter, CEO of TWG Global and Guggenheim Partners. The transaction, first reported by ESPN’s Shams Charania, makes it the largest sale of a professional sports franchise ever, surpassing the Boston Celtics' $6.1 billion mark earlier this year.Magic Johnson, the face of the Los Angeles Lakers' greatness and a longtime close friend of Jeanie Buss, had no hesitation in applauding her decision and the legacy she now leaves behind. Taking to X, Johnson poured out a series of personal and public reflections.“Job well done to my sister Jeanie Buss for striking an incredible deal and picking the right person to carry on the @Lakers legacy and tradition of winning - Mark Walter, my business partner and friend! Mark Walter is the best choice and will be the best caretaker of the Laker brand. The proof is in the pudding on what he’s been able to accomplish with the LA Dodgers.Mark has been nothing short of a winner notching 2 World Series and 11 NL West divisional titles in the last 12 years!” Johnson wrote.Mark Walter, already a minority stakeholder in the Lakers since 2021, also owns the Los Angeles Dodgers, the WNBA’s Sparks, and interests in Chelsea FC and a Formula 1 team. His entry into majority ownership, as confirmed to CNBC, is viewed not just as a business move but as a strategic continuation of LA's winning culture.“Laker fans should be ecstatic. A few things I can tell you about Mark – he is driven by winning, excellence, and doing everything the right way. AND he will put in the resources needed to win! I can understand why Jeanie sold the team to Mark Walter because they are just alike – they are competitive people, have big hearts, love to give back, and both prefer to be behind the scenes. This makes all the sense in the world. I am so so SO happy and excited for @Lakers fans all over the world!!” Johnson added.The sale marks the end of a 46-year legacy that began when Dr. Jerry Buss purchased the Lakers for $67.5 million in 1979. Under the Buss family's leadership, the franchise flourished, capturing 11 NBA championships and becoming a global brand. Jeanie Buss, who took over as governor in 2013 following her father’s passing, will retain her position and a minority share post-sale.“Just like I thought, when the Celtics sold for $6B, I knew the Lakers were worth $10B!” Johnson stated, referencing the Celtics’ March 2025 sale to private equity executive Bill Chisholm.Despite the mammoth valuation, the Lakers’ home—Crypto.com Arena—is not included in the deal, which makes the sheer franchise value even more staggering.“I know that my sister Jeanie would have only considered selling the Lakers organization to someone she knows and trusts would carry on the Buss legacy, started by her father Dr. Buss. Now she can comfortably pass the baton to Mark Walter, with whom she has a real friendship and can trust. She’s witnessed him build a winning team with the Dodgers and knows that Mark will do right by the Lakers team, organization, and fans! Both are extremely intelligent, visionaries, great leaders, and have positively impacted the greater Los Angeles community! I love both my sister @JeanieBuss and my business partner Mark Walter,” Johnson shared in another post.The sale, which still requires formal league approval, is expected to close within months. For Johnson, the emotion was palpable when he spoke directly to Jeanie.“I just talked to my sister Jeanie Buss to tell her congratulations, and that I’m so happy for her and family.

WV Raman backs Shubman Gill to fire in England: 'He needs the right support'

Poll Do you believe Sunil Gavaskar's change in opinion about Pant is justified? Yes, he has improved No, he was right initially

Yashasvi Jaiswal credits Shubman Gill after maiden Test ton in England: 'I love it'

NEW DELHI: Sunil Gavaskar , once scathing in his criticism of Rishabh Pant , has now offered a more thoughtful appraisal of the explosive batter’s style after the opening day of India's domination in the first Test against England.During a segment on Sony Sports, Gavaskar heaped praise on Pant. Previously branding Pant’s shot in Australia as “Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!” on ABP Sport, Gavaskar has revisited his perspective.In his fresh remarks, Gavaskar said, “It seems like that’s how he plays. When he comes in to bat, on the second or third ball, he often uses his feet and hits a boundary. It makes him feel free and then allows him to play the way he wants.""Over here, he's been measured in his approach, giving himself time out in the middle. But once he's in and the bowlers start to tire, that's when he begins to step down the pitch and really attack, hitting big shots, sixes, and boundaries.”Such quick-fire aggression is now viewed less as recklessness and more as a calculated release.Gavaskar explained how Pant allows himself an initial period of restraint, adding, “Because he gives himself that time early on, it becomes easier for him to play those aggressive strokes later.When he defends, he seems to have so much time against the pace bowlers—it almost looks like he's taking the mickey out of them, saying, 'Look, I've got all the time in the world; I don't need to play a big shot, I'm just middling the ball. ' He’s got enormous talent. I’ve seen him score hundreds in South Africa and Australia, and they've been absolutely unbelievable. There’s such a great blend of defence and attack—starting with solid defence and then shifting to attack.""Gavaskar’s earlier harsh critique sprang from frustration over Pant’s dismissal for just 28 during the tour of Australia.“Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! He should not be going into that (India’s) dressing room - he should be going into the other dressing room!” he had said.With Pant’s approach now paying dividends and India opening their five-Test series in England with an imposing 359/3 at stumps on Day 1, his captain’s deputy Shubman Gill (127*) and Yashasvi Jaiswal (101) stole the headlines, while Pant held firm at 65 not out, even unleashing two late sixes to keep the momentum flowing.",Sunil gavaskar has given a more thoughtful appraisal of rishabh pant's style. The former india captain previously branded pant's shot in australia as 'stupid! Stupid! Stupid!'

Offseason 2025: The Edmonton Oilers' next moves circling Connor McDavid

Connor McDavid: more than a player, the emotional core of the franchise

A very few athletes exist around the world of sports whose presence can uplift an entire franchise; Connor McDavid is undoubtedly one such athlete. Losing in the 2024 Stanley Cup Final was heartbreaking, but McDavid was still the shining star. Breaking all records in the postseason, McDavid became the first skater in over 20 years to win the Conn Smythe Trophy while on the losing team testament to his greatness and grassy impact on the game.In the 2024 postseason, the Edmonton Oilers had the best player; McDavid was simply an outstanding player with 42 points in 25 games, the highest among all. His help was instrumental for the Oilers to push deep into the Stanley Cup Final.Though the Oilers went down in Game 6 to the Florida Panthers, the Conn Smythe went to McDavid. He is only the sixth player in NHL history to have one without the Cup, last witnessed in 2003 with Jean-Sebastien Giguere. This award was further confirmation of McDavid’s standing as the modern icon of hockey.With the dust settling on the Stanley Cup, future interests very quickly came into play. Edmonton's management, led by GM Ken Holland, is already being pushed to put the team in the best shape for one more deep run.Defense is still a concern, and free agents may be out there to somehow shore up support for McDavid and Leon Draisaitl.McDavid is signed through 2026, but early contract talks have already begun among NL circles. Some have predicted it could break salary records, although McDavid himself has stayed in the spotlight with the focus on winning and not the money.This same offseason could decide Draisaitl's future, since here is the other star whose contract will expire in 2025. Both have expressed a wish to stay, but their commitment to the team may depend on whether the right players are brought in to support them.In between all the skills, speed, and records, Connor McDavid is the very spirit of Edmonton hockey. His ability to put things into perspective, even after a tremendous disappointment like a Stanley Cup loss, just speaks so much for his leadership. McDavid leads by example in every practice, every game, every loss- that building spirit for his teammates, inspiring the fans, and this world of hockey just cannot afford to lose sight of him.The class shown in his post-Final remarks last season was behind him; now it was time to grow and prepare for next season. After such mental processing is what takes him beyond an elite forward; it is what makes him a champion in the making.The 2024 playoff heroics of Connor McDavid, accompanied by the rare Conn Smythe Trophy win with no victory in sight, characterize a player at the height of his power and maturity. With a crucial offseason ahead of the Edmonton Oilers, one thing is crystal clear: as long as McDavid is an Oiler, a Stanley Cup will never be far from hope. His story is far from over-just entering its most exciting chapter.Also Read: How will the Edmonton Oilers retain Connor McDavid?

“Sh*t dawg… the people wanna see it?”

All eyes on Toronto as Marchand hits free agency radar



Brad Marchand has never needed many words to make an impact—on or off the ice. Now, just days before entering free agency, the veteran forward has stirred the NHL landscape with a single Instagram comment that’s fueling intense speculation about a potential move to the Toronto Maple Leafs. Coming off a stellar postseason with the Florida Panthers, Marchand has once again seized the spotlight—this time, with a message that has fans and analysts on edge.The buzz began when veteran NHL insider Nick Kypreos made a bold claim during his appearance on Leafs Morning Take: “I don’t know how [Marchand] doesn’t end up as a Maple Leaf.” Kypreos pointed to the financial leverage Toronto holds and Marchand’s underpaid eight-year, $49 million contract as key factors.Marchand’s reply came not in a press release, but in a striking comment on Instagram:For a player who has long been a central figure in heated rivalries particularly between Boston and Toronto just acknowledging the possibility of joining the Maple Leafs was enough to dominate headlines.The Maple Leafs are entering a pivotal offseason. With over $25 million in projected cap space and uncertainty surrounding stars like Mitch Marner and John Tavares, the franchise is actively seeking a cultural reset.General manager Brad Treliving has spoken openly about the need to alter the team’s ""DNA""—and Marchand fits the bill.Despite being 37, he remains a postseason powerhouse.

Connor McDavid rumored to join Tampa Bay Lightning after another Cup loss

Connor McDavid’s quiet finals and media pressure spark trade talks

An unexpected is making waves in the NHL world. A major rumor has surfaced, and it involves one of the biggest stars in hockey — Connor McDavid. After another painful Stanley Cup loss for the Edmonton Oilers, whispers are now pointing to a possible move. But it’s not just about leaving — it’s where he might go that has fans shocked.On June 20, 2025, during the latest episode of the Spittin’ Chiclets podcast, a surprising topic came up — could Connor McDavid leave the Edmonton Oilers and join the Tampa Bay Lightning? The podcast team discussed this rumor in a segment that was later shared on social media platform X by Game Notes.The talk started when host Mike Grinnell brought up whispers of McDavid heading south. Former player Matt Murley added, “There wasn’t much detail. It just said that it was a rumor.” But Murley also said it made sense. “He’s gotta be so sick of this media up in Canada… A team from Florida — what, they’ve won the Cup four of the last six years?”Another host, Colby Armstrong, also said he believed Tampa Bay had all the pieces to attract someone like McDavid. “They have the weapons to do it,” he said, while mentioning how tough Tampa was for Florida to beat in the first round of the playoffs.The idea of McDavid leaving a Canadian team to chase a championship in the U.S. is being compared to when NBA star LeBron James left Cleveland for the Miami Heat in 2010. Warm weather, less media pressure, and a winning team — that’s what Tampa offers.Connor McDavid had a tough time in the 2025 Stanley Cup Final.In Game 6, held on June 17 in Florida, he ended with no points and a -4 rating. Across the six-game series, the Oilers captain scored only one goal and had just seven points — a big drop for someone with his record.Also Read: Connor McDavid Rumors Explode As Leon Draisaitl Speaks On Uncertain Edmonton Oilers Future Canadian fans and media were expecting him to lead the team to victory. But the Florida Panthers shut him down and took the Cup again. After the loss, McDavid said during the postgame press conference, “We kept trying the same thing over and over again… just banging our heads against the wall.”Edmonton head coach Kris Knoblauch defended him, saying on June 18, “I think there’s been a lot of good scoring chances for him… I’ve got no issues with his game.” Still, fans wondered if McDavid had reached his limit in Edmonton — and if it’s time for a new chapter. In today’s shifting NHL landscape, McDavid’s rumored departure to Tampa Bay symbolizes more than a trade—it reflects a quest for legacy, relief from relentless scrutiny, and a renewed championship pursuit in a welcoming environment.",Connor mcdavid had a tough time in the 2025 stanley cup final.

Oilers GM Stan Bowman : “Connor is our leader and no. 1 priority”



“Connor’s the best player in the League, the most important player in the League, he’s our captain, he’s our leader, and certainly he’s a No. 1 priority,”

“He’s earned the right for us to be respectful of his time.”

Connor McDavid’s contract situation is the hottest topic in Edmonton and the Oilers aren’t leaving any room for doubt: re-signing their superstar captain is the franchise’s top priority. With McDavid entering the final season of his eight-year, $100 million deal, the Oilers are gearing up to do whatever it takes to keep the face of the franchise in Edmonton long-term.There’s no understating the impact Connor McDavid has had on the Edmonton Oilers—and the NHL as a whole. As he enters the final year of his eight-year, $100 million contract, general manager Stan Bowman wasted no time addressing the elephant in the room.Bowman said.McDavid, 28, will be eligible to sign an extension on July 1. If he doesn’t, he’ll become an unrestricted free agent in 2026—a scenario that would send shockwaves through the hockey world. But the Oilers aren’t panicking.Instead, they’re focused on building a winning culture that aligns with what McDavid values most: a Stanley Cup.The three-time Hart Trophy winner and five-time Art Ross Trophy recipient delivered another phenomenal season, putting up 100 points in 67 games and leading all players with 33 points in the 2025 Stanley Cup Playoffs. Yet again, he proved he’s not just elite—he’s in a class of his own.Despite back-to-back Stanley Cup Final losses to the Florida Panthers, McDavid hasn’t lost focus. According to Bowman, winning—not money or accolades—is his driving force.The Oilers already extended Leon Draisaitl on an eight-year, $112 million deal, and McDavid’s next contract is expected to become the richest in NHL history. But for Edmonton, this goes beyond numbers. It’s about legacy, loyalty, and finally bringing the Stanley Cup back to Oil Country.Also Read: Brad Marchand ignites Maple Leafs buzz with cryptic “Sh*t dawg” comment ahead of NHL free agency With key roster decisions ahead—including re-signing Trent Frederic and Evan Bouchard—Bowman’s offseason mission is to keep the core intact and give McDavid every reason to stay.","Oilers gm stan bowman calls connor mcdavid the team’s top priority.

Lobo Predicted It, Again: South Africa’s Historic WTC Win vs Australia

NEW DELHI: A chaotic moment of fielding madness overshadowed a high-pressure Eliminator in Maharashtra's premier T20 league as Vicky Ostwal capitalised on a comical lapse by Kolhapur Tuskers to turn the tide for Raigad Royals at the MCA Stadium in Pune.Chasing a tricky total of 160, Ostwal found himself at the centre of a bizarre sequence during the middle overs.Having punched a back-foot shot off Atman Pore through the cover region, he and his batting partner looked to push for a second run. But disaster struck mid-pitch, with both batters colliding and falling flat, giving Kolhapur a golden opportunity to run Ostwal out.What followed, however, left fans and commentators stunned.The throw came in from the deep straight to the keeper, who astonishingly decided to send it back to the bowler instead of completing the run-out himself, despite Ostwal being well short of his crease.Watch:Pore, caught off-guard, fumbled the return. Realising a window still existed, a Kolhapur fielder grabbed the ball and sprinted toward the striker’s end.Sensing danger again, Ostwal made a dash for safety.The shy at the stumps missed, and with no one backing up, Ostwal regained his ground unscathed.The Royals’ dugout erupted in laughter and relief, while Kolhapur Tuskers looked on in disbelief.Fans, in disbelief, started commenting on the incident. ""Finding Sportmanship,"" one fan wrote. Another fan quipped, ""Every player on the field should retire immediately.""The farcical miss proved incredibly costly. Riding his fortune, Ostwal went on to anchor the chase with a brilliant 74 off 54 balls, steering Raigad Royals to a dramatic victory in this knockout clash.With this win, the Royals march into Qualifier 2, where they will take on Puneri Bappa for a place in the grand final. Whether Ostwal's survival becomes a tournament-defining moment remains to be seen, but for now, it’s a viral sensation and a painful memory for Kolhapur.",Raigad royals beat kolhapur tuskers by four wickets in maharashtra t20 eliminator.

India on Friday enjoyed an ideal start to the five-match series, reaching stumps on the opening day of the first Test in the dominant position of 359 for 3, as opener Yashasvi Jaiswal (101) and new captain Shubman Gill (127* not out) took a toll on England's attack.The duo stitched together a 123-run stand for the third wicket to steady the ship for the tourists after they lost two quick wickets just before lunch.However, India could have lost their captain right after the break if England's vice-captain Ollie Pope had hit the stumps from mid-wicket after Gill rushed to take a quick single and had to do a full-stretched dive to reach home.In a video going viral on social media, both Jaiswal and Gill can be heard having a hilarious conversation.""

(Come on, let’s take the single), Jaiswal pleaded to his captain. But Gill was having none of it, and the 23-year-old muttered in disappointment: ""Shubman tried to explain to his opener that the fielder was a bit close and apologized: """" (He was a bit forward, sorry).Jaiswal responded cheekily: """" (He’s really far).The left-handed batter played an exceptional innings of 101 runs off 159 balls, laced with 16 boundaries and a maximum, while Shubman remained unbeaten on 127 at stumps on Day 1.",India reach 359-3 on day 1 of first test against england at headingley.
