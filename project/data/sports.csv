Punjab cross the 300-run mark

NEW DELHI: After enduring a series of low scores on his comeback to the domestic T20 tournament - Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy - as Punjab ’s captain, young India opener Abhishek Sharma produced a breathtaking counterattack on Sunday morning, hammering a record-breaking century against a seasoned Bengal bowling attack at the Gymkhana Ground in Hyderabad.Came out to open the innings after Punjab opted to bat first, Abhishek found his rhythm immediately. He blasted his way to a half-century in just 12 deliveries, launching into his former Sunrisers Hyderabad teammate and senior India pacer Mohammed Shami for 23 runs in a single over.The scale of the assault by the Punjab batter was astonishing. By the time he reached his fifty, the left-handed sensation had scored 50 of his first 51 runs in boundaries only, smashing five sixes and five fours to leave Bengal stunned.Alongside him, Prabhsimran Singh also fired up early, helping Punjab surge past 120 inside eight overs. Abhishek continued to muscle sixes straight down the ground, repeatedly targeting the V region with brutal precision.The carnage didn’t stop. Abhishek stormed to a century in 32 balls, finishing with 11 sixes and seven fours before reaching triple figures. This knock marked his eighth T20 hundred in 157 innings, bringing him level with Rohit Sharma.Among Indian batters, only Virat Kohli (nine) has more T20 centuries.Just last season, Abhishek smashed a 28-ball hundred against Meghalaya, the joint-fastest by any Indian in T20 cricket. He also struck 87 sixes in T20s in 2024, the most by an Indian man in a single year.With 16 sixes in this innings alone, Abhishek went past his 2024 tally, becoming the first Indian to cross 90 T20 sixes in a calendar year.Abhishek eventually departed for a spectacular 148 off 52 balls, with 16 sixes and eight fours, but not before powering Punjab to a score beyond 300. They have now become only the second Indian T20 side, after Baroda against Sikkim in 2024, to breach the 300-run barrier.","Abhishek sharma smashed a record-breaking century against bengal.

Palash dreamt of coming home with his bride. I had even planned a special welcome... Everything will be fine, shaadi bohot jaldi hogi,"" she had told Hindustan Times.The situation has garnered significant attention, particularly given Mandhana's status as one of India's premier cricketers and Muchhal's reputation in the music industry.Both families are currently focused on the recovery of their loved ones, while supporters and fans await news of the rescheduled wedding date.The unexpected health issues have affected what was anticipated to be a high-profile celebration, bringing together two prominent personalities from the worlds of sports and entertainment.The timing of the postponement, following India's World Cup triumph, has added to the public interest in the situation, with both Mandhana and Muchhal receiving support from their respective professional communities.Despite the current circumstances, both families maintain a positive outlook regarding the future celebration of the union between the cricketer and the music composer.","Smriti mandhana and palash muchhal's wedding has been postponed.

Jaxson Dart 's necklace: The deeper meaning behind a Giants good luck charm



Jaxson Dart's necklace sparkles during every New York Giants game, but beneath the bright stadium lights, it stands for something far more personal. This small piece of jewelry has been with him through bowl games, draft day expectations, and now the roaring NFL stage. It is never just part of his outfit. It is a ritual, a reminder, a heartbeat from home woven into every snap and every throw.He takes the field with confidence, toughness, and real emotion. It is a demanding job to step into the spotlight as a rookie quarterback in New York, but Dart brings a piece of family faith to steady him in every moment. That little chain carries a lot of heart.When asked about the necklace, Dart explains it openly. ""I haven't missed a game with it. I make sure it's one of the first things that I pack,"" Dart said. For him, it is not crafted from diamonds or forged by luxury jewelers. It is something much more meaningful. It came from his sister.He still remembers the moment he first picked it up. ""I remember I was walking out the door, and I was just grabbing my headphones, whatever it may be on the table, and I saw this necklace,"" he said. ""I looked at it and I was like, dang, I like that necklace. I asked my mom, I said, 'Whose is it?' And she's like it's your sister's.""That day, he wore it into a college bowl game and threw four touchdowns.From then on, it became tradition. ""It started out because I felt like it looked cool, you know, during the games. And that was kind of a swag piece that I'd put together each game day,"" he said. ""It's a good luck charm for sure. But at the same time, it's a cool thing between me and my sister.""Through every rough tackle and every triumphant first down, it stays with him. ""I try to do my best to adjust it if it's kind of messed up when I come back on the sideline,"" Dart said. ""It's definitely held its own because I've taken a lot of hits.""The hearts on the chain are not real gemstones, but they might as well be priceless. ""It's definitely very valuable to me, because like I said, it's a relationship thing between me and my sister,"" Dart said. Then he shared the meaning that goes beyond football. ""I've kind of thought of it as a deeper meaning to love all that you're around ... a special reminder that we live in a world where maybe not everybody agrees with everybody's opinion. I think that's kind of the beauty of our identity as people. But at the same time, I think it's important to share love and bring people together. So that's just kind of like the emoji of a heart, bringing people together and kind of spreading joy and love to all.""In a league full of glare and glitter, Jaxson Dart reminds us that the most powerful symbols are not worn for show.

Leon Draisaitl and Connor McDavid still carry the Oilers’ offense

Leon Draisaitl made news when he gave a short and cold answer to people talking about the Edmonton Oilers’ leadership. A podcast online said the team’s top players, like Leon Draisaitl and captain Connor McDavid, were not showing enough strong direction when the team struggled. The video spread fast, and many fans talked about it. When Leon Draisaitl saw the clip, he replied with just one word: “Lol.” His reply was simple, but it got a lot of likes and showed he did not agree with the talk about weak leadership.The podcast hosts said the team’s main leaders should be the ones pulling everyone together during tough nights. They felt the Edmonton Oilers still leaned too much on older veteran players for guidance. They also said Draisaitl and McDavid are now older and should not need as much help. This started a big discussion because both players have already led the Oilers to long playoff runs.The Edmonton Oilers reached the Stanley Cup Final in both 2024 and 2025. Connor McDavid played a huge role and won major awards. Leon Draisaitl also had strong numbers and scored many big points. They were the two players who pushed the team forward each year.Because of this, some fans feel the criticism is unfair, while others think it is needed for the team to grow.But even with their talent, this season has not been smooth. The Oilers have been up and down. They have wins and losses that keep them in the middle. Their offense still shines because of Connor McDavid and Leon Draisaitl, who both continue to score and make plays. But the team’s biggest problem is still on defense. They give up too many goals, and the goalies face too much pressure each night. This hurts their chances to move up in the standings.Connor McDavid has many points this season and still drives the attack every game. Leon Draisaitl also has strong numbers and helps the team stay in games. Their power play is strong, and they create many chances. But offense alone cannot fix everything. The team needs better defense and better support if they want to reach the Stanley Cup Final again.Leon Draisaitl’s “Lol” reply showed he is not worried about outside noise. Now fans wait to see how the Edmonton Oilers respond on the ice, where leadership matters the most.Also Read: NHL Injury Update: Ryan Nugent-Hopkins Returns, While Kaapo Kakko And William Nylander Remain Questionable","Leon draisaitl made news when he gave a short and cold answer to people talking about the edmonton oilers’ leadership.

How Leon Draisaitl and Mitch Marner have forced a rethink of what a true Selke contender looks like,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/how-leon-draisaitl-and-mitch-marner-have-forced-a-rethink-of-what-a-true-selke-contender-looks-like/articleshow/125696969.cms,"Leon Draisaitl shocks critics by surging into Selke race as Mitch Marner becomes unexpected defensive star (Getty Images)

Mitch Marner’s two-way transformation fuels Selke buzz while Leon Draisaitl rises as elite defensive force





The NHL ’s early stretch has shifted the spotlight toward a new kind of player impact. Coaches and analysts are tracking not just point totals, but how forwards influence momentum, shut down lanes, and change the pace of a game without requiring a highlight-reel goal. The result is a Selke Trophy race that feels more open and unpredictable than in recent seasons. It has allowed players typically viewed as offensive dynamos to showcase their defensive evolution, reshaping the conversation around who truly drives winning hockey.This year’s early standings have also highlighted a refreshing reality. When reputations take a back seat and performance speaks louder, new names rise. That shift has widened the door for forwards whose on-ice value extends beyond scoring touch, and it has pulled Leon Draisaitl and Mitch Marner directly into the heart of the Selke discussion.In a recent column assessing the Selke Trophy race, NHL analyst Dom Luszczyszyn of The Athletic placed Leon Draisaitl and Mitch Marner squarely in the top tier of defensive forwards. He laid out the early contenders through his Defensive Rating model and emphasized the chaos of this year’s race. “With no Aleksander Barkov this season, the Selke trophy race will likely be this season’s most fascinating,” he wrote, pointing to a rare window of opportunity for two-way excellence.His analysis positioned Nick Suzuki as the early leader, noting how effectively his presence suppresses opposing chances. Beyond Suzuki, Luszczyszyn paid attention to forwards whose defensive impact shows up in subtler ways. It was in this layer where Marner and Draisaitl emerged as standouts. Luszczyszyn stated that “Mitch Marner, Leon Draisaitl, and Matty Beniers have all put up excellent results,” reinforcing the credibility of their defensive progress.Draisaitl’s recognition comes during another season where he remains Edmonton’s offensive engine. Even with the Oilers enduring inconsistent stretches, Draisaitl has sharpened his engagements in the defensive zone. He reads plays early, supports defenders during sustained pressure, and uses his size and timing to disrupt transitions. These moments rarely appear in the box score, yet they have played a substantial role in stabilizing Edmonton when it matters.Marner’s shift is just as compelling. In Vegas, he has taken on more responsibility and handled it with poise. The trademark playmaking is intact, but now it sits beside strong pursuit habits and smart defensive recovery. Marner often turns defensive stops into fast-break opportunities, and that dual-threat element has boosted Vegas during tight matchups.The broader analysis also acknowledged sturdy campaigns from Mikael Backlund, Tyson Foerster, and Mika Zibanejad. Yet the standout story is how natural scorers like Draisaitl and Marner have layered defensive maturity into their game. They may not be traditional shutdown specialists, but they are proving that elite offense can live within a balanced, disciplined two-way identity.Also Read: Connor Bedard’s fearless statement after Ducks game shows he’s ready to change the NHL narrative","Nhl analyst dom luszczyszyn placed leon draisaitl and mitch marner squarely in the top tier of defensive forwards.

“Such a low character player”: Fan outrage erupts over Cal Foote’s return as sexual assault case acquittal divides NHL community,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/such-a-low-character-player-fan-outrage-erupts-over-cal-footes-return-as-sexual-assault-case-acquittal-divides-nhl-community/articleshow/125706517.cms,"Cal Foote's return to North American hockey sparks debate following his acquittal in a sexual assault case. While reinstated by the NHL, his AHL signing with the Chicago Wolves has ignited fan backlash and cautious optimism. The hockey community is divided on whether performance can be separated from character, raising questions about redemption and trust.

Fan backlash, cautious optimism, and the bigger question of redemption in hockey culture

Cal Foote’s re-entry into North American hockey is emerging as a lightning-rod moment for the sport, touching not just on one player’s return but on how the NHL and its fanbase grapple with cases involving conduct, trust, and reintegration. After being acquitted in the 2018 Hockey Canada sexual assault case, Foote received NHL reinstatement, though the league was clear that the players’ actions “fell woefully short” of its standards.That lingering tone of condemnation, even alongside legal acquittal, has kept emotions high. Now that the Chicago Wolves have given Foote a one-year AHL deal, with the potential for a path back to the Hurricanes’ NHL roster, the hockey community is openly wrestling with whether performance and character can ever fully be separated in today’s game.Once the Wolves publicly stated: ""Defenseman Cal Foote has signed a standard AHL contract."", the internet reactions arrived immediately and loudly. Some comments were blunt and unforgiving, like “That’s disappointing” and “disgusting.” One fan went further, warning: “Keep him far far away from any of the Cane’s prospects… adding such a low character player is not a good decision.”Others echoed concerns about proximity to younger players, team culture, and locker-room influence.Yet there was also a contrasting pocket of support, comments like “Nice signing need more blue line depth” suggest that some fans are ready to move forward and judge Foote strictly on his performance, not past accusations.Foote’s strong season in Slovakia, 30 points in 38 games, makes him a hockey-asset on paper. But the backlash shows that for many, the story isn’t about stats; it’s about trust. The comparison to Carter Hart’s return adds context: cleared, reinstated, and telling fans, “I’m just looking forward to moving ahead… and showing the community here what I’m really about and my true character and who I am.”The NHL may have ruled on eligibility, but public acceptance is a separate court entirely. Foote’s challenge now isn’t just to play well, it’s to convince a skeptical audience that professional redemption can exist without erasing what came before.Also Read: Is Sidney Crosby engaged?

Former Leafs boss criticizes leadership group and suggests Matthews isn’t the captain Toronto desperately needs





The Toronto Maple Leafs find themselves in a moment of uncomfortable reflection. What began as a bold shift in leadership by handing Auston Matthews the captaincy has now become a topic of pointed criticism, sparked by a former executive who feels the team lost its compass. The question drawing attention across the hockey world is simple. Did the Leafs pick the wrong captain, and are they now paying the price through uninspired play and fragile identity?Former Leafs GM Gord Stellick spoke plainly about the heart of the issue. He believes leadership and talent are not synonymous. He said, ""There's nothing wrong if your best player isn't a leader. All I can say is last year, you couldn't be more of a team guy, a classy guy, the way he (John Tavares) handled the transition, and then the leadership meant nothing, it's not even a visible thing. It's almost like an award to wear the C. "" His words echo the sentiment of many frustrated fans who now look back at that decision with uneasy hindsight.Stellick did not stop at questioning Matthews as captain. He revealed who he would have chosen. ""If you would have asked me a few years ago, I would've picked Morgan Rielly. He kind of strikes me as a captain, but its an important thing being the captain, and the leadership group is important.""Rielly has longevity and presence, but like Matthews, has never quite taken command of the locker room in that commanding way a captain must.Tavares remains the quiet constant. A professional who knows when to speak, when to deliver and when to let his play do the talking. Yet the captaincy shift forced him to take a step back in title, even if not in spirit. Stellick suggested the leadership change carried symbolism more than substance, raising the concern that the Leafs valued optics over intrinsic leadership dynamics.Still, accountability now rests on the current leaders. As Stellick put it, ""At some point you got to evolve to be the real leaders, and that's where we're going to find out now, a litmus test, about a team that has no business [being] where they are right now, and can this leadership group lead them?"" That test is already underway.If Matthews and his leadership group cannot steer this franchise back to identity and resilience, then the Maple Leafs may soon find John Tavares acting as the quiet stabilizing force once more. Captain or not, his presence still commands respect, even without the C sewn onto his jersey.Also Read: Connor Bedard’s fearless statement after Ducks game shows he’s ready to change the NHL narrative","Former leafs gm slams current leadership and claims auston matthews was the wrong choice for captain.

Sitanshu Kotak press conference: Big statement on Virat Kohli, India win and more

Poll How challenging do you believe it is for bowlers to dismiss Virat Kohli once he settles in? Extremely challenging Moderately challenging Somewhat challenging

NEW DELHI: South Africa all-rounder Marco Jansen offered a candid and striking assessment of what it feels like to bowl to Virat Kohli , admitting that world-class batters of the Indian superstar's calibre become “almost impossible to stop” once they settle in. Kohli's masterful 135 in the first ODI in Ranchi not only powered India to a 17-run win and a 1-0 series lead, but also reaffirmed the challenge bowlers face against him — a challenge Jansen says leaves little room for error.Reflecting on the knock, Jansen said the only genuine opportunity a bowler has comes right at the start of a batter's innings.“When you bowl to world-class players, it's quite difficult to get them out. I always try to get a batter in his first 10 or 15 balls. That's when they're still getting used to the wicket,” Jansen explained.But with Kohli, he said, the equation changes rapidly.“Once they're in, and they get on a roll, it's very difficult to stop them. Everyone here knows how to play — that's why you go to plan B or C.”Kohli's 52nd ODI century on Sunday was classic Virat — tempo control, smart risk-taking, and an extended stay that he has made a hallmark of his greatness.For Jansen, the difficulty lies in the completeness of Kohli's batting.Jansen first bowled to Kohli as a 17-year-old net bowler during India's 2017–18 South Africa tour, and the impact remains vivid.“It's nice to watch him play. Growing up watching him on TV to actually bowling to him now… it's annoying but it's fun at the same time,” he said. “He drives well, he pulls well, cuts well, plays with his pads well. I don't think much has changed — he's just batting longer and longer.”On his own form, Jansen said a strong top order is giving him the freedom to express himself with the bat lower down. “I'm just watching the ball and playing it as it comes. At the moment it's working for me.”Despite trailing 0-1, Jansen insisted South Africa were “not disheartened”, saying the team believed they were “doing the right things” and only needed to stack good spells consistently. He added that injury updates would be clearer before the second ODI in Raipur, with Aiden Markram continuing to lead in Temba Bavuma 's absence.India and South Africa now shift focus to Raipur, where the high-stakes second ODI awaits.","Virat kohli's masterful 135 in the first odi in ranchi reaffirmed the challenge bowlers face against him.

Sidney Crosby calls for change



The Pittsburgh Penguins are in a challenging phase this season, and Sidney Crosby’s voice has become the stabilizing force amid the turbulence. After their crushing 7–2 loss to the Toronto Maple Leafs on November 29, the frustration was evident. Yet, Crosby still managed to carve his name even deeper into hockey history with his 641st career goal on a night that otherwise few in Pittsburgh would want to remember. It was a reminder that even in defeat, he continues to produce greatness.That disappointment followed a season that began with thrilling promise. The Penguins raced into the 2025–26 campaign with energy that felt familiar, almost nostalgic. Crosby was scoring like the game’s most dominant force and Evgeni Malkin was setting up plays with the touch that once defined entire highlight reels. But by mid-November, the slide had already begun, and the rhythm that fueled their hot start faded.Crosby didn’t hide from accountability. After the loss to Toronto, he spoke directly about the core issue. “We must take care of prime scoring areas,” he asserted. “You cannot allow teams high-quality chances and expect to win.” It was a message rooted in experience. He has worn the captain’s voice through every stage of this franchise, from parades to painful rebuilds.His season, though, remains on an incredible trajectory. Crosby is pacing for a potential 55-goal, 92-point campaign, which would be his best goal scoring output since 2009–10. He continues climbing the record books. He now sits 15th on the all-time goals list. He already surpassed Steve Yzerman for ninth place in assists. He even registered his 500th multi-point performance, becoming the third-fastest player in NHL history to reach that mark.But numbers alone aren’t the story. Longevity is. These days, almost every Penguins game feels like another milestone evening. With Crosby, Malkin, and Kris Letang still sharing the ice more than two decades after their early ascents, the historic moments stack up in a blur. Fans know the names. They don’t need repeating. The city has watched them grow, and now watches them fight the clock.Crosby’s detailed response to how the team must improve resonated like a coaching directive. “Well, I think just focusing on making sure that the slot and the prime scoring areas, that we take care of that. Every team’s gonna have guys who are dangerous and they’re gonna be opportunistic, so you can’t give them chances of that quality and expect to win games. So I think just focus on our own end and let everything else kind of take care of itself. ”For Pittsburgh, this is now about urgency. Their defense needs reliability. Letang must rediscover steadiness. The blue line needs punch and presence. If this group wants one more Stanley Cup run, it won’t happen on skill alone. It will require the mindset Crosby still carries: responsibility, precision, and belief that this story isn’t finished yet.Also Read: Auston Matthews’ captaincy questioned as former Leafs GM hints the team elevated the wrong figure","Sidney crosby has worn the captain’s voice through every stage of this franchise, from parades to painful rebuilds.

Why Cincinnati Makes Sense for Buxton

Astros’ Motive: Rotation Stability

Twins’ Return: Prospects to Support a Transition

Why the Deal Still Feels Unlikely

The Cincinnati Reds may be approaching the offseason with several areas to evaluate, but one need sits clearly above the rest: adding more power to a lineup that struggled to produce consistent thump. A new trade concept from MLB.com’s Anthony Castrovince puts forward a dramatic solution - one that involves making a push for Minnesota Twins star Byron Buxton through a multi-team blockbuster. It’s an idea built around the Reds’ pitching depth and the possibility of acquiring a dynamic, game-changing outfielder without diving into the expensive end of free agency.But the proposal isn’t limited to a simple two-team exchange. Castrovince outlines a three-team structure involving the Reds, Twins, and Houston Astros, each addressing a different roster priority. For Cincinnati, it’s about landing a high-impact bat. For Houston, it’s securing a mid-rotation arm. And for Minnesota, it’s about collecting a group of prospects to support their transition. The concept may be unlikely to materialize, yet it brings together several logical elements that make it worth exploring.Castrovince’s concept revolves around the Reds leveraging their pitching depth, the Astros reinforcing their rotation, and the Twins securing a wave of prospects.Here is how the deal would look based on the proposal:Buxton, who has spent his entire career with Minnesota, is seen as an ideal fit for a Reds club that has been searching for a dynamic bat. As Castrovince wrote, “Buxton would be perfect for a Reds team that could use its pitching depth to address a lineup in need.”One of the major selling points is Buxton’s contract. He is owed roughly $15 million annually for the next three seasons, a number that sits well below what top free-agent hitters will command on the open market. That affordability naturally increases his appeal across the league, though Buxton previously declared himself “a Minnesota Twin for life,” a statement that could complicate any trade discussions.Houston’s inclusion centers on adding right-hander Brady Singer, who is entering his final year of arbitration. The Astros are facing the likely departure of Framber Valdez in free agency, leaving a gap in the middle of their rotation. Singer fits both their competitive timeline and their payroll.Castrovince noted, “Singer, who is entering his final year of arbitration, does not fit a Twins team in transition but does fit an Astros team that needs an affordable mid-rotation arm.” (H/t: Sporting News)Minnesota’s role in the deal is centered on long-term roster building. The Twins would receive four prospects, two from Cincinnati and two from Houston: Tyson Lewis, Mason Neville, Walker Janek, and Cole Hrtzler. The organization is navigating a transitional phase, and a multi-prospect return aligns with their broader strategy.Even with the pieces seemingly aligned, the proposal faces a major hurdle - Buxton’s ability to veto a trade. His long-standing connection to the Twins organization and his recent comments make any potential move difficult to finalize.Also read: MLB trade rumors: New York Yankees could bag $30 million Milwaukee Brewers 2x All-Star to improve title odds ahead of deadline Castrovince admitted that this is likely a trade that never happens, though he added that the framework hits several logical points for all involved clubs. This trade idea addresses all of them, even if only on paper for now.","A new trade concept from mlb.com’s anthony castrovince puts forward a dramatic solution.

Shedeur Sanders’ performance and mom Pilar’s unwavering support





Shedeur Sanders stepped onto the field for his first professional home start with the Cleveland Browns on Sunday against the San Francisco 49ers, and all eyes were on both him and his supportive mom, Pilar Sanders. The rookie quarterback, drafted in the fifth round despite high expectations, has already started making waves after a victory over the Las Vegas Raiders last week. Throwing for 209 yards, a touchdown, and one interception, Shedeur proved he could rise to the occasion when given the opportunity.This week, after being named QB1 over Dillon Gabriel, Sanders balanced preparation with family support. He spent time at his mother’s home with brother Shilo, enjoying home-cooked meals and studying film before the big game. But pregame attention wasn’t reserved for his on-field performance alone. Shedeur made headlines with a self-promoting outfit from his Legendary brand, and Pilar followed suit with a bold statement fit of her own. Browns fans and media couldn’t help but notice, as she continues to turn heads with her stylish game-day ensembles.Despite the cold, mom Pilar was at the stadium to cheer her son on in person. She previously stole the spotlight during Shedeur’s NFL debut with a custom t-shirt, and Sunday’s winter-ready look was just as memorable.On the field, Shedeur completed 16-of-25 passes for 149 yards, adding a touchdown and a seven-yard rush. While the Browns fell short against the 49ers, the young quarterback’s potential remains clear.“Very committed to working at it, doing a great job, communicating with coaches, with the players,” Browns coach Kevin Stefanski said of Sanders. “Good work week, but nothing different. I think any player, though, once you get one game under your belt, you got the next one coming. I think it can only help.”Shedeur Sanders is not only focused on proving himself on the field but is also buoyed by the confidence and style of his mom. Whether he maintains the starting role for the rest of the season remains to be seen, but one thing is certain: Pilar Sanders will be there, front and center, cheering him on every step of the way.Also Read: While Drake Maye preps quietly for Giants, wife Ann’s viral gym photo brings unexpected buzz to Patriots fans","Shedeur sanders made his nfl debut for the cleveland browns on sunday.

Phoenix Suns Injury Report vs the Los Angeles Lakers (December 1, 2025)

Los Angeles Lakers Injury Report vs the Phoenix Suns (December 1, 2025)

What to Expect in This Clash

The Los Angeles Lakers and Phoenix Suns collide on December 1, 2025, at Crypto.com Arena in a matchup carrying major Pacific Division implications. Phoenix arrives at 12-9, trying to snap a two-game losing streak, while the 15-4 Lakers ride into the night on a commanding seven-game win streak. With both teams searching for separation early in the season, injuries on each side could play a defining role in how this contest unfolds.This meeting also highlights contrasting storylines: the Phoenix Suns lean heavily on Devin Booker and Dillon Brooks to stabilize a roster depleted on the wings, whereas the Los Angeles Lakers enter with momentum, depth, and a potential return from one of the greatest players of all time. Add in Luka Dončić’s dominance and Phoenix’s NBA-leading activity in transition defense, and the stage is set for a tightly contested battle despite the teams’ differing recent trajectories.Phoenix Suns’ injury situation is clearer - and more concerning - heading into this matchup. The Suns confirmed two players as out and listed one as probable, continuing the trend of a narrowed rotation following losses to Oklahoma City and Denver.Jalen Green remains unavailable due to a right hamstring strain that has kept him out since early November. The timetable for his reevaluation stands at 4-6 weeks, limiting him to just two games this season. Isaiah Livers also remains sidelined with a right hip strain, a recurring setback that hinders the Suns’ bench depth and scoring options.A positive development comes with Ryan Dunn upgrading to probable after missing five games with a right wrist sprain suffered in a fall over Rudy Gobert. His 8.4 points per game and defensive presence provide Phoenix with much-needed energy. Mark Williams and Grayson Allen avoid the injury report entirely - Williams working past calf soreness from the Denver loss, and Allen returning from a quad contusion. With Booker averaging 25.7 points, Brooks contributing 21.5, and Allen adding 17.9 points and 3.8 threes per game, Phoenix leans heavily on its perimeter trio. Their ability to capitalize on the Suns’ league-best 10.6 steals per game will be critical.The Los Angeles Lakers had not submitted their official injury report by midday, but early indications point toward a positive update. LeBron James, who missed the first 14 games with sciatica and continued left foot management, is expected to suit up. In his four appearances since returning, he has averaged 16.5 points and 8.3 assists, with coach JJ Redick describing the situation as a past issue now under control. Marcus Smart’s back spasms made him questionable or out against New Orleans, though his status appears precautionary.Deandre Ayton, facing his former team, also appears ready to go after dismissing concerns about a minor knee bump. His recent 22-point, 12-rebound outing underscores his impact alongside Dončić, the league’s scoring leader at 35.1 points per game, and Austin Reaves, who is in the midst of a career-best season at 28.8 points per game. The Lakers also continue to keep Bronny James in the G League.Phoenix’s limited depth puts pressure on its starters, but the probable return of Dunn and a healthy Williams could disrupt LA’s interior rhythm and spark defensive momentum. Meanwhile, the Lakers’ explosive offense, supported by Dončić and Reaves delivering back-to-back 30-point performances, makes them difficult to slow down. The Suns’ ability to force turnovers—against an LA squad averaging 15.9 giveaways - may be their best equalizer. Tip-off at 10 p.m. ET on Peacock promises a high-energy battle shaped by star power, durability, and execution in crucial possessions.","The los angeles lakers and phoenix suns collide on december 1, 2025, at crypto.com arena in a matchup carrying major pacific division implications.

Landry Kiffin (Tiktok)

The scene around Lane Kiffin’s move to LSU already felt tense, but the spotlight has quickly shifted toward his daughter, Landry Kiffin. Her reaction to the backlash from Ole Miss fans has turned into its own headline, adding a personal layer to what was already a high emotion coaching departure. On the day Lane Kiffin was officially introduced as the head coach of the LSU Tigers, Landry took a shot at the angry Ole Miss Rebels faithful who have not handled the breakup quietly.Lane Kiffin’s exit from Mississippi ends a six season run that saw him build a genuine connection in Oxford. Landry herself attended school there and was even the emotional anchor that kept her father from leaving for Auburn in 2022. Yet on Monday, LSU rolled out the purple and gold carpet and made it official. Lane also admitted during his LSU press conference that “the last 48 hours sucked” and that he understands the wave of emotions from Ole Miss fans who watched him board that private jet toward a new chapter.Landry’s presence around Ole Miss football had always been friendly and popular. Fans loved her all white game day looks and the family atmosphere around her, mom Layla and Knox. That image shifted this season when she publicly confirmed her relationship with LSU star linebacker Whit Weeks right before Ole Miss faced LSU.She even skipped several of her dad’s games to attend Weeks’ instead, wearing LSU themed looks, including her white tiger style at Alabama. Photos even showed her in custom LSU gear, which already hinted that her loyalty was drifting.There were more breadcrumbs. She reportedly showed up at an LSU booster event last week before the news broke. Then, while Ole Miss fans in Oxford were venting and airing their bitterness, Landry was in Nashville at a friend’s birthday party filming TikTok dances. She even missed the Egg Bowl and Knox’s playoff game. After the LSU announcement, her first post was a sarcastic jab at the critics where she wrote, “Wish I could be as creative as angry football fans 🫶🏻“ followed by the hashtag “#itsnotthatdeep. ”Oxford once embraced the Kiffins as family. Now the relationship feels fractured. However, based on Landry’s attitude, she seems ready to trade Mississippi awkwardness for Baton Rouge acceptance.Also Read: Why Giants rookie Jaxson Dart wears eye black and a signature chain every time he takes the field?

Tennessee Titans running back Julius Chestnut and the Cooke confrontation



Tennessee Titans running back Julius Chestnut was taken off guard by Jacksonville Jaguars punter Logan Cooke’s intense and emotional threat during Sunday’s matchup. The moment followed a bruising hit that briefly sidelined Cooke for a concussion evaluation, setting off a spark of volatile tensions. What unfolded next was not the usual trash talk. As Chestnut recalled to reporters, Cooke got close and, in his words, “said he was going to kill” him. The young Titans back shared it with a half-smile, still visibly perplexed by what he had heard. “I was just trying to play hard, and he came up to me and said he was going to kill me,” Chestnut said. “So I don’t know what made him do that.”The unexpected hostility was even stranger given that such outbursts from a punter are virtually unheard of. Chestnut added, “That was surprising to me. I ain't never seen nothing like that before.” He said he did not receive any follow-up clarification or apology from Cooke after the incident.This was not an isolated flare-up, but one scene in a broader storm between both teams. Cooke, who stands 6 feet 5 and weighs 230 pounds, is not a passive specialist. He absorbed multiple collisions during Jacksonville’s 25-3 win, including the block from Chestnut on Chimere Dike’s 47-yard return.That block sent Cooke to the turf, where he remained for concussion evaluation before returning and continuing to punt through visible frustrations.Cooke did speak after the game, but reporters never directly asked him about the alleged death threat. He instead addressed his heated interactions with Titans players and a discussion with a referee at halftime. ""I might have said some things that sounded rude, so I wanted to go clear the air,"" Cooke said. He explained that he wanted no grudges left hanging and added that emotions can escalate quickly “in the moment” during certain calls. “But it is what it is,” Cooke said. “You can’t hold that against them.”Jaguars coach Liam Coen acknowledged the emotional undercurrent that fueled Cooke’s reactions, citing the pressure of aggressive punt rushes and the challenges of working with a backup long snapper. “There were some frustrations being built up with them rushing us the way they were,” Coen said. “I’m proud of those guys for competing, but we’ve got to continue to be smarter.”In the end, the scoreboard showed a decisive Jaguars victory. The emotional fallout told a much more revealing story of rivalry, adrenaline, and human unpredictability on the field.Also Read: While Drake Maye prepares for Giants, his wife Ann’s Patriots-themed cookies become unexpected pre-game sensation","Tennessee titans running back julius chestnut reveals he was threatened with death on the field by jaguars punter logan cooke.
