Drake Maye’s breakout season keeps Patriots soaring



Drake Maye has been the heartbeat of the New England Patriots this season, guiding the team to a commanding 6-2 start and first place in the AFC East. As the young quarterback continues to impress on the field, his wife, Ann Maye, has been making waves of her own — this time with a striking rainy-day outfit that had fans talking before Sunday’s home clash against the Atlanta Falcons.While Drake has been delivering highlight moments for New England, Ann has been winning hearts in her own way. Known for her stunning game-day fits — from her custom “10” Maye jersey to her all-Patriots-blue look — she has become a fan favorite. On a recent rainy Thursday, Ann showed off a chic workout look while hitting the gym, sharing a mirror selfie that quickly grabbed attention online.The couple’s love story runs deep. Both attended UNC, where Ann’s brother Tad even played quarterback alongside Drake. Their connection dates back to middle school, and after years together, they tied the knot in June 2025.As New England prepares for a crucial Week 9 showdown, fans are not just eager to see how Maye performs — they’re also curious about what Ann will wear next. One thing’s certain: whether on the field or off it, the Mayes are becoming one of the NFL ’s most captivating power couples.Maye’s sophomore NFL campaign has been nothing short of electric.Through eight games, the 23-year-old quarterback has thrown for 2,026 yards, 15 touchdowns, and just three interceptions, displaying poise beyond his years. His leadership and accuracy have turned New England into one of the most exciting teams to watch in the league.Even rival coaches can’t help but acknowledge his talent. After Wednesday’s practice, Falcons defensive coordinator Jeff Ulbrich admitted, “He’s way better than I want him to be. He feels like a younger Josh Allen .” That comparison says a lot, considering Allen is the reigning league MVP.Maye’s journey from the No. 3 overall pick in the 2024 NFL Draft to one of the league’s most promising stars has silenced those who once questioned his readiness. Coming out of North Carolina, where he starred for the Tar Heels, many thought he lacked experience. But week after week, Maye continues to prove that he belongs among the NFL’s elite.Also Read: Isiah Pacheco’s family life: Meet his siblings Travoise, Ricky, Felicia, and Celeste who shaped his journey","Drake maye and his wife, ann, are becoming one of the nfl's most captivating power couples.

Focus shifts back to football as Travis Kelce continues rewriting Chiefs history

Kansas City Chiefs star tight end Travis Kelce once again proved his dominance on the field Monday night, but it wasn’t his 99-yard, six-catch performance or his 83rd career touchdown that had fans talking, it was what he did before kickoff.In the Chiefs’ 28–7 win over the Washington Commanders, cameras caught Kelce during the national anthem bouncing lightly on his feet, moving his hands, and placing one over his heart, all while quarterback Patrick Mahomes stood motionless with his hands behind his back. The contrast immediately went viral, sparking criticism from viewers who felt the moment showed a lack of respect.Social media filled with posts labeling the star tight end “classless” and “disrespectful.” One fan wrote, “Kelce needs to be more respectful,” while others accused him of craving attention in a solemn moment. But not everyone saw it that way. Many defended Kelce, noting his high-energy personality and game-day intensity. One user even joked, “Explains why he got kicked out of pre-school. I'm 100000% confident he was quite the handful. ”For some, it was simply a snapshot of an emotional athlete channeling adrenaline before game time, not an act of defiance.Despite the noise, Kelce’s teammates and coaches made it clear his focus remains on football. After the win, Mahomes praised him, saying, “He’s what the Chiefs represent... the guy that's been here... helped set the culture of what it means to play for Coach [Andy] Reid and for Kansas City.”Kelce, meanwhile, stayed grounded, crediting the team and his love for Arrowhead Stadium: “I just cherish these moments... being able to play at Arrowhead. This place is special, and I love it here. In terms of the historical stuff, I'm still looking at the next game and the next catch and trying to get better.”While the national anthem debate continues to divide fans, Kelce’s record-tying touchdown, matching franchise legend Priest Holmes, cements his status as one of the greatest in Chiefs history. Whether his pregame energy was misread or misunderstood, one thing remains clear: Travis Kelce’s passion for the game continues to define Kansas City’s championship culture.Also Read: Brittany Mahomes' heartwarming hidden detail in her Chiefs game day outfit proves she’s Patrick Mahomes’ No. 1 cheerleader","Travis kelce sparked online debate with his energetic actions during the national anthem before a chiefs game.

A love story rooted in stability and shared dreams





Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce’s whirlwind romance seems to be heading toward its next major chapter — marriage. According to insiders, the superstar couple has begun wedding preparations, with both stars reportedly “very involved” in planning every detail together. For fans who have followed their love story unfold from stadium sidelines to international headlines, this next step feels both inevitable and deeply personal.Sources told Us Weekly that Swift and Kelce are in full wedding-planning mode, with things “coming along” smoothly. “They are both [very] involved, and Taylor thinks it’s cute that Travis wants to help,” one insider shared, hinting that Kelce’s hands-on approach has only strengthened their bond.The pair are said to be eyeing a summer 2026 wedding, possibly in Rhode Island, where Swift owns her famous Watch Hill beach home. Rumors suggest the historic Vanderbilt estate, The Breakers, could host the ceremony, with June 13, 2026 (Swift’s lucky number date), being floated among fans as a likely choice.While the details remain tightly under wraps, it’s clear the couple doesn’t want to wait too long. “They don’t want a long engagement,” the insider revealed.“[They] very much want to start a family in the next year or so. Family means everything to them.”For Swift, the idea of home and family has long been woven into her songwriting and her new lyrics from “Wi$h Li$t” make that clearer than ever, “I just want you / Have a couple kids / Got the whole block looking like you / We tell the world to leave us the fuck alone...and they do / Wow / Got me dreaming ’bout a driveway / with a basketball hoop / Boss up, settle down.”In a candid chat with Zane Lowe on Apple Music 1, she opened up about how Kelce helped her reimagine her personal future. “When I met Travis, I started to feel a little bit like I could be a person who could have romantic whims and have these dreams,” she said.While Swift has scaled back her public appearances at Kelce’s games due to what insiders call “excessive attention,” she’s not retreating from love or ambition.

“He be trying to get under my skin”: Patriots rookie Christian Gonzalez shuts down Stefon Diggs ‘diva’ label,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/he-be-trying-to-get-under-my-skin-patriots-rookie-christian-gonzalez-shuts-down-stefon-diggs-diva-label/articleshow/124971369.cms,"(Image via Danielle Parhizkaran/Globe Staff/Boston.com)

Christian Gonzalez praises Stefon Diggs’ leadership and energy in practice

“He’s a real good leader,” Gonzalez said. “He cares a lot; he just be wanting to compete. He be trying to get up under my skin, tryna tell me certain things to get me going in practice… The media make him out to be a diva, but he ain’t been none of that.”

The “diva” narrative that’s followed Stefon Diggs for years

Looks like Stefon Diggs is flipping the script in New England. After years of being tagged as a “diva,” the veteran receiver is earning praise from one of the Patriots’ most promising young stars, cornerback Christian Gonzalez who says the media got it all wrong. In a recent interview, Gonzalez gave fans a peek at the real Diggs behind the scenes, calling him a leader, a motivator, and anything but the drama magnet people think he is.During a chat with NESN, Christian Gonzalez couldn’t have been clearer: Stefon Diggs isn’t the troublemaker the headlines make him out to be.It’s the kind of endorsement that means something coming from Gonzalez, a rising defensive star who lines up against Diggs every day in practice. For him to highlight Diggs’ competitive fire instead of conflict says plenty about how the veteran is fitting into his new environment.According to those around the team, Diggs’ voice has become one of the louder ones in the locker room in a good way. He’s been pushing the younger guys, setting the tempo, and making sure practices feel like game day.Diggs has had a complicated reputation. From his trade out of Minnesota to his public frustration during his final stretch with the Buffalo Bills, he’s been painted as overly emotional, difficult, and dramatic. Clips of sideline arguments and viral quotes didn’t help either.But Gonzalez’s words cut through all that noise. Instead of the so-called diva, he describes a version of Diggs who thrives on competition and pushes his teammates to get better. For the Patriots, that’s exactly the kind of fire they’ve been missing and maybe exactly what Diggs needed too.When Diggs landed in New England, critics questioned whether he’d mesh with the Patriots’ famously no-nonsense culture. But early signs suggest it’s working. Under head coach Jerod Mayo, the team’s tone has shifted- a little looser, a little more player-driven, and apparently a perfect fit for Diggs’ leadership style.Christian Gonzalez’s comments might just change how fans talk about Stefon Diggs this season. If the young corner’s words are anything to go by, Diggs isn’t the diva, he’s the standard-setter.Also read - Did Stefon Diggs get Crystal Westbrooks pregnant?

Malik Washington’s growing influence in Miami’s offense



Malik Washington’s path from reliability to breakout potential



Under the bright lights of Thursday Night Football, the Miami Dolphins find themselves facing one of their biggest challenges of the season — a ruthless Baltimore defense and sky-high expectations. Amid the star power of Tyreek Hill and Jaylen Waddle, a new name is quietly making waves: Malik Washington. The rookie wideout, once a sixth-round long shot, has been earning trust through precision and poise. Now, as Miami hunts for consistency in its playoff push, Washington’s understated brilliance might be the edge that changes everything.Since late September, Miami has been reshaping its offensive rhythm, redistributing targets to fill the gaps in a thinned receiver room. Malik Washington, a sixth-round pick in 2024, has quietly become a trusted piece in that puzzle. He’s recorded five or more targets in four consecutive games, including a career-high in looks two weeks ago and his first professional touchdown last weekend.The Dolphins’ coaching staff now trusts him on quick-game staples like sticks, speed-outs, and choice routes, as well as pre-snap motions that help diagnose coverage.On film, Washington consistently displays traits that separate him from typical rookies. As a zone beater, he finds soft spots within 6–10 yards. His yards-after-catch ability comes not from brute force but from sharp angles and balance, allowing him to finish plays forward and keep Miami ahead of schedule.Then there’s his timing with Tua Tagovailoa . The connection between the two has grown, with the quarterback delivering on anticipation throws and Washington winning early in his routes. Against a Baltimore defense that thrives on tight man coverage and match-zone concepts, that precision and timing will be critical. When the deep shots are limited, it’s Washington’s ability to win early and convert third downs that could keep drives alive.Washington entered the league known for his route discipline, toughness across the middle, and high-end college production. His early Miami journey—from practice squad duties to carving out a role in the rotation—speaks to how much the Dolphins value reliability and timing over raw athleticism. The next steps in his development are clear: beating press coverage more consistently, layering routes for deeper gains, and perfecting his blocking angles to remain a fixture in all formations.In a league obsessed with highlight plays, Malik Washington is earning his place through the subtler details—clean routes, precise spacing, and dependable hands. Against Baltimore, those traits could quietly tilt the game Miami’s way. If the Dolphins succeed by moving the chains through rhythm and efficiency rather than pure explosiveness, Washington might just be the unsung difference-maker everyone notices by the final whistle.Also Read: Isiah Pacheco’s family life: Meet his siblings Travoise, Ricky, Felicia, and Celeste who shaped his journey","Malik washington, a sixth-round pick in 2024, has quietly become a trusted piece in the miami dolphins' offensive puzzle.

Oklahoma City Thunder are maintaining their winning streak



Right before the regular season began, it was revealed that Nikola Topic had his team option exercised for the 2025-26 season. As such, he has missed all games this season, which was until now, because of a groin injury. On October 6, he had a testicular procedure done, and was set to be reevaluated 4-6 weeks after that, according to the now. Now, Oklahoma City Thunder General Manager Sam Presti revealed on October 30 that the 20-year-old had been diagnosed with testicular cancer and has already begun chemotherapy treatment.Nikola Topic had a procedure done on October 6 after his testicular cancer diagnosis and has already started chemotherapy treatment. The Oklahoma City Thunder star is only 20 years old and was drafted by the team back in 2024 as the 12th overall pick. Unfortunately, game time will have to take a back seat for now with his condition. General Manager Sam Presti, announcing his prognosis, said:""Our only expectations for him are to focus on this. This is his most important priority. He'll be back playing basketball when he's able to, but we're not putting any time length or expectations on that, obviously. He has our total support, encouragement, and love.""The Serbian star is already working out while on chemotherapy, and his doctors are ""extremely positive"" about his condition. He played the 2024-25 season, and in his debut season, he became a champion with the OKC Thunder. He had also missed a chunk of the previous season while recovering from a torn ACL injury.But as Presti has assured him, the focus is on his getting better before anything else.While Nikola Topic will miss out on game time for the foreseeable future, his team, the Oklahoma City Thunder, is doing extremely well. Similar to last season, where they had a record number of wins in the regular season, this time, they are also maintaining the same thing. They are currently on a 5-0 run, having won all their games since the beginning of the season.The Thunder will face the East's Washington Wizards next, who are not having the best of times so far. But unlike the Thunder, who have multiple injuries at hand, they have a pretty solid roster.

When is Chet Holmgren Expected to Recover From His Ongoing Injury?

In that game, the young big man delivered an impressive performance, putting up 18 points, 11 rebounds, and shooting an efficient 60% from the field. Following the win, he was held out of the second game of the Thunder’s back-to-back against the Sacramento Kings to recover.Despite Holmgren’s absence, the Thunder secured a 107-101 win over Sacramento, demonstrating their depth and adaptability. However, the matchup against the Wizards will mark the second consecutive game that Holmgren misses due to the lingering soreness.Even without Chet Holmgren, Oklahoma City has continued its remarkable start to the 2025–26 NBA season, entering the contest with a perfect 5-0 record. The team’s success has been fueled by outstanding performances from Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and rookie guard Ajay Mitchell, who have stepped up to maintain the Thunder’s momentum on both ends of the floor.Holmgren’s absence will be felt, as he has been off to one of the best starts of his young career. Through five games this season, he has averaged 23 points, 10 rebounds, and approximately 2.6 combined steals and blocks per game. His growth as a two-way player has been a major storyline for the Thunder, showing maturity and confidence since returning from a hip injury that kept him sidelined for much of the previous season.In Chet Holmgren’s absence, the Thunder are expected to continue leaning into a small-ball strategy. Isaiah Hartenstein will take on more frontcourt responsibilities, while the team will emphasize perimeter shooting and transition play to maintain its offensive rhythm.While Holmgren’s lower back issue is being closely monitored, the Thunder are optimistic it is only a minor setback and unrelated to his past injuries. The team is hopeful that he could make his return as early as November 2, when Oklahoma City faces the New Orleans Pelicans.The Thunder are dealing with several other injuries besides Holmgren’s. Jalen Williams and Isaiah Joe remain sidelined, but there’s a positive update as veteran guard Alex Caruso has cleared concussion protocols and is set to return to the rotation.Their upcoming opponent, the Washington Wizards, has struggled to find consistency early in the season. This game presents an opportunity for Oklahoma City to test its depth once again, as the team aims to remain unbeaten even without its key interior presence.Chet Holmgren’s back soreness comes at a time when he has been delivering dominant performances and establishing himself as a cornerstone for the Thunder’s future. While fans are disappointed to see his explosive start paused, the organization is prioritizing long-term health and ensuring that the young center returns only when fully recovered.Also read: Is LaMelo Ball playing tonight vs the Orlando Magic?

LaMelo Ball gets $35k fine after game against Miami Heat



Charlotte Hornets have gone the middle way

The last match between the Charlotte Hornets and the Miami Heat on October 28, saw the latter win the game 144 to 117. It also saw Hornets star LaMelo Ball showing his middle finger to the referee after getting called for a foul. The ""obscene gesture"" was made during the final few minutes of the game, and the player's frustration with his team's performance and getting called for a foul led to him flipping the referee. And now, he has been fined a pretty good amount.In the last few minutes of the game between the Charlotte Hornets and the Miami Heat, the visiting team somewhat knew the game was gone from their hands. In their frustration, LaMelo Ball accidentally kicked the ball at Heat star Davion Mitchell's face. He got called for an offensive foul and received a technical foul for his actions.Adding to an already frustrating result, getting a foul was not the best combination - and Ball ended up flipping the referee off. Now, the league has put a fine of $35,000 on him, which he will have to pay. He scored 20 points during the game, best from the Hornets, but with Bam Abadeyo and Aaron Wiggins leading the Heat with 26 and 21 points respectively, they had no chance.Not the best start to their 2025-26 season, but this is also not the worst for them, as the Charlotte Hornets go into their match-up against the Orlando Magic tonight on a 2-2 run. LaMelo Ball is their star player, averaging 21.1 points since joining the league back in 2020. He won the NBA Rookie of the Year award in 2021 and was named an NBA All-Star in 2022.But injury spells have let him out of the court for long portions, and his career has not been able to have the lift he had hoped for, especially after such a successful rookie season. Hopefully, things can turn around for him as well as the Hornets as they make a slow but steady turn to their season.Also Read: Will Chet Holmgren play tonight?

A fan tweet questions Taylor Swift’s activism era shift

“Well, ask Taylor Swift. When she was with Joe, she was an activist and preaching about being on the right side of history. After Joe Alwyn? Crashing out on 2 albums about racist Matty and now? Hanging out with MAGAs and SA apologists.”

Taylor Swift’s outspoken activist era set a precedent

Why fans are now questioning her current associations

“Taylor ‘crashed’ history by breaking records no one else dared touch: 14 Grammys, $1B tour, record-breaking album sales, and activism that actually moves the needle. But sure, keep explaining how she ‘crashed’ from behind your keyboard!”

Taylor Swift’s fandom is once again at war with itself this time not over setlists or surprise songs, but over her supposed “political glow-down.” A viral post on X called out the singer for allegedly drifting away from the activist persona she embraced during her Joe Alwyn era, when she proudly spoke about being “on the right side of history.” The comment quickly spread, with fans split down the middle, some claiming Taylor’s gone soft on social issues, others insisting she doesn’t owe anyone a political performance.The tweet that lit up SwiftTok and X timelines didn’t hold back:The post snowballed into a larger online debate about whether Taylor has “changed” her activism stance or whether fans are just reading too much into her relationships.Back in 2018–2020, Taylor Swift publicly stepped into the political arena after years of silence. In herdocumentary, she tearfully discussed the importance of using her platform responsibly and endorsed Democratic candidates in Tennessee. She even shared voter registration links, which led to aspike of over 65,000 new sign-ups in a single day.That period became known as her “activist era,” and it reshaped her image, from America’s sweetheart to a bold, politically conscious artist. Fans admired her courage, and for many, that version of Taylor became symbolic of growth, maturity, and empowerment.The criticism mainly stems from Taylor’s current relationship and friendships post Joe Alwyn. Fans say she’s “hanging out with MAGA types” or people accused of enabling problematic behavior ( Patrick Mahomes , Brittany Mahomes).Not everyone’s buying the criticism. Many fans argue that Taylor has already done her part as an activist, registering voters, speaking up for LGBTQ+ rights, and advocating for artists’ ownership.For them, silence isn’t regression, it’s just a choice to keep her personal life separate from public discourse.Also read - Michael Strahan gets emotional celebrating his twin daughters’ 21st birthday after cancer fight","Taylor swift’s fandom is at war with itself over her supposed “political glow-down.” a viral post on x called out the singer for allegedly drifting away from the activist persona she embraced during her joe alwyn era.

The San Antonio Spurs' season-opening night was fantastic. Like most things, it revolved around Victor Wembanyama. He was outstanding in a 40-point performance that helped the Dallas Mavericks lose handily. However, due to serious injury concerns, the Miami Heat and the San Antonio Spurs will now play each other very cautiously on Thursday at Frost Bank Centre. Unfortunately, De'Aaron Fox will not be participating.Both the Miami Heat and the San Antonio Spurs have serious injury worries. Tyler Herro will not be playing for Miami due to a left ankle injury that will require surgery. Then due to a right groin strain, rookie Kasparas Jakucionis is also sidelined, and Norman Powell is labelled as doubtful. Terry Rozier is on unpaid leave due to a federal gambling investigation, and Nikola Jovic is still questionable due to a right hip injury. Meanwhile, De'Aaron Fox isn't playing for the Spurs.Fox is sidelined due to an injury. He suffered a hamstring injury during training camp, which he is currently recovering from. Dylan Harper, the No. 2 overall pick, and Stephon Castle saw much more playing time in the backcourt when Fox was benched. Additionally, it also gave Devin Vassell additional minutes.Due to the injury, De'Aaron Fox has missed the first four games . Before Spurs head coach Mitch Johnson reminded everyone that it's just October.He further implied that the team is probably going to take a cautious approach with Fox.The Spurs have not provided a clear schedule for Fox's comeback. It can take some time for a quick point guard like Fox to recover fully from a torn right hamstring. The Spurs will have to continue without Fox for the time being. Stephon Castle will probably continue to play point guard for the Spurs.The Spurs have had a fantastic start to the season, winning their first three games and defeating the Brooklyn Nets on Sunday. Victor Wembanyama led the team to win on Sunday, finishing with 31 points, 14 rebounds, and six blocks. Rookie Dylan Harper contributed 20 points, six rebounds, and eight assists off the bench.They will now take on the Raptors in an attempt to maintain their winning streak. On the other hand, De'Aaron Fox and Luke Kornet are among the five players on the Spurs' injury report. Due to a hamstring strain that has forced him out of San Antonio's opening three games of the season, Fox will not play for the time being.Also read: Is Cam Thomas playing?

What to Watch for in Tonight's Cleveland Cavaliers vs Boston Celtics Matchup?

Theare set to clash in a high-stakes regular-season showdown on October 29, 2025, at TD Garden in Boston. Both Eastern Conference contenders are dealing with crucial injuries that could heavily influence the outcome of this early-season matchup. Cleveland Cavaliers enter the contest with several key players sidelined. Star point guard Darius Garland remains unavailable as he continues to recover from surgery on his left great toe. Shooting guard Max Strus is also out of action, still rehabilitating from a Jones fracture in his left foot that required surgical repair. Adding to the Cavaliers’ injury woes, Sam Merrill has been ruled out after sustaining a right hip contusion in a collision with teammate Evan Mobley.These absences have forced head coach J.B. Bickerstaff to rely more heavily on his bench and recent addition Lonzo Ball, who has stepped into Garland’s role at point guard. Despite their injury setbacks, the Cavaliers have impressed early in the season, holding a 3-1 record and riding a three-game winning streak. Their ability to remain competitive without key starters underscores the team’s growing depth and resilience.The Boston Celtics , too, are managing their share of health concerns. Franchise cornerstone Jayson Tatum remains sidelined after undergoing surgery to repair his right Achilles and is not expected to return until he’s fully cleared by medical staff. Meanwhile, Jaylen Brown is listed as “probable” as he continues to manage a left hamstring strain that has nagged him since opening night. Though limited, Brown has continued to suit up in every game so far, demonstrating grit and consistency - including his solid 15-point, 7-rebound showing in the team’s 122-90 season-opening victory over the New Orleans Pelicans.Boston Celtics’ depth will be tested again, as players like Derrick White, Jrue Holiday, and Kristaps Porziņģis will be expected to shoulder additional scoring and defensive duties in Tatum’s absence. The Celtics currently sit at 1-3 and are looking to build momentum with a statement win at home.The injuries on both sides set the stage for an intriguing battle centered around adaptability and depth. The Cavaliers, buoyed by their strong start and improved chemistry, will look to continue their winning run on the road. With Lonzo Ball orchestrating the offense alongside a healthy frontcourt featuring Evan Mobley and Jarrett Allen, Cleveland has the tools to pose a serious challenge to the Celtics.Boston, on the other hand, will rely heavily on Brown’s presence and the team’s collective effort to make up for Tatum’s scoring void. Head coach Joe Mazzulla will need to deploy creative rotations and balanced scoring to counter Cleveland’s size and physical play inside the paint.• Lonzo Ball’s performance as the primary playmaker in Garland’s absence.• Jaylen Brown’s agility and offensive rhythm as he continues to recover from a hamstring strain.• The Celtics’ secondary scorers and their ability to step up without Tatum.• The interior matchup between Evan Mobley, Jarrett Allen, and Boston’s frontcourt rotation.The October 29 meeting between the Cleveland Cavaliers and Boston Celtics promises to be a compelling contest defined by strategy, resilience, and adaptability. Both teams are navigating early-season adversity, but their depth and competitiveness should ensure an exciting night for fans at TD Garden.While injuries have reshaped both lineups, the clash serves as a testament to the physical demands of the NBA and the determination of two Eastern Conference powerhouses striving to stay in contention. Expect an intense and tactical battle as both sides look to prove their mettle early in the 2025-26 campaign.","Cleveland cavaliers and boston celtics set to clash in a regular-season showdown on october 29, 2025, at td garden in boston.

Dallas Cowboys’ defense cannot stop a bloody nose

Fans react to NBA and NFL crossover with mentions of Skip Bayless and Stephen A. Smith

Also Read:

Two weeks into ESPN’s “Inside The NBA” show, after transitioning from TNT Sports, the crew–Ernie Johnson Jr., Charles Barkley , Shaquille O’Neal, and Kenny Smith–couldn’t prevent themselves from talking about another league: the National Football League, everyone. From a subtle jab at Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones to criticizing the NFL ’s worst-ranked defense, the crew knew where it would supposedly hurt the most.American sportscaster Ernie Johnson Jr. shared that it had been two weeks into ESPN’s “Inside The NBA” show, and they had not mentioned the Dallas Cowboys: “This is our second week on ESPN, and we still haven’t talked about the Cowboys.” Johnson Jr. said. “Isn’t that amazing?”The 11-time NBA All-Star Charles Barkley then added that they had a contractual obligation to talk about the Cowboys every day—even when their defense couldn't stop any opponent. Well, you know, they have a contractually obligated to talk about the Cowboys every day,” Barkley said. “Even though their defense can’t stop a bloody nose.”Shaquille O’Neal further jabbed at the Cowboys, saying, “That’s the Cowboys team. They are off the Cowboys.” Barkley interrupted O’Neal, screaming, “Stop people from scoring! Don’t trade your best defensive player and then whine about you can’t stop anybody!” —subtly hinting at former Dallas Cowboys defensive end Micah Parsons, who was traded to the Green Bay Packers before the 2025 season began.And now the Cowboys’ defense ranks last in the NFL, a significant change after Parsons’ trade.One fan was very happy about the crossover, writing, “Who let the cowboys sneak into the nba convo tonight 😂🔥.” Another fan mentioned Skip Bayless, a formerly devoted Dallas Cowboys fan who is now a Philadelphia Eagles fan: “Skip hasn't been at ESPN in nearly 10 years and his influence still reigns.” A third user called it an ideal crossover, saying, “Classic, nothing gets more reactions than talking Cowboys on Inside The NBA. Fans either cheer, cringe, or start a full-blown debate in the comments instantly. 😂.” Another mentioned Stephen A. Smith: “ESPN and the Cowboys. Shoutout to Stephen A. Smith. 😂.”","Charles barkley, shaquille o’neal and ernie johnson jr. were talking about the dallas cowboys on espn’s “inside the nba’ show.
