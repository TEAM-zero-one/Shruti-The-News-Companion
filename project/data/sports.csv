Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce may look like the ultimate power couple, but one astrologer believes their stars are far from aligned. While the world buzzes with speculation about a possible engagement, especially after the couple’s loved-up Fourth of July getaway, a bold new prediction suggests their story may end in heartbreak.Travis Kelce, the Kansas City Chiefs tight end, and Taylor Swift, the global pop icon, have been inseparable since going public with their romance in September 2023. From Swift cheering at NFL games to Kelce flying across continents to catch her Eras Tour, the pair have shown unwavering support for one another.Fans have even speculated that a secret proposal may have already happened. However, reports from outlets like People and Entertainment Tonight suggest they are waiting until Kelce finishes what could be his final NFL season.Amid all the romantic speculation, astrologer Mark Du Boise has thrown cold water on the fairytale. Calling himself the “world’s best” astrologer, Du Boise analyzed their birth charts and concluded that their cosmic chemistry is off.“Taylor’s troubled. She’s a sun-moon quincunx. It’s hard astrology. I don’t think anyone is going to last with her,” Du Boise claimed, suggesting that Swift’s Sagittarius sun and Cancer moon create inner tension between her adventurous nature and emotional needs.Meanwhile, Kelce’s Libra sun and Sagittarius moon make him charming and balanced, but potentially hesitant to commit deeply. According to Du Boise, the two signs together create a disconnect that could spell doom for long-term happiness.Despite the celestial warning, fans see no trouble in paradise.

Potential Deal Breakdown

Warriors Receive Raptors Lose Chris Boucher (1 yr, $3M)



Veteran stretch big, 2-time NBA champion





With the bulk of major NBA free agency moves already in the rearview, thehave kept things relatively lowkey—until now. A new prediction has added a twist to their offseason narrative, linking them to a familiar name who could bring both experience and tactical value to their frontcourt.Veteran big man Chris Boucher, currently with the Toronto Raptors, is being floated as a potential target for Golden State in free agency. The 32-year-old, who once spent time developing with the Warriors’ G League affiliate in Santa Cruz, could be on track for a Bay Area return in what might be a low-cost, high-upside move.According to Ricky O’Donnell of SBNation, the prediction sees Boucher signing a one-year deal worth $3 million—a price tag that fits Golden State’s financial strategy and fills a roster gap with a versatile stretch big.Ricky O’Donnell of SBNation recently released his NBA free agency predictions for 12 best available players on the 2025 market, and one of the standout projections involves the Golden State Warriors bringing back former Santa Cruz Warrior Chris Boucher.“Boucher is still a solid bench big at 32 years old… The Warriors need more stretch bigs, and Boucher would fit well there,” O’Donnell wrote.According to the prediction, Boucher would sign a one-year deal worth $3 million, potentially leaving the Toronto Raptors, the only NBA team he’s consistently played for.Though undrafted, Boucher carved a space for himself in the league, and his early stint with the Warriors—albeit brief—makes him no stranger to Golden State’s culture and system.At 32, Boucher remains a valuable bench piece with a skillset that aligns with what the Warriors are missing—particularly in their need for a stretch big who can also defend. He shot 36.3% from three-point range last season, offering valuable floor spacing for a team that thrives on movement and shooting.- Three-point Shooting: Reliable from deep, shooting 36.3% in 2024-25- Defensive Upside: Still provides shot-blocking despite some decline- Length & Switchability: Fits well with Warriors’ defensive schemes- Winning Mentality: Two-time NBA champion, including one title with WarriorsWhile Boucher’s contributions to Golden State’s 2018 title run were minimal, his experience in championship environments could prove beneficial in the locker room and during high-stakes playoff moments.The Golden State Warriors are in a transitional phase, looking to retool around Stephen Curry while maintaining financial flexibility. Bringing in a veteran like Boucher on a low-risk, short-term deal aligns with both their tactical needs and cap strategy.He also fits the mold of players the Golden State Warriors have historically valued—versatile, long, and capable of playing within a system without demanding touches.As free agency continues to unfold, this predicted reunion could be a savvy, under-the-radar move for the Golden State Warriors. It won’t shake up the league, but it could solidify an area of weakness while adding experience and defensive versatility.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Los Angeles Lakers reportedly eyeing $33,075,000 Portland Trail Blazers star to bolster perimeter defense and improve title odds If the front office moves forward with this deal, fans may once again see Chris Boucher don the Golden State jersey—this time as a more seasoned and polished contributor ready to help in a meaningful way.","Golden state warriors linked to veteran big man chris boucher in new prediction.

The Summer League has just started. Amid the NBA offseason, fans are now tuning into the Summer League game opener, especially for Bronny James and Cooper Flagg. The Los Angeles Lakers star was seen defending the ball against Mavericks’ rookie Flagg, and there was a foul call from the referee. As the clip of the defensive moment appeared online, fans rushed to social media to share their thoughts on the matter.Bronny James has cleared his rookie year with the Los Angeles Lakers, and Cooper Flagg has just landed with the Dallas Mavericks. The future superstars of the league have clashed at the Summer League opener. While Bronny was defending Flagg, he was called for a foul. While he shrugged off the moment with a laugh of surprise, as it appeared a clear steal (and many fans believe), the moment carried some intense reaction with it.“Bronny clamped that. Ain't no foul,” @PerSources reacted on X.One Lakers fan (LukaGoat🐐) slammed Flagg, “bro can’t even take Bronny n mavs fans think he better than Luka 😂😂😂😂”“That wasn’t no foul lol,” @Rashee_longway shared.“Ain’t no foul 😂” @woods7x reacted.Cooper Flagg officially kicked off his NBA journey on Thursday, suiting up for the Dallas Mavericks in their Las Vegas Summer League opener against the Los Angeles Lakers.This marked his first appearance in a Mavericks uniform since being selected No. 1 overall in the 2025 NBA Draft. The pressure was high, with fans eager to see if Flagg could step into the spotlight and help turn around the franchise’s future.The Mavericks drafted Flagg just weeks after trading away former star Luka Doncic to the Lakers. That move added even more weight to Flagg's debut, as many see him as the centerpiece of Dallas' rebuild. Every possession was under the microscope, especially with the Lakers on the other side of the court.Flagg, fresh off a strong freshman season at Duke, looked confident early. He scored six points in the opening quarter on 3-of-9 shooting. While he showed flashes of potential, the Lakers defense—led by a hungry Summer League unit—kept him in check. He grabbed just one rebound, with no assists and two early fouls in just under 10 minutes on the court.Also Read: NBA Free Agency Rumors: Golden State Warriors predicted to land $35,250,000 Toronto Raptors star to Support Stephen Curry in title run The game was tight heading into halftime, with the Lakers taking a narrow 47-43 lead.

Strong finishes from Darius Bazley, Dalton Knecht, and Scotty Pippen Jr. helped the Lakers edge ahead as the half closed.

Jerome Bettis questions Steelers' identity shift away from run-first football

Jerome Bettis on the Dan Patrick Show Full Interview | 07/10/25

Clash of philosophies between Aaron Rodgers and Arthur Smith looms large



The Pittsburgh Steelers may have made headlines this offseason by landing Aaron Rodgers and DK Metcalf, but not everyone’s convinced the glitzy moves align with the team’s traditional DNA. In fact, Hall of Famer Jerome Bettis is ringing the alarm bells—and Rodgers might be silently agreeing.Aaron Rodgers signed with Pittsburgh for what could be his final NFL season, bringing a Hall of Fame résumé and a clear philosophy: he thrives in a controlled, efficient, pass-first offense. But that clashes with what offensive coordinator Arthur Smith has planned—a ground-heavy, tight end–centric scheme that echoes old-school football more than Rodgers’ up-tempo style.Bettis, appearing on The Dan Patrick Show, didn’t hold back. When Patrick asked about the departure of running back Najee Harris and whether Rodgers changes the team’s approach, Bettis was clear: “They’re going to run the football. They drafted [a] young kid from Iowa who’s really, really good running back.”He emphasized that even with Rodgers and Metcalf on board, abandoning the run game would be a fundamental mistake. “If you ask Aaron Rodgers to throw the ball 40 times, that’s a mistake,” Bettis warned.His logic? At 41, Rodgers shouldn’t be scrambling or absorbing unnecessary hits. The offense should play through the run to maximize play-action and control tempo.The tension deepens when you examine Arthur Smith’s history. Known for heavy run schemes, multiple tight end sets, and complex pre-snap motion, Smith’s system is almost the antithesis of what Rodgers prefers. The quarterback’s track record thrives in motion-light, single-tight-end, pass-heavy playbooks—a setup far from what Pittsburgh appears to be building.Even Bettis acknowledged this delicate balance: “He’s moving. He’s getting the ball out. He’s, you know, quick in the huddle, out of the huddle, running.” That doesn’t mesh easily with Smith’s grind-it-out game plans.Beyond the philosophical divide, practical concerns remain. Pittsburgh’s backfield, featuring rookie Kaleb Johnson and Jaylen Warren, is unproven. Meanwhile, the offensive line—an Achilles’ heel for Rodgers in New York—must protect its aging quarterback or risk an early collapse.Also Read: What we learned about Joe Burrow’s mindset, swagger and quirky side from Netflix’s 'Quarterback’ The Steelers’ attempt to fuse new-school talent with old-school identity could either produce fireworks—or a full-blown identity crisis.
