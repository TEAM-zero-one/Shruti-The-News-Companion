Bruins insiders make bold Stanley Cup prediction if Connor McDavid lands in Boston

Should Bruins TRADE Pavel Zacha? | Bruins Beat

Connor McDavid’s uncertain future has the entire NHL holding its breath

As NHL free agency and trade talks ramp up, one name continues to dominate every rumor mill—Connor McDavid. With his contract situation still unresolved in Edmonton, speculation is heating up across the league. Among the teams linked to the Oilers captain, the Boston Bruins have now entered the conversation—and some local media believe a potential McDavid deal could change everything.During the August 1 episode of Bruins Beat, reporters Evan Marinofsky and Conor Ryan briefly entertained the fantasy of Connor McDavid wearing a black and gold jersey. Marinofsky tossed out the question, “What if McDavid ended up with the Bruins?” Ryan’s response was immediate and emphatic: “I mean, they’d win a cup. They would, yeah.”That may sound like a stretch—but Ryan doubled down. Calling McDavid “the easiest cheat code,” he drew a parallel to another generational athlete: “I think McDavid is so dominant now that he’s kind of like LeBron during his prime, right? Where, like just him alone, you’re going to be in the third round if not in the final.”Ryan also acknowledged the financial weight that a McDavid contract would carry—likely in the ballpark of $15.5 to $16 million per year, a new NHL record.Yet he argued that even at that cost, McDavid would be worth every penny.After another playoff letdown for the Oilers in June, Connor McDavid’s long-term commitment to Edmonton has come under question. The 2024 Conn Smythe winner has recorded at least 90 points in all nine of his NHL seasons—yet remains without a Stanley Cup. His contract talks have reportedly stalled, and the league is taking notice.Connor McDavid made his priorities clear in a recent interview: “Winning is the most important thing… If I feel there’s a good window to win here over and over again, then signing is no problem.” That statement leaves the door open for other franchises—like the Bruins—to make their pitch. Whether Boston is a serious contender or just a fan-fueled fantasy, one thing is certain: until McDavid re-signs, the NHL rumor machine won’t slow down.Also Read: Connor McDavid to the Maple Leafs? Rumors swirl as NHL insider insists it’s Toronto or nowhere The Oilers are expected to have $45 million in open contract space next offseason, so there won't be much excuse for not giving McDavid something between $16-20 million per year.Connor McDavid is one of only two players – after fellow Oilers captain Wayne Gretzky in 1982 – to unanimously win the Hart Memorial Trophy as the league's most valuable player.","Insiders call connor mcdavid a “stanley cup cheat code” (imagn images) conor ryan: “i mean, they’d win a cup.

Trinity Rodman earns heartfelt praise from Lakers legend Magic Johnson

Trinity explained her relationship with her father, Dennis Rodman

Trinity Rodman made headlines once again as the Washington Spirit forward delivered a stunning game-winning goal against the Portland Thorns, marking her return from injury in spectacular style. The moment was enough to electrify the crowd. He stunning performance also earned a public message of praise from Los Angeles Lakers legend and part-owner of the Spirit, Magic Johnson.On a thrilling evening in D.C., Rodman reminded fans why she’s a generational talent. With just minutes left on the clock, she buried a decisive goal to give the Washington Spirit a 2–1 victory. For Trinity, it was a storybook return after injury kept her sidelined for weeks.Magic Johnson, who is part of the Spirit’s ownership group, didn’t hold back his excitement on X.He wrote, “Welcome back superstar Trinity Rodman! Congratulations on scoring the game winning goal for our Washington Spirit in a 2-1 victory over the Portland Thorns. The entire National Women’s Soccer League (NWSL) has missed you!”It wasn’t the first time Johnson praised the young forward, but this moment carried added emotion.After all, Rodman’s prowess in the game has become as much a part of her identity as her footwork and finishing.In an emotionally raw interview earlier this year on Call Her Daddy, she opened up about her strained relationship with her father, NBA Hall of Famer Dennis Rodman. ""My dad, he likes to be in control. So he would take us shopping, get us phones, do this, do that. 'Oh, I'm going to take you and your brother shopping,' and me and my brother are like, 'We don't want to go shopping, we just want money to go get In-N-Out after school with our friends,"" Trinity said.""So it was like, he wouldn't give us money to do that. He needed to have the control of bringing us shopping and swiping his own card. But if we asked, 'Hey, could we have $100 to go get food, to go to Claire's to get my ears pierced,' just little stuff like that? He was like, 'No. You're using me.'""“He’s not a dad,” Trinity continued. “Maybe by blood, but nothing else. Hearing his voice is painful.”She described a childhood marked by instability, often living in a car with her mother, while her father’s absence left emotional gaps. Even when Dennis Rodman showed up — like when he surprised her at her NWSL debut — the gestures felt more about control or spectacle than support.“I answer the phone now for my conscience,” she added, “to be like, he needed to hear my voice before anything else happens.”Also Read: Indiana Pacers star Tyrese Haliburton attends WWE SummerSlam in style amid his Achilles injury Despite the emotional weight she carries, Trinity Rodman continues to shine on her own terms.

Christian McCaffrey hails wife Olivia Culpo as ‘real MVP’ in touching tribute after birth of their daughter



Olivia Culpo’s tough pregnancy journey reveals deeper layers of love



Amidst the rigors of NFL training camp, Christian McCaffrey is finding inspiration far beyond the gridiron. The San Francisco 49ers running back recently opened up about life as a new dad and offered a touching tribute to his wife, Olivia Culpo , following the arrival of their daughter, Colette Annalise McCaffrey, born on July 13. While McCaffrey may be battling defensive lines, at home, he says it’s Culpo who’s doing the heavy lifting.As Christian McCaffrey returns to training camp, he gave fans a glimpse into his journey through early fatherhood and his admiration for Culpo’s resilience. “She’s been great. She’s been so cool… I feel guilty at times,” McCaffrey admitted. “I’m sleeping well in the hotel bedroom while she’s doing the dirty work, but super thankful for it—and she’s doing an incredible job.”While he trains with the 49ers, Culpo remains home caring for their newborn, supported by both families who’ve stepped in to help the first-time parents. Their joint announcement on social media revealed the birth of Colette, accompanied by intimate photos—one especially moving image captured McCaffrey holding Culpo’s hand during her C-section, a moment that echoed their unwavering bond.Culpo, 33, hasn’t held back her appreciation either.In a heartwarming Instagram story, she called McCaffrey the “best daddy in the world,” adding, “We’re going to miss him so much,” along with a crying emoji, as he headed off to camp.Though the couple now celebrates their growing family, the road wasn’t easy. Culpo had been candid about her physically taxing pregnancy. Back in March, she shared on TikTok that she had battled pneumonia and remained on bed rest for nearly a month. Her condition worsened when she was diagnosed with a subchorionic hematoma—a bleeding complication that can pose risks during early pregnancy.“So at this point, I was so exhausted… two weeks of just not being able to move and then all of a sudden just purging,” she said. “It was a lot. It was heavy… I went to the doctor and it was really exciting to see that there was still a heartbeat.”Through all the exhaustion, fear, and joy, McCaffrey and Culpo have emerged as a team—weathering challenges with grace. While McCaffrey may be chasing another Super Bowl, it’s clear who he believes is the real MVP at home.Also Read: Are wedding bells next?

Is It Worth the Risk?

Theare no strangers to making bold veteran signings in pursuit of another championship. With Stephen Curry still performing at an elite level, every roster move matters - and while much of the talk this offseason has revolved around Boston’s Al Horford, there’s another name that could quietly fit the bill. Former Milwaukee Bucks star and NBA champion Khris Middleton, though past his peak, might be exactly the kind of experienced, playoff-tested player the Warriors need to stabilize their wing depth and boost their scoring options.Blue Man Hoop's G. C. Bellchamber pointed out Khris Middleton’s unexpected departure from Milwaukee, saying, “After parts of 11 seasons with the Milwaukee Bucks , Middleton was shockingly dealt to the (Washington) Wizards in the middle of last season as a result of the Bucks’ tenuous cap situation.” (H/t: Sporting News)While his exit was abrupt, Middleton showed he could still contribute in Washington.Now entering the final year of a three-year, $93 million extension signed with Milwaukee, Middleton could soon be a buyout candidate. Washington’s decision to focus on its younger core - parting ways with other veterans like Marcus Smart - only strengthens that possibility.If available, Middleton could be a valuable addition to the Golden State Warriors ’ rotation. His experience and composure would help stabilize the team’s wing depth, particularly around young forward Moses Moody.• Veteran leadership for a team still aiming for a title run• Proven playoff performer with championship experience• Capable of being a reliable third or fourth scoring option• Defensive versatility at 6-foot-7• Ability to play alongside elite talent without disrupting chemistryMiddleton thrived as Giannis Antetokounmpo’s right-hand man during the Bucks’ championship run. His playoff numbers in 2021 reflect his impact:His steady scoring and clutch performances were vital in helping Milwaukee secure the title.At 33, Middleton’s athleticism and production have dipped, but his skill set and experience remain valuable. For the Golden State Warriors, who are still in win-now mode with Curry leading the charge, the move could be a low-cost way to strengthen their roster for a playoff push.Also read: Boston Celtics Weigh Trade Options and Roster Adjustments Ahead of 2025-26 Season The decision will ultimately come down to whether Golden State sees Middleton as a short-term spark or chooses to keep its current core intact.",Khris middleton could be a buyout candidate for the golden state warriors.

San Antonio Spurs’ Perspective

Theappear to be fully invested in building around Luka Doncic , signaling a significant shift in the franchise’s priorities. According to recent reports, the team is no longer tailoring its plans around. While relations between LeBron and the Lakers are calm for now, the possibility of a trade request remains in the background.LeBron’s large contract and no-trade clause make moving him a complicated process, but that hasn’t stopped trade scenarios from circulating. One of the more intriguing proposals comes from Bleacher Report’s Andy Bailey, who has outlined a deal that would send both LeBron and his son, Bronny James, to a Western Conference rival.Bailey’s hypothetical trade involves the San Antonio Spurs acquiring the father-son duo in exchange for two young scorers and future draft considerations.Pick swaps acquired by the Spurs from Sacramento in the DeMar DeRozan trade.While fans might expect a superstar return for LeBron James , this package offers a different kind of value.Key Benefits for the Los Angeles Lakers • Two reliable young scorers: Both Devin Vassell and Keldon Johnson have proven they can average close to 20 points per game.• Versatile skillsets: Neither is expected to become a franchise star, but both can contribute in multiple roles on a contending team.• Support for Luka Doncic: Role players who can defend and score efficiently are crucial in the Lakers’ new era.• Future flexibility: The draft pick swaps give the team additional assets without locking them into expensive veteran contracts.As Bailey notes, “This might not be the type of LeBron trade return that some Lakers are hoping for, [but] getting an aging superstar off the team for two solid players and draft capital might be the Los Angeles Lakers’ best option moving forward.”Also read: New York Knicks Reportedly Keeping a Close Watch on Giannis Antetokounmpo’s Situation in the Milwaukee Bucks For the Spurs, the move would bring in a global icon in LeBron James, boosting both on-court performance and marketability.

George Kittle ‘distraught’ over NFL’s new smelling salt ban



The science and safety behind the NFL’s sudden move



George Kittle has never been one to shy away from making a scene - especially when it’s both hilarious and heartfelt. During a light-hearted yet surprising interruption at 49ers training camp, the San Francisco 49ers tight end made headlines after jokingly announcing he was “distraught” and even “considered retirement. ” The reason? A brand-new NFL policy that has banned smelling salts and ammonia packets from all league play starting in 2025.The impromptu moment unfolded when Kittle stormed the NFL Network set mid-interview, grabbing the mic while teammate Fred Warner was speaking. “I honestly just came up here to air a grievance,” he said, prompting laughter from those around. “Our team got a memo today that smelling salts and ammonia packets were made illegal in the NFL, and I've been distraught all day.” He then tossed in a cheeky bombshell: “I considered retirement. ”While clearly joking, Kittle wasn’t exaggerating his personal attachment to the now-banned item. “I'm an every-drive guy,” he emphasized, explaining that he uses smelling salts as part of his regular pre-snap ritual. “I miss them already,” he confessed, before quickly drawing a line at overuse: “Every play is too much.”The ban, however, is anything but a joke to the league.According to NFL Network’s Mike Garafolo, the memo referenced a 2024 alert from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which cited growing concerns over the unregulated use of ammonia inhalants (AIs) — the broader category including smelling salts. The NFL’s head, neck, and spine committee echoed these concerns, recommending a full ban due to the potential for AIs to “mask certain neurologic signs and symptoms,” particularly those associated with concussions.The league’s official stance is firm. Players, coaches, and staff are prohibited from using or providing smelling salts in any game context — pregame, during play, or even halftime. The FDA highlighted troubling side effects like shortness of breath, seizures, vomiting, and even fainting, especially from unapproved or cheaply sourced products bought online.Smelling salts, once intended to revive fainting victims, have become a go-to stimulant for athletes in high-impact sports like football and hockey. While Kittle’s playful protest might have earned chuckles, the ban is rooted in player safety — a direction the league clearly isn't planning to reverse.Still, fans shouldn’t worry. Kittle just signed a lucrative extension, and despite the melodrama, he isn’t actually walking away from football. But one thing’s for sure — he definitely wants a compromise.Also Read: How Erin Andrews and Charissa Thompson remain unbiased despite close ties with top NFL players",Nfl’s smelling salt ban leaves george kittle outraged.

Elliotte Friedman says it’s ‘irresponsible’ to speculate on Carter Hart’s NHL future post-acquittal

Public relations risk keeps teams like Oilers away from Carter Hart amid unresolved eligibility

The NHL future of Carter Hart remains shrouded in uncertainty, even after his acquittal in the high-profile Hockey Canada sexual assault case. While fans continue to debate whether the former Philadelphia Flyers goalie deserves another shot on the ice, NHL insider Elliotte Friedman has strongly advised against making any assumptions.Five members of Canada’s 2018 world junior hockey team were found not guilty of sexual assault, ending months-long trial that has garnered national attention since it began in April. Michael McLeod, Carter Hart, Alex Formenton, Dillon Dubé and Cal Foote were acquitted of all charges by Ontario Superior Court Justice Maria Carroccia.Speaking on his 32 Thoughts podcast, Elliotte Friedman addressed the growing speculation around Hart’s potential return to the league. Despite being found not guilty along with four other players in the 2018 Hockey Canada case, Hart’s status remains unresolved in the eyes of the NHL.“I think it is really irresponsible to speculate until we have a legal ruling on this,” Friedman said. “I don’t think anything more needs to be said about that until we know if they're eligible to play. I just don't think it's smart to speculate on where they could play.”The NHL has made it clear that acquittal does not equate to reinstatement.The league released a statement acknowledging that the players’ behavior—though not criminally punishable—was still “very disturbing” and “unacceptable.” The league added that it would be “reviewing and considering the judge's findings” before making any decisions about eligibility.While Hart is technically an unrestricted free agent, teams are hesitant. Analyst Avry Lewis-McDougall shut down rumors linking Hart to the Edmonton Oilers during the Fanatics View Hockey Show, stating bluntly: “It’s a hard no.” He cited both the unresolved nature of Hart’s status and the inevitable media firestorm.“Teams don’t want the PR headache,” he said. “You should be looking at somebody you can bring in with less baggage.”With the Oilers needing a reliable goalie after two consecutive Stanley Cup Final losses, Lewis-McDougall emphasized that Hart’s off-ice issues make him an unsuitable option—even if he’s cleared to return.For now, Carter Hart’s road back to the NHL remains a legal, ethical, and reputational maze.Also Read: “Keep it real and sensible”: Carey Price’s wife Angela responds to Sydney Sweeney’s American Eagle ad backlash Since early 2024, Hart has been on an indefinite leave of absence from hockey due to his alleged involvement in the 2018 Hockey Canada sexual assault scandal; upon reaching restricted free agency that offseason, the Flyers did not match his minimum qualifying salary offer and thereby released him.",Elliotte friedman says it's 'irresponsible' to speculate on carter hart's nhl future.

“They pop for him … they tweaked him a little bit with the hair. I thought it worked.”

Brock Lesnar’s comeback context and legal background

Brock Lesnar made a shocking return to WWE on August 3, 2025, at SummerSlam Night Two in MetLife Stadium, New Jersey. After being away since SummerSlam 2023, he surprised everyone by attacking John Cena, just minutes after Cena lost the Undisputed WWE Title to Cody Rhodes. UFC legends Daniel Cormier and Chael Sonnen spoke about Lesnar’s comeback on Cormier’s Mightycast podcast, noting how Lesnar’s new long‑haired look and his sheer presence still make him a top star. They said it felt like Lesnar could still lead the WWE show.Daniel Cormier and Chael Sonnen began their discussion by recalling Lesnar’s entrance at SummerSlam Night Two. Cormier said the show “delivered” when Lesnar came back. Sonnen agreed and noted that WWE tweaked Lesnar’s appearance slightly adding long hair and the crowd loved it. He said:Daniel Cormier added that Lesnar “looked tremendous” and still seems like someone who “could run the WWE.” His tone made it clear: even after two years away, Lesnar’s presence feels dominant and very much in control.Brock Lesnar had not appeared on WWE since he lost to Cody Rhodes at SummerSlam 2023. WWE pulled him from shows, including Royal Rumble 2024, after Brock’s name surfaced in the Janel Grant lawsuit against Vince McMahon. Lesnar was mentioned in the amended complaint filed in February 2025. That legal issue had kept him off TV.Also Read: “Stop Practicing With Men”: Andre Agassi’s Father Once Blamed Male Practice Partners For Shocking Downfall Of Serena Williams And Venus Williams Daniel Cormier had even said Lesnar was on a “banned list,” though it wasn’t clear whether that was by UFC, WWE or TKO.

His comeback was kept secret even WWE staff and media were told nothing.At the end of John Cena vs. CodyRhodes, as the crowd was still cheering, Brock Lesnar’s music hit. He stormed the ring and hit Cena with his signature F‑5 finisher. Then he left without speaking. The show closed on that shocking moment.","Brock lesnar made a shocking return to wwe on august 3, 2025, at summerslam night two in metlife stadium, new jersey.

Connor Bedard is carrying a franchise with no real plan — why are the Blackhawks wasting a generational talent?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/connor-bedard-is-carrying-a-franchise-with-no-real-plan-why-are-the-blackhawks-wasting-a-generational-talent/articleshow/123118785.cms,"Chicago Blackhawks' offseason strategy faces scrutiny as they haven't adequately supported Connor Bedard (Getty Images)

Chicago’s offseason moves lack the firepower Connor Bedard needs right now

Banking on prospects won’t cut it for a team in need of progress



As the 2025 NHL offseason nears its end, one glaring oversight from the Chicago Blackhawks continues to spark concern: the team has done little to meaningfully support Connor Bedard. Despite high hopes following his promising rookie campaign, Chicago’s reluctance to add top-tier talent raises questions about the front office’s long-term strategy—and whether it's setting up its young star to succeed or fail.After a disappointing 2024–25 season that saw the Blackhawks fire head coach Luke Richardson and stumble to another forgettable finish, fans expected the franchise to get aggressive in free agency. At one point, Chicago was even loosely linked to Mitch Marner before he landed in Vegas. But instead of landing a game-changer, the Blackhawks settled for smaller trade-market moves—sending Joe Veleno to Seattle for Andre Burakovsky and reacquiring Sam Lafferty from Buffalo.While Burakovsky has potential, his recent form leaves room for doubt. Lafferty, though valuable in a bottom-six role, won't share much ice time with Bedard.And that’s the problem—none of these moves bring the high-skill, top-line help the Blackhawks’ 19-year-old cornerstone desperately needs.Chicago's front office seems committed to giving their young players a shot at roster spots. That long-term vision is admirable, but it comes at the cost of short-term development. Bedard may be the future, but he needs support now to build confidence and elevate his play.Free agents like Jonathan Drouin, Andrew Mangiapane, or even a more ambitious play for Nikolaj Ehlers could’ve changed the dynamic completely. And there’s still a chance to correct course—names like Jack Roslovic remain available and could slot in as immediate help.Also Read: Connor McDavid Trade Bombshell to the Bruins: NHL insiders say it could guarantee a Stanley Cup win For now, though, the Blackhawks are skating on thin ice. “Bedard needs players he can count on right now,” and unless that changes soon, Chicago risks wasting another crucial year of their franchise savior’s development.","Chicago blackhawks' offseason strategy faces scrutiny as they haven't adequately supported connor bedard.

Nick Robertson emerges as trade rumor target amid identity crisis

Can Robertson fill the Marner-sized hole — or is he being set up to fail?

The Toronto Maple Leafs’ offseason has taken a turbulent turn, with the franchise still reeling from another early playoff exit. But it’s not just the loss to the Florida Panthers that has fans restless — it’s the massive shake-up that followed. Mitch Marner, one of the team’s cornerstone stars, is no longer wearing blue and white. His sign-and-trade to the Vegas Golden Knights — where he inked an 8-year, $96 million deal — sent shockwaves through Leafs Nation.While the Leafs received Nicolas Roy in return, his bottom-six forward role is no match for the offensive engine that was Marner. With 102 points last season and 741 over his nine-year career in Toronto, replacing him isn't just hard — it’s nearly impossible.“Mitch Marner was far more than a point scorer… he carried the team’s offensive burden night after night,” the article states.As the team begins to recalibrate, another name is surfacing — Nick Robertson. A recent episode of the 32 Thoughts Podcast lit up speculation when insider Elliotte Friedman said: “I had a couple people ask me about the possibility of Nick Robertson and Pittsburgh; Kyle Dubas knows him…”Dubas, now at the helm in Pittsburgh, drafted Robertson in 2019 and may see untapped potential in the 24-year-old winger.Robertson has battled through injuries but showed glimpses of promise, posting 27 points in 56 games in 2023–24 and returning healthy last season.With his recent one-year, $1.2 million deal, the Leafs seem to be keeping doors open. But the bigger question is: are they investing in his growth, or simply boosting his trade value?While Robertson lacks Marner’s pedigree, his cost-effective contract and improving form make him an intriguing piece. Whether the Leafs see him as a long-term asset or a short-term solution remains unclear.Also Read: Carter Hart’s NHL future in limbo as Elliotte Friedman blasts return rumors post-Hockey Canada verdict In a cap-crunched, expectation-heavy city like Toronto, hope is never cheap — and patience, even less so.","Toronto maple leafs are facing turmoil after their playoff exit.

Kirby Dach’s recovery timeline raises doubts about return for Montreal Canadiens’ 2025–26 NHL season opener,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/kirby-dachs-recovery-timeline-raises-doubts-about-return-for-montreal-canadiens-202526-nhl-season-opener/articleshow/123127558.cms,"Tony Gutierrez/AP

Kirby Dach recovery timeline casts doubt on Montreal Canadiens lineup for 2025–26 NHL opening night

Montreal Canadiens urged to prioritize Kirby Dach’s long-term health over early NHL return after knee injury

Montreal Canadiens forward Kirby Dach may not be ready for the start of the 2025–26 NHL season, as recovery from his knee surgery is reportedly still ongoing. According to a new report, the 24-year-old has yet to fully heal from the procedure he underwent after suffering an injury in late February. Concerns are now growing about his availability for opening night.The uncertainty around Kirby Dach's recovery gained traction after journalist Maxime Truman reported that the forward is still not fully recovered. That report was further supported by comments from an orthopedic surgeon, who spoke to HFTV, stating that the general recovery window for a professional athlete after such a procedure is between 6–9 months. However, the surgeon added that if it was a repeat surgery, the recovery timeline could be even longer.Considering Dach's injury occurred near the end of February, the standard timeline places his return somewhere between late August and November. While there remains a chance that Dach could return in time for the Montreal Canadiens' season opener, it is far from guaranteed. His actual availability will depend heavily on when he resumes skating and how his knee responds in the coming weeks.While Canadiens fans hope to see Dach in the lineup on opening night, many believe the organization should exercise caution. A rushed return could risk aggravating the injury or causing long-term setbacks. Several observers, including Truman, emphasized the importance of allowing Dach to recover fully before rejoining the team.Dach, originally drafted third overall by the Chicago Blackhawks in 2019, was traded to the Canadiens in 2022 and has since become a key piece in Montreal’s rebuilding efforts. Ensuring his long-term health is viewed as essential not just for the current season but for the franchise’s future success.Although having Kirby Dach ready for the 2025–26 NHL season opener would benefit the Montreal Canadiens, the focus remains on his complete recovery. With his long-term value to the team in mind, both the medical staff and front office are expected to proceed with caution, prioritizing health over haste.Also Read: Toronto Maple Leafs ink William Villeneuve to new contract for 2025–26 season after breakout AHL year","Montreal canadiens forward kirby dach may not be ready for the start of the 2025–26 nhl season, as recovery from his knee surgery is reportedly still ongoing.

How Recent Moves Highlight the Problem

Why Los Angeles Holds Special Meaning for Kevin Love

What Could Happen Next

, a five-time NBA All-Star and one of the league’s most respected veterans, has entered trade season with a clear goal - landing with the Los Angeles Lakers or LA Clippers. After completing his 17th season with the Miami Heat, where he delivered steady production and veteran leadership, Love became part of a major three-team deal.The trade sent John Collins to the Clippers, Norman Powell to Miami, and Kevin Love - along with Kyle Anderson - to the Utah Jazz. At nearly 37, Love has little interest in joining a rebuilding effort in Utah, instead setting his sights on a buyout and a final playoff push in Los Angeles, where he could reunite with former teammates or coaches.While the Lakers and Clippers would both welcome a stretch big with Kevin Love’s pedigree, the hard cap presents a major roadblock. Due to recent high-profile acquisitions, both franchises are hard-capped at the first salary apron.• Lakers: Sitting just $1.1 million under the first apron, any move for Love would require clearing a roster spot and freeing enough space below the cap - likely through trading or waiving guaranteed contracts.• Clippers: Only $1.2 million below the apron after blockbuster moves for Bradley Beal and Chris Paul, the team would face a similar challenge, potentially having to give up a young player or key contract to fit Love under the cap.Recent roster decisions by both LA teams show just how tight the margins are:• The Lakers waived players like Jordan Goodwin and Shake Milton to fit in Deandre Ayton and Marcus Smart.• The Clippers had to waive Jordan Miller and Drew Eubanks to sign Chris Paul and Bradley Beal, later re-signing Miller on a two-way deal.For contenders already managing limited flexibility, taking on a veteran in the twilight of his career comes with risk.Kevin Love’s interest in Los Angeles isn’t solely about basketball:• California Connections: Raised in Oregon but a star at UCLA, Love has deep ties to LA’s basketball community.• Familiar Faces: Potential reunions with LeBron James on the Lakers or Tyronn Lue with the Clippers add a personal incentive.• Defined Playoff Role: Even in a limited capacity, his shooting, toughness, and leadership fit the mold for teams chasing a championship.The most likely path for Kevin Love involves a Jazz buyout followed by waiting for midseason when teams often have more roster flexibility. Alternatively, the Lakers or Clippers could free up space now, but that would require sacrificing depth or valuable contracts.Also read: De’Aaron Fox Signs $229 Million Extension, Shares Emotional Message with San Antonio Spurs Fans For now, the veteran forward’s desire to finish his career in LA remains stuck between ambition and financial reality - a reminder that even for proven champions, the NBA’s hard cap can be an immovable obstacle.","Kevin love is a five-time nba all-star and one of the league’s most respected veterans.

Mixed Reactions and What’s Next

Thehave made a franchise-defining move, securing point guardon a four-year, $229 million maximum contract extension. The deal, confirmed by Klutch Sports CEO Rich Paul and first reported by ESPN’s Shams Charania, runs through the 2029-30 NBA season with no player options or trade kickers - making it one of the largest contracts in league history. De’Aaron Fox , once the centerpiece of the Sacramento Kings, grew frustrated with the team’s trajectory last season. Reports indicated he had no interest in extending his contract in Sacramento, paving the way for a blockbuster trade before the deadline. The San Antonio Spurs, eager to fast-track their rebuild and pair a proven playmaker with emerging star Victor Wembanyama, capitalized.The trade, which also involved the Chicago Bulls , brought Fox to San Antonio. His debut run was shortened to 17 games due to a thumb injury, but his numbers - 19.7 points, 6.8 assists, 4.3 rebounds, and 1.5 steals per game - showed exactly why the Spurs view him as a foundational piece in their push toward playoff contention.Shortly after signing, De’Aaron Fox took to X to address the San Antonio Spurs community: “San Antonio! So thankful to be a part of an incredible organization, it’s an honor to put on black and silver. Can’t wait for us to make our future! Race for Seis! Go Spurs Go,”Accompanied by silver and black heart emojis, the post signaled Fox’s pride in joining the franchise and his commitment to chasing a sixth championship for San Antonio.At an average of $57.25 million per year, Fox now ranks among the NBA’s top earners. While some critics question paying that figure to a player with only one All-Star selection and limited playoff success, Spurs leadership sees the extension as a strategic investment.With rookies Dylan Harper (No. 2 overall pick) and Stephon Castle (reigning Rookie of the Year) joining Wembanyama, Fox’s leadership and playmaking are seen as critical to bridging youth with experience. The SSan Antonio purs’ favorable salary situation means they can absorb Fox’s contract without immediately hitting the luxury tax - giving them flexibility until their young core becomes eligible for extensions.The deal has sparked debate across the league. Supporters envision a dynamic San Antonio Spurs backcourt and a return to fast-paced, high-energy basketball. Skeptics, however, wonder if De’Aaron Fox’s production matches the price tag and whether he could eventually be moved if younger guards develop into primary ballhandlers.Also read: Boston Celtics Weigh Trade Options and Roster Adjustments Ahead of 2025-26 Season For now, the San Antonio Spurs’ commitment is clear: build around Wembanyama while giving the team a proven floor general to guide them into contention.

What it was like meeting Taylor Swift | Calm Down Podcast

They have built some real relationship, real moments over the years



Some stories in sports broadcasting go beyond stats and sidelines — they’re about the people behind the mic and the bonds they form along the way. For Erin Andrews and Charissa Thompson, covering the NFL isn’t just a job. It’s a lifelong passion wrapped in genuine friendships, unforgettable moments, and the occasional fangirl reaction. In a candid chat on their Calm Down podcast, the Fox Sports veterans opened up about the delicate, often hilarious balance of staying professional while cheering on the very athletes they’ve grown close to over the years.It’s rare to hear seasoned broadcasters admit they still get starstruck, but Andrews and Thompson wear their enthusiasm proudly. “I don’t,” Andrews said when asked how she maintains composure around NFL icons. “I’m a huge fan of all the guys I cover and I get so excited to talk to them.” Her co-host, Thompson, echoed the sentiment, recalling a thrilling comeback by Baker Mayfield. “That was probably not professional, but I didn’t care, that was f—king awesome,” she laughed.Their excitement doesn’t come from a lack of experience. Andrews has been with Fox since 2012 and has covered multiple Super Bowls, including Super Bowl 2025.Thompson leads Fox NFL Kickoff and co-hosts Thursday Night Football on Prime Video. Yet, even with such credentials, the spark of fandom remains — not as a weakness, but as a reflection of their love for the sport and its athletes.The personal connections Andrews and Thompson have built over the years — with stars like Aaron Rodgers, Patrick Mahomes , and Travis Kelce — are not just professional relationships. They’ve been nurtured through mutual trust, time, and authenticity. “It’s taken us a minute to get where we are,” Andrews explained. “You have to build up credibility… with not only viewers at home, your bosses and also, the players and the coaches.”That credibility has extended beyond the sideline. This past offseason, Andrews and Thompson vacationed with Kelce and his girlfriend, Taylor Swift — a couple whose relationship they famously supported from the start. “They want to see you having a good time and smiling,” Andrews shared, reflecting on Fox’s culture that encourages authenticity. “There is nothing wrong with sitting on the [show] desk with Baker after an amazing game... and be like, 'Can we just talk about this last play?' It’s awesome.”Their unique blend of enthusiasm and professionalism has earned them trust in both locker rooms and living rooms. With reported contract extensions on the horizon, it’s clear their approach — candid, joyful, and human — is a winning formula in today’s sports media.Also Read: “I feel guilty”: Christian McCaffrey can’t stop admiring Olivia Culpo’s strength in emotional message after baby’s arrival",Erin andrews and charissa thompson have covered the nfl for more than a decade.

The Buffalo Sabres look set to flip the script

The Buffalo Sabres have doubled down on their belief in goaltender Devon Levi, signing the young netminder to a two-year deal that signals a serious opportunity. After flashing brilliance in the American Hockey League with a .919 save percentage and seven shutouts for the Rochester Americans, Levi now finds himself in the thick of the NHL goaltending race.Inking defenseman Bowen Byram to a two-year, $12.5 million extension should have settled the Sabres' blue line. Instead, it stirred rumors across the league. Though the front office isn’t actively shopping the former top pick, insiders suggest Buffalo is at least listening to offers, particularly for a potential upgrade up front or a right-shot defenseman.Byram logged big minutes last season, excelling in shot-blocking and defensive coverage. But with the Sabres still reshaping their identity, his high trade value could be the key to acquiring a top-six NHL forward.In a bold move that stunned fans. As the Sabres traded 25-goal scorer JJ Peterka to the Utah Hockey Club. In return, Buffalo landed right-shot defenseman Michael Kesselring and high-upside forward Josh Doan. While the departure of Peterka’s offensive production stings, this could be a long-term play with big potential.Kesselring’s size and raw ability could make him an ideal partner for Owen Power, while Doan brings grit and a two-way game that Buffalo has been missing in the middle six. If Doan breaks out and Kesselring develops quickly. This trade could be viewed as a win, especially with Peterka due for a big payday in the coming years.As the 2025–26 NHL season approaches, the Buffalo Sabres are clearly not settling. Even for another year on the playoff bubble. From bold signings to risk-filled trades, the front office is signaling that the rebuild is over. The NHL’s youngest roster is now aiming for relevance, and possibly redemption.
