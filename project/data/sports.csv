Patrick Mahomes battles quiet rehab as Brittany Mahomes creates stability for their children,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/patrick-mahomes-battles-quiet-rehab-as-brittany-mahomes-creates-stability-for-their-children/articleshow/127473169.cms,"Patrick Mahomes is enduring a demanding offseason as he recovers from an ACL and LCL tear, limiting his usual family routine. While he focuses on rehabilitation and a possible Week 1 return, Brittany Mahomes is creating joyful moments for their children, helping maintain normalcy as the Chiefs star patiently works through recovery.

Brittany Mahomes steps forward as Patrick Mahomes grinds through rehab

Patrick Mahomes is used to controlling chaos on the field. This offseason, control is not an option. The Kansas City Chiefs quarterback is rehabbing a serious knee injury in near silence, learning patience while his body resets and his routine disappears. Training days have turned into long recovery sessions, and the familiar rhythm of movement, travel, and playtime now looks very different.At home, life keeps moving. Brittany Mahomes has taken on the emotional heavy lifting, making sure Sterling, Bronze, and Golden Raye still experience joy while their father watches more than he participates. The family recently stepped out together, not for football, but for normalcy. It was a small escape, yet a telling one, as Mahomes continues one of the toughest offseasons of his career.The injury changed everything. Patrick Mahomes tore his ACL and LCL late in the season after taking a hit while extending a play against the Chargers. Surgery followed, along with a long recovery timeline that demands restraint, something not often associated with his improvisational style.Brittany Mahomes documented a family trip to Disney On Ice, sharing moments of Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, and Donald Duck skating as the family briefly stepped away from their Missouri home.She described the day simply as the “best time today,” a phrase that reflected effort, not ease.Behind the scenes, Mahomes is already focused on returning. His goals remain clear, even as medical caution shapes every step. “I want to be ready for Week 1,” Mahomes said. “The doctors said I could. But I can't predict what will happen throughout the process. That's the goal to play Week 1 and have no restrictions.“You want to be out there healthy and give us the best chance to win. I hope to do some things in OTAs and training camp and be able to do things there.”Outside voices have urged patience. Pro Football Talk’s Mike Florio has noted how late-season ACL injuries complicate timelines, especially for quarterbacks who rely on movement. Examples like Adrian Peterson offer hope, but Mahomes faces multiple ligament repairs in a modern recovery environment built around caution.For now, the Chiefs star heals quietly. Brittany keeps life bright. Together, they move forward one careful step at a time.","Patrick mahomes tore his acl and lcl late in the season.

Why Kyle Tucker Would Have Fit Toronto Blue Jays’ Long-Term Plan

Toronto Blue Jays (Image Source - Getty Images)

What Each Side Would Have Gained

The Risks That Would Have Come With It

If Kyle Tucker had reached the open market instead of signing with the Los Angeles Dodgers in January 2026, the Toronto Blue Jays would likely have emerged as one of the most aggressive teams in pursuit.Tucker is one of the rare players who checks every box. He brings power without selling out his approach, plays strong defense in the outfield, and is still firmly in his prime. Players like that almost never become available, which is why his hypothetical free agency would have reshaped conversations across the league. Toronto, facing growing pressure after several playoff appearances that failed to produce a deep run, would have been well positioned to act.The Blue Jays have hovered on the edge of true contention for years. They’ve had talent, depth, and pitching, but the lineup has often lacked a single, game-altering presence who changes how opponents plan an entire series. Tucker fits that role cleanly. He’s not just another bat in the order; he’s the type of hitter who forces pitchers to work differently and reshapes how defenses align.Timing would have mattered as much as talent. With the Houston Astros managing payroll constraints and Tucker nearing the most expensive years of his career, the idea of him becoming available had already loosened the market.For Toronto, this would not have been about adding depth or chasing marginal gains. It would have been a direct attempt to raise the team’s ceiling and move from contender to legitimate title threat.Any discussion around Kyle Tucker begins with contract reality. Industry expectations suggest his next deal could comfortably exceed $400 million, a figure that would place him among baseball’s highest-paid players. For Houston, moving him before that point would have meant gaining young, controllable talent while avoiding a massive long-term obligation.Toronto, meanwhile, would have seen a rare opening. The organization has both the prospect depth and the competitive urgency to justify a major swing. While any deal would have required real sacrifice, either top prospects or players ready for everyday roles, the payoff would have been immediate. This would have been the type of move that defines an era rather than supplements it.From Toronto Blue Jays’ point of view, adding Kyle Tucker would have solved multiple problems at once. He offers consistent middle-of-the-order production, with a track record of strong averages, power, and run creation. That kind of reliability has been uneven in recent Blue Jays lineups, especially when games tighten late in the season.There’s also the matter of presence. Tucker carries star weight. His arrival would have sent a clear message to both the clubhouse and the fanbase that the front office was willing to push beyond comfort to chase a championship.For Tucker, Toronto would have represented a chance to step into a major market with a competitive roster already in place. The environment would have supported both performance and profile, while positioning him for the type of long-term contract his production suggests is coming.The cost would not have been light. Toronto would have needed to part with valuable future assets, potentially thinning out depth that matters over a long season. There’s also the reality of Tucker’s recent injury history, including time missed in 2024, which adds uncertainty to any long-term commitment.For Houston, moving on from a cornerstone player would have meant an immediate hit to star power and lineup balance. The success of such a move would hinge entirely on how quickly and effectively the return pieces developed.Tucker himself would have faced the pressure that comes with a new league, a demanding market, and heightened expectations. Toronto is not a quiet place to struggle, especially for a player brought in to change outcomes.Had Tucker not already committed to the Dodgers, Toronto would have been one of the clearest teams ready to move first and spend big. The fit made sense in terms of timing, roster construction, and competitive goals. While the risks would have been real on every side, so would the upside.Also read: MLB trade rumors: New York Mets exploring blockbuster move for $116.5 million Arizona Diamondbacks star following Jeff McNeil exit Deals like this don’t just alter a single roster. They change how a team is viewed for years.

“Coming home” hits differently as Mike McCarthy’s daughter Alex reacts to his emotional Steelers introduction



Alex Noel McCarthy (Alex Noel McCarthy/Instagram)

Mike McCarthy is back where it all began. The Pittsburgh native has officially taken the helm as head coach of the Pittsburgh Steelers, marking a full-circle moment in his career. “This city, this franchise, this fan base means the world to me because Pittsburgh is my world and it's just awesome to be back here,” McCarthy said, visibly emotional during his first press conference at Acrisure Stadium. With his family by his side, he promised a renewed drive for Super Bowl glory.For McCarthy, this isn’t just a coaching job-- it’s personal. Born and raised in the blue-collar Greenfield neighborhood, he grew up watching the Steelers dominate the 1970s, winning four Super Bowls. His father’s legacy as a police officer, firefighter, and bar owner instilled in him a love for community and grit. “I want to make sure when we do get that seventh trophy in the case, we'll start that victory parade at 1137 Greenfield Ave. ,” he shared, referencing his childhood home. His connection to Pittsburgh goes beyond football; it’s about pride, roots, and unfinished business.McCarthy becomes only the fourth Steelers head coach since 1969, following Chuck Noll, Bill Cowher, and Mike Tomlin.That history alone explains the weight of the job. Tomlin leaves behind 19 seasons without a losing record and a Super Bowl title, setting a standard few franchises can match.McCarthy’s resume shows he understands expectations. Across stops in Green Bay and Dallas, he built a 174-112-2 regular season record with 11 postseason wins. His Super Bowl victory came against the Steelers in 2011, a twist of fate that now adds irony to his return.The emotional impact of the hire reached his family too. His oldest daughter, Alex Noel McCarthy, shared moments from the press conference online, including a photo of her father’s name lighting up the stadium screen. She also reposted a fan video defending the hire, adding a simple message: “Let’s. Go.”Adding another twist of irony, McCarthy expressed hope to reunite with quarterback Aaron Rodgers in a Steelers uniform next season. It’s a poetic nod to the past, considering Rodgers led Green Bay to victory against McCarthy’s Packers in the 2011 Super Bowl. Beyond stats and history, McCarthy’s return embodies heart, legacy, and a promise to Pittsburgh: more championships, more pride, and a coach who calls this city home.","Mike mccarthy has officially taken the helm as head coach of the pittsburgh steelers.

Bill Belichick Hall of Fame snub explained



Bill Belichick Hall of Fame discussions rarely carry suspense. This time, they did. The football world woke up to a shock as the most decorated head coach of the Super Bowl era failed to clear the final step into Canton on his first try. For a figure synonymous with winning, preparation, and longevity, the delay landed like a thunderclap across the NFL landscape.The decision stunned fans, former players, and executives alike. Belichick’s résumé has long been treated as untouchable. Yet when the Pro Football Hall of Fame votes were counted, history paused instead of marching forward. The result immediately ignited debate about legacy, standards, and whether greatness can ever be separated from controversy.According to ESPN’s Seth Wickersham and Don Van Natta Jr., the six-time Super Bowl champion head coach has not been elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame on his first ballot.“In voting earlier this month, Belichick fell short of the 40 out of 50 votes needed for induction to the Pro Football Hall of Fame during his first year of eligibility,” the duo wrote for ESPN.com on Tuesday. “Belichick received a call from a Hall representative last Friday afternoon with the news that he won't be inducted into the Hall in Canton, Ohio, this summer.”“Six Super Bowls isn't enough?” Belichick reportedly asked an associate, per Wickersham and Van Natta Jr.—who added that he also asked another, ""What does a guy have to do?”While Belichick stands among the greatest coaches the NFL has ever seen, voters reportedly struggled to separate his success from past controversies. Multiple sources confirmed that Spygate and Deflategate surfaced during deliberations, reopening old wounds tied to the Patriots dynasty.“The only explanation [for the outcome] was the cheating stuff, ”a veteran Hall of Fame voter told ESPN. “It really bothered some of the guys.”Belichick, 73, coached New England from 2000 to 2023 and compiled a staggering 333-178 overall record, including postseason play. His teams captured 17 AFC East titles, nine conference championships, and six Super Bowls, numbers that usually guarantee instant enshrinement.Yet one voter reportedly argued for patience. “A voter who spoke on condition of anonymity said that Polian… told some voters he believed Belichick should 'wait a year' before induction as penance for Spygate, the 2007 cheating scandal that cost the team a first-round draft pick.”Reaction across the league was swift. Patrick Mahomes summed up the disbelief felt by many.""Insane… don't even understand how this could be possible,"" Mahomes wrote on social media.Belichick will now wait until the 2027 vote, a delay that adds an unexpected chapter to a career defined by control and certainty.","Bill belichick fell short of the 40 out of 50 votes needed for induction to the pro football hall of fame during his first year of eligibility.

Cardi briefly acknowledged the chant as the moment went viral. The incident split fan opinion and added fresh controversy to New England’s Super Bowl buildup.

Patriots celebration turns tense as fans target Cardi B with explicit chants

The celebration on the field should have been simple. Confetti. Cameras. A ticket to the Super Bowl. Instead, the moment turned loud and uncomfortable when Cardi B joined Stefon Diggs after the New England Patriots clinched the AFC Championship. What followed was not scripted and not ignored. Fans near the tunnel began chanting an explicit insult aimed at her estranged husband, dragging personal history into a football night meant for triumph.Cardi did not retreat. She raised her fist, acknowledging the noise as Diggs stood beside her. The clip spread fast, cutting across sports and pop culture timelines. For some fans, it felt like harmless chaos. For others, it crossed a line and reflected poorly on the franchise. The scene added another layer to a postseason already filled with drama, scrutiny, and off field tension.The video sparked immediate debate online. One commenter brushed it off, writing, “They so corny for that. Them folks happy and wasn’t even thinking bout cuzz.” Another fan took a harsher view, saying, “I love the patriots that being said I’ve NEVER been more disgusted in my life with our organization.” The divide showed how quickly joy can turn into discomfort when personal narratives take center stage.Before her relationship with Diggs, Cardi B was married to Offset from 2017 to 2023. They share three children. Since moving on, Cardi and Stefon Diggs have welcomed a child together, deepening public attention on their relationship.That attention now follows Diggs into a critical stretch. The Patriots will face the Seattle Seahawks in Super Bowl LX, a rematch loaded with history. Yet Diggs’ focus may be split. Days after the game, he is scheduled for an arraignment related to felony strangulation and misdemeanor assault charges. He has denied the allegations.Cardi previously defended him with a post later removed, stating, “Not once has that woman said anything to me about being touched.. NOT ONCE!!”As the Super Bowl nears, the Patriots stand at the center of celebration and controversy. The noise is only getting louder.","Cardi b and stefon diggs were celebrating the patriots' afc championship win. Fans chanted an explicit insult aimed at her estranged husband, offset.

Edmonton Oilers ’ blue line dominance turns the tide against Anaheim Ducks



NHL Highlights | Ducks vs. Oilers - January 26, 2026

Mattias Ekholm gave Edmonton fans something to cheer about. In his 938th NHL game, the veteran defenseman scored his first career hat trick, helping the Oilers beat the Anaheim Ducks 7-4. It wasn’t just about the goals; his performance highlighted the strength and depth of Edmonton’s defense in a big way.Ekholm’s hat trick came after a long goal drought this season, highlighting persistence and timing. He wasn’t just scoring; he was making history. The Oilers became the first team in NHL history to have defensemen score hat tricks in consecutive games, with Evan Bouchard accomplishing the feat just two nights earlier. It was a defensive showcase turned offensive explosion.The night truly belonged to Edmonton’s blue line. Ekholm opened the second-period surge with a give-and-go finish, and Darnell Nurse quickly followed to extend the lead. Within minutes, the Oilers had turned a tight game into a commanding advantage, fueled by defensemen breaking plays out of their zone, joining the rush, and creating scoring opportunities that kept Anaheim constantly on their heels. Connor McDavid and Zach Hyman each scored a goal and added an assist, while Leon Draisaitl set up four more, showing how well the Oilers’ offense works together. Tristan Jarry made 36 saves, keeping Edmonton in control and giving the team the confidence to keep going. The team’s strong chemistry and balanced attack made it hard for Anaheim to find any momentum.For the Ducks, Mikael Granlund scored a power-play hat trick, with Beckett Sennecke assisting twice, keeping Anaheim in the fight. Still, Edmonton’s mix of aggressive defense and opportunistic offense was too strong. Empty-net goals from McDavid and Ekholm wrapped up the 7-4 win, leaving a big mark on the season and reinforcing the Oilers as a threat from every part of the ice.Coach Kris Knoblauch praised Ekholm’s night, noting how unusual it is for a defenseman to score three goals in a single game. The performance highlighted Ekholm’s persistence and also showed just how deep and versatile Edmonton’s squad has become, able to turn defensive play into scoring chances at any moment.","Mattias ekholm scored his first career hat trick, helping the edmonton oilers beat the anaheim ducks 7-4.

Understanding the basic rules and how the Super Bowl game flows

Super Bowl LX is set to bring together the New England Patriots and the Seattle Seahawks on February 8, 2026, and millions of viewers will be tuning in, whether they are lifelong fans or watching their first NFL game. American football can feel confusing at first, especially during an event this big, but understanding a few core rules makes the experience far more enjoyable.From how teams move the ball to how points are scored, the Super Bowl follows the same structure as any regular NFL game. Addititonally a slew of electrifying performances from Green Day, Charlie Puth, and Bad Bunny are also attractions that will ensure that the ceremony is grand and full of spectacle.Each team has 11 players on the field at a time, with one side playing offense and the other defense. The goal is to score more points than your opponent by moving the ball down the field and into the end zone. Teams can advance the ball by running it or throwing it forward. The offense is led by the quarterback, who touches the ball on almost every play.The offensive team is given four chances, known as downs, to move the ball at least 10 yards.If they succeed, they earn a fresh set of four downs. If they fail, the other team takes over possession. A touchdown is worth six points and occurs when the ball crosses into the end zone.After a touchdown, teams usually kick an extra point to get an additional score, or they can aim for a two-point conversion by running or passing the ball into the end zone again. A field goal, which is often used when a team stalls near scoring range, is worth three points. A safety gives the defense two points if they tackle an offensive player in their own end zone.Every game begins with a kickoff, which also happens after halftime and after each scoring play. If an offense cannot gain enough yards, it may punt the ball to push the opposing team farther back. Defensive measures include interceptions, which are when a defender catches a pass meant for the offense and immediately becomes the attacking team.The Super Bowl is played over four quarters, each for 15 minutes. If the score is tied at the end of regulation, overtime begins with a coin toss. The winner of the toss can choose to either receive the ball or kick it away. Super Bowl LX will air live on NBC, featuring Mike Tirico, Cris Collinsworth, and Melissa Stark. Fans without cable can stream the game and halftime show on Peacock, Fubo, Hulu + Live TV, YouTube TV, and NFL+.","Super bowl lx is set to bring together the new england patriots and the seattle seahawks on february 8, 2026.

Skal Labissiere gets a short-term chance with the Washington Wizards ahead of the trade deadline

Strong G League run puts Skal Labissiere in line for a bigger role with the Washington Wizards

According to Shams Charania of ESPN, Skal Labissiere signed a 10-day deal with the Washington Wizards on Tuesday. Since the Atlanta Hawks acquired Trae Young in exchange for C.J. McCollum and Corey Kispert, Washington has had a roster spot available. With Nikola Vukcevic and Marvin Bagley III sidelined due to injuries, the Wizards are lacking in frontcourt.Amidst this, Charania reported that Labissiere signed the contract to join Brian Keefe's team. The 29-year-old is a former Kentucky first-round selection. Additionally, the Capital City Go-Go, the Wizards' G League affiliate, has called him up. Furthermore, Labissiere played in 36 games during his one year at UK, averaging 15.8 minutes per game.Labissiere’s 10-day contract will expire on Thursday, February 5, if it is formalized today, but the Wizards may terminate it early if they need the roster slot to make a trade-deadline move. Announcing the same, Charania wrote on X:“The Washington Wizards are signing center Skal Labissiere to a 10-day contract out of their Capital City affiliate, agent Daniel Hazan tells ESPN. Labissiere enters a sixth NBA season after being a first-round pick in 2016. He has shot 55% from field and 44% from 3 in G League…”In 2016, the Phoenix Suns selected Labissiere with the 28th overall pick.The Sacramento Kings later acquired the former five-star recruit. He played for the Kings for the first three seasons of his NBA career. Prior to his 2018–2019 move to the Portland Trail Blazers, he maintained a consistent role.Labissiere averaged 7.2 points and 4.5 rebounds in 17.5 minutes per night while playing in 148 regular season games for Sacramento and Portland. Washington has a $131,970 cap charge, but Labissiere will make $153,330 on his 10-day contract.The 6'10"" player could play for the Wizards for up to six games before his contract expires if he signs before Tuesday's game against Portland. Before getting another chance with the Kings last season, the former Kentucky great played in Puerto Rico and the G League for a number of years.This fall, Labissiere made a comeback to the G League and has been performing admirably for the Capital City Go-Go, a Washington affiliate. With a strong shooting line, he has averaged 19.2 points, 7.7 rebounds, 2.5 blocks, and 2.1 assists in 31.0 minutes per game over 26 games.The 29-year-old has been with the Wizards' G League club for the whole 2025-26 season after being cut by Washington during the preseason. In 30.9 minutes per game, Labissiere has averaged 19.2 points, 7.8 rebounds, 2.3 blocks, 2.3 three-pointers, 2.0 assists, and 0.7 steals. Additionally, in 26 games, he has shot 55.4 percent from the field and 44.1 percent from beyond the arc.While Marvin Bagley (back) and Tristan Vukcevic (hamstring) are both prone to injuries, Labissiere may be a part of the rotation in the near future as starting center Alex Sarr's primary backup.",Skal labissiere signed a 10-day deal with the washington wizards on tuesday.

William Nylander's NHL fine reflects tough league policy on player conduct



Toronto Maple Leafs star forward William Nylander has made headlines for all the wrong reasons after the NHL fined him $5,000 for an obscene gesture he made on live television during a recent regular-season game in Toronto. The controversy, sparked by an obscene gesture on live television during Game No. 819 on Sunday, January 25, quickly went viral on social media.The NHL fined William Nylander on Monday, citing that the player conduct policy is in effect at all times during an NHL game, both on and off the ice. The incident occurred when William Nylander, who was not playing due to injury, made the gesture from the press box during the Leafs’ game against the Colorado Avalanche.William Nylander made the obscene gesture at a television camera operator. In contrast, the broadcast camera was focused on him and the rest of the Maple Leafs players in the press box. The gesture was caught live on television during the broadcast of the game.NHL Senior Vice President of Player Safety George Parros addressed the situation in a formal statement, “Nylander directed an inappropriate gesture at a television camera operator while the camera was directed at Mr.Nylander and his teammates in the press box. The gesture was shown live on-air during the game broadcast,"" he said. “This serves as a reminder that the code of conduct governing players extends throughout the arena at NHL games and in public game situations. ”Nylander, a Swedish international and one of the most productive forwards for the Toronto team this year, has since apologized for the incident on his Instagram story. In his apology, he stated that he regretted the incident, which he claimed was a momentary lapse of judgment due to frustration, but that he still appreciates the support of Leafs fans and hopes to return to the ice soon.Fans on X were very critical of Nylander’s actions, labeling the gesture as unprofessional considering his pay and status as a franchise player. Several fans drew parallels between this incident and other NHL incidents in the past, while others felt that the incident represented a larger issue with the Maple Leafs’ season.Although the fine has officially put the incident to rest from the league’s point of view, it seems that the conversation about player conduct, media attention, and fan expectations in the most intensely watched hockey market in the world is far from over.","The nhl fined william nylander $5,000 for an obscene gesture he made on live television during a recent regular-season game.

Dez Bryant says Davante Adams’ reaction shows pain and hard work behind those tears

Davante Adams, wide receiver for the Los Angeles Rams, stood before reporters with tears in his eyes after his team lost 31-27 to the Seattle Seahawks in the NFC Championship Game on Sunday, January 25, 2026 at Lumen Field in Seattle, Washington. This loss ended the Rams’ season and kept Adams from reaching his first Super Bowl, even after a long and great NFL career.Adams has now lost five NFC title games, four with the Green Bay Packers and once with the Rams and the pain of falling short once again was clear on his face and in his voice. He said the feeling was hard to put into words and that it was “heartbreak” to see his journey end without a chance to play in the biggest game of the season. His honest emotion struck a chord with many fans and former players across the league.Former Dallas Cowboys wide receiver Dez Bryant reacted to Adams’ emotional postgame video on Monday, January 26, 2026, and he spoke in simple, real-talk about what Adams is feeling.Bryant wrote on X that most people don’t understand how much work and belief it takes to chase a Super Bowl.Bryant wrote that from the first day a player dreams of the Super Bowl as a child, to every practice and game, there is hard work and sacrifice behind every moment.He said that Adams had put in countless hours and had to stay confident through the whole season only to have a short chance, sometimes just 17 games to reach this goal.Bryant continued, saying that playing in a Super Bowl means outplaying the best teams and that winning one is a badge of honor no matter who you are.He added, “It’s a lot of pain and sacrifice behind those tears! Adams, first ballot. It’s more to his legacy, and I respect it!” This was Bryant showing support and respect for what Adams has done over his long career.After the Rams’ loss in the NFC title game, Adams spoke to reporters and explained his feelings. He said the moment was tough and that it was hard to think about the future right away.Adams said he was proud of his teammates and how they fought all season, but that it still “sucks” to come up short.In that January 25 game, quarterback Matthew Stafford threw for 374 yards and three touchdowns, and Adams caught four passes for 89 yards and a touchdown. But the Seahawks’ defense made key plays late to keep the Rams out of the Super Bowl.Adams’ career has been full of big moments, six Pro Bowl appearances, multiple All-Pro honors, and many NFL records but a Super Bowl trip still has not come. His emotional reaction and Bryant’s support show just how much this loss means to him.","Davante adams, wide receiver for the los angeles rams, stood before reporters with tears in his eyes after his team lost 31-27 to the seattle seahawks in the nfc championship game on sunday, january 25, 2026.

Gabrielle Union describes the pain she felt as she learnt about Dwyane Wade’s son



What happened between Dwyane Wade and Gabrielle Union in 2013?



Dwyane Wade, the NBA legend, and his wife, popular actress Gabrielle Union , try to live pretty private lives with their only daughter, Kaavia Wade.While the high profile couple is pretty strict about maintaining their privacy, Gabrielle Union has been pretty open about how she felt when she learnt that Dwyane Wade had a child with a friend while the two had split for a while in 2013.A few years ago, in 2021, Dwyane Wade’s wife, Gabrielle Union, wrote in TIME about the things she felt as she learnt about it.Gabrielle Union wrote, ""It should go without saying that we were not in a good place at the time that child was conceived…”The popular actress added, “But we were doing much better when he finally told me about the pregnancy. To say I was devastated is to pick a word on a low shelf for convenience.""Dwyane Wade’s wife, Gabrielle Union, continued, ""There are people — strangers I will never meet — who have been upset that I have not previously talked about that trauma. I have not had words, and even after untold amounts of therapy I am not sure I have them now.""Back in 2013, after dating for a while, Dwyane Wade and Gabrielle Union had broken up for a few months.While the world waited for the two to get back together, the NBA legend ended up fathering a child with a long term friend of his.However, just weeks before Dwyane Wade’s son with his friend was born, he and Gabrielle Union ended up back together.In 2023, Dwyane Wade appeared on Shannon Sharpe’s Club Shay Shay podcast where he revealed that he tried to not get back together with Gabrielle Union as he felt a lot of guilt.But Dwyane Wade and Gabrielle Union’s love and commitment for each other won at the end as they ended up tying the knot just a few months later in 2014.While the high profile couple did go through a rough patch, the two live a comfortable and a happy life now.","Dwyane wade’s wife gabrielle union implied that the pain of the nba legend having a son during their break still haunts her.

What will decide the game

Theare in Philadelphia on Tuesday night for an Eastern Conference game that looks very different depending on who is able to play. Milwaukee is already confirmed to be without Giannis Antetokounmpo, while the 76ers are still deciding on the availability of Joel Embiid and Paul George.Both teams are dealing with injuries that affect how they play on both ends of the floor. With key starters missing or limited, this game could come down to depth, shooting, and who controls the paint.Milwaukee Bucks will be without several rotation players, led by Giannis Antetokounmpo, who remains sidelined with a right calf strain.Without Giannis, the Bucks lose their main scoring option and their best defender. Damian Lillard will handle most of the offense, while Brook Lopez and Andre Drummond will be asked to protect the rim and rebound. Milwaukee’s ability to score inside is limited without Giannis, making outside shooting more important.Philadelphia 76ers enter the night with uncertainty around its top players.Embiid has been managed carefully due to his knee. If he does not play, Andre Drummond or Adem Bona would handle most of the minutes at center.Paul George is dealing with knee soreness and remains day to day. Quentin Grimes’ status matters for perimeter defense and spacing. Tyrese Maxey and Kelly Oubre Jr. would take on more scoring responsibility if either star sits.Over the last three seasons, including 2025-26, the teams have met nine times. Milwaukee holds a 7-2 record in those games. Most matchups have been physical and close, with home court often playing a role. Philadelphia has been harder to beat when Embiid is available.Philadelphia rebounds better and shoots free throws more reliably. Milwaukee shoots better from the field and from three.The result depends on availability. If Embiid plays, Philadelphia controls the paint and forces Milwaukee to defend without fouling. If he sits, the Bucks gain more room to attack inside. Outside shooting and turnovers are likely to decide the outcome late.This game is less about matchups on paper and more about who is healthy enough to execute.","Milwaukee bucks host philadelphia 76ers on tuesday night.

Carlos Alcaraz stood tall at Melbourne Park with a smile and a full heart. The world No. 1 reached his first-ever Australian Open semi-final after a strong win over Alex de Minaur. He won the match 7-5, 6-2, 6-1 and ticked off a big dream in his young career. But this win was not just about tennis. It was also about family.Right after the match, Carlos Alcaraz spoke about his father and how much this moment meant to both of them.

He was asked about having his father and brother with him in Australia. Alcaraz answered with honesty and joy.“It’s great for me,” Carlos Alcaraz said. “Sometimes we make jokes in the locker room. Other players tell me, ‘You can’t play a football match with your team.’ It’s funny, but I need it. I need my team and my people around me.”He explained how his team helps him off the court. “They are the reason I play such great tennis because off the court they make me feel great.They make me feel like I’m at home every single time,” he said.Alcaraz then spoke about his father in an emotional moment. “Having my brother and my dad here, part of my family, my uncle as well, it’s been great,” he said. “Living these kinds of things, it was my dad’s dream when he was playing tennis. I’m really proud to see him living his dream with me.”Carlos Alcaraz has been in strong form all tournament. Even after ending his long partnership with coach Juan Carlos Ferrero in the off-season, his support system stayed strong. Samuel Lopez is now his head coach, while his father and brother Alvaro are also with him in Melbourne.Next, Alcaraz will face Alexander Zverev in the semi-final. Zverev beat him at this venue two years ago. Alcaraz knows the challenge ahead.“I have to increase my level,” Carlos Alcaraz said. “He is playing great tennis, really solid and aggressive. We have to be ready, not only me, but my team as well.”Before the match, Carlos Alcaraz plans to rest.

Why does Sam Malinski’s extension matter for the Colorado Avalanche’s Stanley Cup push?



The Colorado Avalanche secured its blue-line defense by signing Sam Malinski to a contract extension. Malinski has steadily earned the trust of his coaches through his intelligent position play, his reliable performance, and his constant ability to play effectively on both offense and defense. The development of his skills has caused him to become more vital to the Colorado team's extensive defensive unit.He developed his skills step by step after remaining undrafted through his first two years until joining the Bismarck Bobcats in the NAHL and later playing three years at Cornell University before turning professional in 2023. His consistent performance and ability to play important minutes throughout games have established him as a reliable choice for teams competing in the Stanley Cup playoffs.The Colorado Avalanche announced Sam Malinski's four-year contract extension, which carries an annual value of $4.75 million. The current contract for Malinski will finish in the upcoming summer, but the extension will keep his contract active until 2026 with a salary cap impact of $1.4 million for the 2025-26 season.Sam Malinski made his NHL debut in 2023-24, posting 10 points in 23 games, and skated in 76 contests the following year.He played 149 career games through three seasons and scored 11 goals and 49 points.PuckPedia reports that Malinski's contract includes a complete no-trade clause, which lasts for two years and then shifts to a 10-team limited no-trade clause in his third year and a six-team limited no-trade clause in his fourth year. He had been slated to become an unrestricted free agent after 2025-26.Avalanche general manager Chris McFarland praised Malinski's defensive dedication, skating ability, and puck-handling talent by describing him as ""a dependable defenseman who plays for our team."" The Colorado team currently leads the NHL and Central Division with a record of 35-6-9 and they intend to use Malinski's defensive skills during their upcoming match against the Ottawa Senators on Wednesday in Kanata, Ontario.Malinski's extension provides the Avalanche with immediate defensive support through his contract while also delivering long-term value because of his consistent performance development.","Colorado avalanche sign defenseman sam malinski to four-year contract extension.

Philadelphia 76ers vs Milwaukee Bucks Betting and on-court impact (January 27, 2026)

What to watch before tip-off

Theare waiting on a late call withahead of Tuesday night’s home game against the Milwaukee Bucks on. Embiid is listed as questionable because of left-knee injury management, and the team is not expected to decide until close to tip-off.This is a familiar situation for the Sixers. Embiid was given a planned rest day in Monday’s game against the Charlotte Hornets, the first half of a back-to-back. Philadelphia has followed this pattern for the last couple of seasons, often sitting him in one game to manage his knee and keep him available for bigger matchups.Joel Embiid’s status is the main question, but he is not the only Sixer on the report. Paul George is listed as probable with left-knee injury management, while Quentin Grimes is questionable because of a right ankle sprain.Milwaukee enters the game without Giannis Antetokounmpo, who is out with a calf injury. That absence makes Embiid’s availability even more important in shaping how this game plays out.If Joel Embiid does not play, Philadelphia 76ers will rely on Andre Drummond and Adem Bona at center. Tyrese Maxey would be asked to carry more of the scoring load. Drummond has helped in spot minutes this season, but he does not offer the same scoring options, defensive impact, or on-court attention that Embiid brings.If Embiid plays, expect him to be heavily involved.
