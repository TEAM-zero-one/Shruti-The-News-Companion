What’s actually confirmed about Taylor Swift’s attendance

last opportunity to play in a regular-season finale

might be a farewell moment





Whenever the Kansas City Chiefs take the field, one question somehow always pops up online before kickoff: Is Taylor Swift going to be there? With the Chiefs set to face the Raiders, fans are once again refreshing timelines, tracking private jets, and overanalyzing every rumor tied to Travis Kelce ’s biggest supporter. The matchup could mark the final NFL game of Travis Kelce’s 2025 season and possibly the end of his legendary career if he chooses to retire, making Swift’s potential attendance a bigger storyline than usual. So, what is confirmed and what’s just buzz? Here’s the latest.Here’s the important part: there is no official confirmation that Taylor Swift will be at the Chiefs-Raiders game. No statement has been made by her team, the Chiefs, or anyone directly connected to the situation. As of now, there have also been no verified sightings or confirmed reports from credible outlets saying she’s attending.Swift’s name has become a fixture in Chiefs coverage especially at Patriots and Chargers games where she’s appeared in the past and every time Travis Kelce takes the field, alternate timelines of fan speculation start trending. Now, because this Week 18 game may represent Kelce’s, fans online are especially keen to see Swift in the stands. The emotional backdrop is feeding more online theories and increased search traffic as kickoff approaches.The idea isn’t rooted in a confirmed schedule, it’s rooted in pattern recognition (Swift supports Kelce when she can) plus heightened stakes (a possible final game of his career). Rumors and fan theories are spreading on social platforms, with supporters imagining what it would mean for Swift to attend whatin his NFL journey.Even without the Taylor Swift factor, Chiefs vs. Raiders always draws attention. The rivalry brings extra intensity, and every late-season matchup carries weight for the Chiefs and their postseason momentum. Travis Kelce remains a focal point on offense, and his performances naturally keep him and his personal life in the spotlight.Whether or not Kelce retires this offseason, the emotional undertone around this game is palpable. It frames not just his potential final performance but why fans are curious about every detail including the possible presence of Swift.Also read - Hailee Steinfeld shares new pregnancy photos, shows baby bump and ‘Baby Beau’ onesie","Taylor swift is reportedly terriefied because of travis kelce.

Natalya Neidhart’s WWE career and earnings growth

Tyson Kidd’s in-ring success and post-injury WWE role





Natalya Neidhart and Tyson Kidd were born into professional wrestling and WWE universe and have been established since they were 20 years old. Through WWE contracts, television showcases, and decades of steady employment instead of fleeting headlines, both built financial futures. Good record of relevancy, including expanding their combined net worth.Neither is among WWE's top 10 global superstars so far as compensation, at least on the finer points of the evening, but the dollars tell the tale of consistent success for each. Natalya is still appearing regularly, while Tyson Kidd moved into an important backstage position after suffering a career-ending injury. Combined, their earnings have been accumulated with salaries, achievement bonuses, merchandise royalties, and offstage duties not associated with actual wrestling.Natalya Neidhart has had one of the longest, uninterrupted runs in WWE's modern era women's division. Having first debuted on the main roster in the late 2000s, she quickly became a consistent presence on weekly television, premium live events, and overseas excursions. This consistency eventually progressed into an uptick in contract renewals and a small bump in pay every year.ID@undefinedCaption not available.ID@undefinedCaption not available.ID@undefinedCaption not available.The bulk of Natalya's income has traditionally come from a salary she is guaranteed to earn annually, bonuses related to major events, merchandise, and further exposure via WWE-related media. The association with the iconic Hart wrestling family only enhanced her brand value, allowing her to remain relevant throughout almost every era of women's wrestling. Her individual net worth has widely been estimated at around $2 million, a figure based on years of reliable earnings, not temporary highs.Tyson Kidd’s real-life identity is TJ Wilson. He started his career working as an in-ring performer, predominantly as a skilled singles male and tag team wrestler. However, a serious neck injury in 2015 saw his career take a drastic turn when he was forced to stop competing full-time.Instead of releasing him, WWE kept Kidd backstage in a producer and trainer role. It's a role that hardly anyone but hardcore fans will notice, but guarantees employment, stability, and permanence in a company. His continued role in planning matches and developing talent has helped him secure an ongoing source of income, which is reported at $3 million.Combined, Natalya Neidhart and husband Tyson Kidd have a net worth estimated at $5 million. That number represents two decades' worth of WWE contracts, bonuses, royalties, and near-constant employment. Their financial profile is linked to longevity, faith from management, and shifting roles within WWE, the opposite of top-tier superstars, most of whom work based on huge short-term contracts. Their overall wealth is expected to grow in the coming days.Also Read: What is really going on with WWE star Nikki Bella and NFL star Cooper DeJean’s dating buzz on Netflix?","Natalya neidhart and husband tyson kidd have a net worth estimated at $5 million.

Caitlin Clark’s most-awaited recovery and return







With the Super Bowl almost a month away, everyone has their favorites, and so does WNBA’s biggest star, Caitlin Clark. On the recent episode of the “New Heights” podcast hosted by the Kelce brothers, Jason and Travis, the 2024 ROTY winner appeared and sparked a cross-sport debate after naming her favorites for Super Bowl 2026.Though Clark hails from Iowa, she admitted her admiration for the New England Patriots, which is largely influenced by her liking for Patriots star QB Drake Maye. This seemed like a classic case where greatness recognizes and appreciates greatness.The last episode of New Heights for 2025 was anything but not dramatic. In a conversation with Jason and Travis over who is Clark’s favorite to win the next Super Bowl, Caitlin revealed, “I may not be cheering for anybody…but honestly, I am a Drake Maye fan. He’s been incredible.Continuing, she said, “I will probably be pulling for the Patriots, but the Rams are really good too. Sam Darnold seems like a good guy…I could root for him.”Drake Maye and Caitlin Clark began their professional career in 2024 and have been proving to be a cornerstone for their teams. Draye Maye registered a completion rate of 66.6% completing 225-of-338 passes in 2024, over 2,276 yards, and 15 touchdowns.Clark also entered the 2025 season after a historic rookie campaign where she averaged 19.2 points and a league-leading 8.4 assists per game. Though her 2025 season ended early, just after 13 games, due to an injury, the snippets from the USA camp show Clark is healthier and ready to enter the 2026 season with a bang.While the Super Bowl occupies the current headline from who’ll play to who’ll perform at halftime, the Indy fever fans are more concerned with Clark’s physical longevity. Reports suggest her 100% recovery and her focus on strength training to return by the WNBA’s 2026 tip-off. Clark’s return is just not crucial for the Fever, whose offensive strength revolves around her, but also for the league as she’s a walking viewership magnet.In 2025, as per ESPN, across all the 24 post-season games, WNBA delivered its best ever viewership ratings with an average of 1.2 million viewers. The four-most-watched WNBA games of 2025 all featured Caitlin Clark and her team.

LeBron James vs Stephen Curry salary breakdown

The net worth battle between LeBron James and Stephen Curry







LeBron James and Stephen Curry are the Mount Rushmore of modern NBA. They just do not dominate the court with their skills and game IQ, but make a significant impact off the court too. It is still wild to imagine how they both were born in the same hospital. Shocked much? As reported by the Beacon Journal in 2015, both James (1984) and Curry (1988) were born at Akron General Medical Center in Ohio, just a few years apart.These two heavyweights just don’t outshine their opponents on the court, but they also command the financial landscape of NBA. From battling for rings to sharing a bond of trust and respect, LeBron James and Stephen Curry have come a long way and so did their bank accounts. One is a certified billionaire business mogul, while the other is currently the highest-paid on-court performer the league has ever seen.If one just looks at the seasonal paycheck, then Stephen Curry is actually winning. For the 2025–26 season, Steph is pulling in a staggering $59.6 million from the Golden State Warriors, making him the highest-paid player in the league, a record that he has held since 2017-18. But LeBron James isn't exactly lagging, despite his Lakers salary for this season sitting at $52.6 million.The difference is Curry’s art of the ""Supermax."" He was the first player to cross the $200 million contract threshold when he signed a 5-year $201 million deal with the Warriors in 2017. And with his recent veteran extension of $62 million for 1-year, Curry’s on his way to becoming the first NBA player to be paid $62 million for a single season in 2026-27. However, while Steph wins the annual salary race, LeBron still leads in total career on-court earnings, having banked over $580 million since he was drafted back in 2003.This is where the comparison gets steep and the difference wide. LeBron James officially hit billionaire status in 2022 and currently sits at a net worth of approximately $1.3 billion. He didn't get there just by playing ball; he built an empire. Between his lifetime Nike deal (rumored to be worth over $1 billion), his production company SpringHill, and stakes in Fenway Sports Group (which owns the Red Sox and Liverpool FC), LeBron is playing a completely different game off the court.Stephen Curry’s current net worth is estimated at $240 million as of late 2025. While that’s a massive fortune, it shows the difference between being a superstar and being a tycoon. Steph’s wealth is climbing fast, though, thanks to his own Curry Brand, which is now independent after breaking with Under Armour and his Unanimous Media production house. At the end of the day, whether you prefer the King’s power or the Chef’s range, both are proving that the modern athlete is just as much a CEO as they are a point guard.Also read: ""“We emptied the cups”: LeBron James and Bronny James get candid on LA Lakers’ Spill The Tea","Lebron james and stephen curry are the mount rushmore of modern nba.

Brief Scores

Desert Vipers:

MI Emirates:





Third time's a charm. Third time lucky. These are two popular sayings in the English language. It's as if the first two attempts were stumbling blocks, they were launchpads for something that was inevitable. For Desert Vipers, that was the ILT20 title on Sunday at the Dubai Cricket Stadium. Desert Vipers defeated MI Emirates (MIE) by 46 runs in a one-sided final in Dubai.They had been here, under the Ring of Fire, twice and tasted defeated both times.This time, it felt different. Desert Vipers were cut above the rest all season. The Vipers scarcely put a foot wrong, losing just two of their ten matches. Vipers asserted their dominance over MI Emirates twice in in the knockouts, cruising to a 45-run win in Qualifier 1 before outclassing them yet again in the final.When they met MIE once again in the final, they were contesting against not just a team that has triumphed in every T20 league across the world, they were facing a side that was led by a perennial champion in the form of Kieron Pollard The early signs were that things would go away from the Vipers' grasp again.Toss came out in favour of MI Emirates and they chose to field on a surface that has seen the team batting second triumph more often than the first.Andries Gous, the wicketkeeper-batter, who had scored an unbeaten 120 against MIE in the Qualifier, was out with a calf injury.Teams had on an average scored 154.66 runs when batting first at this venue this season. Dubai Capitals had produced the biggest total - 186 against the Abu Dhabi Knight Riders - and gone on to win by 83 runs.Clearly, score big and put things beyond MIE would have been the mantra for the Sam Curran-led Desert Vipers.Three boundaries in four balls in the third over showed that intent from Fakhar Zaman and Jason Roy in the third over. But a few balls later, both perished in the gap of four balls, falling to Fazalhaq Farooqi, and it brought out England's Sam Curran to the middle.Curran, who had seen the team fall short last season, had picked up the leadership duties from Lockie Ferguson. Pollard spoke about Curran's leadership in the chat before the final.“I was reading somewhere about Sam’s leadership, and that he is unbeaten as captain,” Pollard said. “Everything is leaning in his favour, which is a good thing – not just for Sam, but for future reference.”Individually, Curran had been a top performer for his side. Having scored 323 runs from 11 matches, he needed to deliver in this pressure moment, with two wickets falling in quick succession.He took his time to get going. In the first five balls, he failed to get off the mark. And once he did, he blazed four consecutive boundaries. And then there was another lull. He went 13 balls without hitting a boundary, including six dot balls. Then came another four. In the next spell of 21 balls, he hit further three boundaries. Evidently, the objective was to bide time on the low-scoring track.Romario Shepherd's errant deliveries - one full and wide, the other short on middle and off - allowed Curran to relax his arms and tonk two maximums.By the end of it all, Curran remained unbeaten on 74 from 51 balls - it wasn't a gun blazing knock by any stretch of the imagination but it had done the job for the team. From reeling at 36 for 2 in the fourth over, they had reached 182m for 4, helped in part by MIE bowling 11 wides or nearly two more overs.When he got the ball, Curran was smashed for 24 runs from two overs but his teammates had done the job for him. David Payne took 3 for 42, Naseem Shah picked 3 for 18 and Usman Tariq's tricky bowling action and variety fetched him 2 for 20.Maybe this third time lucky, third time's the charm was meant to be. MIE were chasing on the night for a sixth match in a row and had won four times. Both of the two defeats during this run came against Vipers.Curran, deservedly, will take in the applause. As the last wicket fell, he raised his hands, clapped multiple times before embracing his team as the Player of the Match, winner of the Green Belt and Red Belt for second year running.182 for 4 in 20 overs (Sam Curran 74 not out, Jason Holder 41; Fazallaq Farooqi 2/33)136 all out in 18.3 overs (Shakib Al Hasan 36; Naseem Shah 3/18, David Payne 3/42)","Desert vipers defeated mi emirates by 46 runs to win ilt20 season 4.

NEW DELHI: Bangladesh's Mustafizur Rahman has found himself in the spotlight again. On Saturday, the left-arm pacer was released by the Indian Premier League ( IPL ) franchise Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR), following a directive from the BCCI.The decision triggered a strong reaction back home, with the Bangladesh Cricket Board on Sunday announcing that the national team would not travel to India for the upcoming T20 World Cup due to security concerns.While the episode has added a political layer to the story, Mustafizur’s IPL journey extends far beyond the current controversy.Before his brief association with KKR, five IPL franchises had shown faith in the Bangladeshi pacer over the years.Mustafizur made his IPL debut in 2016 with Sunrisers Hyderabad. It turned out to be a breakthrough season.He picked up 17 wickets in 16 matches, conceding runs at an impressive economy of 6.90. His cutters and change of pace made him a key weapon, especially at the death.He returned to SRH in 2017 but featured in just one match due to fitness issues, team balance, and national team commitments.In 2018, Mumbai Indians brought him in, where he played seven games and took seven wickets.Rajasthan Royals signed him in 2021, and Mustafizur delivered another steady season.He claimed 14 wickets in 14 matches, proving his value as a reliable overseas bowler.Delhi Capitals then picked him for multiple seasons.Between 2022 and 2025, he played for DC in three different editions, having taken 13 wickets across 13 matches.His best season with Delhi came in 2025, where he picked up four wickets in just three matches at an economy of 7.90.In 2024, Chennai Super Kings trusted him with a bigger role. Mustafizur responded by taking 14 wickets in nine matches, including a four-wicket haul.Mustafizur has played 60 IPL matches across five teams, taking 65 wickets at an average of 28.44 and a strike rate of 20.9. His best figures remain 4 for 29.KKR had bought him for Rs 9.20 crore after a bidding war at the Abu Dhabi auction. However, following the BCCI’s diktat, the Shah Rukh Khan co-owned franchise released him.While the BCCI did not directly link the move to political tensions, it stated that the decision was driven by “what’s been happening all around”.","Bangladesh's mustafizur rahman released by kolkata knight riders (kkr) decision triggered a strong reaction back home, with the bangladesh cricket board announcing that the national team would not travel to india for the upcoming t20 world cup due to security concerns.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126335997,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-50700,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

Poll Should more awareness be raised about meningitis and its risks? Yes, definitely Maybe No, it's well-known





Former Australian cricketer Damien Martyn has emerged from an induced coma following a serious bout of meningitis, with former teammate and close friend Adam Gilchrist describing the turnaround as nothing short of “a miracle”.The 54-year-old former batter, who played 67 Tests and 208 one-day internationals for Australia, fell critically ill late last month and was rushed to hospital on the Gold Coast, where he was diagnosed with meningitis — a potentially life-threatening inflammation of the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord.Gilchrist confirmed on Sunday that Martyn has now woken from the coma and is responding strongly to treatment.“It’s been an unbelievable turn of events in the last 48 hours,” Gilchrist said. “He is now able to talk and respond to treatment. He has responded extraordinarily well since coming out of the coma to the point where his family feels it’s like some sort of miracle.”According to Gilchrist, Martyn’s condition has improved so rapidly that doctors are hopeful he can soon be moved out of the intensive care unit at Gold Coast University Hospital.“It has been so positive that they’re hopeful he will be able to move out of the ICU into another part of the hospital, which is representative of what a great recovery it’s been and how quickly it has flipped around,” he said. “He’s in good spirits and overwhelmed by the support. There is still some treatment and monitoring to go, but it’s looking positive.”Gilchrist also shared a message from Martyn’s wife Amanda, crediting the outpouring of support from across the cricketing world for aiding his recovery. “She really wants to say to everyone that she is convinced the love, goodwill and sense of care — through messages and media coverage — really helped him,” he said.Born in Darwin, Martyn made his Test debut at 21 during the 1992–93 series against the West Indies. Renowned as one of the game’s finest strokemakers, he became a key figure in Steve Waugh ’s dominant Australian side, scoring 13 Test centuries at an average of 46.37.He was part of Australia’s World Cup-winning teams in 1999 and 2003. Martyn retired during the 2006–07 Ashes series and has largely stayed out of the public eye since.","Former australian cricketer damien martyn has emerged from an induced coma following a serious bout of meningitis.
