NEW DELHI: India ended the T20I series against South Africa on a high by winning the fifth and final match and sealing the five-match series 3-1 on Friday at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad.With this win, India have managed to extend their unbeaten streak. They are now on a streak of 10 consecutive series wins (including major tournaments).With the 4th T20I in Lucknow being abandoned earlier because of heavy fog, everyone wanted to see a full game, and the players didn't disappoint at all.India put up a big total of 231 for 5 after South Africa won the toss and chose to bowl.The batting effort was led by Tilak Varma and Hardik Pandya . Tilak played a steady and attacking knock, scoring 73 runs off 42 balls.Hardik provided the late surge with a quick 63 off just 25 balls, hitting five 4s and five 6s. Sanju Samson and Abhishek Sharma also gave India a strong start at the top.Chasing 232, South Africa began well. Quinton de Kock was in fine form and attacked the Indian bowlers from the start. South Africa matched India’s Powerplay score and stayed in the hunt.When Dewald Brevis joined de Kock, the visitors picked up momentum. The pair played freely and took South Africa to 118 runs at the halfway mark, putting pressure back on the Indian side.At that point, the match seemed evenly balanced. That is when India captain Suryakumar Yadav turned to his most trusted bowler, Jasprit Bumrah . Bumrah made an immediate impact by dismissing de Kock with a sharp return catch. That wicket changed the game.South Africa suddenly lost their rhythm. From 120 for 1, they slipped to 135 for 5 in a short span.The middle order could not recover from the collapse. Varun Chakaravarthy added to South Africa’s problems with an impressive spell, picking up four wickets and breaking key partnerships.While Varun took the wickets, Bumrah’s spell stood out in a high-scoring match. He finished with excellent figures of 2 wickets for just 17 runs in his four overs, controlling the game when it mattered most.South Africa eventually finished on 201/8 in their 20 overs, falling 30 runs short of the target.With this victory, India won the match by 30 runs and closed the series 3-1. Hardik Pandya, who also took one wicket during his bowling, has been named the Man of the Match.",India beat south africa by 30 runs in the fifth t20i in ahmedabad.

'Holy Cow!': Jim Jordan BLASTS Dems On Obamacare Fraud As Clock Ticks On ACA Subsidies

Former US President Barack Obama's annual list of favourite films, music and books has a way of turning personal taste into global buzz. When Prateek Kuhad's cold/mess featured on his 2019 playlist, it made the singer hot property overnight. This year, Obama's reading list has done something rarer still: it has brought together two generations of Indian writing.For 2025, Obama has picked books by Anita Desai and her daughter Kiran Desai . Kiran has already been getting rave reviews for her new novel 'The Loneliness of Sonia and Sunny', with some even dubbing it the Great American Indian novel. It made it to the Booker longlist, nearly 19 years after she won the prize for 'The Inheritance of Loss'. Though it didn't win the prize, the tale of two Indians navigating love and migration in the US resonated with readers.Anita, 88, whose latest novella 'Rosarita' is about a student stumbling on her mother's hidden past in Mexico, has been shortlisted for the Booker three times but never won. Salman Rushdie has called the mother-daughter pair ""the first dynasty of modern Indian fiction."" While their fiction could not be more different, their shared appearance on Obama's bookshelf marks a quiet literary milestone.","Obama has picked books by anita desai and her daughter kiran desai.

Vanessa now manages these finances and makes important decisions about the family’s money. One major gain came from the sale of BodyArmor to Coca-Cola, which brought in a large amount of money for the family.As of 2025, Vanessa Bryant's net worth is estimated to be around $600 million as per Celebrity Net Worth. After Kobe Bryant’s sudden passing in 2020, Vanessa Bryant became the manager of his financial empire that he built, meaning she makes key decisions about how money and investments are handled.

Craig Berube’s brutal 5-word message puts Auston Matthews and Maple Leafs on notice after embarrassing shutout loss,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/craig-berubes-brutal-5-word-message-puts-auston-matthews-and-maple-leafs-on-notice-after-embarrassing-shutout-loss/articleshow/126086854.cms,"Craig Berube calls out Auston Matthews, Maple Leafs following humiliating 4–0 defeat (Getty Images)

Craig Berube sends blunt message after Leafs’ collapse



Craig Berube does not hide behind polite answers. From his first day in Toronto, the Maple Leafs coach made it clear that accountability would not be optional. That approach collided with reality after a humbling night against Washington, when Toronto delivered its most lifeless performance of the season. The scoreboard told part of the story, but the body language told the rest. A proud roster looked disconnected, flat, and short on urgency when it mattered most.The loss also arrived at an uncomfortable moment. The Atlantic Division has offered no mercy, and Toronto’s recent stumble pushed the team toward unfamiliar territory. Expectations remain sky high, especially with a core built to contend now. When the Leafs failed to score for the first time since the spring playoffs, frustration spilled over. Berube did not soften the message, choosing honesty over comfort.After the final horn, attention quickly turned to the effort level of the team’s leaders. Berube’s response was brief, sharp, and impossible to ignore. “Ask those guys, not me,” he told reporters when questioned about the lack of passion, via Sportsnet on X. The comment landed like a slap of cold water. It was not dramatic, but it was deliberate. Berube shifted responsibility squarely onto the room, where it belongs.Auston Matthews sits at the center of that conversation. Through 28 games, his production has been respectable but not commanding. Fourteen goals and nine assists would satisfy many players, yet Toronto expects dominance from its captain. With a $15.2 million salary comes the burden of driving results, not just contributing. Being the fourth-highest point producer does not align with that standard.Still, context matters. Matthews has flashed his usual brilliance in stretches, reminding everyone why he is considered one of the league’s most dangerous scorers. The numbers underline his impact. Toronto owns a strong record when he scores and struggles badly when he does not. His presence shifts momentum, opens space, and fuels belief across the lineup.Berube’s message was not a condemnation. It was a challenge. The coach trusts his stars to respond, and history suggests Matthews will. When he finds his rhythm, the Leafs tend to follow. The season is far from lost, but moments like this often define it. Toronto’s response, starting with its captain, will determine whether this wake-up call sparks a rise or deepens the slide.Also Read: Maple Leafs fans on edge after reporter claims Auston Matthews trade talks may be closer than believed","Maple leafs coach craig berube sent blunt message after humiliating 4-0 loss to washington.

Travis Kelce needs some help with pronouncing Pokémon names while Jason Kelce was nailing the names right off the bat

In the latest promo of the New Heights podcast, Travis Kelce shows off his Pokémon Gold Pack. The Kansas City Chiefs star quietly opens the pack and waits for others to be patient. However, his older brother, Jason Kelce, immediately quips, “Wait, timeout. This is legitimately a Pokémon? You weren’t [----] around? You weren’t a big Pokémon fan. I was the Pokémon fan!” The H-back looks up and defends himself, saying, “Bro, I would out-Pokémon you in a [-----] Pokémon.” The older brother does not give up: “You don’t even know how to play!” Taylor Swift ’s sweetheart slipped into childlike wonder, cutely looking at the card and exclaiming, “What are you talking about? Oh look, Jason,!” Jason, unfamiliar with the name, shrugged and said it must be a new one. “If it’s not in the original 151,” he declared, it doesn’t count. Travis then unveiled a “.” Jason agreed, “That’s an original.” The energy continued as the 35-year-old enthusiast delightedly produced “,” then “.” A few more cards appeared, including “,” which Travis admired, calling it a “sweet card.” With a wave, another card, “,” was shown, encouraging Jason to exclaim, “That’s nice!”Later in the episode’s snippet, the 10-time Pro Bowler presents “” and comments, “Looks like she’s got the BBL going.” BBL stands for Brazilian Butt Lift, a cosmetic surgery that transfers fat from areas like the stomach or thighs to the buttocks for a fuller, rounder, hourglass look. When Travis callsa Pokémon card that looks as if she’s had a BBL, everyone bursts out laughing. The promo ends there. How did the fans react to this promo? Let’s find out.An X user quickly expressed the desire to have this episode every week: “I really do like this segment 🤣 now I need you guys to keep it up every week.” A fan spoke for everyone: ""I'm just flattered that Travis wanted to show us his pokemon s."" Another user suggested an interesting game: “I’d love for them to take up Pokemon Go for awhile and talk about all the random places they go to catch Pokémon.Like around stadiums and such.” A third user focused on how the Kelce brothers pronounced the Pokémon names: “🤣🤣🤣 Trav needs some help with the pronunciation but A for effort. Jason on the other hand was nailing the names right off the bat. Would like to see them play that Whose that Pokémon game and see how many they each get right 🤣🤣🤣. ”The Pokémon names are tricky to pronounce because they blend Japanese linguistic rules, such as adding vowels, with English-friendly sounds. This creates unique compound words from different concepts. For example, PIKACHU = PIKA + CHU. “PIKA” comes from the Japanese word “pikapika,” meaning an electric spark or flash, and “CHU” comes from “chuchu,” the sound a mouse makes. Another example: ARCANINE comes from “arcane” means mysterious and “canine” means dog.Also Read: Kylie Kelce reveals her girls weren’t interested in their first Chiefs home game despite having Taylor Swift beside them","Kansas city chiefs star travis kelce shows off his pokémon gold pack.

Key qualities Ryan O’Reilly offers that could transform Colorado’s championship outlook



Ryan O'Reilly & Dallas Green Talk Music and More Inside Toronto's Massey Hall | After The Horn

The Colorado Avalanche look like a team built for another deep Stanley Cup run, but in a Western Conference that punishes complacency, standing pat is rarely the best option. Even with an incredible 24-2-7 start, Colorado knows its margin for error shrinks the closer the playoffs get. Every contender searches for that one piece that pushes them from “dangerous” to “almost unstoppable,” and Ryan O’Reilly might be that missing piece.Dallas is already breathing down Colorado’s neck despite key injuries, proving how quickly the standings can tighten. That reality makes depth, experience, and playoff composure more valuable than ever. It is exactly why the Avalanche exploring a reunion with O’Reilly makes so much hockey sense.Head coach Jared Bednar wants another reliable center, someone who can anchor tough minutes when the postseason intensity spikes. Jack Drury has worked hard, and Ross Colton has filled gaps when needed, but neither brings the proven playoff pedigree O’Reilly offers. The Nashville Predators veteran knows how to control games, win battles, and step up when it matters most. That is not hype; it is backed by his 2019 Stanley Cup run and Conn Smythe-winning presence with the St.Louis Blues.O’Reilly’s history with Colorado only adds intrigue. Drafted by the Avalanche in 2009, he developed into a respected two-way force before moving on and shaping an impressive career. Now 34 and still productive with 27 points in 33 games, he remains a competitive, responsible, high-IQ player. His recent frustrations in Nashville don’t change that; if anything, they reveal his competitive edge and accountability.Financially, his $4.5 million cap hit and lack of a formal no-trade clause make him a realistic target. Nashville general manager Barry Trotz would likely respect O’Reilly’s input, but the fit is hard to ignore. Colorado gets leadership, faceoff strength, penalty-kill reliability, and a player who elevates when pressure peaks. O’Reilly gets a legitimate shot at another Stanley Cup with the franchise that launched his career.If Colorado truly wants to maximise a championship window that remains wide open, adding Ryan O’Reilly could be the move that transforms a great team into the one everyone else fears to face in hockey.Also Read: https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/nhl-trade-rumors-new-jersey-devils-linked-to-ryan-oreilly-while-edmonton-oilers-show-interest-in-tristan-jarry/articleshow/125920766.cms",Ryan o’reilly has been linked to a return to the colorado avalanche.

C.J. Nitkowski believes market depth is shaping Bo Bichette’s free agency



Blue Jays Trade Rumors: Who’s In, Who’s Out?

C.J. Nitkowski has spent years inside major league clubhouses, and he knows when a quiet market is part of a plan rather than a problem. The former MLB pitcher believes teams this offseason are operating with patience, shaped by depth and long-term thinking. Speaking on Toronto Sports Rush, Nitkowski framed the current free-agent landscape as one defined by options, not urgency.His remarks gained attention because they offered context to a situation that has puzzled many observers. Among the players affected is Bo Bichette, coming off a productive 2025 season. While Bichette’s numbers speak for themselves, Nitkowski’s view suggests the slower pace around his free agency reflects how teams are reading the broader market rather than reassessing the player himself.""The one thing about teams that are looking at Bo Bichette as a second baseman that they know they can keep in mind, is that next year, the second base market is pretty flush,"" Nitkowski said.From Nitkowski’s perspective, that awareness changes how teams behave. Clubs are not just reacting to what is available now. They are weighing what is coming next.""There are some really good options. Nico Hoerner is going to be a free agent.(Brandon) Lowe is going to be a free agent next year.There's a pretty long list.""That expected depth gives teams confidence. When front offices believe alternatives will be available, the need to move quickly fades.""Ozzie Albies, potentially, could be a free agent. There's some pretty good ones. Gleyber Torres out there as well."" With those names in mind, Nitkowski suggested teams may feel comfortable waiting rather than stretching budgets or timelines.""For the teams looking at Bo as a second baseman, I don't think they're going to necessarily overextend themselves, because if they feel like they have another solution, at least short term for 2026, they know there's a really good market out there for 2027.""The takeaway from Nitkowski’s comments is measured but clear. There is little doubt about Bichette’s production with the Toronto Blue Jays. The slower pace has more to do with the market than the player. Teams believe they have alternatives coming, and that belief has allowed them to hold off. Nitkowski views the situation as a matter of timing, not talent.Also read: Why Bo Bichette remains unsigned as the Toronto Blue Jays, Los Angeles Dodgers, and Boston Red Sox make their moves","C.j.

Career night ends in frustration for Rams star

Sean McVay stands by Puka Nacua

Also Read:

Los Angeles Rams wide receiver Puka Nacua once again found himself at the center of controversy following Thursday night’s dramatic loss to the Seattle Seahawks, as frustration over officiating spilled onto social media before being quickly walked back.Despite producing the best game of his young NFL career, Nacua’s postgame reaction overshadowed what should have been a headline performance.Nacua was nearly unstoppable against Seattle, finishing with 12 receptions for 225 yards and two touchdowns. The second-year receiver repeatedly torched the Seahawks’ secondary and played a key role as the Rams built a commanding 16-point lead.However, Los Angeles watched that advantage disappear, eventually falling 38-37 in overtime. A late officiating decision that went against the Rams became a major talking point, drawing visible frustration from players on the sideline and fans watching at home.Shortly after the final whistle, Nacua took to X (formerly Twitter) and appeared to take a jab at NFL officials. “Can you say I was wrong,” he wrote, adding, “Appreciate you stripes for your contributions. Lol.”The post was deleted within minutes, but screenshots spread rapidly, ensuring the message reached a wide audience.The timing and wording were widely seen as a direct reference to a controversial late-game call that helped Seattle extend the contest and ultimately secure the win.When asked about the tweet after the game, Nacua acknowledged that emotions got the better of him. “It was just a lack of awareness and frustration after a tough, intense game,” he said.The wide receiver admitted that while players often feel inconsistencies in officiating, those thoughts should remain internal. “There are comments that I should definitely say in the locker room,” Nacua explained. “My job is to focus on my technique so there’s no issue with the call.”Rams head coach Sean McVay was initially unaware of the deleted post during his postgame press conference, declining to comment on something he had not yet seen. However, McVay has already publicly backed Nacua earlier in the week following separate controversy stemming from a livestream appearance.“I know this guy’s heart,” McVay said previously. “He’s a great kid who’s continuing to learn about the platform that he has. We’re going to put our arm around him and help him grow.”Public criticism of officiating has historically drawn fines from the league, and Nacua’s latest comments could again put him on the NFL’s radar. The situation comes at an awkward time, as the receiver had only just issued an apology earlier in the week for unrelated remarks.For the Rams, the priority remains correcting late-game execution after another painful loss. For Nacua, the message is becoming clearer: his elite on-field performances are undeniable, but staying out of controversy off the field will be just as important as the season progresses.","Los angeles rams wide receiver puka nacua took to twitter after thursday night's loss to the seattle seahawks.

Patrick Mahomes’ injury, surgery, and the timeline Kansas City is now staring at

Randi Mahomes thanked supporters as Patrick Mahomes posted ‘why this had to happen’

Patrick Mahomes is already in rehab after a season-ending left knee injury, and his mom is making it clear she is reading every message that comes in. Randi Mahomes posted public thanks this week after the Kansas City Chiefs quarterback underwent surgery, telling supporters she and her family appreciate the prayers and the words of encouragement.The update lands at the worst possible moment for Kansas City. Mahomes tore his left ACL and LCL in Week 15 against the Los Angeles Chargers, and the loss pushed the Chiefs out of playoff contention for the first time in the Mahomes era.Athlon Sports reported Mahomes suffered the injury against the Chargers and later underwent surgery on Monday. The report said the procedure was performed by Dallas Cowboys head physician and orthopedic surgeon Dan Cooper. Kansas City placed Mahomes on injured reserve, and the quarterback has already begun rehab.The medical timeline matters because it shapes everything the Chiefs do next. Chiefs vice president of sports medicine and performance Rick Burkholder said the recovery expectation is nine months, though it could swing by a month or two in either direction, per USA Today. That puts Mahomes’ 2026 season availability at the center of every offseason decision, even if the team stays quiet publicly.Mahomes’ injury also closes the book on a season where he still produced. Athlon Sports noted he recorded 22 passing touchdowns and five rushing scores in 2025 before the knee gave out. Now the conversation shifts from stats to survival: how Kansas City steadies itself without the player it has been built around, and how quickly Mahomes can get back to full strength.The Chiefs missing the playoffs is the loudest headline. Athlon Sports called the Chargers loss the final blow to Kansas City’s postseason hopes. It is also a rare swing in the Mahomes era. Andy Reid’s teams had been a January constant, and Athlon Sports noted Kansas City reached the Super Bowl five times in the last six seasons, winning three. That is the standard Mahomes and the Chiefs are judged by, and it is why this injury lands like a crisis instead of a routine rehab story.The emotional side of this hit the public right away. TMZ reported Mahomes posted a message on X after the injury report became public, and he did not try to dress it up.“Don’t know why this had to happen,” Mahomes wrote. “And not going to lie, it’s hurts. But all we can do now is Trust in God and attack every single day over and over again.” He also addressed the fan base directly in the same TMZ report.“Thank you, Chiefs kingdom, for always supporting me and for everyone who has reached out and sent prayers. I will be back stronger than ever.”TMZ noted Randi Mahomes shared his message with a heart and prayer emoji, and her own posts kept the focus on gratitude. Athlon Sports reported she wrote a public message while also sharing about her “Home for the Holidays” event for the Kansas City community.“Thank you all for the prayers and kind messages for Patrick. We truly appreciate every one of them,” she wrote.Athlon Sports also reported she added a second note on her Instagram Stories. “Thank you for lifting Patrick up in prayer. We’re so thankful for this community.”That is the cleanest read on the moment. The family is not selling false optimism. They are acknowledging reality, leaning on faith, and keeping the message tight: Mahomes has surgery behind him, rehab in front of him, and a fan base watching every step.For the Chiefs, the next part is not dramatic. It is practical. Mahomes’ rehab is the story now, and the rest of the roster gets judged by how it responds to life without him. The one piece of good news, per Athlon Sports, is that Mahomes is on track to return to full health when the 2026 NFL season comes around. The rest is patience, and nine months can feel like forever when you are Kansas City.",Randi mahomes thanks fans for their prayers as patrick mahomes begins rehab after season-ending knee surgery.

Tagovailoa could learn a lot from watching Rodgers play for a season.

Miami Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa ’s stats scream excellence: five total seasons. two postseason berths. 2022 passing yards leader. 2023 Pro Bowl winner. 2024 NFL completion percentage leader. 17,913 passing yards, 2,393 passing attempts, 1,625 completions, 118 touchdowns, and a 96.2 passer rating so far.

Auston Matthews and the pressure point Toronto cannot ignore

The mood around the Maple Leafs has shifted from confidence to caution. Toronto entered the season expecting its captain to set the pace, yet nights now pass where the scoreboard stays silent for stretches that feel unfamiliar. Auston Matthews still generates chances, still competes hard in all three zones, but goals no longer arrive with the same inevitability. In a market that measures greatness shift by shift, that absence has grown louder than any cheer.What makes this moment heavier is timing. Toronto is not rebuilding or experimenting. This is a team built to win now. When production stalls at the center of that plan, anxiety spreads quickly. Conversations that once felt unthinkable are now whispered openly, not because Matthews has fallen off, but because expectations around him remain sky high.The tension spiked when Leafs reporter Howard Berger suggested the organization will not move forward until Auston Matthews asks for a trade, possibly by this year’s trade deadline. That idea alone rattled the fanbase. Matthews has been the franchise constant for nearly a decade.Imagining Toronto without him feels like pulling a load-bearing wall from the house.On the ice, the frustration has roots. Auston Matthews continues to win faceoffs, backcheck, and handle defensive responsibility. Yet Toronto pays him to swing games offensively. At five-on-five, his line has not consistently owned shifts. On the power play, the dominance that once felt automatic has faded into predictability. The looks are there, but the finish has gone missing.That gap between effort and outcome feeds scrutiny. In Toronto, leadership is judged through goals when the stakes rise. When scoring dries up, every shift becomes a test of authority and legacy. Nick Kypreos tried to strike a more hopeful tone in the Toronto Star, but optimism struggles to breathe when results lag behind reputation.The coaching staff has searched for answers. Different wingers, altered looks, and tactical tweaks have come and gone. The puck still moves well, but the instinctive scoring touch that defined Matthews has not returned with consistency. There is also quiet talk of tension with coach Craig Berube, another layer that complicates an already delicate situation.Trading a captain in his prime is not standard practice. Neither is standing still while doubt grows inside a contender. Toronto management now faces a narrow path where action and inaction both carry consequences. Whether Berger’s report proves prophetic or premature, it captures how fragile this stretch feels.Matthews remains elite. Yet in this market, elite alone no longer settles the noise. The next few months will decide more than standings. They will define how this era is remembered, and whether Auston Matthews and Toronto find clarity together or part under pressure.Also Read: Are Auston Matthews and Craig Berube drifting apart as Maple Leafs struggles spark tense locker-room speculation?","The mood around the maple leafs has shifted from confidence to caution.

Why three-time Super Bowl champion Michael Irvin compares Cowboys’ performance to a ‘failing grade’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/why-three-time-super-bowl-champion-michael-irvin-compares-cowboys-performance-to-a-failing-grade/articleshow/126083937.cms,"Here's what Michael Irvin said about the Dallas Cowboys.

Why three-time Super Bowl champion thinks the Dallas Cowboys are failing



The Cowboys are having a rough season. After a brutal loss to the Minnesota Vikings, the Dallas Cowboys' playoff hopes have been drastically slashed. It’s not impossible for them to be in the playoffs but at 6-7-1, their chances sit at just 1 per cent. Dak Prescott remains hopeful, though Dallas would need an unlikely late-season surge to reach the postseason.Hall of Fame wide receiver and three-time Super Bowl champion Michael Irvin recently spoke about the Cowboys and didn’t hold back when discussing his former team. He appeared on the Dan Patrick Show and offered a blunt assessment of the Cowboys. Dan Patrick asked him to grade the 2025 version of Dallas, and Irvin responded hilariously.“There is no grade to give outside of a failure grade,” Irvin responded. “... I don’t want to hear how many records you broke this year, I don’t want to hear what you did in statistics. I want to hear wins and losses, and are you in the playoffs with a chance to win a ring—and they are not. That’s a failing grade.”Michael Irvin himself of course, has had a legendary run with Dallas Cowboys. He was known as ""The Playmaker,"" and won three Super Bowl rings with the team in the 1990s, as part of ""The Triplets"" with Troy Aikman and Emmitt Smith, in ‘93, ‘94 and ‘96.The Cowboys’ postseason isn’t exactly a shock for the fans. The team’s woes have hung over them for nearly 30 years. Dallas hasn’t advanced beyond the divisional round since its last Super Bowl win in 1995. Cowboys veteran Dak Prescott himself has led the team to the playoffs six times, but the tricky postseason run always seems to get in the way of the team’s ultimate victory.Irvin noted that Dallas has made progress in certain areas this season, and he reminded fans of certain upgrades like the addition of George Pickens and a stronger defensive line. But he still believes the Cowboys should be more proactive and strategic about approaching playoffs and function more cohesively as a team.","The dallas cowboys are 6-7-1 and have a 1 per cent chance of making the playoffs.

University cites contract violations as Smith’s legal team pushes back

Ohio University recently dismissed head football coach Brian Smith after an internal review found that he violated the terms of his employment agreement, a decision that has quickly drawn national attention. The action comes less than a year after Smith was hired and just days before the Bobcats are set to play in a postseason bowl game.According to university officials, the firing was for misconduct they believe damaged the institution’s reputation, reportedly an extramarital affair with a student. Smith (through his attorney) strongly disputes the allegations and says the termination process was unfair. As both sides dig in, the situation has deeply affected the coach, but he is hell-bent on fighting for his innocence.In a statement released Wednesday, Dec. 17, Ohio University confirmed that the 45-year-old coach had been relieved of his duties following what was described as serious professional misconduct. Their statement read, “The termination follows an administrative review of allegations that Smith violated the terms of his employment agreement by engaging in serious professional misconduct and participating in activities that reflect unfavorably on the University.The school also announced that interim head coach John Stauser will guide the team in the 2025 Scooter's Coffee Frisco Bowl against UNLV on Dec. 23. According to reporting by NPR affiliate WVXU, the decision was tied to an alleged extramarital affair between Smith and an undergraduate student.A letter from Ohio University President Lori Stewart Gonzalez referenced contract language allowing dismissal for conduct that brings the coach into “public disrepute, contempt, scandal, or ridicule.” Her letter stated, “This includes your participation in extramarital affairs, including one with an undergraduate student, to which you have admitted.”Gonzalez also cited an additional complaint, writing that Smith was reported to have appeared intoxicated at a public university-related event. Smith’s attorney, Rex Elliott, denied that claim, telling outlets including ESPN and The Columbus Dispatch that his client was never inebriated during any official appearance.Elliott argued that Smith was terminated without a fair chance to respond. He said the relationship involved “consenting adults” and claimed Smith did not know the woman was an Ohio University student. “She was not a member of the athletic department, and Coach Smith could not impact her status in any way as head coach,” Elliott said.Smith, who led the Bobcats to an 8-4 record in his first season after replacing Tim Albin, is now preparing to challenge the decision. Following the announcement, Elliott elaborated that the coach is shocked and disturbed by this turn of events, and they both plan to fight this wrongful termination to protect his integrity and reputation.Also read: Former Saint Joseph’s coach Billy Lange joins New York Knicks coaching staff under Mike Brown",University cites contract violations as smith’s legal team pushes back.

Conor Timmins sidelined six to eight weeks, major setback for Buffalo Sabres blue line



Joseph Woll and Conor Timmins | Blue Room Presented by Rogers

The Buffalo Sabres have been building momentum, and Thursday night’s win over the Philadelphia Flyers looked like another positive step forward. But what should have been a satisfying victory quickly turned concerning when defenseman Conor Timmins suffered a serious injury late in the third period, suddenly shifting the mood around the team and raising immediate questions about Buffalo’s defensive depth for the coming weeks.The moment came with just over five minutes left in regulation. It initially didn’t look like a heavy collision or violent hit, but it quickly became clear that something had gone very wrong. Timmins appeared to catch a rut in the ice, his left leg bent awkwardly, and he went down in obvious pain. The Sabres went on to close out the 5-3 win, but the worry only grew afterward when Lindy Ruff confirmed the severity of the situation.Conor Timmins will likely miss six to eight weeks due to a fractured left leg, head coach Lindy Ruff announced after the game. This is a serious defensive setback for Buffalo. Timmins, 27, signed a two-year contract in the summer and is currently in his first season with the Sabres. He brings stability and experience to the back end. This injury was particularly frustrating for both the player and the team because he was fitting in well and had six assists in 32 games.The timeline means Timmins is likely out until after the NHL’s Olympic break in February, leaving Buffalo without a steady, reliable presence during an important stretch of the season. The Sabres will now need depth defenders to step up, while management may also need to reconsider lineup options as they push to stay competitive.This wasn’t the only concern on the night. Forward Tyler Kozak also left the game earlier with an upper-body injury, and Ruff did not yet have a further update on his condition. Losing two players in one game is the last thing the Sabres needed as they continue to strive for consistency and battle for a spot in the standings. In the coming weeks, attention will now turn to recovery schedules, roster modifications, and Buffalo's reaction to hardship.Also Read: Conor Timmins reunites with Maple Leafs' Bobby McMann and Joseph Woll at Coldplay concert in Toronto","Buffalo sabres defenseman conor timmins suffered a broken leg in thursday's 5-3 win over the philadelphia flyers.

This shows that he needs a fresh start that could help both him and the team. The Kings are open to trading him. But management is said to be willing to wait for the right offer to make sure they get a fair deal.The Montreal Canadiens are one of the most well-known teams that Danault has played for. The New Jersey Devils have also asked about this. Also, hoping to add a proven forward who can help in important situations. The Carolina Hurricanes, on the other hand, are also said to be looking into a possible trade for the skilled center.Mostly because they need more scoring depth and experienced players.As the NHL roster freeze on December 20 gets closer, all the teams involved are expected to finish their trade plans quickly, the Kings have to strike a balance between getting the best deal and keeping their team competitive.Fans and analysts all over the NHL are keeping a close eye on these events.
