Lamar Jackson’s hamstring injury forces last-minute lineup change

“Lamar wanted to be out there. He’s close, but not quite ready.”

Tyler Huntley’s start changes fantasy football outlook



“If you have Derrick Henry, this might be his heaviest workload of the season.”

Lamar Jackson has officially been ruled out for Week 8 after failing to recover from a hamstring injury. The Baltimore Ravens confirmed on Saturday, October 25, 2025, that Jackson won’t play in Sunday’s matchup against the Chicago Bears at M&T Bank Stadium in Baltimore. Head coach John Harbaugh said the team waited until the last practice session before making the final call. With Jackson sidelined, backup quarterback Tyler Huntley will take over as the starter.Lamar Jackson hurt his hamstring during the Ravens’ Week 4 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs on September 28, 2025. Since then, the quarterback has missed three straight games while receiving treatment and doing light workouts.This week, Jackson was limited in practice, which gave hope that he might play. But team doctors did not clear him for full contact, leading to his official scratch on Saturday. Head coach John Harbaugh told reporters after practice,According to NFL Network's Ian Rapoport, the Ravens made the choice late Saturday afternoon after Jackson reported tightness during warm-ups. Baltimore will once more rely on Huntley, who last started a regular-season game in December 2023, absent him.Without Jackson, the Ravens have struggled offensively. The team's average score in games he participated in this year was above 32. Seven points per game they have fallen under in his absence. Sunday's game against the Bears will show if the offense can adjust without its captain under center.Also Read: Travis Hunter And Wife Leanna Share Adorable Family Moment In Matching Black Gymwear With Newborn Son Tyler Huntley will lead the Ravens against the Chicago Bears on Sunday, and this change brings major shifts for fantasy football managers. Huntley, known for his mobility but not deep-ball accuracy, will likely operate a run-heavy playbook. Running back Derrick Henry could see a big boost in touches, especially in red-zone situations.Fantasy expert Matthew Berry told NBC Sports,However, Huntley’s limited passing ability could hurt wide receivers Zay Flowers and tight end Mark Andrews. Both players are expected to get less scoring opportunities and targets.Furthermore, ESPN Fantasy Live analysts observed that Huntley forecasts approximately 150 throwing yards, therefore rendering him a dangerous starting choice in every fantasy league. Until Lamar Jackson comes back, Ravens supporters hope the team can control the game via tough defense and ground control. For now, the offense definitely retreats with Huntley in charge.","Lamar jackson has officially been ruled out for week 8 after failing to recover from a hamstring injury.

Potential Lineup Adjustments Without Chet Holmgren

Holmgren’s Track Record Against the Hawks

’s availability for thematchup against the Atlanta Hawks on Saturday, October 25, 2025, remains uncertain as the young star iswith lower back soreness. The 7-foot-1 center-forward has been a pivotal part of the Thunder’s strong 2-0 start to the season, but his health could influence the team’s early momentum as they look to remain unbeaten.As per the NBA’s official injury report, Chet Holmgren continues to experience discomfort in his lower back, prompting the Oklahoma City Thunder to exercise caution. The issue appears to have surfaced after he logged heavy minutes in Oklahoma City’s first two contests, both of which extended into overtime or double overtime.In Thursday’s thrilling win over the Indiana Pacers, Holmgren put in a tremendous effort, playing 39 minutes while recording 15 points, 12 rebounds, 2 assists, and 2 steals. With that much court time early in the season, the Oklahoma City Thunder’s medical team is closely monitoring his workload.Head coach Mark Daigneault and the training staff are expected to make a final call closer to tip-off at 7:30 p.m. ET (5:00 a.m. IST). Fans should keep an eye on pregame warm-ups for any sign of Chet Holmgren’s participation, as his status is expected to come down to a game-time decision.Despite starting the season as defending NBA champions and securing two impressive wins, Oklahoma City’s depth is already being tested. In addition to Holmgren, Cason Wallace (knee sprain) is also questionable for the matchup.Meanwhile, Alex Caruso (concussion protocol), Isaiah Joe (knee contusion), Jalen Williams (recovering from wrist surgery), and Kenrich Williams (knee injury) have all been ruled out.This stretch leaves Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, the reigning MVP, shouldering much of the offensive responsibility once again. Gilgeous-Alexander has been electric to start the year, dropping 35 points against the Rockets and a remarkable 55 points against the Pacers. However, Holmgren’s absence would significantly impact OKC’s defensive structure and spacing, particularly against a Hawks frontcourt anchored by Kristaps Porzingis and Jalen Johnson.If Chet Holmgren is unable to play, Daigneault may rely on Isaiah Hartenstein or Jaylin Williams (if available) to absorb the center minutes. While Hartenstein offers hustle and rebounding, he lacks Holmgren’s elite shot-blocking and perimeter shooting abilities. Losing Holmgren would also hurt the Oklahoma City Thunder’s ability to defend the Hawks’ pick-and-roll schemes, orchestrated by Trae Young.Without their rim protector, Oklahoma City’s defense may be forced to collapse more frequently inside, potentially leaving shooters like Bogdan Bogdanović and De’Andre Hunter open from the perimeter. The Thunder would not only lose a physical edge but also a psychological one, as Holmgren’s presence in the paint often alters opponents’ offensive rhythm.Historically, Holmgren has performed well against Atlanta, averaging 15.0 points, 7.0 rebounds, and 2.8 assists across four career games. His combination of size, mobility, and shooting range has made him a matchup challenge for the Hawks’ bigs, and Oklahoma City will hope he can replicate that success if cleared to play.As of now, Chet Holmgren remains questionable for Saturday’s contest, though there’s optimism he could be cleared if he passes pregame evaluations. The Oklahoma City Thunder are likely to take a balanced approach, prioritizing Holmgren’s long-term health while aiming to maintain their early-season rhythm.If he’s able to suit up, Chet Holmgren’s return would provide a huge boost to Oklahoma City’s frontcourt and defensive identity. If not, expect the Thunder to make tactical adjustments to compensate for the absence of their versatile young big man.Also read: Oklahoma City Thunder vs Atlanta Hawks injury report (October 25, 2025): Who,s playing, who's out, and more In short: Holmgren is questionable but trending toward a game-time decision due to lower back soreness as the Oklahoma City Thunder prepare to face the Atlanta Hawks.","Oklahoma city thunder’s chet holmgren continues to experience discomfort in his lower back.

FBI’s investigation sends shockwaves through the NBA as hidden ties begin to unravel

The gambling probe that had landed Terry Rozier , Chauncey Billups, and Damon Jones in hot water has sent the NBA universe into a frenzy. FBI and Department of Justice have already started the investigation. Meanwhile, former NBA referee Tim Donaghy has entered the controversy. He recently said that he is not shocked a former NBA player and coach was among the 30 individuals arrested as a result of the federal investigation.Donaghy was asked if celebrities could be implicated in the unfolding controversy during his appearance on Patrick Bet-David's ""PBD Podcast"" on Friday. He started by outlining the characteristics of wire fraud. He said:“When you talk about wire fraud, that’s a law that can be applied to many different things.. If you’re just calling your buddy and telling him that somebody’s not playing, even if it’s a nonchalant comment, transferring that over state lines is wire fraud.”For context, in 2008, Donaghy pleaded guilty of wire fraud and distributing betting information after receiving thousands of dollars from a gambler in exchange for insider game tips. He was sentenced to 15 months in jail.He appeared on ""CUOMO"" to talk about the Mafia, the arrest, and the suspected involvement of Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier and Portland Trail Blazers head coach Chauncey Billups. Hence, he said:“Definitely not surprised with what’s going on.I think this is just the tip of the iceberg.”The former referee then went on to describe how players may inadvertently get into trouble for simply talking to their friends. He further said:“There’s no doubt in my mind that some of these star players must’ve been saying something to their buddies back home … and bets were placed and money was made.”In fact, he further said that he thinks a worse gambling scandal could happen at the collegiate athletic level. He then said:“You have these young athletes that aren’t going to make it to the next level, and somebody is going to offer them money to maybe fix a game and only win by 12 rather than 15, and they’re going to take that money because they’re going to need a way to support their family.”Tim Donaghy went on to say that the continuing betting controversy will only become worse over time. He talked about the group of the players who have already been detained, implying that this will result in additional arrests. He said:“These guys that are arrested are going to sit down, be scared to death, and cooperate.. This is going to spread like wildfire and it’s a lot bigger than it is right now.""According to prosecutors, Billups is accused of a broad conspiracy to rig underground poker games linked to the La Cosa Nostra criminal family.Four NBA clubs have been discovered as participating in games as a result of the FBI's thorough investigation into illegal sports gambling. Portland Trail Blazers coach Chauncey Billups, Miami Heat forward Terry Rozier, and numerous others were charged with federal offences on Thursday as part of a large-scale investigation into illegal sports gambling and poker rigging schemes allegedly backed by the Mafia.According to the investigators, the whole thing had an impact on games played by the Charlotte Hornets , Toronto Raptors, Los Angeles Lakers, and Portland Trail Blazers. NBC News reported that the two were taken into custody on Thursday.Rozier is currently under investigation by federal authorities for allegedly operating the illegal sports betting operation. At a press conference, FBI Director Kash Patel stated that the unprecedented federal takedown on charges of wire fraud, money laundering, extortion, robbery, and illegal gambling resulted in the arrest of over 30 people across 11 states.Also read: Terry Rozier net worth: Miami Heat player's NBA journey takes an unexpected turn as he finds himself at the center of a gambling storm","Chauncey billups and terry rozier are among other nba players arrested for illegal gambling.

Game Details and Betting Outlook Memphis Grizzlies vs Indiana Pacers (October 25, 2025)

Projected Memphis Grizzlies Starting Lineup (If Morant Plays)

fans are anxiously awaiting confirmation on whetherwill take the court tonight as the team prepares to face the Indiana Pacers at 8:00 PM ET inside FedExForum. After an injury scare and a rough outing in Miami, the superstar guard’s availability has become one of the biggest talking points heading into this matchup.The latest update brings encouraging news - Ja Morant is not listed on the official injury report for tonight’s contest. That’s a strong indication the two-time All-Star is expected to play. Morant had been dealing with left ankle soreness during Friday’s 146-114 blowout loss to the Miami Heat, where he looked far from his best. The 26-year-old was questionable heading into that game but pushed through the pain to suit up, displaying the determination that has defined his young career.Despite playing through the soreness, Morant’s performance raised eyebrows as he struggled to find rhythm offensively. It was a sharp contrast from his dominant season opener just days earlier.Ja Morant’s first two performances of the season have told completely different stories.In the opener against the New Orleans Pelicans, he erupted for 35 points on 13-of-20 shooting, leading Memphis to a thrilling 128-122 victory. Against Miami, however, the explosive point guard was nearly unrecognizable. He finished with just 12 points on 4-of-16 shooting, along with 2 rebounds and 6 assists in 22 minutes.The noticeable drop in efficiency may have been due to his ankle discomfort. While Ja Morant hasn’t directly addressed whether the soreness limited him, it’s evident that his usual burst and explosiveness were missing in Friday’s loss.When asked if he’d be available for the Pacers matchup, Morant remained vague, responding simply with “We’ll see.” Still, his competitive spirit was evident when he added, “I want to play every night. Every day of the week.” That quote perfectly captures his mindset - one rooted in resilience and a relentless drive to compete, even through adversity.This determination isn’t surprising for a player who continues to make history. Just earlier this week, Morant joined Michael Jordan in an exclusive club for season-opening performances featuring 35 or more points on 65% shooting.The Memphis Grizzlies are facing a difficult decision with Morant’s workload. After logging just 22 minutes in Friday’s loss, Memphis’ medical staff must weigh the benefits of letting him play again on a back-to-back night against the risk of aggravating his injury.The relatively low minutes he played against Miami might help his case to be cleared for tonight, giving him a realistic chance to feature. Both Ja Morant and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, who was also dealing with right ankle soreness, played limited minutes Friday and could both suit up again if their conditions hold steady.Beyond Ja Morant’s status, Memphis continues to deal with a long list of injuries. Five players are confirmed out for tonight’s matchup:• Zach Edey – left ankle surgery recovery• Scotty Pippen Jr. – left great toe surgery recovery (12 weeks)• Brandon Clarke – right knee surgery recovery• Ty Jerome – right calf strain• Vince Williams Jr. – right heel sorenessThis depleted rotation places even more pressure on Morant to be available. With several key contributors sidelined, the Memphis Grizzlies need his scoring and playmaking more than ever against an Indiana team still looking for its first win of the season.The Indiana Pacers head into this matchup with plenty of motivation after falling in a double-overtime thriller to the Oklahoma City Thunder in their opener. Pascal Siakam led the charge with 32 points and 15 rebounds, while Benedict Mathurin exploded for 36 points in the losing effort.The Pacers also have their own injury woes, missing several important players — including Tyrese Haliburton, who’s out for the season with an Achilles injury. Andrew Nembhard (shoulder) and T.J. McConnell (hamstring) are also sidelined, forcing Indiana to lean heavily on Siakam and Mathurin once again.Tip-off is scheduled for 8:00 PM ET at FedExForum, with the game airing on FanDuel Sports Network. Betting markets reflect the uncertainty surrounding both teams’ health situations. Memphis enters as slight 1-point favorites, with the total set at 237.5 points.The Memphis Grizzlies’ defense has been a concern early in the season, allowing an average of 134 points through their first two games. That defensive lapse could provide the Pacers with an opportunity to find offensive rhythm and potentially steal a road win if Morant’s mobility remains limited.• PG: Ja Morant• SG: Kentavious Caldwell-Pope• SF: Jaylen Wells• PF: Jaren Jackson Jr.• C: Santi AldamaWhile the final confirmation will come closer to tip-off, all indicators suggest that Ja Morant will be available tonight against the Indiana Pacers. His omission from the latest injury report and his own insistence on playing whenever possible point toward a likely return to the lineup.The key question isn’t whether he’ll play - it’s how effectively he can perform while managing his ankle soreness. Memphis needs their franchise cornerstone to rediscover his early-season form after Friday’s uncharacteristic struggles.Also read: Is LaMelo Ball playing tonight vs Philadelphia 76ers?

Tom Brady shares honest feelings on his statue

Tom Brady’s Patriots legacy and career after retirement

Tom Brady is not used to standing still while people cheer for him. But on August 8, 2025, at Gillette Stadium in Boston, Massachusetts, the New England Patriots gave their biggest legend one more unforgettable moment. The team unveiled a 12-foot bronze statue of the quarterback during a ceremony honoring his induction into the Patriots Hall of Fame. Speaking later on the “Almost Athletes with Dude Perfect” podcast, which aired on Wednesday, Tom Brady said he was thankful but also admitted the statue felt a bit strange to him.Tom Brady said the tribute was a beautiful gesture from Patriots owner Robert Kraft and the whole organization. He told the podcast hosts,He said he hoped his years in New England helped shape the community and gave fans and young athletes something positive to look up to.“All those kids now who were part of that growing up and watching how Rob Gronkowski, Tedy Bruschi, Wes Welker, Julian Edelman, Deion Branch, and Randy Moss handled success with class and respect—they have a good example for how to do that,” he added.Still, Tom Brady laughed while explaining that getting a statue while alive felt odd.The statue, standing at 12 feet, was built in honor of the No. 12 jersey Brady wore for 20 seasons in New England.Also Read: Justin Jefferson Reportedly Furious After Vikings’ Crushing Loss To Chargers Sparks Trade Rumors And Fan Outrage Online The New England Patriots picked Tom Brady in the sixth round of the 2000 NFL Draft.

Supporting Tua Tagovailoa through tough times

Miami Dolphins wide receiver Tyreek Hill is facing a tough decision after a serious knee injury ended his season in Week 4 against the New York Jets. Hill, 30, has had two huge seasons with Miami, including a league-leading 1,799 yards in 2023, but now he’s not sure if he’ll return to the field next year. Hill got hurt in the third quarter when his left knee twisted awkwardly as he was tackled near the Jets’ sideline after making a catch. The injury immediately ended his season, leaving both him and the Dolphins unsure about the future — even though his contract with Miami runs through next season.On teammate Terron Armstead’s podcast, Hill opened up about how he will decide whether to come back. “At the end of the day, I feel like that decision is based on how I feel and where my mindset is at the moment,” he said. “I'm happy with the career that I've had. I love playing football, but it takes a lot — mentally and physically.” He also shared how he reacted in the moment he got hurt. “When I got tackled, I tried to get up and saw my leg was crooked. I just started laughing because I’ve been able to play this game for 10 years — my entire life, really — and I’ve been blessed with great talents and support from my family,” Hill said. “I wasn’t even thinking about the injury, just about all the great moments I’ve had playing this game.”Hill won a Super Bowl with the Kansas City Chiefs in 2020 and has become one of the league’s most explosive receivers.Even as Miami has struggled this season, dropping to 1–6 after a loss to Cleveland, Hill remains confident in the team and supportive of quarterback Tua Tagovailoa. “Everybody’s apparently on the hot seat. It’s a tough situation, but I’ll support Tua no matter what because that’s my brother,” Hill said. “He wants to win — and that should show people his commitment.”With Hill out, the Dolphins will need to adjust their offense while he takes time to heal and think about his future. His decision will depend on both his physical recovery and how he feels mentally about continuing his career.","Tyreek hill is facing a tough decision after a serious knee injury ended his season.

take on the Charlotte Hornets on October 25, 2025. The reigning NBA MVP was not listed on the team’s latest injury report, signaling that his recovery from offseason knee surgery continues to progress well.Joel Embiid’s status for the Sixers’ home opener at the Xfinity Mobile Arena is fully active. Head coach Nick Nurse, however, is expected to handle his playing time with caution. Similar to the season opener against the Boston Celtics, Embiid will likely be limited to around 20–25 minutes as the team prioritizes long-term durability after back-to-back knee surgeries over the past two years. The Sixers are determined to manage their superstar’s health throughout the lengthy campaign.Joel Embiid’s return game against Boston wasn’t his sharpest, finishing with just 4 points on 1-of-9 shooting along with 6 rebounds and 2 assists in 20 minutes. Despite the poor shooting performance, his leadership and defensive presence were vital in stabilizing the team during key stretches. Philadelphia 76ers’ offense was carried by rookie sensation V.J. Edgecombe, who exploded for 34 points in his NBA debut, and Tyrese Maxey, who dropped 40 points to lead the Sixers to a commanding victory over their Eastern Conference rivals.While Embiid is back in action, the Philadelphia 76ers are still short-handed. Paul George remains out as he continues to recover from left knee surgery, though his return to practice suggests he could debut soon. Jared McCain is sidelined after thumb surgery, and Trendon Watford is unavailable due to a hamstring injury. On a more positive note, rookie Justin Edwards is listed as probable with rib soreness. Philadelphia 76ers is expected to roll with a starting lineup of Tyrese Maxey, V.J. Edgecombe, Kelly Oubre Jr., Dominick Barlow, and Joel Embiid.Tonight’s matchup serves as an intriguing early-season test between two promising Eastern Conference squads. The Hornets arrive in Philadelphia fresh off a 136–117 win over the Brooklyn Nets, led by LaMelo Ball, Brandon Miller, and Miles Bridges.

“I just stuck my head in to see how our quarterback was doing … In no way would I want a player to come back out there that wasn’t ready to play.”

NFL’s concussion policy under scrutiny after Brian Daboll and Cam Skattebo violation

“created the perception”

On October 24, 2025, the New York Giants were hit with heavy fines after head coach Brian Daboll and rookie running back Cam Skattebo violated the NFL concussion-protocol rules during their Week 6 game versus the Philadelphia Eagles. The incident occurred on October 9, 2025, at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, when rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart was escorted to the blue medical tent for a concussion check. While Dart was receiving care, Daboll and Skattebo entered the tent area, a zone reserved only for medical staff prompting the league and the players’ union to act.During the third quarter of the game, Jaxson Dart was sacked and held his head on the ground. He was taken to the sideline medical tent for a concussion evaluation. The NFL and NFLPA found that Brian Dabollthe tent and Cam Skattebo subsequently entered and spoke with Dart before his evaluation was complete, actions that constituted a perception of interference.Although the review stated neither Daboll nor Skattebo actually disrupted Dart’s exam or care, their presence violated the policy that “only medical personnel deemed essential to the care of the athlete” may be present during such evaluations.As a consequence, Daboll was fined $100,000, Skattebo $15,000, and the Giants organization faced a $200,000 fine. After the incident, Brian Daboll publicly apologised, explaining:Also Read: “Jaxson Dart Is A Better Player”: Brian Daboll Faces Ruthless Decision After Russell Wilson Pushes Back Against Quarterback Challenge This situation highlights the strictness of the NFL’s concussion-protocol rules, which are in place to protect players like Jaxson Dart and uphold independence in medical evaluations.The league’s joint statement from the NFL and NFLPA emphasised that while Dart’s care was properly managed, the actions of Brian Daboll and Cam Skatteboof interference and therefore violated the protocol.In response, the New York Giants have moved to implement additional staff training and tighter access controls to avoid similar mistakes.Meanwhile, the Giants’ upcoming rematch with the Eagles has extra attention now, not just for the game result, but with this off-field issue fresh in mind.

Giants fined for violating NFL concussion protocol



League enforces accountability amid concussion concerns



The New York Giants have been slapped with hefty fines after breaching the NFL ’s concussion protocol during quarterback Jaxson Dart’s medical evaluation against the Philadelphia Eagles. The league and the NFL Players Association jointly announced the penalties on Friday, totaling $315,000 in fines. The Giants were fined $200,000, head coach Brian Daboll received a $100,000 penalty, and running back Cam Skattebo was fined $15,000 for conduct deemed detrimental to the league.The incident took place on October 9 at MetLife Stadium, midway through the third quarter when rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart was sacked and remained down on the field, holding his helmet. Following standard concussion procedures, Dart was escorted to the team’s blue medical tent for an evaluation by both the team’s medical staff and an independent neurotrauma consultant.However, the league’s review later revealed that Brian Daboll approached the tent and briefly stuck his head inside, while Cam Skattebo entered the tent before the evaluation concluded. Under the NFL’s concussion protocol, only essential medical personnel—such as the club physician, athletic trainer, and independent consultant—are allowed to be present during a player’s examination.A joint NFL–NFLPA statement said the coach and player’s actions “created the perception that they were interfering with Dart’s exam.” Although the investigation found no evidence that either man influenced the evaluation or Dart’s medical care, it concluded that “their conduct was inconsistent with and demonstrated a disregard for the concussion protocol’s requirements and therefore constituted a violation. ”Daboll was seen speaking animatedly with team doctor Scott Rodeo while waiting to learn if Dart would be cleared to return. After the game, Daboll said he only wanted to check on his quarterback’s condition and determine if a timeout was needed before a potential fourth-down play. Still, the league considered his action a breach of established medical boundaries.The NFL emphasized that the Giants’ medical staff properly followed all the necessary steps of the concussion protocol. The organization has since introduced remedial measures, including refresher training for players and staff, and new access rules to ensure only authorized individuals enter the medical tent during an evaluation.The league said these corrective actions were considered when determining the fines.The NFL’s concussion protocol remains a closely watched area of league policy, particularly following high-profile incidents like Tua Tagovailoa’s head injury in 2024. The joint NFL–NFLPA system conducts automatic reviews of all potential breaches to safeguard player health and ensure compliance.Dart later cleared all return-to-play procedures and finished the game, helping the Giants secure a 34–17 victory over Philadelphia.Despite the controversy, Daboll took full responsibility for his mistake, admitting he expected the fine but emphasizing his concern was purely for Dart’s well-being—a costly but crucial reminder of the boundaries set by the league’s player safety protocols.Also Read: “She treated us like gold"": What Travis Kelce’s coach experienced while meeting Taylor Swift shows why everyone loves her so much","Giants, brian daboll and cam skattebo fined for violating nfl concussion protocol in jaxson dart case.
