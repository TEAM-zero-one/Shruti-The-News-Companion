IND vs ENG: Gautam Gambhir loses cool during heated exchange with ground staff at The Oval ahead of 5th Test

Poll Do you agree with R Ashwin's criticism of Shubman Gill's captaincy? Yes, he lacks experience. No, he will improve over time. Partially, he needs to adapt. Not sure.

Former India off-spinner R Ashwin has slammed captain Shubman Gill and coach Gautam Gambhir for a ""lack of game awareness"" in the ongoing Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy.Bad light and subsequent rain forced stumps to be called early on Day 4 of the fifth Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy Test at The Oval on Sunday. With the stage set for a thrilling Day 5, England need just 35 more runs to win, while India require four wickets for a miraculous victory.""Coming back to the topic of spinners not being used, I have felt in this series that there has been a lack of game awareness and, in many ways, our tactical acumen — both on and off the field. This is the main reason why England are ahead in this series and India are behind. We haven't been the sharpest,” Ashwin said on his YouTube channel Ash Ki Baat.“I feel Shubman Gill will get much better as a captain. He will learn. But sometimes, if you feel that you can play spin really well, you might not bring spinners into the attack. And when you miss the right moment to introduce spinners in these conditions, they become a defensive option,” he added.Rain forcing the match into the fifth day means every Test of the riveting five-match series has now gone into the final day. England looked all set to complete the chase of 374 on Day 4, thanks to Joe Root hitting his 39th Test century — 105 off 152 balls — paying a fitting tribute to Graham Thorpe.His fellow Yorkshireman Harry Brook struck a stunning 111 off 98 balls — his tenth century in the longer format — and made the most of a crucial reprieve on 19, dropped by Mohammed Siraj. Root and Brook shared a brilliant counter-attacking stand of 195 runs, giving England real hope of completing their second-highest run chase of all time — and the highest ever at The Oval.“When Harry Brook started taking it on, after 20 runs, you could have brought on the spinner to choke the run flow. From the other end, a pacer could have bowled. With all this in mind, Washington Sundar could have been introduced earlier into the attack,” Ashwin said.“Making these mistakes creates a huge gap. We don’t know whether the message is going from outside to the middle. We don’t know what’s being discussed in the dressing room. But in today’s day and age, these mistakes can definitely be avoided,” he added.","Former india off-spinner r ashwin has slammed captain shubman gill and coach gautam gambhir for a ""lack of game awareness"" in the ongoing anderson-tendulkar trophy.

Jayden Daniels isn’t fazed by criticism over his mom’s presence



A mother’s watchful eye isn’t holding him back — it’s helping him soar



Jayden Daniel’s Mom Explains To Ryan Clark Why She’s So Protective Of Her Son

For most young men stepping into the NFL spotlight, image is everything. But for Jayden Daniels, authenticity means more than optics. Over the past year, he’s faced a wave of online criticism — not for his performance, but for always having his mom, Regina Jackson, by his side. While some call it overprotective, Daniels sees something else entirely: unconditional love. And rather than distance himself, he’s standing tall beside her — not just as her son, but as a grown man who knows the value of her presence.While social media trolls continue to poke fun at Regina Jackson’s ever-present role in Jayden Daniels’ life — including viral moments like her third-wheeling on a dinner date or the now-famous Juju Watkins “vibe-killer” episode — Daniels doesn’t see her involvement as intrusive. He sees it as essential.“She’s a mom first. She’s always going to be there to uplift me. But if I’m doing wrong, she’s going to let me know. So, even though I’m 24 years old, I’m still a grown man, but I still gotta listen to my mom at some point,” Daniels said in an interview with the NFL Network.Rather than resenting her vigilance, Daniels appreciates it. Regina knows the risks that come with being a rising NFL star — from unwanted attention to possible exploitation — and she’s not about to sit back and watch her son be vulnerable.The criticism labeling her as a “helicopter parent” only underscores the double standards placed on protective mothers in the public eye.And while internet comedians have their laughs, Jayden Daniels continues to grow both as a player and a person, rooted in the firm guidance of his mother.Regina Jackson wasn’t just present during the interview — she was beaming nearby, proud of the man her son has become. “I’m very proud of him. The athlete, and the man you guys see… You always need your mommas around,” she said, capturing what many often forget — family is often the cornerstone of greatness.Research supports the value of this kind of parent-child bond. Sons raised with emotional support from their mothers often exhibit stronger decision-making, healthier relationships, and better mental health. Daniels is a living testament to that. Calm under pressure, focused, and respectful, he’s proving that emotional security isn't a liability — it's a competitive edge.In a world quick to judge, Daniels reminds us that sometimes, strength comes from knowing who you can always count on — even if it’s your mom sitting beside you during dinner. Now, Daniels is showing what a leadership looks like and should be, that was not seen in the last season.Also Read: Hailee Steinfeld's latest workout photos break the internet as Josh Allen returns to Bills camp","Jayden daniels has faced criticism for always having his mom, regina jackson, by his side.

Brock Lesnar returns to WWE at SummerSlam 2025



Undisputed WWE Championship, Street Fight: John Cena vs. Cody Rhodes was action-packed



Brock Lesnar has been a topic of discussion before every main event in WWE , amid his absence, with speculation of his return to the roster always imminent. Now, the Beast has ended all the speculation once and for all, as he made his big return to the company to deliver an F5 to John Cena , teasing a future fight between the two WWE veterans.In a shocking twist at the end of WWE SummerSlam 2025 – Night 2, Brock Lesnar made his thunderous return to WWE, ending months of speculation about his future. Just moments after Cody Rhodes defeated John Cena in a brutal, action-packed Street Fight to win the Undisputed WWE Championship, Lesnar stormed the scene. He circled the ring like a predator before hoisting Cena onto his shoulders and planting him with a devastating F5.For nearly a year, Lesnar had been absent from WWE programming, fueling rumors about retirement or a possible departure. His name had surfaced in the Janel Grant lawsuit involving Vince McMahon, leading WWE’s top legal brass to pull him from television. As reported by Dave Meltzer, the decision came “at the highest level of the company’s legal department” (per wrestlingnews.co). But with his appearance at MetLife Stadium on August 4, Lesnar reignited his long-time rivalry targeting Cena.The crowd erupted in disbelief as Lesnar's music hit.Cena, still recovering from his emotional torch-passing moment with Rhodes, didn’t see it coming. Lesnar's F5 was a challenge thrown at WWE legend’s legacy.SummerSlam 2025’s second night was already stacked with six championship matches, and the main event did not disappoint. Cody Rhodes and John Cena delivered a violent masterpiece of near-falls, finishers, and raw emotion. Cena used crutches from NBA star Tyrese Haliburton as weapons. Rhodes answered with classic Dusty-style offense, including the Bionic Elbow. Tables shattered. Steel steps flew. Fans were on the edge of their seats when Cena countered a title shot attempt and nearly sealed it with a super AA.But in the end, it was Rhodes who overcame the odds, surviving multiple Attitude Adjustments and finally hitting a flying Cross Rhodes through a table for the pin. Cena, in a rare display of humility, handed over the title and whispered heartfelt words to the new champion.Also Read: WWE SummerSlam 2025 crowd turns hostile as camera caught wild fight between women breaks out during Night Two As fans thought the night had reached its emotional peak, Lesnar's return altered the narrative. “The Beast” didn’t need words, as with his silence, the F5 said it all.

Public relations risk keeps teams like Oilers away from Carter Hart amid unresolved eligibility

The NHL future of Carter Hart remains shrouded in uncertainty, even after his acquittal in the high-profile Hockey Canada sexual assault case. While fans continue to debate whether the former Philadelphia Flyers goalie deserves another shot on the ice, NHL insider Elliotte Friedman has strongly advised against making any assumptions.Five members of Canada’s 2018 world junior hockey team were found not guilty of sexual assault, ending months-long trial that has garnered national attention since it began in April. Michael McLeod, Carter Hart, Alex Formenton, Dillon Dubé and Cal Foote were acquitted of all charges by Ontario Superior Court Justice Maria Carroccia.Speaking on his 32 Thoughts podcast, Elliotte Friedman addressed the growing speculation around Hart’s potential return to the league. Despite being found not guilty along with four other players in the 2018 Hockey Canada case, Hart’s status remains unresolved in the eyes of the NHL.“I think it is really irresponsible to speculate until we have a legal ruling on this,” Friedman said. “I don’t think anything more needs to be said about that until we know if they're eligible to play. I just don't think it's smart to speculate on where they could play.”The NHL has made it clear that acquittal does not equate to reinstatement.The league released a statement acknowledging that the players’ behavior—though not criminally punishable—was still “very disturbing” and “unacceptable.” The league added that it would be “reviewing and considering the judge's findings” before making any decisions about eligibility.While Hart is technically an unrestricted free agent, teams are hesitant. Analyst Avry Lewis-McDougall shut down rumors linking Hart to the Edmonton Oilers during the Fanatics View Hockey Show, stating bluntly: “It’s a hard no.” He cited both the unresolved nature of Hart’s status and the inevitable media firestorm.“Teams don’t want the PR headache,” he said. “You should be looking at somebody you can bring in with less baggage.”With the Oilers needing a reliable goalie after two consecutive Stanley Cup Final losses, Lewis-McDougall emphasized that Hart’s off-ice issues make him an unsuitable option—even if he’s cleared to return.For now, Carter Hart’s road back to the NHL remains a legal, ethical, and reputational maze.Also Read: “Keep it real and sensible”: Carey Price’s wife Angela responds to Sydney Sweeney’s American Eagle ad backlash",Elliotte friedman says it's ‘irresponsible’ to speculate on carter hart’s nhl future post-acquittal.

WWE legends like Ric Flair, John Cena, and Randy Orton popped in and told anecdotes about how Hulk Hogan impacted the business.Nick Hogan capped off the segment by raising the old HW belt that his father popularized in the '80s.He put it in the middle of the ring on a commemorative pedestal, a sign of the memory of the Immortal One.There was a vivacious expression of support for home ground and social media, Nick Hogan. Nick had not been part of the wrestling world for the bulk of his life, many pointed out, but what he had to say conveyed the truth behind the man who mostly appeared to live his life as a performer, and at times, a braggart.WWE subsequently announced that it was a part of a week-long celebration commemorating Hulk Hogan's 40th anniversary in the sport of professional wrestling.

Michael Jordan still respected by LeBron James, despite GOAT talk

A surprising idea involving two of basketball's biggest legends - LeBron James and Michael Jordan - has sparked interest online. Fans of both players have argued for years about who is the greatest of all time. Now, a new idea has brought the debate back in a fun way. But things didn’t turn out the way people expected.On August 2, YouTuber Jimmy Donaldson, also called Mr. Beast, shared a fun idea during a live video. He said, “What if we got LeBron James and Michael Jordan to play 1-on-1, but we make it harder for LeBron somehow?” He was talking casually with fans. He compared it to a video where soccer star Cristiano Ronaldo played a fan for $1 million.The clip spread fast on social media like X and Instagram. Fans started thinking about how that match could look. Mr. Beast also said it would never really happen. He added, “They would never do it, but imagine if we could.”Michael Jordan is now 62 years old. He retired in 2003 after playing with the Washington Wizards. LeBron James is 40. He just finished his 22nd season with the Los Angeles Lakers. In June 2025, he was picked for the All-NBA Second Team.This age gap of 22 years is likely why Mr. Beast suggested a handicap-like using only one hand or playing barefoot-for LeBron James.LeBron James, who is preparing for the 2025-2026 NBA season, has never directly called himself the GOAT. But after winning four championships, being selected to 20 All-Star games, and leading in career scoring, many believe his resume stands above the rest.Michael Jordan’s fans argue that his perfect 6–0 record in the NBA Finals makes him the true GOAT. The debate has no official answer, and both players have spoken highly of each other in public. In 2020, LeBron told ESPN, “I grew up watching Michael. He made me love the game. I’ll always respect him.”Mr. Beast’s idea will probably never become a real game. But many people enjoyed thinking about a one-on-one match between the two famous players. He talked about it first on August 2 during his live video. So far, neither LeBron James nor Michael Jordan has said anything about it.","Mr beast sparks goat debate with 'handicapped lebron james' twist in viral michael jordan one-on-one idea.

What did Randi Mahomes say about Patrick Mahomes' injuries?

Some of the NFL’s most promising players have often lost good months from their peak seasons due to injuries; even a minor injury can keep an NFL player away for at least a couple of weeks, during which they can miss matches. In certain cases, a long-term injury can throw a player’s career into question and often brings his position within a team into question.Recently, Randi Mahomes, Patrick Mahomes’ mom opened up about the anxieties she experiences around not just her son’s health but also that of the players in his team Kansas City Chiefs. In 2022, Mahomes suffered an ankle sprain in the AFC Divisional Round matchup against the Jacksonville Jaguars and suffered a high ankle sprain in 2024. However, none of his injuries have been big enough to take a major toll on his career or performance.Randi recently spoke about her feelings in a video. “Let me tell you as a mom, still to this day, it’s hard for me to watch the football games completely. I’m pacing and I’m playing with grandkids. I’m doing anything I can do not to just focus on every single play because it is a fear that I have. I don’t normally like speak about it, but at the same time, I keep thinking it will get easier to watch,” she said.She further added, “We had injuries. So it’s something that I always tell to like -Focus on your body, listen to your body. Listen to your coaches and doctors. Also, football is a contact sport, and it’s something that I’ve accepted.”Patrick Mahomes has a history of fighting through injuries. The quarterback suffered an ankle injury during the Monday Night Football clash against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in November. Coach Andy Reid told Mahomes he was taking him out of the game. Mahomes said he felt pain in his ankle when he planted his left foot on the slippery tuft. However, Mahomes stood his ground and returned and was able to bounce back fairly quickly.",Randi mahomes recently talked about patrick's injuries.

From trade demands to GIFs — how the standoff spiralled online

Why Jerry Jones believes losing leverage is worse than losing Micah Parsons

Dez Bryant erupts, fans protest, but Jerry Jones stays silent

What this means for the future of player power

For Jerry Jones, the Micah Parsons standoff isn’t just a contract dispute — it’s a defining moment in his reign as the most hands-on owner in American sports. The 82-year-old Cowboys patriarch is once again locking horns with a superstar over money, control, and principle. But insiders say this time feels different — and far more personal. Jones isn’t just trying to win a deal; he’s trying to defend the Cowboy way.According to USA TODAY Sports, Micah Parsons has already delivered his message to the top: “I no longer want to be here.” The All-Pro linebacker’s frustration stems from Jones freezing out his agent and dragging out contract talks, despite Parsons seeking a deal worth $35 million annually. While his camp waits, the linebacker dropped a cryptic “One Last Time” GIF on social media — and sparked a media firestorm Dallas hasn’t seen since the Dez Bryant days.Sources say Jones has made one thing clear to his inner circle: “We’re not trading Micah Parsons — period.” It’s the same no-nonsense approach he took during Emmitt Smith’s 1993 holdout, only this time, social media and public opinion are louder. “If I pay Micah that money,” he reportedly argued, “then I have to pay CeeDee [Lamb] and others too.”The billionaire sees this as more than cap math — it’s about who sets the rules in Dallas.When Jones publicly referenced former stars like Dez Bryant to justify his position, the fallout was immediate. “I’m about to expose the unfair s**t… Don’t gaslight me,” Bryant wrote on X. Meanwhile, fan protests outside training camp have erupted under the hashtag #PayParsons. Yet Jones hasn’t blinked. Multiple sources say he told staff, “If Micah misses camp, fine. I’m not backing down.” His gamble? That time — and pressure — will wear Parsons down.As the NFL enters a new era of player branding, media leverage, and agent-driven negotiations, Jones’ playbook is being tested. In a league where top stars double as global influencer-assets, holding the line could cost the Cowboys far more than stats. But for Jones, this is about legacy, not just leverage. “I won’t be strong-armed,” he reportedly said. That’s the message from the top of Cowboys Nation — and it’s one that could reshape the locker room, the fanbase, and the season ahead.Also read: Dez Bryant drops bombshell Nicki Minaj tease in explosive Jerry Jones feud — NFL and Barbz fans go wild","Dallas cowboys owner jerry jones is locked in a contract dispute with linebacker micah parsons.

Golden State Warriors reached three other players while stalemating Jonathan Kuminga

The Golden State Warriors and Jonathan Kuminga, a restricted free agent, are still at odds. His contract demands have caused their negotiations to stall for more than a month. However, analyst Shannon Sharpe contended that coach Steve Kerr's lack of faith in Kuminga is the primary reason for his wish to leave in the first place. During those four seasons with the Warriors, Kuminga believes his career has been hampered.In order to maximize wins, Warriors coach Steve Kerr justified his decision to limit Jonathan Kuminga's playoff playing time in favor of veterans like Draymond Green, Jimmy Butler, and Stephen Curry. After Curry's hamstring injury, Kerr only expanded Kuminga's role. However, he openly questioned the forward's suitability, calling his style ""ball-dominant"" even though Kuminga averaged an outstanding 24.3 points on 55.4% shooting in his final four playoff games.On the ""Nightcap"" podcast, analyst Shannon Sharpe identified Kerr's handling as the main cause of Kuminga's annoyance, arguing that it has encouraged the young to pursue a trade. Sharpe's perspective supports ESPN's Shams Charania's assertion that Kuminga views Sacramento as an opportunity to gain more respect and career control.The 2021 No. 7 pick is seeking an annual salary of approximately $30 million, while the Warriors have offered a two-year, $45 million deal, which he rejected, according to ESPN’s Shams Charania.Frustrated, Kuminga is now exploring sign-and-trade options, with a strong interest in joining the Sacramento Kings, who are offering a starting role, per ESPN’s Marc J. Spears. However, no trade proposal has yet satisfied Golden State’s expectations, prolonging the impasse.The Golden State Warriors have allegedly signed verbal commitments with Al Horford, Gary Payton II, and De'Anthony Melton during free agency, as per recent news. The signings are expected to strengthen the team's defense, offense, as well as bench depth, supporting their postseason ambitions. But the signings are not possible until the Warriors finalize the contract with forward Jonathan Kuminga, whose future is still in doubt.This issue is a major challenge. The team must deal with Kuminga's contract before they can officially sign the new players. The delay affects the Warriors' salary cap flexibility and roster planning, putting their summer strategy on hold. The possible additions of Horford, Payton, and Melton indicate a strong effort to improve the team. However, Kuminga’s unresolved status is still a key factor in determining the team’s short-term and long-term future.Also read:","Golden state warriors and jonathan kuminga, a restricted free agent, are still at odds.

According to reports, Jonathan Kuminga won't be leaving the Golden State Warriors this offseason. One of the most prominent stories in the NBA this summer has been the restricted free agency. In order to secure a bigger position, he has been seeking a contract worth at least $25 million every season. However, Tim Kawakami of the San Francisco Standard reported that the NBA icon will be on the Golden State Warriors' roster to start the season and that the franchise has no plans to trade him this summer.Jonathan Kuminga, a restricted free agent who has yet to sign, has put the Golden State Warriors in a difficult position this offseason . Due to the team's ability to tie up their funds in order to simply match the offer, other teams have been hesitant to make the NBA player a big deal.The notion of a sign-and-trade has surfaced in recent weeks as most teams no longer have the budget capacity to sign the young forward outright. However, it seems like everything is at a halt and there has been no talk about it. As the summer wears on, Jonathan Kuminga's desire to leave the team is beginning to lose its appeal.Tim Kawakami further claimed that the G.S. Warriors are hesitant to sell the player this summer. Although he had been insisting on a trade out the door, it appears like the two parties will eventually reach a decision. The NBA forward has two options for returning to the G.S.Warriors, according to Kawakami.He can either accept the team's offer or accept Golden State's $7.9 million that the team extended to him. He further wrote:“But several sources have indicated that the Warriors have been unenthusiastic about the general idea of a Kuminga sign-and-trade from the outset. The broad context is that Joe Lacob remains a fan of Kuminga’s and is determined to either keep the 22-year-old on the roster or get real value in return. And he’s willing to wait it out.”Although Jonathan Kuminga and the team have stated their desire to split ways this summer, he will undoubtedly remain with Golden State Warriors if they are unable to locate a sign-and-trade alternative that suits them. Additionally, according to reports, he hasn't yet received an offer from his existing team that he likes.Also read: Jonathan Kuminga rejects Golden State Warriors’ $45M offer amid ongoing restricted free agency talks","Jonathan kuminga is a restricted free agent who has yet to sign with a team.
