The “SAD ENDING” To The Montreal Canadiens Season

Emily Matheson's legacy boosts Mike Matheson’s World Championship adventure



While there was optimism in the air during the Montreal Canadiens ' end-of-year media availability, veteran defenseman Mike Matheson presented a tempered view. The 31-year-old blue liner, who had a crucial role to play all season long, accepted the progress made by the team but made it clear that the actual work only recently began.In spite of logging big minutes during the 2024–25 NHL campaign, Mike Matheson was nowhere near slowing down and continuing to test his limits.Referencing the Montreal Canadiens’ first playoff appearance since beginning their rebuild, Mike Matheson admitted they didn't achieve the ultimate goal, as Stanley Cup champions, according to him, is the true NHL success. He thinks that if the Montreal Canadiens want to repeat this year's success without evolving, they're going to get a wake-up call.“It’s fun for me to have that responsibility; I know it’s important to our team that I take those minutes and do as much as I can with them. I wouldn’t say it was more tiring; my body is feeling as good as it has ever felt in my career and that’s why I’m going to the World Championship. I want to keep playing important games for next year. I’m excited to keep doing as much as I can to help the team reach new highs that we know we can reach,” he stated.Mike Matheson was grateful for the support from his wife, Emily Matheson, a former U.S. women's national team member who competed in several World Championships and Olympics. Her appreciation for the importance of serving one's country has enabled Mike to embrace the national team invitation, despite having two children at home.Also read: “The pain now is not even close to the joy that’s coming”: Coach Martin St. Louis on Montreal Canadiens' playoff loss Matheson is steadfast in his conviction that steady growth and responsibility are the true keys to long-term success as he hopes to instill the same in the Montreal Canadiens' new core.","Montreal canadiens defenseman mike matheson is heading to the world championship.

Shreyas Iyer's tactical call to promote Josh Inglis pays off: Ricky Ponting

During the 55th IPL 2025 league match between Sunrisers Hyderabad and Delhi Capitals at Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium on Monday, a run-out incident involving Vipraj Nigam sparked animated reactions from SRH owner Kavya Maran , which have gone viral on social media.The dismissal occurred in the 13th over of DC's innings when a miscommunication between Nigam and Tristan Stubbs led to Nigam's run-out while attempting to take two runs. Nigam had scored 18 runs off 17 balls, including one four and one six.Maran's expressive reaction to the dismissal was captured on camera and quickly became a talking point on social media platforms, with multiple Twitter users sharing clips of her response.Before his dismissal, Nigam had formed a crucial 33-run partnership for the sixth wicket with Stubbs, helping Delhi Capitals recover from a precarious position of 29 for 5 in 7.1 overs.The incident gained significant attention as Star Sports, the official broadcaster, highlighted Maran's reaction with the caption: ""IPL Race 2 Playoffs got everyone excited: Kavya Maran's face says it all. Watch the LIVE action on Star Sports 1, Star Sports 1 Hindi & JioHotstar!""Sunrisers Hyderabad won the toss and opted to bowl first against Delhi Capitals, a decision that paid immediate dividends. Delhi’s innings got off to a disastrous start, reeling at 26 for 4 at the end of the powerplay – the second-lowest powerplay score of the season. Only SRH’s own 24 for 4 against Mumbai Indians at the same venue ranks lower. Pat Cummins led from the front, striking thrice inside the first three overs to leave Delhi in tatters early on.","Sunrisers hyderabad owner kavya maran's reaction to vipraj nigam's run-out has gone viral on social media.

Jeff Teague says even Atlanta Hawks fans turned on him after his 2016 playoff shove on LeBron James,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/jeff-teague-says-even-atlanta-hawks-fans-turned-on-him-after-his-2016-playoff-shove-on-lebron-james/articleshow/120902497.cms,"(Image Source - Getty Images)

Jeff Teague reflects on fan backlash following 2016 playoff incident with LeBron James

In the 2016 NBA Playoffs , Atlanta Hawks ' point guard Jeff Teague gave a strong shove to LeBron James of the Cleveland Cavaliers , knocking him into the stands during Game 3 of their Eastern Conference Semifinals. This move came from Teague's frustration over previous playoff losses, but he was surprised by the backlash he faced from both Cavs fans and his own Hawks crowd. Years later, Teague reflects on that moment and the surprising responses it generated.Recently on the Club 520 Podcast, Jeff Teague shared the memorable incident when he pushed LeBron James out of bounds during the final moments of Game 3 in the 2016 Eastern Conference Semifinals. The Hawks were about to face another playoff sweep by the Cavaliers, and Teague's frustration reached its peak. ""We was losing. Sh*t I'm a sore loser. I ain't win a playoff game against him ever. I was sick of this sh*t.... I got so much hate mail... that was my first time deleting Instagram"" Teague admitted. He added that seeing Atlanta fans cheer for LeBron in their home arena intensified his emotions, leading to the impulsive foul.Teague got a flagrant 1 foul for the shove, but it didn't stop there. He was flooded with hate mail, which led him to delete his Instagram for the first time. What really shocked him was how little support he got from Hawks fans. ""I thought the fans was gonna ride with me. I was like, 'Stand up, Hawks fans.' They were like, 'Nah, that's the King,'"" he recalled.Teague was really frustrated because the Hawks kept losing in the playoffs to LeBron's teams. In the 2014-15 season, Atlanta had an amazing 60 wins but got swept by the Cavaliers in the Eastern Conference Finals. The next year, they faced the same outcome in the semifinals. LeBron was on fire, averaging 30.3 points, 11.0 rebounds, and 9.3 assists per game in the 2015 series.Reflecting on those matchups, Teague acknowledged the challenge of facing LeBron at his peak. ""LeBron was just too dominant, man. Like, y'all, you can see him now from the USA game,"" Teague said. ""He's 40 years old now. He's still the most dominant player in the league. Ten years ago, we didn't have a chance. We ain't stand a chance for him, man. He's just too dominant, man, too dominant.""Also Read: “We getting a chance to see who can really hoop” — Dwyane Wade backs referees for letting physicality play out The push on LeBron James was frustrating, but it really showed how complicated fan loyalty can be and how tough it is to go up against one of the best players ever.","Jeff teague pushed lebron james out of bounds during the final moments of game 3 in the 2016 eastern conference semifinals.

Sherrone Moore’s suspension smells of strategic damage control,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/sherrone-moores-suspension-smells-of-strategic-damage-control/articleshow/120896927.cms,"Michigan sidelines coach Moore for two games amid controversy (Image via: Getty Images)

Why Sherrone Moore’s sudden suspension feels like a PR move

Postgame Interview: Michigan HC Sherrone Moore on UPSETTING Ohio State, postgame scuffle and more

Michigan’s controversy deepens ahead of NCAA decision



The University of Michigan isn’t just calling audibles on the field, it’s doing it behind closed doors, too. As college football braces for yet another controversy-filled season, the Wolverines have issued a self-imposed two-game suspension for head coach Sherrone Moore . But this move feels less like discipline and more like a calculated distraction. The timing, conveniently placed during low-risk matchups, raises eyebrows and signals that Michigan might be more concerned with optics than true accountability.Michigan announced it will suspend Moore for two games, not to start the season, but right in the softest part of their schedule. He’ll sit out Week 3 and Week 4 against Central Michigan and Nebraska, conveniently steering clear of any high-stakes matchups. He’ll be free to coach against Oklahoma and New Mexico, the latter being especially notable considering Moore's own playing history at Oklahoma. That’s not coincidence, that’s choreography.The reason behind the suspension is allegedly deleting a 52-message text chain with former staffer Connor Stalions , the central figure in a brewing sign-stealing scandal . The deletion reportedly took place the same day the scandal hit the headlines. If that doesn’t raise a red flag, nothing will.The move looks less like accountability and more like a smokescreen. Michigan’s athletic department isn’t denying wrongdoing, they're just hoping to control the narrative before the NCAA does. But this isn’t damage control; it’s damage delay.The silence from the NCAA so far is deafening, but it won’t last. They’re watching. And if Michigan thinks it can run the clock out on this investigation with a couple of sacrificial Saturdays, they may be in for a rude awakening.This is the same program that suspended Jim Harbaugh for three games last year while letting him coach practices like nothing ever happened. The playbook hasn’t changed, only the names have. Moore’s absence won’t change Michigan’s win-loss column much, but it says volumes about what the program values: appearance over integrity. While players chase trophies, leadership seems more focused on staying one step ahead of a scandal that’s catching up fast.Also Read: Inside NFL Draft-Day drama: Did Chargers play hardball with Eagles over Omarion Hampton?

Golden State Warriors vs Houston Rockets Game 6 overview

Thewill have Stephen Curry available for tonight’s high-stakes Game 7 against the Houston Rockets, despite the superstar guard continuing to play through a right thumb injury.Stephen Curry, who has been wearing a splint to protect the thumb, remains on the injury report but is fully cleared to play. His status hasn’t changed since Game 6, signaling that the issue isn’t severe enough to limit him in the winner-take-all matchup. Teammate Gary Payton II is also available despite dealing with a left thumb splint.The Warriors, who once led the series 3-1, now face immense pressure to avoid a historic collapse reminiscent of their 2016 Finals loss. Stephen Curry’s health is critical as Golden State leans on his championship experience to counter Houston’s surging momentum. The Rockets forced Game 7 after a dominant Game 6 win, fueled by Fred VanVleet’s offense and Steven Adams’ impact off the bench.Houston remains without Jock Landale (right knee contusion) and Jae’Sean Tate (right ankle impingement), though neither was expected to play major postseason minutes. Meanwhile, Warriors forward Jimmy Butler, previously listed with a pelvic contusion, has been removed from the injury report entirely.Tip-off is set for 7:30 p.m. CT, with the winner advancing to face the Minnesota Timberwolves in the second round. All eyes will be on Stephen Curry to see if his thumb—and his shooting—hold up under playoff pressure.The Houston Rockets defeated the Golden State Warriors 115-107 in Game 6 of their playoff series at the Chase Center, forcing a decisive Game 7. Fred VanVleet led the Rockets with 29 points, 8 rebounds, and 8 assists, shooting 6 of 9 from three-point range and a perfect 9-for-9 from the free-throw line.

Gujarat Titans aim to recover from the blow dealt by young sensation Vaibhav Suryavanshi when they face a struggling Sunrisers Hyderabad in an IPL match tonight (May 2).Suryavanshi stunned GT with his incredible performance, hitting the season’s fastest century in just 35 balls and becoming the youngest IPL centurion at only 14 years and 32 days old.Despite an eight-wicket loss — post a strong 209/4 score — the result hasn't altered GT's position in the league. The Titans remain one of the most consistent teams this season, boasting a balanced squad with strengths in both batting and bowling.Led by Shubman Gill, they sit comfortably with six wins out of nine matches (12 points). Just two more wins from their last five fixtures would secure a spot in the playoffs, reaching the 16-point threshold.GT's in-form top order gives them confidence, especially with standout Sai Sudharsan, who is second in the Orange Cap race with 456 runs and five fifties. Gill (389 runs) and Jos Buttler (406 runs) also rank among the season’s top batters, making a formidable trio despite recent challenges.Earlier this season, GT defeated SRH convincingly in Hyderabad by seven wickets, thanks largely to Mohammed Siraj's impressive 4/17 spell. They’ll be hoping for a similar performance this time.Meanwhile, SRH find themselves in a critical position, needing wins urgently. The runners-up last season have struggled — just three wins in nine matches — and sit ninth on the points table. Another loss could effectively eliminate their playoff hopes.While SRH have seen flashes of brilliance from openers Abhishek Sharma and Travis Head, consistency remains elusive for the team.The pitch at Narendra Modi Stadium favours the batters, which should benefit SRH. In five of the eight matches played at Motera, teams have scored over 200 runs, highlighting the batting-friendly conditions. Bowlers are likely to struggle, particularly in the second innings, as dew is expected to make an impact.Shubman Gill (C), Sai Sudharsan, Jos Buttler (WK), Sherfane Rutherford, Shahrukh Khan, Washington Sundar, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, Sai Kishore, Mohammed Siraj, Prasidh KrishnaImpact sub: Karim Janat/Ishant SharmaTravis Head, Abhishek Sharma, Ishan Kishan, Nitish Kumar Reddy, Heinrich Klaasen (WK), Aniket Verma, Kamindu Mendis, Pat Cummins (C), Harshal Patel, Simarjeet Singh, Zeeshan AnsariImpact sub: Mohammed ShamiGujarat Titans squad : Shubman Gill (Captain), Jos Buttler (wk), B Sai Sudharsan, Shahrukh Khan, Sherfane Rutherford, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, Kagiso Rabada, Ravisrinivasan Sai Kishore, Mohammad Siraj, Prasidh Krishna, Ishant Sharma, Washington Sundar, Glenn Phillips, Anuj Rawat, Mahipal Lomror, Arshad Khan, Jayant Yadav, Nishant Sindhu, Kulwant Khejroliya, Gerald Coetzee, Manav Suthar, Kumar Kushagra, Gurnoor Brar and Karim Janat.Sunrisers Hyderabad squad : Pat Cummins (c), Ishan Kishan (wk), Atharva Taide, Abhinav Manohar, Aniket Verma, Sachin Baby, Smaran Ravichandran, Heinrich Klaasen (wk), Travis Head, Harshal Patel, Kamindu Mendis, Wiaan Mulder, Abhishek Sharma, Nitish Kumar Reddy, Mohammed Shami, Rahul Chahar, Simarjeet Singh, Zeeshan Ansari, Jaydev Unadkat, Eshan Malinga.In Ahmedabad on Friday, temperatures are expected to be quite hot, reaching up to 44°C during the day.

Darius Garland's toe injury may keep him away from the next game



Darius Garland was unable to play in the Cavaliers' first game against the Indiana Pacers. His injury is quite serious, as he has a sprained big toe. According to Jared Greenberg, this type of injury would typically keep him out for one to two weeks during the regular season. Garland missed the last two games of the Cavaliers' first-round sweep of the Miami Heat, but fans widely believed that the time off would allow him to recover enough for the start of their series against the Pacers.It's no secret that Garland is still dealing with this concerning injury; he sustained a sprain to his left toe in Game 2 of Cleveland's first-round series against Miami. Although he missed Games 3 and 4 of that series, it didn't impact the outcome, as the Cavaliers won both games convincingly to eliminate the Heat.However, as the stakes go higher, the Cavaliers will need Garland to recover fast and be back in action to help them win. His continued absence may be more serious than a minor injury, as he hasn't been able to return to play despite Cleveland not having played since Monday, April 28. The initial hope was that Garland would be back for Game 1 against Indiana, but that didn't happen.It was reported that Garland was listed as a game-time decision, which does sound encouraging but he hasn't been able to do enough to be cleared to play in an actual game.Currently, Garland's status for this toe injury is day-to-day. However, Jared Greenberg of NBA TV reported that there is ""significant concern"" about the injury, and also added that if it were the regular season, Garland would have been ""shut down for at least a week to two weeks.""","Darius garland was unable to play in the cavaliers' first game against the indiana pacers.
