Risk of backcourt overcrowding; Potential roster imbalance; Limited return for Vucevic





Who Wins the Trade?

Theare once again at the center of NBA trade speculation, this time involving Chicago Bulls veteran center. With star forward Jayson Tatum sidelined by a season-ending Achilles injury, the reigning champions are exploring ways to remain competitive, and one of the most prominent rumors suggests a deal centered on Vucevic and Anfernee Simons.As the trade deadline looms, this potential move highlights Boston’s balancing act between filling a frontcourt void, managing salary concerns, and keeping their championship window alive. Jayson Tatum ’s ruptured right Achilles tendon, suffered in May 2025, has left the Boston Celtics scrambling for answers. The absence of their top scorer and cornerstone player creates both a scoring and rebounding gap.Recent roster changes have only deepened the issue. Kristaps Porzingis and Luke Kornet have departed, while veteran Al Horford’s status remains uncertain. That leaves Neemias Queta and Luka Garza as options, neither of whom has the experience to anchor Boston’s starting lineup.This is where Nikola Vucevic enters the picture. The two-time All-Star brings scoring, floor spacing, and a stabilizing presence at center. Trade chatter suggests Boston could pursue a deal for Vucevic, potentially with a secondary piece like Ayo Dosunmu, while sending Simons and draft picks to Chicago.In proposed deals, Boston would acquire Vucevic and potentially another role player (such as Ayo Dosunmu), while sending Anfernee Simons and possibly other assets like draft picks to Chicago.NBA trades are complex transactions where teams exchange players, picks, and sometimes cash. All deals must comply with the league’s salary cap rules, requiring salaries to match within a certain percentage.In this scenario, Boston aims to strengthen its center position while also shedding salary. Trading Simons, who is on an expiring contract, allows the Celtics to avoid deeper luxury tax penalties. Chicago, meanwhile, gets an asset in Simons without long-term financial commitment, while moving on from a player in Vucevic whose market has cooled.• Fill a critical frontcourt hole left by Tatum’s absence and roster turnover• Save an estimated $6.2 million in salary this season by swapping Simons for Vucevic• Add veteran leadership with Vucevic’s All-Star experience• Keep playoff competitiveness alive despite losing their superstar• Opportunity to join a contender fresh off a championship run• Clearer role as a starting center compared to his uncertain place in Chicago• Chance to showcase his skills on a national stage, potentially boosting his value for future deals• Acquire a scoring guard in Simons, who adds athleticism and depth to their backcourt• Gain financial flexibility with his expiring contract• Add a tradeable piece for future roster moves during their rebuilding processThis deal appears to be a win for both sides, though Boston would arguably benefit the most in the short term. By filling their glaring frontcourt weakness and trimming salary, the Boston Celtics keep their championship ambitions alive. Nikola Vucevic gains a fresh chance at playoff success, while the Bulls take a step forward in rebuilding with a flexible asset in Simons.The risks are clear: Boston sacrifices scoring depth, Chicago risks a logjam at guard, and Vucevic must prove himself defensively. Yet, the immediate needs of both teams make this scenario one of the more logical trade rumors circulating.Amid the uncertainty of Tatum’s absence, Boston’s rumored pursuit of Nikola Vucevic reflects how quickly NBA teams adapt to adversity. Trades like this underline the delicate balance between short-term competitiveness and long-term planning.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Golden State Warriors Could Target $30 Million Los Angeles Clippers Star to Support Stephen Curry and Improve Title Odds If executed, the move could define not only the Boston Celtics’ defense of their title but also the next phase of the Bulls’ rebuild.

Eagles lose fullback Ben VanSumeren to knee injury

Chaos compounds as Jalen Carter ejected during stoppage



The Philadelphia Eagles’ season opener against the Dallas Cowboys quickly spiraled into a nightmare. On the opening kickoff, fullback Ben VanSumeren went down with a knee injury and was carted off the field. The team later confirmed that VanSumeren was ruled out for the remainder of the game.Ben VanSumeren, who carved out his role on special teams, appeared to suffer the injury while covering the first play of the game. Medical staff attended to him on the field before he was helped onto a cart, leaving teammates and fans concerned. Over the past two seasons, VanSumeren appeared in 20 games and recorded 16 tackles. He also registered one tackle in his lone postseason outing, making him a dependable presence in the Eagles’ depth chart.The timing of his exit couldn’t have been worse for Philadelphia, as his absence weakened special teams rotations immediately. For a defending Super Bowl champion, every roster piece matters—especially in a high-stakes NFC East rivalry opener.As VanSumeren was being tended to, the Eagles were hit with more bad news.

Ejection sets an ugly tone for the Eagles’ season opener



Fallout could extend beyond Thursday night

The Philadelphia Eagles’ title defense got off to a stunning and controversial start on Thursday night. Just six seconds into the season opener against the Dallas Cowboys, Pro Bowl defensive lineman Jalen Carter was ejected after appearing to spit on quarterback Dak Prescott. The shocking moment immediately went viral, leaving fans and analysts stunned at how quickly the game took a dramatic turn.Officials wasted no time in tossing Carter after the unsportsmanlike conduct call, and replays left little doubt as to why. The optics of a player of Carter’s stature spitting on one of the NFL’s most respected quarterbacks magnified the controversy. The league has worked hard to promote sportsmanship, and an incident like this during prime time only fueled outrage across social media.For the Eagles, losing Carter was a crushing blow. The second-year defensive tackle emerged as a cornerstone of Philadelphia’s Super Bowl run last season, anchoring a defensive front that ranked among the NFL’s best. His absence against a division rival put the Eagles’ defense under pressure from the opening snap.Beyond the immediate impact on the game, Carter’s ejection could carry long-term consequences. A suspension or fine from the NFL disciplinary office is almost certain, and his reputation will now take a hit.For a player once touted as a rising star with dominant potential, this kind of headline is the last thing Philadelphia wanted to see.Also Read: Eagles vs Cowboys season opener hit by shock Streameast takedown hours before kickoff The Eagles came into the season with high expectations, but this opening-night incident overshadowed the matchup itself.

Deion Sanders’ advice for Travis Hunter as a new dad



Travis Hunter embraces fatherhood and NFL dreams



Travis Hunter is stepping into fatherhood and the NFL at the same time, and one man who has been by his side throughout this journey is Deion Sanders. The Hall of Famer, who once recruited Hunter to Jackson State and later coached him at Colorado, recently shared heartfelt fatherly advice for the Jacksonville Jaguars rookie as he embraces life’s two biggest milestones — becoming a professional athlete and a dad.For Sanders, Travis Hunter has always been more than a player. Their bond goes back to 2021 when Hunter, then the No. 1 recruit in the nation, shocked everyone by committing to Jackson State instead of a powerhouse like Florida State. He later followed Sanders to Colorado, where he won the 2024 Heisman Trophy as a two-way sensation. Through it all, Sanders played a fatherly role, especially during Hunter’s toughest moments.On the night Hunter lifted the Heisman, his biological father was absent due to legal troubles. Sanders stepped in, embracing the young star in what became one of the most emotional moments of Hunter’s career. Years later, when Sanders was quietly battling a bladder cancer scare and couldn’t attend Hunter’s wedding, the rookie showed up at his coach’s Texas ranch, standing by him as the two shared quiet moments fishing together.“Oh my god, I’m taking a deep breath because I love him to life — I love him like he’s my son,” Sanders said. “It’s funny when your son is now a father… it’s a beautiful thing.“The thing that I told him is let’s correct all the things that we think we didn’t receive as children and let’s do that in our fatherhood. No matter what happens, let’s make sure we are the best darn father that ever walked. That’s what I told him. I’m proud of him, I love him to life, and I miss him dearly.”It wasn’t coach-speak. It was a father figure speaking to someone he considers family.Hunter, just 22, is now a husband and a father. He and his longtime girlfriend, Leanna Lenee, tied the knot earlier this year before welcoming their first child, a baby boy. In a heartfelt video titled “Dear Son…”, Hunter can be heard saying to his newborn, “Gotta be better than me.”The timing couldn’t be more symbolic. On September 7, Hunter will make his NFL debut when the Jaguars face the Carolina Panthers. It marks the start of two parallel journeys: one on the field as a top draft pick, and one at home as a father. With Sanders’ wisdom and his own determination, Hunter now carries two legacies — as a rising NFL star and as a dad committed to doing things right. Fans and critics will be watching Travis Hunter how he make his debut a dreamy one. he is ready to show what he is capable of and to prove that he is indeed a two-way player and rare.Also Read: Justin Jefferson injury update: Vikings may take cautious approach as hamstring issue raises long-term concerns","Deion sanders gives travis hunter fatherhood guidance.

Hockey’s cultural landscape has moved beyond one man’s legacy

The Canadian identity crisis goes deeper than Wayne Gretzky’s shadow

Tired of too many ads? go ad free now

For decades, Wayne Gretzky stood as the ultimate symbol of Canadian hockey pride. His dazzling play and unmatched records gave Canada a face in the global sports arena, and his legacy still commands respect. Yet as the game evolves, a cultural shift is forcing Canadians to reconsider whether Gretzky still embodies the sport’s identity.When Gretzky retired, many believed his status as “The Great One” would eternally tie him to Canada’s hockey soul. But today’s NHL reflects a broader, more global identity. Stars like Connor McDavid , Auston Matthews, and Sidney Crosby have taken the torch, while international icons from Sweden, Russia, and the United States increasingly shape the league.Canada’s hockey culture is no longer built solely on a single national figurehead. Instead, it reflects diversity, new styles of play, and a growing international influence. Gretzky’s records still hold weight, but younger generations see him as a legend of the past, not the face of today’s game.The debate isn’t about Gretzky’s greatness, it’s about what he represents. Canada once relied on him to symbolize dominance and unity in hockey. But as the sport evolves, Canadians are confronting uncomfortable questions about their place in a game they no longer exclusively own.Hockey’s growth in non-traditional markets, combined with Canada’s struggles to consistently dominate on the world stage, has fueled this identity crisis. While Gretzky remains the most iconic name in hockey history, he no longer reflects the modern state of the sport or Canada’s role within it.Also Read: Wayne Gretzky's daughter Paulina Gretzky turns head in bold gothic look during Italian getaway with Dustin Johnson In the end, Gretzky’s influence will never disappear, but Canada’s hockey identity now extends beyond his shadow.

A surprising choice after a messy Cowboys-Parsons split



Loyalty, convenience, or just love for the game?

The Dallas Cowboys may have moved on from Micah Parsons, but his mother, Sherese Parsons, hasn’t completely let go of the team that drafted her son. Just one week after the Cowboys stunned the football world by trading Parsons to the Green Bay Packers, Sherese was reportedly spotted at Lincoln Financial Field on Thursday night—dressed in Cowboys gear as the team faced the Philadelphia Eagles.Micah Parsons’ departure came after months of friction with Cowboys owner Jerry Jones. The star linebacker, who anchored Dallas’ defense for four seasons, wanted a record-breaking contract extension. When negotiations stalled, he formally requested a trade—a request the Cowboys eventually granted. The move shocked fans across the NFL , especially given Parsons’ role as one of the league’s most dominant defensive players.That backdrop makes Sherese’s appearance in Cowboys colors particularly intriguing. “Does his mom even know it happened?” some fans joked online, pointing out the odd visual of her supporting the very team that just shipped her son away.There could be simpler explanations behind Sherese’s decision. Harrisburg, Pennsylvania—her hometown—is just a couple of hours from Philadelphia, making Thursday’s season opener an easy trip.Her history with the Cowboys is also deeply personal, given her son’s rise to stardom in Dallas. And of course, it may just come down to her genuine love for football.Also Read: “Nobody knows who I am”: Josh Allen opens up about being overshadowed by wife Hailee Steinfeld at global events Whatever the reason, Sherese’s presence adds yet another wrinkle to an already dramatic offseason for both Parsons and the Cowboys.

Naomi Osaka’s name often dominates tennis headlines, but her personal life has drawn just as much attention in recent years. Fans frequently ask about her marital status, especially following the birth of her daughter. The four-time Grand Slam champion, however, is not married. Instead, she previously shared a long-term relationship with Grammy-nominated rapper Cordae, with whom she welcomed her daughter, Shai, in July 2023.Naomi Osaka does not have a husband. The 27-year-old tennis star never tied the knot, but she was in a committed relationship with rapper Cordae for several years. Their romance began quietly in 2019 after the pair was spotted courtside at an L.A. Clippers game. For nearly a year, they kept their relationship out of the spotlight, preferring to share only selective glimpses with the public.On January 6, 2025, Osaka revealed on Instagram that their relationship had ended. “Hi everyone, just wanted to say that Cordae and I are no longer in a relationship,” she wrote in her story. She stressed there was “no bad blood at all,” calling him “a great person and an awesome dad” to their daughter.Despite the breakup, Osaka expressed gratitude for their time together, adding, “Honestly really glad our paths crossed because my daughter is my biggest blessing and I was able to grow a lot from our experiences together. ”Cordae Amari Dunston, known professionally as Cordae, is a rapper and songwriter from Maryland. A Grammy nominee, he’s collaborated with artists such as H.E.R. and Young Thug. Beyond music, he’s also been recognized for his social awareness and even received an Emmy for his work on We the People, a project backed by Barack and Michelle Obama.While their romance lasted, Cordae was Osaka’s most vocal supporter. He famously flew across the country during the 2020 U.S. Open to cheer her on, a gesture Osaka once praised on Instagram. In interviews, Cordae spoke warmly about her, even admitting he hadn’t followed tennis closely before they met.Cordae joined Osaka at the 2021 Met Gala and celebrated birthdays and milestones together. Still, their relationship faced challenges, and by late 2023, fans noticed hints of strain when Osaka scrubbed photos of him from her Instagram.The highlight of their relationship came in July 2023 when Osaka gave birth to their daughter, Shai. The tennis star later explained the meaning behind her daughter’s name. “Shai means God’s gift. I wanted her to feel like she was a gift to me and her dad.”Motherhood has profoundly shaped Osaka’s outlook. In her Tubi documentary Naomi Osaka: The Second Set, she revealed struggles with postpartum depression but also emphasized how Shai gave her renewed purpose. “In no world would I ever want my daughter to think that her birth is nothing less than the biggest gift I have ever received,” she said.Also read: UFC fighter Colby Covington humiliates streamer Chrogman as $30,000 challenge ends in vomit on floor Even after their split, Osaka and Cordae remain committed co-parents.

The Browns are holding off on signing his rookie contract until the league completes its investigation, leaving fans wondering if Judkins will be ready for Sunday’s season opener against the Cincinnati Bengals.Judkins, who was arrested in July, saw the charges dropped due to insufficient evidence. Despite that, the NFL is continuing its personal conduct review. According to insider Tony Grossi, there’s “zero chance” Judkins will play in Week 1, and he anticipates a suspension of 2 to 4 games.The league is reportedly pushing to wrap up the investigation before the Browns’ opener, but the timing is tight. For now, Judkins’ availability hangs in the balance, and the NFL’s ruling will dictate the next steps for the rookie.The Browns have made it clear they won’t finalize Judkins’ contract until the league’s review is complete. Even if he signs immediately after the ruling, he will have missed valuable practice time with the team, making it unlikely he could contribute right away.In the meantime, Cleveland will rely on veteran Jerome Ford and rookie Dylan Sampson to handle the backfield workload. The team is hopeful Judkins will eventually be available, but his short-term status remains uncertain as the NFL’s investigation continues.With the season opener looming, the Browns have already begun planning around Judkins’ absence. Without him, the offense will lean heavily on Ford, Sampson, and other playmakers to carry the running game early. Fans should also keep an eye on how quickly Judkins can integrate into the lineup once his suspension is served. His absence for even a few games could shift early-season dynamics for Cleveland, making this a key storyline to watch.For now, all eyes are on the NFL to finalize its decision. Judkins’ suspension length and timing will determine not just his availability, but also the Browns’ offensive strategy in the first few weeks of the season.Until then, the rookie’s debut remains on hold, and the Browns will continue preparing without him. Fans can only wait and see when or if Judkins will finally take the field for his first NFL action.Also read - “Ugly ass”: Antonio Brown’s trolling hits a new level as he mocks A.J.

Caitlin Clark rules herself out after long recovery attempt



Indiana Fever bracing for stretch run without Caitlin Clark



Indiana Fever guard Caitlin Clark confirmed Thursday night that she will not return to the court this year, ending her second WNBA season with just three games left on the schedule. The two-time All-Star and reigning Rookie of the Year had been sidelined since mid-July with a right groin injury and later suffered a bone bruise that slowed her recovery. Her announcement is a major blow to the Fever, who are still fighting for the league’s final playoff spot.Caitlin Clark shared the difficult news directly with fans on social media. “I had hoped to share a better update, but I will not be returning to play this season,” she wrote on X. “I spent hours in the gym every day with the singular goal of getting back out there, disappointed isn’t a big enough word to describe how I am feeling. I want to thank everyone who had my back through all the uncertainty.”The 23-year-old guard said the support from Fever fans kept her motivated despite setbacks. “This has been incredibly frustrating, but even in the bad, there is good. The way the fans continued to show up for me, and for the Fever, brought me so much joy and important perspective.I am so proud of how this team has only gotten stronger through adversity this year. Now it’s time to close out the season and claim our spot in the playoffs. ”Clark averaged 16.5 points, 8.8 assists, and 5 rebounds across 13 games before her season ended. She had looked close to returning earlier this week, taking part in light drills, but contact work never followed.Fever general manager Amber Cox acknowledged the timing made a comeback impossible. “Caitlin has worked so hard throughout this time, doing everything possible to recover and return to the court but, ultimately, time is not on our side,” Cox said in a statement.Cox continued, “while we will continue working with Caitlin and provide her with every resource we have available, there is not enough time left in our season for her to safely return, and her long-term health and well-being remains our top priority. We are looking forward to having her back at full strength to start the 2026 season.”Also Read: Anthony Edwards receives words of caution from Miami Heat legend Dwyane Wade ahead of 2025-26 NBA season Clark’s absence adds to a brutal injury list for Indiana, with multiple guards already out for the year.

Fans react to Amari Cooper’s sudden retirement and lasting impact

On September 4, 2025, a bombshell dropped: less than a week after re-signing with the Las Vegas Raiders, wide receiver Amari Cooper shocked the sports world with an unexpected retirement announcement from the NFL. The five-time Pro Bowl veteran told the team hekilling what was a highly anticipated reunion. This announcement puts the finishing touches on a decade-long stellar career.Cooper was highly anticipated to return to the Raiders earlier this season. He signed a one-year, $6 million deal on August 25, 2025, to return to the team that selected him fourth overall in the 2015 draft. It was billed as a second-chance reunion, and Cooper stated he was coming back to finish the job and build on that early fandom magic.Removing that reunion was expected to strengthen a new Raiders offense, which was already busy acquiring pieces with the addition of quarterback Geno Smith and a rookie running back, Ashton Jeanty. Cooper was expected to provide veteran stability within a young receiver room with his leadership and talent.This means the team has to scramble to figure things out before the start of the season, with just a few short weeks to go until kickoff.

Christian McCaffrey’s injury history raises fresh concerns



49ers weigh options if Christian McCaffrey is limited



San Francisco 49ers fans received unwelcome news just days before the season opener. Star running back Christian McCaffrey, widely regarded as the team’s offensive engine, was added to the injury report with a calf issue. The setback, announced Thursday, comes after an offseason where McCaffrey appeared fully healthy and primed for a bounce-back year. His availability against the Seattle Seahawks now hangs in the balance.Christian McCaffrey’s durability has been a lingering storyline throughout his career. Entering his ninth NFL season, the 29-year-old has experienced more than his share of setbacks. Last year, Achilles tendinitis sidelined him for eight games before a knee injury in Week 13 ended his campaign after only four appearances. That came just one season removed from a spectacular 1,459-yard performance that earned him First-Team All-Pro honors.This summer brought optimism. McCaffrey looked sharp during voluntary workouts and participated in training camp without restrictions. Fantasy football managers and oddsmakers alike expected him to carry a heavy load for San Francisco’s playoff push. But Thursday’s report reignited worries about whether his body can endure another grueling season.The timing of McCaffrey’s injury immediately impacted betting markets. FanDuel Sportsbook trimmed the 49ers’ line from -2.5 to -1.5 against the Seahawks, underscoring just how central he is to San Francisco’s success.Fortunately for the 49ers, they bolstered their backfield depth in the offseason. Newly acquired Brian Robinson Jr., who rushed for 799 yards and eight touchdowns with Washington last year, could see an expanded role if McCaffrey is limited. Second-year back Isaac Guerendo, who contributed 420 yards and four scores as a rookie, also provides insurance.Still, neither option replicates the unique skill set McCaffrey brings — his blend of vision, burst, and pass-catching ability transforms the 49ers’ offense when he is on the field. As head coach Kyle Shanahan prepares for Sunday, all eyes will be on Friday’s practice report for clarity on McCaffrey’s status.The 49ers begin 2025 with one of the league’s most favorable schedules, but injuries have a way of rewriting even the brightest projections. For now, the hope in San Francisco is simple: that Christian McCaffrey’s latest setback is minor and not a preview of another frustrating season.Also Read: Eagles surprise fans with risky inactive list against Cowboys, sparking questions ahead of season’s opening night clash","San francisco 49ers star running back christian mccaffrey was added to the injury report with a calf issue.

Cowboys seek redemption as Cavinders fuel fan spotlight



The NFL season kicked off with more than just high-stakes football—style, love, and fandom collided under the bright lights of Philadelphia. Haley Cavinder, the former Miami Hurricanes guard, turned heads on Thursday as she cheered on her fiancé, Dallas Cowboys tight end Jake Ferguson, during the league’s much-anticipated opener against the defending champion Eagles.Haley Cavinder is hopeful her Cowboys fiancé gets the season started with a win, and she made sure her support was impossible to miss. The 24-year-old sported a customized “Awake Mode” outfit, complete with Ferguson’s No. 87 and his name emblazoned across the back of her black leather pants. Paired with a striking shoelace-strap top, her game-day look was as bold as her loyalty.Beside her, twin sister Hanna kept it playful yet understated in a denim crop top with a giant star across the front—an unmistakable nod to “America’s Team.” The sisters posted a TikTok video that captured them stretching and joking about warming up to enter Lincoln Financial Field, captioning it, “Warming up to enter the Eagles stadium as Cowboys fans.”While the fashion was eye-catching, the sentiment was heartfelt. Haley, engaged to Ferguson since April after nearly two years of dating, has fully embraced the rollercoaster of NFL life. Her outfit wasn’t just trendy—it was a symbolic show of devotion ahead of a season that could define her fiancé’s career.The timing couldn’t be more charged. The Cowboys are emerging from a 7-10 season, entering a new era without Micah Parsons after his blockbuster trade. For Ferguson, who logged 59 receptions and 494 yards in 14 games last season, the opener represented both a personal test and a team statement.The Cavinder twins, known for their social media savvy, ensured the spotlight extended beyond the field.

Eagles shuffle edge rushers for opening week



Eagles inactive list highlights draft depth concerns



The Philadelphia Eagles kicked off their season with a roster move that raised eyebrows. Ahead of Thursday night’s clash against the Dallas Cowboys, the team elevated Patrick Johnson from the practice squad but sat both Azeez Ojulari and Ogbo Okoronkwo. The decision left fans and analysts debating whether this was a strategic gamble or a signal of how the coaching staff views their defensive depth.Johnson’s call-up means he and Josh Uche will back up starters Nolan Smith and Jalyx Hunt on the edge. While the move might seem routine, the inactives list tells a bigger story. Ojulari and Okoronkwo, both expected to contribute early, were surprisingly sidelined. This comes on the heels of a report that the Eagles explored a blockbuster trade for Cowboys star Micah Parsons over the summer. Whether those talks advanced or were quickly dismissed by Dallas owner Jerry Jones remains unclear, but the interest itself speaks volumes.With just four edge rushers available, defensive coordinator Vic Fangio may lean on creativity. Gabe Hall, who flashed on the edge in preseason, could rotate outside. Moro Ojomo or even standout defensive tackle Jalen Carter might slide over in certain packages, adding versatility but also risk.The strategy suggests the Eagles want flexibility more than sheer numbers at the position.Beyond the edge rusher surprise, the Eagles’ inactives also included backup quarterback Tanner McKee, linemen Drew Kendall, Cameron Williams, and Kenyon Green, plus rookie defensive tackle Ty Robinson. Notably, three of the ten draft picks from this spring are already sidelined in Week 1—a sign that development, rather than immediate impact, may define this rookie class.Adding to the intrigue, former Saints second-rounder Isaiah Foskey is scheduled for a workout with Philadelphia next week. At 6-foot-5 and 275 pounds, the Notre Dame product could be an intriguing addition if the Eagles want more proven depth on the edge.As the season unfolds, the Eagles’ handling of their pass-rushing unit will be worth watching closely. Thursday’s opener might just be the first glimpse of a larger defensive experiment under Fangio’s system.Also Read: Eagles vs Cowboys season opener hit by shock Streameast takedown hours before kickoff",Philadelphia eagles elevated patrick johnson from the practice squad.
