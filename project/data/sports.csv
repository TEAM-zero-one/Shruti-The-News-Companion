NEW DELHI: With India having entered the race to host the 2036 Olympics, home minister Amit Shah on Friday said around 3,000 sportspersons are being provided a monthly stipend of Rs 50,000 each to prepare for the games, and hoped that the country would be among the top five nations in the medal tally.Addressing an event here to felicitate the 613 medal winners of the 21st World Police and Fire Games-2025 held recently in the US, Shah congratulated the Indian police and fire services team for making the country proud.With the next World Police and Fire Games set to be held in Ahmedabad, Gandhinagar and Kevadia in Gujarat, he exhorted all sportspersons to single-mindedly focus on winning a medal. He hoped that the Indian sportspersons’ performance will serve as a recognition of the country’s great potential for sports. “Our aim should be to ensure that at least one athlete from every police force under the All India Police Sports Control Board participates in the next World Police and Fire Games. Each team should aim to win at least three medals. By setting such a goal, the record of winning 613 medals will break,” he told police and fire services personnel.Shah said the Indian team was given an incentive amount of Rs 4.4 crore on Friday.Adding words of encouragement even for those who did not win medals at the 2025 Games, Shah said participation in games was the most important, with winning and losing being a part of life.Shah mentioned the Modi govt, in addition to bidding for Olympics, was also in the race to host the Commonwealth Games and Asian Games in India. The purpose of hosting these events, he underlined, is to make sports an inevitable part of the lives of people.The home minister said the sports budget has grown five-fold in the past 10 years.Shah urged the All India Police Sports Control Board to provide world-class coaches to Indian police teams and give specialized training to medical teams of the forces for treating sports-related injuries.","India has entered the race to host the 2036 olympics, home minister amit shah said.

Justin Tucker’s potential NFL return: Ravens’ ‘football decision’ sparks bigger debate,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/justin-tuckers-potential-nfl-return-ravens-football-decision-sparks-bigger-debate/articleshow/122773919.cms,"Justin Tucker eyes NFL return after controversial Ravens exit (Getty Images)

Baltimore’s all-time kicker still wants to play, but is the NFL ready for his comeback?

The Ravens’ future rests with rookie Tyler Loop—for now

NFL teams watching closely as suspension countdown begins

The Baltimore Ravens shocked the NFL world earlier this offseason when they cut ties with longtime kicker Justin Tucker, a franchise legend whose resume includes a Super Bowl ring, seven Pro Bowl nods, and the highest field goal conversion rate in NFL history. But the controversy surrounding his departure wasn’t just about on-field production—it was about timing, messaging, and the league’s tolerance for off-field allegations.Despite Tucker's unprecedented accuracy—417 of 468 career field goals at 89.1 percent—the Ravens released him following serious accusations from over 16 massage therapists in the Baltimore area. Though Tucker has denied all allegations, he agreed to serve a 10-game suspension issued by the NFL, sidelining him until at least Week 11 of the 2025 season.Still, some insiders believe Tucker isn’t done just yet. ""By maintaining that cutting Tucker was a football decision, the Ravens kept the door open for a reunion,"" wrote Ravens insider Jeff Zrebiec of The Athletic. ""Still, they’d have to be in a pretty tough spot to make that call. I might be in the minority here, but I believe Tucker will kick again in the NFL. All indications are that he wants to.""Baltimore attempted to turn the page by drafting rookie Tyler Loop in the sixth round of the 2025 NFL Draft.The move, while strategic, now looks risky given the magnitude of who Tucker was to the franchise. If Loop falters, expect the fanbase and media alike to revisit DeCosta’s controversial explanation.""Sometimes football decisions are incredibly difficult, and this is one of those instances,"" DeCosta said. ""Considering our current roster, we have made the tough decision to release Justin Tucker.""Many fans remain unconvinced that this was solely a “football decision.” The optics surrounding the release—coinciding with misconduct allegations—have left room for skepticism. Bringing Tucker back would only intensify that scrutiny.Tucker will be eligible to return to the league on November 11, just ahead of Week 11. With kicking struggles a constant around the NFL, the door remains open for a team desperate for consistency. If the Ravens don’t act, someone else might.One thing is clear: Tucker still wants to kick. Whether any team wants to take the public relations hit to sign him remains to be seen. But in the NFL, talent often gets a second chance—especially when it’s historically great.Also Read: Bill Belichick and Jordon Hudson’s bathroom decor goes viral after fans connect it to Taylor Swift’s 'Clara Bow' song","Justin tucker was released by the baltimore ravens earlier this offseason.

Jelly Roll name-drops Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce while sharing his ultimate music industry power rankings on ESPN



Inside Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce’s headline-making summer off the grid



Jelly Roll didn’t hold back when talking about Taylor Swift on ESPN’sthis week. While praising a few of his favorite artists, the country-rapper lit up the moment Swift’s name entered the conversation. From Miami workouts to worldwide stages, Swift has remained a dominating cultural force—and she’s got more than fans in her corner. Jelly Roll declared her the undisputed “GOAT,” and made it clear he’s willing to fight for that title. As for Travis Kelce ? The NFL superstar and Swift’s partner was right there to show his appreciation—with a laugh, a high-five, and a comment Swifties won’t forget.During his visit to The Pat McAfee Show, Jelly Roll, 40, praised several artists he admires, including Morgan Wallen and Post Malone. But it was when he brought up Taylor Swift, 35, that things got more animated.“She’s the GOAT!” he declared live on ESPN. “I will fistfight anybody who says otherwise. Travis, don’t even worry—I got this one. You know what I mean? She’s the GOAT.”That bold take sparked instant attention online—especially when Travis Kelce chimed in. Travis Kelce , also 35, saw the clip and didn’t stay quiet. In the comments of McAfee’s Instagram post, the Kansas City Chiefs tight end responded with: “my dawg is the realest!!” followed by laughing and high-five emojis.Kelce and Swift have been publicly dating since the summer of 2023, going official that September. Since then, they’ve made a habit of supporting each other across stadiums and stages—Swift often seen cheering from Kelce’s NFL luxury suites, while Kelce has popped up side-stage (and occasionally on stage) during her blockbuster Eras Tour.Beyond their public appearances, sources say the couple is enjoying a rare stretch of downtime. In May, Swift was reportedly staying in Miami “to support and spend time” with Kelce during his offseason training for his 13th NFL season.“Travis still seems very happy with Taylor,” one source shared. Back in April, another insider told PEOPLE the couple had been making the most of their time off. “They have been traveling nonstop and very much enjoy it,” they said. “They are hanging out with friends, too. It's a special time for them.”The same source added, “They value the same things. Right now, the focus is very much on private time out of the spotlight.”Jelly Roll’s fierce defense of Swift may have been playful, but it was packed with passion—echoing what many fans and friends feel about the pop icon’s lasting impact. With Travis Kelce backing the love up and their bond growing stronger behind the scenes, Swift’s circle seems to be as loyal as her legacy is lasting.Also Read: The Pittsburgh Steelers are betting big on 42-year-old Aaron Rodgers—but only Tom Brady has ever pulled it off","Country-rapper jelly roll called taylor swift the ""goat"" on espn.

Natasha Cloud: A Voice Beyond Basketball

Why She’s Still Undervalued

In a league that often spotlights scorers and viral moments, it’s easy to overlook the glue players—the ones who build chemistry, drive accountability, and turn teams into contenders. Butisn’t just any role player. She’s the heartbeat of every roster she touches, a vocal leader and elite competitor whose impact extends far beyond the numbers. Natasha Cloud has long commanded respect across the WNBA for her tenacious leadership, vocal presence, and ability to lift everyone around her. Whether it’s during shootaround or the final minutes of a game, her influence is unmistakable. Teammates consistently praise her leadership skills, including Mercury guard Sophie Cunningham, who called her “our best leader so far,” citing Cloud’s on- and off-court communication as a catalyst for team cohesion.On the floor, Cloud is a cerebral floor general. Her career assist-to-turnover ratio of 2.65 reflects a player who brings control, structure, and decision-making precision—particularly in crunch time. Her value isn’t just on offense. Cloud’s resume includes two WNBA All-Defensive Team selections, and her ability to contain top-tier guards adds immense value on the other end of the court.Natasha Cloud’s presence immediately transforms team dynamics.Her debut for the Liberty in 2025, after a post-2024 trade from Phoenix and Connecticut, was a masterclass in two-way dominance: 22 points, 6 rebounds, 9 assists, 3 steals, and 2 blocks. With game-changing plays in the fourth quarter, she powered her new team past the defending champs. The crowd of 17,000+ at Barclays Center recognized it, giving her a standing ovation that felt like long-overdue appreciation.Since joining New York, Natasha Cloud has flourished. Her high basketball IQ meshes seamlessly with the Liberty’s up-tempo system, where she orchestrates possessions and steps up to defend stars like Caitlin Clark. Whether it’s creating looks for Breanna Stewart , Sabrina Ionescu, or Jonquel Jones, or taking over when the offense stalls, Cloud’s production and efficiency have reached new heights—statistically and emotionally.“She just continues to show people there’s no limit to what someone’s capable of doing,” said longtime teammate Myisha Hines-Allen, praising Cloud’s continued growth and leadership.Natasha Cloud’s influence isn’t limited to the hardwood. A fierce advocate for social justice, she’s used her platform to speak out on police brutality, LGBTQ+ rights, and racial equity. In 2020, she sat out the season to protest systemic injustice, organizing marches and amplifying community voices. A recipient of the 2019 Dawn Staley Community Leadership Award, Cloud’s example off the court is just as powerful as her performance on it.She’s also a mentor, often guiding younger teammates and building a culture of empathy, accountability, and activism. Her holistic approach to leadership—balancing fire with compassion—makes her one of the most respected voices in the league.Despite her resume, Natasha Cloud has often flown under the national radar. While other stars dominate ad campaigns and headlines, she remains the league’s unofficial captain—the one players follow and coaches trust when it matters most. Now in a major market with a real title shot, Cloud is finally getting the spotlight she deserves.Also read: Stephen Curry Reacts To The Golden State Warriors Evolving Dynasty as Klay Thompson and Kevon Looney Depart: “We Avoided All The Evils” She may not be the first name fans think of when talking WNBA stars—but within locker rooms, she’s the one who changes everything.

And her best chapter might still be ahead.","Natasha cloud has long commanded respect across the wnba for her tenacious leadership, vocal presence, and ability to lift everyone around her.

John Cena and Cody Rhodes' SummerSlam contract signing

With SummerSlam a little over two weeks away, WWE is full steam ahead. And this means, this week's Friday Night SmackDown is basically a stepping stone for the upcoming Premium Live Event. From the Frost Bank Center in San Antonio, Texas, the July 18 edition of SmackDown was already going to be an important one, as fans already knew of John Cena and Cody Rhodes coming together to sign their SummerSlam contract. Along with these two heavyweights, fans also got to feast on some exciting match cards, so let's get in with it already.The night started with a segment starring the MFTs, who had been in a car accident. SmackDown GM Adam Pearce and a few cops are seen talking to the stable where Solo Sikoa asks Pearce to get Jacob Fatu. But soon enough, the night moves towards its first fight when Charlotte Flair is seen backstage with Alexa Bliss , where the former tells the latter that she has gotten them a shot at the WWE Women’s Tag Team Titles at SummerSlam.Charlotte Flair and Raquel Rodriguez face each other inside the ring while Alexa Bliss and Roxanne Perez are standing outside. Both women seem to have a similar standing in the game, with neither being able to gain an upper hand. Perez tries to launch a sneak attack, but Bliss is there to take care of that. Finally, just when Perez thought she could create a distraction, Bliss hits Rodriguez with one of her pompoms, and Flair uses this opportunity to roll her for a pin and win.The backstage segment with the MFTs starts again, and the cops take Jacob Fatu with them in suspicion of the accident earlier. Things then turn to Carmelo Hayes and Damian Priest, who, ""Earlier Today,"" we're seen having a confrontation before a fight is announced between them.Carmelo Hayes started with a right hand into Damian Priest’s back even before the bell rang, but Priest was not one to take it quietly. He retaliated with a big foot and the tone of the night was set. At the end, Priest slams Hayes face-first into the announce desk, and just as he was about to go for an Old School, Alistair Black shows up and trips Priest.The MFTs are seen taking to the ring after the alleged car accident, where Solo Sikoa lays it on thick, blaming Jacob Fatu for what went down. But out of nowhere, Jimmy Uso and Jacob Fatu pop out from a police car, and everyone gets to know that Fatu had been cleared of all suspicion because of security footage. Fatu is inside the ring soon enough, and with Uso sneaking behind the MFTs, all hell breaks loose. Pearce is seen calling the cops when things get out of hand, and Sikoa is seen being led out by the cops for staging the earlier car crash. And the Steel Cage match between Solo Sikoa and Jacob Fatu at SummerSlam is also officially announced.Possibly for the shortest match of the night, Stephanie Vaquer faces Alba Fyre of the Secret Hervice with Piper Niven watching. They go after each other from the very beginning, but Vaquer is definitely the one with the upper hand here and soon goes for the Devil’s Kiss, and then a package backbreaker. Though Fyre manages to give the slip the first time, the second time becomes too much, and Vaquer manages to get the three count after pinning her.Piper Niven, of course, comes after Vaquer, but the latter shoves her off. And though Niven tries to go after her again, Fyre stops her. Meanwhile, the Wyatt Sicks are seen trolling the Street Profits after their loss last week, right before a four-way tag team match is set to take center stage.To determine the #1 contenders for the WWE Tag Team Championship, #DIY's Johnny Gargano and Tommaso Ciampa, Rey Fenix & Andrade tag team, Fraxiom's Nathan Frazer and Axiom, and Motor City Machine Guns' Chris Sabin & Alex Shelley take to the ring. MCMG and Fraxiom are at it when #DIY jumps them. This brings Andrade and Rey Fenix into the mix as well. It's chaos inside the ring, but what else can we expect? Lastly, fans see Andrade hitting Ciampa with The Message and taking the win.Finally, the moment everyone had been waiting for. Adam Pearce brings Cody Rhodes to the stage who right away signs the SummerSlam contract. He then asks the crowd, ""What do you want to talk about?” He talks to the crowd for a while before Pearce brings John Cena out. And it's not what anyone is expecting. Cena tells everyone that Hollywood has been draining these days, and so, he won't be at SummerSlam. Everyone is shocked, but Cena goes on to say that maybe they can have the rematch later, but he won't be signing the contract now, as he does not intend to show up at the New Jersey event. He goes to walk away, and that's when things take a turn.Fans see Rhodes charging up the ramp and attacking Cena from behind. It's a mess, as both men try to gain the edge over the other. Cena tries to use his championship belt as a weapon, but Rhodes is not having that and grabs it from his opponent, smashing Cena with it. He then climbs the top rope and does a Frog Splash, driving Cena through the announcer's table. He then grabs a pen and forces Cena to sign the SummerSlam contract.

Kyle Gibson’s career path and key achievements

Reflection and future outlook for baseball veteran

Kyle Gibson, a veteran right-hander who made the All-Star Game in 2021, has confirmed his retirement from professional baseball at the major league level, bringing an end to his steady but unsplashy 13-year career. The 37-year-old disclosed an episode of his podcast, Serving It Up, after turning down a minor-league deal from the Tampa Bay Rays and coming to the realization during a family vacation that it was time to retire. Durable, Gibson was a powerhouse pitcher and inspirational leader inside and outside of the lines, boasting a lifetime record of 112–111 with a 4.60 ERA over 1,878 innings.Gibson was selected 22nd overall in the 2009 MLB Draft by the Minnesota Twins out of the University of Missouri. He was drafted in 2010, but had Tommy John surgery the next year, and debuted in the majors with Minnesota in 2013, going on to spend seven years with the Twins. Gibson steadily became a part of the rotation in Minnesota, accumulating a 67–68 record and 4.52 ERA. He never made fewer than 25 starts in a season in which he was healthy and, in total starts between 2013 and 2024, trailed only Max Scherzer on the leaderboard.Following the 2019 campaign, he signed a three-year, $28 million deal with the Texas Rangers.In 2021, he emerged, going 6–3 with a 2.87 ERA in 19 starts before being traded to the Philadelphia Phillies. That season, he was chosen for that year's MLB All-Star Game —the only All-Star selection of his career.Gibson recorded a career-high 15 wins in 2023 with the Baltimore Orioles and made 30 starts in 2024 for the St. Louis Cardinals, finishing with a 4.24 ERA. He last played in the majors in early 2025 when he briefly returned to Baltimore. He was released in May after four starts. He then pitched well at Triple-A Durham for the Rays before opting out of his deal in June.Gibson said he had not heard from turns, and the timing of a family vacation was meaningful in clarifying that decision. He explained on his podcast that it seemed like the necessary time. But the way he spoke, you got the sense that it was a decision he was at peace with, content with the work he had done on the mound.Also Read: MLB Star Shohei Ohtani Pens Children’s Book About His Dog Decoy, Set for 2026 Release Gibson was regarded as a sturdy back-end option his entire career, garnering the reputation as an innings-eater and a great clubhouse guy. For over a decade, he was nothing if not a professional who practiced perseverance as he dealt with injury, new teammates, and performance going hot and cold with a quiet stoicism.Gibson has hinted at coaching or working with the youth as he moves away from pro baseball, but said he would enjoy the time with family for now. Kyle Gibson goes out on his terms — a baseball man, with a legacy of consistency, durability, and leadership.","Kyle gibson, a veteran right-hander, has confirmed his retirement from professional baseball at the major league level.

Luka Doncic could rethink after watching the Los Angeles Lakers moving past LeBron James

It looks like the Los Angeles Lakers could be on the verge of losing one of their top talents — Luka Doncic. Rumors are flying that the Slovenian superstar might bail on the team, and this possible exit seems linked to the way the Lakers have managed LeBron James , a legend whose treatment has caused some tension in the organization.Luka Doncic, a remarkable talent hailing from Slovenia, is currently facing a significant moment with the Lakers. He’s in the fourth year of a five-year, $215 million deal that he inked in [insert year], featuring a player option for the 2025-26 season. This means Doncic could potentially become a free agent as early as next summer if he chooses to opt out and forgo an extension.Starting August 2, 2025, Doncic will be eligible to sign a huge four-year, $229 million extension that would keep him with the Lakers until the end of the 2029-30 season. But earlier this offseason, ESPN’s Bobby Marks had a different perspective. He suggested that Doncic might opt for a shorter, three-year contract instead. Why would he do that? This strategy would allow him to renegotiate a year sooner, with 10 years of NBA experience under his belt—a key milestone that raises the maximum contract limit. Marks provided this analysis in an ESPN piece, emphasizing Doncic’s tactical choices.If Doncic decides not to take the extension at all, he might play through the 2025-26 season and then explore free agency next summer. ESPN’s Brian Windhorst highlighted the importance of this — “This is a stress max right now for Luka. The Lakers are a little bit stressed out about it. If he signs it, relief for the Lakers. … If he does not sign it, he can be a free agent next summer when there are going to be 10-plus teams with cap space.” Windhorst pointed out that various teams in the league are going to start making moves to go after Doncic, which puts more pressure on Los Angeles to keep him content.At the center of this drama is LeBron James, the Lakers' seasoned superstar since 2018. James is in the last year of his contract and will be turning 41 in 2025. The Lakers' management has indicated a move towards a future focused on younger players—specifically Doncic. This change, however, has sparked debate about the way James is being treated.Fox Sports’ Nick Wright pointed to this tension on July 16, suggesting the Lakers’ actions could be alienating Doncic. “I think the way the Lakers are not so subtly dissing LeBron James about how excited they are to be done with [him] — I can’t imagine Luka is happy about that,” Wright said on his show. He argued that the franchise’s apparent eagerness to move on from James, a mentor and teammate to Doncic, might erode the younger star’s trust in the organization. Posts on X, like one from [insert handle], echo this sentiment, noting, “LeBron James feels sidelined as Lakers prioritize Luka Doncic in secret meeting amid trade rumors.”Following the Buss family's sale of the Los Angeles Lakers to Mark Walter, the team is prioritizing Luka Doncic as their franchise star. Doncic can sign a 4-year, $229 million extension, while LeBron James' future remains uncertain as the Lakers manage cap space for 2026 signings. LeBron James wasn't aware about the deal between Buss family and Mark Walter but on the other Luka Doncic knew what was going on.LeBron James and Luka Doncic have a solid connection, with the veteran frequently mentoring the younger player both on and off the court. The Lakers not extending James' contract or at least not giving him the respect that Wright thinks he should get—might be sending a signal to Doncic about how the team views its star players.Luka Doncic’s hesitation to sign a $229 million extension with the Lakers which eligible August 2, 2025, stems from their roster mismanagement and focus on younger stars, ignoring veterans. This could drive Doncic to test free agency in 2026.Also Read: Jalen Williams plans retire his Parents after bagging the $287 million contract and championship season Keeping Doncic isn’t just about having a superstar on the team—it’s about safeguarding their legacy and staying competitive.

Pro wrestling and veteran WWE legend Marcus “Buff” Bagwell has recently undergone an above-the-knee amputation at the age of 55 after years of medical struggles. The wrestling figure had to go through this surgical process due to complications from a 2020 car crash.Following years of surgeries, infections, and a long, exhausting recovery, his fight has now taken a deeply challenging turn. The 55-year-old wrestling veteran shared the update with his fans and revealed the news on his official YouTube channel, confirming that the surgery will take place on July 19, 2025. WWE legend Buff Bagwell’s above-knee leg amputation and his health struggles began following a horrific car crash in August 2020 in Cobb County, Georgia, which left him with multiple injuries, including a shattered kneecap. Taking to his YouTube account, Bagwell shared, ""Today we are 12 hours away from being at the hospital. We have to be there at 7:45 tomorrow morning for an above-the-knee amputation. This is the result of a five-year battle trying to save my leg. ""Looking back at the incident, it all happened during an accident that occurred in Cobb County, Georgia, when Bagwell lost control of his Chevrolet Tahoe while navigating a turn.According to the Cobb County Police Department, the vehicle crossed a median, smashed through a metal fence, and collided with a restroom at a transit bus station.Bagwell suffered life-threatening injuries and was quickly taken to the hospital. This was not the first time he had encountered danger. His body had endured significant physical tolls, as evidenced by his involvement in a serious car crash in 2012.Despite undergoing almost 30 surgeries, Bagwell kept suffering from recurring infections, chronic pain, and mobility problems. After continuous medical struggles, the doctors finally declared that his leg had only a 20% chance of being saved, and even in that case, it would likely be immobile, resulting in the above-knee leg amputation.In a recent statement, veteran WWE wrestler Shawn Stasiak revealed that Bagwell had done “everything he could to avoid this outcome,” but the long battle had reached a point where there was no other option. Marcus Buff Bagwell has devoted the professional wrestling arena for almost 34 years. He has devoted his life to being a professional wrestler. He has worked on several WWE promotions, but spent 10 years in the WCW.Bagwell has held the World Tag Team Championship 5 times with 4 different tag team partners.

Oilers front office makes re-signing their mission

As NHL teams gear up for a potential free-agent frenzy in 2026, the league’s eyes are firmly locked on one name—Connor McDavid. With his current contract set to expire on July 1, 2026, rumors are flying about whether the Edmonton Oilers captain could bolt for a big-market franchise like the Toronto Maple Leafs, New York Rangers, or Los Angeles Kings. But according to longtime Oilers broadcaster Gene Principe, the signs point toward McDavid staying right where he is.During a July 15 appearance on the Spittin’ Chiclets podcast, Gene Principe confidently pushed back on the speculation. When asked how likely he thought it was that Connor McDavid would stay, Principe said, “You know, I’m really confident.” He attributed that to the emotional toll McDavid has endured after two straight Stanley Cup Final losses to the Florida Panthers.“I just saw a guy who’s given everything and then some,” Principe said, describing McDavid as “gutted” following the 2025 loss. Even in that heartbreak, McDavid didn’t lash out or hint at leaving. Instead, he told fans, “Stick with us, because for all of us, it’s going to pay off.” That, said Principe, “was kind of better than ‘I love you.’”There’s no denying other franchises are circling. Toronto Maple Leafs, in particular, has made no secret of its dream pairing of Auston Matthews and McDavid. As NHL insider Chris Johnston put it, “If McDavid becomes a free agent, of course, the Leafs (would try to sign him)—they’ve been nuts.”But McDavid holds all the leverage. As Johnston added, “He’s going to pick his terms.”McDavid has made his intentions clear: “I’m not in a rush to make any decision… If I feel that there’s a good window to win here over and over again, then signing is no problem.”General Manager Stan Bowman affirmed the franchise’s commitment, declaring, “He’s the best player in the league and a no. 1 priority.” While insiders believe an eight-year extension is unlikely, shorter-term deals worth $16–18 million annually are on the table. The message from Edmonton? They’re all-in on keeping McDavid—and right now, it seems he just might be all-in on staying.Also Read: Stanley Cup shame sparks Oilers' panic move—goalie coach out as franchise refuses to face roster truth","Gene principe says connor mcdavid’s heart is still in edmonton.

The 20-year-old goaltender for the Anaheim Ducks could not believe his ears when he heard–“Hey, we’ve got our top six guys and you’re one of them.” Damian Clara received this beyond-belief news on June 16. The netminder only talked about it with Dan Arritt of NHL Network on July 18. He innocently told Arritt, “I didn’t even know there was a thing. I just got a call, and I was like–Okay, wow. What’s that?” Clara hails from Brunico, Italy, and he’s going to represent his home country at the 2026 Olympics!“It’s a big honor. Really happy to get the trust. I will do my best to go there and hopefully help the team. It’s our goal, and we’ll see what happens,” Clara told Arritt. When Arritt asked him how he viewed competing in the Olympics? The netminder said, “Just see it as a challenge. There’s nothing to lose. Exciting opportunity–as I’m still in the development.
