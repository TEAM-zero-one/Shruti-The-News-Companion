“Their body language suggest something…”: Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce's subtle body language during NYC dinner hints at their true connection,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/their-body-language-suggest-something-taylor-swift-and-travis-kelces-subtle-body-language-during-nyc-dinner-hints-at-their-true-connection/articleshow/122148909.cms,"Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce's recent Manhattan outing has sparked discussions about their relationship's potential (TheImageDirect.com)

Body language expert says Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce are showing signs of lasting love

Over the weekend, Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce lit up Manhattan with what many are calling the ultimate display of youthful, romantic energy. But it wasn’t just the cute outfits and dinner date that had fans talking—it was the way they moved, dressed, and interacted. According to body language expert Judi James, their coordinated style and subtle affection hint at something deeper than celebrity chemistry: the belief that they may have truly found “the one.”Popstar Taylor Swift looked radiant in a flirty pale pink mini dress with gold buttons, while Travis Kelce kept it sleek in cropped black trousers, white socks, loafers, and a crisp white shirt. While this might seem like standard celebrity datewear, Judi James sees it as far more intentional. “Taylor and Travis’s styling and their body language suggest something of a time-warp,” she noted, pointing to their classic prom-queen and king aesthetic.This wasn’t just a fashionable night out. Judi James observed that Kelce’s wardrobe choices are starting to mirror Swift’s romantic style. “Travis's short-cropped black pants and white socks suggest he's gradually and happily style-twinning with her,” she said.But it was his subtle movements that said even more. “Travis sucks his lips in at one point to show he's taking the date very seriously and his large paw of a hand encases Taylor's hand in a clasp of macho protection. ”From their body positioning— Kelce confidently leading while Swift walked demurely behind—to the way she held her small handbag close, everything about their presence suggested a couple relishing that new, enchanted stage of romance. “Taylor's body language epitomizes 'demure' here, with her head lowered, her elbows pulled into her waist and that dinky little bag held in one hand,” James added.Judi James believes this ""first-date college look"" may not be accidental. “It could be a desire to stoke the idyllic romantic side of their relationship or a mutual wish to present each other as 'The One', going back to a teen-date state to delete any high-profile and sometimes less than agreeable relationships they've each had with others in the past,” she explained.Also Read: Why Taylor Swift’s love life feels louder with Travis Kelce than it ever did with Joe Alwyn Swift has long built her brand on emotional storytelling, and this softer, sweeter public persona may be a reflection of a new, more intentional chapter.

Legal cloud over Carter Hart 's future complicates Oilers' interest

The Edmonton Oilers’ goaltending situation has come under sharp scrutiny after back-to-back Stanley Cup Final appearances ended in disappointment. Now, in a bold and controversial twist, the Oilers are reportedly exploring the possibility of signing Carter Hart—pending major legal and league developments. NHL insider Kevin Weekes has hinted that there is “mutual interest” between Hart and the Oilers, despite the shadow of the 2018 Hockey Canada sexual assault investigation still looming over the young goalie’s future. While Hart hasn’t played in the NHL since stepping away in 2024, he remains a high-upside netminder with untapped potential—if cleared to return.Hart is one of five players currently facing accusations in connection with the 2018 Hockey Canada sexual assault case. His future in the NHL will depend entirely on the outcome of the trial and any disciplinary measures the league may impose. For the Oilers, who already faced backlash for hiring Stan Bowman—linked to the Chicago Blackhawks' Kyle Beach scandal—adding Hart would risk igniting another public relations firestorm. As one columnist put it: “It is nothing short of a PR nightmare if the Oilers consider signing him.”Still, the potential fit is undeniable from a hockey standpoint.Hart, an Edmonton native and longtime friend of current Oilers goalie Stuart Skinner, could theoretically help shore up the team’s goaltending woes. In his last NHL season, Hart posted a respectable 2.80 GAA and .906 save percentage in 25 starts for the Flyers. Over his career, he’s played 227 games with a .906 SV%—solid numbers for a 25-year-old with room to grow.President of hockey operations Stan Bowman has publicly identified goaltending and forward depth as key areas needing improvement. With the team aiming to get “faster and younger,” Hart checks both boxes—on paper. But given the gravity of the allegations surrounding him, even speculation of his signing is polarizing the fanbase.Also Read: Who is Carter Hart?

Sidney Crosby trade rumors heat up as NHL insider hints at move to rising Canadiens

Could the face of the Pittsburgh Penguins be skating toward a new home in 2026? NHL insider Nick Kypreos believes it's more than just a rumor. During a recent appearance on Sportsnet 590 The Fan, Kypreos floated a bombshell idea—Sidney Crosby, the long-time Penguins captain and one of the league’s all-time greats, could be heading to the Montreal Canadiens after the 2026 Winter Olympics.“Wait till they get Sid Crosby after the Olympics,” Kypreos teased, leaving hosts Justin Bourne and Sam McKee visibly stunned. When challenged to elaborate, Kypreos didn’t back down: “I'm liking the odds a little better than I did maybe a few weeks ago. Something's going on in Pitt. Things are going on. Things are going on…”Though Kypreos didn’t dive into specifics, he pointed to what many believe is an impending rebuild in Pittsburgh. The Penguins have missed the playoffs for two consecutive seasons, signaling the possible end of an era. With aging stars and no clear path to contention, speculation is growing that the team may be heading toward a teardown.“He's too good right now to just be a babysitter for the next three years,” Kypreos emphasized. “It will be such a disservice to the history of our game if we watch him stay in Pittsburgh the next three or four years.”The Montreal Canadiens, valued at over $3 billion, are an ideal landing spot for Crosby, should the Penguins part ways with their longtime leader. The Habs are a young team on the rise and could greatly benefit from Crosby’s experience and leadership. Analysts already envision Crosby anchoring the top line, with captain Nick Suzuki sliding into the second center spot, while Kirby Dach and Alex Newhook could shift down or to the wings.Also Read: NHL Predictions: 3-time All-Star Ryan Suter likely to retire as market interest fades in offseason Though it remains a hypothetical scenario, Kypreos’ comments have sparked serious intrigue across the hockey world.

Why the Golden State Warriors Might Pull the Trigger

LeBron’s Future: What’s Next?

Thecould be finalizing a massive seven-team trade that ships out Kevin Durant —but this may only be the beginning. This move signals a bold new direction for the franchise. And now, rumors are swirling that their next target could be the biggest name in basketball: LeBron James With Durant gone and the Warriors clearly in roster-flipping mode, all eyes are on whether they’ll make an audacious push to pair Stephen Curry with the Lakers’ four-time MVP. The financials mysteriously align, the trade frameworks exist, and the Warriors have the assets to pull it off. But is trading for a 39-year-old LeBron the right move for a team torn between contending now and planning for the future?The Golden State Warriors ’ involvement in the seven-team deal marks a significant shift in their roster strategy. Though the trade primarily sends Durant elsewhere, Golden State’s front office appears to be laying the groundwork for another major move.The Golden State Warriors were part of a massive seven-team trade that saw them send Kevin Durant elsewhere in exchange for young prospects Alex Toohey and Jamai Mahshack. This trade marks a significant roster shake-up for the Warriors, signaling a shift toward developing future talent while parting ways with one of the league’s most prolific scorers.While the immediate return seems modest, the Warriors’ flexibility and future assets could set the stage for a bigger acquisition.According to Golden State of Mind’s Brady Klopfer, the Warriors could pivot toward a trade for Lakers forward LeBron James . The financials align surprisingly well, making this more than just a pipe dream.Klopfer noted: “Any James trade would almost certainly be centered around a swap with Jimmy Butler III. In fact, LeBron and his son Bronny James have a combined salary that’s less than $500,000 off of what Butler’s salary is, so the finances work fairly seamlessly.” (H/t: Sporting News)Here’s how a potential trade could break down:- Warriors receive: LeBron James and Bronny James- Lakers receive: Jimmy Butler and two first-round picksThe inclusion of Bronny adds another layer, as teams have shown interest in drafting him to potentially lure LeBron.Golden State has several reasons to consider this move:1. Championship Window: With Stephen Curry still playing at an elite level, adding LeBron could extend their title contention.2. Olympic Chemistry: James and Curry thrived together in the 2024 Olympics, where LeBron nearly averaged a triple-double and Curry lit up France with eight three-pointers in the gold medal game.3. Veteran Leadership: Both players bring unmatched experience, with eight combined NBA championships.However, there are risks:- Butler has already proven to fit the Golden State Warriors’ system.- LeBron’s age (39) and long-term durability remain questions.LeBron James recently opted into his $52.6 million player option, but his agent, Rich Paul, hinted that the Lakers are open to moves that benefit LeBron’s career at this stage. This has fueled speculation about potential trades.Curry previously dismissed the idea of teaming up with LeBron James in the NBA, saying in 2022, “I’m good right now.” But after failing to win a title since 2022, the Warriors’ superstar may reconsider.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Milwaukee Bucks could send $186 million superstar to the San Antonio Spurs and form deadly duo with Victor Wembanyama The Warriors’ front office is clearly thinking big. Swapping Butler for LeBron would be a gamble, but the upside—a Curry-James duo in the West—could redefine the NBA landscape. As Klopfer pointed out, the financials work. Now, it’s about whether Golden State believes the reward outweighs the risk.","The golden state warriors were part of a massive seven-team trade that saw them send kevin durant elsewhere in exchange for young prospects alex toohey and jamai mahshack.

One photo was enough to spark wild speculation among NBA fans. On July 4, LeBron James was spotted at the Cleveland Cavaliers’ practice facility and the internet exploded with talk of a surprise reunion. With trade rumors already swirling around the Los Angeles Lakers star, the image sparked wild speculation. But LeBron James quickly addressed a viral photo of him and his response shut down the noise and settled the rumors, at least for now.On July 4, a fan account called Hoop Central posted a photo of LeBron James at the Cleveland Cavaliers’ practice facility, calling it a “surprise” appearance. The image showed him training alongside a Cavaliers summer league player. But within hours, LeBron jumped onto X, explaining:“And every summer since it was built. I live here still and train every summer. Got damn yall bored man! Go get a plate of food somewhere and enjoy the 4th of July!”In his post, he clearly said this visit was old news, not a secret push to rejoin Cleveland. He lives nearby and has trained there before. He urged fans to relax and celebrate instead.In late June, LeBron opted for his $ 52.6 million contract with the Los Angeles Lakers. The move came when the Lakers re-shaped their roster, including the arrival of Luka Doncic and the trading of Anthony Davis. As a result, doubts about the franchise's direction and the role of Lebron are increasing.Labron's agent, Rich Paul, told ESPN that James wants to win another championship.Despite training in Cleveland, LeBron did not show any indication that he’s seeking a trade. NBA insiders have said the Cavaliers are “not that interested” in pursuing a reunion.Inside the Lakers' locker room, the return of DeAndre Ayton and Jaxson Hayes suggests this summer that the team is aiming for stability, not big shifts. When LeBron goes into what may be his last season, he seems focused on finding success with the Lakers and not returning to his old team.In the relentless world of NBA speculation, context is everything. A shared photo had fans whispering trade rumors, champion reunions, and surprise moves. But LeBron’s quick explanation brought clarity: he was training, not touring potential trades. Now, as the Lakers close in on finalizing their core, fans and analysts can breathe a little easier, for now.","Lebron james responds after viral cleveland cavaliers' photo triggers los angeles lakers exit rumors.

NEW DELHI: In a stunning display of flair and fearlessness, Yashasvi Jaiswal etched his name in cricketing folklore on Friday by becoming the joint-fastest Indian to reach 2,000 Test runs, alongside legends Rahul Dravid and Virender Sehwag. The 23-year-old southpaw reached the milestone during India’s second innings on Day 3 of the gripping second Test against England at Edgbaston.Jaiswal accomplished the feat in just his 40th Test innings, drawing level with Dravid and Sehwag and surpassing greats such as Sachin Tendulkar, Sunil Gavaskar, and Vijay Hazare.In terms of matches played, Jaiswal now stands alone - the fastest Indian ever to 2,000 Test runs, achieving the landmark in his 21st Test, eclipsing Gavaskar’s long-standing record (23 Tests).He reached the milestone with typical swagger - a thick edge wide of gully that flew away to the boundary.At just 23 years and 188 days, he also became the second-youngest Indian to reach the mark, behind only the immortal Tendulkar, who did it at 20 years and 330 days.Jaiswal’s innings was short but explosive - a 22-ball 28-run blitz featuring six crisply struck boundaries. But his cameo ended in controversy. Struck in front by Josh Tongue while attempting a booming drive, Jaiswal reviewed the LBW decision, only for England captain Ben Stokes to furiously argue that the DRS timer had expired. After a heated exchange with umpire Sharfuddoula, the review was accepted - and the decision stood as three reds sealed his fate.Earlier in the match, Jaiswal missed a richly-deserved century by just 13 runs in the first innings, falling for 87 after being deceived by Stokes. Still, his consistency and confidence continue to redefine India’s batting template.","Yashasvi jaiswal becomes joint-fastest indian to reach 2,000 test runs.

Outlook and Potential Impact of Jalen Bridges on the Boston Celtics

Thehave signed, a 6-foot-8 forward and former teammate of Kevin Durant on the Phoenix Suns, as a potential replacement for Jayson Tatum, who is expected to miss most, if not all, of the 2025-26 NBA season due to a ruptured Achilles tendon. This move comes after a tumultuous postseason for Boston, which saw them lose Tatum to injury during the Eastern Conference Semifinals against the New York Knicks.Jalen Bridges played alongside Kevin Durant during the 2024-25 NBA season with the Phoenix Suns , albeit in a limited role. He was on a two-way contract and appeared in just eight games, averaging 1.1 points per game on 28.6% shooting from the field and from three-point range.Despite his modest professional stats, Bridges was a notable perimeter shooter in college, finishing his career at West Virginia and Baylor with a 37% three-point percentage, including two seasons above 39%.At 24 years old, Jalen Bridges brings size, youth, and a reputation as a capable spot-up shooter, which could fit well in coach Joe Mazzulla’s offensive system.Jayson Tatum suffered a season-ending Achilles injury in May 2025 and underwent successful surgery, with an expected nine-month recovery timeline.This mirrors the recovery period Kevin Durant faced after a similar injury, which caused him to miss an entire season.The Boston Celtics , facing the challenge of replacing Tatum’s production, have opted for a low-risk, high-upside move by bringing Bridges onto their summer league roster, with a chance to earn a full roster spot in training camp.While Jalen Bridges is not expected to replicate Tatum’s all-around impact, his shooting ability and size could allow him to carve out a role, especially if he impresses during summer league and training camp.The Boston Celtics’ decision to sign Bridges reflects a pragmatic approach: seeking affordable, developmental options to help fill the void left by Tatum, rather than making a blockbuster trade or high-cost acquisition.Also read: Bronny James Pay Cut Rumor Debunked: Viral Hoax Fooled NBA Fans In summary, the Boston Celtics’ addition of Jalen Bridges—Kevin Durant’s former 6-foot-8 teammate—offers them a potential rotation piece as they navigate the uncertainty of Tatum’s recovery.

Based on Brad Marchand’s longevity, Steve Yzerman builds a plan around Dylan Larkin and Alex DeBrincat

Steve Yzerman Addresses the Detroit Red Wings Free Agency | July 3, 2025

Finally, a late-career contract: At 37 years of age, the Florida Panther winger has signed a six-year, $31.5-million contract that will keep him in the league through the age of 43. The question being raised there, beyond the headlines: Can the modern athlete extend his prime years? Being a Red Wings general manager, Yzerman believes in this and is cherishing that ideology for his stars, Dylan Larkin and Alex DeBrincat.Brad Marchand’s contract with the Florida Panthers is no longer just money or roster talk; it is a testimony that elite players can remain effective well into their late 30s and early 40s. Scoring 20 points in 23 postseason games, Marchand was the key factor in the Panthers' back-to-back Stanley Cups and delivered a roar of validation for this long-term commitment.For Steve Yzerman, who has been sketching Detroit's highway to playoff relevance, Marchand's scenario has the loud and clear message that even hated stars have huge appeal. Speaking about his core, Yzerman joked about having captain Dylan Larkin ""for another 15 years.""But the philosophy behind it is building a future around players such as 28-year-old Larkin and 27-year-old Alex DeBrincat, who happen to be in their physical prime and aren't slowing down.Larkin's consistency-high 576 points over 734 games and nearly 20 minutes of average ice time performed well with DeBrincat, who has 517 career points, 137 since hitting the ice in Detroit. The Wings front office is probably rather confident this tandem can be counted on for a long-term run, as they continue to groom more youth stars around them.On the other hand, with the NHL about to institute an 84-game schedule, Yzerman has offered his insights into the opportunities and challenges it brings along. He praised the balance it brings to divisional rivalries, yet with another eye placed on player load management, with particular concern for veterans and fringe roster guys.Also Read: Gary Bettman talks about NHL growth, global play and future goals on the Pat McAfee Show The procedure of renewing Brad Marchand’s contract has sparked a new wave of conversation about athlete longevity in the NHL.

Kevin Durant’s Reaction to Pierce’s Claim

Context and Legacy of Pierce’s Self Praise

recently ignited a firestorm among NBA fans by declaring himself the “best pure scorer in the history of the NBA,” placing himself above icons like Kevin Durant, Michael Jordan, and Kobe Bryant. The bold assertion came in response to LeBron James ’ recent praise of Durant as the league’s most “equipped” scorer ever on the ‘Mind the Game’ podcast.On Fox Sports’ “Speak,” Paul Pierce argued that while Durant’s height (6’11”) gives him a unique advantage—allowing him to shoot over any defender and “not really see defense”—Pierce himself should be included in the conversation for greatest pure scorer. He insisted he could do it all offensively: pull up from the elbow, knock down threes, and score in the post. Pierce did concede that his shooting efficiency was lower than Durant’s, admitting, “I shot more bad shots than Kevin,” but maintained that his overall scoring arsenal was unmatched.NBA fans were quick and merciless in their response. Social media erupted with disbelief and ridicule:- “He’s not even a top 50 scorer of all time 😂😂😂.”- “For a guy nicknamed The Truth, he sure does lie a lot.”- “I love the Truth, but he needs to slow down.”- “Never averaged more than 26 by the way!”Many pointed to the statistical gap between Pierce and Durant. Durant has averaged 26+ points per game in 13 of his 17 seasons, while Pierce only reached that mark twice and averaged 20+ points per game in eight seasons. Durant’s career shooting splits and scoring consistency far outpace Pierce’s, making the latter’s claim difficult for fans to accept.Interestingly, Kevin Durant responded with unexpected grace. Instead of firing back, he supported Paul Pierce’s confidence, saying, “I didn’t really see a weakness in Paul’s game. I understand where his confidence comes from”. This mutual respect between two generations was a rare moment of sportsmanship amid the heated debate.Paul Pierce’s confidence is not new; he has a history of outspoken takes, especially in his post-playing media career. While his scoring prowess—highlighted by his 2008 Finals MVP and ranking 18th on the NBA’s all-time scoring list—is undeniable, most analysts and fans agree he does not belong in the same tier as Durant when it comes to pure scoring ability.Durant, still performing at an All-Star level at age 36, continues to demonstrate why he’s widely regarded as one of the most unstoppable scorers in league history, combining size, skill, and efficiency at a level few have matched.Also read: Austin Reaves’ Agent Denies Rift With Luka Doncic as Lakers Reaffirm Commitment to Star Duo Paul Pierce’s self-comparison to Kevin Durant as the NBA’s greatest pure scorer was met with widespread skepticism and humor from fans, who pointed to both statistical evidence and the eye test.

Austin Reaves’ On-Court Chemistry and Performance

Amid ongoing rumors of discord within the Los Angeles Lakers ’ agent has publicly and unequivocally denied any rift between his client and superstar teammate Luka Doncic. The speculation arose after NBA insider John Gambadoro claimed on the ""Burns and Gambo"" show that both LeBron James and Austin Reaves were unhappy playing with Doncic, suggesting that this discomfort could impact the Lakers’ future roster decisions.The rumors gained traction following the Lakers’ acquisition of Luka Doncic ahead of the 2024-25 NBA season. Gambadoro stated, “LeBron does not like playing with Luka. Reaves does not like playing with Luka. Reaves does not like getting the ball with two seconds left on the shot clock. LeBron is not fond of playing with Luka. The Lakers are going to turn their attention to build around Luka, not LeBron”. These comments fueled speculation about locker room chemistry and the future direction of the Lakers’ roster. Austin Reaves ’ agent, Aaron Reilly, responded swiftly and decisively to these claims. In a statement released to multiple media outlets, Reilly asserted: “Austin has nothing but the utmost respect for Luka and truly enjoys playing alongside him. Any suggestion to the contrary is completely false. He’s excited to be on the court with Luka—both now and in the future”.Reilly’s statement was echoed across NBA media, with insiders and journalists noting that Reaves and Doncic have developed a strong professional relationship during their time together on the Lakers.The agent’s remarks were intended to “nip this report in the bud before it grew more legs,” reinforcing that Reaves is committed to the team’s vision and his partnership with Doncic.Despite the rumors, the Lakers’ front office has made it clear that they view Reaves and Doncic as core pieces for the franchise’s future. The team recently offered Reaves a four-year, $89.2 million max contract extension, which he declined, opting instead to play out the third season of his current deal and potentially enter free agency in 2026. This decision led to further speculation about his satisfaction with the team and his role alongside Doncic, but both the player and his agent have reiterated his desire to stay in Los Angeles and continue building with Doncic.Statistical analysis from the 2024-25 season indicates that Reaves’ performance actually improved when sharing the court with Doncic, with increased efficiency and offensive output. Both players averaged over 20 points and five assists per game, placing them among the league’s elite backcourt duos. While concerns remain about their collective defensive capabilities, there is no evidence to suggest personal animosity or reluctance to play together.Also read: Toronto Raptors Sign Jakob Poeltl to Four-Year, $104 Million Contract Extension The rumors of a rift between Austin Reaves and Luka Doncic have been categorically denied by Reaves’ agent, who emphasized his client’s respect and enthusiasm for playing alongside Doncic.

Michael Irvin’s charisma, controversy, and a violent past collide

NFL Hall of Famer Michael Irvin, once the heartbeat of the Dallas Cowboys' 1990s dynasty, is facing renewed backlash after disturbing details about a violent locker room incident from 1998 resurfaced. During a heated altercation with teammate Everett McIver, Irvin allegedly stabbed him in the neck with a pair of barber scissors. Though the incident was severe enough to risk jail time, no legal action was taken. The team reportedly went to great lengths to keep the story out of public view.The explosive claim was made by journalist Jeff Pearlman on the Going Deep with Chad & JT podcast, where he described the scene during the Cowboys’ preseason camp in Wichita Falls, Texas. The franchise had brought in a barber to cater to Black players, and tensions rose when Irvin confronted McIver during a haircut. According to Pearlman, the confrontation escalated into violence in seconds.“Michael Irvin grabbed the barber's scissors and stabbed him in the neck, dragging them. And blood gushed everywhere,” Pearlman said.At the time, Irvin was already on probation, making any legal entanglement potentially career-ending.To avoid criminal proceedings, team owner Jerry Jones allegedly arranged a multi-million dollar settlement with McIver to ensure his silence. The matter was never officially reported, and the locker room incident faded into obscurity—until now.Despite his off-field issues, Irvin remained a central figure in one of the NFL’s most successful franchises. Known for his leadership and intensity, he delivered seven 1,000-yard seasons, earned three All-Pro selections, and helped lead the Cowboys to three Super Bowl titles. Yet this incident paints a darker picture behind his famed charisma.Pearlman also recalled a similar outburst during Irvin’s college days at the University of Miami, where head coach Jimmy Johnson once warned him after a cafeteria brawl. “Do you want to be a boxer or a football player?” Johnson asked, signaling a turning point in Irvin’s journey.Also read: Sean Payton’s sideline clash with Bo Nix sparks fresh buzz over Broncos’ offensive reboot Irvin officially announced his retirement during the 2000 offseason, after a severe neck injury, sustained during a game in 1999.

Benjamin was asked if he called women to his house only to get them drunk, and have s*x. Cristiano Ronaldo was accused by a woman who alleged that he took her to his hotel suite in Las Vegas and sexually assaulted her. What happened before and after the charge? Let’s read on.In February 2016, Josh Halliday of The Guardian reported that former right winger for the Sunderland AFC, Adam Johnson, sexually touched a 15-year-old fan who idolised him after he gave her a signed football shirt. Prosecutor Kate Blackwell shared, “He was used to getting what he wanted. He gave her the shirts and autographs with the knowledge that she would want to please him in return. He knew her age. He knew she looked up to him; he knew he could take advantage of her, and he did. ” Johnson pleaded guilty to one count of sexual activity with a child and one count of grooming. He was jailed for six years. But on March 22, 2019, he was released after serving half of his jail term.In July 2023, BBC News reported that former Manchester City footballer Benjamin Mendy was cleared of r*ping a woman and attempting to rape another. One woman accused him of r*ping her in his mansion, while another came forward and said that she too was molested by him in his mansion. Mr. Benjamin Aina KC, the prosecutor in the case, asked Mendy, “You wanted women who came to your house to party, get drunk, and have s*x?” Mr. Mendy replied, “If they want. I will never force to have s*x with a woman.” He was found not guilty of r*pe charges. Manchester City released him in 2023. Currently, he is playing for FC Zurich of the Swiss Super League as a left-back.In October 2023, ESPN reported that Kathryn Mayorga was 25 when she met Cristiano Ronaldo at a nightclub in 2009. She went with him and other people to his Las Vegas hotel suite. She alleged that Ronaldo sexually assaulted her in a bedroom. She filed a lawsuit ten years after the incident. Ronaldo, through his lawyers, maintained that the s*x was consensual. In 2010, both of them reached a confidentiality agreement wherein Mayorga received $375,000 - Leslie Mark Stovall, her lawyer, acknowledged it. The case was dismissed in 2022 by U.S. District Judge Jennifer Dorsey in Las Vegas. Dorsey imposed a fine of $335,000 on Mayorga’s lead lawyer, Stovall, for acting in “bad faith.”",Cristiano ronaldo was accused by a woman who alleged that he took her to his hotel suite in las vegas and sexually assaulted her.
