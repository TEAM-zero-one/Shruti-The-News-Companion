Why India are in deep trouble | T20 World Cup 2026 | India vs South Africa



India T20 World Cup Qualification Scenario

Scenario 1 – India win both matches

Scenario 2 – India win one match

Team India’s hopes of reaching the T20 World Cup 2026 semi-finals have taken a serious hit after a crushing 76-run defeat to South Africa in their opening Super 8 fixture in Ahmedabad on Sunday. Led by Suryakumar Yadav , India were thoroughly outplayed as the Proteas dominated both innings.South Africa, after opting to bat first, posted a commanding 187/7. David Miller anchored the innings with a fluent 63, while Dewald Brevis provided momentum with a brisk 45. Despite Jasprit Bumrah ’s impressive spell of 3/15, India were unable to prevent South Africa from finishing strongly.The chase unravelled quickly. India never settled into any rhythm and were eventually bowled out for just 111. Marco Jansen was the chief destroyer with four wickets, sealing a comprehensive win and inflicting major damage on India’s Net Run Rate, which now stands at -3.800.The defeat leaves India in a must-win situation. They need victories in both of their remaining Super 8 matches against West Indies and Zimbabwe to ensure qualification for the Final Four. Even then, scenarios could complicate matters.If India secure wins in both fixtures, they will finish with four points.In most cases, that should be enough to qualify. However, complications arise if South Africa win only one of their remaining matches and the winner of the West Indies vs Zimbabwe clash also defeats South Africa. In that situation, three teams could end up on four points, pushing qualification to Net Run Rate calculations. Ideally for India, South Africa winning both of their remaining matches would simplify the equation and reduce reliance on NRR.If India manage just one win, they will require South Africa to win all their remaining games. Additionally, India’s sole victory must come against the winner of the West Indies vs Zimbabwe contest. That outcome would leave India, West Indies and Zimbabwe level on two points each, once again making Net Run Rate the deciding factor.India now find themselves under immense pressure. A defeat alone may not have been disastrous, but the scale of the loss and the severe blow to their Net Run Rate have left their campaign hanging by a thread.",India lost to south africa by 76 runs in their opening super 8 fixture.

Boston Celtics vs Phoenix Suns Key matchups (February 24, 2026)

Theplay theat Footprint Center on. This game looks different from what it could have been earlier in the season.Both teams are missing key players. That changes how the game will be played. It is less about star power and more about which team can adjust better and get enough from its rotation.Boston will be without Jayson Tatum, who is still out after Achilles surgery. Jaylen Brown has also been ruled out with a knee contusion. That leaves a large gap in scoring and ball handling.Max Shulga is unavailable due to a G League assignment. Amari Williams is listed as doubtful.Phoenix also has several players out. Devin Booker remains sidelined with a hip strain. Dillon Brooks is out with a fractured hand. Cole Anthony is not with the team. Jordan Goodwin and Haywood Highsmith are also out. Grayson Allen is listed as questionable.With Tatum, Brown, and Booker not playing, both teams will rely on secondary options.Boston enters the game with a 37-19 record. They are second in the Eastern Conference and trail Cleveland.Phoenix is around the .500 mark in the Western Conference. The team is still in the playoff mix after recent roster changes that included adding Jalen Green and Dillon Brooks.Boston has been steady on both ends of the floor. They average 115.3 points per game and allow 108.0. Their shooting numbers are among the better ones in the league, and they do not turn the ball over often.Phoenix has had issues on defense. In recent games, they are allowing 126.0 points. Their scoring has held up, but efficiency and rebounding have been inconsistent.Boston has an edge in rebounding and ball control. That could matter in a game where both teams are short-handed.Boston has a slight edge in past regular-season meetings. These games have often been lower scoring.Phoenix usually plays better at home, but injuries make this harder to predict.Boston will need production from Derrick White and Payton Pritchard. They will have to handle more of the scoring and playmaking.For Phoenix, Jalen Green takes on a bigger role without Booker.Inside, Phoenix could use Nick Richards or Mark Williams. Boston will rely on Nikola Vucevic. Bench players like Baylor Scheierman and Royce O’Neale may also have a larger role.This game will likely come down to which team executes better with its available players.",Boston enters the game with a 37-19 record.

Pros and cons for both teams

Thehave been linked to a possible move for. as they look to improve their lineup for the 2026 season. With Miguel Cabrera no longer playing, the team needs a hitter who can take on a central role in the offense.The idea of this trade is still speculative, but it reflects where Detroit stands. The team has built a strong group of young players and may now look to add an established name. Bringing in Tatis would signal a shift from rebuilding to trying to compete.In this scenario, Fernando Tatis Jr, 27, would move to Detroit Tigers. He is signed through 2034, with his salary rising to $36 million per year. Any deal would depend on him agreeing to waive his no-trade clause.San Diego Padres would receive Max Clark, Kevin McGonigle, Jackson Jobe, and Colt Keith. Clark hit .271 with 14 home runs in the minors in 2025. McGonigle batted .305 with 19 home runs. Jobe had a 4.22 ERA in limited major league action. Keith hit .256 with 13 home runs in the majors. Detroit would be giving up multiple young players with upside.Fernando Tatis Jr would likely play right field and join Riley Greene and Kerry Carpenter.His 2025 numbers, 25 home runs, 32 stolen bases, and 111 runs, address areas where Detroit needs more production.He would also become the main name in the lineup. The team already has players like Spencer Torkelson and Gleyber Torres, and adding Tatis would raise expectations. With Tarik Skubal leading the rotation, Detroit would be aiming to compete in the division.For the San Diego Padres, this type of deal is about roster balance and long-term planning. Moving Fernando Tatis Jr would reduce a large financial commitment and bring in younger players.The return adds depth around Xander Bogaerts, Manny Machado, and Jackson Merrill. Jobe would help the pitching group, while Clark and McGonigle add hitting potential. It also gives the team more flexibility as it continues to build around prospects like Ethan Salas.The numbers show Fernando Tatis Jr ahead of Detroit’s current outfield in power and speed.For Detroit Tigers, the move adds a proven hitter and more speed to the lineup. It also gives the team a recognizable face. The downside is losing top prospects and taking on a long contract, along with some injury risk.For San Diego Padres, the trade brings in several young players and reduces payroll pressure. The risk is giving up a player who is already performing at a high level. The return depends on how those players develop.Also read: MLB trade rumors: Los Angeles Dodgers predicted to land $300 million Detroit Tigers superstar Tarik Skubal in potential deadline blockbuster Detroit Tigers would be taking a direct approach by trading future talent for a proven player. If Tatis performs as expected, it improves their chances in the division.

Jake Guentzel skips White House visit and State of the Union to focus on Lightning return



Jake Guentzel has declined President Donald Trump's invitation to visit White House. Guentzel had just helped deliver one of the most meaningful wins in American hockey history. Yet while his teammates flew to Washington to be honored, the gold medal hero stayed behind, far from the spotlight. The decision was not about avoiding the moment. It was about returning to the grind that defines players at his level.Fresh off the dramatic Olympic triumph, the American forward chose routine over ceremony. While the celebration shifted to the White House and the State of the Union address, his focus had already turned back to the NHL season. For Guentzel, the next game mattered just as much as the last victory.Jake Guentzel was not on the government aircraft that carried most of Team USA from Miami to Washington. Instead, he remained in Florida, with the Tampa Bay Lightning confirming he stayed back as the club resumed its push toward the Stanley Cup playoffs. The timing was tight. The Olympic break had ended, and NHL responsibilities were calling.His absence stood out, especially after his role in securing gold at the Milan Cortina Olympic Games.The United States defeated Canada 2 to 1 in overtime, with Jack Hughes scoring the winner. It was the country’s first Olympic gold in men’s hockey since 1980, ending a 46 year wait that had lingered over generations of players.Donald Trump welcomed the players who attended. “I recognize every one of you. I know every one of you,” he said while greeting them. He smiled as he shook hands and added, “Big guys.”Still, Guentzel was not alone in missing the visit. Several players, including Brock Nelson, Kyle Connor, Jake Oettinger, and Jackson LaCombe, were also absent. Various reasons surfaced, ranging from family time to travel schedules. Quinn Hughes, who did attend, summed up the excitement from those present. “It’s not something you get to do every Tuesday,” he said. “It’s going to be special for us.”Guentzel won the Stanley Cup with the Pittsburgh Penguins in 2017 and became the first University of Nebraska Omaha alum to win an Olympic medal. Yet he has rarely lingered in celebration.The Lightning now need him back. The season is moving fast, and contenders cannot afford pauses. Gold medals are forever, but so is the pursuit of the next one.",Jake guentzel declined president donald trump's invitation to visit white house.

Top 5 college Basketball coaches on hot seat

Adrian Autry - Syracuse

Jeff Capel - Pittsburgh

Kim English - Providence

Bobby Hurley - Arizona State

Porter Moser - Oklahoma

As the regular season nearing its end, the college basketball coaching carousel is beginning to take shape. Several high-major teams are having a hard time deciding who should lead them as the conference championships get closer and their chances of making the NCAA Tournament are on the line. Poor records, lack of postseason success, and growing expectations have placed multiple coaches under pressure heading into March Madness.While some programs may wait until after the tournament to make changes, recent results suggest that uncertainty surrounds several jobs across major conferences. Here’s a look at five coaches whose futures remain unclear.Replacing a legendary figure is never easy, but Adrian Autry has struggled to lift Syracuse back into NCAA Tournament contention. The Orange have endured another disappointing season, including heavy losses against top opponents. Administrative transitions at the university could complicate the timing of any decision, but continued absence from March Madness has intensified pressure on the program to consider a new direction.Jeff Capel’s tenure at Pittsburgh has been defined by inconsistency. Despite reaching the NCAA Tournament once during his time with the program, the Panthers’ recent struggles including a difficult season well below expectations have raised questions about long-term progress.Financial factors, particularly a significant buyout, could influence whether Pittsburgh moves on, but results on the court have kept the spotlight firmly on Capel.Providence entered the season hoping for a step forward, yet close losses and inconsistent performances have produced another frustrating campaign. Kim English has recruited promising young talent, but patience appears to be wearing thin after multiple seasons without significant postseason success. With strong NIL investment and expectations to compete in the Big East, the program could evaluate its options if results do not improve.Bobby Hurley finds himself coaching the final year of his contract without a clear extension in place. Arizona State has not been among the NCAA Tournament contenders this season, leaving uncertainty about the program’s next move. The Sun Devils’ position in a competitive conference and questions about long-term financial commitment add further complexity to Hurley’s situation.Porter Moser guided Oklahoma to the NCAA Tournament last year, but overall conference results during his tenure have remained inconsistent. With a new athletic director in place, the program could choose to make an early leadership change. At the same time, Moser’s experience and previous postseason appearance give him a case to retain the role if the team finishes the season strongly.As March Madness gets closer, coaches often make decisions based on how their teams are doing at the end of the season. Tournament appearances can buy time, but ongoing problems may speed up change. In the next few weeks, we'll find out if these coaches stay in their jobs or join the offseason coaching shuffle. They have to balance expectations, finances, and roster development.","Several high-major teams are having a hard time deciding who should lead them.

Playoff push vs. trade value presents defining moment for Nashville Predators’ season



Nashville Predators TRADE Steven Stamkos To Los Angeles Kings? | NHL Trade Rumors

The Nashville Predators are back in action after the Olympic break, and with them comes one of the most intriguing decisions in the NHL: do they make a push for the playoffs or trade away one of the league’s most coveted assets—Steven Stamkos?Despite the rumors, Steven Stamkos is adamant that his priorities have not changed. In a recent interview with The Athletic, the veteran NHL star made it clear that his main concern is helping Nashville win games, not speculating about potential trades. Nevertheless, with the trade deadline rapidly approaching and playoff contenders looking to bolster their scoring, the situation surrounding the veteran forward is rapidly becoming one of the most intriguing storylines in the league.Steven Stamkos’ resurgence is the key reason why his name is at the forefront of trade rumors. However, any potential trade comes with one huge caveat. Steven Stamkos has a full no-movement clause, giving him the ultimate say in whether a trade occurs or not. He even acknowledged this fact, saying he has not been asked to waive the clause and is not spending time thinking about what could potentially happen. This gives the veteran a lot of control over what happens in the next two weeks.As far as the Predators are concerned, this is a tough decision.His $8 million cap hit was once considered a problem, but his goal-scoring has come back around, making the contract much more palatable for teams looking for a short-term boost. With two years left after this season, any team that trades for him is essentially taking a chance that he can continue scoring at a 30-goal pace well into his 30s, a risk some teams may be willing to take to make a playoff run.Meanwhile, in the locker room, the emphasis is still on the bottom line. Unlike a year ago, the Predators are playing important late-season games, just what Stamkos had in mind when he signed his deal. With 25 games left in the season, the Predators’ playoff chances are still alive, and every point may be crucial in determining whether they are buyers, sellers, or hold steady.For Stamkos, at least for now, the message is simple: win games and let the front office take care of the rest. Whether he is still playing in Nashville or is the big fish of the trade deadline, Stamkos’ play down the stretch may have a big impact not only on the Predators’ future but also on the entire NHL playoff race.","Steven stamkos' resurgence is the key reason why his name is at the forefront of trade rumors.

How Offset’s ringside interference shifted momentum against Kofi Kingston

Celebrity involvement adds fuel to WWE Monday Night Raw storyline

When Grammy-nominated rapper Offset was thrust directly into a high-profile match at the February 23 episode of WWE Monday Night Raw, fans were treated to an unexpected crossover moment. But what started as a typical celebrity cameo soon turned into an all-out brawl, shaking up a veteran WWE star, Kofi Kingston.The artist’s antics at ringside amid affairs already boiling inside the arena sent things spiraling and ultimately determined the outcome of the match. The dramatic sequence also blurred the line between entertainment and in-ring competition, becoming one of the night’s most talked-about segments.Offset sat ringside to lend support to up-and-coming WWE star Je’Von Evans, before turning heads of both fans and competitors alike. Tensions were high as Kingston’s associates tried to interfere throughout the match. The ringside presence of Xavier Woods and the brash Grayson Waller added layers of distraction, continually breaking Evans’ offensive rhythm.The turning point came after Waller tried to get back into the action.Offset confronted him at ringside, and in a surprising moment, physically hoisted Waller, tossing him over the announce table. The distraction was substantial, forcing Kingston's focus away from the man in front of him and onto the madness outside of the ring.That brief lapse proved costly. Inside the ring, Evans capitalized by hitting his finishing move on Wright to earn the 3-count. Although Evans picked up the official win, it’s easy to argue that Offset’s presence was what ultimately tipped the scales.Surprise celebrity appearances are nothing new to WWE, especially on flagship programming such as WWE Monday Night Raw. But Offset’s physical appearance took this segment beyond a mere cameo. His readiness to confront an active roster member directly inserted an unpredictable element into a storyline.Fans of both parties reacted quickly to the confrontation, with many debating the implications of celebrity involvement in competitive matches. Offset had also established his alignment for the night with pointed remarks about Kingston’s faction earlier in the evening. Once the dust had settled, the segment left questions of whether Offset’s involvement was a one-night spectacle or the beginning of an arc in terms of a greater storyline. With Kingston’s pride wounded, and Evans getting a surge of momentum from a marquee victory, the crossover moment could have ripples for weeks to come, cementing WWE’s strategy of fusing mainstream star power with mat drama so as to keep fans guessing.","Rapper offset was thrust directly into a high-profile match at the february 23 episode of wwe monday night raw.

Philadelphia Eagles: NFL Combine 2026: A.J. Brown most likely to leave the Philadelphia Eagles after Nick Sirianni makes vague comment,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/nfl-combine-2026-a-j-brown-most-likely-to-leave-the-philadelphia-eagles-after-nick-sirianni-makes-vague-comment/articleshow/128758113.cms,"Image - X

""No Guarantees"": Nick Sirianni’s Shocking Quote on A.J. Brown’s Future with Eagles



""Will A.J. be here next season? I think we're still in a spot, like, I can't guarantee how anything is going to play out into next season. I’m thinking I’m going to be the coach next season, but you can’t guarantee anything past tomorrow,""

expects

""You go into the league year listening to offers for everything and anything.""

The Philadelphia Eagles arrived at the 2026 NFL Combine with one goal: to put the ""noise"" of a turbulent 2025 season behind them. Instead, head coach Nick Sirianni and GM Howie Roseman might have just turned the volume up. During their Tuesday press conference, both leaders notably refused to guarantee that star wide receiver A.J. Brown would be back in midnight green this season.When asked directly if Brown was a lock for the 2026 roster, Sirianni didn't give the ""non-starter"" answer fans were hoping for.Sirianni admitted.While he followed up by saying heBrown to stay and that he loves him as a player, the ""no guarantee"" phrase quickly became the headline heard ‘round Philly.This isn't just standard coach-speak, it’s a reflection of a rocky year. Brown was a lightning rod for drama in 2025, from sideline heated exchanges with Sirianni to openly criticizing the offensive scheme. While he still produced racking up over 1,000 yards and seven touchdowns, the frustration was visible.Howie Roseman, didn't do much to quiet the trade rumors either. Roseman reiterated that ""it’s hard to find great players,"" but he also dropped a classic Howie-ism:He suggested that if a team offers a package the Eagles ""didn't anticipate,"" they’d be doing a disservice to the franchise not to consider it.Trading a superstar like Brown isn't as simple as swapping jerseys. If the Eagles move him before June 1, they would be hit with a massive $40 million dead cap charge. However, if a deal happens after June 1, that number drops significantly, making a mid-summer blockbuster much more plausible. With Brown set to earn a $29 million salary in 2026, the Eagles have to decide if the production outweighs the price tag and the potential for more locker-room tension.For now, the Eagles are saying they want Brown back, but they are also making it clear that they are ""always listening."" With a new offensive coordinator in Sean Mannion, the team hopes a fresh system will fix the chemistry issues between Brown and Jalen Hurts.But in Philadelphia, where the roster is always in flux, ""no guarantees"" usually means the moving trucks aren't far away. If a wide receiver-needy team comes calling with a first-round pick and more, A.J. Brown’s time in Philly could be nearing its end.","Philadelphia eagles head coach nick sirianni and gm howie roseman refused to guarantee a.j. Brown would be back this season.

Bradley Bozeman’s surprise retirement puts the Chargers’ protection plan under the spotlight

Mary Kay Cabot report on Malik Willis and Ty Simpson has Browns fans roasting the messenger and questioning Shedeur Sanders’ job security

An eight-year starter walking away in February is not how the Los Angeles Chargers drew up their offseason. Bradley Bozeman announced his retirement on Instagram on Monday, ending his career at 31 and creating a fresh hole in the middle of an offensive line that was already under review.In Cleveland, the conversation is not about who is leaving but who might be invited in. Mary Kay Cabot reported that the Browns are evaluating Green Bay Packers backup Malik Willis and draft prospect Ty Simpson as options to push Shedeur Sanders, and Browns fans lit up social media the second her story dropped.Bozeman delivered the news himself, telling followers he is “ready for my next chapter” and adding, “This game has given me so much, lessons, lifelong friendships, and memories my family will carry forever.”He leaves after eight seasons with the Baltimore Ravens, Carolina Panthers, and Chargers, having started at both guard and center since entering the league as a sixth-round pick in 2018. Los Angeles signed him in 2024 to help stabilize the interior and extended him in 2025, but his retirement clears roughly $6 million in cap space and reopens a critical spot in front of Justin Herbert just as free agency is about to heat up.The timing matters. Rashawn Slater missed all of 2025 with a torn patellar tendon, Joe Alt finished the year on injured reserve after ankle surgery, and the Chargers’ line was already the focus of every “what went wrong” breakdown after their wild-card exit.Now Jim Harbaugh and new offensive coordinator Mike McDaniel have to solve center before anything else. Tyler Linderbaum will be one of the most talked about names on the market if the Ravens let him get there, and pieces around the league are already connecting him to Los Angeles as an obvious fit. Whether the Chargers go big-game hunting or lean on a cheaper veteran, Bozeman’s decision forces them to show how serious they are about protecting their franchise quarterback.Cabot reported that the Browns have at least two external quarterbacks on their radar: Willis, who flashed as a backup in Green Bay, and Simpson, a projected first-rounder out of Alabama. On paper it looks like smart due diligence for a team that just went 5-12 and still has Deshaun Watson and Dillon Gabriel in the room. In reality, the fanbase went straight for the quote-tweet button.“Don't believe anything MKC says.. she has no clue,” one fan wrote. Another added, “Mary K is all rumors we don’t listen to her goofy ass.” A third summed up the mood with, “Stop this nonsense, Cleveland media doesn’t know shit about fuck.”That pushback lands on top of an already messy context. Sanders threw for 1,400 yards with seven touchdowns in eight starts, made a Pro Bowl on name value and late-season buzz, but also finished near the bottom of the league in most efficiency metrics on a team that collapsed to last place in the AFC North.New head coach Todd Monken has not exactly wrapped his quarterback in bubble wrap either. Asked about the 2026 starter, he told reporters it is “still to be determined” and has been consistent that every spot will be open to competition.If the Browns follow Cabot’s reporting and seriously chase Willis in free agency while holding a first-round ticket on Simpson, Sanders is not just fighting Twitter narratives. He is fighting a depth chart that could very quickly include a new veteran, a premium rookie, and a $230 million former franchise quarterback in Watson all trying to squeeze into the same huddle.","Bradley bozeman’s surprise retirement puts the chargers’ protection plan under the spotlight.

Is Aaron Rodgers returning to the Steelers? GM Omar Khan provides update on veteran QB,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/is-aaron-rodgers-returning-to-the-steelers-gm-omar-khan-provides-update-on-veteran-qb/articleshow/128761056.cms,"Image via Getty

What did the Steelers say about Aaron Rodgers’ future?

Could Aaron Rodgers join the Vikings for the 2026 season?

Aaron Rodgers’ future has once again become one of the biggest storylines of the NFL offseason. The veteran quarterback is currently a free agent after spending the 2025 season with the Pittsburgh Steelers, uncertainty remains over whether he will return, retire, or explore a new destination.Rodgers helped the Steelers win the AFC North and get to the playoffs, but they lost in the Wild Card round, which was a big disappointment. That result, along with changes in Pittsburgh’s coaching setup, sparked speculation that the four-time MVP could step away from football. However, recent comments from the Steelers’ front office suggest the door remains open for a reunion.Speaking at the 2026 NFL Scouting Combine, Steelers general manager Omar Khan made it clear that the team would welcome Rodgers back. Khan revealed that he has been in contact with the quarterback and expects clarity sooner than last year, when Rodgers’ decision stretched deep into the offseason.Khan said the organisation has communicated its interest in continuing the partnership, especially with Rodgers’ former Green Bay Packers head coach Mike McCarthy now part of the setup. While Rodgers is not currently under contract, the Steelers appear prepared to move forward with him if he chooses to return.Rodgers’ 2025 numbers showed he can still be productive. He threw 65.7 percent of his passes for 3,322 yards, with 24 touchdowns and seven interceptions. This helped Pittsburgh have a great regular-season record. But the loss in the playoffs showed how bad the offense was, which made the team realize that they need to look about the future at quarterback.Khan also said that Pittsburgh is still looking for its next franchise quarterback. The Steelers have a lot of draft picks and younger players like Will Howard on their roster, so Rodgers might be seen as a short-term fix instead of a long-term answer.While Pittsburgh remains the most logical landing spot, other teams are monitoring the situation. The Minnesota Vikings have been a possible destination, especially because young quarterback J.J. McCarthy hasn't been steady this season.Reports suggest Rodgers previously had interest in Minnesota, and the team could consider adding a veteran to compete for the starting role. The Vikings’ strong offensive weapons, including star receivers, make the roster an attractive option for a quarterback looking to contend.NFL insiders believe Minnesota may provide the biggest competition to Pittsburgh if Rodgers decides to continue playing. The decision could depend on how comfortable the Vikings are bringing in a high-profile veteran alongside a developing young quarterback.For now, the Steelers remain optimistic but patient. Rodgers’ choice will not only shape Pittsburgh’s offseason plans but could also influence the wider quarterback market across the league. As free agency approaches, clarity on the veteran’s future is expected sooner rather than later.","Aaron rodgers is currently a free agent after spending the 2025 season with the pittsburgh steelers.

Bennedict Mathurin and Jarace Walker are expected to take on bigger roles.What it means for the gameEmbiid’s status affects how this game is expected to play out.
