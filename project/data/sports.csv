WWE Friday Night SmackDown emanated from the SAP Center in San Jose, California this week. It was an exciting edition of the show that saw Ilja Dragunov return and immediately capture the WWE US title, an explosive tag team title match and mysterious backstage assault that led to an impromptu match between Drew McIntyre and Cody Rhodes that saw a vicious side of the American Nightmare in front of the audience.The show was opened by SmackDown GM Nick Aldis who announced that Drew McIntyre vs. Jacob Fatu will be to determine the No.1 contender for Cody Rhodes' Undisputed WWE title. Rhodes then came down to the ring and addressed his loss to Seth Rollins at WWE Crown Jewel while also speaking about The Vision betraying him. Rhodes then turned his attention to his next potential challenger setting the tone for the upcoming WWE Saturday Night's Main Event where he will defend the title.This was a tag team showdown with Charlotte Flair and Alexa Bliss defending the WWE Women's Tag Team titles against NXT stars, Zaria and Sol Ruca. The challengers posed a great challenge to the champions, and it looked like an evenly matched contest. However, Sol Ruca got distracted by Blake Monroe, who was at ringside. Flair took advantage to gain the upper hand and locked in the Figure 8 to make her tap out and retain the titles for her team.Sami Zayn, much like every week, hosted a US title Open Challenge for his championship which was answered by the returning Ilja Dragunov. Originally, The Miz came out to compete against Zayn, but Carmelo Hayes attacked him from behind at the entrance ramp. The Mad Dragon showed no signs of ring rust and brought the fight to Zayn with both men producing a stellar showdown that led the fans to erupt. In the final moments of the bout, Solo Sikoa appeared on the entrance ramp to distract Zayn. This gave Dragunov the chance to capitalize, knock down and finish Zayn with the H-bomb to win the WWE United States title. After the match, the duo, alongside Rey Fenix who came down, were attacked by the MFT, who were also confronted by The Wyatt Sicks.This was a tag team match between Alex Shelly & Chris Sabin against Angel and Berto. Both engaged in a classic tag showdown that had the fans on their feet. Following a stellar match that saw both teams go back and forth, the ending saw MCMG connect a spectacular double team move and score the pinfall to win the match.The original match between Drew McIntyre and Jacob Fatu did not take place, as Fatu was found attacked backstage. Cody Rhodes came out in his suit and immediately challenged McIntyre to a match. Both men engaged in a heated match that spilled all over the ringside area and saw Rhodes and McIntyre inflict major damage to each other. The match ended in disqualification when Rhodes hit McIntyre with the Undisputed WWE title. He was about to hit him with the Cross Rhodes on the announcer's desk before the officials came down to stop him.Also read: 'You are a stalker'- WWE superstar CM Punk does not mince words in addressing recent fan behavior

Why This Trade Could Work for Both Teams

Key Trade Implications

Theare reportedly exploring a blockbuster move that could redefine the franchise’s future. According to Fansided’s Matt Moore, the team may consider parting ways with long-time defensive anchor Draymond Green to acquire- a player with a massive $175 million contract and generational talent.After a quiet offseason, the Golden State Warriors ’ biggest addition has been veteran forward Al Horford, making them one of the oldest teams in NBA history. Despite that, the front office remains confident that Stephen Curry can still lead the franchise to another deep playoff run.The organization is reportedly waiting until midseason to determine whether this current roster can keep pace with the Western Conference elite. If they prove competitive, major trade talks could intensify before the deadline.“You fundamentally reshape your entire future instead of trying to sneak out one more title. It buys you time to reconfigure and extend your success and avoid a post-Steph rebuild,” Matt Moore said Monday. (H/t: Sporting News)Moore’s statement highlights what could be a defining moment for Golden State - choosing between loyalty to its core and building for the next era.Moore’s trade scenario involves the Golden State Warriors sending several key assets to Milwaukee in exchange for Giannis Antetokounmpo This trade would mean Golden State parting with a franchise icon and its young depth - a steep price even for a two-time MVP. However, pairing Giannis with Curry could immediately catapult the Golden State Warriors back into title contention.The addition of stretch big men like Quinten Post and Al Horford gives the Golden State Warriors more spacing than in previous seasons, allowing Giannis to dominate inside without clogging the floor. His explosive playstyle could perfectly complement Curry’s perimeter shooting, creating one of the most dynamic duos in NBA history.For Milwaukee, the move represents a potential reset. The Bucks have struggled recently despite Giannis’s brilliance, and a package featuring young talents like Moody and Podziemski, along with multiple first-round picks, offers a clear path toward rebuilding.• For the Warriors: A chance to extend their championship window beyond the Curry era• For the Bucks: Long-term assets and flexibility to reshape their roster• For Draymond Green: The possible end of a legendary run with Golden StateTrading Draymond Green - a four-time champion and defensive cornerstone - would be one of the toughest decisions in franchise history. Yet as Moore points out, “You can’t justify moving one of your franchise icons for almost any player. Giannis is not just any player.”Should the trade be completed, it would both end an era and start a new one centered on Giannis Antetokounmpo and Stephen Curry. Additionally, it would be remembered as one of the most significant moves in NBA history.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Golden State Warriors Could Limit $8.6 Million Star’s Minutes as Veteran Core Takes Priority in New Season The Golden State Warriors’ front office faces a defining test this season: stay loyal to a proven core or risk it all for a once-in-a-generation superstar.

San Francisco 49ers’ George Kittle set for Week 7 comeback after Hamstring injury

What George Kittle’s comeback means for 49ers

George Kittle excited to return from hamstring injury for 49ers-Falcons game | NBC Sports Bay Area

The San Francisco 49ers sit at 4-2, but they’ve been without star tight end George Kittle since Week 1. The Pro Bowler tore his right hamstring against the Seattle Seahawks and has missed five games. Recent updates, including medical clearance for practice, signal that Kittle could return soon, bringing hope for a much-needed boost to the 49ers’ offense.Harvard-trained sports surgeon Dr. Deepak Chona recently provided an encouraging update on George Kittle’s recovery, stating that both Kittle and Tampa Bay Buccaneers receiver Mike Evans are likely to return to pre-injury form within one to two weeks. However, Chona also warned that Kittle faces a “high re-injury risk given age and history,” which is a concern considering his previous injuries.Kittle’s injury occurred after 22 snaps in Week 1, with just over ten minutes left in the second quarter. He was immediately placed on injured reserve, forcing him to miss five straight games — his longest absence since 2020, when he missed eight games due to knee and foot injuries. According to NFL rules, players placed on injured reserve must miss a minimum of four games, which made Kittle eligible to return in Week 6.However, the 49ers opted to give him extra recovery time.This week, Kittle was cleared for a 21-day practice window, signaling his possible return against the Atlanta Falcons in Week 7. He participated in limited practice sessions on Wednesday and Thursday, showing promising progress. Speaking to reporters, Kittle sounded eager to rejoin the team: “I fully plan on playing on Sunday. As long as Kyle lets me. It’s up to him. But hopefully I’m out there.” Head coach Kyle Shanahan echoed that optimism, confirming that Kittle’s return is “the hope. ”Kittle’s comeback brings both excitement and tough decisions for the 49ers. His return energizes the locker room, with quarterback Mac Jones praising his leadership and infectious energy. However, it also forces San Francisco to reevaluate its offensive lineup, especially with ongoing injuries to key players like Fred Warner, Marquez Valdes-Scantling, and Ricky Pearsall.Kittle’s impending return presents a crucial decision for the 49ers — whether to accelerate his comeback to reignite their offense or adopt a cautious approach to prevent another setback. Either way, his presence could be the key to restoring balance and momentum as San Francisco enters the heart of the season.Also Read: CeeDee Lamb injury update: Cowboys’ Star WR on track for Week 7 against Washington Commanders","The san francisco 49ers have been without star tight end george kittle since week 1.

Milwaukee Brewers 'Karen' Fired By Employer After 'Racist' Rant Against LA Dodgers Fan Goes Viral

Exploring Shannon Kobylarczyk's controversy



Did Shannon Kobylarczyk lose her job?



What did MLB say about the Shannon Kobylarczyk controversy?



The Milwaukee Brewers’ National League Championship Series clash with the Los Angeles Dodgers took a sharp turn off the field when a video from Game 2 went viral for all the wrong reasons. A heated exchange between Brewers fan Shannon Kobylarczyk and Dodgers supporter Ricardo Fosado turned into a national talking point after Kobylarczyk was seen making a racially charged remark. Within days, she lost her job, resigned from a charitable board, and was banned from American Family Field.Shannon Kobylarczyk, a Milwaukee-based attorney, worked at ManpowerGroup, a global staffing firm, and also served on the Make-A-Wish Wisconsin board of directors. Until last week, she was largely unknown outside professional circles. That changed during Game 2 of the NLCS on October 14, when she became the center of an online firestorm.The game, played in Milwaukee, had started as a typical postseason battle — the Brewers took an early lead before the Dodgers surged ahead. Amid the excitement, Fosado, a Los Angeles fan and U.S. Navy veteran, began recording the crowd’s reaction after a Dodgers home run.In his clip, Kobylarczyk can be heard mocking him, yelling, “Real men drink beer, p***y!” Moments later, she tapped another fan and said, “You know what, let’s call ICE. ”Fosado, calm but defiant, replied, “Call ICE. Call ICE. I’m a U.S. citizen, war veteran, baby girl. War veteran, two wars. ICE is not gonna do nothing to me. Good luck.”The exchange escalated, leading to Fosado’s removal from the stadium after Kobylarczyk reported him to security. However, the story didn’t end there, it was only beginning.The viral video, viewed more than 2 million times, quickly drew outrage online. Many criticized Kobylarczyk for using an anti-immigrant remark, especially toward a Latino veteran. The Brewers soon confirmed that both fans were banned from American Family Field due to “offensive statements” and “physical confrontation.”In a statement, the team said, “The Brewers expect all persons attending games to be respectful of each other, and we do not condone in any way offensive statements fans make to each other about race, gender, or national origin.” They emphasized their commitment to maintaining a “safe and enjoyable experience” for all fans.The fallout was swift. ManpowerGroup announced that Kobylarczyk had been placed on leave and later terminated. “As soon as we became aware of this video the individual was placed on immediate leave and we began an investigation,” the company said. “As a result of this process, the employee is no longer with the organization. We remain committed to maintaining a culture grounded in respect, integrity, and accountability. ”She also resigned from Make-A-Wish Wisconsin’s board. The nonprofit confirmed, “Shannon Kobylarczyk resigned from our board of directors this afternoon effective immediately. Make-A-Wish Wisconsin does not condone nor agree with Kobylarczyk’s words and actions.”Major League Baseball and the Brewers shared that such behavior violates league standards. The Milwaukee Police Department also became involved, citing Fosado for disorderly conduct and intoxication, though he wasn’t charged. Both fans, the Brewers said, are barred “from returning to the ballpark for future events.”Interestingly, Fosado himself showed grace toward Kobylarczyk despite the confrontation. Speaking to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, he said, “I don’t think it was like horrible or something that should get her fired. I feel bad for her. We cannot be judged on one mistake, and a lot of emotions were involved.”For Fosado, the night ended on a surprisingly positive note. “This is my first time at a Brewers game and I got kicked out, but you know what? I had a great experience and everybody was really friendly and welcoming,” he said.The viral moment dubbed Kobylarczyk “Brewers Karen” online.Also Read: Brewers 'Karen' fired after viral video identifies her as Shannon Kobylarczyk in racist rant at Dodgers supporter and U.S. war veteran","Shannon kobylarczyk, a milwaukee-based attorney, worked at manpowergroup, a global staffing firm.

Despite missing 37 games in his rookie season due to injury, the teenage phenom dazzled with 48 points in 45 games, immediately proving he could exceed the immense hype.In 2016–17, McDavid led the NHL with 100 points, capturing both the Hart Trophy as MVP and the Ted Lindsay Award, while guiding Edmonton to its first playoff berth in a decade. He has since become the League’s most dominant offensive force, earning multiple Art Ross, Lindsay, and Hart trophies.In 2024, he broke Wayne Gretzky’s record for most assists in a single postseason and earned the Conn Smythe Trophy despite Edmonton’s Finals loss.

At the post-win conference, a reporter asked Cincinnati Bengals' newest quarterback Joe Flacco, “When you look at this 11-day stretch one day down the road, what lesson do you hope it teaches your kids?” His reply included valuable lessons for his four children—“Take on some challenges” and “You can’t worry about the outcome. ” That’s what he did with himself. After being traded from the Cleveland Browns 11 days ago, he took up every challenge he faced as a football player, as a competitor, and gave his 100% and look where he’s at now—from a 39.3 passer rating against the Detroit Lions as a Cleveland Brown to a 108.6 passer rating against the Pittsburgh Steelers as a Cincinnati Bengal. Listening to his answer, one fan wrote, “Leading on and off the field that’s real legacy stuff from Flacco ❤️👏.”The NFL ’s official X account shared the veteran quarterback’s video interview with a perfect caption: “.@JoeFlacco on being an example for his children ❤️.”When you look at this 11-day stretch one day down the road, what less do you hope it teaches your kids?Well, I think one of the biggest things is that hopefully they’ll be willing to take on challenges, you know, cause I think it would have been easy to maybe say—Naah, I don’t wanna do that like you want me to play this week, you know, I don’t know.I think that’s one thing—to take on some challenges and you can’t worry about the outcome, you know. I see myself as a competitor, I see myself as a football player—that’s what I do. That the challenge? Okay, fine, let me take it on. I see myself as a football player first. No hesitation. Let’s go do this.One hearing Flacco’s advice for his four children, one fan wrote, “He better be a first ballot hall of famer once he's done and hall of Fame for Father's too.” Another praised the signal-caller, saying, “Love this wisdom from Joe. Can apply it to any part of life.” A third fan found Flacco happy like never before: “I loved his interview after the game with the Prime crew! He was so happy. Don't remember the last time he was so effusive. Great job @JoeFlacco 🧡🖤 #WhoDey.” A fourth fan chimed in, “This is a great interview. Listened to the whole thing.

Falcons’ wide receiver Ray-Ray McCloud’s sudden absence raises eyebrows

Insider claims McCloud’s benching may be tied to Ike Hilliard firing and locker room tension

“words were likely exchanged that probably shouldn’t have been said,”

What McCloud’s absence could mean for his Falcons future

Just when Atlanta Falcons fans thought they’d seen all the drama this season, wide receiver Ray-Ray McCloud has been sent home, and nobody knows when or if he’ll return. Head coach Raheem Morris confirmed Friday that McCloud’s absence is excused, calling it a “private matter”, leaving fans speculating about what’s really going on behind the scenes.McCloud’s departure from team activities comes amid a season of ups and downs. The 27-year-old was a healthy scratch in Week 6 against the Buffalo Bills, hinting at a reduced role in the Falcons’ offense compared to his career-best 2024 performance.HC Raheem Morris emphasized that the situation is unrelated to recent coaching changes, including the firing of former wide receivers coach Ike Hilliard. Still, the timing has sparked questions about McCloud’s role on the roster and whether the Falcons are prepared for his absence on special teams and in the passing game.The insider, who has previously leaked accurate Falcons information, claims McCloud’s recent benching could be linked to the firing of former wide receivers coach Ike Hilliard. Apparently, McCloud had a disagreement with Morris following the coaching shake-up, andwhich may have led to a disciplinary benching.Fans have already noticed McCloud looking less than thrilled celebrating in the locker room while his teammates cheered, adding fuel to the speculation that internal tension is at play.If true, this insider intel adds a new layer of drama to McCloud’s season.Analysts have also weighed in, noting that McCloud’s versatility as a slot receiver and special teams ace makes him a valuable asset, and missing him even temporarily could impact Atlanta’s short-term game plan.McCloud’s situation remains a mystery, and the lack of a clear return timeline keeps the speculation machine running. After a strong 2024 season, where he contributed significantly in both receiving and return duties, his future with the team is now uncertain.Between the private matter, insider claims about locker room tension, and the speculation surrounding his benching, McCloud’s absence has become one of the NFL ’s juiciest off-field stories. Fans, analysts, and teammates will be watching closely to see when or if he returns to the Falcons lineup.Also read - “They can’t do sh*t”: Bill Belichick and Jordon Hudson caught trash talking in a leaked hot-mic","Atlanta falcons wide receiver ray-ray mccloud has been sent home, and nobody knows when or if he’ll return.

Larry Williams’ faith, football legacy, and lasting impact across college athletics



Sports world reacts to the sudden death of Larry Williams

Larry Williams, a former NFL offensive lineman and athletic director at the University of San Francisco, died on Thursday morning during a workout on campus. He was 62.According to university president Salvador D. Aceves, Williams collapsed while exercising at the War Memorial Gym. “Our prayers go out to Larry’s wife, Laura, their children, Kristin, Sean, Scott, Eric, and Louis, their families, and his grandchildren,” Aceves said in a letter to the university community. “My thoughts and prayers also go to the university’s 250 student-athletes and all of the coaches and staff under Larry’s skillful watch.”Williams had been the school’s athletic director since 2022. No official cause of death has been released, though local reports cited a possible heart-related incident.Before becoming an administrator, Larry Williams built a strong football career rooted in faith and discipline. A California native, Williams was a two-time All-American at Notre Dame before being drafted by the Cleveland Browns in the 10th round of the 1985 NFL Draft. He went on to play 61 games with 44 starts over seven seasons, spending time with the Browns, New Orleans Saints, and New England Patriots.While playing professionally, he earned a law degree from the University of San Diego, later practicing law in Indianapolis before shifting toward leadership in college athletics.Williams became the athletic director at the University of Portland in 2004, then at Marquette University, followed by the University of Akron, and finally the University of San Francisco in 2022.When hired by USF, Williams said the role aligned perfectly with his beliefs. “USF represents to me the almost perfect combination of things I cherish,” he explained. “No. 1, it’s the Catholic identity. No. 2, it’s the deep educational mission. And No. 3, it’s athletic participation in an environment that very specifically includes 1 and 2. At this point in my career, there’s almost a vocational element to what I do here at USF. ”Tributes poured in across college and professional football. Notre Dame Football posted, “We are deeply saddened by the passing of Larry Williams. We send our condolences to his family and friends.”Marquette University described him as a “strong, committed leader whose passion for the holistic development of student-athletes left a lasting mark on collegiate athletics.”Journalist Pete Thamel called the news “crushing,” adding, “Larry was smart, engaging, and fun to talk with because he thought outside the box. He had great perspective as a former star player in college and the NFL.”Williams is survived by his wife, Laura, five children, and several grandchildren. Stephanie Shrieve-Hawkins has been appointed interim athletic director at USF.","Former nfl player and university of san francisco athletic director larry williams died suddenly during a morning workout.

Where to Watch the Los Angeles Lakers vs Golden State Warriors Game Tonight (October 17, 2025)?

Theandwill meet for their final preseason matchup on October 17, 2025, at Chase Center - but both teams are entering this contest short-handed. With the regular season just days away, this game is more about rhythm and readiness than rivalry. Coaches Steve Kerr and Tyronn Lue are both prioritizing player health and rotation balance over final scores. Golden State Warriors ’ depth will once again be put to the test as they close out the preseason. Jimmy Butler, the team’s marquee midseason acquisition from last year, headlines the injury list after suffering an ankle injury during practice earlier this week. He’s been listed as doubtful for the matchup, though an MRI revealed no structural damage. The Golden State Warriors expect Butler to be ready for their regular-season opener against the Los Angeles Lakers on October 21.Before the setback, Butler averaged 10.5 points, 3 rebounds, and 2.5 assists while shooting 60% from the field in two preseason games. Kerr emphasized that there’s no rush to bring him back, noting Butler’s excellent conditioning and confirming that he’ll resume ramp-up workouts over the weekend.The Golden State Warriors will also be without Moses Moody, who continues to recover from a calf strain suffered earlier in the month. He hasn’t appeared since early October but should be available for opening night. Draymond Green is expected to rest, while Seth Curry remains listed as day-to-day for non-injury reasons.With several veterans sidelined, Golden State will rely on its younger players. Jonathan Kuminga, Brandin Podziemski, and rookie Alex Toohey - who missed the last game for rest - are expected to see expanded roles tonight.The Los Angeles Clippers , meanwhile, are managing their own absences. Head coach Tyronn Lue has confirmed that Kawhi Leonard and James Harden will not play, purely as a rest precaution before the regular season. Both stars have performed well in preseason action, and Lue’s decision is centered on preserving their fitness and avoiding unnecessary risk.Bradley Beal continues to sit out with knee soreness, while Bogdan Bogdanovic remains unavailable due to lower back tightness. These absences will open the door for young and fringe players to step up, including Amir Coffey and John Collins. Collins, a recent addition to the roster, has filled in admirably for Ivica Zubac in recent games.When healthy, the Los Angeles Clippers have looked sharp. Kawhi Leonard, in particular, impressed earlier this week with 17 points in the first half against the Denver Nuggets. Still, Coach Lue is keeping his focus on conditioning and chemistry rather than results.With several top names out, tonight’s game is expected to be a proving ground for bench players and young talent. For Golden State, the emphasis will be on assessing how Kuminga and Podziemski handle expanded offensive responsibilities and lead the second unit. The Los Angeles Clippers will likely turn to Zubac, Norman Powell, and Terance Mann to anchor their rotation and provide veteran stability.Fans shouldn’t expect a playoff-caliber showdown - instead, this will be a strategic tune-up for both sides, allowing coaching staffs to finalize rotations and ensure readiness for the 2025–26 regular season. The real victory for both teams will be emerging from this game healthy and prepared for opening night.With Jimmy Butler and Kawhi Leonard both sidelined, the spotlight shifts to the supporting casts. This preseason finale serves as a platform for role players and hopefuls to make one last statement before the real competition begins next week.The Los Angeles Clippers vs. Golden State Warriors preseason game on October 17, 2025, tips off at 10:00 p.m. EST (7:30 a.m. IST on October 18) at Chase Center. Fans in the San Francisco Bay Area can watch the broadcast on NBC Sports Bay Area, while viewers in Los Angeles can tune in via NBC Sports California.Also read: Is Stephen Curry playing tonight against the Los Angeles Clippers?

NEW DELHI: BCCI chief selector Ajit Agarkar has responded to Mohammed Shami 's recent criticism over being left out of India’s white-ball tour of Australia. Agarkar addressed Shami’s comments regarding his fitness and availability for Bengal in Ranji Trophy matches.Shami, who last represented India in the Champions Trophy and was the country’s joint highest wicket-taker alongside Varun Chakravarthy, has been managing ankle and knee injuries that required surgery following the 2023 World Cup.The fast bowler had voiced his displeasure over the selection snub, stating that his participation in the Ranji Trophy proved his fitness and that it wasn’t his responsibility to update the selection committee.Responding to Shami’s remarks, Agarkar said: “If he says that to me, I will probably answer that. I mean if he was here, I would probably do that. I am not quite sure what he said on social media. Maybe if I read that, I might give him a call but my phone is always on for most players. I have had multiple chats with him over the last few months, but I don't want to try and give you a headline here.”Agarkar further elaborated: “He has been an incredible performer for India.If he said something, maybe that is a conversation for me to have with him or him to have with me. But even before England, we said if he was fit, he would have been on that plane. Unfortunately, he wasn't. Our domestic season has just started so we will see if he is fit enough and we will see where it goes. This is the first round of Ranji games that is going on. We will find out in a couple of more games. If he is bowling well, why would you not want to have someone like a Shami. But what we have found in the last six-eight months to a year, even during the Australia tour, we were desperate to have him on, but unfortunately his fitness wasn't there. If he does stay fit over the next few months, the story might be different. But at this point, as far as I know, he wasn't fit enough for that England tour.”India’s upcoming tour of Australia, beginning October 19, features three ODIs and a five-match T20I series. The tour will also mark the return of Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli to international cricket, their first appearance since the 2025 Champions Trophy final in March.","Ajit agarkar has responded to mohammed shami's criticism over being left out of india’s white-ball tour of australia.
