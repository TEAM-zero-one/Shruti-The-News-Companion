A'ja Wilson and Angel Reese join Stephen Curry's animated film GOAT

Impact on women's sports and media representation



When the lights go up in theaters on February 13, 2026, the silver screen will showcase a level of star power that fans of both the NBA and WNBA have been dreaming of. Stephen Curry’s highly anticipated animated feature, GOAT, has officially added two of the biggest names in women's basketball to its cast: Angel Reese and A’ja Wilson. Joining a lineup that already features Hollywood heavyweights like Gabrielle Union and David Harbour, the addition of these hoopers marks a massive cultural bridge between professional basketball and mainstream entertainment.Produced by a living legend, Stephen Curry, the film centers on an underdog story. A little goat, Will, dreams of playing roarball, a high-intensity sport, but his physical limitations obstruct him. It will follow his journey from being looked down upon to overcoming all barriers and rewriting the rules. Sounds familiar? Do you feel Curry’s story could be reflected through Will?For any dedicated WNBA watcher, the pairing of Reese and Wilson is a game recognize game moment. Both Wilson and Reese are coming off a historic 2025 season where one former won her 4th WNBA MVP award, 2nd Finals MVP, 3rd DPOY, and led the Aces to their 3rd championships in the last 4 years. These accolades don’t finish just here. Wilson is an elite offensive and defensive powerhouse. She also led the 2025 season as the highest point scorer with 2025. Now set to play a reptile named Kouyate, in Curry’s GOAT money, the fans can’t wait to see how the MVP plays out her role on the big screen.Angel Reese, on the other hand, has been writing, redefining what WNBA stardom is. She set the league record in rebounds with 12.6 in 2025, and is leveraging her online presence to slowly build her own brand empire. Barely two years into her career, and she’s already headlining games and fashion shows. In the movie, fans will see her voicing a polar bear named Propp.The genius of this casting lies in its authenticity. By having actual champions and record-breakers voice these characters, Curry’s Unanimous Media is leaning into the specific it factor that has driven WNBA viewership to record highs over the last year. Both Wilson and Reese made an impact on women’s sports beyond the hardwood.The release of GOAT represents a pivotal shift in how women's sports stars are marketed to the next generation. Traditionally, WNBA players were relegated to the sidelines of sports media, but this film places them at the center of a major Sony Pictures Animation production alongside the greatest shooter in NBA history.This visibility is a power move for the WNBA's brand. By appearing in a family-friendly animated film, Reese and Wilson are being introduced to Gen Alpha and younger fans who may not yet be regular league pass subscribers. It’s a flywheel effect: movie stardom breeds cultural relevance, which in turn drives jersey sales and ticket stubs. As the WNBA prepares for further expansion into markets like Portland and Toronto in 2026, having its biggest stars become household names through cinema is the ultimate fast-break toward long-term growth.Also read: The top 5 most expensive contracts in WNBA right now: Kelsey Mitchell, Jackie Young, and more",A'ja wilson and angel reese join stephen curry's animated film goat.

NHL Trade Rumors: What’s really going on with Dougie Hamilton and New Jersey Devils?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/nhl-trade-rumors-whats-really-going-on-with-dougie-hamilton-and-new-jersey-devils/articleshow/126533005.cms,"Dougie Hamilton (Image Via Twitter)

Why are teams still monitoring a potential Dougie Hamilton trade?



CHAOS: Why Are Devils ABANDONING Dougie Hamilton—Is San Jose Next in SHOCK TRADE?

Once again, the New Jersey Devils are involved in trade rumors, and Dougie Hamilton’s name is one of the most mentioned in this regard, as teams are still looking for opportunities to upgrade their defense through the back line. Moving their star defenseman has become a subject of debate among both fans and insiders, but the initial signs point out that more of a watch-and-wait situation rather than a deal about to be done is at stake here.TSN’s Pierre LeBrun reports that there is no signal at present that a Dougie Hamilton trade is on the cards. Notwithstanding, the situation still stays dynamic, mainly due to Hamilton's contract situation, which has two more years to run and comes with a huge $9 million cap hit.Josh Wegman from The Score reported that a little while ago, Sportsnet's Elliotte Friedman made it known that Hamilton was not keen on moving to the San Jose Sharks. Recently, San Jose has turned out to be a surprise playoff contender, and the possibility that Hamilton might change his mind if the interest is revived has been talked about among the league watchers. Wegman additionally mentioned the Nashville Predators and a possible return to the Calgary Flames, but those both seem unlikely because of the team’s direction and contract issues.James Murphy from RG.Org gave extra insight that the Utah Mammoth were also interested last summer and could reacquaint through talks. At the same time, the Detroit Red Wings, Toronto Maple Leafs, and Vegas Golden Knights keep a close watch on the situation. Detroit and Utah are the two that get attention, as both have over $26 million in cap space, in addition to good draft and prospect assets.Cap limitations complicate the situation for Toronto and Vegas unless they are willing to move or take on some salary. Terry Koshan of the Toronto Sun and Kevin McGran of the Toronto Star both reported that Leafs GM Brad Treliving is still on the hunt for defense upgrades, with contract decisions within the organization possibly influencing the team’s trade flexibility as the March 6 deadline approaches.At this point, Dougie Hamilton is still a Devil, but the interest from other teams in the league has not diminished. It's tough to see this plot as over with the mix of salary cap difficulties, timing, and team direction.Also Read: NHL Trade Rumors: Ottawa Senators linked to Rasmus Andersson while Vancouver Canucks and Edmonton Oilers explore changes","The new jersey devils are involved in trade rumors, and dougie hamilton’s name is one of the most mentioned in this regard.

Who Benefits Most

The Los Angeles Dodgers are being widely viewed as the most serious destination for free agent infielder Bo Bichette. Around the league, few teams appear willing or able to meet his reported $240-300 million asking range. As a result, Los Angeles has separated itself as the only club clearly positioned to make a deal work.The plan, as currently discussed, would involve moving Bo Bichette to second base. That alignment keeps Mookie Betts flexible while addressing a position that quietly became a problem for the Los Angeles Dodgers last season. The fit is more about lineup balance than star power, even though the name value is undeniable.The expected framework is an eight-year deal worth between $240 million and $300 million. Annual value would likely land in the $25-30 million range, with a front-loaded structure and a player opt-out after the fourth season. This allows Los Angeles to limit long-term risk while still making a strong commitment.For Toronto, the situation resolves cleanly through free agency. There are no trade discussions involved.The Toronto Blue Jays avoid the risk of a rejected qualifying offer and would receive compensatory draft picks. Los Angeles, already projected near a $288 million payroll for 2026, can absorb the contract without changing its overall approach, similar to how it handled the Shohei Ohtani deal.Second base production was a clear weakness last season. Los Angeles Dodgers hitters at the position combined for a .649 OPS, ranking near the bottom of the league. Bichette’s career .294 batting average offers steady contact from the right side and helps balance a lineup built around Freddie Freeman and Ohtani.From Bo Bichette’s side, the move shifts him away from a roster entering a transition phase and into a team built to contend every year. Toronto gains payroll flexibility and can redirect resources toward younger players, while also moving on from a defender whose glove has graded below average in recent seasons.Bichette is 27 years old, born March 5, 1998. He is a two-time American League hits leader and a Silver Slugger winner, even as injuries and defensive decline have complicated his recent seasons.Los Angeles adds a reliable bat at a position of need and keeps its competitive window wide open through the end of the decade. The risks are real, health, defense, and blocked prospects like Freeland, but manageable given the roster depth.Also read: MLB Trade Rumors: Los Angeles Dodgers emerge as lone Big-Money Suitor for $300 million AL hits leader prior free agency Bichette secures a long-term deal and consistent postseason exposure.

Charlotte Hornets set to retire Dell Curry’s jersey



Dell Curry’s impact extends beyond the court and into the community



The former Charlotte Hornets sharpshooter Dell Curry recently received a heartfelt accolade. The franchise informed him that No. 30 will be retired on March 19 during a home game against the Orlando Magic. Dell, who is the father of Stephen and Seth Curry, had a remarkable career in the league with astonishing stats.Curry’s career was crucial in shaping the early identity of the Hornets. Also, his connection to the city never faded after retirement. The honor places him among the most enduring figures the organization has known.Dell Curry played 10 of his 16 NBA seasons in Charlotte after arriving through the 1988 expansion draft. Over that span, he became one of the league’s most reliable perimeter threats and a steady presence for a young franchise. He retired as Charlotte’s all-time leader in points and three-point field goals made, marks that stood for years. He still ranks near the top in games played, scoring, and shooting efficiency.“I never imagined it would happen,” Curry said. “It means so much to me. I do it because it’s what I love to do.The game gave me so much, the fans gave me so much and I want to stay involved just to give back what I can and make this organization what it should be and give the fans, the team and the broadcast and the show that it’s fun, we’re having a great time and come celebrate, come support. ... Man, it would be an injustice to try to put into words what this means. ”Hornets' leadership also shared their thoughts on the decision. “Dell Curry has been a cornerstone of the Charlotte Hornets for more than 25 years, both on and off the court,” Rick Schnall and Gabe Plotkin said.“He exemplifies what it means to be a Hornet through his professionalism, work ethic and commitment to excellence. Dell’s impact on our organization, our fans and our community is undeniable, and he is truly deserving of this honor.”Curry’s bond with Charlotte did not end when his playing days did. He has spent 17 seasons as the team’s television analyst, bringing familiarity and trust to broadcasts while staying connected to fans. Combined with his playing career, his time with the organization spans more than two decades.The city also watched his family grow. Stephen and Seth Curry developed their games in Charlotte gyms, while the community followed their paths through college and into the NBA. That shared history deepened the connection. “I still love the game. I love the fans. I love their interaction, not only in the arena, but when I go out to the community, I’m one of them. And they treat me as such, my whole family as such,” Curry said.When No. 30 rises to the rafters, it will honor Dell’s contribution to the franchise while celebrating his love for the city.Also Read: “Everything else doesn’t matter”: LeBron James sent a heartfelt message to fans supporting him throughout his 23-year career",Charlotte hornets set to retire dell curry’s jersey on march 19.

Montreal Canadiens sign former St. Louis forward Alexandre Texier to a multi-year contract deal

Also read:

In an attempt to bolster the Montreal Canadiens’ strength, the club has recently signed forward Alexandre Texier to a two-year, $5million contract extension on Wednesday. Starting next season, Texier will have a $2.5 million average annual value (AAV) with the Habs. This multi-year contract extension is not very surprising, as he has made commendable progress in his career in a brief period of time after being associated with the Canadiens.According to reports, the 26-year-old started the season with the St. Louis Blues, but after a slow start, the team terminated his contract, making him a free agent. Texier signed a one-year, $1 million deal with the Canadiens in November. Since signing with the Canadiens after mutually terminating his contract with the St. Louis Blues in November, the 26-year-old forward has proven to be an excellent fit in Montreal.In 25 games since signing with the Canadiens, Texier has recorded seven goals, nine assists, 16 points, and a plus-7 rating, proving that he would be a great fit for the team. Let’s take a look at his trade deal with the Canadiens more closely.The Montreal Canadiens club has signed former St. Louis forward Alexandre Texier to a multi-year contract deal on Wednesday. The forward has agreed to a two-year contract extension that carries an average annual value of $2.5 million, Texier’s agent announced. Posting the same on X/Twitter, Dan Milstein wrote, “Congratulations to our client Alexandre Texier on signing 2-year $2.5mm AAV contract extension with the Montréal #GoHabsGo Canadiens. #WeAreGoldStar!”It is to be noted that Texier joined the Canadiens on a one-year, $1-million deal on Nov.23 after the St. Louis Blues terminated his contract. Reports suggest that he has already become an important addition to the team, as after being placed at the right wing of the Canadiens’ top line with Nick Suzuki and Cole Caufield, Texier has produced four goals and six assists in eight games.The 26-year-old from France has impressed in Montreal with seven goals and nine assists through 25 games, after registering just one assist in eight outings with the Blues. Besides, he also scored a hat trick in Montreal's 6-2 win over the Florida Panthers on Jan. 8.The six-foot-one, 196-pound Canadiens forward has appeared in 265 career NHL regular-season games, recording 47 goals and 60 assists.

Dillon Brooks is just a step away from reaching a century in technical fouls. This season, he has stepped almost 40 times on the court, and nearly had at least one technical foul call every three games. He picked up his league-leading 14th tech call on Tuesday in Miami against the Heat while being on offense. Yes, he had the ball advantage, and any contact while going for the rim would have resulted in free throws in favour of Suns.But Brooks and tech fouls go hand in hand, and after losing the possession against Heat’s Norman Powell’s defense, the duo appeared heated, leading to the referees calling a tech on Brooks.This season, Suns’ Brooks lead NBA in tech calls, followed by Warriors' defensive cornerstone, Draymond Green, with 9, and then Lakers’ superstar Luka Doncic is tied with Green with 9, and following him is Suns’ another entry, Devin Booker, with 6 tech calls.Brooks’s aggressive and unbending playing style and ability to get under people's skin have often put him in the limelight on court. In his rookie year, he had five techincals, and since the 2020-21 season, he kept it above 10. For the 2025-26 season, he already has 14 technicals, two more, and he’ll be facing a one-game suspension.After picking up his 14th tech foul in yesterday’s game against the Miami Heat, Brooks needs to tread carefully and should avoid any more whistles.But fans are not avoiding any chance to react to Brooks’ technical saga. One fan commented, “Brooks running away with MVP (Most Violations Player) race.” A second fan wrote, “Brooks wants to technical foul is way back to the Rockets.” while the third fan said, “Brooks just got max passion and a good rage baiter. ”A fan tagged Green’s official account and wrote, “are you gonna let dillon brooks of all people steal your flow?” Well, if not for Brooks, Green would have been leading the list.Another fan commented, “And yall said draymond was terrible lol. Don’t pay attention to the noise warriors and draymond.” Some fans wrote how they had guessed all the names but the last one on the list was a surprise, “ Would guessed ¾. Booker not so much.""The Suns lost to Heat in a close contest of 121-127, all thanks to the latter’s 35 point stream in the 4th quarter. Bam Adebayo was Heat’s leading scorer with 29 points, followed by Norman Powell’s 27 points. Despite the tech call, Dillon Brooks came as Suns’ top scorer with 24 points and 4 rebounds and went 11-of-24 from the field.Also read: Shaquille O’Neal stirs up the goat conversation by crowning Michael Jordan and putting Kobe Bryant over LeBron James","Dillon brooks leads the nba in technical fouls this season with 14, inching closer to a suspension.

Despite the fouls, brooks remains a key scorer for the suns, who narrowly lost to the heat.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126530874,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-44752,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

Mike Tomlin’s hilarious mic’d-up moment with Broderick Jones goes viral following the end of his Steelers era,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/mike-tomlins-hilarious-micd-up-moment-with-broderick-jones-goes-viral-following-the-end-of-his-steelers-era/articleshow/126529579.cms,"Mike Tomlin (via Getty Images)

Why that unscripted moment now defines Tomlin’s legacy

As Mike Tomlin steps away from the Pittsburgh Steelers, one of his most memorable mic’d-up moments is going viral, and the timing couldn’t have been better. The clip captured Tomlin at his most authentic, reacting instantly when lineman Broderick Jones realized the cameras were still on. The coach had no inhibitions even when faced by reporters with cameras.As the tackle asked the coach whether he was mic’d up, Tomlin’s answer was equal parts blunt and equal parts hilarious, while the spectators were left giggling. That raw exchange has resurfaced just hours after Tomlin confirmed he is stepping down, closing the book on an undisputed and unparalleled 19-season run with the team.As Jones inquired about the mic to his coach. Tomlin had the most savage reply, saying, “Shut up, shut your *** up, let’s go”, much to the tackle’s embarrassment. The viral mic’d-up clip resonates now as it reflects how players experienced him daily. When Jones hesitated after noticing the camera, Tomlin’s response proved that he had no filter with or without the camera.Tomlin’s exit came one day after Pittsburgh’s latest playoff disappointment. Since taking over in 2007, Tomlin built a résumé few coaches can match. He never had a losing season, guided the Steelers to 13 playoff appearances, won eight division titles, and lifted a Super Bowl trophy.In a league where coaches rarely last five years, Tomlin became an anomaly and was what the team needed.In his statement announcing the decision to step down, Tomlin thanked the organization, players, and fans, calling his tenure an “extraordinary honor.” He also expressed his gratitude for having the privilege to lead the team successfully for many years and also added that he is now looking forward to the team’s future prospects.Now, Pittsburgh faces a rare moment of uncertainty, as the franchise has had only three head coaches since 1969, and choosing the next one will shape its future for years. Tomlin leaves behind a legacy that will continue to be remembered for generations, and his successor will have a lot to live up to.Also read: What comes next for Mike Tomlin following Steelers’ latest postseason disappointment",Mike tomlin confirmed he is stepping down as head coach of the pittsburgh steelers.

Patrick Mahomes’ playoff TD record stands firm as Chiefs sit out this postseason,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/patrick-mahomes-playoff-td-record-stands-firm-as-chiefs-sit-out-this-postseason/articleshow/126529285.cms,"Image via Getty

A record untouched without even playing

Why this matters for Patrick Mahomes’ legacy

Also Read:

The 2025 NFL playoffs feel a little strange without the Patrick Mahomes-led Kansas City Chiefs. For the first time in more than a decade, the Chiefs are not part of the postseason picture. Yet, even while watching from the sidelines, Mahomes still managed to hold on to a major playoff milestone.Mahomes, who turned 30 this season, remains second on the NFL’s all-time list for playoff touchdown passes. That record stayed untouched during the Wild Card round, despite a rare opportunity for it to change.What makes this situation striking is that Mahomes did not need to take a single snap this postseason to protect his record. With the Chiefs missing the playoffs after a disappointing 2025 campaign, Mahomes could only watch as other quarterbacks attempted and failed to close the gap.Rodgers needed just two playoff touchdown passes to overtake Mahomes. Instead, his Wild Card outing ended scoreless through the air, with turnovers proving costly. As a result, Mahomes officially cannot drop below second place on the all-time playoff touchdown list this season.The only player still comfortably ahead is Tom Brady, whose playoff touchdown total remains the gold standard. Brady’s postseason résumé is nearly unmatched, but Mahomes’ pace has kept him firmly in the conversation, even with fewer playoff appearances.Because the Chiefs failed to qualify for the playoffs this year, Mahomes had no chance to add to his total. That also means he could not close the gap on Brady at the top. However, the silver lining for Kansas City fans is clear: Mahomes cannot lose his second-place spot, no matter how the rest of the playoffs unfold.The absence of the Chiefs from postseason football has been one of the biggest surprises of the 2025 season. Injuries, including Mahomes’ late-season ACL tear, and overall team struggles led to a disappointing 6-11 finish. It marked the end of a long playoff streak under head coach Andy Reid.Even so, Mahomes’ playoff resume continues to shine. His past postseason runs, filled with comeback wins and clutch performances, built a cushion that protected his standing this year.Watching an NFL postseason without Mahomes feels unusual. But it may not last long. If history is any guide, the Chiefs and their star quarterback will be back soon. And when Mahomes returns to the playoff stage, his slow but steady chase of Brady’s legendary record will continue.For now, one thing is certain: Patrick Mahomes’ playoff touchdown record remains safe even in a season he didn’t play.","Patrick mahomes is second on the nfl’s all-time list for playoff touchdown passes.

Washington Commanders quarterback Jayden Daniels is officially returning to the field, ending weeks of uncertainty around his injury status. The young QB is set to take part in Fanatics Flag Football Classic in Saudi Arabia, an announcement that also confirms he has recovered from the injuries that limited his 2025 NFL season.The update came directly from Tom Brady, who revealed Daniels as one of the team captains during the launch of Fanatics Studios. The event will be held in Riyadh in March and will feature several current and former NFL stars competing in an Olympic-style flag football format.Daniels played just seven games during the 2025 season before suffering a dislocated elbow in a heavy loss to the Minnesota Vikings in December. The injury effectively ended his year and raised concerns about how quickly he would be able to return to football activities.While the Commanders have stayed quiet about detailed medical updates, Daniels’ inclusion in the Saudi Arabia event is a strong sign that his recovery has gone well. Participating as a team captain suggests he is not only healthy but also trusted to handle leadership responsibilities on the field.The Fanatics Flag Football Classic will feature three teams, each captained by an NFL quarterback. Brady will captain one team, Daniels another, with a third captain yet to be announced. Games will follow five-on-five Olympic-style flag football rules, played on a shorter field with two 20-minute halves.Several big NFL names are expected to take part, including Saquon Barkley, Christian McCaffrey, CeeDee Lamb, Myles Garrett and Rob Gronkowski. The games will be broadcast live on Fox Sports and Tubi, giving fans worldwide a chance to watch Daniels back in action.For Washington, Daniels’ return even in an exhibition setting is encouraging. The 2024 Offensive Rookie of the Year showed flashes of promise before injuries slowed him down. In his limited appearances last season, Daniels threw for over 1,200 yards with eight touchdowns, showing growth despite difficult circumstances.This event offers Daniels a low-risk way to regain rhythm and confidence before offseason programs begin. It also reassures fans that his elbow injury is no longer a major concern heading into the 2026 NFL season.Brady and Daniels are on stage together, offers Daniels worldwide exposure and boosts his confidence after a terrible year. The Commanders' season ended early, but their presence shows that Daniels is ready to go on.Right now, the focus is on opportunity instead of injury concerns.

He said, ""This organization has been a huge part of my life for many years, and it has been an absolute honor to lead this team.

Kevin Lankinen makes 38 saves, including a crucial goal-line stop, keeping Canucks in the game



Kevin Lankinen had a stellar performance with the Vancouver Canucks on Tuesday as he kept his team in the contest with a 2-1 loss to the Ottawa Senators at Canadian Tire Centre. The Canucks goalie made a number of important saves in the contest, among them a remarkable save at the goal line that demonstrated his quickness and positioning. Lankinen had recorded 38 saves, highlighting just how central he was to Vancouver’s defensive effort.The Senators were able to spend several periods with possession of the puck, trying to create opportunities against the Canucks, but Lankinen's composed performance as a goalkeeper made it even more difficult for the Senators to score a goal against Vancouver despite their best efforts on offense.The standout moment came in the second period, when Senators captain Brady Tkachuk fed a pass to Claude Giroux cutting to the crease. Giroux attempted to redirect the puck past Lankinen, but it ricocheted off the goalie’s leg. The puck slid behind him, and as Dylan Cozens moved in for a follow-up attempt, Lankinen showcased his agility and reach. Diving across the crease, he used his blocker to stop the puck just short of crossing the goal line. The sequence exemplified both his awareness and technical skill, keeping Vancouver alive in a tight contest.Despite Lankinen’s efforts, the Senators managed to edge out the Canucks by a single goal. Vancouver’s offense struggled to capitalize on rebounds and sustained pressure, leaving the team reliant on Lankinen to keep the score close. His 38-save night was one of the most impressive individual performances of the early season, demonstrating why he remains a key figure between the pipes.For the Canucks, Lankinen’s showing provides a clear takeaway: strong goaltending can keep the team competitive even in challenging matchups. While the loss adds pressure to Vancouver’s upcoming schedule, Lankinen’s performance offers reassurance that the team has a reliable last line of defense. Ottawa, meanwhile, gained a narrow but critical win, advancing their push in the standings while highlighting the importance of converting chances in tight games.","Kevin lankinen makes 38 saves, including a crucial goal-line stop, keeping canucks in the game against senators.

LIV contract talks halted as Bryson DeChambeau weighs PGA return



Bryson DeChambeau: 'LIV is not going anywhere' ⛳

Bryson DeChambeau could become the next major name to return to the PGA Tour. But the move would come at a huge financial cost. The American golfer would likely have to walk away from close to $400 million in future earnings. His current LIV Golf contract expires in August, and talks over a new deal have slowed.LIV Golf is keen to keep DeChambeau. The Saudi-backed league fears losing another big star after Brooks Koepka’s exit. With Tiger Woods sidelined, DeChambeau is now one of golf’s biggest attractions. At 32, he rivals Rory McIlroy in pulling power. LIV wants him signed before the new season begins in Riyadh on February 4.Negotiations between LIV Golf and Bryson DeChambeau have hit a pause. The golfer is pushing for a larger role in shaping LIV’s future. He also wants a deal far bigger than the near $100 million signing bonus he received in 2022. DeChambeau believes his value has grown sharply since then.He feels he deserves a contract similar to Jon Rahm’s reported $370 million deal from December 2023. During earlier talks, DeChambeau made it clear that LIV understands his importance. He explained that the league knows what he brings to the table and that he is fully aware of his global value.He also said he is excited about the future, but accepted that careers can take unexpected turns.DeChambeau pointed to Koepka’s exit as proof that big decisions can come suddenly. He suggested that players always act based on what suits their personal needs and goals. That comment highlighted his own uncertainty about staying with LIV.Walking away from LIV would be costly. DeChambeau would miss out on easy earnings from the lightly contested 2025 LIV season, where he made over $10 million. A PGA return would also require a $3.7 million charitable payment, similar to Koepka’s. On top of that, he would forgo potential millions from FedEx Cup bonuses and the Player Equity Programme.DeChambeau is one of only four LIV golfers eligible for a fast-track return to the PGA Tour. The Returning Member Programme is limited to recent Major winners. Alongside him are Koepka, Rahm, and Cameron Smith. Others, like Hudson Swafford, faced long bans after leaving LIV.Time is running out. The Returning Member Programme closes on February 2. That is just two days before LIV’s new season begins. DeChambeau must decide quickly whether to chase legacy or secure another massive payday.Also Read: Who was Masashi “Jumbo” Ozaki?
