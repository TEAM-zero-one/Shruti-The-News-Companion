LaMelo Ball‚Äôs influence on the Charlotte Hornets squad

How to watch tonight‚Äôs game between the Charlotte Hornets and the Los Angeles Lakers (February 19, 2025)?

Theface a challenging matchup against the Los Angeles Lakers on Wednesday, February 19, at Crypto.com Arena, with star guard LaMelo Ball listed as probable due to an ankle injury. Ball‚Äôs availability remains a key storyline as the Hornets, already struggling with a 13-39 record, look to compete against a Lakers squad fighting for playoff positioning. LaMelo Ball , who leads the Charlotte Hornets with 27.3 points per game, has been a bright spot in an otherwise difficult season for Charlotte. His ankle issue has raised concerns, but the ""probable"" designation suggests he is likely to suit up. However, his effectiveness on the court could be limited, especially against a Lakers team known for its defensive intensity.The Hornets are already without several key players, including Brandon Miller (wrist) and Grant Williams (ACL), both ruled out for the season. Tre Mann (back) and Josh Okogie (hamstring) are also sidelined, further depleting Charlotte‚Äôs roster. Mark Williams, listed as probable for personal reasons, is expected to play, providing some relief in the frontcourt.For the Lakers, LeBron James is questionable with a foot injury, adding another layer of uncertainty to the game. James has been instrumental for Los Angeles, averaging 24.3 points and 7.7 rebounds per game. His potential absence could level the playing field, but the Lakers still boast depth with players like Austin Reaves and Rui Hachimura stepping up in recent weeks.The Charlotte Hornets ‚Äô struggles are evident in their -287 scoring differential, ranking 28th in the league with 106.3 points per game. LaMelo Ball‚Äôs ability to create offense, both for himself and his teammates, will be crucial if Charlotte hopes to pull off an upset. His 4.0 three-pointers per game lead the team, and his playmaking could exploit a Lakers defense that allows 112.5 points per contest.Fans can catch the game live on SportsNet LA and FDSSE or stream it on Fubo, with regional restrictions potentially applying. As the Charlotte Hornets navigate a season marred by injuries, LaMelo Ball‚Äôs performance‚Äîand health‚Äîwill remain under the spotlight.Also read: Why are the Los Angeles Lakers and Charlotte Hornets playing today?

‚Äô status for the‚Äô upcoming game against the Charlotte Hornets remains uncertain as he is listed as questionable due to a foot injury. The Lakers, holding a 32-20 record, are set to face the struggling Hornets (13-39) at Crypto.com Arena on Wednesday, February 19, at 10:00 PM ET. James‚Äô potential absence could significantly impact the Lakers‚Äô performance, as he continues to be a cornerstone of the team‚Äôs success. LeBron James , averaging 24.4 points, 7.4 rebounds, and 8.6 assists over the last 20 games, is not only the Los Angeles Lakers‚Äô leading scorer but also their top rebounder and playmaker. His ability to dominate both ends of the floor has been crucial for Los Angeles, which ranks 14th in the league with 113.3 points per game. Without him, the team‚Äôs offensive rhythm and defensive presence could take a hit, especially against a Hornets squad that, despite their poor record, has shown resilience in certain areas.The Lakers‚Äô injury report also includes Maxi Kleber, who is out with a foot injury. Kleber‚Äôs absence further depletes the team‚Äôs depth, putting additional pressure on role players like Austin Reaves and Rui Hachimura to step up. Reaves, averaging 20.2 points and 6.9 assists in the last 20 games, has been a reliable secondary option, but the Lakers‚Äô chances of securing a win would undoubtedly be higher with LeBron James on the court.On the Hornets‚Äô side, LaMelo Ball is listed as probable with an ankle injury, providing a glimmer of hope for Charlotte. Ball, averaging 27.3 points per game, is the Hornets‚Äô leading scorer and a key facilitator. His presence could pose challenges for the Los Angeles Lakers‚Äô defense, particularly if LeBron James is sidelined. However, the Hornets are dealing with their own injury woes, including season-ending absences for Grant Williams, Brandon Miller, and Tre Mann.The game will be broadcast on SportsNet LA and FDSSE, with live streaming available on Fubo.

head coach, who has guidedboth in the NBA and with Team USA , recently reflected on a defining moment in Curry‚Äôs illustrious career. In Netflix ‚Äôs Court of Gold docuseries , which chronicles Team USA‚Äôs journey to the 2024 Paris Olympics gold medal, Kerr shared a game-changing play that enhanced Curry‚Äôs legendary status.The gold medal game against France was an intense battle as Team USA fought to maintain control in the final minutes. However, amid the mounting pressure, Stephen Curry delivered a clutch three-pointer that all but sealed the victory. The shot, executed with his signature poise, sent the crowd into a frenzy and left an indelible mark on basketball history.‚ÄúWhen it went in, the reaction of the crowd, of our bench, of France‚Äôs team‚Äîit was one of the greatest moments in basketball history,‚Äù Steve Kerr stated in the docuseries.The docuseries offers fans a behind-the-scenes look at the crucial possession that led to Curry‚Äôs iconic shot. As the game neared its climax, Kerr and the coaching staff were discussing their next move when Curry himself stepped up and signaled for a play known as ‚ÄúEar Tug.‚Äù‚ÄúWith a few minutes left, we were discussing what we were going to run, and so Steph came over and [tugs his ear]. We call the play ‚ÄòEar Tug,‚Äô it‚Äôs just a cleared-side pick-and-roll with Steph and LeBron [James]. Steph just basically said, ‚ÄòGive me the ball and I know where I want it, they can‚Äôt guard that,‚Äô‚Äù Kerr revealed.The confidence in Curry‚Äôs decision-making was justified. The play unfolded perfectly, as LeBron James delivered a behind-the-back pass to Curry. The ball left his hands and swished through the net, giving Team USA a decisive lead. Reflecting on the play, Curry explained why he called for it and how it played out exactly as he envisioned.‚ÄúEar Tug, for me, was a play that could kind of just get us organized and calm the momentum down,‚Äù Curry said. ‚ÄúLeBron had the ball, and I wanted him to get downhill. When I set the screen and came off, he threw that behind-the-back pass and the ball was in my hands before I could even think about what was happening.‚ÄùHis celebration after the shot‚Äî a calm-down gesture ‚Äîwas as much for himself as it was for the team. ‚ÄúI did like the little ‚ÄòCalm down‚Äô celebration, I was really kind of talking to myself, because you understand these four minutes will define our Team USA Olympic legacies,‚Äù he added.Kerr, who has witnessed Curry‚Äôs greatness for years, admitted that even now, the superstar continues to amaze him.‚ÄúAt this point, I am no longer surprised by anything Steph Curry does, but he continues to awe me.

New York Mets: New York Mets expected to re-sign Jose Quintana after Frankie Montas injury creates rotation void,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/mlb/news/new-york-mets-expected-to-re-sign-jose-quintana-after-frankie-montas-injury-creates-rotation-void/articleshow/118397461.cms,"Via ""X""

Frankie Montas injury makes Mets rethink rotation choices



Jose Quintana's 2024 performance makes him a likely choice



A logical move for the Mets



The New York Mets might be on the cusp of signing veteran lefty Jose Quintana following a premature injury to Frankie Montas. The righty will miss several weeks with a lat strain, creating a vital void in the Mets' rotation. Given the pitching depth concerns, pundits forecast the team to sign Quintana to a one-year, $12 million contract to solidify their staff.The New York Mets started the 2025 season with optimism following an active offseason, but the Frankie Montas injury has presented an early test. Montas, who was slated to be a major contributor in the rotation, is out indefinitely, making the Mets reassess their pitching depth.With Montas gone, the staff now has to rely on Kodai Senga, recently converted starter Clay Holmes, and less tested arms such as Paul Blackburn and Griffin Canning. This doubt has fueled speculation that the front office will return to Jose Quintana, an experienced pitcher who gave decent performances for the Mets in 2024.In his previous stint with the New York Mets, Jose Quintana posted a 10-10 record with a 3.75 ERA across 31 starts, logging 170 1/3 innings. His reliability and experience made him a key asset, especially in the postseason. Quintana was instrumental in the Mets‚Äô National League Division Series (NLDS) Game 4 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies, helping the team advance to the National League Championship Series (NLCS).At 36, Quintana is not a long-term answer, but his stability could be just what the Mets require as they get through the early stages of the season without Montas.The New York Mets are viewed as solid contenders for 2025, but the depth of their pitching is still a concern. Having Jose Quintana back not only would be a veteran's presence but would keep the rotation competitive while Frankie Montas is recovering.Since a decent one-year, $12 million contract is forecast, this signing now appears more plausible. If the Mets wish to prevent early-season woes, the reunion with Quintana might prove the safest and wisest option.Also Read: MLB Icon Dusty Baker sees shades of Hall of Famer Pop Lloyd in Francisco Lindor","The new york mets might be on the cusp of signing veteran lefty jose quintana following a premature injury to frankie montas.

India's probable XI vs Bangladesh:

Hot favourites India will begin their Champions Trophy campaign against Bangladesh in Group A on Thursday, and with just four teams in each group of the eight-team competition, every game matters in the quest to finish in the top two to qualify for the semifinals.Besides Bangladesh, India's other competitors in the group are hosts and defending champions Pakistan as well as New Zealand.India, who will play all their matches in Dubai, have the advantage of playing the entire tournament at just one venue and the players won't have to adjust to different pitches, unlike the other seven teams who will play across four venues -- Lahore, Karachi and Rawalpindi in Pakistan as well as Dubai.But the first match remains tricky. Despite knowing the historical nature of the Dubai track to have something in it for both batters and bowlers, India will have to take a call on whether to go in with three spinners or three pacers from their spin-heavy 15-member squad.India suffered a blow just before the tournament, with ace fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah ruled out because of a back injury. And with Mohammed Shami only recently returning to the team after a year-long injury layoff and Arshdeep Singh short on ODI experience, India coach Gautam Gambhir and captain Rohit Sharma have work to do in order to pick the bowling combination they want to go ahead with.India have as many as five spinners in the squad; namely Kuldeep Yadav, Varun Chakravarthy, and all-rounders Ravindra Jadeja, Axar Patel and Washington Sundar. While the pace-bowling unit has Harshit Rana and all-rounder Hardik Pandya besides Shami and Arshdeep.The dew expected late in the evening in Dubai is one factor that may prevent India from picking three spinners as it makes it difficult to grip the dewy ball. But with Axar being used at No. 5 against England and doing well, his inclusion can give India the balance they seek with a left-handed batting option in the mix in top five.However, the batting order looks sorted as the likes of Rohit, Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer and KL Rahul pick themselves, unless the think-tank wants Rishabh Pant to do the wicketkeeping duties instead of Rahul, who did the job during the three-match ODI series against England just before the Champions Trophy.Rohit Sharma (c), Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer, Hardik Pandya, Axar Patel, KL Rahul (wk), Ravindra Jadeja, Mohammed Shami, Kuldeep Yadav, Arshdeep Singh","India will begin their champions trophy campaign against bangladesh in group a on thursday.

The build-up to the return of the Champions Trophy after more than seven years has been nothing short of dramatic, but the three-week entertainment is finally set to begin with things settling in time for the action on the field to begin with the opening game between hosts Pakistan and New Zealand today, February 19.The competition will witness eight teams competing at four venues. India's matches are scheduled in Dubai, while the remaining fixtures are set for Karachi, Lahore and Rawalpindi in Pakistan, which returns to hosting an International Cricket Council (ICC) event for the first time since they co-hosted the 1996 World Cup.The 2017 winners Pakistan are also the defending champions.The tournament's organisation, following an eight-year gap, required overcoming numerous challenges. It holds particular significance amidst ongoing discussions about the position of ODIs in the current cricket world.No recent cricket tournament has faced such significant challenges stemming from geopolitical conflicts, rigid stances by two key participating cricket boards (India and Pakistan) and concerns about venue preparedness in the official host nation.The first match presents an intriguing contest -- an unpredictable yet skilful Pakistan squad facing New Zealand, an opponent that prioritises systematic approach above all else.Also See: IND vs PAK Match Date and Time However, the tournament's most anticipated encounter arrives on February 23 when India clash with Pakistan, bringing forth the usual surge of memories, sentiments, political statements and online discourse.This high-profile encounter will take place in Dubai, as India maintained its firm stance against travelling to Pakistan, citing safety issues.Beyond team dynamics, certain players aim to make this tournament a defining moment in their careers -- and none among them is bigger than Indian legends Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma.Their accomplishments and influence in contemporary cricket remain unparalleled. Now, as these two outstanding players approach the culmination of their illustrious careers, they aspire to conclude on a triumphant note.Regardless of the results, it seems unlikely that Kohli and Rohit will continue in India's ODI framework post the Champions Trophy . But nothing of that sort can be said with certainty despite the two already bidding adieu to the T20Is after the T20 World Cup last year.A fitting farewell tribute for Kohli and Rohit would coincide with the emergence of promising talents like Shubman Gill, who are poised to lead India's next cricketing generation.But a subpar performance in this tournament could jeopardise their likely desire to continue playing Tests, potentially prompting selectors to reassess their positions before India's tour of England in June.Failing to secure the Champions Trophy could place India's head coach Gautam Gambhir's position under review.Though India's recent victory over England in T20Is and ODIs at home offered Gambhir some breathing space, it cannot overshadow the team's struggles against New Zealand and Australia.However, clinching a global trophy would significantly strengthen his position.For the team as a whole, India aim to secure their first ICC trophy in the 50-over format since their 2013 Champions Trophy victory under Mahendra Singh Dhoni.India are pooled alongside Pakistan, New Zealand and Bangladesh. The 2013 winners will face Bangladesh on February 19, Pakistan on February 23 and New Zealand on March 2.Despite fading from cricket's spotlight recently, they remain capable of springing a surprise and can't be treated lightly or considered as pushovers.India's neighbours and arch-rivals must maintain composure and resilience during crucial moments. The host nation could prove formidable if they avoid focusing just on their match against India and stop viewing it as the ultimate challenge. Their bowling unit excels in pace, while batters such as Fakhar Zaman and Salman Ali Agha possess the ability to dominate opposition attacks.The Kiwis enter a different phase after Trent Boult and Tim Southee's departure. Kane Williamson remains their key player, and they are banking on his performance to secure their first ICC white-ball title despite consistent show in ICC tournaments across formats over the years.Despite the absence of their leading fast bowlers Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood, the Aussies remain formidable. The two-time champions possess a batting lineup well-suited to the ODI format's requirements.Previously dominant in limited-overs cricket, England have experienced a decline as several key players grapple with advancing years and diminishing performance levels. But they have a nice mix of youth and experience with Joe Root and Jos Buttler there to guide the likes of Harry Brook or Ben Duckett.The team, under Temba Bavuma's leadership, seeks to change the so-near-yet-so-far pattern. They reached the T20 World Cup final before losing to India in a dramatic finish to the final in Barbados last year and would want to build on that in the longer version of the two white-ball formats.The Afghans have evolved into a strong limited-overs side, capable of challenging any team with players like Rashid Khan and Rahmanullah Gurbaz in their ranks.","Champions trophy returns for the first time in more than seven years. India are pooled alongside pakistan, new zealand and bangladesh. India's matches are scheduled in dubai, while the remaining fixtures are set for karachi, lahore and rawalpindi in pakistan.
