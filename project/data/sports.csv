JLN rebuild could be inspired by Qatar's famed Sports City

NEW DELHI: Delhi's iconic sports venue, Jawaharlal Nehru (JLN) Stadium, which was originally built for the 1982 Asian Games and later refurbished at a cost of over Rs 900 crore ahead of the 2010 Commonwealth Games, will likely be demolished and undergo a major makeover, according to sports ministry officials.The ministry is considering plans to redevelop the venue into a sprawling sports city in coming years, catering to all major disciplines, including a lodging facility for athletes, officials said on Monday.The Union govt plans to overhaul the 102-acre JLN stadium complex into a state-of-the-art, multi-discipline premier facility equipped with world-class infrastructure for both training purposes and hosting major sporting events.""The planning is in the proposal stage. Other ministries, including the urban development ministry, need to be consulted as well. The timeline for the project and the estimated cost has not yet been worked out. But it's been decided to dismantle and redevelop the JLN stadium into a premier sports city,"" officials said.Officials told TOI that the proposed sports city would be modelled on Qatar's Sports City, also known as Aspire Zone, in the Baaya district of Al Rayyan, which is located near Doha. It was built in 2003 at a cost running into billions of dollars. The facility was central to Qatar's successful bid for the 2022 FIFA World Cup and forms a key part of its ambitions to host the Olympics in 2036. Last week, sports minister Mansukh Mandaviya and his team attended the second World Summit for Social Development in Qatar.It has been learnt that the minister visited the Sports City and was left impressed with the facilities. Mandaviya even enquired at length about the project development from the Qatari sports officials.According to ministry sources, a delegation from Qatar would soon visit Delhi to assess the viability of the JLN redevelopment project and prepare a roadmap for Indian authorities. The ministry would also study two other key sports infrastructure for JLN stadium redevelopment - Australia's Docklands stadium in Melbourne that can host cricket, Australian Rules football, rugby, cricket and soccer, and the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Sports Enclave closer home in Ahmedabad, which is spread across 650 acres and includes the Narendra Modi stadium and multiple Olympic-standard facilities. The project cost the Gujarat govt Rs 5,050 cr.""All offices inside the stadium, including some of the ministry's departments like Sports Authority of India (SAI), National Anti-Doping Agency (Nada), National Dope Testing Laboratory (NDTL), and Income Tax department will be relocated as and when the project takes off. Currently, over 100 acres of land that it occupies is not being used to its optimal level. Only 28 percent has been utilised,"" officials said.JLN stadium, with a seating capacity of 60,000, hosted several prestigious international events, including the Delhi CWG 2010 and U17 FIFA World Cup in 2017. It recently received a major renovation for the World Para Athletics Championships, which saw the participation of over 2,200 athletes globally from 104 nations.A new blue-coloured, nine-lane Mondo synthetic track was installed at both the main ground and warm-up area for an approximate cost of Rs 25 cr, while the total stadium refurbishment cost was around Rs 80 crore.The facility is primarily used for athletics events and football matches and has an archery, badminton and table tennis academy.",Jln rebuild could be inspired by qatar's famed sports city.

Klay Thompson apologizes to Megan Thee Stallion after airport mishap





Megan Thee Stallion on her relationship with Klay Thompson





Klay Thompson might be known for his calm demeanor on the court, but off it, the Dallas Mavericks star recently showed his softer side. After arriving late to pick up his girlfriend, rapper Megan Thee Stallion , from the airport, Thompson went viral for his heartfelt apology and his remorse. The clip, shared by Megan on social media, captured the NBA star trying to make amends with flowers in hand and genuine regret on his face.The moment quickly became a talking point among fans, who couldn’t get enough of the couple’s chemistry and Thompson’s down-to-earth approach. It also comes at a time when both are thriving in their respective careers, with Thompson beginning his new season in Dallas and Megan releasing new music inspired by their relationship.In the video posted online, Klay Thompson can be seen handing Megan a bouquet while apologizing repeatedly for showing up late. “Roses for my boo,” he said while driving her home. “I’m sorry I was late, babe. Damn it. I’m sorry. I thought I timed it well. Ah, just sorry. There’s no excuse.”Fans immediately flooded social media with amused and affectionate reactions, praising Thompson’s gesture as “adorably human.” The incident added another viral moment to their growing list of public appearances since confirming their romance earlier this year.Over the summer, the couple enjoyed a fishing trip that gave fans a glimpse into their playful dynamic. “So today, Klay is taking me on another adventure and we’re going fishing,” Megan said at the time. Thompson responded lovingly: “I got my queen on board, of course I feel cool. I’m the coolest guy in this harbor!”For Megan, whose real name is Megan Jovon Ruth Pete, the relationship marks a new chapter. “This is my first relationship where I’ve ever been with somebody who’s genuinely a nice person, and he makes me genuinely happy,” she told Page Six.“I just never dated somebody like him before and I’m just grateful that he’s here by my side and he feels the same way about me.”Despite occasional public skepticism — even from personalities like Shaquille O’Neal, who jokingly doubted their relationship on The Big Podcast — fans have embraced the pair’s authenticity. O’Neal later called Megan “athletic, so beautiful, and so gorgeous,” insisting his remarks were lighthearted.For now, Thompson and Megan seem unfazed by outside opinions. Their recent viral moment only serves to extend a genuine connection between two stars from different worlds. The duo has been very active on social media to share their personal moments of joy and love. Megan has over 32.7 million followers on Instagram, while Thomson has 16.8 million fans on the platform.Stallion is fully embracing her lover girl era — and fans are loving it. The three-time Grammy winner took to Instagram to tease a behind-the-scenes look at her new single “Lover Girl,” a song she openly admits is inspired by her boyfriend, NBA star Klay Thompson.“This is my song about Klay,” Megan said in the clip with a shy smile. “First n**** in life that has ever gotten a song outta me.” Fans quickly flooded the comments, cheering for the rapper’s happiness and her growing romance with the four-time NBA champion.Listeners have already picked up on the deeper meaning behind “Lover Girl.” In the track, Megan raps about finding someone who truly matches her energy and confidence. “Ayy, your n**** fantasy, my man reality,” she spits, celebrating a relationship built on mutual respect and balance.Also Read: NBA’s highly anticipated Europe-based league’s potential release date revealed","Klay thompson went viral for his heartfelt apology to girlfriend megan thee stallion.

Chiefs tight end Noah Gray earns NFL Salute to Service nomination as Travis Kelce successor buzz intensifies in Kansas City,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/chiefs-tight-end-noah-gray-earns-nfl-salute-to-service-nomination-as-travis-kelce-successor-buzz-intensifies-in-kansas-city/articleshow/125197721.cms,"Buzz is that Noah Gray might replace Travis Kelce as latter nears season ends.

Noah Gray’s off-field leadership draws praise



More NFL coverage:

The Kansas City Chiefs could soon face a major transition. With Travis Kelce widely expected to retire after the 2025 NFL season, the franchise is preparing for life without its future Hall of Famer. Since confirming his return earlier this year, the 36-year-old has hinted that this might be his final run, telling reporters back in September, “Man, it’s the last one on the contract right now. ”As the season unfolds, attention has shifted toward finding the right player to carry the torch. Inside the organization, tight end Noah Gray has quietly earned respect both on and off the field and his recent nomination for the 2025 NFL Salute to Service Award shows just that. The recognition, presented by the NFL and USAA, honors individuals across the league who have showed exceptional commitment to supporting members of the U.S. military.Noah Gray’s passion for service is rooted in his close partnership with Friends in Service of Heroes (FISH), a Kansas City nonprofit that aids active-duty personnel, reservists, veterans, and their families. His involvement with the organization began in 2021 and has since become a cornerstone of his community work.Through FISH, Gray has helped provide service dogs and adaptive equipment to assist veterans, supported families during the holidays, and offered comfort to those struggling after service. His efforts have not only strengthened the Chiefs’ local ties but also highlighted his character as one of the team’s most respected young leaders.Still, while Gray is gaining momentum, the Chiefs’ long-term succession plan may extend beyond their current roster. NFL Draft analyst Nick Baumgardner of The New York Times recently projected Oregon tight end Kenyon Sadiq as a player to watch. Standing 6-foot-3 and weighing 245 pounds, Sadiq has totaled 22 catches for 311 yards and five touchdowns this season, averaging 14.1 yards per reception. He earned an 80.4 grade from Pro Football Focus, ranking second nationally among returning tight ends, and Baumgardner has him listed as the No. 26 overall prospect in the 2026 NFL Draft.For now, Chiefs fans are showing their support for Gray, who has become a symbol of consistency and heart within the locker room. The NFL will reveal the finalists for the Salute to Service Award in January, with the winner honored during the NFL Honors ceremony leading up to the Super Bowl. Regardless of who follows Travis Kelce, Noah Gray’s leadership, on and off the field, is already helping define the next chapter in Kansas City.","Noah gray has been nominated for the 2025 nfl salute to service award.

Trey Benson Week 11 update: Jonathan Gannon details Cardinals RB’s recovery and return



More coverage in NFL:

The Arizona Cardinals are navigating a critical stretch in their 2025 season as running back Trey Benson works toward returning from a knee injury suffered in Week 4. Benson has been on injured reserve for several weeks, forcing the team to adjust its backfield rotation. While he became eligible to return last week, he did not play against the Seattle Seahawks, leaving his Week 11 status uncertain.The Cardinals’ rushing attack has faced challenges in Benson’s absence, especially with fellow back Bam Knight exiting Week 10 with an ankle injury. With the team balancing player health and roster flexibility, Benson’s potential return is under careful evaluation, and his activation could have significant implications for Arizona’s offensive game plan in Week 11.The team continues to monitor Benson’s progress closely, assessing his readiness before making any roster decisions. His rehab has shown steady improvement, and the Cardinals are taking a cautious approach to ensure he returns fully healthy. The backfield situation remains a top priority as the team prepares for Week 11.“He’s doing well. Take it day-by-day there,” head coach Jonathan Gannon said regarding Benson’s progress.“He’s not gonna be out there today, but he is doing better. What does close mean? I don’t know what close means. Take it day-by-day, but he’s doing well. He’s progressing.”Benson must first be designated to return from injured reserve, which would trigger a 21-day window for activation to the 53-man roster. If he is not activated within that period, he would miss the remainder of the 2025 season. His availability is particularly important with Bam Knight’s ankle issue leaving the backfield depth uncertain. Should both Benson and Knight be unavailable, Emari Demercado is expected to lead the backfield, with Michael Carter providing backup support.Monitoring Wednesday’s roster updates will provide clarity on whether Benson will suit up for Week 11. His activation could be crucial for the Cardinals’ rushing strategy and offensive flexibility as the team navigates a critical part of its 2025 schedule. With the season entering a decisive stretch, Benson’s status may influence how Arizona approaches its remaining games and manages its running back rotation.","Arizona cardinals running back trey benson has been out since week 4 with a knee injury.

Tom Brady reacts publicly to Drew Brees replacing Mark Sanchez at FOX Sports

Drew Brees steps into Mark Sanchez’s former role as Brady highlights the accuracy conversation





Tom Brady reacted to Drew Brees taking over Mark Sanchez’s spot at FOX Sports, and the response instantly pulled attention across the NFL . The move puts two of the most accurate quarterbacks in league history under the same network roof, and Brady made sure the focus keyword, Tom Brady, was in the first line as he set the tone with his usual dry-fire humor.Brees’ hiring comes as FOX Sports officially parted ways with Sanchez following his ongoing felony case. The network announced Brees’ arrival with a highlight reel, and Brady immediately jumped in with a punchy, public welcome. The two quarterbacks now headline a reshaped analyst lineup built on production, accuracy and career-long credibility.Tom Brady did not hold back when FOX Sports confirmed Drew Brees as the new analyst replacing Mark Sanchez. Brady shared FOX Sports’ announcement clip and attached a line that instantly made waves across social media. His message read:“And just like that I become the 3rd most accurate QB at @FOXSports (Terry still has both of us beat) Welcome to the family @drewbrees!!!”The accuracy comment was rooted in fact. Drew Brees retired with a 67.7% completion rate, which places him third all time behind Joe Burrow and Tua Tagovailoa. Brady’s reaction added a layer of self-awareness and competition that people rarely hear from him, and it worked because the numbers back all of it.Brees is stepping into a major role. FOX Sports expects him to call games with Adam Amin starting next week and remain on the team through at least 2026. He already has experience across NBC Sports, ESPN’s “First Take” and Netflix’s international game coverage. FOX Sports is betting on a quarterback who built his legacy on precision, control and film-room mastery.Mark Sanchez’s exit shifts the balance of FOX’s broadcast team. According to multiple outlets, FOX Sports cut ties as Sanchez faces a felony battery case in Indiana. He pleaded not guilty, and the legal process is ongoing. FOX Sports confirmed to The Athletic that he is no longer part of the broadcast crew. The decision opened the lane for Brees, and Brady’s reaction shows that the quarterback fraternity is already treating the move as a major shakeup.Brady and Brees owned their era, stacking numbers that still look unreal. Tom Brady started 333 games, threw for 89,214 yards, 649 touchdowns, and finished with a 251-82 record, putting him first all time in passing yards, passing touchdowns, completions, attempts, and starts. Drew Brees wasn’t far behind, going 172-114 with 80,358 yards and 571 touchdowns while completing nearly 68% of his throws. He ranks second in league history in completions, attempts, yards, and touchdowns, sitting right behind Brady in every major category.Tom Brady completely lost it in the booth after Matthew Stafford uncorked a filthy no look touchdown during the Rams-49ers matchup, and the moment was pure chaos in the best way. Stafford was cooking all afternoon, dropping 280 yards and four scores as the Rams buried San Francisco 42–26, but that no look dart to Colby Parkinson flipped Brady into full fan mode on live TV. The man practically bounced in his seat with Kevin Burkhardt as he shouted, “Look at those eyes. Don’t look at me! Don’t look at my eyes! Don’t look at my eyes!” Stafford barely glanced at his target before firing a laser into the end zone, and Brady reacted like he’d just watched a magician pull off the trick of the year.Drew Brees enters FOX Sports at a moment when the network needs stability, professionalism and credibility in the booth. He retired with 80,358 passing yards, 571 touchdowns and one of the most efficient careers the league has ever seen. The numbers place him behind Tom Brady in yardage and touchdowns but ahead of almost everyone in accuracy and consistency.Brees shared his own statement following the announcement. He said:“I appreciate the opportunity FOX has given me in the booth and with their team. I hope my passion for this game is reflected in the knowledge and insight I provide to fans each Sunday.”His arrival is rooted in a reputation built across two decades with the New Orleans Saints and the San Diego Chargers. Former teammate Darren Sproles described Brees’ leadership on “Up & Adams,” saying:“For him, to mention me out of all the weapons that he had. That is very special. With Drew, you didn’t have to think like that on the field. Drew always put you in the right place at the right time.”These details matter because FOX Sports is replacing a quarterback known for chaotic storylines with one known for structure and precision. Mark Sanchez’s legal issues removed him from the booth as he deals with felony battery and multiple misdemeanor charges after an incident in Indianapolis earlier this year. He had already been sidelined after being stabbed and arrested on the same night. He pleaded not guilty and awaits further proceedings.Drew Brees offers none of the uncertainty, and that is part of the reason FOX Sports moved quickly. He already worked on NBC’s Notre Dame broadcasts, contributed to Football Night in America, and appeared on “First Take” before signing with FOX Sports. His presence turns the broadcast team into a high-accuracy, high-football-IQ group, which pairs naturally with the tone Tom Brady wants to bring to television.Brady himself is walking into his own broadcast era. He will be in the booth this Sunday covering the Detroit Lions and Washington Commanders, while the New England Patriots and Tampa Bay Buccaneers face each other in one of the biggest matchups of the weekend. Brady refused to pick a side in the game, saying:“Just... don’t ask me to pick any sides here.”","Tom brady welcomed drew brees to fox sports after mark sanchez’s exit.

The untold story of Josh Jacobs’s parents and their fight to give him a better life



More NFL coverage

When Josh Jacobs locks in, the world fades. Inside the red zone, his focus narrows to one thing — the end zone. The roar of the crowd, the shuffle of defenders, even the sidelines disappear from view. “We call it flow state,” Jacobs said last month. “You become out of body almost.” That rare mental clarity has turned him into one of the NFL ’s most relentless running backs — a player who thrives under pressure and makes the impossible look effortless.Selected to the NFL All-Rookie Team in 2019, Jacobs’ rise was fast and fearless. He hit the 1,000-yard mark in his first two seasons, earned a Pro Bowl selection in 2020, and by 2022, led the league with 1,653 rushing yards. His move to the Green Bay Packers in 2024 marked a new chapter — and he’s wasted no time making his mark. With 42 carries, 150 rushing yards, and two touchdowns in his first two games of 2025, he’s already extended his touchdown streak to 10 consecutive matches, just shy of an NFL record. But beyond his on-field glory, fans are just as intrigued by the story behind the star — his family.Josh Jacobs’ father, Marty Jacobs, has long been the heart behind his son’s success.After divorcing Josh’s mother, LaChelle, in 2006, Marty took custody of their four children despite having little money. They lived out of a car or in low-cost motels in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Marty juggled multiple jobs, often skipping meals so his children wouldn’t go hungry. His strength and sacrifice shaped Josh’s resilience and drive — qualities that later defined his career. Today, Marty watches proudly from the stands and mentors young athletes, passing forward the lessons that carried his family through hardship.Josh’s mother, LaChelle Jacobs, also played a part in his early life. Following the divorce, she initially raised their five children alone. However, their relationship eventually grew strained, with reports of financial disputes and emotional distance. Josh ultimately chose to live with his father, whose perseverance became his guiding light.Of Filipino and African American descent, Jacobs celebrates both sides of his heritage. His Filipino grandmother, from Angeles City, left a lasting impression on him — so much so that he tattooed her portrait on his left hand. His dual heritage is a badge of pride, one he carries into every game as one of the few Filipino Americans in the NFL.From sleeping in cars to lighting up stadiums, Josh Jacobs’ journey mirrors his father’s unbreakable spirit. Their bond, forged through struggle, remains his greatest victory.","Josh jacobs’ father, marty jacobs, has long been the heart behind his son’s success.

Why Matthew Golden’s absence matters: Eagles defensive shakeups and Packers offensive pressure

Matthew Golden has become one of the Green Bay Packers’ most interesting young pieces. His early-season flashes made his workload worth watching, but the timing of his first real injury could not be worse. The Packers are fighting to stay afloat in a tight NFC race, and tonight’s matchup against the Philadelphia Eagles may determine how far they can push in November.Green Bay enters Monday Night Football thin at pass catcher. Jayden Reed is on injured reserve, Tucker Kraft is out for the season, and two more receivers are banged up. Fans want clarity. Jordan Love wants stability. Golden’s health sits at the center of both questions.So where do things stand?Matthew Golden is listed as questionable tonight against the Eagles. The wide receiver entered Week 10 as questionable with a shoulder injury, but his practice trend made his status doubtful from the start. Golden logged a limited session on Thursday before missing practice entirely on Friday and Saturday. That is the exact pattern that typically results in a player being ruled out.Reporters around the Packers believe Golden was “fighting to play,” but multiple outlets, including the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, have noted that he did not suffer a setback.This indicates the team is prioritizing long-term availability over short-term risk.Golden has been efficient when healthy, recording 23 receptions for 262 yards this year. He has also added value as a runner with eight carries for 45 yards. His absence removes another layer of versatility from Green Bay’s offense, which is already stretched thin.The Packers will rely heavily on Christian Watson and Romeo Doubs. Doubs, who has seen 41 targets over his last five games, projects as Jordan Love’s volume receiver again. Savion Williams and Dontayvion Wicks were limited in Saturday’s practice and are more likely to be active than Golden, though neither is fully healthy.Golden’s absence also matters for Green Bay’s late-season evaluation. As a first-round pick expected to grow into a major contributor, missing primetime reps slows his development curve. If the Packers cannot stretch the field against Philadelphia, tonight’s game may show exactly how much they lose without Golden’s speed and yards-after-catch ability.Here are the full Week 10 broadcast details for tonight’s matchup at Lambeau Field:The Eagles come off a Week 9 bye, while the Packers are trying to recover from a 16-13 loss to the Carolina Panthers. The Arizona Republic projects a 27-24 Philadelphia win, but national predictions remain split.This game carries more depth than a single injury update. Both teams enter Lambeau with significant defensive and personnel storylines. For Philadelphia, cornerback Jaire Alexander has already been ruled out. ESPN’s Adam Schefter reported that Alexander remains “acclimating to the defensive system” and recovering from a knee injury, so the Eagles kept him home to focus on his preparation.The Eagles have already tried multiple fixes at cornerback this year. Adoree’ Jackson and Kelee Ringo struggled early, leading to trades for Jakorian Bennett and Alexander. Bennett is expected to suit up tonight after missing time with a pec injury, and Eagles analysts have pushed for him to get extended snaps.Green Bay faces challenges of its own. With Golden out and Kraft sidelined for the season, the Packers are relying on narrow depth at receiver and tight end. Doubs has emerged as the primary target, while Watson remains the explosive but inconsistent threat.Golden’s situation also intersects with betting conversations. Analysts are wary of expecting production from a rookie who played only 36.9% of snaps last season and has not exceeded six targets in any 2025 game. Without him tonight, the Packers offense becomes easier to predict but harder to diversify.Defensively, Philadelphia enters the matchup improving their pass rush. After losing Josh Sweat in free agency, the team leaned on Josh Uche, who has produced 20 pressures and holds the No. 11 PFF grade among 110 edge rushers. The Eagles then traded for Jaelan Phillips and brought Brandon Graham out of retirement to stabilize their front.For Green Bay, that means more pressure on Love without one of his key security valves. If Wicks or Williams struggles, the offense could become one-dimensional.","Green bay packers wide receiver matthew golden is listed as questionable with a shoulder injury.

Bill Belichick’s tactical shift and Jordon Hudson’s ‘Banned’ necklace steal UNC spotlight

More coverage in NFL:

Bill Belichick and the North Carolina Tar Heels are finding their rhythm after a rocky start to the season. The Tar Heels defeated Stanford 20-15 on Saturday, earning their second straight win and improving to 4-5. With three games left, they need two more victories to become bowl eligible, a goal that now looks much more achievable under Belichick’s leadership.Yet, the attention after the game wasn’t only on the field. Belichick’s girlfriend, Jordon Hudson, became a trending topic when she was spotted wearing a “banned” necklace. The statement accessory appeared to reference earlier reports claiming she had been barred from UNC’s football facilities. Her appearance quickly caught media attention and fueled discussions online, adding a new twist to the Belichick era in Chapel Hill.Following the victory, Belichick openly admitted that he could have handled certain aspects of the season better. The veteran coach said he and his staff have learned more about their players as the season has progressed and have made key adjustments that have led to improved performance.“I think we have tried to do that more as we’ve gone forward, and I think it’s benefitted some of them.Some of those if we could have identified it a little bit sooner, that would have been helpful, but we didn’t and it’s nobody’s fault, it’s just kind of the way it was. ” Belichick said after the game.Those adjustments are starting to show results. The Tar Heels have tightened their defense, improved communication on the field, and found balance on offense. Belichick’s focus on player development and situational football has helped turn close losses into hard-fought wins.

How the fight between Daron Payne and Amon Ra St Brown escalated and why the league stepped in

What losing Daron Payne means for a Washington Commanders team collapsing under its own weight

Daron Payne’s suspension dropped on Monday, and it hit a Washington Commanders team that already looks broken. The defensive tackle was punished one game after punching Detroit Lions wide receiver Amon Ra St Brown during Sunday’s 44 to 22 loss. The league called it a violation of the rules that prohibit striking an opponent in the head or neck area.The punch happened after Detroit scored in the second quarter. Amon Ra St Brown walked through the middle of the field, said something to Daron Payne, and Payne responded by swinging at him. The moment went viral because the celebration before it involved Amon Ra St Brown pointing toward a suite where President Donald Trump was sitting. The Commanders fell apart from there.The NFL reviewed the play and announced the suspension without pay. NFL Network’s Mike Garafolo reported that Daron Payne can appeal, but he is expected to miss Washington’s game against the Miami Dolphins in Madrid. The league’s decision aligned with earlier discipline in 2025, including the one game handed to Philadelphia Eagles defensive tackle Jalen Carter for spitting on Dak Prescott.Washington players argued that Daron Payne reacted to an earlier hit. Defensive tackle Javon Kinlaw insisted Amon Ra St Brown threw the first punch.Kinlaw told reporters, “It’s some bulls… 100 percent. Daron retaliated. The refs literally saw the first punch. I do not blame him for the way he reacted. Tempers got to flaring.”Amon Ra St Brown gave a different account. He said, “Two plays before that we got into a little scuffle, back and forth. Then we end up scoring and I go up to him. I say a little something, nothing crazy, and then he decides to swing on me.”The touchdown that sparked the situation came on a drive where Detroit controlled the field. Amon Ra St Brown scored, pointed up at the suite where Trump was located, and did his signature dance. Daron Payne punched him moments later, and officials ejected him.Detroit dominated from that point on. Jared Goff threw for 320 yards and three touchdowns. The Lions averaged 8.8 yards per play, and Washington delivered its worst defensive outing since 2014. Washington committed three personal fouls during the game. Javon Kinlaw struck an official during the same sequence. Quan Martin said he was kicked during a separate play, which led to another unsportsmanlike conduct flag.Former Washington quarterback Robert Griffin III also weighed in. He posted on X, “As a leader of Washington’s defense, Daron Payne should know better than to throw a punch on the field. He should be suspended. There is no place for this in sports.”The suspension hits a team that is already hanging together by threads. Washington is 3 and 7. It has lost four straight games by at least 20 points. The Commanders entered the year as a trendy NFC pick after reaching the NFC Championship Game last season. Now they have a 1 percent playoff chance and no clear path out.Rookie quarterback Jayden Daniels remains sidelined with an elbow injury. The team has not placed him on injured reserve, but there is no timeline for return. Marcus Mariota has stepped in and has not been able to produce enough offense to keep games competitive. The locker room looks frustrated, and the sideline looks lost.Head coach Dan Quinn made it clear that Washington has not met its own standard. He said, “We make a big deal about our Commander standards, and we sure as hell are not coaching or playing up to it. We are way off, and that is up to us to fix that.”Losing Daron Payne only deepens the problem. He holds a 76.0 PFSN impact grade, ranking 37th among eligible defensive tackles. He is one of the highest paid interior defenders in the league and is due more than one million dollars per game. If the suspension stands, he loses that check. It was also the first ejection of his career.The fallout goes beyond money. Washington’s defense has struggled to generate pressure or stop the run. Removing one of the only stable veterans makes a weak unit weaker. The mistakes on Sunday showed a team losing emotional control during the hardest stretch of its season.The moment exposed what the record already said. Washington is not disciplined, not healthy, and not close to the version of itself that played deep into January last year. Daron Payne will be eligible to return after the Dolphins game. The bigger issue is whether any part of this season is still salvageable.",Commanders defensive tackle is suspended one game after punching amon ra st. brown during washington’s 44 to 22 loss. Washington players argued that daron payne reacted to an earlier hit. Former washington quarterback robert griffin iii also weighed in.

Leadership mistakes that led to Brian Daboll’s firing and Giants’ losing streak



More coverage in NFL:

Brian Daboll’s tenure with the New York Giants has come to an end. Once hailed as the NFL Coach of the Year after leading the team to its first playoff win since Super Bowl 46, Daboll’s early success masked underlying issues that ultimately derailed his career in New York. The Giants’ leadership decided to part ways following yet another fourth-quarter collapse, extending the team’s losing streak and highlighting deeper problems both on and off the field.The fall from grace has been swift. Daboll’s four-year run began with promise, including a 7-2 start in 2022 and a high-profile playoff victory, earning him league-wide accolades. However, since 2023, the Giants’ record has plummeted to 5-22, leaving Daboll with a career record of 20-40-1 and a dismal NFC East performance of 5-17-1. Frustration mounted as repeated blown leads, sideline outbursts, and questionable decision-making overshadowed his early achievements.Reports indicate that internal conflicts and inconsistent leadership played a major role in Daboll’s downfall. Feuds with defensive coordinator Wink Martindale, sideline meltdowns, and clashes over player accountability created a fractured environment. Daboll’s player-friendly approach, while initially praised, failed to instill discipline, resulting in costly mistakes and a lack of cohesion on both offense and defense.Controversial decisions, including risky play calls for rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart, further fueled criticism, especially after multiple injuries raised concerns about team safety.Daboll’s firing also raises questions about the Giants’ long-term direction. With Kafka stepping in, the team faces an uphill battle to stabilize its roster and culture. Analysts point to a combination of coaching missteps, draft struggles, and player development issues as key factors in the franchise’s decline. The organization now must rebuild trust, accountability, and consistency if it hopes to return to playoff contention.The Giants have named offensive coordinator Mike Kafka as interim head coach for the remainder of the season. As the organization evaluates its future, the spotlight also turns to general manager Joe Schoen, whose draft decisions have contributed to roster instability. Brian Daboll’s exit marks only the second in-season firing for the franchise since 1976, underscoring the severity of the situation. His rapid fall from NFL Coach of the Year to leading one of the league’s most struggling teams serves as a stark reminder of the high-pressure, results-driven world of professional football.","Brian daboll's four-year run began with promise, including a 7-2 start in 2022 and a high-profile playoff victory.

The humiliating loss has critics calling for an upgrade in goal, as the loss showed a stark wake-up call for a team aiming for the Stanley Cup. Criticising the team’s gameplay, Oilers forward Leon Draisaitl has recently explained why “sometimes a slap in the face is just what you need.” The forward has discussed why the team's 9-1 loss to the Avalanche could be what the group needed.According to the current standings, after 16 games, Edmonton sits at 6-6-4, placing them seventh in the Pacific Division, which falls short of the expectations placed on a team widely considered a Stanley Cup contender.

Let’s take a look at what Oilers forward Leon Draisaitl has to say about the team’s performance and defeat.Leon Draisaitl has shared his perspective on the Edmonton Oilers after their recent 9–1 loss to the Colorado Avalanche. He believes that such a defeat, while painful, could serve as a harsh wake-up call for the team.The defeat was required as it could act as a reality check or motivation booster for the Oilers. Draisaitl opened up about the team's defeat in a recent interview, where he also emphasized the importance of focusing on consistency and teamwork over perfection.Speaking to the media, Leon Draisaitl stated, “Oh yeah, sometimes it's, you know, easier to get really whacked across the face instead of, you know, pity-patting around for another couple of weeks and, you know, win one, lose two and, you know, you never really find it. So, sometimes a slap on the face is just what you need, and you know, again, we got to respond.”Emphasizing about the team’s consistency, the Oilers player further added, “Why? You don't need every guy playing at their absolute best. This is not the time for that. But you need, you know, a B-plus game from everyone. And if you have a B-plus game from most guys, and some guys are playing great, then you start to look like a team, and you can build some momentum…. Not everyone plays their A game every single night, but we need more consistency in our B-plus game. ” (source: TSN)Draisaitl’s comments reflect leadership and a practical approach towards their game. For the loss, he’s not blaming anyone, but he’s clearly challenging his teammates to be more consistent. His advice seemed more grounded and accountable, serving as a reminder that unity and teamwork are essential to dodge difficult moments like this.","Oilers forward leon draisaitl has shared his perspective on the edmonton oilers after their recent 9-1 loss to the colorado avalanche.

A random drug test uncovered something life-changing for Alex Singleton

“The prognosis is excellent for me and my family,”

“For Broncos fans, I fully expect to return to the field very soon.”

More coverage on NFL:



Sometimes, a twist of fate can save a life. Denver Broncos linebacker Alex Singleton learned that the hard and miraculous way when a routine NFL drug test turned into something far more serious. What began as a standard league procedure revealed a testicular tumor that doctors quickly removed the day after Denver’s win over the Raiders. Now, the 30-year-old linebacker says his prognosis is “excellent,” assuring fans he’s already focused on getting back to football soon.In a story that stunned both teammates and fans, Alex Singleton shared that a random NFL drug test two weeks ago flagged unusual results, leading to further medical testing. Those tests revealed a cancerous testicular tumor, a diagnosis that came completely out of the blue for the veteran linebacker.Singleton underwent successful surgery just one day after the Broncos’ Thursday Night Football victory over the Raiders. The procedure went smoothly, and doctors say his prognosis looks very positive, with no signs the cancer has spread. It’s a turn of events that Singleton himself calls “life-saving,” especially since the tumor was caught early.After recovering from surgery, Singleton took to social media to share the news directly with Broncos Nation.he said.His message struck a chord with fans across the league, who flooded his posts with encouragement and prayers. Broncos teammates, including Patrick Surtain II and Justin Simmons, reshared his announcement with messages of love and support. The team is reportedly rallying around Singleton during his recovery, with head coach Sean Payton describing him as “the definition of toughness.”Singleton’s experience is a powerful reminder of how early detection can make all the difference.

Singleton’s transparency about his health journey has already sparked conversations about awareness, regular checkups, and removing the stigma around men’s health discussions.While no specific return date has been announced, all signs point to a swift recovery. Singleton’s resilience both physical and mental has long defined his career, from his CFL beginnings to becoming one of Denver’s most reliable defenders.For now, he’s focused on healing, resting, and inspiring others in the process. As he put it best, this isn’t a setback, it’s just another challenge to tackle.","Denver broncos linebacker alex singleton was diagnosed with testicular cancer after a random drug test.
