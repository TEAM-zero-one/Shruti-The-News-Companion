NHL insider reveals NHL and NHLPA are talking about new cap rules for playoffs





Why NHL teams and fans are paying close attention to this salary cap talk

Every NHL season brings intense playoff battles, but behind the scenes, there’s growing talk about something else, money rules. A recent report reveals that the league and the players’ union are in early talks to change how playoff salaries work. While nothing is final, one key insider has now explained the possible changes. And if approved, it could affect how teams are built for the postseason.On June 17, 2025, sports journalist Chris Johnston discussed a new topic on The Chris Johnston Show that has caught the attention of hockey fans. He shared that both the NHL and the NHL Players’ Association (NHLPA) are now in talks about setting some kind of “playoff salary cap.”Right now, the salary cap only applies during the regular season. But once the playoffs begin, teams are free to use players coming off long-term injuries, even if that pushes their total salary far above the usual limit. This has created what many call a “loophole,” and some teams have been criticized for using it to their advantage.Johnston said, “This is something that’s at the discussion stage… but there is a desire to at least look at changes.”No rule has been passed yet, but if the idea moves forward, it could stop teams from using certain tricks to get stronger just in time for playoffs.In recent years when clubs such the Tampa Bay Lightning employed the existing method to include star players during the postseason, this issue grew front and center. Many thought it was unjust even though the rules permitted what they did. Some fans believe this gives an advantage to rich or smart teams that can work around the cap.Also Read: NHL Salary Cap Loophole Gives Teams Like Dallas And Florida Extra Leverage: Report The NHL and NHLPA have not confirmed any changes, but sources from Sportsnet and TSN confirm that these talks are real.

But as next season draws near, several think the league should move swiftly to prevent more controversy. Everybody is now waiting to see if the NHL and NHLPA agree on a new playoff salary restriction.","Nhl insider leaks explosive details on nhl-nhlpa talks for controversial playoff salary rule change.

Josh Allen breaks silence on controversial Tush Push after NFL rule talks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/josh-allen-breaks-silence-on-controversial-tush-push-after-nfl-rule-talks/articleshow/121916060.cms,"Josh Allen breaks silence on controversial Tush Push after NFL rule talks (Image via Getty)

Josh Allen shares his thoughts about the Tush Push ban during a sports interview

Josh Allen’s comments add more heat to the debate in the 2025 NFL season





The Tush Push play has become one of the most talked-about moves in the NFL. It gained fame through the Philadelphia Eagles, who used it with great success. Other teams, including the Buffalo Bills, have also tried it. Not everyone, however, concurs on whether it should still be in the game. Some coaches believe it is too dangerous. One team even voted to ban it. But now, quarterback Josh Allen has spoken out with a clear opinion—and it might surprise fans of the Buffalo Bills.In a new interview with Sports Illustrated published on June 14, 2025, Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen spoke about the ongoing debate over the Tush Push. The talk happened after the NFL meeting in May 2025, where teams voted on whether to ban the play. The Buffalo Bills voted yes to ban it. Head coach Sean McDermott said it was risky and could lead to injuries.But Josh Allen had a different view. He told Sports Illustrated, “If you can’t stop it, keep running it.” He said that only a few teams, like the Philadelphia Eagles, do the play really well because they practice often and have the right players for it.Josh Allen also added, “Just because some teams do it better doesn’t mean others can’t try.If you don’t like it, my advice is to stop it.” He said he would follow any rule changes, but for now, if it’s allowed, teams should be free to use it.The Buffalo Bills used the Tush Push last season during important games. They tried it in the AFC Championship game against the Kansas City Chiefs. But it didn’t work well then—the Kansas City Chiefs stopped it. That loss may be one reason why coach McDermott supported banning the play this offseason.Still, Josh Allen seems open to using it again in the 2025 season if it stays legal. His words gave fans and experts something to talk about, especially since his coach feels the opposite.For now, the Tush Push remains part of the game, and Josh Allen seems ready to keep pushing forward—literally.Also Read: ""I would absolutely love to"": Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen willing to lead Team USA in 2028 flag football debut","Josh allen breaks silence on controversial tush push after nfl rule talks.

Shaunie Henderson does a cover-up on her family tattoo





Tattoos are personal for most people. Some let a patchwork stay on their body for the rest of their lives, while some evolve and change the designs on their body according to the changes in their lives. And looks like NBA legend Shaquille O'Neal's ex-wife, Shaunie Henderson, belongs to the second group of people, as she was recently seen changing a piece of ink on her body that once meant the world to her. Is it her way of letting the past go or something else? Let's find out.Shaquille O'Neal and Shaunie Henderson got married back in 2002, and share four children - Shareef, Amirah, Shaqir, and Me’arah. Shaq also has a daughter from a previous relationship and adopted Shaunie's son Myles from hers. They had it all, and their love was evident in the way they stood by each other. But like all good things, this came to an end when Shaunie filed for divorce in 2009.Before things took a turn though, Shaq and his wife both got tattoos to commemorate their family. Shaq got the names of his ex-wife Shaunie, and two of their sons—Myles and Shareef, tattooed on his right wrist, and the names of his daughters—Taahirah, Amirah, and Me’Arah, tattooed on his left wrist.Shaunie, too, had a beautiful tattoo on her back - a butterfly sitting on a flower, where the petals had the names of all her children written in them.And while Shaq and Shaunie maintain a very amicable relationship as co-parents, looks like the latter is ready to move on from the past a little bit. She got married to Pastor Keion Henderson in May 2022 and now, recently, was seen doing a cover-up ink on the butterfly tattoo on her back. The previous design is gone, and in its place, there is a vibrant and colorful floral piece.Shaunie is still a very dedicated mother to all her children, which is pretty evident with how much time she spends with them, but what does the cover-up mean? Maybe it's just her way of bringing a new change into something old. After all, a tattoo is not proof of how much she loves all her kids.Also Read: “People will always talk”- NBA legend Shaquille O’Neal speaks out after wild gossip","Shaquille o'neal and ex-wife shaunie henderson got married back in 2002.

Where is Kevin Durant going after leaving the Phoenix Suns

""Durant is on an expiring $54.7 million deal for 2025-26, and the Suns have made clear to six-to-eight seriously interested teams that they will make the best deal for the franchise – even outside of his preferred list of Miami, San Antonio and Houston.""





Kevin Durant has multiple trade options this summer. From the San Antonio Spurs making a buzz to even rumors of the Golden State Warriors knocking at his door, the NBA veteran could go anywhere. But the real question is - Will it be for the right reasons? While it is almost a done deal that he will be leaving the Phoenix Suns during the off-season, where he ends up landing is the main thing everyone wants to know. And with multiple sources saying that quite a few top teams are vying for his talents, the 36-year-old also has other things to consider.From the San Antonio Spurs to the Miami Heat to the Houston Rockets, Kevin Durant is keeping quite a few options at hand as the offseason window inches closer. He will be leaving the Phoenix Suns at the end of it, but where he ends up going is still up in the air. But according to NBA sources, chances of him landing with the Rockets or the Heats are much higher than that of the Spurs, who are also gunning for some top draft options this summer.According to Shams Charania of ESPN, while Durant has made his choices clear, whether his preferred destinations will match with what the Suns are looking for in their perfect business deal is not equated to the same.Durant apparently wanted to make a move to Houston or Miami back in February, and everyone thought that he could be transitioned into a new team, but nothing panned out, and he stayed with the Suns. Where he ends up now, once the off-season window opens, is what fans will be looking to see, as the playoff season inches closer with each day.

Andrew McCutchen exposes MLB’s new baseballs as reason for Aaron Judge ’s power drop





Yankees power hitters like Aaron Judge can be affected





The New York Yankees are going through a rough patch with their recent losing streak. While many fans are pointing fingers at the team’s performance, one baseball veteran has shared something even more surprising. His words are now making headlines. The truth may have less to do with how players are swinging and more to do with what they are swinging at. The problem could be in the baseballs themselves.Former New York Yankees outfielder Andrew McCutchen discussed on June 15, 2025 a major baseball shift few fans were aware of. He made this public in a video interview, saying that an MLB official told him the balls this season are not the same as previously.McCutchen said, “They told me the seams are higher this year. ” Higher ball seams, he said, can slow it down in flight. This implies that the ball does not travel as far when a player hits it as it used to. “Every baseball is hand-sewn; so no ball is same,” he continued.When McCutchen asked the MLB if they could fix the issue during the 2025 season, they said no. The league is still looking into it but won’t make changes right now.This comes at a time when teams like the Yankees depend on strong batters to hit home runs and score runs.Known for their potent hitters Aaron Judge and Giancarlo Stanton, the Yankees are having trouble scoring. Once leading in home runs, the squad is having more difficulty now hitting balls outside the park.Also Read: Aaron Judge And Fans React After DJ LeMahieu Hit Sparks New MLB Outrage Stats from this season show fewer home runs across all MLB teams.

Some believe it’s unfair to teams built around power hitting.If what McCutchen says is true, the Yankees might need to change their game plan. Until the MLB fixes or confirms the issue, teams and fans will be watching closely.","Former new york yankees outfielder andrew mccutchen discussed on june 15, 2025 a major baseball shift few fans were aware of.

Wayne Gretzky is a name synonymous with greatness in the NHL , but the origin of his famous nickname, ""The Great One,"" has a surprising twist. During a recent segment on NHL on TNT’s Face Off, Gretzky shared that his father, Walter Gretzky, was not a fan of the moniker when it first appeared during his youth hockey days.Long before Wayne Gretzky shattered NHL records, he was just a ten-year-old prodigy from Brantford, Ontario, netting an unbelievable 400 goals in a single season. A reporter from the London Free Press came to profile the young phenom. At the conclusion of the article, the journalist proposed a fitting nickname: “The Great One,” drawing inspiration from legends like “Mr. Hockey” and “The Golden Jet.”“They said, ‘We should just call him The Great One,’” Gretzky recalled. “Well, my dad tried to kill that right away — it just kept coming back.”Walter Gretzky believed such a title placed unnecessary pressure on his young son. He didn’t want Wayne to bear the weight of premature hype. But despite his father's objections, the nickname gained traction and became permanently linked to the budding superstar.Over time, the family had no choice but to embrace the label. “Finally, I just was like, ‘Well, we’re going to have to live with it,’” Gretzky admitted.And live with it he did. By the time he retired in 1999, Gretzky had not only fulfilled but exceeded the expectations that came with such a grand title. With 894 goals, 2,857 career points, and 61 NHL records, “The Great One” wasn’t just a nickname—it became his rightful legacy.Switching gears to current NHL action, Gretzky also shared his thoughts on the Edmonton Oilers' Game 5 loss to the Florida Panthers. “Right from the get-go, Florida played a really smart, intelligent road game,” he said, noting that Edmonton looked “cautious” and “on their heels” early on.Also Read: No longer Canadian: Wayne Gretzky’s Canadian identity questioned after Donald Trump friendship sparks controversy From a childhood nickname to a storied NHL career, Gretzky’s story remains one of humility, brilliance, and enduring greatness.","Wayne gretzky's iconic nickname, ""the great one,"" originated from a profile of his youth hockey dominance.

NEW DELHI: Indian fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah revealed he declined the Test captaincy role before Shubman Gill 's appointment, citing workload management concerns for the upcoming five-match England series starting June 20 at Leeds. Despite being vice-captain and a frontrunner to replace Rohit Sharma , who stepped down in May, Bumrah chose to prioritise his bowling responsibilities over leadership duties.The decision came after discussions with the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) during the Indian Premier League regarding his availability for all Test matches.""Before Rohit [Sharma] & Virat [Kohli] retired - During the IPL, I had spoken to BCCI, that I have discussed workload going forward in a five-match Test series, [and that] I have spoken to people who manage my back.

The team envisions him pitching about once every seven days as he continues to juggle his duties on the mound with his responsibilities at the plate.Ohtani's velocity on the mound brought out some oohs and aahs from the crowd and from fans around the world on Friday, as he showed command.His appearance, though brief, was an important step in his rehab process and provided an insight into how the Dodgers intended to utilize his pitching arm without putting him back on the shelf.Shohei Ohtani may not have pitched long, but Ohtani made his impact. But Monday night's game between the Dodgers and Padres turned into the highest-rated game in all of MLB.TV history. Ohtani experienced a 28% growth in day-one sales (relative to the previous record) that highlighted both Ohtani's global popularity as well as the allure of the loaded Dodgers roster.Also Read: Shohei Ohtani touches 100 mph in electric 2025 pitching debut for Dodgers On the offensive end, Ohtani had another great showing. Including a run-scoring double and an RBI single during the Dodgers' 6–3 victory against the Padres, it was the five-run fourth, a late-game barrage, that confirmed the win for the Dodgers, but Ohtani had already provided the early boost to take his team ahead and into the proper momentum.Ohtani is once again making a case for MVP, hitting .290 with 25 bombs and 11 stolen bases. That has the Dodgers' production this season, and they also lost the pump. Hopefully, his return to the mound will help not only the Dodgers but also the excitement in a league over a once-a-generation talent who keeps pushing the envelope of what is possible in baseball.","Shohei ohtani made his long-awaited return to the mound for the los angeles dodgers on monday night. In only one inning of pitching, he reawakened a buzz across all of major league baseball. The game attracted the largest viewership mark in the history of the platform, up 28% on the previous record.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121915841,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1025396,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

As July 1 approaches, Mitch Marner's future with the Toronto Maple Leafs appears to be slipping away. According to NHL insider Elliotte Friedman, the Maple Leafs have made attempts to engage with Marner’s camp, but so far, there has been no traction. The 27-year-old forward is expected to hit free agency without a contract extension, opening the door for rival teams.Among the teams linked to Marner, the Ottawa Senators are the most surprising name. They’re not yet in serious contention, but they have a young core and cap space that could appeal to Marner.

Ottawa’s front office is reportedly preparing a pitch that focuses on a fresh start and leadership opportunities.The Montreal Canadiens and Calgary Flames are also reportedly in the mix, each with their pitch to offer. Montreal offers history, culture, and a massive fan base. Calgary presents a roster that needs a scoring boost, and Marner could be the centerpiece of that change.As Marner’s exit looms, the Leafs are already moving ahead with potential replacements.According to Arthur Staple, Toronto has an interest in New York Rangers forward Mika Zibanejad.

Former India Head Coach Ravi Shastri has revealed his preferred playing XI for India's upcoming first Test match against England at Headingley, starting June 20. The series marks new captain Shubman Gill's first assignment following the Test retirements of Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma, as India faces the world's second-ranked team in challenging conditions during the new World Test Championship cycle.For the opening combination, Shastri advocates for Yashasvi Jaiswal and KL Rahul to take the crease. He emphasized Rahul's experience and previous success in England as crucial factors. ""It would be Jaiswal, and with him will be KL Rahul, because I think this is a big tour for him. He's the most experienced of the batsmen,"" Shastri stated. ""He opened last time when India toured England, got a hundred, and had a good tour. So I would hope for him to open the innings.""Shastri recommended young Sai Sudarshan for the number three position, citing his impressive performances. ""Three, I'll go with the youngster, Sai Sudarshan. Whatever I've seen of him, he's very impressive. This will be good exposure for him, this tour,"" he explained.The newly appointed Test captain Shubman Gill, who has played 32 matches in his red-ball international career, will bat at number four in Shastri's lineup.For the crucial middle-order positions, the former India coach backed Karun Nair at number five and Rishabh Pant at six. He particularly praised Nair's recent performances and determination to return to the national team. ""In all probability, depending on what current form is, it'll be Karun Nair. He bats at five, it's a long time since he played for India. Six will be Pant,"" said the 63-year-old.He further elaborated on Nair's selection, saying, ""I think he has worked really hard. He's just worked his way back into the side. The number of runs he's got in first-last cricket is incredible. And I met him during an IPL game. I said, 'don't just bang the door. Just kick it down and make your way in and walk into that side'. And I think he's done just that. Just the number of runs that he's got has made the selectors look in that direction and give him a place. ""For the bowling combination, Shastri opined that Ravindra Jadeja must come in at number seven as the primary spinner, followed by three fast bowlers and an all-rounder.The former coach faces a tough choice between two fast-bowling all-rounders - Shardul Thakur and Nitish Reddy - for one spot in the team. ""I would go with three fast bowlers, plus Shardul Thakur. I know it'll be a tough one between Shardul and Nitish Reddy, but you have to see who bowls how much. If Reddy is going to give you 12, 14 overs, then he might get the nod because of his batting,"" Shastri explained.For the pace attack, Shastri proposes Mohammed Siraj and Jasprit Bumrah as certainties, with either Prasidh Krishna or Arshdeep Singh as the third option, depending on the conditions. ""And the three fast bowlers would be, I would go with Prasid Krishna, I would go with Mohammed Siraj and of course Jasprit Bumrah. In Leeds, if it's overcast and it's cloudy, there might be the temptation of going with the left-armer Ashdeep Singh as well. So it will be Prasad, Prasid Krishna/Ashdeep but the other two will be Siraj and Bumrah,"" he concluded.","Ravi shastri has revealed his preferred playing xi for india's first test against england at headingley, starting june 20.
