NEW DELHI: Ayush Mhatre delivered a remarkable 94, nearly overshadowing Romario Shepherd's blistering 14-ball fifty, but Royal Challengers Bengaluru secured a thrilling two-run victory against Chennai Super Kings, strengthening their position for IPL playoffs on Saturday.RCB posted an imposing 213 for five, with significant contributions from Virat Kohli (62, 33 balls), Jacob Bethell (55 off 33) and Shepherd (53 not out of 14, 4x4, 6x6), equalling the second-fastest in IPL history. CSK faced an enormous target.Their response was exceptional, led by 17-year-old Mhatre's 94 (48 balls; 9x4, 5x6), ultimately finishing at 211 for five.Mhatre found excellent support in Ravindra Jadeja (77 not out off 45 balls), establishing a substantial 114-run partnership for the third wicket.The young Mumbai batsman initiated the innings by scoring 26 runs off Bhuvneshwar Kumar during the Power Play, maintaining consistent momentum throughout.This victory elevated RCB to the top position with 16 points from 11 matches.Mhatre demonstrated exceptional batting skills acquired through extensive practice at Mumbai's Oval maidan, effectively challenging RCB's bowling unit, which missed Josh Hazlewood due to injury.The selection of Mhatre as Ruturaj Gaikwad's injury replacement, instead of Gujarat's Urvil Patel and Kerala's Salman Nizar, initially raised questions.However, CSK captain Dhoni and coach Stephen Fleming's confidence in Mhatre, following his performance in selection nets, proved justified through his outstanding display.Jadeja, the experienced CSK player who survived dismissals on 57 and 69, provided valuable support and guidance to his young partner throughout the tense encounter.[Remaining paragraphs continue with original quoted text and match details as provided]","Royal challengers bengaluru secured a thrilling two-run victory against chennai super kings.

NEW DELHI: Gujarat Titans continued their dominance over Sunrisers Hyderabad with a comprehensive 38-run win, further consolidating their position in the top half of the IPL 2025 points table .

Despite playing an extra match, their strong net run rate gives them the edge in the standings.Royal Challengers Bengaluru, also with 14 points from 10 matches, are third on the table.

Rajasthan Royals and Sunrisers Hyderabad have both struggled this season, each stuck on 6 points.However, RR have played 11 matches and have been eliminated (E) from the playoff race, while SRH's hopes hang by a thread, suffering their seventh loss and holding a poor NRR of -1.192.Chennai Super Kings are at the bottom, officially eliminated after managing just 2 wins in 10 matches, with the worst net run rate in the tournament (-1.211).","Gujarat titans beat sunrisers hyderabad by 38 runs in ipl 2025.

WWE Backlash added another title bout to the match card

A huge four-way dance has been set in stone for WWE Backlash, where one champion will defend his title against three top competitors.WWE is moving fast towards its next Premium Live Event, Backlash. The event is set to take place on May 10th at the Enterprise Arena in St. Louis, Missouri. The match card has shaped up to be exciting, and on the latest edition of Friday Night SmackDown, a huge fatal four-way match was made official for the show with a championship at stake.On the May 2nd edition of WWE SmackDown, Damian Priest and LA Knight had an exchange of words, with both laying claim to a shot at the WWE United States Championship . This led to a singles match between the two SmackDown stars, who produced a captivating showdown in the process. The match was so exciting that fans erupted in a 'This is Awesome' chant at the very start of the show.However, the bout ended in disqualification after Solo Sikoa interfered. Although he was stopped by both LA Knight and Damian Priest, the current WWE US Champion, Jacob Fatu, appeared and decimated both competitors. Later in the night, Solo and Jacob were in GM Nick Aldis' office. He informed the duo that Jacob Fatu would defend his US title against Damian Priest and LA Knight at WWE Backlash.Solo Sikoa protested and said that it was Drew McIntyre who won the No. 1 contender match by disqualification last week on SmackDown. Aldis agreed, but threw a major curveball at them. He changed the match to a Fatal 4-way, adding McIntyre to the bout.This will be Jacob Fatu's first title defense. The Samoan Werewolf won the star-spangled prize at WrestleMania 41, dethroning LA Knight, which earned him a huge ovation from the audience at the Allegiant Stadium. However, his first title defense has posed a huge threat to his title reign, which has only begun. With competitors like LA Knight, Drew McIntyre, and Damian Priest coming for Fatu's title all at once, it will be interesting to see if he can walk out of WWE Backlash with his title.Also read: WWE SmackDown Results & Highlights (5/2/25): Huge tag team main event, new title match made for Backlash 2025 and more","Wwe is moving fast towards its next premium live event, backlash.

NEW DELHI: Batting stalwart Virat Kohli has continued to redefine excellence in the IPL , reaching yet another historic milestone by becoming the first-ever player to hit 300 sixes for a single franchise.Representing Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) since the inception of the league, Kohli has etched his name even deeper into the tournament's history books.In the match against Chennai Super Kings on Saturday, Kohli smashed 62 runs off just 33 balls, including five fours and five towering sixes, before falling to Sam Curran.The dismissal came from an attempted upper-cut that landed straight into the hands of Khaleel Ahmed at backward point.Despite the soft dismissal, Kohli’s incredible form was once again on full display.This knock also made Kohli the orange cap holder, having scored 505 runs in 11 matches so far this season.With seven 50-plus scores in just 11 innings, his consistency has been unmatched.He now holds the record for most IPL seasons with 500+ runs (8), surpassing David Warner’s seven.Notably, Kohli has equalled his own record for most consecutive 50-plus scores for RCB in a single IPL season — four, a feat he previously achieved in 2016.His recent form includes scores of 62* (today), 51, 70, 73*, 1, and 62* in his last six outings.Adding to his legacy, the batting maestro also became the player with the most 50+ scores against Chennai Super Kings in IPL history — 10, overtaking Dhawan, Warner, and Rohit Sharma, all tied at nine.",Virat kohli becomes the first-ever player to hit 300 sixes for a single franchise.

Alex Smith respects his friendship with Kelce too much to ask for Taylor Swift perks

ESPN’s Alex Smith Talks NFL Draft, Commanders, Mahomes & More with Rich Eisen | Full Interview

No jealousy, just pride in Kelce and Mahomes’ evolution

Former NFL quarterback Alex Smith has nothing but admiration for his longtime friend and ex-teammate Travis Kelce — but when it comes to asking for favors involving Kelce’s high-profile relationship with Taylor Swift, Smith draws a clear boundary. In a recent appearance on The Rich Eisen Show, the former Kansas City Chiefs star shared a candid take on why he's never — and likely will never — ask Kelce for concert tickets to see Swift perform.While Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour continues to break records with over $2 billion in revenue and her global fan base only grows stronger, it's not surprising that her boyfriend, Travis Kelce, has become an unexpected gateway to one of the hottest tickets in entertainment. Still, Smith, who played five seasons with Kelce in Kansas City before the Patrick Mahomes era began, isn’t using their bond for personal gain.“I haven’t hit him up on that,” Smith told Rich Eisen when asked if he’s ever requested concert tickets. “Nor do I ever expect to. He’s got enough people, I’m sure, bringing that up to him.”It wasn’t just a polite deflection — Smith was emphatic in his stance, even after Eisen pointed out that Greg Olsen had confessed to asking. Smith didn’t budge. “Again, these are special relationships. And to go ask for a handout… from his girlfriend? It’s just not my thing.”What stood out most was Smith’s tone — one not of bitterness, but of genuine pride. When the conversation shifted to Kelce’s relationship with quarterback Patrick Mahomes, Smith lit up with respect and admiration.“These guys are like stepbrothers off the field,” Smith said. “They are so incredibly close — they give each other such direct feedback all the time.”He also mentioned their recent business venture together. “I think they just opened a steakhouse,” Smith added, referencing their growing partnership beyond football.Also Read: Are Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce skipping the 2025 Met Gala to avoid the spotlight—or to hide deeper issues in their relationship?

Gujarat Titans aim to recover from the blow dealt by young sensation Vaibhav Suryavanshi when they face a struggling Sunrisers Hyderabad in an IPL match tonight (May 2).Suryavanshi stunned GT with his incredible performance, hitting the season’s fastest century in just 35 balls and becoming the youngest IPL centurion at only 14 years and 32 days old.Despite an eight-wicket loss — post a strong 209/4 score — the result hasn't altered GT's position in the league. The Titans remain one of the most consistent teams this season, boasting a balanced squad with strengths in both batting and bowling.Led by Shubman Gill, they sit comfortably with six wins out of nine matches (12 points). Just two more wins from their last five fixtures would secure a spot in the playoffs, reaching the 16-point threshold.GT's in-form top order gives them confidence, especially with standout Sai Sudharsan, who is second in the Orange Cap race with 456 runs and five fifties. Gill (389 runs) and Jos Buttler (406 runs) also rank among the season’s top batters, making a formidable trio despite recent challenges.Earlier this season, GT defeated SRH convincingly in Hyderabad by seven wickets, thanks largely to Mohammed Siraj's impressive 4/17 spell. They’ll be hoping for a similar performance this time.Meanwhile, SRH find themselves in a critical position, needing wins urgently. The runners-up last season have struggled — just three wins in nine matches — and sit ninth on the points table. Another loss could effectively eliminate their playoff hopes.While SRH have seen flashes of brilliance from openers Abhishek Sharma and Travis Head, consistency remains elusive for the team.The pitch at Narendra Modi Stadium favours the batters, which should benefit SRH. In five of the eight matches played at Motera, teams have scored over 200 runs, highlighting the batting-friendly conditions. Bowlers are likely to struggle, particularly in the second innings, as dew is expected to make an impact.Shubman Gill (C), Sai Sudharsan, Jos Buttler (WK), Sherfane Rutherford, Shahrukh Khan, Washington Sundar, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, Sai Kishore, Mohammed Siraj, Prasidh KrishnaImpact sub: Karim Janat/Ishant SharmaTravis Head, Abhishek Sharma, Ishan Kishan, Nitish Kumar Reddy, Heinrich Klaasen (WK), Aniket Verma, Kamindu Mendis, Pat Cummins (C), Harshal Patel, Simarjeet Singh, Zeeshan AnsariImpact sub: Mohammed ShamiGujarat Titans squad : Shubman Gill (Captain), Jos Buttler (wk), B Sai Sudharsan, Shahrukh Khan, Sherfane Rutherford, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, Kagiso Rabada, Ravisrinivasan Sai Kishore, Mohammad Siraj, Prasidh Krishna, Ishant Sharma, Washington Sundar, Glenn Phillips, Anuj Rawat, Mahipal Lomror, Arshad Khan, Jayant Yadav, Nishant Sindhu, Kulwant Khejroliya, Gerald Coetzee, Manav Suthar, Kumar Kushagra, Gurnoor Brar and Karim Janat.Sunrisers Hyderabad squad : Pat Cummins (c), Ishan Kishan (wk), Atharva Taide, Abhinav Manohar, Aniket Verma, Sachin Baby, Smaran Ravichandran, Heinrich Klaasen (wk), Travis Head, Harshal Patel, Kamindu Mendis, Wiaan Mulder, Abhishek Sharma, Nitish Kumar Reddy, Mohammed Shami, Rahul Chahar, Simarjeet Singh, Zeeshan Ansari, Jaydev Unadkat, Eshan Malinga.In Ahmedabad on Friday, temperatures are expected to be quite hot, reaching up to 44°C during the day.

NEW DELHI: Just days after lighting up the cricket world with a jaw-dropping 35-ball century, 14-year-old Rajasthan Royals prodigy Vaibhav Suryavanshi has once again stunned fans — but this time, not with the bat.The young sensation from Samastipur, Bihar, who smashed 11 sixes in a whirlwind knock at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium in Jaipur, became an overnight star. His innings, against an attack featuring the likes of Ishant Sharma, Mohammed Siraj, Prasidh Krishna, Washington Sundar, Rashid Khan, and Karim Janat, was the second-fastest century in tournament history.Now, ahead of Royals' IPL 2025 clash against Kolkata Knight Riders on Sunday, Suryavanshi turned heads again — but this time during a net session with the ball in hand.In a stunning moment, the teen bowled to a batter in the nets and produced massive turn, shattering the stumps clean in half. Teammates and staff were left in disbelief at the sheer skill and impact of the delivery.From a batting sensation to a potential all-rounder in the making, Suryavanshi’s talent continues to amaze — and he's only 14.RR bowling coach Shane Bond had revealed that the team management is ‘protecting’ the young star.“The coaching staff haven’t tried to complicate things too much with Vaibhav. He’s sort of got a bit of a license to go out and just play, which he’s done an amazing job so far, really, for a 14-year-old. So look again, he missed out in the last game, but for us, you don’t really want to panic with someone so young, you just come out and plug in tomorrow,"" Bond said at the pre-match press conference.“I know Vikram (Rathour) talks about his game plans and the type of bowlers that he’s going to come up against and he’ll do that again for this match, but outside of that, he’s a pretty young kid, so I’m just happy for him to get out there and keep swinging. It’ll be that again,"" he added.“He’s (Vaibhav) obviously a seriously talented player, but he’s also still a kid. So, he’s sort of learning on the go, we’re going to be really patient with him because you have to be. And the other part of it is just all the off-field stuff, the travel (and such), you can’t expect a 14-year-old to be a professional. Like I’ve got a 16-year-old son and he’s a teenager, so we’re just trying to educate him on the things around and look after him, shield him a little bit from the social media stuff and all the trappings that come with the way he started, but he’s a lovely kid,"" Bond said.","14-year-old vaibhav suryavanshi has once again stunned fans. The young sensation from samastipur, bihar, smashed 11 sixes in a whirlwind knock at the sawai mansingh stadium in jaipur. His innings, against an attack featuring the likes of ishant sharma, mohammed siraj, prasidh krishna, washington sundar, rashid khan, and karim janat, was the second-fastest century in tournament history.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120851512,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-45006,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

NEW DELHI: India and Royal Challengers Bengaluru star batter Virat Kohli has finally opened up about his decision to retire from T20 internationals following India’s triumphant T20 World Cup campaign in 2024.Kohli called time on his T20I career after India, led by Rohit Sharma , clinched the T20 World Cup title with a thrilling seven-run win over South Africa in the final held in Barbados.In the high-octane final, Kohli delivered when it mattered the most, scoring a crucial 76 off 59 balls, earning him the Player of the Match award.Moments after lifting the trophy, Kohli announced his retirement from T20Is during the post-match presentation. Soon after, Rohit Sharma and Ravindra Jadeja also confirmed their retirements from the format.Speaking on the RCB Podcast, Kohli explained the reasoning behind his decision.“I do not think things have changed for me in any way. The decision to leave T20Is was taken purely understanding that there is a new set of players who are more than ready and they need time,” he said.“They need a two-year cycle to evolve, handle pressure, play in different parts of the world, and play enough games to the point where when the World Cup comes, they feel like they are ready.”Kohli finished his T20I career with 125 matches, amassing 4,188 runs at an impressive average of 48.69. He was named Player of the Tournament in both the 2014 and 2016 editions of the T20 World Cup.Currently, Kohli is showcasing top form in the ongoing IPL 2025 , leading the charts for RCB with 443 runs in 10 matches at an average of 63.29.RCB, placed second in the points table, are set to face Chennai Super Kings in a key encounter on Saturday.",Virat kohli has announced his retirement from t20 internationals.

Fans reacted to Giannis Antetokounmpo’s confrontation with Tyrese Haliburton’s father

The Indiana Pacers edged out a dramatic 119-118 overtime victory against the Milwaukee Bucks . While Tyrese Haliburton 's game-winning shot over Giannis Antetokounmpo lit up Gainbridge Fieldhouse, the postgame headlines were stolen by a courtside altercation between Giannis and Haliburton's father, John. Fans online are not happy with John’s move, as many are asking the NBA to ban him from the playoffs.Giannis Antetokounmpo was making his way off the court when John Haliburton approached him, waving a towel with his son's face on it and allegedly yelling, “This is what we do.” The bold move did not sit well with the two-time MVP, who interpreted the act as a blatant show of disrespect. Giannis responded, and the two ended up in a tense face-to-face standoff that required players and staff from both benches to intervene.Giannis later addressed the confrontation: “I believe in being humble in victory. That’s who I am,” he said in his postgame comments. “Some people will say when you win the game, you can talk s___ and say it’s a green light for you to be disrespectful. I disagree. I’ve won a championship, they haven’t.”The Bucks star added, “I feel like that’s very, very disrespectful.”Tyrese Haliburton didn’t shy away from the issue either. Addressing the incident in his postgame press conference, he took accountability for his father’s actions. “As far as the incident between Giannis and my pops, I had no idea until I got to the back and was shown the video. I don’t agree with what transpired... I don’t think that my pops was in the right at all there.”Fans online quickly shared their thoughts on the matter. Many demand a ban on John Haliburton from the NBA games as a form of punishment.“Better be banned for the rest of the playoffs for this dumb s*it,” one fan wrote on X.“Father should be banned for rest of playoffs,” another echoed the same.“Father a bad example of sportsmanship,” another wrote.“I’m glad i saw this angle cause Hali dad was deff in the wrong for taunting Giannis after a big loss like that,” another shared.“What a clown,” one fan condemned the action of John.“Why is he seeking out a 7 foot Greek god like that.

Remembering Gianna Bryant: A tribute to her legacy amid defaced murals and tough times



On Thursday, May 1, 2025, Vanessa Bryant marked what would have been her daughter Gianna “Gigi” Bryant’s 19th birthday with a touching Instagram post that resonated far beyond social media. Accompanied by a powerful image of Gigi in her basketball uniform, the post was a raw and emotional tribute from a mother who continues to carry the weight of an unimaginable loss. The moment was made even more emotional as it came just days after a beloved mural of Gigi and her father, Kobe Bryant, was vandalized in Los Angeles.From Los Angeles to global basketball circles, the name Gianna Bryant , known affectionately as “Gigi” and “Mambacita,” still echoes with deep meaning. On Thursday morning, Vanessa Bryant shared a birthday message on Instagram that read, “Happy birthday, Gigi! Mommy loves and misses you more than I could ever express. I love you Gianna. ❤️19 ♉️ 5/1 #Mambacita.” It was a simple yet deeply moving tribute that quickly garnered love and support from fans, athletes, and brands across the sports world.Gigi, the daughter of NBA legend Kobe Bryant , was just 13 when she and her father tragically died in a helicopter crash on January 26, 2020, along with seven others.Nicknamed “Mambacita,” Gigi was seen as the heir to Kobe’s legacy. He even trademarked the name for her in December 2019, recognizing her growing talent and fierce passion for basketball. She embodied the same Mamba Mentality that her father was known for—relentless, fearless, and unapologetically determined with a drive well beyond her age.Over the years, more than 330 murals have popped up across California honoring Kobe and Gigi. But just days before Gigi’s birthday, one of the most beloved murals in L.A., a portrait of the father and daughter, was defaced with black paint. The timing hit hard. It rattled fans and added even more emotional weight to a week that was already tough for Vanessa, who also has a birthday coming up on May 5. Moments like these are a painful reminder that grief doesn’t follow a calendar; it lingers quietly, then roars back without warning, especially on days meant to celebrate.To honor Gigi, Nike released a special edition “Mambacita” Kobe 9 sneaker on May 1, designed in partnership with the Bryant family. Inspired by Gigi’s drive and spirit, the shoe represents her commitment to excellence and her dream to elevate girls’ sports.Through the Mamba & Mambacita Sports Foundation, Vanessa continues to champion those values, investing in youth athletics and pushing for gender equality in sports.Also Read: ‘Kobe' Chant: How a comedic skit sparked a global tradition and a classroom tribute that moved Vanessa Bryant May 1 will always be more than just a date for Vanessa Bryant; it’s a reminder of her daughter’s spirit, her dreams, and the powerful impact she left behind.
