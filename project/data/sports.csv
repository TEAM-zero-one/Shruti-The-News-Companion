After days of unrelenting speculation, Vanessa Bryant took to Instagram Stories on Sunday, June 1, to put the rumors to rest. Her response wasn‚Äôt a press statement or a legal warning, it was a wild meme with a big middle finger to the internet trolls. The meme featured music icon Rihanna floating in water with a snorkel mask on her head, holding a drink, and flipping her middle finger.‚ÄúMe protecting my peace, not pregnant & having fun all summer,‚Äù Vanessa Bryant wrote in the caption on her response to the online trolls who spread her pregnancy rumors about five years after her husband, Kobe Bryant ‚Äôs, untimely and devastating demise.It was clear, clever, and vintage Vanessa who shut down noise without saying a word about the origin of the gossip. No press release needed when you‚Äôve got Rihanna energy with a direct middle finger gesture.The rumors had emerged out of nowhere, with some users pointing to photos allegedly showing a ""baby bump,"" though no timestamps or context were attached to those images. Vanessa hasn't been publicly linked to anyone romantically, and there‚Äôs been zero confirmation from her side‚Äîuntil now.In another Instagram Story later that evening, Vanessa Bryant shared a motivational quote that hinted at how she views the entire situation and what matters to her personally.‚ÄúThe only way to impress me, is by being a good person,‚Äù the quote read. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care what you have, what you wear, where you live, or what you drive.

While she does not care about the rumor mill, her reaction explicitly showed that she is urging privacy.Vanessa Bryant, who shares four daughters with Kobe‚Äî Natalia, Bianka, Capri, and the late Gianna‚Äî has remained devoted to family and philanthropy. Most recently, she shared footage of a joyful family ski trip over the holidays, showing the tight-knit bond she maintains with her children.Natalia Bryant stepped into the fashion world just like her mother, officially joining IMG Models in 2021 at the age of 18. ‚ÄúEver since I can remember, I wanted to model,‚Äù she shared in a statement posted by IMG on Instagram. ‚ÄúThere is a lot to learn, but I feel this is a great opportunity for me to learn and express myself creatively.‚ÄùVanessa and Kobe Bryant tied the knot in April 2001.

They were headed to Kobe‚Äôs Mamba Sports Academy for a youth basketball game when the accident occurred. Kobe was 41 at the time.

His demise created a huge void in the NBA world as fans are still mourning his untimely passing.Since their passing, she‚Äôs kept their memory alive through meaningful business ventures and charitable work. Kobe launched the Mamba Sports Foundation in 2016, aiming to support young athletes. After his death, Vanessa renamed it the Mamba & Mambacita Sports Foundation in honor of both Kobe and Gianna. Today, the foundation helps underserved boys and girls in sports, pushing forward the mission they believed in. It's her way of carrying on their legacy with purpose and heart.Vanessa Bryant‚Äôs response was indeed witty and empowering as she hinted that she deserves privacy and reminded the world that while she may be a public figure, her peace and dignity aren‚Äôt up for debate, especially not over unfounded gossip. After the viral response via memes, Vanessa has seemingly closed the chapter as she did not extend the matter any further with any other comments about it afterwards.Days after shutting down the pregnancy rumor, Vanessa Bryant made a glowing courtside appearance with her daughters at the New York Liberty vs. Chicago Sky game. The WNBA shared a sweet clip showing Vanessa alongside Natalia, 22, Bianka, 8, and Capri, 5, all smiling and waving for the camera.Later, Vanessa uploaded an image of her in a restaurant, candidly posing as she waited for the food to be arrive.

Daniel Cormier reveals that Brock Lesnar is banned from TKO



DANIEL CORMIER SOUNDS OFF on JON JONES, ASPINALL, MMA GURU?! | EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW

Will Brock Lesnar return to WWE?



FAQs

Is Brock Lesnar banned from WWE and professional wrestling?



Why was Brock Lesnar‚Äôs name linked to the Vince McMahon lawsuit?



When did Brock Lesnar last appear on WWE programming?



Brock Lesnar, once the most dominant force in both WWE and UFC, now finds himself in an unthinkable position. He has been sidelined, silent, and reportedly banned from professional wrestling altogether. As per reports, WWE is distancing itself from Lesnar. Additionally, insiders are dropping cryptic but serious comments, which have extended the speculation. Now the question remains, is this the end of The Beast Incarnate‚Äôs career?Daniel Cormier has recently shared up update on Brock Lesnar that put the wrestling world in a frenzy. On The MightyCast with Demetrious Johnson, the former UFC Heavyweight Champion revealed that Brock Lesnar is currently blacklisted from professional wrestling. Though Cormier declined to elaborate, his tone left little room for doubt.‚ÄúBrock is on the banned list right now,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBrock got into so much trouble. You know what Brock did. I ain‚Äôt telling you on air what Brock did. Brock is in so much trouble.‚ÄùThe remarks come amid the fallout from the high-profile lawsuit filed by former WWE employee Janel Grant, who accused Vince McMahon and others of se*ual misconduct and trafficking.Though Lesnar‚Äôs name was initially listed in the documents and later removed, his association with the case has had lasting consequences.In fact, Lesnar hasn't appeared on WWE programming since his loss to Cody Rhodes at SummerSlam 2023. He has been scrubbed from WWE marketing material, future events, and even casual mention by the promotion itself. A source close to the company told multiple outlets that Lesnar is being treated as ""radioactive"" amid ongoing legal uncertainty.While Lesnar has avoided the spotlight, he was recently spotted in public, looking fitter than ever. Fans shared photos of the 46-year-old taking selfies outside a restaurant, his shredded physique sparking whispers of a potential comeback. When asked about returning to WWE, he reportedly offered a vague reply: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll see.‚ÄùStill, without a clear path forward and no statement from either WWE or TKO, Lesnar‚Äôs future remains up in the air. Though Cormier‚Äôs knowledge of WWE‚Äôs internal decisions can be debated, the weight of his comments can‚Äôt be dismissed lightly, especially when paired with the company‚Äôs decision to effectively erase Lesnar from its present and near-future plans.For now, Lesnar‚Äôs focus seems to be on family. While The Beast may be lying low, fans and critics alike are left wondering, has the final bell already tolled for Brock Lesnar? So far, it‚Äôs hard to tell. Still, many fans would want to see The Beast making his WWE return with a surprise, especially as a worthy opponent of John Cena in his retirement tour. But as for the current situation, at least, according to Cormier, it is far-fetched.Also Read: Roman Reigns Confronts Paul Heyman on Raw to Sow Seeds for a Huge Clash at SummerSlam According to Daniel Cormier, Lesnar is on the ""banned list,"" though WWE hasn‚Äôt officially confirmed it.Lesnar was initially named in the lawsuit filed by Janel Grant, who alleged trafficking and misconduct, but his name was later removed.Lesnar hasn‚Äôt been seen on WWE TV since his match against Cody Rhodes at SummerSlam 2023.","Daniel cormier reveals that brock lesnar is banned from tko and professional wrestling.

Incoming Players:

The Cavs Reunite with Their King

The Reaves Factor Would Be A Costly Sacrifice

Is the Trade Feasible?

In a dramatic new trade proposal that‚Äôs making waves across the NBA world, theare predicted to part ways with franchise cornerstoneand rising star Austin Reaves in a blockbuster five-team deal. Originally floated by Bleacher Report‚Äôs Greg Swartz, the deal imagines LeBron James finishing his career where it began ‚Äî in Cleveland ‚Äî while the Lakers reshape their roster around younger, defensive-minded players.The hypothetical deal suggested by Swartz is part of his piece titled ‚Äú3 Trade Packages To Bring LeBron James Home to the Cleveland Cavaliers .‚Äù Of the three scenarios, this one stands out for its complexity and high-profile names.This proposed trade shakes up rosters across five teams and addresses different franchise needs‚Äîfrom Cleveland‚Äôs desire for a LeBron homecoming to Brooklyn‚Äôs aim for long-term picks and depth.If the Los Angeles Lakers were to greenlight this deal, they‚Äôd be giving up not just LeBron James, but also their breakout guard Austin Reaves‚Äîarguably the second and third-best players on the current roster. The return? One All-Star forward and two premium role players.- Lauri Markkanen: Former All-Star forward, averaged 18.2 points and 7.1 rebounds on 37% from three throughout his career.- De‚ÄôAndre Hunter: A two-way forward who was putting up nearly 20 points per game before his move to Cleveland.- Max Strus: Known for his three-and-D prowess, fits perfectly in a modern defensive lineup.‚ÄúLauri Markkanen is a one-time All-Star, has more potential to grow, and is more clearly on the same timeline as Luka Doncic,‚Äù wrote Swartz in his breakdown.While the deal strips the Los Angeles Lakers of LeBron‚Äôs leadership and Reaves‚Äô ascending talent, it compensates with youth, defense, and perimeter shooting‚Äîtraits that align with current trends in team-building.Bringing LeBron James back to Cleveland would be a full-circle moment in NBA history. After winning a title with the Cavaliers in 2016, a return for one last chapter would be an emotional high point for both the player and the franchise. With Austin Reaves and Walker Kessler added to the mix, the Cavs would deepen their rotation while LeBron provides veteran leadership and late-game poise.For Los Angeles Lakers fans, parting ways with Reaves might sting more than moving on from the aging LeBron. Reaves has grown into a reliable scoring option, averaging 20 points per game in just his fourth season.

At 37 years old and with two seasons left on his current deal through 2026-27, Curry is approaching the twilight of his career with perspective and balance‚Äîpreferring to take things ‚Äútwo years at a time‚Äù rather than commit to a fixed retirement date. Stephen Curry‚Äôs comments reflect a mature understanding of the toll the game takes, especially during the offseason. He pointed out that preparing for the season‚Äîrepetitive conditioning, strength training, and daily grind‚Äîhas become more challenging than the 82-game season itself. Yet, he still finds joy in playing. ‚ÄúThe games are the easy part,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the fun part.‚ÄùWhen it comes to retirement, Curry spoke candidly. He noted that some players are ‚Äúforced out,‚Äù while others walk away on their own terms. His hope is to be in the latter group, choosing to leave when his body tells him it‚Äôs time‚Äînot because he can no longer keep up. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to be the one that‚Äôs limping up and down the court trying to keep up with the young bucks,‚Äù Curry added.Despite being one of the NBA‚Äôs oldest active stars, Stephen Curry remains one of its most effective. He averaged 24.5 points, six assists, and 4.4 three-pointers per game last season, earning All-NBA Second Team honors. His production hasn‚Äôt slowed, and the Golden State Warriors are making roster decisions with Curry‚Äôs competitive window in mind, hoping to capitalize on their championship potential while he‚Äôs still playing at a high level.Curry isn‚Äôt just thinking about basketball. Off the court, he‚Äôs laying the groundwork for his next chapter.

He‚Äôs also expressed interest in sports broadcasting and NBA ownership, following the footsteps of former players like Michael Jordan and Carmelo Anthony.Whether he ends up in a broadcast booth or part of a front office, Curry seems intent on remaining a prominent figure in basketball long after his final game.For now, Warriors fans can rest easy: Curry isn‚Äôt planning to retire anytime soon.

Low-Cost, High-Upside Fit for a New Knicks Identity

Theare in the midst of retooling their roster to build a more effective bench unit, and one NBA analyst believes signing former Magic Star, Markelle Fultz, could be a low-risk, high-reward move. With a new era beginning under head coach Mike Brown, the Knicks are aiming to address one of their most glaring weaknesses from last season ‚Äî second-unit production.Despite making the playoffs, the New York Knicks ‚Äô bench unit was statistically one of the worst in the league during the 2024-25 season. They ranked at the bottom in both bench points (21.7 per game) and bench minutes (12.7 per game) ‚Äî far below league averages. With a revamped coaching staff and strategic acquisitions like Jordan Clarkson and Guerschon Yabusele, the franchise is looking for one more piece to solidify its reserve rotation.Former 76ers guard Markelle Fultz, the No. 1 pick in the 2017 NBA Draft, has had a tumultuous career marked by injuries and inconsistent opportunities. Still just 27, Fultz played 21 games for the Sacramento Kings last season, averaging 2.9 points and 1.3 assists in limited action (8.8 minutes per game).While those numbers may seem underwhelming, his more extended stint with the Orlando Magic (2019‚Äì2024) tells a different story.When healthy, Fultz proved he could be a productive contributor off the bench or even in spot starts.His efforts on defense were also quietly impactful. According to The Sporting News, Markelle Fultz posted a 0.7 defensive box plus-minus that year, signaling his value as a two-way presence ‚Äî an area where the New York Knicks desperately need depth, especially behind starting guards like Jalen Brunson Bringing in Markelle Fultz wouldn‚Äôt require a large financial commitment, making the move a classic low-risk, high-reward gamble. He‚Äôs versatile, can play on or off the ball, and has experience bouncing back from adversity ‚Äî qualities that could thrive under Mike Brown‚Äôs system.If healthy, Fultz could provide:- Secondary ball-handling and playmaking- Defensive stability in short spurts- Veteran poise at just 27 years old- Insurance in case of injuries to the starting backcourtDean Simon of The Sporting News writes, ‚ÄúIf the New York Knicks are willing to give the two-way guard a shot at contributing to a team with championship aspirations in spot minutes, a healthy campaign for Markelle Fultz could result in the team completing one of the more underrated signings of the 2025 offseason.‚ÄùAlso read: NBA Analyst's Blockbuster Proposal Lands Warriors $82 Million Former Cavaliers Champion as Kevon Looney‚Äôs Replacement As the New York Knicks aim to build a title-contending squad, adding Markelle Fultz as a depth piece could be a smart bet.

Matthew Tkachuk injury opens door for Panthers‚Äô salary cap workaround

Matthew Tkachuk‚Äôs groin injury could become Panthers‚Äô financial lifeline

FAQs

1. Why are the Panthers considering placing Matthew Tkachuk on LTIR?

2. Is Matthew Tkachuk seriously injured?

3. Could this move be seen as salary cap manipulation?

The Florida Panthers, stepped off another Stanley Cup win, face salary cap challenges. Star forward Matthew Tkachuk's injury could offer a solution. Placing him on long-term injured reserve would create cap relief, though he battled injuries across last season's championship run.Even as the champagne corks settle from their consecutive Stanley Cup triumph, the Florida Panthers' management faces pressing financial decisions. It's the hockey offseason, but for the front office, the work is far from over.A consequential hurdle looms: the team's current payroll surpasses the salary cap by a notable $3.75 million, a figure confirmed by Puck Pedia. This means the Panthers must strategically reduce their financial commitments to align with league regulations.One particularly impactful avenue for achieving cap consent revolves around key forward Matthew Tkachuk, whose contract carries a hefty $9.5 million impact on the team's salary structure. The possibility of his injury playing a role in this decision has been raised.Sportsnet's Nick Kypreos, in his assessment of Florida‚Äôs cap situation, put forth a compelling idea: ‚ÄúIf Tkachuk were to miss the beginning of the season and be out for a while, the Panthers would be able to get under the cap by putting his contract on LTIR.‚ÄùThis maneuver, placing a player on the long-term injured reserve, offers the distinct advantage of allowing a team to briefly exceed the salary cap.Matthew Tkachuk, a true competitor, played through significant injuries during the 2024-25 season, including a torn adductor and hernia sustained at the 4 Nations Face-Off. His dedication was vital to the Panthers' second consecutive Stanley Cup.In the 2025 Final, he bestowed three goals and seven assists. Tkachuk's substantial $9.5 million cap hit is a key factor, with Aleksander Barkov ($10 million), Sam Reinhart ($8.625 million), and Sam Bennett ($8 million, recently signed extension) also having large contracts.The Panthers face a tough offseason dilemma: balancing their championship roster with salary cap constraints, potentially relying on Matthew Tkachuk's injury status to navigate their financial tightrope.Also Read: Brad Marchand‚Äôs disrespectful celebration resurfaces as Panthers clinch Cup ‚Äî Canucks fans furious To create cap relief, as his $9.5M salary could help offset their $3.75M cap overage.Tkachuk has been dealing with lingering groin issues since the 4 Nations Face-Off and the playoffs.Some critics believe using LTIR for Tkachuk‚Äôs injury might be a strategic loophole rather than necessity.","Florida panthers, fresh off their stanley cup win, are facing salary cap challenges and matthew tkachuk's injury might offer a solution.

The insider added that Lively‚Äôs ongoing legal drama with her It Ends With Us co-star Justin Baldoni may have become too toxic for Swift to tolerate. The source claimed Gomez simply wanted ‚Äúlove, light, and platform boots‚Äù ‚Äî not ‚Äúsubpoenas and side-eyes‚Äù ‚Äî at her party.That legal entanglement seems to have chilled what was once a beloved Hollywood friendship.

With the rookie class making their summer league debuts and teams anticipating the upcoming season, the 2025 NBA draft is now complete. According to an anonymous Western Conference scout, Dylan Harper may make De'Aaron Fox expendable to the San Antonio Spurs . He even received six votes when asked which rookie will end up being the best pick in the draft. Dylan Harper, the San Antonio Spurs' third consecutive top-five pick in the NBA Draft over the previous three years, was selected this year.ESPN recently surveyed early thoughts on the draft. Twenty unnamed NBA executives and scouts were polled by ESPN's Jeremy Woo to get their opinions on the incoming rookie class for the 2025‚Äì2026 NBA season. Participants voted on five questions based on their assessments and initial observations from this offseason.The questions included who organizations consider the front-runner for the No. 1 pick in 2026, which players were thought to be possible draft steals, and whether anyone may challenge Cooper Flagg for Rookie of the Year. The panelists shared their opinions.Six votes went to Dylan Harper of San Antonio Spurs, the No. 2 choice, who was considered as De'Aaron Fox expendable.Some people thought the team would be a good destination despite their packed backcourt.The S.A. Spurs, who have been preparing for more playmaking around Victor Wembanyama going ahead, selected Dylan Harper because of his skill at pick-and-roll and his cunning, potent style of play. He appears to be a key long-term player, even if he ends up starting as a rookie.As per ESPN, one Western Conference scout said:""[Harper] has some [Manu] Ginobili to his offensive game... If the 3-point shot ever becomes a true weapon [for him], he makes Fox expendable and gives San Antonio a nice trade asset.""Many believe that the S.A. Spurs' path to being a competitive club has started with Dylan Harper's addition. In fact, one NBA legend advised Victor Wembanyama to change his style of play moving forward.The San Antonio Spurs now have three starting-level guards, none of whom would benefit from a spell off the bench, so they may need to deal with De'Aaron Fox's position.
