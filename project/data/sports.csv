ESPN restricts Jason Kelce from making guest appearance

Why YouTube wanted Jason Kelce for Chiefs opener



The NFL’s 2025 season opener between the Los Angeles Chargers and Kansas City Chiefs is shaping up to be a spectacle — not just on the field but also behind the scenes in the broadcast world. While YouTube secured a Hall of Fame quarterback to headline its exclusive coverage of the Week 1 clash in São Paulo, Brazil, fans hoping to see Jason Kelce join the stream will be left disappointed.According to Ryan Glasspiegel of Front Office Sports, YouTube approached Jason Kelce about appearing on its coverage of the highly anticipated Chargers-Chiefs matchup. The former Philadelphia Eagles center, now a rising media personality, seemed like a natural fit given his strong ties to the Chiefs through his brother, Travis Kelce . However, ESPN reportedly blocked the move.Travis Kelce, who signed a multi-year contract with ESPN last year to serve as an analyst on Monday Night Football, is restricted by a new company policy. The network has decided that on-air talent will no longer be permitted to appear on coverage from competitors such as YouTube or Netflix.Interestingly, this is a shift from last season when ESPN allowed Mina Kimes and Laura Rutledge to take part in Netflix’s Christmas Day doubleheader studio show.But with streaming platforms increasingly entering the live sports space, ESPN appears to be tightening control over its personalities.It’s easy to see why YouTube pursued Jason Kelce. His “New Heights” podcast with brother Travis has exploded in popularity, drawing even bigger attention recently with Taylor Swift ’s appearance. The pop icon’s relationship with Travis Kelce has amplified media buzz, making Jason a hot commodity for any NFL-related broadcast.Also Read: Tom Brady's son Jack ditches stepmom Gisele Bündchen for special outing with his birth mother Bridget Moynahan While Jason Kelce won’t be part of the opener, the Kansas City Chiefs-Los Angles Chargers clash still promises major storylines — from Justin Herbert leading the Chargers’ new-look offense to Patrick Mahomes beginning Kansas City’s title defense. But for fans of the Kelce brothers, it’s clear ESPN’s decision leaves a noticeable gap in YouTube’s coverage.Kelce played college football for the Cincinnati Bearcats and was selected by the Eagles in the sixth round of the 2011 NFL draft. He won Super Bowl LII, was a seven-time Pro Bowl selection, and six-time first-team All-Pro selection. Kelce is often regarded as one of the greatest centers in NFL history.",Youtube approached jason kelce about appearing on its coverage of the highly anticipated chargers-chiefs matchup.

Celebrity families often turn heads when they step out in public, and that was the case at this year’s US Open when actress Bridget Moynahan attended courtside with her son, Jack.

Jordon Hudson makes stylish UNC debut appearance with Randy Moss supporting Bill Belichick on the sidelines



Bill Belichick’s past and present collide as attention intensifies



Bill Belichick stepped onto the college football stage Monday night as the North Carolina Tar Heels faced TCU, but the attention wasn’t solely on the six-time Super Bowl champion coach. Instead, much of the spotlight turned toward his 24-year-old girlfriend, Jordan Hudson, who once again managed to spark conversation before kickoff. For a man known for his iron-clad focus, Belichick’s debut is proving to be as much about life off the field as on it.At 73, Belichick is entering uncharted territory with his move from the NFL to college football, yet his presence has already elevated UNC’s visibility. Alumni royalty like Lawrence Taylor and Michael Jordan were expected in the stands, while Hall of Famer Randy Moss stood beside Hudson on the sidelines in a casual UNC fit. Moss, of course, shared the field with Belichick during his Patriots era from 2007 to 2010, a reminder of the legacy the coach brings to Chapel Hill.But even as Belichick begins charting a new chapter, narratives about his personal life follow closely.Hudson, a former Miss Maine contestant who once finished third in the pageant, first grabbed headlines when HBO’s Hard Knocks exposed antics that cost the university $200,000. Clips of her and Belichick engaging in playful acrobatics on the beach have only added to the chatter. Their 49-year age difference has kept tabloids buzzing, and sightings of Belichick sneaking out shirtless from Hudson’s Airbnb haven’t quieted the noise.If Hudson draws headlines now, Belichick’s former partner, Linda Holliday, isn’t far from the narrative either. Just days before UNC’s showdown with TCU, Holliday was seen on a Martha’s Vineyard boat trip, decked in Tar Heel blue and white. At 62, she has kept a relatively low profile since the split but seemed to channel the same school spirit that now surrounds Belichick’s new journey.For all the off-field drama, the real intrigue lies in how Belichick adapts to the college game. His track record with the Patriots remains untouchable, but UNC presents a new challenge — one where recruiting, development, and NCAA politics replace draft boards and free agency. Whether his debut season will be remembered for football achievements or the noise surrounding his personal life is a storyline that will unfold week by week.Also Read: “PLAY THIS AT THE WEDDING”: Travis Kelce’s past confession about Katy Perry sparks awkward moment for Taylor Swift fans","Bill belichick made his college football debut as north carolina faced tcu.

A painful night that tested Colorado’s spirit

Coach Prime’s calm words steady shaken emotions

Shedeur’s private rallying cry to his father

Regrouping together to answer the season’s challenge

The Colorado Buffaloes’ opening night against Georgia Tech ended in a narrow 27–20 defeat, but the loss carried a weight that went far beyond the scoreboard. In the aftermath, it wasn’t just Coach Prime’s words at the podium that mattered. It was a seven-word family message from his son, Cleveland Browns quarterback Shedeur Sanders, that underscored the family’s bond and demand for accountability.Colorado’s defense forced three first-quarter turnovers but failed to convert them into momentum. The Buffaloes finished with just one offensive touchdown, while Georgia Tech’s Haynes King gashed them for 156 rushing yards. In total, Colorado gave up 320 rushing yards—numbers that highlight a recurring weakness from last season. The result left fans and analysts questioning whether the Buffaloes can rise above the same flaws that haunted them in 2024.Deion Sanders took the setback in stride, choosing to focus on positives rather than panic. “I’m optimistic on everything. We’re definitely gonna be fine. We could’ve won that game. It’s not like we got our butts kicked,” he said afterward. His tone echoed the resilience he has preached since Colorado’s rebuild began, but behind closed doors, his son delivered a sterner call.Now an NFL rookie in Cleveland, Shedeur has transitioned from son to leader. Hours after the game, he typed a pointed reminder in the family’s group chat: “As SANDERS MEN we have to regroup.” The message symbolized a deeper expectation—that the Sanders legacy is measured not by setbacks, but by how swiftly they respond to them.For the Sanders family, football is a proving ground of character. Shilo continues to fight for his NFL shot, while Shedeur grows into his professional role. Next up for Colorado is Nebraska, a chance to turn frustration into fuel. Whether that private message becomes a turning point will depend on how the Buffaloes answer their own quarterback’s rallying cry.Shedeur's words remind Deion that family always wins, showing that even in defeat, love, resilience, and unwavering support can lift spirits, inspire growth, and keep the Sanders legacy strong and united.Also read: Chicago Bears fifth-round rookie Zah Frazier will sit out 2025 season after personal issue emerges","The colorado buffaloes lost 27–20 to georgia tech in their opening game of the season.

Micah Parsons consoles young Cowboys fan after emotional reaction



Micah Parsons embraces pressure with Packers’ record contract



When the Dallas Cowboys stunned the NFL world by trading Micah Parsons to the Green Bay Packers, emotions ran high. Fans felt betrayed, pundits questioned Jerry Jones’ move, and a viral clip of a young supporter crying captured that heartbreak. Yet, what stood out was Parsons’ heartfelt response—FaceTiming the child, offering encouragement, and promising a Packers jersey with his iconic No. 1. In that moment, Parsons showed the human side of a blockbuster trade.The trade didn’t just impact analysts and fantasy football rosters—it hit fans on a deeply personal level. One viral TikTok video captured the raw emotion of a young Cowboys fan, filmed by his mother Lesley, breaking down in tears after learning Parsons had been dealt away. What followed turned into one of the most heartwarming moments of the offseason.Parsons himself saw the clip, reached out, and later FaceTimed the devastated child. His words were both empathetic and motivational: “I saw that video, I’m sorry, bruh. I hope you know, in life, things happen that you can’t control, but you just got to keep going.”The four-time Pro Bowler didn’t stop there. He promised the boy a brand-new Packers jersey with his No.1 on it. “Even though you’re a big Cowboys fan, I hope that you still follow me and my career, because that’s what it’s all about. Passionate fans. That just meant a lot to me. I hope you know that.” He even playfully reminded the youngster to focus on school, joking that bad grades might cost him the jersey.For the fan, it was a tough lesson in the business side of sports, but also a reminder that heroes can be human too.The Cowboys received a haul—two future first-round picks and defensive tackle Kenny Clark—in exchange for Parsons. Meanwhile, Green Bay wasted no time, signing him to a four-year, $188 million extension, making him the highest-paid non-quarterback in league history.At his Green Bay introduction, Parsons admitted the reality of the deal hadn’t fully sunk in. “I didn’t think I would be traded,” he said. “But that’s the harsh reality.” Still, he embraced the pressure, noting: “I’d be a fool to not think that there isn’t expectations… But then again, that’s a blessing in itself, that means that they believe in me that much.”Parsons’ first test comes quickly: a month from now, he’ll return to Dallas in a Packers uniform, staring down the very fans who once cheered his every sack.Also Read: Patrick Mahomes teases Travis Kelce with geography joke ahead of Chiefs’ season opener in Brazil","Micah parsons was traded by the dallas cowboys to the green bay packers.

Tyreek Hill left off Dolphins’ captain list amid rising doubts



The Miami Dolphins may soon face one of the biggest decisions of the season — whether to part ways with their superstar wide receiver, Tyreek Hill. On ESPN’s Get Up this week, NFL insider Dan Graziano hinted that Hill’s name could surface in trade talks if Miami stumbles early. With the regular season just around the corner, questions surrounding Hill’s role and future with the franchise are louder than ever.Graziano didn’t mince words when discussing Miami’s outlook. “If they fall out of it, he’ll be a name we’re talking about in October, you know, at the trade deadline, I think,” he said. While noting that the Dolphins plan to move forward with Hill, Graziano emphasized that a midseason slide could force Miami to reconsider.Former NFL offensive lineman Damien Woody painted an even bleaker picture. Highlighting the exodus of key leaders, Woody said: “Four of their captains from last year are no longer on the team. Right. Jalen Ramsey, gone. The quarterback and star wide receiver they’re not in the greatest of places. There is bad mojo in Miami right now. That’s just the way I look at it.”The Dolphins indeed lost significant locker-room voices in Calais Campbell, Terron Armstead, and David Long Jr.Without that leadership core, doubts remain about whether this team can stay competitive in the AFC.Fueling speculation further, Miami recently announced its 2025 team captains — and Hill’s name was absent. For the first time in three seasons, the star wideout won’t be wearing the captain’s “C.” Instead, Tua Tagovailoa, Aaron Brewer, and Alec Ingold will lead the offense, while Jordyn Brooks, Zach Sieler, and Bradley Chubb captain the defense.This omission, paired with Hill’s offseason trade chatter and his walk-back from “I’m out” comments last year, underscores the uncertainty hanging over his future. While he remains on the roster for now, his long-term place in Miami seems fragile.As the Dolphins prepare for kickoff, the spotlight is firmly on Hill. If the team falters early, the trade deadline could reshape both his career and Miami’s trajectory. For now, fans can only wait and watch whether Tyreek Hill remains the centerpiece of the Dolphins’ offense or becomes the most sought-after trade chip of the season.Also Read: Micah Parsons FaceTimes heartbroken Cowboys fan after trade, promises he will still make him proud in Green Bay","Tyreek hill’s dolphins future in doubt as nfl insider suggests trade talks could resurface near deadline.

The September 1 edition of Monday Night RAW will see the aftermath of the spectacular show that was Clash in Paris. Only a day after the August 31st show, WWE is back in the same place at the Paris La Défense Arena in Nanterre, France for RAW with their top stars. Dominik Mysterio is gearing up to retain his Intercontinental Championship against AJ Styles , the KAbuki Warriors will face Roxanne Perez and Raquel Rodrigues from The Judgment Day and stars like CM Punk, Becky Lynch Seth Rollins , Iyo Sky, and Rhea Ripley are set to make appearances throughout the night.The night started with Jey Uso making his way into the ring. He starts by saying that while he is hurt, he will not take it lightly when someone puts their hand on his family. He calls out The Vision crew, who put his cousin Roman Reigns in the hospital after a brutal beating. But instead of Seth Rollins, Bronson Reed, and Bron Breakker - it's LA Knight who comes in. And he goes after Uso right away, saying the only reason Rollins is still the World Heavyweight Champion is because of Uso and him trying to cross Punk and Knight instead of going after Seth Rollins like they had in mind.Before their back and forth can continue, in comes Bron Breakker and Bronson Reed. Knight tells them to go back where they came from, but Breakker is not going to listen to any of that. The latter reminds everyone that they were the ones to put Roman Reigns in the hospital, and even though the crowd kept chanting The OTC's name, and booed Reed and Breakker, they ended the segment by challenging Uso and Knight for a match, which they accepted.In a backstage bit, we see Iyo Sky meet up with The Kabuki Warriors. Sky asks Asuka if they are mad at her, but Asuka laughs, refusing, saying they are family. Sky also says she is done with Rhea and tries to tell them something, but Asuka says they don't have much time, and have to leave for their match, and leaves, followed by Kairi Sane.Raquel Rodriguez and Roxanne Perez from The Judgment Day stable make their way to the stage to fight against The Kabuki Warriors in a tag team match. The previous WWE Women's Tag Team Champions come face-to-face against Asuka and Kairi Sane, and it's Asuka and Perez who start off the first fight of the night. After a cheap shot at Asuka, Perez rolls off the stage to tag in Rodriguez.The match continues with the Kabuki Warriors taking turns overpowering Perez, but it's not that easy to do the same with Rodriguez. Sane gets a lot of hits mostly courtesy of Rodriguez and a little of Perez. But all that for naught, Sane does a off the top diving elbow to the floor on Perez, and after an Empress Impact, an Asula Lock on Perez leads to her tapping out of the fight.Then a surprise announcement is made - Adam Pearce cuts a promo to reveal that Stephanie Vaquer will face Iyo Sky for the currently vacant WWE Women’s World Championship title.The next segment starts with two more Judgment Day members - Finn Balor, accompanied by JD McDonagh. The World Tag Team champions make their way to the ringside, where Balor is set to match up against Dragon Lee. The latter goes in right away with a wristlock, but Balor soon counters with a big shoulder block. As the match progresses, Lee looks to be in control of the game.Fans see Dragon Lee jump off the top with a crossbody for two. Balor gets hung up in the corner, stuck in the ropes, and in the meantime, Lee manages to take care of JD McDonagh, who tried to run interference, with a diving Frankensteiner off the apron. But Balor recovers, showing off immense core strength, and with a Coup de Grace, manages to take the win against Lee.In a backstage segment, we see Nikki Bella come to greet Iyo Sky, where the former says that while Stephanie was her girl, she also really likes Iyo. But before they can continue, Asuka, followed by Kairi Sane, interrupts them, forcing Nikki to back out. Asuka then tells Iyo that she will help her against Vaquer but Iyo says she can do it on her own. That is when Asuka reminds her that she did not win at SummerSlam, and Iyo looks embarrassed.On the other side, we see Dominik Mysterio come up to Finn Balor and JD McDonagh, asking for their help during his upcoming match against AJ Styles. But Adam Pearce has other plans, he came in right at that moment to say that both Balor and McDonagh are ejected from the building after that fight against Dragon Lee. Mysterio tries to object, but Pearce says that if Dom really is the greatest champion, like he says he is, then he should have no problem having no backup during his fight against Styles.The Six-Man Tag Team match is between Grayson Waller and The New Day who face off against Penta and The War Raiders. Waller makes his way onto the stage alongside Kofi Kingston and Xavier Woods. Woods and Penta start the fight, and Penta gains control immediately. Waller, followed by Kingston, runs in, trying to take Penta down, but they get passed outside, and Erik and Ivar are there to take them out.Penta then asks the War Raiders to gather their opponents and comes off the top with a plancha to take out everybody. The New Day has a few moments to shine, but the night belongs to Penta, Erik, and Ivar. The match continues for a while longer, before a flip piledriver from Penta takes out Woods to give Penta and The War Raiders their win.In the next backstage segment, we see Rhea Ripley getting asked about the upcoming fight between Iyo Sky and Stephanie Vaquer. She said that she respects both wrestlers but has her eye on the prize, and will soon get herself a shot at the title. The Kabuki Warriors roll in just when Ripley gets asked about them. When Mami brings up her friendship with Iyo, Asuke tells her they are not friends and that Ripley should stay away.The Eradicator is not playing and tells Asuka to stop pushing, who counters by saying that she has been making history for fifteen years and will push if she wants to. Ripley's “try me” is met with a ""No one is ready for Asuka, even you,"" from Asuka. All this while, Kairi Sane stands in the middle, looking like she wants to disappear.In another bit, Roxanne Perez and Raquel Rodriguez go to meet Adam Pearce, asking why they don't have a title match. Pearce tells them to go away when Lyra Valkyria walks in. Perez says she should go be with her friend - Bayley, who gets mad about them bringing her up.Pearce finally makes Perez and Rodriguez leave before telling Valkyria that he talked to Bayley, and she sounded good, even if she said some weird things. He would tell her more, but that's all he has for now. Valkyria then asks Pearce for a match against either of the Judgment Day members, and he gives it to her, making her leave his office.The next segment begins with AJ Styles making his way into the ring for his fight against Dominik Mysterio for the WWE Intercontinental Championship. Styles gets one of the loudest cheers from the crowd, and they go on for a long while. But Mysterio boots Styles while he was distracted by the crowd cheering for him. The referee checks on Styles and the match officially starts.Dropkick from Styles followed by a plancha elbow from Mysterio. Halfway through, AJ Styles powerbombs Mysterio onto the announcer's desk. He then goes again with a pumphandle gutbuster for two, which Dom counters with the Mullet-O-Matic. Styles snaps off a brainbuster and heads to the apron, but El Grande Americano trips him up, leading to Mysterio dragging himself up to the turnbuckle for a Frog Splash to take him down.In the next segment, we see LA Knight talking about his upcoming fight, where he is supposed to team up against Jeu Uso. Uso also comes in and says that he will fight with everything today, as The Vision crew put his cousin, Roman Reigns, in the hospital. The scene changes to CM Punk and Rhea Ripley chatting, when Adam Pearce comes in to tell Punk that Seth Rollins, whom Punk has been waiting for since the show started, is already in the building. Punk then goes in to handle it.CM Punk is in the ring and calls out Seth Rollins - man to man. Buy it's a different man he gets, as Becky Lynch comes in to face him. The two of them cut a spectacular promo, both selling the rivalry between CM Punk and Seth Rollins with everything they had. Rollins makes an appearance for a few minutes and tells Punk that if he has something to tell him, he should come over and say it to his face.But Becky blocks his path, when CM tries to go past her towards Rollins. The World Heavyweight Champion laughs and walks away, and that's when hell breaks loose as Lynch starts hitting and slapping Punk all over, and he just stands there and takes it. The fans are loud, cheering on a specific name, but Lynch won't stop. Punk finally says that he is going to make Seth Rollins regret ever cashing in on him, and she’s gonna regret putting hands on him. Is this his way of hinting at what the fans have been hoping for all this time? Fingers crossed, it's a couple that takes on Rollins and Lynch.Bron Breakker & Bronson Reed will face off against unlikely tag team partners - Jey Uso & LA Knight, in a brutal tag team match. The Vision crew takes control early on in the match, overwhelming Uso, and it is a while before he gets to tag Knight in. Bronson goes for a backsplash on Knight while Breakker runs interference. He then suplexes Knight, who tried to tag in Uso, and instead Reed gets the tag.Knight dives on Reed, but he puts him hard into the ringpost! They try to take Reed out with a spear after throwing him off the ring. Jey Uso then goes up top for a diving splash, but unfortunately, Breakker follows with a spear on Jey and they have the win.But the night is not over yet, as Breakker and Reed try to take Uso out like they did with Roman Reigns at Clash in Paris. They also get a 747 Splash on Jey, but Knight saves him. Unfortunately, this ends in Reed throwing Knight over to the French announcer's desk. Breakker then hits Uso with another spear, followed by a 747 Splash. And while they had more planned for Jey, his twin runs in with a steel chair to ward off Reed and Breakker to end the show.","The september 1 edition of monday night raw will see the aftermath of the spectacular show that was clash in paris.

Bill Belichick leads Tar Heels into new era



Celebrities flock to Belichick’s UNC debut



Bill Belichick’s long-awaited entry into the college football world finally arrived under the bright lights of Chapel Hill. On Monday night, the legendary NFL coach, known for his no-nonsense gray hoodie and unmatched resume with the New England Patriots, walked the sidelines for the first time as head coach of the North Carolina Tar Heels. And in true Belichick fashion, the debut began with precision, energy, and a touch of history.The Tar Heels wasted no time setting the tone against TCU. Their opening drive spanned 83 yards and ended with Caleb Hood powering into the end zone from eight yards out. That early spark symbolized what many UNC fans are hoping Belichick can deliver — discipline, execution, and results. His defense immediately backed it up, forcing a quick punt from the Horned Frogs.Belichick, at 73, hardly looked like a coach easing into retirement. Instead, he roamed Kenan Memorial Stadium with intent, locking in on his players during warmups and even sharing handshakes with officials and ACC commissioner Jim Phillips. For a man who has stood on the biggest stages in sports, including six Super Bowl wins, there was an undeniable sense that this moment still carried weight.UNC’s gamble to bring in a coach of Belichick’s stature is about more than football.It’s a cultural statement for a university long defined by basketball glory. By handing the reins to one of the greatest strategists in NFL history, the school is signaling its determination to elevate its football program to national relevance.The scene in Chapel Hill went beyond X’s and O’s. The debut carried the aura of a spectacle, attracting some of the biggest names ever connected to North Carolina sports. NBA legend Michael Jordan, who won his 1982 NCAA title under Dean Smith, was in attendance. NFL Hall of Famer Lawrence Taylor, who once played under Belichick with the New York Giants, also made his way to the stands. They were joined by former Tar Heels coach Roy Williams, U.S. soccer icon Mia Hamm, Julius Peppers, and even country star Eric Church.Belichick’s girlfriend, Jordon Hudson, drew plenty of attention too. She was spotted alongside NFL great Randy Moss, watching history unfold from a box seat.The hoodie, symbolic of an entire era in New England, is now draped in Carolina blue. For Belichick, this debut wasn’t just about nostalgia — it was about proving that his methods can succeed in a different arena. His NFL rings won’t guarantee wins here. From this point forward, Belichick must earn every victory the college way, and Tar Heel nation is eager to see where this new chapter leads.Also Read: Bill Belichick’s 24-year-old girlfriend Jordon Hudson rocks Tar Heel blue alongside Randy Moss at UNC debut game","Bill belichick makes college coaching debut at north carolina.

Connor McDavid contract extension talks raise pressure on Edmonton Oilers roster and future

Connor McDavid’s contract status with the Edmonton Oilers remains unresolved as the 2025–26 NHL season approaches. TSN’s Ryan Rishaug reported thatnoting that the possibility of McDavid beginning the season without an extension isat the end of last year. The uncertainty leaves Oilers fans anxiously awaiting a decision.According to TSN’s Ryan Rishaug, no final decision has been made regarding McDavid’s future with the Oilers. While speculation has increased in recent weeks, Rishaug said,He added that while starting the season without a new deal is a very real possibility, the window is narrowing, and the lack of clarity is creating unease among fans and analysts alike.The uncertainty also means that every road trip and media scrum will be dominated by questions about McDavid’s future. With the Oilers chasing a Stanley Cup, the risk of this distraction growing into a season-long storyline looms large.If McDavid remains unsigned as the season progresses, the Oilers face a difficult balancing act. A prolonged slump or losing streak could intensify pressure to consider trading their franchise player, something nearly unthinkable for a team aiming to contend.On the other hand, allowing McDavid to walk as a free agent would be one of the biggest losses in modern NHL history.Rishaug emphasized that while panic is premature, the Oilers’ front office cannot ignore the implications. McDavid’s decision to delay may simply reflect patience, but the organization must prepare for all scenarios. For Edmonton’s fans, the longer talks drag on, the more anxiety will grow around the possibility of losing their captain.Connor McDavid’s future with the Edmonton Oilers remains uncertain, with his agent Judd Moldaver and TSN’s Ryan Rishaug confirming that no decision has been made.

He admitted he was “pissed” at his son for attacking Skyo Stu, saying Raja Jackson knows better and should have gone to the police instead of fighting in the ring. Rampage said, “Yes my son took things too far, and I’m pissed at him for being a POS and the way he handled it!”But the MMA star also placed blame on Syko Stu. According to Rampage, Skyo Stu was drunk and hit Raja Jackson over the head with a real beer can during a livestream before the fight even began.Quinton Rampage Jackson said this attack is what pushed Raja Jackson to step into the ring and retaliate. “If Syko Stu wasn’t drunk and wouldn’t have hit my son with a real beer can, then Knox wouldn’t have felt like they had to let Raja get his ‘get back’ in the ring,” Rampage explained.Quinton Rampage Jackson made it clear that Raja Jackson will face consequences for going too far, especially for repeatedly hitting Stu after he was already on the ground.Still, Rampage Jackson said people are ignoring how the incident started and are unfairly painting Raja Jackson as someone who attacked a veteran with PTSD for no reason.Also Read: Former Tennis Star Anna Kournikova Pregnant At 44 Expecting Fourth Child With Enrique Iglesias After Health Scare He ended his message by telling fans, “Keep your damn hands to yourself.

Fans struggle to accept Micah Parsons in green and gold

Locker room concerns add another layer to the storyline

When blockbuster trades happen in the NFL , it often takes fans time to adjust. That’s exactly what is unfolding with Micah Parsons, who is now suiting up in Green Bay after his shocking departure from the Dallas Cowboys. Just days after the trade, the four-time Pro Bowl linebacker was spotted in Packers colors for the first time, and reactions online have been nothing short of explosive.Micah Parsons’ practice session with the Packers sparked an immediate storm on social media. Many fans couldn’t wrap their heads around seeing one of Dallas’ biggest defensive stars in a completely different uniform. One fan bluntly wrote, “Looks trash in green and gold have fun.” Another admitted, “I still can’t believe this happened.”Others even questioned the timing of his recovery from a back issue that sidelined him throughout training camp. “Ahhh so his injuries are just magically healed now I wonder how that happened?” one user joked, pointing to the linebacker’s mobility in practice.Despite the skepticism, Green Bay supporters are optimistic his presence could elevate the defense into true Super Bowl contention—especially as the team prepares to face the Detroit Lions in Week One.While Cowboys fans are reeling, new reports suggest Dallas may not be entirely heartbroken. According to Sports Illustrated’s Albert Breer, Parsons wasn’t always a favorite in the Cowboys’ locker room. Some teammates reportedly viewed him as “egotistical and self-centered,” while his podcast, The Edge, allegedly created tension all the way up to quarterback Dak Prescott.His desire to make big plays also drew criticism, with some linking it to Dallas’ struggles against the run last season. Still, the Packers clearly see him as a difference-maker.Also Read: Micah Parsons FaceTimes heartbroken Cowboys fan after trade, promises he will still make him proud in Green Bay Parsons’ debut at Lambeau Field on September 7 against the Lions will be the true test—not just of his health, but of how quickly fans can accept this stunning new chapter.",Micah parsons' practice session with the packers sparked an immediate storm on social media.

The 2016 interview that had Travis Kelce making a surprising choice

Fans react with humor as destiny takes a different turn

When it comes to celebrity romances, unexpected throwbacks often grab the spotlight. A resurfaced interview clip from 2016 has fans buzzing after Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce was caught choosing Katy Perry over his now-fiancée Taylor Swift during a playful game of “Kiss, Marry, Kill.” Nearly a decade later, the irony of his choice is not lost on Swifties, given that Kelce and Swift are now planning their future together.The clip, originally from AfterBuzz TV, put Kelce in a lighthearted yet tricky position. He was asked to choose between three global icons: Ariana Grande, Katy Perry, and Taylor Swift. At the time, Kelce admitted the game was “messed up” and hesitated to make his picks. Eventually, he landed on his final choices: “Kill Ariana, unfortunately. ‘Love you, but you’re gone.’ Taylor to kiss and… what was the last one? Katy Perry would be to marry. ”The response drew laughs back then, but its reappearance in 2025—just days after Kelce’s engagement to Swift—has sparked a wave of amusement and commentary across social media.While the remark was made almost ten years ago, fans couldn’t resist poking fun at the irony. One user joked, “PLAY THIS AT THE WEDDING,” while another pointed out that Kelce “knew he wanted to kiss Taylor for sure but didn’t even remember the third option.”Others framed it as a sign of destiny, noting that even in a joking game, Kelce naturally gravitated toward Swift, albeit in the kiss category. Today, that “kiss” has blossomed into a full-fledged romance, culminating in their August 26 engagement in Lee’s Summit, Missouri.Also Read: “She's stepping away”: Taylor Swift may revoke godmother role to Blake Lively’s kids following her engagement to Travis Kelce What was once a throwaway answer in a playful interview has now become a viral reminder of how unpredictable life—and love—can be.","Travis kelce was asked to choose between ariana grande, katy perry, and taylor swift in a playful game of ""kiss, marry, kill"" nearly a decade later, the irony of his choice is not lost on swifties, given that kelce and swift are planning their future together.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123644274,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-null,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Team Canada makes bold statement on age and talent at orientation camp

Connor Bedard and Macklin Celebrini bring skill, hardware, and hunger to the Olympic mix

The countdown to the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milan-Cortina is already fueling excitement, and Team Canada has made one thing clear: youth is no barrier. Connor Bedard and Macklin Celebrini, both former No. 1 NHL Draft picks, are not just tagging along for experience—they are legitimately fighting for roster spots.Team Canada GM Doug Armstrong set the tone at orientation camp in Calgary, where Bedard and Celebrini joined 43 of the nation’s best NHL players. “There is no age limit, or you don't have to be a certain age to make this team. If you're good enough and you can help this team compete to win, then you'll make this team,” Armstrong said.This approach throws the door wide open for the 19-year-old Bedard and 18-year-old Celebrini. Neither participated in the 4 Nations Face-Off earlier this year, but skating alongside legends like Sidney Crosby and Drew Doughty has created the perfect stage for them to prove they belong.Bedard, drafted first overall by the Chicago Blackhawks in 2023, wasted no time making his mark, winning the Calder Trophy in 2024 after leading all rookies with 22 goals and 61 points.Celebrini, who went first overall to the San Jose Sharks in 2024, wasn’t far behind—posting 25 goals and 63 points in his own rookie season.Head coach Jon Cooper emphasized that their presence is no publicity stunt. “We didn’t bring guys here because they were young. We brought them here because they deserve to be here and it’s good for them.”Both players have already donned the Maple Leaf at the World Juniors and World Championships, but the Olympics represent the ultimate test. As Armstrong put it: “They’re at this event not to gain experience. It’s to make the team.”Also Read: “There was a death threat”: Mitch Marner reveals threats and security fears during final months with Toronto Maple Leafs",Connor bedard and macklin celebrini are both former no. 1 nhl draft picks.
