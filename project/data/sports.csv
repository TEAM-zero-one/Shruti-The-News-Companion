Magic Johnson praises Jeanie Buss and Mark Walter in heartfelt reaction to record-setting Lakers sale



The Los Angeles Lakers legend Magic Johnson could not hide his feelings after a bombshell report that the franchise was being sold. In a stunning move that has redefined sports business history, the Los Angeles Lakers— one of the NBA's most valuable franchises— has been sold for a record-breaking $10 billion. Jeanie Buss and her family agreed to sell their 66% majority stake to billionaire Mark Walter, CEO of TWG Global and Guggenheim Partners. The transaction, first reported by ESPN’s Shams Charania, makes it the largest sale of a professional sports franchise ever, surpassing the Boston Celtics' $6.1 billion mark earlier this year.Magic Johnson, the face of the Los Angeles Lakers' greatness and a longtime close friend of Jeanie Buss, had no hesitation in applauding her decision and the legacy she now leaves behind. Taking to X, Johnson poured out a series of personal and public reflections.“Job well done to my sister Jeanie Buss for striking an incredible deal and picking the right person to carry on the @Lakers legacy and tradition of winning - Mark Walter, my business partner and friend! Mark Walter is the best choice and will be the best caretaker of the Laker brand. The proof is in the pudding on what he’s been able to accomplish with the LA Dodgers.Mark has been nothing short of a winner notching 2 World Series and 11 NL West divisional titles in the last 12 years!” Johnson wrote.Mark Walter, already a minority stakeholder in the Lakers since 2021, also owns the Los Angeles Dodgers, the WNBA’s Sparks, and interests in Chelsea FC and a Formula 1 team. His entry into majority ownership, as confirmed to CNBC, is viewed not just as a business move but as a strategic continuation of LA's winning culture.“Laker fans should be ecstatic. A few things I can tell you about Mark – he is driven by winning, excellence, and doing everything the right way. AND he will put in the resources needed to win! I can understand why Jeanie sold the team to Mark Walter because they are just alike – they are competitive people, have big hearts, love to give back, and both prefer to be behind the scenes. This makes all the sense in the world. I am so so SO happy and excited for @Lakers fans all over the world!!” Johnson added.The sale marks the end of a 46-year legacy that began when Dr. Jerry Buss purchased the Lakers for $67.5 million in 1979. Under the Buss family's leadership, the franchise flourished, capturing 11 NBA championships and becoming a global brand. Jeanie Buss, who took over as governor in 2013 following her father’s passing, will retain her position and a minority share post-sale.“Just like I thought, when the Celtics sold for $6B, I knew the Lakers were worth $10B!” Johnson stated, referencing the Celtics’ March 2025 sale to private equity executive Bill Chisholm.Despite the mammoth valuation, the Lakers’ home—Crypto.com Arena—is not included in the deal, which makes the sheer franchise value even more staggering.“I know that my sister Jeanie would have only considered selling the Lakers organization to someone she knows and trusts would carry on the Buss legacy, started by her father Dr. Buss. Now she can comfortably pass the baton to Mark Walter, with whom she has a real friendship and can trust. She’s witnessed him build a winning team with the Dodgers and knows that Mark will do right by the Lakers team, organization, and fans! Both are extremely intelligent, visionaries, great leaders, and have positively impacted the greater Los Angeles community! I love both my sister @JeanieBuss and my business partner Mark Walter,” Johnson shared in another post.The sale, which still requires formal league approval, is expected to close within months. For Johnson, the emotion was palpable when he spoke directly to Jeanie.“I just talked to my sister Jeanie Buss to tell her congratulations, and that I’m so happy for her and family. I told her that her dad Dr. Buss would be very proud of her for getting $10B for the Lakers, the largest sports franchise sale in history!” he wrote.Also Read: Los Angeles Lakers $10 Billion Sale Shatters Sports Franchise Records; Buss Family Makes NBA History The Lakers, with 17 NBA championships and a global fanbase, are entering a new era.

Brad Marchand’s misspelled tattoo goes viral again

In the world of hockey, few celebrations are as wild or as talked about as Brad Marchand’s after the 2011 Stanley Cup win. The Boston Bruins forward did not hold back. But what’s making noise again in 2025 isn’t just the party—it’s what came with it. From a massive bar bill to a tattoo gone wrong, Marchand’s choices continue to spark laughs and surprise across social media.Brad Marchand and the Boston Bruins won the Stanley Cup on June 15, 2011, after beating the Vancouver Canucks in Game 7. To celebrate, they went to the Las Vegas Strip. At XS Nightclub in the MGM Grand, they partied all night. A bill from that night showed they spent $156,679.74. Most of the money went on very expensive champagne bottles and luxury drinks.Recently, in June 2025, the photos of the bill circulated social media again, causing a stir. People were surprised at how much was spent in a single night. Many hockey fans on reddit joked about how one party night could equal a year’s salary for others.Some even called it “the most expensive hangover in NHL history.” Bruins fans shared mixed reactions, with many still proud of that victory, while others found the spending “over the top.”Along with the wild party, Brad Marchand also got a tattoo to remember the win, but it had a mistake. The tattoo was meant to say “Stanley Cup Champions.” Instead, it read “Stanley Cup Champians.” The spelling error went viral in 2011 and has now returned to the spotlight in 2025 as fans post old photos again.Also Read: NHL Trade News: Brad Marchand's Departure Sparks Emotional Storm As Boston Bruins Fan Makes Shocking Weather Discovery Social media users shared the image widely, and it started trending after a new sports meme account posted it with the caption, “Still the most Boston thing ever.” Bruins fans have joked about it, but some admit the error still stings. One fan wrote, “We waited 39 years for the Cup and got ‘Champians’ forever.”Even Marchand himself once joked about it during an interview in 2016, saying, “I didn’t even notice it for days.” He has never gotten the tattoo fixed, which only adds to its fame.","Brad marchand and the boston bruins won the stanley cup on june 15, 2011.

What is the controversial “ring culture” comment by LeBron James?

If you’re an NBA fan, then two legends — LeBron James and Michael Jordan are who you should be well versed with. They have been pretty excellent at creating history. But, what could possibly be admiration, may soon turn into a rivalry — only to answer one question — who is the bigger GOAT in the NBA — Is it LeBron James or Michael Jordan?Having debates over “ring culture” could be seen as an uplifting move for fans, and other NBA players, but for one of the best NBA stars, LeBron James, it is pretty frustrating, as he feels, he doesn’t understand why. LeBron James said, he doesn’t understand why ‘ring culture’ is always brought up when it comes to him. He feels such conversations always end up being taken in a different context rather that how much effort an individual player is putting in their game. LeBron insists that ""winning a title is a collective effort.“Are you seriously telling me that these guys weren't incredible just because they didn't win?"" That they're left out of conversations about other greats? It's bizarre,"" he said.Craig Carton, who hosts Breakfast Ball, feels LeBron James has been talking about NBA legend Michael Jordan, indirectly, as he brings up “championship rings” in debates. During the podcast, Carton said, ""He makes it so easy for me, He's an insufferable narcissist. Great player. For my money, a top-10 player of all-time, for sure. You can debate where you want to put him. He's not No. 1. But it's so clear to me — I can't prove this, it's just my take on it — of how Michael Jordan lives rent-free in his head.Michael Jordan has been able to secure at least six championships in his entire career. Meanwhile, LeBron James secured four championships. Carton believes, when LeBron brings up “championship rings” stating they don’t matter, is due to the particular context.In an interview with the Today Show's Willie Geist, LeBron was confident enough to pick himself out of the two. LeBron said ""Oh, I take myself. I will take myself for sure. I'm going to take myself versus anybody, They're going to have to have a few wheelchairs and a couple of ambulances there to get us off the floor.""During a promotional event in Hong Kong, NBA legend, Shaquille O'Neal was asked regarding the same LeBron and Jordan debate, he said via ESPN, ""It would be an interesting game, Young LeBron was more like Magic Johnson. He was sort of like Magic with Jordan's abilities. He liked to pass, and he liked to get it up. But Mike was Mike. He was just special—like no one else. He always did things no one else could do and things you couldn't compare to anyone else. So, he was special, and he'd win.""Also Read: “A ring is a team accomplishment”- LeBron James goes down memory lane with the ring culture in NBA on Mind the Game","“michael jordan lives rent free in his head” - craig carton criticizes lebron james' ‘ring culture’ comment.

Evander Kane did not show up for the traditional handshake after losing Game 6 to the Panthers



Fans instantly called him out, with many calling it “classless” and “disrespectful”



“I get it, emotions are high,but hell definitely regret that if not already. Ita the single greatest tradition in playoff hockey and what separates the NHL from other sports”

When the Oilers watched the Panthers celebrate their first-ever Stanley Cup win, the pain was real. But as hockey tradition goes, you line up, shake hands, and show respect, win or lose. Except one name was missing. Evander Kane never showed up for the post-game handshake line after Edmonton’s crushing 5–1 Game 6 loss and fans instantly noticed. Cue the backlash.It’s one of the most sacred things in hockey: no matter how heated the battle, players meet at center ice after a playoff series to shake hands. But after Game 6 of the Stanley Cup Final, as Florida players lined up to shake hands with the defeated Oilers, Evander Kane was nowhere to be seen.Kane was handed a 10-minute misconduct late in the third period after slashing Matthew Tkachuk. By the time the game ended and handshakes began, Kane had already left the bench and did not return.The moment didn’t go unnoticed. Viewers on social media lit up the timeline, accusing Kane of being a “sore loser” and showing “zero sportsmanship.”One comment read: “Lifetime regret added on top of never winning the cup.”Another X (Twitter) user wrote:Criticism came fast, especially since the post-game handshake is considered one of the most respectful rituals in pro sports. And with this being the Stanley Cup Final, emotions were at an all-time high.Not everyone was ready to drag Kane for it. A few fans online pointed out that a 10-minute misconduct means a player technically isn’t allowed to come back on the ice, even after the game ends.Still, others argued he could have found a way to show respect whether it was on the ice, or even a public acknowledgement after.Kane isn’t exactly a neutral figure in the hockey world. His past controversies including past suspensions and off-ice drama make moments like this one feel even more intense. For many fans, this felt like just another example of Evander Kane doing Evander Kane things.Also read - Trade watch: Penguins could trade $30M winger Bryan Rust after career season, per insider","Evander kane did not show up for the traditional handshake after losing game 6 to the panthers.

The Bigger Picture: Lakers’ Offseason Strategy

Theentered the 2025 season with high expectations after acquiring Luka Dončić to pair with LeBron James . However, their early playoff exit against the Minnesota Timberwolves exposed glaring roster flaws. Now, the front office is eyeing upgrades, and a surprising target has emerged: former Boston Celtics defensive stalwart Marcus Smart.According to Bovada, the Los Angeles Lakers hold the second-best odds (+200) to land Smart, trailing only the Sacramento Kings (+150). With Washington likely moving on from the veteran guard, Los Angeles sees an opportunity to bolster its defense and add championship experience.Despite limited playing time over the past two seasons (just 54 total games), Marcus Smart remains a proven difference-maker. His resume includes:- 2019-20 NBA All-Defensive First Team- 2021-22 Defensive Player of the Year- Key contributor to Boston’s 2022 Finals runThe Los Angeles Lakers struggled defensively last season, ranking 18th in defensive rating. Smart’s ability to guard multiple positions and disrupt opposing offenses would immediately address this weakness.As Matt John of Athlon Sports noted in the original report: ""Smart is a former Defensive Player of the Year who helped the Celtics make multiple extensive playoff runs, including a run to the NBA Finals in 2022.""While Los Angeles is a strong suitor, other teams are also in the mix:The Kings’ slightly better odds stem from their need for backcourt defense, but the Lakers’ championship pedigree could sway Smart’s decision.Washington isn’t expected to demand a hefty return for Smart, given their rebuild. The Lakers could offer:- A future second-round pick- A young prospect (e.g., Jalen Hood-Schifino)- Salary filler (e.g., Taurean Prince)This low-risk move would allow LA to retain flexibility for bigger trades while adding a proven playoff performer.Marcus Smart isn’t the only piece the Lakers need, but he fits their timeline. Here’s why:1. Defensive Upgrade – Smart’s tenacity would complement the offensive firepower of James and Dončić 2. Leadership – His experience in high-pressure games would benefit a roster with title aspirations.3. Cost-Effective – Unlike blockbuster trades, acquiring Smart wouldn’t gut the Lakers’ assets.Marcus Smart's interest from the Los Angeles Lakers suggests a practical approach to roster construction. He won't fix every issue they have, but his playoff experience and defensive prowess make him a prime target. Los Angeles' pursuit of another championship may benefit from this move if they can outmaneuver Sacramento.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Los Angeles Lakers Might Sign $100 Million Brooklyn Nets superstar; Backups In Store Too?

Game 6 could boost Shai Gilgeous‑Alexander into a legendary Finals pantheon

Shai Gilgeous‑Alexander has already delivered a Finals performance for the ages—but something even bigger is on the horizon. Game 6 is more than a must-win; it’s a make-history kind of night. He’s chasing something few players ever touch, and while no one knows exactly how it will unfold, one thing’s certain: the numbers, the pressure, and the moment are all aligning for something unforgettable.As the Thunder get ready to hit the court again, everyone's watching their MVP guard. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander came into this Finals with an average of 32.4 points, 5.0 assists, 4.6 rebounds, 2.4 steals, and 1.8 blocks per game. No player has matched that kind of stat line in Finals history over five games since the 1973–74 season. With those impressive numbers already grabbing attention, the pressure for Game 6 is immense: breaking century-old records, securing a championship, and etching his name among the greats.Shai Gilgeous‑Alexander currently holds the fifth spot in the all-time career Finals PPG list at 32.4, trailing behind Rick Barry (36.3), Allen Iverson (35.6), Giannis Antetokounmpo (35.2), and Michael Jordan (33.6).If he has a monster Game 6—think 52 points—it won’t just bring a championship to Oklahoma City; it will also make him the highest-scoring guard in Finals history. Additionally, it would break the Game 6 single-game scoring record (currently 50 by Bob Pettit and Giannis) and add another remarkable achievement to an already stunning Finals résumé.This year's MVP has been a force since Day 1. He topped the league with 32.7 PPG while shooting 51.9%, contributed 6.4 assists and 5 rebounds, and led the Thunder to an impressive 68-14 record. In the Western Conference Finals, he put up an average of 31.4 PPG, 8.2 APG, and 5.2 RPG, earning him the WCF Finals MVP title. Now, he's just two wins away from solidifying a legacy that starts with MVP accolades but could peak with a championship and record-breaking performance.Also Read: Caitlin Clark walked back into the game and what followed shocked everyone Game 6 isn’t just another occasion—it’s potentially the climax of a phenomenal year for Shai Gilgeous-Alexander.

Fans suggest Milwaukee Bucks rebuild team strategy

Basketball season has been getting very heated lately, with teams deciding on which player to keep and which player not to. As it gets interesting, the team Milwaukee Bucks has been a pretty strong contender since 2018, who also managed to secure an NBA title in 2021. But currently, the team has been struggling. They also had to make an exit during the playoffs at least three times, which hasn’t worked in their favor. Fans are frustrated with the entire fiasco. They have not appreciated how the Milwaukee Bucks aren't taking the entire issue seriously, and how Giannis is the one carrying the entire team on his own.NBA star Giannis Antetokounmpo remains a loyal face, but now, with the Milwaukee Bucks almost struggling and having been on a turning point, the situation is very different. The team has to decide now, whether they will rebuild the entire strategy, or try working around Giannis, despite facing issues pertaining to a limited draft pick and salary cap that the players will have to manage with. Some fans took to X, where they shared their opinions on the same issue. While a few of them believe Milwaukee Bucks needs to rebuild itself, and have urged the team to trade Giannis, now, that his value is important, other fans remain divided as they question whether or not Bucks has that much in their assets to push for more expensive players.A fan said, “Giannis looking like a one-man army out there! Bucks better find him some help quick, or he might just carry the whole team to the trade block himself!”While another fan reacted, saying, “Just trade the man. Soon as they traded Jrue and Middleton got old and they didn't have a replacement for him, the Bucks were over with.”Another fan believed, “Milwaukee is cooked, need to trade Giannis while they still can and get some value to start the rebuild.”Another fan reacted, saying, “I doubt there's anything the Bucks can do to keep him in Milwaukee. Imagine the haul they can get for him, though.”A fan claimed, “The Bucks are in a really tough spot. They can aggressively talk all they want, they however just don't have anything worth enough value for any championship level leap.”Another fan suggested, “Bucks should try to sign Schröder, Grimes and Aldama, bring back Gary Trent Jr and KPJ. Then salary dump Connaughton for a second round pick and trade Kuzma for anything. Not a contender but it would be far better than last year.”Also Read: ""I Would Never Give Up"" - Complete Giannis Antetokounmpo's Journey From Pauper To Multi-Millionaire NBA Champion It will be interesting to see how the situation turns out for the Milwaukee Bucks, now that NBA teams are working on rebuilding strategies with newer players.","Fans enraged over bucks’ downfall as trade talks over nba star giannis antetokounmpo continue.

""I believe the best quarterback right now is Josh Allen,""

""I think he's become the guy. For years, it was Patrick Mahomes... The start of Mahomes's career was absolutely mind blowing. The last couple of years though, he's not been that guy, and really, it's been Josh Allen.""

""Allen's combination of freak show 'wow' plays, like everything he can do with his arm, the cheat code that is his short yardage ability, his athleticism. The fact that he basically does not take sacks, one of the lowest pressure-to-sack rates you're going to find anywhere. Utterly absurd analytics numbers behind him as well. I think Allen's the guy right now,""

Patrick Mahomes still dominates in the postseason but Josh Allen has closed the gap in overall performance

Josh Allen’s improvements in efficiency and decision-making stand out in league-wide comparisons

Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen is coming off the most complete and efficient season of his NFL career. In 2024, he threw and ran his way to over 40 total touchdowns for the fifth consecutive year, becoming the first player in league history to do so. He also led the Buffalo Bills to a 13-4 record and the AFC Championship Game, all while operating without Stefon Diggs for the first time in years.Allen was named the 2024 NFL Most Valuable Player, solidifying his place among the league’s elite. The Buffalo Bills led the NFL in sack percentage (2.69 percent), and Allen’s 5.13 touchdowns-per-turnover ratio was the highest of any quarterback in the league last season.NFL analyst Sam Monson, known for his work with Pro Football Focus and now, shared his updated quarterback rankings on thepodcast. He made one of the boldest claims of the offseason.Monson said.According to Monson, Josh Allen's rise isn’t just about flashy plays. It is backed by analytics, decision-making under pressure, and performance consistency over the last two seasons.he added.The Kansas City Chiefs continue to hold the edge in head-to-head postseason meetings. Patrick Mahomes is 4-0 against Josh Allen in the playoffs, including a 30-27 win over the Buffalo Bills in the 2025 AFC Championship Game. That was the first time the Kansas City Chiefs reached 30 points in a game all season.Despite the loss, Josh Allen was once again effective, producing multiple touchdowns while avoiding major errors. Across four playoff games against the Kansas City Chiefs, Allen has 11 total touchdowns and only one turnover.In the regular season, the Buffalo Bills have won four consecutive matchups against the Kansas City Chiefs, with Josh Allen outperforming Patrick Mahomes statistically in each of those games.The biggest shift in Josh Allen’s 2024 campaign came in the turnover department. After years of criticism for his high-risk play style, Allen reduced his turnovers to just six in the entire season.The Buffalo Bills quarterback continued to extend plays and push the ball downfield, but this time, he paired it with smarter decisions. He finished the season with the best sack avoidance rate in the NFL and one of the most efficient red zone performances of any quarterback.No other NFL quarterback has reached 40 total touchdowns for more than three consecutive seasons.

You were doing commentary during the last India-England Test series, in India. It was again a very high-pressure series for Shubman who was in desperate need for runs. But he responded in emphatic fashion in that series and then gave a good account of his leadership for Gujarat Titans in the IPL - not an ideal start in his first season as captain but led the side well in the 2025 edition. Anything that stood out for you?

Will he be okay as a Test batter in English conditions too?

You just mentioned how it's difficult to leave on length in England. I interviewed former England captain Graham Gooch who said it has been a very dry summer. You reckon that will have a say on the pitches which will be dished out for the series? How much will overhead conditions affect that?

Good wickets would give some breathing space to this inexperienced Indian batting line-up? By inexperienced I mean players who haven't played a lot in this part of the world. So will these pitches be better than the green carpets which have been rolled out for Team India in the past?

I think England start as slight favourites. But I think it's going to be a crackerjack of a series Nick Knight

Over 200 First Class games. 40 Test hundreds... You definitely know more than a thing or two about batting in these conditions. But I will slightly take you towards the bowling bit because you touched upon England's bowling composition. What are your thoughts on India bowlers? And the situation which they could face somewhere in the series where Jasprit Bumrah will have to sit out to manage his workload. Will it have a big impact?

Shubman Gill returns to the city where it all started for him as a youngster

The last time you were doing commentary for an India-England series,

Ravichandran Ashwin

was still giving it a rip. Rohit Sharma was scoring a 100. Virat Kohli was part of the Test setup, but he was on a paternity leave due to the birth of his second child. Now, cut to present 2025, three stalwarts are gone from the setup. How do you see that from the standpoint of the series being built up? What kind of hype are you seeing?

'Cricketers Aren’t Cattle... ': Harish Thawani on the IPL and Business of Indian Cricket

Ahead of the first India-England Test in Leeds from June 20, TimesofIndia.com spoke to former England batter Nick Knight who explained why there is a lot of intrigue attached to the series in absence of stalwarts Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma and R Ashwin. The former cricketer further explained what Shubman Gill needs to do to find success as a batter in this part of the world, ideal bowling combinations, the likely conditions and a lot more. Edited Excerpts:Well, you're absolutely right. Obviously, now with no Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli, there's a kind of different feel, different look to the side. I think it's hugely exciting. I think if just on that point, I think if ever a time where in recent past where India would cope with the loss of two such players, I think it's now. I'm very lucky. I work a lot in India and I get to see some of these young kids that are coming through.And boy, can they play and how exciting that they are. And when you transition from being sort of young, developing talent into international cricketer of note, you look at the developmental stage of where you're at. And some of these guys, Sai Sudharsan for me, is ready to play international cricket now.I mean, international Test match cricket. Some of these guys now, they're ready to move on. So I think the timing is good and I think it's going to be a fantastic series. Do I think England start as slight favourites, by the way? Yes, I do.I do. I think England start as slight favourites. But I think it's going to be a crackerjack of a series. Absolutely. You know, exciting brand of cricket.I mean, there are such expectations and probably more so in your great country and with cricket. And what you expect of your players and the level that you expect them to play day in, day out. Realistically, you're absolutely right. You know, he's learning the trade and it's going to be a tough tour for him. But the one thing I would say with Shubman is I think he'll be fine tactically. I think he'll be fine leading the side. I think he'll be fine as a captain. The one area which none of us know the answer to really. We'll all have our opinions on it. But none of us really know how he's going to cope with the expectation he puts on himself and dealing with his own time. Dealing with his own batting.Giving himself time to be the high class player he is. When you're captain of a side, all of a sudden you have not quite so much time to prepare for yourself. And a lot of his batting skills and his batting will have been because he's had time to think about himself. Develop his own game. Understand his own game. Go into the test match knowing exactly how he's going to play.All of a sudden he's got 10 or 11 other guys that he's got to worry about. That'll be a great challenge for him, I think. Can he kind of, with the help of the coach, can he kind of section off and still have time to concern himself with his own game? And how that's going to look in the most important moments. I don't know the answer to that. I'm not sure he does right now. But he'll find that out as he goes along in this test match series.I think that's going to be pretty crucial because every side, and England will do it. You can bet your bottom dollar, England will do it. No side is more vulnerable than when its captain is feeling a little under pressure and vulnerable. That has a huge impact on the whole dressing room, right? So England will target Shubman Gill. England will try and knock him over. England will try and make him feel uncomfortable.Because they'll feel that that might have a knock-on effect with those around him. So it's a huge series for Shugman Gill. Who, by the way, I am a huge fan of. And have been for a long, long time. I remember seeing Shubman at 18, 19 in an Under-19 World Cup in New Zealand. And I went, wow, this boy can play.The thing about test match cricket, and I've been lucky enough to play it over the years, the thing is that all the stuff you just mentioned there, it tests you. It tests your resilience. It tests your ability to come back. It's not all going to be plain sailing. There are going to be moments where you question yourself. There are going to be moments where everyone questions you.There are going to be moments where you go away and say, how can I do that better? And these are sort of natural thought processes that you go in. And your reference to Shubman there, he would have gone through that endless times and will do so more in the future. It's how you bounce back from that.I think his game is in good enough order to do that regularly. The one thing, technically, you want to just make sure that his front foot doesn't come too far across a little bit sometimes, so that he's playing at balls outside or stump. He doesn't have to. But that will be a major area, I think, where England will. And that's the same with every top order player. But I think someone like Shubman, they'll look at that.In England, the thing with England and being in the top order in English conditions, you can't leave the ball on length. When you play in the Southern Hemisphere, the likes of Australia, South Africa, you can leave that ball on length because the ball's going to be going over the stumps. Here in the UK, it's a little bit more tricky to do that.You can do it sometimes, but often you can't. And so you end up getting drawn into that ball on that off-stump line because you're not sure if it's going to go over the stumps or hit the top of off-stump. And that is where you have to be really, really in tune, your head on that top of off-stump line, nice and still, so your judgment is really good.I think that's where England will look to move it back in, a little bit to Shubman Gill as well, to try and hit those pads. So he's going to be tested technically, absolutely for sure. Is he up to it? Absolutely.Big, big tick. But it's that ability to be able to focus on his game, as well as being the pressures of all that goes with being an Indian Test match captain. I wish him well. I think he's the right man for the job, by the way. I really do. I know there are a number of other options. I think he's the right man for the job. And deep down, obviously, I hope England win the series. But I really hope Shubman Gill has a series to remember.Yeah, I mean, absolutely. The thing I'd add to that is, I mean, you know, Goochy (Gooch) played some great innings at Headingley. He knows conditions there for that first Test match. I mean, I've got a Test match 100 at Headingley. There's a bit of a myth there that Headingley is a green seamer that goes all over the place, that seamers just hit a length and it goes left, it goes right. It is a little bit of a myth. And that's your point that I'm going to lead to, is the weather conditions in the UK at the moment are very good. And I think it's set fair.I mean, I'm down south here in the UK, but I think up north in Headingley, I think it's still pretty set fair. So if that's the case, the pitch is going to be pretty good. I mean, I think we'll have good surfaces. However, you know, then there's still not southern hemisphere bounce. It's not like playing in Australia where you can see a length and you can lead. There are pitches in the UK where you can do that, oval perhaps more so than others.And there are pitches, but it's not quite so commonplace. And therefore, as a batter, when you go out there, you're more lining up your head-on-off stump and you're more lining up which to play and which to lead based on the fact that it's not going to go over the stumps unless it's really short. So there are just little things there that you have to be aware of when you're playing and trying to set yourself up to be successful in the UK. KL Rahul . I'll go there. KL Rahul did it quite brilliantly at Member of the Lord's last time round. I was there. I was working on that Test. I remember sitting around that amazing media centre and watching KL Rahul leave the ball quite brilliantly outside off stump.And that really, if you're looking at any area as to why he was successful on that day, in its simplest form, it was that.Yeah. I mean, we're making an assumption that we're going to have good wickets. I mean, I think that would be the case. I don't think England would want anything else but good wickets. I mean, the way they play the game, they're going to want the surface. So, if we're to assume that that's the case, absolutely. Yeah. I mean, the other point that I would allude to on the basis of what you've just said is that they've got two or three warm-up games. I mean, these things like warm-up games, it's almost irrelevant in the world game now.Touring is not – these things don't generally happen as much as they used to. So, you know, KL Rahul got 100 opening the batting in the last game. He's got a half century. You know, Jaiswal hasn't scored big runs. I think he's got a half century. But he's been out there in the middle, in a competitive environment.He's starting to formulate his ideas. He's starting to formulate plans of how he might go about his batting. Now, all these things have got relevance come, Headingley, June the 20th.So, I think you're right. I think if it's a good pitch – I mean, it's looking, obviously, slightly more inexperienced there with India's top order. They want a good pitch. Absolutely. They also – that English bowling line-up is looking a whole lot different to what it might have looked like. Let's be honest. You know, no Joffrey Archer. No Mark Wood . No Gus Atkinson. No Ollie Stone. You know, there are four pacers there. Three or four of them might have found themselves in a front-line 11.So, things are looking a little different for India's top order than perhaps they might have done. Yeah. Now, quite naturally, the conversation has evolved a lot around the batters because no one better to speak to you than you.I mean, there is no better bowler in the world right now. There is no more impactful bowler in the world. He (Bumrah) can change a game just like that. So, clearly, the obvious answer is yes. I think where you have to go with that is just try and work out what that bowling line-up is going to look like with and without him. Now, for me, I have got quite strong views on this. We all know how England want to play. They are aggressive.They will take you on. They are much more refined, by the way, than I think they were a couple of years ago with this whole approach. They will also sit in. I think they will be quite respectful of Bumrah when he comes on. I don't think they are going to try and pelt him back over his head for 4 and 6 every ball. So, I think they will be a bit more refined.They are more refined. So, really, what the question mark for India's bowling line-up is how can they take wickets regularly? How can they knock England back? Because that is the only way they are going to stop them from scoring quickly. They bat deep. They bat big. They bat strong. So, for me, I think they have got to be really clever here how they line up as a bowling unit.There is obviously going to be a temptation to play one of Nitish and Shardul. One is slightly stronger with the bat. One is slightly stronger with the ball. That is fine. But for me, whatever you do with your bowling line-up, it has to have an aggressive intent. It has to be thinking wickets. Don't worry too much about the runs. The runs are going to come against you anyway. So, I am not against Arshdeep playing, by the way. Because I just like the variation. I like the left armer. I like the fact that when you look at England, they keep going at bowlers.They keep going strong. What does Arshdeep do as a living, day in, day out? He tries to absorb batters coming at him in T20 cricket. He has got a good bowling craft, for me. He has got a good ability to outthink and think about what the batters are doing. I like that. I think that might hold true here in this series. So, I think he is an option. Prasidh Krishna , another one. Tall, bouncy bowler.There might be conditions where he might be pretty useful. So, Siraj and Bumrah is a given. I think England, I think India have got to play sometimes four frontline bowlers. It might be that they have to attack, attack, attack with four frontline bowlers.The danger sometimes with sides when you play in England is that you go, do you know what, we will try and lengthen that batting line up a little bit. We will play someone who is good at seven and eight and who might give us a bit of both. I think with this side against England, you have got to attack at all costs. So, go with your most likely wicket tapers with the ball. And if that means slightly extending your tail a little bit, then I am afraid that is going to have to be. Last point on this, Kuldeep.I think Kuldeep is a major player. I really do think he is a major player. I think he is a major player. And if this weather stays like this, for me, then take out one of your seamers, maybe play three and play Jadeja and Kuldeep. Because Kuldeep for me holds so much of a key against England. I think he is one of the bowlers. Bumrah obviously the other. I think Kuldeep would be another. England find it hard.If Kuldeep bowls well, England will find it hard to attack him. They want to attack. If they are not quite sure which way the ball is turning, Harry Brook and the like, they are going to find that whole lot harder than a seamer who is just bowling it up and down. I think Kuldeep plays a major role here. Yeah.Yeah, I think it's a good question. And I think the best answer I can give is there's a lot of intrigue. There's a lot of interest because some of the names are slightly different. And it's like, how is this group going to do? Because I can tell you back in the UK, there was a huge amount of interest in the IPL. I mean, huge amount of following, interest. And the guys that follow cricket in this country follow the IPL in many ways.And so they know these guys. They know Shubham and Gill inside out. They know Sai Sudharsan. They've seen them play in this great tournament. And so their question is the same as, I guess, many. It's like, well, how are they going to go in a Test Match series in England when they've not really played that much, some of these guys? You know, they're fresh behind the ears.They've not played that much Test Match cricket. There's no Kohli. So there's an intrigue level, I think, about just how this young Indian side, inexperienced Indian side in many ways is going to go. There's a slightly different feel about it. I think that's the best way I can describe it. But huge amount of interest, huge amount of just wanting to see how this is all going to play out. I mean, it is one of the great series. It really is. I hope the weather conditions stay fit and fine and well so that we can get a lot of cricket.Because the word I use, the catchphrase I use, as well as others, is entertainment. We're going to be provided with a huge amount of entertainment here. It's going to be jam-packed with entertainment. If India, just to finish off your question, if India can cope with no Rohit, no Ashwin, no Kohli, I think it's now. I think a couple of years ago, I don't think they would have coped as well. Because I think some of these guys that are coming in are now ready to take on the mantle.I think a couple of years has made a big difference. And I think this India side can cause England a problem. England started as favourites, but some of these guys are seriously... I mean, we haven't mentioned Sai Sudharsan, I think he's a seriously good player.","Shubman gill is the new india test captain.

Ravens' defense adds Jaire Alexander to elite secondary unit

Lamar Jackson 's recruitment and Ravens culture influence the signing

The Baltimore Ravens opened up the news cycle with an absolute bombshell, signing former Green Bay Packers cornerback Jaire Alexander to a one-year deal worth up to $6 million. Now, the Ravens not only add further depth to their secondary with this, but they send a message to the entire AFC as well. We are all in for a Super Bowl in 2025.Adding Jaire Alexander makes for one of the more talented secondaries in all of football for the Ravens. They would pair him with fellow Pro Bowler Marlon Humphrey, top draft pick Nate Wiggins, and star safety Kyle Hamilton. Baltimore would now boast one of the most elite and versatile defensive backfields in the league. Alexander, a two-time Pro Bowler, boasts 70 pass breakups, 12 career interceptions, and one of the best reputations as a man-to-man cover corner in the league.Even with him dealing with some injuries lately, the sky still has always been the limit for Alexander. His coverage grades on PFF are consistently among the best in the league when healthy. The Ravens smartly laid out the contract in terms of performance-based bonuses, thereby putting minimal risk into betting on Alexander returning to form. Baltimore's improved defense may be just the thing that gets the Ravens over the hump in the playoffs in an AFC where they want to be more pass-heavy with the quarterbacks like Patrick Mahomes and Josh Allen prolific in the league.Alexander's decision to sign with Baltimore was heavily impacted by Lamar Jackson, his former teammate at Louisville. Jackson himself is said to have contacted Alexander and has reportedly even pushed the Ravens' front office to pick him up. And that familiarity, coupled with a winning culture and Super Bowl expectations, put Baltimore at the top of the market for Williams, even over other offers that included more lucrative dollar signsAlso Read: Three men charged in shooting that paralyzed aspiring college football star in Brooklyn Park The Ravens keep reinforcing that this is a player-led, Super Bowl-or-bust organization. Jackson's leadership off the field is now catching up to his MVP-caliber performances on it. GM Eric DeCosta showed the Ravens can still make impactful moves by listening to his franchise quarterback and delivering what he wanted. Alexander's arrival is just the type of addition that takes a strong contender and transforms them into a legitimate favorite in the AFC.","The baltimore ravens signed former green bay packers cornerback jaire alexander to a one-year deal worth up to $6 million.
