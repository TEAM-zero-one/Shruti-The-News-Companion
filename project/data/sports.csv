Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030 Push

The Scale of Investment

Ronaldo Speaks

Changing Global Perceptions

What Travellers Can Expect Next



The Real Test Ahead

Disclaimer: Content Produced by Saudi Tourism

When Cristiano Ronaldo appears in a campaign, people look. That simple fact is the fulcrum of Saudi Tourism’s latest push: a filmic, high-octane campaign titled “I Came for Football, I Stayed for More” that positions Ronaldo not just as a sporting icon but as a living, breathing emblem of Saudi’s newly ambitious events calendar – the. The film highlights how one of the world’s most recognisable athletes invites audiences to explore Saudi beyond football, from museums and desert festivals to fashion weeks and film premieres. It delivers a clear message: come for the match, stay for the rest.Ronaldo’s involvement is more than a celebrity endorsement; it’s a strategic bridge between two narratives. On one side sits the immediate, visceral thrill of live sport, stadium roars, late penalties, rivalries renewed, on the other sits a carefully curated cultural programme that Saudi wants international travellers to discover: AlUla’s rock-cut valleys, Riyadh’s sprawling seasons and fashion weeks, film festivals on the Red Sea, and purpose-built entertainment districts. Dress the country in the unmistakable glow of a global star, and you give curious travellers an easy entry point to explore the rest.This is not spin without backing. Saudi’s leadership has been investing in travel and events as part of Vision 2030, a transformation plan that has already altered the map of global tourism. Official targets have been raised now cite an ambition of 150 million visitors by 2030, and the calendar itself is swelling with headline acts: from elite motorsport and global tennis to esports and major golf tournaments. These events will help turn seasonal travel into year-round visits.The future shines when there’s growth. Saudi has committed $800 billion towards developing its tourism sector as part of Vision 2030. The industry is projected to reach $22.4 billion in market value by 2030, contributing $16.5 billion to the Kingdom’s GDP. Events play a pivotal role in this vision, not only boosting visitor numbers but also driving infrastructure growth, creating jobs and inspiring youth participation. Investments in new stadiums, arenas and grassroots programmes are central to shaping Saudi’s legacy as a leader in global sports tourism and wider entertainment.The campaign, titled “I Came for Football, I Stayed For More,” features Cristiano Ronaldo and is presented as a journey through Saudi’s expanding calendar of cornerstone events. The Saudi Tourism Authority says the campaign will run across key markets including Europe, India and China, and will use TV, social, digital and OTA channels to showcase year-round sports, entertainment, film and fashion events held across Riyadh, Jeddah and AlUla, alongside curated visitor packages aimed at making travel easier. The release also includes remarks from Saudi tourism officials underlining the kingdom’s investment in tourism as part of Vision 2030 and Ronaldo’s own comments about the country’s blend of heritage and ambition.Cristiano Ronaldo said: “Being part of Saudi’s journey as a global sports hub has been truly special and somehow unexpected for me a few years ago. Today, the truth is that from the energy of the fans to the scale of ambition, this is where the future of sport is being written. What I admire most about Saudi is how it honours its roots while building for the future. From camels to horses, racing to esports, from the desert to the stadium, this is a place where every young athlete can dream big. ”For the traveller, and for the reader back home, the immediate takeaway is an invitation to rethink Saudi as a multi-layered destination. It is not merely a place to watch world-class football or a one-note stopover; it is positioning itself as a thriving global destination where culture, sport and entertainment meet. Featuring Ronaldo at the centre, the campaign mirrors Saudi’s spirit as a modern, forward-looking destination—open, vibrant, and ready to welcome the world. His Excellency Ahmed Al Khateeb, Minister of Tourism for Saudi Arabia, stated: ""Today, Saudi is cementing its place as a global destination that combines cultural authenticity, warm hospitality, and the thrill of world-class events. In the tourism sector, we remain steadfast in our commitment to developing a seamless landscape that inspires the world and provides visitors with unforgettable experiences.""Expect blockbuster weekends where sport sits beside concerts and curated local experiences; think Formula 1 weekends wrapped with live music, or a football fixture that dovetails with a regional food festival and guided heritage walks. Tailored packages from tour operators that stitch headline events into longer itineraries are also meant to encourage visitors to stay longer.Ultimately, Saudi’s newest campaign is more than a call to sport—it’s a welcome to a nation rich with landscapes, culture, cuisine, and unforgettable experiences. With Cristiano Ronaldo amplifying its global reach, the campaign transforms into a simple truth: come for football, stay to discover Saudi.","The campaign features cristiano ronaldo and is presented as a journey through saudi’s expanding calendar of cornerstone events.

Yet, Chicago Bears’ star Caleb Williams has added something else to the mix—authentic self-expression. The No. 1 overall pick in the 2024 NFL Draft has become as well known for his bold personality and painted nails as he has for his rocket arm. For Williams, it’s more than fashion—it’s family, confidence, and staying true to who he is.Caleb Williams’ nail-painting ritual traces back to high school, when his mother’s career as a nail technician inspired him to experiment. “It started, I would say, three years ago,” Williams explained in a 2023 USC Athletics interview. “My mom does nails. Let’s just start it off there. She’s done it my whole life. It’s just kind of always been around me. Nobody else does it. I just kinda like to do new things.”What began as a personal nod to his mother soon became part of his game-day identity. From his debut in the 2024 regular season to several games afterward, Williams sported painted nails, instantly sparking conversation across the league. He’s not just comfortable standing out—he embraces it.Whether sitting courtside at NBA games in bold outfits or leading his team on Sundays, Williams carries the same message: confidence has no rules.Interestingly, his painted nails became linked to an odd statistic. According to OutSports, the Bears started 4-3 in games where Williams wore nail polish but lost seven straight once he stopped. While the connection is almost certainly coincidental, it added to the superstition and chatter surrounding the quarterback’s unique style.Williams’ rookie season wasn’t without struggles. Chicago endured a tough 10-game losing streak, and the quarterback faced relentless pressure, being sacked 68 times. In the midst of it, he briefly stopped painting his nails, focusing instead on regaining momentum. “I was trying to figure out how to get things back on track,” he admitted to ESPN. The pressure, he acknowledged, became “a little tiring at the end.”But the story didn’t end there. By the offseason, Williams had returned to his signature look, refusing to let outside opinions dictate his choices. “It doesn’t bother me,” he said of critics. “I’m not going to apologize.” For him, the ritual isn’t about gimmicks—it’s about identity. “It’s just me being myself,” he emphasized, describing his expression as “unapologetic.”As the Bears prepare for the 2025 season, Williams’ painted nails stand as a symbol of resilience and individuality. Whether it helps his win-loss record or not, one thing is certain—Caleb Williams will continue rewriting what it means to be a modern NFL quarterback.Also Read: Josh Allen turns Sunday night into must-see TV as Bills vs. Ravens pulls jaw-dropping 24.7 million viewers",Caleb williams is the no. 1 overall pick in the 2024 nfl draft.

Isaiah Foskey faced challenges during his time with the Saints



Isaiah Foskey could thrive in Cincinnati under familiar coaching



“4-3 defensive end with future starting potential”

Former Saints second-round pick Isaiah Foskey, who visits with the Bears today and the Eagles earlier, is headed to the Bengals, per reports by NFL reporter Jordan Schultz. Foskey, coming out of Notre Dame, was a disruptive player in college, but he struggled to replicate that success in the NFL. He now has a new chance in Cincinnati, and a chance to work with a familiar coaching staff; it might just be then that he finds the right environment to realize that talent.Foskey played at a high level at Notre Dame. He was drafted 40th overall in the 2023 NFL Draft and entered the league as he left the school. During that time, his name at the top of the sack list. But perhaps more disappointing than his tweener status was that his two years in New Orleans weren't marked by many snaps on defense. He produced poorly with no sacks to show for his efforts.Foskey had just under 84 defensive snaps as a rookie and found even less opportunity in his sophomore campaign. He had minimal impact, though he did play special teams, and was released during final cuts this year.Foskey’s NFL start is hardly ringing the bell for the Bengals to give up on him. They've had interest in him all offseason, and it finally resulted in the signing that was assumed. In particular, Foskey spent his last season of college football playing for Al Golden, the Bengals' new defensive coordinator, in a rare twist of consistency that could help Foskey grow. Foskey has been seen by analysts as aif he can work on his techniques as a pass rusher and improve his hands.Also Read: Chad ‘Ochocinco’ Johnson prioritizes gaming over sex if Bengals don’t win the Super Bowl If he finally ends up on the Bengals' 53-man roster, Foskey would factor into a rotation that includes Shemar Stewart, Joseph Ossai, Myles Murphy, and one more ex-Saints pass rusher, Trey Hendrickson. The addition is a low-risk, high-reward opportunity for Cincinnati, allowing the organization an opportunity to mold a still-long athlete yet to reach his football ceiling. For Foskey, it is a new beginning in a scheme and with a staff that already has familiarity with him.","Former saints second-round pick isaiah foskey is headed to the bengals.

Noah Lyles and Sha’Carri Richardson, the top sprinters from the USA, are ready to race at the Tokyo 2025 World Athletics Championships from September 13 to 21. The prize for winning a gold medal is $70,000, but many people in track and field say this is not enough money anymore. Fans, experts, and athletes feel upset because the prize money has barely gone up in ten years, even when prices around us have climbed a lot. They say champions like Lyles and Richardson deserve more for all their hard work.Noah Lyles won big titles in the 100 m and 200 m before coming to Tokyo. Sha’Carri Richardson is the defending 100 m champion. World Athletics says the prize pool for this championship is $8.498 million, with $70,000 for gold, $35,000 for silver, and $22,000 for bronze.But people are not happy. A big reason is that the 2025 Diamond League will pay over $9 million, showing just how much more athletes can earn there.Olympic medalist and expert Rori Dunk shared a clear example. In 2015, gold medals paid $60,000. Now in 2025, they pay $70,000. If you add inflation, that should be about $81,778. So the prize has actually lost value. Silver and bronze pay even less than they should for today’s money.One fan called itanother said,Fans and experts alike are raising voices. Some say track and field is not getting enough money despite being exciting and popular. One fan compared it to tennis, where Wimbledon winners will take home over £3 million in 2025, a huge contrast.People believe World Athletics should rethink how it rewards star athletes. They argue better pay will help the sport grow and keep athletes from walking away. Noah Lyles and Sha’Carri Richardson are among the biggest names, and many feel they should be paid like that.","Noah lyles and sha’carri richardson spark outrage over low pay at world championships.

NEW DELHI: Indian cricketer Shreyas Iyer has revealed the extent of the back injury that nearly ended his career, disclosing that he suffered paralysis in one leg before making a successful return to the sport. The setback also cost him a place in the BCCI’s central contract list.Two years ago, Iyer was hospitalised in England as his condition worsened, surviving on painkillers and cortisol injections while his spine and hip deteriorated.“No one can understand the pain I went through. I was totally paralysed in one leg. With spine surgery, you can place a rod in the back and still manage. But a snapped nerve, which is what I had, is really, really dangerous,” Iyer told GQ India.The batsman recalled how the pain shot “all the way down to my tiny toe,” calling the experience “horrendous and scary.”After surgery, Iyer needed a full year to recover, during which he slipped out of the central contract list.“People see athletes as robots who must perform every game. They don’t know what’s happening behind the scenes,” he said.Recently, Iyer’s omission from India’s Asia Cup squad raised eyebrows, especially after he emerged as Punjab Kings’ top scorer in IPL 2025.“I can only control the controllable. I’ll keep working on my skills and strength, and when the opportunity arises, I’ll grab it with both hands,” he added.His journey highlights not just the physical toll of elite sport, but also the resilience required to fight back.",Indian cricketer shreyas iyer reveals extent of back injury that nearly ended his career.

Suryakumar Yadav press conference: 'I will message you Playing XI', and more on India preparations

NEW DELHI: There’s an old video of Shubman Gill and Abhishek Sharma doing the rounds. In it, Abhishek on his Instagram Live asks Gill, “Fans are asking, who is your girlfriend?” Shubman replies, “Aawaaz nahi aa rahi (Your voice is breaking).” To this, Abhishek mischievously says, “Ab toh awaaz nahi hi aayegi (Now, you obviously won’t be able to hear me!). ”The conversation is aptly explained by Arun Bedi, former Punjab cricketer, who saw Gill and Abhishek right from their U-14 days for Punjab.“Ek shaant hai and dusra shaitaan (One is shy, whereas the other is naughty),” Bedi tells TimesofIndia.com.Come Wednesday, Shubman Gill and Abhishek Sharma will walk out to open for India against the UAE in the Asia Cup that got underway on Tuesday. It won’t be the first time — the duo have been opening since their U-14 days. Bedi shares one of the anecdotes about them when Shubman and Abhishek were 13 and 12, respectively.“Earlier, there used to be a Dhruv Pandove Trophy for U-14 players. Only North Zone teams - Delhi, Haryana, Punjab, J&K, and Himachal - used to play in it. Both of them played for the first time under my coaching. Abhishek Sharma was the captain and Shubman Gill was the vice-captain. Our tournament was in Una, Himachal Pradesh.Abhishek was the Man of the Series and Punjab won the tournament. We defeated Delhi in the final,” says Bedi.“In the league match against Himachal Pradesh, it was a two-day game. HP took a 10-run lead with five-or-six wickets in hand, and it was around Tea on Day 2. Maine in dono ko kaha ab toh haar jayenge (I told them, 'we’re going to lose').“After Tea, they came to me and said, sir kaise haar jayenge (Sir, how can we lose?),” he recalls.Bedi takes a pause and laughs before continuing.“First over after Tea, Abhishek took a wicket. The duo riled up the Punjab boys and they bowled and fielded with aggression. We ended up taking the rest of the wickets, and the target we got was around 90. We needed to chase it down in 10 overs and these two got us home inside seven overs.""Mai hairaan tha. itni choti umar mey ye aisa soch rahe (I was amazed — at such a young age, they were thinking like this).”After the match, Bedi called up Lakhwinder Gill and Rajkumar Sharma - fathers of Shubman and Abhishek - and told them their boys were special and would play for India one day.The duo did end up playing for India. And it was not only Bedi who predicted it, but also Late Desh Prem Azad, coach of Kapil Dev.“In the coming time, the two boys from Punjab who will represent India are going to be Abhishek and Shubman,” Desh Prem Azad’s voice still echoes in Rajkumar Sharma’s ears.“Dono captain bhi ban sakte hai (Both can even go on to become captains).“Jab bhi inki batting dekhta hun ye extraordinary nazar aate hai (Whenever I watch them bat, they look extraordinary). I can never forget his blessings,” he reminisces.Beyond opening partners, they have been childhood friends and understand each other’s game as well.Abhishek Sharma’s obsession with Shubman’s bat is well known. Abhishek scored his maiden T20I century with Shubman’s bat in Zimbabwe in 2024. “Whenever I need runs, I ask for his bat,” Abhishek had said.Meanwhile, Shubman in one of his interviews had revealed how once they had a big fight over the issue.“It actually started back in our U-16 days. Abhishek began playing with my bat — there’s a story behind it. He was batting on 80 or 90 runs using my match bat, and I didn’t want it to break, so I asked him to return it. We ended up having a bit of a fight over that! But whenever he asked for my bat, I always gave it to him — and he scored a lot of runs with it,” Gill had said in an interview with JioHotstar.Bedi says Abhishek was obsessed with Shubman’s bat and the current India Test captain used to take credit for all the runs he would score. “Sir, saare runs mere count hone chahiye. Khud ke bat se run nahi aate iske (His runs should be counted in my name, as he can’t score with his own bat!),” Bedi acknowledged.The duo were roommates right from their U-14 days and had a pre-match ritual. They used to crave pizzas and would gorge on the Italian dish before every game.In the same Instagram video where Abhishek teases Gill about his girlfriend, the current India Test captain had said: “Right from U-16 days and even in the U-19 days, we used to have pizzas before every match. It was a superstition. We did this for years. Pizza khao, run banao (Eat pizza and score runs). It used to be our mantra.”Now with diet and fitness in focus, it is unimaginable that the duo share a slice of pizza before their match, but both remain the same. Abhishek’s cheeky birthday post for Shubman’s 26th birthday is a reminder that one is still shy and the other mischievous.“With the bat they are ice and fire. They understand each other’s game so well and I am not surprised at the level they have reached,” Bedi says.","Shubman gill and abhishek sharma will open for india against the uae in the asia cup. The duo have been opening since their u-14 days for punjab. Arun bedi, former punjab cricketer, saw them from a young age and predicted they would play for india one day. Abhishek scored maiden t20i century with shubman’s bat in zimbabwe in 2024.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123797200,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-70184,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
