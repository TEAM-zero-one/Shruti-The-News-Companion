SALIVA BAN LIFTED

IPL: How will GT, LSG, DC, PBKS, RR fare? Greenstone Lobo predicts

INTRODUCTION OF THE ‘SECOND BALL’ RULE

IMPACT PLAYER RULE TO STAY

DRS FOR HEIGHT AND OFF-SIDE WIDES

NEW DELHI: Over the years, the Indian Premier League (IPL) has introduced several innovative rules, such as strategic timeouts and the Impact Player rule, to enhance the excitement of the tournament. With IPL 2025 set to begin, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has introduced a few more changes while retaining some existing rules.Bowlers will once again be allowed to use saliva on the ball in IPL 2025.This decision was made after discussions with captains from all 10 teams, with the majority supporting the move.The saliva ban was originally imposed as a health and safety measure during the COVID-19 pandemic, but with the restrictions now lifted, bowlers can resume the practice.A significant new rule—the ‘Second Ball’ rule—will be implemented in IPL 2025 to counter the effects of dew in night matches.Dew often hampers bowlers' ability to grip the ball, providing batters with an undue advantage, particularly during run chases.To address this, umpires will assess the condition of the ball after the 11th over of the second innings.If excessive dew is detected, the bowling team will be allowed to use a new ball. This rule, however, will not apply to afternoon matches.The Impact Player rule, introduced in previous editions, will continue in IPL 2025.This rule allows teams to substitute one player during a match, providing more opportunities for uncapped players who might not otherwise get a chance to play.The Decision Review System (DRS) will now include referrals for height-based no-balls and wides outside the off-stump. With the use of Hawk-Eye technology and ball tracking, umpires will have additional support in making accurate decisions.",The board of control for cricket in india (bcci) has introduced a few more changes to the indian premier league.

Hilarity Ensues After Los Angeles Lakers Star LeBron James Seemingly 'Forgot' His Wife,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/hilarity-ensues-after-los-angeles-lakers-star-lebron-james-seemingly-forgot-his-wife/articleshow/119269462.cms,"LeBron and Savannah James (Image via Getty)

Did LeBron James really forget about his wife?



King James is a thorough gentleman



LeBron James forgets Savannah was with him leaving her with only one choice at the event

LeBron and Savannah James are two people who show every day how much they love and respect each other. The couple has been going strong from day one and is yet to falter. But what about 'forget'? Well, if you ask some people, they might tell you that the Los Angeles Lakers star allegedly forgot about his wife while the two were at an event for their youngest son, Bryce James .Recently, LeBron and his wife, Savannah James, were attending their son, Bryce's game, where he and his teammates were crowned California State Division 1 champions . While the two parents were quite happy with their child's achievements and seemed to be in good spirits, some fans made a little fuss about how LeBron James had seemingly left Savannah behind when they got to the venue.King James was seen walking ahead, something rare for the Lakers star, as he and Savannah are usually seen walking side by side. But in this instance, he walked ahead while the queen was seen coming in after him. And that led to fans needlessly pointing the whole thing out, making a conspiracy out of thin air. For someone like James, who is always praising his wife, forgetting her would be a little too much.While he may have taken his seat before his wife, that did not mean King James had foregone all his manners. After taking his own seat in the front row, LeBron made sure that Savannah's seat was lowered, so that she didn't have any problem while sitting. Just because he walked ahead of her for once, does not mean he forgot he had his wife with him.The two were seen having a good time, as their younger son and his high school team earned yet another victory before they were declared California State Division 1 champions, much to the delight of the James family. Bryce will be moving to Arizona in the fall, where we will be joining the Wildcats. His father, on the other hand, although is out with injury as of now, is expected to return by the end of next week.Also Read: Look Out JJ Redick: Injury Means Nothing as LeBron James Takes to Coaching the Los Angeles Lakers from the Bench","Lebron james and his wife, savannah james, were at an event for their son, bryce james.

Why the Lakers Could Land Kennard

Luka Doncic of the Los Angeles Lakers (Image via Getty)

Financial Flexibility: Kennard’s relatively low salary demands make him an affordable target for the Lakers Proven Track Record: His consistent shooting numbers demonstrate his ability to contribute immediately Fit with Superstars: Kennard’s skill set complements the playstyles of Doncic and James, making him a valuable addition.

“We’ll see if the magical negotiating tactics that allowed Pelinka to pry Luka away from the Mavs can get to work snagging Kennard away from what will be multiple suitors.”

Theare reportedly setting their sights on adding sharpshooters this offseason, and one name that has emerged as a potential target is. This player could be a key addition to the Lakers’ roster as they aim to build a competitive team around their superstar duo of Luka Doncic and LeBron James Luke Kennard, a six-foot-five shooting guard of the Memphis Grizzlies , has built a reputation as one of the league’s most reliable three-point shooters. This season, he’s shooting an impressive 44.6% from beyond the arc, maintaining a career average of 43.9%. His ability to stretch the floor and knock down shots consistently makes him an ideal fit for the Los Angeles Lakers, who are prioritizing floor spacers to complement their star players.Luke Kennard’s affordability is another factor that makes him an attractive option for the Lakers. Currently earning $9.3 million in the final year of his contract, Kennard has never made more than $15 million annually. This financial flexibility is crucial for the Los Angeles Lakers, who are managing significant salary commitments to Doncic and James.As Colin Keane of the Sporting News notes:Luke Kennard’s NBA journey began when he was drafted by the Detroit Pistons in 2017. After spending two and a half seasons in Detroit, he was traded to the LA Clippers, where he continued to showcase his shooting prowess. In 2022, he was traded to the Memphis Grizzlies, where he has become a key contributor.Now, as an upcoming unrestricted free agent, Kennard is expected to draw interest from multiple teams, including the Los Angeles Lakers. The Grizzlies will likely attempt to retain him, but the Lakers’ front office, led by GM Rob Pelinka, is known for its strategic negotiating tactics.The Los Angeles Lakers ’ offseason strategy revolves around adding cost-effective shooters who can thrive alongside their star players. Kennard’s skill set aligns perfectly with this vision. His ability to knock down threes at a high clip would provide much-needed spacing for Doncic and James, allowing them to operate more effectively on the court.The Lakers' desire to assemble a team with a variety of players is further demonstrated by their interest in Kennard. Dalton Knecht, a rookie shooter, was traded away earlier this season, but Pelinka was able to reverse the transaction and keep him. Knecht's future with the squad is still up in the air, though, which highlights the necessity for dependable shooters like Kennard.While Luke Kennard’s fit with the Lakers is undeniable, the team will face competition from other suitors. The Grizzlies are expected to make a strong push to retain him, and other teams in need of shooting could also enter the fray.However, Pelinka’s track record of successful negotiations, including the acquisition of Luka Doncic , gives the Lakers a fighting chance. As Keane points out:The Los Angeles Lakers’ pursuit of Luke Kennard shows their commitment to building a roster capable of competing at the highest level. His shooting, affordability, and fit with the team’s stars make him a prime target for the upcoming offseason. While challenges remain, the Los Angeles Lakers’ front office has proven its ability to pull off significant moves in the past.Also read: How the Los Angeles Lakers Transformed Into a True Title Contender Ahead of the Playoffs As the offseason approaches, all eyes will be on Rob Pelinka and the Lakers to see if they can successfully lure Kennard away from Memphis and bolster their roster for a championship run.",Memphis grizzlies guard luke kennard is an upcoming unrestricted free agent.

After a massive career with the UFC, Anthony Smith has announced his retirement from fighting. The 36-year-old light-heavyweight fighter confirmed his retirement after his last fight scheduled for April 26, 2025, during UFC Kansas City. This fight will see Smith face Zhang Mingyang in what is expected to be a very emotional farewell.Smiths' career at UFC hit the highs and the lowest of his life after losing to Jones in their fight at UFC 235 in 2019 concerning the light heavyweight title. Smith has never been associated with the extreme breakage and long streak of losses similar to B.J. Penn and Tony Ferguson, but there is no denying that Smith was not the same dominant force that he used to be after losing to Jones in 2019. Nonetheless, Smith continued to fight, earning recognition as a fighter with resilience and determination.In a candid interview with MMA Fighting, Smith admitted he may have stayed in the sport longer than he should have. “I probably stuck around too long already, if we’re being honest,” he said with a laugh. Reflecting on his career, Smith shared that balancing fighting with family life became increasingly challenging. “It comes down to being a dad and a husband. I’m super involved, but it’d be nice to slow things down,” he explained.Smith also opened up about the toll of training camps, which often kept him away from his loved ones. The recent passing of a close friend, Scotty, made the decision to retire easier. “Once Scotty died, it made it really easy. This thing is different for me now. Retiring feels like leaving something that doesn’t feel normal anymore,” he said.As Smith prepares for his final fight, fans are left wondering if he’ll go out with a win. Regardless of the outcome, his legacy as a fierce competitor and a dedicated family man will remain intact.Also Read: Unstoppable?

Golden State Warriors receives a concerning update following Stephen Curry’s hard fall on the floor



starexited Thursday night’s game against theafter taking a tough fall late in the third quarter. The 37-year-old guard, who had been dealing with a sore back, landed hard after attempting a pass in the lane, colliding with Toronto’s Jonathan Mogbo and Colin Castleton. The Warriors later announced that he had sustained a pelvic contusion and would not return to the game.Golden State Warriors star player Stephen Curry ’s fall has left fans and the team concerned about his health. The incident occurred as Curry drove into the paint and attempted to kick out a pass to the opposite corner. As he failed to break his fall, Curry landed awkwardly on his lower back. The sound of his hard fall was audible as commentators aptly pointed out, “Here you can actually hear him hit the floor here.”Curry remained on the ground for a minute while play continued before a Toronto timeout allowed the Warriors’ medical team to check on him.Curry slowly got to his feet and walked to the sideline before heading to the locker room with Warriors’ vice president of player health and performance, Rick Celebrini.The Athletic's Anthony Slater shared, ""Concern for the Warriors: Steph Curry just went to the locker room grabbing at his tailbone after a hard fall. Here he is discussing it with Drew Yoder and Rick Celebrini and then walking to locker room gingerly with Celebrini.""The Warriors went on to claim a 117-114 win over the Toronto Raptors. Later, it was revealed that he was taken for MRI. “He thought he might be able to come back,” Kerr said. “We just decided not to risk anything. Hopefully it’s not bad.”Curry's teammate Draymond Green also commented on his hard fall, “He hit that ground hard, you could hear it. It’s crazy. Obviously a scary moment for us, for him. Hopefully he’s good.”The Warriors veteran had already been managing a lower back strain from last Thursday’s win over the Sacramento Kings. Although he was in discomfort, he continued playing through it before sitting out Tuesday’s game against Milwaukee. Before his exit against Toronto, Curry had been battling tight individual defense but still managed 17 points in 25 minutes, shooting an efficient 6-of-8 from the field and 2-of-4 from three-point range.Beyond his brief rest against the Bucks, Curry has been remarkably durable this season, playing in 59 of the Warriors’ 69 games. Now, his injury concern could be a massive blow for the Warriors’ playoff campaign.“The last three games I think he’s been tired, but it’s more of a mental and emotional fatigue than physical. He’s fine physically. When he’s emotionally tired, it affects his decision-making. He’s a little bit out of sorts,” head coach Steve Kerr recently said of Curry. “We’ve got lots of experience with Steph. We know him well. He just needs a night off once in a while. He’s for sure earned it,” he added.Also Read: Stephen Curry's exhaustion catches up as Golden State Warriors crumble against shorthanded Nuggets: ""We gotta get him some rest"" Of course, Curry has led the team to win on multiple occasions and his dominance on the court adds fuel to their lineup.

Puka Nacua shuts down Michael Jordan’s GOAT case while backing LeBron James as the NBA’s greatest



The eternal debate: Jordan’s perfection vs. LeBron’s longevity



Michael Jordan vs LeBron James - Who Is the NBA GOAT? | My Thoughts

Conclusion: No changing minds in the GOAT debate



Few discussions ignite passion like the age-old NBA GOAT debate . This time, the conversation took an unexpected turn when Los Angeles Rams wide receiver Puka Nacua found himself in the middle of a fiery argument with the St. Brown brothers, Amon-Ra and Equanimeous. The setting? A casual yet intense episode of the ""St. Brown Podcast."" The topic? Not football, but basketball’s greatest of all time. And as expected, the debate boiled down to the two titans—Michael Jordan and LeBron James Without hesitation, Puka Nacua declared his allegiance. “So, LeBron’s the GOAT to you?” Amon-Ra asked, sensing the battle ahead. “Yeah,” Puka responded, unwavering in his belief. And from that moment, he was locked and loaded with his arguments.The Rams wideout wasted no time pointing out James' unparalleled versatility. “He’s 6’8. He’s 260. He plays the 1 through 5,” he argued, painting LeBron as the ultimate Swiss Army knife in basketball. In NFL terms, that would be like a player excelling as a quarterback, edge rusher, and cornerback—an unprecedented level of adaptability. However, Amon-Ra wasn’t convinced. “He’s not playing the 5. He’s not guarding a center,” he countered.Unfazed, Puka continued, emphasizing LeBron’s ability to succeed regardless of the team or coach. “He’s gone to three different organizations and won. Everywhere he goes, he’s had a new coach that he’s taken to the NBA Finals.” This point was met with skepticism from Amon-Ra, who argued, “Coaches don’t matter that much in basketball.” But Nacua was ready. “Who’s the only coach Michael Jordan won NBA championships with?” he asked. Amon-Ra’s response was immediate: “He had one coach. Phil Jackson.”While Jordan’s legacy under Phil Jackson is undeniable, Nacua seized the opportunity to highlight that Jordan played 15 seasons, yet only truly dominated between 1991 and 1998. “He wasn’t only in the NBA from ‘91 to ‘98. He played 15 years, bruh. Like, there’s a point where he was getting bounced in the first round,” Puka remarked, reminding everyone that Jordan’s career wasn’t flawless from start to finish.This exchange showcased the core of the GOAT debate. Jordan’s supporters point to his perfect 6-0 NBA Finals record, his unmatched scoring prowess, and the sheer intimidation he brought to the game. LeBron’s case, on the other hand, is built on longevity, adaptability, and his ability to dominate in different eras and with different teams.Puka further reinforced his stance by comparing LeBron’s immediate impact with Jordan’s early struggles. “When he was 21 in college, LeBron was carrying his team to the NBA Finals already, like year four, carrying Ilgauskas to the NBA Finals.” This was a direct jab at Jordan, who, despite entering the league in 1984, took seven years to make his first Finals appearance in 1991.While Amon-Ra attempted to dismiss Puka’s points, the reality remains: LeBron’s ability to thrive under different coaches, carry multiple franchises to the championship stage, and maintain his dominance well into his 30s and 40s makes him a compelling GOAT candidate. Jordan’s six rings remain untouchable, but LeBron’s all-around impact and sustained excellence keep the debate alive.The NBA GOAT conversation remains the ultimate barbershop argument—one that will never reach a unanimous conclusion. Whether one values Jordan’s ruthless efficiency and championship dominance or LeBron’s ability to evolve and lead across generations, the debate is fueled by subjective perspectives.For Puka Nacua, LeBron’s case is clear: longevity, versatility, and undeniable dominance. But for Amon-Ra and millions of Jordan fans worldwide, the six rings and the aura of MJ’s reign are enough to silence any counterpoint.Also Read: While NFL future remains uncertain, Aaron Rodgers quietly backs golfers through Venmo transactions In the end, the discussion remains what it has always been—a never-ending battle of eras, perspectives, and unwavering loyalties. And as long as both Jordan and LeBron's legacies endure, the GOAT debate will continue to thrive.","Los angeles rams wide receiver puka nacua argued with the st. brown brothers on the ""st. brown podcast"" the debate boiled down to the two titans of the nba: michael jordan and lebron james.

Stephen A. Smith showered praise on Bronny James following his performance against the Milwaukee Bucks



ESPN’s Stephen A. Smith has recently changed his stance on Bronny James. Smith was one of the most vocal critics of Bronny James as he has previously questioned openly about whether he deserved his spot in the NBA. He even went as far as to say in January that Bronny’s presence in the league stemmed from the influence of his father, referring to Los Angeles Lakers veteran LeBron James. That criticism led to a heated courtside confrontation between LeBron and Smith but now, the analyst is showering praise for Bronny.After Bronny James’ breakout performance against the Milwaukee Bucks on Thursday night, Stephen A. Smith appears to be singing a different tune. Several major Lakers players were sidelined but the 20-year-old guard delivered a staggering show as he had the opportunity to step up. Bronny put up a career-high 17 points, dished out five assists, and shot an efficient 7-of-10 from the field. Despite the Lakers falling 118-89, his individual performance stole the show.“I Might've Been Wrong,” Smith said on ESPN First Take. “I was very impressed because I saw an elevation in his level of confidence and poise,” Smith admitted. “It was like it didn't really phase him, he didn't look as nervous as he had looked in previous appearances on the court.”The veteran analyst went on to add, “My position was all along, Bronny James needed to be in the G League... and then after that let him come on because I've always believed that this kid has the potential, once I watched him, to be in the NBA.”Smith later showered praise for Lakers head coach JJ Redick. “What I saw last night made me say to myself, ‘Wait a minute. He keeps showing up and playing like that, JJ Redick and his staff obviously doing an exceptional job coaching him. The G Leaguers obviously doing a good job of preparing him, him sitting on the bench learning and watching the Lakers play... Evidently that seems to be working for him.’”Smith now acknowledges Bronny’s showdown but his stance on the situation with LeBron has not changed.“Most people know, we ain’t got to like each other or ever talk to each other in life, for me to admit that you gotta give respect where it’s due,” Smith said.And yet, he couldn’t resist reminding LeBron that he wasn’t entirely wrong in the first place. “The same dude that his daddy approached courtside is the same dude that said ‘I thought that he had this potential.’ I just didn’t think it would be this season.”Also Read: ""Now they're quiet"": Gilbert Arenas is all for Bronny James silencing his haters with his game Bronny has recently condemned his critics with frustration during his chat with The Athletic, ""But sometimes it just, it fuels me a little bit.

Both women went back and forth against each other, although, Liv Morgan had Raquel Rodriguez by her side. Moreover, Naomi also interfered and knocked down Jade Cargill with the tag team title belt. This led to Liv Morgan hitting the Oblivion to pick up the win. Following that, Naomi came into the ring to attack Jade Cargill.The match began after The Street Profits celebrated their tag team title win last week and finally capturing gold after four years. Los Garza displayed a good performance against the new champions in their bid to earn a title opportunity in the future.
