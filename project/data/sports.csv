In the associated caption, Brady blithely acclaimed, “Hanging with the biggest boss in Vegas, and @max’s dad.”Max Domi, a current forward for the Leafs and Tie’s son, reacted to this mention by sharing the photo on his own Instagram story, embellished with three laughing emojis. Brady continued to share other images from the celebration, including a shot of him standing with basketball legend Shaquille O’Neal and David Beckham. In a comical stab, Brady even entitled Tie and Max “the backup goalies” for the Inter Miami soccer team, jokingly referring to them as the “backups of the backups. ”Also Read: Exploring the friendship between Auston Matthews and Justin Bieber as the NHL star supports his surprise ‘Swag’ album",Nfl legend tom brady and hockey great wayne gretzky met at the fifa club world cup final.

Why Al Horford Makes Sense for the Milwaukee Bucks

Theare reportedly interested in adding a seasoned veteran to their frontcourt in the form of, according to a report from NBA insider Marc J. Spears. With Horford expected to part ways with the Boston Celtics this offseason, Milwaukee joins a list of contenders keeping close tabs on the 39-year-old center.The Milwaukee Bucks are coming off a busy summer that saw them secure Myles Turner on a four-year, $108.9 million deal. While Turner is expected to anchor the frontcourt, the addition of Al Horford would offer the team a reliable and experienced backup, strengthening Milwaukee’s frontcourt rotation with both size and floor-spacing.Despite his age, Horford remains a valuable contributor. During the 2024–25 NBA season, he played 60 regular-season games for Boston, starting in 42. He averaged:Horford also played a key role in helping the Celtics win the 2024 NBA Championship, reinforcing his value as a playoff-tested contributor.The Milwaukee Bucks aren’t alone in their pursuit. According to Marc J. Spears, several teams remain in the mix: “Golden State expected him to sign last week — he didn’t,” Spears said. “Lakers, Milwaukee, Atlanta, I believe, are also interested.” (H/t: Sporting News)While the Golden State Warriors were initially considered frontrunners, Horford’s delay in signing suggests he is still weighing his options. The Los Angeles Lakers and Atlanta Hawks are also reportedly in the running, making it a competitive market for the veteran’s services.Here’s why the Milwaukee Bucks may see Al Horford as a perfect fit:- Locker Room Leadership: With a young supporting cast being assembled around Giannis Antetokounmpo, Horford’s playoff experience and professionalism could be a steadying influence.- Floor Spacing: His ability to knock down threes adds a different dimension to the Bucks’ offense, especially when Giannis attacks the paint.- Defensive Versatility: While no longer at his peak, Horford remains a capable team defender who can switch, help, and rotate effectively.Milwaukee’s interest in Horford highlights a smart approach to building a title-contending roster around its superstar. As they aim for a deeper playoff run in 2025–26, adding a proven winner like Horford could be the subtle but strategic move that makes a significant difference.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Golden State Warriors predicted to land $250 million Phoenix Suns star guard as potential backcourt partner for Stephen Curry As of now, Al Horford remains unsigned, and the Milwaukee Bucks, along with other suitors, will await his decision.

Pittsburgh Penguins could be back in the hands of Mario Lemieux in a dramatic ownership move



Mario Lemieux, a name etched deeply into Pittsburgh Penguins history, could be preparing for a stunning return—this time off the ice. According to The Athletic, Lemieux is reportedly “very interested” in buying back the Penguins alongside former co-owner Ron Burkle and ex-CEO Dave Morehouse, now serving as an advisor with the Pittsburgh Steelers.This potential move follows Fenway Sports Group’s (FSG) 2021 acquisition of the franchise in a $900 million deal. While FSG has maintained that it’s only exploring a “minority investment,” Lemieux’s group is said to be actively evaluating financial options to regain control. “We’ve seen the speculation, and as we’ve previously shared with media, Fenway Sports Group is currently engaged in a process to explore a potential minority investment in the Pittsburgh Penguins,” FSG said in a statement. However, many see this as an opening Lemieux could eventually capitalize on.The timing couldn’t be more fitting. Since the franchise changed hands, the Penguins have struggled. Pittsburgh failed to reach the playoffs in the last two seasons after a 15-year streak, and ticket sales have dropped to just 91.4% of capacity, an all-time low in the Sidney Crosby era. With fan enthusiasm fading and on-ice performance waning, a return to Lemieux-led ownership could breathe new life into the franchise.Lemieux’s legacy isn’t just about goals and assists—it’s about saving hockey in Pittsburgh. From leading the team to back-to-back Stanley Cup wins in 1991 and 1992, to stepping in with controlling interest when the franchise was bankrupt, Lemieux has twice resurrected the Penguins. He even returned to play in 2000, taking the team on an unexpected journey to the Eastern Conference Final while also serving as owner.With valuations of NHL franchises soaring—Forbes now pegs the Penguins at $1.75 billion—buying back the team won’t come cheap. But Lemieux’s group is reportedly hoping FSG will entertain a “reasonable” deal, especially given the team’s recent struggles and potential for league-wide revenue boosts from future expansion.Lemieux, who was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1997 before his comeback, last suited up during Crosby’s rookie season. He later watched Crosby lead the team to a Stanley Cup in 2009, under Lemieux’s ownership.If this comeback materializes, it won’t just be about business. For Lemieux, it’s about passion, legacy, and rescuing the Penguins once more when they need it most.Also Read: ""Lot of anxiety"": Johnny and Matthew Gaudreau’s sister opens up about ‘anxiety’ and heartbreak as she finally gets married after the tragic loss of both brothers","Penguins legend mario lemieux may return with ownership bid that could reshape the team’s direction.

Jada Mclean left an unforgettable mark on the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders — not only for her powerful performances over five seasons but for the role she played in changing the game off the field. As season 2 of Netflix's America's Sweethearts: Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders revealed, Mclean helped lead the squad’s push for fairer compensation. But in a surprise twist, just as their efforts finally paid off with a 400% salary increase, Mclean made the emotional decision to retire.The Palm Springs native worked her way to the top of the DCC ranks, eventually becoming first group leader — a role that required mentorship, choreography assistance, and strong team communication. Mclean was a standout not just for her dance skills but for her voice.Speaking of the team's successful compensation battle, she said: ""'Happy' isn't even the right word for it. [It] kind of felt like a relief, like everything had paid off ... finally we were done fighting.""Still, despite the long-awaited victory, Mclean confirmed her departure from the team during the uniform return ceremony. “I’m just looking forward to what’s next for me in life, and give it my all like I did when I was here,” she told director Kelli Finglass and choreographer Judy Trammell.It was a tearful farewell that signaled not just the end of an era, but a promising new beginning.Since retiring, Mclean hasn’t stepped away from the spotlight entirely. She’s traveled across the U.S. and Mexico, appeared at the ACM Awards, and even returned for limited promotional performances as part of the DCC On Tour and media appearances for the docuseries.In a May TikTok video, she opened up about her dreams beyond cheerleading: “I have thought about going into modeling after my DCC career comes to an end...

Despite Hailee Steinfeld ’s support, Josh Allen’s struggles against Patrick Mahomes

The Buffalo Bills may be perennial contenders, but as long as Patrick Mahomes wears red and gold, they remain firmly under his shadow. Despite a strong regular season and an MVP campaign from Josh Allen, the Bills have consistently fallen short in January — especially when facing the Kansas City Chiefs. Allen is now 0-4 in playoff games against Mahomes, a stat that looms large heading into the 2025 NFL season.The latest blow came in the 2024 AFC Championship Game, where Allen once again came up short. Despite leading a high-powered offense and having Hollywood’s Hailee Steinfeld cheering him on, the Wyoming-born quarterback has yet to overcome the Mahomes-sized wall standing between Buffalo and a Super Bowl return. The last time the Bills reached the big game was in 1993 — and Allen’s era has yet to change that.While Mahomes didn’t hit his usual 4,000-yard passing mark last season and threw just 26 touchdowns, ESPN analyst Harry Douglas issued a stark warning: “I think they are going to need a little help from someone else in the AFC. And what I mean by that is, they are 0-4 against the Kansas City Chiefs in the playoffs. They need someone else to knock off the Chiefs before they actually face them in a playoff game.”It’s a brutal truth, and one that underscores just how dominant Mahomes, Andy Reid, and Travis Kelce have been in the postseason.Kelce, in particular, has often been Allen’s nightmare, delivering clutch performances and touchdowns that crush Buffalo’s hopes again and again.Meanwhile, Hailee Steinfeld and Allen continue to be one of the NFL’s most-watched power couples, but even off-field love can’t soften the frustration of four straight playoff exits at the hands of the same team. If Allen loses to Mahomes again, the pressure will skyrocket — not just from media and fans, but perhaps even internally from the organization.Also Read: Josh Allen gives up oceanfront mansion after secret wedding—did Hailee Steinfeld want him out of L.A.?

Let’s be honest—no one expected Bill Belichick to go from Super Bowl mastermind to the center of social media drama. But in 2025, that’s exactly where he’s landed—and it's not because of a quarterback controversy or game-day call. It’s because of his 24-year-old girlfriend, Jordon Hudson, and one very cryptic Instagram Story set to Taylor Swift 's So Long, London.Jordon Hudson, whose social media persona is just as curated as her jet-setting lifestyle, took to Instagram on July 13 with a moody window shot mid-flight over Bar Harbor, Maine. The soundtrack? Swift’s most haunting bre“If Bill and I were to break up, would he co-write a song with Taylor Swift titled: ‘buh-bah baa ha ba’ ???”She passed it off as an “airplane thought,” but let’s not pretend this is just some harmless joke. When you pair your relationship with a Taylor Swift breakup track, you’re making a statement—even if it’s buried in humor. And fans noticed. Quickly.This isn’t the first time Jordon Hudson has raised eyebrows. From her awkward CBS interview where she dodged questions about her relationship, to her increasing public presence, it’s clear she’s no longer just “Bill’s girlfriend”—she’s a media figure in her own right.But that spotlight comes with criticism, especially given their 48-year age gap and her sudden rise into tabloid relevance.Even inside UNC’s football program, there’s reportedly tension. According to insiders, some staff are quietly annoyed by the nonstop attention Hudson brings. What was supposed to be Belichick’s quiet reinvention in college football has instead turned into a circus—and Paul Finebaum nailed it on First Take:“Bill Belichick. Anybody heard of this guy? He’s only the most famous NFL coach of all time this side of Vince Lombardi. But lately, he’s played second fiddle to his girlfriend.” Ouch!Whether Jordon’s post was sarcasm, a subtle cry for space, or a dramatic mid-air vibe check, it’s hard to ignore the noise around their relationship.

Steelers nearly caused QB chaos? Analyst says drafting Aaron Rodgers after Big Ben would've created a total quarterback mess,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/steelers-nearly-caused-qb-chaos-analyst-says-drafting-aaron-rodgers-after-big-ben-wouldve-created-a-total-quarterback-mess/articleshow/122447381.cms,"Steelers would’ve been a mess with Aaron Rodgers and Ben Roethlisberger together, claims analyst (Getty Images)

Steelers avoided a quarterback nightmare by not drafting Aaron Rodgers , analyst claims



Najee's firework accident, Mahomes not a fan of 18 games, NFLPA updates | PFT PM (FULL) | NFL on NBC

Few rookie quarterbacks have ever burst onto the NFL scene quite like Ben Roethlisberger did in 2004. Selected 11th overall by the Pittsburgh Steelers out of Miami (Ohio), “Big Ben” made an immediate impact by going 13-0 as a rookie starter and earning the Offensive Rookie of the Year title. The Steelers looked to have finally found their franchise quarterback after two decades of instability at the position post-Terry Bradshaw.However, Roethlisberger’s magic didn’t completely carry over into the postseason. He threw two interceptions in a shaky Divisional Round win against the New York Jets—a game the Steelers should’ve dominated—and added three more picks in a blowout AFC Championship loss to the Patriots. While fans remained hopeful, the front office wasn’t entirely sold just yet.That hesitation opened the door to one of the most intriguing “what ifs” in recent NFL history.According to NBC Sports’ Mike Florio, then-Steelers pro personnel coordinator Doug Whaley revealed that Pittsburgh seriously considered drafting Cal quarterback Aaron Rodgers in 2005. Rodgers, who had been projected as a possible No. 1 overall pick, was unexpectedly slipping in the first round.“[Whaley] made a comment recently that in 2005, as Aaron Rodgers… was plummeting through Round 1, the Steelers were considering taking him, if he had made it all the way down to No. 30,” Florio shared via Pro Football Talk. “Obviously, six spots earlier, the Packers took him at 24.”Had Rodgers slipped just a few more picks, Pittsburgh might have made the boldest quarterback move in NFL history—selecting back-to-back first-round QBs in consecutive years. Florio summed it up perfectly: “Man, that would have been awkward… That would have been something, Roethlisberger one year, Rodgers the next year. Who would have emerged as the long-term option? Presumably one of them gets traded. That would have been a mess. ”Ultimately, Rodgers went to Green Bay, and the Steelers chose tight end Heath Miller at No. 30. Far from a mere fallback, Miller carved out a legendary career in Pittsburgh, earning two Pro Bowl nods, two Super Bowl rings, and setting every major tight end record for the franchise.In hindsight, both teams struck gold. The Steelers won the Super Bowl that season—largely on the strength of their defense and running game—and added another in 2008, with Roethlisberger playing a leading role. Meanwhile, Rodgers waited three years behind Brett Favre before finally starting—and then defeating Roethlisberger in Super Bowl 45.Neither quarterback returned to the big stage again, but between them, three Lombardis and a legacy of consistent excellence prove both franchises made the right call on that fateful April day in 2005.Also Read: ""We get to talk once a week"": Jason Kelce hails Travis as a ‘great uncle’ and the ‘best friend’ he could ever ask for","Steelers would’ve been a mess with aaron rodgers and ben roethlisberger together, claims analyst.

Baltimore Ravens' Kyle Hamilton graded as No. 1 safety in NFL by league insiders



Kyle Hamilton Believes The Eagles Defense Has The Best Swag!

Kyle Hamilton has become the NFL 's best safety—and this time, it's not merely fan hype or team bias behind the buzz. It's official, per a 2025 ESPN polling of league coaches, executives, and scouts: the Baltimore Ravens standout is now the league's No. 1 safety. Kyle Hamilton is widely regarded as a generational talent at just 23, whose influence on the field is beyond normal statistics.When the Baltimore Ravens drafted Kyle Hamilton in the first round of the 2022 NFL Draft, everyone expected a lot. Now in his fourth season, Kyle Hamilton hasn't only exceeded expectations—he's shattered them.He's being likened to some of the most dominant defenders in football today, including Myles Garrett, T.J. Watt, and Maxx Crosby. In ESPN’s annual positional ranking, compiled from votes by league evaluators, Hamilton rose from the No. 2 spot last year to the top in 2025, surpassing Antoine Winfield Jr. and others.In 2023, he was the league's lone safety with a minimum of 10 tackles for loss and 10 pass breakups. He contributed three sacks and four interceptions, and he's one of only five players in the last two years with at least 15 pass deflections, five interceptions, and more than one forced fumble.Now that rookie first-round pick Malaki Starks is with the Ravens' secondary, Hamilton may be in for an even more commanding year. He's also negotiating a contract extension, seeking one that values him appropriately. While most young players would dread the prospect of impending negotiations, Hamilton is instead letting it fuel him as he enters 2025.Also read: Kyle Hamilton makes bold comment after Baltimore Ravens steal top defender Jaire Alexander from Green Bay Whether on the field, thanks to his football IQ, unmatchable versatility, or physical playmaking, Kyle Hamilton has commanded respect from the league—and he's hardly begun.
