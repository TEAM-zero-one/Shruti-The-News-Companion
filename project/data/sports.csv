“Their body language suggest something…”: Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce's subtle body language during NYC dinner hints at their true connection,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/their-body-language-suggest-something-taylor-swift-and-travis-kelces-subtle-body-language-during-nyc-dinner-hints-at-their-true-connection/articleshow/122148909.cms,"Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce's recent Manhattan outing has sparked discussions about their relationship's potential (TheImageDirect.com)

Body language expert says Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce are showing signs of lasting love

Over the weekend, Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce lit up Manhattan with what many are calling the ultimate display of youthful, romantic energy. But it wasn’t just the cute outfits and dinner date that had fans talking—it was the way they moved, dressed, and interacted. According to body language expert Judi James, their coordinated style and subtle affection hint at something deeper than celebrity chemistry: the belief that they may have truly found “the one.”Taylor Swift looked radiant in a flirty pale pink mini dress with gold buttons, while Travis Kelce kept it sleek in cropped black trousers, white socks, loafers, and a crisp white shirt. While this might seem like standard celebrity datewear, Judi James sees it as far more intentional. “Taylor and Travis’s styling and their body language suggest something of a time-warp,” she noted, pointing to their classic prom-queen and king aesthetic.This wasn’t just a fashionable night out. James observed that Kelce’s wardrobe choices are starting to mirror Swift’s romantic style. “Travis's short-cropped black pants and white socks suggest he's gradually and happily style-twinning with her,” she said.But it was his subtle movements that said even more. “Travis sucks his lips in at one point to show he's taking the date very seriously and his large paw of a hand encases Taylor's hand in a clasp of macho protection. ”From their body positioning—Travis Kelce confidently leading while Swift walked demurely behind—to the way she held her small handbag close, everything about their presence suggested a couple relishing that new, enchanted stage of romance. “Taylor's body language epitomizes 'demure' here, with her head lowered, her elbows pulled into her waist and that dinky little bag held in one hand,” James added.Judi James believes this ""first-date college look"" may not be accidental. “It could be a desire to stoke the idyllic romantic side of their relationship or a mutual wish to present each other as 'The One', going back to a teen-date state to delete any high-profile and sometimes less than agreeable relationships they've each had with others in the past,” she explained.Also Read: Why Taylor Swift’s love life feels louder with Travis Kelce than it ever did with Joe Alwyn Swift has long built her brand on emotional storytelling, and this softer, sweeter public persona may be a reflection of a new, more intentional chapter.

Evander Kane’s Vancouver Canucks move begins with promise but quickly stumbles

Evander Kane's homecoming to Vancouver goes awry just days after joining the Canucks. The return to Vancouver Canucks for Evander Kane had to be full of emotions, symbolism, and hope. After traversing almost every franchise in the NHL for a good number of years, the 33-year-old winger was now back in his hometown, the place where his hockey dreams started taking shape. But a fresh start soon took a turn for the worse after a chilling incident occurred shortly after his arrival in Vancouver. The trade made everyone talk, but quickly the talk was about the player's safety.Another championship-less season gone by means late into that season, the Oilers parted ways with 30-year-old workhorse winger Evander Kane, who was dealt to the Vancouver Canucks for the 117th pick in the 2025 NHL Draft. The pick was utilized in selecting the promising youngster David Lewandowski for Edmonton. Both parties could see value in the trade; for Kane, it meant the world on an emotional scale: it took him back to his hometown.Growing up in East Vancouver, Kane began carving his way into hockey through local leagues until he really blossomed with the Vancouver Giants in the WHL. The city shaped his playing style and also his identity.Coming back in uniform for the Canucks felt like the full-circle moment for the 33-year-old, bringing with it a rush of memories regarding his early rise and youthful dreams. Vancouver fans, on the other hand, were curious and hoping to see what the hometown boy had to offer.However, things had taken a strange turn a little while after his return. Kane was said to have been assaulted in Vancouver. The 2 Mutts Hockey Podcast stated that the assault needed medical intervention, but they never said anything about a grave injury. Sources close to the situation maintain that Kane was not instigating the matter but was wrongfully placed in the wrong spot at the wrong time. A video of the incident would soon clear up the series of actions and justify his innocence.Contrary to withdrawing from life at the hint of a cold encounter with evil, Kane took to social media to rally Canucks supporters and eager to set forth this new chapter with good vibes. Oak, when shedding six teams in his NHL career, this man brings leadership and experience to a young Vancouver roster desperately searching for consistency and grit.Also Read: Sam Bennett describes his fiancée’s thoughts about his $64 million Florida Panthers deal Although Evander Kane's return to Vancouver started on an ominous note, there is no question that the forward will be a vital addition to the Canucks' lineup.

Candace Parker's legacy reached new heights on Sunday night as the Los Angeles Sparks raised her iconic No. 3 jersey to the rafters at Crypto.com Arena. The halftime ceremony took place during a game against the Chicago Sky. It was a significant chapter in WNBA history. While Angel Reese powered the Sky to a 92-85 win over the Sparks, the true spotlight was on Parker as she was being immortalized by the team she led for 13 seasons.

Thousands filled the arena to celebrate her decorated career. Tributes poured in from basketball royalty. LeBron James, the NBA’s all-time scoring leader, took to Instagram to share a brief but powerful reaction to the moment, posting a video of the ceremony with the caption, “🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽”.Magic Johnson, Los Angeles Lakers icon and Sparks co-owner, offered a far more extensive tribute. Taking to X , Johnson wrote: “Candace Parker has left an indelible mark on the Los Angeles Sparks, not only as one of the greatest players to ever grace the court, but as a true ambassador of our franchise and women’s basketball as a whole.”The NBA legend continued, “Beginning with her arrival to the City of Angels in 2008, she not only lived up to the expectations placed on her as a two-time Gatorade Basketball Player of the Year and NCAA National Champion, she far exceeded them. Her unparalleled skill, relentless drive, and leadership elevated the Sparks to new heights and set a new standard of greatness. Candace is the best all-around player that has ever played in the WNBA. ”Johnson went on to add, “Her legacy is immeasurable — she redefined excellence, was a champion on the court and for the Los Angeles community and inspired countless fans and future generations of athletes. Very few champions get to see their jersey hanging from the rafters in this city. Retiring Candace’s No. 3 jersey is not just a celebration of her extraordinary career, but a tribute to the enduring mark she's left on this organization, the WNBA, and the city of Los Angeles. She will forever be a part of the Sparks family.”The tribute didn’t end there. WNBA Hall of Famer Lisa Leslie, who handed the franchise’s leadership to Parker in 2008, praised her successor with heartfelt emotion. “She changed the game.

Reflecting on her journey, she said, “It’s super important to see this jersey in the rafters before any others because my 13 years here were super special. It was ups, downs, wins, losses, heartaches and rewards, but it’s super special to share that with my teammates and coaches with an organization that bet on me with the first pick in the 2008 WNBA Draft.

Golden State Warriors lead Giannis Antetokounmpo’s chase

How the deal could happen and what it means for both teams

The NBA offseason is officially underway, and fans are already watching closely. Some teams are expected to make big moves in the coming weeks. Free agency talks are heating up, and trade rumors are surfacing across the league. One of the biggest names in the NBA is now being linked to a major franchise out West. As teams prepare for next season, this story is quickly becoming the talk of the league.According to a recent report that began circulating on June 29, the Golden State Warriors have become the leading challengers to obtain Giannis Antetokounmpo from the Milwaukee Bucks. The news was divided by X by @butlerllmuse, a reliable NBA tracking account known for posting early trade development.Giannis Antetokounmpo, who is 29 years old, has played for the Milwaukee Bucks since he was drafted in 2013. He is a two-time NBA MVP and led the Bucks to their first championship in 50 years back in 2021.The report does not confirm a final agreement, but says the Golden State Warriors are actively exploring trade options to bring Giannis to San Francisco. The Bucks, on the other hand, may be entering a new phase after falling short in the playoffs this past season.If a trade happens, it would likely include a big return to the Milwaukee Bucks. This could involve names like Andrew Wiggins, Jonathan Kuminga, and future draft picks. The Warriors’ front office, led by general manager Mike Dunleavy Jr., is reportedly looking for ways to keep Stephen Curry in championship contention. Adding a player like Giannis would change the future of the franchise.On the Bucks' side, the team may be forced to rebuild. After their 2024–25 season ended earlier than expected, and with Damian Lillard also facing uncertainty, the Bucks may decide to reshape their roster.In an earlier interview from September 2023, Giannis told the New York Times,“I want to be in a place where I can win and stay competitive. If that’s not in Milwaukee, it has to be somewhere else.”That quote is now resurfacing online as this story picks up speed.The situation is still developing, but if the Warriors do land Giannis, it could be one of the biggest trades in recent NBA history.Also Read: Who is Malik Beasley's girlfriend?

Sydney Sweeney and Tom Brady take over the dance floor at star-studded celebration

Hollywood has found its latest triangle of intrigue—and it all went down at one of the most high-profile weddings of the year.

According to Radar Online, she was “the most sought-after person to be around at the Bezos wedding,” with one insider claiming, “Every guy that has been in her presence has talked about how stunning she is in real life.”The energy between Sweeney and NFL legend Tom Brady quickly caught attention. Witnesses say the two shared flirty banter at the hotel bar before dancing together until 2 AM. “He was all over the place,” reported TMZ, capturing Brady’s unusually loose and lively presence.While that may have been enough to send the internet into a frenzy, things got even more curious when Orlando Bloom entered the picture. The Pirates of the Caribbean actor was also seen on the dance floor, and the very next morning, the trio were photographed strolling through the romantic streets of Venice.Sweeney, dressed in a floral midi dress with black heels, was flanked by Bloom in a casual black outfit and Brady in a Los Angeles Fire Department T-shirt—further fueling whispers of something more than friendship.The timing adds another layer of intrigue. Sweeney reportedly split from longtime fiancé Jonathan Davino earlier this year. Brady has been single since his 2022 divorce from Gisele Bündchen.

Today, we celebrate Lanny McDonald… Lanny’s legacy goes far beyond the ice—his passion, humour, and devotion to the game have shaped the Hall and inspired hockey fans around the world.”McDonald’s off-ice legacy also includes countless acts of character and resilience.

Surviving thanks to quick medical action, he went on to undergo quadruple bypass surgery—and returned to work like nothing happened.That kind of grit defined him.

This year, the event will be held in Petco Park, making it the first-ever Survivor Series event to be held in an outside venue, as well as the first to be held in a stadium. Wrestlers from both the RAW and SmackDown divisions of the company will be in attendance, hoping to make it an eventful night for the fans.Also Read: Is WWE Hall of Famer Trish Stratus returning for WWE Evolution 2?-Exploring possibilities","Wwe officially announced the 2025 survivor series: wargames on june 30.

Watt. Source: X

In December last year, Steelers star T.J. Watt suffered an ankle injury late as Pittsburgh lost to the Philadelphia Eagles. Watt sustained the injury in the fourth quarter when he was rushing around the edge against Eagles’ Lane Johnson. But Watt could very well be back in form in a few weeks time, if insiders are to be believed.On Sunday's episode of SportsCenter, analyst Jeremy Fowler claimed that the Watt can not only regain his form but also come up as the title of highest-paid defender, which is currently held by the Browns' DE Myles Garrett.T.J Watt poised to be the true comeback kid as per NFL insiders""Steelers, I’m sensing are optimistic they can reach a deal with Watt eventually,"" Fowler said. ""My sense is that he will probably be the highest-paid pass-rusher in the league when this is all said and done. He wants to be a Steeler for life, the Steelers want that, he’s a legacy-type player.""They believe at 30 years old he still has several good years left. They’re just gonna have to come up with a number and a good guarantee structure. He did miss minicamp, so Pittsburgh has a lot of work to do. But typically, Pittsburgh perks up in these things around training camp and late July,” Fowler added.Last week, another NFL insider, Jesse Palmer, said during a talk show that TJ Watt may soon become the NFL's highest-paid defender, according to reports he had been hearing.Palmer also shed some light on Watt's contract negotiations with the Steelers and how it could be a particularly famous record held by Myles Garrett.""I'm hearing there's a chance Watt gets past [$40 million],"" Palmer said. ""Which is something we're really keeping an eye on, right? If he gets that $40 million a year, at the age he is at, he has every right to ask for it. I've talked on here a lot about the comparison between him and Myles Garrett. The numbers are almost identical in every aspect. … [Watt] has the right to try and get that.""Sports writers Destin Adams and Kyle Crabbs also addressed Watt’s future in the league and broke down why he’s so valuable as a player. “Watt's one of the league's best pure pass rushers, and he had 19 sacks as recently as 2023,” Crabbs wrote.Adams shared, “If the Steelers' secondary can be better this year, I think Watt should be the odds-on favorite to lead the league in sacks as well as to win Defensive Player of the Year. The biggest hurdle still remaining is getting his new contract figured out so there are no distractions in his way come the regular season, but I'd be surprised if the two sides aren't able to come to an agreement before training camp concludes”","As per reports, multiple teams are interested in trade for steelers' t.j. watt.

Angel Reese brings her A-game on the court

Angel Reese is undeniably one of the most fashion-conscious players in the WNBA at present. She is, in fact, called Bayou Barbie for how she adds glamour to a game that’s more about power and sweat on the court. But off it, Reese knows how to steal all the attention with her carefully picked outfits for her tunnel walks. Not just outfits — the Chicago Sky power forward is also known for her ever-changing hairstyles and, on top of everything, the attitude she possesses that adds to her style.Angel Reese treats the tunnel as her runway, though she has expressed her desire to do a ramp walk at a real fashion show in the future. And every time she appears at a stadium for a basketball game, she makes sure her fashion appearance is already making her fans sit up and take notice.Her recent pre-game appearances are already setting the buzz with her one-liners. “I am exactly who I think I am,” she wrote with a video of her in a black trench coat, dark shades, and a matching fur scarf covering her entire forehead on her way to a game. Days before, it was a different hairstyle — and even before that, another.The 23-year-old was on the cover of Vogue this year. Opening up about being known for her fashion sense, Angel Reese told the magazine in an interview, “It’s always been both: basketball and fashion.But I was a fashion girlie from young too. I was always in my mom’s closet, putting on her stuff. I liked to carry a purse. Hair done. I wanted to look put together. I still do.”“I used to watch America’s Next Top Model with Tyra and practice my walk in the living room,” she said, while talking about her love for modeling and fashion since a young age.Reese recently also walked the red carpet at the MET Gala in a quirky black gown.Even before she made it to her first Draft, Angel Reese had debuted as a Sports Illustrated Swimsuit model in its 2023 issue.Angel Reese is as much known for her game as she is for her fashion sense. She was the 7th overall pick in the 1st round of the 2024 WNBA Draft. In her debut year, she was named the WNBA All-Star and also set a single-season record in rebounds.

Why the New York Islanders are betting on Alexander Romanov with an eight-year, $6.25 million-per-season commitment

How Alexander Romanov transformed from a Montreal Canadiens prospect to a key New York Islanders defender

Why Alexander Romanov’s eight-year deal could redefine the New York Islanders’ future

When the New York Islanders announced on Monday that Alexander Romanov had signed an eight-year contract extension, they weren’t just making another offseason move—they were making a clear statement about their future. Romanov, 25, has become one of the team’s most reliable and physical defensemen since arriving from Montreal in 2022, leading the Islanders in blocked shots last season. As Canadiens general manager Kent Hughes once put it, trading Romanov was “very difficult,” a sign of the value he’s brought everywhere he’s played. Now the Islanders are betting big that Romanov will anchor their defense for years to come.Alexander Romanov’s new deal, reported to carry an average annual value of $6.25 million according to Sportsnet’s Elliotte Friedman, is designed to secure the Islanders’ blue line deep into the next decade. Last season, he logged over 22 minutes of ice time per game—the highest of his career—while finishing with a positive plus-minus rating for the third straight year. He also tallied 20 points in 64 games, scoring four goals and adding 16 assists.Since joining the Islanders in 2022, Romanov has brought a blend of grit and reliability, leading team defensemen with 147 hits and pacing the entire squad with 165 blocked shots this past season.That kind of physical presence has made him indispensable on the back end and a natural candidate for a long-term commitment from management.Alexander Romanov’s path to New York Islanders started with the Montreal Canadiens, who selected him 38th overall in the 2018 NHL Draft. After playing two seasons in the KHL, he signed a three-year, entry-level deal on July 13, 2020, and debuted with the Canadiens in the COVID-shortened 2020–21 season, appearing in 54 of 56 regular-season games.Though he saw limited playoff action, Romanov still carved out a memorable moment by becoming the youngest defenseman in Canadiens history to score in the Stanley Cup Final on July 5, 2021. A year later, on July 7, 2022, Montreal traded him along with a fourth-round pick to the Islanders in exchange for the 13th overall selection in the draft—a move that Hughes described as “very difficult” but necessary to land centerman Kirby Dach.Beyond his NHL experience, Romanov has also shone internationally. At the 2019 IIHF World Junior Championship in Canada, he anchored Russia’s defense, finishing with one goal and seven assists on the way to a bronze medal, and earning Best Defenseman honors from the IIHF Directorate.Monday’s extension reflects the Islanders’ confidence in Romanov as a central figure in their plans, especially as they reshape their roster following the recent trade of Noah Dobson to Montreal. By committing to Romanov for eight more years, New York is investing in toughness, experience, and leadership on the blue line—hoping he will be the cornerstone of their defense for seasons to come.Also Read: Why pursuing Mikael Granlund could be a high-risk gamble for the Montreal Canadiens","Alexander romanov has signed an eight-year contract extension with the new york islanders.

Locks up a dependable top-four defenseman at a reasonable cap charge. Preserves roster consistency throughout a critical reconstruction stage. Gives a young locker room leadership and playoff experience.

Dante Fabbro's road to Columbus

In a league that values dependable blue-line depth very rarely, the Columbus Blue Jackets have taken a strategic move to fortify the defensive unit for the future. The team is leaning toward Dante Fabbro as their long-term prospect, whom they continue to consider more as a working option with some quiet efficiency and calmness of play to his name. Columbus wants to firm up its young nucleus and compete for a playoff spot, with Fabbro being the center of their current plan.Since Columbus purchased it, Fabbro has consistently established a position in the top four. He is commended for his ability to play important minutes against challenging opponents, his great defensive instincts, and his effective puck movement. In the previous season, Fabbro was afforded more than 20 minutes of ice time per game, recording 3 goals and 18 assists, 21 points in 74 games.His consistent performance assures the more aggressive Jackets' defensive players to join the rush, knowing they will be covered by a capable partner.In recent years, the Blue Jackets have struggled to assemble a reliable defensive core. The organisation may avoid losing Fabbro to free agency or a bidding battle in the upcoming summer by extending him now. Additionally, it conveys a powerful message of stability as Columbus continues to develop its roster around key players like Adam Fantilli and Zach Werenski.Columbus should sign this contract for the following reasons:Fabbro entered the NHL spotlight in the 2016 Draft when he was picked 17th overall by the Predators. Over the course of five seasons with the franchise, he slowly earned a regular spot on the blue line, showing promise with his mobility and defensive awareness. Upon being traded to Columbus, Fabbro immediately set himself up as a trusted presence on the ice. Now 26, with tremendous value, he stands at a crossroads in his career, poised to take on an instrumental role in shaping the Blue Jackets' defensive core going forward.Also Read: NHL Trade News: Maple Leafs avoid RFA drama, secure Matthew Knies with massive six-year, $46.5 million dealThe Blue Jackets and Dante Fabbro both benefit from this contract extension.

Poll Was Carlos Alcaraz's performance in his first-round match concerning? Yes, he struggled too much No, he still won

Carlos Alcaraz was forced into deep waters on Day 1 of Wimbledon 2025, battling past veteran Fabio Fognini in an epic five-setter to begin his title defence. The two-time defending champion looked far from his fluent best but still managed a 7-5, 6-7(5), 7-5, 2-6, 6-1 win after four-and-a-half hours of momentum swings on Centre Court.The 22-year-old Spaniard, fresh off his Roland-Garros triumph, committed 62 unforced errors and faced 21 break points in a match that tested his endurance and focus. “Vamos!” Alcaraz roared after breaking Fognini early in the final set — a set in which he finally regained control, sealing his 19th straight win in style.Aryna Sabalenka, meanwhile, made a confident start in the women’s draw. The top seed brushed aside Canadian qualifier Carson Branstine 6-1, 7-5. Sabalenka, who is seeking her first Wimbledon title after finishing runner-up at both the Australian and French Opens this year, credited recent practice sessions with Novak Djokovic and Jannik Sinner for helping her “understand and adjust better” to tough shots on grass. The Belarusian faces either Lulu Sun or Marie Bouzkova in the second round.In the biggest upset of the day, ninth seed Daniil Medvedev was sent packing by France’s Benjamin Bonzi in four sets.The 2023 semifinalist and former US Open champion is now out in the first round of back-to-back Slams, following a similar early exit at Roland-Garros. Despite his struggles, Medvedev brushed off concerns, saying he’s “not that worried… yet.”Elsewhere, Stefanos Tsitsipas retired hurt during his first-round match against French qualifier Valentin Royer, citing a back issue. The Greek star had won just 43% of his first serves and struggled with movement before calling time early in the second set.One of the day’s most exciting storylines came from Brazilian teenager Joao Fonseca. The 18-year-old, playing his first Wimbledon main draw match, impressed with a 6-4, 6-1, 7-6(5) win over local wildcard Jacob Fearnley to become the youngest player since Alcaraz in 2021 to reach Round 2 at SW19.Day 1 delivered drama, resilience, and a reminder that at Wimbledon, nothing comes easy—even for champions.","Carlos alcaraz beat fabio fognini 7-5, 6-7(5), 7-4, 2-6 (6-1), 6-1.

Jasprit Bumrah: India’s Spearhead Locked In for 2nd Test?

South Africa's cricket team, fresh from their World Test Championship victory, has returned to Test cricket against Zimbabwe at Queen Sports Club in Bulawayo, where two debutants made history.Dewald Brevis set a world record for the fastest fifty in a debut Test innings, while Lhuan-dre Pretorius became South Africa's youngest Test centurion at 19 years and 93 days, breaking Graeme Pollock's 61-year-old record.The Test match, which falls outside the World Test Championship 2025-27 cycle, saw several regular South African players absent, creating opportunities for new talent to emerge. The team's decision to blood young players proved fruitful as both debutants delivered remarkable performances.Dewald Brevis, known for his association with Chennai Super Kings , demonstrated his aggressive batting style by scoring 51 runs off just 41 balls. His innings included three fours and four sixes, with his half-century coming in 38 balls, establishing a new record for the fastest fifty in a debut Test innings.The significance of Brevis's achievement becomes apparent when compared to previous records. While New Zealand's Tim Southee had scored a 29-ball fifty and England's Jacob Bethell achieved a 37-ball fifty on their debuts, both these performances came in their second innings.Brevis's record stands unique as it was accomplished in his first Test innings.The South African innings faced early trouble when the team lost their first four wickets for just 55 runs. However, Brevis and Pretorius formed a crucial 95-run partnership for the fifth wicket, steering their team away from difficulty.Quiz: Who's that IPL player? Lhuan-dre Pretorius's achievement holds particular significance in South African cricket history. At 19 years and 93 days, he surpassed the long-standing record held by Graeme Pollock, who had scored his century against Australia in 1964 at 19 years and 317 days.The partnership between Brevis and Pretorius not only rescued South Africa from a precarious position but also showcased the depth of young talent in South African cricket. Their performance demonstrated the potential benefits of giving opportunities to young players in international cricket.The timing of these achievements gains additional context considering South Africa's recent World Test Championship victory. While this match against Zimbabwe doesn't contribute to the WTC 2025-27 cycle, it has provided a platform for emerging talents to make their mark in international cricket.The absence of regular team members, while potentially seen as a limitation, has opened doors for these young cricketers to showcase their abilities at the highest level. The success of both debutants validates South Africa's strategy of nurturing young talent and providing them with opportunities in international cricket.The historic achievements by both Brevis and Pretorius at the Queen Sports Club have added a significant chapter to South African cricket history, particularly in the context of Test cricket debuts and age-related records. Their performances have set new benchmarks for future generations of South African cricketers.","Dewald brevis set a world record for the fastest fifty in a debut test innings.
