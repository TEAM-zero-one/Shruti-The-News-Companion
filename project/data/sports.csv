'We don't look at averages and stats': Gautam Gambhir on sending Axar Patel at No. 5

NEW DELHI: Eyebrows were raised when India announced five spinners in the team for the ICC Champions Trophy . Historically, the pitches in Dubai do not overly favour spinners. However, the venue has also just got done with the month-long ILT20 league which may have left the pitches tired and more amenable to spin. Predominantly, though, India’s spinner-heavy squad was chosen to lengthen the batting lineup, TOI has learnt.The trend emerging from head coach Gautam Gambhir ’s tenure is the inclination to have more allrounders in the lineup across formats. Gambhir has been vocal about the need to bat deep. Seambowling allrounders are a rarity at the moment. Hence, Washington Sundar too has made the cut along with Axar Patel and Ravindra Jadeja Interestingly, it was Gambhir who insisted on having Shivam Dube back in the ODI scheme of things by adding him to the list of non-travelling reserves, say insiders.Gambhir is someone who prefers to have more options in the playing XI. More allrounders give him the chance to be flexible. If India advance in the tournament, spinners are likely to play a greater role.The idea, according to those in the know of developments, is simple — play two steady finger-spinners who can bat well to complement either Kuldeep Yadav or Varun Chakravarthy . Kuldeep and Chakravarthy are seen as genuine strike options. If the pitches at the start look like they can produce big runs, one might see Chakravarthy in the XI ahead of Kuldeep. The majority of Chakravarthy’s wickets have come while the batters have been looking to push the scoring rate. Kuldeep is seen as someone who can deceive the batter in the air and lure him into a false shot, like he did against England in the last ODI in Ahmedabad on Wednesday.Also See: Champions Trophy Schedule 2025 There are other factors too. India have played two Asia Cups at the venue over the last seven years and never played more than two frontline spinners in the XI.Jasprit Bumrah’s absence and Mohammed Shami being rusty after a long injury layoff has played a part in India picking a spin-heavy attack which can compensate for the inexperience of the two new pacers, Harshit Rana and Arshdeep Singh. It will be interesting to see how India’s campaign unfolds on the Dubai pitches, which usually sport a layering of grass to prevent the surface from cracking up.",The trend emerging from head coach gautam gambhir ’s tenure is the inclination to have more allrounders in the lineup across formats.

"Taylor Swift avoids ""publicly supporting"" Blake Lively and fans have figured out the reason behind it",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/taylor-swift-avoids-publicly-supporting-blake-lively-and-fans-have-figured-out-the-reason-behind-it/articleshow/118286987.cms,"Image via Getty

Taylor Swift Has “Distanced” Herself From Blake Lively Because Of This Reason, Fans Say



Blake Lively Was Not Spotted With Taylor Swift At Super Bowl 2025



Taylor Swift, the billionaire pop star, has been in the news since she got booed at the Super Bowl last weekend when Travis Kelce’s team, the Kansas City Chiefs lost the trophy to the Philadelphia Eagles. Away from the Super Bowl drama, the pop star has also found herself involved in the legal drama between Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni. But now, the reason why Taylor Swift has “distanced” herself from Blake Lively is pretty clear, according to fans.Taylor Swift has remained pretty silent about the whole controversial situation and is yet to make an official announcement about it. It seems like fans have found the reason behind it.A fan took to X and wrote, “The fact that Taylor Swift, huge advocate of the womens movement, didnt support bestie Blake Lively speaks volumes. If anyone would support, know and have proof that Blake was harrassed it would be Taylor Swift. Talks, calls, texts...Yet Taylor didn't support it. Hmmm”Another fan wrote, “If my bestfriend who made me godmother to her children was in a legal battle over sexual harassment & retaliation, I would be standing ten toes down with her. I would not abandon her. The fact that Taylor Swift distanced herself from Blake Lively is damning enough.”While it is not confirmed why Taylor Swift has not been spotted recently with her best friend, Blake Lively, fans are pretty convinced that this is the reason behind it.For the unversed, Blake Lively had accused Justin Baldoni of harassment and Justin filed a counter lawsuit against Blake Lively and her husband Ryan Reynolds accusing them of defamation and trying to take over control of their blockbuster movie, It Ends With Us. Taylor Swift was named by Justin Baldoni in the lawsuit as he felt Blake Lively tried to “use” Taylor Swift’s power and influence to gain control of the movie.Many fans also expected to see Taylor Swift and Blake Lively at the Super Bowl held last weekend but Blake was nowhere to be found at the stadium. This was in complete contrast to the 2024 Super Bowl when Blake Lively was spotted cheering on Travis Kelce as she stood next to Taylor Swift. The two were also spotted hugging each other when the Kansas City Chiefs won the trophy last year.A few days ago, a source revealed to Page Six that “Taylor really wishes Blake hadn’t dragged her into this whole situation.” This might be true considering how Taylor Swift has avoided being spotted with Blake Lively.With the Chiefs losing the Super Bowl, both Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift have been trolled but have remained silent.Also Read: Hailee Steinfeld reacts as Josh Allen gets asked out on a date during their appearance at NFL Honors","Taylor swift has been in the news since she got booed at the super bowl last weekend when travis kelce’s team, the kansas city chiefs lost the trophy to the philadelphia eagles.

“The Mavericks, though, sit less than $200,000 away from the NBA's first luxury-tax apron … even after Davis waived his trade kicker upon learning that the Lakers were dealing him to Dallas for Doncic.”

Thehave been making bold moves to reshape their roster after trading Luka Doncic for Anthony Davis . Adding Caleb Martin from the Philadelphia 76ers was another step, but the team isn’t done yet. According to NBA insider Marc Stein, the Mavericks recently tried to sign formerbefore he joined the Los Angeles Clippers.Stein reported on The Stein Line that Dallas showed interest in Simmons during the buyout market.Stein wrote.Ben Simmons, a three-time All-Star, could have provided the Mavericks with much-needed playmaking and defensive versatility. While he hasn’t been the same dominant force since his Philadelphia 76ers days, his ability to facilitate and guard multiple positions would have been valuable for Dallas.However, financial constraints played a role in the Dallas Mavericks ’ inability to secure Simmons. Stein noted,Despite missing out on Ben Simmons, the Mavericks’ interest signals their intent to remain active in the buyout market. With the trade deadline behind them, Dallas is likely to explore additional options to bolster their roster for a playoff push. The team’s success will depend on who becomes available and how quickly they can integrate new pieces.Simmons’ move to the Clippers also sets up a potential postseason showdown between the two teams. If Dallas can stay healthy and add the right pieces, they could make a deep playoff run and possibly return to the NBA Finals.For now, the Dallas Mavericks’ pursuit of Ben Simmons highlights their determination to build a contender around Anthony Davis and Kyrie Irving .

Boston Celtics’ Jaylen Brown and WNBA Star Kysre Gondrezick Break Up

Boston Celtics star Jaylen Brown has split. The NBA champion confirmed his relationship with WNBA free agent Kysre Gondrezick in July 2024, setting the internet ablaze. Their romance blossomed into the spotlight after Gondrezick was spotted cheering him on during the Celtics' triumphant championship parade.In July of the year 2024, the player from the Boston Celtics made a notable appearance on the red carpet of the ESPY Awards alongside Kysre Gondrezick, who is a free agent in the WNBA, thus officially confirming their romantic relationship. This revelation came after she was spotted enthusiastically supporting him during the Celtics' triumphant victory in the NBA championship the previous month. Their joint appearance at the awards ceremony served to bolster the swirling rumors about their dating status. Furthermore, fans quickly recognized Gondrezick's presence as she stood by Brown's side, celebrating during the parade held in Boston to honor the Celtics' championship win that took place in June 2024.Although the official explanation for the breakup has not been made public, insiders indicate that a variety of factors may have played a role in this decision. The overwhelming media attention that often surrounds high-profile athletes can be incredibly taxing, leaving very little opportunity for personal space and privacy. Additionally, the rigorous schedules that professional athletes face, which include demanding training routines, extensive travel commitments, and relentless media scrutiny, can also place considerable stress on even the most resilient of relationships.Prior to her romance with Brown, Gondrezick was involved with former NBA player Kevin Porter Jr. That relationship unfortunately ended with a disturbing incident involving alleged assault. Porter Jr. was arrested and later pleaded guilty to charges stemming from the incident.ALSO READ: NBA Star Lamar Odom’s Own Father Wanted to End His Life?: Khloe Kardashian Exposes Major Details It's understandable that Gondrezick would prioritize her own well-being and seek a healthy and supportive partner.

Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift, who have been dating since summer 2023, may be making their red carpet debut this year.

Jake Guentzel's performance against Canada was a highlight of the tournamen

Tampa Bay Lightning forward Jake Guentzel scored his second goal in the 4 Nations Face-off Tournament , tying the game 1-1 against Canada in Montreal. Both teams entered the matchup with one win each, with Canada beating Sweden 4-3 in overtime and the Americans beating Finland 6-1 on Thursday.Jake Guentzel scored the game-tying goal in the first period of their 4 Nations Face-Off duel with Canada, sealing a 3-1 win for the United States, as he was present to pump his fists after the shot sailed into Canada's empty net. “It’s the best time to play as a player. It’s pretty easy to get up for these games,” Guentzel said. “Yeah, if you’re not getting excited for this, you shouldn’t be playing right now so this is just a lot of fun.”Guentzel's performance against Canada was a highlight of the tournament, with the entire Bell Centre crowd supporting him and his teammates. His efforts helped the U.S. secure a spot in the championship game, which will be held at TD Garden in Boston. “Not surprised at all. I watched it firsthand for a lot of years,” said U.S. coach Mike Sullivan, who coached Guentzel with the Pittsburgh Penguins from 2016-24.“Jake is a high-stakes player. He plays his very best when it means the most and I don't think there's a stage big enough for him. He thrives in these types of environments. He's such a smart hockey player. He plays on both sides of the puck. I'm not surprised at all.”Guentzel, a key player for the Penguins, contributed significantly to their Stanley Cup Playoffs victory in 2016-17. He scored 21 points, 13 goals, and eight assists, and has 33 game-winners in the regular season.

Travis Hunter, a two-way star, has been listed as the quarterback for the NFL combine

Travis Hunter , the 2024 Heisman Trophy winner known for playing both wide receiver and cornerback at Colorado, has been officially listed as a defensive back for the upcoming NFL Scouting Combine . Despite excelling on both offense and defense, this suggests that NFL scouts see his future primarily as a cornerback. However, he might still participate in some wide receiver drills.Travis Hunter had an incredible 2024 season at Colorado, earning multiple top awards for his exceptional play on both offense and defense. He became the first player to ever win both the Chuck Bednarik Award, given to the nation’s best defensive player, and the Fred Biletnikoff Award, which recognizes the top wide receiver. In addition, he won the Walter Camp Award as the national player of the year.Hunter played more snaps than any other player in college football, showing his versatility by excelling on both sides of the ball. Offensively, he caught 92 passes for 1,152 yards and 14 touchdowns, while defensively, he made 32 tackles and intercepted four passes. His all-around dominance led to him winning the Heisman Trophy, cementing his place as one of the most dynamic players in college football history.Travis Hunter has made it clear that he wants to play both wide receiver and cornerback in the NFL. However, being officially listed as a defensive back for the upcoming NFL Scouting Combine suggests that scouts and teams see his future primarily on defense.

Pittsburgh Steelers Have Eyes On Los Angeles Rams' QB Matthew Stafford,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/pittsburgh-steelers-have-eyes-on-los-angeles-rams-qb-matthew-stafford/articleshow/118304112.cms,"(Image via Getty)

Anyway, the Pittsburgh Steelers may bid goodbye to Russell Wilson and go for Los Angeles Rams star quarterback and Kelly Stafford's husband, Matthew Stafford

Steelers QB Rumors Take Wild Turn

The Steelers may be preparing for another reset for their quarterback room, as both Russell Wilson and

Justin Fields

are looking for new deals. Things aren't exactly peachy in Pittsburgh right now. No one cares that Mike Tomlin hadn't registered a losing season in 18 straight years with the Steelers because Pittsburgh hasn't won a playoff game since 2016.

The Steelers have lost six straight postseason matchups and have allowed at least 28 points in all six of those losses. It's the longest such streak in NFL history! What's the best option for Pittsburgh at the quarterback? Trading up in the draft and hoping Cam Ward or Shedeur Sanders is the answer? Probably not. Do the Steelers want to enter the bidding war for Sam Darnold? Or take a flier on the 41-year-old

Aaron Rodgers

? Maybe Stafford is the best option- if he's made available.

Who will it be for the Pittsburgh Steelers? Jets QB Aaron Rodgers or Rams QB Matthew Stafford?

Would the Rams be crazy to trade QB Matthew Stafford? | NFL | THE FACILITY

Prior to Super Bowl week, and knowing things weren't perfect between Wilson and the team, I thought Wilson loomed as a tread-water type of option for the Steelers if other efforts failed in 2025.

But seeing the pro-Wilson narrative on the '25 pushed through? I don't think that's going over great inside that building. Meanwhile, the team would love to keep working with Fields. I just don't think they'll hand him the starting job. So the idea of Aaron Rodgers or Stafford could appeal to the Steelers. If that doesn't work, I think Pittsburgh looks at Fields with someone there to compete with him.

Los Angeles Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford is 37 years old, New York Jets quarterback is 41 years old, and Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Russell Wilson is 36 years old

Stephen A. Smith FLOATS the idea of Aaron Rodgers to the Steelers?! | First Take

I just think that we have kind of overrated Matthew Stafford a little bit since the Super Bowl victory. He's been good, but this year, he is starting to show his age. At the end of the day, if you're in Pittsburgh, you have to have a lot of things great around you for Matthew Stafford to have success. And I think that's where they're not standing right now.

If it's not QB Russell Wilson and QB Justin Fields, then is it QB Matthew Stafford for the Pittsburgh Steelers?

Evaluating potential trades for Matthew Stafford this offseason | Are these trades viable?

The Steelers need a quarterback and aren't within range of drafting a young signal-caller in what is, by all accounts, a thin draft class at the position. So, instead of trying to run it back with Russell Wilson and/or Justin Fields, they make a splash by adding Stafford to contend in the AFC North.

1972 Summit Series: A Defining Moment in Hockey



'Man of the Year' Award Recipient -- 1972 Team Canada Summit Series

NHL Alumni Celebrate the Legacy of the Summit Series of 1972



This team of 1972 officially called themselves the most defining moment in the history of hockey. Now, they have been chosen as the NHL Alumni Association 's 'Man of the Year'. Their victory over the Soviet Union under the circumstances of the Cold War transcended all borders previously alleged for sports. Stadium records will be permanent milestones in the culture of Canada. Members of Team Canada’s 1972 Summit Series team were honoured in Montreal on Friday. An award signifies more than achievement on the ice but also proves to be a legacy in the nation's identity of hockey and recognition worldwide.The Canada Summit Series constituted a watershed moment in hockey when history was enacted in 1972 through an eight-game series against the Soviet Union that transcended sports into cultural significance. As it began, the Soviets were surprisingly in the lead, but Team Canada was working toward victory, led by such legends as Phil Esposito, Paul Henderson , and Yvan Cournoyer. The last moments of Game 8 are unforgettable to this day, marked by Henderson's game-winning goal that ushered in the Canadian victory.“For many Canadians, the 1972 Summit Series remains one of the most iconic moments in our nation’s history. The team’s resilience, unity, and patriotism during their dramatic victory over the Soviet Union have solidified their place as national heroes in the hearts of Canadians from coast to coast to coast,” said Glenn Healy, president and executive director of the NHLAA in a statement.Where the win of Team Canada is a triumph of athletics, it became a celebration of national pride and the rallying point for the Canadians to unify and persist through a politically dire time. Their win is credited with establishing hockey in Canada and further cementing the game as a state of mind of Canadian identity.The NHL Alumni Association’s ‘Man of the Year’ Award is usually conferred upon those who are paragons of excellence both on the ice and off. By recognizing a team as a whole, the association is instead stressing the team spirit and historical importance of the 1972 squad this year.Glenn Healy, president of the NHLAA, commented, “The 1972 Summit Series team defined what it was to be a Canadian hockey player. From their grit, determination, and heart, they inspired generations of players and fans alike.” The role played by the team in cementing goodwill worldwide and promoting the game of hockey was also duly recognized.Also read: Why the NHL ditching its all-star game for international hockey could be the best move yet The 1972 Summit Series team’s victory has transcended time, ensuring forever a footnote in hockey history for them. This recognition by the NHL Alumni Association as 'Man of the Year' is a testimony to what they did not just on the ice, but also for Canada's very identity and the international recognition of the game. Their story continues to inspire generations, reminding contemporary audiences that true greatness is not only about winning, but also about the style, teamwork, and heart that characterize a true champion.

Team India cause unusual frenzy in Dubai ahead of Champions Trophy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/icc-champions-trophy-2025/team-india-cause-unusual-frenzy-in-dubai-ahead-of-champions-trophy/articleshow/118282148.cms,"TimesofIndia.com in Dubai:

Indian cricket team lands in Dubai for Champions Trophy | Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Gautam Gambhir all spotted | Exclusive visuals

Poll What Are You Looking Forward to for India in the 2025 ICC Champions Trophy? Strategic and Innovative Gameplay Outstanding Teamwork and Collaboration

India’s squad for ICC Champions Trophy, 2025:

Late in the afternoon on February 15, an unusual frenzy gripped the business class arrivals lounge of the Dubai International Airport. The word had travelled that the Indian cricket team was going to land shortly and plenty of fans had assembled to catch a glimpse of their favourite superstars. The area which generally sees passengers quietly make their way to the fleet of luxury vehicles waiting outside was buzzing with activity.Security officials were working overdrive when the flight carrying the Men in Blue landed on the runway. Few luggage trolleys were used to cordon off the area and the intensity picked up when the local police directed everyone to vacate the lounge area and head to the parking lot outside. There were loud cheers when head coach Gautam Gambhir led the entourage to the team bus. Everyone - from Virat Kohli to Hardik Pandya to Shreyas Iyer - acknowledged the fans while boarding the team bus.When the players took their respective seats, the waiting fans kept looking inside because captain Rohit Sharma was yet to exit the building. And when he did, there were loud cheers for the Hitman who walked briskly to the waiting bus and even summoned the security official for some instructions. Did he forget something again? Eh, not quite sure but you never know! The bus left the airport and KL Rahul, who made his way out at least 20 minutes after the team, took a separate car to the team hotel.Business as usual resumed after that and the usual calm was restored to the business class arrivals lounge. The ICC Champions Trophy 's first match in Dubai is still some days away and the buzz has naturally been missing in the city. And quite understandably so. Only India would be parked here because the rest of the teams will play their matches in Pakistan, the official hosts of the tournament. The teams allotted fixtures vs India will travel to Dubai and then head back as per the hybrid arrangement okayed by the International Cricket Council (ICC).The tournament gets underway on February 19 with India playing their opening match vs Bangladesh in Dubai on February 20. The large section of Bangladeshis residing here are excited to see their heroes in action and sound very optimistic on their chances too. The only question on their lips is ""when will the Bangladesh team land?"" and they certainly sound confident of taking a Jasprit Bumrah-less India down in their tournament opener.""I support Bangladesh and want them to win. It will be difficult but easier than before because Jasprit Bumrah , the dangerman, is not here. And we have good pacers. So it will not be an easy game for India as pacers do well in Dubai,"" said a cab driver who makes multiple trips to the airport in a day.""Pakistan is 50-50. They can do anything on their day but when it's not their day, they are a difficult team to even watch on TV (laughs),"" he added on the hosts' chances.Pakistan, the defending champions, will put their credentials to the test in the opener against New Zealand in Karachi.Rohit Sharma (Captain), Shubman Gill (Vice-captain), Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer, KL Rahul (WK), Rishabh Pant (WK), Hardik Pandya, Axar Patel, Washington Sundar, Kuldeep Yadav, Harshit Rana, Mohd.
