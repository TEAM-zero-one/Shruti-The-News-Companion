Lack of real match practice for India’s star batters Virat Kohli Rohit Sharma , and Shreyas Iyer could hurt India’s ODI plans leading up to the 2027 World Cup. The recent Perth ODI against Australia was a small warning sign.Kohli, Rohit, and Iyer form India’s top four, but all three are currently playing only one format. Rohit and Virat have retired from T20Is and Tests, while Shreyas Iyer, who has taken a six-month break from red-ball cricket, is not part of India’s T20I setup for the upcoming World Cup in February next year.The Indian cricket team was slated to play 27 ODIs according to the ICC’s Future Tours Program (FTP) 2023–27. The three-match ODI series against Bangladesh, which was scheduled for August, has been postponed, and the first ODI at Perth was not a promising start for India’s quest for the 2027 ODI World Cup. Rohit, Virat, and Shreyas lasted just 46 balls between them, managing only 19 runs.Rohit and Virat were playing a competitive match after a gap of five months and looked rusty. Meanwhile, Shreyas, who has played for India A and in the Duleep Trophy, had his technical flaws exposed again. Both Josh Hazlewood and Mitchell Starc, who stand six feet six inches tall, have a high release point of almost 2.15 metres (nearly 7.05 feet).Whatever length they bowled, the duo generated extra bounce, with almost every ball hitting the top half of the bat. Perth was a bouncy track, and India’s top order looked all at sea.The ball that dismissed Rohit Sharma wasn’t particularly short, but it rose sharply to armpit height outside the off-stump, striking the upper portion of Rohit’s bat. He could have left it alone, but ended up poking at it. The unexpected bounce surprised him; yet it wasn’t due to the pitch — it was Hazlewood’s skill that gave it its sting.Virat Kohli, who registered his first duck on Australian soil, was also troubled by that length. Starc and Hazlewood had troubled Kohli in the past too. In 10 ODI innings, Hazlewood had dismissed Kohli five times — averaging a wicket every second innings. But it was Hazlewood’s new-ball partner, Starc, who sent Kohli back. Kohli went for a booming shot, chasing the ball away from his body, and Cooper Connolly, patrolling at backward point, took a spectacular catch. It was a shot born out of desperation to get off the mark, which we have rarely seen from Kohli in a format where he is an undisputed king.Meanwhile, Shreyas Iyer’s struggles against short-pitched balls are well documented. The newly appointed ODI vice-captain had been prolific in the last two 50-over ICC tournaments. In the Champions Trophy earlier this year, he was India’s leading run-getter with 243 runs in five innings. Iyer had hammered 530 runs during the 2023 ODI World Cup.He had been pivotal in India’s success in both tournaments, but in Perth, Hazlewood exposed a chink in Shreyas’ armour again. Relentless Hazlewood denied Shreyas any width, hitting the deck hard and creating an angle from a good length, which tangled Shreyas up. As he tried to adjust and negate the extra bounce, rising around his ribs, the ball ended up brushing his gloves.The three dismissals have raised eyebrows as the next World Cup will be held in South Africa, where pitches will be bouncy. India will play only two away ODI series to tackle the bounce factor: the ongoing three-match series against world champions Australia, and another against England in July 2026. However, the spice in English pitches has lessened, as it doesn’t suit their “Bazball” approach.In the case of Shreyas, he is playing for India A and, after taking a break from four-day cricket, will likely be available for Mumbai in the Vijay Hazare Trophy. But the big question is whether the two senior stars, Kohli and Rohit, will play domestic 50-over tournaments to stay match-ready. It doesn’t matter how hard they train in the nets; having played enough cricket, they know there is no substitute for real match scenarios.Since Rohit and Virat now play only one format, their rustiness was visible in the first outing. Playing just the IPL won’t guarantee them a spot in India’s 2027 ODI World Cup squad. If they want to pursue their broken November 19 dream and win the trophy in South Africa, they must play domestic cricket to stay match-fit. If they choose not to, they are doing a disservice to Indian cricket and their own reputations.After India’s Test series win against West Indies in New Delhi, coach Gautam Gambhir was asked , “Are Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli still part of India’s plans for the 2027 World Cup?”Gambhir said: “Look, the 50-over World Cup is still two-and-a-half years away, and it is very important to stay in the present. Obviously, they are quality players; their experience will be invaluable in Australia as well. Hopefully, those two will have a successful tour, and more importantly, the team will have a successful series.”Gambhir may have dodged the big question, but he knows the clock is ticking. If he and Shubman Gill want India to take a step forward in 2027, they will need their ageing superstars match-ready. If not, India must blood talents like Yashasvi Jaiswal and Tilak Verma, giving them limited matches to prepare for the 2027 ODI World Cup.","Rohit sharma, virat kohli and shreyas iyer produced paltry returns in the first odi vs australia in perth. All three are currently playing only one format for india. Lack of real match practice could hurt india’s odi plans leading up to the 2027 world cup.

Jason Kelce stands firm on retirement as family life takes center stage

Kylie Kelce is known for her humor, honesty, and no-nonsense approach to life and that includes how she managed her husband Jason Kelce’s on-field temperament during his NFL career. The wife of the retired Philadelphia Eagles center recently opened up on her Not Gonna Lie podcast about the one rule she made absolutely clear to Jason during his playing days, a rule that had everything to do with keeping their bank account safe from league fines.Speaking on the October 23 episode, the 33-year-old revealed her long-standing “pep talk” before every game. “What I did often, often remind him, was that if a fight broke out, that he better keep all 10 of his piggy toes on the outside of that field,” Kylie said.She added, “Because you wanna know another way they pop you? If you so much as step a foot onto that field when you were not previously on that field, while there is a fight happening, even if you went out there to break it up: Fine. Fine dollars out of your pocket into the NFL's.”Kylie, now a mother of four, added with a laugh, “They don’t f**k around with that. They do not f**k around with that.” Her rule was simple, avoid the chaos, avoid the fines.And she admits her husband wasn’t exactly the “peacekeeper” type in those moments.She further added, “As much as I would love to say that Jason would be the one that would hop in there and be the peacekeeper breaking it up, you and I both know… I’m pretty sure he was going and swinging.”Jason, who officially retired in early 2024, reaffirmed on his and brother Travis Kelce’s New Heights podcast that he’s “not coming out of retirement.” Laughing about his physical limits, he recalled spraining his calf jumping rope last year ,a clear sign, he said, that his body’s done with the NFL grind.Now fully focused on family life, Jason and Kylie are busy raising their daughters — Wyatt, Elliotte, Bennett, and baby Finn, while juggling media projects and their growing fame. But as Kylie’s hilarious NFL stories prove, she was always the real coach behind the scenes, keeping her husband grounded, and sometimes, out of trouble.Also Read: Taylor Swift’s ‘obsession’ shocks fans as rumors claim she’s fixated on another star — and it’s not Travis Kelce","Kylie kelce revealed a unique pre-game ritual for her husband, nfl star jason kelce.

Former UFC champion Jon Jones has opened up about the heartbreaking loss of his brother, Arthur W. Jones III — a former NFL star and Super Bowl winner with the Baltimore Ravens — who died suddenly at 39 in early October. Sharing an emotional video on Instagram, Jon expressed deep love and gratitude for his late brother, calling him a “gentle giant” whose presence touched countless lives.In his moving tribute, Jon wrote, “In Loving Memory of Arthur W. Jones lll. Arthur was not just a Super Bowl champion but a father, spouse, son, brother, everyone’s best friend, a gentle giant whose kindness and generosity knew no bounds.” His words painted a vivid picture of a man whose warmth and sincerity left a mark on everyone he met.Jon recalled Arthur’s “love for the outdoors, whether it was duck hunting, fishing, or riding four wheelers with his family,” describing how “he brought pure joy, warmth and laughter to every moment spent around him.” The UFC legend also noted that Arthur’s compassion reached far beyond family, as he was deeply involved in community and charity work.Reflecting on his brother’s impact, Jon wrote that Arthur’s legacy “inspires me every day,” adding that their father, Arthur Jones Jr.,and their brother, Chandler, “are committed to moving forward striving to be the best versions of ourselves, just as he would have wanted.” Jon’s words resonated with fans who have followed his journey through triumph and adversity, showing a softer, deeply personal side rarely seen in the octagon.Jon concluded his post with a touching farewell: “King Arthur will truly be missed, he’s gone way too soon, but his spirit will live on in our hearts forever.

Pop star Madison Beer is entering a new chapter in her artistic journey, one that feels deeply intimate and reflective. The 25-year-old singer recently opened up about the inspiration behind her upcoming album Locket, which is set to release in January 2026. The project marks one of Beer’s most personal works yet, mirroring both her creative growth and emotional depth, something even her boyfriend, NFL quarterback Justin Herbert , seems to admire from the sidelines.During her appearance on The Travis Mills Show, Madison Beer explained that the idea for Locket came before she even began writing the songs. “When I went into this one though, I knew I wanted it to be something very personal to me and tangible,” she shared.“I don't know why but, my brain calls the shots and I'm just a passenger, so I was like ok, 'I'm going to think of things' and I wrote down a list of things that felt like they were a part of my life naturally... I really wanted something vintage and girly sounding and Locket was one of the words that was on there from the start. And I was like, 'I think this is the title.’”Her explanation reflected the same nostalgic and heartfelt tone fans have come to love in her music.Beer revealed that the songs came later and naturally tied into the album’s theme, which symbolizes cherished memories, much like the sentiment behind a locket itself. Even host Travis Mills noted she was wearing a locket necklace during the interview, a small but meaningful nod to her artistic vision.While Beer pours her heart into Locket, she’s also been seen supporting Justin Herbert during his NFL season. The couple made their relationship public when Beer appeared on the sidelines during the Los Angeles Chargers’ Week 5 game against the Washington Commanders, where the pair shared a warm embrace before kickoff.Though the Chargers lost that day, Herbert’s connection with Beer has been a bright spot for fans watching the duo balance fame and love across two demanding careers. As Locket nears release, it’s clear Madison Beer isn’t just creating music, she’s crafting a keepsake that represents her emotional evolution both on and off the stage.Also Read: Madison Beer relives heartbreak in ‘Bittersweet’ video featuring The Summer I Turned Pretty’s Sean Kaufman amid Justin Herbert romance","Pop star madison beer is unveiling her upcoming album, 'locket,' slated for january 2026.

MAGA outrage escalates as conservatives threaten counter “All-American” show

The NFL is standing its ground amid political backlash over its choice of Super Bowl LVIII halftime headliner, Puerto Rican superstar and Grammy-winning artist Bad Bunny . Despite growing outrage from conservative circles, Commissioner Roger Goodell made it clear that the league will not reconsider its decision.During a recent news conference, Goodell addressed the controversy directly, saying, “The NFL is not considering dropping Bad Bunny. It’s carefully thought through. I’m not sure we’ve ever selected an artist where we didn’t have some blowback or criticism.

For Goodell, it’s a statement of inclusion, not controversy and a recognition of how the NFL has evolved beyond its traditional image.However, Goodell’s decision has sparked intense criticism from the MAGA community. Commentators like TPUSA Live host Jon Root accused the NFL of being “out of touch,” writing, “No one wants to watch a subtitled Super Bowl Halftime show, from a dude that dresses in drag, makes demonic music, & who stated he wouldn’t perform in the US anymore because of ICE deporting illegal immigrants.”Root also claimed that Turning Point USA plans to host a counter halftime show featuring Kid Rock and Lana Trump.Despite the noise, the NFL appears unfazed. For many fans, Goodell’s defense of Bad Bunny is a rare moment where the league is choosing cultural authenticity over politics. With Bad Bunny’s immense global following and groundbreaking influence, this year’s halftime show may end up being one of the most-watched and most talked-about, in Super Bowl history.Also Read: “So proud”: Shakira praises Bad Bunny’s Super Bowl headline moment as a victory for Latin artists amid growing controversy","Nfl commissioner roger goodell has defended the decision to feature bad bunny at the super bowl lviii halftime show.

Dallas Mavericks lost the Texan Showdown quite terribly

Megan Thee Stallion spotted alongside Klay Thompson after opening match

The Dallas Mavericks opened their season with a home game loss to visitors San Antonio Spurs, losing by a big margin. At the last bell, the score stood at 125-92 in favor of the Spurs team, with Victor Wembanyama shining as the bright star for the visitors. For the home team though, things had a rough start, with Klay Thompson - who has become their de facto leader in Kyrie Irving 's absence, unable to make much of a difference in the game. Worry not though, his girlfriend - popstar Megan Thee Stallion was there for him after the game with a comforting hug.The Dallas Mavericks team have high hopes this season, having gotten the chance to get the No. 1 pick during the 2025 NBA Draft - Cooper Flagg. With the youngster, the team also has a couple of veterans in the play, including Klay Thompson, Anthony Davis , and Kyrie Irving, although the latter is out for the time being with an injury. The team looked promising and before the game, things looked to be in their favor, especially with home ground advantage.Unfortunately, none of it reflected during the game, which they lost to visitors San Antonio Spurs, by quite a high margin. Davis was their highest scorer at 22 points, while Thompson and Flagg both managed to score 10 points each. That proved to be a deficit against a team that had someone like Victor Wembanyama score 40 points and 15 rebounds, which meant the Mavs lost spectacularly against the Spurs.Hopefully they get it together before their next match against the Washington Wizards - especially Thompson, who has someone to cheer him up after that terrible opener.Dallas Mavericks guard Klay Thompson started dating musical rapper Megan Thee Stallion during the offseason. Now, a few months into dating, the couple are often spotted together, out and about as well as on each other's social media posts. Most recently, Stallion was spotted holding hands with the Mavs star after his team lost their opening match to the San Antonio Spurs.She accompanied the player while he talked to a couple of people after the match, before walking out of the arena hand in hand.

Toronto Maple Leafs struggle to replace Mitch Marner’s two-way impact

Mitch Marner's Top 10 Career Highlights

Marner’s success in Vegas highlights Toronto’s miss

Mitch Marner’s departure from the Toronto Maple Leafs is turning out to be a bigger loss than just losing a top playmaker. The summer deal, which sent him to the Vegas Golden Knights, has left Toronto searching for a proper mix, mainly in their defensive zone. While the likes of Auston Matthews and William Nylander keep on scoring, the overall team structure has become less reliable defensively. Marner’s contribution — in terms of both offense and defense — is showing to be a tougher task to fill in than commonsense estimates.There’s a tendency to point fingers whenever a sports team stumbles. But in the case of Toronto, instead of Matthews, Nylander, or John Tavares, the players under fire are those who are not even on the roster anymore. Mitch Marner is one such player who, through his absence, has cast a shadow over the current roster, as no one has been able to fill the void left by him.According to Jeff O'Neill, a former Leafs player and currently a TSN analyst, it seems like ""It feels like three Mitch Marner have left,"" which is quite a statement as it shows how vital he was in bringing balance to the team. Defensively speaking, the numbers of the Leafs have fallen alarmingly, which is why the team is letting in more than 3.5 goals per game, which places them among the worst in the whole NHL By the end of last season, Marner had established himself as one of the most reliable defensive forwards in the Leafs’ frontline, and he consistently ranked among the top in the league for takeaways and penalty-kill minutes. His instinctive play-reading ability and opponent disruption had often saved Toronto from getting into trouble. This year, the Leafs are encountering problems of odd-man rushes and collapses in defensive coverage that have already cost them some games.On the other hand, Mitch Marner has adapted perfectly with Vegas, and despite being a new player on the team, he has already contributed 10 points in the first seven games and has been one of the reasons why the team is still unbeaten in regulation. Vegas is the highest scoring team in the NHL at the moment, while Toronto is still looking for the right mix and chemistry in its redesigned squad.Craig Berube, the coach of the Blues, has recognized that the team is making errors that could be avoided, while Sheldon Keefe, the former coach of the Leafs and current coach of the Devils, has stated that Marner's two-way skills are unique and cannot be copied.Mitch Marner’s exit has deprived Toronto of more than just a superstar forward — he was a player who provided stability on both the offensive and defensive ends. Until the Leafs get back to the point where defensive play is their priority, their journey to becoming contenders again is still uncertain.Also Read: Connor Bedard’s life beyond the ice: Family and rumored love story behind hockey’s young star","Mitch marner’s departure from the toronto maple leafs is turning out to be a bigger loss than just losing a top playmaker.
