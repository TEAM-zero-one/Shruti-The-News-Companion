Colorado’s Spring Game set for April 19, nationally broadcast

Deion Sanders wants more than just a scrimmage



As many major college football programs move away from traditional spring games, Deion Sanders is taking a different approach at Colorado. While powerhouse programs like Texas, USC, and Nebraska have canceled their 2025 spring games, Sanders is doubling down on the importance of the annual showcase, ensuring that Colorado’s will not only take place but also receive national television coverage.Unlike Texas coach Steve Sarkisian, who prefers an NFL-style spring practice, and Nebraska’s Matt Rhule, who sees spring games as an opportunity for rival coaches to scout players in the transfer portal era, Sanders is keeping the event alive in Boulder.Colorado’s 2025 spring game is set for April 19 at Folsom Field and will air on ESPN2, ensuring the Buffaloes remain in the national spotlight. This marks the second time in three years that Colorado’s spring game will be nationally televised. The 2023 edition, Sanders’ first as head coach, was the only spring game that aired on ESPN’s main network, drawing an impressive 551,000 viewers.In true Coach Prime fashion, Deion Sanders isn’t just content with keeping the spring game alive—he wants to take it a step further by introducing a competitive element.""We got to sell this thing out and pack this thing, because the way the trend is going, you never know if this is going to be the last spring game,"" Sanders said at a press conference. ""I don’t believe in that, and I don’t really want to condone that, and I would like to play—I actually would like to play against another team this spring, that’s what I’m trying to do.""Syracuse head coach Fran Brown responded on Twitter, expressing interest in making Sanders’ vision a reality. However, current NCAA rules prohibit teams from playing against one another in the spring.Despite this restriction, Sanders remains focused on pushing for change. “I would like to style it like the pros,” he said. “I would like to practice against someone for a few days, and then you have the spring game. I think the public will be satisfied with that tremendously.”Under Sanders’ leadership, fan engagement in Colorado football has skyrocketed. In 2023, Colorado sold out its spring game for the first time, drawing more than 47,000 fans—an astonishing leap from the 1,100 fans who attended in 2022. Last year, the Buffaloes saw an estimated 28,000 fans attend, further solidifying the growing excitement around the program.Also Read: Aaron Rodgers could retire if his preferred NFL team doesn’t come forward with an offer: How it will impact the QB market As other schools move away from spring games, Sanders is not just keeping the tradition alive—he’s looking to elevate it. Whether or not the NCAA will allow teams to scrimmage against each other in the future remains to be seen, but one thing is clear: Coach Prime is determined to keep Colorado in the national conversation.","Colorado’s 2025 spring game is set for april 19 at folsom field and will air on espn2.

I would always love to follow it on the TV at home. I don’t think that Sophia has seen any of my vlogs, so yeah, she is like the number one ‘unsupporter’ over here.

It’s inspiring to see her reclaim her strength after such a tough battle.Fitness has become a central part of Isabella’s post-recovery routine, with Sophia right by her side. Their shared workouts are more than just a way to stay fit—they symbolize the strength and support that have defined Isabella’s comeback.

I want to feel normal. Nothing about my life right now is normal.'"" Sophia explained, ""I think something that I tried to do best was to make her feel normal.""

Is MLB The Show 25 available on Xbox Game Pass?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/esports/news/is-mlb-the-show-25-available-on-xbox-game-pass/articleshow/119168403.cms,"(Image Via - MLBTheShow’s “X” Account)

Will MLB The Show 25 be available on Xbox Game Pass?



What does this move mean for the Xbox Players?



The fans of MLB The Show were quite thrilled when the series made its debut in 2021 on Xbox Game Pass. It allowed the subscribers to play the game without any additional cost. The trend then continued with MLB The Show 22, 23, and 24. But now, as the series is closer to its latest release, the highly anticipated game fans, especially the Xbox Game Pass subscribers, are quite eager to play the game and wish to know how they can access MLB The Show 25 .While there has been no official explanation from MLB or Sony since 2021, it’s the first time that MLB The Show 25 won’t be available on Xbox Game Pass. So, the fans cannot play it, either at launch or during 2025. Breaking the series' 4-year tradition, the news has been confirmed by MLB and Sony that the game will skip the subscription services this year entirely. It will require the players to purchase the game outright. The official statement from MLB The Show 25 developers read, “The game will not be on platform subscription services in 2025.""The shift here likely reflects the evolving licensing strategies. The move has left the fans disappointed, especially those who got accustomed to the game access through the Game Pass Subscription. The previous titles, including MLB The Show 24, will be removed from the Game Pass by late March 2025 too. It signals the clear departure of the series from its early partnership with the Xbox subscription service.For the Xbox users, it means the gamers will have to pay $69.99 full price for the Standard Edition. They can even opt for Digital Deluxe Edition for $79.99. It comes with early access, starting March 14, 2025. The Collector’s Edition is priced at $229.99. It will offer the players additional physical goodies like a steelbook case and exclusive items. But it's a steep investment for most players.MLB The Show 25 absence on Game Pass raises questions about the game’s accessibility, especially for casual players who might not wish to spend $70 on a single game. However, the multi-platform availability of the game ensures that players on PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch can still enjoy the latest installment, albeit at the full price.","Mlb the show 25 won’t be available on xbox game pass.

The Golden State Warriors, fresh off a disappointing 114-105 loss to the Denver Nuggets, are in dire need of a scoring boost. With Stephen Curry struggling and the team shooting a dismal 24.2% from three-point range, the spotlight has turned to potential summer signings. One name that stands out is Philadelphia 76ers guard Quentin Grimes, who has been on an offensive tear, averaging 34.5 points over his last five games.Grimes, a 24-year-old guard, recently dropped 46 points against the Houston Rockets, showcasing his ability to perform against elite defenses. This performance wasn’t an anomaly. Since being traded to the 76ers on Feb. 4, Quentin Grimes has been a consistent scoring threat, shooting 53.2% from the field and 42.5% from beyond the arc. His recent form has made him one of the most talked-about players in the league.The Golden State Warriors are no strangers to Grimes’ capabilities. On Mar. 1, he scored a career-high 44 points against them in a 126-119 victory. His impending status as a restricted free agent this summer makes him an attractive target for Golden State, who are looking to maximize the remaining prime years of Curry and Jimmy Butler However, acquiring Quentin Grimes won’t be straightforward. The Warriors are tight on cap space, and the future of restricted free agent Jonathan Kuminga adds another layer of complexity. If Kuminga leaves for a lucrative deal, it could free up the necessary funds to pursue Grimes. But as of now, this remains a speculative scenario.Quentin Grimes’ potential fit with the Golden State Warriors is intriguing. As a career 37.8% three-point shooter, he could complement Curry’s playstyle, providing another reliable distance threat. His ability to create his own shot and drive to the basket would add a new dimension to Golden State’s offense.Also read: NBA Offseason Rumors: Golden State Warriors could acquire $94,500,000 Brooklyn Nets forward to support Jimmy Butler and Stephen Curry; perfect to form a Warriors BIG 3?

“Gafford doesn’t receive enough praise for his stable play on both ends,”

The Los Angeles Lakers are reportedly considering a bold move to bolster their frontcourt by trading star rookie Dalton Knecht for Dallas Mavericks ’ center Daniel Gafford. This potential trade, as suggested by Bleacher Report’s Eric Pincus , could address the Lakers’ ongoing struggles in the low post.Despite commendable efforts from Alex Len and Jaxson Hayes, the Los Angeles Lakers’ frontcourt has shown noticeable limitations this season. Gafford, an underrated but impactful player, could provide the stability and energy the team desperately needs. The 26-year-old big man has been a consistent performer for the Mavericks, averaging 12.3 points, 6.9 rebounds, and 1.9 blocks per game this season while shooting an impressive 69.9% from the field.However, Daniel Gafford’s recent knee injury, which may sideline him for the remainder of the 2024-25 campaign, adds a layer of uncertainty to the trade. His contributions to the Mavericks' march to the NBA Finals the previous season cannot be understated, albeit this setback. Gafford shot 63.4% from the floor and averaged 9.0 points, 5.2 rebounds, and 1.5 blocks per game in 22 postseason games. Dallas' success was largely attributed to his rim-running prowess, defensive presence, and contagious intensity.Pincus noted. While he may not be the most skilled center in the league, his reliability and hustle make him a valuable asset for any team.For the Los Angeles Lakers, trading Knecht, a promising rookie, for Daniel Gafford represents a calculated risk. Knecht has shown flashes of potential, but the Lakers seem willing to part with him to address their immediate needs. Daniel Gafford’s $40 million contract, while significant, could be a worthwhile investment if he returns to full health and replicates his previous form.This potential trade could reshape both teams’ rosters. The Mavericks would gain a young talent in Knecht, while the Los Angeles Lakers would acquire a proven big man to strengthen their frontcourt. As the offseason approaches, all eyes will be on whether this deal comes to fruition.Also read: NBA Offseason Rumors: Los Angeles Lakers could sign $11,128,042 Sixers shooting guard to support Luka Doncic and LeBron James Let us know in the comments if you feel getting Daniel Gafford during his free agency would be a smart move from the Los Angeles Lakers front office.

The IPL is the engine that drives India’s might in world cricket. Over the last 17 years, it has generated mind-numbing revenues besides being a talent-spinning tool in Indian cricket. Yet, it’s hard to dismiss the franchise-vs-country debate every time the IPL season comes around. Jasprit Bumrah ’s half-walk-half-hop run-up and Mohammed Shami ’s smooth approach towards the bowling crease may be a pulsating viewing experience, but there’s persisting apprehension over their fitness.India’s Test cricket is at a crossroads currently. With a five-Test tour scheduled to start 25 days after the IPL final, all eyes will be on Bumrah, Shami and other prospective pacers over the next two months. The window would have been shorter had India qualified for the World Test Championship (WTC) final.First things first. Bumrah is yet to obtain a fitness certificate from BCCI medical team at the Centre of Excellence (CoE) in Bengaluru. He hasn’t taken the field for India since he was forced out due to injury in the first innings of Sydney Test in the first week of Jan.Shami appears to have regained some rhythm during the victorious Champions Trophy campaign after having missed 14 months of cricket.There’s unease in BCCI over how the medical team has dealt with injuries in the last few years. The board is in process of overhauling its medical team once incumbent head Nitin Patel finishes his notice period this month. The concern is the medical team has been reluctant to be accountable while declaring a player’s fitness. It’s often left to selectors who are just told that the player is clinically fit. Whether the player is match-fit is not known.‘Workload management’ has been the catchphrase in Indian cricket in the last decade. Yet, the IPL becomes an exception when the players walk into their franchises. The franchises dole out huge money for two months of service. There’s very little wiggle room once the BCCI clears the players from its CoE (formerly the National Cricket Academy).It’s not just about Bumrah who is expected to start his IPL campaign for Mumbai Indians in the second week of April. There’s Akash Deep, who too is undergoing rehab at the CoE. Harshit Rana, identified as India’s next frontline pacer, has endured a long season going into the IPL.The core focus of workload management has revolved around injury management in the last three years. But the results of treating recurrent injuries have not been inspiring enough.When it comes to the IPL, BCCI’s role ends once they give all-clear to a player who had earlier reported with an injury. The franchise’s in-house medical team takes over once the players get into an IPL season. The question is, does BCCI lose all rights over the players? Not really.The introduction of standardised workload management SOPs and wearable devices keep providing all the data. The contracted BCCI players are given Athlete Management System (AMS) vests and the whoop bands (which are worn as watches on the wrists). These devices offer enough data about their physical activities, recovery and sleep cycle. The BCCI trusts its players.Bumrah, per se, has been through all kinds of rehab and training routines. BCCI’s medical team devises personalised routines according to data of a player. The players adhere to it and routines are usually shared with the franchise’ physios and strength and conditioning coaches.Sources close to India’s team management and selectors say they trust the judgement of a player whenever the player feels any kind of discomfort.“The players, especially the bowlers, are well educated. They understand what’s at stake for them. One has to go by the player’s instinct,” a BCCI source told TOI.For all the talk about whether a player of Bumrah’s stature should put his body through the thankless schedule of the IPL, the bottom line says it’s the BCCI medical team’s responsibility to ensure a player is always available to play if he is not injured.",Jasprit bumrah is yet to obtain a fitness certificate from bcci medical team at the centre of excellence (coe) in bengaluru. He hasn’t taken the field for india since he was forced out due to injury in the first innings of sydney test in first week of jan. shami appears to have regained some rhythm during the victorious champions trophy campaign after having missed 14 months of cricket.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119236327,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-58630,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Response To Kevin Durant’s Tweet Fest

Thevsdebate was a headline grabber. The NBA analyst called out theveteran amid the team’s struggle but Durant’s response to Bayless got widespread attention. It has been about a week and Bayless added salt to the injury as he called out Durant again in the latest episode of The Skip Bayless Show .NBA superstar Kevin Durant is no stranger to criticism, and this season, his performance with the Phoenix Suns has put him under intense scrutiny. Earlier this month, sports analyst Skip Bayless made a bold statement, claiming Durant looks “mentally semi-retired” and isn’t fully invested in basketball. Bayless suggested that KD’s lack of focus is reflected in the Suns’ struggles this season. Durant took to social media with a blunt retort. Quoting a clip from The Skip Bayless Show, he fired back, “F*ck it, we’re both washed, it was a great run.”While Durant’s response was dripping with sarcasm, Bayless wasn’t done. A week later, he doubled down on his stance, pointing to the Suns’ disastrous defense as proof.“So the other night Kevin Durant tweeted at me as he has, I don't know several times over the last what 12 years, but once again I'm not sure Kevin quite understood what I was saying about him,” Bayless said.He went on to add, “Kevin Durant can still score the basketball with anybody he's still averaging 27 a game and shooting 42% from three but that was not my point I said on this show that the more I watch Kevin Durant play basketball this season at a 36 the more he looks mentally semi-retired as if now his sole focus is on scoring on just playing offense one end of the floor.”He further questions the team’s struggles despite having several star powers including Durant. The Suns “now rank 27th of 30 teams and defensive efficiency 27th that all starts and ends with the man who still the best player on that team. Kevin Durant who now ranks 212th in individual defensive win shares 212th that's the main reason that Kevin Durant's team is now 31 and 37 and not even in the play in playoffs play in.”The analyst then responded to what KD tweeted back. He said, “Maybe I'm washed.” However, Bayless hailed Durant’s physical prowess as the Suns veteran is fit to do wonders for the team. “But I definitely don't think KD is physically washed his body looks great long and shiny as ever, no loss of quickness or spring that I can see or tell. I'm talking intangibles hunger burning desire to win to sacrifice to do whatever it takes Kevin won his MVP he won his two finals MVPs.”Bayless further shared that KD who once dominated international basketball, “now he just loves to hoop.”“I don't blame him but he just loves to score to play offense defense, optional. Setting a defensive tone for his team, optional. Leading, optional. Winning optional,” he added.Also Read: Kevin Durant Destroys Skip Bayless With Hilarious Clapback: Did He Just Call Himself 'Washed'?

"""That was the biggest thing for me"": The surprising reason Justin Fields chose the Jets over other NFL teams",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/that-was-the-biggest-thing-for-me-the-surprising-reason-justin-fields-chose-the-jets-over-other-nfl-teams/articleshow/119235033.cms,"Credit: Getty Images

Justin Fields Eyes Fresh Start with New York Jets Under Aaron Glenn’s Leadership



Why Justin Fields Chose New York 💚

BREAKING: Justin Fields Signs 2-Year Deal with the New York Jets

The New York Jets have secured quarterback Justin Fields in free agency, marking their fourth starting quarterback since 2020 as they gear up for the 2025 season. Fields, who played for the Pittsburgh Steelers last year, now faces the challenge of revitalizing his career with a franchise that has long struggled with quarterback consistency and overall success. Despite the turbulent history, Fields appears optimistic about his fresh start, largely because of the man set to lead him on the sidelines — head coach Aaron Glenn .Justin Fields' decision to sign with the Jets was heavily influenced by his relationship with Aaron Glenn, who previously served as the defensive coordinator for the Detroit Lions . Fields and Glenn faced off multiple times in the NFC North when Fields was with the Chicago Bears, and that familiarity played a crucial role in his decision to join New York.""I think, No. 1, Coach Glenn,"" Fields said when asked why he signed with the Jets. ""I've played against him early in my career. I know how passionate he is about the game, the way he coaches, the way his players play. So I think that was the biggest thing for me.""Fields’ stint in Chicago was marked by inconsistency and constant pressure to perform. After being drafted 11th overall in 2021, he posted a 10-28 record with the Bears, throwing 40 touchdowns against 30 interceptions while completing 60% of his passes. His tenure ended when the Bears drafted Caleb Williams, forcing Fields to find a new home in Pittsburgh. However, his time with the Steelers was brief and unsteady. After filling in for an injured Russell Wilson early last season, Fields was relegated to a backup role once Wilson returned, despite showing promise.Now, Fields hopes to establish himself as a franchise quarterback in New York. The 26-year-old recognizes the significance of Glenn’s faith in him, particularly given Detroit's recent success under Glenn’s defensive leadership.""Our relationship playing against each other means a lot because Detroit, of course, they've had a lot of success the past couple of years,"" Fields said. ""So for [Glenn] to want me here is definitely an honor, and I'm going to put it all on the line for him and do all I can to help this team be successful.""Fields’ arrival in New York also means reuniting with wide receiver Garrett Wilson, his former Ohio State teammate. The two shared a productive connection in college, and Fields will likely lean on that familiarity to ease his transition. Additionally, Chad Mougey, now part of the Jets’ front office, was in Denver when Fields torched the Broncos for a career-high 335 yards and four touchdowns in 2023 — a performance that undoubtedly left a strong impression.Fields’ dual-threat ability remains one of his most valuable assets. Last season with the Steelers, he completed 106 of 161 passes (65.8%) for 1,106 yards, five touchdowns, and just one interception in 10 games (six starts). He also rushed for 289 yards and five touchdowns on 62 carries, showcasing his versatility despite limited playing time.With 7,780 career passing yards, 45 passing touchdowns, 31 interceptions, and an additional 2,509 rushing yards and 19 touchdowns in 50 games (44 starts), Fields’ stats reflect both his potential and the challenges he’s faced. The Jets now hope Fields can follow in the footsteps of quarterbacks like Baker Mayfield and Geno Smith — players who found stability and success after early career struggles.Also Read: Travis Kelce shares a heartfelt compliment about Taylor Swift on his podcast For Fields, this opportunity with the Jets represents more than just another chapter; it’s a chance to prove he belongs among the NFL’s elite. Under Glenn’s guidance and with a more stable environment, Fields may finally have the platform he needs to thrive.","Justin fields has signed a 2-year deal with the new york jets.

Donald Trump administration freezes $175 million in federal funds for University of Pennsylvania over transgender policy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trump-administration-freezes-175-million-in-federal-funds-for-university-of-pennsylvania-over-transgender-policy/articleshow/119226616.cms,"US President Donald Trump's administration has suspended roughly $175 million in federal funding for the University of Pennsylvania, citing concerns over transgender participation in women's sports, the White House announced Wednesday.The decision follows President Donald Trump's February 5 executive order barring transgender athletes from competing in girls' and women's sports. The day after signing the order, the department of education launched an investigation into Penn's swimming program, focusing on transgender swimmer Lia Thomas, who last competed for the school in 2022.However, the White House clarified that the suspension of federal funds came from a separate review of discretionary federal money allocated to universities. The frozen funds originated from the department of defense and the department of health and human services.A spokesperson for Penn said the university had not been notified about the funding suspension.""It is important to note, however, that Penn has always followed NCAA and Ivy League policies regarding student participation on athletic teams,"" said Ron Ozio, Penn's spokesperson. ""We have been in the past, and remain today, in full compliance with the regulations that apply to not only Penn, but all of our NCAA and Ivy League peer institutions.""The education department's office for civil rights is investigating whether Penn violated Title IX, the federal law prohibiting sex-based discrimination in education, by allowing Thomas to compete. Thomas, the first openly transgender athlete to win a Division I title, swam for Penn's women's team before graduating in 2022.At the time, the NCAA permitted transgender athletes to compete under guidelines set by individual sports' national governing bodies, international federations, or the International Olympic Committee. Thomas met the requirements, which allowed transgender women to compete after one year of hormone replacement therapy.Trump's executive order, however, mandates that federal agencies can withhold funding from institutions that do not follow the administration's interpretation of Title IX—defining ""sex"" strictly as the gender assigned at birth.In response to the order, the NCAA swiftly altered its policy, eliminating the sport-by-sport approach and implementing a blanket rule that restricts women's sports to athletes assigned female at birth.The University of Pennsylvania is not the only institution under scrutiny. The department of education has also launched investigations into San Jose State University's volleyball program and the Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic Association as part of a broader effort to enforce the administration's stance on transgender participation in athletics.","The white house has suspended roughly $175 million in federal funding for the university of pennsylvania.
