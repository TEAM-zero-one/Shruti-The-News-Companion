EXCLUSIVE: India to boycott Pakistan in Asia Cup? Harbhajan Singh says, 'Khoon aur paani ek saath nahi beh sakte'

Poll Who do you think had the upper hand in the rivalry between Irfan Pathan and Shahid Afridi? Irfan Pathan Shahid Afridi It was evenly matched Not sure

NEW DELHI: Former Pakistan leg-spinner Danish Kaneria has stirred fresh controversy by backing Irfan Pathan ’s explosive revelations about his long-standing rivalry with Shahid Afridi , calling out the former Pakistan captain for resorting to personal attacks.Pathan, who enjoyed considerable success against Pakistan — with 67 wickets and 807 runs in Indo-Pak clashes — dismissed Afridi 11 times across formats, including a golden duck in the 2007 T20 World Cup final. Speaking to Lallantop, the former India all-rounder recalled how the rivalry turned bitter after Afridi mocked his identity in an interview.“Afridi had said, ‘I am the real Pathan, he is a fake Pathan’. Badtameez aadmi hai. Mujhe laga ki aap sirf mere baare mein nahi bol rahe ho, mere walid ke baare mein bhi baat kar rahe,” Pathan revealed. “So whenever I had the ball in hand, I made sure I dismissed him. I have shown him 11 times who the real Pathan is — in big moments, in series deciders, and in the World Cup final.”Kaneria, Afridi’s former teammate, echoed Pathan’s claims in a scathing social media post. “Irfan @IrfanPathan bhai, you’re absolutely right.He always resorts to personal attacks — be it on someone’s family or their religion. Class and decency clearly aren’t his strengths,” Kaneria wrote while sharing the interview clip.Pathan also recalled off-field flashpoints, including a fiery mid-air spat during India’s 2006 tour of Pakistan. “Afridi came and placed his hand on my head, messing up my hair. He asked me, ‘How are you kid?’ I said, ‘Since when have you become my father?’… Later, I told him, ‘He has eaten dog meat, he has been barking for a long time.’ After that, he couldn’t reply.”For Pathan, Afridi’s taunts only served as fuel. “On the field, my performances were the perfect answer. I showed him who the real Pathan is.”Kaneria’s intervention has reignited an already fiery debate, bringing back to spotlight one of cricket’s most infamous rivalries.","Former pakistan leg-spinner danish kaneria has stirred fresh controversy by backing irfan pathan ’s explosive revelations about his long-standing rivalry with shahid afridi.

NFL underdog Tyson Bagent shocks Chicago as the Bears suddenly boast the league's best quarterback duo,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/nfl-underdog-tyson-bagent-shocks-chicago-as-the-bears-suddenly-boast-the-leagues-best-quarterback-duo/articleshow/123365228.cms,"Tyson Bagent turns preseason into statement night (Image credits: IG/X)

From small-school shepherd roots to stealing the show in Chicago

How Tyson Bagent made Ben Johnson’s new offense look effortless

From internet cult hero to Chicago’s most unexpected quarterback threat

What Tyson Bagent’s rise really means for the Bears’ future and the NFL

The Chicago Bears’ 38–0 preseason demolition of the Buffalo Bills was expected to be Caleb Williams’ coronation at Soldier Field. Instead, Tyson Bagent—the undrafted quarterback from Shepherd University—delivered 205 yards and a touchdown, turning a routine exhibition into a reminder that Chicago may have the NFL’s most intriguing quarterback depth.Two years ago, Bagent was an unknown rookie fighting for a roster spot. On Saturday, he ran Chicago’s offense with precision, extending drives and punishing Buffalo’s defense. His performance wasn’t just impressive—it was proof that small-school pedigree doesn’t limit NFL potential. In a sport obsessed with draft status, Bagent continues to rewrite the script.What separated Bagent was how comfortably he worked inside Ben Johnson’s new system. Quick reads, crisp timing, and fearless throws downfield kept the offense flowing. “He’s confident, he’s decisive, and he makes the offense click,” Johnson said. The trust from a first-year head coach signals that Bagent is more than an understudy—he’s a reliable driver of this scheme.Bagent’s value extends beyond preseason box scores. In a league where losing a starter can sink an entire season, the Bears have security others envy.“With Tyson, we know we’re in good hands if his number gets called,” receiver Olamide Zaccheaus said. That kind of assurance makes him one of the most valuable No. 2 quarterbacks in football.Last season, “Bagent Mania” felt like a quirky fan movement celebrating an underdog. Against Buffalo, it transformed into something more serious. His composure and accuracy suggest staying power, and that could spark debates about how central he might become to Chicago’s long-term plans. He is no longer just a novelty act; he is a problem defenses must prepare for.Preseason often gets dismissed as a tune-up, but for Bagent it feels like a turning point. His poise and production have made him one of the most intriguing storylines of August. For the Bears, it’s a luxury dilemma: Williams may be the franchise face, but Bagent has shown the spotlight in Chicago can’t belong to just one quarterback, reminding fans that competition breeds confidence and depth, and that even in exhibition football, moments like these can redefine careers and reshape a team's long-term vision.Suddenly, Chicago isn't watching a backup complete-they're watching a story of grit and belief unfold under the bright preseason lights.Also read: Joe Milton’s inaccuracy is silently wrecking Dallas Cowboys receivers’ roster chances","Tyson bagent was an unknown rookie fighting for a roster spot two years ago.

Brandon Montour’s path to Milano 2026



After celebrating the pinnacle of his NHL career by hoisting the Stanley Cup with the Florida Panthers in 2024, Brandon Montour has set his sights on another dream. This time, the prize isn’t a league trophy but the honor of wearing the Maple Leaf on the world’s biggest stage. Left out of the 4 Nations roster earlier this year, Montour is determined to fight his way into Team Canada’s lineup for the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milano.The NHL season hasn’t even begun, yet anticipation is already building around Olympic hockey. For Canadian players, the Games carry unmatched prestige. With a roster so stacked in every position, only the absolute elite secure their names on the team sheet. That reality fuels Brandon Montour’s hunger.Canada has already announced its first six names: Sidney Crosby, Connor McDavid, Cale Makar, Nathan MacKinnon, Sam Reinhart, and Brayden Point. It’s a lineup that leaves little margin for others to break in, but Montour knows his window of opportunity lies in proving his worth on the ice.“I felt like I had the opportunity of making the 4 Nations team; unfortunately, it was not to be,” Montour told NHL.com. “At the same time, I think, for any hockey fan, it’s cool to kind of see the high end, you know, elite of the elite playing.It gives you the kind of thirst to feel like you could be a part of that.”That hunger is more than talk. Despite Seattle’s struggles last season, Montour showcased his consistency at the 2025 IIHF World Championship, tallying nine points. His performance didn’t go unnoticed, earning him a call-up to Team Canada’s Olympic orientation camp in Calgary this August.At 31, Brandon Montour knows that opportunities to represent Canada at the Olympics don’t come often. The blueline competition will be fierce, but he has shown both resilience and growth in recent years. “It was nice to get that,” Montour admitted about the camp invite. “I think I played well at the Worlds and, I mean, I think at this point people know what I bring. But to be recognized, it’s very cool.”From the heartbreak of being left out to the thrill of a new chance, Brandon Montour’s Olympic chase is a story of grit.

Fans recall Doug Gilmour as a warrior, a leader, and favorite Maple Leafs player of all time

(Comments via Doug Gilmour's X post)

Doug Gilmour became a captain after LA Kings' Wayne Gretzky eliminated Toronto Maple Leafs in 1993 playoffs

Doug Gilmour was called the “Killer” not for his altercation with Tomas Sandstrom, but for having a resemblance to that of serial killer, Charlie Manson. The ice hockey center played for seven NHL teams, but the Toronto Maple Leafs seem to be his favorite team! Why do we say that? The answer is in the headline! On August 19, Doug Gilmour shared a tweet on X: “One of the biggest days in my hockey career and one of the greatest honours 31 years ago today. 💙 #leafsforever #goleafsgo #ripburnsy,” with the 31-year-old image of Pat Burns, the then head coach of the Maple Leafs handing over the jersey to him.Reacting to this nostalgic moment shared by Doug Gilmour, fans went back in time and reminisced about the center’s playing days. One fan recalled the exact day when Gilmour was named franchise captain, “One of the best days in Leafs history for many of us fans.”Another compared him to the recent Maple Leafs players, “You were an amazing Captain for the Leafs. Pure grit & heart, something the Leafs have been sorely lacking.” A third fan wanted to relive those days, “It was the beginning of a great run for the Leafs and us fans, Killer! Wish we could do it all over again!”One fan said that Gilmour came to Toronto when they needed him the most, “Maple Leafs were a team searching for identity. What they got with Gilmour was a warrior, a leader, a legend. Forever my favorite Captain. 🐐.”Another fan thanked the captain, saying, “It was a great time to be a Leaf fan. Thanks for the memories Killer.” A third fan mentioned the 1993 Stanley Cup playoffs between the Los Angeles Kings and the Toronto Maple Leafs, “as a kid I have learned hockey by watching the epic series LA vs Toronto in 93. You were amazing! Best Leafs playoff of my lifetime.”But a fourth fan mentioned a heartbreaking fact, “Except you let Wayne Gretzky and his LA Kings get to you in 93 and that's what destroyed the Leafs back then.” What was the incident? What really happened between Doug Gilmour and The Great One? Let’s find out.In Game 6 of the 1993 playoffs, the Toronto Maple Leafs and the Los Angeles Kings had tied 4-4. In the first minute of overtime, the LA Kings’ ice hockey center Wayne Gretzky high-sticked the Maple Leafs' ice hockey center Doug Gilmour, causing Gilmour to fall to the ground after Gretzky had shot the puck.TSN Hockey Analyst Jeff O’Neil reached out to the then-NHL referee Mike Fraser and Doug Gilmour regarding this incident in 2017.The NHL referee at the time, Kerry Fraser, asked Gilmour about the incident. The center said at the time, “Gretz took a shot and his follow-through hit me in the chin.” The referee replied to him, “Well, if that’s the case, the follow-through of a shot is not a penalty.”Fraser noted his suspicion at the time, “But something just didn’t add up. Wayne Gretzky was always a guy who would be there pleading his case. He kinda moved off to the sidewalk. He wasn’t there to try and make sure there wasn’t anything going against him.”Fraser later reflected on the incident and confessed, “It was a reach, then clip. It was not a follow-through shot. It was a missed call.”With ten seconds left on the clock in Game 6, Gretzky scored an overtime goal and eliminated Doug’s team from the 1993 playoffs. However, Gilmore had an excellent 1992-1993 season, winning many accolades–1993 All-Star Game, NHL’s top defensive forward, and Frank J. Selke Trophy. The following season, he was named franchise captain! To this day, Gilmour celebrates the anniversary of being named franchise captain–31 years since that glory.","Fans recall doug gilmour as a warrior, a leader, and favorite maple leafs player of all time.

The NBA is a highly profitable league, and its players make a fortune. Over the last couple of years, several NBA teams have become the wealthiest through their on and off-court decisions. The last season generated a wholesome revenue, and all thanks to the teams that performed greatly in the league and its iconic players. The big league has been a lucrative market for the investors, brands, and advisors. The exceptional talent of the league’s most iconic players has made these parties gain interest in the NBA. From Michael Jordan to David Robinson, all of them have gained fame over the past decades in the league. Here are the names of the top 10 richest players in the NBA:Michael Jordan is the most iconic personality in the NBA. He is regarded as the greatest basketball player of all time. With a net worth of $3.5 billion, he stands at the top of the list. He has his signature shoe, i.e., the Air Jordans. He is a classic example of how an athlete can make a fortune through various brand deals, endorsements, and investments. His total NBA salary is $94 million, with his highest single salary being $33 million.With a net worth of $1.5 billion, Magic Johnson is the second-wealthiest figure in basketball history.His major contribution to the league had gained him fame and popularity. The former Los Angeles Lakers star has gained approximately $60 million from his brand endorsement deals, especially with PepsiCo. However, this NBA veteran could not continue his basketball journey for long as he announced his HIV diagnosis back in 1991. His remarkable NBA journey mesmerized his fans from all over the world.The current star of the Los Angeles Lakers, LeBron James, is the pride of the NBA. He is the third-richest basketball player in the history of the big league. What’s more surprising is that this Lakers’ star is the first and only player to have become a billionaire while actively playing in the league. LeBron James has amassed a wealth of over $1.6 billion, and only about $480 million came from his NBA salary. His net worth is valued at$1.2 billion. He was actively involved with major brands like Coca-Cola, Kia Motors, and Beats by Dre.One of the tallest players in the NBA, Shaquille O’Neal, stands fifth among the top 10 richest NBA players.

His major brand endorsement deals include those with Reebok, Icy Hot, and Gold Bond. He was actively involved with Reebok and was even the President of Reebok’s Basketball operations. His partnership with the brand has earned him a multi-year agreement of $19 million.Nicknamed “Microwave”, Vinnie Johnson played for the Detroit Pistons from 1981-1991. His net worth is around $500 million, making him the fifth-richest NBA player in basketball history. His NBA career-high salary was marked at $800,000.

With a total career salary of around $420 million, he is one of the highest-paid players in the history of the NBA. His net worth is estimated at around $300 million. He is the second player in history to have earned around $50 million in a single season. The NBA star has established “Thirty Five Ventures”. The Rockets star also started the media company Broadroom in 2019, which significantly added to his income.With a net worth of $300 million, Hakeem Olajuwon stands as the 8th richest man in the NBA. Similar to Michael Jordan, this NBA player began on a 6-year, $6 million rookie contract with the Houston Rockets. However, his retirement contract was only half of Michael Jordan’s pay. Due to this quite meagre income, he started to invest in real estate. By the time he retired back in 2002, he had purchased 12 downtown Houston parking lots.Grant Hill is the 9th richest player in the history of the NBA, and his net worth is estimated to be around $250 million.

Tom Brady is not just living up to his past glory through a giant bronze statue; he continues to expand his legacy. It’s no longer a secret that the former New England Patriots legend is trying his hand at a broadcasting career with Fox Sports, one of the most elite booths in the global sports realm. After struggling in his first year, the former quarterback is slowly and aptly adapting to the new role he undertook this offseason.

Michales, in a lighthearted interview, shared his stance about Brady and his highly discussed salary for Fox Sports.Is this really a small dig or something deeper along the line? Well, Fox Sports pays Tom handsomely, no doubt in that. The multi-time Super Bowl MVP has earned a total of approximately $332 million during his on-field career, which is still lower than his broadcasting contract price.So, you'd better do the math.Tom is widely celebrated for more than one talent. He an exceptional skills in the field, a magnetic personality, visionary leadership, and a sharp mouth to call the games. With numerous records like the most career passing touchdowns, passing yards, and Super Bowl MVP awards under his belt, he absolutely deserves the honors and awards, and most notably the net worth of $300 million.But the money graph doesn’t imply his he is doing pretty smooth financially. Yes, it’s nearly impossible to even think of Brady as a man struggling to get hold of his expenses. But sometimes, the GOAT can also feel some unexpected twists and turns in his path. In a playful, candid chat with Rob Gronkowski at the start of this year, Brady admitted that he fell short of cash sometimes. Although the conversation seems to be fun, the subtle hint of a financial crunch caught fans off guard. The athlete holds countless media deals, business ventures, endorsements, so to speak, but once a wise man said, Don’t judge a man’s pocket by his earnings, but by his spending. So, Tom gasping for a little bit more money isn’t far-fetched at all.","Ai michaels pokes tom brady's fox nfl salary as he enters his second season in the booth.

Zac Taylor wants one more win for the Cincinnati Bengals to end the preseason with a winning record

Cincinnati Bengals’ newest wide receiver, Mitchell Tinsley, has been making internet rounds ever since his breakout performance against his former team, the Washington Commanders. The 25-year-old wideout was signed by Washington in May 2023, but was waived in August 2024. Eventually, he joined their practice squad. The Cincinnati Bengals signed Tinsley only in February 2025. What happened next? He played against the Commanders and emerged as a knight in shining armor for the Bengals! Cincinnati’s head coach Zac Taylor certainly looked surprised, calling the wide receiver a “baller” and someone who “just works hard.”Mitchell Tinsley’s breath-stopping catches shocked everyone! But in particular, to add insult to injury, they might have stunned(likely stung!) his former team! Addressing the worldwide awe, Zac Taylor praised his newest wideout at a post-game conference, “Baller. Yeah, he just works hard. He’s become a guy that everybody really respects in the locker room. I don’t know that I’ve ever heard him speak. Maybe someone can get him tonight.He just goes out there and just works. And we respect that.He created the opportunities for himself. He’s done enough in practice to where we wanted to put him in positions to be at the point of attack when he was in the game there, and he rewarded himself with touchdowns and catches and extending drives, and someone that’s reliable for the quarterbacks in August.So just proud of him. This is the last team he was with, if I’m not mistaken, so probably a neat situation for him to come back on this field and do what he just did.”After the thrilling first NFL preseason game win, when Zac Taylor entered the tired, wounded, and extremely elated locker room, he said, “Okay, hey. Congrats on the win. It feels good to get it done. You guys worked hard for it. Defense, what I love, man–I know in the second half, you guys were tired. Okay, but you found ways with the 14-point lead to keep them out of the end zone–okay. Big stop. Big stop at the end. Gave the offense the ball back even though we didn’t score as much second half offense. I love the way we control the ball. Ate up the clock. Moved it.There’s some things we can improve, but overall, that’s a great team win. A lot to learn from. Let’s keep building on that. Let’s get one more. End the preseason with a winning record. Have some momentum going in the regular season. Okay. Ted Karras, go ahead and educate everybody on what happens next. Where are you at, Ted?”The 32-year-old center for the Cincinnati Bengals, Ted Karras, echoed, “Who Dey? Who Dey? Who Dey think gonna beat them Bengals? Who Dey? Who Dey? Who Dey think gonna beat them Bengals? Noooo–body!”","Mitchell tinsley was signed by washington commanders in may 2023, but was waived in august 2024.

🚨 Adam Schefter Expects Micah Parsons DIVORCE From Cowboys + ESPN On Trevon Diggs & Roster Moves

Jerry Jones’ drama tactics fuel Micah Parsons contract standoff, future in Dallas uncertain

What’s next for Micah Parsons and Cowboys

The contract standoff between Dallas Cowboys star linebacker Micah Parsons and the team shows no signs of resolution, raising questions about the linebacker’s future in Dallas. NFL insider Adam Schefter has suggested the two sides may be headed for a “divorce,” signaling a potential split that could shake up the NFL landscape.Parsons, who has emerged as one of the NFL’s top defensive talents, has yet to return to the negotiating table. Schefter told Unsportsmanlike, “Could a deal happen? Yes… there is zero indication that it is going to happen. It sounds like, at some point in time, whether that’s now, after the season, after two seasons, like the two sides are headed towards a divorce.” He added, “Today I feel comfortable saying I don’t think he’ll finish his career in Dallas. ”While a record-setting deal remains possible, the lack of progress has left fans and analysts wondering if this season could be Parsons’ last in Dallas. The situation has reportedly become personal, complicating negotiations, as Parsons has shown no effort to return to the bargaining table.Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, known for his flair for drama, may have intensified the standoff.Schefter described the unfolding events as a “circus,” noting that Dallas has a long history of high-profile player disputes. While Jones enjoys creating media attention, this time the tension with Parsons could have long-term implications for the team’s defense.Despite the standoff, a deal remains possible. Schefter added, “for all I know the two sides decide to sit down at the bargaining table and they hammer out a deal that makes Micah the highest paid non quarterback in NFL history.” But with both parties standing firm, the outlook appears uncertain.If no agreement is reached during this NFL season, the divorce between Parsons and the Cowboys could become inevitable. Parsons’ on-field performance, combined with the Cowboys’ negotiation strategy, will determine whether he remains in Dallas or seeks a fresh start elsewhere. For now, NFL fans and analysts are watching closely as this high-stakes contract drama continues to unfold.Also Read: Anthony Richardson’s injury setback leads Colts to turn to Daniel Jones for 2025 season opener The Micah Parsons contract saga promises more headlines, more drama, and possibly a seismic shift in the NFL if the “divorce” becomes reality.","The contract standoff between dallas cowboys linebacker micah parsons and the team shows no signs of resolution.

Brief Insight into Sophie’s Current Season

The’s 2025 WNBA campaign took another devastating hit on August 19 when the team confirmed that veteran guardwill miss the rest of the season with a right knee injury. Cunningham was hurt during the Fever’s overtime win against the Connecticut Sun, casting doubt over the team’s playoff push and further depleting an already battered backcourt.The injury occurred in the second quarter when Connecticut’s Bria Hartley drove hard to the basket and collided awkwardly with Sophie Cunningham’s right knee. Cunningham immediately crumpled to the floor in visible pain and had to be assisted off the court.An MRI later confirmed the worst: a torn MCL in her right knee, ruling her out for the season. While doctors expect a full recovery, the setback piles onto a growing list of injuries that has already tested the Fever’s depth and resilience.This was Sophie Cunningham’s debut season with the Indiana Fever following her trade from the Phoenix Mercury. She quickly carved out a role in the rotation, starting in 13 games across 30 appearances. Cunningham averaged 8.6 points, 3.5 rebounds, and 1.2 assists per game while posting career-best efficiency—46.9% from the field and 43.2% from three.Her defense, grit, and timely shooting were crucial for an Indiana squad that had already lost guards Sydney Colson and Aari McDonald earlier in August. Beyond the numbers, her fiery competitiveness and willingness to defend teammates—highlighted by an in-game altercation protecting rookie sensation Caitlin Clark —made her a fan favorite.With Cunningham sidelined, the Indiana Fever wasted no time in making moves. The team signed veteran guard Shey Peddy to a seven-day hardship contract to stabilize the rotation. Peddy, who last played for the Los Angeles Sparks under a similar deal, brings valuable experience to a guard unit hit hard by injuries.Meanwhile, Caitlin Clark’s return looms large. The star rookie has missed 13 games due to a groin injury, and her availability could make or break Indiana’s postseason chances. Sitting sixth in the standings, the Fever still face the league’s toughest remaining schedule, including three matchups against the powerhouse Minnesota Lynx.The emotional impact of Sophie Cunningham ’s injury has been deeply felt. Her sister voiced frustration on social media, calling out WNBA officiating and demanding stronger measures to protect players. Head coach Stephanie White also shared her heartbreak, pointing to both Cunningham’s visible pain and the growing toll on an already injury-ravaged roster.Cunningham, who turned 29 just days before the incident, responded with gratitude and optimism, thanking fans for their support and vowing to stay positive throughout her recovery.The Indiana Fever’s 2025 season has been marred by injuries, forcing constant adjustments and testing the team’s depth. Cunningham’s absence adds yet another hurdle, but also presents opportunities for unheralded players to step into the spotlight.Also read: Gabrielle Union, 52, Stuns in Bikini Photos on Instagram With Dwyane Wade During Summer Getaway For Indiana, the challenge now lies in maintaining momentum in a crowded playoff race.

Cleveland Browns turn to Joe Flacco as veteran leader



Shedeur Sanders and Browns’ depth chart uncertainty



The Cleveland Browns made their quarterback decision official on Monday, handing the Week 1 starting job to 40-year-old Joe Flacco. The move brought immediate intrigue—not only because Flacco is 17 years older than Shedeur Sanders, but also because it reshapes the Browns’ preseason quarterback competition. While Kevin Stefanski’s call settles the biggest storyline of training camp, it also sparks new questions about the future of the team’s quarterback room.Joe Flacco, who went 4-1 with the Browns last season while guiding them to a playoff berth, now becomes just the 11th quarterback in NFL history to start a Week 1 game at age 40 or older. His consistency stood out in training camp, where he was the only quarterback to avoid time on the sidelines due to injury.“Well, we all know how that works. I mean, that’s everybody in the league, but it’s not really my job to look at it in that way. It’s just to go out there and play my game,” Flacco said. “I felt like I was having a good camp with the reps that I was given, and that’s all you can do.”Stefanski praised the veteran’s command and impact, noting that the decision went well beyond health. “Joe performed really well, both in practice, in the joint practices, in the meeting room, you name it.What he’s able to bring to the football team, he’s earned that role,” the Browns head coach explained.While Flacco’s appointment solves one problem, it creates another: who will back him up? Kenny Pickett is still managing a hamstring strain but has resumed 11-on-11 reps. Dillon Gabriel, the 2025 third-round pick, continues to push for snaps. Meanwhile, Sanders—despite impressing with his professionalism since falling to the fifth round—remains limited with an oblique injury.That leaves the Browns in a rare position. General manager Andrew Berry must soon decide whether to keep four quarterbacks, something that has only occurred five times since 2000, according to Sportradar.Flacco and the first-team offense will see preseason action against the Los Angeles Rams this weekend, a dress rehearsal designed to simulate regular-season game planning. For now, the veteran holds the reins, but the pressure behind him is undeniable. Sanders, Pickett, and Gabriel may still shape Cleveland’s quarterback narrative in 2025—and beyond.Also Read: Daniel Jones named Colts’ starting QB as Shane Steichen dismisses ‘quick leash’ concerns for new season","Cleveland browns name 40-year-old joe flacco as their starting quarterback.
