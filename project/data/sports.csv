Charlie McAvoy’s struggle with teammate’s departure

Charlie McAvoy is feeling emotional after the Boston Bruins made several major trades before the NHL trade deadline. The team moved key players, including Brad Marchand to the Florida Panthers, Charlie Coyle to the Colorado Avalanche, and Brandon Carlo to the Toronto Maple Leafs. McAvoy shared his feelings on Instagram, posting photos and a broken heart emoji in response to Marchand’s departure.This isn’t the first time Charlie McAvoy had to say goodbye to close teammates. Last summer, he also expressed sadness when Jake DeBrusk and Matt Grzelcyk left for new teams. McAvoy’s reaction highlights how strong the bonds between teammates can be and how difficult it is to see friends go in the business of professional hockey.As for Boston, they acquired a conditional 2027 second-round pick, but here is the catch: “The conditional second-round draft pick will become a 2027 or 2028 first-round draft pick if Florida wins two rounds of the 2025 Stanley Cup Playoffs and Marchand appears in at least 50 percent of the team’s playoff games.”Boston is paying half of Marchand’s salary, making his trade to Florida even more shocking. With the Bruins struggling and a 4.2% playoff chance, change was necessary. Marchand hoped to retire in Boston, but a reunion in free agency is possible.During the NHL 4 Nations Face-Off in Montreal, Marchand and McAvoy put friendship aside, fully committed to their national teams. No greetings, no small talk, just fierce competition, game faces, and national pride.But hockey is unpredictable. When McAvoy suffered a serious AC joint injury and a shoulder infection that led to hospitalization, Marchand’s competitive edge quickly turned to concern. “I’ve reached out to him. I’m going to keep everything personal, but first and foremost, all you care about is the guy’s health, and I’m very happy to hear that he’s doing well,” Marchand put hockey aside, prioritizing McAvoy’s well-being over the game.Also Read: NHL Trade Deadline: The Boston Bruins are trading Brad Marchand to the Stanley Cup defending champion Florida Panthers Marchand’s fierce competitive spirit vanished the moment McAvoy was injured. In that instant, hockey no longer mattered, only his friend’s well-being did. In the end, friendship proved stronger than the game.","Charlie mcavoy is feeling emotional after the boston bruins made several major trades before the nhl trade deadline.

What happened to Karl-Anthony Towns?



Is Karl-Anthony Towns dealing with an injury?

The new New York Knicks star,, has been out of action, and NBA Alan Hahn has an update concerning his injury as the team is all set to face James Harden’s LA Clippers at the Intuit Dome, Inglewood, on March 7. The NBA star is also mourning personal loss, as per reports. However, the new report from the insider reveals that his knee is not in perfect condition for him to play any immediate matches.The Knicks have officially listed Karl-Anthony Towns as out for personal reasons without providing further details. While injuries are common late in the season, his absence does not appear to be health-related. Knicks head coach Tom Thibodeau addressed the situation before the team’s game against the Golden State Warriors, confirming that Towns would not be available but offering no timetable for his return.“When he’s ready to come back, obviously we want him back,” Thibodeau told reporters, per SNY’s Ian Begley. “But he needs some time right now.”Despite his absence, Towns’ father was seen courtside during the Knicks' 114-102 loss to the Warriors, adding intrigue to the situation. As the Knicks prepare for a crucial five-game road trip through early March, Thibodeau admitted uncertainty about whether Towns would travel with the team.Although the team has not linked Towns’ absence to an injury, there are indications that he has been dealing with lingering knee trouble. Knicks analyst Alan Hahn revealed that Towns has been playing through pain for some time now.“The knee is not good, but he’s fighting through it. He wants to play,” Hahn said, shedding light on what may be a significant factor in his recent struggles.Towns has been a major force for the New York Knicks in his debut season with the team. After being traded from the Minnesota Timberwolves ahead of the 2024-25 season. He is averaging 24.5 points per game— his highest since 2021-22— while also securing a career-best 13.4 rebounds per contest.Towns’ recent performances suggest that the knee issue has affected his game. Over his last three appearances, he has averaged just 14 points on 37% shooting.In Towns’ absence, the Knicks have turned to Mitchell Robinson, who recently returned from a long-term injury. The Knicks will need contributions from other key players, including Julius Randle.Also Read: NBA analysts Charles Barkley and Kendrick Perkins in war of words over media coverage propelling reaction from Stephen A. Smith: “Imma address his a** like the numbers on a house” For now, Knicks fans have to wait for the return of Towns. The team has another setback in the form of their star player, Jalen Brunson, who has also been out after Friday night’s game against the Clippers with a sprain. So far, his recovery timeline is also under wraps. Without Towns and Brunson, the Knicks facing the Clippers will certainly be tough, but the team has been one of the best in the league with 40 wins in their stats, and they are looking to grab the win against the Clippers.",New york knicks star karl-anthony towns is out for personal reasons.

NEW DELHI: India are set to face New Zealand in a bid to win the Champions Trophy after a 12-year hiatus, confronting their historical difficulty in overcoming the resilient Kiwis in ICC tournaments, where New Zealand leads with a 10-6 record and a 3-1 advantage in knockout matches.Despite criticisms regarding India's extended preparation time in Dubai, such arguments are diminished as New Zealand is also well-acquainted with the conditions. India's strategy likely involves leveraging their spin quartet, which has proven effective on the Dubai International Cricket Stadium pitch, against New Zealand's batting lineup.Spinners Varun Chakravarthy, Kuldeep Yadav, Ravindra Jadeja, and Axar Patel have been key in India's bowling success, potentially challenging New Zealand's top batters, including Kane Williamson and Rachin Ravindra.New Zealand's spinners, however, have previously succeeded against India and aim to replicate that performance. The match also carries emotional weight for India, with veterans Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma potentially playing in one of their final ICC tournaments.Kohli's recent form includes a century and two fifties, while Sharma aims to contribute more significantly. India hopes for impactful performances from the rest of the team, including vice-captain Shubman Gill, Shreyas Iyer, KL Rahul, and Hardik Pandya, to secure a collective victory.This final presents an opportunity for both teams to claim the ICC ODI title, with India looking to add to their trophy cabinet and New Zealand seeking their first since 2000.The match will be live-streamed on JioHotstar and broadcast on Star Sports Network.The match is scheduled to begin at 2:30 pm IST, while the toss will take place at 2 pm on March 9, Sunday.Rohit Sharma(c), Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer, Axar Patel, KL Rahul(w), Hardik Pandya, Ravindra Jadeja, Mohammed Shami, Kuldeep Yadav, Varun Chakaravarthy, Washington Sundar, Arshdeep Singh, Harshit Rana, Rishabh PantWill Young, Rachin Ravindra, Kane Williamson, Daryl Mitchell, Tom Latham(w), Glenn Phillips, Michael Bracewell, Mitchell Santner(c), Matt Henry, Kyle Jamieson, William ORourke, Nathan Smith, Mark Chapman, Devon Conway, Jacob Duffy","India set to face new zealand in a bid to win the champions trophy after a 12-year hiatus.

The Champions Trophy 2025 final will see India and New Zealand lock horns at the Dubai International Stadium on Sunday, March 9. Both teams have taken contrasting routes to the summit clash, but history suggests that this could be yet another classic Indo-Kiwi encounter.India, led by Rohit Sharma , have dominated throughout the tournament, relying on their balanced attack, which features a four-pronged spin force and a dependable top order. They breezed past Pakistan, Bangladesh and New Zealand in the group stage before overcoming Australia in the semi-finals.New Zealand, always punching above their weight in ICC tournaments, have had to fight through a more challenging road. They lost to India in their final group game, after victories against Pakistan and Bangladesh booked them a spot in the semis. They then defeated South Africa in the semi-finals. New Zealand will be confident in their ability to break India’s dream of reclaiming the Champions Trophy after 12 years.New Zealand have been a thorn in India’s side in ICC knockout matches. They lead the head-to-head record 3-1 in ICC knockouts, including wins in the 2019 ODI World Cup semi-final and the 2021 World Test Championship final. Despite India’s recent group-stage win over New Zealand by 44 runs, history suggests that the Kiwis thrive under high-pressure situations.For India, Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma remain key figures, but the team will also look towards Shubman Gill, Shreyas Iyer and KL Rahul to shoulder the batting responsibility. New Zealand, on the other hand, will bank on their all-round strength, with Rachin Ravindra and Kane Williamson pivotal in their semifinal triumph against South Africa.India's spin attack — featuring Kuldeep Yadav, Ravindra Jadeja, Axar Patel and Varun Chakravarthy — has been their trump card throughout the tournament. However, New Zealand boasts an equally potent spin quartet of Mitchell Santner, Michael Bracewell, Rachin Ravindra and Glenn Phillips, making the battle of spin the defining factor in this final.The Dubai International Stadium has provided low-scoring thrillers throughout the tournament, and the final will be played on the same surface that hosted India’s clash against Pakistan in the group stage. The Emirates Cricket Board (ECB) has ensured a two-week rest period for all wickets, but the pitch is expected to be slow and gripping, favouring spinners.India’s spin quartet could have the edge in these conditions, but New Zealand’s slower bowlers will also be a major threat. Expect a low-to-mid-scoring contest, with 270-280 being a competitive total.","Champions trophy 2025 final will see india and new zealand lock horns at the dubai international stadium on sunday, march 9.

The Los Angeles Lakers are making strategic moves as they gear up for the playoffs, with reports indicating that Jordan Goodwin ’s two-way contract will soon be converted into a standard NBA deal. This decision comes as the team continues its impressive run, winning seven straight games and 18 of their last 21. To make room for Goodwin, the Lakers are likely to waive either Cam Reddish or Alex Len, with Reddish being the more probable candidate.Jordan Goodwin, a 26-year-old guard, has quickly become a valuable asset for the Los Angeles Lakers since joining the team in early February. Over eight games, he has averaged 6.1 points, 3.8 rebounds, and 1.0 assist in 16.9 minutes per game. Goodwin's achievements have not gone unnoticed, even though a recent ailment to his right ankle has slowed his progress. He has received numerous compliments from head coach JJ Redick, who has referred to him as a vital rotation player.Jovan Buha of The Athletic reports that in order to optimize financial flexibility, the Los Angeles Lakers are anticipated to convert Goodwin's deal as late as feasible. ""I do expect him to be converted at the end of the season as late as possible, and then be on the playoff roster. ... He's kind of become the 9th man, and you could argue that depending on the night and depending on the matchup, he should be like the 8th man,"" Buha said on his podcast . He also hinted at a potential multi-year deal for Goodwin in the future, stating, ""I think he's going to get a multi-year contract, longer-term later in the season.""Jordan Goodwin’s journey to the Lakers began after they waived Armel Traore to open a roster spot. A four-year NBA veteran, he has previously played for Washington, Phoenix, and Memphis, holding career averages of 6.4 points, 3.8 rebounds, and 2.6 assists across 128 games.

LeBron James snubbed by Ric Bucher’s Los Angeles Lakers greatness criteria



'LeBron isn’t an all-time Lakers great!’: Ric Bucher sparks heated debate | SPEAK

Do Ric Bucher’s standards exclude Los Angeles Lakers icons like Jerry West, Elgin Baylor, and Wilt Chamberlain from all-time great status?

On Tuesday, Fox Sports analyst Ric Bucher sparked debate on the latest episode of SPEAK by claiming that LeBron James does not qualify as an all-time Lakers great. Bucher argued that to earn that distinction, a player must spend at least 10 years with the franchise and win a minimum of three championships. Bucher’s comments immediately sparked backlash, with O'Shea Jackson Jr. , son of rapper Ice Cube , leading the charge. Taking to X, he passionately challenged Bucher’s criteria, questioning its fairness and historical accuracy.O'Shea Jackson Jr. didn’t hold back in his criticism of Bucher’s criteria, taking to X on Thursday to highlight how many Lakers legends wouldn’t meet those same standards. ""Someone tell Jerry West’s family. Wilt Chamberlain ’s family. Gail Goodrich. Pau Gasol. Elgin Baylor’s family. Bob McAdoo and Jamaal Wilkes that Ric Bucher says they aren’t Laker greats,"" he wrote. His post struck a chord with fans who believe that greatness isn’t just about longevity and championships but about impact, legacy, and contributions to the franchise.Since joining the Lakers in 2018, LeBron James has been a game-changer for the franchise, guiding them to an NBA Championship in the 2019-20 season—their first in a decade. Year after year, he has put up stellar numbers, averaging 26.8 points, 8.1 assists, 8.0 rebounds, and 1.1 steals per game while shooting an impressive 51.4% from the field. Despite these accomplishments, Bucher insists that James doesn’t qualify as a true Lakers great due to his tenure and championship count.However, many fans and analysts strongly disagree, noting that some of the most legendary players in Lakers history also fail to meet Bucher’s strict criteria. This has led to widespread debate over what truly defines greatness within one of the NBA’s most storied franchises.If Bucher's definition of a Lakers great were applied across history, some of the most celebrated figures in the franchise’s past would not qualify. Jerry West , despite being the inspiration behind the NBA logo and spending 14 seasons with the Lakers, only won one championship—falling short of Bucher’s three-title benchmark. Similarly, Elgin Baylor , a 10-time All-NBA forward, was a dominant scorer but never secured a championship ring.Gail Goodrich, another Lakers Hall of Famer, played nine seasons in Los Angeles and contributed to the 1972 championship but also fails to meet Bucher’s 10-year standard. Even Wilt Chamberlain , a towering presence in Lakers history, played only five seasons with the team and won just one title, making him ineligible under Bucher’s rules.Also Read: LeBron James scales the historic peak of 50,000 points in NBA Ric Bucher’s criteria for defining a Lakers great has sparked heated debate, as it leaves out some of the biggest names in franchise history. While championships and longevity matter, many believe that impact, leadership, and overall contributions to the Lakers’ legacy are just as crucial. LeBron James has already proven himself as one of basketball’s greatest, and whether he fits Bucher’s definition or not, his mark on the Lakers is undeniable.This debate also underscores the changing expectations of modern athletes. With players like LeBron James, who consistently break records and adapt their game, the traditional criteria for greatness may no longer suffice. The new era of basketball emphasizes a player’s ability to impact the game across multiple dimensions, not just through championships and tenure. The debate over what defines greatness will always spark discussion.","Fox sports analyst ric bucher claimed that lebron james does not qualify as an all-time lakers great.

""His three-point shooting addresses a key need, and his ability to play multiple positions offers flexibility. If he improves defensively and becomes more consistent on offense, he could become a solid contributor for a championship contender.""

""With the Toronto Raptors envisioning a frontcourt of Scottie Barnes and newly extended Brandon Ingram along with former lottery pick Gradey Dick at shooting guard, where does that leave current leading scorer RJ Barrett’s future?""

""Based on conversations before the deadline, RJ Barrett could be a trade candidate to monitor this summer.""

The Los Angeles Lakers are reportedly considering a bold move this summer to bolster their roster, potentially trading rookie forward Dalton Knecht to acquire former New York Knicks star RJ Barrett from the Toronto Raptors . This comes as the Lakers continue to ride the wave of success following their acquisition of Luka Doncic , who has been instrumental in their recent seven-game winning streak, propelling them to a 39-21 record and the No. 2 seed in the Western Conference. Luka Doncic ’s partnership with LeBron James has been a game-changer for the Los Angeles Lakers , driving their offense to a No. 12 ranking with a 117.3 offensive rating over the last seven games. However, their defensive performance has been equally impressive, boasting a league-leading 106.2 defensive rating during the same stretch. This resurgence has sparked speculation that the Lakers might be willing to part ways with Knecht to secure a proven talent like RJ Barrett.Heavy Sports' David Grubb noted.The Los Angeles Lakers previously attempted to trade Knecht during the deadline in a deal for Charlotte Hornets center Mark Williams, which ultimately fell through. This time, they could package Knecht, along with Gabe Vincent and Jarred Vanderbilt’s salaries, and draft capital to pursue RJ Barrett. The Raptors, who are reportedly open to moving Barrett, might find this offer appealing as they look to reshape their roster around Scottie Barnes and Brandon Ingram.HoopsHype’s Michael Scotto questioned.Barrett, who was traded to Toronto from the Knicks during the 2023-24 season, has been a consistent performer, averaging 21.7 points, 6.4 rebounds, and 5.7 assists in 49 games this season. His versatility and scoring ability make him an attractive target for the Los Angeles Lakers, who could see him as a perfect fit alongside Luka Doncic and James.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Los Angele Lakers might reunite with $3 million shooting guard before playoffs to support LeBron James and Luka Doncic As the offseason approaches, the Lakers’ pursuit of RJ Barrett could signal their commitment to building a championship-caliber team for the 2025-26 season.

When and where to watch the Charlotte Hornets play tonight against the Brooklyn Nets (March 8, 2025)?

The Charlotte Hornets are set to host the Brooklyn Nets on Saturday, March 8, at the Spectrum Center, but all eyes are on the Hornets’ injury report, particularly the status of star guard LaMelo Ball. Ball, the team’s leading scorer averaging 25.8 points per game, has been a bright spot in an otherwise challenging season for the Hornets, who hold a 14-48 record. However, his recent performances have raised concerns about his health and availability moving forward. LaMelo Ball will be playing tonight against the Brooklyn Nets.

In the last 20 games, Ball’s numbers have been decent, with averages of just 22.3 points, 5.4 rebounds, and 6.8 assists.The Hornets are already dealing with a lengthy injury list. Grant Williams (ACL), Tre Mann (back), and Brandon Miller (wrist) are all out for the season, while Josh Okogie (hamstring) remains sidelined. Mark Williams (foot) is listed as day-to-day, leaving the team thin in key areas. Ball’s potential health concerns could further complicate matters for a team already battling to stay competitive.On the other side, the Nets come into the game with their own injury woes. De’Anthony Melton (ACL) and Cameron Johnson (knee) are out, while Noah Clowney (ankle) is day-to-day. Despite their 21-41 record, the Nets have shown flashes of resilience, led by Nic Claxton and Keon Johnson, who have been consistent contributors.The Hornets’ struggles extend beyond injuries. They rank 28th in the league in scoring (105.4 points per game) and 14th in points allowed (113.1 per game). Their -483 scoring differential highlights the uphill battle they face nightly. Miles Bridges has been a standout, averaging 23.8 points and 8.5 rebounds in the last 20 games, but the team’s success heavily relies on Ball’s ability to perform at his usual elite level.As the Hornets prepare to face the Nets, fans and analysts alike will be watching Ball closely.

How to watch the Boston Celtics play tonight against the Los angeles Lakers (March 8, 2025)

The Boston Celtics are gearing up for a high-stakes showdown against the Los Angeles Lakers on Saturday, March 8, at TD Garden, but all eyes are on Jayson Tatum’s injury status. The Celtics’ leading scorer, averaging 26.9 points per game, is a critical piece of Boston’s championship aspirations. However, his availability remains uncertain as the team navigates a challenging injury report. Jayson Tatum will be playing tonight against the Los Angeles Lakers. He is not listed on the team’s injury report and is in the projected starters. Tatum, who has been a consistent force for the Boston Celtics this season, is not listed on the injury report, which is a positive sign for Boston fans. His recent performances have been stellar, averaging 24.9 points, 8.0 rebounds, and 6.8 assists over the last 20 games. His ability to dominate on both ends of the floor has been instrumental in Boston’s success, as they currently rank fifth in the league in scoring (117.0 points per game) and third in defense (108.3 points allowed per game).While Jayson Tatum appears to be in good health, the Celtics are dealing with other key injuries. Jrue Holiday (hand), Sam Hauser (ankle), and Kristaps Porzingis (illness) are all listed as questionable for the marquee matchup. Their potential absences could put additional pressure on Tatum and Jaylen Brown to carry the offensive load against a Lakers team that boasts its own star power.On the Lakers’ side, LeBron James (foot) and Luka Doncic (knee) are both listed as probable, though Doncic’s status is particularly noteworthy. The Slovenian guard, now with the Lakers, has been a dynamic addition to the roster, averaging 11.9 points, 4.1 rebounds, and 4.1 assists in his last 20 games. His presence on the court could create a thrilling duel with Tatum, provided both stars are healthy.The Boston Celtics-Lakers rivalry is one of the most storied in NBA history, and this matchup promises to deliver another chapter of intensity. With Tatum’s status looking favorable, Boston will rely heavily on his scoring and leadership to secure a crucial win. However, the team’s depth will be tested if Holiday, Hauser, or Porzingis are unable to suit up.Also read: Los Angeles Lakers vs Boston Celtics game prediction, betting odds, best pick, spread, and more (March 8, 2025) Fans can catch the action live on ABC and ESPN+ or stream the game on Fubo.

Taylor Swift was reportedly ""gripped by fear"" over Travis Kelce's decision of returning for the 2025 NFL season

Following the loss of the Kansas City Chiefs during Super Bowl 59 to the Eagles, there was uncertainty around Travis Kelce 's future in the NFL. He confessed during the New Heights podcast that he took time considering whether to continue playing or hang up his boots. He, however, finally decided to remain in the league.

Fans and pundits alike wondered if the superstar tight end would come back for another year or retire after the crushing loss.Kelce himself cleared the air about the uncertainty on the New Heights podcast, saying that he himself did not know what he would do next in the moments after the game. He revealed that he had taken time to consider his options before making a conclusive decision regarding his football future.Finally, Kelce decided to keep playing, deciding to play on rather than retire from the sport. His long-time girlfriend, global singing sensation Taylor Swift, though, was highly invested in the consequences of his choice, and by a Radar Online report, worried about the heaviness of it all.

With too much hanging in the balance—both professionally and personally—Kelce's next step is one that would change not only his life but that of his romance with Swift as well.Swift is uncertain about two potential outcomes in the near future: more time together with Kelce, which they both desire, or too much togetherness, which can potentially unravel even the strongest relationships, according to insiders. “If Travis does retire, it could drastically change his and Taylor’s lives together. He would be around far more – and who knows, she may start to get sick of him!” an insider warned.“Taylor is really gripped by fear over which way he’s going to jump because it has big ramifications for their relationship, but also, it is totally his call. Travis is totally adamant that Taylor would never pressure him into anything, insisting she’ll support whatever he decides – but let’s be real, it’s no secret she’s itching to settle down.”They added, “Imagine if he retires; they could finally have more time together! They both really miss each other when he’s off training or jet-setting around the country for games. But on the flip-side there is the danger they would then be spending too much time together and they both know this can spell the death of a relationship.”Also Read: “Their fantasy bubble has been popped”: Taylor Swift is clearly happy for her beau Travis Kelce's retirement decision, but she had some reservations","Travis kelce stands at a career fork in the road, caught between remaining in the nfl or transitioning into entertainment.

Bill Simmons Opens Up on Why Tom Brady’s Raiders Ownership Could Spell Trouble



Bleakest NFL Teams, QB Draft Drama, and Sunny Washington Times | The Bill Simmons Podcast

Amid the process of NFL picking, the Los Angeles Raiders are making preparations to be in an important place: Green Bay and steer the ship by none other than Tom Brady. This ""seven-time"" world-beater will be the major factor in securing a good franchise quarterback to the club. An enthusiast for Brady like Bill Simmons gets excited by all this, but even he is concerned about Brady's role in the franchise.The Las Vegas Raiders' decision to bring Tom Brady on board as a minority owner has sparked immense excitement among fans. The move, approved by the league in October 2024, not only connects the franchise to a seven-time Super Bowl champion but also fuels speculation about Brady’s potential influence in shaping the team’s future—especially when it comes to finding their next franchise quarterback. However, while many are thrilled about his involvement, not everyone is convinced that Brady’s greatness on the field will translate to success in the front office.Media personality and longtime New England Patriots fan Bill Simmons has raised concerns about Brady’s ability to evaluate quarterbacks. As reported by Awful Announcing, Simmons addressed the topic on The Bill Simmons Podcast, pointing out that legendary players don’t always make great decision-makers.“This is a dangerous thing where you have him running a football team thinking he knows what’s best with quarterbacks because he was a great quarterback,” Simmons remarked. He further emphasized that history has shown how former elite players often struggle in management roles. “Because all of the evidence with the great players we’ve had, name the sport, mostly they’re not good at this. They think they’re seeing things that other people don’t see, and it’s not actually rational.”Simmons’ concerns stem from a common issue in professional sports: the assumption that elite players naturally excel at talent evaluation. Many former greats have struggled when transitioning to front-office roles, with John Elway’s tenure as the Denver Broncos’ general manager serving as a prime example.One of the biggest questions surrounding Brady’s involvement with the Raiders is how much influence he will have on their quarterback selection in the 2025 NFL Draft. With Las Vegas potentially looking for a long-term solution at the position, having Brady’s input might seem like a huge advantage. However, Simmons argues that his presence in the decision-making room could create complications.“I’m just saying it’s not a slam dunk. Part of the problem is if you and I are in that room with Tom Brady and we were like, ‘yo man, we think Darnold, look…’ and he’s like, ‘I’m out. I watched that game and he doesn’t have it, I’m out,’” Simmons said. “Are we gonna argue with Tom Brady? It’s just now — it’s this one voice that sees what he wants to see.”This raises a critical point: Will Brady’s opinions be too influential, even if they aren’t always correct? His unmatched playing experience could give him valuable insight, but it also comes with the risk of bias—seeing the game through the lens of his own greatness rather than an objective evaluator.Brady’s presence in the Raiders’ ownership group guarantees that all eyes will be on the team’s quarterback decisions moving forward. His involvement could be a game-changer if he successfully helps the franchise land its next star signal-caller. But as Simmons pointed out, history suggests that not all legendary players thrive in this kind of role.Also Read: Kelly Stafford might have accidentally revealed Matthew Stafford’s remaining years in the NFL While some may take pleasure in seeing if Brady struggles in his new position, the NFL will ultimately determine whether his transition from the field to the front office is a success. Whether his impact leads to triumph or proves to be a cautionary tale remains to be seen, but one thing is certain—his influence on the Raiders is just beginning.",The las vegas raiders' decision to bring tom brady on board as a minority owner has sparked immense excitement among fans.
