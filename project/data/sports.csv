The Miami Dolphins might be releasing Tyreek Hill before he can come back in the next season



Were the Pittsburgh Steelers interested in Tyreek Hill?



Tyreek Hill, the Miami Dolphins’ star player, has had a tough time in this season after he found himself involved in a messy legal scandal with his estranged wife and sustained a brutal knee injury at the match against the New York Jets. But now, it seems Tyreek Hill might just be released by the team before he can return in the next season.A few hours ago, CBS Sports reported that multiple sources have revealed that the Miami Dolphins are gearing up to release Tyreek Hill before the start of the next season.But that’s not all; the Miami Dolphins are planning to release Tyreek Hill before any of his 2026 salary becomes guaranteed.At this point in time, the NFL star player Tyreek Hill’s deal with the Miami Dolphins has an $11 million injury guarantee, which is on top of a $5 million roster bonus but this deal will vest if he is with the team in March.This has sparked chaos among fans, but neither the Miami Dolphins nor Tyreek Hill has commented on the speculations and continues to remain silent about it.While there have been rumors about Tyreek Hill being traded, his brutal injury at the match against the New York Jets was shocking.The star player ended up tearing several ligaments in his dislocated left knee, including his ACL, and had to undergo surgery on Tuesday.His manager has announced that Tyreek Hill will be available to play in Week 1 of the next season.Amid all the mess, a few weeks ago, there were speculations about the Pittsburgh Steelers being interested in Tyreek Hill, before he sustained the crushing injury.However, it seems Tyreek Hill’s legal mess with his estranged wife, Keeta Vaccaro, and charges of domestic violence had the Pittsburgh Steelers backing off.According to Pro Football Talk, “The Steelers are concerned that the new Personal Conduct Policy investigation, sparked by eight allegations of domestic violence in court filings made by his estranged wife, could result in a suspension.”However, the Pittsburgh Steelers have not confirmed this speculation as they continue to maintain silence.Also Read: NFL trade rumors: Insider hints Russell Wilson could be on the move again as trade rumors heat up",The miami dolphins might be releasing tyreek hill before he can come back in the next season.

The efforts to keep the game going

The autumn storms putting the game at a standstill

The Alfred Dunhill Links Championship took a stall on Saturday when the third round of the $5 million event in Scotland was halted after just one hole. The tournament faced multiple changes in schedule because of bad weather. On Friday, heavy rain and strong winds became so severe that officials had no choice but to stop around 5 p.m. Things finally cleared up the next morning. The players were able to get back on the course. By late Saturday morning, the second round was finished.To keep things moving, organisers decided to start the third round at 12:30 p.m. the same day. Matches were spread out across the three famous courses hosting the event. The Old Course at St. Andrews, Carnoustie, and Kingsbarns were the venues. This adjustment gave players and fans a chance to enjoy the competition again after a frustrating delay.On paper, everything looked back on track. Players and their celebrity partners made their way to their starting holes. But within minutes of teeing off, it was obvious the elements were not going to cooperate. Winds across the famous links started with such force that continuing was impossible.At precisely 12:47 p.m., sirens sounded to suspend play.Also Read: Storm Amy forces cancellation of day 3 at Alfred Dunhill Links Championship amid 60mph winds Incredibly, only one player, France’s Tom Vaillant, managed to complete two holes. He recorded back-to-back pars at the 7th and 8th holes at Carnoustie to remain tied for fourth at 10-under. For everyone else, the round was effectively a false start.The wind was so strong that it even caused some unintentional comedy. Amateur Hicky Bacon’s caddie was spotted sprinting across the 18th tee chasing banknotes that had blown out of his wallet. In the chaos, at least one of the notes ended up floating in the Swilcan Burn.This year marks the 40th anniversary of the Dunhill Links, an event that blends top professionals with celebrity amateurs across Scotland’s most iconic courses. What began as a hopeful restart quickly turned into a weather-hit spectacle, raising fresh questions about staging one of golf’s most glamorous events in the teeth of Scotland’s unpredictable autumn storms.","The alfred dunhill links championship took a stall on saturday.

The Man Behind the Controversy



The Personal Toll



LIV Golf: Achievements Amid Criticism



Greg Norman, once regarded as golf's golden boy, had been abroad for a full quarter of a century. That was when he decided to speak up about the agonizingly turbulent period at the head of the Saudi-backed LIV Golf league. In an interview with sharp candor, in that same very Florida office surrounded by his empire, known by his name, the two-time Major champion reflected on his controversial tenure and the backlash it engendered.Norman, who headed LIV Golf ever since it came into existence in 2021 until just before the 2025 season when he was replaced by Scott O’Neil, insisted that his decisions never had a political view behind them.“I enjoyed my time at LIV. But I’ll be honest with you, it was hard,” Norman said. “It was very draining on me. I was working 100-hour weeks. I’m not going to say all the abuse was anything [of consequence], but what hurt me the most was the lack of understanding of why people would judge me and give the abuse they did”, said Norman, advocating the disruptive force of the league that, in his view, has gone on to positively refashion the whole of professional golf.In truth, Norman has been trying to put forth an unmoved front by pronouncing the pride he felt for what he had done despite the tempest stirred by his leadership: ""That was the thing that bothered me the most, because I’m the type of guy who will happily sit down and talk about things. And if I’m wrong, I’ll admit I’m wrong. But don’t judge me. Don’t judge what LIV was truly all about,"" A social media sign-off in September raised more questions, but Norman said otherwise, insisting it was completely his decision, with nothing but gratitude, pride, and achievement.While Norman was celebrating the achievements of LIV, he candidly discussed the personal challenges he faced. ""It was very draining on me. I was working 100-hour weeks. I’m not going to say all the abuse was of consequence, but what hurt me the most was the lack of understanding of why people would judge me.""While under Norman’s leadership, LIV Golf increased its calendar of events and attracted international attention, it could not gain points in the Official World Golf Ranking. Whatever the controversial issues against it and whatever the debates on the Saudi money funding it, Norman sees the bigger picture, a sport evolving to challenge its own traditions.Now looking back, Norman’s reflections give us an insight into a man who took risks, endured criticism, and altered the landscape of golf and basically begged the world to understand.",Greg norman has spoken out about his time at the head of the saudi-backed liv golf league.

Stephen A. Smith defends Shedeur Sanders after silent press meet

“I’m not gonna overreact to it. I’m just gonna say that he has to know that other people are going to look at him and consider that immature,”

“I don’t consider him immature. I think that he can play, I think that he’s a leader. I think that a lot is prejudged when it comes to him. I think it’s unfair.”

“Every word he says, we micromanage, we dissect, and folks judge him accordingly.

I think that was his way of saying, ‘You know what? If you don’t hear anything that I have to say, O.K., that’s cool.’”

Cam Newton on Shedeur Sanders’ role with Browns and business value

“circus-like attention.”

“If we cut Shedeur, that would be bad for business. He moves the needle for Cleveland in a way no one else has,”

Shedeur Sanders made headlines in Cleveland, Ohio, on October 1, 2025, after a strange post-practice media session. Reporters asked about the Cleveland Browns’ quarterback decision, but Sanders did not speak a single word. Instead, he mimed his answers and smiled, leaving many confused. The team had just named Dillon Gabriel as starter and Joe Flacco as backup, putting Sanders as the third quarterback. On October 2, 2025, ESPN’s First Take host Stephen A. Smith gave his reaction. He said people may judge Sanders as immature, but he thinks that view is unfair.Speaking on First Take on Thursday, Stephen A. Smith said he was not shocked by Sanders’ behavior but warned that the public may take it the wrong way.Smith said.Stephen A. Smith also pointed out that in today’s media world, every single word from Sanders is picked apart. He added:For Stephen A. Smith, the key point is that Shedeur Sanders will only be judged fairly once he actually plays snaps for the Browns. Until then, interviews, silent or not, will continue to spark outside criticism.Former NFL quarterback Cam Newton also shared his view on Shedeur Sanders in the latest episode of his 4th & 1 podcast. Newton said Sanders is a talented quarterback, but his presence brings what he calledHe explained that the Browns may keep Sanders not only for his football potential but also because of his value to the team’s brand.Newton said.Also Read: Patrick Mahomes Quiet After Charlie Kirk Shooting At Utah As Randi Mahomes And Tavia Hunt Speaks Out Newton also warned Sanders to prove himself through play, not off-field stories. He criticized Sanders’ body language and pocket presence, saying these are habits that must improve.

Both Smith and Newton agree: his real judgment will come only when he steps onto the field and plays in a competitive NFL game.","Shedeur sanders made headlines in cleveland, ohio, on october 1, 2025, after a strange post-practice media session.

Baltimore Ravens’ Lamar Jackson ruled out and Houston Texans has the opportunity to exploit their weakness,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/baltimore-ravens-lamar-jackson-ruled-out-and-houston-texans-has-the-opportunity-to-exploit-their-weakness/articleshow/124311150.cms,"Lamar Jackson of the Baltimore Ravens looks to pass prior to an NFL football game against the Kansas City Chiefs (Image Source - Getty Images)

How the Houston Texans can exploit Baltimore Ravens' weakness

Houston Texans remain relatively healthy despite Jaylen Reed Folorunso Fatukasi missing Week 5

The Baltimore Ravens are all set to clash with the Houston Texans in a key Week 5 showdown on October 5, 2025, at M&T Bank Stadium, with the game starting at 1 p.m. ET. Both teams head into this contest with the same 1-3 records, which is disappointing considering they both topped their divisions in 2024.The Ravens have had a tough start, worsened by a series of injuries, particularly the loss of their star quarterback Lamar Jackson , who is sidelined with a hamstring injury from their Week 4 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs.Without Lamar Jackson , the Baltimore Ravens are missing their dynamic dual-threat quarterback, which forces them to adopt a more traditional pocket-passing strategy with Cooper Rush. Analysts indicate that this could allow the Houston Texans' defense to exert effective pressure.Houston's pass rush, led by players like Will Anderson Jr., might capitalize on Baltimore's possibly weakened offensive line if tackle Ronnie Stanley (who is questionable due to an ankle injury) is not fully available.The Baltimore defense is feeling the impact of linebacker Roquan Smith and cornerbacks Marlon Humphrey and Chidobe Awuzie being out, which opens up weaknesses in the secondary and run defense that Texans quarterback C.J.Stroud and his receivers can take advantage of.Analysts from Locked On Texans and other sources are pointing out that the Ravens' rush defense has been shaky this season, giving Houston's running game a ""golden ticket"" to keep up and control the game clock.Moreover, with a number of Pro Bowlers missing, including Smith and Humphrey, Houston's up-and-coming players like Stroud could take advantage of mismatches in coverage.The Ravens hold a 5-0 record against the Texans when Jackson plays, but his absence, coupled with defensive injuries, changes the odds, with most experts leaning towards Houston for a road win.The Texans' offensive coordinator has shown a need to exploit Baltimore's injury-stricken unit, as mentioned in Acast podcast discussions, by focusing on quick passes and getting the run game going early.The Houston Texans are managing some injuries, yet they look healthier overall, based on their Week 5 injury report from the team's site and USA Today. Missing the game are safety Jaylen Reed (knee), defensive tackle Folorunso Fatukasi (shoulder), and defensive end Denico Autry (knee).Other players such as running back Joe Mixon and safety Jimmie Ward have been mentioned in recent reports but are not marked as out for this game. Texans head coach DeMeco Ryans pointed out Jackson's role in a pre-game press conference, stressing how vital a player like Jackson is to any team, emphasizing the strategic adjustments without him. Ryans' statements were made to reporters during talks about the Texans' game strategy against Baltimore.If Lamar Jackson isn't playing, the Houston Texans gain a noticeable advantage. Baltimore's ability to adjust will be put to the test, and Houston has a solid opportunity to take control early on if they make the right moves.Also Read: Bad Bunny’s Super Bowl halftime show sends MAGA into meltdown as NFL refuses to bow to conservative rage","The baltimore ravens and houston texans meet in a key week 5 showdown on october 5, 2025, at m&t bank stadium, with the game starting at 1 p.m. Et.

Super Bowl Showdown? Trump Adviser Targets Bad Bunny as ICE Presence Sparks Halftime Uproar

“Who is Bad Bunny?”

Danica Patrick and Bad Bunny share their views

“What I care about is that I can sing along to the music,” Patrick said.

“His music is almost nothing in English. I don’t think it will be as uniting.”

Casey DeSantis, the wife of Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, surprised many people on October 2, 2025, when she asked on X, “Not trying to start anything here, but honestly… who exactly is Bad Bunny ?” The question came just hours after the NFL confirmed that Puerto Rican music star Bad Bunny, whose real name is Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio, will headline the Super Bowl LX halftime show in Las Vegas in February 2026. Her post quickly added to the growing debate among conservatives who were already upset about the choice.Ron DeSantis, who has more than 4.3 million Spanish-speaking voters in Florida, did not directly attack Bad Bunny. Instead, on the same day, October 2, he wrote on X that he still hopes one day Metallica will get the chance to perform during the Super Bowl halftime. “I’m still hoping that, someday, the NFL will have Metallica headline the halftime show,” he posted.Casey DeSantis, however, kept her comment simple. She did not suggest another band. Instead, her short question——quickly spread online and drew thousands of replies. Many people joked about her not knowing the world-famous star, while others supported her for speaking out.This came after many conservatives complained about Bad Bunny’s music being mostly in Spanish and about his past criticism of President Donald Trump.The pushback began right after Jay-Z’s Roc Nation, which partners with the NFL on halftime shows, selected Bad Bunny for the 2026 performance.Former NASCAR driver Danica Patrick also weighed in during an interview on Steve Bannon’s “War Room” podcast. She explained that the Super Bowl, watched by more than 127 million people across the U.S. every year, is supposed to unite viewers of all ages.She added that people who dislike the choice may even watch counter-shows during halftime.Also Read: Arthur Jones Cause Of Death: How Did The Ravens’ Super Bowl Champion Die At 39 Bad Bunny responded to the NFL’s announcement by calling the moment a victory for his community. “What I’m feeling goes beyond myself.This is for my people, my culture, and our history,” he said after the news was made official.

Philadelphia 76ers are being cautious with Joel Embiid's health

Joel Embiid is major instrument in Philadelphia 76ers success during upcoming season

Joel Embiid of the Philadelphia 76ers, has been sidelined due to a left knee injury since March of 2025. Right before the regular season was to end for the 2024-25 season, the injury changed the course of the game for Embiid as well as the Sixers. While the player did give a positive update during his NBA Media Day appearance, and has also traveled to Abu Dhabi with the team for their preseason game against the New York Knicks, the team is taking a cautious approach with their star center.The Philadelphia 76ers are prioritizing Joel Embiid's long-term health, making sure that he's fully recovered from the arthroscopic surgery performed in April, before he comes back to play for the team full on. Embiid's injury history has led the team to adopt a very meticulous recovery strategy, focusing more on his rehabilitation rather than forcing him to participate in the preseason games against the New York Knicks.Embiid did travel to Abu Dhabi for the NBA Abu Dhabi Games 2025, one of the seven overseas showcases by the league this season, but he did not play the first game, and is not likely to make an appearance in the second one either.Although he did appear healthy during the NBA Media Day, and looked to be in good spirits, the Sixers are not rushing to get him playing just yet.The upcoming season for the Philadelphia 76ers is very important. Their last season ended without the team qualifying for the Playoffs, so it will be important for the Sixers to try and make better play in the upcoming season. And for that, they will need their star players in perfect form, without an injury threatening their playtime.Joel Embiid will be at the centre of their strategy to get to the top. So even if he does not play during the preseason, the Sixers main aim would be to have him perfectly healthy before regular season begins later this month. The Sixers unfortunately lost their first game in Abu Dhabi against the New York Knicks, and will be facing them again tomorrow, on October 4.

The wedding was a vibrant affair, featuring traditional attire, lively rituals, and a warm gathering of family and friends, marking the start of Komal’s new chapter.Speaking to the media, Komal expressed her happiness but also a tinge of longing. “It feels amazing. This is such a great day for me, I am tying the knot today. I am very happy and excited. I am missing my brother,” she said, visibly emotional about Abhishek’s absence.The young Indian all-rounder, however, was unable to attend due to national duty.

India opted to bat first.Despite missing this special day, Abhishek’s dedication to the game underscores the sacrifices young cricketers make in balancing family and professional commitments. Meanwhile, Komal and Lovish began their married life surrounded by the warmth and love of family and friends.While Abhishek could not be physically present, the bond between siblings remains strong, with mutual support guiding both of them in their respective journeys.","Komal sharma, sister of indian cricketer abhishek sharma, marries businessman lovish oberoi in amritsar.

The French full-back has scored twice already and continues to create attacking overlaps, giving the champions another weapon on the flanks. His arrival from AC Milan looks like a perfect fit.At Al Nassr, Joao Felix has quickly developed a strong connection with Cristiano Ronaldo . The Portuguese forward has scored five goals in four matches, placing him among the league’s leading scorers. His quick adjustment has added another threat to the Al Nassr attack. This already had plenty of firepower.Meanwhile, Mateo Retegui has offered Al Qadsiah the scoring edge they needed.Along with three goals, including a debut brace, and the Italian striker has been among the most effective forwards. And his high shot count reflects a player keen to test defenses and make his presence felt.Joshua King has been another pleasant surprise, and joining Al Khaleej with little fanfare, the Norwegian international has four goals already. His sharp finishing has been vital in giving the team a strong start to the season.Enzo Millot has strengthened Al Ahli’s midfield. The French playmaker made an instant impression by assisting Ivan Toney on his debut. His ability to control the tempo has been praised by fans and could be important in Al Ahli’s push for more silverware.NEOM SC has relied on Alexandre Lacazette to guide them in their first Saudi Pro League campaign. The former Arsenal striker has three goals and an assist. This shows his experience and leadership. His presence has helped the new club settle quickly, securing three straight wins before the break.Late arrivals have also played their part.

Jon Jones once believed Arthur Jones could succeed in the UFC

Remembering a champion and mentor beyond football

The Baltimore Ravens community and NFL fans are mourning the loss of former defensive lineman Arthur Jones , a Super Bowl champion and beloved teammate, who died at the age of 39. The Ravens announced his passing on Friday, while his alma mater Syracuse University also confirmed the news. Neither organization provided details on the cause of death.Arthur Jones was not only remembered for his powerful presence on the field but also for the bond he shared with his brothers—former UFC heavyweight champion Jon Jones and four-time Pro Bowl defensive end Chandler Jones. In the wake of his death, an old interview featuring Jon Jones resurfaced, shedding light on the deep respect and admiration he carried for Arthur.Back in 2012, Jon Jones reflected on Arthur’s mindset and dedication, suggesting his brother had the potential to transition from the NFL to mixed martial arts. Speaking to Sports Illustrated’s Jeff Wagenheim, Jon said: “Arthur wouldn’t hesitate to pursue mixed martial arts. The dedication that it would take for him to get down to the 265 heavyweight limit. I think it would transform him mentally into the warrior he needs to be to compete at a high level.And he would be faster than ever and mentally a stronger person. I think he would make a great contender, if not champion, in the UFC.”The heartfelt remarks now resurface as a poignant reminder of the strength, discipline, and larger-than-life personality that defined Arthur.Arthur Jones carved out a memorable career in the NFL, highlighted by his performance in Super Bowl XLVII when the Ravens defeated the San Francisco 49ers. He recorded a sack on Colin Kaepernick and recovered a fumble in that game, helping Baltimore secure its second Lombardi Trophy. Drafted in the fifth round in 2010, Jones went on to play for the Indianapolis Colts and Washington before retiring in 2017.Off the field, Arthur remained a mentor and supporter of Syracuse’s football program, leaving a lasting impact on student-athletes. Syracuse athletic director John Wildhack said, “Arthur Jones was a tremendous player and even better person. We were fortunate that Arthur continued to support our football program after his playing career. He impacted many of our student-athletes, always with a smile and uplifting message. ”Ravens general manager Eric DeCosta echoed similar sentiments, calling Arthur’s positivity “a gift to everyone he encountered.” His infectious energy and big smile, DeCosta added, uplifted all those around him.Also Read: Controversy deepens: Police under fire as attorney claims former LSU wide receiver Kyren Lacy wrongly blamed in deadly accident Arthur Jones’ legacy now lives on not only in highlight reels and Super Bowl memories but also in the love and respect he inspired from his family, teammates, and fans.","Former baltimore ravens defensive lineman arthur jones has died at the age of 39.
