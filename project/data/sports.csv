India vs Pakistan in the Asia Cup Super 4s on Sunday had not just cricket on the field but gestures that drew criticism for bringing off-field aspects into it. Both the controversial and politically-motivated gestures were made by Pakistani players on a night they suffered a 6-wicket loss at the Dubai International Stadium.The first gesture involved Sahibzada Farhan who celebrated his half-century by pointing his bat like a gun , drawing further criticism from Indian fans who accused the Pakistani team of unsportsmanlike behaviour.In the second, Pakistan fast bowler Haris Rauf made a provocative gesture towards Indian fans . While stationed near the boundary, Rauf responded to spectators' jeers by signalling ""0-6"" with his fingers, referencing to Pakistan's unverified claims of downing six Indian fighter jets during the Operation Sindoor border clash in May.The incident occurred in the second innings when Indian fans were chanting ""Virat Kohli"" to tease Rauf , despite Kohli's absence from the match following his retirement from the format last year. The chants were meant to remind Rauf of the 2022 T20 World Cup match at Melbourne Cricket Ground, where Kohli had hit memorable shots against him.Videos of Rauf's gesture quickly spread across social media platforms, drawing criticism from Indian supporters.The match also saw Rauf involved in a heated exchange with Indian opener Abhishek Sharma . The confrontation took place after the final ball of the fifth over when Gill hit a four through a short-arm jab.The situation required umpire Gazi Sohel's intervention to separate the players.Despite the controversies, the match saw Pakistan posting their highest T20I total against India while batting first, reaching 171/5.India successfully chased down the target, with Abhishek scoring 74 runs and Shubman Gill contributing 47 runs.

'My job is to play': Haris Rauf stays calm as Pakistan ride out Asia Cup drama

WACTH:

NEW DELHI: The high-octane India vs Pakistan clash in the Asia Cup 2025 Super Four at Dubai International Cricket Stadium on Sunday, did not just serve up a six-wicket win for the defending champions India — it also delivered fresh controversy.Pakistan pacer Haris Rauf found himself in the middle of a storm after he taunted Indian fans with a provocative “6-0” gesture near the boundary ropes, a moment that has since gone viral on social media.The gesture, captured in multiple videos and photos, showed Rauf raising his hand to signal “6-0,” a reference to Pakistan’s unverified and politically charged claims of downing six Indian fighter jets during a four-day military scuffle following Operation Sindoor. During the match in Dubai, the pacer even acted out the motion of a crashing plane in front of the fans, further fuelling tensions.The incident unfolded while Rauf was fielding close to a packed Indian section of the crowd near the boundary rope. Fans had been chanting “Kohli, Kohli” to rile him up, a reminder of Virat Kohli’s iconic straight six off his bowling in the T20 World Cup 2022. In response, the 31-year-old pacer gestured towards them with the controversial signal, triggering loud boos from Indian supporters and sparking outrage online.The cricket, however, was dominated by India. Chasing 172, Abhishek Sharma hammered a blistering 74 off just 39 balls, including six fours and five towering sixes. His 105-run opening stand with Shubman Gill (47) laid the perfect platform, as Tilak Varma (30*) and Hardik Pandya (7*) sealed the win in 18.5 overs.While Rauf opted to gesture in a provocative manner, India's Abhishek Sharma took the other route, as he held up his hand to gesture the letter 'L'. He later explained that the 'L' stood for 'love' and that it was aimed at the Indian supporters.On-field tensions between Rauf and Indian players also flared. In the fifth over, after Gill cracked a crisp boundary, Rauf exchanged heated words with Abhishek Sharma, forcing umpire Gazi Sohel to step in. Though tempers cooled quickly, the episode added to the charged atmosphere.",Pakistan pacer haris rauf taunts indian fans with provocative '6-0' gesture.

Derrick Henry dominates early to lift Ravens



Derrick Henry’s pivotal role in Ravens’ offense



Baltimore Ravens running back Derrick Henry wasted no time erasing the disappointment of last week’s game. After a subdued performance against the Browns, where he was held to just 23 yards on 11 carries, Henry made it clear he was ready to bounce back. From the very first drive against the Detroit Lions, he showcased why he remains one of the most feared backs in football, turning opportunity into dominance.The game opened with the Lions marching down the field for a touchdown, but the Ravens’ response was swift and decisive. Quarterback Lamar Jackson orchestrated a nine-play, 75-yard drive that set the tone for the night. Derrick Henry was central to the drive, rushing three times for 36 yards, including a stunning 28-yard touchdown run where he remained untouched. Henry’s explosive performance was more than redemption—it was a reminder of his unmatched power and skill.Henry himself had acknowledged all week, “I have to do better,” and he delivered on that promise. His touchdown run against Detroit alone exceeded the total yardage he gained in his 11 carries against the Browns. With the offensive line creating wide lanes, Henry’s combination of speed and strength made scoring look effortless.Derrick Henry is more than just a running back—he is the engine of Baltimore’s offense. Ravens offensive coordinator Todd Monken’s strategy to get Henry rolling early proved effective, as the Lions’ defense struggled to contain him. One week can hold a player back, but two is nearly impossible, and Henry’s performance made that evident. His dominance on the field is a message to opponents: underestimating King Henry comes at a cost.With every carry, Derrick Henry reminds fans and rivals alike why he is considered one of the premier backs in the NFL. Against the Lions, he not only bounced back but also set the stage for a Ravens offense that looks stronger and more determined than ever.Also Read: Lions’ Aidan Hutchinson’s mom becomes unlikely internet sensation during during Lions vs Ravens game","Baltimore ravens running back derrick henry wasted no time erasing the disappointment of last week’s game.

Aidan Hutchinson’s mom Melissa Hutchinson ’s NFL spotlight journey



Beyond football: Melissa Hutchinson’s passions



Before the Detroit Lions and Baltimore Ravens squared off on Monday night, it wasn’t just the players drawing attention. Aidan Hutchinson’s mom, Melissa, became the unexpected star of the evening as social media lit up with her presence. For many fans, this moment wasn’t surprising—she has been a familiar face since her son’s draft journey in 2022.Melissa first captured the hearts of fans during the 2022 NFL Draft, documenting Aidan’s leap from Michigan to the professional stage. As a professional photographer, she chronicled every milestone with artistry and emotion. In one heartfelt Instagram post leading up to draft week, she wrote, “One week until we board that plane to Vegas… all I can say is meeting and working with some of the most incredibly kind, hard-working, beautifully-spirited people has by far been some of the greatest experiences of my own life. ”Her words reflected not only pride in her son but also the gratitude she felt for the entire journey. Since then, Melissa has rarely missed a chance to stand by Aidan’s side, whether at games or key career moments. On Monday, her presence at Baltimore’s stadium sparked comments like, “Hot Mom alert–Aidan Hutchinson,” proving once again that she commands attention in her own right.While football fans often spot her cheering in stadiums, Melissa Hutchinson’s life extends far beyond the sidelines.She continues to pursue her love for photography, sharing striking images from across the globe. Her work carries the same authenticity that defined her draft posts, blending personal storytelling with creative flair.Fashion is another arena where Melissa shines. In 2020, she became an ambassador for Savvi, an athleisure brand that reflects her style-forward yet approachable personality. Between her photography projects, fashion ventures, and raising three children, she manages to balance artistry with motherhood in a way that resonates with fans.For Aidan, who recently returned to the field after a season-ending injury in 2024, having his mother’s unwavering support is invaluable. And for fans, Melissa Hutchinson has become more than just an NFL mom—she’s a personality who continues to captivate audiences every time she appears.Also Read: Tom Brady accused of normalizing animal cruelty after controversial ‘kick the dog’ comment, faces PETA criticism","Aidan hutchinson’s mom, melissa, became the unexpected star of the evening.

Tom Brady’s unexpected ‘kick the dog’ remark on live TV sparks backlash



PETA responds while Brady’s past with pets resurfaces



Tom Brady is once again at the center of attention, but this time it has nothing to do with his performance on the football field. During Fox Sports’ broadcast of the Dallas Cowboys and Chicago Bears game on September 21, the seven-time Super Bowl champion drew heavy criticism for a remark that many fans and animal rights advocates found troubling.As Cowboys receiver George Pickens slammed his helmet on the sideline, Brady tried to explain the frustration he saw on screen. “Those helmets can be … it’s like the dog at home. Kick the dog, throw the helmet, whatever it takes,” he said.The comment landed awkwardly. Broadcast partner Kevin Burkhardt did not respond, but viewers quickly did. Social media lit up with reactions ranging from disbelief to anger. One critic posted, “Tom Brady just promoted animal abuse on national television,” while another asked, “Did Tom Brady just casually admit to animal abuse?”The backlash grew strong enough to attract a response from People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA). While the organization stopped short of accusing Brady of endorsing cruelty, it made its stance clear. “PETA encourages Brady to remember that millions of people listen to him, that the language we use can encourage kindness or violence towards animals, and that we should never normalize taking our frustration out on a beloved companion,” the group said in a statement.Adding to the storm, sports commentator Skip Bayless joined the debate, writing, “I hope Brady didn’t go home after bad losses and angrily throw the dog.”The remark drew attention to Brady’s well-documented affection for his own pets.In 2016, Brady and then-wife Gisele Bündchen adopted a rescue dog named Fluffy. They also had a pit bull mix named Lua, who passed away in 2023. At the time, Brady posted a heartfelt tribute on Instagram, writing, “We love you Lua. Forever in our hearts,” alongside photos of his children hugging their beloved pet.That history has made the comment even more confusing to fans who know Brady as an animal lover. Still, the criticism underscores how closely the public watches every word from high-profile figures.For Brady, now in his second season as Fox Sports’ lead analyst, this episode adds to what has already been a rocky run in the booth. Between scrutiny over his minority ownership stake in the Las Vegas Raiders and the pressure of his $375 million broadcasting contract, the future Hall of Famer has found that life behind the microphone can be just as intense as it was under center.Also Read: Nick Foles explains two powerful reasons why the NFL must not ban Eagles’ controversial tush push play","Tom brady sparks backlash with controversial ‘kick the dog’ comment during nfl broadcast.

Jalen Hurts and the offensive line at the heart of the success



As the debate around the Philadelphia Eagles’ famous tush push continues, franchise legend Nick Foles has stepped in with a strong defense. The Super Bowl MVP believes the league has no valid reason to eliminate the controversial short-yardage maneuver, which has become a cornerstone of the Eagles’ identity.Speaking on Front Office Sports Today, Foles said the play’s dominance is more about execution than unfair advantage. “It’s just because the Eagles are so good at it,” he explained, pointing to the frustration of opponents who can’t seem to stop it. While he acknowledged officiating concerns—such as ensuring false starts are called correctly—he stressed that banning it would punish creativity. “You can’t get rid of a play just because a team can’t be stopped on it. ”Foles also highlighted the entertainment value the play brings to the NFL. “I think it also creates a fun energy throughout the league,” he said. “Any time it’s fourth-and-1 or third-and-1, you know what’s coming. It’s like, who’s gonna be the first one to stop it?” With Jalen Hurts’ unique skillset and the Eagles’ powerhouse offensive line, the answer has rarely been anyone.While many believe the tush push works solely because of Hurts’ strength, Foles credited the unit in front of him.“Jalen Hurts is so good at doing it. He’s a powerful runner, fierce runner. I think the key, though, to the tush push, and he would tell you this as well, is the O-line. The O-line does a great job of getting leverage early.”The play narrowly survived an offseason motion to ban it, but calls have resurfaced this year after more Eagles success and some questionable no-calls. With the conversation heating up again, the question remains: will owners listen to Foles’ defense, or could this be the final season for the tush push?Also Read: Patriots fan Bill Simmons slams Bill Belichick’s public humiliation with Jordon Hudson during shocking UNC drama","Nick foles says nfl has no reason to ban philadelphia eagles' tush push.

Detroit Lions send film to NFL after repeated low blocks against Aidan Hutchinson raise concern

NFL rules on low blocks and chop blocks

The Detroit Lions are worried about the blocking methods being used against their standout defensive end Aidan Hutchinson in the first few games of the 2025 NFL season. Reports say the team has sent video proof to the NFL league office, pointing out cases of low blocks during their games against the Green Bay Packers in Week 1 and the Chicago Bears in Week 2.Aidan Hutchinson suffered a broken tibia and fibula in the fifth game of the 2024 season. This injury ended his season, even though he was on track for a record-breaking performance with 7.5 sacks at that time.After that, he made a complete recovery and showed impressive form during the 2025 training camp. In the first two games of the 2025 regular season, he recorded two combined tackles and one sack, raising his career total to 29.5 sacks. His sack in Week 2 was against Chicago Bears quarterback Caleb Williams.The issues arise from the early games where opponents looked to target Hutchinson's legs with low blocks. Adam Schefter, an ESPN insider, reported this during the Monday Night Countdown on ESPN before the Lions faced the Baltimore Ravens in Week 3 on September 23, 2025.He pointed out that the Detroit Lions provided film from their matches against the Packers and Bears, showcasing specific examples of what they believe to be illegal or intentional low blocks.The Detroit Lions decided to send the film because they noticed Hutchinson was getting hit with low blocks repeatedly, which they think could lead to more injuries after his recent recovery. Schefter talked about it on Monday Night Countdown, ""The Detroit Lions have taken notice, and they've asked the league office to monitor the plays against Aidan Hutchinson. Not that that will protect him out there, but clearly people have noticed some of the plays, and the Lions want the league office to notice as well. ""Schefter further elaborated on the context of Hutchinson's injury history: ""He’s coming off the fractured tibia and fibula. If you watch his performance the first two games of the year, what stands out about that is the fact that it feels like opponents have been going low on him, so much so that the Lions have raised the issue with the league office."" He directed viewers to review film from the Week 1 game: ""If you go back and look at the film from the first game, take a look at how Green Bay is coming at Aidan Hutchinson's legs. ""Another way to look at it is that in the NFL, you can legally make low blocks targeting a player's legs or below the thigh, as long as it's done in isolation. But if a player is already engaged high by one opponent and then gets hit low by another, that's a chop block and it's against the rules. This kind of foul results in a 15-yard penalty for the team on offense.Former NFL defensive lineman and ESPN analyst Marcus Spears talked about this in the same Monday Night Countdown segment. Spears mentioned, ""It’s unfortunate, and obviously, (the complaint) is raised because of the injury that he suffered. Obviously, I’m not a fan of the cut block. I think it should have been banned a long time ago, with game safety. But that is a normal football play. And because of those tight ends, they are not going to try to block you straight up. They are going to try to get you on the ground. It’s taught that way.""Also Read: Kansas City Chiefs charge against New York Giants with Taylor Swift nowhere in sight Spears recognized that some cut blocks are legal, but he shared his personal concerns about using them, particularly against players like Hutchinson who are coming back from leg injuries.","Detroit lions send film to nfl after repeated low blocks against aidan hutchinson raise concern.

Paris Saint-Germain winger Ousmane Dembele capped off a career-defining year by winning the Ballon d’Or 2025 on Monday, rewarding his pivotal role in PSG’s historic Champions League triumph. The Frenchman edged out Barcelona teenager Lamine Yamal to succeed 2024 winner Rodri as football’s most prestigious individual prize returned to Paris.Dembele, 28, enjoyed a spectacular campaign after being converted into a centre-forward following Kylian Mbappe’s departure to Real Madrid. He delivered an astonishing 35 goals across all competitions, firing PSG to a domestic double and their long-awaited first Champions League crown. The crowning moment came in Munich, where PSG demolished Inter Milan 5-0 in the final.“I really don’t have the words. It was an incredible season with PSG,” said a visibly emotional Dembele at the Théâtre du Châtelet in Paris. The Frenchman credited head coach Luis Enrique — who also took home the award for club coach of the year — as “like a father” in guiding his transformation.Despite celebrating individual glory, Dembele stressed the team’s role in his success: “It is an individual trophy but it was really the collective that won it.”While Dembele lifted the men’s prize, Aitana Bonmati of Spain claimed the Women’s Ballon d’Or for the third year running, beating her international teammate Mariona Caldentey.

Bill Belichick faces mounting pressure after UCF loss



AI distractions overshadow UNC’s on-field reality



It used to be a lighthearted storyline, but now the situation surrounding Bill Belichick at North Carolina feels more troubling. The legendary former New England Patriots coach, now 73, has stumbled badly in his first month leading the Tar Heels. A 34-9 blowout loss to UCF dropped his team to 1-3, leaving fans wondering if this experiment is unraveling faster than anyone imagined.Belichick’s transition to college football was never going to be simple, but the early signs have been brutal. Three lopsided defeats in four games have tested both his legacy and patience. Adding to the drama is his 24-year-old girlfriend, Jordon Hudson, whose constant presence on the sidelines and in the tunnel after games continues to stir debate. Her visibility has become part of the conversation around Belichick’s tenure, whether he likes it or not.Sports media voices have not held back. Bill Simmons, speaking on The Bill Simmons Podcast, admitted his dismay at watching his football hero endure such struggles. ""[Me and] all my Pats fans, we're just like, 'wow',"" Simmons said. ""Could this be going worse? Like this is the greatest NFL coach of all time. This has been the most humiliating year ever.He's getting his a* kicked in these games. He's got this 25 year old coming on the sidelines when he's trying to coach. Like, how did he get to this point?""*As if defeats weren’t enough, digital noise has made the situation even murkier. A viral AI-altered video appeared to show Belichick and Hudson sharing a sideline kiss. The clip, viewed nearly 5 million times, later proved fake. Yet it only intensified the circus, leaving the on-field product overshadowed by online chatter.For now, UNC fans are desperate for wins, not memes. But until Belichick finds a way to stabilize the Tar Heels, his coaching comeback may remain defined less by football and more by the noise surrounding it.Also Read: Chiefs’ Travis Kelce and Andy Reid get into fiery sideline argument on live broadcast: Is everything going well between these two?","Bill belichick's north carolina tar heels are 1-3 after a 34-9 loss to ucf.

Dallas Cowboys star WR CeeDee Lamb is looking at potential multi-week absence due to high ankle sprain suffered during Week 3 loss to Chicago Bears

Fans react to CeeDee Lamb’s latest high ankle sprain update shared by NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport

Also Read:

On September 22, NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport reported on Good Morning Football that Dallas Cowboys star wide receiver CeeDee Lamb suffered a high ankle sprain. Rapoport stated, “My understanding is that the Cowboys believe this is a high ankle sprain for CeeDee Lamb. Going to have some tests today, including an MRI just to determine the severity.” Rapoport noted that high ankle sprains generally require four to six weeks for recovery. However, owner Jerry Jones believes the injury is not as serious as it could have been, adding, “We will keep our fingers crossed.”On September 22, BVM Sports reported that CeeDee Lamb returned briefly after suffering the injury when a Bears player(linebacker Noah Sewell) landed on his ankle. But Lamb’s condition appears serious enough to disrupt his playing schedule significantly. Initial assessments suggest he could be sidelined for four to six weeks. Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones and Lamb, however, both remain hopeful that he may return to play in Week 4 against the Green Bay Packers. If Lamb does not play against the Packers, Cowboys wide receiver George Pickens may need to step up in his absence.On watching the clip shared by Good Morning Football, one concerned fan asked, “CeeDee gonna be okay?” Another expressed, “While CeeDee Lamb’s high-ankle sprain might not sideline him as long as feared, the Cowboys’ offense could still face challenges if he’s not at full speed, potentially exposing their reliance on his playmaking.” A third fan does not want to pour their trust in George Pickens: “Hoping its not bad, because Pickens doesn't look like the answer. ” A fourth fan commented, “Cowboys need CeeDee Lamb back ASAP.” A fifth fan looked so worried, “Isn’t as bad?? It’s season ending!! We will be 1-8 by the time he comes back and with that he will just steal money!!”","Dallas cowboys star wr ceedee lamb is looking at potential multi-week absence due to high ankle sprain suffered during week 3 loss to chicago bears.

The 2025 NFL season rolls into Week 3 with a high-stakes Monday Night Football matchup between the Detroit Lions and the Baltimore Ravens at M&T Bank Stadium. Both teams enter the night with 1–1 records after dominant Week 2 wins, and now meet under the lights in what could be one of the most physical and fast-paced games of the early season.The biggest headline for Detroit ahead of kickoff? Quarterback Jared Goff is officially cleared and ready to start. Goff, who’s coming off a strong performance last week, is expected to lead the Lions offense without any injury concerns as they face a banged-up Ravens defense.Yes, Jared Goff is fully cleared and will start for the Detroit Lions in tonight’s primetime clash against the Baltimore Ravens. Goff is not listed on the injury report and will be under center as the Lions try to build on their Week 2 blowout win over the Chicago Bears. The veteran quarterback has thrown six touchdown passes through the first two weeks of the season, along with just one interception. He’s shown strong command of the offense and enters Week 3 with momentum and full support from the coaching staff.With a clean bill of health, Jared Goff steps into his biggest test of the season so far against a talented but injury-hit Baltimore defense. The Lions will look to lean on Goff’s poise and accuracy as they attack a Ravens front seven that will be missing key starters, including Nnamdi Madubuike and Kyle Van Noy.Goff will have plenty of firepower around him. Amon-Ra St. Brown continues to be a reliable weapon across the middle, while Jameson Williams adds deep-threat potential. In the backfield, expect Detroit to mix in a heavy dose of the run game and play-action looks to keep Goff clean and the Ravens’ pass rush off balance.This primetime battle could come down to execution in key moments. With Jared Goff healthy and in rhythm, the Lions offense is expected to target Baltimore’s weakened defensive front, especially between the tackles. Bijan Robinson and Detroit’s ground game could play a big role in setting the tone early. Look for matchups across the middle, especially with St. Brown working against Baltimore’s coverage. If Goff can avoid pressure and limit turnovers, Detroit has a strong shot at stealing a road win and moving to 2-1.On the other side, Lamar Jackson will look to keep Detroit’s defense off balance with his legs and creativity. The Ravens will need big plays from depth defenders like Aeneas Peebles and Mike Green as they look to replace production from injured starters.It’s a true test for both teams — but with Goff healthy and in form, the Lions are hoping to make a major statement in front of a national audience.",Jared goff is fully cleared and will start for the detroit lions against the baltimore ravens.
