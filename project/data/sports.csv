Mike Johnson on Auston Matthews‚Äô recent struggles

Mike Johnson , a former NHL player and analyst, expressed concern over Auston Matthews ' current form, noting a slight dip in his explosiveness on the ice. He highlighted that Matthews' game relies on quick bursts, not necessarily outright speed, but rather his ability to stop and start efficiently, win puck battles, protect the puck, and get his shot off effectively.Mike Johnson observed that Auston Matthews seems to be lacking that extra sharpness, which could be due to fatigue rather than an injury. However, he stressed that Matthews needs to regain this aspect of his game, especially with the playoffs approaching, as it plays a crucial role in his overall effectiveness on the ice.During an interview on First Up on Thursday, Mike Johnson remarked,""When he‚Äôs at his best, he has that fractionally more explosive burst in his game. Not necessarily blowing past guys, but stopping and starting, winning puck battles, protecting the puck, and getting his shot off. Right now, he doesn‚Äôt quite have that same explosiveness. That might be more fatigue-related than injury-related, but it‚Äôs something he needs to get back.""In addition to Matthews' form, Johnson also touched on Toronto's potential interest in acquiring veteran forward Brayden Schenn ahead of the trade deadline. While Schenn could bring valuable experience and physicality to the roster, Johnson questioned whether the cost of acquiring him‚Äîlikely in the form of draft picks or young assets‚Äîwould be too steep for the Leafs, given their current needs and salary cap situation.As the playoffs approach, the Maple Leafs will need their star players, especially Auston Matthews, to be at their best. While the team has performed well despite his dip in production, his ability to regain his explosiveness could be the key to a deep postseason run. Meanwhile, the front office faces crucial decisions, including whether acquiring a player like Brayden Schenn is worth the potential cost. With big games ahead, all eyes will be on Matthews and the Leafs as they push toward the playoffs.Also Read: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been worried‚Äù: Nick Robertson sent a blunt message clarifying his future with the Toronto Maple Leafs","Mike johnson, a former nhl player and analyst, expressed concern over auston matthews'current form, noting a slight dip in his explosiveness on the ice.

David Pastr≈à√°k would happily exchange his individual streak for the Bruins

Joe Sacco and select players speak to the media following the Bruins 2-1 loss to the Islanders.

The Boston Bruins played short forward during their game against the New York Islanders on Thursday evening. David Pastr≈à√°k was the only scorer for the Bruins as they lost to the New York Islanders 2-1, taking his point streak in the NHL to 16 games.This equals the Czech record which was earlier established by Jaromir J√°gr and Robert Lang. The 28-year-old winger, who has recorded 14 goals and 17 assists in this span, reached a milestone with his 800th NHL point. Pastr≈à√°k scored in the 51st minute on a feed from Pavel Zacha, cutting the deficit to 2-1, but Boston could not take advantage, losing its fifth consecutive game.David Pastr≈à√°k stretched his point streak to 16 games, but it was overshadowed by the loss of the Boston Bruins 2-1 at home to the New York Islanders. Even while Pastr≈à√°k reached that benchmark, he complained about how nothing matters in his individual performance if the team itself is underperforming. With the Bruins suffering their fifth straight loss (0-3-2), he conceded he would happily exchange his individual streak for wins, pointing to the frustration of the team as they seek to end their slump.""Yeah, I mean, I said it ‚Äî I would give up the point streak for wins,‚Äù he said. ""I‚Äôm playing a team sport, so I just want to get it up and get back on a winning streak.

Champions Trophy: How good is Virat Kohli in football? | Rishabh Pant recovers from viral

DUBAI: At a time when Pakistan's cricket team has been panned left, right and centre by many of the country's former players - now experts on TV shows - and the disgruntled public, there is someone who is not willing to be as harsh on Mohammad Rizwan & Co. In an exclusive interview with TOI from London, where he currently lives, former Pakistan captain Asif Iqbal asserted that ""nothing is wrong with Pakistan cricket ,"" while pointing out that ""no one is talking about what's wrong with English cricket .""Like Pakistan, England too were knocked out of the 2025 ICC Champions Trophy , when they lost their first two matches in Group B to Australia and Afghanistan at Lahore.""Nothing is wrong with Pakistan cricket. The other teams are playing better cricket than Pakistan. Whether batting first or chasing, we lost because our opponents played better cricket than us. Why is no one talking about what‚Äôs wrong with English cricket? Batting first, they couldn‚Äôt defend 351, and batting second, they couldn‚Äôt chase down 326. I have a totally different view on this,"" Iqbal told TOI.Summing up Pakistan's six-wicket defeat to India at the Dubai International Stadium beautifully in one line, Iqbal, 82, who played 58 Tests and 10 ODIs for Pakistan between 1964 to 1980, said, ""We were outplayed in every department, except the toss!""""The reason for this hype is the expectation of the supporters of both teams that their team is better than their opponents and not realistic enough to accept that the present Indian team is on the top of rankings and we are at the bottom,"" Iqbal said.Explaining his point, Iqbal said, ""Look, I want to emphasise here that the expectations of the Indian and Pakistani fans makes an Indo-Pak contest look like the clash of the titans. The fact is that you call it a clash of the titans when, for example, in tennis, No 1 ranked player plays a No 3, or No 4 ranked player, it will be billed as the clash of the titans. However, if a superstar and all-time great like Novak Djokovic plays a 100th ranked player in the second round, he will be expected to win, and if he loses, it will be termed as a 'shock'. Likewise, if Pakistan beat India, or any other team, in an ICC event, that other team must have a very bad day. And I'm not belittling Pakistan here, but stating the reality. Pakistan has lost to a second-string South Africa and New Zealand at home recently. So, for me, it wasn't a surprise that they lost to India and New Zealand in the 2025 Champions Trophy. Ultimately, these are the players that we have. It's better to give them confidence. TV pe gaali-goj (criticising them) won't help.""While India aren‚Äôt playing a match at Sharjah, a place where Iqbal was instrumental in starting international cricket and once a famous venue for India-Pakistan matches, the Pakistan great was saddened by India refusing to travel to Pakistan to play their matches in the 2025 Champions Trophy. ""More importantly India is not playing in Pakistan in an ICC tournament. Really sad."" he said.Raving about Indian superstar Virat Kohli , who bounced back into form by scoring his 51st ODI hundred, against Pakistan at the Dubai International Stadium on Sunday night, Iqbal said, ""Yet again, Virat has shown that form is temporary, but class is permanent. The beauty about Virat is that when the stakes are higher, his concentration levels go up, and his delivery rate goes higher. It's amazing how he manages to keep doing this,"" Iqbal gushed.Impressed by how the likes of Shubman Gill and Shreyas Iyer have added muscle to India's ODI batting line-up, he said, ""India are fortunate to have the best bench strength in the cricketing world. If someone is injured or unavailable, they immediately have someone to replace him. It means a lot for the future of their game. Not many teams have this luxury.‚ÄùPraising Afghanistan for their fine show in ICC tournaments, Iqbal said, ""Before the tournament began, I had said that I expected Afghanistan to beat at least one top ranked team in their group, and they've done that by beating England. They are building into a good side, one of the top teams in world cricket.""","Former pakistan captain asif iqbal tells toi that ""nothing is wrong with pakistan cricket"" the 82-year-old also says that ""no one is talking about what's wrong with english cricket"" pakistan lost six-wicket defeat to india at the dubai international stadium.

Travis Kelce has three hard-and-fast rules in his relationship with Taylor Swift

Travis Kelce, the 35-year-old Kansas City Chiefs player, allegedly has three hard-and-fast rules in his relationship with Taylor Swift, also 35. The two, who started dating over the summer of 2023, are frequently spotted together and have both attained tremendous success in their careers‚ÄîSwift as one of the world's largest music icons and Kelce as a vital member of the Chiefs. Even with their great push, the Chiefs failed to reach the Super Bowl following a 40-22 defeat to the Philadelphia Eagles on February 9.The Kansas City Chiefs superstar Travis Kelce has three hard and fast rules when it comes to his relationship with singer Taylor Swift. Dating since summer 2023, the two are regularly spotted together and are a hot topic for fans and the media. Swift is among the world's leading musicians, and Kelce is an integral part of the Chiefs, who came up short of the Super Bowl after a 40-22 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles on February 9.According to the Life and Style Magazine, through MSN, Taylor Swift apparently has some 'rules' about how Kelce can stay in contact with her and whom the football player can socialize with during his free time.‚ÄúThey‚Äôll be doing lots of texting and calling, too, but Taylor likes to see Travis in real time,‚Äù a source said. ‚ÄúShe likes to know where he is and who he‚Äôs with. It‚Äôs not that she doesn‚Äôt trust him; she just wants to feel connected. Taylor loves Travis‚Äô energy and spontaneity, but she doesn‚Äôt want him wasted at the bar with pals. He can celebrate his wins in style with her and their friends.‚ÄùBeing a high-level athlete, Travis Kelce probably does not have much of his free time spent in bars, considering the strenuous nature of his profession. Otherwise, when he is not training or on the field, he co-hosts the extremely popular New Heights podcast with his brother Jason Kelce, a retired NFL great. The podcast has attracted an enormous following and gives fans an inside look at football and the brothers' personal lives.The third rule in the relationship of Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift is one that is most argued about. The couple has reportedly agreed to not be seen with others of the opposite gender to avoid gossip and speculation. This ruling, though questionable, is probably a move to preserve their privacy and keep away from extra reinforcement from their respective professions.‚ÄúTaylor‚Äôs been in this biz long enough to know what comes with being in the spotlight,‚Äù they added.The Chiefs star recently disclosed his relationship during an appearance on the Stephen A. Smith Show. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm enjoying all aspects of life,"" said Kelce. ""Me and Taylor are happy and I couldn‚Äôt be happier to enjoy that confidence off the field and all the support I could ever ask for at the stadium.""He added, ‚ÄúI think personally, the beauty of being in a very strong relationship is that you get that support to be able to come in and focus on your craft, focus on being the best version of you. I think I‚Äôm as focused as I‚Äôve ever been on my job and being the best player that I could possibly be week in, week out for this team.""Also Read: ‚ÄúEnjoyed a quiet night‚Äù: Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift return to the spotlight following international getaway after Chiefs' Super Bowl loss","Travis kelce, 35, and taylor swift, also 35, started dating over the summer of 2023.
