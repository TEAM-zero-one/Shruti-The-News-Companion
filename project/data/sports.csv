Pakistani cricket player Haider Ali , 24, was arrested by Greater Manchester Police on rape charges . The incident allegedly occurred on July 23, 2025, in Manchester. He was released on bail while investigations continue. The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has suspended him and is providing legal support during the UK investigation.Ali's cricket career began promisingly. He made his mark in the 2020 PSL with Peshawar Zalmi, scoring 239 runs with an impressive strike rate over 157. His international debut was memorable, scoring 54 runs off 33 balls in Manchester, helping Pakistan win by five runs.One of his international matches thereon came against India in the 2022 T20 World Cup in Australia where he scored just 2 runs before being dismissed by Hardik Pandya . During that match in October 2022, played at Melbourne Cricket Ground, Haider couldn't make a name for himself in arguably the biggest game in the sport as he holed out to Suryakumar Yadav.Despite his explosive batting style, Ali has struggled with consistency in his career. He has played two ODIs and 35 T20Is for Pakistan. The Shaheens tour was seen as a chance for him to return to form and fit into Pakistan's aggressive T20 playing style.Ali was touring with Pakistan's Shaheens squad, their 'A' team, in England when the arrest happened in Beckenham. He played all five games of the tour, including matches before and after the alleged incident. He was set to join the team in Australia for a T20 series but has been replaced by Mohammad Faiq.The police have said: ""After receiving a report on Monday 4 August 2025 of a rape, we have arrested a 24-year-old man. It's alleged that the incident occurred on Wednesday 23 July 2025 at a premises in Manchester. The man has since been bailed pending further enquiries.

Kolkata: Football fans continued to turn stadiums into spaces of protest, using giant tifos to voice political and social anguish. Mohun Bagan supporters displayed a banner during their Saturday match at Salt Lake stadium, protesting against insults to the Bengali language and people. The banner appeared two days after East Bengal fans made a similar gesture during the match against Namdhari FC. On Saturday, Mohun Bagan beat DHFC 5-1 to head into the Durand Cup quarter-finals.The green-and-maroon stands featured a giant tifo displaying lines from a Tagore song: ""Bangalir pon, Bangalir asha, Bangalir kaj, Bangalir bhasha ‚Äî Satya houk, Satya houk, Satya houk hey bhogoban (The honour of the Bengali, the hope of the Bengali, the work of the Bengali, the language of the Bengali ‚Äî let it be true, let it be true, let it be true, oh God)."" Below it, another banner read: ""Deshta karor baaper noy, noyko jaater khela, ei Bangali-i ghuchiechhilo paradhinatar jwala (This country doesn't belong to anyone's father, nor is it a game of caste, it was the Bengalis who brought independence). ""The banners condemned the recent labelling of Bengali-speaking people as ""Bangladeshi"", a sentiment many in the state say undermines the cultural contributions and sacrifices of Bengalis in the freedom struggle and Indian nation-building.In 1905, Bengalis used this song as a weapon in the anti-partition movement during Banga Bhanga protests. Back then, Bengal united in the Ra-khibandhan festival led by Tagore. This year's protest also coincided with Rakhi. The tifo by Mariners D√© Xtreme - Ultras of Mohun Bagan featured portraits of Bengali icons, like Tagore, Kazi Nazrul Islam, Swami Vivekananda, Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, and Khudiram Bose.""This tifo is to send a message across India ‚Äî the issue of Bangladeshi immigrants must be resolved through the joint efforts of central and state govts. But none should question our existence or our language,"" an admin member of the fan club said.A smaller tifo read: ""Jana Gana Mana Vande Mataram. Bangla Bhasha Maayer Soman (Jana Gana Mana, Vande Mataram, Bangla bhasha is equal to mother)"" while another said: ""Shahider Rokto Kobir Nobel, Bharater Mukute Bangla Jewel (The blood of martyrs, the poet's Nobel, Bengali is a jewel in India's crown).""","Mohun bagan supporters displayed a banner during their saturday match at salt lake stadium, protesting against insults to the bengali language and people.

Raptors‚Äô Perspective

A Potential Turning Point for Chicago

The, still in the thick of a rebuild after missing the postseason in seven of the past eight years, could be preparing for a significant roster shake-up. A recent trade pitch from Mark Morales-Smith of SI.com suggests the team could send forwardto thein exchange for wing scorer RJ Barrett.Morales-Smith‚Äôs mock deal positions Barrett as a potential cornerstone for the Chicago Bulls ‚Äô young core, which already features Josh Giddey , Matas Buzelis, Isaac Okoro, and recent No. 12 pick Noa Essengue.The Chicago Bulls remains in a contract stalemate with Giddey this summer, but plans to offer him a long-term extension are in motion. With promising frontcourt depth in place, the front office could be open to moving on from Patrick Williams, whose production hasn‚Äôt matched expectations since being drafted fourth overall in 2020.Despite an underwhelming track record, the Bulls extended Patrick Williams in June 2024 on a five-year, $90 million deal.Trading him for Barrett - who has posted All-Star-level numbers - would immediately give Chicago a dynamic scoring threat. Barrett would likely slot in as the team‚Äôs No. 1 offensive option, replacing some of the load that might be lost if Coby White departs in free agency next summer.Barrett, 25, has consistently proven his offensive value, averaging at least 19.6 points per game in each of the last four seasons. In his first full season with Toronto during 2024-25, he delivered:His scoring ability, rebounding presence, and playmaking would not only boost Chicago‚Äôs offense but also bring balance to a roster currently leaning on young talent with untapped potential.For the Toronto Raptors , this deal could be about adding long-term assets while gaining a young forward in Patrick Williams, who still carries upside despite inconsistent performance. Jevon Carter‚Äôs inclusion adds depth at the guard spot, and the first-round pick strengthens the Raptors‚Äô asset base.Also read: Warriors Rumors: Golden State Predicted to Cut Ties with Jonathan Kuminga for $69 Million Chicago Bulls Superstar Morales-Smith summed up the reasoning behind the swap by noting that moving on from Patrick Williams for Barrett ‚Äúwould fit Chicago‚Äôs rebuild and provide the team with a talented wing to pair with its young core.‚Äù If executed, the trade could mark a decisive step in reshaping the Chicago Bulls into a competitive force in the Eastern Conference over the next few seasons.","A recent trade pitch from mark morales-smith of si.com suggests the team could send forward patrick williams to the toronto raptors in exchange for wing scorer rj barrett.

Poll Has Mohammed Siraj proven himself as a leading pace bowler for India in Test cricket? Absolutely No Jasprit Bumrah is still the leader

Former Pakistan fast bowler Wasim Akram has stated that Mohammed Siraj has evolved beyond being just a support bowler to Jasprit Bumrah and is now capable of leading India's pace attack in Test cricket.Siraj demonstrated this by taking nine wickets in the recent Oval Test against England, helping India secure a six-run victory and level the five-match series, particularly with his crucial performance on the final day where he claimed three of the remaining four wickets when England needed just 35 runs.Siraj played all five Tests in the series against England, bowling over 185 overs and maintaining his intensity throughout the matches.""Siraj was full of hunger and passion ‚Äì it was an incredible effort. To bowl nearly 186 overs across five Tests and still be that fiery on the final day shows remarkable stamina and mental strength.

Siraj made that possible,"" said Akram.The former Pakistan captain also commended India's strategic decision to rest Bumrah for the series decider.""It takes a brave team to rest their best bowler. But India had the bench strength, and the plan worked perfectly,"" he said.""With the Asia Cup in 2025 and the T20 World Cup in 2026 coming up, this kind of foresight is essential. Bumrah is vital across formats, and managing him well is key,"" he added.The match at the Oval showcased Siraj's evolution as a frontline bowler for India, with his performance helping the team achieve a memorable victory despite the absence of Bumrah. His ability to maintain intensity throughout the series and deliver crucial breakthroughs has earned him recognition from cricket experts like Wasim Akram.This performance has established Siraj's credentials as a leading pace bowler for India in Test cricket, capable of shouldering responsibilities in crucial matches and delivering under pressure situations.

If any player manages to score 8 points in either of the tournaments, then he will be rewarded with the Jason‚Äôs Mark Spray (Red Ranger Cup) or the Kimberly Was Here Spray (Pink Ranger Cup) or both.Usually players get their rewards from such tournaments immediately after these end. But the Red Ranger and Pink Ranger outfits will be available to the tournament winners at the start of Chapter 6 Season 4.Apart from the two tournaments, the Season 4 Battle Pass has also featured two different power ranger skins as well - the Green Ranger and the White Ranger.","Red and pink power ranger cups will grant players power ranger skins.

NHL eligibility hurdle looms despite growing Oilers buzz

Former NHL goaltender and current analyst Devan Dubnyk believes Carter Hart‚Äôs road back to the league could lead straight to Edmonton. Speaking on Oilers Nation, Dubnyk didn‚Äôt just throw out Hart‚Äôs name as a possible fit ‚Äî he explained why the Oilers‚Äô environment could finally allow the 26-year-old netminder to deliver on the potential many saw in him early in his career.Devan Dubnyk skated with Carter Hart over the summer and was impressed by both his conditioning and mentality. ‚ÄúCarter Hart has all the tools to be a top NHL goalie. Philadelphia hasn‚Äôt been the easiest place for long-term goalie success, but he‚Äôs still young and in his prime years. I‚Äôve skated with him, and he‚Äôs been training the entire time. He looked great,‚Äù Dubnyk said.The Edmonton Oilers, who have long been searching for playoff reliability in net, could see Hart as both a competitive push for current starter Stuart Skinner and a potential successor if needed. Dubnyk stressed that while Hart might show ‚Äúsome rust at first,‚Äù the risk would be minimal compared to the possible reward. With Edmonton‚Äôs offensive firepower, a confident and focused Hart could flourish.There‚Äôs one major obstacle: Hart remains ineligible to play in the NHL ‚Äúuntil further notice‚Äù due to league restrictions following the now-closed Hockey Canada sexual assault investigation. While Hart and others were cleared of criminal charges, the NHL has not yet granted him the green light to return.That uncertainty hasn‚Äôt stopped the speculation mill. Edmonton‚Äôs need for stability in goal, combined with Hart‚Äôs upside and potential affordability, keeps them at the center of the conversation.
