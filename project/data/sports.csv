Shubman Gill story: From a remote village near the border to India’s Test captain

Poll Will the absence of Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli affect the team's performance? Yes, significantly No, the team is strong

FULL SQUAD:

NEW DELHI: The BCCI on Saturday announced a new-look Test squad for the upcoming five-match series against England, with 25-year-old Shubman Gill named as the new captain. The tour, which is part of the 2025–27 ICC World Test Championship cycle, will take place in England between June and August 2025, with matches scheduled at Headingley (Leeds), Edgbaston (Birmingham), Lord’s (London), Old Trafford (Manchester), and The Oval (London).This series marks the beginning of a new chapter for Indian Test cricket following the recent retirements of senior stalwarts Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli.With Rohit stepping away from Test cricket earlier this month, Shubman was widely tipped to take over the leadership role. A consistent performer in all formats and already seen as a long-term prospect, the young opener will now lead the team in one of its most challenging overseas assignments.Wicketkeeper-batter Rishabh Pant has been appointed as Gill’s deputy. India have included two wicketkeepers in the squad — Pant and promising youngster Dhruv Jurel.Star pacer Jasprit Bumrah returns to the squad after a back injury that ruled him out of action for nearly three months, including India’s victorious ICC Champions Trophy 2025 campaign.Also See: India Test Squad Announcement The 18-member squad features three prominent inclusions — Karun Nair, Arshdeep Singh, and Sai Sudharsan — all rewarded for their stellar performances in domestic cricket.This is a maiden call-up for both Sudharsan and Arshdeep.Karun, who famously scored a triple century against England in 2016, makes a comeback after last playing a Test in 2017. The right-hander was prolific in the 2024–25 domestic season, scoring 863 runs in nine Ranji Trophy matches with four centuries, and 779 runs in eight Vijay Hazare Trophy innings, including five centuries.Nair, already part of the India A setup, is expected to play a key role during the England tour.With Mohammed Shami missing out due to injury, the selectors have reinforced the pace unit. The attack will be led by Bumrah and Mohammed Siraj, and also features Prasidh Krishna, Akash Deep, Arshdeep Singh, Reddy, and Shardul Thakur — offering a mix of experience and youth suited for English conditions.In the spin department, Ravindra Jadeja and Washington Sundar have been included as all-round options, while Kuldeep Yadav has been named the lone specialist spinner.Ahead of the main series, India will play two India ‘A’ matches against the England Lions, with the first game scheduled for May 30 at the St. Lawrence Ground in Canterbury.Rohit Sharma officially retired from Test cricket on May 7, bringing down the curtain on an illustrious 11-year career. He played 67 Tests, scoring 4,301 runs at an average of 40.57, with 12 centuries and 18 fifties.Virat Kohli, too, bid adieu to the longest format earlier this month. The former India captain leaves behind a legendary legacy in red-ball cricket, having played 123 Tests and scored 9,230 runs at an average of 46.85, including 30 centuries and 31 half-centuries. He retires as India’s fourth-highest run-scorer in Tests.Shubman Gill (c), Rishabh Pant (wk/vc), Yashasvi Jaiswal, KL Rahul, Sai Sudharsan, Abhimanyu Easwaran, Karun Nair, Nitish Kumar Reddy, Ravindra Jadeja, Dhruv Jurel (wk), Washington Sundar, Shardul Thakur, Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Siraj, Prasidh Krishna, Akash Deep, Arshdeep Singh, Kuldeep Yadav.","India announce new-look test squad for upcoming five-match series against england. 25-year-old shubman gill named as the new captain.

Taylor Swift’s quiet date night with Travis Kelce in Palm Beach sparks concern amid Blake Lively drama

Travis Kelce trains hard while Taylor Swift seeks peace of mind

P op superstar Taylor Swift and NFL tight end Travis Kelce were spotted together on a subdued date night in Palm Beach, Florida, drawing both fan admiration and media speculation. The couple, usually vibrant and playful in public, appeared noticeably restrained as they exited Harry’s restaurant late Friday evening, marking one of their few public sightings this year.Observers noted Taylor Swift looked “a little down,” a contrast to her usual radiant demeanor. While she eventually relaxed over dinner—reportedly enjoying a glass of white wine and smiling while placing her order—the somber mood raised eyebrows. It’s a shift that many believe stems from recent personal upheaval involving longtime friend Blake Lively and actor Justin Baldoni.The typically private Swift was drawn into an unexpected legal conflict between Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni, a dispute that reportedly threatened to expose personal messages between the singer and the Gossip Girl actress. A subpoena issued earlier this month demanded Swift’s involvement, but it has since been withdrawn.Despite the legal resolution, the emotional strain seems to linger.According to reports, Baldoni’s legal team claimed that Lively had ""pressured Swift to publicly side with her,"" potentially putting their friendship—and Swift’s reputation—on the line. The singer, known for her meticulous control over her public image, remained silent throughout the ordeal, avoiding public comment and any legal entanglements that could compromise her privacy.While Swift takes time off from touring to recover emotionally and mentally, Kelce is taking a different approach to the offseason. The Kansas City Chiefs star has been laser-focused on fitness, reportedly shedding 25 pounds and undergoing grueling training sessions in Miami ahead of the team’s May 27 activities.“Travis Kelce confidently shows off his hairy back during an intense offseason workout session,” a headline teased, showcasing his transformation and commitment to a stronger 2025 season. After a tough Super Bowl loss to the Eagles in February, Kelce appears determined to bounce back.Also Read: “A lovely gentleman?”: Taylor Swift’s past praise for Diddy resurfaces as he faces sex trafficking indictment The couple’s dinner in West Palm Beach, though low-key, offered a glimpse into the contrasting worlds they currently occupy— Taylor Swift navigating emotional tension, and Kelce doubling down on football. Whether this offseason brings them closer together or highlights their individual challenges remains to be seen.

Derek Green’s football roots and surprising career shift

From mystery man to Insta-official: Gracie and Derek’s budding romance

Gracie Hunt, the glamorous daughter of Kansas City Chiefs owner Clark Hunt, is once again in the spotlight—this time not for the team’s Super Bowl success, but for her new relationship. After much speculation and cryptic Instagram posts, the mystery man in Gracie’s life has finally been revealed as Derek Green, the son of former NFL quarterback and Chiefs legend Trent Green.Derek Green certainly has NFL pedigree running through his veins. His father, Trent Green, enjoyed a stellar 15-season NFL career—including six seasons with the Kansas City Chiefs—and even earned two Pro Bowl selections. While Derek initially pursued the same path, playing quarterback at Southern Methodist University (SMU) from 2018 to 2021, he later transferred to Long Island University in 2022. However, he quietly exited the gridiron, choosing not to pursue a long-term football career.Instead, Derek redirected his focus to academics and business. He graduated with a degree in finance and briefly played for the European League of Football between 2023 and 2024. According to his LinkedIn, he now works as a Sports Operations Manager at Creative Planning. His career transition may have distanced him from the football field, but it seems fate kept him close to the Chiefs family—especially now, as the boyfriend of the team owner's daughter.Gracie Hunt had fans buzzing for weeks as she shared sun-soaked vacation photos featuring a then-unnamed man. The Instagram post from May 18 featured the couple enjoying a beachside getaway with friends, and fans immediately speculated on her new beau’s identity. Alongside the romantic snapshots, Gracie wrote a heartfelt caption:“My heart is full. Grateful for some much-needed time to rest, reflect, and reset after a whirlwind few months post-football season. So thankful for time with the people who keep me grounded, remind me I’m loved, and never fail to make me laugh.”Adding to the glamour, the couple also recently traveled to Monaco with the Hunt family, likely in anticipation of the prestigious Monaco Grand Prix.Also Read: “It's happening”: Josh Allen and Hailee Steinfeld wedding buzz intensifies as Dion Dawkins backpedals on May 31 date While neither Gracie nor Derek have made an official media statement, their social media chemistry and shared Chiefs connection make one thing clear—this isn’t just a fling.

AEW Double Or Nothing Post Show Media Scrum | Glendale, AZ 5/25/25

WWE counters AEW with strategic scheduling

All Elite Wrestling (AEW) President Tony Khan didn’t hold back while addressing the growing rivalry between AEW and WWE during the post-Double or Nothing 2025 media scrum. With both promotions running events on the same weekend, Khan was asked about WWE’s recent trend of counter-programming AEW pay-per-views. His response was both historical and defiant.“It’s pretty consistent,” Khan said. “I’d say it’s the most consistent event head-to-head scheduling since Jim Crockett Promotions. Saw a lot of scheduling that went that way. And I can tell you this will go a lot differently than that did.”The comparison to Jim Crockett Promotions (JCP) is a significant one. Back in the 1980s, JCP often clashed with WWE programming, with the rivalry culminating in the WWF running Survivor Series opposite JCP’s Starrcade in 1987. The financial strain from such scheduling eventually led JCP to sell to Turner Broadcasting in 1988.Khan’s remarks come at a time when WWE appears to be intensifying its counter-programming strategy. On the same weekend as AEW’s Double or Nothing, WWE held both NXT Battleground and Saturday Night’s Main Event. Even more notably, WWE has lined up their second all-women’s premium live event, Evolution, for the day after AEW’s biggest show of the year - All In: Texas - set for July 12 at Globe Life Field in Arlington.Additionally, WWE’s programming calendar includes a European tour during AEW’s Forbidden Door event in London this August, signalling what many believe to be a clear attempt to divert attention and viewership.Despite WWE’s attempts to dominate the schedule, Khan remains optimistic and assertive. His tone during the media scrum was confident, suggesting that AEW has learned from history and is better equipped to handle such competition.While Khan didn’t reveal specific strategies to combat WWE’s moves, his message was clear: AEW isn’t intimidated, and it’s prepared to maintain its momentum in the face of growing pressure.With both companies now regularly overlapping major events, the professional wrestling landscape is heating up like never before in the modern era. For fans, it’s a flashback to the legendary Monday Night Wars of the late 1990s - only this time, the battle spans not just Monday nights but weekends and international tours as well.With AEW’s All In: Texas and Forbidden Door on the horizon, and WWE ramping up its own counter-efforts, wrestling fans could be witnessing the birth of a new golden age, where competition drives creativity and both companies are pushed to deliver their very best.What’s clear is this: the rivalry between WWE and AEW is no longer theoretical. It’s unfolding live, and the industry may be better for it.","All elite wrestling (aew) president tony khan was asked about wwe’s recent trend of counter-programming aew pay-per-views.

Brad Marchand Dairy Queen Blizzard controversy: Ice Cream snack or smart marketing strategy?



When playoff hockey is on the line, every detail matters — every goal, every pass, and apparently, every snack. But in Game 3 of the Eastern Conference Finals, the spotlight shifted from the ice to something far sweeter: Did Boston Bruins’ star Brad Marchand sneak in a Dairy Queen Blizzard between periods? What started as a casual comment has quickly turned into one of the most talked-about off-ice moments of the postseason, raising eyebrows, fueling rumors, and even hinting at a savvy marketing play.The story kicked off after Marchand’s team, the Florida Panthers, crushed the Carolina Hurricanes 6-2. During a post-game interview with Sportsnet’s Kyle Bukauskas, Marchand was asked about a viral video showing him eating something off a spoon between periods. His response? A confident admission of enjoying a “little chocolate chip cookie dough Blizzard.”However, Panthers coach Paul Maurice wasn’t so sure: “I know he said it. I’m just not sure that makes it a fact.” That doubt isn’t unfounded. Teams typically fuel their players with high-protein, performance-focused snacks like peanut butter or nuts, not sugary ice cream, especially during critical playoff games.Still, the Panthers’ recent Dairy Queen visit in North Carolina and the proximity of a DQ near their home arena make the story plausible. But could Marchand have been playing the media, delivering a sweet tease to fans and potential sponsors? His cheeky follow-up—requesting a “lifetime free supply of Dairy Queen”—suggests this might be more than just a simple snack confession.Also Read: Carolina Hurricanes set unwanted NHL record with 15 straight Eastern Conference Finals losses What’s undeniable is that whatever Marchand ate seemed to work, he scored a crucial goal shortly after his alleged Blizzard break, helping seal the Panthers’ victory.

Insights from those who played with both

For more than two decades, Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi have alternated the crowns of football with titanic achievements on club and national team levels, and an untold number of individual awards. Fans may argue for what seems like an eternity about who is better, but a small cadre of players have had the rare opportunity to play alongside both legends. They provide a unique view on how different their playing styles and personalities are, comparing Ronaldo and Messi.Many footballers have played alongside both Ronaldo and Messi, either domestically at club level or internationally, while being on the same national side.Ten such examples are instances of the following kind:The pair were attacking teammates during Di María's time at Real Madrid from 2010 to 2014. He is also a long-time compatriot of Messi with the Argentina national team and at PSG. Di María suggested Ronaldo ""was unfortunate"" to have been born in the same era as Messi, who he says is ""touched by the magic wand"" when it comes to footballing talent.Also Read: Cristiano Ronaldo’s biological age revealed: Could he extend his career to 50? Footballers who have been inside the dressing room alongside both Ronaldo and Messi have pointed out the differences in their personalities and styles of play.Ronaldo is often referred to as a hard worker, known for his particular training and as a goalscorer. Likewise, Messi is often painted as a naturally gifted player with an inborn understanding of the game and exceptional vision.These first-hand accounts offer invaluable insight into how two of football's biggest icons do things differently, enhancing the football fan's ability to appreciate not just the on-pitch performances, but qualities that go beneath the surface of the sport.","Gonzalo higuaín watched ronaldo both at real madrid and juve, and messi with argentina.

More Than a Team: The Rise of CSK & the Whistle Podu Army

THE TEAMS (FROM):

NEW DELHI: Mumbai Indians and Punjab Kings will be eager to give their all in a high-stakes clash for a top-two finish when they meet in their final league-stage fixture of the Indian Premier League here on Monday. With Gujarat Titans, Royal Challengers Bengaluru, MI, and PBKS having secured playoff spots earlier than usual, the remaining league matches will determine the final standings.Currently placed second with 17 points, PBKS risk slipping to third or even fourth with a loss to MI, which would place them in the Eliminator on May 30.Securing a top-two finish appears challenging for PBKS, as they not only need to defeat a formidable MI side but also rely on both GT (18 points) and RCB (17 points) losing their final matches.Having lost their previous game to Delhi Capitals, PBKS now find themselves in a must-win scenario against MI to stay in contention for a top-two finish.MI, on the other hand, can benefit from their superior Net Run Rate among the four playoff teams. A win against Punjab Kings, combined with losses for GT and RCB, could significantly boost their chances of securing a top-two spot.Ahead of the much-anticipated clash, RJ Mahvash—rumoured to be spinner Yuzvendra Chahal 's girlfriend—had a fan-girl moment as she met Punjab Kings co-owner and actress Preity Zinta at Rambagh Palace in Jaipur.RJ Mahvash took to Instagram to share a series of pictures and a video from the palace.""Isn't Zaara the most gorgeous?"" she wrote while sharing photos with Preity Zinta.MUMBAI INDIANS: Hardik Pandya (c), Rohit Sharma, Suryakumar Yadav, Robin Minz (wk), Ryan Rickelton (wk), Shrijith Krishnan (wk), Bevon Jacobs, Tilak Varma, Naman Dhir, Will Jacks, Mitchell Santner, Raj Angad Bawa, Raghu Sharma, Corbin Bosch, Trent Boult, Karn Sharma, Deepak Chahar, Ashwani Kumar, Reece Topley, VS Penmetsa, Arjun Tendulkar, Mujeeb Ur Rahman, Jasprit Bumrah.PUNJAB KINGS: Shreyas Iyer (c), Nehal Wadhera, Vishnu Vinod (wk), Josh Inglis (wk), Harnoor Pannu, Pyla Avinash, Prabhsimran Singh (wk), Shashank Singh, Marcus Stoinis, Harpreet Brar, Marco Jansen, Azmatullah Omarzai, Priyansh Arya, Aaron Hardie, Musheer Khan, Suryansh Shedge, Mitch Owen, Arshdeep Singh, Vyshak Vijaykumar, Yash Thakur, Kuldeep Sen, Xavier Bartlett, Pravin Dubey, Kyle Jamieson.","Mumbai indians and punjab kings meet in their final league-stage fixture of the indian premier league here on monday.

WWE Superstar Zoey Stark made her comeback to the limelight in a tragic manner on the recent episode of Monday Night RAW. What was supposed to be a critical milestone in her career, Stark got severely injured in her knee in a triple-threat qualifying match for the 2025 Women's Money in the Bank (MITB) ladder match. The incident has not only sidelined her from one of WWE’s most prestigious events but may also signal a prolonged absence from in-ring competition.The accident occurred at the Bon Secours Wellness Arena in Greenville, South Carolina, during a MITB qualifier bout between Zoey Stark, Kairi Sane, and Rhea Ripley. At its climax, Stark tried her characteristic springboard dropkick—a sportslike move that requires agility and accuracy. In targeting Kairi Sane, Stark slipped in executing the springboard, resulting in her awkwardly landing on her right leg.The blow caused her knee to bend in a distinctly unnatural manner, quite visibly startling both supporters and commentators. The match instantly became secondary as paramedics rushed onto the field to treat the hurt athlete. After the botched maneuver, Stark fell to the floor, cradling her right knee and exhibiting obvious signs of pain and distress. The referee stopped the match for a moment and motioned for medical attention. WWE ringside physicians made their way into the ring and evaluated her condition.Despite the extent of the injury, Stark first tried to leave the ring independently. She tried to stand, only to fall again, as she could no longer bear the weight of herself. Eventually, she was assisted backstage by medical personnel, affirming the severity of the ordeal.Veteran WWE play-by-play commentator Michael Cole guessed on-air that Stark may have re-aggravated an old injury. Stark had extensive knee surgery in 2021 to repair a torn ACL, MCL, and meniscus—injuries requiring months of rehabilitation.With the visual similarity and reaction of Stark, there is an increasing fear that her current injury is a recurrence or exacerbation of the same condition of the knee. But to date, WWE has not issued a formal medical diagnosis or recovery timeline. The wrestling fraternity came in support of Stark after the injury. AEW wrestler Thunder Rosa showed her concern with a heartfelt post on social media:""Wrestling is a lovely and risky sport. We leave everything on the table every time we go to the ring, and we also put a lot on the line when we do what we are passionate about. Zoey Stark, I love you, sister, and I hope that you heal soon."" — Thunder Rosa through X (previously Twitter)Zoey Stark's RAW match was her first on television since January. She had last remained an active member of the dissolved faction Pure Fusion Collective, after Sonya Deville and Shayna Baszler left. Stark was competing mainly in non-televised WWE house shows and sporadic Main Event tapings before this return.As a result of her earlier knee damage incurred during her stint in NXT, Stark was drafted to the main roster as part of the 2023 WWE Draft—a testament to how much the WWE believed in her promising future. The MITB qualifier was set to be a career-launching experience, which made her untimely injury so much more heartbreaking.With Stark out, the match went on between the remaining participants. Rhea Ripley took advantage of the situation, overpowering Kairi Sane and finishing the match with her characteristic Riptide finisher. The pinfall win earned Ripley a spot in the upcoming ladder match for Women's Money in the Bank, which is to be held on June 7. Ripley’s victory, however, was overshadowed by the concern surrounding Stark’s health, as WWE fans and analysts alike shifted focus to the severity of the injury.The extent of Stark’s injury remains unconfirmed by WWE, leaving her return date unknown. Given her history of severe knee damage, fans and medical experts fear that she could face another lengthy recovery process. This injury not only removes her from one of WWE’s most career-defining matches but also risks stalling the momentum she had just begun to regain. For now, Zoey Stark’s fans—and the WWE Universe as a whole—await official word from WWE’s medical team.",Wwe superstar zoey stark suffers a painful knee injury during mitb qualifier bout.

In a high stakes clash at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium in Jaipur, Punjab Kings and Mumbai Indians faced off in the penultimate match of the IPL 2025 league stage. The winner of this game was guaranteed a top-two finish and a place in Qualifier 1.Punjab Kings captain Shreyas Iyer won the toss and elected to field first, banking on the advantage of chasing under lights.Mumbai Indians posted a competitive total of 184 for seven, thanks to crucial contributions from Suryakumar Yadav and Hardik Pandya . Suryakumar was once again the standout performer, scoring 57 off 39 balls. In the process, he broke Sachin Tendulkar’s long-standing record to become Mumbai Indians’ highest run-scorer in a single IPL season. Hardik Pandya chipped in with a quickfire 26 off just 15 balls, providing much-needed acceleration in the death overs.Opener Ryan Rickelton gave MI a positive start with 27 off 20 balls, helping his team reach 52 for one in the powerplay despite facing a probing spell from Arshdeep Singh. Kyle Jamieson, making his debut for Punjab Kings, was taken for a few early boundaries by Rickelton but settled down as the innings progressed.Rohit Sharma played a steady hand with 24 off 21 balls, including a classy straight hit over mid-off against Marco Jansen. However, Jansen got the better of Rickelton in the sixth over, inducing a mistimed shot that was caught at mid-on. Harpreet Brar, filling in for the injured Yuzvendra Chahal, continued his impressive form by removing Rohit Sharma. Nehal Wadhera took a fine catch at long-on to complete the dismissal.Mumbai found themselves in a spot of bother at 106 for four in the 13th over. Vijaykumar Vyshak’s wide lines worked well in the middle overs, as he dismissed both Will Jacks and Tilak Varma in quick succession. But the tide turned in the 19th over when Mumbai hammered Vyshak for 23 runs. Suryakumar and Naman Dhir (20 off 12) played key roles in this late surge.Quiz: Who's that IPL player? Despite the momentum shift, Arshdeep Singh bowled a sensational final over, conceding only three runs and picking up two wickets to restrict Mumbai to 184.Punjab Kings’ chase started on a shaky note, losing Prabhsimran Singh early for 13 off 16 balls to Jasprit Bumrah. But a powerful 109-run partnership between Priyansh Arya and Josh Inglis completely turned the tide. Arya struck a composed 62 before falling to Mitchell Santner, who also claimed the wicket of Inglis after a brilliant 73 off 42 balls.Captain Shreyas Iyer stayed calm and composed, finishing the chase with an unbeaten 26 off 15 balls alongside Nehal Wadhera, who made 2 off 2. PBKS reached the target in 18.3 overs.With this result, Punjab Kings have secured a top-two finish and a spot in Qualifier 1. They will face either Gujarat Titans or Royal Challengers Bengaluru, depending on the outcome of tomorrow’s match between LSG and RCB. If RCB win, they will finish in the top two and play PBKS. If not, GT will take that second spot and face Punjab.Mumbai Indians, meanwhile, will play in the Eliminator.

Miami Dolphins are counting on Zach Wilson as Tua Tagovailoa’s backup despite past struggles,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/miami-dolphins-are-counting-on-zach-wilson-as-tua-tagovailoas-backup-despite-past-struggles/articleshow/121421126.cms,"Wilson to lead Dolphins’ backup QB role this season (Image via: Getty Images)

Why Zach Wilson is the Dolphins ’ backup QB for now



The Miami Dolphins are placing a controversial bet by entrusting Zach Wilson, once branded a draft bust by New York Jets fans with a critical backup quarterback role. With starter Tua Tagovailoa’s injury woes continuing to loom large, Miami’s hopes for offensive stability may rest heavily on a player whose NFL career has been anything but smooth. But is Wilson truly the answer, or just another gamble destined to backfire?When the Dolphins drafted Wilson from the Jets’ rubble, fans and analysts alike were skeptical. After all, Wilson’s highly touted potential seemed to evaporate under the intense pressure of the NFL spotlight. He was a No. 2 overall pick with a rocket arm but inconsistent decision-making and mounting turnovers tainted his early years. Despite that, Miami is banking on him to be their immediate contingency plan if Tua goes down again.The alternative is Quinn Ewers, Miami’s seventh-round pick out of Texas, who has yet to prove he belongs in the league. Dolphins beat writer Alain Poupart recently addressed this debate in a mailbag Q&A, emphatically stating Ewers won’t supplant Wilson anytime soon. ""It’s absolutely Wilson’s job to lose,"" Poupart insisted, the Dolphins aren’t ready to roll the dice on a rookie who’s still raw and lacks NFL seasoning.Wilson’s arm talent and experience, even if underwhelming, make him the safer choice in Miami’s eyes. Ewers, once a five-star recruit, now struggles with a comparatively weaker arm and zero pro experience, a risky proposition given the Dolphins’ championship aspirations. While Ewers might develop into a reliable backup down the line, the immediate future demands someone who can manage the offense competently at the drop of a hat.Yet, this decision leaves Miami fans uneasy. Wilson’s history of underperformance is well-documented, and his stint with the Jets was riddled with questionable throws and poor field awareness.Also Read: Cleveland Browns QB battle 2025: Dillon Gabriel, Shedeur Sanders, and Cade Klubnik’s impact on the franchise future For now, the Dolphins want Tagovailoa under center as much as possible. But when injuries strike, the team expects Wilson to step in seamlessly, or risk another year of offensive instability. It’s a high-stakes gamble on a player who has more to prove than most, and the NFL world will be watching closely to see if Miami’s faith in Wilson is redemption or another costly mistake.","The miami dolphins are placing a controversial bet by entrusting zach wilson with a critical backup quarterback role.

Browns’ 2025 quarterback battle and the potential 2026 Cade Klubnik draft pick



Shedeur Sanders is in a QB competition with Dillon Gabriel! | NFL Live

The Cleveland Browns are entering the 2025 NFL season with one of the most crowded and uncertain quarterback rooms in the league. After using two draft picks on promising young signal-callers, Dillon Gabriel in the third round and Shedeur Sanders in the fifth, the Browns have signaled a clear desire to find their next franchise quarterback. However, with veterans Kenny Pickett and Joe Flacco also competing, and star Deshaun Watson sidelined for the season with a torn Achilles, the battle for the starting QB spot is anything but settled.Dillon Gabriel, taken in the third round, and Shedeur Sanders, a fifth-round pick, both bring promising skill sets but have yet to prove they can lead an NFL offense long-term. Gabriel’s strong arm and pocket presence contrast with Sanders’ exciting dual-threat ability and high-profile college career. Meanwhile, Pickett and Flacco offer experience but are unlikely to be long-term answers. With Watson sidelined, the Browns have no clear-cut starter, making this quarterback competition one of the fiercest in the NFL.Looking beyond 2025, the Browns may still be searching for stability at quarterback. College Football Network’s Max Dorsey predicts Cleveland could select highly in the 2026 NFL Draft, targeting Clemson’s Cade Klubnik, one of the top quarterback prospects.Klubnik impressed in 2024 with 36 touchdown passes, only six interceptions, and a dynamic running ability that makes him a dual-threat talent. His steady improvement in footwork and composure makes him a likely first-round pick and a potential franchise quarterback.If Gabriel and Sanders fail to meet expectations this season, the Browns might pivot to Klubnik next year, signaling another quarterback overhaul. This uncertainty underscores the Browns’ ongoing quarterback challenges and the high stakes of their 2025 roster decisions.Also Read: Bill Belichick’s alleged engagement to 24-year-old Jordon Hudson raises eyebrows after ring photo surfaces For Browns fans, the next season will be critical.

Bill Belichick has always kept his private life out of the spotlight—until now. The NFL world is abuzz with speculation after the 72-year-old coaching legend’s much-younger girlfriend, Jordon Hudson, was photographed sporting what appears to be an engagement ring. The image, snapped at Raleigh-Durham International Airport and reported by TMZ Sports, has sparked a media frenzy, with fans and critics alike asking: Is Belichick really heading down the aisle?The speculation didn’t start overnight. The same dazzling ring was first noticed back in April during the couple’s appearance at a high-profile luncheon in New York City. At the time, it raised eyebrows but now, with multiple sightings and fresh details emerging, the engagement rumors have reached a boiling point.Fueling the fire further is the curious case of Belichick’s famously named boat. Previously called “VIII Rings” in tribute to his eight Super Bowl victories, the vessel now reportedly bears a new title: “I + VIII Rings.” Many see the update as a not-so-subtle nod to a ninth ring, perhaps an engagement ring for Hudson.While the couple went public with their relationship in late 2024, they’ve mostly dodged media questions.That changed during an awkward CBS Sunday Morning interview, when reporter Tony Dokoupil asked how the two met. Before Belichick could answer, Hudson quickly cut him off, saying, “We’re not talking about this.” The tense moment quickly went viral, and public opinion hasn’t been quiet since.Some see the relationship as a private matter between two consenting adults. Others argue it’s a distraction from Belichick’s current role at the University of North Carolina, where questions are already swirling about his future. The nearly 50-year age gap has also sparked criticism, with many questioning the dynamics of the relationship.Also Read: Chiefs' Patrick Mahomes set for major comeback and possible contract extension in 2025 Still, amid the backlash and attention, neither Belichick nor Hudson has confirmed or denied the engagement. As rumors swirl and the ring continues to shine, one thing is clear: the legendary coach has entered unfamiliar territory—where the headlines aren’t about playbooks or championships, but love, legacy, and a whole lot of public curiosity.","Bill belichick and his girlfriend, jordon hudson, went public with their relationship in late 2024.
