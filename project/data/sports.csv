Milwaukee Bucks Injury Report vs Charlotte Hornets (November 12, 2025)

What to Expect Against the Hornets

Thetonight as they take on the Charlotte Hornets. Giannis is officially listed as questionable due to left knee patellar tendinopathy - a recurring issue that has required close monitoring by the Bucks’ medical staff throughout the season. While the condition isn’t considered severe, it continues to be a nagging concern for the two-time MVP, particularly as the team looks to manage his workload during the demanding early stretch of the season.The Milwaukee Bucks are exercising caution with Giannis, as his availability for tonight’s matchup will likely be determined after pregame warm-ups. His response to light drills and team activities will play a major role in whether he takes the court. The decision underscores Milwaukee’s focus on maintaining Giannis’ long-term health, given his central role in the franchise’s championship aspirations this season.Giannis Antetokounmpo has been on and off the injury report in recent weeks due to this lingering knee issue. Despite that, he has continued to deliver dominant performances when active, averaging over 33 points and 12 rebounds per game. The Bucks have strategically managed his minutes and training sessions to prevent aggravation, and the results have paid off - Giannis has looked explosive on offense while remaining a defensive anchor.The Milwaukee Bucks are currently battling for position near the top of the Eastern Conference standings, making Giannis’ availability critical. His presence on the floor dramatically shifts the team’s offensive rhythm and defensive stability, and any absence could expose Milwaukee’s depth concerns. With the team already dealing with multiple injuries, the pressure to keep Giannis healthy has never been greater.Milwaukee Bucks enters tonight’s contest with a few notable absences beyond Giannis Antetokounmpo. Kevin Porter Jr. remains out following right meniscus surgery, while Taurean Prince is sidelined with a neck strain. Additionally, Alex Antetokounmpo is unavailable as part of his G League two-way assignment. These absences have forced the Bucks to rely heavily on their core lineup and bench depth, increasing the load on players like Damian Lillard, Khris Middleton, and Brook Lopez to step up both offensively and defensively.Tonight’s game carries added weight as it marks the start of a two-game series with potential NBA Cup implications. The Bucks are expected to approach the matchup strategically, especially with Giannis’ status uncertain. If he suits up, expect him to play a leadership role, driving Milwaukee’s offense and setting the tone early against a Hornets team that has struggled with consistency and injuries of its own.However, if Giannis Antetokounmpo is ruled out, the Milwaukee Bucks will need to lean on their supporting cast to fill the void. Bettors and fans alike should monitor Milwaukee’s official injury report closer to tip-off, as any late updates on Giannis’ condition could significantly impact both the game’s outcome and betting lines.Also read: Is LaMelo Ball playing tonight vs the Milwaukee Bucks?

Coach’s Optimism and Recovery Outlook

Milwaukee Bucks vs Charlotte Hornets Game Outlook (November 12, 2025)

as they take on the Milwaukee Bucks on November 12, 2025. The Hornets’ star guard remains sidelined with a right ankle impingement, marking his fifth straight missed contest. His absence continues to impact Charlotte’s offensive rhythm and overall performance, as the team searches for stability early in the season.The injury has proven to be more troublesome than initially expected. Although Ball has been making progress in his recovery, the Hornets have not provided a definitive timeline for his return. The 24-year-old guard has struggled with ankle issues throughout his young career, and the team’s medical staff is taking a cautious approach to ensure he avoids another setback before rejoining the lineup.LaMelo Ball’s right ankle impingement first surfaced during the Hornets’ game on November 1. Since then, he has missed every matchup, with the team prioritizing long-term health over short-term results. The Hornets recently assigned Ball to their G League affiliate, the Greensboro Swarm, for a monitored ramp-up process. Reports indicate that he has been participating in limited practice sessions to rebuild strength and mobility, but he remains officially ruled out for the Bucks game tonight.Given his history of ankle sprains and fractures on both legs, Charlotte’s medical staff continues to take a measured approach to his rehabilitation.Charlotte Hornets’ season has taken a downturn in Ball’s absence. The team currently sits at 3-7, losing three consecutive games since the star guard went down. Offensively, the Hornets have lacked the playmaking and floor vision that Ball provides, which previously helped him average 23.3 points, 7.8 rebounds, and 9.8 assists per game this season. His ability to orchestrate the offense and elevate teammates has been sorely missed. To make matters worse, several other contributors - Brandon Miller, Josh Green, and Grant Williams - are also sidelined due to injuries, leaving the Hornets dangerously thin on both ends of the court.Head coach Charles Lee has remained optimistic about LaMelo Ball’s progress, emphasizing that the young guard is improving daily in movement and strength. Lee stated that the organization’s main focus is ensuring Ball’s complete recovery before returning to action. The recent assignment to the G League affiliate suggests that the Hornets are carefully preparing him for a gradual return to full-speed play. While there’s no set date for his comeback, Lee hinted that Ball could resume regular game activities once he clears all medical benchmarks.For tonight’s home matchup, the Hornets enter as underdogs against the Milwaukee Bucks. With LaMelo Ball out, Charlotte is expected to rely heavily on Collin Sexton, whose playmaking and assist numbers have notably increased when Ball isn’t on the court. Bettors looking at player props might find value in Sexton’s assist totals or scoring opportunities given his expanded role.Also read: Is Giannis Antetokounmpo’s playing tonight vs Charlotte Hornets? Latest uipdate on the Milwaukee Bucks star’s injury report (November 12, 2025) In summary, LaMelo Ball’s continued absence due to a right ankle impingement leaves the Hornets facing an uphill battle against the Bucks. While his recovery shows promising signs, Charlotte remains focused on a patient, long-term approach to ensure their franchise cornerstone returns fully healthy and ready to lead the team again.","Lamelo ball remains sidelined with a right ankle impingement.

Klay Thompson apologizes to Megan Thee Stallion after airport mishap





Megan Thee Stallion on her relationship with Klay Thompson





Klay Thompson might be known for his calm demeanor on the court, but off it, the Dallas Mavericks star recently showed his softer side. After arriving late to pick up his girlfriend, rapper Megan Thee Stallion , from the airport, Thompson went viral for his heartfelt apology and his remorse. The clip, shared by Megan on social media, captured the NBA star trying to make amends with flowers in hand and genuine regret on his face.The moment quickly became a talking point among fans, who couldn’t get enough of the couple’s chemistry and Thompson’s down-to-earth approach. It also comes at a time when both are thriving in their respective careers, with Thompson beginning his new season in Dallas and Megan releasing new music inspired by their relationship.In the video posted online, Klay Thompson can be seen handing Megan a bouquet while apologizing repeatedly for showing up late. “Roses for my boo,” he said while driving her home. “I’m sorry I was late, babe. Damn it. I’m sorry. I thought I timed it well. Ah, just sorry. There’s no excuse.”Fans immediately flooded social media with amused and affectionate reactions, praising Thompson’s gesture as “adorably human.” The incident added another viral moment to their growing list of public appearances since confirming their romance earlier this year.Over the summer, the couple enjoyed a fishing trip that gave fans a glimpse into their playful dynamic. “So today, Klay is taking me on another adventure and we’re going fishing,” Megan said at the time. Thompson responded lovingly: “I got my queen on board, of course I feel cool. I’m the coolest guy in this harbor!”For Megan, whose real name is Megan Jovon Ruth Pete, the relationship marks a new chapter. “This is my first relationship where I’ve ever been with somebody who’s genuinely a nice person, and he makes me genuinely happy,” she told Page Six.“I just never dated somebody like him before and I’m just grateful that he’s here by my side and he feels the same way about me.”Despite occasional public skepticism — even from personalities like Shaquille O’Neal, who jokingly doubted their relationship on The Big Podcast — fans have embraced the pair’s authenticity. O’Neal later called Megan “athletic, so beautiful, and so gorgeous,” insisting his remarks were lighthearted.For now, Thompson and Megan seem unfazed by outside opinions. Their recent viral moment only serves to extend a genuine connection between two stars from different worlds. The duo has been very active on social media to share their personal moments of joy and love. Megan has over 32.7 million followers on Instagram, while Thomson has 16.8 million fans on the platform.Stallion is fully embracing her lover girl era — and fans are loving it. The three-time Grammy winner took to Instagram to tease a behind-the-scenes look at her new single “Lover Girl,” a song she openly admits is inspired by her boyfriend, NBA star Klay Thompson.“This is my song about Klay,” Megan said in the clip with a shy smile. “First n**** in life that has ever gotten a song outta me.” Fans quickly flooded the comments, cheering for the rapper’s happiness and her growing romance with the four-time NBA champion.Listeners have already picked up on the deeper meaning behind “Lover Girl.” In the track, Megan raps about finding someone who truly matches her energy and confidence. “Ayy, your n**** fantasy, my man reality,” she spits, celebrating a relationship built on mutual respect and balance.The lyrics hint at a future together too, with lines about “making big moves” which is a nod to the couple’s rumored move-in together. Fans praised how Thompson’s love seems to have brought out a softer, more radiant side of Megan. Speaking with Jennifer Hudson earlier this week, Megan opened up about how this chapter of her life feels different.“I’m in such a feminine era,” she said. “I’ve been through so much, and I feel like I was always on defense. But now I’m calm, relaxed, and more accepting of love.”Also Read: NBA’s highly anticipated Europe-based league’s potential release date revealed","Klay thompson arrived late to pick up his girlfriend, rapper megan thee stallion, from the airport.

More coverage on the NFL -

The Houston Texans’ star player, C.J. Stroud, has been dealing with a brutal concussion as his absence has sparked some concern among fans.The Houston Texans have won four out of the nine matches played so far in the new season as fans await C.J. Stroud’s return to the field. Amid all the speculations, there has been an update on C.J. Stroud’s health as he continues to be away from the field after facing a concussion.A few hours ago, KPRC 2’s Aarion Wilson’s report has indicated that the Houston Texans’ star player, C.J. Stroud, is still pretty unwell.The report reads as, “Texans quarterback C.J. Stroud is still dealing with symptoms and remains under the NFL concussion protocol, preventing him from returning to practice…”The report added, “Stroud’s status under the protocol is expected to sideline him for a second game in a row Sunday against the Tennessee Titans with backup Davis Mills prepping to start again, per league sources.”A few days ago, the Houston Texans’ head coach, DeMeco Ryans, spoke to reporters in a press conference as he opened up about the injured players of the team.The Houston Texans’ head coach, DeMeco Ryans, said, “For C.J., Tytus, and Jalen, all three guys are still in the concussion protocol…”DeMeco Ryans added, “We’ll see, you know, how they progress throughout the week.”C.J.

Stroud on the field, Mills opened up about it on 5th November as he said, “Obviously, I’m ready. That’s kind of how I prepare week in week out.

Paolo Banchero exits early as Orlando Magic rule him out with left groin strain



Orlando Magic face a crucial stretch amid uncertainty over Banchero’s status



Orlando Magic star forward Paolo Banchero exited Wednesday night’s nationally televised matchup against the New York Knicks after sustaining a left groin strain during the second quarter. The team officially ruled him out for the remainder of the contest shortly after halftime. It’s an untimely setback for the 23-year-old, who has been the Magic’s offensive anchor this season.Banchero left the floor with 6:40 remaining in the second quarter and was initially listed as questionable to return. Before exiting, he logged 12 minutes of play, contributing four points on 1-of-4 shooting, along with four rebounds, two assists, one steal, and one block. His absence was felt almost immediately as Orlando’s early momentum slowed against a surging Knicks squad.The Orlando Magic confirmed that Paolo Banchero would not return due to a left groin strain, leaving fans and teammates concerned about his availability for upcoming games. The timing couldn’t be worse, as Orlando has been trying to find consistency after a rocky start to the season. With Banchero sidelined, forwards Jonathan Isaac and Tristan da Silva are expected to be called upon to absorb additional minutes.Banchero’s injury history adds another layer of concern. Last season, the forward missed several games due to an oblique injury, and the team will be cautious in evaluating his current status. Head coach Jamahl Mosley is expected to provide a medical update ahead of Friday’s matchup against the Brooklyn Nets. For now, Orlando can only hope the injury is minor and doesn’t sideline their All-Star long-term.In his fourth season, Banchero has averaged 23.3 points, 9.1 rebounds, and 4.3 assists in 34.6 minutes per game, ranking among the top young forwards in the Eastern Conference. His on-court leadership has been central to Orlando’s identity, particularly as the team battles for a playoff spot.Losing Banchero for any extended period could disrupt the Magic’s chemistry and test their depth. For now, all eyes will be on how quickly he recovers and whether the Magic can stay competitive without their franchise cornerstone. As of now, Magic has five wins and 6 defeats, but the team is eyeing to get back in the race in the standings as early as possible.Also Read: Klay Thompson’s girlfriend Megan Thee Stallion gets positive court update as Tory Lanez’s appeal dismissed in shooting case","Orlando magic star forward paolo banchero exited wednesday night’s nationally televised matchup against the new york knicks after sustaining a left groin strain.

Are Connor Bedard and Macklin Celebrini ready to earn Doug Armstrong’s trust for the 2026 Olympics?

Do Bedard and Celebrini deserve spots on Team Canada's Olympic roster?

Two young NHL stars — Connor Bedard and Macklin Celebrini — are under the spotlight, as Team Canada is set to participate in the 2026 Winter Olympics in Italy. Both players have shown incredible maturity, and the debate has started about whether the next generation will finally get a chance at Canada’s Olympic roster. With the NHL players back on the Olympic ice, there is a fierce fight for the spots, and the outstanding play of Bedard and Celebrini is making the management reconsider its traditional veteran-heavy approach.In a chat with insider Pierre LeBrun, Team Canada GM Doug Armstrong recently detailed the problem of creating a roster that is loaded with elite talent. Armstrong confessed that the younger players are pushing their way into serious consideration. “There’s no age limit, at the high end or the low end,” he said. “I’m going to say some of the guys at the low end have really … they’ve found us. Connor Bedard has been playing some great hockey right now. He’s taken his game up to a level it wasn’t at last year.” His comments emphasize the extent to which the front office is starting to recognize and be influenced by this new wave of skill and energy.For decades, Team Canada has been relying on veteran players who have won Stanley Cups, Olympic gold, and have a lot of playoff experience.However, Bedard and Celebrini point to the same old formula. Both have proved that they can handle the pressure and also improve others around them, which is exactly the quality that could re-energize the team that has been mostly structured and reliable. The acceptance of the young stars would mean a daring move, that is, to the side of speed, creativity, and a fearless approach to international play.With the 2026 Olympics coming closer, Armstrong has the most fascinating roster dilemma in recent Canadian hockey history. Should the performance of Bedard and Celebrini remain the same, it may be impossible not to include them in the roster - their participation may even signify the birth of a new era for Team Canada.More coverage on NHL","Team canada is set to participate in the 2026 winter olympics in italy.

Gabriel Landeskog scores first goal in three years, boosts Colorado Avalanche offense



More coverage on NHL:

Gabriel Landeskog finally scored his first regular-season goal in over three years, leading the Colorado Avalanche to a 4-1 victory over the Anaheim Ducks at Ball Arena. The longtime Avalanche captain had faced frustration earlier this season with two goals wiped out by offsides challenges, but Tuesday night’s tally was undeniable. Landeskog’s goal not only lifted the team but also highlighted Colorado’s consistency and resilience this NHL season.The Avalanche have been unstoppable at home, showcasing an ability to capitalize on scoring chances and disrupt opponents’ momentum. By ending the Ducks’ seven-game run, Colorado added another statement win to their growing list of victories this season. Landeskog’s return to the scoresheet provides a morale boost for the team, reinforcing his role as a key leader and scorer for the Avalanche.Landeskog’s goal came 11:37 into the second period, following a chaotic sequence that began when Sam Malinski’s stick broke on the initial shot attempt. Valeri Nichushkin quickly gathered the puck and fired a rebound toward the net, which Landeskog calmly redirected past Ducks goalie Lukáš Dostál. The goal finally broke the captain’s long wait and energized both the team and fans at Ball Arena.Earlier this season, Colorado’s power play struggled, ranking among the lower half of the NHL. However, recent improvements have pushed the Avalanche into a three-way tie for 11th, converting 17.5% of their opportunities.Martin Nečas’ third-period goal against Anaheim was a product of this revitalized man-advantage strategy, helping Colorado maintain a comfortable lead and control over the game.This win marks the third time this season the Avalanche have halted an opponent’s extended winning streak, previously doing so against the New Jersey Devils and Tampa Bay Lightning. Colorado’s ability to stay composed under pressure, capitalize on rebounds, and maintain aggressive offensive positioning has made them one of the NHL’s toughest teams to beat.Gabriel Landeskog scored his first regular-season goal in over three years, giving the Colorado Avalanche a significant boost as they continue their strong NHL season. With key players hitting their stride and the team executing effectively at even strength and on the power play, Colorado is well-positioned to maintain momentum and remain a top contender this season.","Gabriel landeskog finally scored his first regular-season goal in over three years, leading the colorado avalanche to a 4-1 victory over the anaheim ducks at ball arena.

Rob Gronkowski might be retired from active play, but his quick wit and larger-than-life personality continue to make headlines. On November 12, the former New England Patriots tight end stole the spotlight during his one-day contract signing with the team, engaging in playful banter with Patriots owner Robert Kraft. The lighthearted exchange showcased Gronkowski’s charm and reminded everyone why he remains one of the NFL ’s most entertaining figures, even off the field.During the event, Kraft jokingly asked Gronkowski if he would be willing to sign a two-day contract, just enough to suit up for New England’s Thursday Night Football clash against the New York Jets on November 13. True to form, Gronkowski replied with humor and energy: “Let’s do it! What’s the signing bonus?” Kraft chuckled, saying, “Nothing’s changed,” creating a memorable moment that highlighted their longtime friendship and Gronkowski’s playful nature.Gronkowski played nine seasons with the Patriots from 2010 to 2018, establishing himself as one of the best tight ends in NFL history. He holds franchise records for career touchdown receptions (79), games with multiple touchdowns (16), and 100+ yard games by a tight end (26). After quarterback Tom Brady left for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2020, Gronkowski joined him, winning another Super Bowl before retiring for the second time in 2021.His unmatched combination of athleticism, leadership, and charisma cemented his place among the Patriots’ all-time greats and one of the NFL’s most memorable players.The one-day contract and humorous exchange with Kraft emphasized Gronkowski’s contributions on and off the field.

His legacy extends beyond statistics—his leadership, personality, and memorable moments with Robert Kraft have left a lasting impact on the organization and the NFL as a whole, keeping him relevant and celebrated years after his final game.","Former new england patriots tight end rob gronkowski retired from the nfl in 2018.

Jets star ruled out as knee sprain worsens, could miss a month

New York Jets offense faces critical setback as Garrett Wilson recovery timeline confirmed

Garrett Wilson’s injury update is bad news for the New York Jets. The star wide receiver will not play in Week 11 after re-aggravating his right knee during Sunday’s win over the Cleveland Browns. According to ESPN’s Rich Cimini, Wilson is expected to miss three to four weeks with a knee sprain.He already missed two games earlier this season because of a hyperextended knee. Now, after just one game back, Wilson is sidelined again. The only positive development is that he avoided surgery, which keeps his hopes of returning before the regular season ends alive.Garrett Wilson suffered the injury while diving for a catch in the second half against Cleveland. He limped off and did not return. Head coach Aaron Glenn confirmed the injury involved the same knee that kept Wilson out in October. When reporters pressed him for a recovery timeline, Glenn declined to comment, citing ongoing evaluations.By Monday afternoon, ESPN reported that Garrett Wilson had a right knee sprain and would be out for at least three to four weeks. The team listed him as “out” on the Week 11 injury report after he missed consecutive practices.The Jets face the New England Patriots on Thursday night, and Wilson’s absence leaves a major gap in the offense.Before getting hurt again, Wilson had 36 catches for 395 yards and four touchdowns through seven games. It was the first time in his career he went without a single reception, as he was held catchless against Cleveland.With Garrett Wilson injured, the Jets’ offense is facing a serious test. Veteran Josh Reynolds remains on injured reserve because of a hip injury, and Allen Lazard was a healthy scratch last week. If Lazard sits again, the Jets’ wide receiver group will rely on rookie Arian Smith, Adonai Mitchell, Tyler Johnson, and John Metchie III, who just made his debut after being traded from the Philadelphia Eagles.Quarterback Justin Fields managed only six completions for 54 yards against the Browns, with most of that yardage coming from a short pass to Breece Hall. The Jets finished with 169 total yards in the game despite pulling off their second straight win after starting the season 0-7.Garrett Wilson’s injury comes at the worst possible moment for New York. The Jets finally found momentum under first-year coach Aaron Glenn, and losing their top wideout could stall that progress. If Wilson’s recovery stays on schedule, he could return as early as Dec. 7 against the Miami Dolphins or Dec. 14 against the Jacksonville Jaguars.","Garrett wilson suffered the injury while diving for a catch in the second half against cleveland.

Stephan A. Smith’s fiery rant brings his feud with Michelle Beadle back to life

The long-running rivalry between Michelle Beadle and Stephen A. Smith has burst back into the spotlight after Beadle ripped into Smith’s new partnership with gaming firm Papaya — a deal clouded by a lawsuit — triggering his heated on-air response and reigniting one of sports media’s most bitter feuds. The outspoken former ESPN host called out Smith for teaming up with Papaya, a mobile gaming company accused in a federal lawsuit of using bots to deceive players in paid competitions.On her Beadle and Decker podcast, Beadle didn’t hold back, saying, “It’s not secret how I feel about that human. I’m not a religious person, but I pray for the downfall. I really do.” She went on to call the partnership “gross” and questioned Smith’s ethics, arguing that it sends a terrible message to fans and the industry alike. The backlash intensified because the deal was announced just months after Smith was caught playing solitaire during the NBA Finals — the very event he was covering as a top analyst.Smith, known for his fiery personality and unmatched presence in sports broadcasting, fired back with a defiant monologue on Mad Dog Sports Radio. Without naming Beadle, his message was unmistakable. “I hear people talking about me on SiriusXM and who they would have preferred and who they would have wanted or whatever.I’ve been doing this for 30 years,” he said. “You got some people that were in this business and they talk smack now cause they can’t get a job in the business… they just didn’t know how to act. ” His response was a blend of confidence and frustration — the kind of tone that’s made him a polarizing figure in sports media.Beadle’s criticism went far beyond the Papaya deal. She accused Smith of being overpaid and underperforming, saying, “ESPN pays him a gazillion dollars to get a lot of stuff wrong and yell. He gets caught playing solitaire during the NBA freaking Finals.” Her comments reflected a deep disdain for what she views as Smith’s unchecked influence and the network’s willingness to overlook his behavior. Beadle framed the partnership as proof that principles often take a backseat to profit in today’s sports broadcasting landscape.The company at the center of the storm, Papaya, is facing a federal lawsuit alleging that it used “bots masquerading as human players” in online games where users competed for real money. Papaya has denied the claims and filed counterclaims, but the legal dispute has cast a shadow over Smith’s endorsement deal. Critics argue that aligning with a company under investigation could harm his credibility, especially as one of the most recognizable voices in sports.This latest clash adds another chapter to Beadle and Smith’s tense history. Their feud dates back to 2014, when Beadle called out Smith for implying that women sometimes “provoke” domestic violence during the Ray Rice scandal. Her blunt response — “I’ll never feel clean again” — became symbolic of her refusal to stay silent. Over the years, the two have traded barbs, but this latest exchange feels more personal than ever. With Beadle out of SiriusXM and Smith expanding his empire, their rivalry has evolved into a battle of principle versus power — and this time, the internet is watching every move.Also read: Stephen Nedoroscik spills rugby star Ilona Maher’s message for his special ‘Dancing with the Stars’ cameo","Stephan a. smith’s fiery rant brings his feud with michelle beadle back to life.
