Poll Do you think Vanessa Bryant handled the pregnancy rumors well? Yes, very cleverly No, she should have addressed them directly

Met Gala Surprise: Rihanna Stuns With Baby Bump Reveal, A$AP Rocky Confirms It’s Baby No 3

After days of unrelenting speculation, Vanessa Bryant took to Instagram Stories on Sunday, June 1, to put the rumors to rest. Her response wasn’t a press statement or a legal warning, it was a wild meme with a big middle finger to the internet trolls. The meme featured music icon Rihanna floating in water with a snorkel mask on her head, holding a drink, and flipping her middle finger.“Me protecting my peace, not pregnant & having fun all summer,” Vanessa Bryant wrote in the caption on her response to the online trolls who spread her pregnancy rumors about five years after her husband, Kobe Bryant ’s, untimely and devastating demise.It was clear, clever, and vintage Vanessa who shut down noise without saying a word about the origin of the gossip. No press release needed when you’ve got Rihanna energy with a direct middle finger gesture.The rumors had emerged out of nowhere, with some users pointing to photos allegedly showing a ""baby bump,"" though no timestamps or context were attached to those images. Vanessa hasn't been publicly linked to anyone romantically, and there’s been zero confirmation from her side—until now.In another Instagram Story later that evening, Vanessa shared a motivational quote that hinted at how she views the entire situation and what matters to her personally.“The only way to impress me, is by being a good person,” the quote read. “I don’t care what you have, what you wear, where you live, or what you drive. I just have deep respect for people with pure hearts and good intentions.”Adding one final touch to her trilogy of clapbacks, she posted another Rihanna meme, this one stating, “I’m not mean, I’m just not the one.”With the classic Rihanna memes, Vanessa showed that she is busy being a proud mom to her daughters while being the powerhouse of her business ventures. While she does not care about the rumor mill, her reaction explicitly showed that she is urging privacy.Vanessa Bryant, who shares four daughters with Kobe— Natalia, Bianka, Capri, and the late Gianna— has remained devoted to family and philanthropy. Most recently, she shared footage of a joyful family ski trip over the holidays, showing the tight-knit bond she maintains with her children.Natalia Bryant stepped into the fashion world just like her mother, officially joining IMG Models in 2021 at the age of 18. “Ever since I can remember, I wanted to model,” she shared in a statement posted by IMG on Instagram. “There is a lot to learn, but I feel this is a great opportunity for me to learn and express myself creatively.”Vanessa and Kobe Bryant tied the knot in April 2001. Tragically, in January 2020, Kobe and their 13-year-old daughter Gianna lost their lives in a helicopter crash that also killed seven others. They were headed to Kobe’s Mamba Sports Academy for a youth basketball game when the accident occurred. Kobe was 41 at the time. The loss shook the sports world and left a lasting impact on fans, friends, and loved ones across the globe. Kobe has left a huge legacy to his name as well, he is considered one the of the elite NBA superstars of all time with astounding stats, records and intense playmaking abilities. His demise created a huge void in the NBA world as fans are still mourning his untimely passing.Since their passing, she’s kept their memory alive through meaningful business ventures and charitable work. Kobe launched the Mamba Sports Foundation in 2016, aiming to support young athletes. After his death, Vanessa renamed it the Mamba & Mambacita Sports Foundation in honor of both Kobe and Gianna. Today, the foundation helps underserved boys and girls in sports, pushing forward the mission they believed in. It's her way of carrying on their legacy with purpose and heart.Vanessa Bryant’s response was indeed witty and empowering as she hinted that she deserves privacy and reminded the world that while she may be a public figure, her peace and dignity aren’t up for debate, especially not over unfounded gossip. After the viral response via memes, Vanessa has seemingly closed the chapter as she did not extend the matter any further with any other comments about it afterwards.Days after shutting down the pregnancy rumor, Vanessa Bryant made a glowing courtside appearance with her daughters at the New York Liberty vs. Chicago Sky game. The WNBA shared a sweet clip showing Vanessa alongside Natalia, 22, Bianka, 8, and Capri, 5, all smiling and waving for the camera.Later, Vanessa uploaded an image of her in a restaurant, candidly posing as she waited for the food to be arrive. Considering the dress, it appears that the photograph was shot after her recent attendance in the game.Their family moment quickly caught fans’ attention online, adding a warm highlight to the evening. It was a rare and heartwarming public outing for the Bryant family, showing their strong support for women’s basketball. It was Vanessa's first public outing since she debunked the horrendous pregnancy rumors.Recently, Vanessa honored her husband Kobe's memory with a heartfelt Instagram post on Instagram, sharing a throwback photograph of the family with the NBA legend, ""Happy Fathers Day @kobebryant 💕 You are so missed. We love you so much. #GirlDad 💕💕""Earlier this July, Vanessa Bryant added another heartfelt moment to her social media with a birthday post for her sister, Sophie. The sweet throwback photo featured Vanessa, her late husband Kobe Bryant, and Sophie together, smiling during happier times. It comes after several touching family updates, including daughter Natalia’s recent USC graduation and emotional tribute to her dad.As for her fortune, Vanessa's net worth has seen major growth over the years. While Kobe Bryant’s NBA success helped build their fortune, Vanessa carved her own path, too. She’s earned recognition as a model, businesswoman, and philanthropist, adding to her wealth through years of steady work.As of 2025, her estimated net worth is $600 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth. A large portion of that came from Kobe’s estate, after his tragic passing in 2020. At the time, Forbes valued the Lakers legend’s net worth at $600 million.Vanessa Bryant just shared a sweet throwback-inspired moment that melted hearts online. Her youngest daughter, Capri, recreated one of Kobe Bryant’s most iconic photos from 1999—wearing a cast and pajamas just like her dad did after a wrist injury. Vanessa captioned the photo, “Like father, like daughter. 💜 Capri Kobe Bryant 💜 #BabyMamba #KokoBean 💜💛🐍,” reminding fans how Kobe’s spirit lives on through their kids. From raising her children to keeping Kobe's memory alive, Vanessa has been an example of love and a remarkable parent. Also, there is no report of her seeing anyone as she remains loyal to her beloved husband Kobe, cherishing his legacy with their kids.Vanessa Bryant’s newest tribute arrives just months after she shared memories from a snowy holiday getaway with her daughters. Last December, she posted sweet moments on Instagram— showing the girls toasting marshmallows and skiing through the snow. Little Capri even shared a carousel ride with Vanessa, making the winter trip extra special.Additionally, Vanessa Bryant also grabs headlines for her friendship with several celebrities including Ciara, she often comments and likes the posts of her friends on social media. As of now, Vanessa is keeping a low profile about her personal life like always.Recently, Vanessa Bryant touched hearts with a heartfelt tribute to Kobe Bryant, joined by daughters Natalia, Bianka, and Capri during the Dodgers’ Bobblehead Night. She shared sweet photos from the emotional occasion, and her Instagram post celebrating Kobe Bryant’s legacy quickly drew an outpouring of love from fans.

Maple Leafs fans on edge as Auston Matthews’ health questions emerge before opener without Mitch Marner,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/maple-leafs-fans-on-edge-as-auston-matthews-health-questions-emerge-before-opener-without-mitch-marner/articleshow/123327949.cms,"Auston Matthews’ injury concerns create uncertainty for Maple Leafs entering season opener minus Mitch Marner (Getty Images)

Auston Matthews’ health in spotlight ahead of season opener



Why Auston Matthews’ form is crucial to the Leafs’ ambitions



With October 8 approaching, the Toronto Maple Leafs face a cloud of uncertainty surrounding their captain, Auston Matthews. The team’s offensive heartbeat is still under scrutiny as whispers about his health grow louder. A season opener against the Montreal Canadiens is no small stage, and Matthews’ readiness could very well determine whether Toronto begins with a statement or a stumble.Auston Matthews, who battled injuries and saw a noticeable dip in his goal-scoring last season, enters this year with more questions than answers. TSN’s Overdrive didn’t mince words when discussing the situation: “We don’t know what his health situation is. The idea he is going to be fully healthy is a big question mark. He’ll say it when he arrives but I’ll believe it when I see it.”Adding to the challenge is the absence of Mitch Marner, his long-time partner in offensive crime. Marner’s fingerprints were on half of Matthews’ regular-season goals and 60% of his playoff tallies last season — a partnership that has been instrumental in making Toronto’s top line one of the most feared in the NHL.Without Marner, the pressure on Matthews to generate his own scoring chances intensifies.If Matthews isn’t at full strength, Toronto may need to reshuffle quickly. Max Domi is the likely candidate to fill Marner’s spot on the wing, but banking on Domi as a top-line fixture through an entire season — and deep into the playoffs — is far from a sure bet. This uncertainty could push general manager Brad Treliving to explore the market for another top-six forward capable of providing both creativity and finishing touch.Last season told a mixed story. Auston Matthews suited up for 67 games, producing 78 points (33 goals, 45 assists). While impressive by most standards, it was a significant step back from his jaw-dropping 69-goal campaign the year prior. That drop-off, combined with lingering injury concerns, has fueled speculation about whether he can return to peak dominance.For Toronto, the stakes couldn’t be clearer: an in-form Auston Matthews is non-negotiable if the team hopes to contend. His health directly impacts the offense’s rhythm, the power play’s potency, and the confidence of the locker room. Meanwhile, Matthews carries a $13.25 million cap hit and holds a full no-movement clause (NMC), giving him complete control over any potential trade.Amidst all these health update, Sens captain Brady Tkachuk said some things good about Auston Matthews. “I’ve known Auston since I think I was 14 or 15,” Tkachuk said. “And he’s always been so good, and he’s just so funny and such a great guy to be around.” “It was pretty awesome for me to be able to learn from him as a captain, and what makes him himself,” Tkachuk added. “And of course, one of the best players in the NHL.""The countdown to October 8 is ticking fast. For the Maple Leafs, the question isn’t just whether Auston Matthews will be in the lineup — it’s whether he’ll be ready to lead from the first puck drop.Also Read: NHL Trade Rumors: Connor McDavid-style contract tension reportedly brewing for Winnipeg Jets","Auston matthews’ health in spotlight ahead of season opener with toronto maple leafs.

When an NFL investigation spilled into the living room and silence filled the gaps

The reluctant pivot to counseling and a competitive comeback that steadied the mood

A behind the scenes look at New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady

Nearly a decade later, the headlines feel like a time capsule: the NFL consumed by “Deflategate,” Tom Brady’s reputation under a microscope, and whispers that the strain had followed him home. In this throwback, we revisit how a football controversy turned into a relationship stress test for Tom Brady and Gisele Bündchen and the line the couple reportedly drew to steady the ship.The 2014 AFC Championship fallout wasn’t just about PSI charts and legal briefs; it was about fatigue, scrutiny, and isolation. As one source put it, “Things got so bad after Deflategate that they could barely speak to each other.” The quote captured a grim, mundane reality: two megastars reduced to quiet dinners and clipped exchanges, while an investigation stretched on and a four-game suspension loomed.The pressure cooker intensified familiar friction. Another insider described the tipping point: “Tom got irritable under the stress, and she started blaming him for all their unhappiness, much of which was there before the scandal. Counseling was her ultimatum.” It wasn’t a grand gesture so much as a practical lifeline, an acknowledgment that high-performance careers don’t immunize anyone from the slow-burn damage of stress.Therapy, according to reports at the time, forced the couple to separate tabloid noise from real grievances. It reframed the suspension saga as a finite chapter, not a permanent identity. And when Tom Brady returned to the field with the familiar, ruthless rhythm, stacking wins and restoring control—the emotional temperature at home reportedly cooled as well.The lesson, viewed in hindsight, is less about scandal and more about systems. The couple put structure around the chaos: professional help for communication, family time that wasn’t an afterthought, and an agreement to treat public storms like weather; loud, disruptive, but passing.Also Read: ‘Black man wanting white woman’: Tom Brady's ex-wife Gisele Bündchen and LeBron James Vogue cover slammed for racist imagery Celebrity marriages often look bulletproof until they don’t.

Shortly after the breakup, it came to light that Bundchen was seeing her former Jiu-Jitsu instructor Joaquim Valente.","The 2014 afc championship fallout wasn’t just about psi charts and legal briefs; it was about fatigue, scrutiny, and isolation.

Arjun Tendulkar, son of cricket icon Sachin Tendulkar, is all set to begin a new chapter in his personal life. The 25-year-old has reportedly got engaged to Sanniya Chandhok, 26, on August 13, 2025.The age gap between the couple, a little over a year, has already drawn attention because it mirrors Sachin Tendulkar’s own marriage.The Master Blaster tied the knot with Anjali in 1995, despite her being five years older.Sachin was born on April 24, 1973, while Anjali was born on November 10, 1967. Their relationship, and enduring bond, was once seen as unconventional but soon became one of Indian cricket’s most admired partnerships.Arjun, born on September 24, 1999, has been steadily carving out his career in cricket.A left-arm pacer and lower-order batter, he made his IPL debut for Mumbai Indians in 2023. While his career is still in its early stages, his personal life has already taken a decisive turn with his engagement.Sanniya Chandhok, born on June 23, 1998, is a year older than Arjun.Reports suggest the couple celebrated their engagement in a private ceremony attended by close friends and family.Interestingly, Arjun himself is younger than his sister Sara Tendulkar, who is two years older, making the age dynamic within the family a familiar one.Much like his father, Arjun seems unfazed by societal expectations around age gaps in relationships.The Tendulkar family, long admired for its grounded approach to fame, appears set to welcome a new member with warmth and celebration.As Arjun balances the demands of cricket and prepares for a new phase off the field, the parallel with Sachin’s own life journey is hard to miss.Once again, a Tendulkar son seems ready to walk in his father’s footsteps, this time, in love.","Arjun tendulkar has reportedly got engaged to sanniya chandhok.

Poll Who do you think had the upper hand in the rivalry between Irfan Pathan and Shahid Afridi? Irfan Pathan Shahid Afridi It was evenly matched Not sure

NEW DELHI: Former Pakistan leg-spinner Danish Kaneria has stirred fresh controversy by backing Irfan Pathan ’s explosive revelations about his long-standing rivalry with Shahid Afridi , calling out the former Pakistan captain for resorting to personal attacks.Pathan, who enjoyed considerable success against Pakistan — with 67 wickets and 807 runs in Indo-Pak clashes — dismissed Afridi 11 times across formats, including a golden duck in the 2007 T20 World Cup final. Speaking to Lallantop, the former India all-rounder recalled how the rivalry turned bitter after Afridi mocked his identity in an interview.“Afridi had said, ‘I am the real Pathan, he is a fake Pathan’. Badtameez aadmi hai. Mujhe laga ki aap sirf mere baare mein nahi bol rahe ho, mere walid ke baare mein bhi baat kar rahe,” Pathan revealed. “So whenever I had the ball in hand, I made sure I dismissed him. I have shown him 11 times who the real Pathan is — in big moments, in series deciders, and in the World Cup final.”Kaneria, Afridi’s former teammate, echoed Pathan’s claims in a scathing social media post. “Irfan @IrfanPathan bhai, you’re absolutely right.He always resorts to personal attacks — be it on someone’s family or their religion. Class and decency clearly aren’t his strengths,” Kaneria wrote while sharing the interview clip.Pathan also recalled off-field flashpoints, including a fiery mid-air spat during India’s 2006 tour of Pakistan. “Afridi came and placed his hand on my head, messing up my hair. He asked me, ‘How are you kid?’ I said, ‘Since when have you become my father?’… Later, I told him, ‘He has eaten dog meat, he has been barking for a long time.’ After that, he couldn’t reply.”For Pathan, Afridi’s taunts only served as fuel. “On the field, my performances were the perfect answer. I showed him who the real Pathan is.”Kaneria’s intervention has reignited an already fiery debate, bringing back to spotlight one of cricket’s most infamous rivalries.","Former pakistan leg-spinner danish kaneria has stirred fresh controversy by backing irfan pathan ’s explosive revelations about his long-standing rivalry with shahid afridi.

Clark’s Tough Rookie Campaign

Indiana Fever’s Backcourt Struggles Continue

How Caitlin's Injury has an Impact on the Team

Clark Speaks on Her Recovery

fans will once again be without their star rookie,, as she has been ruled out for tonight’s matchup against the Connecticut Sun. The team’s latest injury report on August 16 confirms Clark’s absence as she continues to deal with a nagging groin injury that has sidelined her since July 15. Caitlin Clark ’s right groin issue has now forced her to miss 12 straight games. The setback occurred in the final seconds of Indiana’s July 15 win over Connecticut, and the recovery process has been slower than expected. While she has recently returned to light workouts, including running full court at full body weight, she has not yet rejoined full team practices. Until that step is cleared, a return to competitive action remains on hold. Head coach Stephanie White has emphasized that Clark’s long-term health will take priority over rushing her back.Early projections suggested Caitlin Clark might be back by August 12, but that target has already passed. Current reports now point to August 26 against the Seattle Storm as a possible return date, though nothing is set in stone. The Indiana Fever’s medical staff continues to monitor her progress carefully, ensuring she meets all the required benchmarks before stepping back on the court.The injury has been the latest hurdle in what has been a frustrating season for Clark. Limited to just 13 appearances so far, she was averaging 16.5 points, 8.8 assists (second-best in the WNBA), and 5.0 rebounds before going down. Her playmaking ability transformed Indiana’s offense, and her absence has been felt on both ends of the floor.Adding to Indiana Fever ’s woes, the team is without two more guards: Aari McDonald, sidelined with a broken right foot, and Sydney Colson, out for the season with a torn ACL. In response, the Fever signed veteran Odyssey Sims on a hardship contract to fill out the roster. The thin backcourt has left the team scrambling for consistency as they battle to stay in playoff contention.• Record with Clark: 8-5• Record without Clark: 10-10• Clark still holds one of the league’s top assist averages, only behind Phoenix’s Alyssa Thomas.The difference in results highlights just how crucial she is to Indiana’s success.Opening up about the injury, Clark admitted the recovery process has been mentally and physically demanding. Speaking on a recent podcast, she said, “I’ve never really dealt with injury before. It’s probably been a challenge in itself because when I was first feeling pain, I didn’t understand it.”Caitlin Clark will not play against the Connecticut Sun on August 16, and her exact return date remains uncertain. The Indiana Fever continue to exercise patience as they prioritize her long-term future. For now, Indiana’s playoff push rests on the shoulders of a depleted backcourt, but all eyes remain on Clark’s eventual comeback—a moment that could change the trajectory of the season.","Caitlin clark has been sidelined with a groin injury since july 15.

Poll Which player from the Class of 2023 do you think will be missed the most in the 2025 squad? Rohit Sharma Virat Kohli Ravindra Jadeja

NEW DELHI: With the Indian selectors expected to unveil the squad for the Asia Cup 2025 on Tuesday, August 19, speculation is mounting over who will make the cut for the continental T20I event. India, placed in Group A alongside Pakistan, UAE, and Oman, will feature in the tournament scheduled in the UAE from September 9–28.This edition will be played in the T20I format, aligning with the T20 World Cup cycle next year. The last edition in 2023, however, was an ODI competition jointly hosted by Pakistan and Sri Lanka. That squad, led by Rohit Sharma, lifted the trophy, but much has changed in the two years since.From the Class of 2023, three stalwarts — Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, and Ravindra Jadeja — have retired from T20Is, drawing curtains on their illustrious careers in the shortest format. Their absence has created both a leadership vacuum and opportunities for the next generation.Several others who featured two years ago have drifted away from India's T20 set-up. Ishan Kishan, Prasidh Krishna, Mohammed Shami, and Shardul Thakur have not been part of the scheme in recent times, either due to form, fitness, or selection dynamics.That leaves a solid core of players still very much in contention for the Class of 2025. Suryakumar Yadav , now India's T20I captain, heads the list, with Hardik Pandya , Jasprit Bumrah, and Shubman Gill expected to play central roles. Shreyas Iyer, Axar Patel, KL Rahul, Mohammed Siraj, Washington Sundar, Tilak Varma, and Kuldeep Yadav also remain in the selectors' consideration.The key talking point, however, is how many of these 2023 squad members will survive the transition. The rise of youngsters like Yashasvi Jaiswal, Rinku Singh, and Jitesh Sharma has made competition stiffer, while experienced hands such as Pandya and Bumrah provide balance.As the BCCI gears up for the announcement, the focus will be on continuity versus fresh blood. For now, the question lingers: who from the Class of 2023 will carry forward India's challenge in the Class of 2025?","Rohit sharma, virat kohli, and ravindra jadeja have retired from t20is.

Magic Johnson hails Mookie Betts for his clutch performance



LA Dodgers reclaim division lead



The Los Angeles Dodgers regained control of the NL West on Sunday with a statement sweep over the San Diego Padres. It was capped by a clutch home run from Mookie Betts . The All-Star outfielder broke a late tie with a solo blast in the eighth inning, sealing a 5-4 victory at Dodger Stadium. Los Angeles Lakers icon Magic Johnson celebrated the moment on X as he called out Betts’ heroics and praised the Dodgers’ timely dominance.NBA Hall of Famer Magic Johnson has recently showered praise for Mookie Betts’ clutch performance. “Mookie Betts hit the game winning home run today as my @Dodgers swept the Padres and took a two-game lead in the Division. Freddie Freeman and Andy Pages added home runs in today’s 5-4 victory and Alex Vesia did great in relief!” Johnson wrote on X.The Dodgers had jumped out early, with Freeman crushing a three-run shot and Pages adding a solo homer in the first inning against Yu Darvish. That quick 4-0 cushion looked comfortable until San Diego chipped away. Fernando Tatis Jr., Ramón Laureano, and Ryan O’Hearn all drove in runs, and Jose Iglesias’ RBI groundout in the eighth tied the game.Later, Betts’ swing stole the show. After walking and flying out twice earlier, he turned on a fastball from Padres reliever Robert Suarez, launching it into the left-field seats.It was just his second home run in nine games. And certainly, a rare bright spot in a season where he’s struggled at the plate with a career-low .241 batting average.On the mound, Tyler Glasnow held San Diego to two runs over five innings before the Dodgers’ bullpen finished the job. Vesia, tasked with securing the final four outs, struck out Manny Machado to lock down the win.The 5-4 win capped a pivotal three-game sweep, following a 6-0 shutout Saturday and a tense 3-2 victory Friday. It was Los Angeles’ first sweep since early July and handed the Padres their first sweep loss since mid-May.Coming into the series, San Diego had surged ahead in the division with a five-game win streak and 14 wins in their last 17 contests. But Los Angeles turned the pages, outscoring the Padres 14-6 across the weekend. The sweep pushed the Dodgers to 71-53 and put them back atop the NL West, two games clear of their rivals.Also Read: Magic Johnson’s wife Cookie Johnson celebrates the Los Angeles Lakers legend’s 66th birthday at world famous chef’s restaurant Still, the race is far from finished.

What Comes Next for Warriors and Kuminga

The’ ongoing standoff with forwardcould reach its conclusion by February, with many expecting the NBA trade deadline to serve as the breaking point.The Golden State Warriors, once synonymous with championship dominance, have struggled to recapture their 2022 glory. Since hoisting the Larry O’Brien Trophy three years ago, Golden State has faced back-to-back second-round exits and endured a short-lived Chris Paul experiment that failed to produce a playoff berth.The franchise’s current predicament stems from its two-timeline approach following the 2019 Finals. Golden State opted to balance winning with development, drafting James Wiseman, Jonathan Kuminga , and Moses Moody. While Moody has carved out a respectable rotation role, Wiseman is considered one of the league’s most notable draft disappointments. Kuminga, meanwhile, has become the focal point of a tense contract dispute.According to Bleacher Report’s Grant Hughes, the Golden State Warriors are unlikely to resolve the situation during the offseason due to restrictive financial rules that limit sign-and-trade options. However, those restrictions no longer apply at the trade deadline.This makes February the most practical window for both Golden State and Kuminga to part ways.Reports suggest Kuminga’s relationship with head coach Steve Kerr is fractured beyond repair. This adds urgency for Golden State to move on, as keeping him longer may not improve his value on the trade market. The longer the standoff drags, the more it risks creating further locker room tension.Both parties agree that their partnership is nearing an end, but timing remains the obstacle. For the Golden State Warriors, maximizing trade value is crucial as they look to reshape their roster around aging stars Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, and Draymond Green. For Kuminga, securing a long-term home where he can develop into a franchise cornerstone is the priority.As Ivan White noted in his original report: “In any case, Golden State and Kuminga want to end their partnership, but neither side is willing to budge until the situation is right.”Also read: Lakers Rumors: Rui Hachimura Faces Uncertain Future in Los Angeles with $18 Million Contract Update The February trade deadline now looms as the moment when both sides may finally get what they want—a clean break.",Jonathan kuminga is a restricted free agent this summer.

Championship Blueprints Point to Defense

Examples from Past Champions:

What the Los Angeles Lakers Need From Austin Reaves

Theare coming off a strong 2024-25 campaign, winning 50 games and proving they have the talent, depth, and leadership to contend. Yet, despite the optimism, history suggests their championship hopes hinge on one critical issue: Austin Reaves’ defense.As Maxwell Ogden wrote, “If Austin Reaves can’t step up on defense, then history will prevent the Lakers from bringing him back.” That observation cuts to the heart of the matter, as the Los Angeles Lakers prepare for a future where Reaves is due for a major extension. Austin Reaves has evolved from an undrafted hopeful into one of the Lakers’ most reliable weapons. His 2024-25 numbers highlight his rise:Reaves joined elite company as one of just eight qualified players to average at least 20 points, 5 assists, and 2.5 three-pointers per game. The list includes Stephen Curry , James Harden, and Jayson Tatum - clear proof that his offensive production is not to be overlooked.Playing alongside stars like Anthony Davis, Luka Doncic, and LeBron James, Reaves still managed to carve out a high-usage role. But the Los Angeles Lakers ’ concerns go beyond what he can provide on offense.The last three NBA champions - the Thunder, Celtics, and Nuggets - proved one undeniable truth: winning teams rely on defensive stability at the shooting guard position.• 2025 Oklahoma City Thunder: Alex Caruso, Luguentz Dort, and Jalen Williams provided top-tier defense next to Shai Gilgeous-Alexander.• 2024 Boston Celtics: Jaylen Brown, Jrue Holiday, and Derrick White formed a defensive trio while Brown maintained high scoring numbers.• 2023 Denver Nuggets: Kentavious Caldwell-Pope and Christian Braun anchored the 2-spot defensively alongside Nikola Jokic and Jamal Murray, who himself improved on defense during the title run.These champions prove that even elite offensive teams need their guards to avoid being defensive liabilities. Reaves’ current struggles in this area make the Lakers’ decision more complicated.The Los Angeles Lakers don’t need Austin Reaves to become an All-Defensive player. What they do need is for him to eliminate his reputation as an easy target for isolation plays. At minimum, he must rise to the level Jamal Murray reached during Denver’s championship run: solid, dependable, and far from exploitable.If he can make that leap, Los Angeles will have little hesitation in locking him into a lucrative extension. But if his defense lags, the Lakers risk capping their championship ceiling, even with Luka Doncic and Anthony Davis leading the way.The Lakers are in a position to contend for years, but they can’t ignore recent history. The blueprint from the Thunder, Celtics, and Nuggets is clear - defense from the 2-spot matters as much as scoring.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Golden State Warriors Predicted to Send $45 Million Star to Chicago Bulls in Blockbuster 3-Team Deal Austin Reaves has already beaten the odds once in his career. Now, his ability to grow defensively will decide not only his contract future but also the Los Angeles Lakers’ shot at returning to championship glory.","Austin reaves has evolved from an undrafted hopeful into one of the lakers’ most reliable weapons.
