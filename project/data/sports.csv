Explained: Why Rohit Sharma retired from Test cricket

Poll Do you think Rohit Sharma should continue playing ODIs after his T20 retirement? No, it's time to retire. Yes, he should.

India's probable Test squad for England Tour

NEW DELHI: India‚Äôs white-ball captain Rohit Sharma has finally addressed questions surrounding his future in One Day Internationals (ODIs). In a candid conversation with senior journalist Vimal Kumar, Rohit made it clear that while he‚Äôs not done just yet, he‚Äôs very aware of when to walk away.The veteran opener emphasised his evolved approach to batting, saying, ""I used to play the way I used to, I took my time. Earlier, I would play 30 balls in the first 10 overs and be at just 10 runs. But if I play 20 balls now, why can't I score 30, 35, or even 40 runs? And on the days when I get going, hitting the accelerator, scoring 80 runs in the first 10 overs isn't bad at all. That's how I think now.""READ ALSO: 'Bekaar': Rohit Sharma makes shocking statement about naturally-gifted player ""I‚Äôve done it; I‚Äôve scored the runs I was meant to. Now, I want to play cricket in a different way. I‚Äôm not taking any of this for granted. Don‚Äôt assume that things will just keep going the same way, that I‚Äôll keep scoring 20 or 30 runs and just continue playing. The day I feel like I‚Äôm not able to do what I want to do on the field, I‚Äôll stop playing. That‚Äôs for sure. But right now, I know that what I‚Äôm doing is still helping the team,"" he added.READ ALSO: Rohit Sharma hits back at criticism: 'Defending myself is waste of time' Rohit has been a key pillar in India's ODI setup, with 11,168 runs in 273 matches at an impressive average of 48.76. Under his leadership, India clinched the T20 World Cup in 2024 and the Champions Trophy earlier this year, further cementing his legacy in white-ball cricket.While he called time on his T20 career after the Barbados final, the 37-year-old recently stepped away from Test cricket after an 11-year career, having played 67 Tests and scored 4,301 runs. His highest Test score, 212, came during a memorable series against South Africa in 2019.While he‚Äôs shut the door on red-ball cricket, just like his compatriot Virat Kohli, who hung his Test boots on Monday in an unexpected retirement call, both Kohli and Rohit remain committed to ODIs, for now. Perhaps the pair is keeping an eye on the upcoming 2027 ODI World Cup.Rohit‚Äôs message is clear: he‚Äôs still hungry, still driven, but when the moment comes to step aside, he‚Äôll do it on his own terms.","Rohit sharma has finally addressed questions surrounding his future in one day internationals.

What‚Äôs Next for Golden State?

Theface an uncertain future after a challenging playoff run. Stephen Curry is nearing the end of his of his illustrious career and so is Draymond Green. Even though they acquired Jimmy Butler earlier this year, their path to the Western Conference could look bleak given the injuries that these players succumb to. Could a blockbuster move for a Lakers superstar change their fortunes next season? Sports Illustrated‚Äôs Alex Kirschenbaum recently suggested that the Golden State Warriors might pursue Los Angeles Lakers forward LeBron James this offseason. James, a four-time NBA champion, could provide Golden State with much-needed frontcourt size and experience.Kirschenbaum noted: ""(LeBron) James has long been linked to Golden State, in part because his rivalry against Warriors stars Stephen Curry and Draymond Green (they've played each other in five playoff series, during which James has gone 2-3) eventually blossomed into a bromance.""However, age and injury concerns loom large. A potential lineup featuring James (39), Curry (37), Jimmy Butler (35), and Draymond Green (34) would raise questions about durability.According to Caleb Hightower of the Sporting News 1. Championship Pedigree: James brings unmatched playoff experience and leadership.2. Fit with Curry: Their contrasting skill sets could create an unstoppable offensive duo.3. Lakers‚Äô Struggles: With L.A. failing to advance past the first round, James may seek a new challenge.- Injury Risks: James, Curry, and Butler all dealt with significant injuries this postseason.- Contract Hurdles: James holds a $52.6 million player option, complicating any trade or signing.- Lakers‚Äô Plans: His commitment to playing alongside Luka Donƒçiƒá could keep him in Los Angeles.If the Warriors exit the playoffs early and seek a roster shakeup, James could emerge as a high-risk, high-reward target.

Auston Matthews‚Äô hockey dream wasn‚Äôt cheap and his mom took the weight

‚ÄúI used to work in the morning for Starbucks, in the afternoon the restaurant, i was very fortunate to have two jobs. And believe me, if they would have more hours, I would have more jobs.""





Before Auston Matthews was an NHL superstar, his biggest supporter was clocking into two jobs, trying to make ends meet. His mom, Ema Matthews , didn‚Äôt just believe in his dream, she bankrolled it, penny by penny, from behind a Starbucks counter. For families without deep pockets, hockey can be financially brutal. But Ema‚Äôs resilience turned obstacles into opportunity and her son into one of the league‚Äôs brightest stars. Her story is the heartwarming reminder that every great athlete often has a real-life superhero cheering from the sidelines.Ice time, gear, coaching, travel, youth hockey isn‚Äôt just a sport, it‚Äôs a financial beast. For the Matthews family, especially with Ema being originally from Hermosillo, Mexico, the culture and cost of the sport were both daunting. But she took on the challenge without hesitation, picking up multiple jobs including a gig at Starbucks to ensure Auston never missed a chance to grow on the ice.Ema shared in a past interview that the cost of hockey often reached up to $20,000 a year, a heavy ask for any middle-class family. To make it work, she didn‚Äôt just cut corners, she picked up shifts and poured lattes while helping Auston stay focused on the sport. She even deposited small amounts of money in his account so he could grab food with teammates like a regular teen.Ema‚Äôs story also breaks stereotypes. In a sport dominated by players from Canada and northern U.S. states, Auston‚Äôs rise as a player of Mexican heritage makes his success even more impactful. It's not just about talent, it‚Äôs about trailblazing, especially for kids of color or immigrant families who rarely see themselves represented in hockey.Auston Matthews is one of the Toronto Maple Leafs ‚Äô biggest stars and a face of the NHL. He‚Äôs not just known for his goal-scoring skills but also for his poise and work ethic, traits his mom likely helped instill. While fans celebrate his success on the ice, stories like Ema‚Äôs remind us of the sacrifices behind the scenes that made it possible.Ema Matthews‚Äô story shows what‚Äôs possible when love, grit, and hustle lead the way.Also read - ‚ÄúFrom baptism to strip club‚Äù: Pete Blackburn‚Äôs unhinged NHL comparison is going viral and fans totally get it","Auston matthews‚Äô hockey dream wasn‚Äôt cheap and his mom took the weight of it on her shoulders.

As the Toronto Maple Leafs prepare for a critical Game 5 in their second-round playoff clash against the Florida Panthers, attention has shifted to the troubling injury situation surrounding goaltender Anthony Stolarz . Sidelined since suffering an upper-body injury in Game 1, the 31-year-old netminder‚Äôs status remains uncertain‚Äîand now, an NHL analyst is sounding the alarm on the nature of his symptoms.Anthony Stolarz sustained the injury during Toronto‚Äôs 5-4 Game 1 victory on May 5, following what appeared to be two separate hits to the head: a blistering shot from Sam Reinhart and a forearm to the side of the head by Sam Bennett. While the team has not confirmed the exact cause, the visible effects raised immediate concern.Speaking on TSN‚Äôs ‚ÄúFirst Up,‚Äù NHL analyst Dave Feschuk highlighted the gravity of Stolarz‚Äôs condition. ‚ÄúThe problem is... vomiting on the bench after a head hit, or potentially two head hits... That‚Äôs not normal concussion symptoms ,‚Äù said Feschuk. ‚ÄúIt could mean it was a more serious thing that we don't know what it is.‚ÄùCiting conversations with concussion specialists, Feschuk emphasized that vomiting post-impact isn‚Äôt commonly associated with standard concussion cases.‚ÄúThese guys... were very concerned that the vomiting thing, you know, it could indicate something more serious than a concussion.

Stephen Curry will miss Game 5 against the Minnesota Timberwolves



The Golden State Warriors are on the verge of elimination, and they‚Äôll have to face the remaining high-stakes game without their biggest weapon. Stephen Curry has officially been ruled out of Game 5 against the Minnesota Timberwolves as he continues to recover from a Grade 1 hamstring strain suffered during the second quarter of Game 1. Warriors head coach Steve Kerr recently confirmed that Curry will miss Game 5 as he is not medically cleared.Stephen Curry‚Äôs absence was confirmed by Anthony Slater of The Athletic, who posted on X sharing the update, ""Steph Curry is out tomorrow for Game 5 in Minnesota. The Warriors officially face elimination without their star guard."" As the Minnesota Timberwolves lead the series 3-1 and the Warriors are playing on the road with a thin red line from elimination.Curry‚Äôs absence is especially painful considering the timing. Golden State took Game 1 despite Curry‚Äôs early exit, but has since dropped three straight games. The offense has sputtered without the two-time MVP, and while others like Jonathan Kuminga and Brandin Podziemski have shown their playmaking abilities on the court, replicating Curry‚Äôs presence and production has proven close to impossible.Speaking with 95.7, Warriors head coach shared, ‚ÄúJimmy was under the weather last night. He really was not feeling well and that definitely impacted him‚Ä¶ Everyone knows who Jimmy is. He's one of the great playoff performers and I expect him to have a big game tomorrow.""Curry addressed his condition ahead of Game 5, telling ESPN‚Äôs Marc Spears: ""Even if I wanted to be Superman, I couldn't."" The quote was in reference to teammate Draymond Green‚Äôs earlier comment where he emphasized the team wouldn‚Äôt try to ""Superman this thing."" Green added, ""If he‚Äôs in a place where he can play, I‚Äôm sure he will.""But the reality is, Curry is still not ready. According to NBA insider Shams Charania, Curry‚Äôs progress over the weekend was limited to jogging and some light jump shooting. ‚ÄúUntil you get to that point, there‚Äôs not like a safe way to bring him back from a hamstring injury,‚Äù Charania explained.While Curry has traveled with the team, head coach Kerr confirmed he won‚Äôt suit up for Wednesday‚Äôs do-or-die contest. However, if the Warriors manage to steal Game 5 on the road, there‚Äôs a silver lining. Due to the Golden State Valkyries‚Äô WNBA home opener, Game 6 would be pushed to Sunday, granting Curry three additional days of recovery.Also Read: Stephen Curry says ""Even if I wanted to be Superman, I couldn't"" as Golden State Warriors continue to struggle It‚Äôs a small window, but one the Warriors are desperate to pry open.

Mounting injury crisis threatens Tottenham Hotspur's European dream

Captain Son returns as Postecoglou faces tactical reshuffle

The bid of Tottenham Hotspur for European glory has received a massive blow after the creative midfielder Dejan Kulusevski went under the knife in a patella surgery days before their Europa League final clash with Manchester United. The Swedish international player picked up the injury while playing for Tottenham Hotspur against Crystal Palace in the Premier League last weekend when he came off the pitch after 19 minutes of play. The development comes as a major headache for manager Ange Postecoglou , who now has a huge decision to make going into the club‚Äôs biggest game in years.The 25-year-old Kulusevski has played a major role for Tottenham Hotspur this season, scoring 10 goals and setting up 11 goals in 50 games in all competitions. His absence is adding to Tottenham Hotspur‚Äôs woes, as they have already seen midfield playmakers James Maddison and Lucas Bergvall sidelined with knee and ankle troubles, respectively, for the rest of the campaign.Dejan Kulusevski had gotten injured in the recent Premier League match against Crystal Palace, according to the confirmation by Tottenham Hotspur. After consultation with a medical professional, the Swedish international has gone under the knife and will now start his rehabilitation process under the watchful eyes of the club‚Äôs medical staff.This is the second serious injury blow to Dejan Kulusevski this season, as he had missed seven matches earlier this year with a foot problem in March. Of special worry to the Tottenham Hotspur fans is the timing, as Kulusevski had just-recently found form, playing a key role during the game‚Äôs most crucial Europa League semi-finals against Eintracht Frankfurt and Bodo/Glimt that saw them qualify for the finals.The only bright spot for Tottenham Hotspur has been the return of captain Heung-Min Son from his own foot injury. The South Korean forward, who has not won any trophy with the North London club in ten trophy-less seasons, finds the final a way of completing his Tottenham Hotspur ‚Äúpuzzle‚Äù.Addressing an interview before the forthcoming final of the Europa League, Son Heung-min confessed that winning a major trophy has been the thing lacking in his career for the last decade. ‚ÄúIt feels like I‚Äôve been looking for that last missing piece for the last 10 years,‚Äù Son said. ‚ÄúThis time feels different. I really want to win it ‚Äî maybe more than anybody else.‚ÄùPostecoglou is likely to pair Rodrigo Bentancur, Yves Bissouma, and Pape Matar Sarr in the midfield against Manchester United, but Wilson Odobert is another alternative, even though he flopped when he replaced Kulusevski against Crystal Palace.The Tottenham Hotspur fans will get a chance to see their team try and win their first major trophy since the year 2008 when they face off against Manchester United on Wednesday, May 21, at San Mames Stadium, Bilbao.

The real story behind Jason Kelce‚Äôs 25-pound post-retirement weight drop



Jason Kelce‚Äôs transformation says about post-career identity



Shirtless Jason Kelce Shows Off Almost 30-Pound Weight Loss | E! News

Jason Kelce spent over a decade bulldozing defenders as a 295-pound juggernaut on the Philadelphia Eagles‚Äô offensive line. But now, in retirement, he's fighting a very different battle, one against the very body that made him a football legend. Since hanging up his cleats, Kelce has dropped 25 pounds and counting, and while fans are praising his leaner look, some are wondering: why do so many NFL players feel compelled to erase their on-field physiques as soon as they leave the league?Kelce‚Äôs weight loss journey has been anything but quiet. On his popular New Heights podcast, he joked about resembling an ‚Äúoverweight Oompa Loompa‚Äù during his playing days, citing his long-time love for burgers, donuts, and pizza. Now, just weeks after revealing he hit 283 pounds, the ex-Eagle told Us Weekly he‚Äôs shed even more, hovering around 270, thanks in part to a ‚Äúbody fat loss competition‚Äù with former teammate Beau Allen.Kelce isn't the only lineman shedding mass post-retirement. Across the league, a growing number of ex-NFL stars are rapidly transforming their bodies, often within months of stepping off the field. It‚Äôs a phenomenon raising questions: Is it about health, or is the league‚Äôs obsession with size forcing players to live in unsustainable bodies for the sake of performance and then abandon them for ‚Äúnormalcy‚Äù once their contracts end?Kelce himself acknowledged the odd aesthetic shift many linemen face. ‚ÄúThey lose too much weight and look like bobbleheads,‚Äù he told GQ. ‚ÄúTheir necks gets so small, but their heads stay the same size.‚Äù For now, Kelce says he‚Äôs targeting the 250‚Äì265 range, just enough to look ‚Äúbig and happy‚Äù without chasing six-pack abs or ditching every comfort food. But the message is murky. Fans cheer when athletes bulk up, and then again when they slim down.Also Read: Madden Biopic: Christian Bale and Nicolas Cage bring NFL legends Al Davis and John Madden to life Kelce‚Äôs transformation is inspiring, no doubt.

Max Scherzer's thumb injury continues to hamper recovery

Blue Jays explore alternatives amid Max Scherzer's absence

The Toronto Blue Jays‚Äô 2025 season has been dealt a major blow as the veteran right-hander Max Scherzer‚Äôs return has been delayed. Max Scherzer, a three-time Cy Young Award winner, has been out since he made his season debut on March 29 but could not pitch effectively with inflammation in his right thumb. Although there was hope for a quick return, Scherzer‚Äôs rehabilitation took longer than anticipated, and now he fears he might not play again this season.Scherzer‚Äôs thumb problems have been a lingering issue since spring training and have been impacting both his grip and overall arm health. He has described the thumb as ‚Äúabsolutely critical to your arm health‚Äù and said it was essential to correct the problem instead of attempting to pitch through it. Scherzer attempted to begin throwing again after getting a second cortisone injection in April, but still felt pain, especially after throwing around 50 pitches. His only outing this season was a three-inning start against the Baltimore Orioles in which he allowed two solo shots before leaving because of right lat soreness, a complication stemming from the thumb issue.The Blue Jays need pitching help with Scherzer hitting the 60-day injury list. They have considered internal candidates like Yariel Rodriguez, but are also looking outside the organization. The Blue Jays are rumored to be interested in picking up Mitch Keller of the Pittsburgh Pirates‚Äìa great pitcher who has put up numbers, as a replacement for Scherzer. Keller is pitching like a stud, and with his value at $77 million, it makes him a very nice trade candidate for Toronto if they want to stay competitive in the AL East.Max Scherzer‚Äôs rehabilitation will be progressed cautiously, and the earliest he can return is May 29. The Blue Jays hope he can help them later in the year, but his availability and readiness will determine that. In the meantime, Toronto‚Äôs front office has to make adjustments, bolstering its pitching staff to make way through the season without one of its top off-season additions.While Scherzer cannot be out there, he remains a leader in the clubhouse. The staff appreciates his leadership role and his ability to mentor the team's young pitchers, even in the run-up to the 18th inning of a game. Despite what he brought to the field, Max Scherzer‚Äôs impact off the field could yet prove pivotal as the Blue Jays fight to remain in playoff position.Also Read: Max Scherzer seen mocking umpire C.B.

Virat Kohli retires from Test cricket after 14 years

Poll What do you think is Virat Kohli's greatest achievement as a Test captain? Winning the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Australia Leading India to the top Test ranking Highest run scorer among captains Most Test matches won

Runs alongside captaincy armband

Virat Kohli's retirement announcement created quite the stir on Monday, even if it did feel like coming to some. Over the past few days, as TimesofIndia.com had reported, the right-hander had hinted at stepping away in Australia. Yet, he harboured hopes of leading in England with Rohit Sharma stepping down a couple of days ago. When that bid was turned down, with the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) opting for Shubman Gill, the writing was on the wall.""As I step away from this format, it‚Äôs not easy ‚Äî but it feels right. I‚Äôve given it everything I had, and it‚Äôs given me back so much more than I could‚Äôve hoped for,"" wrote 36-year-old Kohli on Instagram.""I‚Äôll always look back at my Test career with a smile. #269, signing off,"" he added.With Kohli retiring, India lost not just a mainstay at No. 4 spot - a position that had Sachin Tendulkar first and Kohli next for over three decades - but one of the batting forces.Sure, his powers were on the decline in the last couple of years, but his overall tally of 9,230 runs puts him in fourth place among India's highest Test scorers. The list is helmed by Sachin Tendulkar (15,921 runs), Rahul Dravid (13,265 runs) and Sunil Gavaskar (10,122 runs).Above and beyond the pure run-scoring, Kohli's leadership skills is another aspect that will be sorely missed. He might not have led the team since 2022, but his presence, animated gestures and pumped up energy could not be ignored. Even in what turned out to be his last Test in Sydney, Kohli led the lines with Rohit Sharma not in the playing XI and Jasprit Bumrah off the field due to injury.Kohli‚Äôs relentless and assertive leadership, propelled India to become the top-ranked Test team. When India won the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in 2018-19, Kohli became the first Asian captain to record a series win Down under. That was followed by a 2-1 series lead in England, which eventually finished 2-2 after a COVID-19 break.Beyond the passion and intensity, the statistics also reveal a story that aligns with what‚Äôs visible ‚Äî Kohli was undeniably the best Indian captain and stood out among his peers.As captain (2014-2022), Kohli racked up numbers that make him India's most successful Test captain. He led India in 68 matches, winning 40, losing 17 and drawing 11. Under him, India had a winning rate of 58.8% . Among Indian captains who led in at least 10 matches, that is the best number. Behind Kohli are Rohit Sharma (50%), MS Dhoni (45%), Sourav Ganguly (43%) and Rahul Dravid (32%).In terms of absolute numbers, India triumphed in 40 matches with Kohli wearing the captaincy armband. It was followed by Dhoni (27), Ganguly (21), Mohammad Azharuddin (14) and Rohit Sharma (12).Even at a global stage, Kohli's leadership numbers match up to the greats of the game. Of captains with at least 50 Test matches, only seven have a win percentage above 50%. Besides Kohli, this list features Graeme Smith, Ricky Ponting, Steve Waugh, Hansie Cronje, Michael Vaughan, Sir Viv Richards, and Mark Taylor.If you zoom in to his records, Kohli also led India to most matches won at home. He played a crucial role in India's unbeaten streak at home that ran from 2012 until 2024.Kohli-led India triumphed in 24 Tests of 31 played on home soil, only fewer than Smith's South Africa (30 wins in 53) and Ponting (29 wins in 39).Among Indians, MS Dhoni had won 21 home Tests ahead of Azharuddin (13) and Ganguly, Rohit (10).Another challenging aspect of a Test captain is to keep the flow of runs going. Even if they wear the captain's armband, the runs or wickets column cannot dry up. That is a hallmark of great players who become even greater leaders. And Kohli ticked both boxes during his captaincy reign.Despite the extra pressure, Kohli was the highest run scorer among the Indian Test captains. He scored 5864 runs as India Test captain, including 20 centuries and 18 fifties at an average of 54.80. His highest Test score - 254 against South Africa - came when he was the skipper.It is worth highlighting that 63% of Kohli's career Test runs came when he was captain of the Indian cricket team.Behind him in the list stand Dhoni (3454 runs), Sunil Gavaskar (3449 runs), Azharuddin (2856 runs) and Ganguly (2561). When looked at it from a batting average perspective, Kohli, once again, leads the charts followed by Tendulkar (51.35), Gavaskar (50.72), Dravid (44.51) and Azharuddin (43.93).Once again, when pitted against captains from all over the world, Kohli was right up there. The 36-year-old scored 20 centuries as Test captain, which is the second-most after Graeme Smith (28).He also scored seven double centuries - most among all captains. His 5864 Test runs as captain is the fourth-highest for any player, behind Smith (8659 runs), Border (6623) and Ponting (6542).Among Indian captains, Kohli scored the most runs on home soil. His 2907 runs from 31 matches, at an average of 67.60, is more than Gavaskar (2426), Dhoni (1863), MAK Pataudi (1481) and Azharuddin (1339).As Kohli walks off into the sunset, India will be poorer at No. 4, with the runs on the scorecard, the charged up attitude and the leadership, even if he had let go of the armband three years ago.","Virat kohli retires from test cricket after 14 years as a player and captain.
