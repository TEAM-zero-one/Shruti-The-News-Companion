Chiefs Andy Reid, Patrick Mahomes Trent McDuffie & Xavier Worthy Press Conference | JANUARY 14, 2025





Patrick Mahomes may have fallen just short of a historic Super Bowl three-peat at the end of the 2024 NFL season, but his life off the field has never looked brighter. As 2025 kicks into high gear, the Kansas City Chiefs quarterback is thriving in both his personal and professional life, celebrating the arrival of his third child and preparing for yet another demanding NFL season.The Mahomes family welcomed a new member on January 12—a baby girl named Golden Raye. She joins her siblings Sterling Sky, born in February 2021, and Patrick “Bronze” Lavon, born in November 2022. With the addition of Golden, the Mahomes household has grown to five, and the couple seems perfectly content with that number.Brittany Mahomes, Patrick’s wife and longtime partner since their high school days, shared her thoughts on growing their family during a candid chat on the WHOOP Podcast. “Nope. We're done, we're done for a while. Three,” she said with a smile. “I don't know, I mean I feel like you can never like say you're done, but I think three is all I need.”Patrick Mahomes echoed his wife’s words in a press conference shortly after Golden’s birth. “I'm good with three for right now,” he stated. “We'll see down the line, maybe. But my goal was always three. So, we've had three. And we'll stick there for a while and see if we need to come back and get another one later on.”The couple, who began dating in 2012 and married in a stunning Hawaiian ceremony in 2022, have navigated life’s biggest transitions together—from college sweethearts to NFL fame, and now parenthood. Their bond remains strong as they juggle high-profile careers and family responsibilities.As a three-time Super Bowl champion, Mahomes isn’t taking his foot off the gas. He’s already back in action, attending OTAs with the Chiefs ahead of his ninth season. The team is gearing up for a global showcase, with their season opener set in Brazil against the Los Angeles Chargers—marking an international milestone for both the franchise and the league.Away from the stadium lights, Mahomes also opened up about the support he receives from Brittany, especially in terms of inspiration. “I admire my wife Brittany's confidence,” he told People. “Whether it's in business, or supporting our family, she always leads with strength and purpose. That kind of confidence is powerful; it pushes me to be better every day.”With family fulfillment and football focus going hand-in-hand, Mahomes seems more driven than ever.

Fan reactions are mixed as Brittany Williams is brought into the spotlight again





NFL star Josh Allen is basking in post-wedding bliss after marrying actress Hailee Steinfeld , but not everyone is celebrating. While speaking to reporters following the Buffalo Bills’ minicamp this week, Allen finally broke his silence on his intimate Southern California wedding with the Pitch Perfect star, calling it the best decision of his life.

She makes everything easier. I don’t really focus on the other stuff; that was the most important decision I’ll make in my life, and I made the right one.”The couple tied the knot at the end of May, with Steinfeld recently posting a photo from the wedding to her Instagram newsletter page Beau Society, captioned, “We’re married!

As Dustin Johnson pursues another shot at U.S. Open glory, attention has shifted to his wife, Paulina Gretzky—not just for her support, but because of what she stands to inherit from her legendary father, the Great One, Wayne Gretzky. While Johnson has secured massive paydays from both the PGA Tour and LIV Golf, Paulina’s future is lined with generational wealth thanks to her father's illustrious career and lavish lifestyle.Wayne Gretzky, often referred to as “The Great One,” is more than just a hockey legend—he’s a financial powerhouse. With an estimated net worth of $250 million, Gretzky holds 61 NHL records and has turned his post-retirement years into a business empire. For Paulina, this means inheriting not only an enormous fortune but also a portfolio of jaw-dropping properties and luxury items.Among his holdings, Gretzky owns a lakefront estate in Idaho, multiple Florida homes, and a childhood residence in Brantford, Ontario. He even repurchased his famed ‘Gretzky Mansion’ in Thousand Oaks, California, only to flip it for a profit in 2021.But one of the most unique pieces in Wayne Gretzky's collection isn’t a home—it’s a custom, handcrafted 34-foot Steinway 340 HT powerboat.Commissioned in 2021, this bespoke mahogany boat—built by Couer Custom—is worth $900,000 and blends elegance with engineering. It can hit speeds of 50 mph but is designed for leisure. “I was relatively fast when I skated, but these days I drive my car slow,” Gretzky told Robb Report. “I'll take comfort over speed any day.”The boat features plush loungers, a main cockpit with cozy sofas, a stern sunpad, and even an electric bimini for added shade.

Kevin Durant was speculated to be dating former adult actress Lana Rhoades in 2021





Kevin Durant is single and dedicated to his game. It is what is evident from several interviews where he was prodded about his personal life. Durant is among those who want to keep their personal lives fairly private and want people to focus only on his game. However, his personal life was not always under wraps. Durant made it to the gossip columns when he got engaged to the player Monica Wright in 2013.However, the engagement did not culminate in marriage, and the couple parted ways in 2014, almost a year later. Several rumors have swirled after that about the women Durant has dated; however, he has remained tight-lipped on the matter and didn’t add fuel to those.Recapping the media reports that talked about Durant’s dating history, here are the rumored relationships that the Phoenix Suns star had in his life.Kevin Durant’s personal life is almost incomplete without the mention of Monica Wright, a friend from his high school days who became his fiancée later. Monica Wright was also a player, just like Kevin, and both met at the 2006 McDonald’s All-American Game, where they were standout players from their respective teams.How Durant and Wright’s relationship bloomed is not known in public circles, but they grabbed headlines when they broke the news of their engagement.ESPN reported in 2013 that the Minnesota Lynx star shared the news with fans after a win over the Phoenix Mercury in a Sunday game.However, the engagement remained short-lived. The duo separated ways in 2014 after calling off the engagement. Later, Kevin commented about the relationship during an interview with GQ in 2015:“I had a fiancée, but… I really didn’t know how to, like, love her, you know what I’m saying? We just went our separate ways.”Wright cited the ‘differences of values’ as the reason for the break-up.After that, no stable relationship happened in Durant’s life. However, his personal life has always been under the scanner and drew fans’ attention whenever he was spotted with a woman on a public platform.The Sun reported in 2021 that after the breakup with Monica Wright, Kevin Durant dated Jasmine Shine, a model.Both kept their relationship extremely private; however, they were spotted at various NBA events together, fueling the rumors around their relationship.In 2021’s report, The Sun further mentioned that Kevin put an end to the relationship in 2016 to focus on the play-offs. He reportedly asked her to leave the house as the playoffs approached, marking the end of the relationship.A sports gossip reporter claimed Rosalyn Gold-Onwude to be the new woman in the Phoenix superstar’s life in 2017. Inquisitr, a publication, picked up the news from the gossip site and went on to declare them a new couple in the town.Rosalyn Gold-Onwude, however, firmly denied the speculations and said:“This year, there was a rumor I'm dating Kevin Durant. I'm not. I would not date any player on our team. It's better professionally… to not do that.”Both parties did not say anything on the matter, rubbishing the speculations as merely rumors.From 2018 to 2020, Durant was linked with Cassandra Anderson, a real estate agent; Crystal Renee, actress/singer; and Apryl Jones, reality TV star. The NBA star kept mum on his personal life and didn’t confirm any of the rumored relationships.The murmurs around the private life of Kevin Durant again spread in 2021. This time, a former adult actress, Lana Rhoades, reportedly said that an NBA star took her out for a date. Though she didn’t drop the name, the NBA player was highly speculated to be Durant.The actress, reportedly, dropped further hints by saying that the NBA star was a Libra. Coincidentally, Durant was the only Libra in the Brooklyn Nets roster at that time. However, no official announcements from either party were made, leaving the claims to be mere speculations.After 2021, the sports gossip reporters linked Durant to Brittney Elena, too.

How Wiggins Fits With LeBron and Doncic





Theare weighing their options this offseason, and according to a popular NBA analyst, one potential move involves swapping a key forward for a proven NBA champion.The Los Angeles Lakers have two clear paths in free agency: pursuing a dominant center or trading for an experienced wing player to bolster their championship aspirations. According to recent reports, the franchise may lean toward the latter by targeting Miami Heat star Andrew Wiggins.Lake Show Life’s Svyatoslav Rovenchuk suggests the Lakers could package forward Rui Hachimura in a deal to acquire Wiggins from the Miami Heat.""The fit of Rui Hachimura alongside (Luka) Doncic and (LeBron) James has quickly come under scrutiny after a premature first-round exit to the Minnesota Timberwolves,"" Rovenchuk wrote. ""This has led many to believe the Lakers are better off trading the starting forward."" (H/t: Sporting News)Andrew Wiggins could provide the Los Angeles Lakers with much-needed perimeter scoring and defensive versatility. Here’s why this trade could work:- Salary Match: Hachimura ($17 million) plus another expiring contract could match Wiggins’ $28.2 million salary for 2025-26.- Proven Playoff Performer: Wiggins was instrumental in Golden State’s 2022 title run, averaging 17.2 points and 4.5 rebounds per game.- Immediate Upgrade: While Hachimura is solid, Wiggins offers better two-way impact and championship experience.Once considered an underachieving talent in Minnesota, Wiggins revitalized his career with the Golden State Warriors . His improved motor and efficiency made him a key piece in Golden State’s success.However, after a slow start in 2024-25, the Warriors traded him to Miami in the Jimmy Butler deal.Wiggins’ skill set complements the Lakers’ star duo:- Reliable three-point shooting for better floor spacing.- Strong perimeter defense to ease the load on LeBron James.- Playoff-tested mentality, crucial for deep postseason runs.With the Heat struggling, Wiggins may welcome a move to a contender like the Lakers.While Hachimura has been a steady presence, Wiggins represents a clear upgrade for a Los Angeles Lakers team in win-now mode. If Los Angeles can structure the right deal, adding the former Warriors champion could be the move that pushes them back into title contention.","The los angeles lakers have two clear paths in free agency: pursuing a dominant center or trading for an experienced wing player.

Justin Martinez's injury timeline and impact on the Diamondbacks' bullpen

What Justin Martinez's long-term absence means for Arizona’s 2025 outlook





Arizona Diamondbacks pitcher Justin Martinez has been ruled out for the rest of the 2025 season with a sprained right ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) in his throwing elbow. Manager Torey Lovullo announced on MLB Network Radio that the injury is serious and that Martinez is likely to be out for a full 12 to 13 months.The UCL sprain was originally discovered after he felt tightness in his elbow while pitching the ninth inning on June 9; he immediately called for the training staff and received an MRI the following day. Not every UCL sprain needs Tommy John surgery, but the 12- to 13-month timetable for recovery is an obvious red flag. The club will assess the state of the ligament and decide the best course of action from there, though, as Martinez will be getting a second medical opinion.The void leaves an already maimed Arizona bullpen with another hole to patch up. Closer Kendall Graveman was placed on the 15-day IL with a hip impingement, and fellow reliever A.J. Puk had started the season on the 60-day IL with a flexor strain. As injury-plagued starters, Corbin Burnes and Jordan Montgomery both ended up needing Tommy John surgeries. In their place, Arizona has brought up Kevin Ginkel and Bryce Jarvis from Triple-A Reno and added right-hander Tayler Scott to the 40-man roster.Optioned RHP Jeff Brigham to Reno; transferred RHP Cristian Mena to 60-day ILAlthough this was a disappointing roadblock, it could be a blessing in disguise. Martinez's deal comes with a club option for 2032, worth only $3 million, which is usually automatically picked up if a player would need surgery or would remain on the injured list for a certain amount of time. That would give the Diamondbacks some breathing room financially if he has to go under the knife.Also Read: Justin Martinez secures five year 18 million contract with Diamondbacks Martinez had an impressive season last year from a performance standpoint, providing 72⅔ innings of 2.48 ERA ball, with nearly a 30 percent strikeout rate and a 58.9 percent groundball rate. His extension was a show of faith from the team that his long-term upside would pay off. The absence of Martinez will stretch the bullpen depth for Arizona, but the club hopes he leads a full recovery and returns to being one of the most important late-inning weapons for 2026.",Arizona diamondbacks pitcher justin martinez has been ruled out for the rest of the 2025 season with a sprained right ulnar collateral ligament (ucl) in his throwing elbow.

She’s not just cheering—she’s a bit of a good luck charm. The Pacers are 8-0 when Clark is in attendance, a streak that dates back to last year’s playoffs.Speaking to “ESPN” earlier this week, Clark opened up about her connection with Tyrese Haliburton and their shared desire to stay in Indiana for the long haul. “Ty and I would both tell you this is where we both hope to stay the rest of our careers,” she said. “People are like, ‘It’s a small market.’ But no, that’s what makes it fun. These people, this is what means the world to them.”She went on to describe the electric atmosphere in Indianapolis as the Pacers return to the NBA Finals stage for the first time in 25 years.“We haven’t hosted a Finals game in 25 years, and I’ve never seen this type of excitement. People are lining up three hours before the game. I literally just got the chills thinking about it,” Clark added.Clark made these comments during an interview with “ESPN” earlier this week, referring to both her and Haliburton’s hopes for the future in Indiana.The synergy between the two franchises is clear, with Clark noting how the city’s passion extends to both teams. “And they’re the same for the Fever,” she said. “I think it’s just like [Pacers coach] Rick [Carlisle] said, ‘In 49 other states it’s basketball, but here it’s just really different.’ I’m really fortunate to be able to play here, and he’s the same.”Also Read: Tyrese Haliburton and Caitlin Clark's friendship is winning hearts during the NBA finals As Clark returns to practice after a two-week absence, the Fever sit at 4-5 in the standings, holding third place in the Eastern Conference.

But with Indiana united behind its stars—on both the WNBA and NBA stages—the basketball spotlight doesn’t seem to be fading anytime soon.","Caitlin clark and tyrese haliburton have become emblematic of a new era in indiana hoops.

“F**k that” — Draymond Green tells Oklahoma City Thunder’s Shai Gilgeous-Alexander to block out NBA Finals noise,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/fk-that-draymond-green-tells-oklahoma-city-thunders-shai-gilgeous-alexander-to-block-out-nba-finals-noise/articleshow/121838012.cms,"(Image Source - Getty Images)

Draymond Green insists MVP-level aggression is what will define the Finals

Draymond & Metta tell Shai Gilgeous-Alexander: “SHOOT 35 TIMES” in Thunder-Pacers NBA Finals





When the heat is on during the biggest moments, some players freeze up. But not Draymond Green. After Game 3, where the Indiana Pacers unexpectedly led 2–1, the four-time NBA champ had a straightforward message for Thunder MVP Shai Gilgeous‑Alexander — “F**k that. Shoot it 35 times.” Green's message? Don't pay attention to the critics analyzing his shot count or foul calls – this is the time to step up, take charge, and guide Oklahoma City back into the series.After losing 116-107 in Game 3 and finding themselves behind 2-1 in the series against the Pacers, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander had a rough outing, scoring merely 24 points and attempting just three shots in the fourth quarter, making only one. Green shared a candid take on his podcast with Baron Davis and Metta World Peace. — ""When I watched that game tonight, I never felt like Shai said, 'I’m taking over this game. I’mma win this game. '”.The experienced power forward emphasized that SGA shouldn't allow media talk about ""shooting too much"" or ""foul-baiting"" to influence his game plan. “Don’t fall into the trap of what the world is saying… F**k that. Yeah, shoot it 35 times.You gotta go for it!” Green shouted, pushing Shai to get back that confidence he had in his earlier games, especially the 34 points and 8 assists he scored in just 36 minutes during Game 2.In his postgame talk, Gilgeous-Alexander admitted the team had its issues, noting how Indiana's physical play and strong pick-and-roll game messed with OKC's rhythm. He only scored 3 points in the fourth quarter, despite coming in with a mindset to keep the game close. Still, Green was there to remind him of his MVP credentials—leading the league with 32.7 PPG in 2024–25, outpacing big names like Curry and Giannis, and highlighting why the Thunder need him to step up as a leader.The Thunder, coming off a franchise-best 68-win season and breaking their previous single-season record of 61 wins, are turning to their star once more. Shai has already scored 38 points in Game 1 and 34 in Game 2 of the Finals, establishing a Finals debut record of 72 points in his first two games. Now, with everything at stake, Green’s message is straightforward: take on the responsibility, prove the naysayers wrong, and unleash that MVP-level performance.As the series tilts towards the Pacers, the Thunder are counting on Shai Gilgeous-Alexander to get back to his bold and fearless style of play. Draymond Green’s no-nonsense advice to tune out the media, take your chances, and seize control resonates throughout Oklahoma City.Also Read: “Your Spit Should Taste Different” — Tyrese Haliburton jokes as he describes the intensity of playing in the NBA finals If SGA can lead with confidence and intensity, OKC still has a genuine chance at clinching their first Finals title.

Brock Lesnar’s daughter wins NCAA National Shot Put title 2025

WWE star Brock Lesnar, who has been away from the ring of professional wrestling, has made headlines not due to his wrestling status but for another special reason. He has been in the limelight now due to his daughter Mya Lesnar’s, athletic achievement after the Veteran WWE star’s daughter clinched the NCAA National Shot Put title at Colorado.Brock Lesnar has been away from the wrestling scene, as he made his last in-ring appearance at SummerSlam 2023. He was recently seen in a private wedding ceremony along with his wife Sable, where the duo looked completely unrecognizable. However, due to Mya’s achievement, Lesnar has again become the topic of discussion without making an in-ring appearance. Brock Lesnar ’s daughter, Mya Lesnar, has made his dad proud after she managed to set college sports history by winning the Division I women’s shot put national title at the 2025 NCAA Championships. Representing Colorado State, Mya stepped into the ring and wasted no time letting everyone know who was in charge. Her very first throw crossed the 60-foot mark, instantly putting pressure on the rest of the field.Mya clinched the title after a monstrous throw. Her best throw was 62 feet, 4 and a half inches. Her second-best throw was 61 feet, 11 inches, better than the first runner-up, Abria Smith, who threw 61 feet, 10 and a quarter inches.Reports suggest that she was the only woman over 19m all season and the only one over 19m tonight.It is to be mentioned that this achievement marked Colorado State's first outdoor national title since 2005. Mya’s championship moment instilled pride in her school, her team, and all those who have witnessed her ascent.Mya’s gold medal achievement is reminding fans of her father’s college glory days. Before Lesnar dominated WWE and UFC with his wrestling prowess, he clinched the NCAA Division I amateur wrestling championship and was a two-time Big Ten champion. He concluded his college career with a record of 106 wins and 5 losses.Mya, similar to her father, had a long journey to success. According to reports, before transferring to Colorado State, she began at Arizona State. However, after she won the weight throw at the 2023 Mountain West Indoor Championships, she has been on the rise and is walking into the shoes of his legendary father, Brock Lesnar.","Brock lesnar’s daughter, mya lesnar, has made his dad proud after she managed to set college sports history by winning the division i women's shot put national title at the 2025 ncaa championships.

Poll Will South Africa secure their first World Test Championship title against Australia? Yes No

Bold prediction! Astrologer Greenstone Lobo picks winner of Australia vs South Africa WTC Final 2025





South Africa moved closer to winning their first World Test Championship final against Australia at Lord's on Friday, reaching 213-2 in their second innings with Aiden Markram scoring an unbeaten century. The Proteas need just 69 more runs with eight wickets remaining to achieve what would be the second-highest successful run chase at Lord's.Markram finished the day on 102 not out, partnering with captain Temba Bavuma who scored 65 despite battling a hamstring injury. The pair built an unbroken 143-run partnership as South Africa pursued victory. The highest successful chase at Lord's remains 344, set by the West Indies in 1984. South Africa has not won an ICC title since the 1998 ICC Knockout.Australia's Mitchell Starc made significant contributions earlier in the day, scoring an unbeaten 58 in Australia's second innings total of 207. He then dismissed Ryan Rickelton for six and Wiaan Mulder for 27 as a fast bowler. Starc nearly claimed a third wicket when Bavuma edged the ball, but Smith dropped the catch at an advanced slip position and left the field with a finger injury.Batting conditions improved significantly at Lord's under sunny skies, with early moisture dissipating from the surface.Markram displayed aggressive intent from the start, scoring boundaries off Australian captain Pat Cummins through punches and pulls. Bavuma, despite his injury, contributed with elegant shots including a drive down the ground off Cummins.Australian spinner Nathan Lyon challenged both batsmen. Markram survived a close call when he missed a sharply turning off-break that also eluded wicketkeeper Alex Carey. Bavuma reached his fifty off 83 balls, despite being hampered by a hamstring injury. He had a lucky escape on 43 when his slog-sweep off Lyon fell just short of substitute fielder Sam Konstas at deep midwicket.Markram achieved his eighth Test century in 84 innings, reaching the milestone with his 11th boundary through midwicket off Josh Hazlewood. He had earlier moved to 97 with a straight drive off the same bowler.The day began with South Africa making early progress when Kagiso Rabada dismissed Nathan Lyon lbw, leaving Australia at 148-9. However, Starc, who had been dropped on 14 by Marco Jansen the previous day, formed a crucial 59-run last-wicket partnership with Hazlewood. Part-time spinner Markram eventually ended the Australian innings by dismissing Hazlewood. Rabada finished with impressive match figures of 9 wickets, including 4-59 in the second innings.The match situation leaves South Africa well-positioned to secure a historic victory, though they face the challenge of overcoming their history of struggling in major tournament finals against the defending World Test Championship holders Australia.","South africa reached 213-2 in their second innings on day three of the world test championship final against australia.

The mystery around Joe Burrow’s rumoured relationship with Olivia Ponton







Joe Burrow, one of the most popular and talented players in the league, has finally opened up about Trey Hendrickson’s situation with the Cincinnati Bengals. While Joe Burrow is known for always supporting his teammates, it seems like his take on Trey Hendrickson’s situation with the Cincinnati Bengals has raised some eyebrows among fans.Recently, Joe Burrow was spotted at the Cincinnati Bengals’ first day of minicamp but Trey Hendrickson remained missing from it.After the minicamp, Joe Burrow was asked about Trey Hendrickson’s situation and the star player said, ""Last year we had two (distractions) This year we have one. That's definitely less. You'd love to have none but, you know, that's life in the NFL. We're all supporting Trey, and would love for him to be back.""But Joe Burrow’s words have not gone down well with his fans. A fan wrote, “Mr. Excuses back at it again”, while another fan commented, “wow burrow can’t count to 2? or he just forget about that 1st round bust already?”A third fan wrote, “Kinda disappointed in Joe.. put the same emphasis on the front office to sign Trey as you did Tee and Jamarr. I expected more.. But that’s just me and this is business”.However, some fans have also supported Joe Burrow.A fan wrote, “I love Joe because he’s always trying to get his guys paid. This is the answer that gives Trey a bit more leverage.”Another fan wrote, “#Bengals front office, is putting Joe Burrow in such a tough spot, every year, for absolutely no reason… Trey deserves to be paid, he was there with the team, when others weren’t. He is a leader on that defense, as they continue to dismantle the D. Pay him 🙏🏽”While Trey Hendrickson’s contract dispute is yet to be solved, Joe Burrow’s personal life has also been in the news.A few weeks ago, at Coachella 2025, Joe Burrow was spotted getting out of a van that also had model Olivia Ponton sitting inside.
