Denver Nuggets' Streak Snapped: Four Los Angeles Lakers Players Score 20+ Points in 123-100 Romp



Remember when the Denver Nuggets looked invincible? Like a superhero on a nine-game winning streak, they were soaring higher than a Taylor Swift concert ticket price. But just like every superhero movie needs a good villain, the Los Angeles Lakers swooped into Denver and played the role of kryptonite. Think Thanos snapping his fingers, but instead of half the universe disappearing, it was the Nuggets' winning streak vanishing into thin air. The final score? A resounding 123-100 victory for the purple and gold. But this wasn't just a win, it was a statement. A declaration that the Lakers are not to be trifled with.Leading the charge were four Lakers, each scoring 20+ points, like a basketball version of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse descending upon the Nuggets' defense. Luka Doncic , channeling his inner Zeus, rained down 32 points. LeBron James , ever the king, added a regal 25. Rui Hachimura , in a dramatic turn of events, contributed 21 points, a feat made even more impressive considering a mid-game injury scare that had Laker Nation holding its breath. And let's not forget Austin Reaves , who also chipped in with 21 points, proving that even the underdogs can bite.But just like a phoenix rising from the ashes (or, you know, a basketball player returning from the locker room), Hachimura returned. Hachimura's return wasn't just symbolic, it was impactful. He finished the game with 21 points, four assists, and a steal, shooting 58.3 percent from the field. He was raining three-pointers like confetti at a New Year's Eve party.Furthermore, LeBron James added 25 points, nine rebounds, five assists, and three blocks, while the Lakers limited their turnovers to just eight, while the Nuggets committed 20. After the game, James shared a head-turning analogy about the growing chemistry between him and Doncic as they continue to grow as teammates together. (via NBA ""I'm a natural-born wide receiver, and he's a natural-born quarterback, so it fits perfectly,"" James said.ALSO READ: Why Is Elgin Baylor Being Celebrated Now?

Sam Bennett tied the game 2-2. In overtime, McDavid scored the game-winner, and Jordan Binnington made 31 saves for Canada.

Looks similar to the last game, the surface is on the slower side. We have an experienced unit in batting, so we know what we need to do if the pitches get slower. Need an overall performance from the team - with bat and ball. The last game wasn't an easy one for us, which is always nice. You want to be under pressure and test yourself. We are playing the same team,"" Rohit said.The last time India and Pakistan clashed in the Champions Trophy was during the 2017 edition's final, when Virat Kohli-led unit was humbled by the Men in Green.

EXCLUSIVE | Rohit Sharma way better than Virat Kohli and Babar Azam: Former Pakistan pacer

NEW DELHI: Indian all-rounder Hardik Pandya on Sunday reached a significant milestone, claiming his 200th international wicket across formats. He achieved this feat during India's crucial ICC Champions Trophy clash against Pakistan in Dubai.Known for his explosive batting and effective seam bowling, Hardik has been a vital asset for India across all formats. He was at his best during the match, delivering an impressive spell of 2/31 in eight overs at an economy rate of 3.87.He dismissed Pakistan’s star batter Babar Azam, who was in attacking form, and later removed a well-set Saud Shakeel , who had reached a half-century.In 216 international matches, Hardik has taken 200 wickets at an average of 30.76, with his best figures being 5/28 — his only five-wicket haul in international cricket. He currently ranks as the 24th-highest wicket-taker in Indian cricket history.In 11 Tests, he has taken 17 wickets at an average of 31.05, with a best of 5/28.

However, their dismissals triggered another collapse before a late cameo from Khushdil Shah (38) provided a much-needed boost on a sluggish pitch.Pakistan's innings wrapped up in 49.4 overs, with India's left-arm wrist spinner Kuldeep Yadav shining with figures of 3/40.","Hardik pandya claimed his 200th international wicket during india's champions trophy clash against pakistan in dubai.

Cooper Flagg's Performance Highlights Duke's Historic Win Over Illinois

A new era of Blue Devil dominance is upon us, and it's led by a player drawing comparisons to everyone from Jayson Tatum to a young LeBron. This past Saturday, at the Mecca of basketball, Madison Square Garden , Duke didn't just win, they put on a show that would make even the Globetrotters blush, dismantling the Illinois Fighting Illini 110-67 in a performance for the ages. Think of it as a basketball equivalent of a Kanye concert crashing a Lollapalooza headline setThe buzz surrounding Cooper Flagg, the projected No. 1 pick in the 2025 NBA Draft, was deafening heading into the Sentinel One Classic. And while Flagg delivered, showcasing his dazzling array of skills with 16 points, seven rebounds, and five assists, including a couple of dunks that nearly took the roof off the Garden, this Duke victory was far from a one-man show.Under the tutelage of Jon Scheyer , who is proving to be a worthy successor to Coach K, the Blue Devils unleashed a balanced attack that left Illinois reeling. Sion James , not known for his long-range prowess, channeled his inner Steph Curry , nailing two early three-pointers. Tyrese Proctor and Isaiah Evans sliced and diced through the Illini defense, combining for 20 points. Even future draft picks Kon Knueppel and Khaman Maluach contributed.Duke's defense was a suffocating force, holding Illinois to a dismal 2-for-26 from beyond the arc. This was a team that averaged nearly ten three-pointers a game, completely neutralized by Duke’s relentless pressure. Questions about Duke's strength of schedule in the ACC and earlier losses to Kentucky and Kansas were emphatically answered. This team has evolved. They've gelled. They've found their identity. They’re not just a collection of talented individuals, they're a team, playing with a purpose.ALSO READ: Four Los Angeles Lakers Starters Score 20+ Points to Defeat Denver Nuggets: Ended Nine-Game Win Streak If Saturday night was any indication, that purpose is to cut down the nets in San Antonio.

have seemingly bounced back as they have secured a stunning win against theon Thursday night. At 40 years old, on the second night of a back-to-back, the four-time NBA champion, LeBron James delivered a jaw-dropping 40-point performance to lead the Los Angeles Lakers to a 121-112 win over the Portland Trail Blazers. His efforts left Lakers head coachboth stunned and inspired, as he showered James with praise following the game. LeBron James has recently dealt with lingering injuries and only confirmed fit to play hours before tipoff but showed no signs of slowing down. He shot an efficient 14-for-24 from the field, including 4-of-8 from beyond the arc, and added eight rebounds and four assists.Head coach JJ Redick , who has always been a vocal admirer of James’ work ethic and longevity, couldn’t hold back his admiration for the legend. Speaking to reporters in a post-game presser, he shared his honest thoughts on the King’s astonishing performance.“He really just defies anything that's normal, and not just the physical feats and the plays—it’s the mentality,” Redick said. “He is—I believe I saw the other day he's a billionaire—and he's playing on the second night of a back-to-back at 40 after 22 years with every record and every accolade.”Redick continued his witty remark, “And the kids will say that I'm glazing him. He's one of the greatest competitors. [Assistant coach] Nate [McMillan] and I were talking before the game—he's amazing to coach. He brings it every single day, he sets the standard for how you're supposed to approach this craft. That’s to me the most incredible thing—the mindset to do it, get up the next day, do it, over and over again.”James’ ability to maintain this level of excellence post-40 has been undeniably top of the word, according to fan analysts. For two decades, he has maintained his stature as a standout star and forged his legacy with a stunning resume to his name.Additionally, James has just added another milestone in his career. By playing his 1,542nd game, he passed Vince Carter to claim third place on the NBA’s all-time games played list. Now, only Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (1,560) and Robert Parish (1,611) stand ahead of him. The 1 billion-rich athlete (per Forbes) is currently averaging 24.7 points per game, 7.7 rebounds, and 8.9 assists. James also holds the youngest and oldest NBA star to score 40 points in a game.Also Read: Los Angeles Lakers legend LeBron James creates another milestone surpassing Vince Carter A huge part of the Lakers’ success against Portland also came from Austin Reaves in the recent game against the Trail Blazers.

NEW DELHI: India and Pakistan are set to clash in a high-stakes ICC Champions Trophy encounter on Sunday, with both teams chasing different objectives. India, buoyed by their six-wicket win over Bangladesh, look to secure a semifinal berth, while Pakistan, reeling from a 60-run defeat to New Zealand, must win to remain in contention for the last-four spots.The two arch-rivals last met in a Champions Trophy match in 2017, when Pakistan triumphed in the summit clash. The tournament is making a comeback after eight years since the 2017 edition.Although diplomatic tensions have eased, muting the usual fervor, anticipation remains high for this Group A showdown at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium.India hold a clear advantage, having acclimatised to the conditions, while Pakistan arrive in Dubai straight after their loss to New Zealand in Karachi. With form and familiarity on their side, India head into Sunday’s clash with a psychological edge.The Champions Trophy clash between India and Pakistan at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium on February 23 is expected to proceed without any rain interruption, despite rainfall occurring in Dubai days before India's tournament opener.The forecast indicates partly cloudy conditions during afternoon hours, with temperatures ranging between 22 degrees Celsius at its lowest and reaching up to 32 degrees Celsius at its peak.31 DegreesMostly sunny and warm20 km/h5%32 DegreesMostly sunny and warm30 km/h23%26 DegreesPartly cloudy and warm24 km/h100%The playing surface at the Dubai International Stadium provides opportunities for both batting and bowling, with conditions that can fluctuate. During day/night contests, as the surface becomes drier, spin bowlers often find increased effectiveness. The initial phase favours pace bowling, with the potential for movement in the air and bounce off the surface. Whilst scoring opportunities exist, as evidenced by typical first innings totals, the venue does not consistently yield substantial scores.Spin bowling proves particularly crucial during the middle phase, as the surface tends to assist turn. Pace bowlers find value with the new ball, extracting movement and lift. In day/night fixtures, the presence of dew can be influential in the toss decision.Rohit Sharma (c), Shubman Gill (vc), Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer, KL Rahul (wk), Hardik Pandya, Axar Patel, Washington Sundar, Kuldeep Yadav, Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Shami, Arshdeep Singh, Harshit Rana, Rishabh Pant (wk), Ravindra Jadeja, Varun Chakaravarthy.Mohammad Rizwan (c, wk), Salman Ali Agha (vc), Babar Azam, Fakhar Zaman, Kamran Ghulam, Saud Shakeel, Tayyab Tahir, Faheem Ashraf, Khushdil Shah, Usman Khan, Abrar Ahmed, Haris Rauf, Mohammad Hasnain, Naseem Shah, Shaheen Shah Afridi.","India and pakistan face each other in a high-stakes icc champions trophy encounter on sunday.
