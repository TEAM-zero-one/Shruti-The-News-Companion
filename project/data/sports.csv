Mattias Ekholm ’s wife praises Oilers Nation with raw, emotional letter after crushing Stanley Cup loss



The Edmonton Oilers' dream of clinching the Stanley Cup came to a devastating end yet again, this time in Game 6 against the Florida Panthers. With a 5-1 loss sealing a 4-2 series defeat, the heartbreak ran deep — not just among players and fans, but also within the families who’ve stood by through every exhausting moment.Amid the emotional wreckage, one voice quietly stood out — not from the locker room, but from the sidelines. Ida Björnstad, wife of Oilers defenseman Mattias Ekholm and a respected Swedish sports journalist, took to Instagram to deliver a deeply moving message that resonated far beyond the final score.“As you might know, I’m a writer, and I love to put my thoughts into sentences and stories,” Ida began, in a post that felt more like a journal entry than a public statement. “Most of my texts stay with me. This time, though, I would like to share some words with you.”Her post was more than a show of support; it was a heartfelt window into the emotional toll a Stanley Cup run takes on not only players but also their families. Ida’s perspective came not as a reporter, but as a partner who’s been living the ups and downs of the season behind closed doors.“I know how much hockey means to the Canadian people, and I understand that the people in Edmonton are heartbroken today, including our family,” she wrote, capturing the collective disappointment that enveloped the city after the Oilers fell short again.She went on to highlight the intense mental and physical demands that playoff hockey imposes: “Throughout the playoffs, many things are happening behind the scenes. Boundaries are being pushed in the most demanding way, both physically and mentally. For the players and their families, everything is about maximizing the chances of winning.”Despite flashes of brilliance from Edmonton — including two hard-fought overtime wins — the Panthers controlled much of the series. Edmonton was behind for a record-setting 255 minutes and 49 seconds and was outscored 28-17 overall. Game 6 saw Florida dominate early, with the Oilers unable to find their rhythm again.Still, Ida chose to focus on the positives. “For two years in a row, we have made it to the Stanley Cup Finals. The Oilers are the second-best hockey team in the world, and we have fans who support this team in both good times and bad. There is so much to be proud of and thankful for.”And in her final thought, she reminded everyone of the bigger picture: “As much as it hurts when you lose, this is a journey we will look back on one day, reflecting on the highs and lows and understanding that everything made sense.”As the Oilers now prepare for a pivotal offseason, Ida’s message offers something rare — a sense of grace and perspective in the face of loss, reminding fans why they fell in love with this team in the first place.Also Read: Wayne Gretzky loved Panthers' Cup win over Oilers but also admits one part didn’t sit right","Edmonton oilers' dream of clinching the stanley cup came to a devastating end yet again.

Panthers' Stanley Cup celebration hits a sour note as Wayne Gretzky reveals one major complaint



The Florida Panthers sealed their second consecutive Stanley Cup in spectacular fashion, and Sam Reinhart’s unforgettable performance in Game 6 became the night’s defining moment. With four goals to his name, Reinhart powered the Panthers to a 5-1 win over the Edmonton Oilers and etched his name alongside hockey royalty.Reinhart's scoring spree not only clinched the Cup but also tied Wayne Gretzky’s iconic 1985 record of seven goals in a single Final series. But in typical Gretzky fashion, the hockey legend met the moment with charm and humor rather than disappointment.“My records this year are dropping like flies, Eddie O,” Gretzky quipped during the postgame broadcast to analyst Eddie Olczyk. His remark, filled with playful sarcasm, was met with a laugh as Olczyk assured him, “You still got another 40 or 50, Gretz. You’re OK.”While Gretzky’s record may have taken a hit, his admiration for Reinhart was clear. The Panthers’ forward accomplished this milestone while pushing through a Grade 2 MCL tear, an injury he sustained in the Eastern Conference Final. “I can’t really put into words what it means,” Reinhart reflected.“It’s something you never really think about... this one was even harder to overcome and be here at the end.”Two of Reinhart’s goals came on empty nets, but the impact of his performance was undeniable. It was a statement game, one that cemented Florida's dominance and placed Reinhart among the elite.The victory made Florida the first team since the Tampa Bay Lightning’s 2020–21 run to repeat as champions. But it was Reinhart’s tenacity and historical achievement that stood out.As confetti fell and Florida celebrated on home ice, hockey fans witnessed a rare bridging of eras—where a modern-day warrior matched the mark of a hockey legend, and that legend, with a wink, tipped his cap. The 2025 Stanley Cup Final didn’t just end with a trophy; it added a new chapter to the sport’s most storied history.Also Read: Wayne Gretzky’s daughter Paulina Gretzky’s workout fit has fans raising eyebrows",Florida panthers' sam reinhart scored four goals in 5-1 win over edmonton oilers.

Paulina Gretzky’s viral post for Wayne Gretzky fuels talk as Dustin Johnson battles golf struggles

Paulina Gretzky celebrates Wayne Gretzky with moving message

Golf fans are talking again. Dustin Johnson, a big name in the sport, is having a rough stretch. Missing important cuts has raised red flags. Meanwhile, his wife, Paulina Gretzky , honoured her father, hockey great Wayne Gretzky, in a heartfelt social post. This family moment shines, even as Dustin battles form and tough odds.Dustin Johnson, aged 40, was once a top golf star with major wins like the U.S. Open in 2016 and the Masters in 2020. But lately, he has not had the same edge on the LIV Golf tour. In the 2025 season, he missed the cut at both the Masters and PGA Championship. Reports say he shot 10-over in just 36 holes at Oakmont, a venue where he had previous success.These results have fans and analysts worried. Golf is a sport of form and confidence, two things that now seem in short supply for Dustin. His swing speed has dropped, and errors are up. Sources within LIV Golf suggest that he may change his training or work with a new coach. But no official plan has been shared yet.Paulina Gretzky, Dustin Johnson's wife and daughter of legendary hockey player Wayne Gretzky, uploaded an Instagram homage to her father on Father's Day, June 16, 2025.She showed a picture of the two of them and said how much she appreciates his guidance and support throughout the years.Also Read: Wayne Gretzky’s Daughter Paulina Gretzky Filmed In Awkward Moment At 2016 U.S. Open By Oakmont Cameraman Fans lauded the letter as ""genuine love"" and ""honest respect.” Paulina also disclosed a family narrative: Wayne first met Dustin at a pro‑am event in 2009. Wayne was the one who nudged Paulina to know Dustin. That recommendation led them to wed in 2022 and get married in 2013.Adding to their close family relationship, the pair has two boys. Wayne provided unity and support through his presence at events both on and off the golf course.Now as Dustin works to rebuild his game, many believe having Paulina and Wayne by his side could help him find his way again. With his game faltering, Dustin Johnson faces a crucial crossroads. Yet, with Paulina Gretzky and Wayne Gretzky’s steadfast support, fans remain hopeful he can reclaim his winning form and confidence.","Dustin johnson, a big name in the sport, is having a rough stretch.

Stephen A. Smith’s daughter Samantha Smith ’s confident cameo stuns ESPN crew



In a surprising twist during ESPN’s pregame coverage of Game 6 of the NBA Finals, it wasn’t Stephen A. Smith’s booming voice or passionate takes that stole the show like his usual style. This time, it was his 17-year-old daughter, Samantha who appeared on camera with her father. While the veteran broadcaster was on air from Gainbridge Fieldhouse, ready to dissect the Oklahoma City Thunder vs. Indiana Pacers showdown, viewers instead got a rare, lighthearted peek into Smith’s personal life as his daughter made an impromptu on-camera appearance that quickly became the highlight of the night.As Stephen A. Smith and Elle Duncan were warming up the broadcast on the court, Duncan playfully invited Samantha over, joking that it was “Bring your daughter to work day.” Smith, visibly uncomfortable but trying to roll with it, instructed her, “Say hi.” Samantha seized the moment without hesitation: “Hi guys, I’m Samantha.” When her dad pulled the mic away, she clapped back effortlessly, “I’m talking here.”It didn’t stop there.“I’m Stephen’s daughter. I’m so happy to be here, I’ve made so many friends. This is really…” she began, only for her father to interject, “You just got here five minutes ago.” Samantha didn’t blink. “This is a really great experience. This is a really great experience and I feel really grateful to be here, you guys,” she continued confidently, leaving the panel and viewers, and of course, his ESPN colleague in awe.Later, NBA Countdown host Malika Andrews brought Samantha back on-air for her game pick. Going against her father, she declared, “I’m going OKC. I think they’re just going to end it tonight. I think Shai [Gilgeous-Alexander] has been killing it all season and he won MVP for a reason. So I think we’re just going to finish it out now.”Smith, after having the candid father-daughter moment, looked both amused and defeated as his colleagues teased, “We much prefer her pick over yours.” He questioned, “You’re going against your daddy on live television?” to which Samantha shrugged and replied, “I think he knows I’m right.” Eventually, he admitted, “She usually beats me on predictions.”Also Read: ""He's miserable"": Fans slam Stephen A.

Ime Udoka’s rise in Houston Rockets just triggered one of the boldest moves this offseason,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/ime-udokas-rise-in-houston-rockets-just-triggered-one-of-the-boldest-moves-this-offseason/articleshow/121960473.cms,"(Image Source - Getty Images)

The linchpin behind Houston’s transformation in just two seasons

Ime Udoka has turned the Houston Rockets from an afterthought into a serious contender. After a dismal 22-win season, he pushed them to a 52–30 record and a No. 2 seed in the West. His gritty, defense-first mindset reshaped everything. Now, with an eight-figure extension and full backing from the front office, Udoka stands as the face of a rising powerhouse built for the long haul.When Ime Udoka came on board in April 2023, the Rockets were still recovering their head after a historic worst streak in the franchise history, where the last season recorded only 22 victories out of 82 matches. And under his leadership they were able to reverse it and complete 41-41 in the first year of his directing of the team, and then they really began to soar in 2024-25 achieving 52-30 and earning the number two slot. Udoka’s philosophy, rooted in his experience with Gregg Popovich, emphasized a defense-first approach. The result was a squad that ranked fifth in defensive efficiency and was recognized as one of the toughest teams to face in the league.Even though the financial specifics are kept secret, ESPN’s Shams Charania has confirmed that Udoka’s new deal is long-term, placing him among the NBA’s highest earners with a salary in the eight figures per season.The Houston front office didn’t waste any time, reportedly stopping the Knicks from interviewing Udoka during their coaching transition. This level of confidence shows just how important he is to the Rockets’ resurgence.Udoka’s extension isn’t just a single headline—it’s a crucial element of a wider rebuild. The Rockets have also secured veteran center Steven Adams with a three-year, $39 million deal, are looking to sort out Fred VanVleet’s $44.9 million team option, and continue to be involved in trade talks regarding Kevin Durant.

Many people backstage believe he could do well on RAW, especially now that WWE shows are streaming on Netflix. This move could help him become an even bigger star.Knight is one of the most popular superstars in WWE right now. He has become a fan favorite without needing a title to prove it.

But now, there is news that his time on the blue brand might be ending.According to WrestleVotes, several people inside WWE are pushing for LA Knight to move to RAW. They believe he would bring something new and exciting to Monday nights. RAW is known for its long storylines and character development, which could be great for someone like Knight.“According to those within the company, more than a handful of people are advocating for LA Knight to be moved to the #WWERAW brand in the near future as his presence on Netflix could be viewed as something of a refreshing change.”Knight has not wrestled much on RAW in the past.He has only had two matches on the show, one in March 2023 against Cody Rhodes and one in February 2024 against Ivar. But recently, he has been making surprise appearances on RAW, and that has led many to believe that a full-time move could be near.“LA Knight has been signed with the company since February of 2021 and has two Raw matches under his belt. He’s been appearing on Raw over the last two weeks, very, very briefly. However, there are more than a handful of people like we just said that want to see him on Monday Night Raw each and every week.”Knight’s recent storylines have involved superstars from both RAW and SmackDown.

Later, Knight was attacked again during his own match. This back-and-forth has made fans excited and shows that he fits in well on both brands.Moving him to RAW would open up fresh rivalries and give him more screen time.

The Bigger Picture: Lakers’ Offseason Strategy

Theentered the 2025 season with high expectations after acquiring Luka Dončić to pair with LeBron James . However, their early playoff exit against the Minnesota Timberwolves exposed glaring roster flaws. Now, the front office is eyeing upgrades, and a surprising target has emerged: former Boston Celtics defensive stalwart Marcus Smart.According to Bovada, the Los Angeles Lakers hold the second-best odds (+200) to land Smart, trailing only the Sacramento Kings (+150). With Washington likely moving on from the veteran guard, Los Angeles sees an opportunity to bolster its defense and add championship experience.Despite limited playing time over the past two seasons (just 54 total games), Marcus Smart remains a proven difference-maker.

Smart’s ability to guard multiple positions and disrupt opposing offenses would immediately address this weakness.As Matt John of Athlon Sports noted in the original report: ""Smart is a former Defensive Player of the Year who helped the Celtics make multiple extensive playoff runs, including a run to the NBA Finals in 2022.""While Los Angeles is a strong suitor, other teams are also in the mix:The Kings’ slightly better odds stem from their need for backcourt defense, but the Lakers’ championship pedigree could sway Smart’s decision.Washington isn’t expected to demand a hefty return for Smart, given their rebuild. The Lakers could offer:- A future second-round pick- A young prospect (e.g., Jalen Hood-Schifino)- Salary filler (e.g., Taurean Prince)This low-risk move would allow LA to retain flexibility for bigger trades while adding a proven playoff performer.Marcus Smart isn’t the only piece the Lakers need, but he fits their timeline. Here’s why:1. Defensive Upgrade – Smart’s tenacity would complement the offensive firepower of James and Dončić 2. Leadership – His experience in high-pressure games would benefit a roster with title aspirations.3. Cost-Effective – Unlike blockbuster trades, acquiring Smart wouldn’t gut the Lakers’ assets.Marcus Smart's interest from the Los Angeles Lakers suggests a practical approach to roster construction. He won't fix every issue they have, but his playoff experience and defensive prowess make him a prime target. Los Angeles' pursuit of another championship may benefit from this move if they can outmaneuver Sacramento.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Los Angeles Lakers Might Sign $100 Million Brooklyn Nets superstar; Backups In Store Too?

With Taylor Swift being one of the most successful artists in recent times, her 2023 interview has resurfaced and fans have a newfound respect for the billionaire pop star.In 2023, Taylor Swift was named “Time Person of the Year” and in an exclusive interview with Time, the billionaire pop star spoke about the struggles she faced.While recalling an uncomfortable time period of her life, Taylor Swift had said, “I realised every record label was actively working to try to replace me. I thought instead, I'd replace myself first with a new me. It's harder to hit a moving target.”These words of Taylor Swift have now resurfaced and has sparked a frenzy among fans.A fan took to X and wrote. “Swifties don’t talk enough about this. There’s a reason why every label is marketing their new(er) female artists the same way as Taylor. Same promo style, same branding, same image, same target demographic etc. All these newer main pop girls are basically Taylor Swift variants in many ways.”Another fan commented, “Like I said before, so many pop stars nowadays want to be Taylor and Britney’s replacements, they just don’t acknowledge it”, while a third fan posted, “My love, nobody can replace you, you are the GREATEST OF ALL TIME.”Taylor Swift went through a lot of trouble as she had lost the rights to her first six albums.

The trade that brought Luka Doncic may have quietly opened up a bigger problem

Windy ADVISES Luka Doncic to SIGN THE EXTENSION after Lakers' sale 🗣️ 'COULDN'T BE BETTER!' | Get Up

The Lakers made a power move by trading for Luka Doncic—but in doing so, they might’ve left their back door wide open. Anthony Davis ’ departure didn’t just leave a roster spot—it left a defensive void. The Timberwolves exposed it in Game 3, and analysts like Brian Windhorst are now warning what’s at stake. Without rim protection, all that offensive talent could go to waste.After the significant trade of Anthony Davis in February—where he was moved to Dallas for Luka Doncic—Los Angeles lost more than just an All-Star. They also lost a crucial defensive anchor. In the first round of the playoffs, Jaxson Hayes filled in for Davis, and the Lakers suffered: Minnesota outscored them 56‑26 in the paint in Game 3 alone. Windhorst mentions that without a reliable rim defender, perimeter skills don’t carry much weight — especially when the matchups change sides.Luka Doncic, LeBron James, and Austin Reaves are great on offense, but they don’t provide solid defense. League analysts have noted the team's ineffective closeouts and the vulnerability in the paint throughout the series. JJ Redick summed it up well — ""We don’t have rim protection.If we let players get by us, we’re going to give up points."" Their playoff defensive rating was among the worst, which is exactly the issue Windhorst points out.Windhorst’s message was clear: if the Lakers intend to run their perimeter-heavy lineup long-term, they must invest in interior defense. He didn’t call for another superstar, just “somebody who can defend at the rim”. They’ve got to find a solid athletic center—think Onyeka Okongwu or Mitchell Robinson—whether it’s through free agency, a minor trade, or the draft to really own their paint.The Lakers have choices. They might go after experienced rim-protectors like Clint Capela or Brook Lopez, look into expiring contracts like Daniel Gafford, or aim for long-term potential with a player like Nicolas Claxton. One thing's for sure: their offense won't hit its peak unless they secure the paint.Also Read: Lonzo Ball was supposed to revive the Los Angeles Lakers but something went wrong The Lakers kicked off the offseason with a bang—Luka Doncic, LeBron James, and Austin Reaves all on board—but the playoffs showed some cracks in their foundation. Brian Windhorst’s warning is straightforward yet tough: having talent isn’t enough without a solid defensive anchor. As the offseason chatter intensifies, the Lakers’ top priority is to secure that cornerstone.

Urban Meyer says there was no competitive advantage for Ohio State

“Competitive advantage: zero”

NCAA’s harsh penalties cost Ohio State a national championship run

“we would have played Notre Dame.”

Urban Meyer, the former Ohio State head coach, has a few particular things he wishes NCAA officials would have done differently in responding to the infamous 2010 tattoo scandal that nearly sunk the Buckeyes program. He inherited the fallout from the scandal, one that started in 2010 but went on long after Meyer got to Columbus, including a 2012 postseason ban that expunged any shot Meyer and an undefeated Buckeyes team had at competing for the national title. In a recent interview on The Triple Option podcast, Meyer said the sanctions were too severe, notably since the violations (trading memorabilia for tattoos) had nothing to do with competitive advantage, but rather were inherently subjective.The crux of the problem at hand, a few players trading memorabilia for ink, played no role in the Buckeyes' on-field success, Meyer said,because such things did not enhance performance or provide an advantage in terms of recruiting, he stressed. The controversy did not concern boosters or excessive inducements during the recruitment process, or even tampering, merely players exchanging souvenirs for tattoos.He also noted that the situation was overblown in hindsight. “There were some players trading… memorabilia for tattoos. That’s it,” he said, suggesting that the national furor and NCAA response far exceeded the offense. In the current NIL landscape, that type of activity hardly raises an eyebrow. Meyer argued that it did not give Ohio State an advantage in winning games or securing the best players.The scandal also led to Ohio State vacating all 12 wins from the 2010 season and imposed a postseason ban that impacted the 2012 team, Meyer’s first season in Columbus. That team was undefeated, but was ineligible to play for a national title. Meyer noted that his team missed the so-called football glory by pointing out thatAlso Read: Boston College gives first official look at new football uniforms for 2025 season Jim Tressel received a five-year show-cause penalty and a $250,000 fine for allegedly lying about the violations. While it was still wrong the way Tressel handled it, Meyer felt that the punishment was too much, especially at a time when players are profiting off their name, image, and likeness so openly. “The inconsistency of that penalty, to this day, still bothers me,” Meyer said, lamenting how quickly guidelines for college football have adjusted since that time.","Urban meyer says there was no competitive advantage for ohio state in the 2010 tattoo scandal.

Trent Frederic’s past stats show potential but raise questions



Connor McDavid and Evan Bouchard remain top priority



After losing Game 7 of the Stanley Cup Final, most teams would take a breath before launching into contract talks. But Edmonton Oilers general manager Stan Bowman appears to be wasting no time. Reports now confirm that the team is working on a max-term eight-year deal with forward Trent Frederic, a move that’s catching many off guard.Frederic, who was acquired mid-season from the Boston Bruins, played a minor role in the Oilers' postseason, notching only four points. He appeared in just one regular-season game after arriving in Edmonton. Despite his limited involvement, Bowman is clearly banking on Frederic's upside and long-term value.In 2023–24 with the Boston Bruins, Trent Frederic had a breakout campaign, scoring 18 goals and tallying 40 points across 79 games. Before his injury this season, he managed eight goals and 15 points in 57 games. Those numbers aren’t elite, but they are steady for a middle-six forward.Edmonton likely sees Frederic as a valuable depth piece, someone who can be a physical presence and offer secondary scoring. However, critics argue the contract term is a risky gamble, especially since Frederic hasn’t had the opportunity to showcase himself in a playoff setting consistently.While the Trent Frederic deal is making headlines, it’s not the main storyline fans were expecting to hear after the Stanley Cup Final. The real spotlight is on superstars Connor McDavid and Evan Bouchard, both of whom become eligible for contract extensions when NHL free agency begins on July 1.McDavid, widely considered the best player in the world, has two years remaining on his deal, but locking him in long-term will be Edmonton’s biggest challenge. Bouchard, meanwhile, emerged as a defensive powerhouse this postseason and is due for a significant raise as well.Read more: NHL trade rumor: Don Cherry fuels spicy Brad Marchand conspiracy with wild Bruins return claim after Panthers Cup win The NHL offseason is officially underway, and Edmonton is wasting no time making headlines.","Edmonton oilers general manager stan bowman appears to be wasting no time.

Matt Duchene commands the superior role in the Dallas Stars through his leadership and experience

This deal epitomizes loyalty and ambition: forward Matt Duchene has signed a four-year contract for just short of $18 million with the Dallas Stars. Instead of testing the waters of free agency on July 1, this 34-year-old veteran chose to extend his tenure with the organization, being the top point-getter for the team in the recent NHL season. His continued presence stabilizes the offensive core and only adds strength to its championship aspirations.What a fascinatingly late-blooming affair for Duchene in Dallas! Duchene single-handedly created the offensive core of the Stars in 2017-18 with 82 points in 82 games, including 30 goals and 52 assists. However, his contribution diminished in the playoffs while the tall-tale leather drove him six points in 18 games. Yet his handling and other intangible characteristics kept on counting. Having been present all season, much of the time, he found his way onto the ice, creating plays for the Dallas Stars, who reached the third round of the playoffs for the second year running to punish and humble on the mark.Since Matt Duchene has been a part of five NHL teams (Colorado Avalanche, Ottawa Senators, Columbus Blue Jackets, Nashville Predators, and currently thinking of joining the Stars), he brings along tons and tons of experience: 891 points in 1,138 regular-season matches.His versatility as a player-as both a scoring threat and a setup man, allowed him to blend seamlessly into Dallas's setup, adding scoring and some leadership to the table.General Manager Jim Nill stated that the new partnership was almost assured to succeed because of Duchene's immediate contributions both on and off the ice. Duchene's staying power within the Stars' long-term plans was cemented by his influence within the locker room and in the community beyond his numbers.
