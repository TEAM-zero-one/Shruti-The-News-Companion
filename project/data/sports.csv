Exploring the origins, career stats, and transfer that define his legacy",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/what-is-squirrel-whites-real-name-exploring-the-origins-career-stats-and-transfer-that-define-his-legacy/articleshow/124174780.cms,"Squirrel White (Image credits: IG/X)

How Squirrel White’s childhood nickname grew into a powerful lifelong sporting identity

Career totals reveal consistency, explosiveness, and high-level production across multiple seasons

Breakout sophomore season at Tennessee highlighted his potential before injuries slowed progress

Why Squirrel White transferred to Florida State seeking a fresh start and opportunity

Final Florida State chapter offers redemption, recognition, and chance to honor hidden real name

Most fans know him as Squirrel White, but very few actually know the name on his birth certificate. Long before he became a rising wide receiver, his great-grandmother gave him the nickname after noticing his quick, darting movements as a baby in her garden. That playful moment shaped an identity so powerful that it eclipsed his given name, Marquarius Malik White, which now only surfaces on official rosters and records.Unlike many athletes who earn nicknames from teammates, White’s was born in family roots. Over time, “Squirrel” became synonymous with his personality and his game-breaking quickness. His elusiveness on the field mirrored the very creature he was compared to as an infant, making the nickname a natural extension of his playing style.Over the course of his college career, White has compiled roughly 133 receptions for 1,712 yards and six touchdowns across 38 games. These totals reflect a wideout who, when healthy, brings consistent value and the ability to swing momentum in his team’s favor.At 5’10” and 170 pounds (77 kilograms), he doesn’t overwhelm defenders with size, but his sudden acceleration makes him a dangerous slot receiver. He thrives on screens and short-yardage routes, turning small spaces into big plays with his agility and vision.One of his finest moments came in the 2023 Orange Bowl, where he exploded for nine catches, 108 yards, and a touchdown — the type of stage where nicknames turn into legacies.White’s breakout season came in 2023 with Tennessee, when he hauled in 67 passes for 803 yards, becoming one of the team’s most reliable playmakers. His performance turned heads across the SEC and underscored why fans gravitated toward both his skills and his unusual name.But 2024 brought adversity. A knee injury slowed his production, limiting him to 34 catches for 381 yards. For a player who relies on agility and explosiveness, it was a frustrating reminder of how quickly momentum can shift.After three seasons in Knoxville, White sought a fresh start. With just one year of eligibility left, he entered the transfer portal looking for a system where his speed and skill set would be maximized. Florida State offered exactly that — a stage big enough to showcase him once more, and an opportunity to reset his career before the NFL For Marquarius Malik White, the man behind the “Squirrel” nickname, the move to Florida State represents more than just a transfer. It’s the final chance to prove that both his nickname and his real name deserve to be remembered. From a playful moment in a garden to highlight-reel plays under the lights, his journey is a reminder that sometimes the stories behind the names are as compelling as the games themselves.Also read: Jaxon Smith-Njigba erupts on hot mic after Seahawks’ nullified touchdown, referee’s disappointed stare sends fans into frenzy","Marquarius malik white is a wide receiver for the florida state seminoles.

Cam Newton highlights the contrast between Tua Tagovailoa’s potential and recent performance struggles

Off-field distractions likened to reality TV drama affecting team focus and results

Accountability remains, but Newton stresses Tua’s role in team struggles

Newton’s critique sparks debate about NFL pressures and quarterback scrutiny

Despite criticism, Newton expresses belief in Tua’s untapped capabilities

Cam Newton, speaking on ESPN's First Take, took aim at Tua Tagovailoa , pointing out that the Miami Dolphins quarterback has fallen short of expectations over the past year. Newton suggested that the team’s struggles go beyond simple statistics, hinting that off-field distractions are undermining performance. The former MVP compared the situation in Miami to a reality TV drama, emphasizing that the quarterback’s immense talent hasn’t been fully reflected on the field.“This Tua Tagovailoa that we have seen in the last 12 months, is not something and someone that is indicative of what we’ve seen before,” Newton said. He underlined the gap between Tua’s abilities and his current output, stressing that the quarterback is capable of much more. Newton’s perspective positions Tua’s underperformance as a combination of personal inconsistency and surrounding distractions, rather than a purely technical issue.Newton drew a striking comparison between the Dolphins’ current environment and the drama of Love Island. “When I see the situation that has taken place at Miami, it’s more 'Love Island drama' than football,” he remarked. By framing the off-field environment as a major disruptor, Newton suggested that the team’s focus and cohesion have suffered, making it harder for Tua to reach his potential.While Newton stopped short of placing full blame on Tagovailoa, he acknowledged that the quarterback is a key ingredient in the team’s challenges. “A large part, I wouldn’t say it’s all on Tua, but it is a main ingredient,” he said, emphasizing that leadership and performance from the quarterback position remain critical to Miami’s success. His assessment places Tua at the center of the narrative, while still considering other team issues within the franchise.The comments have fueled conversations across NFL circles about how talent, leadership, and distractions intersect. Newton’s candid remarks highlight the pressure on quarterbacks in high-profile teams, especially when expectations are high and performance dips. Fans and analysts alike are now debating how much off-field drama can influence results, and whether Tua can regain the form that made him a top-tier prospect.Even amid the critique, Newton conveyed confidence in Tua’s potential. He stressed that the quarterback has the tools and skill to rebound if focus returns to football fundamentals. The remarks suggest that Newton sees Miami’s current issues as a temporary setback rather than a permanent decline, highlighting the delicate balance between talent, environment, and consistency in the NFL.As the Dolphins navigate their early-season challenges, Newton’s observations serve as both a critique and a reminder of the high stakes surrounding elite quarterbacks. Tua’s next performances will be closely watched, not just for statistics, but for signs that he can rise above distractions and lead Miami back to contention.Also read: Jaxon Smith-Njigba erupts on hot mic after Seahawks’ nullified touchdown, referee’s disappointed stare sends fans into frenzy","Cam newton took aim at tua tagovailoa on espn's first take.

Explained: Super Over drama! Why was Dasun Shanaka given not out even after getting 'out'?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/asia-cup/explained-super-over-drama-why-was-dasun-shanaka-given-not-out-even-after-getting-out/articleshow/124168384.cms,"Super Over drama (Screengrab)

Why was Dasun Shanaka given not out even after getting 'out'?

Arshdeep Singh bowled to Shanaka, India appealed for a caught-behind, and the on-field umpire gave him out.

Shanaka reviewed, and UltraEdge showed no bat-ball contact, overturning the caught-behind dismissal.

During the review, Shanaka ran for a single, and Samson hit the stumps with a direct throw.

The ball was dead once the umpire initially gave Shanaka out, so he could not be run out.

As a result, Shanaka remained not out, saved by the technicality in the laws of cricket.

In a dramatic Asia Cup 2025 clash between India and Sri Lanka that went down to a Super Over on Friday, one moment left fans and even players scratching their heads: Dasun Shanaka being given ""not out"" despite what seemed like a dismissal.During Sri Lanka’s Super Over after they amassed an exact 202/5 to tie the score, Arshdeep Singh bowled a near-perfect yorker to Shanaka on his fourth delivery.The ball whizzed past the bat, prompting an immediate appeal from Arshdeep and wicketkeeper Sanju Samson. Umpire Gazi Sohel raised his finger for caught behind.Shanaka, however, decided to review.Now, here’s where things got confusing.Even as the caught-behind appeal was being processed, Shanaka inexplicably set off for a run.Wicketkeeper Sanju Samson, quick to notice, threw down the stumps with a direct hit.India celebrated, believing Shanaka was gone either way.However, since the initial decision had already been given as “out caught behind”, the ball was considered dead at that very moment.That meant Shanaka could not also be run out in the same sequence of play.When the review overturned the caught-behind dismissal, Shanaka survived completely despite being short of his ground.The ruling might appear confusing, but it’s rooted in the MCC laws of cricket: once a batter is declared out, the ball is dead instantly. Even if that dismissal is later overturned via DRS, no subsequent mode of dismissal from that same delivery can apply.India’s fielders were visibly perplexed, with umpire Sohel taking time to explain the law. Shanaka, for his part, was fortunate.Ultimately, Sri Lanka managed just two runs in the Super Over, leaving India to chase a modest target which they did with ease.The incident will likely spark further debate on whether the rules need tweaking for scenarios involving DRS, but as of now, Shanaka was saved by nothing more than a technicality.","Sri lanka's dasun shanaka given not out despite being given 'out' by umpire.

Reports suggest that L.A. Lakers might pursue Walker Kessler in 2025–26

Lakers Daily

According to Lakers Daily, the Los Angeles Lakers will once more try to acquire Walker Kessler, a big man for the Utah Jazz. As per Tony Jones of The Athletic, Kessler will reportedly not accept a rookie-scale contract extension. He is a gifted player.Additionally, he had initially signed a rookie-scale contract with the Utah Jazz, for which he will receive $4.8 million next year. He is currently eligible for an extension, and recent similar center deals suggest that he could be worth approximately $25 million per annum.Tony Jones further claimed that Kessler and the Utah Jazz will not consent to a rookie-scale extension. Next summer, Kessler will be a restricted free agent. The Minnesota Timberwolves selected professional basketball player Walker Kessler with the 22nd overall choice in the first round of the 2022 NBA draft. In the NBA, he is now a center for the Utah Jazz.After his sophomore year, Kessler declared for the 2022 NBA draft while playing collegiate basketball for the Auburn Tigers. Kessler has established himself as a formidable inside presence for the Jazz in his rookie campaign, securing a starting position with his defensive power.Now recently, rumors said that Walker Kessler might join the L.A. Lakers.Walker Kessler inked a rookie contract for $13.3 million over four years with the Jazz in 2022. This includes the guaranteed $5.5 million. Club options for the following two years were exercised. Furthermore, Kessler's 2024-25 pay is $2.9 million, and it will rise to $4.8 million the following season.He will be eligible to sign a restricted free agent contract following the 2025–2026 season. According to sources, Kessler had a net worth of $2 million in 2023, despite the fact that there isn't much information about his fortune available online.By now, his pay would have grown, and it is anticipated that it will raise even more when his rookie contract expires and he signs his second league contract.Even if the Los Angeles Lakers have a squad that could be able to contend for a championship this season, there is still room for improvement.In order to obtain some value for him, the Jazz may either give Kessler a qualifying offer during the winter or move him before he becomes a restricted free agent next summer. According to a league source, the Lakers might try to acquire Kessler in the future season, as they have done recently. Kessler has been the target of previous Lakers trade attempts as well.The Auburn product has a high asking price in Utah. Talking about him, the Lakers Daily wrote:“The Utah Jazz have a high asking price for Walker Kessler… One source toldthat the Lakers would have to part ways with Austin Reaves and multiple first-round picks to acquire Kessler.”It further stated:""A league source told Lakers Daily that the Lakers will attempt to trade for Kessler again during the 2025-26 season.. LAL tried to trade for Kessler the past two seasons.""During the previous season, Kessler averaged 11.1 points on 66.3% field goal shooting, 12.2 rebounds, and 2.4 blocks per game.

NFL insider weighs in on how Kirk Cousins can be linked to three teams amid Raheem Morris’ controversial statement



Kirk Cousins has stayed away from making any statements about his future in the league



The Atlanta Falcons’ quarterback and one of the most popular players in the league, Kirk Cousins, is in a pretty awkward situation with his team. While there have been many speculations about Kirk Cousins’ time as a starter is now over because of Michael Penix Jr. , the Atlanta Falcons’ head coach, Raheem Morris, made things clear recently. Amid this, NFL insider Nate Davis thinks there might be a few teams that could sign Kirk Cousins.A few hours ago, the Atlanta Falcons’ head coach, Raheem Morris shocked fans as he said, “Kirk lost his job last year. We’re not even close to that with Mike [Penix]...”The head coach added, “He had a bad day. We had a bad day. Mike is our quarterback. We got a lot of confidence in Mike. We’re moving forward with Mike. Mike’s the guy.”While this has sparked chaos among fans, NFL insider USA Today’s Nate Davis weighed in on Kirk Cousins’ situation and linked him to possibly three teams.USA Today’s Nate Davis wrote, ""Acquiring him would be a break-glass-in-case-of-emergency situation….It would also require ample cap room from potential suitors given Cousins would be owed the prorated version of the $27.5 million he’s owed in base salary this season.”Nate Davis also weighed in on Kirk Cousins nearing 40 and recovering from his Achilles surgery. He added, “The conditions would certainly be specific – especially since Cousins’ no-trade clause permits him to kill any deal – but if a team like the Lions, Rams or Seahawks suddenly found itself with a long-term need behind center and lacking sufficient confidence that in-house backups could persevere for an extended period. ""Amid all the mess that the Atlanta Falcons’ quarterback, Kirk Cousins, has found himself in, he has stayed silent and has not made any statements about his current situation.The Atlanta Falcons have not had a good start in the new season as the team ended up losing in the first match against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and in its last match against the Carolina Panthers.With the Atlanta Falcons gearing up for a match against the Washington Commanders, all eyes are on the team.Also Read: “He pulled his d*ck out and licked my ears”: Stefon Diggs faces serious sexual assault allegations from Chris Blake Griffith as Cardi B defends her boyfriend",Nfl insider weighs in on how kirk cousins can be linked to three teams amid raheem morris’ controversial statement.

The Baltimore Ravens arrive with the same 1-2 record after losing on Monday night but still bring a physical defense and a hungry roster.Former NFL quarterback Derek Carr said on the “Home Grown Network,” “I got the Ravens… You do not think that there is some toughness in that building that has been established.”The comment reflects a growing belief that Baltimore’s defense and rushing attack could push around Kansas City if the Chiefs do not find rhythm.Patrick Mahomes has faced uneven offensive production. Wide receivers Rashee Rice and Xavier Worthy have been unavailable due to injuries, forcing Mahomes to lean heavily on Travis Kelce , who has started slow. The star tight end dropped a key pass that became a late interception in a 20-17 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles last week and was caught in a sideline confrontation with head coach Andy Reid during the Week 3 win over the New York Giants.Former NBA player Gilbert Arenas added fuel to the narrative surrounding Kansas City’s offense. On his show “The Arena Gridiron,” Arenas said, “[Mahomes] lost his tight end to a woman. … Kelce done lost his name. The Gen Zs know him as what? Taylor Swift’s boyfriend.”Taylor Swift has been tied to any dip in Travis Kelce’s performance since their relationship became public in 2023. Kelce has 10 catches for 134 yards and one touchdown through three games, far below his usual pace. Arenas pointed out that Patrick Mahomes is missing key targets and operating with a depleted receiving group, making the offense easier to defend.The Chiefs need both Mahomes and Kelce to deliver against the Ravens to avoid a damaging 1-3 start. Fans will be watching Arrowhead Stadium closely Sunday night, and waiting to see if Brittany shares another family moment as her husband tries to keep Kansas City’s season alive.","Brittany mahomes shared a viral instagram video of her three kids ahead of a pivotal week 4 game. Kansas city is 1-2 and risks falling to 1-3 if it loses, a scenario that could threaten its bid for a 10th straight afc west title. Former nba player gilbert arenas blamed taylor swift for travis kelce’s slow start and patrick mahomes’ struggles.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124164569,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-73464,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

“puts steel in his spine,”

Russell Henley has been on fire in 2025, earning his spot on Team USA for the Ryder Cup.

She is also a book author and published a book, The Color Teil, which is a glimpse into her artistic journey for her fans.Their story starts in 2013 at a wedding. Teil’s sister married one of Russell’s childhood friends, and that’s where the two first crossed paths. Things moved quickly and by 2014, they were engaged, and in October 2015, they said “I do” in Georgia.Since then, Teil has been by Russell’s side through the highs and lows of professional golf.The couple doesn’t share a ton publicly, but they’re raising three kids together: Robert, Ruth, and Jane. After his win at the 2025 Arnold Palmer Invitational, Russell even called Teil the one whobalancing family life while building her own career.Their home life in Georgia looks pretty different from the intensity of the PGA Tour, and is more about family time, creativity, and parenting three little ones.At the end of the day, Russell may bring home the trophies, but Teil is a star in her own right.

John Salley says Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen ’s friendship ended for good in 2004

Michael Jordan did not receive condolences from Scottie Pippen after his father’s murder

Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen’s relationship has been strained by personal conflicts

Scottie Pippen describes his bond with Michael Jordan

Scottie Pippen and Michael Jordan had an amazing chemistry when they were together on the court, but when one considers their relationship outside the field, the situation becomes a little bit tricky. They have had their share of both personal misunderstandings and open quarrels with each other, which have kept them at least a couple of decades asunder. Ex-teammates and analysts indicate that they might not have been so close as fans imagine they might not even recover their friendship.John Salley, a four-time NBA champion who briefly played alongside both in Chicago, claims that the friendship between Jordan and Pippen effectively came to an end in 2004. In an interview on ""The OGs"" podcast in April 2025, Salley revealed that he recognized their relationship was over by 2004, noting a long-standing rift that had started before their public conflicts.In another conversation in April 2025, Salley explained that the rift had been resolved for quite a while, and he was skeptical about any chance of reconciliation. This was the point where their relationship began to break down, driven by Pippen's sense of being overshadowed.Even back when they were playing, there were some tensions. Pippen often felt like he wasn't getting the recognition he deserved, particularly when it came to the team's achievements. In his 2021 book ""Unguarded,"" Pippen brought up the murder of Jordan's father in 1993, but he didn't express any condolences at that moment, which later sparked some controversy.Dennis Rodman, a former teammate, said in a December 2024 interview that he never had conversations with Jordan or Pippen when they weren't playing, which shows how business-oriented their relationship was. He reiterated this in a January 2025 statement, making it clear that their bond was solely focused on the game.A significant personal matter traces back to 1993, when Jordan's dad was murdered. Stephen A. Smith disclosed in a March 2024 segment on ESPN's ""First Take"" that Jordan felt betrayed since Pippen didn't reach out with condolences. Smith repeated this in April 2024, stating that Jordan felt pain over Pippen's deliberate lack of sympathy during that time.During a January 2025 interview, Pippen referred to Jordan as a ""very difficult person"" when discussing attitude challenges. Later, in June 2025, Pippen made a startling comment regarding their relationship, stressing its intricacy. Furthermore, the breakup in March 2025 between Pippen's ex-wife Larsa and Jordan's son Marcus added more layers, as Marcus spoke out about substance issues.In the Marca interview on September 24, 2025, Pippen talked about his connection with Jordan as ""never been on the top shelf,"" blaming it on the business and life cycles. Craig Hodges, a former Bulls teammate, talked about the pivotal moment in their relationship on a May 2025 episode of the ""All the Smoke"" podcast, encouraging them to make amends by saying, ""We too old for that sh*t.""According to a Newsweek article from May 2025, Hodges was seen asking Jordan and Pippen to fix their differences. However, Salley voiced his doubts about a possible reconciliation in April 2025. A poll on X in September 2025 questioned if they could mend their relationship like Magic Johnson and Isiah Thomas.Users on X had their different opinion regarding this matter like one user commented, ""Scottie still milking Jordan’s name 😂"" while other said, ""It's like every 5 years he wanna get honest and speak on his relationship about his co workers from the 90s cmon let's move on season soon start"". While some other fan brought his stat by commenting, ""Pippen shot 34% in the 1996 finals btw"".Their friendship has shattered to the extent that some believes that it will never be the same ever again. One user said, ""Mike will never forgive Pipen"".Also Read: Kyrie Irving is ahead of plan in ACL rehab and could return stronger than anyone expects this season Even with their legendary journey, the bond between Michael Jordan and Pippen is still broken, stemming from work-related grudges and personal mistakes dating back to 2004.

India enter another final but continue to be sloppy in the field | Concerns ahead of title clash

Team India’s bowling coach Morne Morkel has shared an injury update on all-rounder Hardik Pandya and opener Abhishek Sharma ahead of their summit clash against Pakistan at the Dubai International Stadium on Sunday.Hardik, who bowled the first over of Sri Lanka’s innings and picked up a wicket, left the field and never returned. Meanwhile, Abhishek, who smashed a blazing 31-ball 61 with the bat, left the ground in the 9.2 over.“Both of them struggled with cramps during the game,” Morkel told reporters.“Hardik will be assessed tonight and tomorrow morning, and we’ll make a call on that. But both of them were just struggling with cramps during the game. Abhishek is fine,” he said.In a match that swung both ways, India held their nerve in the Super Over to stay unbeaten in the tournament.Morkel felt it was a good wake-up call for the team, as they have not been clinical so far.“I don’t think in this tournament we’ve played the complete game,” he admitted.“After every game there are discussions on areas we’d like to improve. With batting, can we rotate strike better in tough conditions, run harder between the wickets, and protect partnerships? From a bowling perspective, we need to sharpen our lengths, accuracy and decision-making in the first 10 overs, and be smarter in using variations like the yorker during the middle phase.“In the field, we’ve worked hard on catching under lights, so maybe it’s just a confidence issue. Across departments, there’s still work to be done. We are by no means the finished article, and we know that.”Morkel also revealed that after a gruelling match, the team will have an off day before the final, with only individual pool sessions and recovery work.“The key for the boys is to rest,” he said. “They’re already in ice baths, and recovery started right after the match. The best way to recover is sleep and staying off your feet. There will be pool sessions and massages before they get mentally ready for Sunday’s big battle. It’s a quick turnaround, and playing smart is going to be the key. There will certainly be no training.”",Hardik pandya and abhishek sharma both struggled with cramps.

The Super Over Controversy

Sri Lanka head coach Sanath Jayasuriya praised Abhishek Sharma and Pathum Nissanka , while questioning the ""grey areas"" in cricket after a controversial Super Over incident in the last Super Four match of the Asia Cup.""Abhishek Sharma is playing his natural game, and they have encouraged him to play his natural game. That's the key, because if someone is playing naturally, we need to encourage him to continue that,"" Jayasuriya told reporters after the match.""But whenever he wants to slow down, he knows how to do that as well. After six overs, if he wants to bat longer, he’s managing it. Day by day, he’s getting experience and batting really well. The good thing is that the coaching staff has given him the license to play his natural game. That's the key,"" he added.Abhishek scored a blazing 61, almost cancelled out by Pathum Nissanka, whose 107 off 58 balls brought Sri Lanka close to victory.""I think Pathum played a brilliant innings to get that total, but unfortunately, he got out on the first ball of the last over. That was a bit unfortunate. But right through those 20 overs, he batted really well to get 100 and put 202 runs on the board.Unfortunately, his dismissal in the last over proved to be the turning point,"" he said.Jayasuriya also explained why centurion Pathum Nissanka didn’t bat in the Super Over.""He was carrying a hamstring injury during the last two games and we were a little worried about him,"" he revealed.In the Super Over, drama unfolded with a bizarre incident. Arshdeep Singh struck on the first ball, dismissing Kusal Perera . On the fourth delivery, Dasun Shanaka missed, and Sanju Samson pouched it cleanly as Arshdeep appealed for caught behind. The umpire raised his finger despite no edge, even as Samson threw down the stumps for a run-out. Sri Lanka argued the ball was dead once the caught-behind decision was given, and the umpire agreed, overturning the run-out. It mattered little, as Shanaka fell on the very next ball.""I think that’s just the rules. According to the rules, if you appeal for the catch, then Dasun had to go by the third umpire’s call. The first decision always counts, not the second one. So he went for the replay, and it was not out. That’s what happened. But I think there are a few areas from this game that will need review to fine-tune the rules,"" Jayasuriya said.Here’s what rule 20.1.1.3 of the rule book says: “The ball is dead when a batter is dismissed. The ball will be deemed to be dead from the instant of the incident causing the dismissal.”This meant that despite the batter being clearly run out, the ball was deemed dead the moment Sanju completed the catch and the umpire gave it out.","Sri lanka coach sanath jayasuriya praises abhishek sharma and pathum nissanka.
