KOLKATA: Richa Ghosh is ready to wear a new cap. The World Cup-winning cricketer was appointed Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) in the state police by the Bengal government on Saturday. Later in the evening, a glittering one-hour felicitation ceremony was organised for Richa by the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) at the iconic Eden Gardens here.The 22-year-old cricketer went to the police headquarters in Kolkata in the afternoon to meet higher officials of state police where her appointment was finalised.She thus joined her World Cup-winning teammate Deepti Sharma (UP Police) along with other cricketers Mohammed Siraj (Telangana Police) and Joginder Sharma (Haryana Police) in the same post.At the Eden Gardens, Richa was presented with a golden bat and ball, while chief minister Mamata Banerjee personally handed over the Banga Bhushan medal, the DSP appointment letter and a gold chain. The CAB also handed her a cheque of Rs 34 lakh - Rs 1 lakh each for every run she scored in the World Cup final.Sharing the dais with former India captains Sourav Ganguly and Jhulan Goswami, Richa stood tall as the first from the state to bring home a World Cup.CAB president Ganguly emphasised on the batter's strike rate. ""I used to open the innings but know how difficult is the role of No. 6 and No. 7 batters in white-ball cricket. You get minimum balls to get maximum runs. Richa's strike made the difference for India's campaign in this World Cup,"" he said.Legendary Jhulan recalled the days when she first saw Richa. ""It was 2013 when Bengal cricket was not doing well. So I requested CAB officials to start a talent hunt programme. As they gracefully agreed, I had the opportunity to move to the districts and that was how I first saw Richa,"" Goswami, who later fought to get young Richa into the senior state side, stated.",Richa ghosh was appointed deputy superintendent of police (dsp) in the state police by the bengal government on saturday.

Factors Affecting a Possible Reunion

Accepting the New Reality

Trade rumors have linked NBA’s one of the most iconic sharpshooters with the Golden State Warriors. As Klay Thompson’s struggles continue with the Dallas Mavericks, a familiar storyline has resurfaced - could the four-time NBA champion find his way back to where it all began? A recent piece by Blue Man Hoop’s Peter O’Keefe floated the intriguing idea of a potential reunion between Thompson and the Golden State Warriors, the team with which he built his Hall of Fame legacy.At 35 years old, Thompson’s performance has taken a noticeable dip, raising questions about his future with the Luka Doncic-led Mavericks. O’Keefe suggested that the veteran guard might benefit from a change of scenery - perhaps even a return to the franchise that defined his prime years. The idea isn’t just rooted in sentimentality; it reflects the growing uncertainty surrounding Thompson’s fit in Dallas and whether a reunion with the Warriors could help rejuvenate the final stretch of his career.At 35, Thompson’s productivity has noticeably dipped in his first season with the Luka Doncic-led Mavericks. O’Keefe’s column questioned whether Dallas could continue justifying his current role, especially with Kyrie Irving sidelined due to injury.“There’s no doubt that another team could certainly utilize (Klay) Thompson far more productively than what the Mavericks currently are,” O’Keefe wrote last Monday. (H/t: Sporting News)He added that the Mavericks might soon face a difficult decision: wait for Irving’s return or explore trade options involving Thompson.The idea of a return to Golden State - where Thompson rose to stardom - was one of the potential scenarios O’Keefe mentioned.The numbers tell a clear story of decline for the veteran sharpshooter. Thompson is on pace for the worst statistical season of his career, averaging just 8.7 points per game while shooting 33.3% from the field and 29.4% from beyond the arc.For a player once renowned for his effortless shooting and off-ball movement, these numbers represent a dramatic downturn.No matter how his current stint in Dallas unfolds, Thompson’s legacy with the Golden State Warriors remains untouchable. Alongside Stephen Curry and Draymond Green, he helped the franchise rise from playoff hopefuls to dynasty builders.Their partnership led to four NBA championships and helped the Warriors break through in the highly competitive Western Conference after an early playoff exit in 2014.However, after the 2023–24 season, it became clear that Golden State had to pivot away from their long-time star. The team’s decision to move on was seen as both practical and painful - a recognition that Thompson was no longer the same elite two-way player who defined their championship era.While O’Keefe entertained the idea of a reunion, he noted that financial realities could complicate the move. “Perhaps a reunion between Thompson and the Warriors could be on the cards at some stage, but on his current deal, it seems unlikely that the franchise would trade for one of their greatest ever players,” he wrote.• Contract Value: Thompson’s current deal is substantial, limiting trade flexibility.• Age and Decline: At 35, teams may hesitate to take on his salary given his declining efficiency.• Roster Fit: Golden State’s focus has shifted toward developing younger talent.While Warriors fans may still dream of a nostalgic reunion, the current version of Thompson is far removed from his prime. His body has endured years of wear, and his shot no longer carries the same lethal consistency.The question remains: would returning to Golden State rekindle that spark, or has time simply caught up with one of the greatest shooters in NBA history?Also read: NBA trade rumors: Dallas Mavericks predicted to acquire $130 million Miami Heat superstar to improve standing in Western Conference For now, the consensus seems to lean toward acceptance. Klay Thompson will always be remembered as a cornerstone of the Warriors dynasty - regardless of how the remaining chapters of his career unfold.","At 35 years old, klay thompson’s performance has taken a noticeable dip, raising questions about his future with the luka doncic-led mavericks.

Known for his defensive coaching, he has trained NBA stars like Kevin Durant, Jayson Tatum, Joel Embiid, and Bradley Beal under top trainer Drew Hanlen.Notably, Clark’s second WNBA season was tough. She struggled with multiple muscle injuries and managed to play only 13 out of 44 games. Just as she was ready to return late in the season, she sprained her ankle during recovery from her second groin strain. Despite her absence from the season, she remains one of the biggest names in the league.Off the court, Clark remains active.

Brittany Mahomes’ new advisory board appointment adds a cultural shift moment to a growing NWSL era





More coverage on NFL:

The Kansas City Chiefs are in the middle of a painful reset week and not just because Patrick Mahomes is coming off a rare touchdown-less performance. Kansas City’s QB1 is regrouping, refocusing, and trying to recalibrate an offense that suddenly looks uneven.But while conversations around the Chiefs have been dominated by red-zone issues, missed opportunities, and Mahomes admitting “I got to be better,” there’s another Mahomes headline hitting at the exact same time, one that has nothing to do with football mechanics. Brittany Mahomes isn’t just the loudest supporter inside the CPKC suites anymore. She’s officially stepping into the boardroom of women’s sports and Patrick had no words. Just a silent repost.The Kansas City Current’s rise has already been one of the most impressive business stories in American women’s sports. Now, Brittany Mahomes is moving from co-owner to shaper of direction. The NWSL confirmed she has joined a star-loaded advisory board of “athletes, investors, and cultural icons who will focus on marketing, branding, fan engagement, and player initiatives starting in 2026.”Jessica Berman said the group “will serve as mentors and cultural connectors while helping expand the league’s reach through partnerships and appearances. ”Names like Magic Johnson, Sue Bird, Ken Griffey Jr., Eli Manning, Aly Raisman, Chris Paul and more are in the same room.

Patrick posted the announcement to his Instagram stories with zero caption, letting the moment speak for itself.Kansas City is now a two-sport dynasty incubator, one on the field, one in expansion mode. CPKC Stadium changed the landscape. A $52 million facilities expansion is in motion.

Potential Benefits for the Philadelphia Phillies

Themay be gearing up for a major offseason rotation, with reports linking them to formeras a potential replacement for Harrison Bader. Following another postseason run that fell just short of a World Series berth, the Phillies are looking to strengthen their outfield and add more firepower to their lineup - and Bellinger’s combination of elite defense, power hitting, and versatility could be exactly what they need.Bellinger’s market value has surged after a strong season with the New York Yankees, and with his decision to opt out of his $25 million player option, he’s expected to command a lucrative multi-year deal worth around $80 million. As one of the most dynamic free agents available, the 30-year-old outfielder’s ability to play multiple positions makes him an attractive fit for Philadelphia, especially as they aim to take the next step toward championship contention.After a strong season in New York, Cody Bellinger officially opted out of his contract with the Yankees, making him one of the most coveted free agents this winter. The 30-year-old had a $25 million player option for the upcoming season but is now set to explore a long-term deal that could reportedly reach around $80 million.ESPN’s Jorge Castillo broke the initial news, writing: “As expected, New York Yankees outfielder Cody Bellinger plans to opt out of his contract and become a free agent next month, a source told ESPN.Bellinger, 30, has a $25 million player option for next season. After a rebound season in his first year in pinstripes, he presumably will receive widespread interest in free agency -it should yield a lucrative multi-year contract. ” (H/t: Sporting News)Following the World Series, MLB Network insider Jon Heyman confirmed the move, stating that Bellinger had officially opted out.Cody Bellinger’s time in New York proved to be a revival of sorts. After being traded from the Chicago Cubs in what many described as a salary dump, the outfielder delivered one of his best all-around seasons in years.His power numbers and improved plate discipline - highlighted by a career-best 13.7% strikeout rate - reaffirmed his value as a premier offensive weapon. His defensive flexibility further boosts his market value, with the ability to play all three outfield spots and even first base when needed.While both New York teams - the Yankees and Mets - are onsidered strong contenders to bring him aboard, Sports Illustrated’s Will Laws and Nick Selbe see the Philadelphia Phillies as a realistic and strategic fit for Bellinger.They wrote: “After being traded to New York in what was essentially a salary dump for the Cubs, Bellinger swatted 29 home runs - his most since hitting 47 in his MVP campaign in 2019 - to go along with a career-best 13.7% strikeout rate. Add in plus outfield defense in the corners and capable coverage in center field, and the decision to opt out of his contract was an easy one. Bellinger is clearly one of the premier bats available this winter - not too bad for a guy who was non-tendered by the Dodgers just three years ago. ”Adding Cody Bellinger would not only fill the gap left by Harrison Bader but also provide lineup versatility for manager Rob Thomson. Bellinger could handle center field duties while occasionally stepping in at first base to give Bryce Harper rest days as a designated hitter.• Reliable left-handed bat with power• Defensive depth across multiple positions• Veteran leadership and championship experience• Proven postseason performerBellinger’s offensive consistency and defensive reliability could be exactly what the Philadelphia Phillies need to make another deep playoff run after falling short of a World Series appearance.Cody Bellinger’s decision to hit the open market sets the stage for an intense bidding war, but the Philadelphia Phillies appear to be a logical and appealing destination. His combination of power, defense, and playoff experience makes him an ideal fit for a franchise eager to turn near misses into championships.Also read: MLB trade rumors: New York Mets predicted to land $120 million Boston Red Sox superstar to reset lineup and boost playoff push If Philadelphia lands the former MVP, it could be the decisive move that propels them back to the World Series conversation.","Cody bellinger officially opted out of his contract with the new york yankees, making him one of the most coveted free agents this winter.

A Calculated Gamble

Theare reportedly exploring a bold move this offseason that could redefine their bullpen and playoff aspirations. Rumors suggest that the team is eyeing formerfor a potential one-year, $10 million deal - a calculated attempt to solidify their late-inning pitching. After a rollercoaster 2025 season with the New York Yankees, Williams could be the piece Detroit needs to make a serious run.As TJ Morin noted, “The Detroit Tigers seem to only have one more chance at a title run with their Cy Young, Tarik Skubal, if they don’t trade him this offseason.” With Skubal’s future uncertain, adding an elite reliever like Williams may be Detroit’s final push toward championship contention. (H/t: Sporting News)Devin Williams’ 2025 season was far from his usual dominance. The right-hander, who built his reputation between 2021 and 2024 with a sub-2.50 ERA, struggled in New York’s pressure cooker environment. He finished the year with a 4.79 ERA, 18 saves, 90 strikeouts in 62 innings, and several blown opportunities. Analysts attribute the dip to Yankee Stadium’s hitter-friendly setup and the unrelenting scrutiny of New York’s media.Now entering free agency, Williams is unlikely to return to the Bronx.A fresh start in Detroit could help him rediscover his rhythm, while the Detroit Tigers gain a much-needed veteran presence in a bullpen desperate for consistency.Comerica Park’s spacious dimensions and reputation as a pitcher-friendly venue make it an ideal landing spot for Devin Williams. Detroit’s bullpen has lacked a high-strikeout closer since Gregory Soto’s departure, and Williams - still boasting a 13.06 K/9 rate - fits that need perfectly. For Williams, Detroit offers a lower-pressure market and the perfect rebound setting.• Acquire a proven late-inning reliever with elite strikeout potential• Improve bullpen depth and mentorship for younger arms• Low-risk, high-reward one-year deal• Opportunity to reset his market value• A ballpark that minimizes home runs and hard contact• Freedom from the high expectations of New York• Free up payroll for more consistent bullpen options• End uncertainty around Devin Williams’ rebound potentialFor both sides, this rumored deal is a strategic test. The Detroit Tigers get a potential game-changer for a short-term price, while Devin Williams gets a chance to rebuild his image in a friendlier environment. The Yankees, meanwhile, gain financial flexibility.Also read: MLB trade rumors: Los Angeles Dodgers potentially eyeing $57 Million Chicago Cubs star in blockbuster deal to bolster squad before trade deadline If the deal materializes, it could mark a turning point for Detroit’s bullpen - and perhaps Williams’ career.

NEW DELHI: India’s final T20I against Australia at The Gabba in Brisbane ended without a result as persistent rain and lightning forced the match to be abandoned on Saturday. Before the weather intervened, India had raced to 52 for no loss in just 4.5 overs, sealing the five-match series 2-1.This result gave India their fifth consecutive T20I series win over Australia, underlining their continued dominance in the shortest format. Openers Abhishek Sharma (23 not out) and Shubman Gill (29 not out) provided a brisk start, treating the crowd to some delightful strokeplay before the skies opened up and forced the players off the field.Abhishek, who became the second fastest Indian to reach 1000 T20I runs, was given two early lives in the powerplay — first when Glenn Maxwell dropped him at long-off off Ben Dwarshuis, and then when Dwarshuis himself put down a chance at the boundary off Nathan Ellis. Making the most of those reprieves, the left-hander struck two elegant boundaries and looked set for a big score before rain had the final say. Gill, meanwhile, looked in sublime touch, timing his shots beautifully and hitting six boundaries.Once play was called off, India were declared series winners, having earlier registered victories in Hobart and the Gold Coast after losing the opening match in Melbourne.After the match, Abhishek Sharma and captain Suryakumar Yadav addressed the media.During the press conference, a reporter asked Abhishek about his partnership with Shubman Gill, which has often been described as an “Ice and Fire” combination.Abhishek smiled and responded, “I’d actually say we’re more like fire and fire. The way Shubman was batting today. We’ve been playing together since the Under 12 days, so there’s a deep understanding between us. I usually know what shot he’s about to play, and he understands which bowler I’m planning to target. Sometimes he helps me with shot selection, and I do the same for him — that chemistry is something we really enjoy on the field. ”His words perfectly summed up the bond between two of India’s brightest young batters — a partnership built on years of friendship, trust, and shared firepower at the top.","India’s final t20i against australia at the gabba in brisbane ended without a result as persistent rain and lightning forced the match to be abandoned.

Shohei Ohtani’s message shows his bond with teammates runs deeper than the game

Miguel Rojas wasn’t supposed to be the headline hero of the World Series — but baseball loves surprises. When the veteran infielder crushed a game-changing home run in the Fall Classic, he gave the Los Angeles Dodgers more than just a lead — he gave them momentum. The 36-year-old, who’s built his career on grit and defense, found himself at the center of one of the most emotional moments of the Dodgers’ championship run. And what followed in the dugout turned that swing into something unforgettable.Rojas later shared that as he returned to the bench, he was greeted by none other than Shohei Ohtani — the two-way superstar who has transformed the Dodgers’ clubhouse with both talent and heart. Speaking to MLB broadcaster Chris Rose, Rojas revealed how Ohtani walked up to him, smiling, and said something that instantly became a story fans can’t stop talking about. “I think one of the coolest things that happened in my life so far. ... I’m by the bat rack like laying my helmet, and Shohei came to me and say ‘Miggy, you can’t retire next year. You’re playing with me for 10 more years,’” Rojas recalled, laughing as he relived the moment.It was just one line, but it spoke volumes. Rojas, who has often hinted at nearing the end of his playing career, replied with humor and heart: “Shohei, I’m old, and I don’t know if I can play for 10 more years, but I’ll play with you next year for sure.”That lighthearted exchange summed up everything fans love about this Dodgers team — a blend of experience, youth, and unshakable camaraderie. Ohtani, known for his calm presence and relentless work ethic, has not only redefined the game with his two-way brilliance but also transformed the dugout energy. His bond with veterans like Rojas proves that leadership isn’t just about home runs or strikeouts — it’s about lifting the people around you.Moments like these remind fans why the Dodgers continue to feel more like a family than a franchise. Behind the fireworks and the trophies lies a team built on mutual respect and shared joy. When Shohei Ohtani told Rojas, “Play with me,” it wasn’t just a joke — it was a glimpse into the heart of a champion.For Rojas, that simple gesture from one of baseball’s biggest stars turned a personal milestone into something bigger — a moment of connection that defined the Dodgers’ back-to-back World Series triumphs. And for fans, it’s a reminder that the best stories in baseball don’t just happen on the field — they’re written in the dugout, one heartfelt word at a time. Because sometimes it's not the swing that makes history - it's the bond behind it. And in that quiet dugout moment, Shohei Ohtani and Miguel Rojas showed the world exactly what championship heart looks like. Moments like this remind everyone that baseball's real magic isn't in the stats - it's in the people who make it unforgettable.Also read: ""Falling in love again"": Shane Bieber’s wife Kara turns Toronto Blue Jays’ World Series heartbreak into a sweet family moment fans can’t stop talking about","Miguel rojas hit a game-changing home run in the world series for the los angeles dodgers.

Tom Brady says the quiet part out loud after FOX Sports swaps Mark Sanchez for Drew Brees,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/tom-brady-says-the-quiet-part-out-loud-after-fox-sports-swaps-mark-sanchez-for-drew-brees/articleshow/125185389.cms,"Tom Brady welcomes Drew Brees to FOX Sports after Mark Sanchez’s exit, highlighting accuracy, career production and a major shift in the network’s NFL booth.

Tom Brady reacts publicly to Drew Brees replacing Mark Sanchez at FOX Sports

Drew Brees steps into Mark Sanchez’s former role as Brady highlights the accuracy conversation



Tom Brady reacted to Drew Brees taking over Mark Sanchez’s spot at FOX Sports, and the response instantly pulled attention across the NFL . The move puts two of the most accurate quarterbacks in league history under the same network roof, and Brady made sure the focus keyword, Tom Brady, was in the first line as he set the tone with his usual dry-fire humor.Brees’ hiring comes as FOX Sports officially parted ways with Sanchez following his ongoing felony case. The network announced Brees’ arrival with a highlight reel, and Brady immediately jumped in with a punchy, public welcome. The two quarterbacks now headline a reshaped analyst lineup built on production, accuracy and career-long credibility.Tom Brady did not hold back when FOX Sports confirmed Drew Brees as the new analyst replacing Mark Sanchez. Brady shared FOX Sports’ announcement clip and attached a line that instantly made waves across social media. His message read:“And just like that I become the 3rd most accurate QB at @FOXSports (Terry still has both of us beat) Welcome to the family @drewbrees!!!”The accuracy comment was rooted in fact. Drew Brees retired with a 67.7% completion rate, which places him third all time behind Joe Burrow and Tua Tagovailoa. Brady’s reaction added a layer of self-awareness and competition that people rarely hear from him, and it worked because the numbers back all of it.Brees is stepping into a major role. FOX Sports expects him to call games with Adam Amin starting next week and remain on the team through at least 2026. He already has experience across NBC Sports, ESPN’s “First Take” and Netflix’s international game coverage. FOX Sports is betting on a quarterback who built his legacy on precision, control and film-room mastery.Mark Sanchez’s exit shifts the balance of FOX’s broadcast team. According to multiple outlets, FOX Sports cut ties as Sanchez faces a felony battery case in Indiana. He pleaded not guilty, and the legal process is ongoing. FOX Sports confirmed to The Athletic that he is no longer part of the broadcast crew. The decision opened the lane for Brees, and Brady’s reaction shows that the quarterback fraternity is already treating the move as a major shakeup.Drew Brees enters FOX Sports at a moment when the network needs stability, professionalism and credibility in the booth. He retired with 80,358 passing yards, 571 touchdowns and one of the most efficient careers the league has ever seen. The numbers place him behind Tom Brady in yardage and touchdowns but ahead of almost everyone in accuracy and consistency.Brees shared his own statement following the announcement. He said:“I appreciate the opportunity FOX has given me in the booth and with their team. I hope my passion for this game is reflected in the knowledge and insight I provide to fans each Sunday.”His arrival is rooted in a reputation built across two decades with the New Orleans Saints and the San Diego Chargers. Former teammate Darren Sproles described Brees’ leadership on “Up & Adams,” saying:“For him, to mention me out of all the weapons that he had. That is very special. With Drew, you didn’t have to think like that on the field. Drew always put you in the right place at the right time.”These details matter because FOX Sports is replacing a quarterback known for chaotic storylines with one known for structure and precision. Mark Sanchez’s legal issues removed him from the booth as he deals with felony battery and multiple misdemeanor charges after an incident in Indianapolis earlier this year. He had already been sidelined after being stabbed and arrested on the same night. He pleaded not guilty and awaits further proceedings.Drew Brees offers none of the uncertainty, and that is part of the reason FOX Sports moved quickly. He already worked on NBC’s Notre Dame broadcasts, contributed to Football Night in America, and appeared on “First Take” before signing with FOX Sports. His presence turns the broadcast team into a high-accuracy, high-football-IQ group, which pairs naturally with the tone Tom Brady wants to bring to television.Brady himself is walking into his own broadcast era. He will be in the booth this Sunday covering the Detroit Lions and Washington Commanders, while the New England Patriots and Tampa Bay Buccaneers face each other in one of the biggest matchups of the weekend. Brady refused to pick a side in the game, saying:“Just... don’t ask me to pick any sides here.”","Tom brady welcomes drew brees to fox sports after mark sanchez’s exit.

A Battle of Momentum at Fiserv Forum

Thereceived a huge boost ahead of their NBA Cup matchup against the Chicago Bulls on November 7, 2025, as superstar. This update comes as a relief for Bucks fans who were concerned after the Greek Freak dealt with left knee soreness in recent days. With his name officially removed from the injury list, Giannis is set to lead Milwaukee in a must-win clash against a red-hot Bulls team that currently sits atop the Eastern Conference with a 6-1 record.This game is shaping up to be one of the standout fixtures of the NBA Cup group stage, featuring two franchises with contrasting trajectories. The Bucks are looking to regain momentum after a recent loss to the Toronto Raptors, while the Bulls have been one of the league’s early-season surprises, combining solid defense with balanced scoring. Having Giannis back on the floor gives Milwaukee the competitive edge they need to keep pace with their conference rivals.Giannis Antetokounmpo has been nothing short of dominant this season, averaging 32.3 points, 12.6 rebounds, and 6.3 assists per game. His performance continues to solidify his reputation as one of the most impactful players in the NBA. The Milwaukee Bucks will rely heavily on his leadership and all-around game, especially considering their current injury situation.Despite the good news surrounding Giannis, the Bucks will be missing other key contributors. Kevin Porter Jr. is out after undergoing surgery on his right knee, and Taurean Prince remains sidelined with a neck strain. These absences could shorten Milwaukee’s rotation, making Giannis Antetokounmpo’s presence even more vital to the team’s success.The Chicago Bulls enter the matchup in excellent form but are also dealing with health setbacks. Star guard Coby White has been ruled out, while Ayo Dosunmu’s availability remains uncertain. Even so, the Bulls’ depth has shined this season, with standout performances from Josh Giddey and Nikola Vucevic helping Chicago maintain its strong early record. The Bulls’ combination of youth and experience has created a winning formula, but missing White could test their offensive rhythm against a resilient Bucks squad.Tonight’s showdown promises intensity, as both teams aim to solidify their positions in the NBA Cup standings. The Milwaukee Bucks, led by a determined Giannis Antetokounmpo, will look to bounce back on their home court at the Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

Cam Thomas’ sudden setback forced the Brooklyn Nets to rethink its strategies in a early-season twist

Due to an injury to the same problematic left hamstring that destroyed the previous season, Cam Thomas, the Brooklyn Nets ' top scorer was forced to miss Wednesday night's 112-103 victory over the Indiana Pacers. With 6:46 remaining in the first quarter against the Pacers, Thomas missed a 15-foot stepback jumper, seemingly hurting himself on the landing.Cam Thomas was later classified as OUT by the team prior to tonight's game against the Detroit Pistons. He was sidelined indefinitely as a result of the setback, in addition to being out for the rest of the match. The great shooting guard may face future difficulties after re-injuring the same hamstring that prevented him from playing in 59 games the previous season.Cam Thomas, who recently sustained a hamstring injury, will be missing from Brooklyn. Even though he will be missed, this might be the ideal chance for the rookies. Thomas had a great start to the season prior to the injury , averaging 21.4 points on 40.2% field goal and 35.6% three-point shooting.However, in his eight starts, he has only contributed 2.6 assists per game, which is indicative of his ongoing scoring-first role.Even so, Thomas has been making every effort to enjoy playing basketball some more.Thomas may miss Friday's game against the Detroit Pistons , and the team will reevaluate him on Thursday, according to head coach Jordi Fernandez. Although it's regrettable that Brooklyn's 23-year-old star might not be playing, this presents a chance that the team should take advantage of right away.His absence comes at the worst possible moment for the Nets. With Drake Powell and Ben Saraf out for tonight's game, the squad has already suffered several blows to its depth. Brooklyn still lacks a starting point guard who can reliably move the ball within the offence without Thomas.The Brooklyn Nets now have a number in the victory column that is greater than zero. On Wednesday night, the Nets defeated the Indiana Pacers 112-103 to secure their first victory of the season away from home.For a team that had its worst start in ten years, it was a breath of relief. Brooklyn is rebuilding, so dropping games makes sense. Now, they are ready for their upcoming matches, with or without Thomas.Also read: Is Cam Thomas playing?

How Connor McDavid's wife Lauren Kyle’s bold interior design identity is redefining what an NHL power couple looks like,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/how-connor-mcdavids-wife-lauren-kyles-bold-interior-design-identity-is-redefining-what-an-nhl-power-couple-looks-like/articleshow/125149911.cms,"Lauren Kyle, fiancée of NHL star Connor McDavid, is redefining the role of athletes' partners. She's built a powerful personal brand centered on sophisticated home design, proving WAGs can be influential entrepreneurs. Kyle's approach challenges traditional NHL masculinity, pushing the league towards a more modern, visually driven era and establishing herself as a significant market voice.

Lauren Kyle’s brand narrative reflects the shift toward design-led, CEO-style WAGs rather than just “player wives”





More coverage on NHL:

There was a time when the partners of pro athletes were barely seen, rarely quoted, and almost never included in the marketing conversation, especially in the NHL, which historically hosts one of the most “closed doors, keep it all quiet” cultures in North American sports. But Lauren Kyle, the fiancée of Edmonton Oilers superstar Connor McDavid , doesn’t exist in that old template.She’s not an accessory. She is the architect of a personal brand that leans into design, refinement, and highly curated home aesthetics. The conversations around her work have been loud, polarizing, and surprisingly influential. And now, she’s becoming a case study in how WAG entrepreneurship can shape cultural direction, not just add gloss to a player’s fame.Lauren Kyle’s rise isn’t simply about the “white and metallic house” moment that went viral. It’s the fact that she doubled down, she didn’t run from the discourse. She recast the reaction as proof that her vision evokes emotion. And in a luxury economy, emotion sells.Modern NHL fans tend to assume hockey culture = traditional masculinity + limited visual references. But Kyle is pushing an entirely different energy, magazine spreads, reflective surfaces, lifestyle-forward execution, and design-first storytelling.And that is exactly why her entrepreneurial trajectory matters. She isn’t evolving alongside the NHL brand, she’s dragging parts of the league into a more visually modern era with her.And it also reframes McDavid’s public image: not just athlete, but cultural architecture subject. Today, when people say things like “Lauren Kyle has an aesthetic,” that’s not gossip, that’s branding evidence. It means she has moved from a partner role to a market voice.Her message isn’t subtle: hockey wives aren’t background props anymore. Lauren Kyle is shaping the stage itself and the NHL has never seen a design-forward power couple quite like this.","Lauren kyle, fiancée of nhl star connor mcdavid, is redefining the role of athletes' partners.

Buffalo Sabres stunned as Rasmus Dahlin takes personal leave,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/buffalo-sabres-stunned-as-rasmus-dahlin-takes-personal-leave/articleshow/125171976.cms,"Rasmus Dahlin (Image Via Twitter)

How the Buffalo Sabres will adjust Without their Captain on the Ice



The Buffalo Sabres are getting ready to go without their captain and mainstay on defense, Rasmus Dahlin, who has left the team for an unspecified period for personal reasons. The team made the announcement on Friday that Dahlin will be away while he returns home to Sweden to be with his fiancée, Carolina Matovac. The 25-year-old defenseman has been a consistent contributor to Buffalo's defense this season, with nine points in 14 games, but now the focus understandably shifts from hockey to family.Dahlin's choice coincides with a very personal and emotional story in his life. Matovac, suffering from sudden heart failure in summer, needed emergency CPR, life support, and finally a heart transplant. She has been recuperating in Sweden while Dahlin has been in North America to start the NHL season. The Athletic's Matthew Fairburn reports that Sabres coach Lindy Ruff has revealed that Matovac's condition is stable and the whole team is behind Dahlin's move. Ruff added, ""I don’t think you can describe it. I don’t think you can feel what he’s feeling. I’m very passionate about the fact that no one would want to walk in his shoes and have dealt with what he dealt with. He has the support of everybody on this.""With Dahlin gone, Buffalo will have to make adjustments both in terms of playing style and atmosphere in the locker room. His absence as captain and one of the best defensemen in the NHL creates a huge gap in both leadership and playmaking.It is anticipated that defensemen Owen Power and Mattias Samuelsson will take the extra defensive workload during Dahlin's leave of absence, as the Sabres will try to remain competitive. Ruff might also depend to a greater extent on inexperienced defensemen in the areas of keeping the puck and changing the play, which will be a challenge that can uncover maturity and depth in Buffalo’s young core that is already going through an emotional period.The Sabres are now looking at the picture beyond just victories and defeats.

Tyreek Hill’s future remains uncertain as he weighs recovery, retirement options



More NFL coverage

Tyreek Hill isn’t letting the speculation about his future with the Miami Dolphins slide. Rumors spread like wildfire after NFL reporter Omar Kelly suggested the star wide receiver could be cut in 2026 to free up cap space, pointing to his season-ending knee injury and the potential financial benefit of an insurance policy if he retired. Hill reacted to it immediately on social media with a blunt and bold, 5-word message: “Omar you don’t know shiii.”The injury, suffered in Week 4 during Miami’s 27-21 victory over the New York Jets, was a major blow for both Hill and the Dolphins. He tore multiple ligaments in his knee, forcing surgery the following day and ending his 2025 season. Before the injury, Hill had already shown flashes of his usual explosiveness, compiling 265 yards and one touchdown in just four games. Hill’s NFL journey began with the Kansas City Chiefs before he was traded to Miami in 2022. He signed a four-year, $120 million extension with the Dolphins, placing him among the league’s highest-paid receivers. Over his four seasons in Miami, Hill has amassed 4,733 receiving yards and 27 touchdowns, helping the team reach the playoffs twice and serving as one of the offense’s primary weapons.Despite the rumors, Hill has been candid about weighing retirement depending on his physical and mental readiness.On the “The Set” podcast with former teammate Terron Armstead, Hill reflected on the toll football takes. He stressed that he wants to be thoughtful about any decision and appreciates the balance between family life and career accomplishments. “It’s supposed to happen real soon, so wish us both luck,” Hill remarked, acknowledging the uncertainty surrounding his next steps.Miami as a franchise is also facing turbulence. After a disappointing 2-7 start, general manager Chris Grier was let go, and head coach Mike McDaniel’s job has come under scrutiny. Hill’s absence has amplified the team’s struggles, raising questions about how the Dolphins will perform without one of their top playmakers.For now, Hill’s message to fans and critics is clear: speculation will not dictate his path. Recovery and preparation remain his priorities, and Miami supporters will be watching closely to see if he can return to his elite form and continue shaping the team’s offense.",Tyreek hill responded to speculation about his future with the miami dolphins on social media.
