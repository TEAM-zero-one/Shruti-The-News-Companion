From Size Of The Venue to Fan Fatigue, A Few Key Factors Decide Super Bowl Ticket Prices

Super Bowl 59 may very well be one of the most talked-about and heavily publicised Super Bowls in NFL history. Not only is the Kansas City Chiefs aiming for a rare three-peat, but the team’s tight end Travis Kelce is in a relationship with the most popular pop star of her generation, Taylor Swift. However, ticket prices this year for Super Bowl LIX are down significantly ahead of Sunday's game.StubHub reported this week that the ""Get In"" price was $3,229 which is 5 per cent lower than the previous day and down 43 per cent compared to this time last year. However, StubHub spokesperson Adam Budelli recently broke down why there are a few practical reasons for this.According to reports, more than 4,700 tickets are available on StubHub on Wednesday night. The average ticket price has reportedly dropped to about $6,900, which marks a 17% drop from last year. However, Budelli explains that this is not unnatural since the price drop depends upon the Caesars Superdome’s ability to accommodate over 15,000 more fans, the availability of hotel rooms, and to some extent, fan fatigue.There are 74,295 seats and six levels in the Caesars Superdome. However, the two suite levels at the Superdome are privately owned and hence exclusive. 7 per cent of all tickets sold have been buyers from Kansas or Missouri, which is surprising since this is a big game for the Kansas City Chiefs.But Budelli shares, “They’ve seen their team win. It’s hard to justify spending $10,000, year after year, if you’ve already seen it.” Budelli told AP that some tickets are still available, but they are being sold quickly.Also Read: What is Super Bowl and why is everyone googling it? “Compared to last year, which was the most expensive Super Bowl in history on StubHub, that’s actually down 56%, making this Super Bowl much more approachable — I don’t want to say affordable — when compared to last year,” Budelli said.As per Ticketmaster, historically, the average resale ticket to the Super Bowl has ranged between $4,000 and $6,000; the platform has also pointed out that the ticket price “fluctuates drastically” based on the game's location, the lineup, seat location, and date of purchase.Budelli also pointed out that the venue for last year’s Super Bowl was a big reason for the inflated prices of its tickets. Last year, the game was held in Las Vegas and the three-hour game was turned into a week full of festivities for attending fans which hiked up the prices. Budelli shared that this year’s ticket prices are more in line with the 2023 rates.We’ve seen a 14% increase in ticket purchases from Kansas City Chiefs fans. Now, the gap is around 15% from Pennsylvania and about 9% from Kansas and Missouri. While it still favours the Eagles, the numbers may improve for Chiefs fans as the weekend progresses,"" he added.Typically Super Bowl tickets get cheaper from two weeks out, reaching their lowest price on game day. In 2024, Gametime's cheapest Super Bowl ticket declined from $9,400 two weeks out to $7,100 the day of the game, which marks a 24% drop.","Stubhub reported this week that the ""get in"" price was $3,229 which is 5 per cent lower than the previous day.

Jon Batiste’s Musical Journey: From Street Performances to Grammy Wins



Super Bowl LIX: What to Expect



If there’s one thing we can all agree on, it’s that the Super Bowl isn’t just about football—it’s about the spectacle, the halftime show, and of course, that iconic national anthem moment. And this year, none other than the multi-talented Jon Batiste will be delivering the “Star-Spangled Banner” before the big game kicks off.Born into the legendary Batiste family in Metairie, Louisiana, Jon Batiste has been breathing music since day one. He started on drums, but by 11, the piano had stolen his heart. He trained at the New Orleans Center for Creative Arts and later polished his skills at Juilliard in New York. From street performances (he calls them ""love riots"") to global tours, this man has lived and breathed music across more than 40 countries.If you don't know Batiste from his viral street performances, you probably recognize him as the former bandleader on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. But that's just one piece of his insane career. Now let's talk about the hardware: an Academy Award for his work on Disney/Pixar's Soul , a Golden Globe, a BAFTA, a Critics' Choice Award, and oh, just five Grammy wins in one night for his album WE ARE—including Album of the Year in 2022!Batiste's musical fingerprints are everywhere. He's worked with Stevie Wonder, Prince, Willie Nelson, Lenny Kravitz, and Ed Sheeran—to name a few. He's also the Creative Director of the National Jazz Museum in Harlem and the Music Director for The Atlantic. Basically, if it involves music and culture, Batiste has probably had a hand in it.Batiste isn’t just singing the national anthem; he’s bringing soul, jazz, and a whole lot of energy to the Super Bowl stage. Expect a rendition that’s powerful, heartfelt, and uniquely Batiste. If his past performances are anything to go by, we might even see a surprise twist or two.So as the players prepare for a battle of glory in the Super Bowl, Jon Batiste is going to be the one that sets the tone for this upcoming legendary performance. Whether this is your game or you're just here for the music, one thing is for sure—the moment when Batiste comes on will not soon be forgotten.Also read - “She’s a Trump Fan!” – Donald Trump Predicts Chiefs Will Win Super Bowl, Praises Patrick Mahomes’ Wife","Jon batiste will sing the national anthem at super bowl lix.

The Super Bowl is bringing all the drama this year. The Kansas City Chiefs face off against the Philadelphia Eagles on February 9, and while fans are hyped about Kendrick Lamar and SZA at halftime, a pre-game performance is sparking serious debate. Grammy winner Ledisi will singthe Black national anthem . Yeah, the same anthem that’s got half of Twitter raging and some NFL fans screaming ""boycott.""This isn’t some random new anthem.was written by James Weldon Johnson in 1899, originally as a poem for Abraham Lincoln’s birthday. His brother, John Rosamond Johnson, composed the music. It was first performed by 500 Black students at a segregated school. By 1919, the NAACP made it their official song, cementing it as a key part of Black cultural identity.Fast forward to 2020—after the killing of George Floyd and the protests that followed, the NFL added the anthem to pre-game ceremonies toCue immediate backlash.For a lot of conservatives, the whole idea of a separate anthem doesn’t sit well. Megyn Kelly fired off last year, saying,But here’s the kicker. For many,is about visibility. Democratic congressman Ritchie Torres summed it up:The NFL is finally acknowledging its messy racial past—something it was forced to confront after Colin Kaepernick’s protests in 2016 shook the league.Ledisi Anibade Young isn’t new to controversy—or greatness. Born in New Orleans and raised in Oakland, she’s been killing it for over 20 years with R&B, gospel, and jazz hits. She’s got Grammy wins and nominations to back it up too. This year, she’ll take center stage withjoining Jon Batiste, who’s handling the national anthem, and Lauren Daigle with Trombone Shorty, singingDespite Ledisi's talent, not everyone is here for it. Social media is already buzzing with outrage. Comments likeare everywhere. Some fans still haven’t forgiven the NFL for taking a stance on race post-George Floyd.This is about more than a song. It’s about the NFL’s ongoing racial reckoning. After sidelining Kaepernick and ignoring police brutality, they can’t just sweep things under the rug anymore. The performance ofsends a message: Black history and voices won’t be erased. Whether fans like it or not, it’s happening.At 52, Ledisi continues to shine in her musical journey. She released her debut album,in 2000 and has since produced 11 studio albums. Her latest,was released just last year. In 2024, she was honored with an honorary doctorate from the prestigious Berklee College of Music.Throughout her career, Ledisi has earned notable accolades, including a Grammy Award in 2021 for Best Traditional R&B Performance with her rendition offrom the 2020 albumShe has also claimed two Soul Train Music Awards.If you can handle the off-field drama, here’s where to catch the game:Super Bowl 59 is setting up to be one hell of a showdown. Will Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs make history by becoming the first team to win three consecutive titles? Or will Jalen Hurts and the Philadelphia Eagles finally take revenge for their 2023 defeat? Either way, expect fireworks—on and off the field.","The kansas city chiefs face off against the philadelphia eagles on february 9. Grammy winner ledisi will sing the black national anthem.

With Super Bowl LIX on the horizon, one big question looms over Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce—will this be his final game? While Kelce hasn’t made an official decision, there’s plenty of speculation about whether he’ll hang up his cleats after the season or return for another year.Kelce signed a two-year contract extension in 2024, keeping him with the Chiefs through 2025. However, that doesn’t necessarily mean he’ll play another season. His $19.8 million cap hit in 2025 could impact the Chiefs’ roster decisions, and Kelce himself has admitted he’ll need time after the Super Bowl to think about his future before free agency begins on March 12.Several factors could determine whether Kelce retires or returns:If Kelce does retire, he has plenty of opportunities outside the NFL. He’s already a media superstar with his hit podcast,, and he could easily transition into TV, acting, or even sports broadcasting. Plus, with his high-profile relationship with Taylor Swift, he might enjoy having more free time to travel and support her career.For now, Travis Kelce’s future remains uncertain, but NFL insiders believe his decision will “hinge” on the Super Bowl’s outcome. Whether he’s back for one more season or calling it quits, all eyes will be on Kelce as the Chiefs take the field for Super Bowl LIX!Also read - “I wouldn’t give a s**t” – DJ Mustard Shuts Down Super Bowl Halftime Show Rumors, Won’t Perform with Kendrick Lamar","Travis kelce hasn’t made an official decision, but there’s plenty of speculation about whether he’ll hang up his cleats after the season or return for another year.
