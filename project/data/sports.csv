Remembering Gianna Bryant: A tribute to her legacy amid defaced murals and tough times



On Thursday, May 1, 2025, Vanessa Bryant marked what would have been her daughter Gianna “Gigi” Bryant’s 19th birthday with a touching Instagram post that resonated far beyond social media. Accompanied by a powerful image of Gigi in her basketball uniform, the post was a raw and emotional tribute from a mother who continues to carry the weight of an unimaginable loss. The moment was made even more emotional as it came just days after a beloved mural of Gigi and her father, Kobe Bryant, was vandalized in Los Angeles.From Los Angeles to global basketball circles, the name Gianna Bryant , known affectionately as “Gigi” and “Mambacita,” still echoes with deep meaning. On Thursday morning, Vanessa Bryant shared a birthday message on Instagram that read, “Happy birthday, Gigi! Mommy loves and misses you more than I could ever express. I love you Gianna. ❤️19 ♉️ 5/1 #Mambacita.” It was a simple yet deeply moving tribute that quickly garnered love and support from fans, athletes, and brands across the sports world.Gigi, the daughter of NBA legend Kobe Bryant , was just 13 when she and her father tragically died in a helicopter crash on January 26, 2020, along with seven others.Nicknamed “Mambacita,” Gigi was seen as the heir to Kobe’s legacy. He even trademarked the name for her in December 2019, recognizing her growing talent and fierce passion for basketball. She embodied the same Mamba Mentality that her father was known for—relentless, fearless, and unapologetically determined with a drive well beyond her age.Over the years, more than 330 murals have popped up across California honoring Kobe and Gigi. But just days before Gigi’s birthday, one of the most beloved murals in L.A., a portrait of the father and daughter, was defaced with black paint. The timing hit hard. It rattled fans and added even more emotional weight to a week that was already tough for Vanessa, who also has a birthday coming up on May 5.To honor Gigi, Nike released a special edition “Mambacita” Kobe 9 sneaker on May 1, designed in partnership with the Bryant family. Inspired by Gigi’s drive and spirit, the shoe represents her commitment to excellence and her dream to elevate girls’ sports.Through the Mamba & Mambacita Sports Foundation, Vanessa continues to champion those values, investing in youth athletics and pushing for gender equality in sports.Also Read: ‘Kobe' Chant: How a comedic skit sparked a global tradition and a classroom tribute that moved Vanessa Bryant May 1 will always be more than just a date for Vanessa Bryant; it’s a reminder of her daughter’s spirit, her dreams, and the powerful impact she left behind.

Rodgers, Steelers, and the rising storm in Pittsburgh



Aaron Rodgers Leaves Door Open To Playing, Seemingly With Steelers, Or Potentially Retiring

“All signs would lead you to believe they’re going to get Aaron Rodgers.”

The NFL rumor mill is heating up, and this time, it’s hard to ignore. Aaron Rodgers may be heading to the Pittsburgh Steelers , and the impact could be huge. With training camp approaching and no clear QB in sight, the idea of Rodgers in black and gold is looking more likely. This move feels less like a stretch and more like a natural next step in his career.Aaron Rodgers returning to the spotlight in Pittsburgh isn't just about filling a quarterback vacancy, it’s a statement. The Steelers , after bypassing a top-tier QB in the NFL Draft and sticking with volatile talent like George Pickens, appear to be setting the table for a win-now push. Mike DeFabo of The Athletic fueled the fire, stating,That comment has lit up sports radio, social media, and fan forums, sparking one of the offseason’s most polarizing debates.On paper, the match is hard to ignore. The Steelers boast a playoff-ready defense, a bruising run game, and a wide receiver corps desperate for a leader. Rodgers, even at 40, brings elite IQ, poise, and the kind of swagger the Steelers haven’t seen since Big Ben’s prime.But this isn’t just about football. It’s about culture and control. Rodgers has never been one to bite his tongue, and Pittsburgh isn’t exactly known for coddling egos. Add in George Pickens, who’s made it clear he won’t settle for mediocrity at quarterback, and you’ve got a potentially combustible locker room. If Rodgers joins, it's not just his arm the Steelers will be banking on, it's his ability to unify a team that’s one bad day from imploding.Also Read: Travis Kelce predicts Josh Simmons will be future Hall of Famer, strengthening Chiefs' legacy with Patrick Mahomes and Andy Reid Critics argue the move reeks of desperation, a band-aid over a long-term issue. Supporters believe Rodgers could be the catalyst for one last Super Bowl run. Either way, the NFL landscape is watching closely. Because if the Steelers take a chance on Rodgers, the fallout be it good or bad will be impossible to ignore.","Aaron rodgers could be the key to steelers' success.

Gregg Popovich steps down as Spurs head coach after 29 seasons to take over front office role,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/gregg-popovich-steps-down-as-spurs-head-coach-after-29-seasons-to-take-over-front-office-role/articleshow/120832177.cms,"Image via Getty Images

Gregg Popovich’s legacy: 5 championships and the dynasty he built in San Antonio

Gregg Popovich’s departure: The end of an era and what’s next for the San Antonio Spurs

Gregg Popovich , the longest tenured and winningest coach in NBA history, is officially stepping down as the head coach of the San Antonio Spurs . After nearly three decades on the sidelines, the 76-year-old will now fully focus on his role as the team’s President of Basketball Operations , the Spurs confirmed on Friday, May 2. His decision follows recent health setbacks, including a mild stroke in November 2024 and a medical scare in April. Gregg Popovich ’s career is nothing short of historic. Since taking over as head coach during the 1996–97 season, he has racked up 1,422 regular-season wins, the most in NBA history, and led the Spurs to five NBA championships . His title-winning seasons came in 1999, 2003, 2005, 2007, and 2014, a stretch that turned the Spurs into a model franchise and dynasty.He helped shape the careers of legends like Tim Duncan , David Robinson, Tony Parker, Manu Ginóbili, and Kawhi Leonard . Popovich also coached Team USA to gold at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and is a three-time NBA Coach of the Year , tied for the most ever alongside Pat Riley and Don Nelson.Although he signed a five-year extension with the Spurs in 2023, health challenges shifted his plans. Popovich suffered a stroke on November 2, 2024, and did not return to the bench for the remainder of the season. During his recovery, assistant coach Mitch Johnson took over and led the team to a 31–45 finish.Popovich remained involved behind the scenes throughout the year, and in recent weeks, he had been seen around the team’s facilities. However, the rigors of coaching proved too demanding to return.“While my love and passion for the game remain, I’ve decided it’s time to step away as head coach,” Popovich said in a statement on Friday. “I’m forever grateful to the wonderful players, coaches, staff and fans who allowed me to serve them as the Spurs head coach and am excited for the opportunity to continue to support the organization, community and city that are so meaningful to me.”Popovich’s coaching journey began with the Spurs as an assistant under Larry Brown in 1988 before returning in 1994 as general manager. In 1996, he appointed himself head coach midseason and soon helped engineer a historic turnaround that led to 22 consecutive playoff appearances between 1998 and 2019.His departure marked a change of guard in the NBA. With Popovich stepping down, Erik Spoelstra of the Miami Heat, head coach since 2008, becomes the league’s longest tenured active coach.Also Read: Gregg Popovich health update: Fan favorite San Antonio Spurs coach suffers scare in restaurant Though he won’t be on the sidelines, Popovich remains deeply woven into the Spurs’ future.

Skylar Diggins clarified her name to the media



Seattle Storm point guard Skylar Diggins has officially dropped her husband's name “Smith” from hers whom she married in 2017, choosing to be publicly known simply as Skylar Diggins moving forward. The WNBA player confirms the change during the team’s media day ahead of the 2025 season, putting an end to the speculations that have been swirling online in recent weeks after the fans began noticing the change in her social media handles.Diggins, who rose to national visibility during her college years at Notre Dame, has long been one of the most recognizable faces in women’s basketball. She tied the knot with former Fighting Irish footballer Daniel Smith in April 2017, the couple has two children together and managed to maintain a relatively private life.Skylar Diggins recently changed her social media handles, removing “Smith” from her name, causing speculations of a drift in the relationship. When asked directly about the change, Diggins responded confidently and with a smile, while making it clear that the decision was hers and hers alone. “Yes. Thank you for the question, too, yes, it does say Skylar Diggins, and I would like to be addressed as that moving forward,” she said.While Diggins hasn’t officially offered a detailed explanation for the change, fans were quick to notice that she had not only updated her social media handles and bio but also removed several photos with her husband, Daniel Smith. The move led to plenty of speculation, but no official word about her personal life has been shared.Beyond the headlines about her name, Diggins looked genuinely excited about the upcoming season. The Storm have undergone some major transformations, including the trade of longtime after Jewell Loyd. In return, Seattle secured the No.2 overall pick in the 2025 draft, adding future potential to the team.Diggins mentioned,” This is definitely the most talented roster I’ve been a part of in my 13 years, 11 on the floor,” adding, “Everybody looks really good, the vibes have been really good.”Skylar Diggins enters the 2025 WNBA season ready to turn the page and lead by example both on and off the court.Also Read: “You make us proud” — Giannis Antetokounmpo’s wife Mariah Antetokounmpo poured heartfelt tribute after Milwaukee Bucks’ series loss",Seattle storm point guard skylar diggins has officially dropped her husband's name “smith” from hers.

What Mike Sullivan’s firing really means for Sidney Crosby’s future in Pittsburgh Penguins,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/what-mike-sullivans-firing-really-means-for-sidney-crosbys-future-in-pittsburgh-penguins/articleshow/120831787.cms,"Photo by Joe Sargent/Getty Images

Mike Sullivan’s firing puts spotlight on Sidney Crosby’s future with the Pittsburgh Penguins

why

Mike Sullivan getting the boot wasn’t the biggest surprise of the Penguins’ offseason. But what might it lead to? That’s the real story. It’s not about just swapping out a coach. It’s about how that decision hits the guy who's been the face of the franchise for nearly 20 years Sidney Crosby . The bond between coach and captain ran deep. And while Crosby isn’t the type to make a fuss, you have to wonder: could this be the moment he starts questioning how much longer he wants to ride this out in Pittsburgh?At Monday’s press conference, Kyle Dubas stood in front of reporters trying to explain why he chose to cut ties with the most successful coach in Pittsburgh Penguins history. But as things were winding down, someone asked the question that really mattered: was he worried that this move might push Crosby to consider leaving?“No,” Dubas replied, short and sharp, a rare one-word answer from a guy who usually speaks in paragraphs.Dubas did say he called Crosby on Sunday to give him a heads-up. “In terms of how he feels about it, I had a five-minute conversation with him before about the fact that we were going to make a change, and we didn’t get into the ins and outs of it,” he explained. “I have to do what I think is best for the organization.” He wouldn’t share any more than that. “I’m not going to speak for Sid.”Crosby hasn’t said much publicly either — just a short statement to NHL Network, where he thanked Sullivan for his “preparation and commitment to winning,” and said the coach pushed him every day for a decade.And here’s the thing: this might not be about Sullivan, exactly. It’s abouthe’s gone. Rumor is, Sullivan and Dubas weren’t seeing eye to eye on the team’s future. Sullivan wanted to keep pushing. Dubas? He’s talking about “transition” and how just making the playoffs next year would be “a tremendous accomplishment.”That’s not the kind of timeline you pitch to a 37-year-old Hall of Famer who’s still playing at an elite level.Last month, Crosby spoke openly about how much the losing has worn on him. Watching longtime teammates get traded, seeing the team fade out of the playoff picture again — it’s been a grind. Dubas admitted as much, saying, “Until we are back contending to win the Stanley Cup, I expect him to be grumpy.”Dubas says the plan is to build around Crosby, bringing in young players who can grow into a new core. “Him helping them and them helping him is really what the focus is,” he said.But that only works if those timelines actually sync up.Crosby’s loyalty has never been in question. He signed an extension. He’s never asked out. He brushed off trade rumors and stayed laser-focused when others were looking for the exits. But you can only run uphill for so long before you start asking where the top is — or if you’re even still climbing.If Crosby ever does start to consider playing somewhere else, we might look back on the day Mike Sullivan was fired not just as the end of a coaching era — but as the first step toward something nobody in Pittsburgh really wants to think about.Also Read: Los Angeles Kings vs. Edmonton Oilers: Key stats and breakdown for round 1",Sidney crosby has been the face of the pittsburgh penguins for nearly 20 years.

Knicks survive, avoid potential implosion





Jalen Brunson ’s game-winning three-pointer with 4.3 seconds left didn’t just secure a 116-113 victory over the Detroit Pistons—it may have saved the New York Knicks from an offseason of chaos. The shot, which sealed the first-round playoff series in six games, could go down as one of the most consequential moments in recent Knicks history.With the Knicks barely surviving a grueling series against a relentless Pistons squad, Brunson’s heroics ensured the team avoided a do-or-die Game 7. Instead, they now prepare for a second-round showdown against the defending champion Boston Celtics .Jalen Brunson’s 40-point performance was capped by a cold-blooded three over Ausar Thompson, reinforcing why he was named the NBA’s Clutch Player of the Year. But beyond the box score, the shot carried immense weight:- Saved jobs – A first-round exit could have triggered major changes, from coaching staff to front-office decisions.- Avoided disaster – A Game 7 loss to the underdog Pistons would have been catastrophic for a team with championship aspirations.- Extended the season – The Knicks now have another chance to prove themselves against the Celtics.Had Brunson missed, the narrative would be entirely different. The Pistons, who pushed the Knicks to the brink in four games decided by three points or fewer, could have forced a decisive Game 7 at Madison Square Garden.New York now shifts focus to Boston, a team that dominated them in the regular season. The Celtics swept all four matchups, with three of those wins coming in convincing fashion.- Boston’s dominance – The Celtics are the defending champions and present a far tougher challenge than Detroit.- Health concerns – The Knicks are battered and bruised after a physical series.- Pressure to perform – Another underwhelming playoff run could still lead to changes, but Brunson’s shot bought them time.Coach Tom Thibodeau summed it up best: ""He’s at his best when his best is needed."" Brunson’s clutch gene has kept the Knicks alive—for now.History shows how a single shot can redefine a franchise:Brunson’s shot didn’t just win a game—it may have preserved the Knicks’ current era.

Gujarat Titans aim to recover from the blow dealt by young sensation Vaibhav Suryavanshi when they face a struggling Sunrisers Hyderabad in an IPL match tonight (May 2).Suryavanshi stunned GT with his incredible performance, hitting the season’s fastest century in just 35 balls and becoming the youngest IPL centurion at only 14 years and 32 days old.Despite an eight-wicket loss — post a strong 209/4 score — the result hasn't altered GT's position in the league. The Titans remain one of the most consistent teams this season, boasting a balanced squad with strengths in both batting and bowling.Led by Shubman Gill, they sit comfortably with six wins out of nine matches (12 points). Just two more wins from their last five fixtures would secure a spot in the playoffs, reaching the 16-point threshold.GT's in-form top order gives them confidence, especially with standout Sai Sudharsan, who is second in the Orange Cap race with 456 runs and five fifties. Gill (389 runs) and Jos Buttler (406 runs) also rank among the season’s top batters, making a formidable trio despite recent challenges.Earlier this season, GT defeated SRH convincingly in Hyderabad by seven wickets, thanks largely to Mohammed Siraj's impressive 4/17 spell. They’ll be hoping for a similar performance this time.Meanwhile, SRH find themselves in a critical position, needing wins urgently. The runners-up last season have struggled — just three wins in nine matches — and sit ninth on the points table. Another loss could effectively eliminate their playoff hopes.While SRH have seen flashes of brilliance from openers Abhishek Sharma and Travis Head, consistency remains elusive for the team.The pitch at Narendra Modi Stadium favours the batters, which should benefit SRH. In five of the eight matches played at Motera, teams have scored over 200 runs, highlighting the batting-friendly conditions. Bowlers are likely to struggle, particularly in the second innings, as dew is expected to make an impact.Shubman Gill (C), Sai Sudharsan, Jos Buttler (WK), Sherfane Rutherford, Shahrukh Khan, Washington Sundar, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, Sai Kishore, Mohammed Siraj, Prasidh KrishnaImpact sub: Karim Janat/Ishant SharmaTravis Head, Abhishek Sharma, Ishan Kishan, Nitish Kumar Reddy, Heinrich Klaasen (WK), Aniket Verma, Kamindu Mendis, Pat Cummins (C), Harshal Patel, Simarjeet Singh, Zeeshan AnsariImpact sub: Mohammed ShamiGujarat Titans squad : Shubman Gill (Captain), Jos Buttler (wk), B Sai Sudharsan, Shahrukh Khan, Sherfane Rutherford, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, Kagiso Rabada, Ravisrinivasan Sai Kishore, Mohammad Siraj, Prasidh Krishna, Ishant Sharma, Washington Sundar, Glenn Phillips, Anuj Rawat, Mahipal Lomror, Arshad Khan, Jayant Yadav, Nishant Sindhu, Kulwant Khejroliya, Gerald Coetzee, Manav Suthar, Kumar Kushagra, Gurnoor Brar and Karim Janat.Sunrisers Hyderabad squad : Pat Cummins (c), Ishan Kishan (wk), Atharva Taide, Abhinav Manohar, Aniket Verma, Sachin Baby, Smaran Ravichandran, Heinrich Klaasen (wk), Travis Head, Harshal Patel, Kamindu Mendis, Wiaan Mulder, Abhishek Sharma, Nitish Kumar Reddy, Mohammed Shami, Rahul Chahar, Simarjeet Singh, Zeeshan Ansari, Jaydev Unadkat, Eshan Malinga.In Ahmedabad on Friday, temperatures are expected to be quite hot, reaching up to 44°C during the day.

Astrologer Greenstone Lobo: Is Yuzvendra Chahal's India career over?

NEW DELHI: Vaibhav Suryavanshi lit up IPL 2025 with a sensational century against Gujarat Titans , turning heads across the cricketing world. The 14-year-old southpaw set the Sawai Mansingh Stadium in Jaipur alight with his explosive strokeplay in a high-scoring thriller that saw Rajasthan Royals chase down a daunting 210-run target with ease, clinching an eight-wicket victory. Just days after his record-breaking feat, Suryavanshi faced a harsh lesson in the game’s unpredictability, falling for a two-ball duck against Mumbai Indians at the same venue on Thursday.With Rajasthan Royals now out of the playoff race and gearing up to face Kolkata Knight Riders on Sunday, Suryavanshi was spotted sharing a light-hearted moment with teammate Nitish Rana In the video, Rana can be heard saying:“Main 5 bat deta hoon tujhe. Agar uska count 14 se upar gaya na…” (I’ll give you 5 bats, but if the total goes above 14...)Suryavanshi counters:“Mujhe ek hi chahiye, baat yeh hai... Mere age se zyada bats hue toh main apna bat usko de dunga jisko tum bologe.” (I only need one. The point is... if the number of bats exceeds my age, I’ll give my bat to whoever you say.)Rana retorts:“Mera bat hai, meri marzi – main kyun doon?” (It’s my bat, my choice – why should I give it?)Rana adds with a grin:“Tere paas 10 bat hain? 10 bat toh bohot hote hain, itne toh Virat bhai ke paas bhi nahi hote!” (You have 10 bats? That’s a lot! Even Virat bhai doesn’t have that many!)Cricket icon Kapil Dev also weighed in on the young star’s meteoric rise, underlining the need for patience in his development.""Give him time, don't rush it. He is a good talent and has good ability. But you need to give time to players,"" said the 1983 World Cup-winning captain, acknowledging the teenager’s promising skills.Suryavanshi orchestrated Rajasthan’s stunning chase, dismantling a Gujarat bowling lineup that boasted a combined 694 international caps. His 35-ball century — the fastest by an Indian in IPL history — is second only to Chris Gayle’s 30-ball ton in 2013.At just 14 years and 32 days, he became the youngest player ever to score a T20 century.

Harshal Patel sprinted in, collected the ball swiftly, and fired a flat throw towards the striker’s end.Wicketkeeper Heinrich Klaasen , stationed in front of the stumps, attempted to deflect the ball onto the stumps with his gloves.The dismissal looked extremely tight and was sent upstairs for review.The third umpire checked whether the stumps had been broken by Klaasen’s gloves or the ball. After several replays and angles, the umpire concluded that the ball had hit the stumps, citing a visible deviation after contact with the gloves as evidence.Gill appeared stunned and visibly furious with the decision but had no choice but to walk back to the pavilion. He later had an exchange with TV umpire Michael Gough after returning to the dugout.Despite the dismissal, Gill played a sensational knock, scoring 76 off just 38 balls.Earlier, Sunrisers Hyderabad skipper Pat Cummins won the toss and elected to bowl.

Astrologer Greenstone Lobo: Is Yuzvendra Chahal's India career over?

NEW DELHI: India and Royal Challengers Bengaluru star batter Virat Kohli has finally opened up about his decision to retire from T20 internationals following India’s triumphant T20 World Cup campaign in 2024.Kohli called time on his T20I career after India, led by Rohit Sharma , clinched the T20 World Cup title with a thrilling seven-run win over South Africa in the final held in Barbados.In the high-octane final, Kohli delivered when it mattered the most, scoring a crucial 76 off 59 balls, earning him the Player of the Match award.Moments after lifting the trophy, Kohli announced his retirement from T20Is during the post-match presentation. Soon after, Rohit Sharma and Ravindra Jadeja also confirmed their retirements from the format.Speaking on the RCB Podcast, Kohli explained the reasoning behind his decision.“I do not think things have changed for me in any way. The decision to leave T20Is was taken purely understanding that there is a new set of players who are more than ready and they need time,” he said.“They need a two-year cycle to evolve, handle pressure, play in different parts of the world, and play enough games to the point where when the World Cup comes, they feel like they are ready.”Kohli finished his T20I career with 125 matches, amassing 4,188 runs at an impressive average of 48.69. He was named Player of the Tournament in both the 2014 and 2016 editions of the T20 World Cup.Currently, Kohli is showcasing top form in the ongoing IPL 2025 , leading the charts for RCB with 443 runs in 10 matches at an average of 63.29.RCB, placed second in the points table, are set to face Chennai Super Kings in a key encounter on Saturday.",Virat kohli has announced his retirement from t20 internationals.

Sachin Tendulkar at 52: Power, Pride, and a Nation’s Pulse

NEW DELHI: Kolkata Knight Riders captain Ajinkya Rahane has reaffirmed his unwavering determination to return to the Indian team, saying he still harbours the “desire and hunger” to represent the country again. The 36-year-old last featured in a Test match in 2023 and has been out of India’s white-ball plans for nearly a decade, but his focus remains clear.""I would love to be back in the Indian set-up again. The desire, the hunger, the fire is still there. Fitness-wise, I am right up there. I just want to take one game at a time, thinking about this IPL right now, and then, let's see what happens in the future,"" Rahane said during Star Sports’ Press Room interaction on Friday.""I am a guy who will never give up. (I) always try and give my best on the field; give more than 100 per cent. It's always about that, focusing on controllable things. I have been playing domestic cricket as well and I am really enjoying my cricket at this moment,"" he added.Rahane’s most celebrated chapter in Indian colours came during the 2020–21 Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Australia, where he led an injury-depleted side to a historic 2-1 Test series win. Despite that high, he soon found himself sidelined as younger talent emerged and took centre stage.""Every day when I wake up, it's always about what goals I want to achieve. For me, there is nothing higher than representing your country,"" he reiterated.""I want to represent my country. I want to wear those Indian colours again. During (the) off-season, I train for two-three sessions a day. I feel at this moment, for me, keeping myself really fit is really important, recovery is really important,"" he said.""(I am) focusing on my diet as well...the motivation to do well for India, it's still there. I am enjoying my cricket, that is the important thing. I am still passionate. I still love the game.""As the conversation shifted towards IPL 2025 and KKR’s campaign, Rahane expressed full support for out-of-form vice-captain Venkatesh Iyer , who has struggled for consistency. With the defending champions needing to win all four of their remaining games to stay in playoff contention, pressure is mounting.Iyer, the franchise’s costliest buy at Rs 23.75 crore, has only managed scores of 60 and 45 of note this season. In the last four games, he has accumulated just 28 runs. But Rahane is backing his deputy to bounce back.""Every player goes through that phase where he is trying his best but the performance is not coming. He is a quality player. We all know that he has done well for the franchisee in the past, (he has) won the matches for the team as well,"" he said.""It's important from management (and) leadership group point of view (that) we back him. He has been working really hard. People generally only see about the results and the outcome. But the hard work which all the players are doing, that is really important.""""From my point of view, we are completely backing Venkatesh Iyer. He is just one innings away. You can probably see one good innings from him in next four games,"" he added.Rahane also admitted that the team’s opening combinations haven’t clicked consistently.""Sunil Narine has done well in the past for us. This year, we started with Quinny (Quinton de Kock). Quinny played a very good knock. But again, he couldn't capitalise on that. He is trying hard. He is trying his best. But now, we have to look at the positives rather than what is not working for us,"" he said.""Obviously, the errors (have) happened and that can happen in this format. You want your players to play with freedom, play sometimes with high-risk cricket, so we are bound to make errors.""""I don't like to pinpoint on any players or any particular number. Everyone has to contribute...It's not happening, yes. I accept that.""Looking ahead, Rahane emphasized the importance of focusing one match at a time, especially with upcoming games against Rajasthan Royals and Chennai Super Kings, both already eliminated from the playoff race.""When teams are out, they have got nothing to lose and they come with a different mindset to play the game. For us, it's important to go out there with the right mindset (and) right attitude on that particular day and give our best,"" he said.","Ajinkya rahane has reaffirmed his determination to return to the indian team.

Fans reacted to Giannis Antetokounmpo’s confrontation with Tyrese Haliburton’s father

The Indiana Pacers edged out a dramatic 119-118 overtime victory against the Milwaukee Bucks . While Tyrese Haliburton 's game-winning shot over Giannis Antetokounmpo lit up Gainbridge Fieldhouse, the postgame headlines were stolen by a courtside altercation between Giannis and Haliburton's father, John. Fans online are not happy with John’s move, as many are asking the NBA to ban him from the playoffs.Giannis Antetokounmpo was making his way off the court when John Haliburton approached him, waving a towel with his son's face on it and allegedly yelling, “This is what we do.” The bold move did not sit well with the two-time MVP, who interpreted the act as a blatant show of disrespect. Giannis responded, and the two ended up in a tense face-to-face standoff that required players and staff from both benches to intervene.Giannis later addressed the confrontation: “I believe in being humble in victory. That’s who I am,” he said in his postgame comments. “Some people will say when you win the game, you can talk s___ and say it’s a green light for you to be disrespectful. I disagree. I’ve won a championship, they haven’t.”The Bucks star added, “I feel like that’s very, very disrespectful.”Tyrese Haliburton didn’t shy away from the issue either. Addressing the incident in his postgame press conference, he took accountability for his father’s actions. “As far as the incident between Giannis and my pops, I had no idea until I got to the back and was shown the video. I don’t agree with what transpired... I don’t think that my pops was in the right at all there.”Fans online quickly shared their thoughts on the matter. Many demand a ban on John Haliburton from the NBA games as a form of punishment.“Better be banned for the rest of the playoffs for this dumb s*it,” one fan wrote on X.“Father should be banned for rest of playoffs,” another echoed the same.“Father a bad example of sportsmanship,” another wrote.“I’m glad i saw this angle cause Hali dad was deff in the wrong for taunting Giannis after a big loss like that,” another shared.“What a clown,” one fan condemned the action of John.“Why is he seeking out a 7 foot Greek god like that.

Bronny James has officially wrapped up his rollercoaster rookie season with the Los Angeles Lakers . It was filled with harsh criticism, emotional growth, and a rare historic moment that no other player in NBA history has experienced— sharing the court with his father, LeBron James . Recently, Bronny has shared his thoughts on his rookie year in the franchise.As the first-ever father-son duo in the NBA, Bronny and LeBron James made headlines the moment Bronny was drafted 55th overall. But the spotlight quickly turned into scrutiny. Many questioned if Bronny had earned his place or if his last name carried more weight than his game. His early performance with the Lakers didn’t help his case— he averaged just 2.3 points, 0.8 assists, and 0.7 rebounds over 27 NBA games, drawing widespread criticism from fans and analysts alike.“I was under a lot of pressure… it was getting to me a little bit,” Bronny admitted in a candid interview with FOX Sports. He later added, “Keeping my head down and working… Working is a distraction from everything. I love just coming into the gym and working and talking to my coaches and watching film.”But his time with the Lakers’ G League affiliate, South Bay, told a different story. There, he averaged an impressive 21.9 points, 5.2 rebounds, and 5.4 assists over 11 games.“That I belong… That’s all I’ve been trying to prove,” Bronny said.While the pressure of being LeBron James’ son weighs heavily, Bronny is determined to build his own legacy. LeBron, too, has acknowledged the challenge. He even said Bronny doesn’t need basketball financially, noting his son could easily join his business ventures instead. But Bronny is committed to doing things his way.One of the season’s most touching moments came when both father and son reflected on the opportunity to play together.“It’s a blessing,” Bronny said. “Being able to learn from him, not only as a player, but as a dad. It’s a different type of relationship.”LeBron echoed the sentiment. “Number one for sure. That’s easy,” he told FOX Sports. “To be able to play the game that I love and to be able to be along my son this whole year has been one of the most gratifying, satisfying journeys I’ve ever been on.”Bronny remains hopeful about his future. “Yeah, for sure,” he said when asked about the possibility of playing with his dad again. “It’s always a pleasure being around him… I want to take full advantage of it.”Also Read: “I’m just talmbout Pop” – Rapper Lil Wayne sends heartfelt message to Gregg Popovich after the legendary coach’s recent announcement As Bronny prepares for his second season and he is setting his goal to get more minutes in the games.
