What It Means for Atlanta

Thecould be preparing to make one of the biggest moves of the 2026 offseason, potentially acquiring. A trade for Skubal, whose projected market value hovers around $400 million, would form a dominant rotation trio alongside Chris Sale and Spencer Strider, instantly elevating the Braves’ World Series aspirations.Heading into 2026, Atlanta Braves’ front office - led by Alex Anthopoulos - is expected to focus heavily on both the bullpen and starting rotation. The bullpen remains the team’s most pressing concern after inconsistencies during key moments of the 2025 season.One key decision involves reliever Tyler Kinley, who emerged as one of the most reliable arms for the Atlanta Braves last year.“So far, he’s proved to be a steal. In 21 games pitched since coming to Atlanta, Kinley has a 0.41 ERA and a 0.73 WHIP over 22 innings of work. He’s averaging nearly a strikeout per inning as well. It was a low-risk gamble that brought high reward,” wrote SI’s Harrison Smajovits. (H/t: Sporting News)For just $6.5 million, the Braves have the opportunity to retain a quality late-inning option. If Kinley continues his impressive form, this decision could be one of the most cost-effective bullpen moves of the offseason.While bullpen reinforcements are vital, the Braves are reportedly eyeing a blockbuster trade for Tarik Skubal, one of MLB’s most dominant starting pitchers. Skubal has just one year of team control remaining, which could make him available if the Tigers look to maximize his trade value before free agency.HTHB’s Eric Cole highlighted the potential challenge and magnitude of the move: “Okay, this is the big one and also the toughest one to pull off. The Braves want starting pitching depth and there is a good chance that soon-to-be multiple Cy Young winning Tarik Skubal is available in the right trade.”Cole also suggested that a trade package similar to the one used to land Kyle Tucker last offseason could be a realistic starting point for negotiations.Here’s the revised and properly formatted table you asked for:While such a deal would come at a steep cost, the payoff could be enormous. Adding Skubal would immediately create one of the most fearsome pitching rotations in the league.If the Atlanta Braves were to acquire Skubal, their projected top three starters would be:1. Tarik Skubal – Cy Young contender, elite left-hander2. Chris Sale – Veteran ace with championship pedigree3. Spencer Strider – Strikeout machine and franchise cornerstoneAtlanta would be a nightmare for opposing hitters thanks to this trio's ideal combination of power, experience, and left-right balance.For General Manager Alex Anthopoulos, landing Tarik Skubal would be a career-defining move - one that could be remembered for years in Atlanta Braves history. It would not only reinforce the team’s championship window but also address the long-term stability of the rotation as veterans age.Also read: MLB trade rumors: New York Mets predicted to land $150 million Philadelphia Phillies star to bolster team and title chances As Eric Cole summarized, this would be “the toughest one to pull off,” but it’s exactly the kind of bold decision that could make the Atlanta Braves unstoppable in 2026 and beyond. If Anthopoulos pulls the trigger, this could be remembered as the defining trade that set the stage for another Braves dynasty.","The atlanta braves are reportedly eyeing a blockbuster trade for detroit tigers ace tarik skubal.

Smith's comment about thinking of Hailee Steinfeld while watching Josh Allen during a First Take segment sparked significant backlash. Despite his clarification that he was referring to her talent, viewers criticized the remark as inappropriate and a distraction from football analysis, highlighting the importance of professional boundaries in sports commentary.

Fans believe Stephen A. Smith crossed a professional boundary and they said so immediately

THERE'S SOMETHING MISSING for the Bills 🧐 Stephen A.'s thoughts ahead of Chiefs matchup | First Take

Meanwhile, Josh Allen continues to build his new era with Hailee Steinfeld

ESPN’s First Take rarely goes quiet but Thursday morning’s segment ahead of Week 9’s Bills vs Chiefs matchup became one of those moments where a single line from Stephen A. Smith completely hijacked the conversation. Viewers have gotten used to fiery debates between Smith, Shannon Sharpe and the rest of the table, but this time the noise wasn’t about red-zone numbers or defensive matchups.It centered around one sentence involving Hailee Steinfeld . Smith wasn’t breaking down Buffalo’s red-hot offense. He wasn’t comparing Allen to Mahomes. He openly admitted that when he watches the reigning MVP, “Everytime I see him, I'm thinking about his wife, Hailee Steinfeld.” The Internet didn’t just pause, fans unloaded.Yes, Stephen A. Smith clarified himself. He said it was about Hailee Steinfeld's talent, not attraction, “What an actress,” he insisted, praising her performance in ""Sinners"" and calling her “special.” But social media didn’t soften.Fans went straight to the comments, and their wording was brutal and unfiltered. One fan commented, “Thinking about someone wife is diabolical.”Another wrote, “Wild compliment of Allen's wife.” A third chimed in, “Every time you hear Josh Allen you think about his wife lmaoo yoo and then tried to qualify it bc her acting stop it.” A fourth commented, “The shout out to Josh Allen's wife was really weird.” A fifth wrote, “Hailee gotta sue at this point. ”This wasn’t the fun kind of NFL banter. Fans argued that even with context, the comment created a misalignment Smith was reducing an MVP segment into a punchline about his spouse.Allen proposed to Steinfeld in November 2024. They married this past March. She has been a consistent stadium-side presence this season and his box score doesn’t lie: 1,560 passing yards, 12 TDs, 261 rushing yards, 5 rushing TDs through seven games.Allen recently said, “Maybe that I am more than a football player,” explaining how marriage reset his perspective. Sports talk culture loves a viral moment, but this one wasn’t the kind Smith wanted.

“Those songs hit her hard”: Blake Lively reportedly crushed after hearing Taylor Swift’s new songs as Travis Kelce helps fuel album buzz,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/those-songs-hit-her-hard-blake-lively-reportedly-crushed-after-hearing-taylor-swifts-new-songs-as-travis-kelce-helps-fuel-album-buzz/articleshow/125015013.cms,"A reported rift between close friends Blake Lively and Taylor Swift is causing a stir, fueled by speculation surrounding Swift's new album. Fans are dissecting song titles and lyrics, believing they allude to Lively, intensifying rumors of a fallout. This alleged distance challenges the perception of Swift's seemingly unbreakable inner circle, raising concerns about professional repercussions for Lively.

The album rollout raises suspicion as fans attach meaning to specific tracks





Why this fracture hits different in celebrity culture





Hollywood friendships have always lived in a strange middle ground, they look unbreakable when cameras flash, yet they can shatter just as easily under the pressure of personal choices, creative control, and the public’s hunger to connect dots. That is why the reported rift between Blake Lively and Taylor Swift feels bigger than a typical celebrity cold patch.This isn’t a pair of distant acquaintances, this is a friendship that once looked bulletproof, from Swift becoming godmother to Lively’s children to their quiet but consistent show of support for each other during their heaviest career chapters. But since the release of Swift’s latest album The Life of a Showgirl, internet sleuthing and lyrics speculation has made their silent distance impossible to ignore.According to Radar Online, “Blake is devastated – this isn’t something she can easily move past.” And that is where things become more layered. The speculation is not rooted in coincidence, Swift herself personally revealed titles like Ruin the Friendship and CANCELLED! on fiancé Travis Kelce ’s New Heights podcast, which only intensified theories before a single track was heard.“Hearing those songs has hit her hard, and seeing people online convinced they’re about her just makes it even more painful,” the source added.Add to that, fans believe certain lines from “CANCELLED!” read like surgical references to Blake’s year tied to legal tension with Justin Baldoni. It doesn’t matter that Swift never names her, the public is convinced the arrows are labeled.This isn’t just about lyrics or an album cycle. This story is ripping at a cultural myth: that Swift’s inner circle is impenetrable. In a celebrity ecosystem where reputation is currency, Blake reportedly fears the professional splashback, because Swift’s silent distancing doesn’t stay silent for long.If this friendship is truly done, the end isn’t loud. It’s subtle, strategic, and eerily poetic.Also Read: Taylor Swift’s choreographer exposes her past struggles — from stage anxiety to finding confidence with Travis Kelce by her side","A reported rift between close friends blake lively and taylor swift is causing a stir, fueled by speculation surrounding swift's new album.

It was a reminder that baseball’s greatest moments often exist beyond box scores — in the small gestures that connect players and fans forever.

Leon Draisaitl and Connor McDavid look to spark Oilers’ comeback



The Edmonton Oilers’ 4-3 overtime loss to the New York Rangers didn’t sit well with Leon Draisaitl , who questioned a key officiating decision that shifted the momentum late in the game. The controversy erupted when Rangers forward Mika Zibanejad high-sticked Jack Roslovic, leaving him bleeding on the ice. Despite clear contact, officials awarded only a two-minute minor penalty, sparking debate over the call.With the game tied 3-3, the Oilers went on a short power play that carried into overtime, but they couldn’t convert. Moments later, the Rangers scored the game-winner, handing Edmonton another frustrating defeat. What should have been a four-minute double minor became one of the night’s biggest talking points and Draisaitl didn’t hold back when asked about it afterward.“No, not sure. It doesn’t make a lot of sense, but yeah, it is what it is,” Draisaitl said postgame, clearly unhappy with the officials’ explanation. His remarks echoed the feeling among Oilers fans, who believed the team was shortchanged in a pivotal moment. The decision not only cost Edmonton valuable time on the man advantage but also stalled their late-game momentum.Still, Draisaitl didn’t blame the referees entirely. He pointed out that turnovers and poor puck management were major factors in the loss.“Just not clean enough with the puck. Turnovers just kind of turned the game a little bit. So yeah, just have to clean that up,” he admitted.The Oilers have now dropped three of their last five games, slipping to fourth in the Pacific Division with a 5-4-3 record. Despite standout performances from Draisaitl and Connor McDavid, Edmonton’s inconsistency and missed chances continue to hurt them. With McDavid and Draisaitl carrying the offensive load, Edmonton’s playoff hopes hinge on tightening their defensive structure and improving special teams efficiency. As they prepare for upcoming Western Conference matchups, the Oilers will need more discipline, sharper execution, and better focus to turn close games into wins.The Oilers’ upcoming schedule offers little room for error, with back-to-back tests against tough Western Conference rivals. These matchups will serve as a true measure of Edmonton’s resilience after a string of frustrating results.A stronger defensive effort and improved puck management will be vital if the Oilers hope to reassert themselves as playoff contenders. With Connor McDavid and Leon Draisaitl leading the charge, Edmonton’s ability to generate consistent offense and limit costly turnovers could define their playoff push.

Given that this is the first game of a back-to-back series, caution will likely be a major factor in their choice.Ball has expressed frustration with his injury struggles but remains determined to return to full strength. His presence not only elevates the Hornets’ offensive rhythm but also boosts the team’s confidence and energy on the floor. Losing him, even temporarily, has proven costly for Charlotte in the past. The Hornets are currently dealing with several injury setbacks beyond Ball’s situation. Brandon Miller remains out with a shoulder injury, Josh Green is recovering from shoulder surgery, and Grant Williams is sidelined due to a knee issue. These absences have forced head coach Charles Lee to make creative lineup adjustments while leaning heavily on the team’s bench depth.If Ball is unable to play, Tre Mann is expected to step in as the starting point guard. The likely starting lineup could include Mann, Sion James, Kon Knueppel, Miles Bridges, and Ryan Kalkbrenner. Coach Lee has also praised Collin Sexton’s scoring ability off the bench, noting that his presence can help balance the offense and keep the Hornets competitive even without their star guard.LaMelo Ball’s status has major implications for the Hornets’ performance against the Timberwolves. His ability to control tempo, facilitate plays, and score efficiently makes him the team’s heartbeat. However, the fact that he hasn’t been ruled out entirely offers hope that he could suit up if he feels comfortable during warm-ups.As Charlotte continues to battle through an injury-heavy stretch, their adaptability and depth will be tested once again. Whether or not Ball plays tonight, the Hornets will need to rally together and find ways to compete against a tough Minnesota squad hungry for another win.Also read: Why is Anthony Edwards not playing tonight vs the Charlotte Hornets? Latest update on the Minnesota Timberwolves star guard’s injury report (November 1, 2025) In short, fans should prepare for a game-time decision on LaMelo Ball. While his participation remains uncertain, optimism persists that the Hornets’ young leader may make his return - provided his ankle allows it.","Lamelo ball is officially listed as questionable for tonight’s game against minnesota due to a right ankle impingement.

Indiana Pacers Hit Hard by Injuries

What to Expect Tonight from the Warriors vs Pacers Matchup

The stage is set at Gainbridge Fieldhouse as thein a regular-season clash on November 1, 2025. Both teams enter the matchup with vastly different circumstances - the Warriors riding high in the Western Conference standings, while the Pacers struggle to keep up amid a growing list of injuries. Despite these challenges, all eyes will be on, who continues to defy age and expectations with MVP-caliber performances night after night.This contest offers an intriguing contrast: one team powered by championship experience and another battling to stay competitive without its stars. The Warriors, led by head coach Steve Kerr, aim to capitalize on their momentum and the brilliance of Curry, while the Pacers hope to find answers in the face of adversity.Stephen Curry is confirmed to be playing tonight against the Indiana Pacers, providing a massive boost for Golden State Warriors. Despite key absences in the lineup, Curry remains the heart and soul of the team. The two-time MVP has been in exceptional form this season, averaging around 27 points per game while continuing to be the league’s premier perimeter threat. His leadership on and off the floor has been instrumental in keeping the Warriors among the top contenders in the Western Conference.The Warriors will be without two rotation players - Alex Toohey and De’Anthony Melton - both sidelined with knee injuries. Even with these setbacks, the team’s core remains solid. Veterans like Draymond Green continue to anchor the defense and provide playmaking stability, while rising star Jonathan Kuminga has stepped up to deliver impactful performances on both ends of the court. Head coach Steve Kerr has emphasized the importance of depth and adaptability, trusting Curry and the remaining rotation to maintain consistency and energy.On the other side, the Indiana Pacers are dealing with one of the toughest injury situations in the league. Their star guard Tyrese Haliburton has been ruled out for the entire season due to an Achilles injury, leaving a massive void in the team’s offense and playmaking. The Pacers’ bench is among the thinnest in the NBA, forcing younger players to shoulder increased responsibilities against an experienced and well-coached Warriors squad.With Stephen Curry healthy and active, the Warriors are favored to continue their strong start to the season. Fans can expect another masterclass from Curry, who will likely take charge of the offense and deliver his trademark shooting brilliance. For the Pacers, the focus will be on containing Curry and trying to generate scoring opportunities without their key contributors.Also read: Golden State Warriors vs Indiana Pacers regular season injury report (November 1, 2025): Projected lineups, who’s out, and what to expect This matchup carries high stakes — the Warriors are eager to extend their winning momentum, while the Pacers desperately seek to break their early-season losing streak.

“First Take”

Ryan Clark blasts Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry over Charlie Kirk statue plan at LSU

“the first dumb thing he said this week,”

“This is another situation of politicians poking their nose into things that they don’t know about,”

“You don’t know nothing about football,”

“Scott Woodward deserves to pick the next head coach and the governor should stay out of it.”

Ryan Clark, former NFL star and current ESPN analyst, wasted no time on Wednesday, October 30, 2025, in calling out Jeff Landry, governor of Louisiana, over two moves the governor made involving LSU Tigers athletics. First, Landry declared that athletic director Scott Woodward would not choose the next LSU football coach and that the governor would rather let Donald Trump pick the hire himself.Then, Jeff Landry publicly backed a plan to erect a statue on the LSU campus of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, a move Clark labelledandClark, a Louisiana native and former LSU and NFL player, spoke onabout both issues, making clear he believes the governor has overstepped his role.During the Wednesday edition of First Take, Clark turned his focus first on Landry’s statue proposal for Charlie Kirk at LSU’s campus.He argued that Kirk “doesn’t represent the people of Louisiana, doesn’t represent the players and the students at LSU, doesn’t represent the executives that work there.”Ryan Clark labelled that statement, the statue idea asadding that Landry’s second mistake was trying to block Scott Woodward from picking the next football coach.Jeff Landry’s suggestion came during an event at LSU, where he said he wouldRyan Clark said the plan felt like a political stunt rather than a meaningful tribute.Clark said.Beyond the statue idea, Clark addressed the football side. He referenced Landry’s comments that Scott Woodward would not pick the next head coach for LSU, which came after the Tigers fired Brian Kelly following their poor start to the 2025 season.Ryan Clark defended Woodward, noting the athletic director had overseen hires of coaches like Kim Mulkey (women’s basketball) and Jay Johnson (baseball), both national-championship winners.In his view, the governor’s mic-grab was less about football and more about public attention.Clark said.Also Read: Andrew Tate Becomes New Misfits Boxing CEO After Old KSI Tweet Leads To Explosive Company Takeover “There’s enough going on in the state of Louisiana that needs to be fixed for its constituents.

How Luka Doncic Impacts the Lakers’ Game Plan

The Challenge Ahead: Facing a Healthy Memphis Squad

Final Outlook: A Game-Time Decision That Could Define the Night

Theare set for an exciting NBA Cup showdown against the Memphis Grizzlies tonight, but all eyes are on one question - willfinally return to the lineup? With the Lakers eager to build momentum early in the season, Doncic’s availability could be the difference between victory and another test of depth for JJ Redick’s squad.Both the Lakers and the Grizzlies are off to competitive starts, and their clash in Memphis promises high-intensity basketball. For Los Angeles, having their superstar back could tip the scales, especially after a string of gritty performances without him. Fans across the league are eagerly refreshing injury updates as tip-off approaches, hoping to see Doncic’s name officially cleared to play.Luka Doncic, who has been out for the last three games, is officially listed as questionable for tonight’s October 31 contest against the Memphis Grizzlies . The Los Angeles Lakers star has been managing multiple injuries - a sprain in his left finger and a contusion to his lower left leg - both sustained during the Lakers’ 124-119 win over the Minnesota Timberwolves on October 24. Despite being visibly in pain, Doncic showcased his trademark toughness by finishing that game, even requiring on-court treatment for his left hand.Since then, the Lakers have taken a cautious approach with their new franchise cornerstone. The team upgraded Luka Doncic’s status to questionable, indicating he’s making progress but remains a game-time decision. Head coach JJ Redick recently noted that while Doncic is “very close to returning,” the staff will prioritize long-term health over rushing him back too soon.A return in the next couple of games appears highly likely, even if he sits out tonight.In Luka Doncic’s absence, the Los Angeles Lakers have managed to stay competitive, going 2-1 in their last three games. Austin Reaves, in particular, has stepped up as a surprising leader, shouldering the offensive load with composure and confidence. His playmaking and perimeter shooting have kept the Lakers’ offense fluid, while teammates like D’Angelo Russell and Rui Hachimura have provided valuable support on both ends of the court.JJ Redick’s system has emphasized ball movement and defense, helping the Lakers stay afloat without their primary scorer. However, there’s no denying the void left by Doncic’s all-around brilliance. His ability to create shots, orchestrate plays, and deliver in clutch moments remains irreplaceable, and his return could reignite the Lakers’ offensive rhythm.Before the injury setback, Luka Doncic was off to one of the most explosive starts of his career. Through his first two games, he averaged a staggering 46 points, 11.5 rebounds, and 8.5 assists - numbers that reflect his MVP-caliber influence. His combination of elite scoring and playmaking has transformed the Lakers’ offense, giving them a dynamic edge few teams can match.If Doncic suits up tonight, expect the Los Angeles Lakers to reestablish their inside-out attack, leveraging his pick-and-roll chemistry with Anthony Davis and his ability to collapse defenses to free up shooters. Conversely, if he remains out, the Lakers will rely heavily on Reaves and Russell to initiate plays while leaning on their defensive identity to keep the Grizzlies contained.The Memphis Grizzlies enter this contest with a 3-2 record and a mostly healthy lineup, posing a formidable challenge for the visiting Lakers. Their fast-paced, aggressive style - anchored by Ja Morant’s explosiveness and Jaren Jackson Jr.’s defensive versatility - makes them one of the toughest teams to beat at home. The Grizzlies’ balanced scoring and energetic bench could exploit any rust the Lakers show if Doncic sits out again.Still, Los Angeles has shown resilience and adaptability, finding ways to win even without their top star. With a deep roster and a motivated locker room, they remain capable of pulling off an upset - especially if Reaves and Davis can replicate their recent form.As of now, Luka Doncic’s participation remains uncertain. The Los Angeles Lakers have listed him as questionable, and his return will likely depend on how he responds during pregame warmups. Even if he doesn’t suit up tonight, fans can take solace in the fact that his comeback is imminent - possibly within the next couple of games.Whether or not Doncic plays, tonight’s matchup between the Los Angeles Lakers and Memphis Grizzlies promises intensity, emotion, and elite basketball. A healthy Doncic would give the Lakers a major boost, but even in his absence, the team has proven capable of grinding out wins through collective effort and strong leadership from its supporting cast.Also read: Los Angeles Lakers vs Memphis Grizzlies regular season injury report: Who's playing, who's out, and more (October 31, 2025) All eyes will be on FedExForum as tip-off approaches.

Timberwolves Struggling Without Their Leading Scorer - Anthony Edwards

Minnesota Timberwolves vs Charlotte Hornets Game Expectations (November 1, 2025)

Thewill once again take the court without their star player,, as they face the Charlotte Hornets on November 1, 2025. Edwards remains sidelined with a hamstring injury, an absence that continues to test Minnesota’s depth and resilience early in the season. His presence has been sorely missed, with the Timberwolves struggling to maintain consistency on both ends of the floor since his injury.Before going down, Anthony Edwards was in phenomenal form, averaging an impressive 36 points per game and emerging as one of the league’s top early MVP candidates. However, his momentum was abruptly halted after suffering a right hamstring strain during a matchup against the Indiana Pacers earlier in the season. The injury forced him to exit the game prematurely, and subsequent evaluations ruled him out for at least two weeks. The team expects him to be re-evaluated around November 9, with a potential return not anticipated before mid-November. The Timberwolves enter their second straight road game without Edwards, holding a 2-3 record. His absence has created a noticeable void in both scoring and playmaking. Head coach Chris Finch has emphasized that the team’s recent defensive lapses - particularly in perimeter rotations and closeouts - have been amplified without Anthony Edwards’ two-way impact.The Timberwolves have lost a series of close contests, revealing how crucial Edwards’ offensive efficiency and leadership are to the team’s success.Minnesota’s challenge tonight will be to find offensive balance while maintaining defensive discipline. Without Edwards’ isolation scoring and ability to generate shots in clutch moments, the team must rely on structured half-court sets and collective execution. Julius Randle and Donte DiVincenzo are active for this matchup and are expected to lead the charge, providing scoring options and veteran experience to stabilize the lineup.Despite Edwards’ absence, oddsmakers still list Minnesota as a -5.5 favorite heading into the game. This suggests confidence in the Timberwolves’ roster depth and ability to adapt under pressure. The matchup against Charlotte is expected to feature a high tempo, as the Hornets boast strong offensive numbers but remain inconsistent defensively. Minnesota may look to exploit those weaknesses through transition play and inside scoring, areas where Randle and DiVincenzo could play pivotal roles.The Timberwolves continue to monitor Anthony Edwards’ recovery closely, with evaluations ongoing and medical staff cautious about rushing him back too soon. His hiatus represents a major challenge for a team built around his dynamic scoring ability and leadership. As Minnesota navigates the early season without their young superstar, the priority will be maintaining competitiveness and defensive integrity until Edwards returns.Also read: Is LaMelo Ball playing tonight vs the Minnesota Timberwolves?

The teams are off to strong starts when the Portland Trail Blazers take on the Denver Nuggets at 10 p.m. ET on Friday. Meanwhile, Jamal Murray, the All-Star point guard for the Denver Nuggets, has continued to write a brilliant start to the 2025–26 season.However, his speed recently got halted as he was listed on the Nuggets' injury report with a doubtful tag. This is due to the soreness in his left calf before their NBA Cup game against the Portland Trail Blazers on Friday night.After losing to Golden State on opening night, Denver has won three straight games, including Wednesday night's 122-88 victory. On the other hand, Portland lost their first game, but they have since won three of four games, including two in a row.Despite spending the whole last game on the bench, Murray managed to play 25 minutes, which is the fourth most of any player on the club. He struggled with the same issue in the 2024 postseason, and it was evident that it affected him when he faced a physically demanding Timberwolves team in the Conference Semifinals.Denver announced their official report to the NBA on Thursday, listing Murray as questionable with left calf tightness. The team wrote on X:“Injury Report ahead of tomorrow's game against the Trail Blazers: PROBABLE: Cameron Johnson (Right Shoulder Inflammation) QUESTIONABLE: Jamal Murray (Left Calf Tightness) #MileHighBasketball.”Murray has put on a number of incredible performances and averaged 27.0 points, 6.0 assists, and 4.3 rebounds for Denver in their first four games of the season. However, a recent update from the Nuggets has raised doubts about his availability for their first NBA Cup game of the year.Given that Murray's amazing start to the new season was halted by a calf injury, Denver could be better off either keeping him out of their next game completely or thinking about limiting his minutes.Murray would probably face Portland's All-Defensive Team-caliber forward Toumani Camara if he were to play for the Nuggets on Friday night. This would be a one-on-one match that would require the 28-year-old guard to put in a lot of effort and use extra force in an attempt to get open looks.Murray has averaged 27 points per game on 50/41/94 shooting splits so far this season, which is comparable to his 2023 Western Conference Finals performance against the Lakers, when he averaged 30 points.He has only averaged 15.8 points a game in October throughout his career, which is significantly lower than his numbers. He's made significant progress this season in an attempt to earn his first All-Star selection, but the much-needed momentum he's established from the start could be derailed if this injury keeps him out for a while.Injury has been a major factor, and his persistent calf problems are also a worry. Throughout his career, he has struggled with left calf pain, most notably during the 2024 NBA Playoffs. His next chance would be on Monday at home against the Sacramento Kings if he is unable to play on Friday.Also read: Portland Trail Blazers Vs Minnesota Timberwolves (10-22-2025) game preview: When and where to watch, expected lineup, prediction, and more","Denver nuggets face portland trail blazers at 10 p.m. Et on friday night.

Halloween is approaching, but Kylie Kelce isn’t here for fans dressing up as her. On the latest episode of her “Not Gonna Lie” podcast, the podcaster made it very clear that impersonating her isn’t on the menu this year. Kylie’s message was blunt, humorous, and unmistakable — fans need to steer clear if they were planning to make her their costume inspiration. “I just need to say no one should fuc**ng be me for Halloween. That's a ridiculous costume, and you need to cut that sh*t out. Go ahead. So, now tell them how to not do it,” Kylie said during the podcast, setting strict but playful rules.Jason Kelce, former Eagles center and Kylie’s husband, joined the conversation and gave his own take, offering practical advice for anyone attempting to capture Kylie’s look without going overboard. He walked listeners through the key elements: leggings or sweatpants, a hoodie, glasses, and maybe a baseball cap if needed. “Um, some type of hoodie. Yeah, if you haven't put in your contacts, glasses. Perfect. Maybe a baseball hat. It's pretty much it,” Jason explained.Kylie agreed, joking that Jason “nailed it,” and added that glasses were the finishing touch to perfect the outfit. “You're good,” she said, confirming that was all fans really needed if they insisted on paying homage.Beyond Halloween costumes, Kylie also shared insight into Jason’s calm reaction when people confuse him with his younger brother, Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce . Instead of reacting with frustration, Jason handles it with patience. ""That's like when people used to ask my husband, they'd be like, 'Aren't you Travis Kelce?'

NHL trade rumors grow around New Jersey Devils’ Nico Daws



Jacob Markstrom’s return adds uncertainty to the Devils’ goaltending plan



Possible trade destinations and scenarios for Nico Daws



The New Jersey Devils are once again making headlines in the latest NHL trade rumors, this time surrounding young goaltender Nico Daws. After a string of sharp performances, Daws has proven he’s ready for consistent NHL action; however, with veterans Jacob Markstrom and Jake Allen also in the mix, the Devils face a difficult roster decision as the season progresses.The challenge for New Jersey lies in roster management and waiver rules. Once Daws crosses the 30-day or 10-game threshold at the NHL level, he’ll require waivers to be reassigned to the AHL. Losing a promising 24-year-old goaltender for nothing would be a setback, making a mid-season trade a realistic option for general manager Tom Fitzgerald.Nico Daws’ steady play has not gone unnoticed by scouts across the league. His recent outing against the Minnesota Wild showed poise and confidence under pressure. Further fueling speculation that the Devils might use his value in trade discussions, NHL insiders believe multiple teams are monitoring his situation. Particularly those struggling with goalie depth or injuries early in the season.The return of Jacob Markstrom from injury could significantly impact how the Devils handle their goaltending trio, Markstrom’s veteran presence and Jake Allen’s experience make it challenging to keep all three goaltenders on the roster, and with the Devils pushing for playoff positioning.Now, Daws could be the odd man out unless a suitable trade emerges.Teams like the Vegas Golden Knights and Ottawa Senators. The Buffalo Sabres could be interested if their goalie depth weakens. A trade involving Daws might bring back a young forward or a mid-round pick. For now, New Jersey seems patient, but if the market heats up, expect calls to start soon.Also Read: Latest update on former Anaheim Ducks star Ryan Kesler’s criminal sexual conduct allegations","The new jersey devils are once again making headlines in the latest nhl trade rumors, this time surrounding young goaltender nico daws.

“It’s unfair”: Connor McDavid sparks debate after dismissing Kirill Kaprizov contract comparisons and taking less money to stay with Oilers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/its-unfair-connor-mcdavid-sparks-debate-after-dismissing-kirill-kaprizov-contract-comparisons-and-taking-less-money-to-stay-with-oilers/articleshow/124977299.cms,"Edmonton Oilers captain Connor McDavid has signed a new contract. He chose a deal that keeps his salary lower than he could have earned. This decision allows the team more money to sign other players. McDavid expressed his view that elite hockey players should earn more. His focus remains on winning championships for Edmonton.

Connor McDavid calls contract comparisons with Kaprizov “unfair”

Connor McDavid prioritizes winning over wealth in Edmonton

Edmonton Oilers captain Connor McDavid made it clear he isn’t interested in being part of any salary comparison talk, especially after signing his latest extension. The three-time Hart Trophy winner recently agreed to a two-year deal worth $12.5 million annually, keeping him among the NHL’s highest-paid players. But when conversations shifted toward Minnesota Wild forward Kirill Kaprizov ’s massive eight-year, $136 million contract, McDavid brushed off the comparisons.Known for his laser focus on performance rather than paychecks, the Oilers star emphasized that money doesn’t define his career goals or commitment to Edmonton. For McDavid, it’s about championships, not contract sizes,another reminder that his mindset remains firmly on winning, not competing in the league’s financial spotlight.Speaking to The Athletic, Connor McDavid made it clear that each player’s situation is unique. “It’s two completely different situations,” he said. “It’s unfair for people to say a bad thing about anybody. Everybody who plays in this league earns it. Everybody who makes money in this league earns that. It’s different situations, different cap situations, different teams, different constructs.”Rather than chasing the biggest paycheck, McDavid chose stability with a purpose.His short-term deal gives Edmonton flexibility — a rare move for a player of his caliber. While many expected the league’s most dominant forward to cash in with a long-term deal, McDavid’s focus wasn’t on personal gain but on helping the Oilers finally reach their Stanley Cup goal.McDavid’s decision comes after back-to-back Stanley Cup Final losses, leaving him determined to finish what he started. “It’s not a hard calculation to figure out,” he explained. “Obviously, the feeling was I was going to get some raise. The money they’ve gotten back is money they can go spend. That was the feeling.”Teammates have taken notice of his leadership. Defenseman Darnell Nurse praised the captain’s selflessness, saying, “He left a lot of money on the table. For us as a team, it shows how much he wants to win and his willingness to sacrifice for the group. That’s your captain leading by example.”McDavid’s extension may only run through 2028, but it sends a clear message Edmonton’s championship window is open now, and their leader is all in.Also Read: How Connor McDavid and Lauren Kyle quietly became hockey’s answer to Tom Brady and Gisele Bündchen","Connor mcdavid recently signed a two-year contract extension worth $12.5 million annually.
