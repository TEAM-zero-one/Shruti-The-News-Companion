Ek majaak abhi aur hoga jab September 14 ko India vs Pakistan match hoga. Wahaan ek majaak aur hoga

Former Pakistan batter Basit Ali has made a bold prediction about the India versus Pakistan Asia Cup clash on September 14.The eight-nation Asia Cup will be the first major event in the build-up to next year's T20 World Cup in India in February and March. The Asia Cup will begin on September 9 with defending champions India set to face hosts United Arab Emirates a day later in Dubai in the eight-nation tournament.India and arch-rivals Pakistan have been clubbed in Group A and clash on September 14.Basit was furious about the way Pakistan Cricket Board is functioning in the recent years.A couple of days ago, Pakistan Cricket Board has downgraded deals for Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan in the latest list of 30 centrally contracted players announced.Both Babar and Rizwan were in category A but have been relegated to join Abrar Ahmed, Fakhar Zaman, Haris Rauf, Hasan Ali, Saim Ayub, Salman Ali Agha, Shadab Khan and Shaheen Shah Afridi in category B.Pakistan finished at the bottom of the ICC World Test Championship and the PCB has demoted its test captain Shan Masood from category B to category D.Fast bowler Naseem Shah, who was also dropped for the upcoming T20 tournaments in the United Arab Emirates, was dropped from the second tier to the third tier of contracted players.Wickekeeper-batter Usman Khan, who chose to play for Pakistan over the UAE, was among the eight international players who didn’t get a central contract.While some key Pakistan cricketers were demoted, legs-pinner Ahmed, fast bowler Rauf, opening batter Ayub, T20 captain Agha and legspinner Shadab Khan were all upgraded from C to B category contracts.The contracts run through June 30, 2026.Basit has called the entire saga about the contract a ""joke.""He then further stated: "".(One more joke will happen when India faces Pakistan on September 14. Another joke will unfold there),"" he told Kamran Akmal on a YouTube show ""Game Time.""",Former pakistan batter basit ali has made a bold prediction about the india versus pakistan asia cup clash on september 14.

SRINAGAR: The unhurried rhythm of a shikara gliding through the Dal is one of Kashmir's oldest inheritances.On Thursday, a 17-year-old Kashmiri boy swapped the oars of his shikara for a kayak paddle and whipped up a frenzy generations of his family hadn't known – shouts of ""Mohsin! Shabhash, Mohsin!"" from the banks of the lake as he neared the finish line of a 1000m kayaking competition to give J&K the first gold of the ongoing Khelo India Water Sports Festival.""I am so happy. I defeated kayakers who have competed in China and Europe. This is a big thing for me,"" said Mohsin, moments after stepping out of his kayak into the waiting arms of his coach Bilquis Mir, a former international and an Olympic judge.Mohsin, a Class 12 student at Srinagar's SP Higher Secondary School, takes tourists on shikara rides after school almost every day to earn some money that goes into supplementing his diet. It helps that he lives in Kand Mohalla, next to the lake.Mohsin credits his carpenter father Fida Hussain with encouraging him to excel in sport. ""My father tells me that kayaking is my ticket out of Dal to see the world,"" he told TOI.Winning gold in a national competition ""in front of my people"" has stoked Mohsin's ambition to aim for bigger glory, which his coach believes isn't out of reach.""Mohsin was only seven when he came to me to learn kayaking. He has come a long way since, striving to get better each day.I think this is just the beginning,"" said Mir.While the adulation still rings in his ears, Mohsin worries about finding the resources to reach the next level. ""Only I know how difficult it has been just to be able to afford the diet a kayaker needs to compete in such events,"" he said.Khelo India Water Sports Festival, which runs until Aug 23, is the second Khelo India event hosted by J&K after the Khelo India Winter Games in Gulmarg. The water sports edition features six events –rowing, canoeing, kayaking, water skiing, shikara race and dragon boat race.Launched in 2017-18, Khelo India is a mission to promote sports at the grassroots and help scouts spot talent early.","Mohsin ali, 17, wins gold at khelo india water sports festival in srinagar.

From $25K to $10M: Tyson Bagent’s tearful speech has fans rooting harder than ever,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/from-25k-to-10m-tyson-bagents-tearful-speech-has-fans-rooting-harder-than-ever/articleshow/123440842.cms,"Tyson Bagent signs two year extension as Chicago Bears lock in backup quarterback until 2027 (Image via Getty)

From Shepherd University to Chicago: Tyson Bagent’s $10M payday brings him to tears



Tears of gratitude show what this moment means



Why Tyson Bagent’s story matters for football fans everywhere



If you ever needed proof that dreams don’t care where you start, Tyson Bagent just delivered it in the most emotional way possible. The Chicago Bears quarterback, who not long ago was a Division II kid at Shepherd University in West Virginia just signed a massive $10 million extension and couldn’t hold back tears as he explained how many people he’ll be able to help with this money. From a $25k signing bonus to a $5 million-per-year contract, this is the kind of underdog fairytale the NFL is made for.Before he was tearing up over a $10M deal, Tyson Bagent was just another college QB at Shepherd Rams, a Division II program in West Virginia that doesn’t exactly scream NFL pipeline. He wasn’t drafted, didn’t have the hype, and definitely didn’t walk into the league with big endorsements waiting for him. But what he did have was grit, a cannon for an arm, and the kind of perseverance that makes scouts stop and think twice.Most Division II players never even sniff the league. Bagent not only made it, he carved himself a real role in Chicago.When Bagent first entered the NFL, his deal was about as small as it gets, a $25,000 signing bonus, and barely $1.5 million spread across two years. In NFL money, that’s pocket change. Every snap he took was basically an audition just to stay in the league.Fast-forward to now, his new $10 million contract extension puts him at $5M per year. That’s not just job security, that’s generational stability. It’s the kind of deal most undrafted players only dream about, and Bagent made it reality.When the extension was announced, Bagent broke down while talking to reporters. His words weren’t about himself or flashy purchases, but about how many people he could help with this money. That honesty, that raw emotion, it’s what made this moment hit harder than a touchdown celebration.Instead of bragging, he showed gratitude. Instead of flexing, he cried. And honestly, that’s why people are rallying behind him because he feels real.Bagent’s rise isn’t just about football. It’s about belief. He’s proof that you don’t need to come from a powerhouse program or be a first-round pick to make an impact. He’s proof that overlooked athletes can still climb to the top.In a league obsessed with stars and superteams, Tyson Bagent’s story is a refreshing reminder: sometimes the best narratives are written by the guys no one expected.Also read - Travis Kelce isn’t the first: Swifties remind everyone Taylor’s always shown off her boyfriends","Tyson bagent, the chicago bears backup quarterback, just signed a $10 million contract extension.

Poll Do you think Vanessa Bryant handled the pregnancy rumors well? Yes, very cleverly No, she should have addressed them directly

Met Gala Surprise: Rihanna Stuns With Baby Bump Reveal, A$AP Rocky Confirms It’s Baby No 3

After days of unrelenting speculation, Vanessa Bryant took to Instagram Stories on Sunday, June 1, to put the rumors to rest. Her response wasn’t a press statement or a legal warning, it was a wild meme with a big middle finger to the internet trolls. The meme featured music icon Rihanna floating in water with a snorkel mask on her head, holding a drink, and flipping her middle finger.“Me protecting my peace, not pregnant & having fun all summer,” Vanessa Bryant wrote in the caption on her response to the online trolls who spread her pregnancy rumors about five years after her husband, Kobe Bryant ’s, untimely and devastating demise.It was clear, clever, and vintage Vanessa who shut down noise without saying a word about the origin of the gossip. No press release needed when you’ve got Rihanna energy with a direct middle finger gesture.The rumors had emerged out of nowhere, with some users pointing to photos allegedly showing a ""baby bump,"" though no timestamps or context were attached to those images. Vanessa hasn't been publicly linked to anyone romantically, and there’s been zero confirmation from her side—until now.In another Instagram Story later that evening, Vanessa shared a motivational quote that hinted at how she views the entire situation and what matters to her personally.“The only way to impress me, is by being a good person,” the quote read. “I don’t care what you have, what you wear, where you live, or what you drive. I just have deep respect for people with pure hearts and good intentions.”Adding one final touch to her trilogy of clapbacks, she posted another Rihanna meme, this one stating, “I’m not mean, I’m just not the one.”With the classic Rihanna memes, Vanessa showed that she is busy being a proud mom to her daughters while being the powerhouse of her business ventures. While she does not care about the rumor mill, her reaction explicitly showed that she is urging privacy.Recently, Renaldo Wilson, the brother of WNBA star A’ja Wilson, has spoken out after a fake photo involving (who appears to be) Celtics forward Jaylen Brown and Vanessa Bryant started spreading online. The image, which many quickly realized was AI-generated, sparked a wave of unnecessary speculation. Renaldo stepped in to shut down the rumors and defend Vanessa from online trolls.Vanessa Bryant, who shares four daughters with Kobe— Natalia, Bianka, Capri, and the late Gianna— has remained devoted to family and philanthropy. Most recently, she shared footage of a joyful family ski trip over the holidays, showing the tight-knit bond she maintains with her children.Natalia Bryant stepped into the fashion world just like her mother, officially joining IMG Models in 2021 at the age of 18. “Ever since I can remember, I wanted to model,” she shared in a statement posted by IMG on Instagram. “There is a lot to learn, but I feel this is a great opportunity for me to learn and express myself creatively.”Vanessa and Kobe Bryant tied the knot in April 2001. Tragically, in January 2020, Kobe and their 13-year-old daughter Gianna lost their lives in a helicopter crash that also killed seven others. They were headed to Kobe’s Mamba Sports Academy for a youth basketball game when the accident occurred. Kobe was 41 at the time. The loss shook the sports world and left a lasting impact on fans, friends, and loved ones across the globe. Kobe has left a huge legacy to his name as well, he is considered one the of the elite NBA superstars of all time with astounding stats, records and intense playmaking abilities. His demise created a huge void in the NBA world as fans are still mourning his untimely passing.Since their passing, she’s kept their memory alive through meaningful business ventures and charitable work. Kobe launched the Mamba Sports Foundation in 2016, aiming to support young athletes. After his death, Vanessa renamed it the Mamba & Mambacita Sports Foundation in honor of both Kobe and Gianna. Today, the foundation helps underserved boys and girls in sports, pushing forward the mission they believed in. It's her way of carrying on their legacy with purpose and heart.Vanessa Bryant’s response was indeed witty and empowering as she hinted that she deserves privacy and reminded the world that while she may be a public figure, her peace and dignity aren’t up for debate, especially not over unfounded gossip. After the viral response via memes, Vanessa has seemingly closed the chapter as she did not extend the matter any further with any other comments about it afterwards.Days after shutting down the pregnancy rumor, Vanessa Bryant made a glowing courtside appearance with her daughters at the New York Liberty vs. Chicago Sky game. The WNBA shared a sweet clip showing Vanessa alongside Natalia, 22, Bianka, 8, and Capri, 5, all smiling and waving for the camera.Later, Vanessa uploaded an image of her in a restaurant, candidly posing as she waited for the food to be arrive. Considering the dress, it appears that the photograph was shot after her recent attendance in the game.Their family moment quickly caught fans’ attention online, adding a warm highlight to the evening. It was a rare and heartwarming public outing for the Bryant family, showing their strong support for women’s basketball. It was Vanessa's first public outing since she debunked the horrendous pregnancy rumors.Recently, Vanessa honored her husband Kobe's memory with a heartfelt Instagram post on Instagram, sharing a throwback photograph of the family with the NBA legend, ""Happy Fathers Day @kobebryant 💕 You are so missed. We love you so much. #GirlDad 💕💕""Earlier this July, Vanessa Bryant added another heartfelt moment to her social media with a birthday post for her sister, Sophie. The sweet throwback photo featured Vanessa, her late husband Kobe Bryant, and Sophie together, smiling during happier times. It comes after several touching family updates, including daughter Natalia’s recent USC graduation and emotional tribute to her dad.As for her fortune, Vanessa's net worth has seen major growth over the years. While Kobe Bryant’s NBA success helped build their fortune, Vanessa carved her own path, too. She’s earned recognition as a model, businesswoman, and philanthropist, adding to her wealth through years of steady work.As of 2025, her estimated net worth is $600 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth. A large portion of that came from Kobe’s estate, after his tragic passing in 2020. At the time, Forbes valued the Lakers legend’s net worth at $600 million.Vanessa Bryant just shared a sweet throwback-inspired moment that melted hearts online. Her youngest daughter, Capri, recreated one of Kobe Bryant’s most iconic photos from 1999—wearing a cast and pajamas just like her dad did after a wrist injury. Vanessa captioned the photo, “Like father, like daughter. 💜 Capri Kobe Bryant 💜 #BabyMamba #KokoBean 💜💛🐍,” reminding fans how Kobe’s spirit lives on through their kids. From raising her children to keeping Kobe's memory alive, Vanessa has been an example of love and a remarkable parent. Also, there is no report of her seeing anyone as she remains loyal to her beloved husband Kobe, cherishing his legacy with their kids.Vanessa Bryant’s newest tribute arrives just months after she shared memories from a snowy holiday getaway with her daughters. Last December, she posted sweet moments on Instagram— showing the girls toasting marshmallows and skiing through the snow. Little Capri even shared a carousel ride with Vanessa, making the winter trip extra special.Additionally, Vanessa Bryant also grabs headlines for her friendship with several celebrities including Ciara, she often comments and likes the posts of her friends on social media. As of now, Vanessa is keeping a low profile about her personal life like always.Recently, Vanessa Bryant touched hearts with a heartfelt tribute to Kobe Bryant, joined by daughters Natalia, Bianka, and Capri during the Dodgers’ Bobblehead Night. She shared sweet photos from the emotional occasion, and her Instagram post celebrating Kobe Bryant’s legacy quickly drew an outpouring of love from fans. Certainly, Vanessa has been a proud mother with strong bonding with her kids.Recently, They partnered with @baby2baby and their Angel, @vanessabryant, to take part in a special Back-to-School Celebration for the incredible students of Ninth Street Elementary in Los Angeles. Each student received Mamba & Mambacita Sports Foundation gear along with Kobe sneakers — a perfect way to kick off the new school year and fall sports season.Also Read: Is Vanessa Bryant pregnant with her 5th child?

My Final Word on the Trade

The’ search for the right roster balance around Luka Doncic has sparked a major trade idea: landing Brooklyn Nets center. This scenario has quickly gained traction among fans and analysts, largely because Claxton’s defensive presence and athleticism appear to be an ideal fit alongside Doncic and LeBron James The framework of the deal being discussed revolves around the Los Angeles Lakers sending young talent and draft picks to Brooklyn in exchange for Claxton.The Nets would gain draft capital and players for their rebuild, while the Lakers secure a much-needed anchor at the center position.For the Los Angeles Lakers, Claxton fills a void that has been evident since Anthony Davis was traded. His defense, rebounding, and rim protection directly address the team’s playoff shortcomings. From Brooklyn’s perspective, this trade represents a chance to accelerate their rebuild by stacking young contributors and valuable future picks.Financially, Claxton’s declining contract makes him even more appealing. The Lakers would shed salary from their rotation players while securing a defensive specialist at a manageable cost.Nic Claxton is 6’11” with the tools to make an immediate impact. Last season, he averaged:• 10.3 points• 7.4 rebounds• 1.4 blocks• 55.7% shooting from the fieldHis ability to switch defensively, protect the rim, and thrive in pick-and-roll situations aligns perfectly with Doncic’s playmaking style.• Strong rim protection and interior defense• Athleticism that allows for switch-heavy defensive schemes• Lob-finishing and paint scoring opportunities created by Doncic’s passing• A cost-effective center under a declining contract• Long-term upside at only 26 years oldBrooklyn’s front office would gain valuable assets for the future:• Rui Hachimura adds proven scoring ability• Dalton Knecht offers rookie promise and versatility• Future first-round picks strengthen their rebuild• Potential to package assets in future tradesNic Claxton’s defensive intensity and versatility would immediately blend into the Los Angeles Lakers’ culture. Playing alongside LeBron James and Luka Doncic, his role as a defensive cornerstone and rim runner becomes even more valuable.Head coach Jordi Fernandez would benefit from Claxton’s ability to guard multiple positions, giving the Lakers tactical flexibility. With Claxton in the mix, the Lakers’ frontcourt rotation - featuring DeAndre Ayton and Rui Hachimura - could become one of the league’s most balanced combinations of size, skill, and defense.If the Los Angeles Lakers can pull off a trade for Nic Claxton, it could reshape their championship outlook. He brings exactly what the team has been missing: a versatile, defensive-minded center who thrives in modern NBA schemes. For the Nets, this trade offers a forward-looking package of young talent and draft flexibility.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Dallas Mavericks Might Sign $26.3 million ex-Golden State Warriors Star; Daniel Gafford Key Trade Asset?

Nikola Jokic’s team Serbia’s win was crucial



In a packed arena in Belgrade, basketball fans were treated to a bit more than just a clash between two of Europe’s brightest stars. While Serbia’s Nikola Jokic and Slovenia’s Luka Doncic squared off in their final tune-up before EuroBasket 2025, a wholesome moment stole the spotlight. Courtside cameras caught Jokic’s young daughter reaching out to Doncic for a high-five, and the Los Angeles Lakers guard shared the heartfelt moment. The exchange instantly went viral on social media.The matchup between Serbia and Slovenia showed Serbia’s depth and dominance. Nikola Jokic and company rolled to a 106–72 victory, capping off a flawless seven-game preparation stretch. Jokic logged 10 points, eight rebounds, and four assists in limited minutes, while Doncic battled through a rough shooting night, scoring 17 points on 4-for-18 from the floor.Despite the lopsided result, fans were treated to moments that highlighted the mutual respect between the two stars. After the game, Jokic greeted Doncic with his daughter by his side. The Lakers superstar leaned in for a lighthearted moment, and Jokic responded with a kind gesture. As NBACentral captioned, “Jokic kisses Luka on the cheek after the game 🤝.”While Serbia enters EuroBasket as one of the clear favorites, boasting NBA names like Bogdan Bogdanovic, Nikola Jovic, Nikola Topic, and Tristan Vukcevic, Slovenia faces an uphill climb.Doncic carries the weight of his national team, with less roster support compared to Jokic’s dominant Serbian squad. Slovenia closed their preparations with just one win in six games, raising questions about how far Doncic’s brilliance alone can take them.Serbia’s control of Thursday’s contest left little doubt about their potential. They jumped out with a 10–0 run and stretched their lead to 21 points midway through the second quarter. From there, it was never close. Nikola Jovic paced all scorers with 18 points, while Bogdanovic and Vukcevic chipped in to showcase Serbia’s well-rounded attack.Also Read: Paige Bueckers surpasses legendary WNBA player to claim her latest milestone Serbia enters Group A alongside Turkey, Czechia, Latvia, Portugal, and Estonia.

What Jack Eichel’s selection means for Vegas

All Jack Eichel Goals: 2024-25 Regular Season & Playoffs

Another milestone has been achieved in Jack Eichel's journey through hockey. The Vegas Golden Knights' talented center has officially been named as one of the initial six players on Team USA's preliminary roster for the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milan-Cortina. His first Olympic appearance for the Stanley Cup champion is not only a personal achievement but a win for Vegas hockey. Eichel's presence brings an international spotlight for Team USA and much-needed attention to the growing legacy of the Golden Knights.Adding some balance, leadership, and offensive creativity, Jack Eichel turns out to be very valuable for Team USA. He adds an element of unpredictability to international hockey: his speed, vision, and ability to stickhandle in tight spaces are difficult to contain. The 6-foot-2 winger is a kaleidoscopic piece, able to wax and wane between shooter and playmaker on the power play, and is always the target. In a tournament in which games are decided by trivial margins, Eichel's 200-foot skill set could well be the difference.Eichel’s call-up for the Olympics also resonates outside the rink. For the Golden Knights, his selection raises the franchise to a global level of recognition.Just as Vegas and Eichel secured the 2023 Stanley Cup, the selection for the Olympics tends to elevate the team brand. Las Vegas fans now have to see one of their brightest stars go and represent the country on the biggest hockey stage, nurturing pride and respect internationally. After a set of tough times that have recently plagued the city, the rise of Eichel paints a positive story in favor of recognizing Las Vegas as a serious hockey platform.Also Read: Casey Mittelstadt trade rumors stir Boston Bruins off-season buzz The pathway of Jack Eichel to the 2026 Olympics carries themes of personal triumph yet alludes to something bigger. For Team USA, he is an important piece in their championship puzzle; while for the Golden Knights, he elevates the franchise to a household name across the world. Therefore, as he sets his sights on skating under the American colors, there will certainly be something to look forward to from both Vegas and USA Hockey in Eichel, a player molded for big-time moments.",Jack eichel has been named as one of the initial six players on team usa's preliminary roster for the 2026 winter olympics in milan-cortina.

Kylie Kelce backs Taylor Swift’s viral line and salutes women in sports

Inside Taylor Swift’s ‘New Heights’ appearance: sourdough, family notes, and a record view count

Kylie Kelce spotlighted Taylor Swift ’s viral line from the Aug. 13 New Heights episode and pushed it into the women-in-sports conversation. On Thursday, Aug. 21, the 33-year-old praised the clip on her Not Gonna Lie podcast and highlighted the women using it.Kylie referenced Swift’s Aug. 13 appearance and played the audio clip that’s circulating across sports TikTok. “There's a trending TikTok sound from the other podcast that I can confidently say is one of the most badass things ever said on there,” she said on Not Gonna Lie (Aug. 21). The line she flagged from Swift: “I think we all know that if there’s one thing that male sports fans want to see in their spaces and on their screens, it’s more of me. ”Kylie noted that ESPN analyst Mina Kimes used the sound and defended the work behind it. “And I love this because I'm a tell you right now, Mina would not be on every f------ show if she wasn't absolutely nailing it. Okay? So yeah. Fact is, Mina, I wanna see you on our screens, but I do love this.” She added that Ilona Maher, Livvy Dunne, and the Nebraska volleyball team “nailed” the trend.Kylie explained the clip for audio listeners and pointed to how often Kimes appears across ESPN shows, tying it to merit.She grouped Maher, Dunne, and Nebraska volleyball as examples of women using the Swift audio effectively.Swift opened her record-setting sit-down with Travis and Jason Kelce by leaning into a running bit about bread. “The sourdough's taken over my life in a huge way. I'm really talking about bread 60 percent of the time now,” she said. “I'm just, like, always baking bread and texting my friends and being like, ‘Can I send you some bread? I need some feedback. Do you like this one better than you liked the other one? Like, I did the rise a little differently. ’”Swift also tied it to the Kelce household. She said Kylie got her into cinnamon sugar bakes for the kids and added: “This one I've been workshopping for the girls because they love everything rainbow, funfetti sourdough … Because they love sprinkles. Like, we put sprinkles in everything when we hang out.” During the same episode, Swift praised Jason and Kylie: “You're exactly as I thought you would be. Kylie is exactly as I thought she would be, just like the realest, the smartest, the coolest. ”Swift’s New Heights episode drew 13 million YouTube views in 24 hours, passing Kylie’s previous show record. Kylie reacted last week: “Officially no longer the record holder for the most watched episode of the other podcast. There's no way it's even close, and I love that for me.”","Kylie kelce referenced swift’s aug. 13 appearance and played the audio clip.

What Kaavia’s Future in Sports Looks Like

NBA legendand actressare navigating a new parenting chapter as their youngest daughter, Kaavia, develops a deep admiration for Chicago Sky forward. Known as the “Bayou Barbie,” Reese has quickly become a powerful role model in Kaavia’s life, shaping her early love for basketball and sparking discussions between her parents about how best to guide her ambitions. Dwyane Wade , a three-time NBA champion, has stepped into the dual role of father and coach. Speaking on the IMO podcast with Michelle Obama and Craig Robinson, he explained that coaching Kaavia demands a different tone compared to his role as a parent.“I’m her basketball coach right now, right? I’m the one who’s training her. And I told her mom… when she says she wants to be better than Angel Reese, I’m going to have a different tone,” Wade shared.Dwyane Wade’s approach often emphasizes discipline and sacrifice to help Kaavia pursue greatness. While she respects his coaching, Kaavia sometimes struggles with the intensity - though their bond remains strong as they reconcile quickly after tough sessions.Gabrielle Union experiences a different side of parenting. She often faces Kaavia’s playful resistance, such as sharp stares or cheeky responses, reminding her of the challenges of raising a strong-willed child.Her approach leans toward empathy and emotional support, providing balance to Wade’s more rigorous style.This contrast in parenting - firm discipline versus gentle nurturing - creates natural clashes but ultimately enriches Kaavia’s development by exposing her to both resilience and compassion.The Wade family’s connection to Angel Reese deepened when Dwyane became a minority owner of the Chicago Sky in 2023, coinciding with Reese’s entry into the league. Kaavia has since embraced Reese not just as a player but as a personal hero.Her admiration is evident in small yet telling ways - like wearing Gabrielle Union’s high heels to appear taller, proudly admitting she wants to be “tall like Angel Reese.” Reese, in turn, has embraced the bond, gifting Kaavia Chicago Sky team gear that she wears with pride. Their mutual affection highlights the growing influence of WNBA athletes on young fans.Dwyane Wade and Gabrielle Union ’s differing parenting philosophies are united by a common goal: ensuring Kaavia has strong role models who inspire her. For Wade, this mirrors his experience with his older son Zaire, who looked up to NBA stars during his basketball journey.Now, with Kaavia, Wade sees Angel Reese filling that role - symbolizing excellence in women’s sports and demonstrating to young girls that greatness is within reach.Whether Kaavia pursues basketball seriously or simply continues to admire athletes like Reese, the foundation her parents are building reflects a broader cultural shift. Women’s sports figures are being recognized as equally impactful role models, shaping both family dynamics and society’s appreciation of female athletes.Also read: Jayson Tatum Injury Update: Boston Superstar Calls Rehab ‘Tedious’ Months After Achilles Injury Shakes Celtics’ Season For the Wade family, Angel Reese represents more than just a basketball star—she’s a beacon of empowerment for Kaavia and countless other young fans.","Nba legendand actress navigating a new parenting chapter as their youngest daughter, kaavia, develops a deep admiration for chicago sky forward angel reese.

The Detroit Lions are dealing with more trouble at edge rusher as the offseason winds down. On Thursday, head coach Dan Campbell gave an update on Josh Paschal, who’s still on the non-football injury (NFI) list. Paschal was originally expected to return by early September, but now it looks like he’ll be out longer than first thought. According to Jeremy Reisman of Pride of Detroit, Campbell signaled that Paschal is now likely to begin the 2025 season still on the NFI list. That designation would sideline him for at least the first four games.""Dan Campbell says Josh Paschal may return a little later than expected,"" Reisman reported. ""Heavily implied he'll start the season on (NFI).""Paschal’s injury has not been disclosed publicly, but his extended absence only adds to growing concerns about the Lions’ already thin edge rotation. Campbell had previously suggested Paschal could be ready by September, but that outlook changed this week. While he didn’t confirm anything outright, the Lions’ head coach made it clear the veteran edge rusher is trending toward missing time to start the season.With Paschal likely out, Aidan Hutchinson and Marcus Davenport are the main options at edge rusher. But Davenport has a history of injuries, which makes things even riskier. Without Paschal in Week 1, the Lions might have to rely on young or unproven players to step in.To make matters worse, Detroit also lost rookie Ahmed Hassanein to a pectoral injury during last week’s preseason matchup against the Miami Dolphins. Campbell revealed that the rookie will be sidelined “for a while,” and while Hassanein says surgery won't be necessary, there’s still a chance he could miss the entire year. “[Hassanein will be out] for a while,” Campbell said when asked about the rookie’s status. That leaves the Lions extremely short-handed behind their top two edge defenders, especially with no concrete return date for either Paschal or Hassanein.The Lions were already short on edge rushers going into camp, and with both Josh Paschal and Ahmed Hassanein likely missing the start of the season, depth is now a serious concern. Aidan Hutchinson is still the leader on the defensive line, but relying too much on Marcus Davenport could be risky because of his injury history.At this point, it looks like the Lions may need outside help. One name being mentioned is Za’Darius Smith, a veteran edge rusher who could bring much-needed experience and production.","Detroit lions edge rusher josh paschal likely out for start of 2025 season.

Joe Burrow won’t play after controversial preseason decision



Cordell Volson’s season-ending injury leaves Bengals scrambling



Can Cincinnati keep Joe Burrow upright in 2025?



Things aren’t settling down in Cincinnati. The Bengals will be without starting left guard Cordell Volson for the season and are now choosing to rest Joe Burrow after a preseason stretch that raised eyebrows across the league.Burrow, who was sacked three times in Monday’s game against the Washington Commanders, won’t suit up against the Indianapolis Colts on Saturday. Head coach Zac Taylor confirmed his decision after criticism mounted over the risks of playing the team’s $275 million quarterback in August.Burrow played two series against the Philadelphia Eagles on Aug. 7 before taking three drives against Washington earlier this week. On one play, instead of sliding, he attempted to extend a scramble and was swallowed by three defenders.“Go down, Joe, it’s August,” ESPN’s Joe Buck said on the broadcast.Taylor acknowledged the hit but defended his approach. “It’s one of those things for him, that’s what preseason football’s for. Do I love seeing that? No, I don’t. But, at the same time, he’s out there learning what he can and can’t do and we’ve seen him get out of that stuff before.”Burrow has already led four touchdowns in five preseason drives, but Taylor made it clear: “I’m not anticipating any starters playing.” The Bengals will keep their quarterback on the sideline until Week 1 at Cleveland on Sept. 7.The loss of Volson adds another blow to Cincinnati’s shaky protection. ESPN’s Ben Baby first reported that the guard will undergo season-ending surgery on his right shoulder after being hurt at practice Aug. 15.Volson has started 48 games since being drafted in 2022, but his 2024 season metrics told a story of inconsistency.According to Pro Football Focus, he allowed six of Burrow’s 48 sacks, committed eight penalties, and ranked 97th in pass-blocking grade. His lone strength was run blocking, where he graded No. 53.Taylor called the injury “a tough one for him” and admitted surgery was likely.Cincinnati has already brought in Dalton Risner for a visit. In 537 snaps last season, Risner didn’t allow a sack or draw a penalty. He was ranked No. 13 among guards in pass blocking with a 76.2 grade, a major upgrade over Volson.With right guard Lucas Patrick and Cody Ford also listed as questionable, the Bengals are thin at the position heading into the season opener.This season is pivotal for the Bengals. They’ve missed the postseason in back-to-back years after making a Super Bowl run in 2021 and reaching the AFC Championship in 2022. Despite having Burrow, Ja’Marr Chase, and Tee Higgins, defensive lapses and line issues have derailed them.ESPN analyst Ryan Clark recently said the team is “absolutely” wasting Burrow’s prime years. With Volson out, Hendrickson still holding out, and minimal offseason upgrades, Cincinnati enters 2025 in another precarious spot.Taylor insists the team is ready. “I feel good about where our team’s at right now,” he said. “I’m excited to get through the preseason and go play games because I see what I see in practice.”The Bengals open the regular season at Cleveland on Sept. 7.",Cincinnati bengals quarterback joe burrow won’t play against indianapolis colts.

Patrick Mahomes reflects on the struggles surrounding his father’s DWI arrest



Patrick Mahomes Sr.’s admission and the lessons from the past



In the high-pressure build-up to the 2024 Super Bowl, Patrick Mahomes faced not only the weight of leading the Kansas City Chiefs but also an emotional storm away from the field. Just days before the biggest game of the season, his father, Patrick Mahomes Sr. , was arrested on a third DWI charge, forcing the star quarterback to navigate a deeply personal crisis under the public eye.Speaking on ESPN’s Chiefs Kingdom, Mahomes candidly shared how the incident shadowed one of the most important moments of his career. “It was during that Super Bowl. It became a story, and so, I had to answer questions about it,” he recalled. For Mahomes, the hardest part was seeing how the headlines extended beyond the game. “I think just knowing that it hurt me woke him up to know that like, you can't keep doing the same things. ”Mahomes Sr., a former MLB pitcher, admitted how the arrest left him devastated. “For him to have to answer questions about me was probably the most embarrassing thing I've ever been through in my life,” he said, reflecting on the toll it took not only on his son but on their family’s public image.Even Brittany Mahomes, who stood by her husband during the storm, revealed how the arrest shook their household.As a mother of three, she stressed the importance of setting an example for the younger generation. “It finally hit him,” Brittany said, noting how Mahomes Sr. was reminded that his children and grandchildren “are watching” every choice he makes.In the episode, Mahomes Sr. confronted his past with unfiltered honesty. He admitted that being “considered one of the best athletes in the world” had given him privileges—some of which he misused. “Some of them you shouldn't take, and I took my fair share of them,” he confessed.He further acknowledged that alcohol was woven into his playing days, often dismissed as part of the culture of professional sports. “It was just something that I've always done, just something that's in the game. I went out, partied a little bit, wasn't always where I was supposed to be,” he said. Mahomes, reflecting on his father’s career, pointed out how he often underestimated his drinking because “he could always still be on the baseball field” until his retirement in 2009.The February 2024 arrest in Tyler, Texas, where he recorded a blood alcohol content of 0.23, wasn’t his first. Mahomes Sr. had previously served 40 days in jail for a 2018 DWI. Following his guilty plea this year, he served a 10-day sentence in October.For Patrick Mahomes, the ordeal was a test of resilience and focus, reminding the world that even star athletes carry heavy personal battles behind the spotlight of success.Also Read: Why was a potential assassination attempt on Andy Reid in 2024 swept under the rug by the NFL?","Patrick mahomes sr. was arrested on a third dwi charge just days before the 2024 super bowl.
