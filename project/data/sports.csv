Luka Doncic opens up on being LeBron James’ teammate in Los Angeles Lakers

Luka Dončić on the Lakers as Contenders, the Dallas Trade & Are the Nuggets Better Than the Thunder?

Did LeBron James get Luka Doncic nervous in the beginning?

Luka Doncic got traded to the Los Angeles Lakers in a stunning mid-season move by the Dallas Mavericks. While fans were shocked, many were excited to see the Slovenian athlete pair up with the NBA legend LeBron James . The dream came true as both athletes joined hands in leading the Lakers to their recent victories. In the latest episode of the Cousins with Vince Carter and Tracy McGrady podcast, Luka actually candidly revealed his experience playing with the legend.Luka expressed his gratefulness for being a part of the iconic LeBron James’ career. It has been rumored that LeBron will be retiring soon. Hence, it could not have been a better time to witness the final journey of the athlete as a teammate. Luka even revealed his greatest inspiration for joining the league and it was none other than LeBron James himself.In the latest episode of the Cousins with Vince Carter and Tracy McGrady podcast, Luka Doncic was asked a question that many would want to know. The athlete was asked what life has been like since he got to play with the NBA legend LeBron James. Luka’s response was quite heartwarming. The Slovenian athlete stated, “Honestly, just being part of his journey, you know, it has been amazing.” He further revealed the real motivation behind Luka entering the league.“I came into the league, like, watching him play.”It was a surreal moment for Luka when he first played against LeBron. He added, “My first game against him was like a dream come true. So just being his teammate, it’s insane.” Vince Carter continued the conversation by posing another question to him. When Luka got traded to the Los Angeles Lakers, many believed that both Luka and LeBron’s individual basketball IQ would create conflicts. However, the coordination between them looks effortless. Carter asked Luka how the players pulled that off. Luka instantly replied, “I think it's mostly understanding. Obviously, we talk a little bit. But I just feel like when he was injured in the beginning, after he came back, in the first couple of games, it wasn’t that good.” He continued, “But now, since we played a long time together, it’s getting better and better.”During the podcast, in the same segment, Vince Carter pointed out something that LeBron James did. This act of LeBron James might have made Luka Doncic nervous and uncomfortable. It was in the huddle during Luka’s first game with the Los Angeles Lakers. Carter exclusively mentioned that LeBron asked the Slovenian athlete to be who he is. Luka did agree to the instance and accepted the fact that he was nervous for his first ever game with the Lakers.",Luka doncic got traded to the los angeles lakers in a stunning mid-season move by the dallas mavericks.

Josh Allen makes it clear he is riding with Sam Darnold and the Seahawks

Sam Darnold’s long road from ‘bust’ talk to a Super Bowl start with Seattle

Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen is not pretending to be neutral for Super Bowl LX. With the Seattle Seahawks set to face the New England Patriots, Allen has made it very clear whose side he is on, and it has nothing to do with AFC East grudges.Instead, it is about loyalty. Allen says he will be backing close friend Sam Darnold, and he keeps repeating the same message across national TV hits: “Sam Darnold, that’s my boy.”Allen has been asked the same Super Bowl question on multiple platforms this week, and his answer has not changed once. On CBS Sports, he kept it simple: “I love Sam Darnold, that's one of my good buddies… I will be watching, I will be rooting him on.” That was the first sign he was willing to say out loud what many quarterbacks duck around Super Bowl week, who they actually want to see win.He went even deeper on FS1’s “First Things First,” laying out how long this relationship has been in place.“But Sam Darnold, that's my boy,” Allen said. “Like, we go back to the draft. Even before the draft, we've hung out before the draft when we were in college. We met at some Touchdown, I think it was the Touchdown Club of Columbus, going into our draft, his sophomore year, my junior year.And like I said, we live pretty close together. We spent a lot of time in the offseason together playing golf and hanging out. So I'm rooting for my man there. 14, that wears number 14 for the Seattle Seahawks.”That is not neutral language. That is a franchise quarterback openly throwing his support behind another starting quarterback who is about to play in the biggest game of his career.Allen also made sure people understood why Darnold is in this position. Asked about Darnold’s path, Allen pointed to the work it took to climb out of the “bust” conversation. “But to Sam's point, he's just continued to work hard,” Allen said. “You know, he's been at a few different stops. Um, obviously got his opportunity last year in Minnesota. They let him go, and now he's, he's playing in the Super Bowl for Seattle Seahawks. So he's worked extremely hard for it. And, again, I've got nothing but love and respect for Sammy D, and I'll be pulling, pulling for him hard.”There is an AFC East layer here too. Beating the Patriots has defined a big chunk of Buffalo’s modern era. It would be easy to paint this as Allen wanting a division rival to fall short on the biggest stage. He did not lean into that. Every answer he gave this week came back to Darnold, the friendship, the grind, the shared history from the 2018 NFL Draft class.While Allen talks about respect for both sides, he keeps circling back to the same point: in this game, he is all in on the quarterback in navy and action green.Darnold has been the subject of every kind of label since he entered the league as the No. 3 pick in 2018. The early years with the New York Jets were rough. So were the swings with the Carolina Panthers and the short run with the San Francisco 49ers. By the time he moved through Minnesota, it was fair to wonder how many more chances he would even get.That is what makes the last two seasons so jarring. As noted in recent coverage of his rise, Darnold has stacked back-to-back 14-win years and is about to start a Super Bowl for the Seahawks. The box that once said “bust” now reads “franchise quarterback on the biggest stage.”Darnold has not tried to rewrite his past to make this look cleaner. On “The Dan Patrick Show” on Jan. 30, he leaned straight into how much those early years shaped him.“The days in New York, the days in Carolina, those are part of my journey, and they’re part of my experience,” Darnold told Dan Patrick. “I loved every single part of it. Yeah, there were some lows that sucked. I’m not going to lie to you. That’s part of it, though. I learned so much from that, and I’m able to move on.”He also explained how he kept perspective when everything around him was being picked apart. “It’s funny,” Darnold added. “After every single, after every single game we lost or things that didn’t go well, I was able to wake up the next day and see the sun rise and go into the building and see my teammates and have fun with my coaches. That’s a part of life. I think being able to realize that at this point in my career allows you to take it one day at a time and enjoy every single little moment that you get with your teammates. ”That is the version of Darnold Allen is talking about when he says he has “nothing but love and respect for Sammy D.” This is not just a buddy pick. Allen has watched the full arc, the criticism, the moves, the 2018 class comparisons – and now sees his friend starting for Seattle in a game that will change how Darnold is talked about for the rest of his career.The contrast with Tom Brady’s stance this week only sharpens Allen’s position. Speaking on his “Let’s Go!” podcast, Brady stayed away from picking a side, saying he wanted “the best team win” and just wanted “good football” out of Seahawks vs. Patriots. He also called this “a new chapter in New England” and said he was happy to see the Patriots back on this stage.Allen is not wired that way right now. He respects both teams, but he has already nailed his colors to one sideline. If the Seahawks win, Darnold’s story changes in real time. Allen clearly wants to be on record as one of the people who believed in that turnaround before the confetti falls.","Buffalo bills quarterback josh allen says he will be rooting for close friend sam darnold and the seattle seahawks.

‘We’re So Back’: Can Backstreet Boys’ T-Mobile Super Bowl 60 Ad Steal The Spotlight?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/were-so-back-can-backstreet-boys-t-mobile-super-bowl-60-ad-steal-the-spotlight/articleshow/127913284.cms,"Backstreet’s back for Super Bowl 60. T-Mobile dropped teasers of the boy band in full pink-and-white mode with Druski, a Times Square “serious production build-out,” and a 60-second spot set for the second quarter. (Image via Getty)

Backstreet Boys lean into nostalgia as T-Mobile builds a Super Bowl 60 moment

Inside the Druski pairing and why T-Mobile keeps going back to Backstreet-level nostalgia

If Bad Bunny owns halftime at Super Bowl 60, T-Mobile is clearly betting Backstreet Boys can crash the party earlier in the night. The ’90s giants are fronting the carrier’s 13th straight Big Game campaign, with a 60-second spot set for the second quarter of Seahawks–Patriots at Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif. , on Feb. 8.Teasers dropping this week show Nick Carter, Howie Dorough, AJ McLean, Brian Littrell, and Kevin Richardson back in full formation. They are in coordinated pink and white outfits, running through tongue twisters about T-Mobile perks while comedian Druski gears up for a “big call” in a separate clip. Littrell sums up the whole play with one line: We’re so back!This is not a one-off nostalgia grab. T-Mobile has made the Super Bowl a habit, and this year the company is centering its entire push on a boy band that never really left the pop conversation.In the newest teaser, the group sit in a backstage area and cycle through vocal warmups tied to T-Mobile’s rewards language. Carter loosens up with the line Power pack perk on terrific T-Mobile Tuesday while McLean takes a crack at Switching swiftly to save smarter, switching swiftly to save smarter. It is goofy on purpose, built to remind viewers exactly why Backstreet worked on TV screens the first time around.Another clip shows T-Mobile’s “chief switching officer” Druski nervously rehearsing a call to his “boys” before he finally dials.That spot landed first, with the Backstreet teaser following close behind to reveal who he was actually calling in for the campaign.The hints did not start there. Pop-culture account Deux Moi posted video of the band walking out of T-Mobile’s Times Square flagship alongside a caption that read, SPOTTED: A serious production build-out inside the T-Mobile flagship in Times Square AND a late-‘90s track running on a loop! The post then pushed the real question fans were already asking: This raises the obvious question: are Backstreet Boys revisiting something from the past, or quietly working on what comes next.Commenters quickly connected the dots to Super Bowl week. One fan went straight to the finish line, writing, I smell a t-mobile Super Bowl commercial in the making.T-Mobile and the band are treating Sunday as that payoff. The 60-second spot is scheduled for the second quarter, with extra content already lined up for the brand’s Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube channels before and after the game. For viewers who cannot make it to the group’s Sphere Las Vegas shows this month, the ad becomes a quick national hit of millennial nostalgia.The timing lines up with their broader calendar, too. Backstreet Boys have been announced as one of the headliners for BottleRock Napa Valley 2026, which keeps them in festival rotation while the Super Bowl puts them back in front of a massive casual audience.Behind the scenes, this entire push is treated like a real production, not just a quick commercial shoot. The Super Bowl campaign is directed by Hot Tub Time Machine filmmaker Steve Pink and produced by Panay Films, the entertainment studio run by Wedding Crashers producer Andrew Panay.Panay and his team shot the spot over one packed weekend in late January. He explained the usual Super Bowl sprint by saying, I’m usually shooting Super Bowl spots…two weeks before [the game]. It’s scary, but it’s also kind of awesome, because I’m moving with culture. That is the lane this ad is chasing: current NFL moment on the field, heavy nostalgia off it.Panay said the decision to build around Backstreet Boys came after he watched them at the Sphere in Las Vegas last summer. His reaction was simple: I knew right away I wanted them. They are the delivery mechanism. He did not stop there, adding, They’re as hot now, if not hotter, than they ever were.Pairing them with Druski fits T-Mobile’s recent pattern. The brand has spent the past several years leaning into recognizable faces and light comedy, from an Oscars spot with Zach Braff and Donald Faison to a video-call mishap bit with Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton. The strategy is clear: hook casual viewers with someone they already like, then slide the product messaging in through jokes and music.This year, that whole play will unfold in a Super Bowl that is already crowded with star power. Bad Bunny is headlining the halftime show. Benson Boone has said the performance will bring in a whole new audience while he makes his own Super Bowl ad debut. Benson Boone, Sabrina Carpenter, Lady Gaga, and KATSEYE are among the artists tied to other brands’ spots. Before kickoff, Charlie Puth, Brandi Carlile, and Coco Jones are set to handle “The Star-Spangled Banner,” “America the Beautiful,” and “Lift Every Voice and Sing” respectively.T-Mobile still chose to center its bet on a single line from a millennial boy band: We’re so back! The company is banking on the fact that a lot of NFL fans grew up with those voices in the background of their first highlight tapes and high school playlists.If the finished spot lands on Sunday the way the teasers suggest, it will not just be a nostalgia play wedged between drives. It becomes one more reason people keep the volume up during commercials instead of scrolling through their phones while the Seahawks and Patriots reset for the next series.","T-mobile dropped teasers of the boy band in full pink-and-white mode with druski, a times square “serious production build-out,” and a 60-second spot set for the second quarter.

Former LSU standout Terrace Marshall Jr. set to join Miami Dolphins,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/former-lsu-standout-terrace-marshall-jr-set-to-join-miami-dolphins/articleshow/127913234.cms,"Image via Getty

Why Terrace Marshall Jr. joining makes sense

What does this mean for the Dolphins

The Miami Dolphins have added another wide receiver to their offseason roster, signing former LSU standout Terrace Marshall Jr. to a free agent contract.Marshall, who was part of LSU’s 2019 national championship team, once shared the field with stars like Joe Burrow, Ja’Marr Chase and Justin Jefferson. That Tigers offense was considered one of the most explosive in college football history, and Marshall played an important supporting role during that run.The Carolina Panthers picked Marshall in the second round of the 2021 NFL Draft (No. 59 overall). He came into the league with great hopes. But his career as a professional hasn't lived up to the promise he showed at LSU yet.His rookie season in 2021 saw limited production, as he recorded 17 catches for 138 yards. His best year came in 2022, when he posted 28 receptions for 490 yards and one touchdown. Despite flashes of potential, he struggled to secure a consistent role in Carolina’s offense.In 2023, Marshall appeared in nine games for the Panthers before moving on. He later had brief stints with the Las Vegas Raiders and the Philadelphia Eagles. His time with the Eagles in 2025 was spent largely on the practice squad, and he did not appear in a regular-season game.Because he ended the season on a practice squad, Marshall became a free agent once the Eagles’ campaign concluded. The Dolphins’ move is expected to be a reserve/future contract, allowing him to participate in offseason workouts and compete for a roster spot in 2026.Miami enters the offseason with several questions at the wide receiver position. Star wideout Tyreek Hill is recovering from a major knee injury, while other players could also move on in free agency. That situation could open the door for Marshall to compete for a role.The Dolphins are also getting used to a new way of leading. With a new staff and front office, head coach Jeff Hafley is in charge of changing the team's direction as they head into 2026.For Marshall, this contract is another chance to get his career back on track. He is still 6 feet 2 inches tall and has good speed and size, which are physical traits that made him a highly sought-after draft pick.Getting a spot on the 53-man roster won't be easy, but Miami could be the fresh start he needs. The former LSU star has had a rocky career in the NFL so far, but now he has a chance to show what he can do again.","The miami dolphins have signed former lsu star terrace marshall jr. to a free agent contract.

The remarkable career of Mickey Lolich

Mickey Lolich and the unforgettable 1968 World Series

Mickey Lolich, the longtime left-handed pitcher who won three All-Star games and then became an even bigger hero for the Detroit Tigers’ 1968 World Series title, has passed away at 85 years old. The Tigers on Wednesday announced that he had died and called him the most reliable and popular player in franchise history. Lolich had a reputation as a workhorse; nobody ever backed down from the biggest moments, a tough, durable competitor.Lolich was one of the most fearsome pitchers of his generation as he pitched for 16 seasons in the major leagues. He is synonymous with Detroit baseball, having provided some of the best pitching performances in the history of the organization. The numbers are impressive, and the accolades are numerous, but above all, every fan throughout Michigan will remember the heart and determination he took the mound with every time he pitched.Michael Stephen Lolich signed with the Tigers as a teenager and made his big league debut in 1963. After that, he became the ace of the Tigers' staff and one of the most steady starters in the game. Lolich pitched for the New York Mets and San Diego Padres after spending the first 13 of his 16 seasons with the Tigers.One of the greatest of the game, he ended his career with 217 wins, 191 losses, and a 3.44 earned run average. When he retired, his 2,832 strikeouts were the most ever by a left-handed pitcher and remain among the top totals in baseball history. In 1969, 1971, and 1972, Lolich was chosen as an American League All-Star, seasons in which he was often among the league leaders in innings pitched and complete games.It was during the 1968 World Series against the St. Louis Cardinals that Lolich's fate was permanently cast. Facing elimination in Game 5 of a series, the Tigers were down three games to one, he threw one of the greatest postseason games in the history of Baseball. The series featured three complete games from Lolich, including a nail-biting Game 7 win after two days' rest.He even earned the World Series MVP for his efforts and became the catalyst for Detroit's first title in 41 years. The grace with which he was able to overcome adversity made him a franchise icon and an embodiment of that championship squad.","Mickey lolich was one of the most fearsome pitchers of his generation as he pitched for 16 seasons in the major leagues.

Archie Jackson's Test Career

Matches Innings Runs HS Ave. 100s 50s 8 11 474 164 47.40 1 2

On This Day, February 4, almost a century ago in 1929, a batting genius scored his maiden — and only — century in his debut match for Australia against England in Adelaide. He was 19, and the mammoth 164 as an opener in the fourth Ashes Test was supposed to be his launch pad for cricket stardom. But it did not last.Meet the tragic batting genius — Archie Jackson , who was dubbed ‘as good as’ Don Bradman at that time. Jackson went on to play just eight Tests for Australia before he died from tuberculosis four years after his stunning debut, aged 23.Jackson made his first-class debut at the tender age of 17 after making his name in school-level cricket. Representing New South Wales, Jackson played 70 first-class games, including eight Tests for Australia, scoring 4383 runs at an average of 45.65, which included 11 hundreds and 23 fifties. He played just five seasons before ill health cut short his cricket journey.A graceful batter, Jackson also shared a record partnership of 243 runs for the fourth wicket with none other than Don Bradman at The Oval against England a year into his Test career. Jackson, though, contributed just 73, which turned out to be his second-best score after the debut 164.Archibald Jackson, popularly known as Archie Jackson, was a right-handed top-order batter who could bowl right-arm offbreak.He was born on September 5, 1909, in Lanarkshire, Scotland.He first made his name in school cricket, representing Rozelle School, before making his senior first-class debut for NSW in the 1926/27 season at the age of 17. Two years later, he made his international debut for Australia in the 1928/29 Ashes series.Jackson made his Australia debut in the fourth Test of the 1928/29 Ashes on February 1.England skipper Percy Chapman won the toss on Friday morning and elected to bat first. England openers Jack Hobbs (74) and Herbert Sutcliffe (64) gave the visitors a perfect start, posting 143 for the opening wicket before both were dismissed at the same score — turning 143/0 into 143/2 in no time. But England No.3 Wally Hammond (47*) steered England to 246/5 at stumps on Day 1.Hammond completed his century the next day and remained unbeaten on 119, but the visitors were bowled out for 334. Clarrie Grimmett took a five-wicket haul — 5 for 102 — for Australia.Australia did not start their first innings well, losing three wickets for just 19 on the board. Playing his first innings, the then 19-year-old Jackson held one end intact amid the collapse and revived the Aussie innings along with captain Jack Ryder. The duo completed their half-centuries and took the team to 131/3 at the end of the second day’s play, leaving the match evenly poised heading into the Sunday rest day.On Monday, February 4, Ryder fell for 63 after reviving the innings with a 126-run stand for the fourth wicket with debutant Jackson. Jackson completed his maiden century while adding 82 runs for the next wicket with Bradman (40) to push the total past the 200-mark.When Jackson finally fell LBW to Jack White, who returned figures of 5/130, he had scored a majestic 164 and taken Australia close to the 300-mark.Australia batted through the day and ended at 365/9 before being bowled out for 369 early on Day 4, taking a slender first-innings lead of 35.Hammond followed his unbeaten 119 in the first innings with a mammoth 177 in the second, and with support from Douglas Jardine’s 98, England set Australia a target of 349 runs.Young Jackson scored 36 in the second innings and added 65 for the opening wicket with Bill Woodfull (30). Australia’s middle order contributed well, with Alan Kippax (51), Ryder (87) and Bradman (58) reaching half-centuries, but regular wickets after Kippax’s dismissal left Australia in a tough spot. The hosts were eventually dismissed for 336, 13 runs short of the target, losing the tightly contested match by 12 runs.White was the wrecker-in-chief for England, returning excellent figures of 8 for 126 to go with his 5 for 130 in the first innings.Australia lost the match, but young Jackson announced his arrival on the international stage with a big hundred. It did not last long, however, as seven Tests and four years later, Jackson died on February 16, 1933, at Clayfield, Brisbane, aged 23 years and 164 days.","Archie jackson made his test debut for australia against england on february 1, 1929.

Artemi Panarin’s $50 Million demands make things hard for potential buyers

The NHL's Olympic roster freeze officially kicks in today at 3 PM EDT and runs through February 22. That gives the Rangers and the rest of the league just hours to complete any transactions before the trade market goes dark for nearly three weeks.All eyes are on one player. And that player is in no rush to make things easy. Artemi Panarin has been held out of the Rangers' last three games for what the team has called ""roster management"" purposes. But this holdup is not due to a lack of interest from the teams.Panarin, who leads the Rangers with 57 points in 52 games this season, hasn't suited up since January 26. The organization's message is clear. His time in New York is coming to an end, and according to The Athletic's Vince Mercogliano, six teams remain in the mix for Panarin.The issue is the winger's insistence on having a contract extension in place as part of any deal. Panarin is reportedly seeking roughly $50 million on what could be the final contract of his career, a figure that has given several suitors pause.His agent, Paul Theofanous, has been working through the options, but the process has been slow. Panarin holds a full no-movement clause in the final year of his seven-year, $81.5 million contract, giving him complete control over his destination.Multiple league sources believe the Florida Panthers remain his preferred landing spot. The Tampa Bay Lightning have also generated recent buzz. But the extension piece presents a significant challenge for both Sunshine State teams, whose salary cap situations make a long-term commitment difficult to structure.The Carolina Hurricanes and Los Angeles Kings offer more cap flexibility to accommodate an extension. The San Jose Sharks and Washington Capitals reportedly have the most appealing trade assets to send back to the Rangers.Mercogliano has noted that Panarin does not want to go the rental route, which narrows the field considerably. Rangers president and general manager Chris Drury faces limited leverage in negotiations, particularly if Panarin gives him only one team to work with.Letting a pending unrestricted free agent walk for nothing at the March 6 trade deadline would be a disastrous outcome for a team sitting last in the Eastern Conference at 22-28-6. Both sides would prefer a resolution before the freeze.But if Panarin's demands remain firm and the cap math doesn't add up, this saga could easily stretch into late February once the Olympic break ends.",Artemi panarin has been held out of the rangers' last three games. The winger is reportedly seeking roughly $50 million on what could be the final contract of his career.

Cooper Flagg’s historic three-game stretch

Flagg’s is stepping up amid Mavericks’ roster turmoil

Dallas Mavericks rookie Cooper Flagg just made another NBA record on Tuesday night by becoming the first teenager to drop three consecutive 30-point games. Despite Flagg’s 36-point outburst, the Dallas Mavericks fell 100-110 to the visiting Boston Celtics at the American Airlines Center. The 19-year-old phenom continues to rewrite the rookie record books, surpassing various rookie records set by LeBron James and Luka Doncic.Flagg’s historic night against the Celtics saw him clock in 37 minutes on the court, while finishing the match with 36 points, 9 rebounds, 6 assists, and 2 blocks. He also shot at an efficiency of 50.0%, converting 12-of-24 from the field and 2-of-4 from three-point range. While the Mavericks are struggling with a five-game losing streak, Flagg’s individual brilliance as a teenager on the court continues to reach unprecedented heights.Flagg’s current scoring tear with 20.1 points, 6.7 rebounds, 4.2 assists, and a 48.4% efficiency from the field is statistically among the greatest rookie spans in NBA’s history. In his last three outings, Flagg has averaged a staggering 39.7 points, 10.3 rebounds, and 4.7 assists.This stretch of staggering performances began with Flagg’s career-high of 49 points against the Charlotte Hornets on January 29, followed by a 34-point double-double against the Houston Rockets, and the recent 36 points against the Boston Celtics.During the last three-game window, Flagg also showcased an elite shooting efficiency, 57.7% from the floor, 46.2% from beyond the arc, and 85.2% from the free-throw line.The Mavericks’ front office’s intention since winning the draft lottery despite the 1.8% chance has been clear: draft Duke’s Cooper Flagg and build a contender-worthy team around him.Since getting drafted, Copper’s need on the court increased exponentially as the Mavericks navigated through the injuries of their veteran core. With Kyrie Irving still recovering from a long-term ACL injury and Anthony Davis sidelined with a hand injury since early January, the No. 1 overall pick has effectively transitioned into the focal point of the Dallas offense.But with a 6-foot-9 height and 7-foot wingspan, Flagg’s impact is not just limited to scoring. He led the Mavericks in both total points (926) and steals per game (1.2). Following Tuesday's loss to Boston, Dallas head coach Jason Kidd said, “Cooper was incredible,” while also highlighting his impressive scoring ability and playmaking skills for his teammates.","Dallas mavericks rookie cooper flagg just made another nba record by becoming the first teenager to drop three consecutive 30-point games.

A Leon Edwards video clip emerges mocking Ian Garry after losing to Shavkat Rakhmonov



Ian Machado Garry is currently receiving the end of criticism from fans. after his recent remarks on Shavkat Rakhmonov. Rakhmonov's injury forced him out of the welterweight rankings. The Irishman chose to mock the unbeaten fighter. But with him taking shots at the Kazakh fighter, Garry once received similar treatment from a former UFC welterweight champion.The athlete rankings have undergone some significant changes following the end of UFC 325 last weekend. However, the changes that came in the welterweight division are not because of any fight results; it’s because of Shavkat Rakhmonov‘s removal from the list. Although many were surprised by his choice, Garry viewed it as a chance to troll Rakhmonov. But with that, an ex-champion’s clip of taking harsh shots at ‘The Future’ also emerged.As soon as Shavkat Rakhmonov got eliminated from the UFC welterweight rankings, Ian Garry took to social media to tease him. Garry wrote on X, “He (Shavkat) was eliminated at our title eliminator.” Although the Irishman was the one who lost against Rakhmonov at UFC 310, he has a different perspective.With his remarks, discussions are circulating on social media; fans reemerged with one of former UFC welterweight champion Leon Edwards’ remarks about Garry’s defeat to Rakhmonov.“Ian’s biggest achievement in this sport is losing to Shavkat, and that’s a fact,” said Edwards during a 2025 interview with Ariel Helwani. “I mean, that’s his greatest achievement that he can brag that he didn’t get finished. I mean, that doesn’t work for me and my plans; it doesn’t. If it comes, it comes; if it doesn’t, it doesn’t.”It appears that fans resurfaced Edwards' comment to emphasize how Garry can take pride in his match against Rakhmonov, despite being on the losing side. Although the reason may not be entirely accurate, it still has a resemblance to Garry's perspective on fights against the Kazakh fighter. Rakhmonov’s drop from the UFC rankings is due to his injuries, which have hindered his return to the octagon. ‘The Future’ has been active and has already fought two times after that. And now, as it seems, he is eyeing a fight against the welterweight champion.",Ex-ufc champion’s mockery of ian garry reignites following shavkat rakhmonov's ranking exit.

What did Mike Macdonald say about Sam Darnold injury?

As Super Bowl LX draws near, Seahawks fans can breathe easier after an encouraging injury update for quarterback Sam Darnold from head coach Mike Macdonald. Darnold has been managing an oblique issue but appears ready to lead the Seattle Seahawks against the New England Patriots on February 8 at Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, California.Darnold first suffered the oblique strain during practice ahead of the NFC Divisional Round, but he did not miss a game because of it. In fact, he played through the injury in the Seahawks’ dominant 41-6 win over the San Francisco 49ers and the 31-27 NFC Championship victory over the Los Angeles Rams key performances that sent Seattle to the Super Bowl.Macdonald has given several updates on Darnold’s condition in recent days, suggesting the injury is not a major concern. The coach said the 28-year-old “is in a great spot” with his oblique and confident heading into the final game. Macdonald also noted that the Seahawks have gradually increased Darnold’s work in practices, although he has been limited at times.Earlier in the playoffs, Darnold’s throwing was restricted in practice sessions as he continued to recover. Macdonald said at that time that the team was monitoring his reps and progressing day by day, but there was no indication that the injury would stop him from playing.Despite limited practice repetitions, his playoff play has remained strong. Against the Rams, he threw for 346 yards and three touchdowns, guiding the Seahawks to a hard-fought win in the NFC Championship Game. His performance showed that the injury had little to no impact on his ability to play at a high level when it mattered most.With an extra week between the NFC Championship and Super Bowl, Darnold has had additional time to continue strengthening his oblique. There is strong confidence within the Seahawks organisation that he will be able to perform effectively in the championship game. Coaches and team officials have described his recovery as tracking well, and he is expected to be near full strength for the big game.Fans have noticed how Darnold has handled adversity this season. After earlier injury concerns, he has shown toughness and resilience, bouncing back to deliver impressive performances during the playoffs. That mental and physical strength has become one of the defining stories of his season.As the Seahawks fine-tune their preparations for Super Bowl LX, the focus for Seattle will be on health and execution. With his oblique issue under control and key performances under his belt, Sam Darnold is expected to take the field and lead his team’s offence in what could be a career-defining moment.",Sam darnold has been managing an oblique issue but appears ready to lead the seattle seahawks against the new england patriots on february 8.

From airline stewardess to supportive partner

A lasting bond beyond Mickey Lolich’s baseball career

Joyce Fleenor was more than the woman next to Detroit Tigers pitcher Mickey Lolich. She was his companion through the highs and lows of a great baseball career, his anchor for more than sixty years. Fleenor married him in November 1964 and became a rock for the young left-hander who matured from a promising rookie into one of the most reliable pitchers in the majors.Mickey Lolich remains in the minds of generations of Tigers fans as the bulldog on the mound who carried Detroit to the top during the special summer of 1968. Behind all the glitz and glamour, though, his success is grounded in family. Every victory, every loss, Joyce Fleenor was there alongside him, molding the man behind the uniform, forging a partnership that lasted long after the last pitch was thrown.Joyce Fleenor led a life that had nothing to do with sports before she became known as the wife of a baseball star. Her high-flying California job as an airline stewardess was a marker of independence and also associated with self-assurance. Around this time, she met a young Mickey Lolich, just starting his path through the Tigers organisation. They became serious quickly, and the pair wed on November 21, 1964.The development of Lolich during those early years was crucial to the outcome of his career.Fleenor was a steadying presence during the adjustment to the demands of pro ball. Her calm personality tempered Lolich's intensity, friends and teammates noticed. This maturation was also attributed to the pitcher's wife, who helped him. They grew a family, three kids, while managing the day-to-day ins and outs of a Major League schedule.One of the highlights of Mickey Lolich's professional career came during the 1968 World Series, as he delivered one of the best postseason pitching performances in history. He won three games, including three complete games, and was named MVP as Detroit came back to beat the St. Louis Cardinals. While the spotlight focused on the mound, Joyce Fleenor participated in that victory because she shared in every step of the journey with her husband.In the late 70s, when Lolich retired from baseball, the couple opted for a more subdued life outside the stadiums. They continued to participate in the community and kept ties to Detroit, the town that had honored his success. Although Fleenor remained reclusive, he was a very family-oriented and charitable person.","Joyce fleenor was the wife of detroit tigers pitcher mickey lolich.

Avery MacNair’s Super Bowl 60 trip is built on two years of cancer fights

Terrell Williams’ cancer-free return gives the Patriots a different kind of win

When the New England Patriots run out for Super Bowl 60 on Sunday, one of the boldest play calls of the week will come from the stands, not the sideline. Fifteen-year-old Maine native and lifelong Patriots fan Avery MacNair, who has spent the last two years in treatment for leukemia, is in California on a Make-A-Wish trip and is already calling his shot. “Kayshon Boutte is probably going to have a 40-yard reception for a touchdown,” he said.His seat in the crowd comes in the same postseason that defensive coordinator Terrell Williams was declared cancer-free and cleared to travel with the team after a months-long battle with prostate cancer. Together, their stories turn New England’s Super Bowl run into something that cuts past schemes and matchups and into what this week means for people whose lives were on a very different line a few months ago.Make-A-Wish asked MacNair in 2023 what he wanted most. He did not pause. He wanted to go to the Super Bowl to see the Patriots. According to WABI and Gray News, setbacks in his treatment pushed the trip to this season, lining it up with New England’s unlikely charge to Santa Clara.MacNair has loved the sport for as long as he can remember. “I’ve always loved football,” he said. “I used to play it as a kid, and then, obviously after everything happened, I wasn’t able to play it really as much.”Treatment for leukemia took over the time that used to belong to youth games and backyard throws.He has had to learn how to compete without pads. “It’s just very important to keep your mind strong and keep your head up,” MacNair said. That is not poster-line optimism. That is a teenager trying to talk himself through hospital days and uncertainty while still staying locked into every Patriots snap.When he found out his wish was finally going to be granted, New England had not even clinched its Super Bowl spot. The news came before the Patriots beat the Denver Broncos in the AFC Championship Game, which turned the night into something close to torture. “I thought they were going to lose,” MacNair said. “During the end, I didn’t think they were going to pull it out, but they did. When Christian Gonzalez got the interception, that was nice. ”Now he gets the full week in California with his brother, Skylar, before watching his favorite team play in person for the first time. His view of the matchup is not sentimental. It is football-brain practical. “Probably be a defensive game, so 17-23, probably, hopefully, the Pats,” he said. Then came the Boutte prediction, the kind of call that could make a Super Bowl memory permanent if it hits.If Kayshon Boutte really does break free for a 40-yard score, it will count as a big moment for New England’s passing game. It will also turn a kid from Maine into the fan who called it first while he was still in a fight most adults never have to face.On the other side of the field from MacNair’s seat, Williams is living out his own version of borrowed time. The 51-year-old coordinator was diagnosed with prostate cancer in September, shortly after the Patriots’ Week 1 loss to the Las Vegas Raiders. He thought he had a stomach bug until head coach Mike Vrabel pushed him to see the training staff, which led to urgent tests and a diagnosis that reset his life.“We all thought I had a stomach flu, which I did. But as they were doing tests, that’s when they found out about the cancer,” Williams said. “I mean, thank God that I had the stomach flu because if I didn’t, I would have been business as usual.”Williams stepped away from full-time duties and started chemotherapy at Massachusetts General Hospital. Inside linebackers coach Zak Kuhr took over play-calling, but the coordinator refused to disappear. He showed up to meetings when he could. He stayed on the text threads. Players and coaches wore “T-Strong” shirts. The defense kept his voice in the room even when his body could not be on the sideline.Kuhr knows exactly what that presence meant. “It means everything in the world,” he said. “He’s a great friend. He’s a great mentor. I consider him family. And for him to power through that, man. That’s bigger than being here right now, for sure.”Linebacker K’Lavon Chaisson watched his coordinator walk into rooms looking like a man who refused to let illness dictate how he carried himself. “I feel like he never lost it,” Chaisson said. “He still had the charismatic energy and kept a smile on his face, he kept being positive. You wouldn’t be able to know anything was going on with him. I appreciated everything that he showed throughout the process.”Williams was declared cancer-free three weeks ago, just before New England’s divisional-round win over the Houston Texans. The team found out in a meeting that quickly turned from game-planning to relief. The news also cleared him to travel for the first time all season. This week in Santa Clara is not only his first Super Bowl as a coordinator. It is his first road trip with the Patriots since Week 1.The fight changed how he handles pain in front of his family and players. Growing up in South-Central Los Angeles, he was taught to swallow his feelings. Cancer forced him to do the opposite with his 13-year-old son, Tahj. “I would tell him that everything’s okay, but sometimes you just got to tell them the truth,” Williams said. “I would talk to him about having tough days. When you’re going through something and when it’s tough, you got to share with people, man. Because keeping that stuff in, that’s not the way to go.”Safety Jaylinn Hawkins saw the same thing at work inside the locker room. “He’s been a hell of a coach for us since he got here,” Hawkins said. “All that he was going through he still managed to show up for us and that’s special and that means a lot. Showing up for people is something I take serious. To see him showing up for our team the way he did regardless of what was going on was just amazing to me, and that just shows how much he loves and cares about us. ”Williams is honest about where he stands. The scans are clear, but he still has blood work scheduled every three months. “What I’ve learned is that you’re never really cancer-free,” he said. “I mean, it’s dormant… But I also know that there’s still a journey ahead because it’s like once you have cancer, you always have the threat of it coming back.”He has already cut out soda and alcohol and talks openly about how much this forced slowdown exposed the way coaches and players treat themselves like machines. “I realized that I needed a change in my life,” Williams said. “And sometimes things happen to you from a health standpoint, to slow you down. And that’s the way that I look at this. This cancer was unexpected. And sometimes… We live like we’re invincible. And when it happens to you, you realize you’re not invincible. So it was a wakeup call.”For Williams, this week is not about the stage. “Honestly, my thoughts are about the game and not really about me or the Super Bowl or anything,” he said. He insists this could be a preseason game and he would feel the same way, just grateful to be with his players again after a season spent in treatment rooms.","Avery macnair, 15, has spent the last two years in treatment for leukemia.

Allen’s Super Bowl mindset stays the same even after another painful playoff ending

Bills MVP QB Josh Allen talks Super Bowl pressure, Bond with Sam Darnold ahead of SB LX | FTF

Josh Allen will be sitting out Super Bowl LX as the Bills failed to come out on top, and that reality continues to sting for Buffalo. The Bills' star just won the 2024 NFL MVP award, adding to a growing list of records. Still, the one thing missing from his career is a Super Bowl appearance, which he still dreams about every day.In a recent appearance on a podcast, the QB revealed that his ultimate aim is to win the Super Bowl trophy, and he would never stop until he achieves it. Allen also revealed that despite the setbacks with the 2025 season, he does not dwell on it for long and instead prefers to focus on what’s next.Allen appeared on the First Things First podcast and spelled out his mission with no hesitation. “Every year, my goal is to go win a Super Bowl and bring a trophy back to Western New York. Obviously, the ultimate goal is to win a Super Bowl, and it takes so much throughout the season to get there and to go out and win it. And I’m going to keep working tirelessly until we get that opportunity to get it done.”He also explained that he tries not to obsess over outcomes because his love for the game is what keeps him going through the long grind of an NFL season.Since being drafted seventh overall in 2018, Allen has been the face of Buffalo’s rise. The Bills have reached the playoffs seven times with him as the starter, including two trips to the AFC Championship Game.For years, Kansas City was the wall Buffalo could not break through. That rivalry shaped Allen’s postseason story, from the 2020 AFC title loss to later playoff exits. This past season, the door looked more open after Patrick Mahomes’ injury changed the AFC landscape. Still, Buffalo’s run ended in the divisional round against the Denver Broncos.Allen did not dodge responsibility afterward during the press conference, saying, “I’d be lying to you if I’m sitting here saying that I feel like I had a part in it because if I make one more play, that game in Denver, we’re probably not having this press conference right now. The Bills lost 33-30, even though Allen threw for 283 yards and accounted for three touchdowns.","Josh allen just won the 2024 nfl mvp award.
