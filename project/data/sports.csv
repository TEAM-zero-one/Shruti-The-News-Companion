Shubman Gill story: From a remote village near the border to India’s Test captain

Poll Will the absence of Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli affect the team's performance? Yes, significantly No, the team is strong

FULL SQUAD:

NEW DELHI: The BCCI on Saturday announced a new-look Test squad for the upcoming five-match series against England, with 25-year-old Shubman Gill named as the new captain. The tour, which is part of the 2025–27 ICC World Test Championship cycle, will take place in England between June and August 2025, with matches scheduled at Headingley (Leeds), Edgbaston (Birmingham), Lord’s (London), Old Trafford (Manchester), and The Oval (London).This series marks the beginning of a new chapter for Indian Test cricket following the recent retirements of senior stalwarts Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli.With Rohit stepping away from Test cricket earlier this month, Shubman was widely tipped to take over the leadership role. A consistent performer in all formats and already seen as a long-term prospect, the young opener will now lead the team in one of its most challenging overseas assignments.Wicketkeeper-batter Rishabh Pant has been appointed as Gill’s deputy. India have included two wicketkeepers in the squad — Pant and promising youngster Dhruv Jurel.Star pacer Jasprit Bumrah returns to the squad after a back injury that ruled him out of action for nearly three months, including India’s victorious ICC Champions Trophy 2025 campaign.Also See: India Test Squad Announcement The 18-member squad features three prominent inclusions — Karun Nair, Arshdeep Singh, and Sai Sudharsan — all rewarded for their stellar performances in domestic cricket.This is a maiden call-up for both Sudharsan and Arshdeep.Karun, who famously scored a triple century against England in 2016, makes a comeback after last playing a Test in 2017. The right-hander was prolific in the 2024–25 domestic season, scoring 863 runs in nine Ranji Trophy matches with four centuries, and 779 runs in eight Vijay Hazare Trophy innings, including five centuries.Nair, already part of the India A setup, is expected to play a key role during the England tour.With Mohammed Shami missing out due to injury, the selectors have reinforced the pace unit. The attack will be led by Bumrah and Mohammed Siraj, and also features Prasidh Krishna, Akash Deep, Arshdeep Singh, Reddy, and Shardul Thakur — offering a mix of experience and youth suited for English conditions.In the spin department, Ravindra Jadeja and Washington Sundar have been included as all-round options, while Kuldeep Yadav has been named the lone specialist spinner.Ahead of the main series, India will play two India ‘A’ matches against the England Lions, with the first game scheduled for May 30 at the St. Lawrence Ground in Canterbury.Rohit Sharma officially retired from Test cricket on May 7, bringing down the curtain on an illustrious 11-year career. He played 67 Tests, scoring 4,301 runs at an average of 40.57, with 12 centuries and 18 fifties.Virat Kohli, too, bid adieu to the longest format earlier this month. The former India captain leaves behind a legendary legacy in red-ball cricket, having played 123 Tests and scored 9,230 runs at an average of 46.85, including 30 centuries and 31 half-centuries. He retires as India’s fourth-highest run-scorer in Tests.Shubman Gill (c), Rishabh Pant (wk/vc), Yashasvi Jaiswal, KL Rahul, Sai Sudharsan, Abhimanyu Easwaran, Karun Nair, Nitish Kumar Reddy, Ravindra Jadeja, Dhruv Jurel (wk), Washington Sundar, Shardul Thakur, Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Siraj, Prasidh Krishna, Akash Deep, Arshdeep Singh, Kuldeep Yadav.","India announce new-look test squad for upcoming five-match series against england. 25-year-old shubman gill named as the new captain.

Detroit Pistons’ Perspective

Themight pull off one of the most surprising moves of the NBA offseason by acquiringsuperstarin a massive three-team trade involving the Detroit Pistons.This proposed deal, as detailed by Colin Keane of Sporting News , would reshape the futures of all three franchises while keeping the Boston Celtics competitive despite Jayson Tatum’s absence in the 2025-26 season.(Disclaimer: The information and analysis presented in this article are based on current speculations. While the details are sourced from credible insights, it’s important to note that these are not confirmed moves or official statements. Readers are encouraged to take this analysis with a grain of salt and stay tuned for official updates as the offseason unfolds.)Here’s how the trade would unfold according to Colin Keane:Losing Jayson Tatum for a season would typically cripple a team, but adding Stephen Curry ensures the Boston Celtics remain playoff contenders. The new-look backcourt of Curry and Derrick White, alongside Jrue Holiday and Al Horford, keeps the core strong.A potential 2025-26 rotation could look like this:- Starters: Derrick White, Stephen Curry, Jrue Holiday, Al Horford, Luke Kornet- Bench: Payton Pritchard, Sam Hauser, Xavier Tillman, Neemias QuetaWhen Jayson Tatum returns in 2026-27, the Celtics would have a championship-ready trio of White, Curry, and Tatum. Plus, Curry’s expiring contract in 2027 opens up cap space for another star.As Keane notes, ""Curry’s star power would keep TD Garden packed, a priority for ownership without Tatum.""The Golden State Warriors would finally embrace a rebuild, moving on from their aging core. Jaylen Brown becomes the new franchise cornerstone, while Jaden Ivey offers All-Star potential if healthy.Key benefits for Golden State:- Kristaps Porzingis and Tobias Harris provide expiring contract flexibility.- Isaiah Stewart adds much-needed size and toughness.- Retaining Jonathan Kuminga creates a dynamic wing duo with Brown. Detroit Pistons lands Jimmy Butler to pair with Cade Cunningham, Ausar Thompson, and Jalen Duren—immediately boosting their playoff chances.Potential 2025-26 lineup:- Guards: Cade Cunningham, Tim Hardaway Jr./Malik Beasley- Wings: Jimmy Butler, Ausar Thompson- Big: Jalen DurenLosing Ivey and Harris isn’t a major setback, as both are on expiring deals.

Auston Matthews and his fans got emotional as his mother opened up about the financial struggles of getting him into hockey,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/auston-matthews-and-his-fans-got-emotional-as-his-mother-opened-up-about-the-financial-struggles-of-getting-him-into-hockey/articleshow/121166477.cms,"Image credit - Paige Taylor White/CP

Auston Matthews’ hockey dream wasn’t cheap and his mom took the weight

“I used to work in the morning for Starbucks, in the afternoon the restaurant, i was very fortunate to have two jobs. And believe me, if they would have more hours, I would have more jobs.""

Before Auston Matthews was an NHL superstar, his biggest supporter was clocking into two jobs, trying to make ends meet. His mom, Ema Matthews, didn’t just believe in his dream, she bankrolled it, penny by penny, from behind a Starbucks counter. For families without deep pockets, hockey can be financially brutal. But Ema’s resilience turned obstacles into opportunity and her son into one of the league’s brightest stars. Her story is the heartwarming reminder that every great athlete often has a real-life superhero cheering from the sidelines, sacrificing, hustling, and holding it all together so their child can chase the impossible.Ice time, gear, coaching, travel, youth hockey isn’t just a sport, it’s a financial beast. For the Matthews family, especially with Ema being originally from Hermosillo, Mexico, the culture and cost of the sport were both daunting. But she took on the challenge without hesitation, picking up multiple jobs including a gig at Starbucks to ensure Auston never missed a chance to grow on the ice.Ema shared in a past interview that the cost of hockey often reached up to $20,000 a year, a heavy ask for any middle-class family. To make it work, she didn’t just cut corners, she picked up shifts and poured lattes while helping Auston stay focused on the sport. She even deposited small amounts of money in his account so he could grab food with teammates like a regular teen. Beyond that, Ema often drove long hours to tournaments, handled equipment costs, and juggled bills, all to ensure Auston had every chance to chase his dreams without added stress.Ema’s story also breaks stereotypes. In a sport dominated by players from Canada and northern U.S. states, Auston’s rise as a player of Mexican heritage makes his success even more impactful. It's not just about talent, it’s about trailblazing, especially for kids of color or immigrant families who rarely see themselves represented in hockey.Auston Matthews is one of the Toronto Maple Leafs’ biggest stars and a face of the NHL. He’s not just known for his goal-scoring skills but also for his poise and work ethic, traits his mom likely helped instill. While fans celebrate his success on the ice, stories like Ema’s remind us of the sacrifices behind the scenes that made it possible.Ema Matthews’ story shows what’s possible when love, grit, and hustle lead the way.Also read - “From baptism to strip club”: Pete Blackburn’s unhinged NHL comparison is going viral and fans totally get it","Auston matthews is one of the toronto maple leafs’ biggest stars and a face of the nhl.

Monaco Qualifying race results

Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc, who dominated all three free practice sessions in Monaco, came close to securing pole position in the Monaco Grand Prix qualifying session. However, McLaren’s Lando Norris pulled off a stunning lap to steal pole at the last moment, setting the fastest ever lap of Monaco with a time of 1m 09.954s on Saturday. Leclerc had to settle for second on the grid, while McLaren’s Oscar Piastri secured third place.Lewis Hamilton showed significant improvement in his Ferrari and qualified fourth. Red Bull’s Max Verstappen, despite showing early promise, struggled later in the session and could only manage fifth place, finishing just behind Hamilton — a rare occurrence this season.Traffic once again proved to be a major factor on the narrow streets of Monaco, where overtaking is notoriously difficult. This makes the starting grid critically important for Sunday’s race. The fight for pole was intensely competitive, with positions constantly changing among McLaren's Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri, Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc and Lewis Hamilton, and Red Bull’s Max Verstappen.Mercedes endured a disappointing session. Neither George Russell nor Kimi Antonelli managed to complete qualifying. Antonelli hit the barriers at the Nouvelle Chicane and retired, while Russell's car suffered a sudden power failure in the tunnel, bringing out the red flags.The cause of the failure remains unclear.Among the standout performances in Saturday’s qualifying was Isack Hadjar of Racing Bulls, who finished sixth. He was followed by Aston Martin’s Fernando Alonso in seventh, after the team's new technical director made his first appearance at a race this season a day before.Three other drivers who deserve recognition include Haas’s Esteban Ocon, who qualified eighth; Racing Bulls’ Liam Lawson, who finished ninth; and Alexander Albon, who rounded out the top ten.

NFL players take a major pay cut during the playoffs—even the superstars

How NFL Contracts ACTUALLY Work | Games With Names

Brock Purdy's big contract strikes a chord with Edelman

When fans watch NFL stars like Tom Brady or Patrick Mahomes dominate in the playoffs, most assume they're pocketing millions for every throw, every touchdown, every win. But as former New England Patriots wide receiver Julian Edelman recently explained, that assumption couldn’t be further from the truth.Appearing on the Games with Names podcast, Edelman peeled back the curtain on how playoff compensation works in the NFL. Unlike the regular season, where paychecks are determined by massive contracts and performance bonuses, postseason pay is a fixed structure. Everyone—from the franchise quarterback to the backup kicker—earns the same per game, regardless of their regular-season salary.“For the first round you’d get like twenty grand, twenty-five grand to the winner,” Edelman shared. “The next round, you’d get like an additional thirty grand. We would get the first-round bye, do the same amount of work, and not get paid. It was only twenty grand, but I was making like one hundred grand at the time.”That pay gap becomes even more jarring when you look at elite quarterbacks like Brady and Mahomes. “Tom Brady usually gets $2 million a game,” Edelman explained. “He’s going to play for $20,000. Patrick Mahomes is getting $50 million a year, and now he’s getting twenty grand, thirty grand… Same as the long snapper.”The league’s playoff pay system, though controversial among players, does reinforce one unique NFL value: team unity. “Everyone in the organization earns the same amount of money for playoff games,” Edelman pointed out. For trainers, assistant coaches, and lesser-known players, the extra checks are meaningful, even if they seem like a rounding error for top-tier stars.Edelman also took a moment to celebrate 49ers quarterback Brock Purdy’s new five-year, $265 million deal. As a fellow seventh-round pick, Edelman knows the grind of proving oneself.“As a former player, you always like to see guys get paid,” he said. “Especially a guy that went his route. I was a seventh-round guy, he’s a seventh-round guy. Now he’s making $54 million per year.”Also Read: Tom Brady risks it all at Indy 500: NFL legend trades football fame for 200 mph thrill ride with Jimmie Johnson Purdy’s new contract averages nearly $3 million per week—a staggering rise from the $2.6 million total he earned in his first three seasons.

Steelers need to end Aaron Rodgers dream and chase a realistic quarterback solution before camp begins



Why are the Steelers STILL Waiting on Aaron Rodgers? | James Skrmetta Reacts

As the NFL world waits for Aaron Rodgers’ next move, the Pittsburgh Steelers remain in a holding pattern. Team president Art Rooney II recently told ESPN that they plan to wait ""a little while longer"" for Rodgers’ decision—a familiar stance he echoed more than a month ago. But beneath the surface of patience lies a deeper reality: Rodgers to Pittsburgh might make for compelling headlines, but it’s a move that could derail more than it could deliver.On paper, Aaron Rodgers signing with the Steelers would be “absolute cinema.” Imagine a future Hall of Famer attempting to resurrect his career with a storied franchise starved for playoff relevance. The Steelers, after all, have gone eight years without a postseason victory. They finished 10-3 last season only to collapse down the stretch, losing five straight—including a bruising playoff exit against Baltimore where they allowed 299 rushing yards. The logic? Plug Rodgers into an already competitive roster, add a receiver he’s comfortable with, and make a deep postseason run.It sounds like a Hollywood script. But the NFL isn’t scripted, and this move comes with layers of complication.Rodgers’ ability to turn a game on its head hasn’t vanished entirely—his touchdown pass to Garrett Wilson last season served as a dazzling reminder. Yet moments of brilliance were overshadowed by inconsistency and visible signs of decline. The same quarterback who delivered an MVP campaign in 2021 looked hesitant and off-rhythm in stretches last year. A mid-season loss to Pittsburgh saw him picked off twice by then-rookie Beanie Bishop Jr. , a sign of how erratic his play can be under pressure.And let’s not forget, this is a quarterback entering his age-42 season, fresh off a major Achilles injury. His trademark mobility—the element that made him lethal—has faded. Steelers fans saw how Ben Roethlisberger’s final seasons unfolded: the body slowed, the offense stagnated, and a living legend gradually became a liability. Rodgers, it seems, is on a similar trajectory.Rodgers isn’t just a quarterback—he’s a media magnet. Every appearance on the Pat McAfee Show will make headlines. Every sideline interaction will be scrutinized. For a franchise known for its discipline and unity under Mike Tomlin, the Rodgers spotlight might bring more distraction than direction.Then there's the impact on internal development. Young talents like Will Howard—a promising college national champion—and Mason Rudolph, who ended last season on a high note, deserve a real opportunity. Bringing in Rodgers essentially pushes both down the pecking order, sending a message that name recognition trumps offseason effort and chemistry. That’s not just demoralizing—it’s destabilizing.Even if Aaron Rodgers returns to form, Pittsburgh would still need a lot to go right. The offensive line, though improving, is young. The receiving corps lacks a proven No. 2 option to pair with DK Metcalf. And defensively, the unit that crumbled late last season must take a major step forward.Let’s be honest—2025 is shaping up to be a transitional season. With a treasure chest of draft capital in 2026, the Steelers are likely viewing this year as an experiment: a chance to test the roster’s ceiling before going all-in on a long-term quarterback solution. In that light, signing Rodgers becomes more of a stunt than a strategy.There’s no denying Rodgers brings intrigue, experience, and the potential for one last great chapter. But the Steelers are chasing stability, not spectacle. A franchise that has prided itself on consistency and calculated decisions doesn’t need to gamble on a quarterback whose best days are behind him—no matter how legendary he is.In the end, the Steelers’ path forward likely lies not in the past greatness of Aaron Rodgers, but in the untapped potential of the next generation.Also Read: Should Tom Brady unretire to lead Team USA in flag football at the 2028 Olympics?

CAN RCB STILL MAKE THE TOP TWO?

NEW DELHI: Royal Challengers Bengaluru squandered a golden opportunity to seal a top-two finish in the IPL 2025 standings, falling to a 42-run defeat against Sunrisers Hyderabad on Friday. Chasing a daunting 232-run target—powered by Ishan Kishan’s scintillating unbeaten 94 off 48 balls—RCB needed a precise and aggressive approach with the bat.They found initial momentum through Phil Salt (62 off 32), Virat Kohli (43 off 25), and Jitesh Sharma (24 off 15), but the chase eventually fizzled out as the visitors were bowled out for 189. The loss marked RCB's first away defeat this season.RCB’s reply began brightly with Kohli and Salt racing to 80 in the first seven overs. Kohli, recently retired from Test cricket, led the early charge—hammering two fours off Harshal Patel and launching a swatted six off Eshan Malinga.However, his familiar weakness against left-arm spin resurfaced, as he was dismissed by 22-year-old Harsh Dubey—Ranji Trophy 2024-25’s leading wicket-taker for champions Vidarbha. This marked the 22nd time Kohli has fallen to left-arm spin in T20s.Salt, meanwhile, overcame a slow start—scoring 14 off his first 12 balls—to blast 48 runs in the next 20.A tennis-style forehand six off Nitish Kumar Reddy stood out for its flair. He reached his half-century in 27 balls but was soon hampered by cramps and dismissed by Pat Cummins.Despite consistent boundaries on a true pitch, RCB's innings unraveled in the latter half. Skipper Rajat Patidar (18) and Jitesh stitched a brisk 44-run stand for the fourth wicket, taking the side to 173/3 in the 16th over. But a calamitous mix-up resulted in Patidar being run out by a long margin. In the same over, Malinga dismissed Romario Shepherd for a golden duck, triggering a collapse.Jitesh, along with Tim David—who appeared to suffer a hamstring injury—departed within nine deliveries, and the fight drained out of RCB. They lost their final seven wickets for just 60 runs as Cummins (3/28) and Malinga (2/37) spearheaded SRH's bowling effort.The defeat sees RCB drop to third place with 17 points, behind Gujarat Titans (18) and Punjab Kings (17), with their net run rate taking a hit.The loss significantly complicates their top-two ambitions. Even a win in their final league game might not be enough—they now depend on other results to fall in their favour to secure a top-two finish.","Royal challengers bengaluru squandered a golden opportunity to seal a top-two finish in the ipl 2025 standings.

WWE Superstar Zoey Stark made her comeback to the limelight in a tragic manner on the recent episode of Monday Night RAW. What was supposed to be a critical milestone in her career, Stark got severely injured in her knee in a triple-threat qualifying match for the 2025 Women's Money in the Bank (MITB) ladder match. The incident has not only sidelined her from one of WWE’s most prestigious events but may also signal a prolonged absence from in-ring competition.The accident occurred at the Bon Secours Wellness Arena in Greenville, South Carolina, during a MITB qualifier bout between Zoey Stark, Kairi Sane, and Rhea Ripley. At its climax, Stark tried her characteristic springboard dropkick—a sportslike move that requires agility and accuracy. In targeting Kairi Sane, Stark slipped in executing the springboard, resulting in her awkwardly landing on her right leg.The blow caused her knee to bend in a distinctly unnatural manner, quite visibly startling both supporters and commentators. The match instantly became secondary as paramedics rushed onto the field to treat the hurt athlete. After the botched maneuver, Stark fell to the floor, cradling her right knee and exhibiting obvious signs of pain and distress. The referee stopped the match for a moment and motioned for medical attention. WWE ringside physicians made their way into the ring and evaluated her condition.Despite the extent of the injury, Stark first tried to leave the ring independently. She tried to stand, only to fall again, as she could no longer bear the weight of herself. Eventually, she was assisted backstage by medical personnel, affirming the severity of the ordeal.Veteran WWE play-by-play commentator Michael Cole guessed on-air that Stark may have re-aggravated an old injury. Stark had extensive knee surgery in 2021 to repair a torn ACL, MCL, and meniscus—injuries requiring months of rehabilitation.With the visual similarity and reaction of Stark, there is an increasing fear that her current injury is a recurrence or exacerbation of the same condition of the knee. But to date, WWE has not issued a formal medical diagnosis or recovery timeline. The wrestling fraternity came in support of Stark after the injury. AEW wrestler Thunder Rosa showed her concern with a heartfelt post on social media:""Wrestling is a lovely and risky sport. We leave everything on the table every time we go to the ring, and we also put a lot on the line when we do what we are passionate about. Zoey Stark, I love you, sister, and I hope that you heal soon."" — Thunder Rosa through X (previously Twitter)Zoey Stark's RAW match was her first on television since January. She had last remained an active member of the dissolved faction Pure Fusion Collective, after Sonya Deville and Shayna Baszler left. Stark was competing mainly in non-televised WWE house shows and sporadic Main Event tapings before this return.As a result of her earlier knee damage incurred during her stint in NXT, Stark was drafted to the main roster as part of the 2023 WWE Draft—a testament to how much the WWE believed in her promising future. The MITB qualifier was set to be a career-launching experience, which made her untimely injury so much more heartbreaking.With Stark out, the match went on between the remaining participants. Rhea Ripley took advantage of the situation, overpowering Kairi Sane and finishing the match with her characteristic Riptide finisher. The pinfall win earned Ripley a spot in the upcoming ladder match for Women's Money in the Bank, which is to be held on June 7. Ripley’s victory, however, was overshadowed by the concern surrounding Stark’s health, as WWE fans and analysts alike shifted focus to the severity of the injury.The extent of Stark’s injury remains unconfirmed by WWE, leaving her return date unknown. Given her history of severe knee damage, fans and medical experts fear that she could face another lengthy recovery process. This injury not only removes her from one of WWE’s most career-defining matches but also risks stalling the momentum she had just begun to regain. For now, Zoey Stark’s fans—and the WWE Universe as a whole—await official word from WWE’s medical team.",Wwe superstar zoey stark suffers a painful knee injury during mitb qualifier bout.

The BCCI on Saturday announced Shubman Gill as the new captain of the Indian Test team for the upcoming five-match Test series against England. Wicketkeeper-batter Rishabh Pant has been named vice-captain. This comes after Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli and Ravichandran Ashwin confirmed their retirement from the longest format.Chairman of selectors Ajit Agarkar addressed a press conference after the squad announcement. He confirmed that Virat Kohli had conveyed to the BCCI in April that he no longer wished to play Test cricket.“He has played for a long time. He felt he couldn’t give to Test cricket what he has so far. So we respected that. That’s why he wasn’t picked,” Agarkar said.Rohit Sharma, had also communicated his decision to step away from the format. “When we picked the squad, we got the information that Rohit was not going to continue. So it made our job easier,” Agarkar stated.Asked why Jasprit Bumrah was not made captain despite leading in England earlier, Agarkar said, “Just trying to manage his workload. Five Test matches. Don’t want to burden him with other things.”Agarkar also confirmed KL Rahul’s return to the Test team but ruled out any leadership role for him. “KL has just returned. We didn’t really consider that. We felt Gill is the right guy.”The chairman explained the rationale behind naming Gill as captain. “We felt he is someone who can take the team forward. Every decision is a unanimous one when selectors sit. He has been with the team for a while. Every guy takes some time to settle.”Agarkar clarified that the playing XI decisions will be left to the team management. “The team management will sit with the captain and coach and decide the playing XI. That’s how it should be.”Asked about the presence of multiple openers in the squad, including Jaiswal, Sudharsan, Easwaran and Gill, Agarkar responded: “Let the team management decide who plays where. There are a couple of options. Only 11 can play. Some players will miss out.”Agarkar also responded to a query on including Rishabh Pant as vice-captain despite his recent return. “He’s been with the team for a while. We felt it was the right time. There’s a lot of experience in the team.”Quiz: Who's that IPL player? On Mohammed Shami’s absence, Agarkar said, “He’s not fit. He was part of the WTC final but then had a setback. The medical team has not cleared him. Workload is not where it should be. He will hopefully be back soon.”About the presence of multiple all-rounders, including Washington Sundar and Nitish Kumar Reddy, Agarkar said, “There are five Tests, that’s why you need options. There are some India A performances. Some roles might be different. If you play one spinner or three seamers, you need backup.”On whether this squad represents a transition, Agarkar remarked, “You don’t look at it that way. Some guys have made themselves unavailable. That’s why you have to move forward. Some of these guys have performed for India A or domestically. There’s no transition; this is the best squad we picked.”On the inclusion of Kuldeep Yadav, Agarkar said, “We wanted two spinners. He’s been bowling well. If you’re going to play two, we felt Kuldeep and Jadeja are the two.”Regarding Karun Nair’s return, Agarkar said, “He has got runs in the last season. There are only so many slots in the middle order.”Agarkar said there was no communication gap with any player. “All the players have been informed. That’s how selection works. Some players will miss out. That doesn’t mean they’ve done anything wrong.”The full squad: Shubman Gill (captain), Rishabh Pant (vice-captain and wicketkeeper), Yashasvi Jaiswal, KL Rahul, Sai Sudharsan, Abhimanyu Easwaran, Karun Nair, Nitish Kumar Reddy, Ravindra Jadeja, Dhruv Jurel (wicketkeeper), Washington Sundar, Shardul Thakur, Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Siraj, Prasidh Krishna, Akash Deep, Arshdeep Singh, Kuldeep Yadav.","The bcci on saturday announced shubman gill as the new captain of the indian test team.

Poll Who was the standout player for Sunrisers Hyderabad in their match against RCB? Ishan Kishan Heinrich Klaasen Travis Head Pat Cummins

Sunrisers Hyderabad took to the pitch on Friday knowing well that a win will not change their standing in the table. The game however, had the potential to help Royal Challengers Bengaluru solidify their claim to booking a top-two spot ahead of the playoffs. Travis Head and Abhshek Sharma opened the game for SRH, although the RCB bowling attack took their wickets before either of them could put up a dangerous score on the board.Travis Head was dismissed for 17 by Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Abhishek Sharma fell at 34 thanks, after being caught by Phil Salt from a Lungi Ngidi delivery. While RCB mustered confidence from their dismissals, along came Ishan Kishan to spoil the party. A man down, Kishan did spectacularly well, as he dispatched boundary after boundary in the balls that followed.His tailblazing 94 from just 48 deliveries changed the game for Sunrisers as they put up a massive 231 runs on the board. Besides Kishan, Heinrich Klaasen and Aniket Verman put up brilliant cameos, adding another 50 runs in just 22 balls for SRH. Nitish Kumar Reddy, Abhinav Manohar and Pat Cummins also featured for SRH at the crease as they put up a total RCB had never chased before in the IPL . 232 from 120 deliveries was 206/1 against the Gujarat Titans in 2024.RCB took to the crease with Virat Kohli and Phil Salt opening the chase. While Kohli showed intent early on with his boundaries, he was dismissed while at 43 by Harsh Dubey. His opening partner Phil Salt marhed on for a bit more, racking up 62 runs in 32 deliveries.However, his dismissal by Pat Cummins, followed by the successive wickets of Mayank Agarwal, Rajat Patidar and Jitesh Sharma marked the starting of RCB's collapse. What followed was Bengaluru wickets falling like dominoes; not a single player that came in afterwards stood at the crease for more than 6 balls. With victory in sight, SRH bowlers showed no mercy to RCB.The Jitesh Sharma led squad was bowled out at 189, earning SRH victory by 42 runs. The win does not affect SRH's position in the points table. They remain in 8th spot with 11 points, below Kolkata Knight Riders who have 12 in 13. As for RCB, their net run rate took a massive dive to +0.255, pushing them below Punjab Kings. Prior to the game on Friday, RCB were second, and a win would have put them closer to a top-two finish. Now, a win for PBKS and Mumbai Indians, who have 17 and 16 points respectively, will push them even more behind in the race for top-two.","Ishan kishan's impressive 94 from 48 paved the way for victory for srh vs rcb.

Poll Did RCB's batting collapse contribute significantly to their defeat? Yes, it was a major factor No, other factors played a role

Royal Challengers Bengaluru suffered a 42-run defeat against Sunrisers Hyderabad in Lucknow on Friday, missing their chance to secure a top-two finish in the IPL points table. The loss dropped RCB to third place with 17 points, behind Gujarat Titans (18) and Punjab Kings (17), significantly impacting their Net Run Rate while chasing SRH's imposing total of 232.Ishan Kishan's unbeaten 94 off 48 balls powered Sunrisers Hyderabad's innings, featuring seven fours and five sixes. His performance anchored the team's aggressive batting display.RCB's chase began promisingly with Phil Salt (62 off 32 balls) and Virat Kohli (43 off 25 balls) racing to 80 runs in seven overs. However, they ultimately fell short, managing only 189 before being dismissed.Kohli, who recently retired from Test cricket, showed early aggression against pacers before falling to left-arm spin for the 22nd time in his T20 career. Harsh Dubey, the leading wicket-taker in the 2024-25 Ranji Trophy season, claimed his wicket.Phil Salt overcame a slow start to accelerate impressively, scoring 48 runs in 20 balls and reaching his fifty in 27 deliveries. Cramps affected his mobility before Pat Cummins dismissed him.Rajat Patidar (18) and Jitesh Sharma (24) contributed a quick 44-run partnership for the fourth wicket, taking RCB to 173 for three in the 16th over.The momentum shifted after Patidar's run-out and Romario Shepherd's first-ball dismissal by Malinga. RCB's last seven wickets fell for just 60 runs, with Cummins (3/28) and Malinga (2/37) leading SRH's bowling attack.SRH's innings started explosively with Abhishek Sharma (34 off 17 balls) and Travis Head (17 off 10 balls) putting on 54 runs in four overs. Their partnership targeted RCB's new ball bowlers Yash Dayal and Bhuvneshwar Kumar.Bhuvneshwar Kumar conceded 18 runs in the second over, with Head and Abhishek hitting him for multiple boundaries. Abhishek's aggressive innings ended with a catch by Salt off Lungi Ngidi at square leg.Head's innings concluded shortly after, caught by Shepherd off Bhuvneshwar's knuckle ball. While other SRH batters fell to aggressive shots, Kishan maintained his composure throughout the innings.Kishan, who had been struggling since his century earlier in the tournament, displayed his batting prowess with controlled aggression. He reached his first fifty in ten innings off 28 balls, highlighted by a well-executed six off Bhuvneshwar in the final ball of the 18th over.The loss marked RCB's first away defeat of the season, despite their strong batting effort. The chase ultimately proved too challenging against SRH's disciplined bowling attack.SRH's total of 232 proved decisive in the match outcome, with their aggressive batting approach and Kishan's anchor role creating an imposing target. The victory reinforced their position in the tournament while dealing a significant blow to RCB's top-two aspirations.","Sunrisers hyderabad beat royal challengers bengaluru by 42 runs in ipl 2025.

Sai Sudharsan’s T20 Evolution: Where skill meets science | TOI Sports Exclusive

NEW DELHI: Shubman Gill is primed to take over from now-retired Rohit Sharma as India's Test captain, starting with the five-match Test series against England from June 20. He has led the national team in five T20I matches and won four of them. In the Indian Premier League he has been the skipper of Gujarat Titans in 25 matches now and won 14, losing 11. So, based purely on numbers, Gill doesn't necessarily build immediate trust.But his teammates speak highly of the 25-year-old. ""He has been great as a player and as a captain. The way he goes about his work is very calm. He understands the game very well. His communication is good, (which) good for us in the team as well,"" said GT's Sherfane Rutherford in an exclusive conversation with TimesofIndia.com.Rutherford has worked under Gill's leadership for 11 matches now and triumphed in eight of them. ""So for him, he has been doing well and as a team, we try to support him as much as we can and play our roles. And he's a very good player. He's going to be very important for us. Hopefully we can come together as a team and win the tournament,"" added the player from West Indies, with GT chasing the title in IPL 2025.""I think he reads the game very well. He's very humble. As a player that's so young, the way he handles an IPL franchise, he definitely has a good head on his shoulders. And he's a guy that communicates well. He wants the best for his players. And there's no doubt that he's going to be the next big player for India.The sentiments are similar to what Gujarat Titans assistant coach Aashish Kapoor had made for Gill. After GT's win against the Delhi Capitals, where the Fazilka-born player motored his innings fantastically, Kapoor spoke highly of not just his form but his leadership.""I have seen him from U-16. Actually, in NCA, I have done two camps with him. So from the U-16 age group, I have seen that he used to use his brains a lot more than a lot of other guys at his age. That is one quality that is needed to be a captain. Where you can use your brains for yourself and for 10 other people. How are you going to win matches? And we have seen this,"" said Kapoor.As things stand, Gujarat Titans are top of the IPL points table and despite the blip against Lucknow Super Giants, losing by 33 runs, they have a strong chance of finishing the league stage in the top-two. The fact that Royal Challengers Bengaluru also lost to an already eliminated team (Sunrisers Hyderabad) did help their cause as well.Concerningly for GT, their middle-order concerns were laid bare. In the 236-run chase, Gill (35), Sai Sudharsan (21) and Jos Buttler (33) departed with 96 runs on the scorecard. It left the onus on the scarcely tested middle order to get them past the finishing line - and fast. When Buttler departed, GT needed 140 runs from 10.3 overs. For a batting lineup whose depth had barely been tested, in large part to the prowess of the top-three, this was uncharted territory.Rutherford (38) and Shahrukh Khan (57) stitched an 86-run stand but when the former fell, it opened floodgates with 182/3 becoming 202/9 in the span of four overs.""Cricket is basically playing your roles. Yes, our top-three have been doing the job, which is good for us. But the thing for us - in the middle - is important for us to stay hungry. The good thing for us is that we have good preparation. We normally do practice games, even though we're not getting to bat in the middle,"" explained Rutherford.""The day before the game, we did a practice stimulation, which are things that as coaches, they try to do to keep us connected to the game and make sure that we are ready. And I think it's important for us as players to have the right mindset. We have been working hard and it's important to just trust what you have been doing and just go and give it your best,"" he added.Rutherford stressed on taking the ""learnings"" from the defeat after discussion within the group on what they could have done better. All those learnings will be tested for the last time in the group stage on Sunday (May 25) when they take on Chennai Super Kings at the relocated venue in Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad.","Gujarat titans skipper shubman gill is primed to take over from now-retired rohit sharma as india's test captain, starting with the five-match test series against england from june 20.

NEW DELHI: India head coach Gautam Gambhir has finally broken his silence on the high-profile retirements of Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli from Test cricket, calling it a personal choice and urging respect for their decisions.Speaking ahead of India’s five-Test tour of England, which begins on June 20 in Leeds, Gambhir addressed the vacuum left by the exit of two of India’s modern greats.“I think when you start the game and when you want to finish, it’s a very individual decision,” Gambhir said in an interview with CNN-News18. “No one has the right — be it the coach, the selector, or anyone in this country — to tell someone when to retire. It comes from within.”Both Rohit and Kohli stepped away from the longest format earlier this month, ending a chapter of Indian cricket that spanned over a decade.Though Gambhir admitted the team would miss their experience, he emphasised the opportunity this moment presents for the younger players. “Yes, it will be tough, but then there’ll be people putting their hands up for sure,” he said. “Someone missing out might give another person an opportunity to do something special for the country.”He cited India’s Champions Trophy win without Jasprit Bumrah as proof that the team can succeed despite the absence of senior names.As per reports, the BCCI is expected to announce the Test squad and India’s new red-ball captain on Saturday, with Gambhir and chief selector Ajit Agarkar addressing the media.","India head coach gautam gambhir has finally broken his silence on the high-profile retirements of rohit sharma and virat kohli from test cricket.

Though the two stars have made it a point to keep their relationship under wraps since the Super Bowl, a subtle remark by Kelce on his podcast New Heights might have dropped the biggest clue yet: they could be living together.During a recent episode of the podcast, Kelce, while chatting with his brother Jason and guest Ryan Fitzpatrick, casually mentioned his Florida offseason setup in Boca Raton. “We’ve got chimneys and we’ve got furniture,” he said, describing his temporary home. It was the word “we” that sparked an online frenzy. Swifties immediately picked up on it, interpreting the phrase as a quiet confirmation that Swift may be sharing the luxurious $20 million rental with him.Travis Kelce didn’t give away much more, but when asked who was in charge of home décor, he replied, “That’s an executive decision by myself for the betterment of everyone.” While playful, the comment left fans wondering whether someone else was helping create a cozy home atmosphere—someone with a knack for aesthetics and a history of romantic discretion.The mansion in question isn’t just any property. Nestled in an exclusive gated Boca Raton community, the estate reportedly includes six bedrooms, seven-and-a-half bathrooms, a private dock, wine cellar, home theater, and an opulent spa-style pool.With rent rumored to be around $100,000 per month, the setting is fit for pop royalty—and possibly a test run for future domestic life.Although Kelce and Swift have kept a low profile since the Kansas City Chiefs’ Super Bowl loss, this subtle shift toward privacy is not random. According to insiders, the duo has intentionally stepped away from the spotlight to focus on each other. A source told Life & Style, “It’s been a dream period that’s only solidified that they’re on the same page about their future.” The couple is reportedly even “amping up wedding discussions,” with another insider stating, “Travis is ‘the one,’ and Taylor is going to marry him. It’s just a matter of when.”Their recent public appearance—a rare outing in Philadelphia for a Mother’s Day brunch with Travis’ mom Donna Kelce, brother Jason, and sister-in-law Kylie—only deepened the intrigue. Fans who spotted them described Swift as relaxed and radiant, effortlessly blending in with the Kelce clan.Despite the swirling rumors, neither Swift nor Kelce has confirmed their living arrangement. Still, between the Boca Raton slip and insider whispers about future plans, it’s clear this isn’t just a casual fling. For two megastars balancing intense careers and public scrutiny, this quiet chapter may just be the foundation of something lasting.In a world obsessed with public displays and social media confessions, Swift and Kelce seem to be choosing something far more meaningful: privacy, intention, and perhaps, a shared home.Also Read: Offset escalates drama with diss track aimed at Cardi B and her new flame Stefon Diggs","Travis kelce’s hint about florida mansion leaves fans buzzing about taylor swift moving in.

Is Shedeur Sanders the next Browns starter?

NFL champion sees Shedeur Sanders as early Browns frontrunner



How Shedeur Sanders becomes Cleveland Browns starting QB | THE HERD w/ Colin Cowherd & Drew Bledsoe

Shedeur Sanders might have entered the NFL as a fifth-round pick in the 2025 Draft, but he's quickly proving that draft position doesn’t define potential—or leadership. While many expected Dillon Gabriel, taken two rounds earlier, to draw most of the early spotlight, it’s Sanders who’s quietly making waves inside the Cleveland Browns’ quarterback room.From the moment rookie minicamp wrapped up, a buzz began building around Sanders’ presence and poise. ESPN’s Chris Canty, a Super Bowl champion turned analyst, spoke about it on Unsportsmanlike, pointing out how players are responding to the former Colorado Buffaloes quarterback.“I'm going with whoever my locker room responds to the most,” Canty said. “Just based on how the rookies reacted to him coming off of rookie minicamp. Based on what we've been hearing in terms of his interactions with veterans around the building, the coaching staff, it feels like people are gravitating toward Shedeur Sanders.”That gravitation seems genuine. Sanders has already started forming meaningful bonds within the team, including a noticeable connection with rookie running back Quinshon Judkins. Their camaraderie has surfaced on social media, offering fans a glimpse into a budding off-field friendship that could translate into real on-field synergy.Even more telling was a group photo from day one of rookie minicamp, where several teammates threw up “The Shedeur” gesture—a celebration Sanders popularized. Interestingly, Sanders himself chose not to flash it in that moment, perhaps a quiet nod to the humility and team-first mindset he’s adopting as he finds his footing in Cleveland.Sanders doesn’t just bring talent; he brings an infectious calmness and charisma. His natural ease with the media and in public appearances has drawn comparisons to veteran quarterbacks. At the recent NFLPA Rookie Premiere, he was all smiles, even joking about sharing a room with Super Bowl MVP Joe Flacco.“It’s just so funny. We’re on the same team,” Sanders said. “People try to put us against each other, but inside the room, we know we are one.”In a league where rookies often tread lightly, Sanders seems to be walking with a quiet confidence—likely inherited from his father, NFL Hall of Famer and current Colorado coach Deion Sanders. Canty agrees.“Shedeur Sanders is the leader in the clubhouse because he's comfortable in that environment—because he's been around the NFL all his life. His dad is Deion Sanders.”The Browns’ quarterback competition is anything but light. Sanders is up against the likes of Flacco, Gabriel, Kenny Pickett, and possibly even Deshaun Watson if he returns healthy. Still, early impressions suggest Sanders isn’t intimidated. Instead, he's leaning into the challenge—earning trust, building chemistry, and making it impossible for coaches and teammates to overlook him.While the official starter remains unnamed, one thing’s clear: Shedeur Sanders is not here just to take part. If this momentum continues, the Browns might find themselves turning to a rookie not just for potential—but for leadership and results.Also Read: Not just a Swiftie: Travis Kelce’s cousin sparks backlash after shutting down bandwagon fan accusations","Shedeur sanders is making waves in the cleveland browns' quarterback room.

Rob Gronkowski clears the air on wild Aaron Hernandez masturbation claims during Patriots meetings,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/rob-gronkowski-clears-the-air-on-wild-aaron-hernandez-masturbation-claims-during-patriots-meetings/articleshow/121366604.cms,"Rob Gronkowski addressed a long-standing, bizarre rumor about Aaron Hernandez allegedly masturbating during Patriots team meetings, calling it “crazy.” (Getty Images)

Gronk calls out “crazy” Aaron Hernandez meeting story fans still can't stop talking about



Rob Gronkowski, known as much for his wild personality as for his dominant career on the football field, is no stranger to shocking stories. But his latest appearance on the Bussin’ With the Boys podcast has fans doing a double take. When a long-standing rumor about his late New England Patriots teammate Aaron Hernandez resurfaced, Gronk didn’t dodge the question—he danced on the edge of confirmation.During the candid interview, former NFL offensive lineman Taylor Lewan put it bluntly, asking Gronkowski whether it was true that Hernandez had been “in the team meeting room beating off and doing crazy s***.” Gronk’s response was classic Gronkowski—half-joking, half-jaw-dropping: “That’s a possibility, that one,” he said, laughing nervously. “I may or may not have seen it live. I’m not going to confirm nor deny. ”Instead of expressing shock or disgust, Gronk leaned into the chaotic vibe that fans have come to associate with both him and the controversial Hernandez. “I love crazy s***, though,” Gronkowski admitted. “I didn’t mind things like that. I was like, ‘Wow, that was pretty epic.’ I was a wild man myself. Nothing fazed me.”This bizarre anecdote only scratches the surface of what has become one of the most infamous legacies in NFL history.Hernandez, who shared the Patriots’ tight end room with Gronk from 2010 to 2012, was once viewed as a rising star. Together, they were a nightmare for opposing defenses. But while Gronk’s career soared, Hernandez’s life spiraled into tragedy.Hernandez was arrested in 2013 for the murder of Odin Lloyd and later convicted of first-degree murder. In 2017, he died by suicide in prison, with posthumous reports revealing that he had been suffering from Stage 3 Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE)—a severe brain condition often linked to repeated head trauma.Gronkowski, despite his usually lighthearted demeanor, admitted that the extent of Hernandez’s darkness caught him off guard. “I didn’t see it going to the level that it went to,” he said. “That was a surprise. It was a surprise to everyone because you would never expect anyone, especially in that position, to have it go to the level that it went to.”He further acknowledged that while Hernandez did show signs of unpredictability, the depths of his troubles were largely hidden. “I didn’t know it was that bad. I knew that there was definitely some wild sides to him,” Gronkowski shared.With multiple documentaries, including Netflix’s Killer Inside: The Mind of Aaron Hernandez, casting a spotlight on the disgraced star’s complex life, Gronkowski reflected on how Hernandez was portrayed. “With everything coming out, there’s some that I would say is true in the documentaries… there’s some that’s probably exaggerated a little bit. But there’s some that’s not exaggerated at all, either.”As a four-time Super Bowl champion and one of the NFL’s most colorful personalities, Rob Gronkowski continues to captivate both on and off the field. His recollection of Hernandez—part amusement, part sadness—adds yet another layer to a story that continues to haunt the NFL and fascinate fans.Also Read: Donald Trump mocks New York Jets in a subtle way, while praising Tim Tebow’s NFL success","Rob gronkowski addressed a long-standing, bizarre rumor about aaron hernandez allegedly masturbating during patriots team meetings.
