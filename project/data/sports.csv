Gisele B√ºndchen defends Tom Brady, dismisses media speculation over football‚Äôs role in the split

A quiet love story and learning to live without apology

In March 2024, Gisele B√ºndchen gave fans an emotionally raw glimpse into her post-divorce life during a heartfelt sitdown with Robin Roberts, reflecting on the end of her 13-year marriage to NFL icon Tom Brady. As part of the IMPACT x Nightline special Climbing the Mountain, the supermodel's tearful moment caught headlines‚Äîbut beyond the emotion was a message of resilience, healing, and self-discovery.Gisele B√ºndchen, now 44, opened up about what she once described as ‚Äúthe death of my dream.‚Äù When Roberts gently revisited the quote, asking how she was coping more than a year after the split was finalized, Gisele struggled to answer before turning away and softly requesting, ‚ÄúCan I have a little moment?‚ÄùThat vulnerable pause wasn‚Äôt scripted‚Äîit was the real-time unfolding of a woman still navigating the aftershocks of letting go of a once-idealized life. And it struck a chord with fans who had watched her grace red carpets and Super Bowl stands by Brady‚Äôs side for over a decade.Following their October 2022 divorce, media speculation had pointed fingers at Tom Brady‚Äôs return to football as a key factor. But Gisele B√ºndchen strongly rejected that narrative in a Vanity Fair interview: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the craziest thing I‚Äôve ever heard.‚ÄùShe continued, ‚ÄúListen, I have always cheered for him, and I would continue forever.‚ÄùDespite the pain of separation, her sentiments toward Brady remained grounded in mutual respect. ‚ÄúIf there‚Äôs one person I want to be the happiest in the world, it‚Äôs him, believe me,‚Äù B√ºndchen added. ‚ÄúI want him to achieve and to conquer. I want all his dreams to come true.‚ÄùThe interview at that time also hinted at Gisele B√ºndchen‚Äôs future‚Äîwith herself and possibly with someone new. When asked if she was ready to love again, she replied with serene confidence: ‚ÄúWhere my heart is now is where I am right now. I‚Äôm living my truth, and I‚Äôm not apologizing for it.‚ÄùBehind the scenes, B√ºndchen had reportedly grown close to Joaquim Valente, her children‚Äôs jiu-jitsu instructor, though the relationship started as a friendship. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre taking it slow,‚Äù a source said at the time, noting how Valente had been a steady source of comfort during her transition.Also Read: ‚ÄúShe is secure and happy‚Äù: Gisele B√ºndchen thrived after dumping Tom Brady‚Äîwas the NFL legend the real problem?

Solo Sikoa defeats Jimmy Uso by pinfall.

The United States Championship belt is up for grabs once more as Jimmy Uso comes for the title, this time with Solo Sikoa defending. Sikoa won the United States Championship title from Jacob Fatu after defeating him at the WWE Night of Champions. Now the two brothers are facing each other after an already heated match on SmackDown on July 11, when a minute distraction caused Sikoa to lose the match against Jimmy during their tag team bout. After losing against Jimmy Uso and LA Knight, Sikoa was even more inclined to lay it down on his brother, and the match was exciting to say the least. The power struggle in the Bloodline, if it can even be called that anymore continues, but it's the fans who are the real winners.Solo Sikoa makes his entry alongside MFT while Jimmy Uso was waiting for him at the ring. After yesterday's fight on SmackDown, everyone is looking forward to the big match. This is Jimmy's first-ever singles match for a championship in WWE , and Solo's first-ever defense of a title. Things started out hot, with both of the wrestlers coming in hot. Jimmy almost won after jumping on Solo from the top rope, but his opponent managed to kick him off right on time.Jimmy Uso had the upper hand for most of the match, and though Sikoa tried to change the tide a couple of times, Uso was able to bring things back on track. Unfortunately, the MFT, or specifically Talla Tonga, became the reason for his defeat. Just when it seemed like Solo was going to lose, he managed to change the whole scenario. Jimmy did a corkscrew off the top onto the entire group, but Talla Tonga came in with a distraction. While Big Jim was trying to pile on the other, Solo uses this reprieve to roll Jimmy up, and Talla Tonga helped him by using his legs to keep Solo in place to take the win.Things don't end there, as Jacob Fatu makes an entrance while the MFT are taking it out on Uso. Solo had him down with a Samoan Spike, but Fatu came in to shake things up. While it's not the Bloodline, a shift is incoming, and fans are waiting to see how things turn out. After the showdown tonight, let's see what the future holds.Also Read: Is Roman Reigns set for a surprise return?

NFL fans shocked as Shedeur Sanders trails Dillon Gabriel in Browns QB race

This Browns QB room isn‚Äôt built for comfort, it‚Äôs built for war



From viral college stardom to NFL wake-up call, it looks like Shedeur Sanders is starting his pro journey with a dose of humble pie.

However, fortune did not favor the veteran wrestler as he had to face a crushing defeat at the hands of his arch-rival, Gunther.

Goldberg's chants filled the arena in Atlanta, Georgia, by his beloved fans who gathered to watch the WWE legend one last time in the ring.The match began with the WWE Hall of Famer pushing off Gunther, who tried to lock in chops. The Ring General attacked him with two thudding chest chops, but Goldberg felt nothing as he took down the Champion with a brutal clothesline. Following this, Goldberg went for a spear, but the Champion ducked tactfully, causing him to go crashing through the barricade.Gunther next targeted Goldberg‚Äôs left knee, which everyone knew as his weak point for the seasoned wrestler. Even though he faced a tough start, Goldberg managed to break free and executed a powerful back body drop, shifting the momentum in his favor.However, out of nowhere, disaster struck when Goldberg accidentally speared the referee, bringing the match to a sudden halt. Actually. Goldberg went for the spear, but Gunther managed to duck again, and this time it's referee, Charles Robinson, fell into the deadly spear.Seizing this opportunity, Gunther capitalized again, removing the knee brace and flaunting it in front of the fans. The Ring General attacked Goldberg with the brace, and he did not stop him, hurting him physically, but added a personal twist when he taunted his son, Gage, who was watching from the ringside.Gunther, showing off his brace, climbed back into the ring, but he was taken down hard by a huge spear from Goldberg, who was eyeing the finishing move with the Jack Hammer. Just then, another referee rushed into the ring as the legend went for the pin, but Gunther managed to kick out just in time.In the final attempt, The Ring General locked in the sleeper on Goldberg, who tried very hard to fight back, but could not break himself out of the hold. The legend goes to sleep as he is unable to break the hold. Meanwhile, the referee signaled as the bell rings, and Gunther defeated Goldberg, retaining the World Heavyweight title.","Wwe hall of famer goldberg hung up his boots in atlanta, georgia, tonight.

LeBron James intrigued by the Los Angeles Lakers ' futuristic vision as trade season whispers grow louder



In the midst of swirling trade speculation and mounting questions about his future in Los Angeles, LeBron James ' longtime agent, Rich Paul , has finally addressed the rumors head-on. As the Lakers pivot toward a future built around Luka Doncic and new acquisitions like Deandre Ayton, James is reportedly taking a step back to evaluate where he fits into the franchise‚Äôs evolving blueprint. With just one season remaining on his contract, the four-time NBA champion finds himself at a career crossroads, and the tension between legacy and change is more real than ever.As the Los Angeles Lakers reshape their roster with an eye toward the next decade, LeBron James is facing the most uncertain offseason of his legacy-enriched career. While the addition of Luka Doncic has sparked hope for a bright future in Los Angeles, it‚Äôs also led to speculation that the franchise may be preparing for life after LeBron.In a revealing report by ESPN‚Äôs Shams Charania, James is said to believe the Lakers ""are more in a futuristic mindset,‚Äù adding that ‚Äúsome hard conversations will need to happen.‚Äù Though James recently picked up his $52.6 million player option for the 2025-26 season, the decision appears more about flexibility than finality.Speaking to Charania, Rich Paul commented on where James and his team stand amid the speculation.""We understand the difficulty in winning now while preparing for the future,"" Paul said. ""We do want to evaluate what's best for LeBron at this stage in his life and career. He wants to make every season he has left count, and the Lakers understand that, are supportive and want what's best for him.""Despite averaging 24.4 points, 7.8 rebounds, and 8.2 assists last season, James and the Lakers were bounced in the first round of the playoffs for the second straight year. As front office executives Rob Pelinka and JJ Redick reshape the roster around Doncic, James has remained notably quiet.The silence has only amplified speculation. According to ESPN‚Äôs Brian Windhorst, one Eastern Conference executive is ""convinced James wanted out of LA,‚Äù with teams like the Golden State Warriors actively exploring trade packages. A potential blockbuster deal could even include both LeBron and Bronny James heading to the Bay Area in exchange for young assets like Jonathan Kuminga and Moses Moody.Meanwhile, former teammate Udonis Haslem added fuel to the fire on ESPN‚Äôs NBA Today, joking about James joining Stephen Curry. ‚ÄúIf chef cooking up something, I‚Äôm showing up for dinner. For sure. That‚Äôs for damn sure. If chef cooking, I‚Äôm showing.""Also Read: LeBron James' Final Act? Lakers Set the Stage for a Legendary Hollywood Farewell in 2026Whether James ultimately stays or joins forces with Curry for one last title push, James is all up for retaining his legacy and retiring like a king in his potentially final season.

But as Rich Paul bluntly said on ESPN, James ‚Äúvalues a realistic chance of winning it all.‚ÄùAnd if the Lakers can‚Äôt offer that, the King may be ready to move on.","Lebron james is reportedly taking a step back to evaluate where he fits into the los angeles lakers' evolving blueprint.

After leading the Florida Panthers to back-to-back Stanley Cup championships, Matthew Tkachuk is in no mood to show mercy. When asked if he felt bad for Connor McDavid and the Edmonton Oilers, Tkachuk dismissed the suggestion outright.He pointed out that no one offered the Panthers sympathy when they lost in 2023 despite their injuries. Now, with two Cups in hand, Tkachuk isn‚Äôt about to soften his edge, especially not for a rival team.The Panthers and Oilers have built a fierce rivalry over the past two seasons, and Tkachuk‚Äôs latest remarks have only intensified it. Despite the Panthers having the upper hand with two straight Finals wins, the tension shows no signs of cooling.Tkachuk, a former Calgary Flames forward, has a long history with the Oilers, and his latest comments reflect a personal edge that keeps this rivalry burning.According to Tkachuk, fans from Western Canada have been hoping for a break for the Edmonton Oilers. But his message was clear: the Stanley Cup isn‚Äôt something to be handed out for pity. His competitive mindset has no room for emotional appeals.His time in Calgary made him all too familiar with Edmonton‚Äôs hunger for a Cup and even more determined to deny it.While the Panthers celebrate, Connor McDavid and the Oilers are left facing another tough offseason. Despite elite talent and deep playoff runs, they‚Äôve fallen short once again.T kachuk‚Äôs cold reaction is likely to sting, but it may also fire up McDavid and his teammates heading into next year. The Oilers are still chasing their first championship in the McDavid era, and the Panthers are standing firmly in the way.Tkachuk has drawn a clear line in the sand: there are no handouts at the top. And with the Panthers now firmly established as the team to beat, don‚Äôt expect this rivalry, or Tkachuk‚Äôs sharp edge, to disappear anytime soon.Matthew Tkachuk shows no sympathy for the Oilers after leading the Florida Panthers to back-to-back Stanley Cup wins, and his fierce stance reflects a rivalry that‚Äôs only getting hotter.Also Read: Former NHL enforcer Nick Tarnasky destroys drunk man in wild viral golf course brawl",Matthew tkachuk has led the florida panthers to back-to-back stanley cup wins.

Johnny Gaudreau's arrival redefined the Columbus Blue Jackets' identity

A start with a spark, a season with struggles

July 13, 2022, was a watershed date that altered the narrative of the Columbus Blue Jackets. For a franchise long deemed to be outside the bright lights of major NHL free agency splashes, the signing of Johnny Gaudreau sent shockwaves not just across Ohio but throughout the hockey world. This must have been more than just an acquisition; it was a statement. From then on, ""Johnny Hockey"" choosing Columbus besides the big markets has been an indelible moment in the history books of the Blue Jackets.For decades, Columbus had a reputation as a city where NHL stars left, not landed in. The signing of Johnny Gaudreau went against every clich√©s the fans had reluctantly accepted. One of the league's most dynamic forwards, Gaudreau was no ordinary free agent; he was the free agent of 2022. An unlikely candidate for an offer this late into his career, he had nine years in the Calgary Flames and enjoyed a career year last season with 115 points in 2021-22. Players of this caliber usually never even hit the open market.The shock was caused not only by Gaudreau's decision to leave Calgary but also by the perceived underdog status of the team with which he signed. Some fans would even say the rumors of Gaudreau going to Columbus were just internet chatter, but the truth burst forth suddenly, sending shockwaves through the community.The hockey universe had already started buzzing by the time Elliotte Friedman took Twitter to confirm the news.For Gaudreau, partnering with Columbus was about more than just the contract. It was about fit, comfort, and opportunity. To the fans, it meant belief that Columbus could finally stand for a destination, not a detour.Johnny Gaudreau's first outing at Nationwide Arena on October 14, 2022, against the Tampa Bay Lightning was nothing short of cinematic. He scored his very first Blue Jackets goal in less than three minutes since the puck dropped. The roar from the nearly evening-starved venue confirmed the warm embrace of Columbus toward its new star.In his debut season, Gaudreau was an offensive force with 21 goals and 74 points in a year when the team lost more than 500 man-games to injury. Gaudreau missed two games all year while setting a personal best of 21 power-play assists, tying his career high.The next season was taxing for both the team and its star. With the roster inconsistent and missing key bodies for weeks on end, including Gaudreau's linemate Patrik Laine, his numbers slid to 60 points in 81 games. Yet throughout the struggles, he was there for the team, committed to the cause.Also Read: Christian Dvorak perceives an opportunity with the Philadelphia Flyers against opposing NHL teams, offering contracts Signing Johnny Gaudreau was more than just a free agency coup; it was a cultural awakening for the Columbus Blue Jackets. Since then, he has been through roadblocks and challenges, but from the day he put on that Union Blue sweater, the franchise has never looked at itself, or the NHL has never looked at Columbus in the same way.","Johnny gaudreau's arrival redefined the columbus blue jackets' identity.

Poll Do you believe this incident will ignite more drama in the remaining matches? Definitely Maybe Unlikely

TimesofIndia.com in London: A hundred, two gritty half-centuries, an excellent run-out and a fiery spell with the ball was not enough as it was six minutes of unadulterated drama in the dying stages of Day 3 which brought the Lord's to life. A fired-up India captain Shubman Gill was in England opener Zak Crawley 's face and had almost every Indian player converging towards the pitch during that moment.The umpires intervened to cool things down but the damage had been done. Gill had enough of the theatrics and the call for the physio was the moment he exploded. After a round of applause, he charged towards Crawley and did an impact player signal, and also fired some not so pleasant statements with aggressive hand gestures.The stump mic was alert enough to pick up the four words which went viral on social media. ""Show some fu*g b**s,"" yelled Gill as the right-hander did all he could to deny India an over from the pavilion end. He succeeded and Jasprit Bumrah , equally annoyed, stood on top of his run-up for the final delivery of the day's play.He bowled an absolute peach but Crawley survived. The opener immediately turned back and was brisk walking to the dressing room as the umpires flipped the bails to signal end of day's play.A good old fashioned Day 3 got a spicy finish and has now set-up the remaining two days, and the series very nicely.The series hasn't had any dramatic moment yet and the episode on the third day could well fire up proceedings, and lend some flavor and colour to action. Both camps were asked about the final over and KL Rahul understood why Crawley was doing what he did, and also explained why Gill was so fired in those few minutes.""I am an opener so I can understand what he was doing but Shubman Gill was fired up because we wanted to bowl two overs in the six minutes before stumps. Lot of theatrics and everyone was fired up,"" said Rahul at post-day presser.From the hosts camp, Tim Southee, part of the coaching set-up, felt this is part and parcel of the game, and reiterated both sides have played in the right spirit in the series so far.","Shubman gill and jasprit bumrah lost their cool in last five minutes of day 3 vs england.

Jimmy Butler backs Stephen Curry in heartfelt Tahoe appearance during offseason golf showdown



The Golden State Warriors teammates Stephen Curry and Jimmy Butler have recently grabbed attention after a clip of the duo appeared online. Butler came to support Curry in Tahoe as the Warriors veteran having his best of time playing golf.Stephen Curry‚Äôs attempt to reclaim his American Century Championship crown certainly got a surprise boost from Butler. As Curry stepped into the final round of the celebrity golf tournament in South Lake Tahoe, Butler‚Äôs courtside energy followed him to the fairways. The four-time NBA champion was locked in and rising through the ranks on Sunday, and the presence of Butler, who joined the Warriors earlier this year, added to the moral support.Jimmy Butler‚Äôs unexpected appearance at Edgewood Tahoe showed the growing chemistry between two elite competitors. Despite being fresh off a playoff exit, Butler made the trip to stand behind his teammate during the ACC tournament‚Äôs final stretch. ‚ÄúSome familiar faces made it to Tahoe,‚Äù the Golden State Warriors posted on X, alongside a video of Butler patiently waiting for Curry on the course.Their growing friendship has been one of the more exciting developments for Warriors fans since Butler was acquired in a blockbuster five-team deal.The trade sent Andrew Wiggins, Kyle Anderson, and a protected first-round pick out the door in exchange for Butler.Butler and Curry, who last played together on May 14 in the Western Conference semifinals against the Timberwolves, are using this offseason to strengthen their off-court bond before heading into their first full campaign as teammates this fall. Butler‚Äôs late-season arrival already paid off in flashes, and now the duo looks poised to lead a new era for the Warriors.Curry, meanwhile, returned to the American Century Championship after missing last year‚Äôs tournament due to his Olympic commitments in Paris. The 2023 champion didn‚Äôt take his prep lightly, even if his words hinted at a relaxed approach. ‚ÄúSo I‚Äôve learned playing in this tournament for what, 10, 11 years, you have expectations, and you‚Äôre trying to, it‚Äôs almost like pulling an all-nighter for a test, trying to cram everything,"" Curry said. ""Because, you know, I play a decent amount, but nobody ever says, ‚ÄòI play enough golf or practice enough.‚Äô So as long as I have a good idea of what I‚Äôm trying to do, I can just live with the results, which is where I‚Äôm now.‚ÄùThough Curry couldn‚Äôt capture the title, finishing tied for third with 58 points, his Sunday surge, rising from T9 to T3, marked his best showing of the weekend.

Balancing Donƒçiƒá‚Äôs Future and LeBron‚Äôs Timeline

Despite a swirl of speculation surrounding‚Äô future, thestar has not asked for a trade, according to his agent Rich Paul. As the franchise continues to balance long-term planning with immediate championship ambitions, the offseason noise surrounding LeBron has only grown louder. But according to both James‚Äô camp and team insiders, it‚Äôs still business as usual in L.A.During ESPN‚Äôs Summer League broadcast on Saturday, Dave McMenamin reported key insights from a conversation with Rich Paul. Although four teams have expressed interest in acquiring LeBron James , Paul emphasized that no trade request has been made.‚ÄúPaul also made it clear to me that LeBron has not asked for a trade. And Paul hasn‚Äôt even discussed the possibility of wanting a trade in the future with the Lakers,‚Äù McMenamin said.According to Paul, the Los Angeles Lakers have not received any formal trade request, nor has LeBron James himself initiated or even hinted at such a conversation. When approached by McMenamin before tip-off to discuss the rumors, LeBron replied, ‚ÄúI ain‚Äôt got nothing to talk about.‚ÄùWhile the specific teams weren‚Äôt named, ESPN insiders Ramona Shelburne and Brian Windhorst reported that the Golden State Warriors were among those who ‚Äúconsidered‚Äù making a move for LeBron this offseason.Though nothing materialized, the mere idea of a team trading for a 41-year-old in the final year of his contract, who also happens to be the league‚Äôs all-time leading scorer, added fuel to the rumor mill.LeBron James exercised his $52.6 million player option for the upcoming season, putting him on an expiring deal. That, combined with his age and the Lakers‚Äô evolving roster, naturally creates some uncertainty. Here‚Äôs what the Lakers currently have in terms of potential trade assets:The Lakers also face a July 20 deadline to decide on Shake Milton‚Äôs contract, a smaller move that could still impact roster flexibility.Paul acknowledged earlier this offseason in an interview with Shams Charania that James is closely monitoring the Los Angeles Lakers‚Äô moves and remains focused on competing for another title.‚ÄúLeBron wants to compete for a championship,‚Äù Paul said. ‚ÄúHe knows the Lakers are building for the future. He understands that, but he values a realistic chance of winning it all.‚ÄùWith the Lakers bringing in and Jake LaRavia, it remains to be seen whether those additions are enough to convince LeBron that the team can challenge contenders like the Nuggets, Celtics, or Timberwolves‚Äîthe latter of whom ousted the Lakers in just five games during last season‚Äôs first round.L.A.‚Äôs current strategy appears to hinge on Luka Donƒçiƒá, who is entering his prime at 26. While the team is motivated to build around the superstar guard long-term, that vision may not align perfectly with LeBron‚Äôs win-now mentality.Charania mentioned during an appearance on SiriusXM NBA Radio that James ‚Äúfeels clearly that the Lakers are more in a futuristic mindset‚Äù and suggested that ‚Äúhard conversations‚Äù may soon be necessary.For now, there‚Äôs no trade request. LeBron remains with the Lakers as they attempt to bridge a championship window and a rebuild. However, with interest from around the league and ongoing questions about the team‚Äôs direction, it‚Äôs likely that LeBron James and the front office will need to revisit the conversation if things don‚Äôt click quickly next season.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Golden State Warriors could sgin $52.6 million Los Angeles Lakers superstar, improving his odds at 5th Championship title Until then, as Rich Paul made clear, the King is staying put.","Lebron james has not asked for a trade, according to his agent rich paul.

Seth Rollins Has a History of Knee Injuries Amid the Latest Scare

In what was meant to be another pitstop in Seth Rollins ‚Äô rise to the top of Monday Night Raw, a legit injury has supposedly halted the former World Champion‚Äôs momentum. In his co-main event outing against LA Knight at Saturday Night‚Äôs Main Event, ‚ÄòThe Visionary‚Äô suffered a legitimate knee injury while performing a routine Lionsault off the second rope.To avoid disaster, Knight moved out of the way. Rollins then landed awkwardly on his feet and, in turn, seemed to buckle his knee. The former Universal Champion immediately winced in pain and dragged himself to the corner of the ring while clutching it.At first, it seemed to be a method of deception from ‚ÄòThe Architect,‚Äô but just moments later, it was clear that Rollins was in legitimate pain. The Money in the Bank holder talked to the ringside doctor, Paul Heyman, with the referee trying to separate Knight from Rollins. Just moments later, Rollins tried to get up on his feet but was immediately planted with a BFT for Knight to pick up the win.This was an impromptu and early finish to the match as the cameras panned to commentators Michael Cole and Wade Barrett, who informed the fans that Rollins was indeed in trouble. During the commercial break, Rollins was assisted by the medical staff and escorted to the backstage area.For the unversed, Rollins already has had issues with his right knee as he tore his ACL, MCL, and meniscus back in November 2015 at a house show in Dublin and had to miss WrestleMania 32 due to the injury.In the latest update, Fightful Select reported that the injury scare was indeed legitimate and ‚Äúit had at least not been planned for by medical personnel.‚Äù Moreover, original plans for the match had Rollins going over Knight, but plans were changed owing to the situation. Another insider wrestling account, WrestleVotes, stated that ‚Äúthe sense from a source just now is the Seth Rollins injury is legit.‚ÄùThis unfortunate incident occurred at a time when Rollins is primed to be the top heel on Raw and was expected to capture the World title in the next few months. Moreover, his alliance with Paul Heyman, Bron Breakker, and Bronson Reed was starting to pay dividends, with the faction garnering positive fan reactions from the WWE Universe. It will be interesting to see how WWE will respond and make changes to its existing storylines after this huge setback.Also read: WWE Saturday Night‚Äôs Main Event Live (July 12, 2025) Highlights and Results: Gunther beats Goldberg, LA Knight defeats Seth Rollins, and More",Seth rollins suffered a legitimate knee injury in his co-main event outing against la knight at saturday night‚Äôs main event.
