HYDERABAD: Following media reports about the Hyderabad Cricket Association (HCA) president and some other top officials harassing and blackmailing the IPL franchise Sunrisers Hyderabad over free tickets, Telangana chief minister A Revanth Reddy, on Monday, ordered an investigation into the matter.The state government appointed senior IPS officer Kothakota Sreenivasa Reddy , currently serving as director general (vigilance & enforcement) to conduct an investigation in the case and submit a report soon.Recently, the SRH management took strong objection to HCA president A Jagan Mohan Rao’s conduct and shot an email, threatening to stop playing matches in Hyderabad’s Rajiv Gandhi International Cricket stadium if they continue to harass them with demands for free tickets.“All these unprofessional threats and actions by HCA, especially by the HCA president, make it evident that you don’t want Sunrisers to play at your stadium. If that is the case, please let me know in writing so that we can inform the BCCI, the Telangana govt, and our management that you wish for us to move to another venue, and we will move,” Sunrisers’ general manager Srinath TB told HCA in an email.Reacting to this development, the state government took cognizance and ordered an enquiry to end the culture of franchises demanding free tickets.""The chief minister has appointed Sreenivasa Reddy to enquiry into the allegations.

It could be officers in uniform or anyone else for that matter, this practice should end,’’ a source in the secretariat told TOI.What triggered the row was HCA representatives locking up a box on the day of the SRH-LSG match on Thursday. “Please note that we pay the appropriate rent for the stadium, and during the tenure of the IPL, the stadium is under our jurisdiction. But in the last game, you locked the F3 box, refusing to open it unless 20 extra free tickets were given to you. This unprofessional behaviour creates a hostile environment, making cooperation increasingly difficult,” he stated.",Telangana cm a revanth reddy ordered an investigation into allegations against hyderabad cricket association officials harassing sunrisers hyderabad with demands for free tickets.

Philadelphia Flyers begin extensive search for new head coach following John Tortorella's departure,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/philadelphia-flyers-begin-extensive-search-for-new-head-coach-following-john-tortorellas-departure/articleshow/119787595.cms,"Image via Getty Images

Flyers’ top candidates for head coach

With John Tortorella no longer at the helm of the Philadelphia Flyers, the team is in search of a new head coach to lead them forward. While Brad Shaw has been appointed as the interim coach for the remainder of the season, the organization will likely conduct an extensive search for a permanent replacement. Several candidates have emerged as potential fits for the role, each bringing unique strengths to the table.The Flyers are searching for a new head coach, with candidates including David Carle, Rick Tocchet, Mike Sullivan, Jay Woodcroft, and Marc Savard. GM Daniel Brière must choose between experience and fresh leadership.One strong contender is David Carle, the head coach of the University of Denver. At just 35 years old, Carle has already achieved remarkable success, leading his team to NCAA championships in 2022 and 2024. He also coached Team USA to back-to-back gold medals in the World Junior Championships in 2024 and 2025. His ability to develop young players makes him an appealing option for the Flyers, who are in a rebuilding phase. Additionally, his brother, Matt Carle, played for the Flyers, giving him a personal connection to the organization.Another option is Rick Tocchet, a Flyers legend who played 621 games for the team and later transitioned into coaching. Currently leading the Vancouver Canucks, Tocchet has previous experience as head coach of the Tampa Bay Lightning and Arizona Coyotes. Reports suggest that Vancouver wants to extend his contract, but his deep ties to Philadelphia and coaching style could make him a strong candidate if he becomes available.A more experienced candidate is Mike Sullivan, who led the Pittsburgh Penguins to back-to-back Stanley Cup victories in 2016 and 2017. With the Penguins potentially missing the playoffs for a third straight year, there is speculation that a coaching change could happen. If Sullivan becomes available, his championship experience and ability to manage high-pressure situations would make him a major asset for the Flyers.Another potential candidate is Jay Woodcroft, the current head coach of the Edmonton Oilers. Woodcroft has been praised for his ability to develop offensive strategies and get the best out of young players. His coaching philosophy aligns with the Flyers' long-term plans, making him a strong option if Edmonton decides to part ways with him.Lastly, Marc Savard is another name to watch. As an assistant coach with the St. Louis Blues, he has been instrumental in developing their power-play systems and offensive structure. His expertise in creating effective offensive strategies could be valuable for a Flyers team looking to improve their scoring efficiency.Also Read: Wayne Gretzky once predicted Alex Ovechkin could break his all-time NHL goal record, and it's closer than ever With general manager Daniel Brière leading the coaching search, the Flyers will likely consider multiple options before making a final decision. Whether they choose a veteran coach with NHL experience or a younger coach with a fresh approach, the decision will be crucial in shaping the team's future.","The philadelphia flyers are searching for a new head coach.

Anthony Edwards received a hard elbow from Kevin Durant



The Minnesota Timberwolves faced a moment of uncertainty on Friday night when star guard Anthony Edwards went down after a collision with Phoenix Suns forward Kevin Durant . Edwards had to be escorted to the locker room after taking a hit to the face during the first quarter. The Ant-Man returned to the court, but the hard blow on his nose was a serious concern for the Timberwolves and their fans at the moment.When 2:43 was left in the first quarter, Anthony Edwards attempted to intercept a pass intended for Kevin Durant, but in the process, Durant’s arm caught him across the nose. The impact sent Edwards to the ground in visible pain, where he remained for a minute before walking off with assistance. The incident initially sparked concerns about a possible serious injury, as Edwards had a towel covering his face while heading to the locker room.Dane Moore of Blue Wire described the incident, stating, “Anthony Edwards headed to the locker room with a towel over his face after a collision with Kevin Durant. Looked like he maybe got poked in the eye or something.” Similarly, Duane Rankin of azcentral reported, “Anthony Edwards went down as he and Kevin Durant were going for the ball.”Edwards’ absence in the second quarter raised alarms for Timberwolves fans, considering his exceptional season, where he has averaged 27.3 points, 5.7 rebounds, and 4.6 assists per game on 44.1% shooting. With Minnesota sitting in eighth place and just a half-game behind the Los Angeles Clippers for the final guaranteed playoff spot, every game is crucial.Despite the injury scare, Edwards returned in the second half and finished the game with 20 points, helping the Timberwolves secure a 124-109 victory over the Suns. The win marked a four-game season sweep for Minnesota over Phoenix and extended their winning streak against the Suns to seven games. Edwards is currently averaging 23.7 points per game.Also Read: Stephen Curry returns to lead Golden State Warriors to victory over New Orleans Pelican Julius Randle led the Timberwolves with 25 points, while Collin Gillespie stepped up with a career-high 22 points and nine assists.

Montana emerges as the perfect retreat for Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift

Kansas City Chiefs ’ star tight end Travis Kelce and global pop icon Taylor Swift are taking steps toward their future together, with recent reports suggesting that Montana could be their ideal destination to settle down. While some speculated that Kelce might have retired had the Chiefs won the Super Bowl, it appears the couple is moving forward with their life plans regardless of his football career status.Kelce and Swift have reportedly fallen in love with Montana’s serene, media-free environment, making it an attractive option for their future home. A source speaking with RadarOnline.com revealed, “It’s their happy place. They could see themselves building a life there someday. It’s the one place they truly feel free.”This revelation follows reports that the couple was initially eyeing real estate in Kansas City. However, after a visit to the Auric Room at Lone Mountain Ranch, Montana has seemingly become their preferred choice for a peaceful and private retreat.While Kelce remains a key player for the Chiefs, speculation about his retirement has been ongoing. Some insiders believe that if Kansas City had secured the Super Bowl victory, Kelce might have stepped away from the game to focus on his personal life with Swift. However, since that didn’t happen, his football career will continue for at least another season.Despite that, Kelce and Swift are not waiting for his retirement to make future plans.

Brady Tkachuk Falls short in a must-win game

Tim Stutzle’s offensive struggles continue

Ridley Greig’s costly penalty proves to be the turning point

The Senators of Ottawa endured a night of torment as a 1-0 scoreline was knocked down by the Pittsburgh Penguins . They had all scoring chances, and the contribution of Anton Forsberg was a stunning goaltending performance with 34 stops in net, but the Senators could not find a way to break through Tristan Jarry's 31 shots. Sidney Crosby's power-play goal early in the third period sealed Ottawa's fate. While for some players, there was contribution, for others, it was a denial of any impact, and that further hampered the disappointment of the loss the teamsuffered.As captain and the heart and soul of the team, if the team needed their leader to step up in a clutch moment, this was it. But he couldn't deliver. While Tkachuk threw some hits and had three shots on goal, his real contribution in the offensive department was minimal.Tkachuk is often a difference-maker, yet, in this case, he was unable to conjure the positive energy Ottawa so desperately needed. If the Senators fight for the playoff spot, Tkachuk has to step up and be a leader.When Tim Stutzle is on his game, Ottawa's offense looks threatening. Unfortunately, that was not the case against Pittsburgh. Stutzle played almost 19 minutes but did not have a single shot on goal. With the opponents exploiting Stutzle's lack of offensive involvement, the Penguins were in total control of the match.Stutzle is vital to the creative flow and scoring chance production of the Senators. If he keeps having silent nights like that one, things are only going to get worse in an already-struggling offensive environment.Out of all the mistakes Ottawa made, Ridly Greig's penalty near the end of the contest had to be the most damaging. With just seconds on the clock and Pittsburgh holding a 4-3 lead, Greig committed a hooking penalty against Sidney Crosby, giving Pittsburgh a power-play opportunity that lasted into overtime, where they did not waste any time scoring the winner.Greig's blunder illuminated the importance of discipline during the clutch moments of a contest. With four shots on goal, in the end, Greig's unwarranted penalty erased any positive contributions he might have made.As the playoff picture becomes clearer, the Ottawa Senators cannot afford to drop any more important games. Their next test is the Buffalo Sabres, a matchup that may have significant implications for their postseason chances.Stars such as Brady Tkachuk, Tim Stutzle, and Ridly Greig need to step up for the team to recover. The senators may still redeem themselves, but they are running out of time.","Pittsburgh penguins defeated the ottawa senators 4-3 in a must-win game.

Andrew Krakouer's life is full of talent, redemption, and legacy



Life beyond Football: A mentor and advocate



Andrew Krakouer passed awy leaving a lasting legacy



The Australian football community is mourning the tragic loss of former AFL star Andrew Krakouer , who passed away at the age of 42 due to a suspected heart attack at his family home in Perth. Krakouer, remembered as a ""trailblazer"" and ""just a ripper person,"" left behind a legacy that transcended his achievements on the field. From a promising career in the AFL to overcoming personal challenges and making an impact off the field, his story is one of resilience, redemption, and inspiration.Born into a family deeply rooted in Australian Rules Football, Andrew Krakouer was the son of Jim Krakouer and nephew of Phil Krakouer—two legendary figures who mesmerized North Melbourne fans with their skill and flair in the 1980s. Following in their footsteps, Andrew made his mark in the AFL after being drafted by Richmond in 2000 with the 41st selection.Krakouer played 102 games for the Tigers between 2001 and 2007, contributing 102 goals and establishing himself as a dynamic forward. His ability to read the game and position himself perfectly made him one of the most dangerous crumbing forwards of his time. Richmond legend Matthew Richardson paid tribute to his former teammate, describing him as ""the best crumbing forward I played with ... the perfect crumber, and he was a good mark for his size as well. When he was on song, he was unbeatable.""Despite his undeniable talent, Krakouer’s journey took a difficult turn when he was delisted by Richmond in 2007 following a legal issue. He was sentenced to four years in prison for intent to cause grievous bodily harm, a setback that threatened to derail his career. However, it was during this period that Krakouer began his journey of redemption.While serving his sentence, Krakouer played football for the prison team, using the sport as a means of personal transformation. Upon his release on parole in 2009, he returned to the WAFL with Swan Districts, determined to reclaim his place in the game he loved.Krakouer’s redemption story reached its peak in 2010 when he delivered a stunning performance in the WAFL Grand Final. He won the Simpson Medal for best on ground, playing a key role in Swan Districts’ thrilling one-point victory over Claremont. His performance that season also earned him the prestigious Sandover Medal, further cementing his remarkable comeback.Former Swan Districts coach Brian Dawson reflected on Krakouer’s journey, stating, ""He owned his sentence with good grace and worked very hard to rehabilitate himself."" His resilience and determination caught the attention of AFL clubs, and in 2011, Collingwood gave him a second chance at the elite level.Krakouer’s return to the AFL with Collingwood was nothing short of inspirational. He played 35 games for the Magpies between 2011 and 2013, kicking 50 goals. One of his most memorable performances came in the 2011 Grand Final, where he kicked three goals in a losing effort against Geelong.That same year, he took home the Mark of the Year award for a spectacular grab against Adelaide, further showcasing his football prowess. Despite struggling with injuries and inconsistency in the following seasons, his impact at Collingwood remained undeniable. Former coach Nathan Buckley acknowledged his contributions, saying, ""Gee he went through a bit in his life, Krak, he probably had the worst of it and the best of it, he showed real grit to fight back and do what he did in his career.""After leaving the AFL in 2013, Krakouer continued to contribute to the game in different ways. He had a short stint in the WAFL with West Perth before transitioning into mentoring and media roles. He became a well-respected broadcaster, co-hosting Yokayi Footy and appearing as a commentator on Fox Footy.His contributions extended beyond football, as he became a voice for Indigenous players and communities. Richmond Football Club CEO Shane Dunne recognized his influence, stating, ""His contributions to the game were matched by the strength of his character and resilience. He was a trailblazer and fittingly wore our colors for the first AFL Dreamtime at the ‘G match in 2005. He was very proud of his culture and someone that young Indigenous players looked up to.""Krakouer’s ability to turn his life around and give back to the community made him an inspiration for many. He shared his experiences with school and community groups, hoping to guide young players and individuals facing adversity.Andrew Krakouer is survived by his partner, Barbara Garlett, and their four daughters. His sudden passing has left the football world in mourning, with tributes pouring in from teammates, coaches, and fans.AFL CEO Andrew Dillon expressed his sorrow, stating, ""To lose him at such an early age is a tragedy, and we hope there can be some peace for his family in this heart-breaking and difficult time.""Also Read: Dogfighting case: Nearly 200 dogs seized from ex-NFL RB LeShon Johnson, the largest federal seizure from one individual His former teammate Matthew Richardson also reflected on Krakouer’s warmth and character, saying, ""He always greeted you with a hug and a warm smile. He had a great sense of humor and was one of those people you felt really good to be around... just a ripper person.""Andrew Krakouer will be remembered not just for his remarkable football skills but also for his impact on the lives of those around him. His legacy as a player, mentor, and advocate for Indigenous communities will continue to inspire generations to come.","Former afl star andrew krakouer passed away at the age of 42 due to a suspected heart attack at his family home in perth.

Derrick Rose’s journey: From overcoming childhood struggles to becoming a devoted father

Derrick Rose opens up about fatherhood and breaking the cycle



Derrick Rose dazzled fans for years with his explosive speed and gravity-defying plays. But his most meaningful role has nothing to do with basketball—it’s about being a father. Growing up in Chicago’s Englewood neighborhood without a father figure, Rose faced obstacles that could have derailed his dreams. Instead, he turned that absence into motivation, vowing to be the kind of dad he never had.From the moment he picked up a basketball, Derrick Rose was on a mission to become something greater than his circumstances. But his drive wasn’t just about making it to the NBA . ""My dad wasn’t around at all. I took it as motivation where it’s like I’mma smash everything that he even wanted to dream about,"" Rose once revealed. For years, he held onto the belief that his father might be out there, watching his rise to stardom. The painful truth eventually surfaced—his father, Walker, had passed away long ago.That revelation didn’t slow him down. Instead, it fueled his legendary work ethic, pushing him to become the youngest MVP in NBA history. But as time went on, his priorities shifted. The game that once defined him took a backseat to something far more important—his family.As the 2024-25 NBA season approached, Rose made a decision that surprised many: he was stepping away from the game to dedicate himself fully to his children. ""I’ve been thinking about it for a while, and I feel like I need to fully dedicate myself to my son now,"" he shared. His five-year-old son, London, initially struggled with the news. ""He was very sad,"" Rose admitted. But as they embraced this new chapter, father and son grew even closer. ""From that moment on, it has been all love.""Rose’s commitment to fatherhood was on full display on March 29, 2025, when he was given the honor of throwing the ceremonial first pitch at the Chicago White Sox ’s opening game against the LA Angels . But this wasn’t just about baseball—it was a family affair. With London gripping his hand, Rose stepped onto the mound at Guaranteed Rate Field, the crowd cheering as he delivered the pitch. His wife, Alaina Anderson, and their seven-year-old daughter, Layla, beamed from the stands, capturing the moment on their phones. It was a full-circle experience for the Chicago native—this time, not as an NBA star, but as a father making memories with his children.During the post-game press conference, London sat comfortably in his father’s arms as Rose reflected on the moment. Later, he shared a touching Instagram post: ""That smile means the WORLD to me. Me not having my dad around makes me go ALL in with my kids. I wish I would’ve met my dad. We would’ve laughed about how I crush everything he did as a MAN lol.""Rose isn’t just present in his children’s lives—he’s leading by example. Speaking on the Club 520 Podcast, he explained what fatherhood means to him. ""My kids call me dad; I love when they call me dad. Not ‘father’—that doesn’t sound right to me,"" he said. ""It’s about the time that I’m putting in, giving every one of my kids that equal time.""His eldest son, PJ Rose, has begun carving out his own basketball journey, but Rose makes it clear that there’s no pressure. ""You’re your own person; you are PJ Rose; you are your own entity,"" he tells him, emphasizing that his son doesn’t have to live in his shadow.Discipline and structure are just as important to Rose as encouragement. ""I have to be a little bit more strict on [PJ] as far as making sure he gets up on time for school, taking out the garbage—all little chore stuff. But it creates your character, you know what I’m saying?""Also Read: “ Can’t ask for a better birthday weekend”: Ayesha Curry shares her heartfelt reaction to yacht party and Stephen Curry’s touching tribute Derrick Rose’s basketball legacy is set in stone, but his most meaningful accomplishment has nothing to do with stats or accolades. It’s about breaking the cycle of absence and making sure his kids never experience the loneliness he once did. From a childhood without a father to becoming a hands-on dad, Rose has rewritten his own story. His time in the NBA may be over, but in the game of life, he’s still delivering clutch performances—this time, as a father first.","Derrick rose is the youngest mvp in nba history.

Joe Rogan commends Kevin Ferguson for his transition from street fighter to professional MMA fighter

Joe Rogan Experience #2296 - Big Jay Oakerson

Despite a short-lived career in MMA, Kevin Ferguson , aka Kimbo Slice , was known for his violent striking style. In fact, this is the very reason that Joe Rogan believed the former UFC veteran would have been a good fit for a promotion like, a promotion that runs on the idea of no gloves and all fists. In a recent podcast of the Joe Rogan Experience, the commentator praised thefor his courageous step into the Octagon when he was in his late 30s. Ferguson died in 2016, succumbing to chest congestion.Bahamian-born American MMA fighter and professional boxer Kevin Ferguson was primarily a bare-knuckle boxer, whose videos of the mutual combat street fight were very popular. His popularity even earned him the title of The King of the Web Brawlers by the American magazine Rolling Stone. Before being signed by the UFC, Ferguson was associated with promotions like Elite XC and was part of the TV series The Ultimate Fighter , created by Dana White. His official heavyweight debut at UFC 113 was his last match at the UFC after he lost the bout to Matt Mitrione in the second round. After UFC, the fighter tried to sign with the promotion Strikeforce, but the negotiations failed owing to a disputed pay structure. Even though the fighter had announced his retirement from MMA and had decided to venture into professional boxing, an announcement by Bellator MMA in 2015 marked the return of Ferguson into the world of MMA.Ferguson was one of the few fighters who showed that a backyard street fighter from Miami could do what most people deemed impossible. The determination and strong will of Ferguson are much appreciated and applauded today. On the Joe Rogan Experience, the American podcaster praised the fighter for his striking style and the courage he showed by entering the world of MMA at an unconventional age.“If he was fighting just stand-up only, he’s very dangerous. Like if he was involved in like if bareknuckle boxing was around back then he would have been a huge star of bareknuckle boxing. He would have f***** a lot of people up bareknuckle boxing.” Rogan further added, “Kimbo had a bunch of injuries from football. You can’t really grapple at full capacity with knee injuries and learn grappling at 35 or however old he was…But dude kudos to that guy for having the courage to actually get into the UFC and The Ultimate Fighter.”Also read: Khabib Nurmagomedov’s retirement: Chael Sonnen reveals the real reason he left MMA The Bare-Knuckle Fighting Championship was founded in 2018, two years after the fighter passed away.

Consequently, the Rajasthan Royals opted to play him as mostly an Impact Player, giving the captaincy to allrounder Riyan Parag.If granted permission to keep wickets, Sanju will also return as skipper.
