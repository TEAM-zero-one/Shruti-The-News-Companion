Poll Should Shreyas Iyer have been included in the Asia Cup squad? Yes, he deserves a spot. No, there are better options.

NEW DELHI: Former India opener Sadagoppan Ramesh has alleged that head coach Gautam Gambhir did not support Shreyas Iyer ’s inclusion in the Asia Cup squad, despite the batter’s outstanding form in recent tournaments. His remarks come amid ongoing criticism of BCCI chief selector Ajit Agarkar over Iyer’s omission from the squad for the Asia Cup, scheduled to begin on September 9 in the UAE.Iyer has been in prolific touch this season, amassing 604 runs in the 2025 IPL at a strike rate of 174, along with more than 300 runs in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy at a strike rate of 188. Yet, he failed to find a place in India’s 15-member Asia Cup squad.Speaking on his YouTube channel, Ramesh also questioned the narrative around India’s recent 2-2 Test series draw in England, led by Shubman Gill in the absence of Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma.""He backs the players he likes but completely lets go of those he doesn't. Winning consistently abroad had started long back under Kohli and Shastri. But now, just the drawn series in England is being projected as a big achievement in Gambhir's track record,"" Ramesh said.He pointed out Iyer’s crucial role in India’s Champions Trophy triumph earlier this year, where he was India’s top scorer with 243 runs—second overall behind New Zealand’s Rachin Ravindra (263).""Gambhir's biggest achievement remains the Champions Trophy triumph, and Iyer was the biggest reason for that success. Yet, Gambhir is not backing him. Someone like Jaiswal, who is an X-factor player, must play all formats. Keeping him in standby is a poor move,"" Ramesh added.The former opener stressed that Iyer’s form and confidence made him indispensable to India’s white-ball setup.""Shreyas Iyer produced incredible performances in the same UAE during the Champions Trophy and should be a permanent fixture in India's white-ball teams. Players must be backed when they are high on confidence and in form, not when they fade away. This is the ideal time to reap the rewards of Iyer's sky-high confidence.""",Former india opener sadagoppan ramesh has alleged that head coach gautam gambhir did not support shreyas iyer's inclusion in the asia cup squad.

What is the Wayne Gretzky Rule and how it changed the modern NHL forever,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/what-is-the-wayne-gretzky-rule-and-how-it-changed-the-modern-nhl-forever/articleshow/123454130.cms,"What is the Wayne Gretzky Rule (Getty Images)

The origins of the Wayne Gretzky Rule after the 2005 lockout

The lasting impact on hockey and Wayne Gretzky’s legacy

When fans hear the name Wayne Gretzky, they instantly think of records, dominance, and “The Great One’s” lasting influence on hockey. But Gretzky’s legacy extends beyond his on-ice brilliance. After the 2004–05 NHL lockout, a major rule change — later dubbed the Wayne Gretzky Rule — reshaped the way the game was played, prioritizing speed and creativity over clutching and grabbing.The NHL had reached a breaking point before the lockout, with declining scoring and slower gameplay frustrating fans. To restore excitement, the league introduced a stricter “standard of enforcement for obstruction fouls” in 2005.This rule directly targeted interference, holding, and hooking — tactics defenders had long used to slow down skilled forwards. Referees were instructed to call these penalties more aggressively, creating more power plays and forcing teams to adjust.The impact was immediate: offenses found more space to create, the pace of the game accelerated, and skill players had the freedom to shine.The Wayne Gretzky Rule wasn’t just about calling more penalties — it fundamentally changed hockey’s identity.With less obstruction, players like Sidney Crosby and Alexander Ovechkin thrived in the “new NHL,” ushering in a more dynamic era. Fans also responded positively, as higher scoring and faster action brought back excitement after the lockout.Teams had to rethink strategies too. Defensemen could no longer rely on hooking to neutralize top scorers; instead, skating ability and positioning became more important. For offensive players, the rule meant greater opportunities to showcase their creativity and speed — exactly the style Gretzky embodied during his career.Even though the rule has evolved, its influence remains. It stands as a tribute to Gretzky’s vision of hockey as a game defined by flow and finesse rather than obstruction.Also Read: “It’s a war”: Wayne Gretzky’s legacy came under fire amid Donald Trump’s controversial trade war with Canada The Wayne Gretzky Rule did more than change officiating standards — it helped redefine modern NHL hockey. By encouraging speed, skill, and offensive freedom, the league created a product more exciting for players and fans alike. In many ways, the rule is a lasting reminder that Gretzky’s impact on the game goes far beyond his records — it lives on in the way hockey is played today.","After the 2004–05 nhl lockout, a major rule change reshaped the way the game was played.

Serena Williams reveals weight loss journey with GLP-1 medication on Today show

“I literally tried everything. Running, walking, biking, stair-climber, you name it, I did it … Even now trying to play a professional sport, … I felt like, ‘OK, I don’t want to do this because it is a shortcut…’ But it actually isn’t.”

“If you’re on GLP-1s too, don’t let anybody tell you it’s the ‘easy way out.’ You’re not taking a shortcut, you’re taking care of yourself.”

Now she feels lighter both physically and mentally.On August 21, 2025, on NBC’s Today show, Serena Williams explained why she finally turned to GLP-1 drugs.

Poll Do you think RCB made the right decision by letting Mohammed Siraj go? Yes, it was the right call. No, they should have retained him.

Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) finally ended their 18-year wait for an Indian Premier League (IPL) title in 2025. The breakthrough came in the very first season of the new three-year cycle after the mega auction. RCB built a fresh core with major signings like Josh Hazlewood Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Phil Salt, while parting ways with big names such as Glenn Maxwell and Mohammed Siraj Speaking to Cricbuzz, RCB’s director of cricket Mo Bobat revealed the thinking behind letting Siraj go. “Siraj is probably the player that we spent the longest deliberating over,” he admitted.The fast bowler had been part of RCB for seven years, taking 99 wickets in 102 matches. But the management decided not to retain him before the 2025 auction. “Indian international bowlers are not that easy to get. We discussed every eventuality with Siraj, whether to retain him, release him, or use the Right to Match. It was not a straightforward call,” Bobat explained.Eventually, RCB secured Hazlewood for Rs 12.50 crore and Bhuvneshwar for Rs 10.75 crore, while Siraj went to Gujarat Titans for Rs 12.25 crore. Bobat admitted that Bhuvneshwar’s ability to bowl both with the new ball and at the death tilted the decision. “We were keen to try and get Bhuvi for two ends of the innings. Keeping Siraj would have made that difficult. There is never just one reason, several factors come into play,” he said.Siraj had a steady season with 16 wickets in 15 matches for Gujarat, while Bhuvneshwar struck 17 times and played a crucial role in RCB’s title run. Hazlewood stood out as the tournament’s leading bowler with 22 wickets in 12 matches at an economy of under nine.Bobat also revealed that Australian all-rounder Cameron Green was not retained only because of injury. “Had he been fit, we would almost certainly have retained him,” he confirmed.","Royal challengers bengaluru (rcb) ended their 18-year wait for an indian premier league (ipl) title in 2025.

Los Angeles Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford is back on the practice field and back in the spotlight, offering updates on both his health and his sense of humor. The 17-year NFL veteran returned to training camp earlier this week for the first time since aggravating a back injury during the offseason, and on Thursday, he spoke with reporters about his recovery, his mindset, and a papercut. The 2025 NFL season marks Stafford’s fifth year with the Rams and a critical point in his career. After leading Los Angeles to a Super Bowl victory in the 2021–22 season, the veteran quarterback is determined to stay healthy and help his team get back into postseason contention.While questions about his back were expected, Stafford opened his media session by poking fun at the attention his injuries have received. “You guys all want to talk about this paper cut I got last night opening some mail? That’s what I figured. Fire away,” Stafford said as everyone laughed. His wife, Kelly Stafford, didn’t let the joke go unnoticed. She later reposted a video of the moment on her Instagram story, adding her own comments. “The drama of the paper cut last night was real...way to downplay it 9,” she wrote, referring to Stafford’s jersey number.Behind the jokes, Stafford is taking his recovery seriously. The 37-year-old quarterback confirmed that he’s been dealing with a disk-related issue in his back, an injury that has limited his ability to practice during the early stages of camp.However, this week marked a turning point. On Thursday, Stafford explained how hard he’s been working to get himself ready for the regular season, using every resource available to speed up the healing process.“Doing everything we can to try to get to feeling as good as I can,” he said, adding “Just really everything I could possibly do. Done a ton of research just trying to help myself out. Good thing is I feel pretty good the last couple of days out there practicing. Was able to do a little bit more than I thought I was going to be able to do the first day, and then just been trying to stack days.”Now entering his 17th NFL season, Stafford remains one of the most experienced and battle-tested quarterbacks in the league. With a young supporting cast and a defense that’s undergoing a bit of a transition, the Rams will need Stafford at full strength if they hope to contend in a crowded NFC playoff race.The Rams coaching staff are counting on Stafford to be healthy for their Week 1 matchup against the Houston Texans on September 7.","Los angeles rams quarterback matthew stafford returned to training camp this week for the first time since aggravating a back injury.

The sighting has pushed people to wonder if there’s more than friendship going on between them.One source told TMZ,but the insider did not reveal if that time was romantic or only friendly.Still, the fact that Ice has not been seen recently with Gardner, 24, who is one of the NFL’s brightest young stars, makes the timing of this outing all the more interesting.With songs like ""Munch"" that have made her among the fastest rising names in hip-hop, Ice Spice has earned a reputation for keeping followers guessing both with her music and with her personal life.Also Read: “They Want To Be Married”: Taylor Swift And Travis Kelce Plan Marriage And Kids As Romance Grows Stronger Meanwhile, Sauce Gardner begins his third season with the Jets after being the 2022 NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year.

How Beasley’s Clearance Could Impact the NBA Free Agency Landscape

A Clearer Future for Malik Beasley After Months of Uncertainty

, one of the NBA’s elite sharpshooters and a key figure in this year’s free agency, has received major relief in his ongoing legal saga. According to attorneys Steve Haney and Mike Schachter, Beasley is no longer a target in the federal gambling investigation conducted by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York. The update, first reported by Shams Charania via ESPN, could reshape Beasley’s career trajectory and reignite stalled contract negotiations.The federal probe, launched more than a year ago, focused on suspicious betting patterns connected to Malik Beasley’s performances during the 2023-24 NBA season with the Milwaukee Bucks. At the heart of the inquiry were “prop bets” - wagers tied to player-specific statistics like points, rebounds, or assists.In January 2024, a major U.S. sportsbook flagged irregular betting activity on Beasley’s stat lines, alerting federal authorities and leading to the involvement of the Eastern District of New York. As a result, Beasley’s anticipated free agency deal was put on hold, despite him being in prime position to sign a three-year, $42 million contract with the Detroit Pistons.Beasley’s career-best season, highlighted by 16.3 points per game and a Milwaukee franchise record 319 three-pointers, was overshadowed by the investigation.The uncertainty around his future left teams cautious and unwilling to commit financially.The gambling inquiry was not Beasley’s only off-court challenge. His former agency, Hazan Sports, filed a $2.25 million lawsuit against him, alleging breach of contract and failure to repay a $650,000 advance tied to marketing revenues.This combination of federal scrutiny and legal disputes created significant barriers for Beasley’s free agency, leaving one of the league’s most consistent shooters in limbo.Malik Beasley’s attorneys have now confirmed he is no longer considered a target in the federal gambling case. Attorney Steve Haney emphasized the distinction, stating: “An investigation is not a charge.” This clarification provides both legal and public reassurance that Beasley’s name has been cleared from the most serious allegations.The decision not only lifts a cloud over his reputation but also removes a critical obstacle preventing NBA teams from pursuing him aggressively in free agency.Known for his three-point consistency and durability—playing all 82 games last season—Beasley’s market value remains high. Analysts consistently rank him among the best remaining free agents of the 2025 offseason, with teams in need of outside shooting expected to reenter discussions now that his legal risks have eased.His ability to stretch defenses with elite shooting makes him a plug-and-play option for any roster. The removal of the federal probe could accelerate renewed negotiations and allow him to finally secure the long-term contract that was previously derailed.At the league level, Beasley’s case highlights the NBA’s evolving relationship with legalized sports betting. The league continues to balance its partnership with betting operators while enforcing strict rules on player involvement, a tension further underscored by recent cases like Jontay Porter’s federal wire fraud charges.For Malik Beasley, this development marks a critical step toward stability. While the lawsuit with his former agency still lingers, the resolution of the federal investigation removes the most damaging threat to his career.Fans, teams, and analysts will now shift their focus back to his basketball talent, particularly his unmatched perimeter shooting. As free agency progresses, Beasley appears poised to land the kind of deal that matches his on-court production.Also read: Jayson Tatum Injury Update: Boston Superstar Calls Rehab ‘Tedious’ Months After Achilles Injury Shakes Celtics’ Season His journey over the past year illustrates the high stakes of life as an NBA player, where career-defining opportunities can be stalled by off-court issues. With this obstacle behind him, Beasley has a genuine chance to reshape his narrative and return to headlines for his shooting prowess rather than legal uncertainty.","Malik beasley is no longer a target in the federal gambling investigation conducted by the u.s. attorney’s office for the eastern district of new york. At the heart of the inquiry were “prop bets’ - wagers tied to player-specific statistics like points, rebounds, or assists.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123455821,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1081231,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

August 22 marks the 35th birthday of wide receiver Adam Thielen. He played nine seasons for the Minnesota Vikings. He even played college football for the Minnesota State Mavericks. August 22 also marks the day that the Vikings reportedly expressed interest in reacquiring their former wideout from the Carolina Panthers. According to NFL Insider Adam Schefter on X(formerly Twitter), the Vikings inquired about a trade for Panthers WR Adam Thielen(as per league sources). This news generated enthusiasm among Vikings fans, with some commenting, “Vikings need Thielen back.” Another playfully suggested, “I can think of a great 35th birthday present for this guy 😈.”The Minnesota Vikings signed Adam Thielen in 2013 after going undrafted from the Division II Minnesota State University in Mankato. The two-time Pro Bowler played nine of his eleven seasons for the Vikings. The other two were played with the Carolina Panthers.

Could be a game-changer if the trade goes through before opening night.” A third fan exclaimed, “BRING HIM THE F*CK HOMEEEEE.”A fourth fan noticed a trend, stating, “Big fan of the trend of WRs reuniting with their old teams 🏈.” A fifth fan shared some interesting facts about the wideout: “For those who don’t know. Thielen actually grew up in Detroit Lakes MN and went to D2 Minnesota Mankato. He has ties to the region.”A fan jotted down all the reasons why Thielen was perfect for the Vikings: “Thielen might not be in his prime, but his experience, leadership, reliable hands, route-running skills, familiarity with the system, and red-zone effectiveness would all be valuable assets for the Vikings, especially considering their current needs at the receiver position.”When all the fans seemed excited for Adam Thielen’s return to his parent team, one fan questioned the reason behind the Panthers’ trade: “Why would the Panthers do that when they’re trying to be a half decent team this year?” Another fan predicted Thielen’s retirement, “He’s gonna retire this year. bookmark it Adam.” A third fan pointed out, “He deserves to not have to finish his career on a 5 win team.” The Carolina Panthers had finished the 2024 season with a 5-12 record.","Adam thielen played nine seasons for the minnesota vikings.

Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson is dealing with a foot injury that has raised questions about his readiness for the 2025 NFL season. Jackson was injured during a practice session when his foot was stepped on, forcing him to leave early. While the team has insisted the injury isn’t serious, top NFL reporter Adam Schefter expressed doubts about the official updates, suggesting the situation might be more “scarier” than the Ravens are saying.On ‘NFL on ESPN’ Thursday, Adam Schefter shared his thoughts on the injury, pointing out some inconsistencies in the Ravens’ messaging. Although the team reported no broken bones after X-rays and coach John Harbaugh called it a “big relief,” Schefter noted that Jackson has missed two straight days of practice. ""It sounds like it's a little bit scarier than the Ravens led on,"" Schefter said. ""Because they did take X-rays, they did say there were no signs of broken bones or any issues, and John Harbaugh admitted his prayers were answered. So, if there were anything that was nothing, he wouldn't have to pray that Lamar Jackson's X-rays would have turned out the way they did.""Schefter added that the team likely will give Jackson’s foot some extra time to heal since they need him ready for the regular season.The fact that Jackson hasn’t practiced yet this week raises questions about how soon he’ll be back on the field.Coach John Harbaugh later gave an update, confirming the foot injury and saying the quick X-rays showed no damage. Harbaugh admitted Jackson is still sore but is expected to recover soon. ""He got his foot stepped on like we said yesterday. They did a quick X-ray and there's no damage or anything like that. I'm sure it's a little sore today, so we just kept him in. But he's fine. He's going to be good."" Harbaugh said, adding, ""It was a big relief. I told the guys, I said, 'prayers get answered.' Because I was praying. God came through. But he's good.""Jackson himself reacted to the injury talk by commenting with a laughing emoji on Schefter’s viral video.The Ravens will take on the Washington Commanders in their last preseason game on Saturday as they get ready for the regular season. Baltimore’s opener is scheduled for September 7 at home against the Buffalo Bills, with kickoff at 8:20 p.m. ET.Last season, the Ravens made it to the playoffs but were eliminated by the Bills in the divisional round.

Mike Vrabel calls out ‘rats’ inside Patriots for leaking injury news

Mike Vrabel didn’t waste any time making his presence felt in New England.

Florida Panthers add forward Luke Kunin as depth option for 2025-26 NHL season

Luke Kunin faces competition for roster spot on Florida Panthers

The Florida Panthers have signed forward Luke Kunin to a one-year, league-minimum contract, marking the veteran’s fifth NHL stop. Kunin, originally drafted 15th overall by the Minnesota Wild in 2016, has carved out a career as a versatile forward capable of filling multiple roles. After stints with the Wild, Predators, Sharks, and Blue Jackets, he now looks to earn a spot on Florida’s roster heading into the 2025-26 season.Kunin, 27, joins the Florida Panthers with several years of NHL experience across multiple teams. He broke into the league with Minnesota in 2017-18 and showed early promise, producing a 23-29–52 line in his first three seasons with the Wild. Traded to Nashville in 2020, he initially provided secondary scoring before injuries and reduced minutes slowed his momentum.Later stints with the San Jose Sharks and Columbus Blue Jackets saw Kunin transition more into a checking role. An ACL injury during his time in San Jose cut short one season, and his offensive numbers dipped after returning. Over the past two years, Kunin posted back-to-back 18-point campaigns, though his defensive metrics suffered on struggling teams. His experience, versatility, and ability to kill penalties, however, give him value as a depth signing for Florida.While the Panthers secured Kunin on a one-way deal, his spot in the opening night lineup is not guaranteed. He will face stiff competition from depth forwards such as Jonah Gadjovich, A.J. Greer, and Tomas Nosek, all of whom contributed to Florida’s Stanley Cup-winning run. Kunin’s ability to adapt between center and wing could prove crucial in his push to crack the roster.For Florida, the move represents a low-risk signing aimed at bolstering forward depth. The Panthers remain one of the NHL’s strongest contenders after their championship campaign, and competition for roster spots is expected to be fierce. Kunin’s NHL experience and willingness to embrace a checking role may give him an edge as training camp unfolds.The signing of Luke Kunin reflects Florida’s strategy of reinforcing depth while maintaining roster flexibility. For Kunin, it represents another opportunity to re-establish himself in the NHL after bouncing between teams in recent seasons. If he can rediscover his early form and carve out a reliable role, he could become a valuable asset to the Panthers in their pursuit of back-to-back success.Also Read: NHL Trade News: Minnesota Wild secure Marco Rossi with 3-year, $15 million deal","Florida panthers add forward luke kunin as depth option for 2025-26 nhl season.

LeBron James reacts to public statements involving family

Also Read:

Tensions between ESPN analyst Stephen A. Smith and Los Angeles Lakers star LeBron James have reached a boiling point during the 2024/25 NBA season. What began as normal basketball talk has grown into something more serious, with both men openly addressing the issue on national shows. The clash has now drawn attention far beyond the court, raising questions about respect, boundaries, and whether their relationship can ever be repaired.During a Lakers home game in Los Angeles in December 2024, the event became personal, to Stephen A. Smith. LeBron James walked up to him courtside in the third quarter and charged him with attacking his son, Bronny James, Smith said during an interview on The Dan Le Batard Show on February 18, 2025.""And to me, what he did when he confronted me in the third quarter in the middle of the game court side,"" Smith said. ""Blaming me for something I did not do… and then trying to turn it into me being somebody who would go after somebody's family. That’s a line you don’t get to come back from.""Smith remarked that his remarks on Bronny were only about basketball performance, not family. He also highlighted that he had previously publicly complimented LeBron's wife, Savannah James, labeling her the ""First Lady of the NBA"" and said LeBron's mother, Gloria James, was ""a marvelous woman.""The ESPN anchor clarified that LeBron crossed a line in his estimation when he made the issue personal. Smith kept saying the damage was irreversible.LeBron James spoke about the incident weeks later on The Pat McAfee Show in January 2025. He said his main issue was not about basketball criticism, but about how Smith’s comments felt too personal when they involved his 20-year-old son, Bronny James.""He completely missed the whole point,"" LeBron said during the January 10, show. ""Never would I ever not allow people to talk about the sport and criticize players about what they do. But when you take it and you get personal with it, it’s my job to protect my household and also protect players.""Bronny James, who is in his rookie season with the Lakers, had been under close media attention throughout 2024 and 2025. After he scored 17 points and added five assists against the Milwaukee Bucks on January 4, 2025, Smith even admitted on ESPN’s First Take that he “might have been wrong” in doubting him early.Still, the public back-and-forth has left both men standing firm. Smith, says there is no path to reconciliation, while LeBron, the NBA’s all-time scoring leader at 40, continues to defend his family strongly.","Espn analyst stephen a. smith and los angeles lakers star lebron james have reached a boiling point during the 2024/25 nba season.

But Hall of Famer Eric Dickerson is now tossing out a theory that has Browns fans and NFL Twitter buzzing. According to him, the league didn’t just let Sanders slide, they made it happen on purpose.In his recent interview, Dickerson claimed he was told by a highly connected source that the NFL gave teams a direct message: don’t draft Shedeur Sanders.Dickerson said.Dickerson even went further, suggesting the Browns only ended up taking him at No. 144 because someone behind the scenes pushed them to. The idea? To prove to players what happens if you bring too much noise into the league.Before this conspiracy theory, the more common explanation was that Sanders simply rubbed some teams the wrong way. Reports surfaced during the draft process that some execs saw him as arrogant in interviews, more invested in off-field projects than playbooks, and maybe too comfortable leaning on the “Coach Prime” brand.Add in the fact that Deion Sanders was openly warning franchises about where he wanted his son to play, and suddenly the “can’t-miss” first-rounder started to look risky. That combination of family politics and personality red flags may have been enough to scare teams off, regardless of talent.While Dickerson’s claim made waves, insiders like NFL reporter Albert Breer aren’t convinced. He argued that the league had no secret directive, teams just didn’t see Sanders as a true first-round prospect.Breer said.And historically, Breer has a point, once quarterbacks slide past Round 1, they often freefall until the mid-rounds. Sanders may have been just the latest to fit that pattern.Regardless of how he got to Cleveland, Sanders isn’t walking into an easy situation. The Browns named Joe Flacco their Week 1 starter, while Sanders is battling it out with rookie Dillon Gabriel, Kenny Pickett, and Ty Huntley for backup reps.Things got spicier when Gabriel commented,which many took as shade at Sanders. Instead of firing back, Sanders brushed it off with a calm answer about leaning on his faith and not letting words get to him. Later, he revealed Gabriel told him directly the remark wasn’t meant for him anyway.Also read - “It’s not going to change my life”: Shedeur Sanders reacts to Dillon Gabriel’s viral quote that fans thought was shade",Shedeur sanders draft slide sparks new controversy after eric dickerson’s nfl allegation.
