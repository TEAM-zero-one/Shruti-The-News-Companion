Fauja Singh, the world's oldest marathon runner and British Sikh athlete of Indian origin, passed away at age 114 after being struck by a car in his native village in Punjab on July 14. He was struck by a speeding vehicle as he took a walk outside his home in Beas village. While walking on the berm of Jalandhar-Pathankot highway, he was hit by the unidentified vehicle at around 3.30pm, his son Harbinder Singh said. The family took him to a nearby hospital, but he died around 8pm.Known as the ""Turbaned Tornado,"" Singh began his running career at age 89 to cope with grief and went on to set numerous age-group world records, including becoming the first centenarian to complete a marathon.Born on April 1, 1911, in Beas Pind, Jalandhar, Punjab, Singh overcame early physical challenges, being unable to walk until age five due to weak legs. He worked as a farmer in Punjab before moving to East London in 1992 following his wife's death.Singh's remarkable running journey began in 1994 after the death of his fifth son, Kuldip. He initially took up jogging to manage his grief, but it wasn't until 2000, at age 89, that he seriously pursued running, completing the London Marathon in 6 hours and 54 minutes.In 2011, at age 100, Singh achieved an extraordinary feat by breaking eight world age-group records in a single day at the Ontario Masters Association Fauja Singh Invitational Meet in Toronto. His records included completing 100m in 23.14 seconds, 200m in 52.23 seconds, and 400m in 2:13.48.Three days after setting these records, Singh became the first centenarian to complete a marathon, finishing the Toronto Waterfront Marathon in 8 hours, 11 minutes, and 6 seconds. Despite this achievement, Guinness World Records did not recognise the feat due to the absence of a birth certificate, as official records were not maintained in India in 1911.Throughout his running career, Singh participated in numerous marathons worldwide, including events in London, New York, Toronto, and Mumbai. His personal best came at the 2003 Toronto Waterfront Marathon, which he completed in five hours and 40 minutes in the 'over 90' category.Singh's achievements extended beyond running records. He became the first non-American to receive the Ellis Island Medal of Honor in 2003 for promoting racial tolerance. He was awarded the Pride of India title in 2011 and appeared in advertising campaigns alongside David Beckham and Muhammad Ali.A biography titled ""Turbaned Tornado,"" written by Chandigarh-based columnist Khushwant Singh, was published on July 7, 2011. In 2021, a biopic titled ""Fauja,"" directed by Omung Kumar B, was announced.Singh retired from competitive running at age 101 after completing his final race, a 10km run in Hong Kong, in 1 hour 32 minutes and 28 seconds. He served as a torchbearer for the 2012 London Olympics and received recognition from Queen Elizabeth II, who personally congratulated him on his 100th birthday.Throughout his running career, Singh was supported by his personal trainer Harminder Singh and used his platform to raise funds for various charities while promoting Sikh culture globally. A vegetarian, he was also the oldest person to feature in a PETA campaign.","Fauja singh, the world's oldest marathon runner, passed away at age 114 on july 14.

LONDON: Tributes are pouring in from across the UK for Fauja Singh, the oldest marathon runner in the world, who died on Monday after being hit by a car in his Punjab village at the age of 114.Writer and filmmaker Captain Jay Singh-Sohal told TOI: “I met him many times. He was a very inspiring figure who took great pride in doing what he was doing and in maintaining his Sikh identity with a turban and uncut beard, and in turn, he inspired many others. Not only did he inspire people of all ages to be physically active, but he also promoted the Sikh identity and took pride in doing so and showing young Sikhs, in particular, that their religious adherence was not a barrier to achieving great things. ”Fauja Singh discovered running in his 80s as a means of remaining active and lifting boredom as he became older. He quickly became a celebrity.“He was very down-to-earth and humble regardless of his fame. He ate very simply — just daal and rice. His discipline, simple living, and deep humility left a lasting mark on me,” said MP Preet Kaur Gill.MP Tanmanjeet Singh said he would be “sorely missed.”“Despite his extraordinary and record-breaking achievements, he was completely down to earth and incredibly generous with his time,” recalled Hardeep Singh, deputy-director, Network of Sikh Organisations.Nick Bitel, London Marathon Group CEO, said: “Fauja Singh was an incredible, inspirational human being who epitomised the Spirit of the London Marathon. Our thoughts are with his family and friends.”Fauja Singh, now British, had been living back in Beas Pind, his birth village near Jalandhar, for the past five years, ever since the pandemic, when the accident happened.He was born in 1911 and had six children. One daughter died during childbirth in the 1980s and soon after that, his wife, Gian Kaur, died, and then his son, Kuldeep, died in an accident in front of him. That led to depression and so he came to the UK to stay with his son, Sukhjinder, and lived in Ilford. “He was a bit bored in an alien country where, at that time, there was not much Punjabi media. He went back to India to his family and then they sent him back to the UK. Then he started doing things for charity, like a 20km walk, and then he saw people running on TV and decided to do a marathon,” explained his British coach Harmander Singh, who met him in November 1999. Harmander trained him in just 11 weeks to run his first marathon, the London Marathon, in 2000, aged 89. Fauja Singh did nine marathons in total, his last one aged 101 in 2012 in London, which he completed in seven hours, 49 minutes.“He raised the profiles of charities and he always said it was the blessings of the beneficiaries of those charities that kept him going,” Harmander said. Fauja Singh liked his celebrity status as he got lots of attention, which kept him going, as many elderly people feel neglected.“He enjoyed the free socialising that came with his status and when he was invited by the former president of Pakistan, Pervez Musharraf, to run the Lahore Marathon, he couldn’t believe that a poor illiterate farmer who had never gone to school was rubbing shoulders with a head of state,” Harmander said. Fauja Singh walked or jogged for 10 miles a day and ate a minimal diet, and was very light in weight. “Some medical students did bone density tests on him and found his left leg had the bone density of a 30-year-old and his right leg had one of a 20-year-old, and his response was, ‘I always knew my left leg was weak’,” Harmander added.His running group “Sikhs In The City”, is raising money for a clubhouse for the route he used to run along which will be named after him. The group is also appealing for anyone whose life he touched to send messages for a memorial book.","Fauja singh discovered running in his 80s as a means of remaining active and lifting boredom as he became older.

""Let's just say I'm pissed off at the way I went out. I put so much into it, and I don't feel as though the effort was reciprocated to put a stamp on what I've accomplished.”

Criticism directed at match build-up and execution

What lies ahead for Goldberg





WWE Hall of Famer Goldberg is disappointed following what would be his final match at Saturday Night's Main Event XL. The 58-year-old wrestling legend was expecting to walk out of a retirement bout this past weekend with his head held high, only to leave the ring feeling disrespected instead of celebrated after his showdown with Gunther. Goldberg told Ariel Helwani on The MMA Hour that he was very upset about how his iconic career came to an end.In a candid and emotionally charged moment, Goldberg said:It was billed as a class, and fans were expecting a seismic showdown, but while it was physical and competitive, the match never really had the epic conclusion that many had hoped for. Although Goldberg appeared to be in remarkable shape and had fantastic cardio, the pacing and story of the match lacked the weight of a retirement from someone of his stature. Others have blamed WWE's booking, claiming they did not give the venerated veteran the emotional payoff and respect a star of his stature deserved, while not holding back on criticism of Gunther's performance.As if that wasn't enough, Goldberg's farewell right after his match was suddenly interrupted on live television.However, other reports stated that WWE experienced timing issues during the show earlier in the night, which caused the broadcast to cut off just as Goldberg began speaking. The millions watching at home, meanwhile, were not gifted a proper goodbye; he finished the speech for the live audience.Also Read: “I can see this sparkle in Gage’s eyes”: Triple H sees star potential in Bill Goldberg’s son for WWE future Although it was a sour finish, Goldberg reiterated that his story isn't in the squared circle. He suggested that there were plans aplenty to fulfill outside the ring, including a family get-together, as well as pursuing various media opportunities in the pipeline. But his statements to Helwani made clear that this was not the sendoff he imagined for a decades-long career and multiple pro wrestling promotions.For fans, this moment marks the close of an age. For Goldberg, the pain of an unceremonious exit may last forever, but so too will the craftsmanship of a man who created the blueprints for present-day pro wrestling.","Wwe hall of famer goldberg is disappointed following what would be his final match at saturday night's main event xl.

Competition for Al Horford’s Services

Why Al Horford Makes Sense for the Milwaukee Bucks

Theare reportedly interested in adding a seasoned veteran to their frontcourt in the form of, according to a report from NBA insider Marc J. Spears. With Horford expected to part ways with the Boston Celtics this offseason, Milwaukee joins a list of contenders keeping close tabs on the 39-year-old center.The Milwaukee Bucks are coming off a busy summer that saw them secure Myles Turner on a four-year, $108.9 million deal. While Turner is expected to anchor the frontcourt, the addition of Al Horford would offer the team a reliable and experienced backup, strengthening Milwaukee’s frontcourt rotation with both size and floor-spacing.Despite his age, Horford remains a valuable contributor. During the 2024–25 NBA season, he played 60 regular-season games for Boston, starting in 42. He averaged:Horford also played a key role in helping the Celtics win the 2024 NBA Championship, reinforcing his value as a playoff-tested contributor.The Milwaukee Bucks aren’t alone in their pursuit. According to Marc J. Spears, several teams remain in the mix: “Golden State expected him to sign last week — he didn’t,” Spears said. “Lakers, Milwaukee, Atlanta, I believe, are also interested.” (H/t: Sporting News)While the Golden State Warriors were initially considered frontrunners, Horford’s delay in signing suggests he is still weighing his options. The Los Angeles Lakers and Atlanta Hawks are also reportedly in the running, making it a competitive market for the veteran’s services.Here’s why the Milwaukee Bucks may see Al Horford as a perfect fit:- Locker Room Leadership: With a young supporting cast being assembled around Giannis Antetokounmpo, Horford’s playoff experience and professionalism could be a steadying influence.- Floor Spacing: His ability to knock down threes adds a different dimension to the Bucks’ offense, especially when Giannis attacks the paint.- Defensive Versatility: While no longer at his peak, Horford remains a capable team defender who can switch, help, and rotate effectively.Milwaukee’s interest in Horford highlights a smart approach to building a title-contending roster around its superstar. As they aim for a deeper playoff run in 2025–26, adding a proven winner like Horford could be the subtle but strategic move that makes a significant difference.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Golden State Warriors predicted to land $250 million Phoenix Suns star guard as potential backcourt partner for Stephen Curry As of now, Al Horford remains unsigned, and the Milwaukee Bucks, along with other suitors, will await his decision.

Shemar Stewart’s NFL future in turmoil as Cincinnati Bengals contract dispute fuels Texas A&M comeback rumors,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/shemar-stewarts-nfl-future-in-turmoil-as-cincinnati-bengals-contract-dispute-fuels-texas-am-comeback-rumors/articleshow/122531070.cms,"Photo by Logan Bowles/Getty Images

Why Shemar Stewart’s Texas A&M workouts could derail his Cincinnati Bengals NFL rookie deal

The legal battle that could define Shemar Stewart’s Cincinnati Bengals and Texas A&M football future

What’s next for Shemar Stewart as Cincinnati Bengals contract talks stall and Texas A&M return looms

Shemar Stewart was supposed to be the Cincinnati Bengals’ prized rookie this fall. Instead, he’s back in College Station, sweating it out at Texas A&M workouts while his NFL future hangs by a thread. Selected 17th overall in April’s NFL Draft, the defensive lineman now faces a high-stakes contract dispute that has left him with two risky options: negotiate with a team that currently holds all the power or fight for the legal right to play college football again. With millions in earnings and an entire year of development on the line, Stewart’s next move could shape the rest of his career—and everyone’s watching to see what happens next.While Shemar Stewart has yet to sign with the Bengals, this summer he’s been spotted working out with the Texas A&M football team. His presence in College Station has surprised many in the NFL and college football worlds, raising questions about NCAA eligibility rules and the leverage he actually has.Cover 3 podcast host Bud Elliott shared details about where and when these workouts have been happening, and who tipped him off about Stewart’s involvement.“He’s been at College Station. He’s been fully involved in workouts,” Elliott said on the show. He added, “A guy who has had some good (Texas) A&M stuff in the past, he hit me, he's like, 'Hey, Shemar might end up back here.'”Stewart’s contract standoff with the Bengals centers on default language in his rookie deal, a typical but often contentious part of NFL Draft negotiations. The Bengals selected him 17th overall in April, but no deal has been finalized, leaving him in limbo as training camps approach. Despite the tension, neither Stewart’s camp nor the Bengals have issued any new public statements updating the situation, deepening the uncertainty around when—or even if—a resolution will come.Even if Stewart hopes to suit up again for Texas A&M, that path is anything but simple. NCAA rules don’t currently allow him to play this season unless he wins a legal fight to restore his eligibility—a move that could trigger a lengthy court battle.Elliott underlined that uncertainty when he said on the podcast, “It may not be legal yet, but everything in the NCAA ecosphere is subject to litigation.”But there’s another catch: even if he did get a waiver to play for Texas A&M, the Bengals would still hold his NFL Draft rights. The only way Stewart can force his way back into next year’s draft and break from Cincinnati’s control would be to sit out football entirely this fall. That means missing an entire season of development—and risking millions in future earnings.For now, Stewart remains caught in a contractual maze that few rookies navigate successfully. He’s kept himself in top shape with his old team in College Station, but whether he’ll actually see the field for the Aggies—or the Bengals—any time soon is anyone’s guess.Shemar Stewart’s rookie journey is shaping up to be one of the NFL Draft’s most dramatic stories. Instead of preparing for his first pro training camp, he’s back at Texas A&M, clashing with Cincinnati over a contract stalemate that threatens to derail his career. With legal hurdles, NCAA eligibility rules, and his draft rights all in play, Stewart faces a defining choice: fight in court for a college return, compromise with the Bengals, or sit out and re-enter the draft next spring.What do you think? Should Stewart push for Texas A&M, hold out for the NFL, or find a way to settle with Cincinnati?

The growth path of Dylan Nolan: From Junior Kings to USHL stardom

Profile of Connor Brown : A skilled acquisition for the Tri-City Storm

A high-profile trade has resulted in Dylan Nolan, son of ex-NHL player Owen Nolan, entering a new environment by joining the Waterloo Black Hawks. After an exciting rookie campaign followed with some positive exploits in junior hockey, the young forward will now attempt to fit switching gears and aggressive styles of play while adding his scoring touch to a different system. Having been an instrumental move in his burgeoning USHL career, the ripples expanded to encompass both franchises.Dylan Nolan's local roots barely existed in junior hockey before he made the leap into the USHL. While with the San Jose Jr. Sharks, he made a great impact by scoring 50 points in his final season there. His transition to the LA Junior Kings only seemed to further Moe's cause, as back-to-back playoff appearances set the tone for his leadership on the ice. It's in his final year in LA that Nolan exploded onto the scene, delivering a jaw-dropping 80-point offensive season, netting 34 goals and assists to 46, firmly establishing his offensive presence.The breakout season produced an opportunity for a USHL career with the Tri-City Storm. Though his rookie campaign saw modest results, just two goals in 55 games, his playoff presence was notable. Ironically, one of his goals came against the very team he now joins: the Waterloo Black Hawks.Tri-City Storm receives Connor Brown, a calculated attempt at balancing youthful potential with proven college experience. Hailing from Florida, Brown was drafted by Waterloo in 2021 and proved to be a consistent playmaker with 21 goals and 42 assists during his stint. Although last season was sidelined due to injury, Brown spent time with Western Michigan University, which speaks to his versatility and future potential at the NCAA level.His inclusion in the deal gives Tri-City a forward who has technical skills complemented by solid playmaking instincts that would suit well in the Storm system as they try to bounce back from last year's early playoff outage.Also Read: Jordan Binnington and Cris Prosperi celebrate son Johnny’s first birthday with a sporty twist Dylan Nolan moving to Waterloo opens a plethora of opportunities for him as well as the Black Hawks, who are now eager to make the best of his energy and potential.

As the new USHL season is upon us, this is a trade to keep an eye on.","Dylan nolan goes to the waterloo black hawks in a trade for connor brown.

His hustle on both ends helped improve the Hornets to a 3-0 Summer League record.Despite being off the court, Flagg remained his former teammate’s biggest fan. Back on draft night, when Knueppel was selected fourth overall during Flagg’s live interview, the Dallas forward couldn’t hold back his excitement. “K Dot!! Let’s go! Oh my God! Let’s go!” Flagg shouted.“It’s surreal. Kon was my roommate last year, so just to see him have that moment with his family—it’s insane. That really just gave me chills. That was amazing.”The connection between Flagg and Knueppel was born during their standout freshman year at Duke, where both were pivotal in pushing the Blue Devils to the NCAA Final Four and winning the ACC Championship. Flagg led the team with 19.2 points per game and brought home a slew of national awards, while Knueppel added 14.4 points per game and was named ACC Tournament MVP.Now, on different teams, their paths will only cross twice during the regular NBA season— but if Summer League was any indication, their bond is just as strong as ever. The Duke basketball program even celebrated the postgame handshake by sharing the clip with the caption: ""Kon 🤝 Coop @NBASummerLeague.""Also Read: LeBron James embraces Victor Wembanyama after San Antonio Spurs star gets medical clearance to return to basketball action","Cooper flagg, the no. 1 overall pick of the dallas mavericks, reunited with his former duke teammate and roommate kon knueppel before their teams clashed in las vegas.
