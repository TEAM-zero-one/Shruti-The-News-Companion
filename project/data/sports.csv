Dwyane Wade reflects on LeBron James in Year 23





Dwyane Wade and LeBron James memories from the Heat era





The bond between Dwyane Wade and LeBron James has always been special. As James steps into Year 23, Wade no longer speaks as a former teammate alone. He speaks as a fan who understands what the league is slowly preparing to lose. Recently, Wade commented on James’ 23rd NBA season comes contemplating who shared championships, pressure, and history with James at the highest level.Wade’s words arrive at a time when every appearance by LeBron feels meaningful. The milestones keep coming, yet the uncertainty lingers. For Wade, that reality has shifted how he watches the game now. There is admiration, reflection, and a sense of time closing in on an era few believed possible.Speaking candidly, Dwyane Wade did not hide the emotion tied to watching James still perform at an elite level. His appreciation felt personal and honest.“I’m like you guys, I’m a fan. I know it’s like, ‘he’s old, he should retire’. But at the same time, I’m gonna miss him… He’s just taking these moments in, we don’t know when the last one is coming.”Wade’s praise for James is not a one time thing. Previously, in episode of Wy Network by Dwyane Wade, the Heat legend shared his candid thoughts.“I have the greatest body of work of anybody that’s ever put a Miami Heat jersey on,” Wade said.“If you wanna be honest, LeBron James is the greatest player to ever put a Miami Heat jersey on… I’m the greatest player in the history of the Miami Heat for the body of work I had wearing that jersey, but I’m not the greatest player to ever put on a Miami Heat jersey.”Dwyane Wade retired from the NBA in 2019 after 16 seasons, mostly with the Miami Heat. He admitted his burst was fading and the joy was gone, even as a Hall of Famer. Since retiring, Wade thrives as a businessman, media voice, and NBA owner, while proudly supporting his daughter Zaya.Wade recently revisited another iconic chapter with humor while recalling the famous Big Three introduction. His memory of that moment revealed both restraint and foresight.“Let’s run that tape who was it again. It’s one voice and look at the one in the middle laughing like young boy over here was talking… he was feeling the moment… look I look put my head down, look I put my head down, ‘I’m like hey man look now I’mma supportive teammate.'”“I’m my rubbing my knee I’m like ‘Oh I don’t know if I got that much… He trippin’, look I ain’t said a word… That was that supposed to have been a moment that was just for our fans and it should not have been the world should not have seen.”“That’s something that you say internal, you know what I mean? We going to win every year but really you know how hard it is to win one year. I don’t care what kind of talent you have so that’s why I was sitting there like oh my man don’t know yet.”“But he did go to the Finals 10 years in a row though. He damn sure didn’t like about how many opportunities. He almost did it, he ain’t lie… Listen, we went 4, he went 10.”In September this year, the 2025 Basketball Hall of Fame weekend carried special meaning for LeBron James and Dwyane Wade. While Wade was inducted in 2023 and James awaits retirement, both attended to honor the 2008 Team USA “Redeem Team.” The group’s induction marked a defining chapter in USA Basketball history.LeBron James is not stopping despite recent injury setbacks. The King got back on his feet and made a strong comeback. So far, he has not shared any update on his retirement.Also Read: ""The Kings are here"": LeBron James & Jay-Z's courtside moment sends NBA fans into meltdown","Dwyane wade retired from the nba in 2019 after 16 seasons, mostly with the miami heat.

Who attended the Chiefs vs Chargers game in NFL week 15?



It was a must-win game for Kansas City Chiefs against the Los Angeles Chargers to keep the playoff hopes alive. But at the end of the day, it was Justin Herbert's team that made sure that Patrick Mahomes' team misses the NFL playoff picture after 11 years, something the Chiefs are not used to.Many celebrities from Chiefs side came to cheer for the team but it all went in vain. A star-studded stand also could not help Travis Kelce and co from a defeat that would surely take some time to digest. Chargers beat Chiefs by 16-13. Here's all the celebrities who attended the game.Taylor Swift does not need a spotlight to steal attention. Sometimes, the quietest presence says the most. On a cold night at Arrowhead Stadium, with playoff implications hanging in the air, Swift slipped back into a familiar setting. She was there for football, family and a moment that felt strikingly normal despite the global fame attached to her name.Swift was seen sharing a suite with Kylie Kelce and Jason Kelce’s young daughters, bundled up in a chunky gold, brown and orange jacket against the cold. In one clip, she gently lifted one of her soon to be nieces and held the child on her hip, smiling as the game played on. In another moment, her mother Andrea watched alongside Donna Kelce, turning the night into a rare snapshot of blended family time inside one of the NFL’s loudest venues.This low key approach has become a pattern. Just a week earlier, Swift attended the Chiefs game against the Houston Texans without drawing attention. She arrived unnoticed and barely appeared on the broadcast, a sharp contrast to previous seasons. Fans only realized she was there after spotting her in a suite with Selena Gomez and Lena Dunham, long after kickoff.There is intention behind the discretion. A source told Us Weekly in October that Swift chose to stay more out of sight because the attention had become “too excessive.” Since then, she has avoided being photographed arriving at Arrowhead Stadium, keeping the focus on the game rather than the gates.The night also included familiar Chiefs faces. Brittany Mahomes was present with son Bronze, wearing a custom white Mahomes Chiefs outfit while cheering from the stands. Though the season has been uneven, Brittany remained a style standout, from her symbolic denim looks to coordinated outfits with baby Golden. On this night, however, fashion took a back seat as she watched Patrick Mahomes endure a scary injury, a reminder that even glamorous game days can turn tense in seconds.At Arrowhead, the cameras missed the arrival, but they caught something better. A superstar blending into family, football and the cold Kansas City night.Also Read: Patrick Mahomes's wife Brittany's game-day fashion ages badly as Chiefs’ disastrous defeat overshadows her attention-grabbing fit","Kansas city chiefs lost 16-13 to los angeles chargers in nfl week 15.

How do Connor McDavid and Kris Knoblauch view Edmonton Oilers’ Goaltending trade?

Edmonton Oilers Trade Skinner + Kulak For Jarry + Poulin Thoughts | Quinn Hughes To Wild

On Saturday, the Edmonton Oilers' locker room was filled with a combination of feelings and expectations as the team prepared for a huge roster change before their game against the Toronto Maple Leafs. The exchange that sent goalie Stuart Skinner and defenseman Brett Kulak to the Pittsburgh Penguins was a drastic change for a team that had trusted both players during their long playoff runs. The names of Connor McDavid , Kris Knoblauch, Tristan Jarry, and Spencer Stastney were soon among the top talks of Edmonton, looking ahead to the future.The move was meant to tackle the goalkeeping issues, but the human aspect of the decision could not be overlooked. Skinner had been with the Oilers for parts of six seasons and had helped the team reach the Stanley Cup Finals twice in a row. Kulak was also a dependable player on the defense. After the morning skate, McDavid talked about how hard the moment was, and he made it clear that the loss of the familiar faces weighed on the team, even as they were getting ready for a new chapter.McDavid called the trade a tough decision that the team had to make, and at the same time pointed to the positive side of the situation by saying how much the group would miss Skinner and Kulak.Head Coach Kris Knoblauch was equally supportive, stating that both players had been very dependable over the years, contributing not only on but also off the ice. Another ex-Oilers defenseman, Troy Stecher, who now plays for Toronto, offered his insight into the situation, too. He referred to the trade as part of the business and wished his ex-colleagues nothing but the best in their new home, Pittsburgh.The focus was then directed towards the newly recruited players. Knoblauch showed trust in Tristan Jarry and mentioned his experience and the good results he had in the past, despite a hard previous season. Jarry, who got the call against Toronto, shared that the last day and a half had been full of emotions but added that getting to play with superstars like McDavid and Leon Draisaitl was a thrill. At the same time, the rapid development of Spencer Stastney, who has been skating and moving the puck well, caught the coaching staff's attention, which believed that such a skill would bring the team more balance.The Oilers are taking change with a careful and optimistic attitude. The loss of reliable teammates is painful, but Edmonton is convinced that this kind of change will help the team to be better and thus to navigate through the season.Also Read: NHL Injury Update: Evgeni Malkin sidelined as Pittsburgh Penguins face playoff pressure","Edmonton oilers traded goalie stuart skinner and defenseman brett kulak to the pittsburgh penguins.

The NFL legend highlights John Cena’s influence beyond titles as his final match approaches

Tom Brady was not part of John Cena’s world, at least not on paper. Different sports, different crowds, different stages. Yet as Cena moves toward his final match, Brady’s words found their way into the moment, offering something quieter than praise and heavier than nostalgia.Retirements often arrive with long speeches and rehearsed emotion. This one felt different. Cena’s career has stretched across eras, pressure, and constant reinvention. Brady did not talk about wins or fame. He pointed to impact, to the people reached along the way, and to a kind of influence that stays after the lights dim.Brady’s tribute did not try to sum up Cena’s career. It did not need to. The message stayed focused on something deeper than records, something harder to measure. Impact. The kind that reaches people who never step into the ring but still feel connected to what happens there.“Hey John, Congratulations on an incredible career. You have impacted lives, so many people inside the rain and outside the rain. Good luck in your last match.”The line stood out because Brady knows how endings work. He has lived through them, stepped away, returned, and finally closed the door on his own terms.That perspective gives his words weight. By pointing to Cena’s influence both inside and outside the ring, Brady acknowledged the work that rarely gets attention. The discipline. The consistency.That kind of visibility carries weight. It asks more than performance. It demands consistency, patience, and restraint, year after year, even when the attention does not slow down.For Cena, influence was never limited to titles or scripted moments. Fans watched how he handled responsibility, how often he showed up for causes that mattered, and how he stayed accountable in public. Brady’s message reflected that side of the story. It hinted that success is not only about what you collect along the way, but about the people who feel seen because of you.As Cena approaches his final match, the exchange feels understated, not sentimental. Two long careers brushed past each other through mutual respect. No shared arena. No rivalry. Just an understanding shaped by pressure, longevity, and the cost of staying relevant for so long. The kind, that lasts long after the final bell rings. Some legacies never need an encore.Also read: Brittany Mahomes & Patrick Mahomes vs Travis Kelce & Taylor Swift combined Net Worth: Who truly reigns supreme?","The nfl legend highlights john cena’s influence beyond titles.

Brittany Mahomes turned the ‘Chiefs girlies Christmas party’ into a fashion headline

Patrick Mahomes got public backup, and Brittany Mahomes answered with 3 words

Brittany Mahomes turned her “Chiefs girlies Christmas party” into the kind of Instagram moment that instantly got picked apart, praised, and reposted. She hosted the get-together this week for the Kansas City Chiefs’ wives and girlfriends, then shared snapshots that put her white mini dress and oversized black bow front and center, per reporting from Yahoo (Madz Dizon) and Us Weekly (Grace Riley).The timing is part of why it popped. Kansas City is 6-7 after a loss to the Houston Texans, and the Chiefs are heading into a key stretch with the Los Angeles Chargers next on the schedule. While Patrick Mahomes keeps the football talk short, Brittany keeps showing up as the loudest off-field presence in his corner, and she is not shy about it.Brittany Mahomes, 30, posted her look ahead of hosting the “Chiefs girlies Christmas party” on Instagram on Dec. 11, according to Us Weekly. The outfit was built around a fitted white minidress with a high neckline and cape sleeves, finished with a large black bow across the chest. She matched it with sheer black tights, pointed-toe heels with bows, diamond dangling earrings, and a black clutch decorated with crystals and pearls, per both outlets.The comments did the rest. Yahoo noted fans flooding her page with reactions like “This is prob my fave look for you ever!” and “Your best look yet!! Stunning,” along with “You look pretty as a present.”Us Weekly added that Brittany later posted party gift bags and credited brands she partnered with, writing: “Hosted the Chiefs girlies Christmas Party Tonight! ✨🎄,” followed by: “Thank you to the best partners for spoiling us!!! @whoop @hydrojug @boggbags @dolceglow @amazon @abercrombie @diviofficial. ”She did not confirm a full guest list. Us Weekly specifically noted she did not share which Chiefs WAGs attended, or whether Taylor Swift was there.Brittany’s party posts landed during a rough patch for Kansas City. One report framed it plainly: the Chiefs are 6-7 after the Texans loss, and they are running out of room to slip if they want to keep their postseason hopes alive.The same report also tied Brittany’s social moment to the bigger conversation around Patrick Mahomes, which has gotten louder with every loss. On the “Up & Adams” podcast, Kevin Durant pushed back hard on any legacy talk, saying: “What kind of a question is that? That makes no sense at all,” and adding, “If anybody is questioning Pat Mahomes’ legacy from a one-off year, he can miss the playoffs for the rest of his career, I don’t give a damn. This man is Patrick Mahomes.” Durant continued: “How many championships does he have? Three? Come on now. Are we really going to question Pat Mahomes, Chris Jones, Travis Kelce? He’s still an all-time great, potentially the greatest of all time.”Brittany saw the clip circulate and replied: “Let them know.” Mahomes also credited her in his weekly interview on 96.5 The Fan, saying: “Having a great wife helps out a ton,” and “Her being able to handle the other extracurricular stuff I can’t be there for… getting the family settled.” He also added: “I was able to spend Thanksgiving with them because we played on Thursday. That part was cool.”If Kansas City steadies itself against the Chargers, this week reads like a tidy headline. If the Chiefs stumble again, Brittany’s posts will keep getting treated like a side plot to the main drama: the league is watching Mahomes, and she is making it clear she is watching right back.",Brittany mahomes hosts a ‘chiefs girlies christmas party’ and draws strong fan reactions.

Dianna Russini’s reporting frames Joe Burrow’s mood as “I want to win,” not a goodbye

The Cincinnati Bengals’ “operation” is still the problem behind the scenes

Joe Burrow sounded drained this week, and the clip got treated like a retirement teaser. It was not that, according to The Athletic’s Dianna Russini, who reported that people close to the Cincinnati Bengals quarterback saw the reaction as overblown.Russini’s reporting also pushed back on the two loudest leaps. One, that Burrow’s comments were rooted in mental health concerns. Two, that he was sending a trade warning shot. As of mid-December, Cincinnati is 4-9 and facing playoff elimination with a Week 15 game against the Baltimore Ravens, so the frustration is real. The exit-ramp theories are not, per Russini.Russini wrote that someone close to Burrow brushed off the concern when she brought up how down he sounded.""Someone else close to Burrow said: 'Everyone is being a little dramatic. This isn’t mental health, this isn’t depression, this is I want to win,'"" Russini wrote. ""Teammates, coaches and people close to Burrow all say he just wants to play football, talk football and win football games.""She also addressed the trade and stepping-away chatter directly.""The answer is no. Burrow, I’m told, hasn’t asked for a trade or even hinted at stepping away,"" Russini wrote.That aligns with how Bengals Wire’s Chris Roling framed it on Dec. 13. Roling wrote that Burrow “isn’t going anywhere,” and that the somber tone was more about being tired of losing than applying pressure for an exit.Russini’s reporting did not paint Burrow as thrilled with everything in the building, either. It narrowed the frustration to how the Bengals run parts of their football operation.""Does that mean he’s thrilled with everything inside the Bengals’ building? No. People close to him have made it clear that certain parts of the Bengals’ operation, with the smallest coaching and scouting staffs in the league, have previously frustrated him.""Roling’s Bengals Wire report made a similar point, separating Burrow’s mindset from a meltdown narrative. Roling wrote there is “no frustration from Burrow with his offensive line,” calling it the best Burrow has had since entering the NFL, and instead aimed the heat at the team’s scouting and player personnel side. Roling described that group, led by Duke Tobin, as having “colossally failed over the years,” adding that things “came to a head” during Burrow’s injury stretch when Al Golden’s defense was described as tracking toward historically bad numbers.Here’s the clean read on what Russini and Roling are both signaling: Burrow’s message is not “get me out.” It’s “stop wasting seasons.” With Cincinnati sitting at 4-9, the pressure is heading toward an offseason of changes anyway. Burrow can stay put and still force the organization to evolve, because losing does not get easier to tolerate just because the quarterback is loyal.","The athletic’s dianna russini reported that people close to the cincinnati bengals quarterback saw the reaction as overblown.

What to expect from John Cena vs GUNTHER and other key storylines

WWE includes John Cena's farewell this weekend as we lead into Saturday Night's Main Event on Saturday, December 13, 2025, where Cena will have what WWE is promoting as his final in-ring match. The match with GUNTHER, which emerged from a build with GUNTHER via the booking of the ""Last Time Is Now"" tournament, is set to be a hard-hitting, technical exhibition aimed at giving Cena a big send-off while also pushing the opponent forward at the same time, at the same venue.The entire event is packed with multibrand showdowns and title ramifications, including Undisputed WWE Champion Cody Rhodes vs. NXT Champion Oba Femi, AJ Styles & Dragon Lee defending the World Tag Team Titles, and Bayley vs. Sol Ruca in a premier women’s division bout. WWE has carded the show as streaming live on Peacock in the US and regional broadcasts outside of the US.Saturday Night’s Main Event is scheduled to begin at 8:00 p.m. ET / 5:00 p.m. PT on December 13 in the U.S., exclusively on Peacock for American audiences.

Viewers should check local listings for possible pre show programming or minor scheduling adjustments as WWE often updates timing for kickoff segments.Get ready for an evening with a nostalgic feel with a competitive edge. Cena can say farewell to the company where he spent the majority of his two-decade career, and GUNTHER's character has made it clear that he plans to ruin the moment by putting Cena through a long technical loss instead of the emotional moment we would all like to see. That dynamic creates the environment for either a heroic send-off for John Cena, or a conclusive changing of the guard from one of WWE's most successful 21st century stars.In the meantime, on that same card, Cody Rhodes takes on Oba Femi in a hypothetical champion versus champion match-up that could alter the course of two titles as we head into 2026.

The NFL fined T.J. Watt, and the timing is brutal

Pittsburgh’s margin gets thinner without Watt

T.J. Watt just had a scary medical week. The Pittsburgh Steelers star also got hit in the wallet.The NFL fined Watt $11,593 for a late hit from Pittsburgh’s Week 14 win over the Baltimore Ravens, days after he underwent surgery to repair a partially collapsed lung suffered during a dry needling session at the team facility.The league issued Watt a $11,593 fine for a late hit on a play with 2:12 left in the second quarter against Baltimore, when he jumped onto a moving pile as the Ravens tried to finish a Derrick Henry run. Watt did not draw a flag on the play, but the NFL still fined him ahead of Week 15.Multiple reports noted it was Watt’s first fine of the season and the only fine handed out from the Steelers-Ravens game.The fine landed as Watt recovers from an injury that put him in the hospital for three days. His brother, J.J. Watt, confirmed the surgery and shared an update that included: ""Yesterday TJ had successful surgery to stabilize and repair a partially collapsed lung suffered Wednesday after a dry needling treatment session at the facility,"" and ""Recovery timeline is still TBD, but all went well and he is being released from the hospital today. ""Watt’s wife, Dani Watt, also posted a statement after the procedure: “Yesterday TJ completed successful surgery to stabilize and repair a partially collapsed lung suffered early Wednesday after a dry needling treatment session at the facility.It has been a very long hard couple of days but he will be home soon to recover,” she wrote. “Thank you all for the incredible outpouring of love, prayers, and support the past couple of days. And praise God for the amazing medical teams at both hospitals! 🙏🏼❤️”On the football side, Pittsburgh ruled Watt out for the Week 15 game against the Miami Dolphins on Monday Night Football, per head coach Mike Tomlin’s Friday update in the report you shared.This is where it stops being just “news” and starts being a problem for Pittsburgh.The Steelers still control their playoff destiny, with a slight lead in the AFC North and four games left in the regular season. But the schedule does not soften up: Dolphins, Detroit Lions, Cleveland Browns, and Ravens.And the stat that matters most is ugly. Pittsburgh is 1-11 all time without Watt on the field, per the dump you provided. If you’re looking for why this fine is already irritating Steelers fans, it’s because the team cannot afford distractions, missed snaps, or anything that turns into a story bigger than the next opponent.With Watt out, Pittsburgh’s edge rotation shifts fast. The Steelers are expected to lean on Alex Highsmith and Nick Herbig at outside linebacker, with Jack Sawyer working in. The piece you shared also noted DeMarvin Leal could be elevated from the practice squad as another option in the front.Meanwhile, the fine itself is already getting pushback in Steelers circles. Steelers Depot’s Joe Clark called it: “It’s a really ticky-tack definition of a late hit, as Watt jumped on a pile of players trying to bring down Derrick Henry while the Ravens RB was still up,” and added: “It really doesn’t look like a play that rose to a level of a fine.”The Steelers can complain. They can laugh it off. None of that helps if Watt misses more than one week. If he comes back quickly, this becomes a weird footnote in an already wild week. If he does not, Pittsburgh’s biggest “must-have” piece turns into a weekly question, and that is how seasons slip.","Pittsburgh steelers linebacker t.j. watt was fined $11,593 for a late hit against the ravens days after undergoing surgery for a partially collapsed lung.

NEW DELHI: Lionel Messi’s programme in Hyderabad on Saturday offered a clear contrast to the disorder seen earlier in Kolkata, as the second leg of the GOAT India Tour passed without disruption and ended on a smooth note.After a troubled start in the City of Joy, Hyderabad offered a setting where the event was allowed to breathe. The structure held, the crowd stayed in place, and the programme ran as intended, drawing a clear line between what had gone wrong earlier in the day and what was put right later.Messi arrived in Hyderabad at around 5.40 pm, following a difficult opening leg of his three-day, four-city GOAT India Tour 2025. Telangana chief minister A Revanth Reddy received him at the Taj Falaknuma Palace before the Argentine headed to the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium.The stands were close to full when Messi walked out, dressed simply in a green crew-neck T-shirt, black trousers and sports shoes. This time, there was no rush, no scramble. He stayed for about an hour, at ease, moving through the programme without the strain that had cut short his time in Kolkata.“I am very happy to be in Hyderabad in the midst of all the love and affection shown by you all,” Messi said through a translator, acknowledging the crowd.Messi, along with Inter Miami teammates Luis Suarez and Rodrigo De Paul, took part in the GOAT Cup penalty shootout, with Revanth Reddy also joining them on the field in football attire. The players later conducted football clinics for children before the formalities drew to a close.Senior Congress leader Rahul Gandhi joined the group towards the end of the event during the felicitation ceremony, with photographs taken in front of the sponsor hoardings lining the ground.Messi presented the GOAT Cup to Singareni RR 9, winners of the seven-a-side exhibition match and a team representing the chief minister. Reddy presented a memento to Messi, while Gandhi handed one to Suarez.Before stepping onto the field, Messi spent time inside the stadium, looking at photographs on the walls and speaking with officials. He waved to fans from behind a glass barrier, then later offered glimpses of the touch and control that have defined his career, juggling and passing the ball with Suarez, De Paul and Reddy. A slow walk around the stadium followed, with Messi acknowledging the crowd along the way.Earlier in the day, scenes in Kolkata were very different. Around 50,000 spectators, many of whom paid between Rs 4,000 and Rs 12,000 — and in some cases up to Rs 20,000 in the black market — were left angry as politicians, VVIPs and security personnel surrounded Messi, limiting visibility for fans.The situation escalated when spectators threw bottles, which are banned inside stadiums. Food packets were also found inside the venue. Chairs were pulled out and thrown, and fibreglass seats were damaged across the field and the synthetic track.Messi will travel to Mumbai on Sunday for the third leg of the GOAT India Tour 2025. He will conclude his visit on Monday in New Delhi, where he is scheduled to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi.","Messi arrived in hyderabad at around 5.40 pm, following a difficult opening leg of his three-day, four-city goat india tour 2025.

Shivam Mavi opens up on IPL snubs, lonely domestic grind, confidence before auction

By the time the Indian team reached the HPCA stadium on Saturday evening, the temperature here in the hills dropped significantly. As the three and a half-hours long practice session progressed in the chilly weather, the jitters in the Indian camp became more apparent.South Africa’s all-format tour of India is in its last week. The visitors have managed to bare open India's deficiencies in more ways than one would have expected. Seldom does the Indian team go through a practice session as extensive and intense on a match eve as it did on the eve of Sunday's third T20I. As is the norm with this team, it was officially an optional session. But only Tilak Verma and Arshdeep Singh skipped the session. The South African team, on the other hand, took the day off and went hiking in the hills. They feel they are in a better space with the series locked at 1-1.The T20 team under head coach Gautam Gambhir seemed to be on auto-pilot mode for over a year. However, two months away from the T20 World Cup, glaring problems have surfaced and the edginess is unmistakable. It starts with the struggles of captain Suryakumar Yadav and vice-captain Shubman Gill and spills over to some incomprehensible strategies and selections.Saturday was more about going back to basics. When Washington Sundar was padding up at the top of the nets session, Hardik Pandya approached him and cautioned him: “This is a pitch where you have to be gutsy.” The pitch here has historically provided big scores. But one can never discount the amount of movement and bounce the venue offers to the bowlers.The focus of the nets sessions was on polishing every batter’s technique. Once Sanju Samson and Washington Sundar were done with their batting in the nets, Surya and Gill hogged the attention for the rest of the evening. They hopped all four nets. Surya, in fact, batted for well over 90 minutes—that’s how long an entire team’s T20 innings lasts. They went through drills that are seen more in academies where one works on the nuances of a solid technique. Gill and Jitesh only joined Pandya for a range-hitting session under lights at the centre square after a thorough session of old-school batting in the nets.Surya, for one, eschewed his trademark pick-up ramps and swipes behind square on the on-side against the pacers. The vertical bat and a compact defence were the order of the day. He did get into a phase where he dealt in sweeping and lapping the spinners. As he started to get beaten frequently, he switched to playing down the ground and practicing the inside-out shots over cover.Surya is the designated No. 3 in this batting lineup. But Axar Patel coming out to bat at No. 3 in the second over in the previous match must hurt the egos of the frontline batters. Tilak Verma expectedly put it down to the team’s much-hyped flexibility. “I have told the team that I can bat in any situation. But we want to be flexible. Axar has done a good job for the team in the T20 World Cup. So, one has to be ready for whatever the team needs. But I don’t mind doing that job,” Verma said on Saturday.Playing the moving new ball has been a major problem. Gill just stuck to punching the ball off the back foot. His frailties against the new ball pitching on a good length are well documented. The deliveries outside off have begun to catch the outside edge more often. Thus, one saw him working overtime on backfoot punches squarer of the wicket and uppercuts to make use of the field in the powerplay. As Surya retired to the dressing room, Gill hung back for a long and intense chat with Gambhir and assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate. For one who is obsessed about his batting, Gill must be aware there isn’t much time for him to iron out the chinks in his batting before the T20 World Cup comes calling in Feb-March.As India grapple to find their absolute T20 game, South Africa seemed to be more in control of where the team is placed right now. “It might look as if we are slightly unsure given the amount of changes we make every match. But it’s certainly not for the sake of making changes. We have a pretty good idea of what our World Cup squad will be like. It’s really about just managing players. There are a few guys that have been here since the test series and then we’ve also got SA20 after this,” South Africa coach Shukri Conrad said.With this third T20I, one expects the Indian team to take a fresh guard and re-organise their T20 setup as they approach the final phase of preparation for defending their T20 World Cup title.",South africa’s all-format tour of india is in its last week. The visitors have managed to bare open india's deficiencies in more ways than one would have expected.

Usually on match eves, Jasprit Bumrah prefers to go through the paces. More often than not, he is one of the seniors in the team who chooses to skip these optional sessions. On Saturday evening, though, he turned up at the HPCA stadium, set up his own practice nets on the centre square and went through a rigorous session of bowling, focusing much on getting the yorker right.He didn’t bowl to any of the batters. It was just Bumrah, a camera stationed right next to where an umpire would be standing, a pair of boots and cones on either side of the crease at the other end, stumps and bowling coach Morne Morkel . For a good 45 minutes, he went full throttle. It was a solo act—one which will be a masterclass in perfecting yorkers. These drills are usually carried out when one starts out bowling yorkers. In essence, he has gone back to the drawing board.Right from the time he burst on to the scene, Bumrah and toe-crushing yorkers became synonymous. Over a period of time, he has mastered the all-round art of fast bowling so well that he has always been in control of proceedings. Hence, unnerving Bumrah is one of the toughest jobs for opposing teams. Yet, he has managed to identify what has been lacking in bowling.In the second T20I against South Africa in New Chandigarh, Bumrah failed to execute his yorkers. Interestingly, since he resumed his T20I duties in the Asia Cup in Sept after a gap of 14 months, he hasn’t looked incisive enough. In 12 preceding matches, his economy rate has been under control. He conceded over 11 runs per over twice and only once his economy rate has gone beyond seven. What would be a tad disconcerting is the fact that he has managed to take just 12 oversIt also could be that the opponents have decided to play Bumrah out more cautiously, preserving wickets to target the other bowlers.“I think on a night when he’s off, you've got to take what you can get because I don't know when you're going to get it again. We don’t plan too much around the matchups. Whatever it allows us on the night. If the batters are in, we obviously want to take on the aggressive options,” South Africa coach Shukri Conrad replied to a query on how they prepare for Bumrah.“I’m sure he’ll be back to his best again tomorrow night or maybe later in the series we hope. You have to factor in the conditions. Maybe the ball was a little bit wet side,” he added, choosing his words very carefully, probably not wanting to poke the bear.Bumrah, by his own lofty standards, would know he hasn’t been able to make an impact as consistently as he was used to. Conditions or not, the assault carried out on him by the South African batters two days ago must have stirred him up.","In the second t20i against south africa in new chandigarh, jasprit bumrah failed to execute his yorkers.

Former India cricketer Manoj Tiwari launched a scathing attack on the organisers and authorities after chaos marred Lionel Messi’s much-hyped appearance at Salt Lake Stadium on Saturday, saying a global icon like the Argentine superstar “deserved better”.“I am speechless of what happened today in my city! This is shambolic! Me, being an international sportsperson can feel how embarrassing it was for Messi today. We all love him and the craze was well anticipated! Organizer Satadru has already been arrested and I thank the police department for the prompt action. The way Satadru played with the hard-earned money and emotion of the football-loving people of Bengal today at the Salt Lake Stadium, deserves an alarming punishment. .. Another case of False promise and complete mismanagement by Satadru! Thankfully I was not present today... I always had doubt if he had the credibility of pulling off an event like this in Kolkata. A legend like Leo Messi deserved better. I am sure the Government will take strict action against Satadru and management.. Kolkata didn't deserve this!” Tiwari wrote on X.Messi’s much-anticipated visit lasted just 22 minutes, enough to turn what was billed as a historic celebration into a spectacle of mismanagement.More than 50,000 fans, many of whom paid between Rs 4,000 and Rs 12,000, and even higher in the black market, were left frustrated after failing to get a clear glimpse of the World Cup winner.The situation deteriorated rapidly as Messi was surrounded by politicians, VVIPs and security personnel, effectively blocking the view of the paying public.Despite repeated appeals from promoter Satadru Dutta over the public address system to clear the ground, the crowding worsened, forcing Messi’s early exit.Angry fans reacted by throwing bottles and chairs, vandalising canopies and damaging stadium property, prompting police intervention.The unrest lasted over an hour, though police largely showed restraint to prevent a stampede.Messi’s second visit to Kolkata, part of his India tour, was meant to inspire football lovers. Instead, it exposed glaring gaps in planning and crowd control, leaving behind disappointment, damage and serious questions about governance and accountability.","Messi’s second visit to kolkata, part of his india tour, was meant to inspire football lovers.
