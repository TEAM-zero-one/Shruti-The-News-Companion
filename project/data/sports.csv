Why India need leader Shreyas Iyer for 2027 World Cup | Greenstone Lobo prediction

NEW DELHI: KL Rahul played a pivotal role in India’s tense run chase against New Zealand in the first ODI, but the challenge he faced went beyond the numbers on the scoreboard. Washington Sundar , who was struggling with a back issue picked up during his bowling spell, found himself unable to run effectively when it was his turn to bat. Rahul revealed the difficulty of managing the innings under these circumstances after the match.“I didn’t know Washi couldn’t run,” KL Rahul said after the match.That admission puts India’s chase into perspective. In tight ODI finishes, running between the wickets is often just as crucial as hitting boundaries. With Sundar’s mobility restricted, Rahul had to reassess how the team approached each scoring opportunity, balancing aggression with caution.“He played some excellent shots. We made sure not to let too many dot balls accumulate.”Rahul’s role expanded from just scoring runs to actively managing the tempo. He had to rotate strike, make calculated singles, and prevent the pressure from building — all while maintaining focus on the target.“We were not up against a very tall target; at this level, you’re generally expected to chase down 6 or 6.5 runs per over in 9 out of 10 instances.”Rahul also emphasised the importance of early partnerships and understanding the pitch conditions. “The pitch remained consistent for the full 100 overs; the new ball is the optimal time to bat. The partnerships developed by Rohit, Gill, and Virat found the precise tempo. It tended to become slower as the innings progressed…”Acknowledging New Zealand’s knack for prolonging matches, Rahul remained composed under pressure. “We have faced a multitude of last-over finishes against New Zealand; they are adept at finding ways to claw their way back into the match. I look forward eagerly to the upcoming games.”Through it all, Rahul’s composure and strategic management of the innings underscored his influence — proving that in such high-pressure chases, leadership at the crease can be just as important as the runs scored.","Kl rahul played a pivotal role in india’s tense run chase against new zealand in the first odi.

The NBA trade deadline is getting closer, and the Los Angeles Lakers are once again part of serious trade talk. One proposal making the rounds involves a deal with the Sacramento Kings that would change the look of both teams without touching their main stars.The Lakers have been inconsistent this season, especially when the bench is on the floor. Scoring drops, spacing tightens, and defensive pressure fades. That has pushed the front office to look for rotation help that can contribute right away while still fitting around LeBron James and Luka Dončić.The proposed deal sends Malik Monk, Keon Ellis, and Devin Carter to the Los Angeles Lakers. In return, the Sacramento Kings would receive Dalton Knecht, Gabe Vincent, and Maxi Kleber.From a money standpoint, the deal works. Monk’s $18 million salary is balanced by Vincent and Kleber, while Knecht’s rookie contract helps fill the gap. No draft picks are included, which keeps the move simple and realistic before the deadline.Malik Monk gives the Los Angeles Lakers something they lack: reliable bench scoring. He can handle the ball, create shots late in the clock, and run offense when the starters sit.He has already shown he can thrive in a sixth-man role.Ellis adds perimeter defense and shooting. He guards well, stays disciplined, and knocks down open threes at a high rate. Carter, while still developing, brings athleticism and defensive effort that fits a team needing younger legs.Knecht and Vincent have struggled to earn steady minutes, and Kleber’s injuries have limited his impact. From the Lakers’ side, this is a rotation upgrade without sacrificing core pieces.Sacramento Kings’ backcourt is crowded. With De’Aaron Fox and DeMar DeRozan leading the offense, Monk, Ellis, and Carter often compete for limited minutes.Dalton Knecht offers scoring potential on the wing and is still on a rookie deal. Vincent provides experienced guard depth, and Kleber adds size and floor spacing in the frontcourt. The move also gives the Kings more flexibility moving forward without fully stepping away from the season.The Lakers clearly gain more in the short term. Monk and Ellis immediately raise the level of the rotation and address clear weaknesses. Sacramento gets useful pieces and flexibility but gives up players who already contribute.Also read: NBA trade rumors: Toronto Raptors predicted to pursue $197,230,450 Memphis Grizzlies Champion to fill roster void and improve title odds If this deal happens, it won’t grab headlines like a superstar trade, but it could matter when games slow down and benches decide outcomes in the playoffs.","The nba trade deadline is getting closer, and the los angeles lakers are once again part of serious trade talk.

How Evgeni Malkin’s contracts, achievements, and salary shaped his net worth after 2016

Celebrating Evgeni Malkin’s Journey to 1,000 Games

What achievements and off-ice income added to Malkin’s wealth?



Evgeni Malkin’s financial history in the past ten years is a kind of mirror that reflects how elite NHL stars have not only been able to add even more to their earnings by their performance but also to prolong their careers in terms of earning power, which is well beyond the traditional career curves. Starting from 2016, Malkin became the center of the Pittsburgh Penguins team and remained a highly valued asset of the franchise, which secured his long-term contract together with consistent production.Malkin's career took a major turn in this period that coincided with a change in the whole league where age was no longer considered a financial cutoff. The saying that ""2026 is the new 2016"" is a reflection of the fact that some veteran stars are still very much in their prime and hence able to command high salaries and play a prominent role in the game even after ten years, just like Malkin.As per Celebrity Net Worth, as of the year 2024, the net worth of Evgeni Malkin is believed to be around $60 million, whereas, at the end of the 2025-26 season, Spotrac will consider his overall NHL career earnings to be more than $151 million. Starting from 2016, Malkin's sports career was entirely connected to the Pittsburgh Penguins, thus securing both the team's financial stability and the value of the franchise during the final period of his career.Malkin's contract extended from 2016 to 2022, which was the second half of an eight-year, $76 million contract. He was earning a salary of $9.5 million per year until the 2021-22 season. This period marked some of the most important successes of his late career, including getting the Stanley Cup twice in a row and being the main player of Pittsburgh's dominance for the whole period. Not only did the winning seasons elevate his status, but they also made sure that he would receive the highest salary till his 30s and beyond.Malkin officially extended his contract with the Penguins for four years and $24.4 million, which was published by NHL.com in July 2022; thus, the extension had an average annual value of $6.1 million for the whole period up to the 2025–26 season. The annual payment was gradually reduced—from $8 million in 2022-23 to $4.8 million in 2025–26. This part of the contract coincides perfectly with a larger trend in the NHL, often referred to as ""2026 is the new 2016"", where aging superstars are still able to keep their value longer because of good training, flexible roles, and wisdom.Despite contracts, Malkin kept reaching important milestones after 2016, i.e., his 1,000th NHL point, his 1,000th NHL game in 2022, and his 500th career goal in 2024, all the while being an alternate captain in Pittsburgh.Malkin's partnership with GoPro, Upper Deck, Framework, and Mogosport, as well as investments such as the e-sports organization Pittsburgh Knights, not only supplemented his NHL salary but also transformed his career into a long-term financial growth plan.During the period of 2016-2026, Evgeni Malkin transformed elite performance into durable financial strength, therefore mirroring both longevity and the changing trends in the NHL throughout the decade of consistency turned into a net worth.Also Read: Detroit Red Wings retire Sergei Fedorov’s iconic No. 91 jersey, closing a long‑awaited chapter","Evgeni malkin's career took a major turn in this period that coincided with a change in the whole league where age was no longer considered a financial cutoff.

Why did NBA fine Jaylen Brown? Celtics star hit with a $35K penalty,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/why-did-nba-fine-jaylen-brown-celtics-star-hit-with-a-35k-penalty/articleshow/126494852.cms,"Jaylen Brown. Image via: Brian Fluharty-Imagn Images

The NBA fined Jaylen Brown after public criticism of officiating



The NBA fined Jaylen Brown amid free-throw disparity concerns



Jaylen Brown stepped in front of reporters after Boston’s narrow loss to San Antonio on Saturday, and the outcome was not so smooth. The Celtics had dropped a 100-95 game at TD Garden, and the frustration lingered even after the final buzzer.Boston attempted only four free throws as a team. San Antonio took 20. Brown scored 27 points, grabbed eight rebounds, and dished out seven assists, yet never reached the line. His reaction became the center of attention across the league, and by Monday afternoon, the NBA delivered its response with a $35,000 fine.The league fined Jaylen Brown for comments made to reporters and on social media that directly criticized game officials. The NBA cited public criticism of officiating as the reason for the penalty. Brown acknowledged the risk in real time and made it clear he accepted the consequence.“I'll accept the fine at this point,” saying that the officiating was not good enough. “I think they're a good defensive team, but they ain't that damn good. I hope somebody can just pull up the clips, because it's the same (things) every time we play a good team.It's, like, they refuse to make a call, then they call touch fouls on the other end, and that's just extremely frustrating, bro.”Brown continued speaking at length, calling out what he described as repeated inconsistency. He even mentioned an official by name, which all but guaranteed league action. The NBA responded swiftly, issuing the fine before Boston’s next game.The numbers from Saturday night added context to Brown’s anger. Boston entered the game already ranking last in the league in free-throw attempts compared to opponents. Against San Antonio, the gap widened again. The Celtics committed 18 fouls, while the Spurs were whistled for 13, yet most of Boston’s fouls resulted in trips to the line.Brown, who committed four fouls himself, focused on the physical nature of the game and how contact was judged on each end of the floor.“We play hard. We are outplaying our expectations, we compete hard on the defensive end and they reward the other team with touch fouls and we go down there and guys are allowed to get away with — somebody please pull it up,” Brown said. “Every time we play a good team the inconsistency is crazy. I'll take the fine. Curtis, all them dudes, was terrible tonight. I don't care, they can fine me whatever they want.”Brown later doubled down online, writing, “I’m irate at how they officiated the game today,” while again pointing to the four free throw attempts in a four-point loss.Despite the fine, Brown’s on-court production has been standout. He is averaging a career-high 29.5 points while leading a Celtics team sitting at 24-14.Also Read: Jordyn Woods dazzles in winterwear trapper hat as Karl-Anthony Towns’ fiancée shares stunning photos","The nba fined jaylen brown $35,000 for public criticism of officiating.

“She'll choose…”: Aaron Rodgers opens up about consulting wife Brittani amid growing NFL retirement speculation,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/shell-choose-aaron-rodgers-opens-up-about-consulting-wife-brittani-amid-growing-nfl-retirement-speculation/articleshow/126485584.cms,"Aaron Rodgers sparked fresh retirement speculation after referencing his wife, Brittani, while discussing his NFL future. Playing on a one-year deal with the Pittsburgh Steelers, Rodgers said he would consult her before making any decision. The rare comment offered insight into his private marriage and family-first mindset.

Aaron Rodgers linked retirement talks to his private marriage

As the 2025 NFL season drew to a tense close, Aaron Rodgers found himself at the center of two conversations that refused to stay separate. One involved football, legacy, and the possibility of retirement. The other was far more personal. In a rare moment of openness, Rodgers referenced his wife, Brittani, offering fans an unexpected glimpse into a relationship he has deliberately kept away from public view.At the time, Rodgers was navigating uncertainty with the Pittsburgh Steelers, playing on a one-year deal with questions swirling about whether a Week 18 loss could mark the end of his NFL career. Amid that tension, a single comment shifted attention away from stats and contracts and toward the quieter forces shaping his decisions.While speaking to the media ahead of the Steelers’ matchup against the Ravens, Rodgers acknowledged that any decision about retirement would not be made alone. According to Daily Mail, he referenced his wife, Brittani, a figure who remains largely unknown even to those close to him.“I don't really want to get too deep into it, you know? Obviously, I'll talk to my wife and then, you know, hopefully that's a decision down the line, but I'm not really going to talk about anything.”The comment resonated because of its restraint. Rodgers did not frame Brittani as a public presence or a storyline. He framed her as a partner. The moment reinforced what he has consistently said about keeping his personal life protected after years of intense scrutiny during past high-profile relationships.Rodgers later explained that Brittani values privacy and never sought the spotlight. He confirmed in mid-2025 that they had married quietly months earlier and reiterated that she would only be seen publicly if she chose to be. Speaking on The Pat McAfee Show, he said, “If and when she [Brittani] wants to be out and there's a picture, she'll choose that.”Looking back, the moment stands as a reminder that even one of football’s most analyzed figures makes his biggest decisions off the field, guided by someone the world has never truly seen.Also Read: Aaron Rodgers’ wife mystery deepens as Brittani misses another Steelers WAG event","Aaron rodgers sparked fresh retirement speculation after referencing his wife, brittani, while discussing his nfl future.

Theface theon January 12, 2026, in the second game of a back-to-back. Both teams are close in the Eastern Conference standings, and availability will play a major role in how this game unfolds.Their last meeting went to overtime and exposed how thin both rotations can look when starters are missing. This rematch moves to Toronto, where lineup decisions could again decide the outcome more than tactics.Joel Embiid is questionable due to left knee management and groin discomfort. He sat out the previous game, and if he misses this one as well, Philadelphia 76ers will lean more on Adem Bona and Andre Drummond in the middle.Paul George is also listed as questionable with left knee soreness. His late absence in the last game hurt Philadelphia’s spacing and secondary scoring. If George does not play, the Sixers’ offense will run almost entirely through Tyrese Maxey.Toronto Raptors have already ruled out RJ Barrett and Ja’Kobe Walter due to ankle injuries, along with Jakob Poeltl because of a back issue. Brandon Ingram is questionable with a thumb injury, while Scottie Barnes is dealing with a right knee sprain and is also questionable.If Barnes and Ingram are available, Toronto will have a clear advantage in size, playmaking, and defensive flexibility. If either sits, the Raptors’ scoring balance becomes harder to maintain.Maxey remains Philadelphia 76ers’ primary option, while Toronto Raptors rely on contributions from Barnes, Ingram, and Immanuel Quickley.The game will air on NBA TV, NBC Sports Philadelphia, and TSN Sports in Canada.

When is Nikola Jokic returning?

The Milwaukee Bucks faced the Denver Nuggets on January 11, 2026. Even without their star player, Nikola Jokic, the team managed to rack up a 4-point lead. Jokic has been missing the last few games owing to his left knee injury. His absence has raised the debate over his eligibility for the postseason awards and accolades this year, as the minimum eligibility criteria is 65 games. On average, each team plays 82 games.Before the Bucks vs. the Nuggets game, NBA star Giannis Antetokounmpo was asked to address the 65-game rule. The power forward gave a rather honest reply about how hard it is to reach the threshold of 64 games. According to the athlete, the margin of error is really less. One serious injury might lead to a season-long ejection.As the Milwaukee Bucks prepared to face the Denver Nuggets, Giannis Antetokounmpo was asked about his opinion on the 65-game rule. He replied, “I will be honest with you. Like 13 years of me being in the league, I think I have played 65 games every year. I am still on track. I think I am gonna still play 65 games.” While being confident about his roadmap this season, the athlete reveals the hardships behind the rule.He continued, “It's hard. If you want to be a really good player, help your team get deep in the playoffs and then come back at it and then again play 65 games, you do it for a couple of years. Because I have been All-NBA for 9 years in a row. 7 times first team and putting a rule in there does give a break.”Giannis further added, “The margin of error is hard. Like, you get one injury and you are off the race.” The athlete believed that while he was determined to complete 65 games, he might not make it in the end. He mentioned a few other players, including Victor Wembanyama, who might not qualify for the postseason awards due to the rule. While initially, the Bucks' power forward was all for it at a younger age, he is not that supportive of the rule now that he is growing older. In the end, Giannis, however, acknowledged the importance of these rules and why they should exist.Nikola Jokic has been left with a left knee hyperextension. Owing to this injury, the player will be away for 4 weeks. The athlete suffered the injury in a game against the Miami Heat team when Spencer Jones stepped on him accidentally.

Who is Rick Bowness, the new Columbus Blue Jackets head coach?



Rick Bowness set to start his tenure at Columbus at a moment when urgency has replaced patience inside the Blue Jackets organization. The season has slipped away faster than anyone in the front office expected. Columbus sits at the bottom of the Metropolitan Division, leaking goals and confidence with equal speed. What makes the move sting more is the contrast to last year, when optimism returned and playoff hopes lasted deep into spring. This time, results fell short of internal standards, forcing management to act before the standings became impossible to climb.With 37 games still on the schedule, the Blue Jackets chose experience over experimentation. Dean Evason and assistant Steve McCarthy were relieved of their duties, and the franchise turned to a familiar NHL name to steady a drifting ship. The decision signals a belief that the roster is not broken beyond repair, but rather in need of structure, accountability, and calm leadership during a turbulent stretch.Rick Bowness arrives in Columbus with nearly four decades of professional hockey behind him and a reputation built on resilience.At 70, he is one of the rare coaches whose career spans five different NHL decades, a testament to adaptability. Bowness was head coach of the Jets in 1988-89. He also coached the Boston Bruins (1991-92), Ottawa Senators (1992-96), New York Islanders (1996-98), Phoenix Coyotes (2003-04), Dallas Stars (2019-21), and Jets (2022-24).As an assistant in Vancouver, Tampa Bay, and Dallas, Bowness became trusted for his defensive structure and steady presence. That trust paid off in Dallas, where he took over midseason and guided the Stars to the Stanley Cup Final in 2020. Even in defeat, his leadership earned respect across the league.His most recent stop in Winnipeg shows his ceiling. In the 2023-24 season, the Jets posted a 52-win campaign, the strongest record of his head coaching career. That run reaffirmed his ability to connect with modern players while demanding discipline in all three zones. He went 310-408 with 48 overtime/shootout losses and 37 ties as a head coach.For Columbus, Bowness brings clarity more than promises. His career record reflects hardship as much as success, but it also reflects survival in one of sports’ most unforgiving environments. The Blue Jackets are betting that his experience, voice, and calm authority can halt the slide and reset standards before the season slips beyond reach.Also Read: NHL insider explains how a shifting buyer-seller market impacts Sidney Crosby and Erik Karlsson’s future","Rick bowness is the new head coach of the columbus blue jackets.

Erin Andrews’ sideline outfit turns a Wild Card game into a fashion moment

Internet jokes follow Erin Andrews while she keeps the broadcast on track

Erin Andrews did not throw a pass, catch a touchdown, or call a play on Jan. 11. She still became one of the most talked-about figures of the NFL postseason.During the NFC Wild Card game between the San Francisco 49ers and Philadelphia Eagles at Lincoln Financial Field, the Fox Sports sideline reporter shifted attention away from the field with a bold wardrobe choice that quickly took over social media.Andrews appeared on the Fox broadcast wearing an oversized black-and-ivory faux fur coat while reporting from the sidelines in Philadelphia. Game-time temperatures sat in the 30s with heavy wind, making outerwear a necessity. The coat still stood out the moment she went live.Within minutes, screenshots flooded X. Fans labeled it “outfit of the year” and turned the look into a running joke across the NFL internet. The coat’s sharp contrast and exaggerated collar drew instant comparisons to Cruella de Vil from 101 Dalmatians.One fan wrote, “Erin Andrews woke this morning and said ‘Imma slay bi**hes y’all!’” Another added, “Philadelphia, hide your puppies! Erin Andrews is in town.”The reaction did not stay online. Fox analyst Michael Strahan and members of the broadcast repeatedly referenced the coat on air. Andrews brushed it off each time and stayed focused on her reporting.According to Fox Sports and multiple fashion outlets, the coat is Auter’s “THE FOX JACKET” in Smoke Noir. It retails for roughly $950 and features a sculpted oversized collar designed for warmth and mobility. Auter describes the piece as a refined statement in faux fur with a bold black-and-smoke palette.The design worked on television. It also worked as insulation in freezing conditions. That combination fueled the reaction.The comparisons escalated as the night went on. Fans likened Andrews to Cruella de Vil, Ric Flair, an emu, and even mafia movie extras. One joked, “Erin Andrews took out the entire polar bear exhibit at the Philadelphia Zoo to make this coat.” Merriam-Webster joined the moment with, “Fun fact: a group of emus is called a ‘mob.’”Not all reactions were positive. Some viewers argued the look distracted from the game. Others questioned whether sideline reporters should draw attention with fashion during playoff broadcasts.Veteran media writer Richard Deitsch addressed that debate directly, writing, “The position is valuable is my point. How you feel about specific reporters will always be subjective. Personally, I don’t care what anyone wears. Just ask good Qs, don’t be a league propagandist, and get info.”That is exactly what Andrews did. Despite the noise, she delivered key updates throughout the game. Most notably, she confirmed the Achilles injury suffered by 49ers tight end George Kittle, an injury that ended his season and placed his next year in question.Earlier that day, Andrews also drew attention for her pregame interview outfit while speaking with Christian McCaffrey. That look sparked its own split reaction online. Praise and criticism arrived in equal measure.The moment underscored a familiar reality in sports media. A woman can report accurately, break news, and still have her appearance dominate the conversation.By the end of the night, Andrews’ coat became a viral subplot to a playoff game that already carried high stakes. The Eagles led 13-10 at halftime. Injuries mounted for San Francisco. The Fox broadcast rolled on with Kevin Burkhardt, Tom Brady, Tom Rinaldi, and Andrews handling their roles.The coat did not change the outcome of the game. It did something else. It reminded everyone how fast attention moves and how easily it shifts. Andrews stayed steady while the internet ran wild. That part mattered more than the memes.",Erin andrews wore an oversized faux fur coat while reporting from the sidelines in philadelphia.

Brian Ortega and Mackenzie Dern shocked many viewers when they appeared at the 83rd Golden Globe Awards on Sunday night, January 11, 2026, in Beverly Hills, California. The show aired live on CBS from the Beverly Hilton. Instead of actors, two UFC stars walked into one of Hollywood’s biggest nights.Their quick on-stage moment was used to promote the UFC’s new seven-year deal with Paramount, which now owns the U.S. broadcast rights. The surprise appearance showed how far mixed martial arts has come, as UFC fighters were placed right in the middle of a major entertainment awards show.Brian Ortega and Mackenzie Dern appeared during a short segment in the live broadcast. They were dressed as security guards while escorting TV actors Connor Storrie and Hudson Williams onto the stage.An announcer joked that the stars needed “extra security,” before revealing the two UFC fighters. The moment lasted less than a minute, but it quickly caught attention online.MMA and Hollywood aficionados posted clips on social media. Many viewers were astounded to find UFC competitors highlighted at an awards show honoring cinema and television.The segment also quietly pushed the UFC’s new media deal. In 2025, UFC president Dana White signed a $7.7 billion agreement with Paramount, making it the new home of UFC broadcasts in the United States.The appearance also carried history behind it. At the 2017 Golden Globes, actress Meryl Streep once said that if outsiders were pushed out of America, viewers would be left with “football and mixed martial arts, which are not the arts.”Nearly ten years later, UFC fighters were featured at the same event. Dana White had strongly criticized that comment at the time.While neither White nor Streep spoke publicly about Sunday’s moment, many fans saw the segment as a sign of how much MMA has grown.Before the show, both fighters walked the red carpet. Mackenzie Dern, the current UFC women’s strawweight champion, wore a strapless purple dress and smiled for cameras.Brian Ortega, a top featherweight contender, wore a black suit with a bow tie. They posed with celebrities, spoke briefly with reporters, and later shared photos from the night.Their presence showed that UFC fighters are now part of mainstream entertainment spaces once closed to combat sports.Also Read: Sam Kerr And Kristie Mewis Combined Net Worth: Inside The Football Stars’ Earnings, Contracts, Endorsements, And Life Together","Brian ortega and mackenzie dern appeared during a short segment in the live broadcast.

Rory McIlroy calls for unity as the PGA Tour reviews Brooks Koepka’s case

Rory McIlroy, a four-time major champion and an influential voice in modern golf, has once again brought to the forefront of discussions again, on the PGA Tour his support for Brooks Koepka, a five-time major champion. Brooks's recent decision to reapply for PGA Tour membership after leaving the LIV Golf Tour has resulted in many sensitive issues regarding loyalty, fairness, and consequences within professional golf being raised.Michael has stated that players who have stayed committed to the PGA Tour feel uneasy about Brooks Koepka, the major champion, being able to return without facing any consequences. He stated that there are players who believe that Brooks benefited monetarily by leaving LIV, and they are now able to return (to the Tour) without being held accountable for their actions.Michael Kim further stated that among the many players who have felt frustration associated with comparing themselves with Brooks Koepka, some turned down LIV offers and instead stayed loyal to the PGA Tour. For these players, seeing Brooks Koepka welcomed back so easily places doubt in their minds as to whether their decision was worthwhile or valid.Michael Kim also mentioned that there are concerns regarding the consistency of disciplinary actions that have been imposed upon players who have limited associations with LIV, and that if there is a lenient path for Brooks Koepka, then there is a serious question as to what is perceived as fairness.Rory McIlroy has attempted to be conciliatory in his comments about Brooks Koepka, suggesting that bringing Brooks back into the fold of professional golf may help reunite the fractured elite professional game. Rory believes that the quality of competition and a common goal are more important today than inflicting the consequence of punishment.The PGA Tour is now in the process of conducting a formal review of Brooks Koepka’s application with the assistance of PGA Tour Player Leadership and a committee led by Tiger Woods . As the debate over Brooks Koepka continues, the Tour will have to be cautious about how it balances unity, loyalty, and accountability in the future.Also Read: Tiger Woods grouped with Brooks Koepka, Rory McIlroy for return at Memorial",Pga tour faces fresh tension as rory mcilroy backs brooks koepka’s comeback.

DK Metcalf ’s return gives Steelers offense much-needed edge against Texans' defense



The Pittsburgh Steelers head into the postseason with little margin for error and even less room for offensive inconsistency. After stumbling through stretches of the regular season, Pittsburgh survived just long enough to secure a Wild Card spot, helped by a missed kick elsewhere in the AFC. Now, the challenge shifts to Monday night against a disciplined, aggressive Houston Texans defense.For a team that struggled to generate explosive plays late in the year, the timing could not be better. Pittsburgh will have its most dynamic offensive weapon back on the field, a development that immediately changes the texture of this matchup and gives the Steelers a fighting chance in a game that demands precision.DK Metcalf is set to return for the Steelers after serving a two-game suspension that sidelined him at the worst possible moment. The suspension, stemming from an incident in Detroit, carried him through Week 18, making him eligible just in time for the playoffs. He practiced fully throughout the week and is expected to resume his role as Pittsburgh’s top wide receiver without restriction.That matters more than any schematic tweak. Without Metcalf, the Steelers’ passing game lacked a clear focal point. Targets were spread around, production fluctuated, and defenses rarely felt pressured vertically.Houston, in particular, thrives on collapsing pockets and crowding short routes. Metcalf’s presence forces a different calculation.At full strength, Metcalf gives Pittsburgh a true WR1 who can win on the outside, stretch coverage, and create space underneath for the rest of the offense. His size-speed combination is difficult to replicate and even harder to neutralize over four quarters. Against a Texans defense that ranks among the league’s most physical units, that matchup could define the night.The Steelers also benefit from clarity. With Metcalf back at the top of the depth chart, everyone else can slide into more natural roles. Route trees simplify, timing improves, and the quarterback has a reliable option when pressure arrives. That stability has been missing.The stakes are straightforward. A win sends Pittsburgh on the road to face the New England Patriots in the Divisional Round, a scenario that would have felt unrealistic just weeks ago. But playoff football rarely rewards comfort. It rewards readiness. With DK Metcalf back in uniform, the Steelers finally look prepared to meet the moment.","Dk metcalf is set to return for the steelers after serving a two-game suspension.
