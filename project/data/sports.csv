Taylor Swift won't perform at the Super Bowl until Travis Kelce retires

Taylor Swift is considering performing a halftime show for the NFL after her boyfriend Travis Kelce retires, according to a report by the Daily Mail. Swift's decision was influenced by Pepsi's sponsorship and her long-standing partnership with Coca-Cola, as well as her longstanding relationship with the NFL's sponsor, Pepsi. However, it sounds like she’ll wait until his playing days are over before considering taking football’s biggest stage.Taylor Swift has decided not to headline the Super Bowl halftime show until her boyfriend, Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce, retires from football. Despite fans' desire for Swift to take center stage, she remains committed to supporting Kelce on the sidelines.Taylor Swift, who has been dating Kelce for two years, attended the Super Bowl and watched Kendrick Lamar's halftime performance, but is hesitant to accept the role while Kelce remains an active player.“She doesn’t want to do it now until Travis is fully retired as she would like to be at the game supporting him rather than performing at it,” the Daily Mail’s source said. “When she eventually performs at it, she wants all her loved ones to be able to experience it. And as long as Travis is in the league, the Chiefs have a chance to be in the game, so she is going to wait to do it till he is officially done.”Travis Kelce's NFL future remains uncertain after the Chiefs' Super Bowl LIX loss to the Philadelphia Eagles. Rumors about his retirement arose, and he said he would take time to decide on his New Heights podcast with his brother Jason Kelce.“I’m gonna take some time to figure it out,” Kelce said. “And I think I owe it to my teammates that if I do come back that it’s gonna be a wholehearted decision and I’m not half-assing it, and I’m fully here for them. I think I can play, it’s just whether or not I’m motivated or it’s the best decision for me as a man, as a human, as a person to take on all that responsibility.”Also Read: Travis Kelce is rumored to propose to Taylor Swift during their next upcoming romantic vacation Travis Kelce, a key player for the Kansas City offense, has seen a career-low 823 yards and three touchdowns this season.

have seemingly bounced back as they have secured a stunning win against theon Thursday night. At 40 years old, on the second night of a back-to-back, the four-time NBA champion, LeBron James delivered a jaw-dropping 40-point performance to lead the Los Angeles Lakers to a 121-112 win over the Portland Trail Blazers. His efforts left Lakers head coachboth stunned and inspired, as he showered James with praise following the game. LeBron James has recently dealt with lingering injuries and only confirmed fit to play hours before tipoff but showed no signs of slowing down. He shot an efficient 14-for-24 from the field, including 4-of-8 from beyond the arc, and added eight rebounds and four assists.Head coach JJ Redick , who has always been a vocal admirer of James’ work ethic and longevity, couldn’t hold back his admiration for the legend. Speaking to reporters in a post-game presser, he shared his honest thoughts on the King’s astonishing performance.“He really just defies anything that's normal, and not just the physical feats and the plays—it’s the mentality,” Redick said. “He is—I believe I saw the other day he's a billionaire—and he's playing on the second night of a back-to-back at 40 after 22 years with every record and every accolade.”Redick continued his witty remark, “And the kids will say that I'm glazing him. He's one of the greatest competitors. [Assistant coach] Nate [McMillan] and I were talking before the game—he's amazing to coach. He brings it every single day, he sets the standard for how you're supposed to approach this craft. That’s to me the most incredible thing—the mindset to do it, get up the next day, do it, over and over again.”James’ ability to maintain this level of excellence post-40 has been undeniably top of the word, according to fan analysts.

Nikola Vucevic (calf) is listed as probable, while Patrick Williams (knee) and Jalen Smith (face) are out. Josh Giddey (wrist) is probable, and Ayo Dosunmu (shoulder) is questionable.

Vucevic, averaging 19.2 points and 10.3 rebounds, will be a key player to watch if he’s cleared to play.For Phoenix, Kevin Durant’s availability is more than just a lineup decision—it’s a statement of intent.

NEW DELHI: India and Pakistan are set to clash in a high-stakes ICC Champions Trophy encounter on Sunday, with both teams chasing different objectives. India, buoyed by their six-wicket win over Bangladesh, look to secure a semifinal berth, while Pakistan, reeling from a 60-run defeat to New Zealand, must win to stay in contention.The two arch-rivals last met in a Champions Trophy match in 2017, when Pakistan triumphed in the final.Although diplomatic tensions have eased, muting the usual fervor, anticipation remains high for this Group A showdown at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium.India hold a clear advantage, having acclimatized to the conditions, while Pakistan arrive in Dubai straight after their loss to New Zealand in Karachi. With form and familiarity on their side, India head into Sunday’s clash with a psychological edge.The Champions Trophy clash between India and Pakistan at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium on February 23 is expected to proceed without any rain interruption, despite rainfall occurring in Dubai days before India's tournament opener.The forecast indicates partly cloudy conditions during afternoon hours, with temperatures ranging between 23 degrees Celsius at its lowest and reaching up to 31 degrees Celsius at its peak.31 DegreesMostly sunny and warm20 km/h5%32 DegreesMostly sunny and warm30 km/h23%26 DegreesPartly cloudy and warm24 km/h100%The playing surface at the Dubai International Stadium provides opportunities for both batting and bowling, with conditions that can fluctuate.

Whilst scoring opportunities exist, as evidenced by typical first innings totals, the venue does not consistently yield substantial scores.Spin bowling proves particularly crucial during the middle phase, as the surface tends to assist turn.

NEW DELHI: As the much-awaited India-Pakistan showdown in the ICC Champions Trophy approaches, former Indian cricketer Yuvraj Singh has backed Indian captain Rohit Sharma , calling him a ""dangerous"" player even when not in peak form.The arch-rivals will face off in Dubai on Sunday in a match that holds historical significance, with Pakistan leading 3-2 against India in Champions Trophy encounters.Speaking on JioHotstar’s 'Greatest Rivalry Returns', Yuvraj emphasised Rohit's ability to change the course of a game, irrespective of his form.“In ODIs and white-ball formats, he has been India’s biggest match-winner alongside Virat Kohli . If he is struggling but still gets runs, that is dangerous for the opposition. If he is in form, he will score a century in 60 balls. That is his quality — once he gets going, it’s not just about fours, but also clearing the ropes with sixes,” Yuvraj said.He also praised Rohit’s dominance against pace, particularly short-pitched bowling, which is often a concern for batters. “Even if someone bowls at 145-150 kmph, Rohit has the ability to hook it effortlessly. His strike rate is always between 120-140, and on his day, he can single-handedly win you the game,” he added.Rohit has a stellar record against Pakistan, scoring 873 runs in 19 ODIs at an average of 51.35, with two centuries and eight fifties. His highest score of 140 came in the 2019 World Cup.Pakistan, coming off a disappointing tournament opener against New Zealand, will be eager to repeat their 2017 Champions Trophy final triumph over India.However, with Rohit leading the charge, India, who beat Bangladesh in their opening game, will look to level the head-to-head record in the prestigious tournament.","Former indian cricketer yuvraj singh has backed indian captain rohit sharma.

After a defeat in the tournament opener, Pakistan's hopes of progressing in the Champions Trophy hinge heavily on their next group match against traditional rivals India in Dubai on Sunday, which former Pakistan cricketer Basit Ali views as heavily loaded in favour of India.New Zealand outclassed defending champions and hosts Pakistan by 60 runs in the first match of the tournament at Karachi, while India beat Bangladesh by six wickets in Dubai.Talking about Pakistan's chances and their must-win situation, Basit said it will be a big upset if Pakistan get the better of India.""It is a 'final' for Pakistan,"" the former batter said on his YouTube channel. ""India are heavy favourites. If Pakistan win, it will be an upset in my view because Pakistan's cricket has gone down, hit a low.""Agar one-sided hota hai, toh ab TV bhi nahi tootenge kyuki Pakistan mei mehangai boht zyada hai. Ab zabaan se hi har cheez hogi (if Pakistan lose one-sided, now fans wont' break TV sets because of the country's economic situation; now there will be only voiced opinions).""The hosts suffered a blow after the defeat against the Kiwis, losing their attacking batter Fakhar Zaman to injury, which led to Imam-ul-Haq coming in as replacement""Who will bat at No. 3, nobody knows. They might ask Usman Khan to open with Imam and bring Babar (Azam) at No. 3. Something needs to be done,"" Basit added, talking about the team's dire state.Babar has been opening since the ODI tri-series at home ahead of the Champions Trophy and was criticised for his laborious 64 off 90 balls in the first match of the Champions Trophy despite a target of 321 to chase.""Fakhar Zaman is out. Now Pakistan's batting line-up from number one to five is similar and there is no scope to swap positions. It's true. If their car is running in third gear, then it will stay in third gear. It won't be able to switch to turbo, maybe in the last 5 or 10 overs, maybe,"" said Basit.India, meanwhile, put up an all-round show against Bangladesh to start their campaign on a rousing note, with Mohammed Shami shining with a five-wicket spell (5 for 53) and opener Shubman Gill scoring an unbeaten century (101*).Basit said India will continue to play normal cricket and take it like just another match, while the mentality in Pakistan is still to beat India at any cost.""Baaton ki cricket ab nahi hone chahiye, ab bat se, dimag se (Pakistan now need to make their bats talk, use their brain),"" he said.Captain Rohit Sharma, who scored a century during the ODI series at home against England to return to form, looked good in his 36-ball 41 against Bangladesh, while Virat Kohli had to struggle for his 22, which came off 38 balls.""Virat intezar karta hai Pakistan ke match ka (Virat waits for the match against Pakistan),"" said Basit, predicting that the batting legend may play a big knock in the pressure match.He concluded by criticising the Pakistan Cricket Board for the money it spent in refurbishing the three stadiums in Lahore, Karachi and Rawalpindi.He said the board should instead have applied its mind in building a team.""The amount of money they spent in building the stadiums, they could have built a good team in half that amount. But to build a team you need intelligence. What is your vision? What's your thinking? How do you view a player's talent and longevity? These things matter.""As things stand at the moment in Group A, New Zealand are on top with two points, with India at No.2 because the Kiwis have a better net run-rate (NRR) of +1.200 compared to India's +0.408.Bangladesh are ahead of bottom-placed Pakistan. Both the teams are without any points, while Bangladesh's NRR of -0.408 is better than Pakistan's -1.200.",Basit ali says it will be a big upset if pakistan get the better of india.

NEW DELHI: When former cricketer Atul Wassan announced that he wants Pakistan to defeat India in Sunday's Champions Trophy match in Dubai, it caught everyone off guard.Pakistan will take on fierce opponents India in the duel of the heavyweights in an attempt to maintain their championship defense. After losing to New Zealand by 60 runs in the opening match of the competition, Pakistan ended up in this situation.The Men in Green would require a lot of different combinations to work in their favor and sustain their campaign if they lose against India on Sunday. Wassan thinks that if Pakistan wins the crucial match, the competition will become much more thrilling.""I want Pakistan to win because it will be fun, tournament-wise. If you don't let Pakistan win, then what will you do? If Pakistan wins, then it becomes a contest. There should be an equal fight,"" Wassan told ANI.Wassan praised India's batting depth in the starting line-up while analyzing their team for the current Champions Trophy. He believed that India was the greatest squad and supported their plan to launch a spin-heavy attack in Dubai given the circumstances.""You have a lot of good batters: Shubman (Gill), Rohit (Sharma), Virat (Kohli). You are batting until number eight in Axar Patel. Rohit has picked five spinners, and this team is best for Dubai. Have faith in what you have and move ahead,"" he added.India glided to a facile six-wicket victory against Bangladesh to open their account, while Pakistan started the campaign on a losing note.However, Wassan voiced his displeasure at Rishabh Pant 's exclusion from India's starting XI in favor of KL Rahul . Wassan believes that Pant makes the opposition uneasy, something Rahul cannot do.Head coach Gautam Gambhir 's preference for Rahul over Pant did not impress Wassan. He claims that the ""mercurial"" player has been let down by the Indian management, which could have long-term consequences for him.""Gautam Gambhir is picking his own team. I am just very upset that Rishabh Pant is not playing. I don't know why. He's a mercurial player who makes the other team nervous. They feel that he will single-handedly win the match. KL Rahul is a very good player but does not attract such fear from the opposition. You let Rishabh Pant down.

Latif said that the criticism was justified and that Babar ought to have taken chances while he was at the crease.""I think Babar Azam is being rightly criticised. If the ball is not coming onto the bat then you should have a Plan B. If you keep racking up the dot balls then you add pressure onto the team. Babar should have taken more risks, I believe the opening ten overs were there to take risks, as they struggle to play freely against spin. People think Pakistan have been unpredictable but Babar's batting has become predictable,"" Latif told IANS.The former wicketkeeper-batter went on to say that Babar is no longer Pakistan's best chance, citing Virat Kohli as an example who gained international acclaim for his clutch scoring for India.""Bowlers always know what shot he will play against which ball. Babar used to be Pakistan's hope at one time but not anymore as there are other players who can do (better). If on a day when Virat Kohli does not perform then Shubman Gill will perform, if he does not then Rohit is there, you've got Shreyas Iyer Hardik Pandya and KL Rahul as well but Virat is a big game player, he played a crucial innings in the T20 World Cup final (2024) as well,"" he added.Latif stated that the Mohammad Rizwan-led team appears weaker against Rohit Sharma & Co. ahead of Sunday's crucial match between India and Pakistan in Dubai.""If we look at both teams then Pakistan's side looks weak. Even though India's record has been stronger against Pakistan but there used to be competition, the game used to go till the final overs. People think India's tournaments have usually been due to their batting but Pakistan's success has always been due to their bowling,"" he said.""This match is very important for Pakistan. I am not worried for just the Champions Trophy but for Pakistan cricket as well because a lot of things were said and written in the build-up to the tournament (regarding India's participation) but all of that was off the field now the cricket has started and Pakistan lost their opening game whereas India won theirs. In a tournament like CT, where every team is a top side, the margins of errors are less there. Pakistan had lost their opening game in 2017 as well.""Despite pace-spearhead Jasprit Bumrah 's absence, the seasoned hitter termed India's bowling arsenal better than Pakistan.""I believe India's bowling is currently better, I know Jasprit Bumrah is not here, but their spinners are dominating, and in conditions like Dubai, Pakistan will struggle to face their spin attack,"" Latif said.",Former pakistan batter rashid latif criticizes babar azam for tactics in champions trophy opener against new zealand.
