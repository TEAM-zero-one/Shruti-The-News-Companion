NEW DELHI: The Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) on Tuesday targeted Congress leader Rahul Gandhi after former Pakistani cricketer Shahid Afridi called the Congress scion a leader with a ""positive mindset"".Lamenting over the Indian cricket team's decision to skip the customary handshake with the Pakistani team during Sunday's Asia Cup clash, Afridi said: ""This is a despicable mindset, which will continue till the time he (PM Modi) is their head. There are also good ones like Rahul Gandhi with a positive mindset, who wants to cooperate with the World through dialogue. Isn't Israel enough that you're trying to become like Israel here?"".Reacting to Afridi's remark, Union minister Kiren Rijiju called Rahul Gandhi a ""darling of Pakistan,"" saying ""Pakistani people could even make Rahul Gandhi their leader"".""Rahul Gandhi has been the darling of Pakistan! Shahid Afridi and the Pakistani people could even make Rahul Gandhi their leader,"" Rijiju wrote on X.BJP's I-T department chief Amit Malviya also cornered Rahul Gandhi, saying: ""When enemies of Bharat start cheering for you, the people of India know exactly where your loyalties lie"".""Rabid Hindu-hater Shahid Afridi, who never misses a chance to spew venom against India and dream of Kashmir joining Pakistan, is suddenly all praise for Rahul Gandhi. Afridi says Rahul wants “dialogue” with Pakistan, while attacking PM Modi by comparing India’s policy on Pakistan to Israel’s actions in Gaza,"" Malviya wrote on X.He further wrote: ""Why is it that every India-hater finds a friend in Rahul Gandhi? When enemies of Bharat start cheering for you, the people of India know exactly where your loyalties lie.""Hitting back at Malviya, Congress's social media chairperson Supriya Shrinate posted a photo of Anurag Thakur with Shahid Afridi during an India-Pakistan match that took place in February this year.The controversy erupted after Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha and India skipper Suryakumar Yadav did not exchange the customary handshake during the toss at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium.The PCB alleged that Pycroft had specifically instructed Salman to avoid shaking hands with his Indian counterpart.The situation escalated after India’s seven-wicket win when Suryakumar shook hands only with teammate Shivam Dube and walked off without acknowledging the Pakistani players.The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) also filed a formal complaint with the International Cricket Council (ICC), accusing match referee Andy Pycroft of violating the ICC Code of Conduct and the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) Laws regarding the Spirit of Cricket.However, the International Cricket Council (ICC) formally turned down the Pakistan Cricket Board's (PCB) request to replace match referee Andy Pycroft during the ongoing Asia Cup.The PCB chairman Mohsin Naqvi threatened to withdraw from the remaining Asia Cup 2025 matches if match referee Andy Pycroft is not removed.A PCB source, however, told TOI that ""it is very unlikely that the PCB will pull out from the Asia Cup"".","Former pakistani cricketer shahid afridi called the congress scion a leader with a ""positive mindset"" union minister kiren rijiju called rahul gandhi a ""darling of pakistan"" i-t department chief amit malviya cornered rahul gandhi, saying: ""when enemies of bharat start cheering for you, the people of india know where your loyalties lie""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123922436,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-57768,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Travis Kelce faced another brutal loss as Taylor Swift deals with her security concerns



Taylor Swift has always been very concerned about her safety and has mostly missed away games of Travis Kelce’s Kansas City Chiefs due to security concerns. With yesterday’s match being the Chiefs’ first home game of the season, fans were expecting to catch a glimpse of Taylor Swift. But many were left disappointed but fans feel it is because of what might have happened to Charlie Kirk and the other gun violence incidents that happened over the last few days.According to FOX Sports, Taylor Swift did arrive at the Arrowhead Stadium to cheer on Travis Kelce but the billionaire pop star used a large movable wall to sneak into the stadium.Now, fans are very concerned about her safety. A fan by the username @wompingwillowx wrote, “anyone unable to tell this is for her safety is either really dense or mentally immature. she isn’t hiding behind a bullet proof barrier for an easter egg. like bffr. everything that happened last week, people are insane. she wanted to go watch her fiancé in peace and safety.”Another fan by the username @roadnoz wrote, “After what happened this week with all the shootings I’m sure their taking extreme measures for her safety.”A third fan by the username @yeswhaleswiftie posted, “Also not a single camera, at least from what I’ve been watching, has even TRIED to sneak a peak of her in that suite.Shows that this has been discussed by a lot of people and it’s probably for her safety.”·Another fan by the username @humcupcake wrote, “I hate to even bring this up, but do we think this could be about enhanced security due to everything that has been happening?”A fifth fan by the username @LilySunday noted, “It is to do with security. People have no idea the threats this woman receives. Dare say her security team have required this.”However, neither Taylor Swift nor Travis Kelce have addressed the billionaire pop star’s security concerns.Yesterday was not a good day for Travis Kelce, as his team ended up facing another brutal loss on the field against the Philadelphia Eagles; this being the second consecutive loss for the team after their first loss against the Los Angeles Chargers.With the season just beginning, it would be interesting to watch how the power couple tackle their security concerns, while also planning their high profile wedding. As per reports, there are speculations of the wedding happening next summer, but there has been no confirmation from the couple yet.

Where to watch and what’s at stake

Qatar prepares for the fourth round of the FIFA World Cup 2026 qualifiers, held by the Asian Football Confederation (AFC). The national team was third in the previous round and now moves into a centralized group with the other top sides finishing in the top four of earlier groups. These remaining games will be crucial to their quest for an automatic berth to the 2026 World Cup or a spot in the playoffs. From here on out, every point absolutely counts, and the pressure is beginning to pile.The next match for Qatar in the AFC fourth round of the World Cup qualifiers will be an away clash against Oman on Wednesday, October 8, 2025, at 11.00 AM Doha time. This game is the first of their fourth-round campaign and will be crucial for establishing an early tone in the group.After this, Qatar will be back home to host the United Arab Emirates on Tuesday, October 14, 2025, with the kick-off at 1:15 PM Doha time. Both these fixtures are part of Matchdays 1 and 3 of the AFC's fourth round, which takes place from October 8 to 14, 2025.

Handshake drama becomes ugly! India vs Pakistan Asia Cup 2025 in DANGER?

Will they? Won't they? The guesswork continued for the last few days as there was a lot of uncertainty regarding Pakistan's participation in the ongoing Asia Cup . To make matters worse, the side decided against boarding the team bus to the stadium for their match against UAE at the scheduled time and an eventful day of dialogue between Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), International Cricket Council (ICC) and Asian Cricket Council (ACC) meant the start of the match was delayed by an hour.But when the two captains finally lined-up for the toss, match referee Andy Pycroft - the hottest keyword in the last four days - was in position before the coin got a flip. A lot of drama, plenty of emails, phone calls, negotiations and allegations preceded Pakistan-UAE toss as Mohsin Naqvi-led PCB were adamant on getting Pycroft removed from the roster because of violation of code of conduct.In its first email written to the global cricket body on September 15, a day after the India-Pakistan game, the PCB mentioned an ""incident"" - read toss - where code of conduct wasn't followed. They questioned the role of match referee Pycroft as the two captains Suryakumar Yadav and Salman Agha didn't shake hands. ICC immediately agreed to look into the matter and after doing its due and thorough diligence, a response was sent to the PCB stating Pycroft performed his duty well and didn't violate any code of conduct.It was further communicated that he was following the instructions he got from the ACC, chaired by Naqvi, regarding no handshake at toss. The ICC further highlighted that Pycroft handled the situation well and ensured there was no awkward situation on live television. The PCB, however, didn't seem satisfied with the response and responded with the demand of Pycroft's removal from the roster. They added that they would withdraw from the tournament if Pycroft is not removed from Pakistan's matches.ICC stood ground and reiterated that Pycroft is not guilty of any code of conduct violation, and asserted they can't change officials as per the demands of any team as it would set a dangerous precedent. When PCB's withdrawal threat didn't work, the ACC also got involved with the same request but ICC didn't budge from its stance.As far as the men handling the communication from the Dubai office were concerned, the Pycroft chapter was closed on September 16 only but a fresh email from the PCB on September 17 gave a different angle. For the first two days - September 15 and September 16 - all the chatter was around the conduct at toss but on September 17, PCB said there were code of conduct violations during and after the India vs Pakistan match, and again questioned Pycroft's role. In response, the ICC asked PCB for more information and are yet to get a revert.Amid all the drama, Pycroft came up with a suggestion and called for a meeting with Pakistan captain Agha and manager Naveed Akram Cheema. It was also attended by coach Mike Hesson in the match referee room and Pycroft is learnt to have spoken to the Pakistan camp regarding the possible miscommunication which happened. Was this done to issue an apology, as the PCB statement claims? ""There was no question of any apology. Especially from someone who did no wrong,"" says a well-placed source. A video of the meeting is also doing rounds but the audio has been conveniently muted.Six emails, a lot of chatter but the only thing which changed was the start time of the Pakistan-UAE contest. Pycroft officiated the fixture and is set to continue doing that for the remainder of the tournament. What next for PCB? They first need to respond to ICC with more information as their previous claims have clearly fallen flat.",Icc stood ground and reiterated that pycroft is not guilty of any code of conduct violation. Pakistan decided against boarding the team bus to the stadium for their match against uae at the scheduled time.

Poll What do you think about the delay in the Pakistan vs UAE match due to the handshake controversy? It was unprofessional It added drama to the match

Metallica's song ""Nothing Else Matters"" could be the perfect theme for the Pakistan vs UAE match.It was a rock-and-roll day in Dubai.The match started an hour late after Pakistan threatened to boycott the Asia Cup if match referee Andy Pycroft continued to officiate the fixture. The players were ready to board the bus at their hotel but were asked to stay back. In Lahore, Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chief Mohsin Naqvi called up his predecessors — Najam Sethi and Ramiz Raja — to seek advice on how to deal with the ongoing crisis.Following the meeting, the PCB released a statement saying: “ICC match referee Andy Pycroft has apologised to Pakistan’s captain & manager after barring the India vs Pakistan handshake on September 14, calling it a miscommunication.”Then came a press conference in Lahore, and Mohsin Naqvi posted on X: “We have asked the Pakistan team to depart to the Dubai Cricket Stadium.”Meanwhile, PCB also released a muted video showing Pycroft speaking with Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha and coach Mike Hesson.Pycroft walked out for the toss with both captains, did his duty, and left the pitch immediately — offering no handshakes. Pakistan brushed aside the UAE by 41 runs to storm into the Super Four, setting up a blockbuster rematch against arch-rivals India on Sunday at the Dubai International Stadium.But the soap opera wasn’t over.""Let's keep the questions on the match,"" Pakistan’s media manager Naeem Gilani began the post-match press conference.Yet on a day when off-field drama overshadowed cricket, UAE captain Muhammad Waseem and Pakistan pacer Haris Rauf were pressed with tough questions.Both played it cool without giving away much.Pakistan fast bowler Haris Rauf said the team was under no pressure and credited the PCB for handling the situation well.""See, I wasn't feeling any pressure. Because these things are not in my control. These are the decisions of the board, this is a headache for them and they can manage it well,"" Haris told reporters.""Instead, I had to play a match today. My focus was only on the match. The rest of the things outside of it, management knows better and they have tackled it really well.""UAE captain Muhammad Waseem said his team’s only focus was on cricket and that the delay didn’t matter.""First of all, this is not our responsibility or our work, we are focusing on our game. We came here for the game. We came with a plan for our game, and we planned that only. We came for the warm-up normally, the way we always do, and we were ready for the game,"" the Multan-born cricketer said.""Doesn't matter if we are playing on time or playing late. We came here for the game only, and we played a game. Doesn't matter if we are playing at 6:30 or 7:30, this is not our work — this is for the organizers only.""When asked whether handshake-gate affected camaraderie in the UAE team, given that many players are from India and Pakistan, Waseem categorically denied it.""No, no, we are not talking about that because we are playing too much cricket with each other. We are very used to it, we are here like a family. No Indian, no Pakistani for us. We are playing for UAE, we are playing here as a family, we are living as a family, that's it.""To borrow lines from Nothing Else Matters, the day can be summed up simply: unfazed by the delay, the cricketers were driven by heart to play cricket -- because in the end, nothing else matters.",Pakistan beat uae by 41 runs to reach the super four of the asia cup.

Handshake drama becomes ugly! India vs Pakistan Asia Cup 2025 in DANGER?

Poll Do you think Pakistan will overcome their batting challenges against India? Yes, they will improve No, they will struggle

NEW DELHI: Fresh off the handshake controversy and the recently resolved stand-off with match referee Andy Pycroft , Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha struck a defiant note ahead of the blockbuster Super Four clash against India, declaring that his team is “ready for any challenge.”The tension between the two sides has spilled beyond the boundary rope. Their group-stage meeting in Dubai, played under the shadow of the Pahalgam terror attack on April 22, had already triggered calls for a boycott. India thrashed Pakistan by seven wickets and walked straight back to the dressing room, refusing to engage in the customary handshakes. Pakistan’s players responded by skipping the post-match presentation.Ex-cricketers lined up to criticise India’s stance, while the PCB blamed Pycroft for a “breach of conduct” and demanded his removal. The ICC’s refusal escalated the drama, even forcing Pakistan to cancel a scheduled press conference. Matters worsened before the UAE fixture when the team threatened a boycott, staying back at their Dubai Marina hotel until just 30 minutes before the toss. The standoff caused an unprecedented one-hour delay.On the field, Pakistan initially faltered again with the bat, reeling at 128/8 before Shaheen Afridi’s late fireworks — 29 off 14 balls with two sixes and a four — lifted them to 146/9. Though modest, the total proved more than enough, with Salman leading from the front alongside Abrar Ahmed and Saim Ayub as Pakistan’s spinners throttled UAE to seal a 41-run victory and a Super Four berth.Salman, however, was candid about his team’s shortcomings. “We got the job done, but we still need to improve our batting in the middle order. That’s been a concern… we’re still just finding our way to 150. If we bat well in the middle overs, we can push it to 170 no matter the opposition. Shaheen’s batting has improved a lot — he’s already great with the ball,” he said.But it was his rallying cry that set the stage for Sunday’s showdown: “We’re ready for any challenge, and if we keep playing the way we have over the last four months, we’ll be good against any side.”","India captain suryakumar yadav did not shake hands with pakistan skipper salman ali agha at the toss.

Tense faces! Pakistan cricket team arrive at ICC Academy | Will they boycott Asia Cup?

Poll Who do you think is currently the better spinner in international cricket? Kuldeep Yadav Axar Patel

Shubman Gill and Abhishek Sharma are inseparable in the nets | Exclusive visuals from Dubai

Watching India and Pakistan train at the nets reveals the gulf between the two sides.It starts with the basics — discipline and work ethic — which the Pakistan side lacks.On Tuesday, at the ICC Cricket Academy in Dubai, India and Pakistan trained at the same venue in different time slots. But even the process of training highlighted the gulf between the two teams.India's bus arrived at the venue at 5:20 pm (local time), 40 minutes before their scheduled start. India’s support staff, including side-arm throwers D Raghavendra, Nuwan Seneviratne, and Dayanand Garani, had reached 40 minutes before the team.The troika got to work immediately, setting everything in order. The moment Gautam Gambhir’s team arrived, they slipped into rhythm seamlessly.Two and a half hours later, around 7:50 pm, Pakistan’s bus arrived with just 10 minutes to go before their session. At the same time, the UAE team, who had just finished their nets, were leaving the venue. The Pakistan players stopped to banter with them, as many of the UAE cricketers are of Pakistani origin and had played with them back home.Another 30 minutes passed as Pakistan struggled to figure out what to do. They looked all at sea before captain Salman Ali Agha pulled a football out of his kitbag, and they started playing.To be honest, they were as clueless with football as they were with bat in hand against India on Sunday. Most looked like club-level batters against the Indian attack.Pakistan’s batters were miserable against India’s spin trio — Kuldeep Yadav, Varun Chakravarthy and Axar Patel.After the handshake-gate drama, Pakistan coach Mike Hesson was coaxed into defending his players.“It’s more the accuracy and the pressure that they (Indian spinners) build. When you build up a lot of dot balls, sometimes your mind plays tricks and you play big shots. So it’s not that they can’t pick spin. It’s the fact we struggle to rotate strike and relieve pressure. That’s why dismissals happened in clusters,” Hesson told TimesofIndia.com.Back at Tuesday’s nets, Indian batter Tilak Varma, who has a history of struggling against spin and looked vulnerable against Pakistan too, was facing Kuldeep and Varun in the far nets, with Gautam Gambhir and Sitanshu Kotak keeping a close eye.After 45 exhausting minutes, Tilak was drained and on his knees before being allowed to leave the nets.At the same time, Pakistan’s Saim Ayub, one of their brighter prospects, stood away from the football group, doing shadow practice with Hesson.Meanwhile, Kotak emerged from India’s dressing room with a blackboard clearly listing who would do what in training. In contrast, Pakistan’s session was trial and error.Fakhar Zaman, undone by Axar Patel’s guile on Sunday, was facing Mohammad Nawaz — whom Hesson had once called the world’s best spinner — and was hitting him with ease. Yet Fakhar again struggled against Axar, underlining the difference in quality between the two left-arm spinners.In this era, when every team has at least two side-arm throwers, Pakistan have none. As one veteran Pakistani journalist summed it up: “Hum abhi wahaan nahi pahunche hain (We haven’t reached that level yet).”The six-hour nets marathon — three each for India and Pakistan — can be summed up by Rohit Sharma’s words during the 2019 ODI World Cup, when asked what advice he would give to Pakistan’s struggling batters. Smiling, Rohit had said: “Agar main Pakistan ka coach bana to bilkul bataunga, abhi kya bataunga (If I become Pakistan’s coach, I’ll surely tell them, but not now).”Six years later, the gulf between India and Pakistan cricket has only widened — something that was clearly visible last Sunday, when the so-called rivalry was buried in Dubai’s desert.","On tuesday, at the icc cricket academy in dubai, india and pakistan trained at the same venue in different time slots.

Tense faces! Pakistan cricket team arrive at ICC Academy | Will they boycott Asia Cup?

NEW DELHI: Amid all the drama, chaos, and delays surrounding Pakistan’s Asia Cup campaign, the team finally made it to the Dubai International Stadium to take on the United Arab Emirates on Wednesday. Despite a late start and the lingering controversy from their group-stage loss to India and the handshake saga, Pakistan delivered a strong all-round performance, securing a comfortable 41-run victory and booking their place in the Super Four.With this win, Pakistan not only progress to the Super Four but also set up a high-stakes rematch against India on Sunday at the same venue, promising another thrilling contest.The match started an hour late as Pakistan threatened a pull-out after the handshake fiasco during the previous game against India before Salman Agha's team climbed down and showed up for the game.Put into bat, Pakistan had a shaky start. Saim Ayub fell without scoring, followed shortly by Sahibzada Farhan, leaving the team reeling at 9 for 2 inside the second over.Fakhar Zaman and Salman Agha tried to stabilise the innings, but wickets kept tumbling at regular intervals.Fakhar made a valiant 50, while captain Salman Agha contributed 20 before falling to Dhruv Parashar.Shaheen Afridi’s late hitting proved decisive, finishing unbeaten on 29 and guiding Pakistan to a defendable total of 146 for 9 in 20 overs. Afridi had previously impressed with 33 not out, including four sixes, against India.Junaid Siddique starred with the ball for UAE, picking up four vital wickets for 34 runs, while Simranjeet Singh claimed three more.Chasing 147, UAE tried to adopt a cautious approach to avoid another low total, but their slow scoring made the target unrealistic.Rahul Chopra (35) and Dhruv Parashar (20) added 48 for the fourth wicket, but it wasn’t enough.Pakistan maintained control throughout, and from 85 for 3 after 14 overs, UAE collapsed to 105 all out in 17.4 overs.","Pakistan beat united arab emirates by 41 runs to progress to super four.

Matthew Tkachuk injury update: Surgery, recovery timeline , and Olympic hopes

Florida Panthers depth tested as Matthew Tkachuk and Tomas Nosek remain out

Matthew Tkachuk 2024-25 Season Highlights 🔥

The early part of the upcoming NHL season will, thus, see one of the key players of the Florida Panthers sidelined from action. Matthew Tkachuk, that gritty and dynamic forward who served as the central force behind Florida's back-to-back Stanley Cup runs, is still recovering from an offseason surgery and will miss the beginning of the season. This creates both a problem and an opportunity for the Panthers as they open training camp and set out to defend their title. Though the schedule of recovery is still up in the air, December has been reasonably marked for his return.The Florida Panthers are now expecting forward Matthew Tkachuk to be sidelined till December while he recovers from an offseason surgery to correct a sports hernia and torn adductor muscle, GM Bill Zito said Wednesday. The surgery followed the 2024 playoffs, during which Tkachuk successfully played through the injuries, still managing 23 points in 23 games, including seven in the Stanley Cup Final versus the Edmonton Oilers. His toughness was indisputably lauded, but the surgery had no option but to be performed once the offseason arrived.The recovery process shall be carefully monitored, with multiple thresholds having to be met before he can return to full-speed skating.The Panthers believe that if given so much time, Tkachuk will not only go back to NHL action but will also be completely ready for the Milan-Cortina Olympic Games 2026 in February, where he will undoubtedly be a centerpiece of Team USA.The Florida Panthers shall begin their season on October 7 at home against the Chicago Blackhawks, and the team will have yet another dynamic player to adapt without. Along with Tkachuk’s absence, the Panthers will be without forward Tomas Nosek for an indefinite period due to an offseason injury. This will put an early strain on Florida's depth and forward group to make up for the scoring and leadership that Tkachuk brought in.Nevertheless, the Panthers have displayed resilience in recent years, and with a powerful core, they'll be able to get through the initial months as they wait for the star to return. His return in December could give a huge boost at the midseason for a team that's well accustomed to competing on the big stage.Also Read: Brad Marchand's future sparks debate despite Florida Panthers contract One major storyline heading into the new season marks the absence of Matthew Tkachuk, but the Florida Panthers remain hopeful of his recovery.

Shane Mosley’s verdict on the question

Terence Crawford is winning hearts with his exceptional skills

Crawford BETTER than Mayweather - Shane Mosley SOUNDS OFF!

“Crawford would have the edge,”

Boxing legend “Sugar” Shane Mosley has hopped into one of the sport’s most heated debates. The question is, who’s the better fighter, Floyd Mayweather Jr. or Terence “Bud” Crawford? Having shared the ring with Mayweather himself, Mosley’s opinion carries real weight, and his answer may surprise fans of the undefeated icon.Speaking to Fight Hub TV, the former three-division world champion made it clear that while Mayweather was “very talented,” he believes Crawford edges him out as the more complete fighter. He thinks Crawford is better, bigger, like he’s actually moving weight class, and he feels Crawford is a better all-around fighter. He added that although a Mayweather vs. Crawford bout would be a close, high-level contest, Crawford’s physical advantages, like longer reach and natural size, would tilt the fight in his favor.Mosley clearly knows what it’s like to face Mayweather. The two had a face-off 15 years ago. Mosley lost a unanimous decision to the man many consider the greatest boxer of his era. Mayweather retired with a remarkable 50-0 record. He collected titles across five weight divisions and redefined the art of defense inside the ring. He made a legacy as one of boxing’s most brilliant tacticians.But Crawford is making his own case for greatness. At 37, the Omaha native recently made his name in history by defeating Canelo Alvarez.This made him the first male fighter ever to claim undisputed status in three separate weight classes. That victory pushed him back to the top of the rankings and sparked a new round of comparisons to legends like Mayweather.Mosley’s comments ignited the dimly burning flame. He highlighted Crawford’s versatility. His effortless punching power and ability to move seamlessly through weight divisions make him stand out. Mosley suggests that the current generation may finally have produced someone who could beat Mayweather’s standing.Also Read: American Gaming Association allegedly investigating Adin Ross for Insider Trading in Canelo Alvarez vs. Terence Crawford fight The hypothetical matchup between Mayweather and Crawford will certainly stir debate among boxing enthusiasts. While it will never happen in the ring, the conversation itself underscores the sport’s richness.

Wexler-NorthJersey.com)

Justin Fields enters concussion protocol after brutal hit vs. Bills



Tyrod Taylor steps in as the Jets’ starter against the Buccaneers



What this means for the Jets’ season outlook



The New York Jets’ quarterback drama just won’t quit. Just two weeks into the season, the team has already been hit with another setback, Justin Fields is officially sidelined after entering the NFL’s concussion protocol. That means veteran Tyrod Taylor will get the start on Sunday against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. For Jets fans, it’s déjà vu, another year, another QB storyline that changes before the season even gets rolling.The injury happened late in the Jets’ Week 2 loss to the Buffalo Bills. Fields was sacked by edge rusher Joey Bosa and went down hard, hitting the turf in the fourth quarter. He was quickly evaluated for a head injury and ruled out, and on Monday, coach Aaron Glenn confirmed the worst, Fields is in the concussion protocol and won’t be cleared to play this week.It was a rough outing even before the injury. Fields completed just 3 of 11 passes for 27 yards, though he did manage 49 rushing yards. The Jets’ offense never found its rhythm, and losing their starting quarterback only added to the frustration.With Fields sidelined, the Jets will turn to a familiar veteran presence in Tyrod Taylor. The 35-year-old came in late against Buffalo and immediately gave the offense a spark, throwing a touchdown and showing poise under pressure.Taylor is no stranger to situations like this. Over his career, he’s been called on multiple times to step in when starters go down from Buffalo to Cleveland to the Giants. For the Jets, his steady play and ability to avoid mistakes could be exactly what the offense needs against a tough Buccaneers defense.This was supposed to be Justin Fields’ redemption season. After arriving in New York, the expectation was that he’d use his athleticism and playmaking ability to stabilize a team still reeling from last year’s Aaron Rodgers injury. Instead, just two games in, the Jets are already making another quarterback switch.The bigger question: how long will Fields be out? Concussion protocol timelines vary, but even a short absence could derail the Jets’ early momentum. In a crowded AFC, dropping winnable games in September can come back to haunt teams chasing playoff spots. Until then, Jets fans will be holding their breath, hoping this isn’t the start of another season derailed by quarterback injuries.Also read - “This will be a disaster”: Fans roast Stefon Diggs as Cardi B confirms pregnancy with him","Justin fields was sacked by joey bosa and went down hard, hitting the turf in the fourth quarter.
