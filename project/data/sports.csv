Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030 Push

The Scale of Investment

Ronaldo Speaks

Changing Global Perceptions

What Travellers Can Expect Next



The Real Test Ahead

Disclaimer: Content Produced by Saudi Tourism

When Cristiano Ronaldo appears in a campaign, people look. That simple fact is the fulcrum of Saudi Tourism’s latest push: a filmic, high-octane campaign titled “I Came for Football, I Stayed for More” that positions Ronaldo not just as a sporting icon but as a living, breathing emblem of Saudi’s newly ambitious events calendar – the. The film highlights how one of the world’s most recognisable athletes invites audiences to explore Saudi beyond football, from museums and desert festivals to fashion weeks and film premieres. It delivers a clear message: come for the match, stay for the rest.Ronaldo’s involvement is more than a celebrity endorsement; it’s a strategic bridge between two narratives. On one side sits the immediate, visceral thrill of live sport, stadium roars, late penalties, rivalries renewed, on the other sits a carefully curated cultural programme that Saudi wants international travellers to discover: AlUla’s rock-cut valleys, Riyadh’s sprawling seasons and fashion weeks, film festivals on the Red Sea, and purpose-built entertainment districts. Dress the country in the unmistakable glow of a global star, and you give curious travellers an easy entry point to explore the rest.This is not spin without backing. Saudi’s leadership has been investing in travel and events as part of Vision 2030, a transformation plan that has already altered the map of global tourism. Official targets have been raised now cite an ambition of 150 million visitors by 2030, and the calendar itself is swelling with headline acts: from elite motorsport and global tennis to esports and major golf tournaments. These events will help turn seasonal travel into year-round visits.The future shines when there’s growth. Saudi has committed $800 billion towards developing its tourism sector as part of Vision 2030. The industry is projected to reach $22.4 billion in market value by 2030, contributing $16.5 billion to the Kingdom’s GDP. Events play a pivotal role in this vision, not only boosting visitor numbers but also driving infrastructure growth, creating jobs and inspiring youth participation. Investments in new stadiums, arenas and grassroots programmes are central to shaping Saudi’s legacy as a leader in global sports tourism and wider entertainment.The campaign, titled “I Came for Football, I Stayed For More,” features Cristiano Ronaldo and is presented as a journey through Saudi’s expanding calendar of cornerstone events. The Saudi Tourism Authority says the campaign will run across key markets including Europe, India and China, and will use TV, social, digital and OTA channels to showcase year-round sports, entertainment, film and fashion events held across Riyadh, Jeddah and AlUla, alongside curated visitor packages aimed at making travel easier. The release also includes remarks from Saudi tourism officials underlining the kingdom’s investment in tourism as part of Vision 2030 and Ronaldo’s own comments about the country’s blend of heritage and ambition.Cristiano Ronaldo said: “Being part of Saudi’s journey as a global sports hub has been truly special and somehow unexpected for me a few years ago. Today, the truth is that from the energy of the fans to the scale of ambition, this is where the future of sport is being written. What I admire most about Saudi is how it honours its roots while building for the future. From camels to horses, racing to esports, from the desert to the stadium, this is a place where every young athlete can dream big. ”For the traveller, and for the reader back home, the immediate takeaway is an invitation to rethink Saudi as a multi-layered destination. It is not merely a place to watch world-class football or a one-note stopover; it is positioning itself as a thriving global destination where culture, sport and entertainment meet. Featuring Ronaldo at the centre, the campaign mirrors Saudi’s spirit as a modern, forward-looking destination—open, vibrant, and ready to welcome the world. His Excellency Ahmed Al Khateeb, Minister of Tourism for Saudi Arabia, stated: ""Today, Saudi is cementing its place as a global destination that combines cultural authenticity, warm hospitality, and the thrill of world-class events. In the tourism sector, we remain steadfast in our commitment to developing a seamless landscape that inspires the world and provides visitors with unforgettable experiences.""Expect blockbuster weekends where sport sits beside concerts and curated local experiences; think Formula 1 weekends wrapped with live music, or a football fixture that dovetails with a regional food festival and guided heritage walks. Tailored packages from tour operators that stitch headline events into longer itineraries are also meant to encourage visitors to stay longer.Ultimately, Saudi’s newest campaign is more than a call to sport—it’s a welcome to a nation rich with landscapes, culture, cuisine, and unforgettable experiences. With Cristiano Ronaldo amplifying its global reach, the campaign transforms into a simple truth: come for football, stay to discover Saudi.","The campaign features cristiano ronaldo and is presented as a journey through saudi’s expanding calendar of cornerstone events.

Delhi labourer is marathon champ,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-labourer-is-marathon-champ/articleshow/123774988.cms,"DEHRADUN: At a construction site in Delhi, Rohit Kumar can sometimes be spotted running with bricks on his back. A resident of Bihar's Khagaria, he may look like another labourer battling at a work site. But Kumar is also a marathon runner.The 32-year-old has secured podium finishes in at least seven marathons, including Lucknow, Dehradun and Prayagraj. His latest feat - finishing second in a gruelling high-altitude marathon in Spiti in Aug - even took the Indian Army by surprise.Commending his effort, Army's Uttar Bharat posted on X: ""At just 32, Rohit Kumar, a daily wage labourer from Delhi, doesn't chase records or sponsorships. He runs to survive, fuelled by necessity, not luxury... No coach, no fancy gear. Just raw resolve.""Kumar said he has run in over 100 marathons, averaging five a month. ""Now I am focusing on quality runs. That is why I participated in the high-altitude Spiti marathon organised by the Army, where I finished second in the 77 km Kunzum La-Kaza Ultra under the Surya Spiti Challenge,"" he told TOI.His timing in the male open category was 7:48:52, close to winner Nikhil Singh's 7:42:44.Impressed, the Army has offered him support for future runs. ""I have been invited to another high-altitude marathon in Tawang, Arunachal Pradesh. They assured me of covering my travel, food and lodging. Hopefully, I will get another podium finish,"" he added.Kumar's story could have been different. After enrolling in a medical course in Russia, he spent two years there before money ran out & his farmer-parents called him back in 2017. Struggling to find jobs back home, he took work at construction sites.In 2020, stuck indoors during Covid, he began watching videos of global marathons in New York, London and Tokyo. Inspired, he started training, squeezing time between hard labour shifts. His day begins at 4.30am with running, followed by construction work from 8 am to 5 pm, where carrying loads up floors doubles as endurance training. In the evening, he swims for an hour before cooking dinner and resting.Kumar now dreams of representing India in the Triathlon at the 2028 LA Olympics. ""I spend Rs 20,000 a month on diet and equipment from my Rs 30,000 earnings to realise this dream,"" he said.Assuring all support to Kumar, PRO Defence (Dehradun), Lt Col Manish Srivastava said, “The Indian Army is always there to support such raw talents who have the potential to make the country proud in sporting events on national and international levels. Kumar, too, will get all the support to help him excel and achieve his Olympics dream.”","Rohit kumar, 32, has run in over 100 marathons, averaging five a month.

Aryna Sabalenka has been open about navigating personal tragedy while continuing to dominate the tennis world. Following the sudden passing of her ex-boyfriend, Konstantin Koltsov, in March 2024, the Belarusian star found support in a new relationship with Brazilian entrepreneur Georgios Frangulis. The two went public in spring 2024, and since then, he has become a familiar face courtside, cheering her on at major tournaments.Aryna Sabalenka admitted that her new relationship came during an incredibly difficult chapter in her life. She credited Georgios Frangulis with helping her focus on joy beyond the pressures of tennis.“There was a really tough period where I was really happy to have him by my side, always cheering me up, always making sure that we are doing some fun stuff,” Sabalenka told People. “But I make sure I kind of forget about tennis and focus on the good things and enjoy my life. Even when things are going wrong in my career. So yeah, he was my biggest support and yeah, really happy to have him by my side.”Their relationship became public when they were first pictured together in April 2024. Since then, Frangulis has been spotted regularly in her player’s box, including at her title run at the 2024 US Open.Born and raised in São Paulo, Brazil, to a Greek family originally from Thessaloniki, Frangulis pursued law at Fundação Armando Alvares Penteado but never became a lawyer. His passion was always in entrepreneurship. After graduating in 2014, he moved to the United States, first living in Miami and later in California.A spiritual person, Frangulis has spoken about how faith shaped his outlook. “I go to church a lot, talking to God does me good. I was influenced by both branches of the family. The spiritual side has always been important to me – as well as intuition,” he told Forbes Brazil.In 2016, Frangulis founded Oakberry, an açaí-based brand that has since expanded worldwide. Known for its bowls and smoothies, Oakberry now has hundreds of locations across more than 40 countries. By January 2024, Sabalenka herself became an ambassador for the brand, later launching her own signature bowl.“Most of the time I go for Oakberry bowl; I think it's healthy and a good thing to start your day,” Sabalenka said in an interview. “It has everything you [want]: protein, carbs, vitamins, fruit. It's like an energy bowl, so I feel ready to go after I have it.”Beyond business, Frangulis balances his entrepreneurial career with his passion for motorsports. He has raced in Porsche GT3 Cup Challenge events and the Porsche Mobil 1 Supercup, finding in racing both adrenaline and escape.Georgios Frangulis has a visible presence in Aryna Sabalenka’s careerWhile Oakberry has sponsored tennis tournaments before, Frangulis admitted the experience of sitting in Sabalenka’s box is far more intense. “The toughest part is being in the box. It’s one of the most stressful situations I’ve ever experienced,” he said.“I never say anything during matches. I try not to show too much emotion, because Aryna notices everything – what everyone is doing in the box. I just clap as loudly as I can and make sure she feels supported.”Also Read: Who is Naomi Osaka’s husband?

The final drive with Walter Gretzky that meant more than the farewell ovation

Lessons from Walter Gretzky that shaped a hockey icon

Wayne Gretzky’s last NHL appearance on April 18, 1999, at Madison Square Garden is remembered as a celebration of the “Great One’s” extraordinary career. Yet, for Gretzky, the moment wasn’t only about the sold-out crowd, the ovations, or the history—it was about a quiet car ride with his father, Walter Gretzky.On the 25th anniversary of his retirement, Wayne Gretzky aka The Great One reflected on why he asked Walter to drive him to Madison Square Garden that night. “For my final game, I decided that since my dad drove me to the first game I ever went to, it would be great to drive my dad to my last game,” he told NHL.com.That ride, however, was far from ordinary. Gretzky admitted, “The ride was good, but it was kind of awful in the same sense because every three minutes, he kept hitting my leg and telling me that I could play one more year. I said, ‘No, dad, I’m done.’”While the NHL and fans worldwide treated the day as a fitting farewell to the greatest player in hockey history, Gretzky cherished that personal moment most. To him, it was the perfect full-circle memory, blending his first steps in hockey with the end of his iconic journey.Wayne Gretzky's father, Walter Gretzky was more than just a supportive parent—he was the guiding force behind Wayne’s rise.When officials tried to block young Wayne from moving to Toronto in 1974, Walter stood firm, saying, “No, they can't tell me where to send my own boy… If he will be happy elsewhere, we decide between the family.”Also read: What is the Wayne Gretzky Rule and how it changed the modern NHL forever Walter’s philosophy of family first left a lifelong mark on Wayne, who carried those values into his career and personal life. Though Walter passed away in 2021, his wisdom continues to influence Gretzky, reminding fans that behind the hockey legend was always a devoted son. Walter taught Wayne, Keith, Brent, Glen, and their friends hockey on a rink he made in the backyard of the family home, nicknamed the ""Wally Coliseum"".After his retirement in 1999, Wayne Gretzky was immediately inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame, making him the most recent player to have the waiting period waived. The NHL retired his jersey number 99 league-wide. Gretzky was one of six players voted to the International Ice Hockey Federation's (IIHF) Centennial All-Star Team.The Great One's career achievements include a record nine Hart Trophies as the most valuable player in the NHL. Between 1981 and 1994, he won the Art Ross Trophy, presented to the NHL's season points leader, 10 times.Wayne Gretzky had a major influence on the style of play of the Edmonton Oilers and the NHL as a whole, helping to inspire a more team-based strategy. Using this approach, the Oilers, led by Wayne Gretzky, became the highest-scoring team in NHL history.","Wayne gretzky's father, walter, was the guiding force behind his hockey rise.

Kalen Jackson , daughter of Jim Irsay, leaves an emotive note for the departed legend



""There's a man who gave so much to this city and this organization,""

""He's not with us physically, but he's in this locker room spiritually. He's watching down on us. And he raised three daughters to run a football team. And we couldn't be more thankful.""

""Jim, we love you, we miss you,”

“This means so much. Someone said the [retractable] roof was open so he could watch us, and he was with every single one of you.

He loved this team so much.”

,

Jim Irsay continues to be a dynamic part of the team spirit of the Colts

“He loved the Colts, the horseshoe, and was the kind of owner every player dreams of playing for,”

Also read:

When the Colts clinched a stupendous win during Sunday’s season opener over Miami, Coach Shane Steichen breathed a sigh of despair. It’s as contradictory as it sounds. The moment Daniel Jones ran for two touchdowns and threw for another one, the Colts dodged the most ruthless record of an 11-winless opening game streak. Fans burst into celebration, the locker room beamed with pride, a slew of franchise legends, and someone from the sky chuckled a little as if he knew what his boys could do. Late Jim Irsay, who died in May, had watched down on the team from afar, as the coach believed. Moreover, Irsay’s daughter had something special to add to mark the team’s first win without his dad.Steichen said of Irsay in a heartwarming mid-game speech.quarterback Peyton Manning added to the overflowing emotion after the legend was inducted into the Ring of Honor, and the Irsay daughters couldn’t help but join. Kalen Jackson, the daughter of Jim Irsay, the co-owner and chief brand officer of the Indianapolis Colts, said,Jackson also thanked fans who all etched their art onto the piece of paper and made Jim alive at the Lucas Oil Stadium this Sunday through a splendid mural.Jackson and the other twoIrsay-Gordon, Casey Foyt, were given three prestigious game balls by the coach after the game went down, symbolic of a strong transition as they have seamlessly been carrying the torch since their father’s demise.They say legends die, their spirit carries on. Jim has left so many unfinished wishes and works that the next generation automatically took the chair and let the legacy flow. Irsay has been a fixture on and off the field.Payton Manning rightly articulated.Jim was and is deeply loved across Indianapolis. His death brought his broad philanthropic gestures and thoughts to the surface, making him more of an idol to future generations. Starting from kicking the stigma campaign that contributed significantly to the mental health industry to paying for the funerals of the people who lost their loved ones, the former Colts owner carved a path that’s beyond football. That’s not just it. Jim also left a wish to donate an enormous amount of money to every Colts staff member as a token of his last thank you! His daughters will continue walking in his path, but a leader like him remains a lost treasure.","Jim irsay's daughter, kalen jackson leaves a message for fans.

This edition of Monday Night RAW comes live from the Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. After AJ Lee's return to the WWE on SmackDown last week, more than a decade later inside the ring, she will make her way into the RAW show tonight. Along with Lee, her husband CM Punk, and their opponents, Becky Lynch and Seth Rollins , will also be present. Let's get into what happened at the show tonight right away!The show starts with a shot of Becky Lynch and Seth Rollins entering the venue. Lynch looks a little scared of the cameras pointing towards her, and Rollins tries his best to shield her as they make their way in. Next, we see The Usos, who are making a grand entrance together for the first time in a while. Echoes of YEET fill the arena as Jey, followed by Jimmy, enters the ring to greet the audience.Jey begins by saying that Rollins and the Bronies, the Bronses, the Brusos, whatever the fans wanted to call ‘em, have screwed up. Of course, this is when the Bron 'n Bron Connection makes their way in. The Usos are the crowd favorite, while the heels play their part perfectly. We learn that a tag team match between the four of them has been scheduled for Wrestlepalooza.While the back and forth is happening, LA Knight attacks The Vision crew out of nowhere. Bron Breakker and Bronson Reed overwhelm him soon, but The Usos come to his rescue. Things are not rainbows and sunshine between the Usos and Knight, but the three end the segment by sending the heels packing. Knight then goes to Adam Pearce backstage, when fans see Byron Saxton rolling up to do an interview. Knight asks Pearce for a match with one of the Brons, but if he can't get that, he will take anyone. Looks like we have an opponent for him.The first fight of the night was between AJ Styles and El Grande Americano, who was responsible for Styles losing his Intercontinental Championship title. The bell rings and the match starts right away, as Styles launches Americano through the ropes with a dropkick. The match moves from inside the ring to the outside and back inside in minutes, as the two men continue to gain control over the other.The match has been ongoing for a while when El Grande Americano II makes his way to the stage to run interference. After a near fall for Styles, he tries to make a comeback, but it's difficult with two opponents. Just then Dragon Lee makes his entrance to even the playing field. Styles takes advantage of that and hits Americano with a Styles Clash to take the win.Styles and Lee hug after the win and lead the show to the next segment. Backstage, we see Adam Pearce talking to IYO SKY, informing her that the contract signing between her and Stephanie Vaquer has been postponed because Vaquer couldn't make it tonight, but the show is still on. Next, we see Sky talking to Nikki Bella when the Kabuki Warriors roll in.Of course, Asuka tells Nikki to leave who doesn't like the way she is being treated. Bella tells Asuka that she doesn’t have to like her but she has to respect her. In turn, Asuka tells her she’ll beat the respect into her tonight and leaves. Looks like we got another match in our hands. Kairi Sane, as usual, looks awkward, trying to smooth things over, but is called off by Asuka soon enough.Last week, Adam Pearce gave in to the demands of Lyra Valkyria, and now we have an official match between her and one of the Judgment Day members - and it looks like it's going to be Raquel Rodriguez. The latter has an advantage over Valkyria with her towering physique, which she takes full advantage of.They both are powerhouse performers, and try to gain an advantage over the other. From Rodriguez throwing Valkyria into the turnbuckles to the latter hitting Rodriguez with a reverse chinlock - the fight goes on for a while, as both women have their advantages and disadvantages over one another. Finally, with a one-armed powerbomb, Rodriguez manages to clinch the win against Valkyria.Backstage, we see Penta with the War Raiders, before he walks away with Adam Pearce. He tells Pearce that he wants a title match, when Rusev walks in, complaining that things are not going according to what they had planned. Penta gets in his face and Rusev is not one to back down either. Instead, the RAW GM books Rusev and Penta for a first-time-ever match tonight.In the next segment, we see AJ Styles chatting with Dragon Lee, grateful for his help tonight. Elsewhere, Big Jim is looking for his big brother and finally rings him near the exit. He tells Jey they should help LA Knight in his fight tonight, but Jey isn't interested in that. Jimmy says he is starting to sound less like himself and more like Reigns, and Jey says maybe that's not a bad thing.Finally, the much-awaited segment arrives - as AJ Lee makes her way into the ring wearing Becky Lynch's International Championship belt. She apologizes for keeping everyone waiting, and fans give her a loud ""welcome back!"" She talks to the audience for a while and reminds everyone who she is and what she has been doing for the last 10 years. She then brings up Lynch, and says in another world they could have been friends as they have a lot in common.Lynch of course, makes her way in at that moment and says they have nothing in common - she’s the greatest female wrestler of all time. She says Lee should give her the title belt back and gets mad when AJ recounts all that she has done while wearing the belt so far. She then lays the belt down and asks Lynch to come and get it herself, but the latter hesitates.Seth Rollins comes in next and tells AJ to give the title back to Becky so that they can all leave. But Lee says she has a better idea - Lynch could come inside the ring and take back her title belt, or she will give it to her if they agree to a tag team match - AJ Lee and CM Punk vs. Becky Lynch and Seth Rollins. Rollins says she doesn't make the rules here, but before he can grab the belt, she blocks him.CM Punk, of course, makes his way into the stage then and cold shoulders Lynch. He gets in the ring and fireman’s carry Rollins, but he gets away and joins Lynch on the ramp. He picks up the mic he had dropped while trying to get away and accepts the mixed tag match for Wrestlepalooza. AJ Lee, as promised, gives Lynch her title back by throwing it out of the ring towards her, and then hugs Punk with a massive grin on her face.Both Penta and Rusev get in position as soon as the bell rings. Rusev runs at Penta and the latter retaliates with chops. Penta has a near fall after a clothesline from his opponent. He then takes down Rusev with a headscissors and then hits a backstabber, but the latter kicks out immediately. The fight continues, as Rusev slams Penta’s head onto the announce desk, and then when he runs at him again, Penta moves out the way, making Rusev crash into the steel steps.The New Day alongside Grayson Walker make their way in, who are no doubt pissed off for losing against Penta and the War Raiders. They try to run interference, but Penta hits them with a dive. Penta then dives off the top-rope, but gets hit with a machka kick from Rusev on the way down, who covers him for a win.Backstage, Jimmy Uso meets with LA Knight, and asks him if what happened with Jey tonight was an accident. Knight says it wasn't in his hands, to which Big Jim says that they should keep aside their beef and focus on the Bron's. But Knight doesn't want his help - Jey cost him his last world title match, while Jimmy cost him the match when he faced Roman Reigns. So it's better that they don't try to help him anymore.Nikki Bella and Asuka lock up once the bell rings. Bella hits with a dropkick, Asuka counters with a knee to the nose. Nikki then hits Asuka with one of her huge elbows, followed by a spinebuster, and covers for two counts. Nikki goes for another hit, but Asuka uses Kairi Sane as a human shield, and this could be the straw that broke the camel's back in the long run.Bella pulls Kairi aside, which gives the Empress time to blast her with a flash kick. Asuka goes for a huge German suplex, heads up to the top for a missile dropkick, but Bella dodges it. She then charges in with a lariat, followed by springboard roundhouse to cover, but Asuka kicks out before the three count. Finally, it is yet another Asuka Lock that gives the Empress the win.Backstage, we see The Judgment Day celebrating Raquel Rodriguez's win over Lyra Valkyria tonight when Dominik Mysterio rolls in. Finn Balor asks him where he had been, and also warns him against El Grande Americano, but Dom isn't concerned about that. Mysterio says it’s a lucha thing and they wouldn’t understand, and says it’s their fault for getting ejected, before leaving.In another setting, Nikki Bella faces Asuka once more for the night, where the latter gloats about her win, asking if she is ready for Round 2. Rhea Ripley shows up, getting in Asuka's face, and asks if they’ve got a problem. Asuka says yes - the two of them. The Japanese then says she’s the top woman in WWE when Ripley points out that it is IYO SKY who has a title match next. Asuka storms off as Kairi Sane is left standing awkwardly, before a growl from the former makes her move again.Both LA Knight and Bronson Reed look fired up for the last match up of the night. Knight backs Reed into the corner with punches, and though the latter tries to circle back, Knight blocks him and keeps raining punches. Reed hits his opponent with a hammer whip, throwing Knight out of the ring, where of course, Bron Breakker is waitingKnight gets to the top-rope and hits a flying elbow for a close two-count. Breakker, inevitably, gets involved again, leading to a Jagged Edge from Reed for the pin and win.Of course, now it's time for a post-match beatdown of Knight by the Bron 'n Bron Connection. Jimmy Uso runs into the ring attempting to make the save, but gets hit with a spear. The Vision duo are relentless, and keep hitting Knight and Jimmy when Jey Uso finally shows up. He hits Breakker and Reed, but the two overwhelm him soon enough. Knight though, now recovered after a little break, uses a steel chair to finally run off Reed and Breakker.As The Vision walks off the stage, fans see Knight asking Jimmy Uso if they’re good now, who says they are. But then the very next moment, Jey hits Knight with a spear to end the show.Also Read: WWE SmackDown results and highlights (09/06/2025): John Cena’s final SmackDown, Brock Lesnar appears, AJ Lee returns, and More","This edition of monday night raw comes live from the fiserv forum in milwaukee, wisconsin.

He was the all-time leading scorer for Team USA until Kevin Durant passed him, but Anthony considered himself a pioneer who laid the groundwork for others.The statement quickly caught the eye of other players, including Draymond Green from the Golden State Warriors, who has his own background with Team USA, having snagged gold medals in both 2016 and 2020.Green, who is known for being vocal on social media, finally spoke up about it the next day.However on Sunday he only posted one word to Threads in response to Anthony stating, ""Truth."", he supported the the claim of Carmello Anthony.The background of this conversation comes from the common experiences of Anthony and Green as they represented the United States internationally. Anthony has one of the most impressive Olympic careers in basketball history.He made his debut with Team USA at the 2004 Athens Olympics, where they secured a bronze medal after a less-than-stellar showing. This disappointment resulted in the creation of the 'Redeem Team' in 2008, featuring Anthony with legends like Kobe Bryant and LeBron James. That team brought home the gold in Beijing, bringing back USA Basketball's supremacy.Anthony was always there to answer the call, playing a key role in winning gold medals at London 2012 and Rio 2016. In his Hall of Fame speech and various interviews, he pointed out this service saying, “When it comes down to just representing, and using the word ‘serving,’ I’ve served this country for a long time and represented this country for a long time.”Green's brief comment on Threads was the first sign of a current NBA player breaking their silence regarding Anthony's self-assessment. As a fellow Olympian, Green's endorsement held significant value, given his own involvement with Team USA. Yet, as the dialogue surrounding Anthony's assertion circulated through social media and sports channels, additional details started to surface.There’s been a lot of talk among analysts and fans about whether Anthony is genuinely the ""face"" of USA Basketball, particularly when you think about icons like Michael Jordan from the 1992 Dream Team or more recent players like Durant. Anthony's claim comes from his reliability and his readiness to step up repeatedly, even when other elite players decided to sit out.It was apparent through his interviews that Anthony was pleased with his retirement in his career. In the end, he was ready to retire after the 2021-22 season with the Lakers; more opportunities were not something he wanted to pursue.Also Read: “I wanted to die on the ice for the fans” — Klim Kostin opens door to Edmonton Oilers reunion This was contrary to the other veterans like Dwight Howard or Vince Carter who carried on with their career in a bid to seek championships.

Balancing loyalty with strategic asset management

How a trade could benefit both Anders Lee and the Islanders

New York Islanders captain Anders Lee finds himself at a career crossroads as General Manager Mathieu Darche’s recent remarks have stirred speculation about his long-term future with the team. While Lee’s leadership and net-front presence are unquestioned, his age and contract demands place the Islanders in a challenging position under the salary cap era.At 35, Lee is entering the latter stages of his career, and committing to a high-value, long-term contract could hinder the Islanders’ flexibility. Darche’s approach—delaying contract talks—reflects a “wait-and-see” strategy that prioritizes organizational stability. This isn’t a critique of Lee’s impact on the ice; rather, it’s a pragmatic decision in today’s NHL where cap space and future planning are crucial. Veteran players with proven scoring ability often attract interest from contenders willing to maximize their playoff potential, and Lee fits that profile perfectly.A trade could serve as a strategic move, allowing the Islanders to extract draft picks or promising prospects while giving Lee an opportunity to chase a Stanley Cup elsewhere. “There’s always the chance Lee could re-sign with the Islanders in the offseason,” notes sources, emphasizing that a move wouldn’t necessarily be permanent. If he returns, expectations point toward a shorter-term deal with a more manageable salary range of $3.5 million to $4.5 million.For the Islanders, this approach separates emotion from team building, giving them flexibility to inject youth and cost-controlled talent into the roster. As the trade deadline approaches, fans can expect heightened speculation and analysis around Lee’s situation. Staying informed through reliable sources ensures supporters are up-to-date on every potential twist in the Islanders’ ongoing roster strategy.Also Read: NHL Trade Rumors: Could trading Brandon Carlo be the Maple Leafs’ only path to a top-six forward?
