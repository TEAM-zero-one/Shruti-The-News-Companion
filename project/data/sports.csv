'We don't look at averages and stats': Gautam Gambhir on sending Axar Patel at No. 5

NEW DELHI: Eyebrows were raised when India announced five spinners in the team for the ICC Champions Trophy . Historically, the pitches in Dubai do not overly favour spinners. However, the venue has also just got done with the month-long ILT20 league which may have left the pitches tired and more amenable to spin. Predominantly, though, India’s spinner-heavy squad was chosen to lengthen the batting lineup, TOI has learnt.The trend emerging from head coach Gautam Gambhir ’s tenure is the inclination to have more allrounders in the lineup across formats. Gambhir has been vocal about the need to bat deep. Seambowling allrounders are a rarity at the moment. Hence, Washington Sundar too has made the cut along with Axar Patel and Ravindra Jadeja Interestingly, it was Gambhir who insisted on having Shivam Dube back in the ODI scheme of things by adding him to the list of non-travelling reserves, say insiders.Gambhir is someone who prefers to have more options in the playing XI. More allrounders give him the chance to be flexible. If India advance in the tournament, spinners are likely to play a greater role.The idea, according to those in the know of developments, is simple — play two steady finger-spinners who can bat well to complement either Kuldeep Yadav or Varun Chakravarthy . Kuldeep and Chakravarthy are seen as genuine strike options. If the pitches at the start look like they can produce big runs, one might see Chakravarthy in the XI ahead of Kuldeep. The majority of Chakravarthy’s wickets have come while the batters have been looking to push the scoring rate. Kuldeep is seen as someone who can deceive the batter in the air and lure him into a false shot, like he did against England in the last ODI in Ahmedabad on Wednesday.Also See: Champions Trophy Schedule 2025 There are other factors too. India have played two Asia Cups at the venue over the last seven years and never played more than two frontline spinners in the XI.Jasprit Bumrah’s absence and Mohammed Shami being rusty after a long injury layoff has played a part in India picking a spin-heavy attack which can compensate for the inexperience of the two new pacers, Harshit Rana and Arshdeep Singh. It will be interesting to see how India’s campaign unfolds on the Dubai pitches, which usually sport a layering of grass to prevent the surface from cracking up.",The trend emerging from head coach gautam gambhir ’s tenure is the inclination to have more allrounders in the lineup across formats.

""Beasley’s ability to stretch the floor would be invaluable for a team with two elite passers like Doncic and James.""

Theare reportedly eyeing a move to bolster their three-point shooting, withemerging as a potential target. After a tough 131-119 loss to the Utah Jazz , where the Lakers’ three-point struggles were evident despite a 40% shooting night, the team is looking to address its inconsistent deep-range efficiency. Currently ranked 17th in the league with a 36.0% three-point shooting rate, the Lakers believe Beasley could be the solution to elevate their offense.Malik Beasley, 28, is having a career-best season with the Pistons, shooting 41.8% from beyond the arc on a career-high 9.4 attempts per game. His performance has been historic, breaking the Pistons’ single-season record for three-pointers made with 212, surpassing Saddiq Bey’s previous mark of 211. Beasley demonstrated his skills in a recent 132-92 thumping of the Chicago Bulls, scoring 24 points and making seven of ten three-pointers.The Los Angeles Lakers ’ interest in Malik Beasley stems from their need for a reliable perimeter shooter to complement the playmaking of Luka Doncic and LeBron James . Both stars struggled in the loss to the Jazz, combining for eight turnovers and a -29 plus-minus rating. Adding Beasley could provide the Lakers with a consistent drive-and-kick option, enhancing their offensive versatility.Beasley, a former Laker, had a brief stint with the team during the 2022-23 season after being traded from the Jazz. While he averaged 11.1 points, his three-point shooting dipped to 35.3% in 26 games. However, his current form suggests he could offer significant improvement if he returns to Los Angeles.The guard signed a one-year, $6 million deal with the Pistons last offseason, aiming to secure a long-term contract in 2025. His breakout season has positioned him as a sought-after free agent, and the Los Angeles Lakers could make a strong push to reunite with him.

Their romance blossomed into the spotlight after Gondrezick was spotted cheering him on during the Celtics' triumphant championship parade.In July 2024, the Boston Celtics player walked the ESPY Awards carpet with WNBA free agent Kysre Gondrezick, confirming their relationship.

Fans quickly noticed that Gondrezick was with Brown as he celebrated at the parade in Boston after he and the Celtics secured the championship victory in June 2024.Although the official explanation for the breakup has not been made public, insiders indicate that a variety of factors may have played a role in this decision. The overwhelming media attention that often surrounds high-profile athletes can be incredibly taxing, leaving very little opportunity for personal space and privacy. Additionally, the rigorous schedules that professional athletes face, which include demanding training routines, extensive travel commitments, and relentless media scrutiny, can also place considerable stress on even the most resilient of relationships.Prior to her romance with Brown, Gondrezick was involved with former NBA player Kevin Porter Jr. That relationship unfortunately ended with a disturbing incident involving alleged assault.

Bill Belichick and Jordon Hudson Reportedly Discuss Future Together



A New Coaching Era at UNC for Bill Belichick



Bill Belichick , the legendary head coach known for his unparalleled success with the New England Patriots, experienced a transformative 2024. After parting ways with the franchise he led to six Super Bowl victories, he embarked on a new media career, making appearances on podcasts, television shows, and social media platforms. This change not only gave fans a rare glimpse into his personality beyond the rigid, tactical mastermind they were familiar with but also shined a light on his personal life—particularly his relationship with Jordon Hudson .Belichick’s romance with 24-year-old Jordon Hudson has been a major talking point throughout the year. Having met on a flight in 2022, the couple has shared numerous experiences together, with Hudson standing by his side during pivotal moments, including his transition into media and, most recently, his return to coaching. Their relationship has also sparked curiosity due to their significant 48-year age difference, but those close to them suggest it is not a concern.""Jordon is an old soul so she and Bill connect on a deep level. Age is just a number to them,"" a source revealed.Reports suggest that the couple has already discussed taking their relationship to the next level. ""They have definitely discussed marriage,"" the source told Page Six, adding that it ""isn't out of the question"" that they could eventually tie the knot. However, financial prudence seems to be a priority, as the source made it clear that “they would definitely get a prenup.”Despite the public attention, Hudson has reportedly remained patient and unpressured regarding a proposal. “Jordon hasn’t put any pressure on Bill at all to propose, and she feels like it will happen when and if the time is right,"" the source stated. Meanwhile, Belichick appears unfazed by their near five-decade age gap.Hudson has not just been a quiet supporter; she has been actively involved in Belichick’s public life. She accompanied him to New Orleans for Super Bowl 59, attending the prestigious NFL Honors event where the coach’s relationship became the subject of some lighthearted humor. Snoop Dogg, known for his witty remarks, took a playful jab at their age gap, joking, ""I've been a football fan for a long, long time. … Bill Belichick's girlfriend wasn't even born yet.""Despite the joke, Belichick and Hudson embraced the event with confidence. The legendary coach showcased his immense success by wearing all eight of his Super Bowl rings—six from his time with the Patriots and two from his days as the New York Giants’ defensive coordinator. Hudson, on the other hand, proudly displayed her own championship pedigree, sporting a national championship ring for cheerleading, which she won in 2021.At the Super Bowl itself, Hudson made a statement by donning a custom leather jacket featuring patches that represented each of Belichick’s Super Bowl titles. Her unwavering support was on full display, solidifying her presence in this new chapter of his life.While his personal life has generated buzz, Belichick’s professional aspirations remain as ambitious as ever. Set to return to coaching in 2025, he was officially introduced as the new head coach at the University of North Carolina in November 2024. With Hudson by his side at the press conference, it was evident that she continues to be a key part of his journey.Now, as he prepares to lead the Tar Heels into a new era, Belichick has already been making moves in the transfer portal, bringing in fresh talent ahead of his first season in charge. His legendary football acumen will undoubtedly be tested in the college ranks, but with decades of experience and an impressive track record, his impact on UNC is expected to be significant.Also Read: “Wasn’t even born”: Tom Brady was dying of laughter when talking about Bill Belichick’s 24-year-old girlfriend With 2024 behind him, Bill Belichick is stepping into a future filled with both professional challenges and personal milestones.

Darick Hall Seizes Opportunity to Compete for First Base Role as Pirates Look for Power at the Plate

Darick Hall Takes Batting Practice with Pittsburgh Pirates! (2025 MLB Spring Training)

The Pirates, perhaps quite recently, have stubbed their toe on a diamond-in-the-rough or mighty bat poised to take a swing toward spring training glory. With first baseman Spencer Horwitz now lost to an uncertain amount of time due to a right wrist injury, a major opportunity has fallen to eager minor leaguer and another signee of the Pirates, Darick Hall . Hall signed a minor league contract with the team in December, subsequently landing himself a nifty golden ticket: the chance to claim the first base spot in spring training.You could safely say that Derek Shelton , manager of the Pirates, is quite excited about this new opportunity. About Hall, Shelton had only nice things to say, especially when it came to that big stick of his. ""He's definitely going to be in the competition,"" Shelton claimed to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, ""A big-body guy with the ability to have good at-bats and hit the ball out of the park."" We've seen him do it before in the big leagues, and we like the bat. We know what he brings.""Now, to those not in the know, this is the story of perseverance and hard work that got Darick Hall to this moment. Hall was drafted 14th overall by the Philadelphia Phillies in the 2016 MLB Draft and, after slogging it out in the minors for several years, made his long-awaited debut, at last, in 2022. Over 42 games, his display was condensed into a .250/.282/.522 line with the help of nine impressive home runs. Not bad for a rookie. Too bad, however, it was still not enough to secure Hall a place on the postseason roster during the Phillies' World Series run.But in baseball, they always say the game is about second chances-and Hall is about ready to grab his. In 2023, he made the Opening Day roster to fill in while stars Bryce Harper and Rhys Hoskins were recovering from injuries. Unfortunately, a thumb injury requiring surgery cut Hall's shot with the ball club short, but that didn't shake his determination.Now comes Hall's time to shine with a new opportunity against the Pirates. The Grapefruit League is starting, and Hall is ready to showcase to the world that a bat of his caliber belongs in the big, and the Pirates may just have stumbled upon a sleeper candidate who could make some noise at first base. Watch out, the world of baseball-Hall is showing up and showing out!","Darick hall was drafted 14th overall by the philadelphia phillies in the 2016 mlb draft.

Joey Gallo joins White Sox on Minor League Deal – is this the comeback to revive his slugger status?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/mlb/news/joey-gallo-joins-white-sox-on-minor-league-deal-is-this-the-comeback-to-revive-his-slugger-status/articleshow/118257835.cms,"<p>Image via:Getty Images<br></p>

From Free Agent to Minor Leaguer: Can Joey Gallo Reignite His Career with the White Sox?



Joey Gallo Breaks Statcast With MONSTER DONG

In a situation unheard-of concerning historical precedence, the Chicago White Sox offered a minor-league contract and a spring-training invitation to non-roster player Joey Gallo , an ex-two-time All-Star. Gallo—once a home-run machine with the Texas Rangers and New York Yankees—will now attempt to crack again with his emergence as a free agent after the Washington Nationals just this past November chose to opt out of an $8 million mutual option. So, does that mean either he sets up a bomb squad or wildly misses?For those who remember Gallo's pride of All-Star gallantry in days gone by—ah the great days when he was a scourge to pitchers—this deal might appear to be a worthy home run. Yet for others who can only watch on as Gallo's batting average hits a free fall , , not prejudging really seems hard. His Yankee career was a whirlwind: mammoth home runs…then mammoth strikeouts. The only consistency in Gallo's play reflected that of Chicago weather: one day sunny and full of promise, the next a gale blow from the cold with everybody wondering where it went wrong.Following a complete gutting-session of a rebuilding season, the White Sox hope Gallo can add some pop to their lacking lineup. Gallo offers the excitement of left-handed power in a very uninspiring roster. His ability to crush right-handed pitching is exactly what the Sox could use—some serious hurting, with a big dose of strikeouts along the way.However, his being in spring training must not earmark him for a ticket straight to the majors. He'll have to prove himself in what should be a very competitive child. Will he find the sweet spot and channel the power that once made him one of the game's most-feared sluggers, or will he simply be a project added to the growing White Sox list?In any event, the signing piques interest, foments a few laughs, and provides a great deal of hope for the future. In or around spring training, the baseball world will be watching with bated breath to see if Joey Gallo can swing his way back into relevance or if his White Sox chapter was just a brief one.",The chicago white sox offered a minor-league contract and a spring-training invitation to joey gallo.

Chicago Bears’ Biggest Offseason Dilemma: Is D’Andre Swift Still Their Lead Back?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/chicago-bears-biggest-offseason-dilemma-is-dandre-swift-still-their-lead-back/articleshow/118249507.cms,"(Image Via Getty)

D’Andre Swift’s Future: Starter or Rotation Player?

Swift’s performance, coupled with Johson’s intention to run the ball, has led many around the football world to speculate about upgrades — but pinpointing the location is tricky,""

The Chicago Bears enter the 2025 offseason with several pressing roster decisions, but an unexpected position has been identified as their biggest concern —running back. Most would have assumed such arrangements would be put into consideration on the offensive and defensive line front but Pro Football Focus (PFF) believes that Bears' most important decision revolves around D’Andre Swift.After signing D’Andre Swift to a three-year, $24 million deal in 2024, the Bears expected him to be a key piece of their offense. However, he struggled to consistently pick up tough yards between the tackles, leaving questions about his fitness in the system. With new head coach Ben Johnson focused on building a strong running game, the Bears now have to decide whether to stick with Swift or bring in a more physical, every-down back who better fits their vision.Given his $8.7 million dead cap hit, outright cutting Swift seems unlikely. However, that doesn’t mean he’ll remain the Bears’ top running back in 2025. Instead, it’s expected that Johnson will look for a more physical, between-the-tackles runner who would fit his ideas on offense.PFF’s Bradley Locker noted the challenges of addressing the position, writing:Free agency doesn’t provide many long-term solutions, and the only top-tier name left is an old veteran- Aaron Jones , who isn’t a logical fit for Chicago. So, the best thing the Bears can do is look for their next feature back in the 2025 NFL Draft.If the Bears seek to address the position in the draft, Day 2 looks like the sweet spot. PFF suggests North Carolina's Omarion Hampton or Iowa's Kaleb Johnson as potential second-round targets. Either one offers the downhill, bruising running style that Johnson may prefer over Swift's elusive, outside-the-tackles running.If the Bears do invest an early pick in a running back, that may signal a relatively short run for Swift as the lead back. He will only incur a $1.3 million dead cap hit should they choose to move on following 2026, so if he does not fit Johnson's long-term vision, the Bears can easily release him.While the upgrades for offensive and defensive lines remain of great importance, the running back position has emerged as a bigger question this offseason than originally expected. With Swift's future being an uncertain RB1, the incline favors a Bears key addition in the upcoming draft. This does not bode well for Swift, who may have his role reduced or might even leave; it seems Chicago's main running-back role has become vacant much sooner than anyone expected.Also Read : Chiefs are facing an identity crisis on offense, regardless of Travis Kelce mulling retirement","D’andre swift signed a three-year, $24 million deal in 2024.

How Mohammed Shami’s horoscope foretells India's success in Champions Trophy

Champions Trophy: Will India and South Africa clash in another ICC final?

NEW DELHI: World Cup-winning captain Kapil Dev on Friday voiced concern over the growing number of injuries among Indian cricketers, blaming the demanding schedule that keeps players on the field for nearly 10 months a year. He pointed out that the National Cricket Academy in Bengaluru has become more of a rehabilitation center, with players spending more time recovering than training.The latest setback is India’s pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah , who missed the second innings of the final Test in Sydney due to a back injury. Initially named in India’s Champions Trophy squad, Bumrah has now been ruled out of the tournament.Meanwhile, Mohammed Shami , India’s leading wicket-taker in the 2023 ODI World Cup with 24 scalps, suffered a leg injury after the final and underwent surgery. His 14-month recovery sidelined him from the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, which India lost for the first time in a decade, leaving Bumrah without a dependable bowling partner.""The only thing that worries me is that they play for 10 months a year -- injuries will be much more common,"" the 1983 World Cup-winning skipper said.Asked whether Bumrah would be missed in Champions Trophy, Kapil said: ""Why talk about someone who is not in the team? It's a team game, and the team has to win, not individuals. This is not badminton, tennis, or golf; we are playing a team sport in the Champions Trophy. If we play as a team, we will definitely win,"" said the 66-year-old.""""You never want your main players to get injured, but if it happens, you can't do anything about it. Good luck to my Indian team -- go and play well,"" he added.India will begin their Champions Trophy campaign against Bangladesh in Dubai on February 20.Kapil said he's excited to see so much rising talents in the Indian cricket team these days.""When you see the youngsters, their confidence is unbelievable. We didn't have this much confidence when we were young. Good luck to them.""","World cup-winning captain kapil dev voiced concern over the growing number of injuries among indian cricketers.
