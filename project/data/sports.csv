I told the boys to have good energy and let's see where we are at the end. To have that start with the bat, and someone like Sanju and Tilak taking that tempo was good to see.

Will Sunday’s Buccaneers vs Eagles matchup threaten Baker Mayfield’s winning streak, especially given his and other stars’ injuries?

(Comments via X post on Tampa Bay vs Philadelphia)

The Tampa Bay Buccaneers’ “questionable” status might play mind games with the Philadelphia Eagles

Also Read:

On September 27, NFL Insider Adam Schefter reported on X that three important Tampa Bay Buccaneers players were listed as questionable for Sunday’s matchup against the reigning Super Bowl champions—Philadelphia Eagles: quarterback Baker Mayfield (biceps), wide receiver Chris Godwin (ankle), and left tackle Tristan Wirfs (knee). Schefter added, “All are expected to play.” One fan replied, “Classic 'Questionable but expected to play' mind game! Even if they play, can Mayfield and Wirfs be 100% against that Eagles front?” Another fan countered, “No way they’re missing this one.” The last-minute declaration highlighted doubts about the players’ readiness and Mayfield’s pursuit of another win (fourth to be precise).The Tampa Bay Buccaneers, like the undefeated Philadelphia Eagles, are riding a 3-0 streak into Sunday’s high-stakes showdown. But the momentum faces a real test after NFL Insider Adam Schefter posted the questionable status of three key Tampa Bay players. Instantly, fans flooded social media with their valuable insights. One fan predicted the key players would suit up regardless: “Questionable’ status, but expect them to suit up anyway. ” Another fan said the nagging injuries could disrupt Tampa’s rhythm: “Their availability is crucial, but lingering injuries could still impact Tampa’s execution.”A third fan suggested that minor setbacks could leave the Buccaneers vulnerable against the Eagles' thriving defense: “Even slight limitations could impact execution and expose the Buccaneers to further injury against a strong Eagles defense.”A fan said that the “questionable” tag was only for playing mind games: “Missing Wirfs at left tackle against Philly's front 4 would be brutal, but Mayfield's quick release (2.4s avg) should help. Eagles rush has 12 sacks this year already. Questionable tags playing mind games here.” Another fan speculated that the Buccaneers’ questionable status might be setting the stage for a ready-made excuse if things go south: “Expected to play is NFL-speak for ""We want to make the Eagles plan for them, but we'll see how they feel during warmups. "" 🤫 Will Mayfield's bicep hold up against the Eagles' D-line, or is this just setting up the perfect, high-drama excuse if the Bucs struggle? 🤔 #QBvsPhillyD.” A third fan declared: “They all will play.”","Baker mayfield, chris godwin and tristan wirfs are all listed as ""questionable"" for sunday's game against the philadelphia eagles.

Adele rumored to decline Super Bowl halftime show, but reports say she’s still in talks

Adele’s complicated history with the Super Bowl halftime stage



“The show is not about music,”

“can’t dance.”

The internet is buzzing with claims that Adele has “officially declined” the NFL ’s offer to headline the 2026 Super Bowl halftime show but the truth is a lot murkier. While some outlets are reporting she’s out, others insist she’s still in talks. The conflicting headlines have left fans confused and speculating about whether the Grammy-winning powerhouse will ever grace the biggest stage in sports.Social media lit up this week after several outlets claimed Adele turned down the halftime gig. The report suggests that the singer rejected the offer and it could be because of security concerns, citing fears about being targeted. These reports quickly went viral, fueling the narrative that Adele had walked away from the deal before it was finalized.But not everyone is convinced she’s out. Multiple sources report that Adele is still very much in discussions with the NFL and Roc Nation, which co-produces the halftime show. According to these outlets, talks are ongoing, and nothing has been officially confirmed. For now, it seems Adele’s status remains firmly in the “to be determined” category.This isn’t the first time Adele’s name has been tied to the Super Bowl.Back in 2016, she revealed that she was approached to perform but turned it down, saying she didn’t think the high-energy halftime format suited her style.she said at the time, adding that sheThat refusal is one reason fans are quick to believe fresh rumors about her walking away from the 2026 slot.For football fans and Swifties alike, the 2026 halftime show has been a hot topic. Rumors of Taylor Swift headlining had dominated the conversation earlier this year, only for Adele’s name to surface as the new frontrunner. With Adele now rumored to have declined, speculation is only intensifying about who will eventually take the stage at Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara.Right now, Adele’s Super Bowl status is a mystery. While some outlets say she’s turned it down, others maintain she’s still negotiating. Until either Adele or the NFL makes an official statement, the only certainty is uncertainty. For now, fans will have to wait to see whether the global superstar decides to say yes to the world’s biggest halftime show or pass once again.Also read - Shane Tamura, the man who killed 4 at NFL headquarters, blamed the NFL in his suicide note — now medical examiners confirm he had CTE",Adele is rumored to have turned down the nfl's offer to headline the 2026 super bowl halftime show.

Deep ties of Steelers to Ireland led to Minnesota Vikings vs Pittsburgh Steelers at Croke Park on Sunday

Sunday’s matchup between the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Minnesota Vikings marks the NFL ’s first regular-season game in Ireland’s Croke Park. Speaking at a small music venue near the city center in Dublin on Saturday, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell emphasized the league’s intent to pursue a global presence: “In today’s world, we have to be global. Every time we play an international game, fans say they want more. I really believe our game can be global. Our job is to share our game with the rest of the world.”NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell has further outlined the global strategy, aiming for 16 games to be played internationally—so each NFL team could play at least one international match a year. For example, in February, Sarah Barshop of ESPN reported that the Los Angeles Rams will host a game in Australia during the 2026 season.Goodell said in a statement: “Expanding to Melbourne, Australia, a beautiful city with a rich sports history, underlines our ambitions to become a global sport and accelerate international growth. Together with the Victorian State Government, Visit Victoria and the Melbourne Cricket Ground, and with the Los Angeles Rams in 2026, we look forward to making history in what is an important market for the NFL and a significant next step in expanding our international footprint.On September 27, Brooke Pryor of ESPN reported that after the Australia event, Goodell indicated the NFL’s focus would shift to Asia: “I think our next step after Australia would be probably moving into Asia. That’s a continent we’d like to be playing in.”The Pittsburgh Steelers’ deep ties to Ireland contributed to their participation in Sunday’s game at Croke Park against the Minnesota Vikings.At a music venue near Dublin’s city center on Saturday, Goodell explained that the Steelers actively campaigned for the opportunity to play in Ireland and predicted the event’s success would lead to future returns: “The (Pittsburgh) Steelers were pushing very hard to get the Steelers over here (Ireland). I have no doubt this will be incredibly successful. And I have no doubt we’ll be back.”Steelers Owner and President Art Rooney II, who sat beside Goodell, added, “That’s a fair assessment.” The Rooney family migrated from the island, and the late Dan Rooney was the U.S. Ambassador to Ireland.","Sunday’s matchup between the pittsburgh steelers and the minnesota vikings marks the nfl ’s first regular-season game in ireland.

LeBron James enters 23rd NBA season after Los Angeles Lakers decline extension, forcing him to exercise his player option

LeBron James weighs retirement as L.A. Lakers grant him full control over his farewell journey

The 2025–2026 season will soon begin. Amidst all the excitement, the fresh rumors suggest that LeBron James might be retiring soon. The Los Angeles Lakers allegedly declined to re-sign the star this past summer. James attempted to sign an extension, but his team did not back his initiative during the offseason, according to Bleacher Report's Yaron Weitzman.The Lakers reportedly rejected LeBron James' request for an extension this summer, thus he was forced to exercise his player option. Yaron Weitzman said in the same article that James was reportedly certain that he wanted to extend his contract with the Los Angeles Lakers.Earlier this year, though, things did not turn out as planned. He was allegedly forced to exercise his $52.6 million player option as a result. One NBA source familiar with the situation said:“He obviously wanted an extension, and it's also clear that the Lakers wouldn't give it to him.”The news was further announced on X by Lake Show Yo and read:“LeBron James reportedly wanted an extension from the Lakers, but they weren't interested this summer, forcing him to pick up his player option, per @YaronWeitzman.”The Lakers appear to have made the decision to let James make his own decisions going forward. During a recent press conference, Lakers general manager Rob Pelinka , stated,""The first thing we want to do in terms of LeBron and his future is just give him absolute respect to choose his story with his family in terms of how many years he's going to continue to play.He's earned that right, and he's the best one to talk about that.""Towards the end, Pelinka added,""We would love if LeBron's story would be to retire as a Laker. That would be a positive story.""Having exercised his 2025-2026 player option, the final season of a two-year, $104 million deal with a no-trade clause, the winger will start his 23rd season in the league. The 21-time All-Star guided the Los Angeles Lakers to the third seed in the Western Conference during last season. This news, though, implies that the Lakers might reportedly lose the NBA legend.Meanwhile, Lakers officials have recently referred to LeBron's retirement plans and his future within the organization in a press conference. The comments suggested that LeBron is contemplating the next chapter in his life beyond basketball. Fans and commentators have been talking about this news a lot, with many voicing support and worry for LeBron's possible choice.Although he hasn't made a decision on his retirement date, the Lakers organization has granted him complete autonomy over his last decisions and whether or not he wishes to end his career as a Lakers player. James apparently intends to follow in Kobe Bryant 's footsteps and retire rather than follow in Michael Jordan's footsteps and move out of the team slowly.Bleacher Report's NBA writer Yaron Weitzman interviewed several league executives who are also close to James. They discussed with James the importance of storylines, his desire to avoid a quiet retirement like Michael Jordan, and his expectation of a farewell tour like Kobe Bryant .

The announcement was made by the President of Hockey Operations and General Manager, Kyle Dubas, on Saturday. The Penguins have occasionally assigned their players to the junior squads, such as Quinn Beauchesne and Travis Hayes, but haven’t had a mass cut of players from their 2025 training camp.According to the Penguins, “The following players have been assigned to Wilkes-Barre/Scranton’s training camp (AHL), which begins on Monday, September 29 at the UPMC Lemieux Sports Complex: Raivis Ansons, David Breazeale, Tommy Budnick, Kyle Criscuolo, Brayden Edwards, Zach Gallant, Max Graham, Brent Johnson, Jordan Kaplan, Gabe Klassen, Daniel Laatsch, Brett Murray, Maxim Pavlenko, Emil Pieniniemi, and Zach Urdahl.These players will begin their camp on September 29, 2025, at the UPMC Lemieux Sports Complex.

Fred Warner continues to anchor 49ers defense despite fine



49ers look ahead to Jaguars showdown with Fred Warner leading the charge



Linebacker Fred Warner’s blazing start to the season hit a small bump when the NFL announced a hefty $23,186 fine for a helmet-to-helmet hit in the San Francisco 49ers’ narrow 16-15 victory over the Arizona Cardinals in Week 3. The fine, the largest issued that week, came after Warner tackled Cardinals running back James Conner, an action flagged under the league’s player safety rules.At 28, Fred Warner has grown into the heartbeat of San Francisco’s defense. According to NFL Network’s Tom Pelissero, several defenders were penalized for similar infractions in Week 3, but Warner’s stood out for its size. While the fine won’t lead to suspension, it marked the third of his career and the biggest yet, topping the two he absorbed in the 2024-25 season.The All-Pro linebacker signed a three-year, $63 million extension this offseason, further cementing his role as the team’s defensive cornerstone. Through three games this year, Warner has already tallied 30 tackles, a forced fumble, and a recovery, continuing a trend of consistent production since his arrival as a third-round pick in 2018. His track record speaks for itself: 118-plus tackles in every season, 16 forced fumbles, seven recoveries, and a knack for disrupting passing lanes with 56 passes defended.Warner’s fine might sting financially, but it won’t deter his impact on the field. With Nick Bosa sidelined for the year, Warner’s leadership and playmaking are more critical than ever for the 49ers’ playoff hopes.San Francisco now shifts its focus to a Week 4 clash with the Jacksonville Jaguars. The Jaguars, looking to keep pace in the AFC South, have already sparked headlines after defensive coordinator Robert Saleh suggested the team found a way to read opponents’ signals—a claim head coach Kyle Shanahan later diffused.The storyline only adds spice to a matchup where Warner’s presence will be pivotal. The 49ers are determined to stay unbeaten, and their captain in the middle has shown no signs of slowing down despite the fine.Also Read: Russell Wilson trade rumors explode as report claims Giants quarterback now a prime deadline candidate","49ers’ fred warner fined $23,186 for helmet-to-helmet hit in week 3.

Internet backlash grows as fan community rallies around the child

The Kansas City Chiefs finally found their rhythm in Week 3, defeating the New York Giants 22-9 at MetLife Stadium. But while Patrick Mahomes delivered on the field, it was his gesture after the game that stole headlines—and not in the way fans hoped. A moment meant to celebrate a child turned sour thanks to a viral act now being blasted across the internet.After sealing the win, Patrick Mahomes approached the stands and tried to make a young Chiefs fan’s day unforgettable by handing over his thermal throwing sleeve, a personal piece of gear he uses during cold-weather games. The child, decked out in Kansas City gear, was visibly excited—until the unexpected happened.In a scene that echoed the infamous “Phillies Karen” incident earlier this month, a Giants supporter swiped the sleeve out of the boy’s hands. Video footage captured the child’s reaction, shouting, “You stole that from me!” as the unidentified fan in Giants colors pulled the keepsake away.The clip spread quickly across social media, sparking outrage from football fans everywhere. One user called it “straight clown behavior, stealing from a kid,” while another said bluntly, “Wow, what a loser move.”Though the individual’s face wasn’t caught on camera, the online community has made it clear they won’t let the incident slide.

Russell Wilson benched, but trade market looms



Russell Wilson trade rumors gaining momentum



The New York Giants have turned the page on their 0-3 start by benching veteran quarterback Russell Wilson in favor of rookie Jaxson Dart. Head coach Brian Daboll made the decision after Wilson’s two-interception outing in Sunday’s loss to the Kansas City Chiefs, a performance that highlighted the team’s need for a spark under center. While Wilson has vowed to mentor Dart, his future in New York is suddenly in question.Wilson completed 59.1% of his passes for 778 yards, three touchdowns, and three interceptions across three games. His Week 2 performance against Dallas, where he threw for 450 yards and three scores in an overtime thriller, reminded fans he can still deliver at a high level. But inconsistency and turnovers ultimately pushed the Giants toward Dart.Despite the benching, Wilson has kept a positive outlook. “I know that I'm going to respond in the right way every day,” he said, adding, “I'm not done.” The 36-year-old also dismissed speculation that he would request his release. “No, I'm focused on helping this team win. I wanna be here. I love this organization.”Still, reports from NFL Network insiders Ian Rapoport and Mike Garafolo indicate that Wilson is a strong trade candidate ahead of the Nov.4 deadline. His one-year, $10.5 million deal carries a manageable cap hit, making him a realistic option for quarterback-needy teams. In contrast, fellow trade target Kirk Cousins is attached to a far more expensive contract in Atlanta.Quarterback injuries have already hit contenders across the league, including the Bengals, Vikings, Commanders, and 49ers. Cincinnati in particular may explore its options with Jake Browning starting in place of the injured Joe Burrow. Teams seeking stability could see Wilson’s experience and affordability as the perfect midseason fix.For the Giants, moving Wilson would not leave them exposed. Jameis Winston, a veteran with 87 career starts, is waiting in the wings as the backup to Dart. That depth gives New York the flexibility to consider offers while prioritizing its future.As Week 4 approaches, Wilson’s next snap could very well come in a different uniform. With his proven leadership and affordable contract, he may become one of the most intriguing names on the trade market this fall.Also Read: Ole Miss coach Lane Kiffin’s wife Layla goes viral with bold outfit choice at LSU rivalry game","Russell wilson benched by new york giants, but trade market looms.
