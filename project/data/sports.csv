Deion Sanders’ advice for Travis Hunter as a new dad



Travis Hunter embraces fatherhood and NFL dreams



Travis Hunter is stepping into fatherhood and the NFL at the same time, and one man who has been by his side throughout this journey is Deion Sanders. The Hall of Famer, who once recruited Hunter to Jackson State and later coached him at Colorado, recently shared heartfelt fatherly advice for the Jacksonville Jaguars rookie as he embraces life’s two biggest milestones — becoming a professional athlete and a dad.For Deion Sanders, Travis Hunter has always been more than a player. Their bond goes back to 2021 when Hunter, then the No. 1 recruit in the nation, shocked everyone by committing to Jackson State instead of a powerhouse like Florida State. He later followed Sanders to Colorado, where he won the 2024 Heisman Trophy as a two-way sensation. Through it all, Sanders played a fatherly role, especially during Hunter’s toughest moments.On the night Hunter lifted the Heisman, his biological father was absent due to legal troubles. Sanders stepped in, embracing the young star in what became one of the most emotional moments of Hunter’s career. Years later, when Sanders was quietly battling a bladder cancer scare and couldn’t attend Hunter’s wedding, the rookie showed up at his coach’s Texas ranch, standing by him as the two shared quiet moments fishing together.“Oh my god, I’m taking a deep breath because I love him to life — I love him like he’s my son,” Sanders said. “It’s funny when your son is now a father… it’s a beautiful thing.“The thing that I told him is let’s correct all the things that we think we didn’t receive as children and let’s do that in our fatherhood. No matter what happens, let’s make sure we are the best darn father that ever walked. That’s what I told him. I’m proud of him, I love him to life, and I miss him dearly.”It wasn’t coach-speak. It was a father figure speaking to someone he considers family. And Hunter will also be happy to get some off-field advice from Coach Prime.Travis Hunter, just 22, is now a husband and a father. He and his longtime girlfriend, Leanna Lenee, tied the knot earlier this year before welcoming their first child, a baby boy. In a heartfelt video titled “Dear Son…”, Hunter can be heard saying to his newborn, “Gotta be better than me.”The timing couldn’t be more symbolic. On September 7, Hunter will make his NFL debut when the Jaguars face the Carolina Panthers. It marks the start of two parallel journeys: one on the field as a top draft pick, and one at home as a father. With Sanders’ wisdom and his own determination, Hunter now carries two legacies — as a rising NFL star and as a dad committed to doing things right. Fans and critics will be watching Travis Hunter how he make his debut a dreamy one. he is ready to show what he is capable of and to prove that he is indeed a two-way player and rare.Also Read: Justin Jefferson injury update: Vikings may take cautious approach as hamstring issue raises long-term concerns","Deion sanders gives travis hunter fatherhood guidance.

Wayne Gretzky and the Canadian identity crisis: why the Great One no longer defines hockey,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/wayne-gretzky-and-the-canadian-identity-crisis-why-the-great-one-no-longer-defines-hockey/amp_articleshow/123677192.cms,"Tired of too many ads? go ad free now

Hockey’s cultural landscape has moved beyond one man’s legacy

The Canadian identity crisis goes deeper than Wayne Gretzky’s shadow

Tired of too many ads? go ad free now

For decades, Wayne Gretzky stood as the ultimate symbol of Canadian hockey pride. His dazzling play and unmatched records gave Canada a face in the global sports arena, and his legacy still commands respect. Yet as the game evolves, a cultural shift is forcing Canadians to reconsider whether Gretzky still embodies the sport’s identity.When Gretzky aka The Great One retired, many believed his status as “The Great One” would eternally tie him to Canada’s hockey soul. But today’s NHL reflects a broader, more global identity. Stars like Connor McDavid , Auston Matthews, and Sidney Crosby have taken the torch, while international icons from Sweden, Russia, and the United States increasingly shape the league.Canada’s hockey culture is no longer built solely on a single national figurehead. Instead, it reflects diversity, new styles of play, and a growing international influence. Gretzky’s records still hold weight, but younger generations see him as a legend of the past, not the face of today’s game.The debate isn’t about Gretzky’s greatness, it’s about what he represents. Canada once relied on him to symbolize dominance and unity in hockey. But as the sport evolves, Canadians are confronting uncomfortable questions about their place in a game they no longer exclusively own.Hockey’s growth in non-traditional markets, combined with Canada’s struggles to consistently dominate on the world stage, has fueled this identity crisis. While Gretzky remains the most iconic name in hockey history, he no longer reflects the modern state of the sport or Canada’s role within it.Also read: Wayne Gretzky's daughter Paulina Gretzky turns head in bold gothic look during Italian getaway with Dustin Johnson In the end, Gretzky’s influence will never disappear, but Canada’s hockey identity now extends beyond his shadow.

A surprising choice after a messy Cowboys-Parsons split



Loyalty, convenience, or just love for the game?

The Dallas Cowboys may have moved on from Micah Parsons, but his mother, Sherese Parsons, hasn’t completely let go of the team that drafted her son. Just one week after the Cowboys stunned the football world by trading Parsons to the Green Bay Packers, Sherese was reportedly spotted at Lincoln Financial Field on Thursday night—dressed in Cowboys gear as the team faced the Philadelphia Eagles.Micah Parsons’ departure came after months of friction with Cowboys owner Jerry Jones. The star linebacker, who anchored Dallas’ defense for four seasons, wanted a record-breaking contract extension. When negotiations stalled, he formally requested a trade—a request the Cowboys eventually granted. The move shocked fans across the NFL , especially given Parsons’ role as one of the league’s most dominant defensive players.That backdrop makes Sherese’s appearance in Cowboys colors particularly intriguing. “Does his mom even know it happened?” some fans joked online, pointing out the odd visual of her supporting the very team that just shipped her son away.There could be simpler explanations behind Sherese’s decision. Harrisburg, Pennsylvania—her hometown—is just a couple of hours from Philadelphia, making Thursday’s season opener an easy trip.Her history with the Cowboys is also deeply personal, given her son’s rise to stardom in Dallas. And of course, it may just come down to her genuine love for football.Also Read: “Nobody knows who I am”: Josh Allen opens up about being overshadowed by wife Hailee Steinfeld at global events Whatever the reason, Sherese’s presence adds yet another wrinkle to an already dramatic offseason for both Parsons and the Cowboys.

James Daniels' injury puts Dolphins’ protection of Tua Tagovailoa in doubt



The Miami Dolphins are entering the 2025 NFL season facing significant questions about leadership, roster depth, and injury concerns. After a turbulent offseason marked by surprising trades and new setbacks, the franchise finds itself under pressure to perform. Head coach Mike McDaniel is already on the hot seat, and the situation in Miami seems far from stable.The Dolphins’ offseason has been defined by questionable moves and unfortunate injuries. One of the most notable was the trade of tight end Jonnu Smith, who reportedly wanted to remain in Miami. Losing a veteran offensive weapon leaves quarterback Tua Tagovailoa with fewer options, raising concerns about the team’s offensive consistency heading into the season.Head coach Mike McDaniel, who is coming off his first losing season with the Dolphins, now carries the weight of heightened expectations. Miami failed to make the playoffs last year, and critics have pointed to his leadership as a reason for the team’s underwhelming performance. Entering 2025, McDaniel is widely viewed as one of the coaches most at risk of losing his job if results don’t improve quickly.Beyond coaching, the Dolphins’ culture has drawn criticism.Analysts have highlighted general manager Chris Grier’s struggles to build a reliable offensive line and manage contracts effectively during his nine-year tenure, which has produced no playoff victories. For years, Miami has been seen as a franchise surrounded by drama and instability rather than long-term success.Injuries are another major setback, particularly on the offensive line. The Dolphins’ biggest free-agent signing, James Daniels, suffered an ankle injury during practice this week. His availability for Sunday remains uncertain, but the timing couldn’t be worse. Miami already faced questions about depth up front, and losing Daniels—even temporarily—exposes a weakness that could derail the offense.Also Read: Las Vegas Raiders sign Justin Shorter as Amari Cooper retires, adding depth to wide receiver spot The Dolphins have been warned that their season could be one offensive line injury away from disaster, and Daniels’ setback makes those concerns more real. Whether he recovers quickly or misses significant time will heavily influence Miami’s ability to protect Tagovailoa and establish a strong run game.","The miami dolphins are entering the 2025 nfl season facing significant questions about leadership, roster depth, and injury concerns.

The statement read:

Fans react to NFL Insider Adam Schefter’s X post on Dak Prescott and Jalen Carter’s spitting incident

“Dak basically admitted he spits ‘a thousand times’ a game, how are refs supposed to know the difference between habit and disrespect? If you don’t want the ejection, maybe stop giving opponents ammo to interpret it that way.

Actions matter more than excuses.”

“This is a lot to read this early in the morning, Adam.”

“Very poorly written, but an admission of his spitting first. Makes Dak more dislikeable. Especially his laughing after the incident. He loaded and caused that entire fiasco. Now, I feel sorry for Jalen Carter.”

“He baited him in.”

“You can bet this won’t be the last spitting instance addressed during a game.”

I mean, especially game day, maybe even in general, and something I guess I’m not proud of. But in that case, he was trolling, I guess you could say, trying to mess with (Cowboys RG) Tyler Booker.I was just looking at him. I was right here by the two linemen, and I guess I needed to spit, and I wasn’t going to spit on my lineman, and I just spit ahead. I would say he was back there and was in that sense, and he goes, ‘Are you trying to spit on me?’ At that point, I mean, I felt like he was insulting me.I wouldn’t spit on somebody. ‘I’m damn sure I’m not trying to spit on you.’We’re about to play a game. I’m wondering why you’re trying to mess with the rookie, and so when I stepped through, I actually say the words like, ‘Why the hell would I–’ excuse me, but I’m probably even more colorful. ‘What would I need to spin on you for?’ He just spit on me in that moment, it was more of a surprise than anything. Refs obviously saw it through the flag.I was like, ‘Hell yeah, we get 15 yards to start the game off.’ Didn’t realize he was getting ejected. Unfortunate that he did. He is a hell of a player. It changed our plan and our blocking scheme, as I’ve told you before the week that we’re going to protect against him. So it helped in that manner. I don’t wish for anybody to get out of the game. I’m sure he probably regressed that to some extent.I’m pretty sure he knows that I didn’t try to spit on him or wasn’t even aiming to spit on him. So something that’s probably going to get a lot of coverage and a lot of attention that I feel sorry for him in the sense of, yeah, I mean I know I was excited, each and every one of us are right to kick off the season and the season opener, and hell of a player like that doesn’t even get a chance in the first play.

Raiders sign Justin Shorter to fill Amari Cooper’s vacated WR spot



Justin Shorter’s return could shape Raiders’ WR depth and special teams role in 2025



The Las Vegas Raiders faced an unexpected shakeup on their wide receiver depth chart after veteran Amari Cooper announced his retirement on Thursday, just nine days after re-signing with the team. This sudden move left the Raiders with an open roster spot, which they promptly filled by signing a familiar face: Justin Shorter.Justin Shorter, originally a fifth-round pick by the Buffalo Bills in the 2023 NFL Draft, will now step into Cooper’s vacated role. Shorter’s rookie year with the Bills was derailed by injury, causing him to miss the entire 2023 season. Following a roster cut during last summer’s downsizing, the Raiders added Shorter to their practice squad, giving him a chance to prove his worth.Shorter appeared on the Raiders’ active roster for 10 games in 2024, primarily contributing on special teams. His offensive snaps were limited, though he did record three catches in the preseason this August. Despite limited playing time, the Raiders clearly see potential in Shorter to support the team in multiple ways.Heading into Week 1 against the New England Patriots, Shorter is not expected to see significant offensive action.The Raiders’ first-string wide receiver trio—Jakobi Meyers, Tre Tucker, and Dont’e Thornton—along with rookie Jack Bech, remain ahead of him on the depth chart. However, Shorter’s versatility on special teams could earn him valuable playing time, allowing him to make a case for a more consistent role on the active roster.For the Raiders, adding Shorter ensures they maintain depth at wide receiver after Cooper’s sudden departure. While he may not immediately impact the offense, his familiarity with the team and ability to contribute in multiple areas make him a practical addition.

Caitlin Clark rules herself out after long recovery attempt



Indiana Fever bracing for stretch run without Caitlin Clark



Indiana Fever guard Caitlin Clark confirmed Thursday night that she will not return to the court this year, ending her second WNBA season with just three games left on the schedule. The two-time All-Star and reigning Rookie of the Year had been sidelined since mid-July with a right groin injury and later suffered a bone bruise that slowed her recovery. Her announcement is a major blow to the Fever, who are still fighting for the league’s final playoff spot.Caitlin Clark shared the difficult news directly with fans on social media. “I had hoped to share a better update, but I will not be returning to play this season,” she wrote on X. “I spent hours in the gym every day with the singular goal of getting back out there, disappointed isn’t a big enough word to describe how I am feeling. I want to thank everyone who had my back through all the uncertainty.”The 23-year-old guard said the support from Fever fans kept her motivated despite setbacks. “This has been incredibly frustrating, but even in the bad, there is good. The way the fans continued to show up for me, and for the Fever, brought me so much joy and important perspective.I am so proud of how this team has only gotten stronger through adversity this year. Now it’s time to close out the season and claim our spot in the playoffs. ”Clark averaged 16.5 points, 8.8 assists, and 5 rebounds across 13 games before her season ended. She had looked close to returning earlier this week, taking part in light drills, but contact work never followed.Fever general manager Amber Cox acknowledged the timing made a comeback impossible. “Caitlin has worked so hard throughout this time, doing everything possible to recover and return to the court but, ultimately, time is not on our side,” Cox said in a statement.Cox continued, “while we will continue working with Caitlin and provide her with every resource we have available, there is not enough time left in our season for her to safely return, and her long-term health and well-being remains our top priority. We are looking forward to having her back at full strength to start the 2026 season.”Also Read: Anthony Edwards receives words of caution from Miami Heat legend Dwyane Wade ahead of 2025-26 NBA season Clark’s absence adds to a brutal injury list for Indiana, with multiple guards already out for the year.

Deanna Favre’s stunned response shows how quietly Parkinson’s disease strikes



Brett Favre’s NFL career puts spotlight on the hidden cost of toughness

Brett Favre and Deanna Favre face the future with strength and resilience

When Brett Favre stepped to testify in Washington, D.C., during the Mississippi welfare funds case in September 2024, the focus was expected to be legal questions. Instead, the Green Bay Packers icon revealed something far more personal: he had been diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease earlier that year.The Hall of Fame quarterback, now 55, explained that doctors confirmed the condition in January 2024 after he had struggled with unusual stiffness in his right arm. Everyday tasks became difficult, even something as simple as turning a screwdriver. For someone once known for unmatched durability, it was a startling admission. “It’s been an ordeal,” Brett Favre said, adding that the diagnosis had reshaped how he thought about the years ahead.At home, the moment was no less heavy. When Brett Favre first told his wife, Deanna Favre, she was stunned. He recalled her asking what made him seek medical advice, since she hadn’t noticed alarming symptoms herself. Her reaction showed just how quietly Parkinson’s can creep in, often without visible signs until it is undeniable.The couple has faced battles before. Deanna Favre fought breast cancer in 2004 and went on to start the Deanna Favre Hope Foundation.But this time, the challenge was shared and it struck a chord with fans who saw not just a football legend but a husband and wife staring down another life-altering fight.Brett Favre has not hidden his belief about where the disease may have started. Over a 20-year NFL career, he absorbed thousands of hits. Known for his toughness, he started 297 straight regular-season games, or 321 including playoffs, for the Green Bay Packers, New York Jets, and Minnesota Vikings.That streak set him apart as one of football’s toughest competitors, but it also left scars. Favre has openly estimated that he may have sustained more than a thousand concussions. He has been outspoken about how the NFL once minimized head trauma, treating concussions as little more than “getting your bell rung.” His comments have reignited debate about whether enough was done to protect players during his era, raising questions that stretch well beyond one man’s story.By the middle of 2025, Brett Favre acknowledged that what weighed on him most was the unpredictability of Parkinson’s. He admitted that not knowing how fast the disease might advance left him uneasy, calling the uncertainty the toughest part of it all. For Deanna Favre, whose own strength was tested years earlier during her battle with breast cancer, standing with her husband now reflects a shared resilience that goes well beyond the football field. Together, the Favres are facing a challenge that no championship or record streak could prepare them for a reminder that behind the fame and the victories are very human struggles.Also read : Travis Kelce breaks his silence on retirement as Patrick Mahomes makes a subtle dig at his weight loss ahead of the Chiefs' match against the LA Chargers","Brett favre revealed in 2024 that he had been diagnosed with parkinson's disease.
