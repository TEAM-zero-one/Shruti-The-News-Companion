After his retirement, Shaun White has still been a talk of the town in the Olympic circles. Twenty years after winning gold as a teenager in Italy, the American icon returned for the 2026 Milano-Cortina Winter Olympics in a new role. NBC tapped him as an expert commentator and co-host for the Opening Ceremony at San Siro Stadium in Milan. The five-time Olympian retired after the 2022 Beijing Winter Games, where he finished fourth in his final run.White built a career that redefined snowboarding. He won three Olympic gold medals, all in the halfpipe, and became the most decorated snowboarder in Olympic history. He also owns 15 X Games gold medals and 23 total podium finishes. His astonishing legacy is now reflected in his media presence as he views the games with experienced eyes.Shaun White’s career after retirement from competition is still exciting. At the 2026 Games, he embraced life beyond the halfpipe. ""This is all an exciting time for me, from announcing and being a part of the Olympics in this new way,"" White told Olympics.com.""I am excited to take it all in. See the different events like ice skating, skiing, half pipe, big air, obviously snowboarding.I'm just going try to see everything honestly, that's my goal.""He even set a playful target. ""I'm trying to get Snoop,"" White said. ""Snoop on a snowboard is my goal. We need him on the board, and I'm going to try to do that.""White has expanded his influence through business and sport. He founded The Snow League in 2024, aiming to elevate professional snowboarding and freeskiing.At the 2006 Torino Games, he recovered from a poor first run to post a 46.8 in the final and win gold at 19. In Vancouver 2010, he secured victory on his first run and turned the second into a celebratory lap featuring a double McTwist 1260. After missing the podium in Sochi, he returned in 2018 with back to back 1440s to claim his third gold.His road to PyeongChang included a severe crash in 2017. Across five Olympics, he became the face of snowboarding and helped carry it into the mainstream.Shaun White’s personal life drew attention when he and actress Nina Dobrev ended their engagement in September 2025 after five years together. The couple had announced their engagement in October 2024.Dobrev later spoke about taking her time with marriage. ""I really want to enjoy it and not rush that process,"" she told E! News. ""We're just enjoying being engaged at this point and being in that sort of phase because a lot of your life is—you have a boyfriend for half of your life and then you have a husband for half of your life, but the fiancé period is very short.""It appears that the duo moved on with their personal lives.","Shaun white won three olympic gold medals, all in the halfpipe, and became the most decorated snowboarder in olympic history.

Will BTS Take Over From Bad Bunny? Inside the Real Race for the 2027 Super Bowl Halftime Show,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/will-bts-take-over-from-bad-bunny-inside-the-real-race-for-the-2027-super-bowl-halftime-show/articleshow/128263522.cms,"From BTS to Taylor Swift to Jay-Z, the race to replace Bad Bunny at Super Bowl LXI is already messier than the game itself. (Image via Getty)

BTS and a full K-Pop moment are the loudest early demand

Taylor Swift and Justin Bieber give the NFL the safe nuclear option

Jay-Z and a Roc Nation flex would turn halftime into a power play

So who actually feels most likely to follow Bad Bunny right now?

A BTS-led K-Pop takeover, with BLACKPINK and others, if the NFL decides it has to chase young global viewers at all costs.



A Swift or Bieber headliner if the league wants maximum reach with minimum political headache.



A Jay-Z or Pharrell-and-friends show if Roc Nation wants to turn SoFi into an industry summit.

Bad Bunny just blew up Super Bowl LX. His Apple Music halftime show at Levi’s Stadium pulled record TV and streaming numbers, sparked a week of political outrage and turned 12 minutes of Spanish-language music into the story of the night.Now the league and Roc Nation have to find someone to walk into that fire next. Super Bowl LXI lands at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, Calif., on Feb. 14, 2027, and every outlet from Billboard to SB Nation and Complex is already throwing darts at the board.Billboard’s fan poll is not a Vegas line, but it shows where the online hunger is. In that poll, BTS sit north of 80% of the vote, with BLACKPINK, Taylor Swift, Morgan Wallen, Post Malone, Harry Styles, Miley Cyrus, Justin Bieber, Drake, Lil Wayne and Jay-Z all miles behind.That lines up with SB Nation’s idea of an outright K-Pop ode at SoFi. Their writers floated BTS anchoring the show, with BLACKPINK on a reunion run and even a fictional band from K-Pop Demon Hunters dropped into the mix.If the NFL decides the only way to top Bad Bunny’s global reach is to lean straight into Korean pop and TikTok culture, this is the move. It is risky for a league that still treats anything non-English like a science experiment, but it is also the clearest path to numbers that look bigger than 2026.SB Nation’s first two names are Taylor Swift and Justin Bieber, for a reason. Roger Goodell has already said the league would welcome Swift at halftime, and the math is obvious: if you want the broadest possible audience, you call the woman who just rewired the touring economy.The hold-up is not demand, it is timing. Swift told Jimmy Fallon in 2025 that she is not eager to build halftime choreography while Travis Kelce is still getting hit every week, and that concern has not magically disappeared. Until she says otherwise, Swift feels like the league’s dream, not its plan.Justin Bieber is different. He just crushed a Grammys performance, sits among the top global streamers and has more than 15 years of hits to stitch into a 12-minute medley. With the Super Bowl falling on Valentine’s Day in 2027, a Bieber-heavy pop set full of stadium sing-alongs is the kind of “nobody gets mad at this” choice the NFL loves.Complex’s early list leans into something more political: a Jay-Z moment. Hov has overseen the halftime era that ran from Shakira and Jennifer Lopez to Rihanna and now Bad Bunny. At Super Bowl LX, he even walked the field in a hoodie that read “The game needs me.”Letting him finally take the stage in Los Angeles would double as a victory lap for Roc Nation and a way to quiet fans who still see the partnership as corporate damage control. A Jay-Z show also opens the door to a Pharrell-style friends set, which Complex floated as another option, stacking guests like The Weeknd or Drake around one producer’s catalogue.It would not match the chaos of Bad Bunny’s political staging, but it would send a clear message about who really calls the shots on Super Bowl Sunday.If you strip away fan wars and stan polls, a few lanes stand out in mid-February 2026:Public betting and prediction markets are already tossing out names like Bieber, Chappell Roan and others, but as of today there is no official decision from the league.","Super bowl lxi lands at sofi stadium in inglewood, calif. on feb. 14, 2027.

200-plus totals for India in T20WC

NEW DELHI: India once again underlined why they are regarded as the most destructive batting unit in the shortest format, riding on blistering half-centuries from Ishan Kishan and Hardik Pandya to post a formidable 209/9 against Namibia in their Group A clash of the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2026 at the Arun Jaitley Stadium on Thursday.Kishan set the tone with a breathtaking 61 off just 24 deliveries, mixing brute force with clean timing as he dismantled Namibia’s pace attack in the powerplay. His innings, studded with crisp boundaries and towering sixes, powered India to a staggering 104/1 in just seven overs. Pandya then took over the mantle, striking a muscular 52 off 28 balls, ensuring India maintained momentum despite losing wickets at regular intervals later in the innings.Namibia, however, found a way to pull things back through their skipper Gerhard Erasmus, who delivered a remarkable spell of unorthodox slingy bowling. Erasmus finished with career-best figures of 4/20, using variations and subtle changes in pace to choke the Indian batters on a surface that offered some grip to the spinners. Alongside Bernard Scholtz, Erasmus applied the brakes through the middle overs, forcing India into errors as they attempted to sustain the scoring rate.Although Pandya staged a late counter-attack to bring up his half-century, India lost five wickets in the final two overs, allowing Namibia to claw back some respectability. From a position where India looked set to breach 220 comfortably, Namibia would take heart from restricting the damage to just over 200.With this innings, India extended their tally of 200-plus scores in Men’s T20 Internationals to 47 — the most by any team. South Africa trail with 29 such totals, followed by New Zealand (28), while Australia and West Indies are joint fourth with 25 each.India’s recent scoring spree has been even more emphatic. Since the T20 World Cup 2024, they have registered 14 totals of 200 or more in T20Is, double the number managed by any other side in the same period. The consistency highlights the depth and fearlessness of India’s batting approach.In T20 World Cup history too, India’s ability to cross the 200-run mark has been a recurring theme. Their notable tallies include 218/4 against England in Durban in 2007, 210/2 versus Afghanistan in Abu Dhabi in 2021, 205/5 against Australia in Gros Islet in 2024, and now 209/9 against Namibia in Delhi in 2026.47 - India29 - South Africa28 - New Zealand25 - Australia25 - West Indies218/4 vs ENG, Durban, 2007210/2 vs AFG, Abu Dhabi, 2021209/9 vs NAM, Delhi, 2026205/5 vs AUS, Gros Islet, 2024","Since the t20 world cup 2024, india have registered 14 totals of 200 or more in t20is.

T20 World Cup | Sahibzada Farhan on India vs Pakistan matches: 'Not one-sided'

NEW DELHI: Former India captain Rohit Sharma has warned Team India not to take their high-profile T20 World Cup 2026 clash against Pakistan lightly, even though they are favourites on paper.India face Pakistan on February 15 at the R. Premadasa Stadium in Colombo, and Rohit believes past records or rankings won’t matter once the match starts.India have dominated Pakistan in T20 World Cups and recent T20Is, but Rohit stressed that cricket can be unpredictable and every team can win on its day.Speaking at an event in Dubai, he said, “Firstly I never believed in this word called favourites. It’s such a funny game, and we’ve seen it now there’s so much that has happened in this last 10 years of international cricket. All these teams have so much exposure now playing T20 cricket.""You can’t just go and think that it’s a two-point victory for us. You just have to play good cricket on that particular day to achieve those points otherwise you might end up going home without anything.”He added that current form, reputation or history won’t guarantee success.According to Rohit, the key is performing on the day of the match, because any team can beat another in T20 cricket.“So it’s not about what you’ve done in the past, what is your team like, players are in form or not form. You just have to play well on that particular day because every team is capable of beating any team on that particular day,” he said.India have lost only once to Pakistan in World Cups, in the 2021 T20 World Cup, and have beaten them in their last five T20I meetings.",Rohit sharma warns team india ahead of t20 world cup clash against pakistan.

Poll Do you think Abhishek Sharma will be fit to play against Pakistan? Yes, he will be fit No, he won't be ready

NEW DELHI: India’s preparations for the high-voltage T20 World Cup clash against Pakistan have been dominated by one burning question — will Abhishek Sharma be fit in time? Conflicting updates from teammates and captain have only added to the intrigue ahead of Sunday’s marquee encounter.Spinner Varun Chakravarthy struck an optimistic note after India’s win over Namibia, revealing that the explosive opener could be on track for a comeback. “As far as I have spoken to him he looks good, he did some practice today also. He told me he is on the way,” Varun said, hinting at a possible return.However, skipper Suryakumar Yadav painted a more cautious picture. Abhishek, who was hospitalised earlier this week with a stomach infection, is still regaining strength after being discharged. “Abhishek isn’t fine still, might take one or two games,” Surya admitted, suggesting the team would prioritise his full recovery.The attacking left-hander missed the Namibia clash, where Sanju Samson partnered Ishan Kishan at the top of the order. Even as the team trained at the Arun Jaitley Stadium, Abhishek did not join full sessions, with reports indicating weakness and slight weight loss following the illness.Team management is expected to make a final call after monitoring his workload during training in Colombo. Traditionally, Abhishek spends long hours batting in nets and that endurance test could determine whether he is ready for the pressure of an India-Pakistan showdown.For now, India appear caught between hope and caution: Varun’s upbeat “he is on the way” versus Suryakumar’s realistic “might take one or two games” assessment.",Abhishek sharma was hospitalised earlier this week with a stomach infection.

Anthony Joshua honours Sina Ghami and Latif Ayodele after tragic Nigeria crash

Anthony Joshua is known for his strength inside the boxing ring. But this time, the two-time heavyweight champion showed his pain outside it. The British star has paid an emotional tribute to his two close friends, Sina Ghami and Latif “Latz” Ayodele, who died in a tragic car crash in Nigeria in December. Joshua himself narrowly survived the same accident.To honour them, the 36-year-old had their names tattooed on his right arm at a London tattoo studio, placing the words “LATZ” and “SINA” under his famous Africa outline tattoo. The moment quickly touched fans around the world and reminded many of the deep bond he shared with the two men who supported his career and life.The tattoo was first revealed by Fulham Tattoo London on Instagram. The studio shared photos and wrote, “Huge thank you to two-time heavyweight champion of the world Anthony Joshua for unexpectedly and unannounced walking through the door a few weeks ago for his first visit with us at Fulham Tattoo London… what a walk in!” The post confirmed the tribute and showed how personal the visit was.Joshua had travelled to Nigeria after knocking out Jake Paul in Miami. Although he was born in Watford, his family roots are Nigerian, and the trip was meant to be a happy return home.Sadly, everything changed when the car carrying Ghami and Ayodele hit a stationary truck near Lagos, leading to their deaths. Ghami worked as Joshua’s strength and conditioning coach, while Ayodele was his personal trainer and close friend.After receiving hospital care, Joshua returned to England for the funeral.

Team Canada again proved why they remain the favorites to win gold



Canada left no doubt about its gold medal credentials on Thursday. Jon Cooper's squad dismantled Czechia 5-0 in its opening game of the 2026 Winter Olympics, with contributions across all four lines, showcasing depth and skill at Milano Santagiulia Ice Hockey Arena.The tone was set before the first intermission when Macklin Celebrini tipped a Cale Makar blast from the blue line past Lukas Dostal with just 5.7 seconds remaining in the period. At 19 years old, Celebrini became the youngest Canadian NHLer ever to score a goal at the Olympics. But that was just the start for the side.Canada entered the tournament with a chip on its shoulder, and Celebrini made sure they lived up to the stakes. While the Czechs controlled the game in the first period, the Sharks’ youngster ensured his side had the lead by the end of the period.Meanwhile, Connor McDavid finished with three assists and a game-high six shots on goal, recording the first Olympic points of his career. Captain Sidney Crosby added two assists as he closed the gap between himself and Jarome Iginla for the most points by a Canadian at the Olympics.Thomas Harley led all skaters with 20 minutes and 35 seconds of ice time and chipped in two helpers of his own.After a competitive opening 20 minutes where shots were tied 11-11, Canada seized control in the second period.Mitch Marner made a spectacular individual play along the left wall, driving to the net and sliding a pass across the crease while falling over a sprawled David Spacek. Mark Stone was waiting at the far post for the easy tap-in to make it 2-0.Bo Horvat put the game out of reach minutes later, taking a feed from Brad Marchand at full speed through the neutral zone before going in alone and beating Dostal through the five-hole. Canada outshot Czechia 36-26 and won 55 percent of faceoffs in the lopsided victory.The third period belonged to Canada's stars. Nathan MacKinnon scored on the power play just 13 seconds after Dominik Kubalik was called for interference, finishing off a sequence that moved from Makar to Crosby to McDavid before reaching his stick.Nick Suzuki capped the scoring by redirecting a McDavid pass from point-blank range to complete the rout. The lone concern for Canada was defenseman Josh Morrissey, who left early in the second period and did not return.Shea Theodore slid into his spot alongside Colton Parayko. No injury replacement can be added now that the tournament has started.

‘Terrifying’ Olympic Ski Star Lindsey Vonn’s Crash Seen In Shocking Photos

Quote of the day:

I'm never tired of winning, and I'm never tired of skiing.""

NEW DELHI: The words echo with the fierce determination that has defined one of alpine skiing’s greatest champions.For Lindsey Vonn , winning has never just been about medals, it has been about resilience, comeback, and an unrelenting hunger to push boundaries.Just days after a devastating crash at the Milan Cortina Games, Vonn delivered another powerful reminder of her mindset, updating fans from her hospital bed after undergoing a “successful” third surgery on her broken left leg.“I had my 3rd surgery today and it was successful. Success today has a completely different meaning than it did a few days ago,” Vonn wrote on Instagram, sharing photos of herself giving a thumbs-up with a metal frame stabilising her leg. “I’m making progress and while it is slow, I know I’ll be ok.”Earlier this month, during the Winter Olympics, the 41-year-old skiing legend crashed just 13 seconds into her downhill run and was airlifted off the course, later revealing a complex tibia fracture that would require multiple surgeries.The setback came just nine days after she ruptured the ACL in the same knee yet another chapter in a career marked by extraordinary highs and punishing injuries.Vonn’s comeback story had already captivated fans worldwide.After nearly six years of retirement, she returned to competitive skiing in December 2024 following knee surgery earlier that year.Heading into the Olympics, she was in sensational form, winning two downhills, finishing on the podium in seven of eight World Cup races, and proving she could still dominate the speed events.Doctors noted that her injury required external fixation, a technique used to stabilise severe fractures, but Vonn’s spirit remained unbroken.Surrounded by family and flooded with messages of support, she thanked medical staff, friends, and fans, while also cheering on her Team USA teammates from her hospital room.Billie Jean King hailed her as “Forever the champion,” while Allyson Felix sent messages of love and encouragement.Teammates called her “the baddest there is,” reflecting the respect she commands across the sporting world.“I’m never tired of winning” may sound like a simple statement, but in Vonn’s journey, it represents far more than trophies. It symbolises an athlete who refuses to surrender—to injury, to age, or to doubt.","Lindsey vonn updates fans from her hospital bed after undergoing a “successful’ third surgery on her broken left leg.

I have all the faith in the world in him, and I know our team does. You still have to go out there and perform, and he did just that.""The player exhibited exceptional skill and talent, particularly during the first period, when he faced 11 shots and made a couple of key saves on Tomas Hertl (Vegas Golden Knights) and another on David Pastrnak (Boston Bruins) when the game was tight.Interestingly, this match was Binnington’s first international game after scoring 31 saves in a 3-2 overtime win over the United States in the championship of the 4 Nations Face-Off.",Jordan binnington recorded a 26-save shutout in his olympic debut against czechia.

Lilah Fear and Lewis Gibson react emotionally after costly free dance error at Winter Olympics

Auld Lang Syne

I’m Gonna Be (500 Miles)

Lilah Fear stood on the Olympic ice with dreams of a historic medal for Team GB. But within moments, everything changed. The 26-year-old ice dancer became emotional after a small mistake during the free dance routine ended the pair’s medal hopes at the Winter Olympics. Skating with partner Lewis Gibson, Fear later admitted she was in shock and struggling to understand what had happened.The British duo had been performing strongly and were placed fourth after the rhythm dance. That position kept them close to a podium finish and raised hopes across Team GB. However, an error early in the free dance brought negative scores from judges and pushed them down to seventh place overall. The sudden fall in the standings left Fear tearful during interviews as she tried to process the moment and the lost opportunity for an Olympic medal.Fear spoke honestly after the routine and did not hide her disappointment. She said, “I can’t believe it happened. I’m replaying it in my head and it’s just such a shame. I don’t really have the words yet. It will take me some time to process. I can’t believe I just did that. I feel so bad, I’m devastated. I’m in shock. It’s such a shame because I know what we’re capable of. I just feel so bad.”The pair had hoped to become the first Team GB ice skaters to win an Olympic medal since Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean took bronze in 1994. Their Scottish-themed free dance included music such asand. But during a rotation, Fear lost balance, and the technical mistake proved costly.Reflecting on the moment, Fear explained, “Just a really costly technical mistake, which was tough very early in the programme because I knew that we kinda lost bronze at that point. But I also really wanted to not let the Olympic experience just disappear because of that. It’s not what we’ve trained, and it was costly and devastating.”Gibson also shared his feelings, saying, “When you don’t perform the way you want to, on any day, it’s tough to take but at the Olympic Games, it’s even harder. I think we’ll look back at this one day and learn from it. We do that at every event. We’ll just move forward.”Despite the disappointment, the pair’s strong journey to the Olympics and their honest reaction showed courage in a painful moment on sport’s biggest stage.",Lilah fear and lewis gibson had hoped to become the first team gb ice skaters to win an olympic medal since jayne torvill and christopher dean took bronze in 1994.

Luc Tardif hopes for Russian return but will follow IOC rules



The men's Olympic hockey tournament is underway in Milan without two of the sport's traditional powers. Russia and Belarus remain banned from international competition due to their involvement in the war in Ukraine, leaving a significant hole in what is supposed to be a best-on-best showcase.IIHF president Luc Tardif addressed the situation at a press conference on Thursday alongside NHL commissioner Gary Bettman and NHLPA executive director Marty Walsh. Tardif made clear where the federation stands on the matter.""We want as soon as possible the Belarusians and the Russians back,"" Tardif said. ""Because first, it will mean that the world will be a little bit better. But we follow the recommendation of the IOC."" The absence of Russian players is particularly notable given their recent Olympic success.The Russians made it to back-to-back finals in the last two editions. While the 2018 PyeongChang games got them the gold, the 2022 edition in Beijing brought them a Silver as the team remains one of the most dominant sides in the sport.But that dominance didn’t last for long, as in 2022 the IOC banned both Russia and Belarus following the former’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.While some athletes from both nations can compete as Individual Neutral Athletes in other sports after rigorous vetting, hockey's team format makes that pathway impossible.The IOC's March 2023 recommendation stated that ""a group of Individual Neutral Athletes cannot be considered a team."" The IIHF confirmed it would follow that guidance, effectively shutting the door on Russian and Belarusian hockey participation through at least the 2025-26 season.Tardif's comments reflect the IIHF's position throughout the ban. The federation has consistently maintained that it follows IOC directives rather than making independent decisions on Russian and Belarusian participation.The Russian Olympic Committee was suspended by the IOC in October 2023 for recognizing regional Olympic councils in Russian-occupied regions of Ukraine. That suspension remains in effect, and the IOC has shown no indication of lifting sanctions while the war continues.For now, the 12-team Olympic tournament proceeds without nations that have combined to win three of the last four Olympic hockey medals. The press conference came on Day 2 of the men's tournament, which features Canada, the United States, Finland, Sweden, and Czechia.","Iihf president luc tardif addressed the situation at a press conference on thursday.
