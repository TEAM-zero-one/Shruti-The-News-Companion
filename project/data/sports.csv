NEW DELHI: India are set to face New Zealand in a bid to win the Champions Trophy after a 12-year hiatus, confronting their historical difficulty in overcoming the resilient Kiwis in ICC tournaments, where New Zealand leads with a 10-6 record and a 3-1 advantage in knockout matches.Despite criticisms regarding India's extended preparation time in Dubai, such arguments are diminished as New Zealand is also well-acquainted with the conditions. India's strategy likely involves leveraging their spin quartet, which has proven effective on the Dubai International Cricket Stadium pitch, against New Zealand's batting lineup.Spinners Varun Chakravarthy, Kuldeep Yadav, Ravindra Jadeja, and Axar Patel have been key in India's bowling success, potentially challenging New Zealand's top batters, including Kane Williamson and Rachin Ravindra.New Zealand's spinners, however, have previously succeeded against India and aim to replicate that performance. The match also carries emotional weight for India, with veterans Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma potentially playing in one of their final ICC tournaments.Kohli's recent form includes a century and two fifties, while Sharma aims to contribute more significantly. India hopes for impactful performances from the rest of the team, including vice-captain Shubman Gill, Shreyas Iyer, KL Rahul, and Hardik Pandya, to secure a collective victory.This final presents an opportunity for both teams to claim the ICC ODI title, with India looking to add to their trophy cabinet and New Zealand seeking their first since 2000.The match will be live-streamed on JioHotstar and broadcast on Star Sports Network.The match is scheduled to begin at 2:30 pm IST, while the toss will take place at 2 pm on March 9, Sunday.Rohit Sharma(c), Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer, Axar Patel, KL Rahul(w), Hardik Pandya, Ravindra Jadeja, Mohammed Shami, Kuldeep Yadav, Varun Chakaravarthy, Washington Sundar, Arshdeep Singh, Harshit Rana, Rishabh PantWill Young, Rachin Ravindra, Kane Williamson, Daryl Mitchell, Tom Latham(w), Glenn Phillips, Michael Bracewell, Mitchell Santner(c), Matt Henry, Kyle Jamieson, William ORourke, Nathan Smith, Mark Chapman, Devon Conway, Jacob Duffy","India face new zealand in the champions trophy final.

Team India gears up for Champions Trophy final with practice in Dubai

'Rohit Sharma-led Team India will clinch the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 title': Astrologer Greenstone Lobo's huge prediction

New Zealand are working on aspects of their game that they feel India may look to exploit when the two teams meet in Dubai on Sunday for the ICC Champions Trophy final , and the Kiwi plans have been laid bare by a net bowler.India started using a four-pronged spin attack from the third game onwards in the group stage of the tournament. Incidentally, that match was against New Zealand, who could only score 205 in response to India's 249 and succumbed to the pressure exerted by the spinners.To prepare for that eventuality once again, the Kiwi batters are training specifically to counter spin, which was revealed to ANI by net bowler Shashwat Tiwari.According to the report, Tiwari said the New Zealanders are probably wary of the threat by Indian spinners, who played a key role in beating New Zealand in the group fixture as well as Australia in the semi-finals.Mystery spinner Varun Chakravarthy took seven wickets in those two matches, including a five-for (5 for 42) against the Kiwis.""They are preparing for left-armers,"" Tiwari told ANI. ""I won't say they are struggling. Of course, our Indian team has top-class spinners, but I don't think they will be able to cope with them.""India have the old war horse Ravindra Jadeja, Axar Patel and Kuldeep Yadav as their three left-arm spinners. Chakravarthy and Washington Sundar are the other two spinners in the squad.""Today, I fortunately got to bowl (in the nets),"" Tiwari said further.""At one point in time, he (name not revealed in the ANI report) asked me to bowl from 18 yards just to prepare for Ravindra Jadeja. It is because of the kind of pace he (Jadeja) has. He was expecting that kind of speed. We (net bowlers) bowled from that point, and we did it nicely. But when he realised the ball was coming too quickly, he asked me to bowl from 22 yards,"" Tiwari added.India topped Group A by winning all three matches and went on to beat Australia by four wickets in the semifinal. New Zealand, meanwhile, defeated South Africa by 50 runs in the other semifinal.",Net bowler shashwat tiwari says new zealand are working on ways to counter india's spinners.

NEW DELHI: India etched their name in the history books once again, clinching their third ICC Champions Trophy title after a composed run chase against New Zealand in the final at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium on Sunday.Chasing 252, the Men in Blue showcased poise and precision, wrapping up the target in style to cap off an unbeaten campaign.With this triumph, India have now surpassed Australia in the elite list of multi-time winners, having previously won the title in 2002 (shared with Sri Lanka) and 2013 (defeated England in the final).The victory also marks redemption after their runner-up finish in 2017 and adds another prestigious ICC trophy to their collection.This edition of the Champions Trophy had its share of drama and upsets, particularly for the host nation Pakistan, who endured a forgettable tournament.Losses to both New Zealand and India in the group stage, followed by New Zealand’s win over Bangladesh, meant Pakistan were eliminated before the knockouts, becoming the third host nation — after India (2006) and South Africa (2009) — to crash out in the group stage.India’s 2025 win not only adds another feather to their glittering ICC cap but also underscores their dominance in white-ball cricket.With this title, they affirm their status as a powerhouse across formats and end the Champions Trophy on a perfect note.","India beat new zealand by eight wickets to win the champions trophy 2025.

Toronto Maple Leafs have suffered three consecutive losses, highlighting the impact of costly mistakes against elite competition, particularly against top contenders like the Colorado Avalanche and Vegas Golden Knights. The Leafs' recent loss against the Colorado Avalanche resulted in a loss of 4-2, and head coach Craig Berube emphasized the need for the team to improve its play in the Atlantic Division standings.The Toronto Maple Leafs are learning the hard way—mistakes against elite opponents have a hefty price tag. Playing powerhouse clubs such as the Colorado Avalanche and Vegas Golden Knights, even small errors can have huge repercussions.Coming off a humiliating 7-4 loss to Colorado on Saturday while blowing a 4-2 lead, Toronto has now dropped three in a row. Lapses in critical moments, breakdowns in head-scratching ways, and inconsistency have all been the top offenders in its recent woes.As the fight for the Atlantic Division tightens, Head Coach Craig Berube did not hesitate in his postgame comments to emphasize the necessity for his team to tighten its execution and shed avoidable errors. ""It’s just mistakes for me,” said Berube. “It’s a tough place to come in and play, and when you can hold a lead going into the third, we’re right there to shut it down. Just gotta clean up the mistakes.""The bench boss acknowledged that mistakes can be detrimental against top-tier teams like Colorado and Vegas, who dominated the Leafs in a 5-2 loss earlier this week. “We gotta stop making mistakes because they capitalize on them,” Berube added.“They’re good teams, they’re good players. We did a good job against MacKinnon tonight. I know he got the power-play goal, but we need more guys to step up and do a job. The mistakes gotta go; they have to get cleaned up because that’s what’s costing us right now, these last two games. It’s just mistakes.”The Leafs had a one-goal lead in the third period against the Avalanche, but Colorado scored twice in under five minutes, taking control of the game. Toronto was under constant pressure, getting outshot 27-11 after two periods.

Inside Brad Marchand's Contract Negotiation Struggles

It was true that the Boston Bruins were facing a shocking change: after many years, Brad Marchand was brought up in the trade to the Florida Panthers. It proved to be an uproar not just for the fans who really adored this leader and fan favorite but perhaps more so for his teammates, particularly David Pastrnak. He narrated how emotionally challenging it has been ever since their 4-nil victory against the Tampa Bay Lightning and how it had been greatly affected, just like other changes to the roster. However, Marchand's announcement would make headlines everywhere. Meanwhile, NHL insider Elliotte Friedman revealed how exactly such critical details regarding the contract talks eventually brought about Marchand's exit.Although Pastrnak was excited about possibly making up for all the roster changes brought up by the trade, it meant much more than an adjustment to his current roster: losing his buddy. ""It's just tough, emotional, and sad,"" the star forward said. That might make it particularly hard to be traded with such former players as Coyle, Carlo, Frederic, and Brazeau.""Not only did we lose leaders on this team, but also great human beings, guys with families that I was really close to. I've been here since day one with them, so it was a really tough day yesterday."" Pastrnak admitted.Even so, he showed in the above case how serious the emotional spectrum was by saying that he had even doubted whether the trade would apply because he thought he would work on it. But he added that minds should be put forward on this issue. ""We're still professional hockey players, and we have a job to do. We have to get our mindset right, look forward, and focus on what's ahead,"" he stressed.However much it hurts, Pastrnak says he is still confident that his side will stay competitive with the right effort, which the guys have shown recently.Elliotte Friedman shed light on the behind-the-scenes contract talks that ultimately led to Marchand's departure. ""No.1, I think Bruins and the player had agreed on term, 3-years, but as Don Sweeney said yesterday, there is a gap, there is a gap on AAV.” Friedman said.Unfortunately, the divide in money proved astronomically difficult to traverse. Although Marchand requested an in-person meeting with management to search for some common ground, no agreement was reached. Consequently, the veteran forward was left feeling bitter, as he had wanted to finish his career as a Bruin.Also Read : ""One of the best players"": Boston Bruins shares heartfelt farewell message to Brad Marchand following his trade to the Panthers Brad Marchand's trade is signaling the end of an era for the Boston Bruins as thousands of fans and players live with this event's impact.

The Los Angeles Lakers aren’t just a basketball team—they’re a dynasty. For decades, they’ve produced some of the sport’s biggest icons, players who didn’t just dominate on the court but built incredible wealth beyond it. From Magic Johnson ’s billion-dollar empire to LeBron James ’ game-changing investments, Lakers legends have proven that success isn’t just about championships—it’s about legacy.Some, like Shaquille O’Neal, turned their larger-than-life personalities into media stardom. Others, like Luol Deng, quietly built financial empires through smart investments. And then there’s Magic, whose business acumen transformed him into one of the richest athletes in history. Let’s take a closer look at these legends, their journeys, and how they turned Lakers fame into financial powerhouses. Pau Gasol isn’t just a Lakers legend—he’s an international basketball icon. With a net worth of $120 million as of 2025, according to Celebrity Net Worth, the Spanish big man made his mark both on and off the court. A six-time All-Star, Gasol played for multiple teams, but his most memorable years came in Lakers gold and purple. Traded to LA in 2008, he became the perfect frontcourt partner for Kobe Bryant , helping the team secure back-to-back championships in 2009 and 2010.Over his 18-year NBA career, Gasol earned $225 million in salary, peaking at $19 million per season. Off the court, he secured endorsement deals with Nike, Adidas, and Banco Popular, and made strategic real estate investments. Beyond the NBA, he led Spain to multiple Olympic medals and a FIBA World Cup title, cementing his place in basketball history. Anthony Davis ’ dominance on the court has translated into serious financial success. With a net worth of $160 million as of 2025, per Celebrity Net Worth, Davis has built his fortune through massive contracts, endorsements, and smart investments. Drafted first overall by the New Orleans Pelicans in 2012, he quickly established himself as one of the league’s best big men before joining LeBron James on the Lakers in 2019. Their partnership led to a championship in 2020.His dominance earned him a $190 million contract in 2020, followed by a $186 million extension in 2023, bringing his salary to a staggering $62 million per year. In February 2025, Davis was traded to the Dallas Mavericks in a blockbuster deal for Luka Doncic .Off the court, Davis has endorsement deals with Nike, Ruffles, and First Entertainment Credit Union, and owns a $31 million Los Angeles mansion. His ability to dominate both in business and basketball makes him a force to be reckoned with. Luol Deng may not have been the flashiest player, but his financial acumen has made him one of the wealthiest former Lakers. With a net worth of $200 million, per Celebrity Net Worth, Deng built his fortune through lucrative NBA contracts, endorsements, and an impressive real estate portfolio.Drafted seventh overall in 2004, Deng was a two-time All-Star with the Chicago Bulls before playing for the Cavaliers, Heat, Lakers, and Timberwolves. His most lucrative contract came in 2016 when the Lakers signed him to a four-year, $72 million deal. Over his 15-year career, Deng earned $166 million in salary.Off the court, he invested heavily in real estate, amassing a $125 million portfolio that includes hotels, resorts, and apartment complexes. His financial success proves that smart decisions can be just as valuable as a killer jump shot. Russell Westbrook has never been the type to go halfway—on the court or with his money. With a net worth of $375 million as of 2025 per Celebrity Net Worth, he’s built his fortune through massive contracts, big-name endorsements, and some smart real estate moves.Drafted fourth overall in 2008, Westbrook became the face of the Oklahoma City Thunder, racking up triple-doubles and winning MVP in 2017. He later played for the Rockets, Wizards, Lakers, and Clippers before signing with the Denver Nuggets in 2024.His biggest contract was a five-year, $205 million extension in 2017—once the largest deal in NBA history. With over $350 million in career earnings and endorsements from Jordan Brand (worth up to $200 million), Pepsi, and more, Westbrook has turned his explosive playing style into a financial empire. His real estate portfolio includes luxury properties in Los Angeles and Oklahoma, proving his investments are as smart as his game. Shaquille O’Neal isn’t just one of the greatest centers in NBA history—he’s a business mogul. With a net worth of $500 million, per Celebrity Net Worth, Shaq turned his on-court dominance into a multi-faceted empire.After being drafted first overall in 1992, he became a household name with the Lakers, leading them to three consecutive championships from 2000 to 2002 alongside Kobe Bryant. But basketball was just the beginning.Shaq has earned over $800 million from endorsements, investments, and media ventures. From Reebok to Papa John’s, Google to real estate, his portfolio is diverse and ever-growing. Even in retirement, he earns an estimated $60 million annually, proving that true legends never stop winning. LeBron James made history by becoming the first active NBA player to reach billionaire status. With a net worth of $1.2 billion (as of 2025), according to Forbes, his wealth stems from his playing career, endorsements, and strategic investments.Since being drafted first overall in 2003, LeBron has dominated the NBA, winning titles with the Heat, Cavaliers, and Lakers. His Lakers contracts alone have surpassed $200 million, with an annual salary over $45 million.Off the court, he’s earned over $900 million through endorsements including a lifetime Nike deal, business ventures like his stake in Fenway Sports Group, and investments in Blaze Pizza and SpringHill Entertainment. Unlike most athletes, LeBron takes equity in brands he promotes, ensuring long-term wealth. Magic Johnson isn’t just a basketball legend—he’s a business icon. With a net worth of $1.6 billion as of 2025, per Forbes, Magic transformed his earnings into a financial empire.Though he made roughly $40 million during his Lakers career, his real success came after retirement. Instead of relying solely on endorsements, Magic built his fortune through high-value investments. His biggest asset is a 60% stake in EquiTrust, a life insurance firm managing $26 billion in assets.He also owns stakes in the Dodgers (MLB), Commanders (NFL), LAFC (MLS), and Sparks (WNBA). Through Magic Johnson Enterprises, he invested in Starbucks franchises, real estate, and urban development, cementing his legacy beyond the court.The Lakers have always been about more than just basketball. These legends didn’t just leave their mark on the game—they built legacies that extend far beyond it. Whether it’s Gasol giving back to his home country, LeBron creating opportunities for future generations, or Magic revolutionizing business, these players prove that true greatness isn’t just about money—it’s about impact.Also Read: NBA Offseason Rumors: Los Angeles Lakers could sign $35 million Chicago Bulls guard to support Luka Doncic and LeBron James in their Championship Run And as the next generation of Lakers stars rise, one thing is certain: greatness doesn’t stop at the final buzzer.

The Suns have only two players confirmed out: Monte Morris (back) and Cody Martin (abdomen).The Mavericks, on the other hand, are grappling with a lengthy injury list, including Kyrie Irving, who is out for the season with a knee injury. This could give the Suns an edge, especially if Durant is cleared to play. Phoenix’s offense, led by Devin Booker’s 26.0 points per game, ranks 14th in the league, but their defense has struggled, allowing 116.5 points per contest (24th in the NBA). Durant’s presence on the court could be pivotal in tightening their defensive efforts and boosting their scoring output.Durant’s ability to stretch the floor with his 2.6 three-pointers per game adds another layer to the Phoenix Suns’ offensive strategy. His shooting efficiency, combined with Booker’s playmaking, makes Phoenix a formidable opponent when both are healthy. However, the team’s rebounding struggles (26th in the league) could be a concern against a Mavericks squad that, despite injuries, has shown resilience.Also read: Will Devin Booker play tonight against the Dallas Mavericks?

The Phoenix Suns are set to face the Dallas Mavericks on Sunday, March 9, at the American Airlines Center, but all eyes are on Devin Booker’s status as the team prepares for the crucial matchup. Booker, the Suns’ leading scorer averaging 26.0 points per game (ninth in the NBA), has been a pivotal force for Phoenix this season. However, concerns about his health have surfaced ahead of the game.According to the latest injury report, Devin Booker is not listed among the Suns’ injured players, which currently includes Monte Morris (out, back) and Cody Martin (out, abdomen). This suggests Booker is expected to play, providing a significant boost for Phoenix as they aim to improve their 29-34 record.Booker’s recent performances have been stellar, averaging 25.4 points, 4.1 rebounds, and 7.1 assists over the last 20 games. His ability to score from beyond the arc, making 2.7 three-pointers per game, has been crucial for the Suns’ offense. With Kevin Durant and Bradley Beal also in the mix, Booker’s presence on the court is vital for Phoenix to compete against a Mavericks team dealing with its own injury woes.The Dallas Mavericks , sitting at 32-32, will be without Kyrie Irving (out for the season, knee) and several other key players, including Jaden Hardy (ankle) and Anthony Davis (groin). This could give the Suns an edge, especially if Devin Booker remains healthy and continues his high-level play.The game tips off at 3:30 p.m. ET and will be broadcast on ABC and ESPN+. Fans can also stream the matchup on Fubo, though regional restrictions may apply.As the Suns look to climb the standings, Devin Booker’s health will be a determining factor in their success.

+King James is down! Forget the drama of Hollywood; this is real-life suspense. LeBron James , the man who seemingly defies Father Time, has hit pause, clutching his groin like he just saw a ghost. And not just any ghost, but the ghost of Christmas past, 2018, when a similar injury sidelined him for weeks. Cue the dramatic music! So, what's the verdict? Shams Charania, the NBA's resident oracle, has spoken: for 1-2 weeks.That’s the official timeline, but let’s be real, in the world of sports injuries, “official” is about as reliable as a weather forecast in a hurricane. LeBron himself, ever the pragmatist, acknowledged the chilling flashback to his 2018 ordeal.Thankfully, no ""pop"" this time, just a strain. A collective sigh of relief echoed across Laker Nation, followed by the frantic knocking on wood, courtesy of LeBron himself, to ward off any jinxes. But let's cut to the chase: what does this mean for the Lakers ? They've been on a roll, finally finding their rhythm and climbing the Western Conference ladder. Now, with their leader sidelined, it’s panic stations, right? Not quite. This is where the supporting cast gets its chance to shine. All eyes turn to Luka Doncic, who has the potential to carry the team on his back. Other players must step up as well.This injury, though concerning, could be a blessing in disguise. A forced rest for the King could mean a fresher, more potent LeBron come playoff time. Think of it as a strategic power nap before the real battle begins. But let’s not sugarcoat it, the Lakers’ climb just got steeper. Every game becomes a test of their depth and resilience. Can they weather the storm without their captain? Can Luka and the rest fill the massive void?ALSO READ: After Los Angeles Lakers Loss Luka Doncic Reacts to LeBron’s Injury: Cold-Hearted or Just Honest? Ultimately, the severity of this injury will be measured by how the Lakers navigate these next few weeks. One thing’s for sure: the NBA just got a whole lot more interesting.

Mikko Rantanen's NHL career has been a rollercoaster, with him being a part of the Colorado Avalanche and then being involved in numerous trades and contracts. He signed with the Carolina Hurricanes in a three-team deal in January, and then was offered by the Dallas Stars, making him an unbeatable offer.Scott Oake, from Hockey Night In Canada, interviewed the Dallas Star's Mikko Rantanen, discussing the details of his trade. Oake asked why he chose Dallas, given his position as the prize deadline catch and his options.“Mikko, you were the prize deadline catch and you had options. Why Dallas?”, asked Oake. Without hesitation, Rantanen replied, “Well, I just know how good the team is. Obviously, I like the whole setup they have and I played against them a lot. I obviously knew some guys from before and yeah, just a really good team overall.”Rantanen also opened up about his decision to leave Colorado Avalanche, “I think it was last week, I just, obviously it was a shock and they didn’t want it to happen at that time and then I just had to look at all the options… the guys were great and the team is really good but, it’s just, I had to look at it from all the angles and this was my decision.”When asked about the explosive possibilities, he further said, “Well, yeah, I think, you know, three good players so hopefully we can get on the same page… or I just have to talk to them as much as I can and try to get the chemistry going as quickly as possible.”With the signing of Mikko Rantanen, the Dallas Stars (41-19-2) believe they possess the firepower necessary to make a deep playoff run and contend for the Stanley Cup this year. The team has been playing well, sitting second in the Central Division, eight points behind the Winnipeg Jets as of Saturday.Also Read: “Disguising Don Sweeney”: Bruins fans thrashed the team's GM for trading their captain, Brad Marchand Rantanen has been the offense's chief contributor for most of the season, with his high-level scoring and playmaking skills on full display. As a member of the Colorado Avalanche, he notched a career-high 64 points in the form of 25 goals and 39 assists on 49 games. Since being traded midseason to the Carolina Hurricanes, he's remained a contributor with six points in the form of two goals and four assists over 13 games. Now, as he joins a solid Dallas team, the Stars expect his skill and experience to take their championship hopes to a higher level.","Mikko rantanen was traded from the colorado avalanche to the dallas stars last week.

The Los Angeles Lakers are making strategic moves as they gear up for the playoffs, with reports indicating that Jordan Goodwin ’s two-way contract will soon be converted into a standard NBA deal. This decision comes as the team continues its impressive run, winning seven straight games and 18 of their last 21. To make room for Goodwin, the Lakers are likely to waive either Cam Reddish or Alex Len, with Reddish being the more probable candidate.Jordan Goodwin, a 26-year-old guard, has quickly become a valuable asset for the Los Angeles Lakers since joining the team in early February. Over eight games, he has averaged 6.1 points, 3.8 rebounds, and 1.0 assist in 16.9 minutes per game. Goodwin's achievements have not gone unnoticed, even though a recent ailment to his right ankle has slowed his progress. He has received numerous compliments from head coach JJ Redick, who has referred to him as a vital rotation player.Jovan Buha of The Athletic reports that in order to optimize financial flexibility, the Los Angeles Lakers are anticipated to convert Goodwin's deal as late as feasible. ""I do expect him to be converted at the end of the season as late as possible, and then be on the playoff roster. ... He's kind of become the 9th man, and you could argue that depending on the night and depending on the matchup, he should be like the 8th man,"" Buha said on his podcast . He also hinted at a potential multi-year deal for Goodwin in the future, stating, ""I think he's going to get a multi-year contract, longer-term later in the season.""Jordan Goodwin’s journey to the Lakers began after they waived Armel Traore to open a roster spot. A four-year NBA veteran, he has previously played for Washington, Phoenix, and Memphis, holding career averages of 6.4 points, 3.8 rebounds, and 2.6 assists across 128 games. His versatility and defensive prowess have made him a reliable option off the bench.Also read: NBA Buyout Rumors: Los Angeles Lakers could bag $33 million ex-Toronton Raptors star to bolster squad's defensive end As the Los Angeles Lakers continue their push for playoff success, the decision to convert Jordan Goodwin’s contract reflects their commitment to strengthening their roster.

"NBA Offseason Rumors: Los Angeles Lakers might make a move for $107 million Toronto Raptors star guard, parting ways with Dalton Knecht?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/nba-offseason-rumors-los-angeles-lakers-might-make-a-move-for-107-million-toronto-raptors-star-guard-parting-ways-with-dalton-knecht/articleshow/118770265.cms,"Dalton Knecht and Luka Doncic (Image via Jayne Kamin-Oncea-Imagn Images)

""Knecht would be a great addition for Toronto,""

""His three-point shooting addresses a key need, and his ability to play multiple positions offers flexibility. If he improves defensively and becomes more consistent on offense, he could become a solid contributor for a championship contender.""

""With the Toronto Raptors envisioning a frontcourt of Scottie Barnes and newly extended Brandon Ingram along with former lottery pick Gradey Dick at shooting guard, where does that leave current leading scorer RJ Barrett’s future?""

""Based on conversations before the deadline, RJ Barrett could be a trade candidate to monitor this summer.""

The Los Angeles Lakers are reportedly considering a bold move this summer to bolster their roster, potentially trading rookie forward Dalton Knecht to acquire former New York Knicks star RJ Barrett from the Toronto Raptors . This comes as the Lakers continue to ride the wave of success following their acquisition of Luka Doncic , who has been instrumental in their recent seven-game winning streak, propelling them to a 39-21 record and the No. 2 seed in the Western Conference. Luka Doncic ’s partnership with LeBron James has been a game-changer for the Los Angeles Lakers , driving their offense to a No. 12 ranking with a 117.3 offensive rating over the last seven games. However, their defensive performance has been equally impressive, boasting a league-leading 106.2 defensive rating during the same stretch. This resurgence has sparked speculation that the Lakers might be willing to part ways with Knecht to secure a proven talent like RJ Barrett.Heavy Sports' David Grubb noted.The Los Angeles Lakers previously attempted to trade Knecht during the deadline in a deal for Charlotte Hornets center Mark Williams, which ultimately fell through. This time, they could package Knecht, along with Gabe Vincent and Jarred Vanderbilt’s salaries, and draft capital to pursue RJ Barrett. The Raptors, who are reportedly open to moving Barrett, might find this offer appealing as they look to reshape their roster around Scottie Barnes and Brandon Ingram.HoopsHype’s Michael Scotto questioned.Barrett, who was traded to Toronto from the Knicks during the 2023-24 season, has been a consistent performer, averaging 21.7 points, 6.4 rebounds, and 5.7 assists in 49 games this season. His versatility and scoring ability make him an attractive target for the Los Angeles Lakers, who could see him as a perfect fit alongside Luka Doncic and James.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Los Angele Lakers might reunite with $3 million shooting guard before playoffs to support LeBron James and Luka Doncic As the offseason approaches, the Lakers’ pursuit of RJ Barrett could signal their commitment to building a championship-caliber team for the 2025-26 season.
