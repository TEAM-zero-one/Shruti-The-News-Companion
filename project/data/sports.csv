Urban elite can't monopolise sports infrastructure: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/urban-elite-cant-monopolise-sports-infrastructure-sc/articleshow/124022613.cms,"The Supreme Court

NEW DELHI: Counting sports facilities as community resources, Supreme Court has said these cannot be concentrated in the hands of the rich and elite in urban areas even though many youngsters from poor rural backgrounds have stormed into the national sporting arena by the dint of their talent and resolve.While finalising the constitution of All India Football Federation on Friday, a bench of Justices P S Narasimha and Joymalya Bagchi said, ""It is also necessary to ensure that sporting facilities and opportunities are not concentrated in the hands of the urban economic elite, and that the revenues from sporting events, intellectual property and media rights are so distributed to subserve and encourage accessible and affordable sport in our country. ""Writing the judgment, Justice Narasimha said the time is ripe to recognise that sporting ""facilities and opportunities"" are ""material resources of the community"", and the regulating bodies of different sports as ""the institutions of national life"".""As 'places of public resort', sporting institutions and bodies must remain accessible, not just for pursuing sport, but also for its administration. It should be the deeper Sadhana (endeavour) of the State, and it is also our Constitutional duty to ensure sporting facilities and opportunities flourish with institutional efficiency, integrity, professionalism, and expertise,"" he said.The bench said SC is the repository of the Constitution and the enforcer of citizen's fundamental rights. However, it said through a judicial fiat it cannot create fraternity, an avowed objective of the Constitution apart from justice (social, economic, political), liberty (of thought, expression, belief, faith and worship), and equality (of status and opportunity). ""Unlike rights that can be enforced through law, fraternity is not amenable to judicial command; it must be nurtured through lived experiences of unity, trust, and shared endeavour. National, international, regional or even mohalla sports in India serve as the 'Karmabhumi' where cohesion and collective purpose take tangible form. They bring together individuals from diverse social, linguistic, and cultural backgrounds under a common pursuit, embodying the Constitutional value of fraternity. Here, individual and collective aspirations find a way to coalesce.""",Justices p s narasimha and joymalya bagchi said these cannot be concentrated in the hands of the rich and elite in urban areas.

Charlie Kirk’s assassination has shocked the world and now, his old controversial comments about Taylor Swift have resurfaced. While Taylor Swift has remained silent about it, Charlie Kirk’s wife and his business partner, Erika Kirk, has dragged in the billionaire pop star into the drama again. This has sparked outrage among fans.A few hours ago, right wing podcast host and an employee of Charlie Kirk’s organisation, Turning Point USA, Alex Clark made a post on X that read as, ""Last night Erika gave us specific direction: 'I want the Taylor Swift concert to look like nothing compared to this.' As a Swiftie I know what that means and what the challenge is. Buy your flights. Let’s go…”Erika Kirk and Turning Point USA are planning an event on 21st September to celebrate the life that Charlie Kirk had led, until his shocking assassination last week.Turning Point made a post on X about the event that read as, ""Join us in celebrating the remarkable life and enduring legacy of Charlie Kirk, an American legend.

Who is Chelsea Wolfe: Past controversies, clashes with US cycling and Olympic journey

Chelsea Wolfe, a transgender BMX freestyle rider from Florida, is facing huge backlash after celebrating the murder of Charlie Kirk. On September 10, 2025, Charlie Kirk, the 31-year-old conservative activist, was shot and killed while giving a speech at Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah. Soon after the news broke, Chelsea Wolfe, who was an alternate rider for Team USA at the Tokyo 2021 Olympics, shared several Instagram stories. One post showed a USA Today headline on Kirk’s death with a cartoon image of Dora the Explorer and the words, “We did it!” She also shared a selfie giving a thumbs up and called Kirk a “Nazi.”Chelsea Wolfe’s reaction shocked many across the country. In one post, she wrote:In another story, she compared Kirk again to a Nazi, saying:The posts drew swift attention. Sports figures, activists, and fans called her words “sickening” and “violent.” USA Cycling released a statement on September 12, 2025, making clear that Wolfe no longer represents them.Jennifer Sey, founder of XX-XY Athletics, told the Daily Mail it was not surprising to see Wolfe celebrate Kirk’s assassination.She said Wolfe has a long history of calling opponents “Nazis” and pushing dangerous rhetoric.Chelsea Wolfe, born May 5, 1993, in Lake Park, Florida, started BMX at the age of six and later transitioned as a teenager. She made history in June 2021 by qualifying as the first openly transgender athlete for Team USA at the Tokyo Olympics, where she was listed as an alternate in women’s BMX freestyle.But Wolfe has long courted controversy. Back in 2021, she wrote on Facebook: “My goal is to win the Olympics so I can burn a US flag on the podium.” In interviews with Fox News, she later said she did not hate the country but wanted to stand against “fascism.”Also Read: Andre Agassi And Steffi Graf’s Son Jaden Agassi Shares Unseen Photos With Catherine Holt As Couple Celebrates Love Her BMX career ended in July 2023 when the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) banned transgender women from competing in women’s events.Chelsea Wolfe admitted the rule change left her heartbroken and said she was on “suicide watch” during that time. She has since moved into fixed-gear cycling, where protests have continued against her inclusion in women’s races.","Controversial past of team usa transgender cyclist uncovered after twisted celebration of charlie kirk’s assassination.

Jordon Hudson’s presence at UNC games



Bill Belichick faces rocky start with Jordon Hudson by his side



Bill Belichick’s transition to college football has been anything but smooth, and on Saturday, it was his girlfriend Jordon Hudson who once again drew attention. Dressed in a striking blue snake-print miniskirt, knee-high boots, and a white off-the-shoulder top, Hudson was spotted cheering for the coach before North Carolina’s 34-9 loss to UCF. Later, she was seen in the tunnel giving Belichick a pep talk after the deflating defeat.Hudson has been impossible to miss since the season began. From sparkly Tar Heels-blue pants at the opener to her headline-making sideline appearances, she has become a consistent talking point in Chapel Hill. The former cheerleader and beauty queen is also no stranger to going viral. Earlier this year, she made waves online when she balanced on Belichick’s hands and feet during a yoga stunt on spring break.On Saturday, however, her role seemed more personal than performative. As the 73-year-old coach walked off the field with his head down, Hudson was waiting to lift his spirits. Her visible support has many wondering if her presence has become a bigger story than the Tar Heels’ struggles on the field.Belichick’s first college season after six Super Bowl titles with the New England Patriots has started on shaky ground.The Tar Heels have yet to find their rhythm, and critics say it could be a long season ahead. Still, Hudson appears ready to stand by him through every high and low.UNC confirmed her involvement beyond the sidelines as well. ""Jordon will continue to manage all activities related to Coach Belichick’s personal brand outside of his responsibilities for Carolina Football and the University,"" the school said.With Clemson up next after a bye week, all eyes will again be on Belichick—and just as likely, on Hudson. For now, the headlines surrounding UNC football seem to belong less to the scoreboard and more to the coach’s high-profile partner.Also Read: Tom Brady’s Fox Sports contract still can’t match Gisele Bündchen’s massive fortune","Bill belichick's girlfriend, jordon hudson, has been a constant presence at unc games.

NFL issues warning: No protection for players joining Tom Brady’s Saudi flag football game,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/nfl-issues-warning-no-protection-for-players-joining-tom-bradys-saudi-flag-football-game/articleshow/124022729.cms,"The NFL has cautioned players about participating in Tom Brady's flag football event in Saudi Arabia. The league clarifies it does not endorse the event. Player injuries during the event will not receive NFL benefits. Star players like Saquon Barkley and Rob Gronkowski are expected to participate. This raises concerns about career risks versus global sport promotion.

NFL warns players of consequences without league backing

Star power adds intrigue, but risks loom large

The NFL has sent a clear message to its players: think twice before stepping onto the field for Tom Brady’s upcoming flag football showcase in Saudi Arabia. Despite the excitement surrounding the March 2026 event, the league is distancing itself from the exhibition, warning players that participation carries risks outside official protections.According to a memo circulated to all 32 teams, the NFL emphasized that it “will not be part of Saudi exhibition game” and reminded organizations that player involvement requires written approval. The league clarified, “This Event is not an NFL-sanctioned event, and the league has no role in the organization or production of the game.”More critically, the statement highlighted that “any injury sustained while participating in the Event will be considered a Non-Football Injury.” In plain terms, this means no salary protection, no insurance coverage, and no team responsibility if a star player gets hurt while competing. For athletes whose livelihoods depend on their health, that’s a high-stakes gamble.Still, the roster Brady has assembled is hard to ignore. Saquon Barkley, Christian McCaffrey, CeeDee Lamb, Maxx Crosby, Sauce Gardner, Myles Garrett, George Kittle, Fred Warner, and Rob Gronkowski are among the headliners expected to play.The event mirrors the Olympic-style format set to debut at the 2028 Los Angeles Games, adding to its prestige and appeal.For many players, the Saudi tournament represents more than an exhibition—it’s a chance to grow the sport globally and share the field with icons in a lighter, faster-paced version of football. Yet the NFL’s firm stance introduces a sobering reality: athletes may have to weigh personal ambition against career security.Also Read: Controversial Josh Allen kneeldown sparks Dolphins–NFL discussions, Mike McDaniel believes ball was fumbled With Brady and Gronk bringing their star power back into the spotlight, fans are eager to see history in the making.

1587 Prime: A new Kansas City dining experience



It was a stylish night out for Patrick Mahomes and his wife, Brittany, as the couple enjoyed an intimate evening at Kansas City’s newest hotspot, 1587 Prime. The steakhouse, co-owned by the Chiefs quarterback and his teammate Travis Kelce , has quickly become the talk of the town.

She wore a chic denim minidress with a slim belt, matching heels, and a black handbag, while Patrick, also 30, kept it bold in a striped Louis Vuitton shirt, dark pants, and sneakers. The outing gave the couple a rare evening away from their three children — Sterling, 4, Bronze, 2, and Golden, just 8 months old.The evening held extra meaning, as the steakhouse had officially opened its doors on Sept. 17, aligning with Patrick’s 30th birthday. Days earlier, the couple had already marked the milestone with friends after the Chiefs’ home game. Guests included country star Kane Brown, his wife Katelyn, Travis Kelce, and Taylor Swift , who all posed together inside the elegant space.Brittany shared a heartfelt tribute to her husband on Instagram, writing, “Happy 30th Birthday!!! You are so special to us, and we love you to forever and beyond!” She added, “The way you love us is so comforting, and the way you go about life is just so inspiring! Keep being YOU 🤍.”The steakhouse isn’t just another upscale eatery. Its name pays homage to Mahomes’ and Kelce’s jersey numbers, 15 and 87. The menu highlights classic favorites, including steaks, lobster tails, wild king salmon, and chicken parmesan, while the cocktail list adds a playful twist. Drinks like “Showtime” and “The Big Yeti” nod to the star athletes’ nicknames, while “Queen B” and “Alchemy” give a toast to Brittany and Taylor Swift.With its blend of fine dining, celebrity buzz, and personal touches, 1587 Prime has already become more than a restaurant.

Pakistan:

Skipper Suryakumar Yadav will depend heavily on his spin troika as India gear up for another intense and tense Super 4 face-off against Pakistan in the Asia Cup 2025 on Sunday. The stakes are high, not just because of the rivalry, but also due to lingering tension from last Sunday’s match, when India’s players opted not to shake hands with their rivals — a move that has dominated headlines and added an unusual edge to the contest.India’s lineup appears well-balanced, with Suryakumar expected to anchor the innings, while Jasprit Bumrah and Varun Chakravarthy return to the playing XI after being rested in the previous inconsequential game. Kuldeep Yadav, Axar Patel, and Varun Chakravarthy will carry the responsibility of tilting the game in India’s favour with their spin, especially on the slow Dubai International Cricket Stadium surface. Fielding coach T Dilip has allayed concerns about Axar’s head injury, but in case he is unfit, replacements like Washington Sundar or Riyan Parag remain options.Pakistan, on the other hand, face a thin batting lineup. Opener Saim Ayub has struggled for form, while Shaheen Shah Afridi has been the standout performer. Fakhar Zaman remains Pakistan’s most reliable batter, but their middle order continues to appear fragile.Fast bowler Haris Rauf may return after a strong showing against the UAE. The contest promises high tension both on and off the field, with India likely to stick to their handshakes policy amid the ongoing narrative.21 September 20258 PMDubai International Cricket StadiumMatches will be broadcast on Sony Sports Network, with SonyLIV providing live streaming on app and website.Super Four matches, including India vs Pakistan, will be available on Willow TV, starting at 10:30 AM EST.Viewers can watch via Sky Sports Cricket, Sky Sports Main Event, and Sky Sports Ultra HDR, with coverage starting at 3:00 PM BST and match kick-off at 3:30 PM BST.

“Go ahead and paint your nails” — Cam Newton slams Caleb Williams for letting style distract from winning,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/go-ahead-and-paint-your-nails-cam-newton-slams-caleb-williams-for-letting-style-distract-from-winning/articleshow/124009585.cms,"Caleb Williams of the Chicago Bears warms up prior to the game against the Detroit Lions (Image Source - Getty Images)

Caleb Williams struggles in second NFL season with Chicago Bears

Cam Newton CALLS OUT Caleb Williams: ""Focus on WINNING, Not Nails""

Cam Newton urges Caleb Williams to focus on winning instead of media distractions

Another take from Cam Newton, the former NFL quarterback, was aimed at Chicago Bears quarterback Caleb Williams. He pointed out that Williams is letting off-field distractions, like the talk about his painted nails, get in the way of his game focus. This was shared on Newton's podcast, where he highlighted that performance should take precedence over personal flair, particularly given the Bears' rough start to the season.Caleb Williams is recognized for his distinctive personal style, which includes painting his nails as a way to express himself. In April 2024, just before joining the league, Williams received criticism for this practice, with some doubting its appropriateness for a quarterback.During that period, Cam Newton came to Williams' defense on the ""Club Shay Shay"" podcast, saying, ""I guarantee if he paint his nails pink, and he go out there and ball, ain't nobody gonna say nothing about the pink,"". However, by September 2025, with Williams in his second NFL season and the Bears starting 0-2, Newton's tone shifted.The Bears' 2025 season started off rough with losses to their divisional foes: they fell to the Minnesota Vikings in Week 1 after leading in the first half but not being able to finish strong in the second.Then, in Week 2, they got crushed by the Detroit Lions in a 52-something blowout, as their defense struggled to contain the scoring.Williams' personal stats for these games show a passer rating under 90, a completion percentage of 61.5%, a passing success rate of 39.4%, and he has taken six sacks. The team, which finished with a 5-12 record in 2024, is now led by new head coach Ben Johnson. He has openly criticized the team's practice performance, pointing out that while problems like missed assignments can be corrected, they need improved focus.This shaky start has heightened the conversations surrounding Williams, particularly his style choices, sparking talks about whether these factors divert attention from his performance on the field. The criticism peaked in the episode of Newton's podcast ""4th&1 with Cam Newton"" titled ""Caleb Williams keeps going VIRAL for all the WRONG REASONS!"", released on YouTube on September 19, 2025, featuring guests Adam ""Pacman"" Jones and Reshad Jones.Newton was telling Williams to focus on winning instead of chatting with the media about stuff that isn't football. Newton, who used to be the MVP and quarterback for the Carolina Panthers, started his podcast ""4th&1"" to keep players accountable, as he mentioned in the episode, ""The reason why I created fourth and one is to hold everybody accountable."".Newton specifically told Williams, via the podcast, ""If that's what it takes for him to go out there and win football games, go ahead and paint your nails, my boy."" However, he added, ""Well, he's not winning. I think that's the problem. Why? If he was going out there and dominating, who gives a sh*t what color he's painting his nails, right?"" This illustrates Newton's perspective that quarterbacks should have to justify their unique traits with their performance, similar to how Tom Brady can get away with it because of his regular wins.Guest Adam ""Pacman"" Jones echoed this, saying, ""Any quarterback with nails on suck. ... I don't want my quarterback with no nails on your personal time."" Newton also suggested to Williams that he should ""pass on"" media chances regarding his nails, mentioning, ""Keep the main thing the main thing. And the main thing for you as a quarterback in your situation is winning. ... All that is all distractions if you're not winning. "" He warned that without wins, optics suffer: ""You’ve got a quarterback that’s worried about getting the French tip more than getting the ball over the goal line. ... The optics don’t look good.""Newton mentioned certain games, sharing with Williams, ""You played in a winnable first half versus the Minnesota Vikings. And where was all the execution and focus in the second half? You lost that game. Hey, you just played a division foe in the Detroit Lions. They put up a 52 Ray Lewis on you."" The term ""52 Ray Lewis"" probably refers to the Lions putting up 52 points, referencing the iconic jersey number of the legendary defender Ray Lewis to highlight the defensive effort.Also Read: “You should not be that gifted” — Colin Cowherd praises Buffalo Bills QB Josh Allen’s unstoppable 2025 form As the Bears gear up for Week 3 against the Dallas Cowboys, who have racked up 60 points in their first two games, the pressure is on to steer clear of an 0-3 start—this would be the second time since 2023. Williams' nail art, done for Week 1 by the same artist who worked with WNBA star Angel Reese, keeps sparking viral conversations, but Newton's point stands: winning on the field is what really matters.","Caleb williams is recognized for his distinctive personal style, which includes painting his nails as a way to express himself.

India vs Oman in Asia Cup: Rinku takes STUNNING low catch; SKY sets stage on fire at nets

Poll Do you agree with Suryakumar Yadav's decision to not bat against Oman? Yes, it was a strategic move No, he should have batted Unsure about his reasoning

NEW DELHI: Cricket legend Sunil Gavaskar defended India captain Suryakumar Yadav ’s controversial decision to not bat in the Asia Cup 2025 Group A clash against Oman, even after India lost eight wickets. The move sparked debate after India beat Oman by 21 runs at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium in Abu Dhabi on Friday. Batting first, India posted 188/8, while Oman responded with a spirited 167/4.During a discussion on Sony Sports, Gavaskar explained his backing: “If he had batted for even one over, he could have hit a few fours and sixes and that would have been good for him. But the way he batted against Pakistan, maybe does not need batting practice. He may have thought that Kuldeep Yadav 's batting could come in handy if India lose quick wickets in one of the matches. Perhaps that's why he may have sent Kuldeep in to bat.”The 76-year-old former India captain added: “He is very unorthodox thinker. We saw in Sri Lanka that he himself bowled and also gave Rinku Singh the ball. He turned the game, which seemed to have slipped away, on its head and won India the match. He is an innovative thinker. Maybe that's why he did not bat and sent in Kuldeep and Arshdeep Singh.”While Sunil Gavaskar praised Surya’s tactical approach, his son and former India cricketer Rohan Gavaskar questioned the logic. He felt India missed an opportunity to rest Suryakumar while giving Rinku Singh a chance.“What doesn’t register with me is, if Suryakumar Yadav isn’t going to bat clearly because he’s sent Arshdeep, Harshit, and Kuldeep all ahead of him, then he might as well take a rest. Give Rinku a go. You’re not going to bat; you’re not going to contribute with the ball. If that’s the whole thought process, then let Rinku have a game,” Rohan told Cricbuzz.The debate around Surya’s unorthodox decision continues, but cricket experts like Sunil Gavaskar believe it reflects his innovative thinking and long-term strategy, signaling a captain willing to take bold risks for the bigger picture.",Sunil gavaskar defends suryakumar yadav's decision to not bat against oman.

Patrick Mahomes’ injury listing raises alarms for Chiefs fans

“Chiefs HC Andy Reid on Patrick Mahomes’ wrist injury, says it was something that happened during the Week 2 game,”

He had some swelling earlier in the week, but they managed to reduce it. He says that Mahomes practiced all week.”

Receiver Xavier Worthy’s availability still seems up in the air

We’ll see how it goes,”

The Kansas City Chiefs are walking on eggshells. One more loss and they will be far behind in the playoff push. The Patrick-Travis duo couldn’t flash much of their classics during the first two weeks. The rest of the lineup also looked extremely frail to eke that out. Social media went insane when the most popular duo indulged themselves in the lavish birthday bash of Mahomes right after the devastating 20-17 loss against the Philadelphia Eagles. Now, the 30-year-old quarterback seemed to be in deeper water as his wrist started to act up.Mahomes was listed on the injury report this week with his wrist issue‌, leaving the team and the fans in ‌severe jeopardy. Andy Reid can’t afford a consecutive third loss for the season. They are grinding very hard to bounce back against the New York Giants this Sunday. Losing their beating heart in the offense at this critical point would certainly be a blow that might derail them from the race in the long run.But Reid doesn’t really entertain those thoughts yet. He is rather hopeful that Mahomes will suit up even if he still has some complications to pay heed to.Charles Goldman of AtoZSports spilled in a report. “Through the first two games of the season, Mahomes racked up 58.8% of his passes for 445 yards, two touchdowns, and one interception. He added 123 rushing yards and two rushing touchdowns on the ground. Mo debates on how crucial it is for him to lace up the shoes if the Chiefs want to clinch their first win of the season this week. But it’s not just Mahomes. The Chiefs have their star receiver Xavier Worthy on the shelf for an indefinite period.The 22-year-old Speedstar suffered a dislocated shoulder in the opening week. The mishap occurred during the Chiefs’ third offensive play. Worthy suddenly bumped into Travis and had to lean on his right arm after he managed to get up. He was taken out of the field immediately and hasn’t returned ever since. The NFL's official website updated that the star WR had an MRI, although his return timeline is still unclear.The young receiver returned to practice this week. That’s good news, but that doesn’t guarantee his availability in Week 3. When asked about it, coach Andy Reid escaped a clear cut answer. “Reid let the air of doubt prevail. The odds of his availability stands at a 50-50 stake as per the reports. If the Chiefs take any desperate step, it might backfire as shoulder injuries have the potential to keep him out for longer if rushed. But beyond all the strains, Reid must find a way to keep his offense tight. That’s non-negotiable for avoiding a rare week 3 heartbreak.",The kansas city chiefs are walking on eggshells.

NEW DELHI: Former Delhi captain Mithun Manhas has emerged as the front-runner to take charge as the new president of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI). The 45-year-old, who never represented India at the international level, is set to make history as the first uncapped cricketer to head the country’s most powerful sporting body.The deadline for filing nominations closes on Sunday, with elections scheduled for September 28 at the BCCI’s Annual General Meeting (AGM). However, as has been the trend since the 2019 amendment to the BCCI constitution, the post is expected to be filled unopposed. In recent years, the board has consistently preferred former cricketers as presidents, with Sourav Ganguly and Roger Binny serving in the role before Manhas.Manhas brings with him both administrative and cricketing experience. He has been associated with the Jammu and Kashmir Cricket Association (JKCA) in an administrative role and has also represented the state at BCCI’s AGMs. On the field, he was regarded as one of the most dependable figures in Indian domestic cricket.Debuting in 1997/98, Manhas was a steady middle-order batsman for Delhi during an era dominated by legends like Rahul Dravid, Sachin Tendulkar, VVS Laxman and Sourav Ganguly, which kept him away from India caps. Nevertheless, he led Delhi with distinction, guiding them to the Ranji Trophy title in 2007-08 and scoring 921 runs that season at an average of 57.56.A versatile cricketer, Manhas was primarily a right-handed batsman but also bowled off-spin and occasionally kept wickets. His career spanned 157 first-class matches, scoring 9,714 runs at 45.82 with 27 centuries and 49 fifties. He also featured in the IPL for Delhi Daredevils, Pune Warriors and Chennai Super Kings.With his mix of cricketing pedigree and administrative experience, Manhas now stands on the cusp of leading Indian cricket ’s governing body.","Mithun manhas has emerged as the front-runner to take charge as the new president of the board of control for cricket in india.

Poll Which aspect of Hardik Pandya's game do you find most impressive? Batting Bowling Fielding Overall athleticism

Exactly a week ago, on the eve of India's first match against Pakistan, Hardik Pandya was taking absolute stunners while practising with Team India fielding coach T Dilip at the ICC Cricket Academy.The India all-rounder missed a diving catch and immediately quipped: ""Agar main dive maar raha hoon iska matlab main theek se move nahi kar raha (If I am diving, it means I am not moving and anticipating quickly).""Pandya finished the session with a stunning running catch and got a bear hug from coach T Dilip.On Friday in Abu Dhabi, T Dilip was celebrating Pandya's running catch to dismiss Oman's Aamir Kaleem, who was looking to do the impossible. Kaleem flicked it to Pandya’s right, patrolling at fine leg. He moved rapidly, threw out his hands, and pulled off a blinder. He did very well to keep his balance too while running mere metres from the boundary rope.It was a catch that kept Oman at bay and saved India the humiliation.Former Pakistan speedster Shoaib Akhtar compared Pandya with Faheem Ashraf, saying, ""They bowl at a similar pace. But the only difference is attitude.Hardik is in your face, while Faheem is timid.""Akhtar is partially true about Hardik, but Faheem Ashraf as an athlete is nowhere close to the Indian all-rounder. He cannot win Pakistan matches with the bat, ball, and in the field.Hardik was a pivotal cog in Virat Kohli's team across formats. With him in the XI, the term ""Kulcha"" was coined for the wrist-spin duo—Kuldeep Yadav and Yuzvendra Chahal. His career-threatening injury broke that partnership, because without Pandya in the XI, only one of them could fit in.In Tests, he became India's fourth seamer — a luxury to have. It is saddening that a player of Pandya's calibre has only played 11 Tests, with his last appearance in 2018. India missed him dearly in the two World Test Championship (WTC) finals. He is the balance India need in overseas Tests.Former India strength and conditioning coach Soham Desai, who has seen Pandya closely, highlighted his workload.""Hardik is genetically and naturally very athletic. Very, very athletic. He has kept the benchmarks high. You won’t find such a guy who comes in the top 3 in sprint, explosiveness, and endurance. He is one of those guys,"" said Desai to TimesofIndia.com.""Obviously, with age, your body tends to slow down. But with his work ethic, hard work, and professionalism, he has maintained the benchmarks. His bowling load is equal to Siraj, Bumrah or Shami. In batting, it’s 60-70% of Virat Kohli’s workload—preparation-wise, not game load. So imagine the physical load he faces preparing for a series or tournament,"" he said.""That is why we need to address those cases differently,"" he added.Coming back to Pandya’s catch: could Pakistan’s Faheem Ashraf pluck those? Or is it only about attitude, as Akhtar suggested?Team India fielding coach T Dilip summed up Hardik's brilliance: ""The very important thing is preparation. Everybody has seen that. We were spot on with high catches and boundary line catches. But the most important factor was, at that moment, how well Hardik reacted. It is never easy, especially against a sweep when the ball is travelling. Catching technique, balancing with the ropes, and awareness made it fabulous. That is something we practised, and today he executed it under pressure,"" Dilip said in Abu Dhabi.He also subtly touched on Pandya’s workload management. ""Regarding workload, I think one thing we are very conscious of is communication—myself, bowling coach Morne Morkel, and Adrian (trainer). Whenever I push, someone else takes the back seat, and vice versa. In long camps, we focus on volume, but closer to tournaments, it’s all about specifics and intensity. With Hardik, his ability over time has been outstanding. It’s just about doing those little specifics,"" he said.Hardik may not be Kapil Dev, the one everyone thought he would emulate, but despite injuries and limited matches, he is the best India has got. There is a reason the management wraps him in cotton wool — they know his importance. So do former Pakistan cricketers and experts. On their shows, they talk more about Hardik than Bumrah, Kuldeep, or Suryakumar Yadav.Hardik Pandya is indeed the Indian cricketer Pakistan fears and admires the most in the current setup.","Hardik pandya was a pivotal cog in virat kohli's team across formats.
