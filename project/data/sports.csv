This result meant Paraguay needed only a point to qualify, while Brazil required a win to advance.Brazil struggled to create opportunities in the first half, with Cunha missing a clear chance in the 35th minute when he headed wide from close range. However, he made amends by setting up the winning goal, utilising Raphinha's build-up play to enter the box and deliver a low cross for Vinicius to score.The victory positions Brazil in third place in the South American standings, accumulating 25 points from 16 games. This guarantees them a top-six finish and automatic qualification for the World Cup.Paraguay remain on 24 points following the defeat.

Sidney Crosby 15 years long relationship with girlfriend Kathy Leutner





NHL legend Sidney Crosby has not only guided the Pittsburgh Penguins to championship heights but has also established a quiet, solid, long-lasting relationship off the ice with long-time girlfriend American model Kathy Leutner. Though Sidney Crosby's on-ice accomplishments are well-documented, his love life has long been kept under wraps. Kathy Leutner has been his constant companion, regularly seen cheering him on at pivotal matches but never hankering for the limelight herself.The two began dating back in 2008 when they were introduced by common friends. Sidney Crosby was an NHL superstar by then, while Kathy Leutner was establishing a thriving modeling career for brands including Abercrombie & Fitch, Hollister, and Faviana. She was selected in 2011 to appear on Sports Illustrated's model search and was one of the very few women from her agency to receive an in-office interview with the editorial team. Kathy Leutner has been Sidney Crosby's rock since the start of his NHL career. They met when he was just 21 years old, in his third NHL season with the Pittsburgh Penguins. Kathy Leutner has been often seen at Sidney Crosby's hockey games, supporting him as a Team Canada and Pittsburgh Penguins player.Born in 1986 in Chantilly, Virginia, Kathryn A. Leutner is the daughter of John and Judith Leutner. She graduated from Chantilly High School in 2004 and was offered a partial athletic scholarship from James Madison University, a testament to her prowess in the sport. Despite her strong ties to athletics, modeling quickly took over. She was discovered at a mall near her hometown, just a year after graduating from high school, while shopping with her mother.Kathy began her modeling career in 2005 and got her big break in 2011 when she appeared in Sports Illustrated magazineLeutner once confessed in an initial interview that sports was her main focus, but the moment she entered the modeling world, she knew that this was what she was meant to do. Her dream came true when she started gracing the covers of Fitness Magazine and landing campaigns for big lifestyle brands.The couple is yet to make any announcements of marriage plans; their long-term relationship speaks of a connection much stronger than social media pronouncements or red carpet sightings. Despite their lack of public announcements about their future plans, fans wish for a potential engagement or wedding.Sidney Crosby and Kathy Leutner are arguably the sport's most low-key celebrity couple, but their almost two-decade relationship is telling. Where fame usually drowns out personal life, this couple shows us that true love doesn't require attention. While Crosby keeps working on building his NHL legacy, Leutner is his biggest fan, sitting quietly in the background while still playing an important role behind the scenes.Also Read: With Mike Sullivan gone and Dan Muse in, Sidney Crosby‚Äôs loyalty faces the ultimate test",Sidney crosby and kathy leutner have been together for 15 years.

Aaron Rodgers opens up about his secret marriage , emotional return to the NFL, and why joining the Pittsburgh Steelers was bigger than football

From Secret vows to Steelers legacy ‚Äî Aaron Rodgers begins his final chapter under the brightest spotlight yet





Aaron Rodgers stood before a sea of cameras in Pittsburgh, not with a chip on his shoulder or a need to prove anything‚Äîbut with a sense of peace. The 41-year-old quarterback, now a Steeler, opened his first press conference of the 2025 NFL season with honesty, depth, and a surprising personal reveal. His decision to come back for a 21st NFL season wasn‚Äôt about silencing doubters. Instead, it was about something far more personal‚Äîhe says it was the right move for his soul, and for a fresh start rooted in purpose.Aaron Rodgers made it clear that ego played no part in his move to Pittsburgh. ‚ÄúA lot of decisions that I‚Äôve made over my career and life from strictly the ego, even if they turn out well, are always unfulfilling,‚Äù he said Tuesday after the Steelers‚Äô first mandatory minicamp practice. ‚ÄúBut the decisions made from the soul are usually pretty fulfilling. So this was a decision that was best for my soul.‚ÄùThe Steelers supported him throughout the offseason, especially as he navigated personal struggles‚Äîincluding health scares involving close friends and family members battling cancer. Rodgers said those situations ‚Äúhave improved a bit,‚Äù clearing the way for his NFL return.Key to that comeback was longtime Pittsburgh head coach Mike Tomlin, whom Rodgers credited for inspiring ‚Äúsome of the coolest conversations I‚Äôve had in the game.‚Äù‚ÄúIt starts with Mike Tomlin,‚Äù Rodgers said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been a fan of his for a long time. There‚Äôs a few iconic franchises in the NFL. I played for one of ‚Äòem for 18 years. This is another one of those.‚ÄùAaron Rodgers also confirmed what many had speculated after spotting a wedding band on his hand‚Äîhe recently got married. ‚ÄúA couple months ago,‚Äù he shared, offering no further details except a past mention of a woman named Brittani.With a new team, a new city, and a renewed sense of purpose, Rodgers is ready to lead the Steelers into a pivotal season‚Äîone that opens with a fitting showdown against the Jets in Week 1.Also Read: Los Angeles Rams‚Äô 2025 offensive trio quietly emerging as one of the NFL‚Äôs most dangerous units","Aaron rodgers opened his first press conference of the 2025 nfl season with honesty, depth, and a surprising personal reveal.

Romance under pressure: Love in the time of strict schedules





As Kansas City Chiefs star tight end Travis Kelce enters what could be the most critical‚Äîand possibly final‚Äîseason of his NFL career, insiders reveal that his once fairytale romance with pop superstar Taylor Swift is beginning to encounter growing strain, as the stark contrast between Kelce‚Äôs rigid training schedule and Swift‚Äôs glamorous, fast-paced lifestyle creates subtle but mounting tension behind closed doors.According to the Star Magazine, Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce‚Äîboth 35‚Äîare entering a challenging new chapter in their relationship. Kelce, still reeling from a devastating Super Bowl loss, has thrown himself into a punishing fitness schedule, complete with strict calorie tracking, early nights, and intense workouts. And while Swift has been supportive, even traveling to Florida recently for a quiet night out in West Palm Beach, sources say the pop icon is starting to feel the strain.‚ÄúEveryone told her dating an athlete comes with sacrifices,‚Äù an insider reportedly told Star Magazine. ‚ÄúBut she didn‚Äôt expect the lifestyle to be so rigid.‚ÄùTaylor Swift, known for her electrifying performances and glamorous public appearances, is reportedly finding Kelce‚Äôs football-focused lifestyle less than thrilling. As one source put it, the idea of winding down by 9 p.m. clashes with the singer‚Äôs fast-paced, often nocturnal routine.‚ÄúGoing to bed by 9 p.m. doesn‚Äôt quite match the singer‚Äôs usual vibe,‚Äù the source added.This lifestyle shift comes just as Travis Kelce is under immense pressure to redeem his team after last season‚Äôs disappointing finish. With training camp looming, his focus has turned almost entirely to the field. That drive for redemption has reportedly left little room for the kind of spontaneous fun the couple once enjoyed‚Äîwhether that meant surprise date nights or jet-setting between concert stops.Though Swift and Kelce's relationship remains strong on the surface, close friends say Swift misses the spark of earlier days‚Äîthose filled with concert cameos, hand-in-hand appearances on red carpets, and playful social media posts. Now, reality is setting in as they try to balance two high-octane careers that demand very different daily rhythms.Still, Swift continues to show up for Kelce. Insiders describe her as ‚Äúsupportive but struggling,‚Äù trying to adapt to a lifestyle built around protein shakes and playbooks rather than champagne toasts and creative chaos.Also Read: ‚ÄúLooks like someone‚Äôs grandfather‚Äù: Travis Kelce‚Äôs bold new hairstyle at family wedding with Taylor Swift sets social media abuzz As training season intensifies, fans are left wondering: will love win out, or will the tension between spotlight sparkle and locker room discipline prove too much?Only time‚Äîand perhaps a few more late nights‚Äîwill tell.","Taylor swift and travis kelce are entering a challenging new chapter in their relationship.

What drew the media attention towards Sinner‚Äôs private life





W hen tennis star Jannik Sinner took the court at the French Open this June, it wasn‚Äôt just his explosive backhand or fiery matches entering the headlines‚Äîit was his personal life. Rumors linking him romantically with Laila Hasanovic, who was previously linked to F1 racer Michael Schumacher , exploded alongside intense media scrutiny. While love stories in sports aren‚Äôt new, their presence during a Grand Slam adds a different beat to the athlete‚Äôs rhythm. Rather than focus on court stats or sponsorships, this piece explores how off-court relationships‚Äîreal or rumored‚Äîshape the public perception and internal world of rising champions like Sinner in modern tennis.Across social platforms and tabloids, the chatter was quite loud. Fans worldwide speculated over the unlikely match: ‚ÄúF1 star Mick Schumacher‚Äôs model ex‚Äëgirlfriend sparks Jannik Sinner dating rumours as she watches his French Open final defeat‚Äù. Though the original Daily Mail story led the narrative, it‚Äôs essential to separate speculation from fact.According to Sinner‚Äôs Wikipedia page, the 23‚Äëyear‚Äëold Italian‚Äîcurrently having lost the French Open to Alcaraz‚Äîwas in a known relationship with athlete Anna Kalinskaya from June 2024 until their split in early May 2025.Kalinskaya herself, a Russian tennis pro, had confirmed on the French Open grounds that they were dating, maintaining they ‚Äúkeep everything very confidential. You know my confidentiality‚Ä¶ I won‚Äôt say more‚Äù.Interestingly, the rumored connection to Laila Hasanovic overlaps with this timeline. But Sinner has not publicly confirmed any relationship beyond Kalinskaya. And while tabloids often spotlight these stories‚Äîespecially during big tournaments‚Äîmany athletes choose discretion in their private lives. Of course, what stands out is how quickly such rumors can influence fan attention and media framing. While Sinner geared up to launch his Jannik Sinner Foundation in April 2025 to empower youth through sport, the juxtaposition between philanthropic focus of the tennis star and dating rumours couldn‚Äôt be sharper.Jannik Sinner‚Äôs tennis has always spoken volumes‚Äîbut his personal life, be it private or publicly speculated, adds resonance to his public persona. In a world where relationships can be headlines overnight, maintaining focus becomes both art and necessity. As Sinner continues to define himself‚Äîon court, off court, and through charity work‚Äîit‚Äôs worth remembering that every ace, every sponsorship, and every off-court headline is but one part of the story.

After days of unrelenting speculation, Vanessa Bryant took to Instagram Stories on Sunday, June 1, to put the rumors to rest. Her response wasn‚Äôt a press statement or a legal warning, it was a wild meme with a big middle finger to the internet trolls.

What the Los Angeles Lakers Give Up

The Bigger Picture for Los Angeles





Theface a crucial offseason after a playoff run that exposed their frontcourt weaknesses. With Anthony Davis now in Dallas, the team lacks a reliable center, making a trade for a star big man a top priority. One potential solution? A blockbuster deal for Utah Jazz forwardA hypothetical trade scenario by NBA writer Greg Swartz of Bleacher Report outlines how the Lakers could land Markkanen. Here‚Äôs the breakdown:- F Lauri Markkanen- F Rui Hachimura- G/F Dalton Knecht- PG Gabe Vincent- F Maxi Kleber- 2031 first-round pick (unprotected)Swartz explains the rationale behind the move: ""The Lakers will always be on the hunt for stars, yet are limited in trade assets after acquiring Luka Donƒçiƒá at the deadline. Markkanen is probably the best level of player Los Angeles can reasonably acquire and would be a strong third option behind Donƒçiƒá and LeBron James.""Lauri Markkanen brings versatility to the Los Angeles Lakers ‚Äô lineup. Standing at 7 feet tall, he can play both forward positions and even fill in as a stretch center. His skill set addresses two major needs:- Scoring Boost: With a career average of 18.2 points per game, Markkanen provides reliable offense.- Frontcourt Depth: His ability to space the floor complements LeBron James and Luka Donƒçiƒá However, durability concerns linger. Markkanen hasn‚Äôt played more than 60 games in the past two seasons, which could be a risk for the Lakers.The trade costs Los Angeles four rotation players and a future first-round pick. Here‚Äôs what they lose:- Rui Hachimura: A solid two-way forward.- Dalton Knecht: A promising young wing.- Gabe Vincent: A reliable backup guard.- Maxi Kleber: A veteran big with playoff experience.- 2031 first-round pick: The only available pick after the rescinded Charlotte Hornets deal.While the price is steep, the Lakers gain financial flexibility to pursue additional moves in free agency.This trade positions the Los Angeles Lakers to compete immediately while keeping their long-term options open. Lauri Markkanen‚Äôs arrival would solidify their frontcourt, giving them a much-needed third star alongside Donƒçiƒá and James.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Golden State Warriors might chase $36 million Chicago Bulls star to boster squad and improve Stephen Curry's title odds The offseason will reveal whether the front office pulls the trigger, but one thing is clear: the Lakers are hunting for upgrades, and Markkanen could be their best realistic target.","Los angeles lakers are eyeing a major trade.

Fans divided over format and timing





The 2025 WWE Draft may not be cancelled after all. While the annual roster shake-up traditionally follows WrestleMania in the spring, this year‚Äôs edition appears to be headed for a strategic shift - possibly to September, according to multiple reports.Sources including BodySlam.net and PWInsider suggest that WWE is considering moving the Draft to a post-SummerSlam window, aligning it with the company‚Äôs season premiere episodes of RAW and SmackDown. This move would allow ongoing storylines to reach natural conclusions over the summer, while also setting the stage for a refreshed television product in the fall.Mike Johnson of PWInsider confirmed that the Draft hasn't been scrapped, saying it's simply a matter of ‚Äúwhere and when to do it.‚Äù The shift is reportedly part of WWE‚Äôs broader strategy under Triple H‚Äôs creative leadership, which has focused on long-term storytelling and smoother transitions between brands.The delay also appears to be influenced by recent NXT call-ups, many of whom are still finding their footing on the main roster. With WWE not in a rush to reshuffle its rosters, the focus has shifted to making sure these fresh faces get enough screen time before any major realignment occurs.Wrestling insider WrestleVotes echoed the sentiment in a Sportskeeda WrestleBinge Q&A, noting that ‚Äúthey want to do it... just a date has not popped up yet.‚Äù The message is clear: WWE is still committed to a draft this year, but is carefully choosing its moment.Fan response on social media has been mixed. While some are relieved the Draft is still on, others have questioned its relevance. One user wrote, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the point? Talent go all over the 3 brands all the time.‚Äù Another commented, ‚ÄúMake sure people actually move brands this year. Last year barely anyone got drafted to a new brand.‚ÄùOthers are simply nostalgic for the days of the old Draft lottery machine, calling the current format ‚Äúbland.‚Äù However, there‚Äôs also cautious optimism. ‚ÄúGood.

NEW DELHI: The stage is set for the much-anticipated World Test Championship (WTC) Final as Australia take on South Africa at the iconic Lord‚Äôs from June 11‚Äì15.While all eyes are on the cricketing contest between two top-class teams, questions have arisen around the possible outcomes ‚Äî particularly in the event of a draw or rain-affected Test.If the WTC Final between Australia and South Africa ends in a draw or tie, the World Test Championship mace will be shared between the two finalists. This has been a standard regulation for the one-off WTC final since its inception in 2021.There is no additional tiebreaker like a Super Over in Test cricket. Unlike bilateral Test series, where a draw simply concludes the contest with no winner, this being a championship final means both teams will be crowned joint winners if no result is possible.Yes. The ICC has allocated June 16 as a reserve day, which will be used only if net playing time lost during the scheduled five days is not recovered via extended sessions. The sixth day can add up to a maximum of 90 overs if required.If the five scheduled days allow full innings and time for results ‚Äî even with weather interruptions ‚Äî and still end in a draw or tie, the reserve day won‚Äôt be activated.Alongside the prestigious mace, there is plenty of financial incentive.The ICC has significantly raised the prize money for the 2023‚Äì25 WTC cycle.This increase reflects the growing stature of the Test format‚Äôs showpiece event, with both Australia and South Africa eager to add not just silverware, but also a record paycheck.Australia, the defending champions, led by Pat Cummins , are eyeing a repeat after their dominant win over India in the 2023 final. Their squad, brimming with experience, includes star names like Steve Smith, Mitchell Starc, and Marnus Labuschagne.In contrast, South Africa are chasing history. Temba Bavuma‚Äôs men are looking to end a 27-year ICC trophy drought. Since winning the 1998 ICC KnockOut, South Africa have consistently faltered in knockout stages, earning the tag of ""chokers.""

Juan Soto's redemption moment ignites New York Mets' comeback against Washington Nationals





Juan Soto's dramatic home run celebration and intense stare-down of Washington Nationals pitcher MacKenzie Gore became the defining moment of Tuesday night's thrilling 10-inning contest at Citi Field. The New York Mets superstar's defiant gesture after launching a 373-foot solo blast wasn't just typical baseball theater‚Äîit stemmed from a deeply personal competitive rivalry rooted in a blockbuster 2022 trade that forever linked these two talented players. Soto's theatrical moment helped fuel the New York Mets' remarkable comeback victory, defeating the Washington Nationals 5-4 in extra innings before an electric home crowd.The Juan Soto and MacKenzie Gore rivalry goes back to the August 2022 blockbuster trade that rocked Major League Baseball. Soto was traded to the San Diego Padres, along with prospects CJ Abrams, Robert Hassell III, and James Wood, in exchange from the Washington Nationals. This deal gave the two players an unavoidable relationship, where each one is a symbol of what the other organisation gave up.MacKenzie Gore came into Tuesday night with 114 strikeouts, the most in all of Major League Baseball, and has firmly established himself as one of the best left-handed pitchers in the sport.The ace of the Washington Nationals had been crushing the opposing batters throughout the season, and his clash with Juan Soto was especially intriguing. Their initial meeting of the night Gore fanned Soto on three sliders in a row, which would be a prelude to the stunning comeback the latter would make in the third inning.Juan Soto responded in resounding style in the third inning, as he turned on a 2-2 slider against MacKenzie Gore and crushed it 373 feet to left-center field, giving him a solo home run. The explosion made the lead of the Washington Nationals 3-2 instantaneously, yet it was the reaction of Soto that drew the attention of everyone. The New York Mets' home run hitter exchanged words with Gore as he rounded the bases and that made the scene a pure drama in baseball style that awakened both benches and the audience.The standoff was not merely a case of normal baseball gamesmanship. Juan Soto had gone through a difficult May in which his batting average had dropped to .224, and he was being questioned on how he was adapting to life with the New York Mets after signing a record-breaking $765 million, 15-year deal. His latest explosion (eight base hits in four games, raising his average to .341 in his last 12 games) proved that he was back in All-Star form at the right time.The two players later played down the Exchange later, with Juan Soto saying they were just greeting each other and MacKenzie Gore accepting they have a competitive relationship. Nevertheless, the instant undoubtedly served as a further impetus to the New York Mets' ultimate win, as Soto had an RBI double and made an outstanding defensive catch in the right field to clinch the thrilling extra-inning victory.Also Read: Nationals' bat-retrieving dog Bruce gets major league call-up and fans can't wait for his MLB debut The victory marked another chapter in Juan Soto's remarkable first season with the New York Mets, as he continues justifying his massive contract while helping establish the team as legitimate contenders in the National League East division race.",Juan soto's dramatic home run celebration and intense stare-down of washington nationals pitcher mackenzie gore became the defining moment of tuesday night's thrilling 10-inning contest at citi field.

Braves need a better hitter at shortstop to improve their offense

Could a new player like Bo Bichette fix Atlanta‚Äôs shortstop problem





The Atlanta Braves began the 2025 season with dreams of winning the World Series. Now, their playoff chances have fallen from 93 percent to just 26 percent. The team isn‚Äôt hitting enough home runs, even with a strong lineup. With the trade deadline a month away, the Braves need to make changes. Swapping shortstop Nick Allen for a better hitter could help save their season.Nick Allen is a great defender, making 12 outs above average this season. His defense is one of the best in the National League, only behind Bobby Witt Jr. But, his hitting is a problem, with just a .228 batting average in 56 games. The Braves need more runs, and Allen‚Äôs stats show he struggles at the plate.His expected stats, like xwOBA and xBA, are very low, meaning he doesn‚Äôt help the team score. While his defense is amazing, the Braves need a shortstop who can hit better. A stronger hitter could boost the team‚Äôs offense and help them reach the playoffs. With the trade deadline coming soon, the Braves should find a new shortstop to fill this role on an immediate basis.Also Read: MLB insider claims Braves are risking long term future by refusing to trade Marcell Ozuna before deadline Recent posts on X mention Bo Bichette, a Toronto Blue Jays shortstop, as a possible trade target.Bichette is a free agent after this season and could be available if Toronto doesn‚Äôt make the playoffs. He‚Äôs hitting .269 with eight home runs and 38 RBIs in 66 games.His offense is much better than Allen‚Äôs, though his defense isn‚Äôt as strong. Bichette could be a great fit for the Braves, helping them score more runs. However, other teams also want him, and Toronto might keep him if they‚Äôre close to the playoffs.The Braves could also look at the 2025 MLB draft for a new shortstop.

'Nitish Kumar is a guy who can bowl that magic ball': India bowling coach Morne Morkel

Poll Who do you think should be the seam-bowling all-rounder for the Leeds Test? Nitish Reddy Shardul Thakur Both should play

Bombay Sport Exchange Ep. 6: Harish Thawani on cricket's TV market and the watershed moments





NEW DELHI: Morne Morkel , India's bowling coach, believes that while Nitish Reddy can deliver ""magical"" balls, the batting all-rounder needs to increase his bowling workload to enhance his overall contribution in the forthcoming five-Test England series.Having scored a Test century against Australia at the MCG during last year's 'Boxing Day' Test, Reddy is competing with the experienced Shardul Thakur for the seam-bowling all-rounder position in the playing XI.Following Reddy's 26.5 overs in two 'Tests' against England Lions, Morkel has ""challenged"" him to expand his bowling responsibilities.""I think he (Reddy) is skilful. He is a guy who can bowl that magical ball. So for him, it is about creating that consistency, and that's something we want to work on. It's important for his game as well,"" the former South African fast bowling great said on the sidelines of India's training session, as quoted by PTI.""I've had conversations with him where I've challenged him to bowl a bit more. I want to see the ball more in his hands. We all know what he can do with the bat. But for a team, if you can have those bowling options, especially in these conditions, I think he'll be one to be excited and compliment his bowling at that,"" said Morkel.When questioned about the selection between Reddy and Shardul Thakur for the Leeds Test, Morkel remained diplomatic: ""In terms of the balance, we've got very happy with that. But for us as a bowling unit, finding that gear that we're going to need in Test matches is going to be important.""Morkel expressed confidence in the comprehensive nature of India's squad selection.He highlighted the importance of regaining Test match fitness, noting the extended period without Test cricket and the specific challenges of English conditions.""I think in terms of that we cover, like you say, all the bases. But for us now, the key thing is to get Test match fit, ready, that sharpness, to get that back. We haven't played Test matches for a while now,"" he noted. ""In England, the conditions can suit you, and it's overcast, but still it's going to be good surfaces. I think we're going to be testing that.""The primary focus remains on ensuring players maintain their fitness for 90-over days, according to Morkel.Regarding the upcoming four-day warm-up match against India A, Morkel expressed keen interest in observing the players' performance.""I think that's one of the things that has impressed me so much in these two-day sessions we've had. The guys sort of stepped up by themselves. They've taken that ownership, that responsibility, and realising that it's going to be a tough tour,"" he added.""I think that's the pleasing thing as coaches, to see guys taking that leadership and ownership in practice.""He noted the demanding nature of English outfields and weather conditions, emphasising the importance of swift adaptation to match fitness requirements.Morkel expressed satisfaction with the players' initiative during training sessions.Regarding Jasprit Bumrah 's preparation, Morkel dismissed concerns about limited match practice. ""He (Bumrah) knows how to get himself ready. He knows how to prepare. And like you say, I was blown away to see the energy in the ball the last three days. So that's very exciting to see happy 'Boom',"" he added. ""I'm just happy his body is in good shape at the moment and we'll manage him with that. And we'll be smart with him because he's obviously key for us. """,Morne morkel believes nitish reddy needs to increase his bowling workload. Reddy scored a test century against australia at the mcg during last year's 'boxing day' test. Morkel expressed confidence in the comprehensive nature of india's squad selection. He highlighted the importance of regaining test match fitness.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121782779,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-98638,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
