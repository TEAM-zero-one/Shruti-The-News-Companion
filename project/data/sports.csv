LONDON: Booker Prize -winning Indian author Kiran Desai is a favorite to win the coveted fiction trophy for a second time with her first novel in two decades.""The Loneliness of Sonia and Sunny"" is on a US-dominated six-book shortlist announced Tuesday by a judging panel that includes Irish writer Roddy Doyle and actor Sarah Jessica Parker. The almost 700-page tale of two young Indians making their way in the United States is Desai's third novel and her first since ""The Inheritance of Loss,"" which won the Booker Prize in 2006.Two previous Booker finalists are up for the 50,000 ($68,000) prize again: U.K. writer Andrew Miller for ""The Land in Winter,"" set during an early-1960s cold snap, and Hungarian-British writer David Szalay for ""Flesh,"" which charts one man's life across decades.Three novels by Americans complete the list: Susan Choi's family saga ""Flashlight""; Katie Kitamura's tale of acting and identity, ""Audition""; and midlife-crisis road trip ""The Rest of Our Lives"" by Ben Markovits.Doyle - a Booker winner himself in 1993 for ""Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha"" - said the six books tackle big issues, including migration and class, in a ""brilliantly human"" way.""They all follow the human in the stories,"" Doyle said. ""That might seem a bit trite, but I've read novels where I've often felt to myself, if there was a little bit less showing off there would be a good story there.And I don't think any of these books show off.""Founded in 1969, the Booker Prize has a reputation for transforming writers' careers. Its winners have included Salman Rushdie, Margaret Atwood, Ian McEwan, Hilary Mantel and Samantha Harvey, who won last year with ""Orbital.""Past winners have included debut novels - from Arundhati Roy's ""The God of Small Things"" in 1997 to Douglas Stuart's ""Shuggie Bain"" in 2020 - but this year's list is dominated by veterans. All the finalists are decades into their careers, and all but Desai have published at least five books.""That's the best thing about writing books,"" said Kiley Reid, author of the novel ""Such a Fun Age"" and another member of the judging panel. ""It's not gymnastics. You don't peak at any age. And seeing authors late into their careers have these wonderful moments, it's really encouraging.""Originally open to novels from the U.K., Ireland and the Commonwealth, the prize expanded in 2014 to admit American writers. Worries about an American takeover have largely proved unfounded, though this year's list of six includes three American writers and a fourth, Desai, who has long lived in New York.That's likely to reignite grumbling from some in the U.K., especially since big American fiction prizes like the Pulitzer and the National Book Awards are only open to U.S.-based authors.""Well, that's not our only problem"" in the U.S., Parker said.""As somebody who likes to read globally, I always want more and more diversity,"" said the ""Sex and the City"" star, a longtime advocate for reading and literacy. ""So I would love all literary awards and competitions to alert readers to great books, no matter where they're from.""The judges read 153 novels submitted by publishers, selecting 13 semifinalists and then narrowing that to six during a four-hour meeting. Another meeting looms to pick a winner, who will be crowned on Nov. 10 at a ceremony in London.Parker said it had been a joy to immerse herself in a year of reading, but that cutting books from contention was ""real agony.""""We all had a couple of books that our heart was broken,"" she said.","Indian author kiran desai is a favorite to win the coveted fiction trophy for a second time.

Gervonta Davis and Jake Paul fight rules, venue change and criticism

Jake Paul‚Äôs next boxing show has already been slammed before it even begins. On Monday, September 22, 2025, at a press conference in New York, Paul stood face-to-face with unbeaten champion Gervonta ‚ÄúTank‚Äù Davis. The huge size gap between the two shocked many, including Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy, who went online to call the November 14 exhibition fight in Miami, Florida an ‚Äúabsolute clown show.‚Äù The bout will stream live on Netflix from the Kaseya Center.Dave Portnoy took to X (formerly Twitter) after the New York press event, mocking the fight as a money-making stunt. He wrote:The criticism comes because Paul, 6-foot-1 with a 76-inch reach, weighed around 200 pounds in his last fight. Davis, in comparison, is only 5-foot-5 and usually fights at 135 pounds. At the presser, Paul towered over Davis.Jake Paul defended himself, saying his game plan is simple: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to use my reach, my size, and keep him away.‚ÄùGervonta Davis, unbeaten at 30-0-1, fired back with confidence:The exhibition fight was first planned for Atlanta, Georgia, but local regulators refused approval.Rick Thompson, chairman of the Georgia Athletic and Entertainment Commission, told USA Today: ‚ÄúThis is the dumbest thing I‚Äôve ever heard. It‚Äôs a money grabber, and I‚Äôm not OK with that.‚ÄùBecause of that, the fight was moved to Miami. The rules also show it is only an exhibition match, so Davis‚Äôs undefeated record will not be affected. Gambling will not be allowed.

Joseph Woll's breakout year and big contract with Toronto

Why exactly is Joseph Woll stepping away from the Leafs just as preparations for the new NHL season shoot into full gear? The 27-year-old goaltender is on a leave of absence to handle a personal family matter; the organization has confirmed his absence, with no timeline presently given for the goaltender to return. Fans observantly wait for further updates on the matter.The announcement came in the morning, just prior to Toronto's scheduled preseason encounter with the Ottawa Senators. General manager Brad Treliving addressed the press, emphasizing the club would respect Woll's privacy and would not provide any further information. Treliving said the team fully expects Woll will return to the roster, but cannot give a timeframe for when that will happen.That statement stood by the situation, asking the media and fans for some respect regarding Woll‚Äôs situation while reminding everyone that the focus was on providing the space Woll needed for his family matters before coming back to the ice. In the meantime, goaltending responsibilities will be shared among the rest of the netminders at camp until the outlook on Woll becomes clearer.This absence just happens to coincide with his breakout year.He played 42 games in the 2023-24 season with the Maple Leafs and posted a 27-14-1 record with a 90.9 save percentage. However, he could not hold the spotlight through the playoffs much after replacing Anthony Stolarz due to a concussion, as he finished with an 88.6 save percentage in seven games versus the Florida Panthers.Earlier this summer, Toronto signed Woll to a three-year, $11 million contract extension beginning this season, expressing confidence in him. Drafted 62nd overall in 2016, Woll has slowly made his way into the NHL, and the franchise considers him to be a cornerstone of its future between the pipes.Also Read: Alex Ovechkin‚Äôs NHL future unclear as he enters his final contract year The timing of Joseph Woll's leave indeed leaves some awkwardly uncertain times for the Maple Leafs, but still, supporting their goaltender remains their primary concern.

Why the Texans made the move

What‚Äôs next for C.J. Gardner-Johnson

After only three games into the 2025 NFL season, the Houston Texans have released veteran safety C.J. Gardner-Johnson in a surprise move. The decision to cut the DB comes barely a year after he signed a three-year contract with the team to bolster their secondary, but, given his experience, versatility, and leadership in the locker room, the move has stunned fans and analysts alike.Reports suggest that Gardner-Johnson was released partly because of mediocre play and partly because of issues within the building in Houston. Though he had been viewed as a key part of the defensive backfield, his snap count had fluctuated during the first three weeks. Clearly, it's more important to DeMeco Ryans and the Texans' front office staff to develop their younger guys in the secondary than it is to find an established veteran to help in the short term.Houston could change things up a bit during the season, and Gardner-Johnson's release gives them some salary cap flexibility. The Texans are in the thick of the race for the AFC South right now, and the front office clearly is prepared to make aggressive moves to keep them out front.Also Read: Top 5 artists who could perform at the 2026 Super Bowl halftime show Even with this unexpected action, Gardner-Johnson is a top option; thus, he shouldn't be hitting free agency for long. He is a 2022 Super Bowl champion with the Philadelphia Eagles and has made a name for himself as a physical, versatile defensive back who can play safety and nickel corner.Several teams that need veteran leadership and depth in the secondary, including those with playoff ambitions, could come calling. The fact that Gardner-Johnson is an adept, aggressive player who is known to come out of hibernation with impact plays when teams need him most makes him a notable signing for teams looking to build in the mid-term run.The release is just the next chapter in a career that has already seen its share of highs and lows for Gardner-Johnson. How he responds to this newest chapter will go a long way in determining the next chapter of his NFL career, and many in the league will certainly keep a close eye on wherever he resurfaces.","The houston texans have released veteran safety c.j.

Bill Belichick faces mounting pressure after UCF loss



AI distractions overshadow UNC‚Äôs on-field reality



It used to be a lighthearted storyline, but now the situation surrounding Bill Belichick at North Carolina feels more troubling. The legendary former New England Patriots coach, now 73, has stumbled badly in his first month leading the Tar Heels. A 34-9 blowout loss to UCF dropped his team to 1-3, leaving fans wondering if this experiment is unraveling faster than anyone imagined.Belichick‚Äôs transition to college football was never going to be simple, but the early signs have been brutal. Three lopsided defeats in four games have tested both his legacy and patience. Adding to the drama is his 24-year-old girlfriend, Jordon Hudson, whose constant presence on the sidelines and in the tunnel after games continues to stir debate. Her visibility has become part of the conversation around Belichick‚Äôs tenure, whether he likes it or not.Sports media voices have not held back. Bill Simmons, speaking on The Bill Simmons Podcast, admitted his dismay at watching his football hero endure such struggles. ""[Me and] all my Pats fans, we're just like, 'wow',"" Simmons said. ""Could this be going worse? Like this is the greatest NFL coach of all time. This has been the most humiliating year ever.He's getting his a* kicked in these games. He's got this 25 year old coming on the sidelines when he's trying to coach. Like, how did he get to this point?""*As if defeats weren‚Äôt enough, digital noise has made the situation even murkier. A viral AI-altered video appeared to show Belichick and Hudson sharing a sideline kiss. The clip, viewed nearly 5 million times, later proved fake. Yet it only intensified the circus, leaving the on-field product overshadowed by online chatter.For now, UNC fans are desperate for wins, not memes. But until Belichick finds a way to stabilize the Tar Heels, his coaching comeback may remain defined less by football and more by the noise surrounding it.Also Read: Chiefs‚Äô Travis Kelce and Andy Reid get into fiery sideline argument on live broadcast: Is everything going well between these two?","Bill belichick's north carolina tar heels are 1-3 after a 34-9 loss to ucf.

Horvat calls Homa's swing ""unbelievably slotted""



A difficult 2025 so far

Remarks from the swing coach

Can I Beat Max Homa if I Start 5 Under Par?

There are no lifts remaining for Max Homa on the PGA Tour, though his play continues to generate interest. The latest cheer came from Golf YouTuber Grant Horvat, who recently shared Homa's mechanics in a viral video on X.In the clip, Homa can be seen rattling out a tee shot with his driver and calmly walking off toward the greens. The whole thing impressed Horvat, not just the swing-angle control Homa displayed in practice.‚ÄúNot trying to ‚Äúglaze‚Äù at all. However, Max‚Äôs swing is so unbelievably slotted right now. I witnessed him only miss 1 fairway and his irons and putter were dialed. I think he‚Äôs gonna have a great year.‚ÄùConfidence from outside observers about Homa‚Äôs potential reveals just how much belief is still there, notwithstanding the fact that a player has not won in two seasons.Homa has played in all four majors this year but unfortunately the results have not met expectations. His best chance came at the PGA Championship, although he ended up tied for 60th. Without any wins to boast about, his entry to the highest echelons is mostly because of his consistency and sheer technical ability.At the conclusion of the PGA Championship, Homa‚Äôs longtime swing coach and distinguished teaching professional, John Scott Rattan, also shared thoughts about his pupil‚Äôs form.Rattan said that Homa‚Äôs fundamentals are still good, though the results haven‚Äôt caught up just yet. He stressed patience and suggested that just a couple of minor changes might be all it takes to get small misses into leaderboard rallies as soon as the next events come around.Having failed to make Team U.S. this week in the Ryder Cup, Homa has taken this period as an opportunity to work even more on his game. Throw in a glowing review from a famous YouTuber, and the old-school belief once more creeps in that the 34 year old Californian might be ready for another breakthrough.If Horvat's forecast holds, then a comeback could turn into an actual season, putting Homa back in the ranks of the Tour's greats in 2026. Meanwhile, all golf fans are waiting for is possibly another swing"" from him, that ""slotted"" season, according to Horvat, being the one that takes momentum into trophies.","Golf youtuber grant horvat calls max homa's swing ""unbelievably slotted"" homa has played in all four majors this year but unfortunately the results have not met expectations.

As NBA training camp approaches, speculation about LeBron James ‚Äô future with the Los Angeles Lakers continues to grow. ESPN insider Shams Charania recently reached out to Klutch Sports founder Rich Paul for clarity on the issue. Earlier this offseason, Paul suggested James could consider leaving if the Lakers did not improve the roster. Since then the team has added new stalwarts, but it is still unclear if that satisfies James‚Äô championship hopes.Reportedly, LeBron James was worried at the start of summer that the Los Angeles Lakers would focus more on Luka Doncic. To support the Luka-LeBron pairing, the Lakers signed DeAndre Ayton, Marcus Smart, and Jake LaRavia.Shams Charania said, ‚ÄúI think the other thing that sits here as well is Bryce James is gonna start his freshman year at college.

According to ESPN‚Äôs Shams Charania, Paul said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs important not to worry about the future when it comes to LeBron James.

Additionally, his key role at Al-Nassr demonstrates how consistent performance in top leagues can accumulate significant wealth over time in the sports world.Sultan Al-Ghannam has earned a net worth of approximately $2.5 million since his appointment to Al-Nassr in 2018, primarily based on his salaries earned through match play and the success of his team.

Furthermore, this revenue demonstrates that Saudi clubs are investing in local talent, enabling stars like him to focus on developing their game and securing a bright financial future.Although he does not currently have significant brand contracts, his increased popularity in the international gaming field and collaborations with teams from various countries may lead to new sponsorship deals in the near future.Additionally, he has a market value of approximately two million euros, which suggests that he may even increase it should he continue to perform well in the upcoming seasons.Also Read: Al Taawoun Thrashes Al Ettifaq in Saudi Pro League Clash: Full-time Scoreline, Key Highlights, and Top Scorers In addition to his income from football, Sultan Al-Ghannam leads a comfortable lifestyle.

Luke Hughes holdout continues during contract standoff with insight from NHL insider Elliotte Friedman

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs collusion or anything like that; but I definitely think there is a ‚Äòwe have to hold the line‚Äô to some level.‚Äù

Ongoing negotiations and what lies ahead for Hughes

As the New Jersey Devils kick off their preseason, defenseman Luke Hughes remains unsigned, extending his holdout into the start of training camp. The 22-year-old, considered one of the team‚Äôs top defensive prospects, is reportedly in contract negotiations with the Devils for a long-term deal. Both sides remain at an impasse over the average annual value, creating uncertainty around Hughes‚Äô participation in upcoming preseason games.The holdout has drawn attention not only for its timing but also for its broader implications on NHL contract negotiations. On the latest(9/22), Elliotte Friedman discussed the situation, highlighting a trend among re-extension eligible stars.Friedman said. Regarding the NHL landscape, he added,The Devils and Hughes‚Äô camp remain focused on structuring a contract that reflects Hughes‚Äô potential as a top-tier defenseman while also adhering to the team‚Äôs salary-cap strategy. Hughes previously missed the first five days of training camp, surpassing last season‚Äôs holdout by Dawson Mercer.The core of the disagreement lies in Hughes‚Äô long-term value versus the team‚Äôs approach to the rising NHL salary cap. Hughes‚Äô agent, Pat Brisson, is reportedly advocating for compensation that reflects Hughes‚Äô ascension as the team‚Äôs future No.1 defenseman, while the Devils aim to manage cap flexibility in a changing market.Even if Hughes does not secure a roster spot immediately, he remains committed to the Devils organization. Analysts note that the passing of the torch from Dougie Hamilton to Hughes may have already begun, as Hughes assumed PP1 duties last season.

Jayson Tatum stays active in rehab as Boston Celtics monitor recovery from Achilles tear

In Game 4 of the Boston Celtics ' second-round playoff loss to the New York Knicks last May, forward Jayson Tatum tore his Achilles tendon. Amidst all this, finally he talked candidly in an interview with People Magazine about his injury. After rupturing his Achilles, he claimed to have sobbed for two hours, wondering if Boston would trade him, whether his career would end, or if he would lose all of his endorsement deals.

He further said:""I literally sat there and cried for two hours 'cause so many things ran through my mind: 'Damn, is my career over? Am I going to get traded? Are all my partners going to drop me?'
