England playing XI for fourth Test vs India:

Poll Is Liam Dawson's inclusion a good decision by the England selectors? Definitely Not sure No, they should have picked someone else

England have confirmed one change to their playing XI for the fourth Test against India at Old Trafford, starting Wednesday. Hampshire all-rounder Liam Dawson replaces the injured Shoaib Bashir, marking his first Test appearance since July 2017.Dawson, a seasoned domestic performer, offers depth with both bat and ball on what is expected to be a spin-friendly surface in Manchester.Dawson steps in for Shoaib Bashir, who suffered a broken finger on his left hand during the first innings of last week's Lord's Test but showed great resilience by taking the final wicket to secure a 2-1 series lead for England. Bashir has since undergone surgery, with a wire inserted into his left pinkie to ensure proper healing. In Bashir's absence, Dawson will earn his fourth Test cap, with his last appearance dating back to July 2017 against South Africa.As a left-arm spinner, Dawson has claimed 371 first-class wickets. He has been particularly impressive in recent seasons, with 12 of his 15 five-wicket hauls—including three ten-wicket matches—coming since 2021. Since the start of the 2023 season, he has taken 124 wickets for Hampshire at an average of 25.64, complemented by 956 runs at 59.75, which earned him the prestigious men's PCA Player of the Year award last year.This summer, Dawson's performance includes 21 wickets at an average of 40.04, with an economy rate of 2.55, along with 536 runs at 44.66. Over the past five seasons, he has scored nine first-class centuries, including three in 2023 and three in 2024.His recent recall to the England squad marks a surprising turnaround, after seeming to have finished his international career. Earlier this summer, he returned to the T20I side after a three-year hiatus, delivering a notable performance of 4 for 20 against the West Indies in his comeback match, captained by England's newly appointed limited-overs captain, Harry Brook.""He's a wily, old fox,"" Brook said at Emirates Old Trafford on Monday. ""He's very experienced and a very skilful cricketer. He's played everywhere, played against everyone so hopefully he can have an amazing performance this week.""As we've seen over the Test series, the footholes have been for the left-handed batters outside off, so hopefully he can land it in the footholes and create a bit of spice and some opportunities to take wickets.""He's willing to always fight for the team, he's very competitive and it's good to have him here."" Zak Crawley , Ben Duckett, Ollie Pope, Joe Root, Harry Brook, Ben Stokes (c), Jamie Smith (wk), Liam Dawson, Chris Woakes, Brydon Carse, Jofra Archer.For India, the spotlight is on Anshul Kamboj, the 24-year-old right-arm pacer who could be in line for a memorable Test debut , as reported earlier by TimesofIndia.com.Called up as injury cover, Kamboj has had a whirlwind few days, joining the team on Saturday, meeting Manchester United players on Sunday, and bowling full tilt in Monday’s net session.He impressed the coaching staff, including Gautam Gambhir and Ajit Agarkar, with his accuracy and relentless line and length against top-order batters like KL Rahul, Shubman Gill, and Yashasvi Jaiswal.India’s pace attack has been hit by fitness issues, with Akash Deep still recovering from a groin strain and Arshdeep Singh ruled out due to a hand injury.This leaves Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Siraj, Shardul Thakur, Prasidh Krishna, and Kamboj as the available seam options. Prasidh’s limited involvement with the new ball during practice hints at a possible debut for Kamboj.Meanwhile, Rishabh Pant has resumed wicketkeeping duties during practice, looking comfortable despite minor discomfort in his left hand.His return behind the stumps is a major boost for India. However, Akash Deep’s fitness test did not go as hoped, making his participation in the Test unlikely.",Liam dawson replaces shoaib bashir in england's playing xi for fourth test.

Poll What impact do you think this policy will have on the 2028 Summer Olympics? Positive, it promotes fairness Negative, it creates division No significant impact

In a sweeping policy shift aligned with a recent federal directive, the United States Olympic and Paralympic Committee (USOPC) has officially barred transgender women from competing in women’s events at the Olympics and Paralympics.The ban, effective July 21, 2025, stems directly from President Donald Trump’s executive order titled “Keeping Men Out of Women’s Sports.” The USOPC updated its Athlete Safety Policy with a new subsection titled “Additional Requirements,” referencing both the executive order and the Ted Stevens Olympic & Amateur Sports Act.""The USOPC is committed to protecting opportunities for athletes participating in sport,"" the policy states. ""We will continue to collaborate with stakeholders... to ensure women have a fair and safe competition environment consistent with Executive Order 14201.""In a memo, USOPC CEO Sarah Hirshland and President Gene Sykes told Team USA athletes: “As a federally chartered organisation, we have an obligation to comply with federal expectations.”Trump’s executive order, issued in February 2025, mandates that any school or institution permitting transgender girls to compete in girls' sports will risk losing federal funding.It requires the immediate enforcement of single-sex sports teams and locker rooms, citing Title IX protections for women’s sports.""Our revised policy emphasises the importance of ensuring fair and safe competition environments for women,"" the USOPC reiterated in its message to national governing bodies, urging all affiliated organisations to align with the new standards.The decision also mirrors changes within the NCAA, which recently revised its transgender participation rules to restrict women's competitions to athletes assigned female at birth.The timing of the policy change is significant, as Los Angeles prepares to host the 2028 Summer Olympics.","The united states olympic and paralympic committee (usopc) has officially barred transgender women from competing in women’s events.

Training camp videos of deep passes to open practice have flooded social media this week. These clips spark hope that big plays are on the way when the NFL season starts in early September. We’re looking at five teams that could make serious progress in their big‑play game in 2025. Some had deep threats last year, others changed coaches or added new weapons. All five have a real shot to be more explosive this year. Let’s dive into why these teams stand out and who to watch when camp opens this July.On July 17, at the Kansas City Chiefs’ offseason workouts in Kansas City, quarterback Patrick Mahomes declared the team will “test the defenses down the field” after a dip in their deep‑ball game. The Kansas City Chiefs added fast rookies like Xavier Worthy, the Combine’s fastest 40‑yard sprinter, and veteran Jaylon Moore at left tackle to give Mahomes more protection. With these moves, Kansas City Chiefs aims to bounce back from a 2024 season that lacked long throws and explosive plays.In June, quarterback Baker Mayfield spoke in Tampa about boosting explosive plays downfield this season. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers ranked second in yards after catch but 29th in average air yards.Now with Chris Godwin returning from injury and rookie Emeka Egbuka joining the roster, Tampa Bay Buccaneers hope to stretch defenses more. If Baker Mayfield can launch deeper throws protected by Tristan Wirfs, even early-season, the Bucs might show off a more dynamic offense.During May OTAs in Atlanta, quarterback coach T.J. Yates praised rookie Michael Penix Jr. for his aggressive arm and field vision. Penix Jr. led the team with a 10.2 average air yards per attempt in the final three 2024 games. With deep threats like Drake London and Darnell Mooney, plus more play-action work, Atlanta Falcons could lean on explosive passes more often this year.In July, at Chicago Bears mini‑camp in Chicago, new coach Ben Johnson said, “I like big plays” and rejected sneak plays like the Tush Push. With rookie QB Caleb Williams, who showed creativity in college, plus upgraded receivers and revamped line, the Chicago Bears aim to transform from last‑place offense into a big‑play threat.When training camp opens in late July in Nevada, the Las Vegas Raiders will debut new coach Pete Carroll alongside coordinator Chip Kelly and veteran QB Geno Smith, known for deep passing. After a stagnant offense in 2024, Las Vegas hopes Geno Smith’s big arm and Carroll’s leadership will bring more vertical plays in 2025.",Training camp videos of deep passes to open practice have flooded social media.

Blackhawks ready to move forward as legal drama around Connor Bedard ’s teammate reportedly coming to an end



Blackhawks is building goaltending depth with an eye on the future



FAQs:



1. What is Connor Bedard's salary?

2. Who is Jeff Blashill?

3. What is Arvid Soderblom's contract details?

As the Chicago Blackhawks prepare for the 2025–26 NHL season, a sense of cautious optimism surrounds the franchise. Under the leadership of Jeff Blashill, the team is determined to sidestep the controversies of recent years and focus on forging a new identity. But just as the winds of change seem ready to blow through the United Center, a contract standoff with goaltender Arvid Soderblom has added an unexpected wrinkle.Unlike previous summers filled with blockbuster trades or headline-making free-agent signings, the Blackhawks chose a more reserved approach this offseason. Rather than chasing stars, the franchise doubled down on its young core—headlined by rising phenom Connor Bedard, and kept the roster mostly intact. It’s a gamble that signals faith in development over short-term splash, but it also leaves the team with minimal margin for error.Still, one pressing matter remains unresolved. After restricted free agent Arvid Soderblom filed for salary arbitration, Chicago was thrust into a tricky spot. The 25-year-old Swedish player seen as a crucial backup option—or even a potential starter down the line—could either negotiate a deal or face a ruling from an NHL arbitrator.Letting him walk into unrestricted free agency? Unlikely.“The Blackhawks have over $21 million in cap space, so it is likely they will settle with Soderblom on a one-year deal,” Michael Augello reported via The Hockey News. That room gives Chicago a clear upper hand in keeping him without significant financial strain. Yet, in a league where planning for the unexpected is essential, the front office isn’t leaving anything to chance.While Arvid Soderblom’s situation unfolds, the Blackhawks have already started insulating themselves. The recent signing of Stanislav Berezhnoy to a two-year entry-level contract offers a fallback, signaling that the team has no intention of being caught off guard. Add in the presence of Spencer Knight—brought in at last season’s deadline and primed to be the franchise’s starting goalie—and the depth chart starts to take shape.Behind Knight is 23-year-old Drew Commesso, whose limited NHL experience is offset by raw potential and hunger to earn his spot. Together, this trio represents the Hawks’ commitment to a competitive future, even if growing pains remain.With leadership recalibrated and youth as their backbone, the Blackhawks hope to usher in a new era—one where off-ice drama no longer overshadows on-ice potential.In 2025-26, Bedard will earn a base salary of $855,000 and a signing bonus of $95,000, while carrying a cap hit of $950,000.Jeff Blashill has been appointed as the new head coach of the Chicago Blackhawks. He previously served as an assistant coach with the Tampa Bay Lightning from 2022 to 2025, following his tenure as head coach of the Detroit Red Wings from 2015 to 2022.Arvid Soderblom signed a 2 year, $1,925,000 contract with the Chicago Blackhawks on May 10, 2023, with an average annual salary of $962500.Also Read: Connor McDavid’s next team already decided?

Jonas Valanciunas’ Expected Role with the Denver Nuggets

NBA Over EuroLeague—for Now

has officially confirmed that he will stay with the Denver Nuggets for the 2025-26 NBA season, putting an end to growing speculation about a possible return to European basketball. The 6-foot-11 Lithuanian center turned down a lucrative three-year offer worth nearly €12 million (around $36 million) from Greek EuroLeague giants Panathinaikos, choosing instead to honor his current NBA contract.In a statement to BasketNews.com, Valanciunas addressed the situation directly: “I want to clear the air about my playing situation next season now that Denver has made their decision to keep me. The idea of playing for Panathinaikos, closer to home, was very exciting to me, but that will have to wait. I am fully committed to honoring my contract with the Denver Nuggets this season and will give it my all to compete for a championship. ” Jonas Valanciunas was acquired by the Denver Nuggets in a July 2025 trade with the Sacramento Kings that sent Dario Šarić to California. The move was made to add veteran size and toughness next to MVP Nikola Jokić in the frontcourt. According to Nuggets executive VP of basketball operations Ben Tenzer, discussions with Valanciunas and his representatives were smooth, and there were “no concerns” about him showing up for training camp.The 33-year-old is entering the final guaranteed year of his contract, worth $10.4 million. There is also a non-guaranteed $10 million team option for the 2026-27 season. With Denver ruling out any potential buyout, the only route for an early exit would have been a holdout—something Valanciunas has decisively shut down.Jonas Valanciunas is coming off a solid season split between the Washington Wizards and Sacramento Kings , averaging 10.4 points, 7.7 rebounds, and 2 assists per game across 81 appearances. He also shot 55% from the field and nearly 88% from the free-throw line. Denver plans to use him primarily as a reliable backup to Jokić, who logged a career-high 36.7 minutes per game last season. His presence is expected to solidify the second unit and reduce the MVP’s workload.This move finalizes an active offseason for Denver’s front office, which also added Cameron Johnson, brought back Bruce Brown, and signed veteran scorer Tim Hardaway Jr. The front office, led by Tenzer and GM Jonathan Wallace, is clearly focused on building a deeper roster after last season’s narrow playoff exit.Jonas Valanciunas is also preparing to represent Lithuania at the upcoming FIBA EuroBasket, which Denver officials may use as an opportunity to monitor his form and conditioning. Though the temptation of playing closer to home in the EuroLeague was strong, the veteran center remains locked in on competing at the NBA level.In reaffirming his commitment, Valanciunas has provided clarity not only for Denver’s front office and fans but also for the EuroLeague market. His decision highlights a dedication to honoring his current NBA obligations while keeping the door open for a potential European return down the line.Also read: Lakers Rumor: Dalton Knecht’s Trade Value Reportedly Tanks After Disappointing Summer League Showing With Los Angeles For now, Jonas' focus is clear and that is to help the Denver Nuggets contend for another title.",Jonas valanciunas has confirmed that he will stay with the denver nuggets for the 2025-26 nba season.

How He Fits Into Darvin Ham’s System

A Perfect Fit with Marcus Smart in the Los Angeles Lakers

Competition in the Market

Los Angeles Lakers’ Urgency and Roster Implications

has quickly become one of the most intriguing names left in NBA free agency. According to NBA insider Evan Sidery, theare among five teams actively pursuing the defensive standout, joining the Milwaukee Bucks, Miami Heat, Phoenix Suns, and Golden State Warriors in the race for his signature.For a Lakers team that struggled with perimeter defense last season and often lacked energy off the bench, Gary Payton II checks several important boxes. Known for his relentless on-ball pressure and ability to disrupt offensive flow, Payton would immediately upgrade the team’s defensive identity.The Lakers’ recent playoff exits have underscored a need for two-way players who can stay on the floor in high-stakes moments. While Payton isn’t a high-volume scorer, his hustle, versatility, and winning pedigree make him a strong fit for a roster still built around LeBron James and Luka Doncic.Despite not being a featured option on offense, Gary Payton II was highly efficient in his minutes during the 2024-25 season.These numbers show that while Payton isn’t a primary scorer, he brings elite efficiency and consistency in his role—something the Lakers bench lacked at times last season.Darvin Ham has placed a premium on defensive intensity and switchability, and Payton fits perfectly into that vision. His ability to guard multiple positions and generate fast-break opportunities would allow Ham to deploy more aggressive defensive schemes, especially when resting starters.One of the Los Angeles Lakers’ biggest offseason moves was the acquisition of Marcus Smart, a former Defensive Player of the Year. Adding Gary Payton II to the backcourt would give Los Angeles two of the best perimeter defenders in the league—a nightmare scenario for opposing guards.Defensive Impact: Smart + Payton Duo- Both are elite at generating steals and deflections- High basketball IQ allows seamless switching in defensive rotations- Toughness, leadership, and hustle traits shared by both- Capable of guarding 1-3 positions, allowing LeBron and AD to conserve energy- Both thrive in chaotic, high-effort defensive settingsWith Smart operating as the primary floor general and defensive leader, Payton could play the role of an energizer—disrupting passing lanes, pushing the pace, and covering elite scorers. Their chemistry could quickly turn the Lakers’ backcourt into one of the most feared defensive tandems in the NBA.Evan Sidery’s report confirms that the Los Angeles Lakers aren’t alone in their interest: “The Milwaukee Bucks, Miami Heat, Los Angeles Lakers, Phoenix Suns, and Golden State Warriors are all keeping tabs on the defensive-minded guard,” wrote Sidery.The Suns could use Payton’s defense to bolster their second unit behind a star-studded starting five, while the Heat and Bucks view him as a glue guy who fits seamlessly into a contender’s culture. Meanwhile, the Warriors remain a sentimental and tactical destination, given Payton’s championship history with the franchise.With limited cap flexibility, the Los Angeles Lakers must act quickly if they want to land Payton. He wouldn’t command a massive deal, making him a financially smart addition who could thrive in Los Angeles’ structured yet fast-paced system.If acquired, Payton would likely slot in as a key rotational guard, sharing minutes with Gabe Vincent and Jalen Hood-Schifino, while also offering injury insurance for defensive assignments in critical games.The Los Angeles Lakers’ reported interest in Gary Payton II isn’t just about stats—it’s about identity. A player who embraces defense, plays with intensity, and has a winning background aligns with everything the franchise hopes to reestablish after a turbulent season.Also read: Lakers Rumor: Dalton Knecht’s Trade Value Reportedly Tanks After Disappointing Summer League Showing With Los Angeles Adding Payton alongside Marcus Smart could create one of the grittiest and most disruptive backcourts in the NBA—a defensive pairing that would instantly raise the Lakers’ championship ceiling.

Recently, Los Angeles Lakers LeBron James was spotted with Jeff Bezos and his wife, Lauren Sanchez . At a star-studded party in Cannes this week, the NBA star was seen rapping to Kendrick Lamar 's Not Like Us at the upscale Le Guerite Beach Club, where celebrities like Jay-Z and Beyonce have previously been spotted having parties. This seemingly didn’t look good for Drake as the track was created to diss him. The situation was made worse by the fact that Lauren Sanchez and Jeff Bezos were also vibing to the track. LeBron James and Kendrick Lamar have mutual admiration for one another.

Vladimir Orszagh’s journey from player to Olympic coach

Early, rather than mature, 2026 Olympic roster composition in balance with a mix of experience and youth



FAQs

1. Why did Vladimir Orszagh replace Craig Ramsay?

2. What NHL experience does Vladimir Orszagh have?

3. When will the rest of Slovakia’s Olympic roster be announced?

Through the year 2026, the Slovak path toward the Winter Olympics will form a new chapter in the book behind the coaching bench. Former NHL forward Vladimir Orszagh was appointed head coach after many years of international and professional experience. The decision follows his interim head coach role at the 2025 IIHF World Championship and is another signal from the Slovak hockey authorities toward planning. With NHL players returning for the Olympics, Slovakia now hopes to regain the bronze medal-winning form under his stewardship from 2022.In his first act as the full-time head coach, replacing an ailing Ramsay toward the end of the 2025 World Championship, Vladimir Orszagh now takes the helm for the upcoming Olympics. Slovakia ranked 11th out of 16 in that tournament-they were hardly at their best-but it gave Orszagh that great international experience. He knows the national setup well as the former assistant coach to Ramsay during the 2018 Olympics and several World Championship campaigns.Orszagh's coaching bio will tell you that he spent the 2022-23 season coaching in the top-tier league in Slovakia, Banská Bystrica, in his second season.As a player, he had a solid career, producing 119 points in 289 NHL contests from 1997 through 2006 with the New York Islanders, Nashville Predators, and St. Louis Blues. Orszagh competed internationally for Slovakia five times at the World Championships and also at the 2004 World Cup of Hockey.Slovakia has already named six Olympic roster players worthy of mention for having NHL years behind them as defense, while promising forwards are being named to the team. Erik Cernak, Martin Fehervary, and Simon Nemec will take care of the blue line, while the offensive line of Martin Pospisil, Juraj Slafkovsky, and veteran Tomas Tatar will soak up the glory. With a few more announcements to come later this year, this core group already shows that Slovakia wants to mix the old with the young on the big stage.The event to be held from February 11 to 22 will be the return of Slovakia to NHL-level Olympic-level competitions. The team will seek, under Orszagh, to follow in the footsteps of finishing 3rd at the event in 2022 or any better ranking.Also Read: Yegor Chinakhov’s trade request opens the door for the Colorado Avalanche opportunity Vladimir Orszagh’s promotion brought about a major turn for Slovakian ice hockey, melding experiences from different segments of both on-ice and coaching.

has reignited the never-ending GOAT debate by declaring thatknows he will never surpass—not because of talent or longevity, but due to Jordan’s unmatched legacy, emotional impact, and cultural power.Despite LeBron’s historic career and statistical dominance, Cowherd argues the gap between the two legends remains rooted in intangibles Jordan still owns.Colin Cowherd pinpointed three main areas where Michael Jordan remains untouchable:- Brand Power: Jordan’s Air Jordan empire isn’t just a shoe line—it’s a global phenomenon. Cowherd called it “the most powerful marketing campaign in sports history,” noting that LeBron James, despite immense commercial success, hasn’t reached that same transcendent level of influence.- Emotional Connection: Michael Jordan, Cowherd says, “makes you feel something.” His clutch performances and larger-than-life persona created a legacy that goes beyond numbers—a deep, emotional bond with fans that remains strong decades later.- Loyalty and Identity: Cowherd contrasted Jordan’s commitment to the Chicago Bulls with LeBron James’ team-hopping path. While LeBron sought the best basketball situations, Michael Jordan built his dynasty with one team, further cementing his mythos.To be clear, Colin Cowherd gave LeBron James his due. He acknowledged LeBron’s incredible durability and elite play into his 40s, something even Cowherd once said wouldn’t happen. In his 22nd season, LeBron remains one of the league’s top performers, disproving early doubts about his staying power.Cowherd also stated that LeBron may have the most complete resume in basketball history, with All-Star appearances, championships, MVPs, and records piling up year after year.Cowherd illustrated the contrast between Michael Jordan and LeBron James through a pop culture analogy, comparing Jordan toand LeBron to. He described Jordan as—short-lived but iconic, unforgettable, and still a cultural landmark years after its original run. In contrast, LeBron was likened to—a long-running, steady presence that remains relevant but lacks the same explosive cultural moment. This analogy captures how many fans perceive the two legends: Jordan as the singular, unforgettable phenomenon, and LeBron as the enduring force of consistency.Colin Cowherd also criticized LeBron James’ decision to opt into a lucrative deal with the Lakers , claiming it limits the franchise’s ability to build a title-contending roster. He suggested that LeBron may now be prioritizing financial security over chasing a final championship, a shift from the “championship or bust” mentality Michael Jordan represented.Fans and analysts have called for Cowherd to walk back some of his past takes, especially those doubting LeBron’s longevity. But Cowherd stands firm—respecting LeBron’s greatness while still placing Jordan on a higher tier when it comes to legacy and cultural relevance.In Cowherd’s view, LeBron’s greatness lies in performance and longevity, but Michael Jordan’s GOAT status is built on unmatched brand appeal, emotional depth, and singular loyalty. While LeBron James continues to break records, Cowherd believes even he knows that the emotional magic and cultural legacy of Michael Jordan remains unmatched.Also read: Los Angeles Lakers Reportedly Among Five Contenders Eyeing $26.2 Million Golden State Warriors Star in Free Agency The debate will rage on—but Colin Cowherd’s latest comments offer a compelling lens: in the battle between longevity and legend, Jordan still holds the edge.","Colin cowherd has reignited the never-ending goat debate by declaring thatknows he will never surpass.

Los Angeles Rams take no chances as Jimmy Garoppolo steps in and Matthew Stafford rests to manage back soreness

Jimmy Garoppolo takes the reins at Los Angeles Rams camp, but Matthew Stafford’s hold on QB1 stays firm

The Los Angeles Rams opened 2025 training camp in Thousand Oaks this week without their longtime quarterback under center. Matthew Stafford, now entering his 17th NFL season and fifth with the Rams, is dealing with back soreness—a recurring issue that has prompted a precautionary pause. Instead of participating in drills, Stafford is working off to the side, part of a deliberately modified schedule the team hopes will extend his durability through the regular season. While fans might flinch at the word “back,” head coach Sean McVay isn’t sounding any alarms—he’s doubling down on experience and patience.Speaking to reporters at camp on Monday, July 22, Los Angeles Rams head coach Sean McVay explained the logic behind Stafford’s absence from early training sessions. “He’s been throwing, feeling good. It’s not anything that’s necessarily new — something that he’s dealt with before,” McVay said.Rather than push Matthew Stafford through discomfort, the team has scheduled a ramp-up period lasting the first five or so days of camp. “Going into Year 17, we were going to take a modified approach with him, kind of similar to what we did in the offseason program,” McVay added.The Los Angeles Rams’ approach reflects both Stafford’s medical history and his deep command of the offense.McVay emphasized that if this were a younger quarterback, the story might be different. “If he was a first-year player, then I think you’d say, man, every rep really matters,” he said. “But because of his ability to communicate to me, to [the training staff], I feel really good.”The Rams were already planning to rest Stafford every fourth day during camp, making this adjustment an extension of that long-view strategy.Until Stafford returns later in camp, Jimmy Garoppolo is taking first-team reps. Now in his second season with the Rams, Garoppolo offers security in a pinch and is expected to lead early practices while Stafford works individually.“You do feel fortunate that you’ve got a guy like Jimmy that will step in and do a great job for the first few practices. And then Matthew will be ready to roll,” McVay said.Stafford, who turns 38 in February, threw for 3,762 yards with 20 touchdowns and 8 interceptions last season. The Rams rested him in Week 18 after clinching the NFC West—a move similar in tone to this one.“He feels good about that, I feel good about that,” McVay said. “Ultimately, it’s about having him feel as good as possible — mentally, physically, emotionally — going into Year 17.”With Stafford sidelined to start camp, the Rams aren’t sweating the optics—they’re sticking to the plan. McVay’s messaging is clear: this is about preserving their veteran leader, not replacing him. As the team builds toward Week 1, Stafford’s rest today is part of ensuring he’s ready tomorrow. Training camp may have started without its star quarterback under center, but the Rams are betting that patience in July pays off when it counts in September.Also Read: Russell Wilson won’t save the New York Giants—but Brian Daboll is counting on him to fix them",The los angeles rams opened training camp this week without their longtime quarterback under center.

However, for Golden State, this isn’t just about plugging a gap — it’s about bringing back a familiar face who already understands their system and championship culture.From the Golden State Warriors ’ viewpoint, a potential return of Gary Payton II makes more than just sentimental sense. He was a key piece during their 2022 title run, anchoring the perimeter defense and injecting energy whenever he stepped on the floor. The Warriors know exactly what Payton brings — and that kind of reliability is hard to find in free agency.Last season, Payton played 62 games and put up the following stats:While his scoring numbers may not jump off the page, it’s Payton’s defensive prowess and hustle plays that make him invaluable — especially for a Warriors roster in need of better point-of-attack defense.With the Golden State Warriors aiming to maximize the remainder of Stephen Curry ’s prime, every move this offseason carries weight. Adding a player like Payton — who already knows the Warriors’ playbook and thrives in a fast-paced, switch-heavy defensive scheme — could solidify their second unit and help bridge the gap between stars and role players.The Phoenix Suns have also emerged as a prominent suitor. According to the data available, the Suns made 14.3 three-pointers per game last season, shooting 37.8% from beyond the arc. Payton’s addition could bring them more balance defensively, but it’s unclear if Phoenix can offer him the same opportunity — or familiarity — that Golden State can.It’s not just about the numbers. Gary Payton II is deeply connected to the Golden State Warriors’ identity — and they know how to use him effectively. His last stint in the Bay Area proved he could thrive under Steve Kerr’s system, playing a hybrid guard-forward role and often defending the opponent’s best perimeter scorer.Sidery reports that Payton’s return to Golden State is “a possibility,” indicating that the front office remains open to bringing him back into the fold.“The Milwaukee Bucks, Miami Heat, Los Angeles Lakers, Phoenix Suns, and Golden State Warriors are all keeping tabs on the defensive-minded guard,” wrote Evan Sidery, outlining the level of league-wide interest.For the Golden State Warriors, bringing back Gary Payton II isn’t just about nostalgia — it’s a strategic move that could solidify their bench defense and add a trusted locker room presence. As free agency continues to unfold, Golden State remains in the hunt, hoping that familiarity, fit, and the lure of another title run can tip the scales in their favor.Also read: Colin Cowherd Claims LeBron James Has Accepted He’ll Never Surpass Michael Jordan’s Legacy: ""MJ makes you feel something but LJ Doesn't"" With contenders circling, the next few days may determine whether Payton suits up in blue and gold once again — or becomes a defensive anchor elsewhere.",The golden state warriors may be looking at a reunion with gary payton ii.
