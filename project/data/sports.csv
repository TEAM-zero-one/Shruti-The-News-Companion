Team India are set to pocket a record-breaking sum from the International Cricket Council (ICC) following their historic victory in the Women’s World Cup 2025 final against South Africa at the DY Patil Stadium on Sunday.With the win, India not only lifted their maiden Women’s World Cup title but also secured the highest-ever prize money in the history of cricket - a whopping USD 4.48 million (Rs 39.78 crore).The amount is part of a total tournament pool of USD 13.88 million (about Rs 123 crore), which was announced by the ICC ahead of the event. This was a whopping 297 per cent increase from the USD 3.5 million purse at the 2022 edition in New Zealand.The winners’ prize of USD 4.48 million represents a 239 per cent jump from the USD 1.32 million that Australia received for winning the last edition, while runners-up South Africa will earn USD 2.24 million (Rs 19.88 crore).Each losing semi-finalist is entitled to USD 1.12 million (Rs 9.94 crore), while all eight teams were guaranteed USD 250,000 for participation, plus an additional USD 34,314 for every group-stage win.According to a PTI report, the BCCI is also considering matching the prize and bonuses that the men’s team received after their T20 World Cup 2024 win.A senior BCCI source told PTI, “The BCCI supports equal pay for men and women and hence there are lot of discussions that if our girls win the World Cup, the reward won't be anything less compared to the men's global triumph. But it isn't nice to make an announcement before they win the Cup.”The Rohit Sharma-led men’s team was awarded ₹125 crore for their T20 World Cup victory last year, a figure that could now serve as a benchmark for the women’s side following their landmark success.As the celebrations continue in Navi Mumbai, India’s triumph, and the record prize it brings marks a defining moment for women’s cricket and reflects the ICC’s stated goal of “a world-class Women’s Cricket World Cup” and “a clear commitment to long-term growth.”The final saw Team India women defeat Laura Wolvaardt's South Africa by 52 runs in Navi Mumbai.","India women secured a historic win at dy patil stadium in navi mumbai to secure a record sum in prize money from the icc.

NEW DELHI: Two of the world’s most influential tech leaders — Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella — joined millions of Indians in celebrating the country’s greatest moment in women’s cricket. As India lifted their maiden ICC Women’s World Cup trophy after a thrilling 52-run win over South Africa in Navi Mumbai on Sunday, the Silicon Valley titans, both ardent cricket fans, took to social media to express their pride and admiration.For Pichai, the victory evoked memories of India’s most cherished cricketing triumphs. “That was a nail-biting Women's World Cup cricket final, memories of 1983 and 2011 indeed,” he wrote on X. “Congrats to Team India, am sure will inspire a whole generation. Great tournament from South Africa too!”Nadella echoed the sentiment, calling it a day when “legends were born.” Applauding both finalists, he posted, “Women in Blue = World Champions! Respect to South Africa for making their first-ever final. A truly historic day for women’s cricket — new chapters written, barriers broken, legends born.”The victory marked a watershed moment for Indian women’s cricket, ending decades of near-misses.

The fiery five-emoji comment from Kara Bieber under Sofia Castaneda’s World Series post had Blue Jays fans buzzing online

From the field to the feeds, the Blue Jays wives are winning hearts their own way

Toronto Blue Jays catcher Alejandro Kirk has been one of the key performers in the team’s World Series campaign against the Los Angeles Dodgers, driving in crucial runs and proving his consistency when it matters most. After helping the Blue Jays win the AL East title for the first time since 2015, Kirk’s bat has stayed hot into the postseason, where he has already hit two home runs and driven in six RBIs in five games. As much as the spotlight has stayed on his performance, it was his wife, Sofia Castaneda, who found herself trending recently after she shared a few glimpses from her time at Game 5 — a post that unexpectedly set social media abuzz across Blue Jays circles.Sofia, who has been a constant presence at the Rogers Centre and on the road, posted a carousel of images on Instagram showing her cheering for her husband from the stands during Wednesday night’s Game 5. The post, captioned “Recent > 🤍”, quickly drew reactions from fans and fellow players’ families alike. But it was Shane Bieber’s wife, Kara Bieber, whose fiery comment — “🔥🔥🔥🔥❤️” — turned the post into a viral moment overnight.Without a single word, Kara’s five-emoji reaction summed up both her excitement for Kirk’s performance and her admiration for Sofia’s unwavering support, sparking a flood of comments and likes from fans across the Blue Jays community.Within hours, the post became one of the most talked-about moments from the Blue Jays’ social media circle this postseason. Fans flooded the comment section, praising the show of friendship between the two players’ wives and calling it “the most wholesome Blue Jays moment of the year.” The exchange highlighted the close-knit camaraderie among players’ families — a side of professional sports rarely seen in such a lighthearted, genuine way.As the Blue Jays continue their chase for a long-awaited World Series crown, Kirk’s red-hot form has been mirrored by the rising visibility of the team’s wives and partners, who’ve brought a sense of unity and charm to the postseason narrative. Kara’s reaction may have lasted just five emojis, but it carried the same energy and warmth that Blue Jays fans have been rallying behind. And for a team chasing its first championship in nearly 30 years, that blend of on-field brilliance and off-field bonding might just be what defines their season. In a season full of big hits and bigger moments, it's these small gestures that keep fans smiling. And as the World Series drama unfolds, Blue Jays fans are loving every bit of it. Moments like this remind everyone that baseball's heart beats far beyond the field.Also Read: Dave Roberts’ unexpected race with Hyeseong Kim at Dodgers’ camp spirals into a hilarious moment fans can’t stop talking about","Toronto blue jays catcher alejandro kirk has been one of the key performers in the team’s world series campaign against the los angeles dodgers.

“Those songs hit her hard”: Blake Lively reportedly crushed after hearing Taylor Swift’s new songs as Travis Kelce helps fuel album buzz,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/those-songs-hit-her-hard-blake-lively-reportedly-crushed-after-hearing-taylor-swifts-new-songs-as-travis-kelce-helps-fuel-album-buzz/articleshow/125015013.cms,"A reported rift between close friends Blake Lively and Taylor Swift is causing a stir, fueled by speculation surrounding Swift's new album. Fans are dissecting song titles and lyrics, believing they allude to Lively, intensifying rumors of a fallout. This alleged distance challenges the perception of Swift's seemingly unbreakable inner circle, raising concerns about professional repercussions for Lively.

The album rollout raises suspicion as fans attach meaning to specific tracks





Why this fracture hits different in celebrity culture





Hollywood friendships have always lived in a strange middle ground, they look unbreakable when cameras flash, yet they can shatter just as easily under the pressure of personal choices, creative control, and the public’s hunger to connect dots. That is why the reported rift between Blake Lively and Taylor Swift feels bigger than a typical celebrity cold patch.This isn’t a pair of distant acquaintances, this is a friendship that once looked bulletproof, from Swift becoming godmother to Lively’s children to their quiet but consistent show of support for each other during their heaviest career chapters. But since the release of Swift’s latest album The Life of a Showgirl, internet sleuthing and lyrics speculation has made their silent distance impossible to ignore.According to Radar Online, “Blake is devastated – this isn’t something she can easily move past.” And that is where things become more layered. The speculation is not rooted in coincidence, Swift herself personally revealed titles like Ruin the Friendship and CANCELLED! on fiancé Travis Kelce ’s New Heights podcast, which only intensified theories before a single track was heard.“Hearing those songs has hit her hard, and seeing people online convinced they’re about her just makes it even more painful,” the source added.Add to that, fans believe certain lines from “CANCELLED!” read like surgical references to Blake’s year tied to legal tension with Justin Baldoni. It doesn’t matter that Swift never names her, the public is convinced the arrows are labeled.This isn’t just about lyrics or an album cycle. This story is ripping at a cultural myth: that Swift’s inner circle is impenetrable. In a celebrity ecosystem where reputation is currency, Blake reportedly fears the professional splashback, because Swift’s silent distancing doesn’t stay silent for long.If this friendship is truly done, the end isn’t loud. It’s subtle, strategic, and eerily poetic.Also Read: Taylor Swift’s choreographer exposes her past struggles — from stage anxiety to finding confidence with Travis Kelce by her side","A reported rift between close friends blake lively and taylor swift is causing a stir, fueled by speculation surrounding swift's new album.

Wrestling veteran gave his take on AEW presenting Nixon Newell and Miranda Alize as a couple

“For years and years and years, there have been women who have wanted to do the thing where the women kiss and everything like that and they’re lovers and all that,”

“And Tony and Mina are doing it actually.”

“But in this case it’s like—this is not ambiguous, this is not teased, this is just—they’re lovers and that’s it. You know, they were kissing in the match, and it wasn’t done i

n a WWE way, you know what I mean? Where it’s, ‘oh my God, look at this!’ or for shock value or anything.

They were just doing it.”

AEW has become a primary name in the professional wrestling industry, emerging as a direct competitor to the Sports Entertainment Juggernaut, WWE . They took things to a new level by taking a major step forward in LGBTQ+ representation on a recent episode of Collision. It saw Nixon Newell and Miranda Alize square off against Megan Bayne and Marina Shafir. Although they were defeated in a squash match, it was a particular moment that had the wrestling world talking.Newell and Alize shocked the audience by sharing a passionate kiss in the middle of the ring. This clearly solidified them as a proper couple on television. For the unversed, Nixon Newell and Miranda Alize are a real-life couple and have now presented their sexual preference on a platform like All Elite Wrestling.In the latest edition of the Wrestling Observer Radio, Dave Meltzer stated that it was a rare presentation for a wrestling program; however, top AEW stars Toni Storm and Mina Shirakawa have been doing it for a long time. He said,Meltzer said.However, in the case of Nixon Newell, and Miranda Alize, Meltzer simply stated that they were lovers and it was not a dramatic or controversial moment presented by AEW on their television.In mainstream wrestling scene, a lot of same gender romantic moments have been presented. In WWE, stars like Trish Stratus and Mickie James were involved in a storyline that garnered major attention back in mid 2000s. Moreover, AEW has been dropping such instances with Toni Storm and Mina Shirakawa, but they are more presented as friends than lovers.With the real-life couple of Nixon Newell and Miranda Alize causing a stir with one moment, it remains to be seen if AEW will continue the momentum with a proper storyline moving forward.Also read: 'It’s been 22 years'- WWE NXT star hints at taking revenge from John Cena for his father","Wrestling veteran dave meltzer gave his take on aew presenting nixon newell and miranda alize as a couple.

Leon Draisaitl and Connor McDavid look to spark Oilers’ comeback





The Edmonton Oilers’ 4-3 overtime loss to the New York Rangers didn’t sit well with Leon Draisaitl , who questioned a key officiating decision that shifted the momentum late in the game. The controversy erupted when Rangers forward Mika Zibanejad high-sticked Jack Roslovic, leaving him bleeding on the ice. Despite clear contact, officials awarded only a two-minute minor penalty, sparking debate over the call.With the game tied 3-3, the Oilers went on a short power play that carried into overtime, but they couldn’t convert. Moments later, the Rangers scored the game-winner, handing Edmonton another frustrating defeat. What should have been a four-minute double minor became one of the night’s biggest talking points and Draisaitl didn’t hold back when asked about it afterward. For Leon Draisaitl and the Oilers, the defeat highlights growing frustration with crucial calls affecting key NHL matchups.“No, not sure. It doesn’t make a lot of sense, but yeah, it is what it is,” Draisaitl said postgame, clearly unhappy with the officials’ explanation. His remarks echoed the feeling among Oilers fans, who believed the team was shortchanged in a pivotal moment. The decision not only cost Edmonton valuable time on the man advantage but also stalled their late-game momentum.Still, Draisaitl didn’t blame the referees entirely. He pointed out that turnovers and poor puck management were major factors in the loss. “Just not clean enough with the puck. Turnovers just kind of turned the game a little bit. So yeah, just have to clean that up,” he admitted.The Oilers have now dropped three of their last five games, slipping to fourth in the Pacific Division with a 5-4-3 record. Despite standout performances from Draisaitl and Connor McDavid, Edmonton’s inconsistency and missed chances continue to hurt them. With McDavid and Draisaitl carrying the offensive load, Edmonton’s playoff hopes hinge on tightening their defensive structure and improving special teams efficiency. As they prepare for upcoming Western Conference matchups, the Oilers will need more discipline, sharper execution, and better focus to turn close games into wins.The Oilers’ upcoming schedule offers little room for error, with back-to-back tests against tough Western Conference rivals. These matchups will serve as a true measure of Edmonton’s resilience after a string of frustrating results.A stronger defensive effort and improved puck management will be vital if the Oilers hope to reassert themselves as playoff contenders. With Connor McDavid and Leon Draisaitl leading the charge, Edmonton’s ability to generate consistent offense and limit costly turnovers could define their playoff push. With the season still young, Draisaitl and McDavid’s leadership will be key in steering the team back on track before early setbacks start to shape their campaign.Also Read: Ryan Kesler sexual misconduct case: Meet the wife standing strong by ex-NHL star amid the scandal","Edmonton oilers lost 4-3 to the new york rangers in overtime.

Shohei Ohtani's rare Game 7 moment sparks fiery exchange as Toronto Blue Jays' manager John Schneider confronts umpire in World Series showdown,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/mlb/news/shohei-ohtanis-rare-game-7-moment-sparks-fiery-exchange-as-toronto-blue-jays-manager-john-schneider-confronts-umpire-in-world-series-showdown/articleshow/125028328.cms,"Shohei Ohtani (Image via: IG/X)

John Schneider fumes as Shohei Ohtani's extended warm-up after batting breaks World Series rhythm

Ohtani makes history as first pitcher in 50 years to record a Game 7 hit



Fairness debate resurfaces as Ohtani’s two-way brilliance stretches baseball’s boundaries

When the lights burned brightest in Game 7 of the World Series on Saturday, tensions quietly flickered beneath the surface. Toronto Blue Jays manager John Schneider was seen speaking at length with home plate umpire Jordan Baker right after the first inning, in a moment that fans instantly picked up on. His expression said it all — calm but clearly bothered — as cameras zoomed in during the short break before the second inning began.The reason behind the exchange wasn’t immediately clear to spectators, but it soon became evident that it centered around Shohei Ohtani — the Los Angeles Dodgers’ two-way sensation who was both hitting and pitching in the championship decider. Ohtani had taken extra time to warm up before taking the mound, a move that some felt disrupted the rhythm of the inning and gave him an added edge. FOX broadcaster John Smoltz observed that Ohtani’s warm-up lasted nearly three minutes, far exceeding the usual 90-second window allotted to starting pitchers.That timing discrepancy was enough to frustrate Schneider, who appeared to believe the umpires were allowing Ohtani too much leeway. Though the conversation between the Blue Jays manager and Baker never grew heated, it reflected the razor-thin margins that define a Game 7.Every extra second, every small allowance, feels amplified when the championship is on the line. Ohtani’s rare two-way presence has often bent baseball’s norms, but this particular instance — in the heart of the World Series — sparked fresh debate over fairness and consistency.Even amid the subtle controversy, Ohtani added another historic line to his résumé. The Japanese star became the first pitcher since 1975 to both start a Game 7 and record a hit, breaking a 50-year drought in spectacular fashion. His single in the top of the first didn’t drive in runs, but it showcased the balance of power and precision that defines his game. The Blue Jays, however, survived the early scare and headed into the bottom half of the inning with momentum intact.When Ohtani finally took the mound, he backed up the hype with dominance. He struck out two of Toronto’s most dangerous hitters, including Vladimir Guerrero Jr., before catcher Will Smith threw out George Springer attempting to steal second base. Springer’s bewildered look as he walked back to the dugout captured the frustration — Ohtani was dictating the pace of the night.While the first-inning tension subsided quickly, it reignited an old question in baseball: how should the rules adapt to a player who breaks every mold? Ohtani’s ability to hit and pitch in the same game, especially on a stage as colossal as Game 7, challenges the sport’s traditional rhythms.As the Dodgers chased history and the Blue Jays fought to hold ground, that brief pause between innings became a symbol of Ohtani’s wider impact. He’s not only changing how games are played — he’s forcing baseball itself to evolve around him. And in the process, even a small warm-up delay was enough to light up a night that already had the world watching.For millions of fans across the globe, it was a reminder that when Shohei Ohtani steps on the field, baseball stops being routine - it becomes a moment in history, unforgettable.Also read: Shane Bieber’s wife Kara’s fiery reaction to Alejandro Kirk’s wife Sofia Castaneda’s World Series post sparks buzz among Blue Jays fans","Shohei ohtani became the first pitcher since 1975 to both start a game 7 and record a hit, breaking a 50-year drought in spectacular fashion.

Max Muncy’s no-doubt homer in Toronto proves why he remains Dodgers’ clutch powerhouse

Fans celebrate the Muncys as baseball’s most ‘real’ couple — funny, fiery, and full of heart



Los Angeles Dodgers slugger Max Muncy and his wife Kellie Muncy gave fans a double treat — one from the heart and one from the plate. While Max crushed a no-doubt home run that rocked Toronto and reignited the Dodgers’ hopes, Kellie went viral with a funny, perfectly-timed Instagram Story that summed up the spirit of postseason chaos.Her post, captioned “Perfectly describes how I’m surviving October (+November),” instantly resonated with fans who have lived through every nerve-wracking inning of playoff baseball. The timing couldn’t have been more poetic. Just as Kellie’s witty post started making waves online, Max delivered one of his most memorable at-bats of the season — a thunderous homer that slashed the Blue Jays’ lead and reminded everyone why he remains one of the Dodgers’ most clutch power hitters. It was the kind of day that blended baseball and humor, showing how the Muncys — both on and off the field — have become a fan-favorite duo in Los Angeles.Kellie’s lighthearted Story struck a chord with Dodgers Nation. Her “October survival” caption reflected exactly how fans feel during the nerve-wracking postseason grind — tense, exhausted, and laughing their way through it all. Her ability to turn the stress of the game into a moment of humor showed why the Muncys connect so deeply with fans beyond the diamond.While Kellie brought smiles, Max delivered the fireworks. The Dodgers’ veteran infielder went 3-for-4 at the plate, tallying one home run, three RBIs, and one run, alongside a walk — a complete offensive showcase that re-energized the dugout. His towering blast, described by commentators as a “no-doubter” the instant it left his bat, cut Toronto’s lead to one and sent a surge of adrenaline through the visiting fans. The home run also lifted Muncy’s average to .214, marking a timely return to form when the Dodgers needed it most.Fans didn’t just cheer the home run — they turned the Muncys into the internet’s favorite baseball couple for the night. On X (formerly Twitter), the reactions poured in. @JeebsTX joked, “Muncy sent that ball straight to LAX 😁.” @CharliegNFTeth added, “Muncemeat.” And @cloudsmetax wrote, “MUNCY MUNCHING IT UP 🔥.”The mix of humor and awe perfectly mirrored the couple’s dynamic — authentic, passionate, and effortlessly entertaining.

Fans call Ernie Clement ‘postseason royalty’ as MLB world reacts to his unbelievable run

Game 7 heroics that sealed a record no legend ever reached before

Ernie Clement’s rise from quiet contributor to October sensation reached new heights under the bright lights of the World Series. The Toronto Blue Jays infielder etched his name into baseball history on November 2 by becoming the first player ever to record 30 hits in a single postseason. Facing the Los Angeles Dodgers in a high-pressure Game 7, Clement went 3-for-4 with a run scored, lifting his postseason average to an astonishing .400 and cementing himself as the breakout star of this year’s Fall Classic.For a player who entered the season known more for grit than glamour, Clement’s postseason explosion has become the story every fan can’t stop talking about. His confidence at the plate, calm demeanor, and perfectly timed hits have transformed him into a symbol of everything Toronto stands for this October — resilience, rhythm, and raw emotion. Each swing felt like a statement, each hit a piece of history in motion. As he slid safely into base after his 30th postseason hit, his teammates erupted, aware they were witnessing something baseball had never seen before.The moment Clement’s 30th hit dropped into play, social media lit up with disbelief and admiration. @14764Sairose posted, “Ernie Clement is killing it! First player with 30 postseason hits—amazing! Those celebratory slides and poses show his pure joy.Go Blue Jays!” @ChKamran92804 declared, “Postseason hitting royalty crowned.” @BabyDomRants shouted, “BEST PLAYER OF ALL TIME.”Another fan named @sfgiantsfan15 wrote, “Clement is a beast! The most clutch hunter in MLB postseason history! Let’s get it.” Meanwhile, @iamskrptd simply summed it up: “30 hits? That’s not human.” It was the kind of moment social media lives for — a perfect storm of record-breaking brilliance and fan-fueled awe.In Game 7 against the Dodgers, Clement’s line — 4 at-bats, 1 run, 3 hits, 1 stolen base — looked like another solid performance on paper. But that third hit shattered a ceiling that had stood untouched through generations of postseason greats. No Derek Jeter, no David Ortiz, no Albert Pujols ever reached 30 postseason hits. Clement just did. His approach was simple yet devastatingly effective — putting bat to ball with surgical precision and turning every at-bat into opportunity.Baseball fans will remember this postseason not just for the wins, but for the way Ernie Clement played the game — joyful, fearless, and human in the most unreal way. As one fan put it, “30 hits in one postseason is insane — man’s rewriting history in real time 🔥.” Whether or not Toronto lifts the championship trophy, Clement’s name is now forever linked with postseason greatness — a once-in-a-lifetime run that felt, in every sense of the word, “not human. ” He came to play, made history, and left the game better than he found it.Also read: Shane Bieber’s wife Kara’s fiery reaction to Alejandro Kirk’s wife Sofia Castaneda’s World Series post sparks buzz among Blue Jays fans",Ernie clement became the first player ever to record 30 hits in a single postseason.

Tyler Glasnow’s composure under fire shows why the Los Angeles Dodgers trust him in their biggest moments

Glasnow’s off-field love story shows the same charm and confidence that defines his game

The Dodgers ace proves true perfection lies in balance both on and off the field

When the pressure was at its highest, Tyler Glasnow showed what it truly means to stay composed under fire. Under the roaring lights of Rogers Centre, with runners on second and third and no outs, the Los Angeles Dodgers ace faced a do-or-die situation that could have ended their World Series hopes. But Glasnow, calm as ever, turned tension into triumph, needing just three pitches to retire three Toronto Blue Jays batters and seal the Dodgers’ Game 6 victory — a performance that pushed the series to a dramatic Game 7.It wasn’t just the stat line that defined the moment — it was the sheer poise and control that made it unforgettable. His fastball was pinpoint, his rhythm unbroken, and his demeanor unshaken. For a pitcher who’s built a reputation for thriving when it matters most, this outing was a statement. With 1.0 inning pitched, no hits, no walks, one strikeout, and an ERA of 3.18, Glasnow didn’t just pitch — he rescued Los Angeles when it mattered most, proving that pressure only sharpens his edge.This Game 6 escape wasn’t luck — it was the product of Glasnow’s complete command. Even when the noise rose to deafening levels, he stayed locked in, executing each pitch with surgical precision. The Dodgers’ bench seemed to breathe easier the moment he stepped onto the mound.Every championship team needs a player who thrives on tension, and for the Dodgers, that heartbeat is Glasnow. His ability to keep control when chaos surrounds him has turned potential disasters into defining moments. As Los Angeles heads into Game 7, it’s that same icy composure that will anchor their push for the title.Away from the mound, Glasnow’s story carries its own Hollywood magic. The Dodgers ace is engaged to Meghan Murphy, a physician assistant he met in one of baseball’s most memorable modern love stories. While rehabbing from an injury in 2021, he spotted Murphy in the stands at a Tampa Bay Rays game. “She was sitting in the front few rows, and I was like, ‘She kind of looks cute,’” Glasnow recalled on On Base with Mookie Betts in May 2024. He wrote his number on a baseball and sent it to her — but the next day, she flipped the script. “She came back the next day, wrote her number on a ball, and came up behind the dugout and threw it at me. She was like, ‘You text me. I’m not going to text you.’”The couple got engaged in August 2024, with their wedding set for November 2025. Their story feels fitting for Los Angeles — a mix of timing, charm, and character that could have been written for the big screen.Whether he’s saving the Dodgers’ season with a three-pitch escape or planning a life with his soon-to-be wife, Tyler Glasnow is redefining what it means to be composed under pressure. His Game 6 heroics and grounded off-field presence make him not just the ace of the Dodgers’ rotation but also one of the most admired figures in baseball today. Calm, confident, and quietly magnetic — Glasnow has shown that real perfection isn’t about overpowering moments, but owning them. For Glasnow, both the game and life seem perfectly in rhythm. And right now, he's winning at both - with calm, class, and quiet confidence. The spotlight may chase him, but he continues to let his composure do the talking.Also read: Dave Roberts’ unexpected race with Hyeseong Kim at Dodgers’ camp spirals into a hilarious moment fans can’t stop talking about","Tyler glasnow is the ace of the los angeles dodgers' rotation.

Alejandro Kirk’s short frame, big heart, and calm leadership make him Toronto Blue Jays ’ quiet powerhouse

From Tijuana to Toronto, Kirk carries Mexico’s pride on baseball’s grandest stage

The catcher who stood tall when it mattered most

Alejandro Kirk may not look like the prototype of a modern power-hitting catcher, but when the lights shine brightest, the 26-year-old from Mexico always finds a way to rise above expectations. In the World Series clash against the Los Angeles Dodgers, Kirk’s grit and game sense stood tall even as Toronto fell short. His fearless presence behind the plate, his clutch contact at key moments, and his poise under pressure showed exactly why the Blue Jays call him the anchor of their lineup.Standing at just 5-foot-8, Kirk has heard every doubt there is about his height, yet he’s turned it into fuel. From his breakout All-Star appearance to becoming a Silver Slugger winner in 2022, Kirk has built a reputation as one of baseball’s smartest and most composed hitters. His .282 average this regular season and calm command of the pitching staff underline a maturity beyond his years — the kind that can steady a team through chaos and carry them through October.Kirk’s size might spark online chatter, but his skill set silences it instantly. In Game 7 against the Dodgers, he went 2-for-5 — not a flashy line, but every hit came with weight. He’s not built for highlight-reel home runs; instead, he thrives on timing, control, and a mind that reads the game faster than most.That’s what makes him so vital to Toronto’s offense — a steady rhythm setter in a lineup stacked with power hitters.Teammates often describe Kirk as “the calm in the storm.” His ability to manage pitchers, make quick in-game adjustments, and stay unfazed in high-stress innings sets him apart. It’s the kind of leadership that doesn’t shout — it anchors.“Proud to represent my country, Mexico, and a bunch of Mexican players in the All-Star Game,” Kirk said earlier this summer. “We should all be proud of that.” For him, the World Series isn’t just about statistics; it’s a stage to represent a growing generation of Mexican baseball talent.His journey — from an unsigned teenager in Tijuana to one of MLB’s top catchers — is a reminder that talent can come from anywhere, and heart has no height requirement. Kirk’s story continues to inspire young players across Latin America, showing that perseverance, humility, and quiet confidence can break through any barrier.Toronto may not have lifted the trophy this time, but Kirk’s fearless World Series performance outshined the scoreline. His resilience and resolve have cemented him as more than just a stat line — he’s the soul of a team chasing its next championship. As the Blue Jays look ahead, one thing is clear: Alejandro Kirk has already proven that greatness isn’t measured in inches but in impact.Also read: Shane Bieber’s wife Kara’s fiery reaction to Alejandro Kirk’s wife Sofia Castaneda’s World Series post sparks buzz among Blue Jays fans","Alejandro kirk is a 5-foot-8 catcher for the toronto blue jays.

Will Josh Allen play against the Kansas City Chiefs tonight? Latest injury update on the Buffalo Bills QB,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/will-josh-allen-play-against-the-kansas-city-chiefs-tonight-latest-injury-update-on-the-buffalo-bills-qb/articleshow/125027667.cms,"Josh Allen is set to play tonight against the Kansas City Chiefs. This game is significant for AFC playoff seeding. Allen is expected to perform at his best, matching Patrick Mahomes drive for drive. Buffalo's defense faces challenges, placing more pressure on Allen to lead the team. His performance is critical for a Bills victory in this high-stakes matchup.

Will Josh Allen play tonight?

Buffalo needs their quarterback to stabilize the entire night not just a quarter or a half

Bills–Chiefs never arrive quietly. Every time Josh Allen and Patrick Mahomes share a field, it becomes less about standings or Vegas totals and more about another chapter in a rivalry that feels generational. The AFC hasn’t had many quarterback duels in the modern era that have the same magnetism Brady–Manning did, but this one truly might.Regular season bragging rights belong to Buffalo. Postseason scars belong to Kansas City. And tonight, the cameras once again tilt toward the Bills’ quarterback being the engine, not just the narrator, of Buffalo’s path forward. The emotional stakes rise even higher because this isn’t an “extra” regular season game. This feels like a seeding swing.Yes, Josh Allen will be playing against the Kansas City Chiefs tonight. NFL Spin Zone’s Lou Scataglia recently predicted Allen and Mahomes would “combine for 6 touchdown passes in another Chiefs-Bills classic.” The logic behind that projection is rooted in the exact offensive environments these two carry, Buffalo can still go vertical when the rhythm is right, and Kansas City continues to trust Mahomes to solve late-game geometry.Allen has been at his absolute sharpest outside of Week 1 versus Baltimore and these are historically the types of contests where he pushes into that extra gear. Buffalo doesn’t just need production, they need timely production, and they need Allen to match Mahomes drive-for-drive if this game goes high tempo.Kansas City just rolled through a strong month, and as Sayre Bedinger noted, “Patrick Mahomes has played exceptionally well over the majority of the last month.” Buffalo’s defense is developing pieces on the fly with new interior bodies in the rotation, which further pushes pressure back on Allen.And yes, he’s good to go. Buffalo needs his best version, because the Bills don’t get to win this type of night with a B-level performance.Also Read: “Hailee gotta sue”: Stephen A.

On Friday night, the Los Angeles Lakers took on Ja Morant and the Memphis Grizzlies to start the NBA Cup play. LeBron James , the Lakers' legend, is still out owing to a right-side sciatica issue.The 40-year-old attacker has been unable to make his season debut due to an ailment that affects the sciatic nerve that runs from the lower back down through the leg. He will possible be back by the mid-November. Hence, all eyes are now on the Lakers' ability to adjust without their most seasoned captain as they get ready to play the Miami Heat.Due to a current inflammation on the right side of his sciatic nerve, LeBron James will not play against the Miami Heat tonight. He has been sidelined since the preseason due to this problem, which radiates pain from the lower back through the leg and glute.On October 9, the Lakers first declared that LeBron will be sidelined for a minimum of three to four weeks due to nerve irritation in his gluteal region. James may return in mid-November, according to ESPN's Dave McMenamin.James is undoubtedly finding it difficult to be on the outside. As his retirement draws nearer, he doesn't want time to pass. However, in the interim, he has done a fantastic job of being a helpful teammate.LeBron's doctors are cautiously optimistic that he could return by the second or third week of November, but head coach JJ Redick said that sciatica is ""a tricky condition"" with no set recovery timeframe.He is missing the season opening for the first time in his legendary 23-year NBA career, which is a sign of the severity of the injury and the team's emphasis on long-term preservation.Due to the Lakers' heavy reliance on their supporting cast in the absence of its two biggest names, LeBron James and Luka Doncic, this setback has sparked more general concerns about the team's start to the season. However, fortunately, Doncic is back. Now, everyone's waiting for the Lakers' legend.Under new head coach JJ Redick, the Lakers still have a solid and deep roster, but the lack of consistency among the starters has caused problems with both offensive flow and defensive harmony. Due to LeBron's prolonged absence, the team's younger players are now receiving more attention.There is a leadership void on and off the court as a result of LeBron's absence. Players like Austin Reaves have responded by stepping up and assuming greater responsibility as the team's main scorers and playmakers. In addition to helping lead a younger team through the early part of the season, Reaves has been crucial in preserving offensive rhythm.Redick has made changes to the Lakers' offensive scheme, focusing on increased ball movement and spacing to make up for LeBron's absence as a playmaker. Although neither player can match LeBron's on-court influence, the team has looked to Jarred Vanderbilt and Rui Hachimura to help fill the loss on defense.It will be simple to evaluate the Lakers' 2025–26 ceiling if James is cleared to play and has a chance to settle in with the new look.Also read: LeBron James teases a thrilling new venture that blends nostalgia, imagination, and a hint of Halloween mystery","Lebron james is still out with a right-side sciatica issue.

How Jay Shah pushed for women's cricket, BCCI secretary Saikia explains

NAVI MUMBAI: The ending of the fairytale called India's maiden Women's World Cup triumph couldn't have been more fitting. Chasing a low full toss, South African big-hitter Nadine de Klerk, who had smashed a 54-ball 84 not out in the league phase to inflict a three-wicket defeat on India, chipped the ball to extra cover, where Indian captain Harmanpreet Kaur jogged backwards to take the catch. Having slammed a valuable half-century (58, 58b, 3x4, 1x6) earlier, Deepti Sharma took a five-for (5 for 39 in 9.3 overs), making the final her own with both bat and ball while fashioning India's biggest-ever victory in women’s cricket.Soon after, a 45,000-strong crowd, along with the Indian team, broke into celebrations, with Harman and the Women in Blue breaking into tears of joy.Finally, the Indian women’s cricket team’s ‘83 moment had arrived. Fighting back after suffering three defeats on the trot that had put their World Cup campaign in danger, India won the three matches that mattered to cross the line — at last, after numerous heartbreaks.Outclassing South Africa by 52 runs in the final of the 2025 Women’s ODI World Cup at the DY Patil Stadium on Sunday night, with 45,000 fans cheering them, India finally put an end to their long wait for an elusive World Cup crown. A billion hearts can now celebrate the Women in Blue’s memorable, historic, game-changing triumph for women’s cricket in India for a long time to come — courtesy of a player who wasn’t even in the reserves!“God has sent me here to do something good,” Shafali Verma had said before India slayed giants Australia in the semifinals, thanks to a brilliant hundred by Jemimah Rodrigues.Unfurling a blistering, career-best 87 (78b, 7x4, 2x6), which helped India post 298 for six after being asked to bat first, and later taking two for 36 in seven overs, Shafali Verma — marking a fairytale comeback — played a massive part in India posting 298 for six after a two-hour rain delay, and then striking vital blows when South Africa looked to be cruising in their chase at one stage.Following up on a match-winning epic knock of 169 in the semifinal against England at Guwahati, South African captain and opener Laura Wolvaardt slammed another superb century (101, 98b, 10x4, 1x6). But when she was caught — in the fielder's third attempt — by a sprinting Amanjot Kaur off Deepti in the 42nd over, the game was firmly in India's grip.The Proteas crumbled under the pressure of a tall chase and a home crowd that cheered their team to the historic win all the way. Chasing 299, South Africa seemed to be coasting at 114 for two in the 21st over, before Shafali’s twin strikes — she caught Sune Luus (25, 31b, 4x4) off her own innocuous-looking delivery, and had Marizanne Kapp (4) caught behind in her next over.Wolvaardt and fellow opener Tazmin Brits (23, 35b, 2x4, 1x6) had added 51 in 57 balls before Amanjot Kaur produced a direct hit to give India the first breakthrough. Soon, Anneke Bosch, who had a poor game as she dropped a sitter at deep mid-wicket off Shafali when the batter was on 57, was trapped on the back foot by Shree Charani for a six-ball duck.Banking too heavily on their in-form captain, South Africa were brought back into the game by Annerie Dercksen (25 off 37 balls), but Deepti yorked her in the 40th over to put India in the driver's seat.Earlier, Shafali Verma's blistering, career-best 87 (78b, 7x4, 2x6) and Deepti Sharma's composed half-century (58, 58b, 3x4, 1x6), along with fine support acts by Smriti Mandhana (45, 58b, 8x4) and Richa Ghosh (34 off 24 balls, 3x4, 2x6), helped India post a challenging, yet slightly under-par total of 298 for six against South Africa in the 2025 Women's ODI World Cup final at the DY Patil Stadium on Sunday.Asked to bat after a two-hour delayed start due to unseasonal rain, India were off to a flying start as Shafali, recalled for the knockouts after Pratika Rawal's injury, and vice-captain Smriti Mandhana (45), cheered by a vociferous home crowd of 45,000, added 104 for the opening wicket in 106 balls to lay the platform for a big total. It was just the second hundred-run opening stand in WODI World Cup finals.Playing delightful strokes, the duo brought up India’s fifty in just 39 balls, as the tournament hosts raced away to 64 for no loss in 10 overs. Looking to take on the bowlers by charging down repeatedly, Shafali tonked two sixes down the ground — the second one off de Klerk being a treat to watch.Scoring her first WODI fifty in over three years — the last one came against South Africa too, in July 2022 — Shafali, who scored her fifth half-century off 49 balls, took the bull by the horns, taking the attack to the Proteas before falling short of her maiden century when she perished while trying to clear mid-off off the spirited Ayabonga Khaka, who was the pick of the bowlers, taking three for 58 in nine overs and striking at regular intervals to keep South Africa in the game.Shafali's 87 is now the highest-ever individual score by an Indian opening batter in a World Cup final — men or women, ODI or T20I. At 21 years and 278 days, she's also the youngest player to score a fifty in a Women's ODI World Cup final.The Proteas heaved a sigh of relief when Mandhana was caught behind while trying to cut Chloe Tryon, but Shafali, who hit the very first ball she faced in the final — from Khaka — for a four past point, kept going, adding 62 in 62 balls for the second wicket with semifinal centurion Jemimah Rodrigues (24 off 37 balls, one four).Striving for their maiden World Cup triumph like India, South Africa were also boosted by an economical spell by left-arm spinner Nonkululeko Mlaba, who took one for 47 in 10 overs on a batting beauty, putting the brakes on India's innings.Fighting back after India's commanding start, South Africa did well to deny the tournament hosts a psychological 300-mark. Still, India recorded the second-highest total ever in a Women's ODI World Cup final, behind Australia's 356 for five against England in the 2022 World Cup.Striking in successive overs, Khaka removed Shafali and Jemimah (caught at extra cover), while Mlaba castled skipper Harmanpreet Kaur (20 off 29 balls), ending her promising 56-ball, 52-run partnership with Deepti Sharma for the fourth wicket.India were cruising at 223 for three in the 39th over when Harman was dismissed while trying to play a late cut. That blow saw them get just 75 in the remaining overs, mostly thanks to Richa's lusty blows and her 35-ball, 47-run partnership for the sixth wicket with Deepti that brought the crowd alive. Richa had hammered a power-packed, fighting 94 off 77 balls when these two teams met in the group stage, and gave impetus to India's innings on Sunday, smashing sixes off de Klerk and Kapp — a super shot over extra cover off a wide yorker.Anchoring the innings, Deepti stroked her 18th ODI half-century and third in this tournament before she was run out off the last ball.While their ground fielding was brilliant, South Africa dropped a couple of catches. They first let off Shafali when, batting on 53 in the 21st over, she slog-swept Sune Luus to deep mid-wicket, where Anneke Bosch fluffed the chance, and in the 40th over, skipper Laura Wolvaardt grassed Deepti’s catch at long-on. In between, Marizanne Kapp dropped a slightly tougher chance off Deepti off her own bowling.","India beat south africa by 52 runs in the final of the 2025 women’s odi world cup at the dy patil stadium on sunday night. Deepti sharma took a five-for (5 for 39 in 9.3 overs), making the final her own with both bat and ball while fashioning india's biggest-ever victory.
