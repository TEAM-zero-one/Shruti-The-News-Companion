Cooper Kupp’s wife Anna sparks debate after wearing Seahawks coat against Rams in NFC Championship showdown,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/cooper-kupps-wife-anna-sparks-debate-after-wearing-seahawks-coat-against-rams-in-nfc-championship-showdown/articleshow/127513903.cms,"Cooper Kupp and wife Anna Marie (Instagram)

Cooper Kupp finds strength in family as Seahawks journey turns personal



Cooper Kupp stood at the center of one of the most emotional Sundays of the NFL season, carrying history, heartbreak, and hope into a championship stage. Once celebrated as the face of a Super Bowl comeback in Los Angeles, the veteran wide receiver now wears different colors with the same quiet fire. The moment felt heavy and personal, shaped not just by football, but by family, loyalty, and a career that refuses to slow down.At 32, Kupp understands how quickly the league moves on. The Rams chose not to meet his expectations in free agency, closing a chapter that included a Super Bowl MVP and countless clutch catches. Seattle did not hesitate. A three year, $45 million deal with $17.5 million guaranteed gave him a fresh start, and it placed him face to face with the past sooner than anyone expected.The NFC Championship Game against Los Angeles was more than a playoff matchup. It was a collision of memories. Kupp embraced former teammates Matthew Stafford and Puka Nacua before kickoff, sharing smiles that hinted at mutual respect and unfinished emotions. Then he turned toward the stands, where his true support system waited.Anna Marie Kupp and their three sons made their presence impossible to miss. Cooper Jameson, born in 2018, Cypress Stellar, born in 2021, and Solas Reign, born in 2023, proudly wore Seahawks gear and Kupp jerseys.Anna added a custom “10” coat, blending style with meaning. The image spoke louder than words. This was a family fully committed to the next chapter.Their bond has deep roots. Cooper and Anna met as teenagers at a high school track meet in Washington, when she handed him a medal after a race. He has often described that moment as love at first sight. They married in 2015, long before the bright lights of Super Bowls and free agency drama.In a June 2022 conversation with PEOPLE, Kupp described his wife as the ""absolute warrior"" of their family. That strength has carried them through relocations, injuries, and now a rivalry that feels personal. Anna once shared a heartfelt note about moving back to the Pacific Northwest, a return that felt both emotional and empowering.For Cooper Kupp, revenge is not loud. It lives in preparation, precision, and purpose. Surrounded by family and fueled by unfinished business, he stepped onto the field not just to beat his former team, but to honor the journey that brought him there.","Cooper kupp signed a three year, $45 million deal with the seattle seahawks.

Will Drake Maye play against the Denver Broncos today? Latest injury update on the New England Patriots' QB,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/will-drake-maye-play-against-the-denver-broncos-today-latest-injury-update-on-the-new-england-patriots-qb/articleshow/127440962.cms,"Drake Maye is healthy and set to start for the New England Patriots in the AFC Championship Game against the Denver Broncos. He has a chance to achieve something the franchise has never done by winning a playoff game in Denver. With the Patriots unbeaten on the road this season, Maye leads a confident team into a hostile, high-altitude environment.

Drake Maye injury update and what it means for New England

History hangs heavy in Denver, especially for the New England Patriots. The thin air, the noise, and the playoff scars of the past all return this weekend as the AFC Championship sets the stage for something the franchise has never pulled off. This is not about nostalgia or legacy alone. It is about opportunity, pressure, and a quarterback stepping into a moment that once swallowed even the greatest names.The Patriots arrive with momentum and belief. Road games have become their comfort zone this season, not a burden. The stakes could not be higher, and the quarterback at the center of it all understands exactly what is in front of him. Denver offers no sympathy, only resistance, history, and a direct path to the Super Bowl.Drake Maye is healthy and will start for the New England Patriots against the Denver Broncos in Sunday’s AFC Championship Game. No injury designation followed Maye into the weekend, clearing the way for him to lead an offense chasing history in one of the league’s toughest playoff environments.Maye has a rare chance to do something not even Tom Brady managed in a Patriots uniform. New England is winless in four playoff games played in Denver, with Brady going 0 for 3.That context is not lost on the rookie quarterback.“Just the AFC championship, the chance to go to the Super Bowl. That’d be huge,” Maye said. “Another road environment that’s had success in the past. … I know it would be a big-time win.”The Patriots earned this opportunity by beating Houston in the divisional round and finishing the regular season unbeaten on the road. That mentality has been reinforced all year under head coach Mike Vrabel.“Coach (Vrabel) has always been saying, ‘Road warriors,’” Maye said. “So, we’re trying to find that one more time and finish out strong what we’ve done this year.”Denver’s home record and altitude remain real obstacles, but New England enters healthy at quarterback and confident in its approach. For Maye, availability is not the question. Execution is.","Drake maye is healthy and set to start for the new england patriots in the afc championship game against the denver broncos.

Cleveland Cavaliers vs Orlando Magic Key Matchups (January 24, 2026)

Thevisit theon January 24, 2026, at the Kia Center in a matchup that matters for Eastern Conference standings. Cleveland comes in at 26-20, while Orlando is 23-20, with both teams trying to stay in the playoff mix.Injuries are shaping this game on both sides. Rotations are thinner than usual, and several key players are unavailable. That puts more pressure on the starters and shifts the focus toward interior scoring, rebounding, and half-court execution.Cleveland is on the second night of a back-to-back and will be without several perimeter players. Darius Garland is out with a right great toe strain. Sam Merrill is sidelined with a right hand sprain. Max Strus continues to recover from left foot surgery (Jones fracture). Chris Livingston and Luke Travers are unavailable due to G-League two-way assignments.Orlando could get Jalen Suggs back, with his status listed as probable after missing three weeks with a right knee MCL contusion. Franz Wagner remains out with left ankle soreness. Colin Castleton is unavailable on a G-League assignment. With these absences, both teams are expected to lean heavily on their frontcourt players.Both teams are likely to play through the paint more than usual given the depleted backcourts.Cleveland leads the all-time regular-season series 67-62 across 129 games, though Orlando has traditionally performed well at home against them. This season, the Cavaliers hold a 2-1 edge, outscoring the Magic by an average margin of 10 points per game. Cleveland has averaged 120.0 points in those matchups, while Orlando has scored 110.0. Rebounding has been a key factor so far. The teams will meet again on January 26, March 11, and March 24.Cleveland holds a slight edge on offense, while Orlando has been more consistent defensively, even with recent lineup changes.Donovan Mitchell remains the engine of Cleveland’s offense, averaging a career-high 28.9 points per game and posting a strong on-court net rating. His matchup with Jalen Suggs, if Suggs plays, will be central, especially given Suggs’ impact on defense.In the frontcourt, Evan Mobley and Jarrett Allen carry much of Cleveland’s interior workload, while Paolo Banchero and Wendell Carter Jr. anchor Orlando’s attack. Orlando averages 54.0 points in the paint per game, which could test Cleveland’s interior defense. Mobley is coming off a strong performance with 29 points and 13 rebounds.Orlando has played well at home, while Cleveland enters on a two-game win streak. With both teams short-handed, this game is likely to come down to execution, rebounding, and who controls the paint late.","The cleveland cavaliers host the orlando magic on january 24, 2026.

“The writing just dries up”: Travis Kelce romance fuels debate as Taylor Swift fears her lyrical storytelling is fading,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/the-writing-just-dries-up-travis-kelce-romance-fuels-debate-as-taylor-swift-fears-her-lyrical-storytelling-is-fading/articleshow/127390142.cms,"Taylor Swift recently admitted she once feared happiness could weaken her songwriting as her romance with Travis Kelce deepened. She worried that joy might replace the emotional tension that fueled her lyrics. However, her latest album proved otherwise, showing she can create vibrant, story-driven music even during one of the happiest chapters of her life.

Travis Kelce relationship changed how Taylor Swift views pain, joy, and creativity

The End of an Era: Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce Love Story Secrets REVEALED!

Being an artist of emotional honesty, Taylor Swift has developed her career on the belief that doubt was lingering silently in the creative process unimpeded by the polished albums and sold-out tours. She struggled with having a troubling question that most artists dread but hardly confess to as her personal life became more placid and satisfied. But when pain is no longer the guide of creativity what becomes of it?This question became even more burning with the further development of her relations with Travis Kelce . The happiness that she felt offstage thus heightened some anxiety as to the implications of its effect on her songwriting. To an artist so much praised to transform heartache into brilliance, happiness was strange grounds even dangerous.Taylor Swift openly addressed that concern while reflecting on her mindset before completing ""The Life of a Showgirl"". Speaking candidly, she admitted, “I used to have this dark fear that if I ever were truly happy and free, being myself and nurtured by a relationship, what happens if the writing just dries up?” She continued, “What if writing is directly tied to my torment and pain?”Those doubts did not survive the creative process. The album emerged during a whirlwind chapter that included her Eras Tour and a stable personal life. Instead of dulling her edge, that happiness sharpened it.“It turns out, that’s not the case at all, and we just were catching lightning in a bottle with this record,” she wrote. “But it’s nice because you’re coming from a place of happiness and love, you can go back to those places. You can look forward to other things.”On Travis Kelce’s podcast, she described the emotional fuel behind the project. “This album is about what was going on behind the scenes in my inner life during this tour, which was so exuberant and electric and vibrant,” she said. “It just comes from, like, the most infectiously joyful, wild, dramatic place I was in in my life.”Kelce noticed the shift immediately. “I’ve been fortunate enough to hear every single song on here, so I know they’re all 12 bangers,” he said, adding, “It’s a lot more upbeat … like fun, pop excitement.… It’s a complete 180 from a lot of the songs on Tortured Poets.”Swift’s story challenges a tired myth. Creativity does not require suffering. Sometimes, it grows louder when life finally feels steady.","Taylor swift once feared happiness could weaken her songwriting as her romance with travis kelce deepened.

'BCB will consider if ... ': Bangladesh give Sheikh Hasina-linked cricketer Shakib Al Hasan ultimate selection conditions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/bcb-will-consider-if-bangladesh-give-sheikh-hasina-linked-cricketer-shakib-al-hasan-ultimate-selection-conditions/articleshow/127484464.cms,"Shakib Al Hasan

Bangladesh cricket in turmoil: What it means for the T20 World Cup?

Bangladesh cricket officials have said former captain Shakib Al Hasan could be considered for a return to the national team, reopening the possibility less than a year after his retirement from international cricket.Shakib, who was also a lawmaker from the former ruling party that was removed in a 2024 uprising, had become a focus of public anger because of his association with ousted prime minister Sheikh Hasina. He was among several people named in murder cases linked to a police crackdown on protesters. In 2024, Shakib announced his retirement but said last month that he was open to reversing that decision.Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) senior official Amzad Hossain said the board had taken a collective view on the matter.“The board has taken a unanimous decision that if Shakib Al Hasan's availability, fitness and accessibility allow it -- and if he can be present at the venue where matches are played -- then the board and the selection panel will consider him for the national team,” Hossain told reporters late Saturday.He said the BCB would also allow Shakib to play in overseas leagues if he wished.“If he wants to participate in other global tournaments, the board will provide him NOC as required,” Amzad added.Shakib had earlier apologised for staying silent during the student-led uprising, while also defending his decision to be part of the government that was later removed.The development comes at a time when Bangladesh cricket is dealing with the fallout of being excluded from next month’s T20 World Cup. On Saturday, the International Cricket Council (ICC) replaced Bangladesh with Scotland.The BCB had declined to send the team to India and asked for their matches to be moved to co-host Sri Lanka. The issue escalated earlier this month after the Indian cricket board asked IPL franchise Kolkata Knight Riders to release Bangladesh pacer Mustafizur Rahman.The ICC said there was no credible security threat to Bangladesh in India, but the BCB said the final call rested with the government.“This is a government decision taken on security grounds,” Amzad said. “Because of that, there was nothing more we could do.”Shakib was playing in a domestic T20 tournament in Canada when Hasina’s government fell and has not returned to Bangladesh since. He has represented Bangladesh in 71 Tests, 247 one-day internationals and 129 T20 internationals, taking a total of 712 wickets across formats.",Bangladesh cricket officials say former captain shakib al hasan could be considered for a return to the national team. Shakib retired from international cricket in 2024 but said last month he was open to reversing that decision.

Toronto Raptors still in the dark as Jakob Poeltl’s back issue shows no clear return timeline

Jakob Poeltl’s absence leaves a growing hole in Raptors’ frontcourt despite strong playoff push

Jakob Poeltl, the starting center for the Toronto Raptors, has not yet received a return date. According to Marc Stein, Poeltl is presently taking care of his ""ongoing back issues,"" according to the Raptors. Due to a lower back issue, the 30-year-old Austrian hasn't played since December, missing 17 games.Jakob last appeared in an official NBA game on December 21, 2025, during a 96–81 away loss in Brooklyn. He left the game early after playing just seven minutes. Poeltl appeared to be in line for a comeback during the team's five-game road trip, which ends today in Oklahoma City.The Toronto Raptors have provided an injury update on Jakob Poeltl, who has been sidelined for more than a month due to a back problem. Poeltl was back in Toronto for pain relief treatment. Poeltl has returned to Toronto and undergone specialized pain management, according to the Raptors.We'll update his status once he resumes practicing. Additionally, the official announcement of the team read:“The Toronto Raptors announced Sunday that center Jakob Poeltl, who has been managing ongoing back issues, returned to Toronto and has received targeted pain relief treatment. A return timeline has not yet been established, and his status will be updated when he returns to practice…”However, the problem started much earlier. According to Michael Grange, the center has been dealing with a back issue that started back in training camp.This makes sense because even before the most recent game in Brooklyn, Poeltl was still missing time occasionally and was typically rested on one leg of back-to-backs.Meanwhile, the announcement further said:“Poeltl is averaging 9.7 points, 7.7 rebounds, 2.1 assists and 25.3 minutes in 21 games (all starts) this season. He last played Dec. 21 at Brooklyn before exiting the game midway through the first quarter…”On Sunday night, Toronto will travel to Oklahoma City to play the NBA's top team, the Thunder.The big man has had difficulty maintaining his health, and his absence creates a significant void in Toronto's frontcourt lineup. According to the Raptors, Poeltl has returned to Toronto and undergone specialized pain management. We'll update his status once he resumes practicing.The team and Yak have no choice but to return to Toronto in an attempt to resolve this problem after this setback. The Raptors, who have a 28–19 record and are in fourth place in the Eastern Conference, are still competitive despite Poeltl's injury.Due to a tiebreaker, the Raptors, who have won three straight games, are now fourth in the Eastern Conference at 28-19, behind New York. Toronto is six games behind Detroit and one game behind Boston, which is in second place. In 21 games this season, Poeltl has averaged 9.7 points and 7.7 rebounds.","Toronto raptors still in the dark as jakob poeltl’s back issue shows no clear return timeline despite strong playoff push.

Reggie Miller says Stephen Curry should make the call to Giannis as Father Time is knocking,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/reggie-miller-says-stephen-curry-should-make-the-call-to-giannis-as-father-time-is-knocking/articleshow/127283445.cms,"Giannis Antetokounmpo, Stephen Curry and Reggie Miller (Images via Getty)

The Warriors’ franchise in desperation after Jimmy Butler’s ACL

The Milwaukee Bucks ’ meltdown

Reggie Miller just tossed a grenade into the NBA rumor mill, and it’s landing right in the middle of Chase Center. Speaking on The Dan Patrick Show, the Hall of Famer didn’t mince words: he believes it is time for Stephen Curry to pick up the phone and recruit Giannis Antetokounmpo to the Golden State Warriors. With the Bucks currently languishing in 11th place in the East and the Warriors reeling from Jimmy Butler’s season-ending ACL injury, Miller argues that the Greek Freak might be the only answer to save Steph’s remaining prime.The logic is simple but devastating, as Miller suggests Curry needs to remind Giannis that while his Milwaukee legacy is secure, Father Time is officially knocking on the door in San Francisco. A Curry-Giannis pairing wouldn't just be a trade, it would be a shift in the league's tectonic plates, combining the greatest gravity in perimeter history with the most dominant interior force of this generation.When asked about the trade window closing, Miller said, “Halfway closed and especially now with the injury to Butler, almost closed unless something drastically happens.”The Warriors find themselves at a brutal crossroads. Before Butler went down, the vision was clear: a gritty, veteran-heavy squad capable of one last deep run. Now, sitting near the play-in line, the Dubs are a team with a superstar and a vacuum of secondary scoring. Mike Dunleavy Jr. has the assets, Jonathan Kuminga, Moses Moody, and a chest of future first-round picks, but the front office has been hesitant to empty the clip“If I'm Stephen Curry, maybe I open up my Rolodex. Wow. And maybe it's time that I call someone in the Midwest by the name of Giannis Antetokounmpo, and say, look, what you've done in Milwaukee has been fabulous.It's been great. You brought them a championship, their first in 50 years, but the time is now. You're You're getting older. I'm certainly knocking on Father Time's door,"" said Miller on the Warriors' need for another talent like Giannis, along with Curry and Green to make them an indispensable force for the championship run.For Giannis Antetokounmpo, the grass in the Bay might actually be greener, as despite his public loyalty, the Bucks are currently an 18-26 mess, struggling to find a rhythm under Doc Rivers. The 100-102 loss against Nuggets brought much bigger chaos for Bucks as Giannis left the match after a no-contact injury.Insiders suggest that while Milwaukee isn't answering the phone yet, the league feels an impending breakup between the two. If the Warriors can pull off the impossible, they wouldn't just be replacing Butler’s production, they’d be creating a nightmare for the rest of the league. A Giannis rim run with Steph and Buddy Hield spacing the floor is quite literally unguardable.","Reggie miller believes it is time for stephen curry to recruit giannis antetokounmpo to the golden state warriors.

Poll Do you believe the Sunrisers Eastern Cape can maintain their winning streak next season? Yes, they have a strong team. No, other teams will catch up.

On December 30, 2025, former South Africa seamer Dale Steyn made a bold declaration on social media. ""SEC [Sunrisers Eastern Cape] are def [definitely] one of my finalists. Possibly even champions again. But let's come back to this in two weeks. "" It wasn't an outlandish bet to make. They had been to the final three times in three seasons, winning two.As they booked a place in the final once again, for the fourth straight time, Steyn wrote, ""Surprise. Surprise. SEC in the FINAL, again.""A little over three weeks after Steyn's original prediction, SEC were on the field against the Pretoria Capitals at Newlands in Cape Town. The task at hand for the Tristan Stubbs-led side was to chase down 159 runs.The World Cup-bound Stubbs, who had a mediocre campaign, had Matthew Breetzke for company. The job was difficult: 56 runs needed in 24 balls. Lizaad Williams and Lungi Ngidi, who had gone for a paltry six an over, each had an over.Steyn was worried and the confidence in the SEC was shaky. ""SEC may have left this a little late. New champions on route,"" he posted.What transpired, however, was a remarkable turnaround. Stubbs, who was included in the T20 World Cup squad only because of injuries in the camp, played a captain's knock, turning a 35 off 28 balls into an unbeaten 62 runs off 41 balls. Breetzke was equally impressive, pulling off a 49-ball, 68-run knock.Even if Dewald Brevis' 101-run knock in the first innings earned him the Player of the Match award, Stubbs-Breetzke's 114-run partnership for the fifth wicket took SEC to their fourth title.Let that register fully. Four years, four finals and three titles. This is stuff of sporting dynasties. Like Perth Scorchers who won their sixth Big Bash League (BBL) title in 15 seasons on Sunday. In American sports, think the Boston Celtics, Chicago Bulls, the New York Yankees and the New England Patriots. You get the idea.What's the secret? ""I think we've got a very well-balanced team. No disrespect to others but I think we've probably got the most balanced of teams. We've got good spin, we've got good pace and high-quality batters and an experienced opening pair,"" said coach Adrian Birrell in an unprecedented press conference that assembled the entire playing XI.""I think we probably were the side that played the least number of players. Didn't chop and change, which is very hard on the bench, but we've got a fantastic bench that could have played and they were really high-quality players, which gave me as coach a lot of confidence. But I think we've got a really good squad here and I think that showed this year that we were probably the most consistent team,"" continued the former South Africa national team assistant coach.The numbers back that claim. SEC had topped the table this season. They also had the most bonus points in the league stage. Zooming out across the four seasons, SEC has the most wins, holds the best win-loss ratio and scored the most runs.From Aiden Markram earlier to Tristan Stubbs now, the leadership duties have been handled perfectly. And Stubbs has found a perfect ally in Quinton de Kock to lean on for support when required. But the decision to pass the captaincy armband to 'Stubbo', who has only had one strong season for the franchise (2024), speaks highly of their preference for building a team rather than highlighting individuals.""I've really enjoyed this month,"" said Stubbs in reflection of the season. ""I've had a great group to work with. We've planned really well for games. The bowlers are really experienced, so it's been easy. Me and Quinny [Quinton de Kock] have had this great thing going where we channelled a lot of the bowling changes. It's been a whole team effort. The senior players have been awesome. It's awesome to finish like this.""As the beers were passed around in the room to culminate another trophy-laden season, a look back at the start cannot be ignored.At the auction, the Sunrisers Eastern Cape signed Quinton de Kock and Anrich Nortje . De Kock finished as the leading run-scorer in the fourth season of the SA20 while Nortje was second on the wicket-taker's list. Wildcard pick Marco Jansen's 13 wickets made him the SA20's second-most successful bowler.Steyn sums things up nicely: ""SEC lead [sic] by Stubbs and the great coach Adi Birrell do it again 🏆. Stubbs you champion! SA20 you’re incredible! SA fans are special! What a tournament! Can’t wait for season 5!""","Sunrisers eastern cape (sec) beat pretoria capitals (pc) by 6 wickets to become sa20 champions during the final of the betway sa20 season 4. The tristan stubbs-led side had been to the final three times in three seasons, winning two. Former south africa seamer dale steyn made a bold declaration on social media that sec were one of his finalists.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127524530,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-153246,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"

Shivam Dube press conference: On Ishan and Surya’s knock & his role with the ball

Poll Will Abhishek Sharma break Yuvraj Singh's record of 12-ball half-century? Yes, it's possible! No, it’s too tough!

NEW DELHI: Explosive India opener Abhishek Sharma lit up the Barsapara Cricket Stadium on Sunday with a breathtaking display of power-hitting, smashing the second-fastest T20I half-century by an Indian during the third T20I against New Zealand as India cruised to a dominant eight-wicket win.Abhishek reached his fifty in just 14 balls, eclipsing Hardik Pandya’s 16-ball effort to move into elite company. Only Yuvraj Singh’s legendary 12-ball blitz against England in the 2007 T20 World Cup stands ahead of him.Chasing a modest 154, India stormed to 94/2 inside the powerplay, with Abhishek setting the tone in emphatic fashion. The 25-year-old remained unbeaten on a stunning 68 off just 20 deliveries, striking five fours and four sixes as the hosts wrapped up the chase with ease.“That’s what my team wants from me and I just want to execute all the time,” Abhishek said after the match. “Obviously, it’s not easy to do it every time, but I think it’s all about mental as well and the atmosphere you get around your dressing room.”When asked about the possibility of breaking Yuvraj’s iconic record, Abhishek was respectful yet quietly optimistic. “That’s more than impossible for anyone, but still, you never know,” he said.“Any batsman could do it because all the batters have been batting really well in this series and going forward, it’s going to be fun.”Abhishek also explained his fearless approach, including hitting another six off the first ball of the innings. “I wouldn’t say I want to go from the first ball. It’s just the instinct I get. I think about what the bowler could bowl to me and I just want to play on that ball,” he explained.Detailing his innovative footwork, he added, “It’s all about the field placement. If I get room for myself, then I have the whole off-side. I just want to play with the field.”Yuvraj Singh, meanwhile, responded with trademark wit. “Still can’t get a 50 off 12 balls, can you?” the World Cup hero posted on social media. “Well played — keep going strong!”","India beat new zealand by eight wickets in the third t20i in delhi.

Pretoria Capitals:

Sunrisers Eastern Cape:

Sunrisers Eastern Cape cemented their status as the undisputed kings of the SA20 after clinching a third championship title, edging out Pretoria Capitals in a thrilling Season 4 final.A glorious, sold-out Newlands crowd was treated to entertainment of the highest quality as Sunrisers captain Tristan Stubbs and Matthew Breetzke shared an unbroken 114-run partnership for the fifth wicket to take their team home by six wickets with four balls to spare.The heroics were required after Dewald Brevis had earlier produced one of the finest innings the grand old ground at the foot of Table Mountain has witnessed.Brevis walked in with the Capitals reduced to 8/2 and launched a counter-attack of the highest quality, striking a sublime 101 off 56 balls, including eight fours and seven sixes, to lift his side to 158/7.For much of the Sunrisers’ chase, it appeared the total would be enough to hand the Capitals their maiden SA20 title, until the arrival of Stubbs.The Sunrisers skipper seized the initiative with 21 runs off Gideon Peters’ 18th over to breathe life into the chase.The Newlands crowd was on edge as 12 runs followed off Lungi Ngidi’s penultimate over before Stubbs delivered the coup de grâce, smashing two consecutive sixes off Bryce Parsons to send the Sunrisers into seventh heaven.“I am really proud and thrilled. It was a hell of a final. For Dewald to play like he did and for us to hold them to 158, and then needing 13 an over for the last four or five overs,” said Sunrisers coach Adrian Birrell.“I’m very proud. Four finals in a row is a fantastic achievement. I’m proud of every player and the whole squad. Some players haven’t featured, but we’ve got a very good bench. To get here again and give ourselves a chance is special.”The four Player of the Match contenders were Matthew Breetzke, Dewald Brevis, Marco Jansen and Tristan Stubbs, with the centurion winning 79.9 percent of the fan vote.“You want to win the trophy, but you want to do it the right way and set an example for the younger generation,” Birrell added.Stubbs was equally delighted with leading his team to a championship title in his first season as captain.“So stoked, I can’t explain it. Don’t know what we did or how we did it. Me and Matty were calm out there, though probably panicking too. We bat so well together and kept looking for an over to get momentum,” Stubbs said.“I came in during the 16th over and we ran with it. Funny things happen under pressure. I’ve really enjoyed this month. We’ve had a great group to work with, planned really well, and have a brilliant Orange Army backing us wherever we go.”The Capitals have now lost two finals to the Sunrisers after their defeat in the inaugural showpiece in 2023, with captain Keshav Maharaj admitting the pain will linger.“It is disappointing, to say the least. Two batters were in and had got set,” Maharaj said. “You feel the hurt of coming so close. The starts we get with both bat and ball are things we have to look at.“The boys will hurt for a bit. I’m not someone who dwells on negatives, but we have to rectify our mistakes if we want to win trophies as a unit.”158 for 7 in 20 overs (Dewald Brevis 101; Marco Jansen 3/10)162 for 4 in 19.2 overs (Matthew Breetzke 68 not out, Tristan Stubbs 63 not out; Keshav Maharaj 1/23)",Sunrisers eastern cape are crowned champions of the sa20 season 4.

Mario Kart World update brings new Knockout Tours races for Nintendo Switch 2 players: What is it and how it works,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/gaming/mario-kart-world-update-brings-new-knockout-tours-races-for-nintendo-switch-2-players-what-is-it-and-how-it-works/articleshow/127159791.cms,"Mario Kart World's new Knockout Tours on Nintendo Switch 2: What is it and how it works





Nintendo has released a free update for Mario Kart World on the Nintendo Switch 2, adding a team racing feature to Knockout Tour mode for both local wireless and online play. The most recent version, 1.5.0, significantly expands the game's multiplayer options by enabling players to race as a team in Knockout Tour. Bug fixes and general enhancements are also included in the update. According to Nintendo's official support page, the update also contains Polish language support and several game-wide issue fixes.Knockout Tour is a racing mode where 24 drivers race through multiple courses around the world without stopping. There are five checkpoints during the race, and drivers who are below a particular position at each checkpoint are eliminated. Until now, the Knockout Tour has only allowed individual players to race against each other. The new update changes this by allowing up to four teams to compete together.Players can join 2 friends on Nintendo Switch via local wireless or online play. The update lets players set up Knockout Tour races as two teams (12 vs. 12), three teams (8 vs. 8 vs. 8), or four teams (6 vs. 6 vs. 6 vs. 6). If there aren't enough players, computer-controlled drivers will fill the empty spots.Twenty-four drivers start the race, and the bottom four are eliminated at each checkpoint until only four remain. As players approach a checkpoint, they can see which drivers have cleared it in the top-right corner of the screen. Team colours show how each team is doing.After the Knockout Tour ends, the winning team is decided by the total points earned by all team members. Points are awarded based on each driver's overall finish.However, the points awarded in Knockout Tour team races are different from those in other modes. Top finishers earn many more points: 50 points for 1st place, 40 points for 2nd, 35 points for 3rd, and 30 points for 4th. Making it to the final four helps the team. Drivers who don't make it past the first checkpoint only get 1 point.If all four drivers from the same team pass through the final checkpoint, that team wins automatically. Working together as a team is essential for winning. GameChat can help players coordinate better when playing online from different locations.If a player gets eliminated, they can still watch the race until the end. They can switch the camera to follow the driver they want to support and choose from a list of comments to share with other spectators.To add friends, players can select their user icon (My Page) on the system's HOME Menu, then select Add Friend. From there, they can send and accept friend requests in a few ways by following the instructions.For Mario Kart World, every system needs the game to play, but players can bring a friend online if they both play on the same system. Some other games support GameShare, which lets friends play together even when only one person has the game.In addition to the new Knockout Tour team races, the update also addresses several technical issues in the game. The update fixes a problem where the game would sometimes end if a player chose Kamek on Choco Mountain. It also resolves an issue where the displayed rating would sometimes be incorrect when joining ""Everyone"" in ""Online Play"" while in a room. Moreover, several other issues have been fixed to improve the overall gameplay experience.","Knockout tour is a racing mode where 24 drivers race through multiple courses.

Bangladesh cricket in turmoil: What it means for the T20 World Cup?

Poll Do you agree with the ICC's decision to replace Bangladesh with Scotland? Yes, it was the right decision. No, Bangladesh should have participated.

NEW DELHI: The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) has confirmed it will not challenge the International Cricket Council’s decision to replace Bangladesh with Scotland in the upcoming ICC Men’s T20 World Cup, ending weeks of uncertainty and controversy surrounding the tournament.BCB media committee chairman Amzad Hossain made the announcement after a board meeting in Dhaka on Saturday, firmly stating that the board has accepted the ICC’s ruling and will not pursue any form of arbitration or dispute resolution, according to a report on ESPNCricinfo.“We have accepted the decision of the ICC board,” Amzad said. “Since the ICC has said that we cannot go and play or they cannot shift our games to Sri Lanka, in this case we cannot go and play in India. Our position remains the same. We are not going to any separate arbitration or anything here.”Bangladesh’s withdrawal follows the government’s refusal to clear the national team for travel to India, citing concerns over player security. At an ICC Board meeting last week, Bangladesh were informed that failure to travel would result in replacement, a message the BCB subsequently relayed to the government.“After the ICC board meeting, there was a cabinet meeting of the Bangladesh government and a decision was made there,” Amzad said.“The decision clearly stated that our team will not be able to go to India. This decision has been communicated by the government.”According to Amzad, the ICC then gave the BCB a 24-hour deadline to confirm participation. “We told them politely that it is not possible for us to go and play according to this fixture,” he added.Contrary to reports, Amzad clarified that the BCB never approached the ICC’s dispute resolution committee. With Bangladesh declining to participate, the ICC moved swiftly to replace them with Scotland, the highest-ranked T20I side outside the original qualification list.The ICC, in its internal assessments, maintained that there was no credible security threat to the Bangladesh team in India and stressed the importance of protecting the integrity and schedule of the global event. After Bangladesh failed to confirm participation within the stipulated deadline, the governing body acted in line with its qualification and governance processes.During Saturday’s meeting, the BCB was also informed that board director Ishtiaque Sadeque had resigned, citing personal reasons, adding another layer of upheaval to a turbulent chapter for Bangladesh cricket.","Bangladesh cricket board will not challenge icc's decision to replace them with scotland.
