Anna Kournikova, 44, reveals pregnancy with Enrique Iglesias after health scare

Anna Kournikova and Enrique Iglesias’ family life in Miami

“It was just meant to be sweet in the moment. I honestly didn’t mean to confuse people.

I thought it’d be easier for the audience to understand than if I said ‘my girl.’”

“I’ve never really thought marriage would make a difference. Maybe it’s because I come from divorced parents, but I don’t think you love someone more because of a piece of paper.”

Former tennis star Anna Kournikova, 44, is pregnant with her fourth child with long-time partner, singer Enrique Iglesias, 50. The news was reported on Thursday by Spanish magazine Hola, which said that the Russian athlete is already halfway through her pregnancy and “everything is going well. ” This comes only months after she was spotted in a wheelchair in Miami, wearing a protective boot, sparking concern about her health.The couple, who have been together since 2001, already share three children- twins Lucy and Nicholas, both 7, and their younger daughter Mary, who is 5.Anna Kournikova was last photographed in early August in Miami, where she was seen taking her children to martial arts classes, a rare public outing that reassured fans after earlier health concerns.Anna Kournikova retired from professional tennis in 2003 at just 21 after repeated injuries to her back and feet. Her health history made the sight of her in a wheelchair in January this year especially worrying for fans. She was seen at Bal Harbour Mall in Miami, wearing an orthopedic boot, but later appeared to recover well.Anna Kournikova and Iglesias have built a private family life in Miami, where the Spanish singer has lived since the late 1990s. The couple first met in 2001 when Kournikova appeared in Enrique Iglesias’s music video for his hit single Escape. Although they have been together for over two decades, they have never confirmed if they are married. Iglesias once explained in 2012:He also shared his views on marriage, saying:The couple recently expanded their property portfolio in Miami by purchasing a five-bedroom home in Bay Point for $6.5 million, according to the Miami Herald.Also Read: “No Room For Emotions”: Novak Djokovic Reveals How Athlete Stereotypes Hurt His Relationship With Wife Jelena While Enrique Iglesias continues touring worldwide, Kournikova has kept a very low profile. The last time fans regularly saw her was during her playing days, when she reached the world’s top 10 in singles and won two Grand Slam doubles titles with Martina Hingis in 1999 and 2002.Now, with a fourth baby on the way, the couple are preparing for another new chapter in their family life. Now, with a fourth baby on the way, the couple are preparing for another new chapter in their family life, filled with love, joy, laughter, and togetherness.Spanish outlets reported Anna Kournikova’s due date could be early 2026, and sources close to the family say Enrique Iglesias plans to pause concerts to support her during delivery.Their close friends describe them as hands-on, playful parents who cherish family time. Neighbors in Miami often see them enjoying beach walks, outdoor barbecues, and cheering at their kids’ weekend sports practices. What makes this pregnancy even more remarkable is Anna’s resilience—balancing past injuries, raising three kids, and now embracing motherhood again, all while Enrique juggles music tours and family commitments.","Former tennis star anna kournikova pregnant at 44 expecting fourth child with enrique iglesias.

Jerry Jones & Stephen Jones Press Conference on Micah Parsons Trade | Dallas Cowboys 2025

Also Read:

In the last episode of Netflix’s sports docuseries,a glimpse is shown of the camaraderie between now former Dallas Cowboys defensive end Micah Parsons and Cowboys owner Jerry Jones. During the 2023 playoffs, after the Cowboys were eliminated, Jones went to the locker room, hugged Parsons, and said, “I’m proud of you, you know that, okay? It’s a disappointment, but it wasn’t because of you. ” Micah heartbreakingly responded, “All I wanna do is win.” Jones replied, “I know that. But I love you.”However, more recently, Jones stated in a press conference that there was no question that Parsons could bring in a lot of resources in a trade, noting that this strategy had been on his mind since the hiring of the head coach Brian Schottenheimer: “There was no question in our mind that Micah(Parsons) could bring a lot of resources in a trade. This has been on my mind since we hired Brian(Schottenheimer). So there was no question. ”The 26-year-old defensive end recently got traded to the Green Bay Packers.Michael David Smith of NBC Sports reported that the Cowboys freed up $19 million by trading DE Micah Parsons for defensive tackle Kenny Clark.The Cowboys now have an estimated $42 million in cap space for 2025, which gives them more room to sign other players and extend contracts of the current players, like cornerback DaRon Bland and left guard Tyler Smith.Discussing the importance of the freed-up cap space, Jerry Jones said, “We got a lot of capital that is required to build a team. It takes many players to be tried to play in the NFL.It takes 11 on the field at the same time, it takes a minimum of 30 or 40–at minimum–to have both offense and defense, not including players that are involved in our special teams.So, it takes more than one. You do have to allocate your resources, whether it be draft picks or whether it be finances. You have to allocate those resources.There was no question in our mind that Micah(Parsons) could bring a lot of resources in a trade. That has been on my mind since we hired Brian(Schottenheimer). So, there was no question.As it turns out, all the publicity about not having a contract-certainly you did your part in making sure that it was known that he was potentially available, and I appreciate that very much, and I say that a little tongue and cheek. I'm not really as serious about it.But I will say this, that it was important that we did get-if we could get it-the kind of interest that we got in making a trade for Micah.He was an asset that we got four great years out of. But when you're talking about a contract, the kind that he got and for the future, that's quite a commitment. And none of that counts about what he did those first four years, it all goes against what he can do for you in the future-the length of that contract and maybe more.Well then, you've got to really weigh how many players-and I'm just going to give you this-not only do we immediately get a player, but those draft picks could get us-I'm talking top Pro Bowl-type players.”In 1989, Jerry Jones traded a premier running back, Herschel Walker, in exchange for eight draft picks, which included Minnesota’s next three first-round picks.The trade happened between three teams–the Cowboys, Minnesota Vikings, and the San Diego Chargers–and involved eighteen players and draft picks.A similar situation was at stake in the present scenario with Micah Parsons’ trade.Regarding the acquisition of draft picks, Jerry Jones said,“Those draft picks could get top, Pro Bowl-type players. Could. Not necessarily. Let me be quick to say–you won’t necessarily get those players.You’ve got to draft them or acquire them. But they can get us as few as three or any many as five outstanding players.Now, not only do they contribute in a game that needs a lot of players on the field–not to be elementary–but they also give you better odds that they’re going to be a high percentage of those are going to be available just from the standpoint of attrition or from the standpoint of just sheer limit on how far one player can go.Very few players are Deion (Sanders) playing a hundred plays a game out there at the time. So this was not just thought about today.This (Micah Parsons)trade has been going on in our minds and our strategies and being talked about--it's been going on all spring. It culminated today, and it came quick, but that's the way things go. It does happen fast when it happens.But you've laid a lot of things out there on the water to make it happen. I want to be sure that our fans understand I think a lot of Micah, and I wish him so much success.Micah Parsons did an outstanding job for us for four years, and a little bit of the way Herschel Walker may have had his greatest contribution to the Cowboys, what he brought to us when he left could be a tremendous thing for our fans and the success of this team.Kenny Clark. We really knew beginning this spring that if we could pick up a top interior defensive lineman, just to offset not having a pass rusher, even though it's Micah-but where we're long, where we're strong, it's in our pass rushing depth.And we knew, if we could get an interior lineman that that was at least something that would improve us right there on a top interior lineman. He comes in strong for us. And he comes in accomplished for us.”",The dallas cowboys have a history of making blockbuster trades like the herschel walker deal.

Poll Do you think Lalit Modi was right to release the unseen footage of the 'Slap-gate' incident? Yes, it was necessary to reveal the truth No, it reopened old wounds Unsure

NEW DELHI: Former Indian Premier League IPL ) commissioner Lalit Modi has defended his decision to release an unseen video of the infamous 2008 “Slap-gate” incident, saying he only spoke the truth when asked and had no intention of reopening old wounds. His remarks came in response to criticism from Bhuvneshwari, wife of former India pacer S Sreesanth , who slammed Modi and former Australia captain Michael Clarke for reviving the episode through a podcast discussion.The controversy reignited after Modi appeared on Clarke’s Beyond23 Cricket Podcast, where he disclosed previously unseen footage showing Harbhajan Singh striking Sreesanth with a backhanded slap during post-match handshakes between Mumbai Indians and Kings XI Punjab. Harbhajan was later handed an 11-match suspension, and both cricketers have since reconciled, with the former off-spinner publicly apologising multiple times.""I don’t know why she (Sreesanth’s wife Bhuvneshwari) is getting angry. I was asked a question, and I shared the truth. I can’t do anything about that. I am known to speak the truth. Sree was the victim, and that’s exactly what I said. No one had asked me this question earlier, so when Clarke quipped, I responded,"" Modi told IANS.In the podcast, Modi explained how his private security camera had recorded the exact moment after the broadcasters had stopped theirs. ""As players were exchanging handshakes, Bhajji just looked at Sreesanth, said something, and gave him a backhander. That's what the footage shows. I've had it for 18 years,"" Modi said, stressing that the clip had never been made public until now.Bhuvneshwari, however, described the release as ""disgusting, heartless and inhuman."" In a scathing post on social media, she wrote: ""Shame on you @lalitkmodi and @michaelclarkeofficial. Both @sreesanthnair36 and Harbhajan have long moved on in life and are fathers now with school-going children, and yet you try to throw them back into an old wound.""She added that the revival of the controversy was deeply painful for their family: ""@sreesanthnair36 has rebuilt his life with dignity and grace after every hardship he faced. Families are being forced to relive trauma that was buried decades ago. This doesn’t just hurt the players; it scars their innocent children who now have to face questions and shame for no fault of theirs.""Meanwhile, cricket commentator Harsha Bhogle shed light on why the footage had remained suppressed for years. ""Interesting that the Harbhajan-Sreesanth video has found its way out after 17 years. Very few of us had seen it and we had given our word that it would stay out of the public domain because the IPL was in its first year and it wouldn't have been the best bit of news for it,"" Bhogle posted on X.",Lalit modi defends decision to release unseen video of 'slap-gate' incident.

Vaibhav Suryavanshi's impact

NEW DELHI: Before the England tour, Vihaan Malhotra was on the brink of losing his place in the Indian U19 team. The runs had dried up, he was not able to convert his starts. The 18-year-old from Patiala had sacrificed his designated opening role to his two superstar teammates -- Vaibhav Suryavanshi and Ayush Mhatre. Overall, the southpaw was not in a good space.Right before the tour of England, while training at the Cricket Hub Academy in Patiala, Malhotra's coach Kamalpreet Sandhu, who has trained the likes of Prabhsimran Singh, Anmolpreet Singh, Naman Dhir, and Kanika Malhotra, gave him an ultimatum, that he needs to stop cribbing and start working on his new role.""He has opened all his life. Batting at No. 3 was an adjustment for him. I just gave him the reality check that Vaibhav and Ayush had earned it, and what had he done? He should make that No. 3 spot his own,"" Kamalpreet told TimesofIndia.com.Then a day before the big tour, VVS Laxman , the Head of Cricket at the Centre of Excellence (CoE), also shared a few valuable suggestions with the youngster. He ended up scoring 233 runs in five Youth ODIs and was instrumental in India's success in two Youth Tests, with 277 runs with the bat and three crucial wickets with his off-spin.He shied away from disclosing what VVS Laxman told him but said the small input changed his game. He told TimesofIndia.com, ""He just wanted me to enjoy my game. He never goes technical. He gives inputs, small ones, but it was perfect.""""It was an excellent and enthralling experience for me. It was the first time I went to England. I had heard a lot about English playing conditions. The seam movement, the weather, and it tests the technique of the subcontinent batters. There were nerves but I enjoyed the way I batted in England. I made a few technical adjustments and by the end of the tour, I became a better batter,"" he said.His performances have been rewarded with the vice-captaincy for the Australia tour, where the India U-19 side will play three one-day games and two multi-day matches, starting September 21.From battling the seam and swing, he is getting ready for the bouncy tracks of Australia.""For the past one month, he has been training 12 hours a day. I am training him on a wet cement track, sometimes with plastic balls, sometimes with the tennis ball. There are a few bruises but he has improved significantly,"" said Sandhu.For this current India U-19 setup, Vihaan suggests they don't need to look elsewhere for inspiration. They are sharing a dressing room with superstars, who had lit up IPL 2025 with their power-packed batting. Among the opponents, there were two England prodigies -- Rocky Flintoff and Archie Vaughan -- sons of legendary England cricketers Andrew Flintoff and Michael Vaughan , respectively.""The focus on Vaibhav and Ayush kind of helped me as I went under the radar,"" said Malhotra with a laugh.""They knew about Mhatre and Vaibhav. They wanted to get them out early. All the bowlers wanted to get the wicket of IPL players.""Barring his two centuries -- one in Youth Test, the other in Youth ODI -- and watching Shubman Gill's special at Edgbaston, the most enjoyable memory of the England tour was teasing Vaibhav Suryavanshi, when his fans came over to meet him in one of their matches.""Vaibhav ke fans aaye hue the. Wo bol rahe the ki Vaibhav ko bulao, aur use sharm aa rahi thi. Hum use chidhate rehte the (Vaibhav's fans came to meet him. He was signing autographs but was really embarrassed and we also teased him a lot). He is the youngest of the lot, so we always kind of try and take care of him,"" said Malhotra.""In the fourth one-day, I put on 209 runs for the second wicket with Vaibhav. We both scored centuries but he smoked 10 sixes and I had the best seat in the house. His bat swing is something we are in awe of,"" he added. Vihaan scored 129 off 121 balls, whereas Suryavanshi had tonked 143 runs in 78 balls, studded with 13 fours and 10 sixes.Malhotra does seek inspiration from Suryavanshi and Mhatre but believes their presence has only enhanced his appetite.""Cricketing field always teaches you new things. For example, in my case, I have two absolute superstars in my team. Competition is there, and in the future, people will compare us with them as well but it is good for us. When Vaibhav was hitting sixes for fun in the IPL, it pumped me to work hard,"" he said.Malhotra doesn't have any lofty deals. For now, he is getting ready for the Australia tour, followed by the U-19 World Cup to be held next year in Namibia and Zimbabwe. But he has his eyes set on playing domestic cricket.""I really want to break into the Punjab Ranji Trophy team. I want to do well for my state.""Malhotra wants to follow in his idol Shubman Gill's footsteps -- do well in the U-19 World Cup, score heaps of runs in domestic cricket and then, if all goes well, the obvious will happen.",Vihaan malhotra was on the brink of losing his place in the indian u19 team.

Refused ‘broader’ role

Parag captaincy the sticking point?

Is there a chance Samson might stay?

In a major shake-up at Rajasthan Royals , former India captain Rahul Dravid has stepped down as head coach ahead of the IPL-2026 season. This surprise move comes just one year into Dravid’s much-heralded return to the franchise and adds to the uncertainty surrounding the team following reports that regular captain Sanju Samson too wants to move on.Royals confirmed in an official statement on Saturday that Dravid would not carry on as head coach, cutting short a multi-year deal after just a single, disappointing season. The 2025 campaign was a disaster for the 2008 champions — they finished a dismal ninth, with only four wins. The poor performance was compounded by personal challenges for Dravid, as a foot injury sustained in a club match forced him to coach from a wheelchair for much of the season.Dravid has had a long and fruitful association with the franchise. Before this, he played and captained from 2011-2013 and served as mentor in 2014 and 2015.The Royals’ decision comes after a ‘structural review’, following which Dravid was offered a broader, more expansive role within the franchise. However, the cricket legend turned down the offer and expressed a desire to move on. Sources told TOI the franchise’s review meeting was held last month in the UK and was also attended by Dravid.“Rahul has been central to the Royals’ journey over many years. His leadership has influenced a generation of players, built strong values within the squad and left an indelible mark on the culture of the franchise,” the Royals statement read.The decision follows rumours of reported discord between the Royals management and skipper Samson. The wheels started to come off the franchise’s 2025 campaign when such tensions entered the realm of public speculation following some bizarre decisions during the first three games.Because Samson ‘lacked’ full clearance for wicketkeeping duties after a finger surgery, the management used him only as an ‘impact sub’ while Assam player Riyan Parag was made stand-in captain, particularly for matches in Guwahati, the franchise’s second ‘home’.The move backfired and drew fierce criticism from fans and pundits alike, who pointed to Riyan’s own inconsistent performances, especially with the likes of established talents like Yashasvi Jaiswal too available to lead. Later on in the season, rumours of a reported rift between Dravid and Samson also surfaced, which the former denied saying “we are all on the same page”.With Dravid’s storied second stint now over and the captain potentially on his way out, the franchise is faced with a monumental rebuilding task. Sources say the onus is now on director of cricket Kumar Sangakkara to forge a path forward for the team.“The decision on Sanju is still under consideration,” the source added.",Rahul dravid has stepped down as head coach of rajasthan royals. The decision comes after a'structural review' and follows reports that regular captain sanju samson too wants to move on. The 2025 campaign was a disaster for the 2008 champions — they finished a dismal ninth with only four wins.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123610168,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-153630,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Poll Do you think Pakistan can maintain their winning streak leading up to the Asia Cup? Yes, they are in great form No, they will face tougher opponents

Pakistan continued their impressive run of form ahead of the Asia Cup, registering their second consecutive victory in the ongoing T20 tri-series with a 31-run win over the United Arab Emirates in Sharjah on Saturday.Opener Saim Ayub and youngster Hasan Nawaz were the architects of Pakistan’s commanding total of 207, both striking blistering half-centuries. Ayub top-scored with a 38-ball 69 laced with seven fours and four sixes, while Nawaz stole the show with a 26-ball 56, hammering six maximums including a hat-trick of sixes off spinner Haider Ali. Their counter-attacking knocks rescued Pakistan from an early wobble at 74 for three and gave the innings its momentum.Ayub, named Player of the Match, downplayed personal recognition in favour of the team’s collective success. “Different players are performing in different games. Good for the team. I don’t like individual awards, feel it is over-rated. It is a team game. It is all about execution,” he said, adding that he has been working on his bowling as well. “It is challenging in T20s.You need to believe in your thought process. ”Hasan Nawaz, touted as a rising star, shared a 57-run stand with Mohammad Nawaz (25 off 15) to power Pakistan past 200. Faheem Ashraf chipped in with a useful 16 as Pakistan plundered 64 in the final five overs.Despite Junaid Siddique and Saghir Khan’s three-wicket hauls, UAE were left chasing a steep target. Their innings revolved around Asif Khan’s breathtaking 77 off 35 balls, which briefly threatened to turn the game on its head, but he fell in the last over. Skipper Muhammad Waseem also contributed a brisk 33 but admitted afterwards: “We gave 15-20 runs extra. Asif has calibre… we needed someone to score 30-40 runs in the middle overs. We will try our best in the next game.”Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha praised his side’s intent while acknowledging room for improvement. “Perfect batting effort. Last five overs in the bowling we need to work. Hasan Nawaz is a generational talent, one for the future. I want my team to play an aggressive brand of cricket,” he said.With back-to-back wins, including a 39-run victory over Afghanistan on Friday, Pakistan look primed and confident as they build momentum heading into the Asia Cup showdown.","Pakistan beat united arab emirates by 31 runs in t20 tri-series.

New Jersey Devils prospect Arseniy Gritsyuk, who previously had a stellar run at the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL), is all set to arrive in New Jersey this week. It has been revealed by New Jersey Devils assistant general manager Dan MacKinnon to NHL.com recently that Gritsyuk is expected to arrive in New Jersey soon.As per reports, the 24-year-old Russian player was selected 129th overall in the 2019 NHL Draft, the same year the Devils took Jack Hughes first overall. After several seasons in the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL), the winger is now ready to compete for a spot in the NHL. Let’s take a look at what Dan MacKinnon is expecting from Arnesiy this season. Arseniy Gritsyuk , a promising prospect for the New Jersey Devils , is gearing up for a major milestone in his career. This week, he’s making his way to New Jersey to pursue his NHL debut after his stellar run in the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL).As per reports, he officially signed with the Devils in May and is confirmed to be traveling to North America. Fans and the team’s expectations are already set high, as last season, Gritsyuk tallied 17 goals and 27 assists for 44 points in 49 games.Speaking about Arnesiy, the New Jersey Devils assistant general manager Dan MacKinnon said, “If you're looking for an NHL comparison, I look at Evgenii Dadonov, who came over early, but it didn’t work.He went back to the KHL for several years and then came over the second time, which was more in line with the age Gritsyuk is now, and it went very well. He further added, “We’re hoping the added time that Arseni took in the KHL means the first audition sticks. ”Earlier, while speaking to Russian outlet TASS, MacKinnon stated, “I don’t have any favorite hockey players — you evaluate them from a professional point of view. I studied the team’s roster. Yes, there’s Jack Hughes, Nico Hischier — top-six center forwards. I’d like to join them, but we’ll see how ready I am.”New Jersey Devils assistant general manager Dan MacKinnon has shared the exciting lineup of players in his team, including Arnesiy Gritsyuk. He praised the Devils’ two franchise centers, speaking out about their contrasting style of work.Speaking about the dominance of centers, Jack Hughes and Nico Hischier, MacKinnon stated, “Hughes skates well, Hischier is more of a two-way forward, and he can also fight in defense.

Sidney Crosby sets the tone at Canada’s Olympic camp



Connor McDavid follows Sidney Crosby’s subtle leadership cue



Sam Reinhart completes the chain of respect in the interview moment

Crosby’s influence extends beyond goals and trophies



Canada’s men’s hockey stars gathered this week to prepare for the 2026 Winter Olympic Games. The orientation camp brought together elite names such as Sidney Crosby, Connor McDavid , and Sam Reinhart. In the middle of it, a quiet moment stood out. Crosby, known for leading without fanfare, once again showed why he is still viewed as the standard for Canadian hockey.On Friday, players lined up for interviews following practice. Crosby stood next to McDavid and Reinhart, preparing for questions. Before anything began, Crosby leaned toward McDavid and gave a quick nudge. The signal was simple: remove the team hat as a sign of respect for those asking the questions.The act was small, but it captured what Crosby has represented throughout his career. He has never needed speeches to prove his point. His actions consistently show teammates and rivals alike what professionalism looks like. At 38, Crosby is still shaping the culture around him, even with Canada’s brightest young stars beside him.Connor McDavid, already the face of the Edmonton Oilers and one of the game’s most dominant players, reacted immediately.He slipped off his cap and gave a nod of recognition. The moment showed that even hockey’s biggest current star is still learning from Crosby’s approach.Crosby has long been seen as a mentor for McDavid, whether in international tournaments or casual settings. On Friday, the exchange underscored that influence. Without a word spoken, Crosby reminded McDavid of an unwritten standard. Respect for the game and those who cover it is part of what defines Canadian hockey tradition.McDavid then leaned toward Sam Reinhart with the same cue. Reinhart followed suit, removing his cap as well, and in just a few seconds, Crosby’s gesture had shaped the actions of both men. It was leadership passed down in real time.Reinhart, fresh off a Stanley Cup win with the Florida Panthers, is not short on confidence or credentials. But like McDavid, he responded to the example Crosby set. For observers, it showed how habits at the top can influence everyone around, and the chain reaction became a symbol of unity within Canada’s Olympic camp.The brief sequence may not appear on any highlight reel. But it reflects what makes Crosby unique, and he has defined Canadian hockey for nearly two decades. Not only with championships and medals, but also with conduct that embodies humility, his influence remains strong even among players who have built their own legacies.As the countdown to Milan 2026 continues, Canada will lean on experience and skill. Crosby brings both, along with an instinct for moments that remind teammates what respect looks like. In a camp filled with stars, Crosby once again stood apart, not for scoring, but for setting the tone.Also Read: Keep an eye on these NHL sophomores in 2025-26: Cutter Gauthier, Zack Bolduc, Marco Kasper, Will Smith, Mackie Samoskevich","Sidney crosby showed connor mcdavid and sam reinhart why respect still matters.

BENGALURU: The newly operational BCCI Centre of Excellence here transformed into a hub for Indian men's cricket on Saturday. The domestic season opener, Duleep Trophy quarterfinal matches, which began on Thursday, have attracted several international players.Some, like Akashdeep Singh, Sai Sudharsan, and Mayank Yadav have been undergoing rehabilitation at the facility.They were joined by prominent Indian cricketers, most of whom are preparing for the Asia Cup, as they undergo pre-season fitness tests under strength and conditioning coach Adrian le Roux, who joined the team ahead of the England series.The spotlight on Saturday was on India's ODI captain, Rohit Sharma . The 38-year-old, who currently plays only the One-Day format, is expected to participate in India's three-match away series against Australia.Discussions are ongoing about the experienced campaigner, who hasn't played since the Mumbai Indians' IPL game against Punjab Kings on June 1, potentially appearing for India 'A' against Australia 'A' in Kanpur from September 30 to October 5.After completing his pre-season fitness tests, Rohit is expected to practice at the facility for a few days before returning to Mumbai. His last ODI appearance was in the title-winning Champions Trophy final against New Zealand in Dubai in March.As Rohit turned up for the fitness assessment, the question that lingered was: When will Virat Kohli come?Joining Rohit on Saturday were pace bowler Jasprit Bumrah , Test skipper Shubman Gill , Shardul Thakur, Mohammad Siraj, and Yashasvi Jaiswal, while Jitesh Sharma arrived on Friday. Some players, like Thakur, who will lead West Zone in the Duleep Trophy semifinals starting September 4, are likely to stay longer, while Gill, who pulled out as North Zone captain due to illness, along with a few others, is expected to depart for Dubai for the Asia Cup from here.On the day, some players took the opportunity to watch the Duleep Trophy matches and interact with fellow cricketers.","Shubman gill, rohit sharma, jasprit bumrah and shardul thakur reach coe in bengaluru.

The Mohammed Shami story: How Ravi Shastri helped him during testing personal times, divorce & more

Poll What do you believe is more important for Mohammed Shami right now? Focusing on cricket. Resolving personal controversies.

NEW DELHI: Indian pacer Mohammed Shami ’s estranged wife Hasin Jahan has once again sparked attention with a cryptic social media post, shortly after the cricketer opened up about his personal life in a recent interview.Jahan, who has been engaged in a long-running legal battle with Shami, suggested that repeated attempts were being made to “scare” and “ruin” her, but asserted that she would never bow down to such pressures. Referring to the turbulence she faced in 2018 when she filed an FIR against Shami and his family members on charges of domestic violence and match-fixing, Jahan said she had faced tougher times before and emerged stronger.“Pagal awara kutto se darna hota mujhe, to 2018 me hi dar jaati. Jitna chahe jor lagale mujhe darane ki, jhukane ki, barbad karne ki, mai Allah ke karam se aur mazboot aur mazboot bante jaungi inshallah (If I were afraid of crazy stray dogs, I would have been scared back in 2018. No matter how much effort you put into scaring me, breaking me, or ruining me, with Allah's grace, I will keep becoming stronger and stronger, inshallah),” she wrote on Instagram, hinting at those trying to break her resolve.Her post came hours after Shami, in a candid interview, said he preferred not to dwell on the past. “Leave that. I never regret the past. What’s gone is gone. I don’t want to blame anyone, including myself. I want to focus on my cricket. I don’t need these controversies,” the 34-year-old pacer said.Shami and Jahan married in 2014 but began living separately four years later, with their fallout frequently playing out in public. Earlier this month, Jahan alleged that Shami was a “womaniser” and accused him of neglecting their daughter’s education while spending money on his girlfriends.The India speedster, who has been recovering from injury, has maintained that he wants to stay away from controversies. “That’s your job to investigate. Why do you want to hang us to death? Look at the other side as well. I focus on cricket, not controversies,” he remarked when asked about personal disputes among cricketers.With Jahan’s latest post, the off-field tensions between the two have once again come into sharp focus, even as Shami looks to make a full return to competitive cricket.","Mohammed shami's estranged wife hasin jahan posts cryptic message on instagram.

Giannis Antetokounmpo led a win for Greece against Italy

EuroBasket 2025 is in full swing, with European teams featuring major NBA stars. The likes of Luka Doncic, Nikola Jokic, and Giannis Antetokounmpo are representing their nations. Greece, led by Giannis, opened its campaign with a victory over Italy, observed by Milwaukee Bucks assistant coach Darvin Ham. During the game, Ham commented on the differences in Giannis Antetokounmpo’s role between the Greek national team and the Bucks He noted that in the NBA, Giannis has a significantly higher usage rate, constantly handling the ball and playing a central, high-energy role, likened to being “Superman.” In contrast, Greece’s style is more team-oriented, relying on structured plays and a slower pace compared to the fast-paced NBA. Ham also commended the two-time NBA MVP for his ability to involve teammates effectively in Greece’s system.Ham, who won the inaugural NBA In-Season Tournament as head coach of the Los Angeles Lakers and later saw the Bucks claim the NBA Cup last season, remains undefeated in the tournament. Ham joined Doc Rivers’ staff last season for his second stint with Milwaukee, and saw Giannis finish third in MVP voting. Despite his regular-season dominance, the Bucks fell short in the playoffs, suffering a disappointing first-round exit against Tyrese Haliburton and the Indiana Pacers.EuroBasket 2025 began on Thursday, with all teams starting their campaigns. Giannis Antetokounmpo powered Greece to a 75-66 win over Italy, scoring 31 points, grabbing seven rebounds, and dishing two assists in 29 minutes, securing third place in Group C.Greece will face Cyprus next on Saturday.Elsewhere, Nikola Jokic’s Serbia crushed Estonia by 34 points, while Luka Doncic’s Slovenia fell 95-105 to Poland.

Lexie Hull's recent collision has left her with two black eyes

Will Lexie Hull miss out on Indiana Fever's next game against Los Angeles Sparks ?

On Tuesday, August 26, Indiana Fever shooting guard Lexie Hull and Seattle Storm's Gabby Williams were involved in an on-court collision. The whole thing looked pretty nasty to onlookers, and the Fever star definitely looked like she had suffered an injury. And it was revealed 2 days later, on August 28, when, after a fan asked about her well-being, that she is now sporting 2 very distinct black eyes. Not a good look on her for sure!On August 26, the WNBA teams, Indiana Fever and Seattle Storm, met for a pretty standard game of ball. The Fevers won 95 to 75, with Hull making 5 points, 9 rebounds, and 1 assist in the game, before an on-court collision with Seattle Storm's power forward, Gabby Williams, made her go back to the locker room. The whole thing looked pretty awful, and fans were obviously worried about Hull, and if she was okay.Answering a fan question on TikTok, Hull revealed her face in a video, where she was seen with two prominent black eyes. She said, ""It's not doing great, I wish this was a filter, but this is insane... The knot is gone. Instead, I just have two black eyes. So, yeah, this is me!"" Hopefully, the injury more superficial than anything else.The Indiana Fever are all set to face the Los Angeles Sparks on August 29 at the latter's home base. The Fever are the favorites to win the match, even with their star player, Caitlin Clark, missing out after suffering from a right groin injury back in mid-July. And now with Lexie Hull sporting two black eyes, things look even more dicey. But fans aren't confident that the second-to-last team in the WNBA Western Conference will be able to prevail against the Fever.As for Hull, she has not yet been listed on the injury report against the Sparks for their Fever's game on Friday. She even boarded the plane with the rest of her teammates, even if she was still wearing those big sunglasses. The match starts in a few hours, but fans are hoping that Hull will be well enough to be back on the court, even if it's for a little while.Also Read: Ex-NBA player explains what Giannis Antetokounmpo needs to bring in the FIBA EuroBasket","Indiana fever guard lexie hull and seattle storm's gabby williams were involved in an on-court collision on august 26.

Kai Cenat has a history of live-stream explosions



Kai Cenat’s Mafiathon 3 has been in the spotlight since the release of its trailer. While the event’s content cannot be predicted, the one thing that remains certain is that, with the stakes skyrocketing, it’s going to be much bigger than Mafiathon 2. Especially with some of the unexpected challenges and outrageous dares being received, it has made the 30-day event a must-watch.Here is all you need to know about it.In a recent clip circulating online, popular streamer xQc can be seen reacting to the Kai Cenats Mafiathon 3 trailer. Instead of criticism or appreciation, he seemed to have stepped up the game with chaotic advice.xQc did not hold back while he suggested Kai Cenat must commemorate hitting 1 million subscribers by literally blowing up his house.xQc said with a smile, while enthusiastically trying to mimic the sound of a massive explosion.Watching the trailer ahead, he even offered an alternative proposal of organizing a massive giveaway in the middle of the city. He further advised on turning New York City intoThe explosive suggestion coming from him just amplified all the anticipation that surrounds the final subscriber goals of the event.The wild idea coming from xQc is not random. It comes after he watched Michael B. Jordan in Mafiathon 3’s trailer daring Kai Cenat with an unexpected challenge, for going bigger than Mafiathon 2.In the trailer, the Hollywood star dared Cenat to cut his signature hairstyle on reaching 1 million subscribers during a 30-day stream. After some reluctance, Cenat agreed to it, putting his personal style right on the line to commemorate his success.The combination of personal change and property damage has perfectly set the stage for an unforgettable conclusion of the streaming trilogy. It also makes one question whether the dare or the challenge will be fulfilled.While the ideal coming from xQc seems surprising, it’s important to note that this isn’t the first time destruction has been part of the streaming narrative for Kai Cenat. It was just last year when the news spread like fire about how, on July 4, 2024, Cenat’s stream devolved into a fireworks war. The incident involved AMP Davis and, of course, left Cenat’s streaming room in complete ruins. While fans believe it was pre-planned, the memory of the explosive event makes the suggestion of xQc more terrifying and plausible.The precedent that was set by the chaotic celebrations previously confirms that the streamer isn’t a stranger to such explosive challenges and celebrations. It therefore leaves viewers wondering, How far will things go this time? With Mafiathon 3 called the final in the series, there’s already immense pressure on delivering a memorable finale. Only time can tell which advice Cenat accepts and what he ignores.Mafiathon 3 will begin on September 1, 2025.","Kai cenat’s mafiathon 3 has been in the spotlight since the release of its trailer.

“he looks like he’s been huffing silver spray paint, like I REFUSE to believe that is his ACTUAL face hair color!!!!”

“Have fun massaging that strong foot,”

“Dayum Deion”

“shout out to the big dog!”

The buzz around actress Karrueche Tran and NFL legend–turned–Colorado coach Deion Sanders started when she was spotted holding his hand during his cancer surgery recovery. That emotional show of support instantly set off dating rumors, with many fans convinced the two were more than just friends. While Deion hasn’t said a single word about it, the speculation only grew louder as Karrueche continued appearing by his side, turning a private moment into one of the internet’s favorite talking points.Things escalated when Karrueche finally spoke out on thepodcast. She admitted that she is “dating” and “having fun,” but she didn’t name names. Of course, the timing couldn’t be ignored. With her already being spotted during Sanders’ health battle and their closeness in those hospital clips, fans didn’t need much more to put two and two together. Even without Sanders openly confirming, the internet seems pretty convinced that Karrueche’s mystery man is Prime Time himself.As soon as her comments spread online, social media lit up with reactions, some playful, some shady, and some downright brutal. Two themes quickly emerged, fans believe Karrueche has a “celebrity-only” dating pattern, and many just can’t get over the major age gap between her and Sanders.One user summed it up perfectly, tweeting:That line captured what a lot of people were thinking, that Karrueche seems to always be linked to well-known men, whether it was in Hollywood, music, or now the NFL world.Then came the age-gap commentary, with one fan writing:That reaction struck a chord, because it wasn’t just a one-off variation of the same comment flooded timelines. For some, the romance feels sweet and supportive. For others, the fact that Deion is 57 while Karrueche is 36 is a little too much to overlook.Of course, it wouldn’t be Twitter without a few stray jabs. One fan roasted Sanders’ look, writing,While another joked:referencing Sanders’ well-documented health issues.Still, not everyone was trolling. Some fans cheered the couple on, dropping comments likeandreminding everyone that plenty of people actually support the unexpected pairing.Between the trolling about her dating history, the jokes about Sanders’ age, and the memes about his appearance, this new romance has already become a pop culture spectacle. But for every critic, there’s a fan hyping them up.
