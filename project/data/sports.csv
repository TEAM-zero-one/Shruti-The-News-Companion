Just before tipoff of the 2025 NBA Finals between the Indiana Pacers and Oklahoma City Thunder, a moment of spontaneous hilarity unfolded on live television. It is no secret that Inside the NBA is moving to ESPN from TNT. During a crossover segment between ESPN and TNT, ESPN’s Stephen A. Smith brought his signature energy to the set of Inside the NBA, resulting in a playful clash with Shaquille O’Neal and Kenny Smith.In what fans are calling one of the funniest moments of the Finals pregame coverage, Stephen A. Smith walked onto the Inside the NBA set unannounced, getting in the faces of Shaquille O’Neal and Kenny Smith. Smith wasted no time pushing boundaries—literally—by touching Shaq’s head, prompting an exaggerated but hilarious reaction from the NBA legend.“Get your hands off me, Stephen A. Smith,” said O’Neal, dressed in a brown suit, holding the mic in mock protest. The set erupted in laughter, with Kenny Smith jumping in, echoing, “Back up off my guy, man!”Despite the apparent theatrics, the chemistry between the analysts was clear. As the show continued, Stephen A. kept up his antics, interacting with the panel and playfully testing the boundaries of live television decorum.At one point, O’Neal quipped, “Bring me some hot chocolate so I can spill it on your Blazer,” poking fun at Stephen A.’s choice of outfit while keeping the mood light and jovial.The crew’s animated reactions and laughter showed there were no hard feelings, only friendly rivalry and entertainment gold.As the iconic Inside the NBA prepares to leave its longtime home at TNT, fans have been understandably anxious about how the beloved show will transition to ESPN in the 2025-26 season. Fortunately, recent updates suggest the core of the show will remain untouched, especially its freewheeling postgame format.According to Front Office Sports, ESPN plans to give Inside the NBA the same “extensive” postgame airtime that viewers have come to expect. That means fans can still count on Ernie Johnson, Kenny Smith, Charles Barkley, and Shaquille O’Neal delivering their signature mix of analysis, comedy, and chaos without being squeezed by strict runtime limitations.“There will be an extensive post-game show, say sources. ESPN’s goal is to let the post-game segment run as long as it does now on TNT,” the report noted.Still, not everyone on the crew is at ease. Kenny Smith shared his lingering concerns in a recent interview with The New Yorker, focusing on the lack of control the crew had in negotiating the move.“We have the same crew of people doing the show,” Smith said. “But the timing: Are we a half hour now? Are we forty-five minutes? Fifteen minutes?”Also Read: ""NBA stars will be forever stained"": Stephen A.

Cam Skattebo's viral moment provokes criticism over NFL history blind spot



Does Cam Skattebo know ball? 🧠

A generation gap or something more?







New York Giants first-year running back Cameron Skattebo became the focus of an unintended NFL tempest—nothing on the field, but for seemingly not knowing anything about the league's greatest legends. In one recent video making its rounds on the internet, Cameron Skattebo can't recognize NFL legends from their pictures, kicking off an emotional Reddit discussion in which fans toggle between anger and empathy.Cameron Skattebo, who played college football at Sacramento State Hornets and Arizona State Sun Devils before the New York Giants drafted him in the fourth round of the 2025 NFL Draft, soon found himself a topic of conversation on Reddit—but not the kind related to his athleticism.In one clip of him now circulating, Cameron Skattebo misidentifies players during a quiz segment. When presented with a picture of Calvin Johnson, better known as ‘Megatron,’ confusion set in.Redditors were both amused and frustrated. One of the top comments stated, “Not knowing Calvin is wild, but an NFL player not knowing Brett Favre is crazy ffs.”Another commenter joked, “Banish him from the league for this,” and others reluctantly empathized, one of them noting, “To be fair, though, Calvin retired when Skattebo woulda been like 13 or 14, and he wasn’t a guy who was in many commercials or broadcast booths.So it’s not thaaaat crazy with all that in mind.”""They’re so disappointed they’re almost speechless by the end lol. The joy fully sucked out of the room,"" another user said.The discussion soon escalated beyond Skattebo, with wider questions about how younger players identify with the history of the league. One commenter wrote that most players don't grow up watching the NFL but rather center on their own development or college careers. “A lot of these guys don't even follow the NFL til they get to the league. Might have been a college fan, or just doesn't watch football,” another Redditor wrote.Even fans conceded trouble identifying helmet-wearing players by face alone. “Not really. I wouldn’t recognize Joe Montana from face alone probably. I definitely wouldn’t recognize megatron from face alone. I think people here are forgetting these dudes play in helmets lol. Outside of a handful of players there’s probably not many non-Eagles I could recognize,” admitted one commenter.Nevertheless, the overall opinion was tilted towards incredulity, particularly in light of Johnson's place in NFL legend.Also read: ‘I still have more to prove’: Giants rookie Cam Skattebo’s giant ambitions While the NFL fan base in turn roasted and justified Cameron Skattebo's viral blunder, the moment highlighted something greater—the transience of fame, the changing tides of fandom across generations, and the way legacy players disappear from popular consciousness sooner than we want them to.

Allen Iverson shares posts dedicated to son Isaiah Rahsaan Iverson and wife Tawanna Turner





Former NBA legend, Allen Iverson shares a heartwarming post for his son, Isaiah Rahsaan Iverson on his Instagram. The post contains photos from Isaiah’s childhood, teenage years, and graduation ceremony. Allen went on to praise him saying that he’s the true definition of what a son should be, and the way he always looks out for family is what makes him better than others. He goes on to say how proud of a father he is. However, this post came days after Allen dedicated an entire post for ex-wife, Tawanna Turner.Allen Iverson talks profoundly about his son Isaiah on his recent Instagram post. He talks about Isaiah’s qualities and how he is a son that every father will be proud of.“The true definition of a son,” says Allen as he starts the post, showing how proud he is of Isaiah.Iverson further went on to say how Isaiah takes care of his mother and siblings, and never disrespects his parents. He also went on to say that Isaiah always puts family first and takes responsibility heads on. From his post it seems after Allen and Tawanna separated, it was Isaiah who put on the ""head of the family"" tag and took good care of the family.However, this post comes days after Allen dedicated an entire post to ex-wife Tawanna Turner, with whom he shares five children, Allen Iverson II, Isaiah Rahsaan Iverson, Dream Alijha, Tiaura, and Messiah Lauren. The post had a montage of the couple’s photos from prom, early court days, and as such. Allen captioned the photo as “HER” followed by heart and crossed fingers emoticons.Allen and Tawanna tied the knot in 2001, and had a happy marriage for quite some years. However, trouble entered their married life in the form of lavish expenditures, Iverson’s questionable parenting skills, and alcohol habits. In 2013, when Iverson retired from the world of NBA, his married life also came to an end. The couple called it quits in 2013 and agreed to co-parenting their kids.However, it seems Allen’s life turned upside down soon after his lady luck left. After retirement, Allen spent all of his fortune on expensive cars, and lavish lifestyle. Due to this, he became bankrupt by 2015.Allen was at his top during his time with the Philadelphia 76ers, when he won the MVP of the year in 2001. He also went on to win the Rookie of the Year award in 1997. It was during this time that Iverson was the peak of his career, after which his life took a complete 180-degree turn.However, things have started taking turn for Iverson as he recently signed a deal with Reebok and agreed to be the Vice President of basketball division for the brand. He had earlier made a lifetime deal with Reebok back in 2001, which brought him $800,000 per year. The contract also had a clause that stated Iverson will get an additional $32 million at the age of 55. Will the new role help Iverson turn the course of events or will he fall back into old habits? It remains to be seen.Also Read: Carmelo Anthony spilled beans on weirdest reason why Larry Brown suspended LeBron James, Allen Iverson, and Amar’e Stoudemire just before Olympics","Allen iverson shares posts dedicated to son isaiah rahsaan iverson and wife tawanna turner.

Brad Marchand hints this could be his last Stanley Cup Final appearance







As the Florida Panthers battle the Edmonton Oilers in the 2025 Stanley Cup Final, whispers about Brad Marchand’s NHL future are growing louder—and more expensive. After a standout playoff run that reignited his reputation, the 36-year-old veteran is reportedly attracting major interest across the league, with teams like the Toronto Maple Leafs and Edmonton Oilers emerging as potential suitors.Brad Marchand, once the heart of the Boston Bruins, reinvented himself this season with the Panthers after a surprising late-career move. The gritty winger seamlessly fit into Florida’s hard-hitting system, helping the team surge through the playoffs. He played a pivotal role in narrowing Toronto’s series lead with a dramatic overtime goal in Game 3—his fifth game-winning postseason goal against the Leafs.But despite his impact, Marchand’s time in Florida may be short-lived.According to NHL insider Chris Johnston, “Brad Marchand will have plenty of teams interested, some willing to offer $8M per.” The Panthers, he added, are “unlikely to be able to keep him.” That quote has stirred intense speculation that the Leafs or Oilers could go “all in” on Marchand when free agency opens on July 1.TSN’s Bryan Hayes and Jeff O’Neil even endorsed the idea during a recent discussion. “100%-110%. I confirm it,” Hayes declared.O’Neil added, “Yes, I confirm it. Why not?”—a dramatic shift in tone for fans who once viewed Marchand as Toronto’s biggest playoff nemesis.Amid the rumors, Marchand himself has been reflective. Speaking to NHL.com’s Amalie Benjamin, he acknowledged, “Statistically, it’ll most likely be my last one. Hopefully it’s not, but that’s just how this game works.” He echoed that sentiment with Elliotte Friedman, saying, “I’ve thought about... potential situations. But till you really know what options are like, it’s all theoretical.”Still, Marchand is focused on the present. “I kind of parked all that, and I’m just especially right now just being in the moment and enjoying it,” he said. Wherever he lands next, one thing is clear: Marchand isn’t done making waves.Also Read: “Harshest critics”: Wayne Gretzky's daughter Paulina Gretzky on overcoming criticism and learning to love herself unapologetically","Brad marchand is reportedly attracting interest from multiple teams, including big spenders.

Jonathan Marchessault’s track record could make him a worthwhile gamble





As the Toronto Maple Leafs confront yet another disappointing early playoff exit, the offseason has quickly become one of the most pivotal in recent franchise memory. With major changes looming and star winger Mitch Marner widely expected to test free agency, Toronto’s front office is reportedly weighing aggressive options — including a potential trade for Nashville Predators veteran Jonathan Marchessault.According to Lyle Richardson of Bleacher Report, Jonathan Marchessault is viewed as a potential target for the Leafs as they search for ways to replace Marner’s elite offensive output. The longtime NHL forward, known for his playoff poise and scoring touch, could be a short-term solution for a team desperate to end its 58-year Stanley Cup drought.“Marchessault's contract could be worrisome,” Richardson wrote, “but the Leafs are in ‘win now’ mode and desperate to end their 58-year Stanley Cup drought. Given his previous playoff success and postseason MVP credentials, they could take that risk if they can get him at a reduced salary.”Marchessault’s first season in Nashville didn’t live up to expectations. Despite appearing in 78 games, he tallied just 21 goals and 35 points — a noticeable dip from his past production. Still, his resume is hard to ignore: over his 12-year NHL career, he’s topped the 20-goal mark eight times and was instrumental in the Vegas Golden Knights’ 2023 Stanley Cup run, where he earned Conn Smythe honors as postseason MVP.Toronto may be hoping that a change of scenery and a strong supporting cast could help the 33-year-old rediscover his scoring groove.While the Maple Leafs would love to add a player of Marchessault’s caliber, pulling off a deal with Nashville may not be simple. Toronto lacks a deep pool of draft picks and top-tier prospects, which could complicate negotiations. However, if the Predators are eager to offload Marchessault’s contract, a reduced-price deal may become more realistic.Also Read: 2025 Stanley Cup anthem drama: Oilers stick with tradition as Panthers face backlash over botched performance For a team caught between contention and frustration, acquiring Marchessault could signal Toronto’s intent to double down on winning now — no matter the cost.",Maple leafs are reportedly considering acquiring nashville predators veteran jonathan marchessault.

Tommy Rees, offensive coordinator of the Cleveland Browns, is substantiating that all four of his quarterbacks get equal repetitions of drills or plays during practice. But Mike Florio of Pro Football Talk at NBC Sports thinks Kenny Pickett might be the odd man out of the quartet competition at the starting position. Why? Because Joe Flacco has the experience and the fan base. Shedeur Sanders and Dillon Gabriel might be the long-term solution to the Cleveland Browns quarterback problem!However, that’s not all. Tommy Rees is not sure. He says they are all pushing one another to put their best foot forward. Rees says by the time September rolls, they’ll be ready to go! With whom? Only time will tell. Three months to go. For now, Rees is concentrating on the present moment. Let’s hear what he has to say about the reps and quarterbacks.On June 5, Chris Easterling of Akron Beacon Journal reported that Joe Flacco and Kenny Pickett got early 11-on-11 reps in the first open OTA, but in the second OTA, Shedeur Sanders and Dillon Gabriel got their share of the reps as well. Talking about this, Tommy Rees explained further,“Rotation day by day has been kind of fluid. We’re going to continue to work with all the guys we have.We’re going to develop all four of them, and you know, we’re going to push the reps. We’re going to find ways to be creative to make sure that they all have opportunities to develop and put their best foot forward. And you know, when the time comes, we’ll continue to push guys forward as they are.”Tommy Rees diverts focus from the QB situation to other players and says this competition is a great way to maximize the potential of other players. Rees shared, “It’s a great way to maximize, look, it’s not just one position group that’s able to get maximized. You look at young wideouts, young linemen, young skill players across the board that we can get so many reps for now.Instead of them just getting the reps from the sideline or mental reps…now they’re actually out there learning on the fly, and things come up. You might run the same play on two different fields, get two different defenses, and now you have two opportunities to coach off of. So I really do think it benefits the entirety of the team.”Tommy Rees did not spill the beans on who will be the odd man out, but he said, “You can see them all winning the job, I think, right? And, so, in terms of the competition, we’re so early in the process. We’re so early in evaluating that. Yeah, I think, you know, we have a good group of guys that continue to push one another, and by the time September rolls around, we’ll be ready to go.”Mike Florio of Pro Football Talk thinks QB Kenny Pickett may be the odd one out who will end up being traded. On June 5, Florio wrote, “They will trim the competition to three before training camp opens, with one of the quartet being traded. We still think Pickett will be the odd man out, but that’s just a hunch.”Florio said Joe Flacco has the experience and the affection of the fan base. The other two 2025 NFL draftees, Dillon Gabriel and Shedeur Sanders, could become the long-term answer to solving the quarterback problem with the Cleveland Browns.","Tommy rees, offensive coordinator of the cleveland browns, is substantiating that all four of his quarterbacks get equal repetitions of drills or plays during practice.

So I think that it’s mostly that, just knowing that the groundwork has been laid, and I feel good about the position that I’ve left them in. So I feel comfortable with seeing where my passions are able to take me.”LeBron James and Savannah James recently celebrated a new milestone in their second eldest son, Bryce Maximus’ life, who went on to complete his high school in Sierra Canyon.

The Kansas City Current, co-owned by Brittany Mahomes, has surged to a remarkable $275 million valuation — a staggering 266% increase — making it one of the most valuable teams in the National Women’s Soccer League (NWSL). This explosive growth is a direct result of bold investments in infrastructure, talent, and fan engagement, placing the franchise at the heart of a new era in women’s sports.The club’s rise is fueled by its groundbreaking stadium project — the CPKC Stadium — which opened in March 2024 as the first purpose-built stadium exclusively for a women’s professional soccer team. The $120 million venue, entirely privately funded, has become a symbol of progress in the sports world. With a seating capacity of 11,500 and record-breaking sellouts, the stadium alone has significantly boosted the franchise’s brand value and fan base.Equally important is the $18 million training facility unveiled in 2022, which provides state-of-the-art amenities, sports science integration, and a professional-grade environment that rivals top men’s clubs. These strategic moves have not only enhanced player performance but also attracted top-tier athletes and coaching staff to Kansas City.Brittany Mahomes, a former soccer player herself, has played a pivotal role in shaping the Current’s vision since its rebirth in 2020. Her involvement, combined with the entry of husband and NFL star Patrick Mahomes as a co-owner in 2023, has amplified visibility and credibility. Patrick became the first active NFL player to own a stake in an NWSL franchise, further elevating the club’s national profile.The franchise’s growth mirrors the broader surge in women’s sports, with the NWSL experiencing record attendance and increasing media rights deals. In 2023 alone, league-wide viewership jumped over 400%, and the Current consistently outperformed the league average in both ticket sales and engagement.With recent successes like the 2024 NWSL x Liga MX Femenil Summer Cup title and a 2022 championship game appearance, Kansas City is not just building off the field — it’s winning on it too.Also read: Rashee Rice returns to practice with Chiefs after legal drama, joins Patrick Mahomes to refocus on 2025 NFL season The Kansas City Current’s meteoric valuation stands as a testament to what visionary ownership and focused investment can achieve.

Controversy around the Imane Khelif’s gold medal at Paris Olympic



IOC calls findings misinformation



Response of World Boxing

Fairness and safety concerns from athletes and federations



Ongoing debate on gender and sport eligibility





A leaked medical report from the 2023 World Championships has revealed that Olympic boxing champion Imane Khelifis biologically male, according to chromosome analysis. The report, made public just days after World Boxing ordered Khelif to undergo sex testing for eligibility in future female competitions, shows she has a male XY karyotype. This revelation challenges the International Olympic Committee’s (IOC) earlier dismissal of such tests and has intensified debate over fairness and safety in women’s boxing. The findings come amid ongoing controversy surrounding Khelif’s participation in women’s events, sparking calls for stricter verification procedures in sport.The report, published on the 3 Wire Sports website, states that Khelif’s chromosome analysis is “abnormal” and confirms a male karyotype. It was conducted by Dr Lal PathLabs in New Delhi, a lab accredited by the American College of Pathologists and certified by the International Organisation for Standardisation. This directly challenges the IOC’s spokesperson Mark Adams, who had described such test results as “ad hoc” and “not legitimate” during a press conference at the Paris Olympics.The controversy surrounding Imane Khelif ’s Olympic gold medal run began as early as her first bout in Paris, where she faced Italy’s Angela Carini.Carini, an experienced and respected boxer, was visibly shaken during the match. Overwhelmed by Khelif’s strength and intensity, she appeared distressed and left the ring in tears after the fight, later telling media she had feared for her safety. The unease only deepened in the final bout, where Khelif defeated Taiwan’s Lin Yu-ting in a dominant display that many felt was physically one-sided. The power difference between the fighters drew sharp criticism, with commentators and athletes calling it “uncomfortable to watch” and likening it to watching a man beat a woman in the ring. The moment became one of the most controversial of the Paris Games, fuelling an international debate over fairness and inclusion in women’s sport.IOC president Thomas Bach dismissed the report as part of a Russian-led misinformation campaign, citing ethical and financial issues within the International Boxing Association (IBA), which conducted the tests. Despite these claims, the legitimacy of the Indian lab’s certification has increased pressure on the IOC to clarify its position and respond to questions about Khelif’s eligibility.Following the leak, World Boxing has declared that Khelif must pass mandatory chromosome testing before competing in any future female events. The 26-year-old Olympic champion, who was allowed to compete in Paris due to her female passport status, has so far not provided evidence to confirm female chromosomes. World Boxing now requires all athletes over 18 in its competitions to undergo PCR genetic testing to verify their sex, a measure introduced in response to this controversy.The case has raised serious safety and fairness concerns within the boxing community. Opponents like Italy’s Angela Carini and Mexico’s Brianda Tamara have spoken out about the physical challenges they faced competing against Khelif. Latin American federations have been particularly vocal, urging that women’s competitions be restricted to athletes assigned female at birth, in order to protect fairness and athlete safety.The Khelif controversy highlights the complex and sensitive issues surrounding transgender and intersex athletes in competitive sport. It underscores the need for clear, consistent policies that balance inclusivity with fairness and safety. As governing bodies reassess their rules, the case remains a key example of the challenges faced in maintaining the integrity of women’s sports.The ongoing debate around Imane Khelif’s case brings to light just how complex and emotionally charged the conversation about gender and eligibility in sport has become. At the heart of it are real athletes — women who train for years and step into the ring expecting fairness. Many feel blindsided and unheard when competing against opponents whose physical attributes raise legitimate concerns about safety and equality. This isn’t about exclusion, but about protecting hard-won opportunities for women in sport. Khelif’s story reminds us that governing bodies must act transparently, thoughtfully, and with empathy for all athletes involved.",Imane khelif ’s medical report contradicts ioc’s official position.

England squad for 1st Test against India





The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) on Thursday announced a 14-member squad for the first Test of the five-match series against India, scheduled to begin on June 20, 2025, at Headingley in Leeds.The big news from the selection is the return of fast-bowling all-rounder Jamie Overton, who has been included in the squad in place of his injured Surrey teammate Gus Atkinson. The 31-year-old all-rounder, who has been a regular in England’s white-ball sides, made his only Test appearance in 2022 against New Zealand, impressing with a knock of 97 and picking up two wickets.Ben Stokes will continue to lead the side, with familiar faces like Joe Root, Zak Crawley, and Ollie Pope forming the core of the batting unit. Young talents such as Shoaib Bashir, Jacob Bethell, and Jamie Smith have also been retained as England look to build a balanced squad blending youth and experience.The return of 21-year-old Bethell adds depth — and a selection headache. Fresh off an IPL title win with Royal Challengers Bengaluru, Bethell impressed on his Test debut in New Zealand, averaging 52 with three fifties at No.3. His presence puts pressure on Pope and Crawley, although both scored centuries in the recent Zimbabwe series.Experienced campaigners Chris Woakes and Josh Tongue will support the pace attack, while Sam Cook and Brydon Carse offer additional options with the ball. Both Woakes and Carse are returning from injury layoffs.India will be touring England for a much-anticipated five-match Test series as part of the 2025-27 World Test Championship cycle. The first Test at Headingley promises to set the tone for a fiercely contested summer.Ben Stokes (Durham) – Captain, Shoaib Bashir (Somerset), Jacob Bethell (Warwickshire), Harry Brook (Yorkshire), Brydon Carse (Durham), Sam Cook (Essex), Zak Crawley (Kent), Ben Duckett (Nottinghamshire), Jamie Overton (Surrey), Ollie Pope (Surrey), Joe Root (Yorkshire), Jamie Smith (Surrey), Josh Tongue (Nottinghamshire), Chris Woakes (Warwickshire)","England announce 14-member squad for first test of five-match series against india.

However, Iyer’s early exit — caught behind for just 1 off 2 balls while attempting an ill-judged shot off Romario Shepherd — emerged as the turning point in Punjab’s failed chase of 191.Speaking to ANI, Yograj Singh didn’t mince words. “The shot which Shreyas Iyer played in the final was a criminal offence, according to me. Ashok Mankad told me about this criminal offence, which comes under Section 302. He also told me that the repercussions of this is that you will be banned for two matches. What Shreyas did yesterday is not acceptable. There is no apology for that.”Batting first, RCB posted 190/9, with contributions from Virat Kohli (43), Rajat Patidar (26), and Jitesh Sharma (24). PBKS responded strongly with Shashank Singh’s unbeaten 61 and Josh Inglis’ quickfire 39, but a disciplined bowling effort from Krunal Pandya (2/17) and others held them back at 184/7.Despite Shashank’s 22-run blitz in the final over, PBKS fell just short, with Iyer’s early departure drawing heavy scrutiny as RCB celebrated long-awaited glory.",Former india cricketer yograj singh launches scathing attack on punjab kings captain shreyas iyer for his reckless dismissal in the ipl 2025 final.
