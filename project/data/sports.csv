Golden State Warriors and the Orlando Magic

Golden State Warriors’ Injury Report vs the Orlando Magic (November 18, 2025)

Orlando Magic’s Injury Concerns vs the Golden State Warriors (November 18, 2025)

How the Injuries Could Shape the Game

Thewill meet on November 18, 2025, in a regular-season clash that will be shaped heavily by injuries on both sides. As both teams head into a demanding stretch of the NBA calendar, the absence of key contributors will add intrigue to a matchup already fueled by contrasting styles - Golden State’s perimeter-oriented offense versus Orlando’s evolving defensive identity.With several rotational players sidelined, the contest is expected to become a test of depth, adaptability, and coaching adjustments. Both teams will be forced to redistribute responsibilities, lean on unexpected contributors, and rely on their established stars to steady the pace. Understanding the injury landscape on both sides helps explain how the game may unfold and why certain matchups could become more important than usual.The Golden State Warriors will enter the night dealing with multiple absences that may influence their game plan. Jonathan Kuminga, sidelined due to bilateral knee patellar tendonitis, is expected to miss the game entirely as he continues managing a persistent condition that has affected his mobility and availability throughout the season. His absence will remove one of Golden State’s most athletic two-way options on the wing.De’Anthony Melton will also be unavailable while recovering from left ACL surgery, thinning the Golden State Warriors’ backcourt depth and removing a strong defensive presence. Buddy Hield, listed as probable as he battles an illness, adds another layer of uncertainty to Golden State’s rotation. With these gaps, the Warriors may lean more heavily on supporting pieces, including players like Moses Moody, who has stepped up in recent outings to provide scoring and perimeter defense.Orlando Magic will enter the matchup with its own list of critical injuries. Paolo Banchero, the team’s rising star forward, is expected to remain out with a left groin strain, marking his third consecutive missed game. His absence will weaken both the Magic’s offense and interior defense. Jalen Suggs is questionable due to right groin soreness and is considered close to a return, though final availability will be confirmed before tip-off.The Orlando Magic will also be without Moritz Wagner, who continues recovering from a left knee injury, adding strain to their frontcourt rotation. Two-way players Colin Castleton and Orlando Robinson will be unavailable as well, reducing flexibility for lineup experimentation. Jamal Cain is cleared to play and is anticipated to receive increased opportunities. Franz Wagner, dealing with a recent facial injury, will be available but will require a protective mask.Also read: Is Stephen Curry playing tonight vs the Orlando Magic? Latest update on the Golden State Warriors star's injury report (November 18, 2025) Both teams are expected to feel the ripple effects of their missing players. Golden State Warriors will have to compensate for Kuminga’s athleticism and Melton’s defense, placing more pressure on their perimeter creators and bench. Orlando Magic, missing Banchero, will likely face challenges generating consistent offense but may lean on defensive effort and physicality to stay competitive. With Stephen Curry remaining the focal point for Golden State, the matchup will likely showcase how injuries can reshape an NBA game’s rhythm, strategy, and overall tone in a long, grueling season.","The golden state warriors and the orlando magic will meet on november 18, 2025.

Potential Concerns

Will the Trade Actually Happen?

Thehave burst out to a strong 9-3 start, winning four of their last five games, but there’s still a noticeable gap in their backcourt. With Fred VanVleet sidelined for the entire 2025-26 season due to an ACL injury, Houston is operating without a true point guard - and that absence is shaping the conversation around the team’s long-term ceiling. Amen Thompson has stepped up admirably, yet the franchise ideally wants him back in his natural off-ball role, pushing the front office to explore creative options.That exploration has led to a surprising blockbuster trade idea: reuniting Kevin Durant with NBA champion Kyrie Irving. The concept, highlighted by CBS Sports’ Sam Quinn, suggests Houston could take advantage of Dallas’ uncertainty around Irving’s future while addressing its own need for a primary playmaker. With the Rockets already thriving without VanVleet and Dorian Finney-Smith yet to suit up, the proposal is gaining attention - especially with Irving expected to return later this season from his ACL setback.The Houston Rockets are navigating the season with Amen Thompson stepping into playmaking duties, but the organization ideally wants him back in his natural off-ball role. Meanwhile, VanVleet is expected to miss the entire 2025-26 season, leaving Houston without a veteran distributor.According to CBS Sports writer Sam Quinn, Kyrie Irving stands out as a surprisingly logical target given the Rockets’ roster construction and timeline. As Quinn wrote last Thursday, “Irving’s trade value is a total mystery. There’s really only one team that makes sense, and that’s Houston, where he could reunite with Kevin Durant.” (H/t: Sporting News)Irving is currently recovering from a torn ACL but is projected to return later this season - unlike VanVleet. Even with the risk, the potential reward of pairing Irving with Durant again is enough to generate intrigue for the surging Western Conference team.Here is the structure of the hypothetical deal outlined by Quinn, which brings significant star power to the Houston Rockets without heavy disruption to their rotation:Quinn notes that the Houston Rockets “wouldn’t really miss” Finney-Smith in this scenario since the veteran forward has yet to debut for Houston this year.Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving shared the court for 2.5 seasons with the Brooklyn Nets. Although their tenure fell short of championship expectations, the duo delivered some of the most electric basketball of the early 2020s.• Irving’s elite ball-handling and shot-making• Durant’s effortless scoring from all three levels• Their ability to take over games individually or interchangeably• Ratings-friendly, highlight-heavy playstyleThe Nets didn’t capture a title or even reach the Finals during their run, but few duos matched their entertainment value or scoring chemistry.• The Rockets are winning without a true point guard• VanVleet is sidelined all season• Irving is expected to return before the playoffs• Durant benefits from high-level shot creation next to him• The Western Conference race is tightening, making veteran experience valuableIf Houston continues its strong play deep into the season, taking a calculated swing on Irving could elevate the team into legitimate contender territory.• Irving’s health following ACL recovery• Contract commitment (three years remaining, $118 million)• Team chemistry with a young core• Fit alongside Durant in a new system• Long-term flexibility versus short-term upside• A true point guard with elite scoring ability• A proven playoff performer when healthy• Immediate pressure relieved from Amen Thompson• Championship-level tandem with Durant• Availability issues• Contract size• Risk of disrupting team rhythm• Defensive liabilities in certain matchupsEverything hinges on timing. If Houston maintains its momentum and Irving nears a healthy return, the franchise may find it worthwhile to “give the former Cleveland Cavaliers star a look on the trade market,” as the original article suggests.For now, the rumor exists as an intriguing hypothetical - one that connects an overachieving young team with two aging superstars who once formed one of the league’s must-watch duos.Also read: NBA trade rumors: Los Angeles Lakers could sign $54 million Dallas Mavericks superstar to for deadly duo with Luka Doncic And as Sam Quinn emphasized, “They’re not going to trade Irving just to trade him. They’d have to get something of substance.” Whether Houston decides to be that team will be one of the season’s most fascinating subplots.","The houston rockets are off to a strong 9-3 start, winning four of their last five games.

How “Tweaker” Became a Cultural Phenomenon

GELO - Tweaker (Official Video)

Tweaker 's Chart Domination and Viral Impact on Fans

How LiAngelo Ball Went From Basketball to Music Trailblazer

LiAngelo Ball’s transformation from overlooked basketball prospect to music industry headliner has officially reached a historic milestone. His debut single “Tweaker,” released under the stage name Gelo, has achieved platinum status - an achievement that puts him in the same conversation as heavyweight artists like Drake . For an athlete-turned-musician, this level of success is both unprecedented and culturally significant, signaling a genuine crossover moment that few have ever achieved.This accomplishment not only redefines LiAngelo’s public identity but also marks the peak of a rapid rise that began in early 2025. From a player often overshadowed by his brothers Lonzo and LaMelo Ball, LiAngelo has carved out an entirely new lane, proving that his artistic instincts and musical ambition were far more than a curiosity.Released in January 2025, “Tweaker” exploded online almost instantly. Its nostalgic, bouncy beat - powered by piano, organ keys, and lush synth pads - captured the spirit of early-2000s hip-hop. Paired with Gelo’s melodic, sing-song delivery and a catchy “whoa” hook reminiscent of Big Tymers-era anthems, the track resonated widely. Produced by Kunica and Glockie Cheez, the song painted a picture of luxury, swagger, and newfound fame, creating an irresistible vibe that appealed to both younger listeners and fans of classic hip-hop aesthetics.Its momentum grew even stronger as the song spread into sports culture.NBA and NFL teams, including the Detroit Lions, Chicago Bulls, and Cleveland Cavaliers, embraced “Tweaker” as a celebratory anthem in locker rooms and warm-up sessions, pushing its reach far beyond the usual music circles.The success of “Tweaker” eventually led to a massive $13 million record deal with Def Jam and Universal Music Group. The contract included an extraordinary $8 million guaranteed signing bonus—more than what many current NBA players earn annually. This landmark deal solidified Gelo’s credibility and marketability within the hip-hop and R&B world.Adding even more momentum, a high-profile remix featuring Lil Wayne elevated the track’s status, giving it a stamp of approval from one of rap’s most influential figures.“Tweaker” made history by reaching No. 1 on the US Rhythmic Billboard chart - an exceptional feat for a debut single from a former basketball player. The song sparked viral dance trends across social platforms and earned praise from artists like T-Pain, Lil Yachty, and Joe Budden. Its appeal spanned music, sports, and online culture, cementing LiAngelo Ball as 2025’s breakout music star.Before his rise in music, LiAngelo Ball spent years navigating international basketball leagues and the NBA G-League. Eventually, he stepped away from the sport entirely - a decision validated by his explosive success. His debut album League of My Own, released in July 2025, showcased his evolution as an artist and reaffirmed his place in the industry.LiAngelo Ball’s platinum achievement for “Tweaker” is more than a win for himself - it is a defining cultural moment. By stepping into music and dominating charts, he has written a rare success story that bridges athletics, entertainment, and mainstream culture.","Liangelo ball’s debut single “tweaker,” released under the stage name gelo, has achieved platinum status.

"""They get paid to make remarks"": Drake Maye challenges Cam Newton’s claim that Patriots’ surprising 2025 campaign is just ‘fool’s gold’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/they-get-paid-to-make-remarks-drake-maye-challenges-cam-newtons-claim-that-patriots-surprising-2025-campaign-is-just-fools-gold/articleshow/125424246.cms,"Drake Maye and Mike Vrabel unite in response to Cam Newton’s harsh ‘fool’s gold’ jab at Patriots (Getty Images)

Drake Maye fires back as Cam Newton calls Patriots’ early success ‘fool’s gold’ in bold season drama



The Patriots keep stacking wins, but not everyone is willing to celebrate their climb. Cam Newton, once the face of Carolina football and later a one-year starter in New England, is not convinced the Patriots’ 9–2 start deserves real praise. His sharp comments arrived on ESPN’s First Take after the Patriots’ 27–14 victory over the Jets, a win that tightened their grip on the AFC East. Instead of focusing on the surge behind rookie quarterback Drake Maye, Newton questioned whether the team’s rise can withstand tougher competition ahead.During the show, Newton dismissed the idea that the AFC now runs through Foxborough. He called the Patriots’ record “fool's gold,” adding an even sharper comparison. “Cubic zirconia, middle of the mall,” ranted Newton when asked if the AFC now runs through Foxborough. He acknowledged Maye’s strong play but credited it to one familiar coach. “And yes, is Drake Maye playing good football? Absolutely. And I would like to attest his great play to one specific person that I know too well, Josh McDaniels. Now, Josh McDaniels may not be a great head coach, but he is a brilliant offensive mind.”Newton later pushed further, saying, “The thing that I have a problem with. Is if you keep playing sorry scrubs, then you’re going to have this falsetto of a mentality going into the playoffs, and it has one-and-done written all over it.”Newton’s comments carried extra weight because Maye grew up admiring him in North Carolina. When Maye was asked about the criticism during his weekly radio appearance on WEEI, he brushed it off. ""Oh no, I don’t even know what show he’s on,"" Maye explained. ""I think they get paid to make remarks and make certain comments. So, I just worry about what people in our organization think, and worry about we think and what my teammates think. People are going to have different opinions. I’m just going out there on Sunday and worrying about ourselves.""Patriots coach Mike Vrabel also weighed in and refused to turn Newton’s comments into fuel. “What are we gonna do, put Cam Newton clips up there?"" he joked on WEEI's The Greg Hill Show. “We’d rather put our clips or the Bengals clips.” He added, ""Anything that anybody says, we are going to come to work, we’re going to focus on us. We’re going to try to improve, and we’re going to focus on the Bengals, and going on the road, trying to get our 10th win. ""Newton may have a point about the schedule. New England opened the season with one of the league’s easiest slates and only three of their nine wins came against teams with winning records. Still, the Patriots now control their path. With matchups against the Bengals, Giants, Bills, Ravens, Jets and Dolphins, they are chasing both a playoff return and their first division title since 2019.Also Read: Bernie Kosar shares emotional video update after life-saving liver transplant following canceled surgery and internal bleeding scare","Drake maye and mike vrabel unite in response to cam newton's harsh ‘fool’s gold’ jab at patriots.

People don’t want to go to Stillwater. People want to go to Houston. It was just different. And I could feel it even beforehand. Everybody’s like, “Houston, Houston!” I wouldn’t have been mad, but I was so happy to go to Detroit.”Reportedly, Cade Cunningham has led the Detroit Pistons to one of their best records 11-2 in the Eastern Conference.

His production remains at a superstar level, averaging 27.4 points, 3.7 rebounds, 3.7 assists, and 1.4 steals per game.He is also shooting an efficient 45.8% from the field and 38.1% from deep, proving he is still one of the league’s most dangerous offensive threats.The veteran guard has already recorded three 40-point performances this season, reinforcing his status as one of the NBA’s elite scorers. His off-ball movement, shooting gravity, and ability to manipulate defenses continue to define the Warriors’ offensive strategy.Golden State Warriors will enter the game without key contributors Jonathan Kuminga and De’Anthony Melton. Kuminga remains out with bilateral knee patellar tendonitis, while Melton continues recovering from left ACL surgery. Buddy Hield, dealing with an illness, is listed as probable. Despite the absences, the Golden State Warriors still expect strong support from the likes of Jimmy Butler, Moses Moody, and Brandin Podziemski.The Orlando Magic will be without Paolo Banchero, who is sidelined due to a left groin strain. Franz Wagner is available but will play with a protective face mask. Jalen Suggs is questionable with a sore right groin, while Moe Wagner remains out as he recovers from a left knee injury.","Stephen curry has been fully cleared to play after previously dealing with an illness that sidelined him for three games.

Dallas Cowboys pay heartfelt tribute to their teammate

More NFL coverage

When the news of Marshawn Kneeland’s sudden death reached the Dallas Cowboys, the locker room fell into a kind of silence teammates said they had never felt before. But the deepest heartbreak was carried by someone outside the team facility. In the days after the tragedy, it was revealed that his girlfriend, Catalina Mancera, is expecting their son. As she prepares for life as a mother without him, she has begun gathering every photo, message, and memory she can find, hoping one day her child will understand who his father was beyond the headlines.Mancera shared her thoughts publicly with a message that showed both her grief and her gratitude. She wrote on Facebook, “I just wanted to take a moment to say thank you for all the love, prayers, and messages that have been sent my way. Your support has meant more to me than I can put into words during such a painful time.” She went on to ask for help preserving his legacy, adding, “As I continue honoring Marshawn’s memory, I’m trying to gather as many photos and memories of him as possible. If you have any pictures of Marshawn, whether they’re recent, old, funny, or meaningful. I would truly appreciate it if you could share them with me. Every photo helps me hold onto a piece of him and the beautiful impact he had on all of us.”As Mancera grieves privately, the Cowboys have honored Kneeland publicly and emotionally. Before their Week 11 game against the Las Vegas Raiders, players wore helmet decals with his No. 94. In the pregame huddle, Dak Prescott reminded teammates why the night mattered, telling them, “Tonight’s about honoring a brother.” He also wore white wrist tape with “One Love,” a phrase Kneeland always used. Players and staff wore shirts with his face and the years “2001 to 2025. ” ESPN’s Lisa Salters also reported that a No. 94 jersey was hung inside the visiting locker room in Las Vegas. The Raiders showed support as well, coming onto the field in shirts that read “Call An Audible,” with the 988 crisis hotline printed on the back. Head coach Brian Schottenheimer made clear that the team intends to stand beside Kneeland’s family long term. “We want to make sure she’s taken care of and the baby is taken care of for the rest of their lives,” he said.Cowboys players will continue contributing to the Marshawn Kneeland Memorial Fund, hoping their actions, both on and off the field, reflect the love they had for their teammate.","Girlfriend catalina mancera is expecting their son.

Khamzat Chimaev sends message to Khabib Nurmagomedov after Islam Makhachev’s win

Khamzat Chimaev shared a warm message on Sunday after Islam Makhachev won the UFC welterweight title at UFC 322, which took place on Saturday in Las Vegas, Nevada. His post showed that he is ready to let go of past tension with Khabib Nurmagomedov and his team. This came just hours after Islam Makhachev dominated Jack Della Maddalena in the main event.Khamzat Chimaev and Khabib Nurmagomedov never had a long fight between them, but they did have a small clash in October 2022 at UFC 280 in Abu Dhabi, when Khamzat Chimaev and Abubakar Nurmagomedov got into a physical fight near the cage. Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov stepped in right after the event and asked both fighters to settle the matter, and the issue ended that week.After Islam Makhachev became a two-division champion at UFC 322, Khamzat Chimaev wrote on Instagram, “The Wolf and The Eagle are not always close, but when you need to protect the mountains, they will always protect them together.”Fans saw this as a sign that the past problem between the two sides is now fully over. This message came after Islam Makhachev tied Anderson Silva’s record with his 16th UFC win in a row, becoming the 11th fighter in UFC history to hold titles in two weight classes.Islam Makhachev has now won belts at lightweight and welterweight, joining a very small group of champions. Khamzat Chimaev, who is now the UFC middleweight champion, also has plans of his own.He won his first UFC title in August 2025 at UFC 319 in Las Vegas when he beat Dricus du Plessis. He sits at No.4 on the pound-for-pound list.Earlier this year, he said he would fight Islam Makhachev at 170 pounds if Islam Makhachev stayed in that division. He believes beating a two-division champion is the fastest way to reach the No.1 pound-for-pound spot.Arman Tsarukyan, who fought Islam Makhachev in April 2019 in Saint Petersburg, Russia, shared his view this week in an interview with Aslanbek Badaev.Arman Tsarukyan said, “I would choose Khamzat. He is bigger. He is stronger. When you face someone at 77 kilos, it feels different.”Also Read: Conor Benn Reveals The Scary Childhood Trauma From The School That Told Him He Carried Demons At Twelve Years Old He said he learned this during a friendly grappling session with Khamzat Chimaev in Thailand during the Hype Fighting event, where he felt how heavy the Chechen fighter is on the ground.Arman Tsarukyan added that moving up in weight could make Islam Makhachev tired faster because the extra weight may slow him down in long rounds.",Khamzat chimaev shared a warm message on instagram after islam makhachev won the ufc welterweight title at ufc 322.

Brian Schottenheimer tells the Dallas Cowboys they honored Marshawn Kneeland in a moment the locker room will remember for a long time

Dak Prescott, Ryan Flournoy, and Cowboys players explain how they turned Marshawn Kneeland’s death into a unifying moment that shaped the win

Brian Schottenheimer stood in the middle of the Dallas Cowboys locker room after a 33-16 win over the Las Vegas Raiders and tried to talk. The focus keyword, Brian Schottenheimer, was fighting through his words. His voice kept catching. His eyes were glassy. The room felt heavier than any postgame moment the Cowboys have had this season.This was their first game since Marshawn Kneeland died on Nov. 6. The scoreboard said football. The locker room said something different. It said loss. It said grief. It said the kind of silence you only hear when everyone in the room is holding their breath at the same time.Then Brian Schottenheimer finally got it out. “You guys made him f**ing proud, man.” Players froze. Some looked down. Some looked right at him. Nobody moved.The Cowboys posted the video themselves after the win. It was not a polished speech. It was not rehearsed. Brian Schottenheimer looked like a person who had been carrying the entire building’s sadness for two weeks and finally let some of it slip out.The first-year head coach wore a shirt with Marshawn Kneeland’s face printed across the front.When he talked about putting it on, he did not hide how difficult that was.“I’d be lying if I said I didn’t have some tears when I first put this shirt on, as you can imagine,” he said. “But more than anything, I know Marshawn was looking down on us, and we wanted to make him proud. And I think we did that.”The Cowboys set up a full locker for Marshawn Kneeland before kickoff. His No. 94 jersey hung on the hooks. His cleats sat on the floor. Ryan Flournoy held the jersey during the closing seconds on the sideline. No theatrics. Just grief in motion. Dak Prescott stepped in with the kind of clarity you only get from someone who has lived through his own loss.“It’s about being vulnerable,” Prescott said. “To show courage, you have to show some kind of weakness, or something that you need to overcome. It was just a time for us to gather together, understand this game is bigger.”Every detail of the night pointed back to one thing. The Cowboys were hurting. The Cowboys were remembering. The Cowboys were trying to turn pain into something that could carry them forward.Dallas spent the week in grief counseling. They held a candlelight vigil. They took a team dealing with a losing record and layered it with something far heavier.Dak Prescott did not pretend to be okay. He did not act like this was “just football.”“It was a blessing to be out here, this is where the healing happens for me,” Prescott said. “We love Marshawn, we’re going to continue to shine a light for him and we’re blessed to continue his light for him.”Ryan Flournoy went the same direction. “He was our teammate, our brother. Just keep going, keep playing,” Flournoy said. “Just knowing he’s here with us. He’s gone, but he’s not gone. He’s still with us.”And the Cowboys played like a group holding onto something bigger than a Week 11 matchup. Prescott threw four touchdowns. The Dallas defense held the Raiders to one touchdown and 236 total yards. They ended the game with a safety. It was the most complete performance Dallas has had all year.Brian Schottenheimer closed his speech the same way he opened it. Honest. Shaken. Direct. “So proud of you guys. Enjoy it. Shower up. Let’s get on that plane.”Nothing dramatic. Nothing performative. Just a coach trying to hold his team together on a night that carried more weight than the win-loss column will ever show.The Cowboys will wear the tribute shirts again next week when they face the Philadelphia Eagles at AT&T Stadium. The grief does not disappear. The unity they showed on Monday night will follow them into that building.Marshawn Kneeland is gone. But the Cowboys made sure his presence stayed in the room.They played for him. Brian Schottenheimer said it out loud, through tears, with a shaking voice that the entire country heard.","Brian schottenheimer tells the cowboys they made marshawn kneeland proud after an emotional win. “you guys made him f**ing proud, man,” he said.

The gaming industry mourns the loss of Rebecca Ann Heineman, who passed away on November 17, 2025, at age 62 after a brief but aggressive battle with adenocarcinoma. She was a pioneering game developer, programmer, and the co-founder of Interplay.The news about her passing was shared by Heineman's friend, Heidi McDonald, who stated this: ""My trailblazing game industry bad-ass friend Rebecca Heineman has passed away. F**k cancer."" This is a deeply sad moment in the gaming industry, given Rebecca Heineman’s significant contributions over the years.Rebecca Heineman was born in 1963 and initially made a mark on the industry by winning a national Space Invaders tournament in 1980.

His post on X read the following:“Rebecca Heineman sadly passed away. Known her since the 80s when I'd drive her to work, one of the most brilliant programmers around. A real gut punch earlier today when she messaged me: ""We have gone on so many adventures together! But, into the great unknown! I go first!!!"":(""LGBTQ+ Trailblazer and AdvocateIn addition to her gaming contributions, Heineman was an influential figure in LGBTQ gaming history.

A surprising Geno Smith twist quietly shadows Travis Kelce’s lost QB dream

Raiders quarterback Geno Smith had a profound effect on Kansas Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce years before their NFL careers started. Now, recently. QB Geno Smith of Las Vegas was forced to apologies to Travis Kelce for ruining his college quarterback hopes at the West Virginia Mountaineers after Jason Kelce confronted him on the pitch.The animosity between Kelce and Smith extends far beyond their AFC West division. Travis still remembers a moment from their high school years, even though it began long before the NFL. Additionally, Jason Kelce, an ESPN analyst and Travis' brother, disclosed on November 17 that Smith reportedly destroyed Travis' college quarterback tryout.Smith had a brief conversation with ESPN commentator Jason Kelce on the field prior to Monday night's game against the Cowboys. The two shared a humorous story about Smith 'ruining' the Chiefs tight end's college quarterback tryout.According to the discussion, Smith's domination that day unintentionally propelled his brother, an ESPN commentator, into tight end immortality, a favor far larger than any scholarship could have been. Jason said to Geno Smith:“Geno, I know you know this... So, you ruined Trav’s chances of ever playing quarterback for West Virginia by showing him up at that recruiting camp…He remembers you, I know that.”Smith swiftly followed it up with a three-word message for Travis, giving the impression that he was a little sorry about it:“My bad, Trav... It worked out.”Jason told Smith:""You ruined Trav's chances of ever playing quarterback for West Virginia by showing him up at that recruiting camp.. He remembers you, I know that. My bad, Trav. But hey, it worked out.""In 2022, when Smith was still a member of the Seahawks, Travis shared the heartbreaking story on a New Heights episode. The legend states that the two first met during a recruiting trip to West Virginia when they were both trying out for Rich Rodriguez's team as quarterbacks.When Smith was speaking with Jason and other reporters on the field prior to the Raiders' game against the Dallas Cowboys, he made it apparent that he was aware of the story. Later on, though, Jason also concurred that everyone benefited from it.Kelce had shared the story on his New Heights podcast in 2022. Travis on the podcast said:“I’ve seen Geno sling it around since we were in high school.. When we both went on a recruiting visit to West Virginia, and he was just dotting it. And the way the ball was coming out of his hand… I walked out of there empty-handed, and Geno Smith walked out of there with an offer. I just remember seeing him throw the ball, and I was just sitting on the sideline like, ‘Man, I ain’t got that.”Meanwhile, Travis didn't say about Geno and his recent comment.Also read: ""She was breaking"": Taylor Swift’s emotional confession about Travis Kelce sparks panic about her past with Joe Alwyn","Travis kelce and geno smith first met during a recruiting trip to west virginia when they were both trying out for rich rodriguez's team as quarterbacks.

Internal Changes and Offseason Losses

Dodgers’ Notable Departures

Theare approaching this offseason with caution after last year’s expensive gamble on Tanner Scott didn’t go as planned. The club invested $72 million in the left-handed reliever, only to watch him struggle to a 4.74 ERA while blowing 10 saves before losing his role to Roki Sasaki during the team’s World Series push. That experience has clearly shaped how the Dodgers are handling this winter’s free-agent market, especially when it comes to high-priced bullpen arms.With several contenders, including the New York Mets, Atlanta Braves, and Toronto Blue Jays, reportedly preparing for a $102 million bidding war over elite closer Edwin Díaz, Los Angeles appears reluctant to jump in. Instead, early indications suggest the Dodgers may pivot toward a more modest addition, focusing on Tampa Bay Rays right-hander Pete Fairbanks after Tampa Bay declined his 2026 team option.According to USA Today’s Jesse Yomtov, the organization may stay away from the expensive sweepstakes surrounding elite closer Edwin Díaz. Yomtov wrote, “With Scott on the books for three more years, the Los Angeles Dodgers may prefer to stay out of the Diaz sweepstakes, which is expected to end in a four- or five-year deal worth about $100 million.” His projection suggests that Los Angeles could target a more affordable arm instead.Scott finished 2025 with a 4.74 ERA in 61 regular-season games, blowing 10 saves before being replaced by Roki Sasaki for the Dodgers’ World Series run. Despite the rocky debut season, the team still believes the 31-year-old can rebound after posting dominant numbers in 2023 and 2024.Rather than chase the biggest names on the board, the Los Angeles Dodgers are expected to show interest in Tampa Bay Rays right-hander Pete Fairbanks, who became available after the Rays declined his 2026 team option. Fairbanks profiles as a lower-risk, potentially high-upside addition who can serve as insurance for Scott while deepening the bullpen without massive financial commitment.• Lower expected salary compared to Díaz• Proven late-inning experience• Flexibility to work in multiple relief roles• Helps stabilize the bullpen without forcing Scott out of the pictureLos Angeles Dodgers’ Recent Free-Agency ChallengesThe Tanner Scott signing is at the center of the Los Angeles Dodgers’ cautious strategy. The organization invested heavily, expecting him to anchor the ninth inning for years. Instead, Scott missed the entire postseason and struggled to consistently command his pitches.Despite the dip, the Dodgers are not ready to give up on him. With three years left on his contract, the front office remains confident he can return to form.The Dodgers’ bullpen isn’t the only area facing uncertainty. The team is also losing several players to free agency. Outfielder Michael Conforto is set to hit the market, and utility veteran Kiké Hernández could depart as well. On top of that, longtime franchise icon Clayton Kershaw officially retired after an 18-year career.• Michael Conforto• Kiké Hernández (potential departure)• Clayton Kershaw (retirement)Dodgers Still Hold a Strong Foundation for 2026Even with roster turnover and bullpen inconsistencies, Los Angeles remains one of the most complete teams in baseball. Between their star-studded lineup, deep rotation, and emerging younger talent, expectations remain high for another postseason appearance in 2026.Also read: MLB trade rumors: Boston Red Sox could pursue $185 million Cy Young to bolster rotation and improve title odds The front office’s decision to avoid a financial bidding war signals confidence in the roster they already have, along with a desire to avoid repeating costly mistakes. By looking toward more measured additions such as Pete Fairbanks, the Los Angeles Dodgers aim to strengthen their bullpen without mortgaging future flexibility.","The los angeles dodgers are expected to show interest in tampa bay rays right-hander pete fairbanks.

How Ryan Hartman’s absence impacts Minnesota Wild’s first-line strategy

Ryan Hartman Pulls Off Slick Spin-O-Rama And Roofs It Vs. Tampa Bay Lightning

The NHL injury update concerning the Minnesota Wild comes at a very critical time for a team that is trying to build up good momentum in the Western Conference. The season's intensity has intensified, and the Wild are now compelled to deal with unexpected lineup problems that might affect both the team's atmosphere and its flow. What at first appeared to be a rather straightforward series of games has rapidly turned into a challenge—the depth, timing, and adaptability of coach John Hynes and his staff are being tested.The worry shot up dramatically when it was announced that forward Ryan Hartman would miss the next week due to a lower-body injury. Hartman incurred the injury during the Sunday game against the Vegas Golden Knights, leaving the ice in the third period after showing he was in pain during his last shift with the other two stars, Kirill Kaprizov and Mats Zuccarello. His injury stopped a streak of 20 consecutive games that he had played this season, and during this period, he scored 4 goals and gave 3 assists.As per the information received from ESPN, the young and talented forward Danila Yurov is likely to assume the position of the center on the first line in the absence of Hartman. It is a big responsibility for the rising star, particularly with the Wild trying to gain the momentum from their last two wins.On the other hand, there is a slight hope that Vladimir Tarasenko may play, as he skated during Tuesday’s practice after being out for two games because of a lower-body injury. Though he is still questionable for the game against the Carolina Hurricanes on Wednesday, his early-season statistics—two goals and eight assists—make it a critical point to follow his status.With Hartman out and Tarasenko being a game-time decision, the Wild will now rely more on their depth and flexibility as they get ready for the Hurricanes. The way the team reacts in the next few games could determine the direction of their early season.Also Read: Colorado Avalanche locks in rising star Gavin Brindley with two-year contract extension",Minnesota wild forward ryan hartman will miss the next week due to a lower-body injury.

More coverage on Josh Allen and Buffalo Bills:

Hailee Steinfeld, the Buffalo Bills’ leading lady, has rebranded Thanksgiving as her personal ‘gratitude gathering.’ In her latest Beau Society newsletter, released just ten days before the holiday, she teased her festive plans with a simple headline: ‘Menu ideas! Cozy outfits! Cooking fails!’ Naturally, our curiosity was piqued by what the Sinners star would be wearing. In the ‘What I’m wearing…’ section, Steinfeld reminisced about last year’s brown Theory dress and emphasized her love for comfort. With the chill in the air and a fire crackling at home, she’s leaning toward a sweater this year. She’s torn between a classic cardigan and a freshly ordered brushed cashmere from Aritzia, hoping it arrives in time. For the bottom half, she’s choosing between laid-back casual pants or her go-to satin, flowy Zara trousers, the ones she loves to pair with loafers.To make it even easier for fans to channel her style, Hailee shared direct links to each outfit mentioned. The first top is a cardigan blooming with buttercup floral embroidery, sparkling with beads and sequins. Its fitted shape and classic crew neckline green light to vintage 1950s knits, complete with full-length, sleeveless lines, delicate mother-of-pearl buttons, and ribbed details at the collar, cuffs, and hem.The second top is a relaxed crew sweater in a dreamy Saville shade, crafted from 100% brushed cashmere for a cloud-like softness and warmth. Certified by The Good Cashmere Standard, it drapes beautifully thanks to its Jersey stitch, providing a smooth and gentle feel. For bottoms, option one is Donni’s sweater rib kick flare in charcoal gray, crafted from their signature ultra-soft ribbed fabric. It features a cropped cut, slim legs, and a whimsical kick flare at the hem. Option two is a pair of high-waisted, flowy brown pants from Zara, made from pure viscose yarn for a straight-leg silhouette and completed with a hidden side zip.With fashion sorted, Steinfeld turns her attention to a tentative Thanksgiving menu…","The buffalo bills’ leading lady has rebranded thanksgiving as her personal ‘gratitude gathering’ in her latest beau society newsletter, released just ten days before the holiday, she teased her festive plans with a simple headline: ‘menu ideas!
