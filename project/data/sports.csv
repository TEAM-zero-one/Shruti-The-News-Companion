KKR vs RCB Dream 11 Team Prediction

The stage is set for a blockbuster start to the 2025 Indian Premier League ( IPL ) as defending champions Kolkata Knight Riders ( KKR ) face Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) in the tournament opener at Eden Gardens on Saturday.Both teams embark on a new chapter under fresh leadership — Ajinkya Rahane takes charge of KKR, while Rajat Patidar leads RCB. The squads have also undergone significant overhauls following last year’s mega auction in Jeddah, giving both sides a refreshed look.KKR will aim to kick off their title defence on a winning note, while Patidar’s RCB will be determined to turn the page on past disappointments. Adding to the excitement, Eden Gardens will witness Virat Kohli’s much-anticipated return to T20 cricket, his first appearance in the format since retiring after India’s T20 World Cup triumph last year. The home crowd will surely relish watching the Indian icon back in action.The Eden Gardens pitch is renowned for being a batter-friendly surface, especially in the IPL. It usually offers a flat track with consistent bounce, allowing batters to play their shots with confidence. However, compared to the even flatter pitches seen last season in venues like Bengaluru and Hyderabad, Eden Gardens offers a touch more assistance for bowlers, adding a bit of balance to the contest.KKR: Venkatesh Iyer will be the one to watch from a Kolkata Knight Riders standpoint as the biggest buy for the franchise at the mega auction. Another to watch is Varun Chakravarthy having made a mark at the Champions Trophy and secondly for his ability to halt Virat Kohli over the years. It would be interesting if he can do the same todayRCB: Virat Kohli will play his 400th T20 when he takes the field for RCB this season. He is already the leading scorer in IPL history and could achieve the milestone of scoring 1000 runs against four different franchises.KKR squad: Ajinkya Rahane (captain), Venkatesh Iyer (vice-captain), Quinton de Kock (wk), Rovman Powell (wk), Rahmanullah Gurbaz (wk), Luvnith Sisodia (wk), Manish Pandey, Angkrish Raghuvanshi, Ramandeep Singh, Rinku Singh, Moeen Ali, Sunil Narine, Andre Russell, Anukul Roy, Vaibhav Arora, Spencer Johnson, Mayank Markande, Anrich Nortje, Umran Malik, Varun Chakravarthy.RCB squad: Rajat Patidar (c), Virat Kohli, Yash Dayal, Josh Hazlewood, Phil Salt, Jitesh Sharma, Liam Livingstone, Rasikh Dar, Suyash Sharma, Krunal Pandya, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Swapnil Singh, Tim David, Romario Shepherd, Nuwan Thushara, Manoj Bhandage, Jacob Bethel, Devdutt Padikkal, Swastik Chhikara, Lungi Ngidi, Abhinandan Singh, Mohit Rathee.Both teams have played each 34 times in the IPL, with KKR holding an edge with 20 wins. The last five games have gone in KKR's favour as they won on four occasions. RCB's last win against KKR came in IPL 2022.RCB Predicted XI: Phil Salt (wk), Virat Kohli, Rajat Patidar (c), Liam Livingstone, Jacob Bethell/Tim David, Krunal Pandya, Swapnil Singh, Josh Hazlewood, Yash Dayal, Suyash Sharma, Bhuvneshwar KumarKKR Predicted XI: Sunil Narine, Quinton de Kock (wk), Ajinkya Rahane (C), Venkatesh Iyer, Rinku Singh, Andre Russell, Ramandeep Singh, Harshit Rana, Spencer Johnson/Anrich Nortje, Varun Chakravarthy, Vaibhav Arora","Defending champions kolkata knight riders face royal challengers bengaluru (rcb) in the tournament opener at eden gardens on saturday.

NEW DELHI: Ramesh Shanmugam, a 30-year-old para-athlete and a MS Dhoni fan from the remote village of Mannathampatty in Tiruchirappalli district, Tamil Nadu, has achieved remarkable success in wheelchair racing .Despite facing numerous hardships, including losing both his legs in a lorry accident at the age of eight, Shanmugam has persevered and emerged as a national record holder in the Men's 800m T53/T54 event.Shanmugam's journey has been inspired by his admiration for former Indian cricket captain and an integral member of Chennai Super Kings IPL 2025 side -- Dhoni, whom he idolises for his calm, composed, and disciplined demeanour.""Once MS Dhoni retires, I will stop watching cricket,"" he said, as quoted from a release by SAI Media.Drawing parallels from Dhoni's approach, Shanmugam has applied similar principles to his athletic career, steadily rising through the ranks of wheelchair racing in India.""I used to play cricket back in the day. I used to run fast and also was a wicketkeeper. I have been to several cricket matches as I really enjoy watching the sport, especially our thala MS Dhoni,"" he said.This year, Shanmugam's achievements have been noteworthy, with two gold medals and a silver medal at the World Para Athletics Grand Prix, followed by two more gold medals in the Men's 800m T53/T54 and Men's 100m T53/T54 events at the Khelo India Para Games 2025.""I feel I am on the right track in my career now.

Former heavyweight boxing champion George Foreman passed away at age 76 on Friday, as announced by his family.Foreman's family shared the news through a statement on his official Instagram page, confirming his peaceful departure on March 21, 2025, while surrounded by his loved ones.""With profound sorrow, we announce the passing of our beloved George Edward Foreman Sr, who peacefully departed on March 21, 2025, surrounded by loved ones. We are grateful for the outpouring of love and prayers, and kindly ask for privacy as we honour the extraordinary life of a man we were blessed to call our own.""Foreman was born in Texas on January 10, 1949, and grew up in Houston with J.D. Foreman, who was often absent and struggled with alcohol. He later discovered that J.D. was not his biological father when his real father, a decorated World War II veteran, contacted him after his heavyweight title victory.His teenage years were marked by trouble, leading him to drop out of school at 16.""At 13-years-old, George was about 6-foot-2, 200 pounds and the terrorist in the neighbourhood. And when you're bigger and stronger and think you're better than everyone else, you take things,"" his younger brother Roy told the BBC in 2024.He began boxing at age 16, which would change the course of his life.""I wanted to a football player. I tried boxing just to show my friends that I wasn't afraid. Well, 25 fights and one year later, I was an Olympic gold medallist.""At the 1968 Mexico Olympics, 19-year-old Foreman won the super-heavyweight gold medal. He celebrated by waving an American flag in the ring, just days after fellow African Americans Tommie Smith and John Carlos made their black power salute.Standing at 6-foot-4, Foreman dominated the heavyweight division with his size and strength. He earned a title shot against Joe Frazier and won convincingly in two rounds.By the time he faced Muhammad Ali in the famous "" Rumble in the Jungle "" in October 1974, Foreman had an undefeated record of 40 fights. He lost to Ali in eight rounds, largely due to Ali's ""rope-a-dope"" strategy.""I just couldn't believe I'd lost the world title. It was the most embarrassing moment of my life. It went from pride to pity. That's devastating.""After losing to Jimmy Young in Puerto Rico in March 1977, Foreman experienced a religious awakening and retired at age 28 to become an ordained minister.He returned to boxing ten years later, fighting 21 times and winning all bouts, with 20 knockouts. He secured title shots against Evander Holyfield in 1991 and Tommy Morrison in 1993, losing both on points.In November 1994, wearing the same shorts from his Ali fight, Foreman knocked out Michael Moorer in the 10th round to become the oldest heavyweight world champion at 45 years and 299 days.He later lost his WBA and IBF titles for refusing mandatory defences. His final fight was a points loss to Shannon Briggs in 1997 at age 48.Foreman's professional record stood at 76 wins from 81 fights, with 68 victories by knockout.After boxing, he found success with the ""George Foreman Lean Mean Fat-Reducing Grilling Machine"" and hosted a TV show called ""Bad Dads"" in 1996.His personal life included four marriages and twelve children, with ten biological and two adopted. He named all five of his sons George Edward.""If one of us goes up, then we all go up together, and if one goes down, we all go down together!""","Former heavyweight boxing champion george foreman passed away at age 76 on friday.

Meredith Gaudreau on the beauty of ordinary moments

Meredith Gaudreau shares special Johnny Hockey stories with Julie & Cat | Episode 9

Johnny Gaudreau was known for many things—his incredible skill on the ice, his warm personality, and his deep devotion as a husband and father. Even now, seven months after his passing, his passion and spirit remain alive in the hearts of those who loved him, especially his wife, Meredith Gaudreau . A glimpse at their social media pages shows just how much energy and joy he brought into every moment.Johnny Gaudreau and Meredith Gaudreau were together for years, sharing countless milestones—getting engaged, getting married, welcoming their two children—all alongside the excitement of his hockey career. But in a recent appearance on the Never Offside with Julie & Cat podcast, Meredith reflected not just on those big moments but also on the simple, everyday memories that made their time together so special.“I mean, this is like so weird. I love watching Deal or No Deal. I love it; it’s like my favorite show in the world. I don’t know why.I think I mean I don’t want to like end on a dark note, but I was like I was having a hard time watching like all the new stuff without John ’cause like that was our thing, and then but we watched Deal or No Deal all the time. I don’t know why, like, we have like this weird streaming television, and there’s, like, a Deal or No Deal channel, and I just watch it, and I’m, like, mesmerized by it. Like, I can’t get enough of it. It is so weird, but I have to be honest; that’s what I’m watching.”Johnny Gaudreau had no way of knowing just how much his decision to move would mean for his wife and children. He made the choice on his own, wanting to relocate the family closer to other players’ families so that his wife, Meredith, would have a strong support system during the long stretches when he was away for NHL games.Talking about this decision, Meredith Gaudreau said, “We’re like this weird team that we all live in one neighborhood like it’s just boom boom boom, like teammate after teammate, and I’m so thankful for that now, obviously, but we have such a good group.”Also Read: ""The compete was not there”: Former NHL coach blasts New York Rangers’ playoff chances, calls out team for horrific performance Meredith Gaudreau shared how Boone Jenner has become ""Uncle Boone"" to her kids, even dressing as Donald Duck for baby Johnny’s first birthday.

Sunrisers Hyderabad:

Rajasthan Royals:

NEW DELHI: Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) will start as favourites against Rajasthan Royals (RR) in their opening Indian Premier League (IPL) match at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium on Sunday. Armed with a balanced squad featuring powerful hitters like Travis Head, Abhishek Sharma, Ishan Kishan and Heinrich Klaasen, SRH are well-equipped to post a massive total on the batting-friendly track. The return of all-rounder Nitish Kumar Reddy after injury adds more depth to their lineup.Abhishek Sharma’s recent form is a significant boost, as he smashed 135 off just 54 balls against England in his last T20I appearance. With such explosive capabilities, SRH could potentially set the much-anticipated 300-run record if they bat first. Last season, they breached the 250-run mark thrice, including 287 against Royal Challengers Bangalore and 277 versus Mumbai Indians.Captain Pat Cummins and Mohammed Shami lead SRH’s experienced pace attack, supported by spinner Adam Zampa. In contrast, Rajasthan Royals look underwhelming, especially without their captain Sanju Samson, who is nursing a finger injury. Riyan Parag will lead in Samson’s absence, but the Royals’ bowling lacks depth beyond Jofra Archer.SRH dominated both encounters with RR last season, winning narrowly in the league stage and comfortably in Qualifier 2. With momentum and firepower on their side, SRH appear poised to continue their dominance.The match between Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) and Rajasthan Royals (RR) will take place at Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium, Hyderabad.The highly anticipated clash is scheduled for Sunday, March 23.The match will begin at 3:30 PM IST, with the toss at 3:00 PM IST.The match will be broadcast live on the JioStar Network.Fans in India can stream the match live on the JioHotstar app.Pat Cummins (c), Travis Head, Ishan Kishan, Heinrich Klaasen, Abhishek Sharma, Sachin Baby, Mohammed Shami, Adam Zampa, Aniket Verma, Abhinav Manohar, Rahul Chahar, Eshan Malinga, Harshal Patel, Kamindu Mendis, Wiaan Mulder, Nitish Kumar Reddy, Atharva Taide, Brydon Carse, Simarjeet Singh, Jaydev Unadkat, Zeeshan Ansari.Riyan Parag (c), Sanju Samson, Shubham Dubey, Shimron Hetmyer, Yashasvi Jaiswal, Dhruv Jurel, Nitish Rana, Kunal Singh Rathore, Vaibhav Suryavanshi, Wanindu Hasaranga, Jofra Archer, Ashok Sharma, Tushar Deshpande, Fazalhaq Farooqi, Kumar Kartikeya, Akash Madhwal, Kwena Maphaka, Sandeep Sharma, Maheesh Theekshana, Yudhvir Singh.","Sunrisers hyderabad (srh) will start as favourites against rajasthan royals (rr) in their opening indian premier league (ipl) match at the rajiv gandhi international stadium, hyderabad.

NEW DELHI: Sunrisers Hyderabad will open their IPL 2025 campaign against Rajasthan Royals with confidence, having built a squad that blends explosive batting with experienced bowling options. Runners-up last season, SRH will be aiming to start strong at home on what’s expected to be a flat, high-scoring track at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium .With Travis Head, Abhishek Sharma, Ishan Kishan, and Heinrich Klaasen in the top order, the hosts are capable of posting record-breaking totals. Abhishek, fresh off a 135-run blitz in a recent T20I, is expected to continue his fine form, while the return of all-rounder Nitish Kumar Reddy strengthens the middle.The bowling attack, led by skipper Pat Cummins, includes the seasoned Mohammed Shami, spin ace Adam Zampa, and death-overs specialist Harshal Patel — making this a formidable unit across all phases.On the other side, Rajasthan Royals are hampered by the unavailability of captain Sanju Samson as a fielder or keeper due to a finger injury. He’s expected to bat as an Impact Player, with Riyan Parag leading the side.Without Jos Buttler, RR’s batting leans heavily on Yashasvi Jaiswal and Shimron Hetmyer. Their bowling attack, led by Jofra Archer and Wanindu Hasaranga, has the potential but lacks depth on paper compared to SRH.Having dominated the Royals last season — including a crucial win in Qualifier 2 — Sunrisers will be looking to extend their supremacy in what promises to be a high-octane afternoon clash.READ ALSO: SRH vs RR Preview, IPL 2025: Formidable Sunrisers Hyderabad face Rajasthan Royals in Hyderabad","Sunrisers hyderabad will open their ipl 2025 campaign against rajasthan royals.

Chennai Super Kings:

Mumbai Indians:

NEW DELHI: Chennai Super Kings (CSK) will rely on their formidable spin attack and favourable Chepauk conditions as they take on Mumbai Indians (MI) in their IPL opener on Sunday. The five-time champions have strengthened their spin arsenal with the additions of Ravichandran Ashwin, Noor Ahmad, Shreyas Gopal and Deepak Hooda, complementing the experience of Ravindra Jadeja. This spin-heavy strategy is well-suited for the spin-friendly Chepauk pitch and could prove decisive against MI.All eyes will be on MS Dhoni as he continues his long-standing association with CSK since the tournament's inception. The team also faces a selection dilemma for the opening slot, with Rachin Ravindra and Devon Conway vying to partner skipper Ruturaj Gaikwad. The middle order is bolstered by Rahul Tripathi, Shivam Dube, Vijay Shankar and Dhoni himself.Mumbai Indians, on the other hand, are dealing with significant absences, including Jasprit Bumrah, who remains out with a back injury, and regular skipper Hardik Pandya, serving a one-match ban.

NEW DELHI: Chennai Super Kings will look to make the most of home conditions and a spin-heavy attack when they open their IPL 2025 campaign against traditional rivals Mumbai Indians at the MA Chidambaram Stadium on Sunday.With recent dominance over MI -- having won four of their last five encounters -- CSK start with the psychological edge.The five-time champions made their intentions clear at the auction by bolstering their spin unit, adding Ravichandran Ashwin, Noor Ahmad and Shreyas Gopal to a squad that already features Ravindra Jadeja and Deepak Hooda.With Chepauk likely to offer turn and grip, expect CSK to build their strategy around spin strangulation.Captain Ruturaj Gaikwad could come at number three, with Devon Conway opening the innings alongside Rachin Ravindra. The middle order looks settled with Rahul Tripathi, Shivam Dube, and Sam Curran, followed by the evergreen MS Dhoni, Ravindra Jadeja and Ravichandran Ashwin providing depth.Mumbai Indians, meanwhile, face early hurdles.Jasprit Bumrah remains unavailable as he continues his recovery, and regular captain Hardik Pandya is suspended for one match due to a slow over-rate offence last season. In his absence, India T20I captain Suryakumar Yadav will lead the side.Ryan Rickelton is expected to fill the void left by Ishan Kishan at the top, partnering Rohit Sharma, with Tilak Varma and Will Jacks adding firepower in the middle. MI’s spin options, including Mitchell Santner and Karn Sharma, could play a key role in countering CSK’s batting.ALSO READ: CSK vs MI Live Streaming: How to Watch Chennai Super Kings vs Mumbai Indians in IPL 2025 Online The match also offers a first look at the new ball-change rule in the second innings, making Sunday’s clash a high-stakes tactical battle under lights.","Chennai super kings open their ipl 2025 campaign against mumbai indians.

Carlos Rodon shines in final Spring Training appearance

Tokyo series opener sets viewership records in Japan

Seattle Mariners introduce blackout-free streaming service

Spring training highlights: Athletics dominate Royals

With Major League Baseball (MLB) on deck for the 2025 season, this week has been doozy — from outstanding spring training performances to flood-inducing broadcasting milestones. So with that in mind, here’s a full rundown of the biggest MLB news and stories from this week.Carlos Rodon closed out his Spring Training on a high note for the New York Yankees, putting together an impressive outing against the Detroit Tigers. Carlos Rodon threw 4 2/3 scoreless innings and 77 pitches in a 4-0 win. After a quiet preseason consisting of three Grapefruit League starts and some live batting practices, Rodón was confident he was ready for the Opening Day assignment against the Milwaukee Brewers at Yankee Stadium.The Yankees’ rotation has struggled, most significantly after Gerrit Cole underwent Tommy John surgery, and other top pitchers have been injured. Rodon's polished repertoire of pitches, highlighted by an elite changeup and two-seam fastball, is the key to team success this season.The inaugural game of the Tokyo Series between the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Chicago Cubs fans captivated in-game audiences in Japan, too, averaging more than 25 million viewers. This was a record for an MLB game in Japan, beating all the previous records. It beats the previous year's Seoul Series viewership record of 18.7 million viewers.On Opening Day there was even a historic all-Japanese pitching matchup, with the Dodgers’ Yoshinobu Yamamoto squaring off against the Cubs’ Shota Imanaga. The Dodgers won that game, 4-1. The next game, featuring a home run from Shohei Ohtani of the Los Angeles Angels and the debut of Roki Sasaki with the Los Angeles Dodgers, drew more than 23 million viewers in Japan.The games had an average of 590,000 viewers in the United States. Merchandise sales for the series climbed with a 320% increase since the previous year’s London games, and Ohtani’s Dodgers jersey topped the sales list.In a groundbreaking move, the Seattle Mariners, together with Root Sports, introduced a new in-market, blackout-free streaming service for just $19.99 a month. This service makes it possible for Mariners fans to watch Mariners games — without subscribing to a traditional cable or satellite TV.Available through a Root Sports streaming app, the service can be accessed on web browsers, smart TVs, and mobile devices, and apps are available on platforms including iOS, Android, Apple TV, and Amazon Fire TV, with plans to launch on Roku soon.The initiative is baseball further evolving its approach to broadcasting, part of the league's slow march towards other teams providing direct-to-streaming as the cable model continues to decline. It’s a cheaper option for fans than the cable packages that once cost a fortune.The Oakland Athletics dominated their spring training opponents, the Kansas City Royals, in a 10-1 blowout win. Jacob Wilson, a rookie, had three hits, and the pitcher Luis Severino went 5 1/3 innings, giving up one run.The lineup continued its offensive assault today with home runs by Brent Rooker and JJ Bleday. In other significant performances, Atlanta Braves’ Chris Sale struck out five in four scoreless innings in a 7-3 victory over the Tampa Bay Rays. Jeremy Peña's three-hit game, which included a home run, lifted the Houston Astros past the St. Louis Cardinals, 5-3.As the 2025 MLB season approaches, teams and fans alike are abuzz with anticipation and are excited for the season to start. The past week's events—from stellar individual performances to significant broadcasting innovations—set the stage for an exciting year in baseball.Also Read: ""It's different"": Dodgers 2B Tommy Edman reflects on Dodgers presence as team sweeps Tokyo Series games against Cubs","Mlb news and updates: carlos rodón shines, tokyo series sets records, mariners launch blackout-free streaming & more.

Who is Jake Paul’s fiancée Jutta Leerdam?

What’s next for Jake Paul?

Jake Paul is officially off the market. The 27-year-old boxer and social media star just put a ring on it, proposing to his girlfriend, Olympic speed skater Jutta Leerdam, in a moment straight out of a movie. The internet is eating it up. Paul and Leerdam, who have been inseparable since going public with their relationship in March 2023, shared the big news on Saturday morning with a post that had fans buzzing.Paul popped the question in front of a breathtaking island view, with the balcony decorated with white petals, flowers, and candles. The couple’s joint post featured Paul down on one knee, a close-up of Leerdam’s dazzling engagement ring, and a celebratory moment as they tossed petals into the air. “We’re engaged,” they wrote. “We can’t wait to spend forever together.”While Jake Paul ’s career has taken him from YouTube to the boxing ring, Leerdam has been making her own waves in the sports world. Jutta Leerdam isn’t just Jake Paul’s fiancée—she’s a straight-up powerhouse in her own right. The 25-year-old Dutch speed skater has racked up seven world titles, dominating the ice every time she steps on it. Back in 2023, she grabbed gold at the World Single Distances Championships in Heerenveen, a huge moment in her career. And just recently, she helped lead the Netherlands to victory again, snagging gold in the women’s team sprint at the 2025 World Championships in Hamar, Norway.Paul has been Leerdam’s biggest cheerleader, flying to Norway to support her latest victory. He took to Instagram to praise his fiancée, writing, “So proud of my baby 1st, 2nd, and 3rd this weekend at the world championships. She’s a 7-time world champion now. The hardest worker and the most gorgeous.”Paul also took a moment to reflect on how dominant athletes often face criticism. “Isn’t it ironic how the person who is the most important athlete to a sport is the one that they try to tear down the most?” he added. “Can’t relate because we don’t fly at y’all’s altitude. I hope love runs the universe one day.”Jake Paul’s engagement comes on the heels of one of the biggest fights of his career—a wild showdown with Mike Tyson that ended in a unanimous decision win. The Netflix event had the world watching, and now, Paul is already gearing up for his next fight. Rumors are flying about a potential clash with former UFC champ Conor McGregor, but nothing’s set in stone yet.Also Read: Leon Edwards’ 8-Second UFC Knockout: One of the Fastest Finishes in History Right now, though, the only thing on Paul’s mind seems to be celebrating with Leerdam.

KOLKATA: More than the re-introduction of saliva use on cricket balls, IPL players and coaches here on Friday welcomed the decision to use two new balls , one of them in the second innings of an evening game after the 11th over, to negate the dew factor.India’s new spin sensation Varun Chakravarthy said, “I’m looking forward to the ball-change issue more than the saliva part. Changing the ball might help the spinners. Mostly it is the spinners who bowl the 11th, 12th or 13th overs. It will help them get more control over their deliveries, especially with a drier ball (because of dew). That should help their trade.”RCB coach Andy Flower also welcomed the introduction of two new balls.“We’re always looking for a fair balance between bat and ball. In conditions where dew does affect games significantly, that’s a really good rule change. It’s about time,” he said, adding: “I’ve always wondered why there was this reticence on the umpire’s part to change the ball and make it an even and fair contest. You definitely see bat swings becoming a little more baseball-like now. I hope that some of the rule changes will balance out a little more bowling effectiveness as well, so that we can keep that balance in the game.”Also on Friday, New Zealand batting star Kane Williamson said in an interaction that he was sceptical about using saliva to bring any noticeable changes to the white ball, but hoped that it would give some breathing space to bowlers.“Over my time in white-ball cricket, it’s always been quite tough to shine the white ball. Whether it (saliva ban removal) has a large impact or not, we’ll find out soon.“I suppose any sort of help in shining might add some benefit. If it does swing, it really does bring the bowlers into the game a lot more.”","Ipl players and coaches welcomed the decision to use two new balls.

Miami: Carlos Alcaraz , ranked world number three, experienced an unexpected early elimination from the Miami Open on Friday. Belgian veteran David Goffin secured a remarkable comeback victory with a score of 5-7, 6-4, 6-3 at Hard Rock Stadium .Goffin, aged 34 and currently ranked 55th, had previously defeated Alcaraz in Astana three years ago. Noticing Alcaraz's subpar performance in the opening set, Goffin adopted an aggressive approach.Goffin, who once achieved a career-high ranking of No.7 in 2017, delivered impressive winning shots while Alcaraz struggled with unforced errors. The Belgian player managed to secure a break advantage in all three sets, and despite losing his lead in the first set, he maintained composure to secure the victory.""When I came out earlier... just to warm up on the court, I felt 'I'm moving well. I'm feeling quite relaxed. I'm hitting the ball really well' and so I hoped it would be the same during the match.""""I started the match well.

Meanwhile, Novak Djokovic secured a straight-sets victory over Australian Rinky Hijikata.Medvedev, who won the Miami title in 2023, displayed frustration by throwing his racket multiple times. Munar, the 27-year-old from Mallorca, achieved his third career victory over a top 10 opponent.The Russian player committed 32 unforced errors and failed to convert two break points in the final game despite having an opportunity to mount a comeback.""Yeah, I was not 100% physically, but I tried my best to get into the match. Every day was better and better. I had some problems after Indian Wells. Can happen.""""He played well, so that's why (he won) I wouldn't go to the match if I would kind of definitely know I'm not ready to win.""Djokovic, who previously lost to a lucky loser at Indian Wells, defeated 86th-ranked Hijikata 6-0, 7-6 (7/1), ending his three-match losing streak. He has now matched Rafael Nadal's record of 410 match wins in Masters 1000 tournaments since their inception in 1990.Karen Khachanov halted Nick Kyrgios's comeback with a 7-6 (7/3), 6-0 victory. Kyrgios, returning from wrist surgery, had secured his first tour-level win since October 2022 against Mackenzie McDonald but couldn't overcome Khachanov, a semi-finalist in Miami last year.In the women's competition, world number two Iga Swiatek advanced to the third round by defeating France's Caroline Garcia 6-2, 7-5. The match proved more challenging than their recent encounter at Indian Wells.Swiatek faced a 3-1 deficit in the second set and saved a set point while serving at 5-4 down before winning the final three games.""My energy level got down really fast.

Lewis Hamilton responds to critics in style with a thrilling Ferrari victory in China Sprint race



F1 Sprint Highlights | 2025 Chinese Grand Prix

Lewis Hamilton delivered a resounding response to his critics with an emphatic Sprint race victory at the Formula 1 Chinese Grand Prix . Leading from pole position, the Ferrari driver showcased his experience and racecraft by fending off Red Bull’s Max Verstappen before comfortably securing a near-seven-second lead over McLaren’s Oscar Piastri. The triumph marked a significant moment for Hamilton, who had faced scrutiny following a challenging debut with Ferrari in Australia.Speaking to Jacques Villeneuve in Parc Fermé, Hamilton acknowledged the difficulties of transitioning to a new team while addressing the wave of criticism that followed his performance in Melbourne.“I woke up feeling great today,” the first-time Ferrari winner said.“You know, the weather is beautiful here in Shanghai, we have this amazing crowd.“But yeah, the first race was difficult. I really do feel a lot of people underestimated the steep climb it is to get into a new team, to become acclimatised within a team, understanding and communication, all sorts of things.“And the amount of critics and people I’ve heard yapping along the way, just clearly not understanding maybe because they never had the experience or are just unaware.”“The first race was difficult. I really do feel a lot of people underestimated the steep climb it is to get into a new team, to become acclimatised within a team, understanding and communication, all sorts of things,” he said. His words served as a reminder of the complexities involved in adjusting to a new racing environment, even for a seven-time world champion.The stark contrast between Hamilton’s discomfort in Australia and his confidence in Shanghai was evident. Expressing his relief at a much-improved race weekend, he stated, “It’s felt great to come here and feel more comfortable in the car, because in Melbourne, I really didn’t feel comfortable in the car.” The engineering team’s efforts in fine-tuning the Ferrari played a crucial role in his dominant performance, allowing him to fully unlock the car’s potential.Hamilton’s success in China reaffirmed his belief that time and patience are key to Ferrari’s long-term aspirations.
