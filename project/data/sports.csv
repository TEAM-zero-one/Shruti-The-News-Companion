India:

NEW DELHI: Shubman Gill 's composed 87 and crucial partnerships with Shreyas Iyer (59) and Axar Patel (52) guided India to a four-wicket victory over England in the first ODI at Pune. Debutant Harshit Rana (3/53) and Ravindra Jadeja (3/26) shared six wickets to restrict England to 248.After a blistering start by England's openers, Rana's fourth over turned the tide, dismissing Ben Duckett and Harry Brook in quick succession. Jos Buttler (52) and Jack Bethell (51) scored fifties, but England struggled to rebuild after losing early wickets.Chasing a modest target, Gill anchored the innings, adapting to the match situation and forging vital partnerships. Iyer's counter-attacking knock, laced with sizzling shots, provided the initial impetus before Gill took charge after his dismissal.Axar's promotion up the order paid dividends as he supported Gill in the middle overs.Despite a late wobble, India overhauled the target with 68 balls to spare, thanks to Gill's composed knock and valuable contributions from Iyer and Axar.Earlier, England's openers Phil Salt (43) and Ben Duckett (32) got off to a flying start, but India's disciplined bowling and sharp fielding triggered a collapse. Rana's eventful debut saw him concede 26 runs in his first over before claiming two crucial wickets in his fourth over, turning the game on its head.Jadeja's triple strike and a stunning catch by debutant Yashasvi Jaiswal further dented England's progress, leaving them struggling to post a competitive total on a good batting surface.248 in 47.4 overs (Jos Buttler 52, Jacob Bethell 51; Harshit Rana 3/53, Ravindra Jadeja 3/26)251 for 6 in 38.4 overs (Shubman Gill 87, Shreyas Iyer 59 , Axar Patel 52; Adil Rashid 2/46).",India beat england by four wickets in the first odi at pune.

Indian captain Rohit Sharma addressed the team's preparations for the Champions Trophy following their victory in the first ODI against England in Nagpur. He emphasised their focus on maintaining consistent performance rather than pursuing specific goals.India secured a four-wicket win to take a 1-0 lead in the series. The team's performance was nearly flawless, despite losing three quick wickets near the end while chasing a modest target of 249 runs.""Nothing specific. Overall as a team, I just want us to keep making sure that we keep doing the right things as often as possible. There is nothing specific that we want to try and achieve,"" Rohit told the broadcaster after the match.""We want to try and tick every box that is there to be ticked in terms of bowling, batting and stuff like that. So (we) pretty much managed to do that today, although I felt we shouldn't have lost those wickets at the end.""""It would have been good, but again, guys are trying to put pressure back on the bowlers and while doing that things like this can happen,"" he said.Rohit expressed satisfaction with the team's performance, considering it was their first ODI in almost six months.""I'm pretty happy because we all knew that we're coming off from a long time playing this format so it was important for us to just regroup as quickly as possible and understand what is supposed to be done,"" he said.""This is a slightly longest format where you have time to come back into the game. When things start to go slightly away from you, it doesn't mean that it's going to keep going away.You have to try and pull things back and that is what exactly what we did. A lot of credit to all the bowlers there, everyone chipped in with that performance and it was important and necessary for us to keep that going,"" he said. Axar Patel 's performance was particularly noteworthy, scoring 52 runs off 47 balls after being promoted to number 5 in the batting order.""We want a lefty in the middle. We know there are a couple of (England) spinners who are going to bowl into the left-handers and we wanted a left-hander to be out there,"" he said.""Axar, over the years now we've seen how improved he is as a cricketer especially with his bat and we got to see that again today. We were slightly under pressure at that point we needed a partnership and Gill and Axar batted really well."" Shubman Gill , who contributed 87 runs to the victory, shared his approach to batting when India was struggling at 19/2.""(I was) just trying to be positive. There was a little bit in it for the fast bowlers with the new ball. So the thought process was not to get too much on the back foot (and) to have a good intent and play some good cricketing shots,"" he said.","India secured a four-wicket win to take a 1-0 lead in the series.

'Not taking anything for granted': Kagiso Rabada as MI Cape Town storm into first SA20 final

(

is the commissioner of SA20. He is a former South African cricketer and captain)

Cricket in South Africa has been a tale of our country’s unyielding spirit, and we have always been proud of the resilience, character and tenacity that has been a hallmark of our players. As someone who had the privilege of leading the Proteas during what many consider our ‘golden era,’ I have witnessed first-hand the highs and lows of this great game in our nation. The years following the retirements of legends like Jacques Kallis , AB de Villiers, and Dale Steyn, among others, ushered in a period of challenges that tested our collective cricketing calibre, both on and off the field.We struggled to fill the void, and the results showed it. Nevertheless, today, I stand proud to say that South African cricket isn’t just back—it’s thriving, it’s electrifying, and the energy is palpable. Moreover, I can proudly say that SA20 has played a key role in this resurgence.When I was offered the role of League Commissioner for the SA20, launched in January 2023, it was to be part of the mission with Cricket South Africa to reignite the spirit that South Africa is renowned for. Another objective was to create a platform for young talent to shine, and to bring the world’s attention back to our shores – all these piqued my interest. I knew right then, that this was exactly what South Africa needed to bring back its rich cricket heritage.Now, as the league approaches its 100th game, in Season 3, it is clear that this vision is slowly fructifying into a reality. The SA20, has not only unearthed gems, but has also played a major role in revitalizing our national teams across all formats.One of the most exciting aspects has been its ability to give young talent a platform to showcase their skills. . Players like Lhuan-dre Pretorius, Dewald Brevis, Tristan Stubbs, these players have become household names in South Africa thanks to their performances in the competition. But it’s not just the batters who have shone. The SA20 has also provided a platform for bowlers like Gerald Coetzee , Marco Jansen, Lutho Sipamla and 18-year-old Kwena Maphaka to showcase their skills on a global stage. Coetzee’s raw pace and Jansen’s all-round abilities have been key in South Africa’s recent successes, whereas young Kwena Maphaka has not only impressed in the SA20, but has even gone on to represent the Proteas on the international stage across all three formats.The SA20 has not only captured the imagination of South African fans, but has also been warmly received globally. In India, the league has found a massive audience, with fans tuning in to watch their favourite stars and emerging talents. Having Dinesh Karthik, the first Indian player to feature in the league, justifies that this league is second only to the IPL in terms of competition and quality highlights the remarkable progress made over the past three years. Adding to that, the presence of IPL franchises as owners of SA20 teams has further strengthened the connection between the two cricketing powerhouses.In UK and Australia, the league has been praised for its high-quality cricket and competitive spirit. The involvement of international stars and world-class players like Joe Root, Rashid Khan, Kane Williamson, among others, has added to the league’s appeal, making it truly a major cricket event in the sporting calendar.As we celebrate the milestone of 100 SA20 games, it’s impossible not to feel a sense of pride and optimism for the future. The league has not only brought back the buzz to South African cricket but has also laid the foundation for sustained success. The pipeline of talent is stronger than ever, and the lessons learned from the SA20 are being carried forward into international cricket. The journey hasn’t been easy, but the resilience and determination that define South African cricket have once again come to the fore.To the fans who have stood by us through thick and thin, to the players who have embraced the challenge, and to everyone who has contributed to this success —thank you. As we celebrate 100 games of the SA20, it is a moment to reflect on the journey we have had. Much like the vibrant colours of South Africa, the energy and passion of this league will always shine bright, uniting us in positivity and spirit for many more seasons to come. I could not be more excited to see where this journey takes us!",Graeme smith is the commissioner of the sa20 cricket league. The league is celebrating its 100th game this season. Smith says the league has brought back the buzz to south african cricket. It has also played a major role in revitalizing national teams across all formats.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117971698,imgsize-44338,width-400,resizemode-4/117971698.jpg"

'Nothing new': Rohit Sharma on his struggles ahead of England ODIs

NEW DELHI Cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar shared an amusing anecdote about former teammate Virender Sehwag during an event at Rashtrapati Bhavan . Tendulkar revealed that to bring out the best in Sehwag, he often had to say the opposite of what he actually wanted.Tendulkar graced the Rashtrapati Bhavan Vimarsh Shrinkhala event on Thursday, where esteemed personalities share their life experiences. He was a personal guest of President Droupadi Murmu and presented her with a signed Indian Test jersey. Accompanied by his wife Anjali and daughter Sara, Tendulkar spoke about the invaluable lessons sport teaches.""Sport treats everyone equally. You may be in good form while someone else isn’t, and vice versa. As a team, you must stick together through good and bad times, trusting your partner,"" he remarked.Tendulkar captivated the audience with anecdotes from his playing days, illustrating how understanding teammates was crucial.With Sehwag, he revealed an amusing strategy: ""Viru would always do the opposite of what I wanted. So, if I wanted him to defend, I’d tell him to go smash the bowlers. He’d then say, ‘No paaji, I should defend for four overs first,’ and I would smile, knowing I got what I wanted.""He also recalled a conversation with Yuvraj Singh before the 2011 World Cup , when the left-hander seemed low on energy.""Yuvi told me he wasn’t timing the ball well. I advised him to forget about batting and focus on fielding, setting small goals. I told him, ‘Yuvi, you will matter when it matters.’ That brought the spark back in his strides.""Tendulkar recounted a pivotal Test match against New Zealand when Chris Cairns was reversing the ball dangerously.""In some conditions, it’s tough to spot the shiny side. Cairns was beating us, and the match was critical. I told Rahul Dravid, ‘I’ll hold the bat in one hand — you gauge the swing.’ When Cairns bowled cross-seam, I adjusted accordingly. That trust helped us survive.""While Tendulkar has visited Rashtrapati Bhavan multiple times to receive honours, this was his first as a guest of the President.""We spoke about the Hockey World Cup in Bhubaneswar, which I watched with my friend Dilip Tirkey. We also discussed Odisha’s cuisine. Walking through the corridors of Rashtrapati Bhavan and seeing portraits of our freedom fighters gave me goosebumps,"" he said.Widely regarded as one of cricket’s greatest players, Tendulkar holds the record for the most runs in both Tests (15,921) and ODIs (18,426), along with 100 international centuries. Honoured with the Bharat Ratna in 2014, his legacy continues to inspire generations.",Sachin tendulkar was a guest of president droupadi murmu at an event at rashtrapati bhavan. He spoke about the importance of sticking together as a team.

Will Rohit Sharma win another ICC trophy? Here's what the horoscope says

NEW DELHI: Former Australia captain Ricky Ponting believes the focus now shifts to Mohammed Shami as he returns from injury in India's ongoing limited-overs series against England. Shami, who last played for India, before the England series, in the ICC Men's Cricket World Cup final in November 2023, is seen as a crucial asset for the team ahead of the upcoming ICC Men's Champions Trophy ""My biggest concern about India when they came for Australia in the Test series was [Jasprit] Bumrah not having Shami there as a backup and him having to burden most of the load,"" Ponting said on The ICC Review.""And that's probably what happened, and might even have something to do with why he [Bumrah] got hurt. He probably ended up having to bowl a bit more in that series with Shami not being there.""So look, if Shami's fit, that's a positive.""Shami made his return in the third and fourth T20Is against England, putting up an impressive performance with figures of 3/25 in his latest outing.Former India head coach and cricketer Ravi Shastri emphasised the importance of managing Shami's workload in the upcoming ODI series against England.""It will be interesting to see if India play him out in all three, or they give him the first one and the third one, and then ease him into the Champions Trophy ,"" Shastri said.""But he'll be watched very closely because 10 overs is totally different to four overs, and then you're going to see how he pulls up in the field as well having bowled those 10 overs.""Shami's form and fitness will be crucial for India as they begin their ICC Men's Champions Trophy campaign against Bangladesh on February 20 in Dubai. With Bumrah already handling a significant workload, the return of a fully fit Shami could provide India with much-needed bowling depth and balance ahead of a crucial tournament.","Former australia captain ricky ponting believes the focus now shifts to mohammed shami as he returns from injury.

NEW DELHI: Former India cricketer and ex-head coach Ravi Shastri understands the significance of the intense rivalry between India and Pakistan in international cricket. He recently shared his thoughts on current head coach Gautam Gambhir ’s remarks ahead of their highly anticipated ICC Champions Trophy clash.India and Pakistan, both placed in Group A of the tournament, will face off on February 23 in Dubai. The two teams last met at the venue in an ICC event in 2021, where Pakistan secured a dominant 10-wicket victory.Gambhir recently stated that the Champions Trophy group-stage match against Pakistan holds the same importance as any other fixture in the tournament, emphasizing that all games carry equal value.Speaking on the latest edition of The ICC Review, Shastri acknowledged that he had expressed a similar sentiment during his tenure as head coach but hinted that there is more to it than meets the eye.“I was the coach for seven years. Whenever I was asked, I said the same thing (as Gambhir). But let me assure you, deep down, there's a lot more to that than you actually think, that's for the media,” Shastri said.“You have to say it. But deep down, you want to win that. Because if you don't, you'll be reminded of it until the next time you play against Pakistan.“People don't care what you have done in the past. They're not bothered about the last 10 games if you won eight or you won nine. But they'll remind you if you lose one, until the next time you play them.“It can be a taxi driver, it could be anyone on the street. What happened to India? The same question to Pakistan. What happened to Pakistan? So it always plays on your mind, so whether you like it or not, it's a different game. Different beasts altogether.”Shastri, however, believes that the throwback won’t be taking up much headspace for Indian players.“No, that won't play on their mind because that was a T20 game. This is a 50-over clash. It's totally different,"" Shastri said.“And it's a longer game which suits India more, because in T20 you can get upset. In 50-over cricket, if you've got experience and you've got depth in your batting and bowling departments and you know, it makes a massive, massive difference.“And when you look at India and Pakistan man to man, India is a far better side and far more experienced as well.”",Former india head coach ravi shastri understands the significance of the intense rivalry between india and pakistan in international cricket. He believes that india is a far better side and far more experienced as well.
