NEW DELHI: Chennai Super Kings were dealt a major blow on Thursday as regular skipper Ruturaj Gaikwad was ruled out of the IPL due to an elbow injury.

A goal for the ages: Alex Ovechkin breaks Wayne Gretzky's 26-year record



FULL Alex Ovechkin Celebration Ceremony After Record-Breaking Goal No. 895

A legacy passed down: Anastasia Shubskaya receives diamond tribute from Janet Gretzky



After Alex Ovechkin netted his 895th career goal and broke legendary Wayne Gretzky 's record, Janet Gretzky showed respect to a time-honored hockey tradition by gifting Anastasia Shubskaya , wife of Alex Ovechkin, an eight-carat diamond ring that had been estimated at $280,000. The Capitals may have lost to the New York Islanders by a score of 4-1, but the outcome was an afterthought to a night all about legacy, love, and a new chapter in hockey's history.The moment of history arrived at 7:26 of the second period. Alex Ovechkin let go of a blazing shot through fellow Russian Ilya Sorokin, making himself the NHL's all-time leading goal scorer. Fans inside UBS Arena lost their minds, and Alex Ovechkin commemorated the occasion by executing a belly flop onto the ice—celebrating his big achievement.Alex Ovechkin celebrated this achievement in a pregame ceremony against the Carolina Hurricanes on April 10, 2025. He was given a six-foot sculptural painting by TYP depicting his skates and game-used sticks, with his image on it, with “Most Goals All Time” written on the top and “895 Alex Ovechkin 895” on the bottom.While Alex Ovechkin was absorbing the enormity of his achievement, Anastasia Shubskaya was gifted a symbolic token of the historic night. Continuing a tradition started in 1994, when Colleen Howe (wife of Gordie Howe) gave Janet Gretzky a diamond ring after her husband, Wayne Gretzky, broke Colleen Howe’s husband’s record, Janet Gretzky ensured history repeated itself—this time from one hockey family to another.In an interview with the media, Wayne Gretzky said, “A month ago, my wife said, ‘You know, Colleen Howe started a tradition. I’m not sure if anyone is going to break Alex’s record, but I want to give her (Ovechkin’s wife, Anastasia Shubskaya) something really unique.’ So, we went out and she picked out an eight-diamond ring for Alex’s wife. Not only do hockey guys pass down traditions. So do the families and wives.”The act not only spanned generations of greatness but also underlined the strong relationship between hockey families across generations.Anastasia Shubskaya, who tied the knot with Alex Ovechkin in 2016, is a Russian model who has appeared in numerous Russian magazines during her career and has built a strong social media presence. They are proud parents of two sons- Sergei and Ilya.Also read: “Now the real stuff is coming”: Alex Ovechkin skips The Tonight Show appearance to stay playoff-ready Even though the Capitals fell on the evening, the larger context is one of hope.

With the NHL playoffs coming, Alex Ovechkin and the Washington Capitals aim to ride the wave of history toward what would be a fairy tale conclusion to the 2025 campaign.","Alex ovechkin scored his 895th career goal against the new york islanders on april 10, 2025.

Isiah Thomas slammed LeBron James for his shirtless appearance on the court



Fans react to Isiah Thomas’ criticism of LeBron James



With great fandom comes huge criticism, and LeBron James is no exception. James, who has received astonishing fame and accolades over the years in his glorious career in the NBA, has recently been called out by former Detroit Pistons point guard and NBA analyst, Isiah Thomas as the Lakers legend appeared shirtless in his pregame practices on the court. Thomas called the gesture unprofessional and said that the NBA should punish it.The Los Angeles Lakers are set to face the Houston Rockets in a crucial matchup on Friday, April 11. The game is going to be quite important for both teams, with a lot at stake. James, who is available to play the highly anticipated showdown at the Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles, has been called out by NBA legend and analyst Isiah Thomas.James appeared shirtless on the court ahead of the game for his practice sessions, which did not go well with Thomas. “I would never let one of my player walk out on the floor looking like this. I mean, we are professional NBA league. We ain’t summer league,” Thomas said. ""I totally 100% object to this.”“I just think that the professionalism in our NBA league has diminished so much,"" he continued.Thomas went on to add, “Look I like LeBron, I’m a fan of his but to walk out on a floor before game with no shirt on, come on, man, this… Where we at? What we doing?”“Adam Silver if you wanna fine somebody, fine that, put a fine on that,” he added, urging the Commissioner of the NBA to punish James for his shirtless appearance.Fans online, however, are not very pleased with Thomas’ plea for LeBron James’ punishment.“I watched him walk off the court with time left on clock, past my Bulls bench, no hand shakes, nothing. That is as UNPROFESSIONAL as I’ve ever seen. Fkn hypocrite. What a joke,” one fan wrote on X.“I’m not even LeBron guy but this is ridiculous. Zeke has done a lot of major things wrong and is mad Bron is shooting a basketball without his shirt on,” another wrote, supporting James.“What a farce. This league has gone downhill so much.”One fan initially thought it was a joke, “I watched this on NBATV. Come on now, it's pre-game warmups. I thought Isiah was messing around and going to compliment him on his physique, which led him to say that. I get that the NBA is different now, but this is LeBron. Relax.”“This look like the warmup before the official warmup.. like before the fans even get there. Nahhh zeke. Lol”“why are we giving screen time to Isaiah?”Also Read: LeBron James ""I love everything about that guy"" explains why he'd want to play with Steph Curry As for LeBron James, he has been in great shape and, at 40, is still playing at an elite level.

Shedeur Sanders throws shade at NFL teams while embracing possible backup role to Aaron Rodgers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/shedeur-sanders-throws-shade-at-nfl-teams-while-embracing-possible-backup-role-to-aaron-rodgers/articleshow/120209182.cms,"Image via Imagn Images

Shedeur Sanders impressed during Steelers visit and shared mutual respect with the coaching staff

Learning from a legend? Sheduer Sanders welcomes the idea of sitting behind Aaron Rodgers

As the 2025 NFL Draft looms, Shedeur Sanders is making headlines not only for his talent but also for his poised and grounded mindset. The Colorado star quarterback recently completed a high-profile visit with the Pittsburgh Steelers , a franchise long associated with football tradition, grit, and championship pedigree. While questions swirl around the team’s quarterback future — especially with Aaron Rodgers in the mix — Sanders has made it clear he’s open to whatever path unfolds.Describing his visit to Pittsburgh in glowing terms, Sheduer Sanders told Kay Adams in an interview, “It was a 10. I enjoyed my time in Pittsburgh. I connected well with all the coaches and it was really fun. The best part of the day of course was talking football. It’s my favorite part. It’s just really getting to know each other.”That connection could prove vital as Pittsburgh eyes its next franchise quarterback. With the No. 21 overall pick, the Steelers may find Sanders available — but whether he slides that far is still uncertain. The Heisman hopeful remains confident that teams passing on him would be making a costly mistake. “That’s on the people. That’s on the other franchises that make their mistake and let me go there (Pittsburgh),” he said, signaling his readiness to thrive in the Steelers' system.Perhaps the biggest twist in this potential match-up is the reported interest from the Steelers in Aaron Rodgers — the veteran quarterback whose legacy includes a Super Bowl title and multiple MVP awards. Rodgers is still deciding his future, but if he does land in Pittsburgh, Sanders may find himself in a backup role early on. Rather than balking at the idea, Sanders showed maturity beyond his years.“We didn’t talk about anybody,” Sanders said about Rodgers. “If that’s the way that things play out, that’s how it’ll play out (learn behind Rodgers). I wouldn’t question what God has planned for me.”Also Read: Why Aaron Rodgers’ weekly appearances are raising eyebrows in sports media — Has Pat McAfee given him too much power? In an era where young quarterbacks often demand immediate starts, Sanders’ calm acceptance of potentially learning under Rodgers speaks volumes. Whether he starts Day 1 or takes time to develop, the 21-year-old is already demonstrating the mindset of a future NFL leader — and possibly the next great Steeler under center.","Shedeur sanders impressed during steelers visit and shared mutual respect with the coaching staff.

Josh Berry shares frustration over being known for going to school with Taylor Swift, not for racing

Josh Berry, Las Vegas Recap, and a Big Miami Weekend Coming Up

Josef Newgarden and Josh Berry bond over shared roots and racing journey



NASCAR driver Josh Berry has had enough of Taylor Swift questions — and he’s making that very clear. Though the two attended the same high school in Hendersonville, Tennessee, Berry says the constant fascination with Swift's personal life, especially her relationship with NFL star Travis Kelce , has become overwhelming.In a recent appearance on the Rubbin is Racing podcast, Berry spoke candidly about how one offhand comment during a past interview snowballed into a recurring distraction. “It’s one of those things when you’re like doing an interview one day and somebody’s like, hey, what’s a funny crazy story about you, right? And I’m like, oh, I went to school with Taylor Swift, and you don’t think that that’s that big of a deal,” he explained.But once Swift began dating Travis Kelce, the buzz around his old schoolmate reached new heights. “But I mean, good gosh! Man, every time it never ends. And then she starts dating Travis Kelce, and it all comes back again, and I’m like I don’t care about Travis Kelce, like I don’t care, and it never ends,” Berry added with exasperation.While his frustration is clear, it also highlights a recurring challenge many athletes face: being overshadowed by pop culture associations that have little to do with their careers.Interestingly, Berry wasn’t the only motorsport name to walk those high school halls. Josef Newgarden, a two-time IndyCar champion, was also a classmate. The two have reconnected in recent years thanks to Berry’s move to Wood Brothers Racing, which shares a technical alliance with Team Penske — Newgarden’s home team.Their renewed bond led them to return to their alma mater during the off-season through a visit sponsored by shared partner PPG. The drivers spoke with students, posed for photos, and endured a few laughs at their own expense. “The kids had a field day teasing us after finding our old yearbook photos,” Berry recalled.Also Read: The real reason Taylor Swift avoids Coachella: Why the pop star's absence from the music festival continues to stand out Though their paths diverged after high school, the revelation that they both came from the same small-town classrooms and went on to thrive in elite racing circles has only added a new layer to their friendship — one that has nothing to do with Taylor Swift.","Nascar driver josh berry attended the same high school as taylor swift.

NEW DELHI: Chennai Super Kings suffered a major setback as regular skipper Ruturaj Gaikwad was ruled out of the IPL due to an elbow injury — a development that has paved the way for Mahendra Singh Dhoni to return to the leadership role.

MS Dhoni to take over as captain,"" Fleming told mediapersons on Thursday.“He (Gaikwad) got hit in Guwahati. He’s been operating with an amount of pain. We got an X-ray, which was inconclusive, and we had an MRI, which revealed a fracture in his elbow, in the radial neck. So we’re disappointed and feel for him. We appreciate the efforts that he’s gone to in terms of trying to play, but unfortunately, he’d be out of the tournament from now.

He made two changes to the Playing XI, bringing in Rahul Tripathi in place of Gaikwad and including Anshul Kamboj for Mukesh Choudhary.""We were looking to bat first. Quite a few occasions where we tried to chase it down and what we realised is that the wicket slows down a bit, so if you don't get a good start then the middle order comes under pressure. (On Ruturaj) He has fractured something on his elbow, so he is ruled out of the tournament. He is a very authentic batter, someone who looks to time the ball well. So yeah, he will be a big miss,"" Dhoni said during the toss.""(On the importance of winning this game) It is important now, every game is important. We have lost too many matches and now it is important to do the basics right - have dot balls, take our catches. A couple of games we lost by big margins, but otherwise it was about the small things - about one over going for 20 runs. Our batters are more authentic as batters, they won't slog everything. They just need to back their instincts. It is important to start well, get boundaries early on and try to get a couple of early wickets as well.

The Hardik Pandya-led Mumbai Indians have already arrived in the capital and are currently training in the city.However, their preparations were affected as Delhi and surrounding NCR regions experienced a sudden dip in temperature on Friday, accompanied by dusty storms for the second consecutive day. The weather disrupted flight operations at the Delhi airport, leading to multiple delays and diversions — and even impacted Mumbai Indians’ practice session.In a video shared by the Mumbai Indians on their social media platforms, star batter Rohit Sharma is seen reacting humorously to the incoming storm. As strong winds hit the stadium, Rohit can be heard shouting “comeback” to his teammates. He then playfully tells the cameraman to focus on the storm instead of him.(Hey, why are you filming me? Shoot the storm instead),"" Rohit says in the clip.Meanwhile, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued a yellow alert for Delhi on April 11, with temperatures expected to range between 23°C and 38°C.While the storms caused disruption, the overcast skies and cooler winds brought a brief respite from the heatwave that had gripped the region over the past week.Delhi Capitals remain the only unbeaten side in the tournament so far with four wins from four matches.Mumbai Indians, on the other hand, are struggling at the bottom half of the table — placed eighth with just one win and four defeats in five games.","Delhi capitals to host mumbai indians in their ipl 2025 clash on sunday.

Scottie Pippen has played in the NBA for 17 seasons and has six NBA Championship wins under his belt. The athlete is considered to be one of the greatest small forwards in NBA history. Additionally, his achievements include being one of the two players in history who have won an Olympic Gold Medal and an NBA title twice in the same year. After earning great fame and recognition, we are taking a look at how this has impacted his financial portfolio.According to Celebrity Net Worth, Scottie Pippen has a net worth of $20 million. This comes after playing with the Chicago Bulls for 12 seasons, with the Houston Rockets for one season and the Portland Trail Blazers for four seasons. After all the achievements and accolades, his net worth is not as high as his peers. This comes after the star is known to be one of the most underpaid players of all time. He signed a 7-year contract with the Bulls for $18 million. Thus, when the Bulls were at their peak and Michael Jordan would earn $30+ million annually, Pippen would only earn $2.6 million.However, his contract with the Houston Rockets earned him a staggering $67.2 million. Post this, when he joined the Bulls during the last two years of his career, he earned $10 million. While he has earned over $109 million over the years as an NBA player, his net worth has diminished massively.Pippen's net worth also accounted to numerous brand endorsements.
