T20 World Cup: Shaheen Shah Afridi press conference after England vs Pakistan

T20 World Cup Super 8s Group 2 Points Table

P W L NR Points NRR England (Q) 2 2 0 0 4 +1.491 New Zealand 2 1 0 1 3 +3.050 Pakistan 2 0 1 1 1 -0.461 Sri Lanka (E) 2 0 2 0 0 -2.800

NEW DELHI: New Zealand knocked co-hosts Sri Lanka out of the T20 World Cup with a comprehensive 61-run win in Colombo on Wednesday, but the result has also kept Pakistan in contention for a dramatic semi-final qualification. With England already through, the race for the final spot from Super Eights Group 2 will now be decided over the last two matches.Chasing 169, Sri Lanka needed a convincing victory to stay alive but faltered badly, crawling to 107/8 and exiting the tournament with one game still to play. The heavy defeat ended their campaign and confirmed a fifth straight failure to reach the semi-finals since their 2014 title triumph. The win also significantly boosted New Zealand, whose net run rate jumped to a healthy +3.050, putting them in pole position to qualify alongside England.However, Pakistan’s hopes hinge on the outcome of England versus New Zealand in Colombo on Friday. If New Zealand defeat England, they will finish on five points and qualify directly, rendering Pakistan’s final Super Eights clash against Sri Lanka irrelevant.Pakistan’s opportunity opens up only if England beat New Zealand. In that scenario, England will top the group with six points, leaving New Zealand on three and Pakistan with a chance to draw level if they beat Sri Lanka in their final match in Kandy.If Pakistan win and both teams finish on three points, qualification will be decided by net run rate. The current projections underline the scale of the task facing Pakistan.For instance, if England beat New Zealand by 50 runs, Pakistan would need to defeat Sri Lanka by roughly 20 runs to edge ahead on net run rate, assuming a first-innings score of around 170.If Pakistan chase instead, the equation becomes tougher. They would need to complete the chase in approximately 17.5 overs to surpass New Zealand’s net run rate. Any slower victory could still leave them behind the Blackcaps.England’s dominance in the Super Eights has simplified the group standings, but Sri Lanka’s exit has ensured the final semi-finalist will be decided in a tense finish.Pakistan must now deliver not just a win, but a big one — and hope England do them a favour — to keep their World Cup dream alive.","New zealand knocked co-hosts sri lanka out of the t20 world cup with a comprehensive 61-run win in colombo on wednesday.

has put India in a position where they can't afford to slip up. Their net run rate (NRR) is the second worst in the Super Eight stage. To keep their last-four hopes alive, the Men in Blue need to win convincingly against Zimbabwe and the West Indies. Win is the keyword as anything less would keep the permutations alive but effectively end their campaign. Even a win requires an assist from South Africa, but this scenario should place them in better territory.Now, in the form of Zimbabwe, India are up against an opposition that has already silenced a home crowd in the group stages when they beat Sri Lanka in Colombo. Thursday presents them with another opportunity to replicate that success at the noisy Chepauk. Both teams find themselves in a must-win situation and Zimbabwe's Ryan Burl didn't venture into the ""dangerous"" territory of silencing India in India. The 31-year-old prefers to focus on his side's process and sticking to what worked for them vs Sri Lanka, in Sri Lanka.""It will be quite dangerous to answer how I am going to silence India in India. No, I mean obviously playing against Sri Lanka and Sri Lanka with home ground advantage is very difficult. But ultimately how we approach tomorrow's game is going to be no different to how we've approached the games before in the sense that we have our processes, we've got our game plan, yes it does change here and there according to the conditions and your opponents but ultimately we want to play the game that we know how to play and we have found a lot of success doing it that way.So we would obviously want to focus on as much as what our strengths are but taking into account the challenges that the opposition does present,"" said Burl.However, the pressure seems greater in the Indian camp as the runaway favourites find themselves in a position to keep their campaign alive. A side which dominated the bilateral circuit for close to two years finds itself in a delicate position with players running low on confidence. Even during Tuesday's training at Chepauk, the batters, who were short on runs, took a little while to regain the dominating flow which helped them set the stage on fire in recent months. Some World Cup debutants are probably coming to terms with the pressure of the multi-nation tournament, compounded by the added pressure of it being at home.""World Cup in India, there will be pressure. I am a big believer that any international game you play, even I have played some ordinary district game, when you go to bat, you will feel pressure. If you do not feel that anxiety, it means you are not playing cricket. So that anxiety you learn to deal with it from the start of your career. And this is a big pressure game obviously when you are representing a country and a World Cup in India and a lot of expectation.""But I honestly believe that for a professional that is part of his life and we should deal with that in a positive manner. Just because we lost one game and we did not have good partnership and all, people talk more about it. But I honestly think they all are good enough to handle that pressure. If we want to win the World Cup, we have to handle that pressure. If we can't, then it's tough. And I don't believe that there is anything this team cannot handle. So it's just, I'm personally looking for that momentum. Once we start getting that momentum again, if we do it from tomorrow, I think they will be picking up at the right time. So I am looking at it that way,"" said India batting coach Kotak India are yet to play a perfect game in the tournament and the famed batting, billed as the real deal in the build-up, is yet to fire on all cylinders. Amongst the teams that qualified for the Super 8 stage, India's collective batting is the worst at around 20 and they have recorded as many as 11 ducks so far, again the most. Not a number to be proud of but it isn't something which the think tank is losing sleep over. According to Kotak, the team focuses on collective success or failure; individual setbacks do not weigh them down in the business end of the tournament.In Zimbabwe, India again faces an opponent aware of its shortcomings and possessing enough variety in its attack to test the best. Blessing Muzarabani has been a real threat, already picking up 11 wickets in the tournament. However, the 6'9"" bowler isn't the only weapon in their arsenal; they also boast effective spin and seam options.""We've obviously got a lot of options and that's probably one of the advantages of the Zimbabwe lineup is we've got left arm seamer, right arm seamer, we've got couple leg spinners, we've got an off spinner, we've got a left arm offie. So we do have quite a lot of depth and I think it will probably just come down to what are the match-ups depending on the batters that are out there at the time and obviously the combinations that we do look to go for,"" explained Burl.The lanky Blessing stood out during the nets; it was difficult to miss the intimidating frame. Against India, he will definitely bring something different to the table and Burl emphasised that he hasn't received the credit he deserves for his performances in the tournament.""I mean being 6 foot 9 does help. I have to give a lot more credit to Blessing than he has received, because he's been out for about four to six months prior to this tournament. And he obviously had a lot of doubts coming in with his own body and how he was feeling and stuff like that. The success that he has had with the ball has been amazing. It's not something that has only just come about now.""He has been doing this in international cricket previously. He's obviously someone that we really do, we're really happy having in our squad. He's one of those bowlers that's obviously 6'9"", and he does kind of come a little bit from beyond the perpendicular. So jagging the ball back into the righties and across the lefties with that steep bounce does propose quite a lot of a challenge for the batters. So I'm a lot happier knowing that he's on my team and not on the opposition,"" added Burl.In a few hours, India's campaign will gain much more clarity, starting with the game between South Africa and West Indies. The result of that game will have a major bearing on India's campaign as after the Ahmedabad blip, the control has slipped",Zimbabwe's ryan burl says it will be 'dangerous' to silence india in india. Both teams find themselves in a must-win situation at the noisy chepauk. Zimbabwe have already silenced a home crowd in the group stages. India are yet to play a perfect game in the tournament.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128693178,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-34176,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"

A door closes.

Montreal Canadiens’ Patrik Laine trade outlook before March 6 deadline



With a few days to the trade deadline in the NHL, set to be on March 6, the Montreal Canadiens face several unanswered roster questions, and Patrik Laine is among the most talked about topics in recent NHL trade rumors. The veteran winger has not been able to play most of the season due to undergoing core muscle surgery and, therefore, has not been that influential in the match outcomes in the NHL.On the face of it, Laine has a huge cap hit of 8.7 million that can serve as a significant obstacle to any player who is venturing into a deal. League executives are not so worried about the situation, however, as the raw number would suggest. The financial problem can not be as limiting as taken into account in the current NHL updates since the contract has expired after this season, and Montreal retains its options in the form of salary retention.Patrik Laine has not been playing a game in the NHL with Montreal since October, but the fact that he resumed practicing during the Olympic break was a significant boost. From an NHL injury updates viewpoint, the teams will be keen on whether he can record game action before the deadline. Even a short-term recovery would alleviate the anxiety around conditioning and endurance.Laine is one of the more dangerous pure shooters in the league when he is healthy.His prowess on the power play and creating on the rush is a quality that makes him appealing to playoff-bound teams that are seeking finishing talent. Since he has one more year left of his deal, the process of acquiring clubs would be only of short term financial risk.The second significant consideration is the vacant salary retention positions in Montreal. The Canadiens can keep a serviceable amount of the cap hit of Laine, reducing the load of a competitor at the cap floor. Such flexibility expands the market and gives Montreal a stronger bargaining power.The result is that the seriousness of trade talks will depend on the health of Laine. In case he comes back and makes a positive contribution towards future NHL match outcomes, curiosity might develop rapidly before March 6.",The nhl trade deadline is set to be on march 6.

Blaney's race earnings: racing purse, salary, and endorsements

Gianna Tulio: modeling success and the combined value of the couple

When NASCAR star Ryan Blaney isn't burning up the asphalt in the Cup Series, he has built an off-track life that draws attention nearly as much as his victories. At the same time, his wife, model and brand ambassador Gianna Tulio, has carved out her own niche in endorsements and fashion partnerships. As 2026 approaches, their financial picture shows both a measure of success in racing and strategic brand-building. The pair’s story goes beyond pay cheques and contracts; it's a high school romance that blossomed into marriage, now driving a mixed income from sport, sponsorships, and social influence.Blaney's net worth has been increasing steadily throughout his competitive racing life. According to reports, Blaney’s net worth is estimated to be between $5 million and $13 million based on contract value, etc., race winnings, and endorsements. As a member of Team Penske's key drivers, Blaney receives a base salary that is reported to be in the multi-million-dollar range on a yearly basis, with bonuses for performance, including wins and playoff appearances.Blaney has also been in the spotlight as a major brand representative for BodyArmor, Advance Auto Parts, and Menards, among others, bolstering his commercial presence.According to sports business reporting trends, endorsement contracts can be very lucrative for a driver's annual compensation, particularly those at a championship level. He also runs the Ryan Blaney Family Foundation, aiding causes ranging from brain health awareness to initiatives that add long-term value to his brand.Tulio's career complements the success of her husband. She made a name for herself with national recognition after being crowned in 2021 as Miss Hooters International, taking her modeling profile to the next level, and helped her bag ambassador opportunities. Her income comes from modeling contracts, promotional partnerships, and lifestyle endorsements, placing her personal net worth between from $500,000 to $1 million.Their relationship, which started years before their December 2024 wedding, has been a visible part of Blaney's life in racing.

Philadelphia Eagles wide receiver A.J. Brown linked to Denver Broncos as trade option

Imagine the speed of A.J. Brown and the accuracy of Bo Nix. Now, club a Super Bowl winner with a great Lombardi contender. And now, finally, picture a Super Bowl happening. That’s what several analysts and insiders have been contemplating. They are linking Brown with the Denver Broncos.According to Spotrac, Brown signed a three-year contract worth $96 million, including a $19 million signing bonus, $84 million in guaranteed money, and an average annual salary of $32 million, with the Philadelphia Eagles in 2024.The 28-year-old WR1 is scheduled to earn a base salary of $1.3 million, a signing bonus of $27 million, and a workout bonus of $250K, while carrying a cap hit of $23 million for the Philadelphia Eagles in 2026. He becomes an unrestricted free agent only in 2030.But Eagles general manager Howie Roseman recently told reporters that the team has to set its priorities straight and cannot play favorites. One way to do that is not keep players with second contracts on rookie deals. Was that a link to Brown? Only time will tell. Roseman even said he was ready to listen to offers for everything and anything. Now that could bring out the Broncos.Head coach Nick Sirianni also did not give a firm response for the wideout’s future. “Will A.J. be here next year? I think we’re still in a spot, like, I can’t guarantee how anything is going to play out into next season. I’m thinking I’m going to be the coach next season, but you can’t guarantee anything past tomorrow,” Sirianni told ESPN’s Tim McManus. Now comes the question of Brown’s correlation to Bo Nix’s Broncos.Yahoo Sports’ Charles Robinson reported that Brown’s trade availability became undeniably obvious with the coach’s and general manager’s responses on Tuesday. This opened the trade market availability for Brown. He makes a perfect fit for the Buffalo Bills, Houston Texans, New England Patriots, and the Denver Broncos. At Broncos, he can be a valuable weapon for a young, agile quarterback like Bo Nix.Matt Sullivan of The Sporting News suggested that sending a late first-round pick to Denver could be a way to acquire Brown in a trade from Philadelphia. Plus, there is enough receiving corps room in Denver. Courtland Sutton is good, so are Pat Bryant, Troy Franklin, and Marvin Mims, but if the Broncos needed a true alpha, they could look no further than the three-time Pro Bowler: A.J. Brown.","Philadelphia eagles wide receiver a.j. Brown linked to denver broncos as trade option.

NHL contenders face steep deadline cost as Calgary Flames look to put huge price tag on Mackenzie Weegar



Practice Day | MacKenzie Weegar -18.02.26

The Calgary Flames are sending a clear message that they are willing to make deals leading up to the 2026 NHL Trade Deadline, but trading top defenseman Mackenzie Weegar will not come cheaply. Sources within the league believe that they are looking for a high draft pick and a top prospect or NHL-ready player in return for Mackenzie Weegar, which reflects the team’s dedication to rebuilding through asset accumulation.Interest in Mackenzie Weegar is picking up as playoff contenders look to shore up their blue lines. Weegar, 32, has a reasonable cap hit of $6.25 million through the 2030-31 season, making him much more than a rental player. His high-end minute-gathering ability, physical play, and versatility to play all situations have made him one of the most valuable defensemen available.Several teams have already shown interest in Mackenzie Weegar. The Ottawa Senators are one of the teams that need a boost on the right side, while the Detroit Red Wings have also shown interest. In general, the Boston Bruins, Buffalo Sabres, Dallas Stars, San Jose Sharks, and Utah Mammoth are thought to be following the developments, which is not surprising given that quality defensemen are hard to come by in the current market.The Calgary Flames strategy is simple. If the team trades away one of its core players who is under a long-term contract, the return should expedite the rebuild. This approach is consistent with the team’s previous major trade, where they received a tremendous package, which reinforces the team’s management’s commitment to seeking long-term gains rather than short-term ones.Weegar’s traditional stats this year are indicative of the struggles of playing with a struggling team – three goals, 20 points, and a problematic plus/minus rating. Nevertheless, his underlying game is still excellent. He averages more than 23 minutes per game, is one of the team leaders in blocked shots and hits, and continues to face top-level competition.Since coming to Calgary in 2022, Weegar has been a steady presence, putting up 35 goals, 150 points, and countless blocks and hits in 300 games. And with a contract that is secure, Weegar is one of the most stable defensive options available to teams at the trade deadline.The question is no longer whether teams are interested in Weegar. It is whether any playoff contender is willing to pay the hefty price tag that Calgary is demanding. With the market leaning in favor of sellers and playoff-bound teams looking to shore up their defensive corps, Calgary may be in a position to call the shots—and perhaps change the course of their franchise with one big trade.","Mackenzie weegar, 32, has a reasonable cap hit of $6.25 million through the 2030-31 season, making him much more than a rental player.

In a corresponding roster move, defenseman Kris Letang has been activated from Injured Reserve after missing four weeks with a fractured foot.Crosby suffered the injury during Canada's quarterfinal win over Czechia on February 19. The 38-year-old left the game in the second period after taking multiple hits from Radko Gudas and did not return. His right leg appeared to bend awkwardly when Gudas fell on top of him near the red line.The Penguins' captain was ruled out for Canada's semifinal against Finland and made the difficult decision to sit out the gold medal game against the United States. Canada lost 2-1 in overtime as Connor Hellebuyck backstopped Team USA to its first Olympic gold medal since the 1980 Miracle on Ice.Crosby tried everything to return for the gold medal game, consulting with multiple medical experts in Milan and skating both Friday and Saturday before the Sunday final.He ultimately determined he could not help the team at full capacity and prioritized giving Canada the best chance to win.""It's pretty clear, given the situation, whether you can either play or not play,"" Crosby said after the game, according to ESPN. ""And I just didn't feel like I was able to."" The injury comes at a critical time for Pittsburgh, which sits second in the Metropolitan Division with a 29-15-12 record and 70 points.The Penguins have exceeded expectations this season after missing the playoffs since 2022, building a comfortable playoff cushion with their strong 8-2-2 start. Crosby has been instrumental in Pittsburgh's success, recording 1,746 career points across 652 goals and 1,094 assists in his 19-year career.The three-time Stanley Cup champion remains one of the league's elite players despite being the oldest player on Canada's Olympic roster. Estimates suggest that he would be out for atleast four weeks. But Letang's activation provides a boost to Pittsburgh's blue line.The 38-year-old defenseman was placed on Injured Reserve on January 31 with a fractured foot and missed a minimum of four weeks. He leads Penguins defensemen with 25 points in 50 games while averaging 22:06 of ice time.The Penguins currently pace for 102.5 points over a full season, positioning them well above the playoff cutline. Pittsburgh holds a game in hand on several Metropolitan Division rivals as they navigate the final stretch without their captain.",Sidney crosby has been placed on injury reserve with a lower-body injury.

The billionaire empire behind Jessica Pegula



Jessica Pegula has spent years trying to make sure people talk about her tennis before they talk about her last name. The American star, currently ranked among the top players on the WTA Tour, recently lifted the Dubai Tennis Championships title, adding another WTA 1000 trophy to her growing résumé. It was her 10th career singles title and cemented her status as one of the most consistent players on tour. Calm under pressure and known for her steady baseline game, Pegula has built her reputation through results. But no matter how many matches she wins, curiosity about her family background always follows.Pegula is the daughter of billionaire business magnate Terry Pegula and business executive Kim Pegula: a fact that has made her one of the most financially unique athletes in professional tennis. Terry Pegula made his fortune in the energy industry. He founded East Resources, an oil and natural gas company, and in 2010 sold its assets to Royal Dutch Shell in a deal reportedly worth around $4.7 billion. That transaction transformed him into one of America’s wealthiest businessmen. Over the years, Forbes has put his approximate net worth in the multi-billion-dollar range.After building his wealth in energy, Terry shifted focus toward professional sports ownership.In 2011, he purchased the NHL’s Buffalo Sabres. Three years later, in 2014, he acquired the NFL’s Buffalo Bills for approximately $1.4 billion. Both teams remain under Pegula ownership and have since increased significantly in valuation. The Pegula family also has ownership interests in other sports entities, including the Buffalo Bandits of the National Lacrosse League.Jessica’s mother, Kim Pegula, has played a major role in the family’s business operations. She became one of the few women in the NFL to serve as a team president, taking on leadership responsibilities with the Bills and the Sabres. Kim, who was adopted from South Korea as a child, has been widely respected for her executive role in professional sports in an industry traditionally dominated by men.Despite growing up in immense wealth, Jessica Pegula has often spoken about wanting to carve out her own identity. She chose tennis early and pursued it professionally, working her way through injuries and setbacks before breaking into the top tier of the WTA Tour. Unlike many heirs to billion-dollar fortunes, she travels the same tour grind as every other player including long flights, tight match schedules and constant competition.Today, Pegula stands as both a top American tennis player and the daughter of one of the most powerful ownership families in U.S. sports.",Jessica pegula is one of the top players on the wta tour. She is the daughter of billionaire business magnate terry pegula and business executive kim pegula. Terry made his fortune in the energy industry.

MLB’s Tallest Player Sean Hjelle: Everything You Need to Know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/mlb/news/who-is-the-tallest-mlb-player-everything-you-need-to-know-about-sean-hjelle/articleshow/128793576.cms,"Sean Hjelle (Image Via Getty)

Sean Hjelle’s MLB journey, career numbers and move to Japan’s Orix Buffaloes

If you are wondering who the tallest player in Major League Baseball history is, the answer is simple. It is Sean Hjelle. He stands 6-foot-11. That ties him with former pitcher Jon Rauch for the tallest player ever to appear in an MLB game. Hjelle made his big league debut with the San Francisco Giants on May 6, 2022. From the moment he stepped on the mound, fans noticed his height. At 6-foot-11 and around 247 pounds, he looks different from almost every other pitcher in the league.Hjelle was born on May 7, 1997, in Fridley, Minnesota. Before reaching the majors, he pitched at the University of Kentucky. The Giants selected him in the second round of the 2018 MLB Draft. Over parts of three MLB seasons from 2022 to 2025, he appeared in 93 games, mostly as a reliever. He posted a 7-8 record with a 5.11 ERA and 145 strikeouts in nearly 150 innings. His strongest season came in 2024, when he had a 3.90 ERA over 58 appearances.Sean Hjelle’s path to the majors started in high school in Minnesota, where he played both baseball and basketball. At Kentucky, he became one of the top pitchers in the Southeastern Conference.In 2017, he was named SEC Pitcher of the Year after going 9-2 with a 3.17 ERA. That strong college run boosted his draft stock and helped him earn a reported $1.5 million signing bonus from the Giants.He worked his way through the minor leagues and reached Triple-A before getting the call in 2022. In his MLB debut, he threw a scoreless inning. Giants manager Gabe Kapler once said Hjelle’s size creates a different look for hitters, making it tough to adjust to his release point. Hjelle does not rely on overpowering speed. Instead, he uses a sinker and off-speed pitches to force ground balls.The 2025 season brought challenges. Hjelle posted a 7.80 ERA in 12 MLB games that year. He performed better in Triple-A with a 2.90 ERA. The Giants designated him for assignment on July 30, 2025, and he later became a free agent.On January 11, 2026, Hjelle signed with the Orix Buffaloes in Japan’s Nippon Professional Baseball league. At 28 years old, he chose a new opportunity overseas to continue his career. Off the field, he is married to his wife Caroline and is a father of two.Sean Hjelle’s height may grab attention first, but his journey shows how hard it is to stay at the top level of baseball.","Sean hjelle made his mlb debut with the san francisco giants in 2022.

Here’s a look at the richest golfers of 2025



J.J. Spaun - $13,278,222

Russell Henley - $14,707,570

Rory McIlroy - $16,992,418

Tommy Fleetwood - $18,496,238

Scottie Scheffler - $27,659,550

They say golf is a rich person’s game. At the same time, the sport gives back generously. Golfers and their caddies earn big. Like other sports, golf requires planning, strategy, mental toughness, physical fitness, the ability to stay injury-free, adaptability in different weather conditions, and a bit of luck. Every year, new golfers join the circuit. Some succeed, some sustain their form, some leave the sport, some pursue it as a hobby, and others take it up professionally. Among them are those determined to compete at the top of the leaderboard week after week and earn staggering prize money in the process. When discussing the sport, rankings matter, but so do the numbers that define a golfer’s wealth.According to nationalclubgolfer.com, the American professional golfer had a brilliant 2025 season. J.J. Spaun won the U.S. Open at Oakmont, draining a 64-footer on the 72nd hole to seal the victory. Along with the coveted title, he pocketed a first-place prize of $4,300,000. Spaun suffered a major disappointment when he lost to Rory McIlroy in a playoff at The Players Championship at TPC Sawgrass but bounced back to claim his first major at the U.S. Open.Russell Henley has become a prominent name on the golf circuit due to his consistent performances.He turned professional in 2011 and has competed in over 300 tournaments. Henley claimed his fifth career victory in 2025, lifting the trophy at the Arnold Palmer Invitational at Bay Hill. His biggest win came when he defeated Collin Morikawa by a single stroke.Rory McIlroy is among the richest golfers in the world. Of all his seasons, 2025 stands out as one of his best. McIlroy won both the AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am and The Players Championship, then completed the career Grand Slam by winning the Masters in April. He also claimed the Irish Open title and added another feather to his cap by leading Europe to a Ryder Cup victory. He finished the year with his seventh Race to Dubai title, surpassing the legendary Seve Ballesteros.It’s difficult to emerge from the shadow of legends, but Tommy Fleetwood did so in style. With McIlroy dominating much of the season, Fleetwood finally broke through to win a PGA Tour event - the Tour Championship at East Lake.Scottie Scheffler made nearly $30 million last year, topping the earnings chart for 2025. His dominance was evident as he won 50% of the majors he played, including the PGA Championship and The Open. He left legends like McIlroy trailing behind.So what was the reason for Scheffler’s dominance? Consistency. He finished inside the top 25 in all 20 of his appearances, including 17 top-10 finishes, one runner-up result, and six victories.Also read: Massive paydays, bigger smiles: 2026 Genesis Invitational prize list revealed","Scottie scheffler made nearly $30 million last year, topping the earnings chart for 2025.

Turk Lesnar’s breakout on the ice turns heads

A family of elite athletes, from track to the rink

Brock Lesnar has been skating, and his athletic legacy keeps on expanding. Following the national title of his daughter, Mya, last year, the focus has moved onto his son, Turk Lesnar, who is rapidly establishing his name in junior hockey. Recently, Turk scored a hat trick with the Calgary Rockies U17 team in the Junior Prospects Hockey League, and the highlight reel says it all. He plays like a freight locomotive, checks like freight, and scores like a freight train, and the fans have often joked that he resembles Brock Lesnar on skates, which is quite scary to those who play against him.The cherry on top? Turk also attributed his teammate, known as Beersy, with assisting him on the hat trick, saying he set it up in such a way that it was like a movie. The league uploaded the clips on the Internet, and they have been viral indeed. The combination of physical attributes and grace is an indication that Turk is more than a household name; he is a player to be monitored.Turk is a descendant of an already impressive family background. In 2025, Mya Lesnar won the NCAA outdoor shot put championship, cementing her position as one of the best collegiate throwers in the nation.It is apparent that athletic greatness is in the blood of Lesnar.In Minnesota and Saskatchewan, Brock established a legendary career of his own, encompassing pro wrestling, NFL aspirations, and a UFC heavyweight title reign. Life in Canada also suggests the reasons why hockey turned into a family affair. Brock has another son, Sable, who is rising the ladder of hockey with his wife. The Western Hockey League Medicine Hat Tigers drafted Duke last year.On his part, Brock is scheduled to be present at WrestleMania 42 in Las Vegas in April as well, with no opponent announced as yet. The Lesnar name still towers so big in the sports world, whether it is in the ring or on the rink.

Arvell Reese drawing interest from top draft teams

Combine performance could cement Arvell Reese’s status

The 2026 NFL Scouting Combine has attracted a lot of attention to some of the best prospects, and Ohio State linebacker Arvell Reese is one of the most talked-about names this week. Reese had a great collegiate season in 2025 and is now one of the best defensive players in the upcoming NFL Draft, and is widely projected to be selected within the first five picks.The 6-foot-4, 243-pound defender arrived at the combine following a rapid rise at Ohio State. His performances earned unanimous All-American honours and the Big Ten’s Butkus-Fitzgerald Linebacker of the Year award, putting him firmly on NFL teams’ radar.Reese finished his final college season with 69 tackles, 6.5 sacks and 10 tackles for loss, showcasing the versatility that has made him such an intriguing prospect. His ability to play both off-ball linebacker and edge rusher has become a major talking point for scouts evaluating his long-term role in the league.Multiple teams selecting near the top of the draft have already shown interest in Reese. Reports indicate that he met with the New York Jets and the Arizona Cardinals during combine week, two franchises that could target defensive reinforcements early in the draft.Mock drafts have consistently linked Reese with top-three selections, with some analysts projecting him as the first non-quarterback off the board. His versatility has been compared to hybrid defenders who can rush the passer while also contributing in coverage, giving defensive coordinators flexibility in how they deploy him.Reese himself has made it clear he is comfortable playing multiple roles. Speaking at the combine, he noted that teams have asked where he sees himself, and he believes he can adapt to outside linebacker or edge responsibilities at the next level. That positional flexibility could significantly boost his draft value.The combine is a very important step for Reese to prove that he is an exceptional prospect. He is anticipated to take part in both linebacker and edge drills, which will give scouts a better idea of how fast, explosive, and good he is at rushing the passer.Despite his rapid rise, Reese has acknowledged there is room for improvement, especially in coverage and refining his pass-rush technique. Still, his combination of production, athleticism and versatility makes him one of the most exciting defensive prospects in the 2026 class.With draft season approaching, Reese’s performance in Indianapolis could solidify his place as a top-five pick and potentially one of the first defensive players selected in April.","The 2026 nfl scouting combine is underway in indianapolis.

A shocking offseason twist could see LeBron James walk away and embrace a bold new NBA role

LeBron James’ next move could shift from being a player to being in the management

Despite having their star trio of Austin Reaves, LeBron James, and Luka Doncic at their disposal, the Los Angeles Lakers have dropped four of their last six games. Additionally, it appears more likely that James won't play for Los Angeles in the upcoming season as the Lakers lose more games.There isn't a real ""source"" that can confirm whether James is truly retiring, despite the fact that he has considered it over the past few years. The star of the Lakers hasn't decided yet. He can also change his mind several times before providing a definitive response.It's unclear what the 41-year-old icon James's future holds at this stage of his career, but it appears like anything is possible. Rumors are now starting to circulate that James would announce his sudden retirement this offseason and take on the role of the NBA's Las Vegas expansion team.Despite the widespread belief that LeBron James will play in the NBA for one more season, a recent article provides a compelling argument for why he might be just a few months away from retirement. James' basketball career is nearing its end at 41 years old, even if he is still playing at a high level.The NBA insider wrote:“James has gotten the unique privilege of playing with his son, Bronny James. His second son, Bryce James, is redshirting at Arizona, and as his father noted earlier in the year, is on his own timeline… The buzz has James going one more year, to get his flowers on the way out.Still, not everyone needs a farewell tour, and he may choose to retire after the 2025-26 campaign.”Eric Pincus of Bleacher Report examined the most recent developments regarding LeBron James' future on Wednesday and said that his return for the 2026–2027 campaign is by no means certain.Pincus wrote:“There’s a rumor going around the league that [James] will be the face of the NBA’s expansion team in Las Vegas… One line of thinking is that he might retire, and his agent, Rich Paul of Klutch Sports, might sell the rest of his agency to UTA (United Talent Agency). With financial backing, they then might look to step into ownership roles…”The 22-time All-Star has dabbled in retirement in recent years, but when the chips were down, he never came close to leaving the sport he has dominated for the majority of the last 25 years. There has been a lot of conjecture over the past few months that James' time with the Los Angeles Lakers will likely expire at the end of this season. The general consensus in the league, however, is that he will make a final tour for one more season. Or perhaps not.James has continued to be a very productive member of the Lakers despite being 41 years old. Consequently, as this season has progressed, James has been associated with other teams. While some speculate that he would rejoin the Cleveland Cavaliers, others say he might play alongside Stephen Curry on the Golden State Warriors, where both players hope to win one last championship before ending their careers.However, recently, James has set a goal for his post-basketball life that would keep him near the NBA, but not as a player. And this involves owning a team. His longtime friend and agent, Rich Paul, may soon take a significant step that would bring them one step closer to owning an NBA team, so that prospect may be imminent.","Lebron james is expected to play for the los angeles lakers this season.

Richard Petty reveals the Intimidator



There has been much discussion about the absence of superstar drivers in NASCAR, such as Dale Earnhardt or Jeff Gordon. Richard Petty may have a perspective on this issue. The king recently shared his thoughts on the topic. He picked the driver who ‘drives' like Dale Earnhardt, popularly known as The Intimidator. According to Petty, someone who is closer to Dale Earnhardt in terms of racing is Carson Hocevar.Recently, in a discussion with Dale Inman, Richard Petty mentioned the driver who resembles Dale Earnhardt on the track, Carson Hocevar of Spire Motorsports. Not in terms of appearance, but rather in the way he carries himself, shows old-school grit and races fiercely in every race in the NASCAR national series.“That boy in that 77, he has him in time. A lot of things he’s getting by with or doing are not really that wrong. If I go back and watch him run and stuff, he reminds me of Dale Earnhardt,” Petty said. “Earnhardt learned to get by with that stuff. That boy in the 77, he’s just going to have to learn to get by with the things that he’s doing.”But his co-host on the Richard Petty Family Racing podcast, Inman, had made a point. He believes that despite Hocevar's speed, he does not have a friend and is isolated.Inman said, “He’s got a lot of speed. He’s going to have to control himself a little bit better. But right now, he’s not making any friends, Richard. And I don’t know if he’ll overcome that enough to win a race.”However, Petty had the same response, and it was as Earnhardt said, “Earnhardt made no friends either.”At this statement, Inman further added, “I’m not sure they were alike. You say they aren’t. I don’t know. But even in a race at Atlanta, Richard, a lot of those cars were just on the ragged edge all day.”Whether he is the next Dale Earnhardt or not, Carson Hocevar, often known as ""Hurricane Hocevar,"" has successfully proven himself. Despite the #77 Spire Motorsports driver having yet to claim a victory in 82 races so far, he has really gotten very close to winning.As Richard Petty feels that unreserved aggression, unapologetic actions, and lack of hesitancy place him in the same category as Dale Earnhardt was in his youth, Kyle Petty, the King’s son, does not believe differently.","Richard petty reveals second ‘intimidator’ in nascar, strongly resembling dale earnhardt’s old-school grit.

Facing spin



Team news



New Zealand middle-order batter Mark Chapman looked perplexed when he was asked about the Super Eight groups, where all four table-toppers, who have done well in their respective groups, will end up facing each other. It has been done because of the pre-tournament seedings.The 31-year-old smiled and replied, “When it comes to scheduling and planning, that’s not really in my domain.”Chapman’s response sums up the way New Zealand play their cricket. No fuss, no theatrics, just straight down to business.After playing three matches in Chennai and one in Ahmedabad, all on red-soil pitches, the Kiwis had only one training session to adapt to the conditions ahead of their first Super Eight match against Pakistan at the R Premadasa Stadium.None of them rushed towards the pitch for a closer look. Once warm-ups were done, the players moved to the indoor nets. About an hour later, Daryl Mitchell came out barefoot to inspect the surface, spending a good fifteen minutes studying every inch of the 22 yards.Chapman, who did not get to see the surface, left it to the senior leadership group.“In the subcontinent, the toss always plays a factor depending on the conditions.I haven’t seen the pitch yet, so I don’t actually know what it looks like. There will be discussions behind the scenes with the senior leadership group about what we want to do,” he said.The black-soil pitches in Colombo do assist spinners, and with bigger boundaries and a slower outfield, it presents a new challenge for the 2021 T20 World Cup finalists.“We haven’t played in Sri Lanka yet. A lot of guys in our team have played a lot of cricket here, so I don’t see that playing too much of a factor. Guys understand what they need to do, and we are confident we will face whatever conditions are in front of us,” said Chapman, whose knees were heavily strapped.“In India, particularly on red-soil pitches, conditions have been favourable for batting. It has been tough for the bowlers, and the margins have been very small. We have seen scores close to 200 regularly.“Here, it is slightly different with the slower nature of the pitches. The bowlers will hopefully get a chance to show their skills, and spinners are more likely to play a part here,” he added.Although Pakistan are stationed in Sri Lanka, they played their group matches at two different venues in Colombo.New Zealand will be the only team playing all their Super Eight matches at the same venue, facing Pakistan on February 21, Sri Lanka on February 25, and England on February 27, all at the R Premadasa Stadium.“One of the challenges in tournaments like these is hopping from venue to venue and adapting. When we play three games at the same place, we learn with each game.“It is nice to turn up at the same venue with similar pitches and adjust. Tomorrow is our first game here, so we will have to adapt anyway, but we will understand the conditions better as we go,” he said.New Zealand’s first challenge will be Pakistan’s spin-heavy attack. Usman Tariq, Abrar Ahmad, Mohammad Nawaz, Saim Ayub, and Shadab Khan form a strong unit.“Pakistan have a number of very good spinners, each with their own threat. We have played them quite frequently over the last few years.“We are well aware of what they will bring. For us, it is about being really clear in how we want to play against them,” he said.Obviously, there was a Usman Tariq question: “Usman Tariq has a unique action with the way he pauses at the crease, so that is something to factor in.""Chapman, whose role is to take on spinners in the middle overs, explained why running between the wickets will be crucial.“Given the slower pitch and bigger boundaries, you have to change your game plan. Against spinners, it is about different options like the sweep or reverse sweep. In India, you can target straight boundaries more.“For me, it is about finding different areas of the ground. There are big pockets here, so it is not all about sixes. Twos, fours, and running between the wickets are very important, especially if it is not a high-scoring game,” he said.New Zealand have suffered injury setbacks. Michael Bracewell has been ruled out of the remainder of the tournament after re-injuring his left calf. Captain Mitchell Santner missed the last group match against Canada due to illness, while Lockie Ferguson returned home for the birth of his first child.“Mitchell Santner looks pretty sprightly and excited to get back on the park, barring any last-minute illness.“Lockie has just returned and is coming off a long flight.

Luka Doncic owns up to his mistake after the game



The Los Angeles Lakers watched a winnable game slip away Tuesday night, falling 110-109 to the Orlando Magic after a final possession that unraveled in seconds. With 6.7 seconds left, Luka Doncic caught the inbounds pass from LeBron James and stood open beyond the three-point line. Instead of rising for the shot, he hesitated. It was very unlikely.The loss capped a blown 12-point second-half lead and marked the team’s first defeat this season when leading after three quarters. It also dropped Los Angeles to 4-4 on its eight-game homestand.Following the loss, LeBron James described the moment from his angle. ""Obviously, you have to ask Luka what he saw on that,"" James said. ""I thought he had a good look. I was kinda off-balance when he gave it to me, I thought he had a great look.""As the defense recovered, Doncic picked up his dribble and faced a quick double team. He sent the ball back to James with under three seconds remaining. Guarded closely, James launched a 27-foot fadeaway that missed.""Didn't have a rhythm with the ball, whatever the case may be. And it kind of allowed [Orlando's defense] to get back in front of him. And I was kind of off-balance when he gave it to me. I thought he had a great look.That's my POV,"" James added.Coach JJ Redick also commented on the move, ""We obviously ran a play for him to get a look,"" he said. ""I felt like he had a decent shot.""Doncic made a candid admission following the defeat and took full accountability. ""I know I was open, but I just thought I was a little bit far,"" Doncic said. ""Tried to take one dribble closer. And I probably shouldn't have picked up the ball and just tried to attack.""He finished 8-of-24 from the field and 2-of-10 from deep. When asked whether his earlier misses influenced him, he replied, ""Maybe a little bit.""The Slovenian guard went further. ""I mean, I just saw him open, and I didn't want to lose the ball,"" Doncic said. ""We didn't have timeouts. ... [But] I shouldn't have picked up the ball. I should have attacked. ... That's on me.""Orlando capitalized behind 36 points from Paolo Banchero and a late putback by Wendell Carter Jr. The Lakers now turn toward road games against the Phoenix Suns and Golden State Warriors.",The los angeles lakers lost 110-109 to the orlando magic on tuesday night.

Having approximately 25 games remaining, Florida needs to have consecutive performances to reduce the number of points in the Atlantic Division.In the meantime, the Buffalo Sabres are trying to break a decade-long franchise playoff drought. A midseason change of front office brought a new momentum, and the Sabres shot briefly into a wild-card position in an impressive winning streak.Nevertheless, the recent results of NHL matches indicate that there can be no room to be wasted, and more difficult matches with the best opponents are on the way.The two clubs are also keeping track of NHL trade rumors before the March deadline because they are aware that a strategic acquisition can boost the balance.
