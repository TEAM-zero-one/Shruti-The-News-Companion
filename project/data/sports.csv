NEW DELHI: In a moment that captured hearts across the cricketing world, 14-year-old Vaibhav Suryavanshi ’s dream IPL debut ended in tears -- literally.The Rajasthan Royals ’ prodigy, playing his first-ever IPL match at just 14 years and 28 days old, lit up the Jaipur evening with an audacious 34 off 20 balls before being stumped by Rishabh Pant off Aiden Markram’s crafty off-spin.Opening alongside the ever-aggressive Yashasvi Jaiswal , Vaibhav wasted no time announcing himself.A clean six off Shardul Thakur set the tone, followed by a breathtaking first-ball six off Avesh Khan in the next over, placing him on a rare list of players to hit a six on their first IPL delivery.The young left-hander showed both flair and nerves of steel, taking on international-quality bowlers with ease, and sharing a brisk opening stand with Jaiswal.But as cricket has it, glory and heartbreak often walk hand in hand. In the 9th over, trying to dance down the track and work the ball into the leg side, Vaibhav lost his balance and Pant, ever alert, whipped the bails off in a flash.The TV replay confirmed the inevitable: his back foot was in the air.What followed was a gut-wrenching scene: the teenager couldn’t hold back his emotions as he walked off the field, wiping away tears.Watch:Vaibhav Suryavanshi may have exited with tears, but he left the field having etched his name in IPL folklore.For Rajasthan Royals and Indian cricket fans, this isn’t just a debut. It appears to be the beginning of something extraordinary.","14-year-old vaibhav suryavanshi's dream ipl debut ended in tears -- literally.

From gridiron greatness to emotional vulnerability



When public image collides with private battles



Even the most successful athletes face challenges that stats and accolades can’t capture—and Tom Brady is no exception. Widely regarded as the greatest quarterback in NFL history , Brady's legendary career boasts an unmatched seven Super Bowl titles, yet behind the shine of championship rings lies a more vulnerable, human side he’s beginning to share with the world.For two decades, Tom Brady maintained a laser focus on football, becoming the ultimate symbol of discipline and competitive excellence. But recently, the 46-year-old has revealed glimpses of his personal struggles, particularly in the wake of his divorce from supermodel Gisele Bündchen . Brady, who is usually tight-lipped about his private life, opened up about the emotional toll of navigating heartbreak, admitting he’s dealt with moments of “willful blindness.”This phrase—suggesting a conscious decision to ignore uncomfortable truths—points to the complexities Brady faced in his marriage’s unraveling. While he didn’t name names, the context was unmistakable, especially given recent headlines surrounding Bündchen's ongoing relationship with her jiu-jitsu trainer, who is now widely rumored to be her partner and the father figure in her children’s lives.“Willful blindness” is not just a phrase—it’s a powerful acknowledgment of emotional compromise. Brady’s reflection reveals the cost of chasing perfection on the field while personal issues simmer in the background. The quarterback, once seemingly invincible both in his career and family life, now speaks like someone reckoning with the pain of being left behind. For fans, it’s a rare and raw admission: the GOAT is still just a man.The emotional fallout of watching Gisele Bündchen move on publicly is undoubtedly difficult for someone so accustomed to control and success. Reports of her being seen with her new partner and children add emotional weight to Brady’s recent comments, suggesting a sense of betrayal or at least loss.Also Read: Fresh discussion on Tom Brady and Gisele’s Bündchen’s marriage reignites debate over missed red flags Tom Brady’s recent openness signals a shift—not just for him but for the culture surrounding sports icons.

Bam Adebayo: The Ideal Frontcourt Upgrade

How Adebayo Fits with the Golden State Warriors

Thenarrowly escaped a Play-In disaster against the Memphis Grizzlies , securing the No. 7 seed in the Western Conference. But even with their postseason spot locked in, changes may be necessary this offseason—starting with moving on from Buddy Hield and pursuing Miami Heat star, as predicted by Caleb Hightower of Sporting News Buddy Hield’s early-season promise as a Klay Thompson replacement has faded. His three-point shooting, once reliable, has plummeted to concerning lows:- December: 30.5% from three- January: 31.5% from three- Play-In performance: 1-of-4 from deep against MemphisWhile Hield finished the regular season at 37.0% from beyond the arc, his inconsistency makes him a liability. As Caleb Hightower noted,If the Golden State Warriors exit the playoffs early, targeting Bam Adebayo in a trade could reshape their roster. The three-time All-Star has evolved into a complete two-way force:- 2024-25 Stats: 18.1 PPG, 9.6 RPG, 4.3 APG- Shooting Splits: 48.5% FG, 35.7% 3P- Versatility: Scores inside, handles the ball, and stretches the floorAdebayo’s growth from a defensive specialist to an offensive weapon addresses Golden State’s need for a dynamic big man.1. Scoring Boost: Provides interior scoring and mid-range efficiency.2. Playmaking: Adds a facilitator from the high post.3. Defensive Anchor: Complements Draymond Green’s versatility.The Trade ScenarioA Hield-Adebayo swap wouldn’t improve the Warriors’ outside shooting, but it would give them a proven All-Star to pair with Stephen Curry and Draymond Green. Miami, meanwhile, could benefit from Hield’s shooting if they retool their roster.Potential Trade Package- Warriors Receive: Bam Adebayo- Heat Receive: Buddy Hield, future draft picks, and/or young playersAlso read: NBA Offseason Rumors: Los Angeles predicted to acquire 6-foot-8 Brooklyn Nets forward to form Big 3 with LeBron James and Luka Doncic Although Golden State's urgency will depend on their postseason run, switching from Hield to Adebayo makes sense.

The first night of WrestleMania 41 was a night filled with top-class in-ring action, spectacular moments and a shocking end.WrestleMania 41 kicked off its first night in the Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas. The night saw new champions being crowned on the big stage, fast-paced in-ring showdowns, and memorable moments created. Moreover, the main event of WrestleMania 41 Night 1 saw a compelling showdown and ended with a shocker as Paul Heyman switched sides and joined with The Visionary, Seth Rollins This was the opening match between Jey Uso and Gunther for the World Heavyweight Championship.

NEW DELHI: Punjab Kings (PBKS) return home brimming with confidence after clinically dismantling Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) in a rain-shortened clash at the Chinnaswamy just two days ago. But as both sides gear up for the rematch in Match No. 37 of IPL 2025 at the Maharaja Yadavindra Singh International Cricket Stadium in New Chandigarh, the stakes are significantly higher.With five wins in eight matches, PBKS are sitting pretty in second place. Another win here would further solidify their playoff push. RCB, on the other hand, despite a strong start to the season, now find themselves slipping to fourth after back-to-back losses. They'll be desperate to stop the slide and regain momentum on what promises to be a spin-friendly track in Chandigarh.In Saturday’s 14-over rain-affected clash, PBKS executed their plans to perfection. Their bowlers, led by Marco Jansen (2/10), Yuzvendra Chahal, and Harpreet Brar, skittled RCB for just 95. Arshdeep Singh’s early double strike -- including the prized wicket of Virat Kohli -- set the tone.While RCB showed brief resistance through Tim David’s unbeaten 50, it wasn’t enough to mask a middle-order collapse. Punjab chased down the target with 11 balls to spare, thanks to a calm, match-winning knock from Nehal Wadhera, who remained unbeaten on 33 off 19.Wadhera, still new to IPL stardom, is now pushing for a regular middle-order spot -- especially with Shashank Singh and Josh Inglis yet to find form.RCB will want to brush off that defeat quickly, knowing they simply didn’t show up with the bat. Josh Hazlewood (3/14) and Bhuvneshwar Kumar (2/26) were bright spots with the ball, but RCB's batting fragility -- especially in the Powerplay -- has become a pattern.Phil Salt’s explosive starts haven’t lasted, while Kohli’s dismissal for just 1 in the last outing raised eyebrows. Captain Rajat Patidar is yet to truly stamp his authority, despite crossing 1000 IPL runs last game. They’ll hope Tim David can carry his late-innings form into a more prominent role.The big question for RCB is whether they stick with the same XI or ring in changes -- especially in spin, where PBKS clearly held the edge.The pitch in New Chandigarh is expected to play slow and low, especially in the second innings. Spinners have traditionally found grip here, making Harpreet Brar and Chahal crucial for Punjab. RCB, meanwhile, will likely rely on Suyash Sharma and Krunal Pandya to counter.If dew stays away in the evening, expect the toss to play a big role -- with both captains eyeing a chance to bowl first and exploit the early tackiness.The Maharaja Yadavindra Singh Stadium has favored spinners and slower bowlers this season. The dry surface tends to hold up, especially in the evening games, and scoring in the second innings hasn’t been easy. Anything above 160 could be competitive.Priyansh Arya, Prabhsimran Singh, Shreyas Iyer (c), Nehal Wadhera, Josh Inglis (wk), Marcus Stoinis, Shashank Singh, Marco Jansen, Harpreet Brar, Yuzvendra Chahal, Arshdeep SinghXavier BartlettPhil Salt, Virat Kohli, Devdutt Padikkal, Rajat Patidar (c), Liam Livingstone, Jitesh Sharma (wk), Tim David, Krunal Pandya, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Josh Hazlewood, Yash DayalSuyash SharmaA warm and dry evening is expected with temperatures hovering around 34°C at match time.

Sonya responded to her son’s latest accolade with a heartfelt note.As Seth Curry has secured the NBA’s three-point percentage crown, finishing the season as the league’s most efficient shooter from deep, his mother, Sonya Curry, reacted with a heartfelt gesture. “I’m so proud of you @sdotcurry !

Obviously, doing right by the Curry name.”Former NBA star and Seth's father Dell Curry was not keeping his thoughts on his son's achievements to himself. ""Seth Curry, aka SDot. Well, what can I say other than I'm proud of you. Your're my son my golfing buddy, but most importently, my friend. So, congratulations Number 30,"" he said.“Obviously, it’s not something I think about coming into the year or even throughout the year,” Seth said. “I’ve been in the top five a lot of times in my career, but I’ve never finished the year No. 1. It’s a testament to consistent work ethic and being ready. It’s a great accomplishment, something me and my dad have now, and Steph does not have. Yeah, it means a little bit something,” he continued.This season, Seth hit a career-high 45.6% from beyond the arc, knocking down 83 of his 182 attempts.“I think I check my numbers maybe two or three times a year. I’m just going out there, playing the right way, trying to lead this group on and off the floor. If I’m open, be aggressive, make plays, knock down shots. If I’m not, swing it to the open guy. For me, it’s just going out there, playing simple basketball, making my open shots, creating for my teammates and creating space when I can, make it easier on them. Just try to give confidence to the group.”Reflecting on his journey through a challenging season, Seth shared how constant communication with the coaching staff kept him mentally locked in. “The constant communication with coach was good,” he said, explaining how he stayed prepared despite fluctuating minutes. “My adaptability and being able to come in with a rhythm… that’s important,” Curry noted. “Come in, make shots right away – that’s important,” he added.Also Read: “Basketball Gods smiled down” – Magic Johnson sends clear message about NBA playoff matchups for fans Hornets Head Coach Charles Lee also reacted to Seth’s latest milestone. “Very excited for Seth,” Lee said adding, “It’s cool for our organization, but even cooler for him.

NEW DELHI: Saturday's IPL 2025 double-header served up two nail-biters, with Jos Buttler and Avesh Khan playing lead roles in contrasting fashion to guide Gujarat Titans and Lucknow Super Giants to memorable wins over Delhi Capitals and Rajasthan Royals, respectively.In Ahmedabad, Buttler weathered cramps and unleashed a blistering unbeaten 97 off 54 balls to steer Gujarat Titans to a seven-wicket victory over Delhi Capitals.Chasing 204, GT overcame early hiccups with Shubman Gill and B Sai Sudharsan departing early, but Buttler anchored the chase alongside Sherfane Rutherford (43), the pair adding a match-turning 119-run stand for the third wicket.Buttler’s knock was a masterclass in timing and power; he famously took apart Mitchell Starc for five consecutive boundaries in the 15th over, blending classical strokeplay with brute efficiency.Despite missing out on a hundred, Buttler ensured the chase ended with four balls to spare as Rahul Tewatia finished things in style.Earlier, Prasidh Krishna’s 4/41 helped restrict DC to 203/8 despite fighting knocks from Axar Patel (39) and Ashutosh Sharma (37 off 19).In Jaipur, Avesh Khan delivered under extreme pressure, defending nine runs in the final over as Lucknow Super Giants eked out a two-run win against Rajasthan Royals.RR, chasing 181, were coasting at 156/2 in 17 overs with a blazing Yashasvi Jaiswal (74) and 14-year-old debutant Vaibhav Suryavanshi (34) setting the tone.But Avesh’s deadly 18th over, removing Jaiswal and Riyan Parag, turned the game on its head.With nine needed off the final six, Avesh dismissed Shimron Hetmyer and conceded just six runs, finishing with 3/37 and sealing a heist win for LSG.Earlier, Aiden Markram (66) and Ayush Badoni (50) helped LSG post a competitive 180/5, with Abdul Samad’s 10-ball 30 lifting them past 175.The wins saw Gujarat Titans climb to the top of the table, while Lucknow Super Giants revived their campaign with a gritty, last-over triumph that will be talked about for days.",Gujarat titans beat delhi capitals by seven wickets in ipl 2025.

Rangers fire Head Coach, but front office missteps fuel deeper crisis



In a move that’s more scapegoat than solution, the New York Rangers fired head coach Peter Laviolette on Saturday and with it, tried to wash their hands of one of the most embarrassing collapses in recent franchise history. After a record-setting 2022-23 season, the Rangers didn’t just miss the playoffs in 2024, they imploded. And rather than admit the problem runs deeper than the bench, GM Chris Drury seems content pinning it all on the coaching staff.Let’s call it what it is: the Rangers' issues didn’t start or end with Peter Laviolette. Yes, the team underperformed. Yes, their power play was abysmal. But to act like the man behind the bench is the root of the problem is a convenient narrative that protects the real culprits, the ones in suits, not skates.Drury’s roster decisions were puzzling all season long. Trading captain Jacob Trouba mid-season raised eyebrows. Shipping off Kaapo Kakko and Filip Chytil while shuffling in new faces like J.T. Miller and Carson Soucy only added to the instability. And let’s not forget the March deadline moves that felt more like desperation than direction. The chemistry never clicked because the pieces kept changing and that’s not on Laviolette.Worse yet, the Rangers are now part of a not-so-proud club, one of only four teams in NHL history to win the Presidents’ Trophy and miss the playoffs the very next season. That’s not just a stumble. That’s a structural failure.Still, Drury insists his job is safe and that “it starts with me.” But if it truly started with him, he wouldn’t be dodging questions about ownership’s confidence. He wouldn’t be pushing the narrative that a new coach, whether it’s a recycled NHL name or an unproven college upstart, is the magic fix.Also Read: Penguins duo Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin set rivalry aside, celebrate Alex Ovechkin’s historic goal record with Rolex gift And where does this leave the locker room? A rotating door of coaches, a confused roster, and now a fanbase expected to trust that the next hire will right the ship. The truth is, the Rangers' problems won’t be solved with a new face behind the bench. Until the front office owns up to its missteps, New York is chasing shadows.The Rangers didn’t just fire Laviolette. They lit the fuse on a bigger crisis.","New york rangers fire head coach peter laviolette after collapse. Gm chris drury seems content pinning it all on the coaching staff.

NEW DELHI: Anaya Bangar , daughter of former India cricketer and coach Sanjay Bangar , has spoken out about the toxic masculinity that continues to plague the cricketing world. In a candid interview, Anaya revealed disturbing experiences she has faced within the cricketing circle, including receiving nude photos from cricketers, verbal abuse, and being propositioned by a former player.Anaya, who publicly came out last year and shared her journey of transformation through hormone replacement therapy and gender-affirming surgery , was formerly known as Aryan. She followed in her father’s footsteps, playing age-group cricket in India. However, she said the journey after transitioning came with many challenges.“There has been support and there have been some harassment as well,” Anaya said during an interview with Lallantop, reflecting on her journey.When asked how fellow cricketers responded after her gender-affirming surgery, Anaya said: “There have been a few cricketers who randomly sent me nude pictures of them.”She also shared more distressing experiences:“The person used to give gaalis in front of everybody. The same person then used to come and sit beside me and ask for my photos. There was another instance, when I was in India, I told a puraane (veteran) cricketer about my situation. He told me let’s go in the car, I want to sleep with you.”Having played alongside prominent Indian cricketers like Musheer Khan, Sarfaraz Khan, and Yashasvi Jaiswal during her early years, Anaya said she was forced to keep her identity hidden because of her father’s public profile.“I had to maintain secrecy about myself because dad is a well known figure. Cricket world is filled with insecurity and toxic masculinity,” she added.Anaya has represented Islam Gymkhana in Mumbai’s club circuit and also played for Hinckley Cricket Club in Leicestershire, UK.However, her cricketing ambitions faced a major setback in November 2023, when the International Cricket Council (ICC) introduced a new policy barring transgender women from participating in international women’s cricket.“Inclusivity is incredibly important to us as a sport, but our priority was to protect the integrity of the international women’s game and the safety of players,” then-ICC CEO Geoff Allardice had said.Anaya responded to the policy with a detailed post on Instagram, expressing her disappointment with the decision.She currently resides in the United Kingdom.",Anaya bangar is the daughter of former india cricketer and coach sanjay bangar.

Finally, the moment everyone had been waiting for arrived—the main event of the night: a colossal Triple Threat match featuring Seth Rollins Roman Reigns , and CM Punk .All three superstars made electrifying entrances, but it was CM Punk’s that truly stole the spotlight. Walking in alongside Paul Heyman, Punk's entrance marked the first time in years that Roman Reigns entered a match alone—without his ""Wiseman"" by his side.As the bell rang, Punk immediately rolled out of the ring, mocking Reigns by chatting with Heyman about both Roman and Seth.

Without wasting a second, Reigns lashed out and struck Rollins.Roman began asserting dominance, unleashing a number of strikes on both Punk and Rollins. But Rollins quickly recovered, launching a suicide dive onto Reigns at ringside and throwing him into the steel steps.The action spilled into the crowd, with Punk and Rollins brawling fiercely.

updates

Pune: Koneru Humpy and Batkhuyag Munguntuul of Mongolia faced off for the first time in 1999 during the World U-12 girls’ championship. Five of the other eight players from the ongoing FIDE Women’s Grand Prix here were not even born at that time.Humpy, 38, used all her experience to take the game to unknown territory and scored a full point against Munguntuul in the sixth round by sacrificing material for the winning advantage on Sunday.With Zhu Jiner avenging her World Blitz meet defeat to R Vaishali , Humpy could not join the Chinese as the joint leader. But with 98% accuracy in the win with black pieces, she won’t be short on confidence. Zhu retained sole leadership on five points followed by Humpy on 4.5 points with three rounds to go.Humpy will play with white pieces against Zhu in a potential decider in the seventh round on Monday. Humpy took her game to the Ulvestad Variation (Two Knights in Italian opening) with a pawn push on the fifth move -- a variation not to be found in the database of both players.Though Munguntuul did not fall for the gambit, her Qf3 --threatening a Mate in 1 –appeared out of her depth; and the subsequent play indicated that she was probably not familiar with the structure. Humpy co-ordinated her pieces and launched a deadly kingside attack against the castled king, punishing the earlier Qf3.She had castled her own king on the opposite side and then moved it to b8 and guarded it against any attack. With pawns marching ahead in ‘e’, ‘f’ and ‘g’ files and double rooks on the ‘h’ file with queen on g6, it looked lost for the Mongolian. Humpy gave away two rooks for the rival queen and activated her knight and bishop.The potent pawns had done the damage by exposing the white king. It was Munguntuul’s sixth decisive and fourth defeat. Zhu Jiner had lost a four-game quarterfinal to Vaishali in the World Blitz in New York in Dec. But the Chinese won a complicated endgame against the Indian on Sunday involving mutual and multiple inaccuracies around the 20th move of the Sicilian Rossolimo.When the dust settled, Zhu was a knight-up in the queen and pawns endgame.","Humpy, 38, used all her experience to take the game to unknown territory.

It was ‘win some, miss some’ for Indian shooters on Saturday night in Lima. While Arjun Babuta won silver, the gold was missed by a mere 0.1 points in the men’s 10m air rifle event at the World Cup in Peru’s capital.On the other hand, in the same final, Buenos Aires gold medallist and former World Champion shooter Rudrankksh Patil crashed from fourth position to last after his rifle misfired due to a malfunction. Later, on Sunday, Rudrankksh Patil kept the disappointment aside and regrouped with Arya Borse to win silver in the 10m air rifle mixed event.The Indian pair lost the gold medal match to Norway’s Jeanette Duestad Hegg and Jon-Hermann Hegg 17-11. Babuta was ahead of the eventual gold medallist Sheng Lihao of China from the 10th shot onwards. The Paris Olympics participant shot high 10s to stay ahead of the Games’ double gold medallist.The Indian maintained the lead till the 22nd shot, but Lihao then shot a 10.9 and 10.3 to surge ahead, while Babuta shot 10.3 and 10.5 to lose by 0.1 point. Babuta scored 252.3, while Lihao took gold with 252.4. The silver went to Istvan Peni of Hungary with 229.8. “I had been struggling in the finals for a long time.I wasn’t keeping the scores throughout the match and was trying to focus only on my shots,” he later told TOI. Babuta added that losing the gold by 0.1 point didn’t matter in the end. “I had been finishing fourth (including Paris) since many finals, so a silver was a good deal. I am not losing my sleep over the missed gold. I think I must cherish the silver and work with more confidence for other tournaments,” he added.Meanwhile, for Patil, his journey ended after the 10th shot, which was fired inadvertently. As he tried to take position, his rifle fired a shot after amalfunction. The jury at the range registered the shot and since the pellet didn’t hit the target, he got zero.At that point, Patil was at fourth position and looked poised to climb up with 10.8 and 10.6 off his last two shots. The misfire gave his 11th shot a zero and the Indian didn’t shoot the 12th shot as it was redundant with him dropping to the eighth position in the eight-man final.",Arjun babuta won silver in the men’s 10m air rifle event at the world cup in peru.

Will Colin Kaepernick return in 2025? His girlfriend’s update sparks hope among fans,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/will-colin-kaepernick-return-in-2025-his-girlfriends-update-sparks-hope-among-fans/articleshow/120469488.cms,"Colin Kaepernick refuses to quit—his 2025 NFL return hopes get a new update

Colin Kaepernick is still chasing an NFL comeback dream, and 2025 could finally be the year



Colin Kaepernick may have been absent from an NFL roster since the 2016 season, but his passion for football hasn't cooled — not even slightly. The former San Francisco 49ers quarterback, who ignited global conversations through his protest against racial injustice, continues to train rigorously in hopes of reigniting his NFL career. Now 37, Kaepernick’s unwavering determination and athletic discipline show that his desire to return is not rooted in nostalgia — it’s rooted in belief.According to longtime partner Nessa Diab, Colin Kaepernick is still going all in. “He’s training all day, every day,” she told TMZ Sports, before adding, “it’s all up to the teams if they’ll let him [play].” This commitment isn’t for publicity or pity — it’s preparation. Despite the passing years and relentless rejections, Kaepernick hasn't moved on from football. He’s simply waiting for football to move back toward him.Kaepernick’s last official NFL game was played on January 1, 2017, where he threw for 215 yards and a touchdown against the Seattle Seahawks. Since then, teams have stayed silent. While he had a workout with the Las Vegas Raiders in May 2022, it didn’t result in a contract. In 2023, following Aaron Rodgers’ Achilles injury, Kaepernick even reached out to the New York Jets, proposing a spot on their practice squad as a “risk-free contingency plan.”“Worst case scenario, you see what I have to offer and you’re not that impressed,” he wrote in a letter to Jets GM Joe Douglas. “Best case scenario, you realize you have a real weapon at your disposal… I would wear that responsibility like a badge of honor.” Yet again, the call never came.And when Jim Harbaugh — his former 49ers coach — publicly suggested they discussed a possible coaching role with the Chargers in 2024, Kaepernick denied the claim with clarity and humor. “I found out the same way everyone else did — on social media,” he said on The Tonight Show. “No, no coaching offer.”Kaepernick has also addressed the public perception that time has dulled his athletic ability. In a 2023 Sports Illustrated interview, he emphasized, “I looked forward to being judged by talent, not political bias.” He still stands firm in his belief that kneeling during the national anthem for racial justice led to him being blackballed — not his performance.There’s no doubt Kaepernick’s stats back up his case. With 12,271 career passing yards, 72 touchdowns, and just 30 interceptions, he remains one of the more efficient quarterbacks in recent league history. He also led the 49ers to a Super Bowl appearance in 2014 — an achievement not easily forgotten by San Francisco fans. His 69-58 regular-season record speaks to his consistency and competitiveness.But what truly sets Kaepernick apart is that he’s no longer just a quarterback — he’s a symbol. A symbol of resistance, courage, and conviction. Very few athletes have sacrificed as much for a cause they believe in. And even fewer have kept training for nearly a decade without the guarantee of another shot.In a league where injuries are constant and quarterback depth is always tested, it’s not far-fetched to believe that a door could still open. Every offseason and midseason shake-up sparks speculation, and each year, the question quietly resurfaces: Will Colin Kaepernick get the call?His journey is far from over. Whether the ending includes a triumphant return to the field or simply the recognition of a career unfairly interrupted, Kaepernick’s story continues to matter — not just to fans, but to history.Until that call comes, Colin Kaepernick remains prepared — training daily, driven by both talent and purpose. And the NFL world is still watching.Also Read: “Nothing Good Happens After 12 o’clock at night”: How Bill Belichick’s advice helped Rob Gronkowski tame the party animal within","Colin kaepernick has been absent from an nfl roster since the 2016 season.
