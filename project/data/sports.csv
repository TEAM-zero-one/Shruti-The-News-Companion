India and Australia are set to face each other in the Champions Trophy semi-final in Dubai on Tuesday, with India looking to overcome their historical struggles against Australia in knockout matches.Australia, despite missing key players Pat Cummins, Josh Hazlewood, and Mitchell Starc, recently demonstrated their resilience by successfully chasing 352 runs against England in Lahore.India's last victory against Australia in an ICC knockout match was in the 2011 World Cup quarter-final. Since then, India have lost to Australia in the 2015 ODI World Cup semifinals, 2023 ODI World Cup final, and the 2023 World Test Championship final.The Indian team's strategy of including five spinners in their squad, initially criticised, has proven effective on Dubai's slow pitches.India's advantage stems from their experience playing all matches in Dubai and their ability to adapt their bowling approach to local conditions.The Indian spin quartet of Varun Chakravarthy, Kuldeep Yadav, Ravindra Jadeja, and Axar Patel claimed nine New Zealand wickets on Sunday, bowling 128 dot balls in 39 overs.Australia's spinning options are limited to Adam Zampa as their primary spinner, with Glenn Maxwell and Travis Head serving as part-time options.Matthew Short's withdrawal due to a calf injury has further reduced Australia's spinning alternatives.The Australian bowling unit has struggled recently, conceding 352 runs against England and 273 against Afghanistan.Australia's batting strength remains formidable, as evidenced by their recent successful chase of over 350 runs without significant contributions from Travis Head and Steve Smith. India will be particularly focused on dismissing Head early, given his recent success against them.The match presents an opportunity for India to overcome their recent loss to Australia in the 2023 World Cup final in Ahmedabad.The ICC Champions Trophy match between India and Australia will take place on Tuesday, March 4.The ICC Champions Trophy match between India and Australia will be played at Dubai International Stadium.The ICC Champions Trophy match between India and Australia is scheduled to begin at 2:30pm IST, with the toss at 2:00pm IST.The ICC Champions Trophy match between India and Australia will be broadcast on Star Sports Network and live-streamed on JioHotstar.The India vs Australia match will begin at 1pm in Dubai.Viewers in the USA can watch the upcoming India vs Australia Champions Trophy match on Fubo TV.Canadian cricket fans can access the crucial Group A encounter between India vs Australia through Fubo TV's service.You can follow live updates of the ICC Champions Trophy match between India and Australia on TimesofIndia.com.Rohit Sharma (c), Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer, KL Rahul, Rishabh Pant, Hardik Pandya, Axar Patel, Washington Sundar, Kuldeep Yadav, Harshit Rana, Mohd.

'Being attacked for no reason'

BJP’s hits back

NEW DELHI: Congress spokesperson Shama Mohamed on late Sunday questioned the leadership of Indian men's national cricket team captain Rohit Sharma . Reacting to India's match against New Zealand in the ongoing Champions Trophy, Shama labelled Rohit ""fat"" and called him a ""mediocre captain"".""Rohit Sharma is fat for a sportsman! Needs to lose weight! And of course, the most unimpressive captain India has ever had!"" the Congress spokesperson wrote in a social media post. After facing backlash, the Congress leader deleted her post.She went further in another post, questioning Sharma’s abilities compared to past cricketing legends. ""What is so world-class about him when compared to his predecessors like Ganguly, Tendulkar, Dravid, Dhoni, Kohli, Kapil Dev, Shastri & the rest? He is a mediocre captain as well as a mediocre player who got lucky to be the captain of India.""Following the backlash, Shama defended her remarks questioning Rohit's decision to promote himself to the opening spot during India's Test match against Australia, a match that the Men in Blue ultimately lost.""Didn't he move KL Rahul to bat at number 3 at the MCG Test & put himself at number 1 which backfired totally ! Wasn't that a selfish move ? Because of that Shubam Gill was out of the XI . Didn't we lose the last World Cup which took place in Ahmedabad? I have compared him to our previous captains,"" she wrote in another post.Speaking to the news agency ANI, Shama clarified that her remarks were ""generic"" and were not intended to shame the captain of the Indian men's cricket team. Further defending her comments, she said that, in her opinion, ""sportspersons should be fit,"" and added that she was being ""attacked for no reason"" over her statements.""It was a generic tweet about the fitness of a sportsperson. It was not body-shaming. I always believed a sportsperson should be fit, and I felt he was a bit overweight, so I just tweeted about that,"" she said.""I have been attacked for no reason. When I compared him with previous captains, I put in a statement. I have the right. What is wrong in saying? It is a democracy,"" she added.BJP’s Shehzad Poonawalla was quick to respond, taking a dig at the Congress party's electoral failures. ""Those who have lost 90 elections under the captaincy of Rahul Gandhi are calling the captaincy of Rohit Sharma unimpressive!"" he remarked.Poonawalla also defended Sharma’s track record, referencing his recent achievements. ""I guess six ducks in Delhi and 90 election losses is impressive, but winning the T20 World Cup isn’t! Rohit has a brilliant track record as captain, by the way!""Meanwhile, on the field, India secured a crucial victory over New Zealand, winning by 44 runs to top Group A. Shreyas Iyer’s composed 79 and Varun Chakravarthy’s five-wicket haul helped India set up a semifinal clash against Australia in the Champions Trophy.","Congress spokesperson shama mohamed questioned the leadership of indian men's national cricket team captain rohit sharma.

Oscars 2025: Host Conan O'Brien gives Adam Sandler a hard time over his choice of outfit

Timothée Chalamet and Adam Sandler: A Knicks Bromance at the Oscars



“Chalamet!”

The 97th Academy Awards, hosted by Conan O’Brien, had all the usual glitz and glamour. Hollywood’s elite showed up in their finest, the red carpet brimming with designer gowns and sharp tuxedos. But then there was Adam Sandler , who, true to form, looked more ready for a pickup game than a black-tie event. In a sea of polished looks, Sandler’s laid-back vibe and unapologetic Knicks fandom were a refreshing twist, proving yet again why he’s one of Hollywood’s most relatable stars. Adam Sandler ’s love for the New York Knicks is no Hollywood act. He’s a real fan—the kind who can be spotted courtside at Madison Square Garden or shooting hoops at a neighborhood park. His passion for basketball is woven into his work, from his gritty role into his love letter to the sport in. And at the Oscars, he didn’t switch gears. He showed up in a teal Aviator Nation sweatshirt, baggy purple shorts, andCurry 11 sneakers—basically, classic Sandler.Host Conan O’Brien couldn’t resist ribbing him for it:he quipped, earning a big laugh from the audience.Sandler, as unbothered as ever, played along:he shot back, mock-offended and grinning.And of course, the Knicks love didn’t end with his outfit. At one point, Sandler even invited everyone to a midnight basketball game at Veteran Park. It was peak Sandler—equal parts comedy and genuine offer. He’s the kind of guy who might actually show up, sneakers in hand, ready to shoot around with whoever took him seriously.One of the night’s best moments came when Sandler spotted fellow Knicks fan Timothée Chalamet . Their friendship, built on a shared love of basketball, has been brewing for a while. Back in 2023, they even played a casual pickup game together. At the Oscars, Sandler’s loudshout across the room and the bear hug that followed were as real as it gets—just two guys, more pumped about hoops than Hollywood.Chalamet, always a fashion wildcard, showed up in a bold yellow suit. But when Sandler wrapped him in that hug, he could have just as easily been back in New York, two fans geeking out after a game. It was a raw, unfiltered moment in a night often built on polished performances—a reminder that, behind all the Hollywood magic, genuine friendships and real fandoms still thrive.Also Read: NBA fines Ja Morant $25K for tossing ball into stands during Memphis Grizzlies’ loss to New York Knicks Adam Sandler didn’t need to take home a trophy to steal the show at the 2025 Oscars. He brought humor, heart, and a slice of New York realness to the ceremony. In a room full of stars, his mix of casual charm and die-hard Knicks loyalty was a breath of fresh air. It wasn’t just the jokes or the outfit—it was the feeling that if you bumped into him on the street, he’d be the exact same guy. And that’s what made Sandler’s presence at the Oscars feel like a win—for him and for anyone who’s ever loved a team as much as he loves the Knicks.","Adam sandler’s laid-back vibe and unapologetic knicks fandom were a refreshing twist.

Edmonton Oilers Eye Game-Changing Trades Amid Playoff Race,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/edmonton-oilers-eye-game-changing-trades-amid-playoff-race/articleshow/118712248.cms,"Images Via Getty Images

Alex Tuch: Edmonton’s Potential Game-Changer in Trade Talks

Shaking Ground with Evander Kane and Stuart Skinner

Although the Edmonton Oilers broke their five-game losing streak, the pressure to qualify for the playoffs is still high. On the verge of the NHL trade deadline , the team is exploring possible transactions to improve their lineup. The front office will likely make bold moves towards the playoffs supporting Connor McDavid as a leader on the ice. The coming few days could change everything for this team and their playoff path.While speaking of potential trades for the Oilers, Branden Escott alluded to this point: “I think [the #Oilers] are looking for a forward with speed and size…a D too…it’s dollar in, dollar out, but if they can create some cap room, we’ll see what else can happen here.” According to this statement, there is an ongoing rumor that a possible target for the Oilers might be Buffalo Sabres forward Alex Tuch.The forward leader for the Buffalo Sabres, Alex Tuch, has now risen to be possibly the hot commodity for trade relationships between the Oilers and the rest of the NHL. The 27-year-old winger has 22 goals and 24 assists in 58 games this year. His speed, size, and offensive prowess make him a perfect mix to go with either McDavid or Draisaitl. In another piece of a moving puzzle, Tuch has a history with the skinniest Oilers winger Jeff Skinner from their time together in Buffalo that could reunite.But making this move is going to be hard. Tuch, in fact, is in the final season of his seven-year deal, and the Oilers had to clear cap room to fit him in. If that were to happen, though, that could signal the type of playoff spark they were looking for.While some new names are likely to make their way onto the Oilers' roster, others are rumored to be on borrowed time. In fact, according to reports, the team is said to be exploring potential trading options for Evander Kane, who is dangling despite having a no-trade clause. He is one of the names said to be called into the new center. His injuries this season have not helped, meaning the Oilers have one of their tough decisions ahead of them.Another name circulating in the rumor mill is goaltender Stuart Skinner. Recent erratic performances have opened up the gates to Calvin Pickard, who came up big in a stellar performance versus the Hurricanes. Trading Skinner could clear up needed cap space for other Oilers' moves, allowing them to add both forwards and defensemen.Also Read: Are the Anaheim Ducks actually in the mix for Mikko Rantanen, or is this just deadline noise? The playoff lights are on, and the Oilers are at a crossroads. Connor McDavid's saber comments suggest either his disappointment or his hope that management will make the right moves. Be it Alex Tuch, Brock Nelson, or someone to fill the gap in defense, the Oilers have to act swiftly and efficiently to strengthen their lineup. The next couple of days might end up being a playoff decider, if not one that makes history- if not for the Oilers, then surely for playoff hockey. All eyes are on the Oilers now with the deadlines fast approaching, as fans pray for that piece that will finally tip the balance and allow Edmonton into a deep postseason run.","The edmonton oilers broke their five-game losing streak, but the pressure to qualify for the playoffs is still high.

Taylor Swift is reportedly coming under more pressure to keep her personal life separate from her professional image. Some, according to insiders, think that her very public romance with Travis Kelce might be having a detrimental impact on her reputation. The debate was heightened after she received boos at the Super Bowl—a moment that some waved off as friendly ribbing, while others interpreted it as a sign that her involvement in the NFL universe isn't welcomed by everyone.Taylor Swift is said to be increasingly being urged to keep her personal and professional brands separate. Sources claim that certain advisers of hers are of the view that her celebrity romance with Travis Kelce might be damaging her carefully crafted persona.Disapproval mounted after she was booed at the Super Bowl, but others interpreted as definitive proof that her growing presence within the NFL community isn't for everyone. Since Swift is arguably one of the most powerful entities in the music industry, a few insiders fret that her visibility with the world of sports would bring unnecessary turmoil to her profession.At the same time, Travis Kelce is also receiving flak, especially from fans of the Kansas City Chiefs questioning if his priorities on football have been diluted. His disappointing outing in the last game of the season against the Philadelphia Eagles only added fuel to the fire, with some of them positing that his life outside the football field, including his relationship with Swift, might be affecting his performance.Once regarded as an untouchable leader on the field, Travis Kelce is now under scrutiny for possibly letting distractions interfere with his play. Since the couple continues to be in the spotlight, both Swift and Kelce find themselves at the center of discussions regarding whether their romanceTaylor Swift and Travis Kelce, formerly the epitome of power couples connecting music and sport, now face a reversal of public perception that could be hard to discount. Rumors of a possible wedding later in the year only served to heighten debate, with some industry sources warning that cross-pollinating their brands to such an extent might prove to have unforeseen effects. With their relationship making up-page news every day, the test is to keep their romance alive while keeping their respective careers intact.“This whole situation is creating a weird tension between her and Travis, especially since this is their first real bump in the road,” a source told Radar Online. “Until now, it’s been nothing but good times! You can only imagine the awkward discussions happening behind the scenes about when it’s appropriate for them to be seen together and how they’re supposed to act. Definitely not the romantic vibe they were hoping for!”Also Read: Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce losing their popularity as Super Bowl loss shifts spotlight away Taylor Swift has been pulled into a surprise legal battle with her close friends Blake Lively, Ryan Reynolds, and former co-star of Lively's Justin Baldoni. Court papers indicate that Baldoni was pressured when Lively mentioned Swift and Reynolds as her ""dragons"" in a creative dispute over the It Ends With Us movie.Although Taylor Swift was reportedly not involved, her perceived power was being used as leverage. Fed up with the unwanted connection, she perceives it as a possible threat to her image. Consequently, part of the insiders is now calling on her to distance herself from Lively, just as she's being advised to do regarding her affair with Travis Kelce.",Taylor swift is said to be increasingly being urged to keep her personal and professional brands separate.

NBA drama just hit a gut-wrenching plot twist. Forget reality TV feuds, this is a real-life sports soap opera, and it’s got us all reaching for the tissues. Imagine if a Marvel movie villain, say, a Thanos-level front office, decided to snap their fingers and erase all the good vibes. Well, that’s basically the Dallas Mavericks ’ season. And just when you thought the script couldn’t get any darker, Kyrie Irving goes down.In a moment that felt like a sports equivalent of a Red Wedding scene, Irving tore his ACL against the Kings, effectively writing him out of this season's narrative and likely a hefty chunk of the next. It’s a tragic pause button on what was shaping up to be a redemption arc worthy of a Rocky Balboa montage. But amidst the wreckage, a beacon of brotherhood shines through. Luka Doncic , the Slovenian sensation who’s basically the NBA’s equivalent of a perpetually online meme lord, took to Instagram to send a message of support. ""You will come back stronger mi hermano,"" Doncic posted, a simple yet powerful declaration of solidarity. Forget the trade rumors, forget the questionable roster decisions; this is pure, unadulterated sportsmanship, a moment that reminds us that even in the cutthroat world of professional basketball, human connections matter.ALSO READ: Did Luka Doncic Just Pull Off the Pettiest Delay of Game Ever? Here’s What Happened And let’s not forget, Irving was balling out. Before the injury, he was reminding everyone why he’s a walking highlight reel, a maestro of the hardwood. An All-Star return, nearly 25 points a night, and keeping the Mavericks ’ playoff dreams flickering like a neon sign in a Texas dust storm, he was doing it all. He was like the protagonist in a sports anime, finally unlocking his true potential, only to be sidelined by a cruel twist of fate. Now, his road to recovery will be long and arduous, a real-life training montage. But with friends like Doncic in his corner, and the unwavering support of fans, Irving will undoubtedly write his own comeback story.","Kyrie irving tore his acl against the kings.

Billy Bowman Jr. is the defensive answer NFL needs



Billy Bowman Jr. 🔥 Most Versatile Safety In College Football ᴴᴰ

Mahomes makes magic out of nothing, Hurts steamrolls through defenders, and defenses? They’re left scrambling for answers. But Bowman is built differently. The 22-year-old Oklahoma safety turned heads at the 2025 NFL Combine, proving he’s a game-changer. His mission in the NFL is crystal clear: suffocate offenses, shut down playmakers, and make quarterbacks think twice before testing him. The league has been warned.Patrick Mahomes and Jalen Hurts have a way of making even the best defenses look helpless. Dial up the perfect blitz, and Mahomes still manages an impossible sidearm pass while falling to the ground. Try to bring down Hurts? He brushes off defenders like they’re nothing and keeps moving. The result? Defenses try, they fail, and the cycle repeats.Honestly, at some point, defenses need to hit back. With the NFL Draft around the corner, fresh talent is ready to step up, and one name is already creating serious buzz: Billy Bowman Jr.The 22-year-old safety out of Oklahoma made a statement at the 2025 NFL Scouting Combine, showing he’s built to be a game-changer. His mission for his rookie season? Shut down offenses before they even get started. “I want to suffocate offenses,” Bowman said during the combine. “Offense is easy to play. You know your play. You know where the ball is going. All you got to do is get the ball, make somebody miss.” (via: EssentiallySports)In his mind, offense is predictable, but defense? That’s where the real challenge lies. “Defense, it brings so much more of a challenge,” he added. So it’s so much more fun. But my goal is just to suffocate offenses. I don’t want to give them nothing. I want to hold them to zero to 3. When the ball is in the air, it’s mine. If they hand the ball off, I want to rally to the ball as quick as possible. My mentality is suffocation.”And Bowman backed it up on the field. Over 47 games at Oklahoma, he posted 199 tackles, 10 tackles for loss, 11 interceptions, and 14 pass deflections. If the ball was in play, he was in the mix.Bowman’s “suffocate offenses” mindset isn’t just talk, it’s how he plays. His dominance at Oklahoma and a standout NFL Combine performance proved he’s built to shut down opposing attacks. Now, as a top Buffalo Bills prospect, he’s ready to bring that same relentless energy to the pros.Also Read: Eagles restructure secondary, part ways with James Bradberry The Buffalo Bills are entering the 2025 season with a mix of highs and hard lessons. Josh Allen just had a career-best season, capping it off with his first MVP title. But on the flip side, their AFC Championship loss to the Chiefs (yet again) still stings. To bounce back, bolstering the roster is a must and they’re already on it.One key focus? The safety position. With Jordan Poyer and Micah Hyde gone, the Bills need reinforcements, and Billy Bowman Jr. is emerging as a strong contender. Despite being overlooked in the draft process, he’s proven his potential, clocking a 4.42 40-yard dash, recording a 10’3″ broad jump, and hitting 17 reps at 225 pounds. However, his 5’9”, 192-pound frame raises concerns.NFL.com’s Chad Reuter praised his performance, noting his fluid movement and strong catching ability in drills. With the draft approaching, all signs point to Buffalo eyeing a safety and Bowman could be their guy.","Billy bowman jr. turned heads at the 2025 nfl combine.

Auston Matthews, one of the most talented players in the NHL and the captain of the Toronto Maple Leafs, has been in the centre of controversy as fans believe he has not been able to perform well in this season. Recently, hosts of Sportsnet’s Leafs Talk, JD Bunkis and Sam McKee, discussed about Auston Matthews’ performance, and fans have certain opinions about it.In the recent episode of Sportsnet’s Leafs Talk, JD Bunkis says, “The big thing for me in this game…a big takeaway..there is just something about Matthews’ body language that’s not there for me this year”. His co-host, Sam McKee, seems to agree with this and says, “Yeah we talk about this a lot…I’m out of theories”.JD Bunkis then does acknowledge how Auston Matthews is injured and that might play a big role in his “poor performance” this season but he also questions the reason for Auston Matthews to be playing if “he is that injured”.JD Bunkis says, “...the aura is not the same” and it seems like fans agree with this opinion.A fan wrote, “Body language is horrible. Showed up Nylander twice when he didn’t feed him on the PP. He’s barely bending his knees while skating and he’s just stick checking instead of taking the body. If this is what we’re gonna get come April, see you on the golf course May 8th.”Another fan wrote, “Look at all the different guesses in this thread as to what’s wrong with him. Could it be that we are seeing the decline of Matthews and it’s happening faster than we imagined? I really hope it’s just an off year but my guess is it’s not. He’s definitely a shell of himself.”A third fan wrote, “The only difference from this year to last year is him wearing the C. Is his attention being pulled in too many directions that he has no time to think about the game? Is he checked out because he scored 69 goals last year but fans still shit on him for the playoff outcome?”Recently, the Toronto Maple Leafs suffered a devastating loss against the San Jose Sharks and are now gearing up for a match against the Vegas Golden Knights. Auston Matthews has not addressed all the speculations around him.Also Read: Auston Matthews' words for J.T.

Seth Jones made an electrifying debut for the Florida Panthers , instantly proving why he was a key trade acquisition. While he impressed on the ice, the bigger question looms; when will star forward Matthew Tkachuk return to action? As the Panthers push forward without one of their biggest playmakers, Jones’ arrival couldn’t have come at a better time.In his debut, Jones logged nearly 23 minutes of ice time and came close to netting a goal in the Panthers’ hard-fought 2-1 victory over their in-state rival, the Tampa Bay Lightning .“He’s an unbelievable skater, a great guy,” said goaltender Sergei Bobrovsky, who made 28 saves to help extend Florida’s winning streak to four games. ""Played well both sides of the puck. I'm excited to have him. He's a great addition to our team.""While Jones made an immediate impact, the Panthers confirmed earlier Monday that Tkachuk has been placed on long-term injured reserve due to a lower-body injury. That means Florida’s star forward will be sidelined for several weeks, possibly until the postseason.""Matthew's going to be out for an extended period of time,"" Panthers general manager and president of hockey operations Bill Zito said at Jones’ introductory press conference. ""We hope to get him back for the playoffs. You have a projection, you have a diagnosis and a rehab course of action. How and where and in what manner is the progress of that rehab is yet to be determined."" (via: ESPN)Tkachuk’s absence is a tough setback for the Panthers, but the addition of Jones, an elite defenseman acquired in a weekend trade with the Chicago Blackhawks, brings a much-needed boost.""I wanted to play for a contender and Florida was obviously at the top of my list when it came to that,"" said Jones, who hasn't appeared in a playoff game since 2020. ""I want to fit in with this team, be a part of the system, come and bring my game, play hard defensively, help a little bit offensively, really just fit into the system and bring what I can, whatever's asked of me.""Panthers fans embraced Jones before he even hit the ice, giving him a roaring ovation when he was introduced in the starting lineup at Amerant Bank Arena. The excitement only grew when he nearly scored in the second period.Initially, the plan was to ease Jones into the lineup as he adjusted to a new system and conference. But in a heated matchup against a bitter rival, he found himself in key moments, particularly on special teams, helping Florida successfully kill off seven penalties.“He’s going to be really good for us,” head coach Paul Maurice said. ""Moves the puck clean, and he's got a set of hands on him. So I thought for flying in yesterday to get here, and then everything [being] brand new, mostly he's playing on instinct out there. ... I was really pleased.""""He still was amazing,"" Bobrovsky said. ""And, you know, he was an amazing skater. He was smart. It was a privilege to play with him. And I'm so, so happy to reunite with him again.""The Panthers also made another move between the pipes. With Spencer Knight sent to Chicago in the Jones trade, Florida recalled veteran goaltender Chris Driedger from their AHL affiliate. The 30-year-old brings NHL experience, including 31 career wins, and now serves as Bobrovsky’s backup moving forward.",Seth jones made his debut for the florida panthers against the tampa bay lightning.

The Philadelphia Eagles are making major changes to their secondary, signaling a shift in their defensive approach. According to multiple reports, the team is releasing veteran cornerback James Bradberry. The move comes after a disappointing 2024 season, during which Bradberry was sidelined due to injury. Now fully recovered, the 31-year-old is eager to return to the field in 2025. Meanwhile, more changes in the Eagles' defensive backfield appear to be on the horizon.Bradberry will be designated as a post-June 1 release, a decision that will save the Eagles $2.1 million in cap space for the 2025 season. The veteran corner suffered a torn Achilles during a preseason practice, forcing him to miss the entire 2024 campaign. Despite this setback, Bradberry recently confirmed that he has fully recovered and is determined to play cornerback next season.Before his injury, Bradberry was a key figure in Philadelphia’s defense. In 2023, he played a pivotal role in the secondary, recording 13 passes defensed, one interception, and a fumble recovery while starting all 16 games. His experience and skill set made him a valuable asset, but with the Eagles looking to retool their roster, the decision was made to move on.Bradberry isn’t the only veteran defensive back on his way out. Reports from Monday indicate that longtime cornerback Darius Slay is also expected to be released in the coming days. Slay has been a cornerstone of the Eagles' secondary since joining the team in 2020, and his potential departure further underscores Philadelphia’s commitment to reshaping its defense.The Eagles’ secondary struggled at times during the 2023 season, and injuries played a major role in the unit’s inconsistency. Now, the front office appears focused on revamping the defensive backfield with younger, fresher talent. With free agency and the 2025 NFL Draft approaching, Philadelphia will likely target new additions to fill the void left by Bradberry and Slay.Also Read: Throwback: When Charissa Thompson took a bold stand on marriage and motherhood and how Kylie Kelce reacted With two experienced cornerbacks potentially leaving, the Eagles must find reliable replacements to maintain competitiveness in 2025.
