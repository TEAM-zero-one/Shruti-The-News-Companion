Cleveland Browns share heartfelt post featuring Shedeur Sanders and Todd Monken

Life changing moments have nothing to do with football

Can’t wait to see the video when Todd Monken meets Myles Garrett

There are two sides to the NFL quarterback position. Cleveland Browns longtime signal-caller Deshaun Watson, who arrived in a blockbuster trade sending Baker Mayfield to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, reportedly revealed he was baptized in Israel.Sports media personality Dov Kleiman shared on X that Watson said the experience was life changing. “I am truly in awe of this wonderful land and the wonderful people who live here.” Kleiman also wrote, “Deshaun is a devout Christian [red heart and folded hands emojis].”Now, the other side of an NFL field general. The Browns’ official X account shared a heartwarming post of QB Shedeur Sanders meeting their new head coach, Todd Monken, who was previously the Baltimore Ravens offensive coordinator and worked with Lamar Jackson and others.Cleveland captions it: “it all worked out.”Monken and Sanders shake hands, then the coach pulls the signal-caller’s shoulder and says, “Hey, we tried to draft your [---] last year for God’s sake! It all worked out. You remember that right?” Sanders chuckles and responds, “That’s what I was about to tell you…” Monken shares, “Someday we’ll get a chance to talk about that.”In Sept. 2025, ESPN’s Adam Schefter reported that the Ravens planned to pick Shedeur Sanders in the fifth round with the No.141 pick. League sources told the NFL Insider that Sanders did not want to play alongside Lamar Jackson because he would not have a chance to play soon.Is that why he chose Cleveland? A veteran like Deshaun Watson was recovering, rookie Dillon Gabriel was on the roster, veteran Joe Flacco was playing, and Super Bowl LIX winner Kenny Pickett was traded from the Philadelphia Eagles to the Browns. Maybe. Just speculation.Anyway, how did cybercitizens react to Watson’s baptism picture and Sanders’ union with a former Baltimore coordinator? Let’s find out.“Nothing wrong with making this move in your life. It’s never too late,” wrote one X user for Watson. Another wrote a wholesome comment for the playmaker, “Whatever people think about him on the field, moments like this are personal.Faith journeys are not about headlines or teams, they are about meaning and perspective. If this experience gave Deshaun Watson peace or clarity, that matters to him. Sometimes life changing moments have nothing to do with football at all.”A third user wrote, ""A true role model. I wouldn't want my kids looking up to anybody else."" A fourth user said, ""His past may not be forgotten but it can be forgiven."" A fifth user chimed in, ""He's about to get his starting job back.""Watson did not play a single game in his 2025 campaign. And Kleiman reportedly shared a photo of Watson’s baptism from June 2019.ABC13 Houston reported at the time that Watson was in Israel for a week on a trip sponsored by the nonprofit group America’s Voices. While on the trip, he was baptized in the Jordan River.Watson said in a statement then: “This is a part of the world which gets a lot of attention internationally, and this is a chance for me to look beyond the headlines and learn more about the history and culture of this land.I have been blessed to visit many countries around the world, but the chance to visit the Holy Land, see the sites and meet the people of this special place, truly is a special blessing and an amazing opportunity.”Coming to Deion Sanders’ son: “I’ve never seen a backup QB get this kind of treatment,” wrote one X user after seeing a special video of backup QB Shedeur Sanders meeting the franchise’s new head coach.Another user was waiting for a video featuring Cleveland’s star defensive end Myles Garrett: “Can’t wait to see the video when he meets Myles.”A third user spoke for the 23-year-old Colorado Buffaloes former standout QB: “Its clear coach cant wait to work with Shedeur. Say what you want, but Sanders was part of why Monken wanted to come here. That aside this interaction is hilarious [laughing face emojis].”","Deshaun watson reportedly revealed he was baptized in israel.

Olympic boxing legend MC Mary Kom has released a clarification video after her recent remarks sparked backlash on social media. In the video, the six-time world champion apologised to those who felt hurt, saying her comments were misunderstood and taken out of context.She stressed that she never intended to offend anyone, create division, or promote negative thinking.Mary Kom addressed speculation around her personal life, particularly her marriage and divorce from Karung Onkholer (Onler).She clarified that her marriage was not a failure from the beginning, explaining that things were stable for many years before trust eventually broke down.She also rejected claims that she was against football, youth culture, or the sporting fraternity.Although a boxer, Mary said she loves football and respects athletes who rise from the grassroots through discipline and hard work.She cited icons like Sunil Chhetri and Baichung Bhutia as examples and apologised to anyone, especially men, who felt targeted by her words, clarifying that her remarks were never meant to generalise or insult.Watch the full video here:Earlier, her divorce had triggered public allegations from both sides.Speaking on Aap Ki Adalat, Mary accused Onler of financial fraud, claiming he lived off her earnings, withdrew Rs 10 lakh without consent, and transferred properties worth crores into his name.“I did not cheat him. He cheated me financially,” she had said.Onler denied the allegations and countered with claims of extramarital affairs, alleging long-standing relationships and saying he had proof.“Firstly, in 2013, she was having an affair with a junior boxer. Our families had a fight, and after that, we compromised. And since 2017, she’s been having a relationship with someone working at the Mary Kom Boxing Academy. I have their WhatsApp messages as proof. I have proof, with the name of the person with whom she was having an affair. I remained silent. She wanted to stay alone and have another relationship,"" he later replied.""We’re divorced. I don’t mind if she wants to have another husband. But don’t ever blame me. And if she’s to blame me, bring the proof; get the papers. I know where she lives and with whom.”","Olympic boxing legend mary kom has released a clarification video after her recent remarks sparked backlash on social media.

There is always backdoor diplomacy. In 24 hours, anything is possible. Rashid Latif | Former Pakistan captain

Poll Should Pakistan proceed with their boycott of the T20 World Cup match against India? Yes, it's a strategic move. No, they should play as planned.

Pakistan will not play their group-stage match against India at the T20 World Cup on February 15, the Pakistan government announced in a social media post on Sunday. However, clearance has been granted for the tournament, which begins on February 7. Pakistan will play all their matches in Sri Lanka, and not India, as per terms agreed between the two neighbours in 2024.Former Pakistan captain Rashid Latif, in an exclusive interview with TimesofIndia.com, has offered a blunt assessment, saying Pakistan’s boycott of the India clash is a calculated move aimed squarely at the ICC’s financial and governance structure.Latif links the escalation to Bangladesh’s removal from the tournament, the shifting political climate in South Asia, and the enormous financial stakes attached to India-Pakistan cricket.“Till now, everything was going well. Pakistan and India both agreed that we would play in a hybrid model for the next three years. The Asia Cup happened in Dubai. Pakistan’s women’s team played in Sri Lanka in the Women’s ODI World Cup. Everything was going well, but things have changed since the Bangladesh episode happened,” says Latif from Islamabad.After Bangladesh unsuccessfully sought to shift its matches from India to Sri Lanka over security concerns, Pakistan began protesting the decision.In a show of support for the Bangladesh Cricket Board, Pakistan voted in favour of the request at the ICC board meeting, with chairman Mohsin Naqvi even threatening a boycott. When Bangladesh ultimately declined to play in India, they were replaced by Scotland.“Pakistan is standing with Bangladesh. It was not like this in the past,” Latif says.Despite Pakistan’s recent struggles on the field, Latif argues that their importance to global cricket remains undiminished. India-Pakistan matches, he says, are the engine that drives World Cup viewership.“Whether it is in India or Pakistan, 60–70 percent of people watch the World Cup because of India-Pakistan matches,” he says.Latif points out that even matches involving Australia draw packed stadiums, but when India and Pakistan are both involved, the scale is unmatched. Viewership runs into the millions, sponsorship valuations spike, and broadcasters plan entire commercial strategies around these fixtures.In case Pakistan do not take the field against India on February 15, they will lose two points, and there could be sanctions from the ICC as well.Latif claims that Pakistan’s move is not aimed at India directly, but at the ICC itself.“This decision is not on India. It is hitting the ICC directly,” he says.“Pakistan generally don’t take such decisions. The PCB is not even scared of sanctions. It will have a big impact. There is a Women’s T20 World Cup in England this year, and Pakistan might play India there as well. Then there is a Champions Trophy in 2028, hosted by India. So this will not end here. It seems that Pakistan has taken this step after a lot of thought,” he says.Latif dismissed the idea that Pakistan is worried about sanctions. He says that if Bangladesh had acted alone, punitive measures might have followed. With Pakistan involved, the equation changes dramatically.“Now that Pakistan has joined, it will impact Australia and England financially as well,” he explains.The ripple effect would not stop at one tournament. The ACC calendar, future Asia Cups, and even ICC events would feel the strain. Latif estimates the India-Pakistan cricket economy as a billion-dollar business across formats and tournaments.“The businessmen are above our governments,” he says bluntly. “Now the game has gone out of their hands.”Latif places significant faith in the power of broadcasters. He believes they will not allow a prolonged standoff that threatens their investments.“You know how powerful broadcasters are. They will find some solution,” he says.Drawing parallels with how previous Asia Cup deadlocks were resolved, Latif suggests similar behind-the-scenes negotiations are inevitable for the World Cup. Without compromise, he warns, the consequences could be disastrous for world cricket.“If not, then it is a disaster for world cricket,” he adds.Teams opting not to play matches is not unprecedented in ICC tournaments. At the 1996 World Cup, Australia and the West Indies declined to travel to Sri Lanka over security concerns. In the 2003 edition, England refused to face Zimbabwe for political reasons, while New Zealand did not travel to Nairobi for their group match against Kenya.However, Latif does not rule out a reversal of stance. “There is always backdoor diplomacy,” he says.With Pakistan taking nearly a week to arrive at this position, Latif believes the timing has been carefully calculated. The Australia series has just ended, both teams are set to travel to Colombo, and the spotlight is firmly on the ICC.“In 24 hours, anything is possible,” he concludes.","Former pakistan captain rashid latif says india-pakistan matches account for the majority of world cup viewership.

The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), in solidarity with Bangladesh's ouster from the upcoming T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka, has decided not to play their group league game against India in Colombo on February 15. The decision has been taken despite the PCB holding a binding contract with the ICC and the BCCI on playing matches on neutral soil.The Pakistani government did however clear its national team to compete in the tournament which gets underway on February 7. Pakistan are due to play Netherlands in the tournament opener at the Sinhalese Sports Club Cricket Ground in Colombo.""The government of Pakistan grants approval to the Pakistan cricket team to participate in the Twenty20 World Cup, however, the Pakistan team shall not take the field in the match scheduled on 15th February against India,"" a Pakistan government release said.Here is a timeline of events that led to Pakistan's decision:The BCCI instructed Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) to release Mustafizur Rahman, who the franchise had aquired in the IPL mini-auction. The decision came due to deteriorating relations between India and Bangladesh.Bangladesh ordered that broadcast of IPL season be stopped in the country. Further, BCB declared that if a single player was considered a ""security liability"" then the entire team's safety could be at risk.BCB formally wrote to the ICC and asked for relocation of their T20 World Cup matches from India to Sri Lanka. The BCB suggested a ""hybrid model"", similar to the 2023 Asia Cup.ICC Board votes against moving Bangladesh matches. The 14-2 decision saw only Pakistan coming out in support of Bangladesh. ICC maintained that an independent security assessment found ""no credible threat"" to players in India. They also gave Bangladesh a 24-hour deadline to confirm their travel.At a meeting that took place at a hotel in Dhaka between the national squad, BCB officials, and Youth and Sports Adviser Asif Nazrul, Bangladesh stuck to their decision and decided against travelling to India for the T20 World Cup.With Bangladesh deciding against playing the T20 World Cup matches in India, ICC formally replaced them with Scotland in Group C.After Bangladesh were removed from the T20 World Cup, PCB chairman Mohsin Naqvi said a final decision on their participation would be taken after talking to Pakistan's government.""Our stance [on World Cup participation] will be what the government of Pakistan instructs me,"" he said. ""The Prime Minister is not in Pakistan right now. When he returns, I'll be able to give you our final decision. It's the government's decision. We obey them, not the ICC.""Naqvi met with Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to discuss the situation. ""Had a productive meeting with the Prime Minister ... Shehbaz Sharif,"" Naqvi tweeted. ""Briefed him on the ICC matter, and he directed that we resolve it while keeping all options on the table. It was agreed that the final decision [on participation] will be taken either on Friday or next Monday.""Mohsin Naqvi and Pakistan PM Nawaz Sharif meet for the second time in a week in Lahore. The government cleared the national team to compete in the T20 World Cup but stopped them from playing arch-rivals and tournament co-hosts India on February 15.",Pakistan cricket team will not play india in the group stage of the t20 world cup.

Carlos Alcaraz conquers Melbourne to complete historic career Grand Slam,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/tennis/top-stories/carlos-alcaraz-conquers-melbourne-to-complete-historic-career-grand-slam/articleshow/127845730.cms,"Carlos Alcaraz (Photo by Darrian Traynor/Getty Images)

Melbourne:

When Carlos Alcaraz fell back onto the Rod Laver Arena after just over three hours in the middle, he lay motionless for a while, stunned by the moment, caught between disbelief and the sudden weight of what he had achieved.The world No. 1 had just halted Novak Djokovic , the 24-time major champion, 2-6, 6-2, 6-3, 7-5 to lift the Norman Brookes Challenge Cup for the first time, continuing his relentless rewriting of the record books. At 22 years and 272 days, the Australian Open crown made Alcaraz the youngest man in history to complete a career Grand Slam.The path to the title, however, had been anything but smooth. Alcaraz arrived in Melbourne after a turbulent period, facing criticism at home and across the tennis world following his split from long-time coach Juan Carlos Ferrero in December, a backdrop that made the scale and composure of his triumph all the more striking.“Nobody knows better than my team how hard I've been working to get this trophy,” Alcaraz said of his seventh major title. “Pre-season was a bit of a rollercoaster emotionally. We did the right work, you pushed me every day to do the right things and I'm really grateful for everyone in my corner. This trophy is also yours.”Some 12 minutes into the match, Alcaraz unveiled his first drop shot, a clear signal of intent. He wanted to move Djokovic, to probe the older man’s legs early.Two minutes later in the fourth game, he saved the first break point he faced with another feathered drop shot. Djokovic, dragged around the court like a pawn in a carefully constructed board game, responded in the only way he knew how, with precision and patience, breaking on his third opportunity to move ahead 3-1.If Alcaraz arrived with a plan for the sport’s great symbol of longevity, Djokovic leaned on placement and control, closing out the opening set in just 33 minutes.Rod Laver Arena was captivated, and for the first time in his young career, Alcaraz, with Spanish legend Rafael Nadal cheering him on, sensed that the crowd’s volume tilted decisively toward his opponent. As he tried to accelerate the tempo in the second set, a tactic that played into Djokovic’s hands, the Spaniard muttered toward his box in search of answers. He eventually eased off the throttle, returning to variation and movement, and broke in the third game.As the sun dipped over Melbourne Park, Djokovic retreated further behind the baseline and on the scoreboard.The roof over Rod Laver Arena was only partially open on the coldest day of the fortnight, with temperatures peaking at just 20 degrees. Strong winds swept through Melbourne’s sporting precinct, blowing between 11.2 and 20.1 mph, with gusts reaching up to 29 mph, adding an unpredictable edge to the contest.The ten-time Australian Open champion left the court at the end of the second set, and as the roof began inching closer, Alcaraz got on his feet, protesting to the chair umpire. He did well not to let it distract him, carrying the momentum into the third, threatening in Djokovic’s opening service games before breaking in the fifth when the Serb’s crosscourt forehand drifted wide, igniting the Spanish contingent. Moments later, when the top seed emerged on top of a geometrical exchange of acute angles and the stands erupted, it was clear the world No. 1 had seized control.Djokovic called for the doctor at the end of the third set, gesturing toward what appeared to be acid reflux. Yet, just as the contest seemed to be slipping away, he produced one last stand, saving six break points from 15-40 in the second game with sheer resolve. Buoyed by the crowd inside Rod Laver Arena and thousands more braving the biting cold outside, the 38-year-old traded shot for shot with a younger, fresher opponent. The resistance held until the 12th game, when Alcaraz finally wrapped it up.A pivotal subplot in Sunday’s final was the serve. Alcaraz claimed 77 percent of the points on his first serve, while Djokovic, who saved 11 of 16 break points he faced in the match, only managed 66 percent.Alcaraz’s conscious effort to make that shot more efficient saw him borrow elements from Djokovic’s action and work on it in the off-season. Rather than chasing raw pace, the 22-year-old has actioned a cleaner, more repeatable motion, with the focus on disguise and placement over outright power. The influence is clear in how he now protects his service games under pressure, using variation and accuracy to set up his first forehand. For a player who stands at 6 feet, the shortest among the modern-day greats — Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer are both an inch taller than Alcaraz, while Djokovic is 6 ft 2 and Jannik Sinner at 6 ft 3 is significantly taller — this evolution is crucial.In a final against the very model he’s studied, it became a fascinating measure of how effectively the student had absorbed the master’s lessons.",Carlos alcaraz beats novak djokovic to win the norman brookes challenge cup. World no. 1 beats serb 2-6 6-2 6-3 7-5 at rod laver arena in melbourne. Spaniard is youngest man in history to complete a career grand slam. He split from long-time coach juan carlos ferrero in december.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127845883,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-98544,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"

Why Terence Crawford’s reaction sparked such strong fan backlash

Terence Crawford found himself at the center of backlash after celebrating Shakur Stevenson’s biggest career win in a way many fans felt crossed the line. Stevenson defeated Teofimo Lopez in a 12-round fight at Madison Square Garden to become the new light welterweight champion, a result that marked a major step forward in his career. While the focus should have stayed on Stevenson’s achievement, Crawford’s post-fight actions quickly became a talking point. Crawford, who mentored Stevenson and stood in his corner during the fight, reacted emotionally as the decision was announced. He filmed himself shouting and celebrating while aiming taunts toward Team Lopez inside the ring.The moment was caught on camera and spread rapidly across social media.Instead of being praised, the retired champion's behavior was seen as bad sportsmanship by his fans. Several fans noted Lopez had just lost a tough match on a big stage. They argued that mocking a defeated fighter took attention away from Stevenson’s disciplined performance and historic title win. Some fans also noted Crawford’s status as an all-time great, saying his actions carried extra weight because younger fighters look to him as an example.The criticism grew louder because Crawford is known for his calm personality inside and outside the ring. Throughout his career, he built a reputation for letting his performances speak for themselves. That made his animated celebration stand out even more. Fans who admired his usual composure expressed disappointment, saying they expected better from someone with his legacy. The tension was not entirely unexpected. Crawford and Teofimo Lopez, along with Lopez’s father, had exchanged words in the buildup to the fight. Those earlier confrontations added emotion to the night and may have influenced Crawford’s reaction once Stevenson won. Still, many fans felt that personal history was not a good reason to mock a fighter after a loss.The relationship between Crawford and Stevenson has been praised by some who saw Crawford's reaction as one of pride that a successful fighter had been mentored. There are often strong feelings after championship bouts where, in addition to the intensity of the competition itself, it can take many years of hard work and loyalty to achieve this type of success. Ultimately, the most significant accomplishment from that night was Stevenson's winning fight. Stevenson boxed very well for twelve rounds to defeat Lopez and won a title in a new division, further solidifying himself as one of boxing's best fighters. While Crawford's behavior has drawn much criticism, it likely will be viewed as an isolated incident rather than a permanent representation of his character. The attention will now be focused back on Stevenson and what this victory means for the future of the division.",Terence crawford was criticized for mocking teofimo lopez after shakur stevenson’s career-defining win.

Minnesota Timberwovels vs Memphis Grizzlies Game expectation (January 31, 2026)

The Minnesota Timberwolves face the Memphis Grizzlies on January 31, 2026, in a Western Conference matchup between two teams managing several injuries. Even with players unavailable on both sides, the game features enough proven talent to remain competitive.Minnesota comes in with the stronger record and a healthier core group. Memphis, meanwhile, continues to adjust its rotations because of long-term injuries. The difference in styles is clear and that is the Timberwolves rely on size and interior defense, while the Grizzlies depend heavily on guard play and pace.Minnesota is missing a few rotation players, but most of its main contributors are expected to play.• Terrence Shannon Jr. (SG) - Left foot abductor hallucis strain; expected to miss significant time.• Enrique Freeman (G-League two-way) - Ruled out without a specific designation.• Rocco Zikarsky (G-League two-way) - Also listed out on the official report.• Mike Conley (PG) - Back spasms; status depends on pregame evaluation.• Leonard Miller (F) - Dealing with back issues and could see limited minutes if active.Anthony Edwards, Rudy Gobert, and Julius Randle are all expected to suit up.If Conley is cleared, Minnesota keeps a noticeable advantage in size and overall balance.Memphis Grizzlies have dealt with injuries throughout the season, particularly in the frontcourt.• Zach Edey (C) - Stress reaction in the left ankle; no clear return date.• Brandon Clarke (F) - Grade 2 right calf strain; projected return in four to six weeks.• Ty Jerome (SG) - High-grade right calf strain; out indefinitely.• Vince Williams Jr. (SG) - Left knee soreness; not expected to play.• Santi Aldama (F) - Knee issue; often plays with managed minutes.The Grizzlies are expected to rely on Ja Morant, Jaren Jackson Jr., and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope. Younger players such as Jaylen Wells and Scotty Pippen Jr. could take on larger roles depending on lineup needs.Minnesota has a slight edge in the all-time series and has performed better in recent matchups.The teams have already met once this season. Minnesota won a close game behind a 30-point effort from Anthony Edwards and a double-double from Rudy Gobert. The result reflected how the Timberwolves’ interior presence can slow Memphis’ preferred tempo.Minnesota sits in the upper half of the Western Conference with consistent production on both ends of the floor.• Anthony Edwards - About 28.9 points per game; primary scorer.• Rudy Gobert - Roughly 11.4 rebounds per game; anchors the defense.• Julius Randle - Around 5.7 assists per game; key facilitator.Minnesota’s defense remains one of its strengths. Gobert protects the rim, while Jaden McDaniels adds length on the perimeter.Memphis has slipped in the standings compared to last season, largely because of injuries and roster turnover.• Ja Morant - Drives the offense with transition scoring and pick-and-roll play.• Jaren Jackson Jr. - Provides shooting range and shot-blocking.The Grizzlies can still defend effectively when healthy, but injuries to Edey, Clarke, and Aldama have reduced frontcourt depth and contributed to more second-chance points for opponents.Gobert and Randle give Minnesota a strong presence inside. Memphis may have to rely more on outside shooting if it struggles to score in the paint.If Edwards and Donte DiVincenzo convert from long range, Memphis’ defense will need to stretch, which could open driving lanes.Memphis prefers a faster pace led by Morant. Minnesota may try to slow the game, especially if Conley is available to run the offense.• Edwards, Gobert, and Randle remain dependable fantasy options.• Conley carries some risk because of his questionable status but offers value if he plays.• Morant and Jackson Jr. remain top choices.• Caldwell-Pope and Wells gain importance if injuries lead to increased minutes.The matchup projects as physical with a moderate pace. Minnesota’s defense could influence the scoring level, particularly if the Timberwolves have their full backcourt. Minnesota enters the game as the more complete team and holds a slight health advantage. If Mike Conley plays, the Timberwolves should be in a strong position to control rebounding and tempo.Memphis will depend on Morant’s scoring and Jackson Jr.’s two-way impact to stay within reach. The contrast between Minnesota’s interior defense and Memphis’ guard-driven offense should keep the contest competitive.","The minnesota timberwolves face the memphis grizzlies on january 31, 2026.

Boston’s position entering the matchup

Important stretch ahead for the Milwaukee Bucks

for theagainst the Boston Celtics on. He has been ruled out with a right calf strain and carries an official “Out” status on the team’s injury report for the game at TD Garden.His absence comes at a challenging time for Milwaukee. Matchups against conference contenders often affect playoff positioning, and losing a player who shapes both the offense and defense forces the Bucks to adjust their approach.The injury also changes the tone of the game. Without their most reliable scorer and defender, Milwaukee must depend more on its rotation players while facing a Boston team that has continued to win even while managing injuries.The league’s injury report lists Giannis Antetokounmpo as out because of a right calf strain. Team updates confirm he will not suit up. Kevin Porter Jr. is also out with an oblique strain, and Taurean Prince will miss the game due to a neck issue.Gary Harris is listed as probable with left hamstring discomfort, making him the only key player not fully cleared but still expected to play.Giannis Antetokounmpo suffered the calf strain late in a January 23 loss to the Denver Nuggets.He left the floor in the final seconds after limping, and an MRI later confirmed the injury.He said the recovery could take four to six weeks, which would likely keep him sidelined until at least mid- to late-February and past the February 5 trade deadline. Head coach Doc Rivers has said there is no set timetable for a return, adding that the team is being careful to avoid another calf problem. That approach is why he remains out, even with an important game on the schedule.Giannis Antetokounmpo averages more than 30 points, 10 rebounds, and six assists this season. His ability to attack the paint draws defenders and creates open looks for teammates. With him unavailable, Milwaukee is expected to rely more on Bobby Portis, Ryan Rollins, and the backcourt of Damian Lillard and Malik Beasley to handle the scoring.Player prop lines reflect the expected increase in responsibility. Rollins’ scoring line is around 20.5 points, while Portis is near 17.5. The defensive gap may be just as important. Antetokounmpo protects the rim and can guard multiple positions, something that is difficult to replace. If Milwaukee’s perimeter defense slips, Boston’s shooters could benefit.Boston has most of its main rotation available, though Jayson Tatum remains out with a long-term Achilles injury. Even without him, the Celtics have continued to produce results. Against a Milwaukee frontcourt missing its anchor, Boston can focus on rebounding, pushing the pace, and targeting mismatches when possible.For Milwaukee, the game becomes a test of whether the supporting cast can stay competitive against one of the conference’s stronger teams.If Giannis Antetokounmpo misses another month, Milwaukee will have to manage a portion of the season without its central player. Each win matters as teams position themselves for the playoffs. The organization’s priority is clear: do not rush him back. Protecting his long-term health matters more than short-term results, especially with the postseason still ahead.Also read: Milwaukee Bucks vs Boston Celtics injury report: Who's playing, injured and questionable players, head-to-head records, team stats, and more (February 1, 2026) For now, the answer is simple.

Rob Gronkowski, Bruce Arians on Belichick Snub, Super Bowl Ad



From cancer survivor to Super Bowl champion

Raising awareness beyond football

Former Tampa Bay Buccaneers head coach Bruce Arians is preparing for another major health battle. The 73-year-old Super Bowl winner revealed that he will undergo open-heart surgery on February 6, just days before the NFL’s biggest game.Arians shared the update during an appearance on NBC’s Today show, where he joined former tight end Rob Gronkowski to promote a Super Bowl commercial focused on prostate cancer awareness. While discussing the campaign, Arians briefly mentioned his upcoming procedure, adding that he plans to watch the Super Bowl from his hospital room.The news has prompted an outpouring of support from fans and former players alike.Arians’ health challenges are not new. He was first diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2007 while serving as offensive coordinator for the Pittsburgh Steelers. Thanks to early detection, he successfully underwent surgery. In 2013, he had cancerous cells removed from his nose, and in 2016, while coaching the Arizona Cardinals, doctors discovered a small cancerous spot on his kidney, which required surgery.Those hospital visits came during a demanding coaching stretch that also included treatment for diverticulitis and chest pain.Despite repeated health scares, Arians continued coaching at the highest level, eventually reaching the pinnacle of the sport.He took the Buccaneers to Super Bowl LV in 2020, when they beat the Kansas City Chiefs. Tampa Bay won 31-9 with Tom Brady at quarterback and a strong defense on the greatest stage. Arians became the franchise's winningest coach and then resigned in 2022, saying he was worried about his health. He then became a senior football consultant.Beyond football, Arians has consistently used his platform to promote cancer screenings and early detection. In his book The Quarterback Whisperer, he wrote about the importance of cherishing life and serving as a “beacon of hope” for others battling cancer.His latest public appearance alongside Gronkowski was centered around raising awareness about prostate cancer screenings, a cause deeply personal to him. Even as he prepares for open-heart surgery, Arians continues to advocate for health education and prevention.There has been no information released about the exact nature of the procedure. But those who have followed Arians' journey may be sure that he is strong and will get through this.","Bruce arians, 73, will undergo open-heart surgery on february 6.

T20 World Cup: Squads, Full Schedule, Venues and Key Details Explained

PCB may have to pay the broadcasters

NEW DELHI: The upcoming ICC T20 World Cup is set to suffer a big jolt with the Pakistan govt on Sunday announcing that its cricket team will boycott its league match against India in Colombo on February 15. While Pakistan govt didn’t provide any reason for the move, Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Mohsin Naqvi had warned of drastic steps after Bangladesh was replaced with Scotland on January 24.The International Cricket Council (ICC) reacted sharply to development, stating: “ICC hopes PCB will consider the significant and long-term implications for cricket in its own country as this is likely to impact the global cricket ecosystem, which it is itself a member and beneficiary of.”“The ICC notes the statement that the govt of Pakistan has made regarding the decision to instruct its national team to selectively participate in the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2026. While the ICC awaits official communication from the Pakistan Cricket Board, this position of selective participation is difficult to reconcile with the fundamental premise of a global sporting event where all qualified teams are expected to compete on equal terms per the event schedule,” an ICC statement said.Sources told TOI that ICC could contemplate expelling Pakistan from the World Cup and future ICC tournaments if the PCB goes ahead with boycotting the scheduled match against India.The govt of Pakistan’s official handle posted the decision on X. “The Government of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan grants approval to the Pakistan cricket team to participate in the ICC World T20 2026, how- ever, the Pakistan Cricket Team shall not take the field in the match scheduled on 15th February 2026 against In- dia,” the post read.It needs to be seen what Pakistan’s stance will be if they are drawn with India for the tournament semifinal. If the match doesn’t happen, broadcasters and the sponsors will incur enormous losses as the fixture has generated a major chunk of revenue from ICC tournaments over the last decade, as diplomatic relationship between the two countries froze. For the match to be forfeited in favour of India, the Indian team must be at the ground at the time of toss. According to ICC’s playing conditions, Pakistan will lose two points from the match and their net run rate will also take a hit. India and Pakistan are in Group A with USA, Namibia and Netherlands. Two teams from the group will qualify for the Super 8 stage.Over the last decade, ICC tournaments have always been guaranteed of at least one India-Pakistan match in the group stages. Each match has broken viewership records.Despite PCB struggling to generate revenue, it gets the fourth highest share of ICC’s annual revenue based on the revenue generated through India-Pakistan matches. PCB currently gets $34.5 million annually from ICC. Sources said ICC could penalise PCB by asking them to financially compensate for the loss of revenue from this match. The world body also mulls denying giving out No Objection Certificates to players across the globe to participate in the Pakistan Super League If ICC decides to compensate broadcasters from PCB’s annual share of ICC revenue, then PCB could stand to lose around 70-80% of $34.5 million that they currently receive from ICC.

Delhi Capitals followed up a clinical bowling display with a nervy, error-strewn chase to secure a 5-wicket win over UP Warriorz and book a place in the Eliminator at the BCA Stadium in Vadodara. After restricting Warriorz to a modest 122, Capitals appeared in control during a solid opening stand between Shafali Verma (29 off 33) and Laura Wolvaardt (47 off 36).The pair added 73 runs off 64 balls to lay a stable platform, but the chase unravelled soon after. A dramatic middle-order collapse saw Capitals lose four wickets in quick succession, turning a straightforward pursuit into a tense finish.With 23 required off the final four overs, skipper Jemimah Rodrigues held her nerve. She remained unbeaten on 34 off 18 balls to guide Capitals home in the penultimate over.Capitals will now face Gujarat Giants in Tuesday’s Eliminator, with the winner earning a spot in Thursday’s final against Royal Challengers Bengaluru.","Delhi capitals beat up warriorz by five wickets to book their place in the eliminator at the bca stadium in vadodara.

Main factors in the Portland Trail Blazers vs New York Knicks game (January 30, 2026)

What to expect on Blazers vs Knicks Jan 30

Thein New York with both teams in very different situations. Portland is trying to stop a three-game slide while dealing with several injuries. New York is coming in on a four-game winning streak and has most of its main players available.This game is likely to be decided by depth and basic execution. Portland is missing key guards and needs replacement players to handle the ball and score. New York’s job is not as difficult. They need to defend well, take care of the ball, and use its size advantage.The game will be played at Madison Square Garden, where the Knicks have been strong this season. New York already beat Portland once earlier in the year, and the Blazers are even more short-handed for this meeting.Portland Trail Blazers are 23-25 and have lost three straight. Head coach Chauncey Billups has to rely on a thin rotation.• Damian Lillard - left Achilles management• Scoot Henderson - left knee tear, out for weeks• Matisse Thybulle - right knee tendinopathy• Kris Murray - undisclosed issue• Blake Wesley - sidelined• Duop Reath - right foot stress fracture• Deni Avdija - low back strain, around 25 points and 7 rebounds per game• Robert Williams III - knee managementIf Avdija cannot play, Portland will depend more on Shaedon Sharpe for scoring and on Jerami Grant for defense and secondary offense.Without Lillard and Henderson, Portland lacks steady ball handling. That has led to many turnovers this season.New York Knicks are 29-18 and has won four in a row.• Josh Hart - ankle soreness• Miles McBride - ankle management• Jalen Brunson - around 26 points and 6 assists per game• Karl-Anthony Towns - about 20 points and 11 rebounds• Mikal Bridges• OG Anunoby - around 16 points and 5.4 reboundsIf Hart or McBride sits, Brunson will handle the ball more often, with Bridges and Anunoby helping to create plays.These teams have met 126 times in the regular season. Portland leads the series 70-56. New York won the first meeting this season 123-114 on January 11, 2026. In that game, Brunson and Towns scored more than 40 points combined, and Portland struggled with turnovers.Portland now enters the rematch with fewer healthy guards than it had in that loss.Portland’s last few games include losses by scores of 111-115 and 94-102. The team averages about 16.1 turnovers per game, one of the highest marks in the league.New York has won games by wide margins during its streak, including 119-92 and 103-87. The Knicks have controlled rebounds and limited easy fast-break chances for opponents. Towns anchors the middle, and the wings cover ground on defense. This sets up a simple contrast: Portland must avoid mistakes, while New York looks to force them.Portland needs reliable offense without its top two guards. Sharpe has to score efficiently, Grant has to defend without fouling, and Avdija, if he plays, has to contribute on both ends.New York needs steady guard play if Hart or McBride cannot go. Brunson will see more pressure, so wing support is important. Turnovers will likely decide the pace. If Portland protects the ball, the game can stay close. If New York forces early mistakes, it can build a quick lead.This matchup favors New York. The Knicks are healthier, at home, and have already beaten this opponent once this season. Avdija’s status is the biggest variable. If he plays well, Portland can stay competitive. If he is out, New York should control rebounds, limit mistakes, and manage the game from start to finish.For Portland, the path is simple and that is fewer turnovers and balanced scoring. For New York, it is strong defense, good rebounding, and letting its main players carry the offense.","Portland trail blazers are 23-25 and have lost three straight.

Caitlin Clark addresses WNBA’s CBA future amid negotiations



Caitlin Clark makes broadcasting debut



Caitlin Clark stepped into a new spotlight Sunday night, and she made sure to address the biggest issue facing the WNBA. Making her national television debut as a basketball analyst, the Indiana Fever star used the platform to address ongoing collective bargaining negotiations that are unresolved ahead of the league’s milestone 30th season.Appearing as a special contributor on NBC’s “Basketball Night in America” from Madison Square Garden, Clark addressed the talks between the WNBA and its players’ union. League and union officials are scheduled to meet in New York City on Monday, more than a month after the union submitted its latest proposal, with the 2026 season calendar already under pressure.Caitlin Clark framed the negotiations as part of a larger movement rather than a narrow labor dispute.“Honestly, I don’t think it’s just a big moment for the WNBA. I think all of women’s sports,"" Clark said. ""I think this is one of the biggest moments we’ve ever had. I feel very confident that we’re going to get something done … We’re in this moment because of the product we put on the floor.”The next negotiating session will include WNBPA leadership and league officials led by commissioner Cathy Engelbert. WNBPA president Nneka Ogwumike is expected to attend alongside vice presidents Kelsey Plum and Napheesa Collier.While Clark’s presence at the meeting is unclear, her comment on the issue shows her concern.Clark later expanded on her optimism. “There’s a meeting tomorrow that’s super important,” Clark said. “And I truly do believe we’re going to get something done here in the next couple of weeks.” The WNBA season is scheduled to begin May 8, with the draft, expansion draft for the Portland Fire and Toronto Tempo, and free agency still needing clarity.“There’s a lot of things left to do but I really do feel confident that both sides are going to reach a deal here soon,” Clark said.Clark’s first night in the broadcast chair marked a notable career step. She joined Maria Taylor, Reggie Miller, and Carmelo Anthony for pregame coverage ahead of the Lakers vs. Knicks matchup, drawing attention for her ease on set. The 6-foot guard joked afterward that the group made her feel short.Clark, entering her third WNBA season, will return as a special contributor on March 29 when the Knicks face the Oklahoma City Thunder. NBC plans to mirror the structure of its football coverage, placing Clark in a role that blends analysis with star appeal.In a statement, Clark said, “I’m really excited to be part of the Basketball Night in America crew this season. Carmelo, Vince, and Tracy are legends of the game, and Maria is a true professional. It will be really fun to join them a few times this season.”It’s unclear if Clark would make more appearances in the future. Right now, she is confirmed to join two appearances, including the Sunday event.","Caitlin clark made her national television debut as a basketball analyst.

MUMBAI: Delhi may have crashed out of the Ranji Trophy at the league stage this season, finishing without an outright win in seven matches (they drew six out of them) but in young talented batting guns Ayush Doseja and Sanat Sangwan, they seem to have discovered two red-ball gems.On Sunday, Doseja, stepping in as the captain of the team at the last minute after Ayush Badoni had to report for India A duty, slammed his fourth century of the season, a gallant, unbeaten 159 (230b, 11x4, 2x6), after resuming from his overnight score of 62 to help Delhi finish at 407 for six and earn a hard-fought draw against Mumbai in their last league match of the Ranji Trophy at the MCA ground in BKC.When the players shook hands at 2.10pm, Doseja, who has taken to first-class cricket like duck to water, finished his debut season with 949 runs in seven matches@105.44-an incredible feat indeed by the 23-year-old. In fact, if Delhi weren’t knocked out of the tournament, the lad from Rohini, the highest run-getter in India after the league stage of the Ranji Trophy, would’ve earned a rare distinction of scoring 1,000 runs in his debut first-class season.Immediately after the proceedings ended, the young left-hander and his teammate Sanat Sangwan, who slammed a superb century (118) in the first innings, approached Mumbai’s in-form batter Sarfaraz Khan -a domestic run-machine-for some tips on playing on red soil-something that he doesn’t get to do often as back in Delhi, he gets to play on black soil pitches. “He is a big player in domestic cricket. So, I asked him how I can be better while playing on red soil wickets. I am trying to be a three-format player. Sarfaraz. He told me that on red soil wickets, it would be better if I keep my head down while batting. You will then hit less ‘casual shots,’ because I survived two-three dropped catches, as the ball bounces a bit on red soil. He was saying that if I was having a bad day, those catches would’ve been taken. He said that I could change my game according to whether I play on a back soil or red soil pitch,” Doseja told reporters.Indeed, Doseja was dropped thrice, once by substitute fielder Akhil Hewadkar on 99 at short extra cover off Himanshu Singh, and later by substitute fielder Sairaj Patil at deep mid-wicket off Shams Mulani and then on 158 by Mulani at lone slip of Himanshu again. It must also be said thatMumbai, having already qualified for the knockouts, didn’t exert themselves. However, all this should take anything away from his gallant effort and fabulous consistency.Doseja slammed centuries (104* & 129) in each innings against Chhattisgarh at the BCCI’s centre of Excellence in Bengaluru and 209 against Hyderabad in Hyderabad on his first-class debut, but he rates his match-saving century against Mumbai in Mumbai as his “best” of his nascent career so far. During the Vijay Hazare Trophy, modern-day cricket legend Virat Kohli advised Doseja to give his “200%” in every match, and the youngster is sticking to that mantra from the maestro.Asked on where Delhi failed to make it to the KOs of the Ranji Trophy despite he and Sangwan (828 runs in seven matches@69.00) being the top two run-getters in the league phase of the 2025-25 Ranji Trophy season, Doseja pointed out to the lack of good spinners in the side.“I was talking to the coach, our spinners and fast bowlers can be better in red-ball cricket. When we come to play the Ranji Trophy next season, we will have to work on our bowlers. We will have to pick spinners who can take five wickets. We had this problem the whole season. We didn't have spinners who can take 10 (opposition) wickets. In this match also, it was a seaming wicket, and we thought that if the spinners stopped runs from one end, the fast bowlers could have taken wickets from the other. But the runs didn't stop (leaking), otherwise we would have won the match on the first innings lead.”Mumbai, who finished the league stage as Group D toppers with 33 points in seven matches, will be boosted by the return of captain Shardul Thakur , who has recovered from calf injury, for the Ranji Trophy quarterfinals, which start from Feb 6. Thakur bowled in the nets at BKC during the Delhi versus Mumbai game.Sunday evening will be remembered for one of the finest knocks by young captain Devdutt Padikkal and a chase for the ages as Karnataka scripted a memorable win in their fixture against Punjab in Mohali.Needing a win to qualify for the quarterfinals, they were set a target of 250 in 40 overs. Padikkal led from the front with an unbeaten 120 off 85 balls (6x4; 5x6), guiding Karnataka to a five-wicket victory in just 27.5 overs despite fading light and mounting pressure.",Ayush doseja scored 159 not out in delhi's draw against mumbai. The 23-year-old has scored 949 runs in seven matches@105.44 in his debut season. Sanat sangwan also scored a superb century (118) in first innings. Doseja slammed centuries (104* & 129) in each innings against chhattisgarh and 209 against hyderabad on his first-class debut.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127852005,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-151682,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"

But I know you watch the league, you love ball. Like you just watch the game. Is there a player, someone you watch even more specifically, because there are things in his game that you might wanna add to yours?” The Indiana Fever star had an instant response to it.She stated, “Man, I think Luka. I mean, Luka’s amazing and he is incredible. I think the way he can not only score the ball, but also the way he passes.The thing with him is that he is not the fastest, he is not the most athletic. But he can get his defender to move where he wants them to go. He takes up that space.” She further added, “He does a very good job of either keeping the defender behind him or keeping him to the sides.” Caitlin believed that she needed to learn this from the Slovenian athlete. The Fever star ended her statement with, “He makes it look pretty easy. But I promise you it is not that easy.NBA Hall of Famer Reggie Miller stunned everyone, revealing an elite list of his own. It was about the top three shooters from Indiana. He placed himself in third place. The first place was occupied by Caitlin Clark and following up next was Tyrese Haliburton.
