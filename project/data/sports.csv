Tom Brady balances Fox Sports job and Las Vegas Raiders ownership

Tom Brady will be back in the broadcast booth this season with fewer restrictions from the NFL. On Wednesday, August 28, 2025, the league announced that Brady, who is both Fox Sports‚Äô lead game analyst and a minority owner of the Las Vegas Raiders, will now be allowed to join production meetings with coaches and players. Last year, during his first season as an analyst, Brady was banned from these meetings because of conflict-of-interest concerns. The NFL has now lifted that ban, but he will still not be allowed to attend team practices.Tom Brady, 47, reacted quickly to the news on his Instagram story. He reposted a Bleacher Report update and added a lighthearted message of his own:he wrote, tagging Kevin Burkhardt, Erin Andrews, and NFL on Fox.Tom Brady signed a 10-year, $375 million contract with Fox Sports in 2023, right after retiring from the NFL in 2022. He joined play-by-play announcer Kevin Burkhardt and sideline reporter Erin Andrews in the booth.But once NFL owners approved his 17-month process of buying a minority stake in the Raiders, the league created strict rules to avoid a conflict. In 2024, Brady was not allowed to sit in on almost any production meeting with teams, except during the Super Bowl.Now the NFL has eased those rules before the 2025 season, which starts on September 7 when Brady and the Fox crew will cover the New York Giants vs. Washington Commanders game.Also Read: Taylor Swift Vs Cristiano Ronaldo: Whose Engagement Ring Has Higher Value While the league has allowed Tom Brady more freedom as an analyst, some restrictions will remain in place.

Looking back at Derek Ryan‚Äôs Oilers tenure

Edmonton Oilers star Leon Draisaitl delivered a heartfelt message to former teammate Derek Ryan, who officially bid farewell to Edmonton after four memorable seasons. Ryan‚Äôs departure marks the end of a steady tenure in the Oilers‚Äô bottom-six, where his leadership and consistency left a lasting impression on teammates and fans alike.Ryan, 37, announced on Instagram that his contract with the Oilers had run its course, bringing his Edmonton stint to an end. With no fresh NHL deal in place, the veteran forward reflected on his journey, thanking Oilers supporters for embracing his family and celebrating the memories created in Alberta.‚ÄúEdmonton, thank you for the best 4 years. My family and I will always cherish the city, the memories that we made there, and most importantly the relationships that we formed. We might be leaving, but those relationships will last forever,‚Äù Ryan wrote in his farewell post.The message drew an emotional response from fans and players, but it was Leon Draisaitl‚Äôs simple reply that captured attention. In German, the Oilers‚Äô superstar commented, ‚ÄúDu bist unglaublich,‚Äù translating to ‚ÄúYou are incredible.‚Äù The gesture reflected the bond shared between the two players, underscoring Ryan‚Äôs influence inside the locker room.Ryan‚Äôs exit comes at a crucial moment for the Edmonton Oilers, as NHL free agency 2025 sparks roster changes, contract updates, and speculation around veteran forwards.

He delivered back-to-back 20-plus point seasons, cementing his value as a depth forward.His role, however, diminished last season.

Michael Jordan wins $8.9 million lawsuit against Dominick‚Äôs in 2015

Michael Jordan donates the proceeds and supports Chicago children

Even after retiring from the NBA, Michael Jordan has remained a strong and determined figure. Off the court, he is just as careful about his rights as he was about his game. One story from 2015 shows how seriously he protects his personal identity. Jordan‚Äôs actions sent a clear message about defending personal rights and giving back to the community at the same time.The case began in Chicago, Illinois, where Michael Jordan, the Hall of Famer and six-time NBA champion, noticed his name was used without permission. The Chicago-based supermarket chain Dominick‚Äôs, a subsidiary of Safeway that later closed in 2013, ran an advertisement in 2011 featuring Jordan‚Äôs name to promote a meat sale in a Sports Illustrated special issue. Jordan‚Äôs legal team said the chain had no right to use his name.The supermarket first offered a settlement of about $126,900, but Michael Jordan‚Äôs lawyers argued that the sum should match the real advertising value of his name. After the court reviewed the case, Jordan won $8.9 million. ESPN reported his comments after the verdict, saying,‚ÄúNo one, whether or not they‚Äôre a public figure, should have to worry about their identity being used without their permission.‚ÄùJordan added, ‚ÄúI hope this case sends a clear message‚Ä¶that I will continue to be vigilant about protecting my name and identity.‚ÄùHe further added:""The case was not about the money, as I plan to donate the proceeds to charity. It was about honesty and integrity.... I also hope the size of the monetary reward will deter others from using someone else's identity and believing they will only pay a small penalty.""Michael Jordan made it clear that the lawsuit was not about money. Instead, it was about integrity, honesty, and defending his personal rights. He pledged to donate the full $8.9 million to 23 charities in Chicago that support children‚Äôs health, education, and well-being. In a news release shared with ABA Journal, Jordan said, ‚ÄúChicago has given me so much, and I want to give back to its kids, the city‚Äôs future.‚ÄùJordan, now 62, is not only a legendary basketball player but also a cultural icon who uses his platform to make a difference. The Dominick‚Äôs case shows how he defends his rights and uses victories to help others.His careful attention to personal identity also comes amid other legal challenges, such as his 2015 lawsuit in China against Qiaodan Sports, which uses his name and number 23 without permission. This story originally appeared on ESPN and ABA Journal and highlights Michael Jordan‚Äôs commitment to personal rights, community support, and integrity both on and off the courtMichael Jordan recently donated $10 million to open his fourth free health clinic in Wilmington, further improving access to healthcare in the surrounding community.","""i want to give back to kids"" - michael jordan proudly donated $8.9 million after winning supermarket lawsuit in 2015.

Is Easton Cowan READY for the Next Step with the Maple Leafs?

Easton Cowan looks prepared to crack the Maple Leafs' lineup



Ben Danford and Noah Chadwick headline defensive prospects

Ben Danford | 2024-25 Highlights

Tyler Hopkins and Artur Akhtyamov add long-term potential

The Toronto Maple Leafs are looking ahead to the 2024-25 season. Along with optimism surrounding their top young players, all from forwards to defensemen and goaltenders. There are several prospects moving closer to NHL readiness. The focus is on Easton Cowan, who could break into the lineup this fall, while others continue their development paths across junior and professional hockey.Easton Cowan‚Äôs rise has been impressive since Toronto selected him with the 28th pick in the 2023 NHL Draft. Last season with the London of the Ontario Hockey League, he produced 69 points in 46 games. His standout play continued in the postseason, where he led all scorers with 39 points in 17 playoff games.Cowan‚Äôs efforts guided London to the Memorial Cup championship and earned him the tournament‚Äôs most valuable player award. At 20, he will enter Maple Leafs training camp with a legitimate shot at earning a roster spot. His skill, pace, and ability to perform under pressure have made him the centerpiece of Toronto‚Äôs prospect group.Ben Danford, taken with the 31st pick in the 2024 Draft, is building his reputation as a steady and physical defenseman.Playing with Oshawa of the OHL, the 19-year-old contributed 25 points last season while wearing the captain‚Äôs ‚ÄúC.‚Äù His leadership qualities and skating ability have already caught the attention of Toronto‚Äôs development staff.Noah Chadwick, a sixth-round pick from 2023, has emerged as another promising option on the blue line. The 6-foot-4 defenseman captained Lethbridge in the Western Hockey League and finished with 53 points in 66 games. While his skating continues to improve, his size and presence make him an intriguing long-term project for the Maple Leafs.Among forwards, Tyler Hopkins is one of the more recent additions. The Maple Leafs picked him in the third round of the 2025 Draft. He scored 51 points for Kingston of the OHL last season and is noted for his strong two-way game. At 18, Hopkins has time to refine his skills, but his hockey sense makes him a player worth monitoring.Goaltender Artur Akhtyamov continues to work toward NHL opportunities after being drafted in 2020. Last season, he appeared in 26 games with the Toronto Marlies in the American Hockey League. He posted 11 wins, three shutouts, and gained valuable experience in his first North American season. The 23-year-old will battle for positioning within Toronto‚Äôs depth chart.The Maple Leafs enter the season with a balanced mix of prospects. Cowan could make an immediate impact, while Danford and Chadwick provide defensive strength for the future.

Rich Eisen Is STUNNED by Browns Opting for Rookies Shedeur Sanders/Dillon Gabriel to Backup Flacco

Rookies ready to shine: Dillon Gabriel and Shedeur Sanders waiting in the wings

Week 1 could flip the script for the Browns

The Cleveland Browns are entering the 2025 season with a quarterback storyline that has fans and analysts on edge. Joe Flacco has been named the starter, but rookies Dillon Gabriel and Shedeur Sanders have both claimed spots on the 53-man roster. As the Browns prepare to face the Cincinnati Bengals in their season opener, one misstep from Flacco could instantly reshape the depth chart. With two talented rookies waiting in the wings, Week 1 promises high stakes and big surprises.Joe Flacco brings veteran savvy to Cleveland, yet even experienced quarterbacks aren‚Äôt immune to early-season scrutiny. The Bengals‚Äô defense is known for forcing mistakes, and Week 1 could test Flacco‚Äôs poise immediately. Analyst Rich Eisen highlighted the fragile balance in the Browns‚Äô QB lineup, ‚ÄúOne Trey Hendrickson get off in Week 1 and the Browns may have either Dillon Gabriel or Shedeur Sanders as their go-forward quarterback,‚Äù Eisen said.He added context about Flacco‚Äôs strengths, ‚ÄúAnd it's not like, Flacco's a spring chicken. He is smart enough to read a defense and get rid of a football and protect himself, which is great news.‚ÄùBehind Flacco, Dillon Gabriel and Shedeur Sanders have shown flashes of brilliance during training camp and preseason games. Gabriel, drafted in the third round, combines mobility and a quick release, while Sanders has impressed with poise and football IQ. Both rookies are ready to step up if given the chance.Eisen noted the intriguing decision the Browns face, ‚ÄúBut at the end of the day of getting Flacco, acquiring Kenny Pickett, and then drafting Dillon Gabriel in the third round before Shedeur, only to take Shedeur anyway at the end of the day, it is now going to be a fascinating choice as to who is second on the depth chart for the Cleveland Browns.‚ÄùThe opener against Cincinnati is a proving ground. Flacco must demonstrate leadership under pressure, while Gabriel and Sanders wait for their opportunity. Coaching decisions will be closely watched, and a single misstep could dramatically shift Cleveland‚Äôs QB hierarchy.The Browns‚Äô quarterback situation blends talent with uncertainty. Week 1 could influence not only who starts, but also the offensive approach, roster moves, and even future draft considerations. Fans will be watching closely to see which rookie emerges and whether Flacco can navigate the high-pressure start to the season.Also read: Saints shock fans with bold roster move, release 2023 second-round defensive end Isaiah Foskey as team reshapes defense",Rich eisen sounds the alarm on browns qb battle.joe flacco‚Äôs spot isn't safe: pressure hits from the first snap.rich eisen is stunned by browns opting for rookies shedeur sanders/dillon gabriel to backup flacco.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123546611,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-29332,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

University of Bristol research shows NHL far ahead of NBA in ad frequency



The NHL's Gambling Problem : A Deep Dive

Sports betting promotions could face tighter rules in the coming seasons



The NHL is facing fresh scrutiny after new research highlighted the overwhelming presence of gambling promotions during this year‚Äôs Stanley Cup finals. Fans tuning in were hit with near-constant exposure to betting companies, sparking debate over whether hockey has allowed gambling to take too central a role in its broadcasts.The University of Bristol analyzed advertising during the six-game championship series between the Florida Panthers and the Edmonton Oilers. The findings were striking: on average, gambling-related logos, commercials, or rinkside ads appeared 3.5 times per minute.In the most saturated game, that figure rose to 4.7 times per minute; the equivalent of one ad every 13 seconds. This level of visibility is far higher than many expected. And illustrates how deeply betting partnerships have become woven into NHL coverage.For fans, it meant that gambling brands were nearly impossible to ignore, as from jersey patches to on-screen graphics, promotions were layered into nearly every aspect of the broadcast.The same study compared the NHL finals with the NBA finals, where the Indiana Pacers faced the Oklahoma City Thunder. Across all 13 championship games between the two leagues.And researchers recorded 6,282 instances of gambling-related marketing.Notably, 94 percent of those instances occurred during NHL broadcasts, while the NBA averaged just 0.26 gambling mentions per minute; the NHL averaged 3.5. And a gap that underscores how heavily hockey relies on betting promotions compared to basketball.Researchers suggested this disparity might be tied to platform choices. The NBA has leaned more on outlets like YouTube, which enforces stricter rules on gambling advertising, while the NHL‚Äôs traditional broadcast approach leaves more room for ad saturation.The findings add weight to calls for tighter regulation of sports gambling promotions. Comparisons have already been made to past restrictions on alcohol and tobacco sponsorships in professional sports.While gambling has become a major revenue source for the NHL and its broadcast partners, concerns are growing. That too about the impact on younger viewers and vulnerable audiences, as the study suggests that the current advertising pace is unsustainable and could push regulators to step in.For now, fans may have to get used to the constant betting messages, but with public concern rising and research shining a light on the issue. The league could eventually be forced to scale back its reliance on gambling visibility.Also Read: NHL Trade News: Why Steve Yzerman‚Äôs trade of Jake Walman still puzzles Red Wings fans","University of bristol research shows nhl far ahead of nba in ad frequency.

NFL hands down six-game suspension for Rashee Rice



The legal troubles behind the NFL‚Äôs decision



The Kansas City Chiefs are starting the new NFL season with some major drama off the field. Wide receiver Rashee Rice, who was expected to be a huge part of Patrick Mahomes ‚Äô passing game, won‚Äôt be suiting up anytime soon. The NFL has officially suspended Rice for six games under its personal conduct policy, a decision that follows months of speculation and back-and-forth about how harsh the punishment would be.According to ESPN and NFL Network, Rice agreed to a six-game ban that kicks in Week 1 of the 2025 season, when the Chiefs open in Brazil. He‚Äôll be eligible to return in Week 7, giving Kansas City half a season without one of their top young offensive weapons.The league originally wanted something closer to a double-digit suspension, but a negotiated settlement with the NFL Players Association landed at six games. It‚Äôs a huge storyline heading into the new year, with the NFL balancing discipline and the Chiefs trying to defend their dynasty.The suspension stems from Rice‚Äôs role in a chain-reaction crash in Dallas back in March 2024. He pleaded guilty to two third-degree felonies in July, which resulted in a sentence of 30 days in jail, five years of probation, and more than $115,000 in restitution to the victims.While the jail time can be served during his probation, the NFL moved forward with discipline under its personal conduct policy. The ruling makes it clear that Rice‚Äôs off-field choices are now impacting his football future.For Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs, the loss of Rice is no small thing. After a breakout rookie season, he was expected to be the No. 1 wideout in Kansas City‚Äôs retooled offense. Instead, Patrick Mahomes will have to lean more heavily on Hollywood Brown, rookie speedster Xavier Worthy, and veterans like Skyy Moore and Justin Watson.The NFL schedule doesn‚Äôt make things easy either Kansas City opens with the Chargers in Brazil and faces a tough stretch in September. Without Rice, every game suddenly feels more complicated for Andy Reid‚Äôs offense.For Rashee Rice, this will be the ultimate test. Does he learn from this and come back stronger, or does this setback derail a career that was just starting to take off?Also read - Travis Kelce‚Äôs Net Worth in 2025: NFL Salary, Endorsements, and Business Ventures","Nfl hands down six-game suspension for rashee rice.
