Pulwama cricketer wears helmet with Palestinian flag sticker; cops start probe,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pulwama-cricketer-wears-helmet-with-palestinian-flag-sticker-cops-start-probe/articleshow/126311917.cms,"J&K cricketer wears helmet with Palestine flag

JAMMU/SRINAGAR: J&K police have started a probe after videos went viral of a cricketer, Furqan Ul Haq, walking into a Jammu tournament wearing a Palestinian flag sticker on his helmet. The row also took on a political edge, with the PDP and others backing the Pulwama youth and BJP condemning the act as an attempt to incite “separatism”.The controversy broke Wednesday after Furqan strode in to bat at Jammu and Kashmir Champions League in Muthi, around 10km from Jammu city, for his team JK Eleven Kings with the flag emblazoned on his helmet. Some players of the rival team Jammu Trail Blazers raised strong objections, leading Furqan’s team to send him back and oust him from the match.On Friday, the police issued a statement confirming a preliminary inquiry to “ascertain the facts” Furqan’s “intent, background and any possible linkages”. The 14-day preliminary inquiry under Section 173(3) BNSS has been ordered given the sensitivity of the matter and its potential public order implications, the statement added. Furqan and the private organisers of the tournament were later called to Jammu’s Domana police station for the inquiry.Jammu and Kashmir Cricket Association (JKCA) distanced itself from the controversy, maintaining that the tournament was a private event and not recognised by it. “JKCA has nothing to do with this. It involves local players. Even spectators are not allowed. Police will take necessary action,” JKCA official Anil Gupta said.While JKCA shrugged off the issue, politicians didn’t. Former CM and PDP president Mehbooba Mufti posted a message in support of Palestine. “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free. A flag in the wind, bold and free, From the river to the sea,” Mehbooba wrote on X after reports about the police inquiry.Sheikh Khursheed, Awami Ittehad Party MLA and brother of jailed Baramulla MP Engineer Rashid, called the police action “unjustified.” Khursheed said expressing solidarity with Palestine should not be treated as a crime, particularly when India has consistently supported the Palestinian cause internationally.Khursheed recalled that Congress’s Priyanka Gandhi had carried a bag bearing a Palestine symbol in Parliament without facing action. “If such expressions are acceptable for politicians, targeting a sportsperson for a symbolic gesture exposes selective outrage,” Khursheed said.BJP, however, denounced Furqan. Party MLA RS Pathania called for strict action against the cricketer and the organisers of the match, saying such deeds “emanating from Kashmir only promotes separatism”.This is the second cricket event in J&K to have been engulfed by controversy in less than two months. In Nov last year, the privately run Indian Heaven Premier League (IHPL) collapsed when its organisers allegedly bolted out of Srinagar after duping players, officials, broadcasters and hoteliers.","J&k police have started a probe after videos went viral of a cricketer wearing a palestinian flag sticker on his helmet.

Tyson Kidd’s in-ring success and post-injury WWE role





Natalya Neidhart and Tyson Kidd were born into professional wrestling and WWE universe and have been established since they were 20 years old. Through WWE contracts, television showcases, and decades of steady employment instead of fleeting headlines, both built financial futures. Good record of relevancy, including expanding their combined net worth.Neither is among WWE's top 10 global superstars so far as compensation, at least on the finer points of the evening, but the dollars tell the tale of consistent success for each.

Caitlin Clark’s most-awaited recovery and return







With the Super Bowl almost a month away, everyone has their favorites, and so does WNBA’s biggest star, Caitlin Clark. On the recent episode of the “New Heights” podcast hosted by the Kelce brothers, Jason and Travis, the 2024 ROTY winner appeared and sparked a cross-sport debate after naming her favorites for Super Bowl 2026.Though Clark hails from Iowa, she admitted her admiration for the New England Patriots, which is largely influenced by her liking for Patriots star QB Drake Maye. This seemed like a classic case where greatness recognizes and appreciates greatness.The last episode of New Heights for 2025 was anything but not dramatic. In a conversation with Jason and Travis over who is Clark’s favorite to win the next Super Bowl, Caitlin revealed, “I may not be cheering for anybody…but honestly, I am a Drake Maye fan. He’s been incredible.Continuing, she said, “I will probably be pulling for the Patriots, but the Rams are really good too. Sam Darnold seems like a good guy…I could root for him.”Drake Maye and Caitlin Clark began their professional career in 2024 and have been proving to be a cornerstone for their teams. Draye Maye registered a completion rate of 66.6% completing 225-of-338 passes in 2024, over 2,276 yards, and 15 touchdowns.Clark also entered the 2025 season after a historic rookie campaign where she averaged 19.2 points and a league-leading 8.4 assists per game. Though her 2025 season ended early, just after 13 games, due to an injury, the snippets from the USA camp show Clark is healthier and ready to enter the 2026 season with a bang.While the Super Bowl occupies the current headline from who’ll play to who’ll perform at halftime, the Indy fever fans are more concerned with Clark’s physical longevity.Reports suggest her 100% recovery and her focus on strength training to return by the WNBA’s 2026 tip-off. Clark’s return is just not crucial for the Fever, whose offensive strength revolves around her, but also for the league as she’s a walking viewership magnet.

Criticism resurfaces at the worst possible time

Lamar Jackson: 'I'm Gonna Be Out There' | Baltimore Ravens

Lamar Jackson addresses the allegations directly

As the Baltimore Ravens head into a crucial Week 18 showdown, Lamar Jackson finds himself battling more than just a division rival. The two-time NFL MVP is also pushing back against renewed criticism about his professionalism, choosing calm defiance over distraction as Baltimore’s playoff fate hangs in the balance.Jackson recently became the subject of a pointed column that questioned his work ethic, alleging late-night video game habits and even suggesting he had fallen asleep during team meetings. The criticism went further, urging the Ravens to consider trading their franchise quarterback claims that quickly gained traction given Baltimore’s uneven 2025 campaign.Speaking to reporters this week, Jackson dismissed the narrative without hesitation. He labeled the criticism as “noise,” stressing that speculation tends to surface whenever results don’t go as planned.“When you’re winning, there’s no talk,” Jackson said. “As soon as things don’t look right, all types of stuff comes out of nowhere.”Jackson was visibly amused by the suggestion that he had dozed off during meetings, flatly denying the claim and pointing to his relationship with head coach John Harbaugh as proof.“Do you really think Coach Harbaugh would let me fall asleep in meetings?” Jackson said with a laugh. “I’m sitting right in the front.”He also rejected reports about staying up late gaming, calling them completely fabricated and insisting they don’t reflect his routine even during the offseason. For Jackson, the focus remains on football, not on countering every headline.The timing of the criticism couldn’t be more sensitive. Jackson is expected to return this week after missing the Ravens’ Week 17 win due to a painful back injury. With the AFC North title still up for grabs, Baltimore controls its playoff destiny with a win against the Pittsburgh Steelers.Despite missing time, Jackson made it clear he had nothing to apologize for regarding his injury absence. “I’m human,” he said, noting that the team still found a way to win without him. There’s a familiar rhythm to the doubts surrounding Jackson. From early career debates about his position to recurring questions about leadership and preparation, the quarterback has consistently responded with results. Now, with his contract future and postseason hopes intersecting, Jackson appears unfazed.As Sunday approaches, the Ravens will look to their star quarterback to silence both rivals and critics. If Baltimore’s playoff hopes survive, Jackson’s response won’t come through words; it will come under the lights, where he has made a habit of rewriting the conversation.",Lamar jackson is the subject of renewed criticism about his professionalism.

LeBron James vs Stephen Curry salary breakdown

The net worth battle between LeBron James and Stephen Curry







LeBron James and Stephen Curry are the Mount Rushmore of modern NBA. They just do not dominate the court with their skills and game IQ, but make a significant impact off the court too. It is still wild to imagine how James and Curry were born in the same hospital. Shocked much? As reported by the Beacon Journal in 2015, both James (1984) and Curry (1988) were born at Akron General Medical Center in Ohio, just a few years apart.These two heavyweights just don’t outshine their opponents on the court, but they also command the financial landscape of NBA. From battling for rings to sharing a bond of trust and respect, LeBron James and Stephen Curry have come a long way and have done their bank account. One is a certified billionaire business mogul, while the other is currently the highest-paid on-court performer the league has ever seen.If one just looks at the seasonal paycheck, then Stephen Curry is actually winning. For the 2025–26 season, Steph is pulling in a staggering $59.6 million from the Golden State Warriors, making him the highest-paid player in the league, a record that he has held since 2017-18. But LeBron James isn't exactly lagging, despite his Lakers salary for this season sitting at $52.6 million.The difference is Curry’s art of the ""Supermax."" He was the first player to cross the $200 million contract threshold when he signed a 5-year $201 million deal with the Warriors in 2017. And with his recent veteran extension of $62 million for 1-year, Curry’s on his way to becoming the first NBA player to be paid $62 million for a single season in 2026-27. However, while Steph wins the annual salary race, LeBron still leads in total career on-court earnings, having banked over $580 million since he was drafted back in 2003.This is where the comparison gets steep and the difference wide. LeBron James officially hit billionaire status in 2022 and currently sits at a net worth of approximately $1.3 billion. He didn't get there just by playing ball; he built an empire. Between his lifetime Nike deal (rumored to be worth over $1 billion), his production company SpringHill, and stakes in Fenway Sports Group (which owns the Red Sox and Liverpool FC), LeBron is playing a completely different game off the court.Stephen Curry’s current net worth is estimated at $240 million as of late 2025. While that’s a massive fortune, it shows the difference between being a superstar and being a tycoon. Steph’s wealth is climbing fast, though, thanks to his own Curry Brand, which is now independent after breaking with Under Armour and his Unanimous Media production house. At the end of the day, whether you prefer the King’s power or the Chef’s range, both are proving that the modern athlete is just as much a CEO as they are a point guard.Also read: ""“We emptied the cups”: LeBron James and Bronny James get candid on LA Lakers’ Spill The Tea","Lebron james and stephen curry are the mount rushmore of modern nba.

How the game changes without Jokic





when the Denver Nuggets face the Cleveland Cavaliers on January 2, 2026. Denver has ruled out its starting center as he continues to recover from a left knee hyperextension, an injury the team expects will keep him out for at least four weeks.This game was expected to be one of the more notable matchups of the week. Instead, it arrives with Denver missing much of its regular rotation and focused on getting through the night without further issues. The Nuggets are deep into an Eastern Conference road trip and are clearly thinking beyond a single January game.The Denver Nuggets confirmed earlier in the day that Nikola Jokic will not suit up in Cleveland. His absence is part of a planned recovery process, not a late decision or short-term rest.The game tips off at 7:30 p.m. ET at Rocket Arena, which means fans in India will be watching early on January 3. There has been no indication from the team that a return was ever on the table for this matchup.Nikola Jokic suffered a hyperextension of his left knee earlier in the week, with additional concern around a bone bruise. Denver has already outlined a recovery window of more than four weeks, with a re-evaluation expected in about a month.Before the injury, he was averaging 29.6 points, 12.2 rebounds, and 11 assists per game. His absence has already affected Denver’s short-term outlook and could play a role in how the MVP race unfolds this season.Jokic is only one of several Nuggets unavailable tonight. Denver’s injury report is one of the longest it has carried all season, especially in the frontcourt.Jamal Murray is listed with an ankle sprain but is expected to play, which would leave him as the clear focal point of Denver’s offense.Without Jokic, Denver Nuggets loses its main scorer, rebounder, and playmaker. The offense becomes more guard-driven, with fewer easy looks created through the center position.Also read: Denver Nuggets vs Cleveland Cavaliers regular season game: Full injury report, who's out, where to watch, and more (January 2, 2025) Cleveland enters with a healthier lineup and a clear advantage inside.

Inside story of why Shubman Gill was DROPPED from India T20I World Cup squad





Just like Virat Kohli ’s recent domestic matches, Indian ODI and Test captain Shubman Gill ’s upcoming Vijay Hazare Trophy game will also be played without fans in the stands. It will be Gill's first domestic game since being dropped from India's T20 World Cup squad.Gill will turn out for Punjab against Sikkim on Saturday at the Jaipuria College ground, but no general public will be allowed to watch the match from inside the venue.The decision has been taken following BCCI guidelines.According to the board’s instructions, both Shubman Gill and India pacer Arshdeep Singh will feature in Punjab’s next two Vijay Hazare Trophy matches.Punjab will face Sikkim on January 3 and Goa on January 6.While the match against Goa will be played at the KL Saini Stadium, the Sikkim game has been scheduled at the Jaipuria College ground.Due to security concerns and the absence of proper seating arrangements for spectators, the match will be held behind closed doors.A BCCI source explained that only people associated with the college will be allowed entry.""The students and staff are allowed inside the premises but there will be enough security arrangements including private bouncers being deployed. In any case, no outsiders will be allowed inside the college premises,"" the source told PTI.""The scheduling was done much earlier. Only because of Rohit Sharma and anticipating the response, Mumbai's match had to be shifted to Sawai Man Singh Stadium from Anantam,"" the source added.Like the Vijay Hazare Trophy games featuring Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma, Gill’s match will also not be available for fans to watch on television or online.There will be no live broadcast or live streaming of the game.Shubman Gill and Arshdeep Singh are expected to reach the venue late on Friday night.Their travel plans were affected due to poor weather conditions in north India.""Both Gill and Arshdeep were supposed to arrive by evening but prevailing weather condition in North India has led to delay of their flights. Weather permitting, they will arrive by late night,"" the source said.With fans unable to attend or watch the match live, Gill’s appearance for Punjab will remain a low-key affair.However, the game will still be important for Punjab as they continue their Vijay Hazare Trophy campaign with two key international players returning to domestic cricket.",Shubman gill will play for punjab against sikkim on saturday.

Jaipur: After a difficult few weeks — first dealing with an injury setback and then the disappointment of being dropped from India’s T20 World Cup squad — Shubman Gill will get a chance to rediscover his white-ball rhythm when the India’s Test and ODI skipper turns out for Punjab against Sikkim in the fifth round of the Vijay Hazare Trophy on Saturday.Much to the disappointment of Gill fans, the match will be played behind closed doors at the Jaipuria Vidyalaya ground, which doesn’t have the seating capacity of the Sawai Mansingh Stadium, where around 20,000 spectators enjoyed Rohit Sharma ’s ton last week.Gill, who will miss his Punjab opening partner Abhishek Sharma — the dashing southpaw returned home following the first two games — will look to make the most of these two Vijay Hazare matches to put the recent disappointment behind him.

Why Mohammed Shami needs to return in India colours before World Cup





New Delhi: The current Indian team management’s go-to word has been ‘flexibility’. Now, it remains to be seen whether the selectors continue to experiment or opt for continuity. At the centre of this debate is Rishabh Pant By standard team-building logic, Pant’s place in the 15-member squad shouldn’t be in doubt. He has warmed the bench as KL Rahul ’s backup wicketkeeper for the last 18 months. Since coming back from a car accident, he has played only one ODI — on a rank turner in Sri Lanka in Aug 2024. Before the accident, Pant averaged over 41 with a strike rate close to 110 while batting at No. 4. Much has changed since. Gautam Gambhir has consolidated his influence as head coach. Rohit Sharma has been replaced by Shubman Gill as captain. ‘Flexibility’ and an aversion to superstar culture have become core principles of selection.Three ODIs against New Zealand may not seem significant. But India will play only 20 or so ODIs before the 2027 World Cup. “The team management and selection committee did a good job when they started the transition process. But constant chopping and changing doesn’t help stability. If Pant has been your No. 2 wicketkeeper and is dropped without playing, you are challenging your own selection process. There needs to be consistency in selection, otherwise it doesn’t send a good signal to players coming up the ranks,” former national selector Devang Gandhi told TOI.It is understood that the selectors wanted to rotate Pant and Rahul as wicketkeepers in the six home ODIs this season. However, the continued reluctance to play Pant suggests a lack of trust in his abilities. Similar situations have played out in Test cricket with Shardul Thakur and Nitish Kumar Reddy, when the management and captain did not appear to be on the same page.“My only fear is a repeat of 2019, when you didn’t prepare backups in the middle order. Pant can still serve for another seven to eight years. If they feel they can maximise his potential, they must start working with him. He has been part of the system since 2018. If not, they must identify a definite second wicketkeeper — and not keep changing without giving the player a full run, because there aren’t many ODIs before the World Cup,” former India wicketkeeper and broadcaster Deep Dasgupta said.Pant hasn’t set the stage on fire in the Vijay Hazare Trophy on sticky Bengaluru pitches. “I won’t judge him by the runs. He hasn’t played the 50-over format for nearly three-and-a-half years. Before his accident, he had started finding his feet in ODIs. It’s about how much you want to back him,” Dasgupta added.",Rishabh pant has warmed the bench as kl rahul’s backup wicketkeeper for the last 18 months. Pant averaged over 41 with a strike rate close to 110 while batting at no. 4.

Poll Do you believe that the rise in T20 scores is improving the excitement of the game? Absolutely! It's thrilling. Somewhat. It depends on the match. Not really. I prefer lower scores. I have no opinion on this.





The number of runs cricketers score in the T20 cricket continues to climb each year since the turn of the decade. In 2025, 4,62,258 runs were scored across the world in game's shortest format. On an average, each team scored 295.37 runs per match.Punjab scored 310 against Bengal in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy with Abhishek Sharma scoring a 52-ball 148. At the international level, England walloped South Africa by scoring 304 runs, thanks to Phil Salt's unbeaten 60-ball 141 and Jos Buttler's 30-ball 83.Big scores remain the central objective for everyone involved - curators with batting-friendly pitches; lawmakers allowing broader bats and organisers promising run fest to bring fans to the stadiums or keep them hooked to the TV.The average score in the T20 format in the past five years reads: 281.81 (2021), 280.54 (2022), 288.00 (2023), 285.40 (2024) and 295.37 (2025). The year the first T20I was played (2005), the average was 275.19.Given the adulation they get, does that make a batter more attractive to the next generation of cricketers? Former West Indies speedster Ian Bishop doesn't think so.""I don't think everybody wants to be a batter. I still think there is room in the game for those who want to bowl fast, those who want to bowl wrist spin, those who want to bowl finger spin,"" said Bishop, who is a commentator in the ongoing ILT20.""Historically, and we go back to the inception of the game, batters have always been seen as the heroes and bowlers the villains. Even when I was playing that was always the battle,"" he continued to explain with a smile.""I do think you are absolutely right in the respect that the game kind of has drifted more and more in favour of the batters but I still think guys want to come through. And bowlers are an adaptable species. The more the game changes, the more bowlers will come up with plans to counter it. That has always been the ebb and flow of cricket generally - red ball or white ball or T20.""As administrators though, what I will agree with you on is that we have to do a better job of creating a better balance between bat and ball even in T20 cricket,"" he reasoned.This isn't the only radical change he wants to make to the modern game. The 58-year-old, who played 43 Test matches for the Windies, is a strong advocate for four-day Test matches.""I have long been in favour of 4-day Test cricket. This is especially true if you are going to have a World Test Championship (WTC) where results are imperative, necessitating pitches that yield results.""But the arguments against it from others is (about) weather impacting games and then there is no coming back. But if you ask me, I have long said publicly, I am a 4-day Test cricket fan.Here’s a rewritten version with the same meaning, but refreshed wording:The ICC had approved four-day Tests for bilateral series in 2017, with England facing Zimbabwe over four days at Trent Bridge last year, following four-day Tests against Ireland in 2019 and 2023. Four-day Tests have as yet not been played under the World Test Championship (WTC) format.Many smaller nations are hesitant to host Tests because of the time they require and the cost. However, shifting to four-day cricket could allow a full three-Test series to be completed in under three weeks. In four-day Tests, playing hours are extended to ensure a minimum of 98 overs per day (instead of 90) to help offset the time lost.","Former west indies cricketer ian bishop talks to media in sharjah during ilt20's qualifier 2.

How Kawhi Leonard's contract hit Clippers’ bench







After a spectacular season with Toronto Raptors in 2018-19, Kawhi Leonard decided to move closer to his house and signed with the LA Clippers. To make a championship worthy team, Leonard put forward the condition of acquiring another star player before signing, and the Clippers fulfilled it by getting Paul George in a blockbuster deal.With the league’s expansion, all eyes are always scanning the crowd for the next big trade, but Kawhi and the Clippers front office quietly handled their business back in early 2024 with a three-year, $149.5 million veteran extension. For all those die-hard fans of Leonard, this was a statement: Kawhi isn't going anywhere, and Steve Ballmer is more than willing to pay for that elite talent.Kawhi Leonard was drafted 15th overall by the Indiana Pacers in 2011 but was immediately traded to the San Antonio Spurs where he stayed till 2017-28 season. After joining the Raptors over a 1-year deal worth $23 million for 2018-19 season, Kawhi led the franchise to its first ever NBA championship and won his second Finals MVP.Since joining Clippers in 2019 on a 3-year $103 million contract that was active till 2021, the management and Leonardo decided to sign another maximum extension worth $176 million that would keep the latter in the team through 2024 season.On January 14 2024, Clippers via a social media post announced that they have signed another contract extension with Kawhi Leonard.It is a 3-year contract worth $149.5 million keeping Leonardo with the Clipper through the 2027 season.Through this deal, Leonard is guaranteed to earn $149.5 million with an average annual salary of $49 million in 2024. For the 2025-26 season, he will earn $50 million and $50.3 million for 2026-27. By the time the 2026-27 season wraps up, his career on-court earnings will cross past the $425 million mark becoming one of the highest on-court earners in NBA.From a front-office perspective, Kawhi’s contract is a massive anchor on the salary cap. Carrying a $50 million cap hit for each of the next two seasons means the Clippers are essentially living in the luxury tax. Because he signed for slightly below his absolute maximum, it gave the team just enough breathing room to keep guys like James Harden around, but let’s be real, the NBA’s CBA is always breathing down everyone’s necks.There’s no player option on the back end of this deal, meaning Kawhi is committed through 2027. For the fans, that’s the best part. They don't have to worry about ""opt-out"" rumors every summer. All they hope is that Kawhi Leonard stays healthy and fit and continues to perform dominantly on the court.Also read: Here are the 5 tallest players in today’s NBA: Victor Wembanyama, Zach Edey, and more","Kawhi leonard signed a three-year, $149.5 million veteran extension with the la clippers in january 2024.
