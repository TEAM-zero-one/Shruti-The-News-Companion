Cam Skattebo's viral moment provokes criticism over NFL history blind spot



Does Cam Skattebo know ball? 🧠

A generation gap or something more?







New York Giants first-year running back Cameron Skattebo became the focus of an unintended NFL tempest—nothing on the field, but for seemingly not knowing anything about the league's greatest legends. In one recent video making its rounds on the internet, Cameron Skattebo can't recognize NFL legends from their pictures, kicking off an emotional Reddit discussion in which fans toggle between anger and empathy.Cameron Skattebo, who played college football at Sacramento State Hornets and Arizona State Sun Devils before the New York Giants drafted him in the fourth round of the 2025 NFL Draft, soon found himself a topic of conversation on Reddit—but not the kind related to his athleticism.In one clip of him now circulating, Cameron Skattebo misidentifies players during a quiz segment. When presented with a picture of Calvin Johnson, better known as ‘Megatron,’ confusion set in.Redditors were both amused and frustrated. One of the top comments stated, “Not knowing Calvin is wild, but an NFL player not knowing Brett Favre is crazy ffs.”Another commenter joked, “Banish him from the league for this,” and others reluctantly empathized, one of them noting, “To be fair, though, Calvin retired when Skattebo woulda been like 13 or 14, and he wasn’t a guy who was in many commercials or broadcast booths.So it’s not thaaaat crazy with all that in mind.”The discussion soon escalated beyond Skattebo, with wider questions about how younger players identify with the history of the league. One commenter wrote that most players don't grow up watching the NFL but rather center on their own development or college careers. “A lot of these guys don't even follow the NFL til they get to the league. Might have been a college fan, or just doesn't watch football,” another Redditor wrote.Even fans conceded trouble identifying helmet-wearing players by face alone. “Not really. I wouldn’t recognize Joe Montana from face alone probably. I definitely wouldn’t recognize megatron from face alone. I think people here are forgetting these dudes play in helmets lol. Outside of a handful of players there’s probably not many non-Eagles I could recognize,” admitted one commenter.Nevertheless, the overall opinion was tilted towards incredulity, particularly in light of Johnson's place in NFL legend.Also Read: ‘I still have more to prove’: Giants rookie Cam Skattebo’s giant ambitions While the NFL fan base in turn roasted and justified Cameron Skattebo's viral blunder, the moment highlighted something greater—the transience of fame, the changing tides of fandom across generations, and the way legacy players disappear from popular consciousness sooner than we want them to.

2026 NBA All-Star Game to go global as Adam Silver greenlights United States versus World format

In a major move to inject new life into the NBA All-Star Game, Commissioner Adam Silver has confirmed that the 2026 edition will feature a “Team USA vs. Team World” format. The decision, designed to boost player motivation and fan engagement, marks a shift from recent attempts that failed to inspire competitive play. The game, set for February 15, 2026, in Inglewood, California, will be broadcast by NBC as part of the league’s new media deal and scheduled to air in the afternoon to align with Winter Olympic programming.Following years of experimenting with All-Star formats, from captain-led drafts to the recent four-team mini-tournament, the NBA is now embracing the league’s international identity to bring back intensity. Commissioner Adam Silver confirmed on FS1’s Breakfast Ball, “Next year, as part of our new media deal, the All-Star Game returns to NBC where it was when we were younger, and it so happens that next season will be smack in the middle of the Winter Olympics. ”Silver further explained, “The lead-in will be Winter Olympic events, and then coming out of the All-Star Game... more Olympic events. So what better time to feature some form of USA against the world?”While the format details are still being finalized, the commissioner admitted, “I’m not exactly sure what the format will be yet. I obviously paid a lot of attention to what the NHL did, which was a huge success.” The NHL’s Four Nations Face-Off has proven that national pride can transform showcase games into must-watch events.The league’s latest All-Star tournament in San Francisco was widely seen as a misfire. The 211–186 final score in 2024 showed the lack of effort. Even the introduction of mini-games and point targets couldn’t raise the stakes. But now, Silver believes he’s found the answer. “Last summer, our Olympic competition was a huge success... USA, Serbia — I loved watching it.”This shift comes with challenges. While about 70% of NBA players are American, the top international talent is undeniable. The last seven MVPs have all been international players. Fans are hyped, imagining Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, Nikola Jokic, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Victor Wembanyama, and Luka Doncic teaming up to challenge LeBron James , Stephen Curry, and Tyrese Haliburton.Also Read: Not $1.2 billion — LeBron James’ post-retirement priorities will melt every NBA fan’s heart International stars are already fired up. “I would love to. My opinion is that it’s more purposeful,” said Wembanyama in February. “There’s more pride in it. More stakes.” Giannis echoed the sentiment: “I think that would be the most interesting and most exciting format. I would love that... I think it would be fun. That would be the best format.”As Silver confirmed, fans might finally get a fiercely contested All-Star Game again.","The 2026 nba all-star game will feature a ""team usa vs. Team world"" format.

Zaya Wade and Dwyane Wade turn a birthday into a moment of support





Zaya and Dwyane Wade speak from the heart about their bond





On the surface, it looked like a glamorous 18th birthday bash, bright lights, bold fashion, and a buzzing Hollywood venue. But behind the sparkle, Zaya Wade’s big night held a powerful secret. With just a $20 entry ticket, guests weren’t only stepping into a party, they were stepping into a movement. Just days before Pride Month, Zaya, alongside her father Dwyane Wade, revealed something far bigger than a celebration. This wasn’t just a birthday. It was a mission disguised in glitter and grace.The event was called The Venus Ascension Ball. It happened just two days before Pride Month started. The location was NeueHouse in Hollywood, California. Zaya planned the night with a clear goal. Tickets cost $20, and every dollar went to Translatable, a platform she created in 2023 with her dad, Dwyane Wade.Translatable is a digital space that supports LGBTQ+ youth. It offers tools, education, and personal stories. It helps young people feel seen and gives families guidance to support them.Many people came to the ball. Dwyane Wade was there. So was his wife, actress Gabrielle Union , and their daughter, Kaavia Wade.The family showed love and support the whole night.Big brands also helped out. MAC Cosmetics gave $100,000 to the Trans Wellness Center in Zaya’s honor. Other sponsors included H&M, the Utah Jazz, and Folx Health.The Trans Wellness Center, run by Marian Marroquin, was the nonprofit partner. It helps trans people in Los Angeles with health care, housing, and education.The party wasn’t just about raising money. It was a true ball. Guests dressed up. There were runway contests with $15,000 in cash prizes. Zaya wore a strapless beaded gown, then changed into a short lace dress. Her cake showed The Birth of Venus, a painting about beauty and new life.Zaya later said, “It was indescribable. Imagine an explosion of love and light wrapped up into one magical night.”Zaya’s family has supported her from the start. She came out as transgender in 2020, at just 12 years old. At the time, the Wades were living in Florida. But due to new laws against LGBTQ+ rights, they moved to California. Dwyane Wade said, “The community wasn’t here for Zaya, so the community wasn’t here for us.”In May 2024, Dwyane Wade shared a podcast where Zaya joined him as a guest. They talked about their close bond. Dwyane said people don’t see how much they work together.He also shared that they received the Elevate Prize Catalyst Award. This award supports their mission to helpLGBTQ+ youth. Dwyane explained that Translatable gives these young people a safe online place to connect. It also helps families learn how to support them.Zaya’s birthday looked like a party. But it was really about hope, love, and a strong mission.Also Read: Why does the NBA trophy bear Larry O’Brien’s Name?

Jordan Ott's Appointment Marks a New Era for Phoenix Suns





The Phoenix Suns named Jordan Ott, the previous assistant coach for the Cleveland Cavaliers, as their new head coach. Both Booker and Ott were involved in the thorough search that preceded the appointment and Booker ultimately acknowledged Ott as his elected choice. Because of Ott’s background and inspiring coaching, the Suns are hoping to inject new life into their team and compete at a higher level in the NBA.The Suns' choice to bring on Jordan Ott highlights their dedication to refreshing the team's strategy both on the court and beyond. Starting his NBA coaching career in 2013 as a video coordinator for the Atlanta Hawks, Ott has built up significant experience with teams such as the Brooklyn Nets, Los Angeles Lakers, and lately, the Cleveland Cavaliers. His stint with the Cavaliers was particularly remarkable; they posted a league-leading 64-18 record in the 2024–25 season and had an offensive rating of 121.7, one of the highest ever recorded in the NBA.The length of the hiring process was extensive and there were more than 15 first round interviews and six finalists which included potentially well known coaching names such as Johnnie Bryant, Chris Quinn and David Fizdale.It was between Ott and Bryant who rose to the top as the main candidates and who both had a wealth of experience from their time with the Cavaliers. That decision finally was reached after in person discussions with team owner Mat Ishbia, CEO Josh Bartelstein and GM Brian Gregory.With these conversations, Devin Booker’s role in the discourse suggests that the organization is highlighting this idea of things like making sure, the choices that you are making to lead the organization align with the insights of the most important constituents that you have within the organization.The Suns have to decide whether to keep their players or look for new ones now that Ott is their new head coach. It has been said that there is a possibility the team will trade their All-Star forward Kevin Durant, as many teams seem interested in him this offseason.Also, with the 29th and 52nd picks coming up, the Suns can gain more talent in the draft. The team will need Ott’s understanding of player development to help with these process changes.Also Read: New York Knicks part ways with head coach Tom Thibodeau after historic Eastern Conference Finals run and best season in 25 years Backed by franchise star Devin Booker and a front office dedicated to careful rebuilding, Ott is ready to lead the Suns during this transformative phase.

I felt like that is where my identity was supposed to be, so I just kind of put all of the eggs into that basket.”During an interview with the reputed media outlet Essence back in 2023, Savannah James spoke about how she coped with her three kids, Bronny, Bryce, and Zhuri, growing up and leaving for their respective colleges. She said,“With Bronny going away to college and Bryce being right there as a junior in high school and Zhuri now being nine years old, a fresh nine years old, they have a good grasp of what our family dynamic is and what is expected of them.”She further explained-“So, I don’t feel like I have to be a helicopter mom per se, and I’m able to go out and just act on my passions and to put my foot out into new things that interest me. So I think that it’s mostly that, just knowing that the groundwork has been laid, and I feel good about the position that I’ve left them in. So I feel comfortable with seeing where my passions are able to take me.”LeBron James and Savannah James recently celebrated a new milestone in their second eldest son, Bryce Maximus’ life, who went on to complete his high school in Sierra Canyon. Bronny James was drafted by the Los Angeles Lakers in 2024, and their little daughter Zhuri has gravitated towards the game of volleyball. Both Savannah James and the Los Angeles Lakers' star are very supportive with respect to their kids Bronny, Bryce and Zhuri's career in sports and academics.

'A particularly special feeling': Andy Flower hails Virat Kohli, RCB after historic title win





NEW DELHI: The celebrations were in full swing outside Bengaluru's M Chinnaswamy Stadium, with loud cheers, hoots, and roaring chants filling the air as fans gathered in massive numbers to catch a glimpse of their victorious Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) stars. The scenes reflected the joy of a fanbase that had waited 18 years for this moment. On Tuesday night, RCB clinched their maiden IPL title with a six-run win over Punjab Kings in a thrilling final at a packed Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad.For franchise icon Virat Kohli , who has been with RCB since the league’s inception in 2008, it was a particularly significant milestone—finally lifting the trophy after years of near misses.RCB players are scheduled to meet Karnataka Chief Minister Siddaramaiah on Wednesday, after which they will head to their home ground, M Chinnaswamy Stadium, for a fan engagement event. Huge crowds have already assembled at the stadium, hoping to witness the team’s moment of glory up close.The Karnataka State Cricket Association has organised a special felicitation ceremony for the RCB squad at the stadium to honour their historic achievement.In videos circulating on social media, the crowd outside the stadium grew so large that Karnataka Police had to use mild force to manage the swelling numbers and maintain order.Tragedy struck during the RCB victory celebrations at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium, as reports indicate that seven people, including a child, lost their lives in a stampede. Over 25 others have sustained injuries in the incident, with six individuals reported to be in critical condition.Earlier in the day, the Rajat Patidar-led team was received at the airport by Karnataka Deputy Chief Minister D.K. Shivakumar. As the players made their way to the Chief Minister’s office at Vidhana Soudha, fans lined the streets, cheering their champions with unbridled enthusiasm.However, the much-awaited open-top bus parade from Vidhana Soudha to the stadium may be cancelled due to heavy traffic congestion, according to a tweet by Bengaluru Traffic Police. The city's rainy weather and the challenges of crowd control—especially following last night's massive celebrations—also contributed to the uncertainty around the parade.That said, the parade could still happen if Chief Minister Siddaramaiah grants special permission. The open-top bus remains parked near his office, awaiting the final nod.","Royal challengers bengaluru (rcb) won their maiden ipl title on tuesday night.

Controversy around the Imane Khelif’s gold medal at Paris Olympic



IOC calls findings misinformation



Response of World Boxing

Fairness and safety concerns from athletes and federations



Ongoing debate on gender and sport eligibility





A leaked medical report from the 2023 World Championships has revealed that Olympic boxing champion Imane Khelifis biologically male, according to chromosome analysis. The report, made public just days after World Boxing ordered Khelif to undergo sex testing for eligibility in future female competitions, shows she has a male XY karyotype. This revelation challenges the International Olympic Committee’s (IOC) earlier dismissal of such tests and has intensified debate over fairness and safety in women’s boxing. The findings come amid ongoing controversy surrounding Khelif’s participation in women’s events, sparking calls for stricter verification procedures in sport.The report, published on the 3 Wire Sports website, states that Khelif’s chromosome analysis is “abnormal” and confirms a male karyotype. It was conducted by Dr Lal PathLabs in New Delhi, a lab accredited by the American College of Pathologists and certified by the International Organisation for Standardisation. This directly challenges the IOC’s spokesperson Mark Adams, who had described such test results as “ad hoc” and “not legitimate” during a press conference at the Paris Olympics.The controversy surrounding Imane Khelif ’s Olympic gold medal run began as early as her first bout in Paris, where she faced Italy’s Angela Carini.Carini, an experienced and respected boxer, was visibly shaken during the match. Overwhelmed by Khelif’s strength and intensity, she appeared distressed and left the ring in tears after the fight, later telling media she had feared for her safety. The unease only deepened in the final bout, where Khelif defeated Taiwan’s Lin Yu-ting in a dominant display that many felt was physically one-sided. The power difference between the fighters drew sharp criticism, with commentators and athletes calling it “uncomfortable to watch” and likening it to watching a man beat a woman in the ring. The moment became one of the most controversial of the Paris Games, fuelling an international debate over fairness and inclusion in women’s sport.IOC president Thomas Bach dismissed the report as part of a Russian-led misinformation campaign, citing ethical and financial issues within the International Boxing Association (IBA), which conducted the tests. Despite these claims, the legitimacy of the Indian lab’s certification has increased pressure on the IOC to clarify its position and respond to questions about Khelif’s eligibility.Following the leak, World Boxing has declared that Khelif must pass mandatory chromosome testing before competing in any future female events. The 26-year-old Olympic champion, who was allowed to compete in Paris due to her female passport status, has so far not provided evidence to confirm female chromosomes. World Boxing now requires all athletes over 18 in its competitions to undergo PCR genetic testing to verify their sex, a measure introduced in response to this controversy.The case has raised serious safety and fairness concerns within the boxing community. Opponents like Italy’s Angela Carini and Mexico’s Brianda Tamara have spoken out about the physical challenges they faced competing against Khelif. Latin American federations have been particularly vocal, urging that women’s competitions be restricted to athletes assigned female at birth, in order to protect fairness and athlete safety.The Khelif controversy highlights the complex and sensitive issues surrounding transgender and intersex athletes in competitive sport. It underscores the need for clear, consistent policies that balance inclusivity with fairness and safety. As governing bodies reassess their rules, the case remains a key example of the challenges faced in maintaining the integrity of women’s sports.The ongoing debate around Imane Khelif’s case brings to light just how complex and emotionally charged the conversation about gender and eligibility in sport has become. At the heart of it are real athletes — women who train for years and step into the ring expecting fairness. Many feel blindsided and unheard when competing against opponents whose physical attributes raise legitimate concerns about safety and equality. This isn’t about exclusion, but about protecting hard-won opportunities for women in sport. Khelif’s story reminds us that governing bodies must act transparently, thoughtfully, and with empathy for all athletes involved.",Imane khelif ’s medical report contradicts ioc’s official position.
