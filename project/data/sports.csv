2025 has been a year of several wonderful games, and titles like Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 and Ghost of Yotei were the main highlights. However, the year also featured some highly-anticipated games that were pretty abysmal. Such games are the perfect reminder that massive budgets cannot guarantee success.The best example would be MindsEye, which failed to resonate with audiences and was massively unsuccessful. Listed below are five big-budget titles from 2025 that ended up failing.Developed by Build a Rocket Boy and led by former Rockstar North president Leslie Benzies, MindsEye was marketed as a GTA killer. However, its launch was a technical disaster, and the game was plagued by bugs, janky AI, and poor mission design.With a devastating Metacritic score, the game was widely criticized for its lack of polish and personality. The failure was so severe that it was called one of the worst launches of the decade, resulting in widespread refunds on Steam and PlayStation.Call of Duty released back-to-back Black Ops titles in 2024 and 2025, and this decision backfired spectacularly with Black Ops 7. The game was torn by critics and fans for its reinvention of the campaign mode.They essentially made the story always-online and co-op focused, removing the classic cinematic pacing.Added to this, the inability to pause, even in solo play, and a lack of checkpoints turned the campaign into one of the worst in the franchise's history.While Monster Hunter Wilds was a content-rich success on consoles, its PC port became a symbol of technical failure. Even months after launch, the game remains poorly optimized, suffering from heavy stuttering and blurry visuals regardless of hardware.The reliance on aggressive upscaling, like DLSS, to even achieve playable frame rates led to extremely bad player feedback. Despite being a commercial hit initially, sales dropped off after the word of the technical issues spread.Obsidian’s Avowed suffered from an identity crisis throughout its long development. Originally teased as a dark, Skyrim-like open world, the final product was scaled down into a colorful, zone-based RPG that many felt lacked soul.Following multiple creative reboots and a director change, the game was quite disappointing. Even though it is technically playable, the shallow dialogues and repetitive combat failed to engage the audience.Remedy Entertainment usually releases some of the best games; however, they failed to do so with FBC: Firebreak. The game was basically sold as a multiplayer co-op successor to Control, but simply ended up being a generic shooter without any inventive content.FBC: Firebreak didn’t have the narrative magic of the Remedy Connected Universe, resulting in a lot of disappointment. With a very low active player count on Steam after release, it struggled to justify its existence alongside the more prestigious titles from Remedy.",Big budget 2025 games that failed to resonate with audiences.

Draymond Green goes candid on Steve Kerr altercation calling it a “huge moment of growth”,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/draymond-green-goes-candid-on-steve-kerr-altercation-calling-it-a-huge-moment-of-growth/articleshow/126177971.cms,"Draymond Green with Golden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr (Image via: Getty Images)

How Draymond Green's stepping away from conflict marked a defining moment?



Draymond Green’s candid reflection highlights maturity as the Golden State Warriors focusses on legacy

Draymond Green has never shied away from expressing his emotions or his feelings, and that spark has long been part of what defines him as a distinct player of the Golden State Warriors. However, one altercation with head coach Steve Kerr became more than just a matter of intense talk inside the NBA. Speaking candidly, Draymond Green described the incident as a moment of self-growth, showing a sight of self-reflection from a player who is often known for speaking his heart out.According to Draymond Green, this whole situation taught him a big lesson, making him understand when to step away rather than escalating and intensifying an already intense situation. He went on to explain that he did not in any way want one thing to become two, explaining how quickly words spoken in anger could create further damage to the reputation of a player. By removing himself and choosing to stay quiet, Green felt that he protected not only the integrity of the team but also his years-long relationship with Kerr.For a veteran player like Draymond Green, his decision to remove himself from the entire situation is quite impactful.Because the Warriors have built their team as well as their legacy based on trust and values carried forward by Kerr as their head coach. Thus, for Green, understanding what words to choose in a crucial situation such as this, and understanding when emotions cross their lines, is very important, especially given his influence over his younger teammates, watching him, and learning how to respond under pressure.The incident also highlighted one important learning that no matter how professional one is on-court, it doesn't define their off-court impact and the weight they carry as a part of their career. Green also acknowledged that some words, “you can’t come back from tomorrow”, reflected his maturity and his presence of mind that he has gained through his years of experience in the big league. Rather than getting frustrated and gaining unnecessary public attention, he chose to remain silent, reflecting upon the importance of emotional control and self-esteem, which one needs to maintain as an athlete.At this stage, what matters most for Green is his evolution as a player, as his career demands him. The Warriors are no longer just running after winning games, but they are trying to create a legacy of their own. And Green’s self-reflection on an intense situation like this is proof that in a league as big as the NBA, it is important to maintain personality and growth not just on the court but also off it.By openly talking about the altercation, Draymond Green also sent a very powerful message that, rather than playing blame games, it is important for a player to focus on their own game and choose their words wisely. In a league where there is trash talk going on, almost on a regular basis, his words showed a sign of responsibility and strength. For the Golden State Warriors, this incident could be taken as a moment to build trust between players and the coach, turning an intense situation into a meaningful one.Also Read: ""It was actually amazing” – Warriors’ Draymond Green loved his 12-game suspension for heartfelt Christmas moment","Golden state warriors forward draymond green was involved in an altercation with head coach steve kerr.

NHL Player Philip Danault has opened up for the first time after his trade from the Los Angeles Kings to the Montreal Canadiens in a major trade recently. The trade of Danault to the Montreal Canadians has raised serious concerns, as he played extremely well when he arrived in Los Angeles, but his overall play has tapered off.With the trade, the center will again play for the Montreal Canadiens, where he played from 2015-16 through 2020-21. This is a homecoming for Danault, who hails from Victoriaville, PQ, which is less than two hours from Montreal. Reports state that it has been almost a week since the Los Angeles Kings traded Phillip Danault to the Montreal Canadiens. While both sides have moved on, Danault made his season debut for the Canadiens on Tuesday. Let’s take a look at what Danault had to say about this trade to the Canadiens. Phillip Danault has spoken for the first time since the Los Angeles Kings traded him to the Montreal Canadiens. In his statement, it seemed that the former LA Kings center wasn't pleased with the way he was handled ahead of his return to Montreal. Ahead of Danault's return to Montreal, he spoke to the media for the first time since the trade was announced and discussed what led to his departure.Speaking to mediapersons in French, Danault stated, ""I felt like I had no purpose and that I couldn't bring anything to the team with what I had. I felt helpless and not important. That's how I felt at the end.""Previously, while speaking to the NHL, he stated, ""I feel like chaos right now,"" Danault said. ""I am moving my kids, my wife, we have a house there, selling the house, everything. So a big change, for Christmas especially. But I feel good. It was obviously tough towards the end in L.A., and did not feel well at all.""Danault further expressed optimistically, ""So a good start, a good, fresh start for me. I'm really happy to be here. Went from the oldest group to the youngest in the NHL. It's kind of a weird stat, but it's true, and I'm happy to be one of the mature guys here.""Danault became the Canadiens' second-oldest player behind Brendan Gallagher after he was traded back to the team for whom he played from 2016-21. Earlier, Danault signed a six-year, $33 million contract ($5.5 million average annual value) with the Kings on July 28, 2021, and has one more year remaining after this season.According to the NHL, Danault had 194 points (54 goals, 140 assists) in 360 games when he played with the LA Kings. Apart from this, he had 195 points (70 goals, 125 assists) in his first four seasons in Los Angeles over 319 games. But this season has marked a downturn in his offensive production, with zero goals and five assists in 30 games.","Phillip danault was traded to montreal canadiens from la kings in a major trade move.

Detroit Lions QB Jared Goff’s wife Christen reveals how motherhood inspired a complete makeover of both family homes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/detroit-lions-qb-jared-goffs-wife-christen-reveals-how-motherhood-inspired-a-complete-makeover-of-both-family-homes/articleshow/126112162.cms,"Jared Goff wife (Instagram and Getty Images)

Jared Goff ’s wife, Christen, creates two homes with one heart

Detroit Lions star Jared Goff’s wife, Christen, stepped into motherhood with the same intention she brings to every part of her life. Since welcoming daughter Romy, her days have been shaped by movement between two cities, two homes, and one new priority. While her husband leads the Detroit Lions on the field, Christen has been quietly redefining what home means during one of the biggest transitions of her life.Life now unfolds between Los Angeles and Michigan, places tied deeply to the couple’s journey. One carries the rhythm of the ocean, the other the warmth of Midwest winters. With a newborn in tow, those spaces needed to feel safe, calm, and deeply personal. Christen approached that challenge not as a checklist, but as an emotional reset that reflects who they are becoming as a family.For Christen Goff, adapting both houses meant, honoring their personalities while making room for Romy. She openly admits she is learning as she goes, sharing, “We’re so lucky to be able to live in two different places.” In California, where she grew up, the home leans into light and air. “I grew up in California, and there, we live by the beach, so our house kind of reflects that,” she says. “We live steps away from the ocean so our house definitely has more of a coastal feel, very indoor-outdoor, which we love.ID@undefinedCaption not available.ID@undefinedCaption not available.ID@undefinedCaption not available.ID@undefinedCaption not available.ID@undefinedCaption not available.ID@undefinedCaption not available.ID@undefinedCaption not available.Michigan tells a different story. “And then here in Michigan, our house is a little bit more cozy, kind of farmhouse country. We always have the fireplace going, even in the summer, which is kind of insane, but I would say that this house is so cozy and it just makes me want to cuddle up on the couch and watch a movie.” Each space now includes a nursery that mirrors its surroundings. “In L.A., it’s, like, boho, Bohemian,” she explains. “We have some fun antiques in there.” Michigan’s nursery leans softer. “And then this one is a little more classy,” she says. “Her nursery is so sweet here. It's very, like, muted pink tones. I went full into the girly pink.”As the holidays approach, Michigan will host Romy’s first Christmas. “We are here in Michigan through this season, so we're here, we'll be celebrating here, which is great,” Christen says, adding, “I love a California Christmas by the beach, but nothing beats a fireplace rolling with snow outside and your Christmas tree lit.”Behind the scenes, motherhood has brought exhaustion and joy in equal measure. “I feel like it's a roller coaster a bit,” she admits. Laundry piles up, routines shift, and patience gets tested. Still, perspective grounds her. “My key is chipping away day by day at everything,” she explains. “Just doing what you can and giving yourself grace.”In this season, Christen Goff has found belonging in a new circle. “I feel like I'm part of this new club of women and we all have something in common,” she says. “Moms are superheroes.” And now, Lions are out of playoff run and Goff's dream of winning Super Bowl ends here this year.Also Read: Travis Hunter’s wife Leanna turns heads in chic white bikini selfie during family birthday celebration","Detroit lions star jared goff’s wife, christen, stepped into motherhood with the same intention she brings to every part of her life.

Samoa Joe’s wrestling earnings, contracts, and overall net worth

All about Jessica Seanoa and their financial legacy

On a more personal note, the story of Nuufolau “Samoan Joe” Seanoa’s journey as a professional wrestler is exceptional. Yet Joe’s life with his wife, Jessica Seanoa, who also experienced the best and worst of Joe’s wrestling careers following the couple’s marriage back in 2007, reflects a world of its own. When considering the net worth of the married couple as of the year 2025, not only have the earnings from Joe’s wrestling contracts been considered, but the life that the couple has collectively experienced from the realities of the wrestling landscape also impacts the net worth as a whole.As of 2025, there are public estimates of Samoa Joe’s net worth, and they are estimated to be anywhere in the range of US$4 million to US$5 million, primarily generated from his extensive experience as a professional wrestler. Although in previous years, there were indications that his net worth would be higher in value, there are indications that his income is within the expected amount in the sport of professional wrestling, among those who are not among the best in the world. Joe has been earning money from his various contracts as a professional wrestler for TNA/Impact Wrestling, WWE, and currently for All Elite Wrestling (AEW), where he is still active as of 2025.Joe's professional income can thus be stated to be based on wrestling salaries, historically estimated to be around US$800,000 every year in WWE and possibly lower in his later contracts, and possibly supplemented by any acting engagements that come along due to his well-known name and quite eventful career. These acting roles might result in video game and TV-related roles that give Joe an occasional boost to his earnings.Jessica Seanoa has avoided the limelight of the wrestling world, living a private life with her husband. There is no known publicly available estimation of her net worth as an individual since she is not known within the public realm as a professional earner in her own right, but exists as a beneficiary of the life brought about through the wrestling career of her husband. Jessica married her husband in 2007.Taken together in 2025, their financial situation is centered on Joe’s wrestling career earnings and prudent decisions that come with age and a career that is physically demanding. Not one of the richest monikers in professional sports entertainment by any means, their experience is a reminder that a legacy is truly found in life after sports, and that finances in the sport look nothing like they do when one is under the bright lights that so many in other industries imagine.Also Read: Drew McIntyre and Kaitlyn Frohnapfel combined net worth in 2025: WWE success, fitness career, endorsement","Samoa joe’s wrestling earnings, contracts, and overall net worth are estimated to be anywhere in the range of us$4 million to us$5 million.

Although distance and trajectory often take center stage, exit velocity reveals the real tale of raw power, it shows how quickly the ball departs from the bat.In the last ten years, a few power hitters have changed the game by hitting baseballs with such force that it feels like they’re breaking the laws of physics, leaving fans in awe. Big names like Giancarlo Stanton and Aaron Judge are at the top of these stats, but players like Oneil Cruz and Ronald Acuña Jr. have also made their mark with swings that fans will never forget.Oneil‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌ Cruz was the one who created a great moment in baseball history when he launched a solo homerun to the Milwaukee Brewers at PNC Park in Pittsburgh on May 25, 2025. The blast was so powerful that it was measured at a stunning 122.9 mph off the bat, thus recording the highest exit velocity of a home run in the Statcast era. As a matter of fact, it is also the hardest-hit batted ball and base hit which has been recorded since the tracking began in ‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌2015.The scene was a midseason game for the Pirates, who were in the hunt for a wild-card spot in the National League. Cruz, famous for his impressive exit velocities over the years, had just hit a 117.9 mph homer two days earlier on May 23, and he made contact with a fastball from Brewers pitcher Freddy Peralta.The ball zipped over the left-field wall quickly, flying about 432 feet even with the high speed, which usually leads to shorter but straight-line paths. This hit broke past old records and showcased Cruz's special mix of strength and bat speed, honed during his days in the Pirates' minor leagues, where he was recorded throwing 105.3 mph from the outfield.On August 9, 2018, Giancarlo Stanton hit a massive 121.7 mph shot, landing him in second place during a home game against the Texas Rangers at Yankee Stadium. This two-run homer in the third inning off Doug Fister marked Stanton's third straight game with a home run, highlighting his position as the main power hitter for the New York Yankees that summer.The Yankees were deep in the AL East pennant chase, trailing only a few games behind their rivals, the Boston Red Sox. With Aaron Judge out due to a wrist chip fracture he got in late July, Stanton took on the offensive responsibility, hitting the ball with power.On a warm Bronx evening, the ball soared into the second deck of the left-field seats, traveling a distance that highlighted Stanton's incredible strength, which he developed during his time with the Marlins when he snagged the 2017 NL MVP award.Stanton makes another appearance at No. 3 with a massive 121.3 mph hit on July 25, 2020, against the Washington Nationals at Nationals Park. This solo home run happened during the Yankees' second game of the shortened 60-game season due to the pandemic, off a pitch from Nationals starter Erick Fedde in the fourth inning.New York was getting used to a hub-based schedule in Washington, D.C., while following COVID-19 protocols, as the team looked to bounce back from their 2019 ALCS exit. Stanton's home run almost equaled his personal best for hardest-hit homer at that moment, flying an estimated 483 feet, his longest since he joined the Yankees in December 2018 and the second-longest of his career. The projected trajectory brought back memories of his time in Miami, where he often hit bombs over 450 feet.On September 2, 2023, Ronald Acuña Jr. capped off the top four with a blazing 121.2 mph shot during a road game against the Los Angeles Dodgers at Dodger Stadium. The Atlanta Braves outfielder crushed a fastball from Dodgers rookie Emmet Sheehan, sending it 454 feet to dead center in the sixth inning, a solo homer that contributed to a 6-1 win.The Braves were on track for their sixth consecutive NL East title, with Acuña just having made history on August 31 as the first player in MLB to hit 30 homers and steal 60 bases in a season—what's known as the ""30-60 club."" Just two days later, he hit another homer during a crucial interleague series against the NL West-leading Dodgers, highlighting Atlanta's offensive strength driven by Acuña, Matt Olson, and Austin Riley.Aaron Judge makes the top five with a massive 121.1 mph homer on June 10, 2017, against the Baltimore Orioles at Yankee Stadium. This three-run shot in the first inning off Orioles pitcher Chris Tillman capped off a rally that saw 10 Yankees come to the plate, resulting in an 8-1 blowout.The Yankees were on fire in the AL East, riding a wave of young talent during Judge's breakout rookie year, where he smashed 52 home runs and snagged the AL Rookie of the Year award. This home run came during what MLB.com called an 'offensive deluge,' as New York scored six runs in that inning to turn around an early deficit.Also Read: Chicago White Sox GM Chris Getz reveals how the team plans to address Munetaka Murakami’s high strikeout rate","Giancarlo stanton hit a 449-ft. home run at 121.7 mph on august 9, 2018.

Stephen Curry praises Cooper Flagg after Mavericks loss



Cooper Flagg performance shines on Christmas stage



Cooper Flagg’s first Christmas Day appearance puts him under immense pressure. The Dallas Mavericks rookie did not lose his cool despite the team being hit with a major Anthony Davis injury setback. Flagg delivered his most complete performance on one of the league’s biggest stages against the veteran Golden State Warriors team.The Mavericks fell 126-116 in San Francisco, but Flagg’s impact stood out well beyond the final score. His composure, shot selection, and control in traffic drew attention throughout the game. After the final buzzer, Stephen Curry offered some kind words for Flagg.Stephen Curry, who led the Warriors with 23 points and sealed the game late with a deep three-pointer, took time after the game to recognize Cooper Flagg’s presence and mindset.""Just a true hooper. Competitor. He forgets how young he is. The future is bright, I'm glad that he got this experience his first year. The league is in good hands,"" Curry said after the game.Curry hit nine free throws and navigated defensive pressure, while Flagg matched him possession for possession during key moments. Golden State leaned on balanced scoring, including 14 points from Al Horford and 16 from DeAnthony Melton, to secure its third straight win.Flagg finished with a game-high 27 points on 13-for-21 shooting, adding six rebounds and a team-leading five assists in his Christmas Day debut. He scored at all three levels, attacked closeouts, and created opportunities when Golden State’s defense tightened. His lone three-pointer came within the flow of the offense, and his decision-making kept Dallas within reach during key stretches.The Mavericks faced challenges early after Anthony Davis exited in the second quarter with right groin spasms. With Dallas losing a primary option, Flagg assumed added responsibility. During a prolonged second-half run where the Warriors struggled from deep, Dallas trimmed the deficit to six points with 4:28 remaining. Flagg’s poise fueled that push, even as Golden State ultimately regained control behind timely plays from Curry and Gary Payton II.Dallas made only four three-pointers as a team and was outscored heavily from beyond the arc. Even so, Flagg’s efficiency and command helped stabilize the offense. P.J. Washington recorded 14 points and 10 rebounds, while Brandon Williams added 26 off the bench.Also Read: Karl-Anthony Towns makes Jordyn Woods’ Christmas unforgettable with a skyline proposal","Stephen curry praises cooper flagg after mavericks loss to golden state warriors.

NEW DELHI: Vaibhav Sooryavanshi created history with a stunning performance in the Vijay Hazare Trophy on Wednesday. Playing for Bihar in their first Plate Group match of the 2025–26 season, the 14-year-old opener produced one of the most remarkable innings ever seen in domestic cricket Sooryavanshi smashed 190 runs from just 84 balls against Arunachal Pradesh. He opened the batting for the Sakibul Gani-led Bihar side and completely dominated the bowlers from the start.During his explosive knock, he hit 16 fours and 15 sixes, showing confidence and power well beyond his age.With this innings, Sooryavanshi achieved a unique world record.

However, by the end of the day, his effort slipped to fourth place after Sakibul Gani and Ishan Kishan scored even faster centuries in 32 and 33 balls respectively.The young batter was not done even after reaching his hundred. He raced to 150 runs in just 59 balls, breaking another major record. This effort helped him surpass AB de Villiers’ record for the fastest 150 in List A cricket. De Villiers had taken 64 balls to reach the mark during the 2015 ODI World Cup match between South Africa and West Indies.Sooryavanshi’s knock played a huge role in Bihar posting a massive total, which later became a world record score of 574 in List A cricket.

But I again want to ask a question. There is a huge divide, chalk and cheese, in terms of quality with some teams. It becomes very lop-sided with some teams and there is no contest at all,"" Ashwin said.""It is not an ideal contest. Credit to Vaibhav for his performance. He is doing what he has to do. But if we are serious about teams like Arunachal Pradesh becoming good sides, what will this do to their confidence?""In the match, Bihar completely dominated Arunachal Pradesh.Along with Sooryavanshi (190 off 84 balls), Ayush Loharuka (116 off 56 balls) and captain Sakibul Gani (128 off 40 balls) also scored centuries.Ashwin also spoke about Ishan Kishan and praised his comeback journey. He said Kishan’s recent success shows the importance of hard work and patience.“Everyone goes through good and bad times but Ishan Kishan had a challenging time. He came and then was out from the team, he took a break. He made a double hundred in one-day but never made a comeback. He scored a hundred in the IPL but then did not have a great IPL,"" Ashwin added.""He played well in the SMAT and in the run of events got into the T20 World Cup squad.

Dak Prescott’s Christmas gesture on Hard Knocks unveils a refreshing insight into the Cowboys amidst a disappointing season,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/dak-prescotts-christmas-gesture-on-hard-knocks-unveils-a-refreshing-insight-into-the-cowboys-amidst-a-disappointing-season/articleshow/126160331.cms,"Dak Prescott (via Getty Images)

A brief Hard Knocks moment that revealed how Dak Prescott leads when things are hard

The Dallas Cowboys did not expect a somber atmosphere as December is about to come to a close. Between a Christmas Day game streaming on Netflix and HBO’s in-season Hard Knocks focusing on the NFC East, Dallas has become one of the league’s most visible teams. The season opened with championship-level expectations but delivered shocking losses, uneven execution, and growing tension in the team dynamics.Amidst the frustrations, QB Dak Prescott recently had an inspiring and generous statement to share with his teammates. The QB put the focus on the support staff that has supported them time and time again, despite the results, and urged the team to make donations to them for the holidays.This show of inspiring leadership and big-heartedness from Prescott was seen in a short teaser from this week’s Hard Knocks episode. The QB stood in front of his teammates with a message that had nothing to do with the team’s stats. He encouraged players to donate money toward bonuses for the Cowboys’ support staff.Prescott pushed the group to give generously and reminded them “not to hold back during the holidays.” The clip struck a nerve with fans because it showed awareness at a time when frustration could easily turn inward.NFL support staff often work grueling hours with little public recognition, and their compensation does not always match the demands of the job.The NFL Players Association has raised this issue repeatedly, and Prescott’s message felt like action following those words. The Hard Knocks doc has shown the emotional weight of a season for the Cowboys that has not gone the way they hoped.

The Detroit Lions face a crucial Christmas Day test against the Minnesota Vikings in Week 17, and one name Lions fans have been closely tracking is running back David Montgomery. With playoff hopes still mathematically alive, Detroit will want as many key contributors available as possible - and Montgomery’s status has been a late-week talking point.Montgomery was added to the injury report earlier this week due to an illness rather than a physical injury. While illnesses can sometimes linger or worsen late in the week, the Lions have not indicated that Montgomery is dealing with anything severe. Importantly, he avoided the injured reserve list and has remained around the team throughout the week.The illness surfaced after Montgomery practiced in full earlier in the week. He then missed a session before returning in a limited capacity, which ultimately led to the Lions listing him as questionable for the Week 17 matchup.Despite the questionable tag, Montgomery’s practice participation points toward optimism. After sitting out earlier in the week, he was able to log a limited practice on Wednesday. That return to the field is often viewed as a positive sign, especially when the issue is illness rather than something structural like a hamstring or ankle injury.NFL teams are typically cautious when it comes to illnesses, but it’s relatively uncommon for a player of Montgomery’s importance to miss a must-win game solely because of sickness, particularly when there are signs of improvement.Final confirmation will come when the Lions and Vikings release their inactive lists roughly 90 minutes before kickoff.Based on the available information, Montgomery appears more likely to play than sit. His limited practice late in the week and the nature of the injury both point in that direction. However, even if active, expectations should be tempered.Montgomery’s workload has dipped in recent weeks, and he has not seen consistent double-digit carries since midseason. That trend is unlikely to change dramatically, especially with Gibbs continuing to dominate snaps.As of now, it looks like Montgomery will be ready to play for the Lions in Week 17 against the Vikings. Nothing is definite until the inactives are revealed, but all indicators point to Detroit expecting him to play. It's still unclear if that will have a big effect on the field, but just having him there would help the Lions try to keep their season going.","The detroit lions face the minnesota vikings on christmas day.
