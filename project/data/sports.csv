A legacy with something to prove returns for a third try at DCC

Emotional fallout, a strained friendship, and a quiet comeback

Dayton Bramhall's journey with the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders has been anything but easy — and her story has become one of the most emotional arcs in Season 2 of Netflix's America’s Sweethearts: Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders. A third-time auditionee and daughter of longtime DCC associate choreographer Shelly Bramhall, Dayton came into the 2024 training camp with the weight of a legacy and the pressure to finally make the team. But after once again being cut, the young dancer made a decision that would redefine her identity beyond the DCC brand.Raised in McKinney, Texas, Dayton Bramhall has been immersed in the world of the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders her entire life. Her mother, Shelly, was part of the DCC class of 1989 and has served as a key figure on the staff for years. That connection, however, didn’t secure Dayton a spot. “None of us want you to make this team just because you have a history,” director Kelli Finglass told her bluntly. “You need to earn to make this team. ”Despite showing improvement and passion during her audition, Bramhall struggled with memorizing choreography and keeping up with the precision and power expected at the elite level.“There’s one that just won’t stick in my body, but I’ll get it,” she said during training camp. Unfortunately, the veterans didn’t believe she was ready — and Finglass ultimately told her it would be a “disservice to have you make this team and the struggle be all year. ”While Dayton Bramhall took the cut with grace, the decision left ripples in her personal life. Her mother Shelly admitted, “That was hard because we were friends. If anything, I wasn’t hurt by her not making it, I was way more hurt by Kelli and Judy.” Despite the tension, Dayton chose to tell her mom herself, showing maturity beyond her years.Bramhall returned in 2025 for another shot — but was cut again before training camp. In a heartfelt comment on TikTok, Dayton wrote, “I did EVERYTHING they asked of me and tried my absolute best to fit their mold. I’m not wanted there and I’m hoping this takes me to where I truly belong.”Also Read: Where is Armani Latimer now?

New York Jets' Quinnen Williams and Minnesota Vikings' Andrew Van Ginkel come in at No. 87 and No. 88 on esteemed NFL list



New York Jets defensive tackle Quinnen Williams and Minnesota Vikings linebacker Andrew Van Ginkel have been recognized for their outstanding performances in the 2024 NFL season, both landing places on the NFL Top 100 list in 2025. QuinnenWilliams ranked No. 87, while Andrew Van Ginkel ranked immediately behind him at No. 88.The ballot, cast by fellow players, is one of the league's most highly regarded rankings of on-field performance, and both defenders won their spots through gritty reliability, standout statistics, and leadership on underperforming and high-functioning teams alike.The New York Jets might have experienced another forgettable 2024 campaign, going 5-12 and stretching their drought to 14 years without the playoffs, but Quinnen Williams was still one of the team's few silver linings. Even with fighting the pull of a nagging hamstring injury, the veteran defensive tackle played 16 games and put up a decent line: 37 total tackles, eight tackles for loss, six sacks, and his third straight Pro Bowl selection.Quinnen Williams' sustained greatness arrives with newfound optimism under new head coach Aaron Glenn in 2025 to finally bring competitive football to New York.

Behind closed doors, they are standing guard. With Stephen Curry and Jimmy Butler still in the prime of their careers, the organization is preparing, but staying patient. If Giannis does make a move, Golden State wants to be ready with all cards in their hand.The wait is a gamble. The longer the Warriors hold off, the more likely they miss other key chances.Stephen Curry, now nearing 37, and Jimmy Butler, 35, have two or three years of peak performance left. Golden State’s front office knows this. If Giannis decides to leave the Milwaukee Bucks, Curry and Butler’s final championship run may hinge on swift action.Still, there is a risk. If the Warriors act too late, either in free agency or minor trades, the value of their draft picks and role players could disappear. In season after season, every pick and rotation player adds up.Analysts believe the Bucks' decision to waive Damian Lillard and bring in Myles Turner could influence Giannis Antetokounmpo to remain in Milwaukee. However, as Ramona Shelburne pointed out, “a decision like that usually comes later in the summer.”The Warriors’ offseason silence signals confidence, but also tension. Fans worldwide know the stakes. With every day that passes, the clock keeps ticking on what could be the biggest acquisition in NBA history all depending on one man’s choice.","Golden state warriors hold back major moves as stephen curry and jimmy butler await giannis decision.

The Context: Subway Series Banter Between Mitchell and Josh Hart

The Impact: Knicks Fans React and Trade Speculation

The Players’ New York Connections

Broader NBA and Fan Engagement

In the world of professional basketball, social media often serves as a lively arena for players to engage in friendly banter, showcase their personalities, and connect with fans beyond the court. Recently,sparked excitement among New York Knicks supporters by sending a succinct seven-word message to a Knicks fan favorite on social media, igniting a wave of reactions and speculation.The exchange occurred amid the intense New York Subway Series baseball games between the New York Mets and the New York Yankees. Josh Hart, a prominent player for the Knicks and a Yankees supporter, tweeted his allegiance to the Yankees despite the Mets winning two out of three games in the series. Hart’s tweet emphasized that New York remains a ""Yankees city,"" a nod to the storied baseball franchise’s enduring popularity in the city. Donovan Mitchell , a lifelong Mets fan with deep family ties to the organization—his father having been a manager and hitting coach—responded to Hart’s tweet with a playful jab. Mitchell’s seven-word message read: **""Saying this down 6 is funny 😂 #LFGM""**, referencing the Mets’ commanding six-run lead during one of the games.This lighthearted social media interaction quickly caught the attention of Knicks fans, many of whom flooded the comments urging Mitchell to join their team. The prospect of Mitchell donning the Knicks’ orange and blue sparked enthusiasm, given his status as a six-time NBA All-Star and a dynamic scorer. However, despite the fan fervor, there appears to be little practical momentum for such a trade. Mitchell is thriving with the Cleveland Cavaliers, and the Knicks have firmly positioned Jalen Brunson as their franchise cornerstone.Both Mitchell and Hart share strong New York roots, though their sports loyalties differ. Hart’s connection to the Yankees is personal and historic; he was gifted a Yankees jersey in honor of his great uncle, Elston Howard, the first Black player for the franchise. Meanwhile, Mitchell’s Mets fandom is lifelong, adding a layer of authenticity to his playful taunts during the Subway Series.This episode exemplifies how NBA players use social media to engage with fans and each other in ways that transcend basketball. Mitchell’s witty seven-word tweet not only entertained followers but also highlighted the vibrant sports culture in New York, where basketball and baseball loyalties intertwine. It also underscores the camaraderie and competitive spirit among NBA stars, who often blend sports talk with personal pride and humor.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Los Angeles Lakers could be chasing $251,019,650 Washington Wizards superstar to form Big 3 with LeBron James and Luka Doncic In conclusion, Donovan Mitchell’s brief but pointed seven-word message to Knicks fan favorite Josh Hart on social media was more than just a playful jab—it was a reflection of sports passion, city pride, and the engaging personalities that make professional athletes beloved figures both on and off the court.

Off-field obligations possibly distracted Travis Kelce, says Eric Mangini



Inside Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce's SURPRISE Ohio Lunch Date

Kansas City Chiefs charismatic tight end Travis Kelce has become a headline attraction both on and off the field. His football legacy remains firmly in place, but questions are beginning to arise about whether his increasingly long list of non-football activities—his highly publicized romance with Taylor Swift among them—has started to intrude his game. Former Cleveland Browns head coach Eric Mangini recently weighed in on Kelce's up-and-down 2024 season, speculating that the NFL superstar possibly overextended himself.Guesting on The Breakfast Ball Show, Eric Mangini had a refreshingly blunt analysis of what could have caused Travis Kelce's slump in performance, specifically Super Bowl LIX, where the Chiefs somehow managed to defeat the Philadelphia Eagles, but Travis Kelce's contribution on the field was dismal in comparison with his expectations. Avoiding any explicit mention of Taylor Swift, Eric Mangini hinted that Travis Kelce's focus might have moved too much away from football at an inopportune juncture in his career.“When you look at his offseason last year, it was filled with everything but football. So, he's got the budding romance, he's on tour, he's traveling overseas, and all that stuff, which is great. Then he's got the TV show. So, he films the TV show. Good with that, too. Then he's got the podcast,” Eric Mangini said, referring to Travis Kelce's busy schedule, which featured TV show appearances, international travel, and podcast hosting.""He's got the new romance, he's on tour, he's overseas traveling… which is wonderful. Then he records a television show. Then he's got the podcast. It's a lot.""While Mangini stressed he didn't blame Kelce for taking career opportunities beyond the NFL, he did say the all-time great might have stayed focused just short enough to be a factor in his game. “I'm not angry at him taking advantage of the opportunities, but I do think that put him a little bit behind the eight-ball going into the season,"" he added.Fanning the media fire are the persistent speculations on Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift's rumored engagement. Per a Daily Mail news item, the all-star tight end might be holding out for a low-key moment—away from football season—to pounce. Meanwhile, insiders indicate the couple is having increasingly private moments together during Swift's hiatus from her Eras Tour.Also read: Travis Kelce puts Taylor Swift on the back burner, vows to “do anything” for a Super Bowl win As the 2025 NFL season approaches, everyone will be watching Kelce.

The Realities: Hype vs. Hope

The NBA offseason is always a hotbed of speculation, but few stories capture the imagination of Cleveland Cavaliers fans quite like the prospect of a reunion with Kevin Love—especially as whispers about LeBron James ’s future continue to swirl. Could the Cavaliers be on the verge of reuniting their 2016 championship core? Let’s break down the latest developments, what they mean for the Cavs, and why fans are buzzing with excitement and nostalgia.Kevin Love, a key member of the Cavaliers’ 2016 title team, recently found himself moved in a three-team trade to the Utah Jazz. But his stay in Salt Lake City may be short-lived, as the Jazz are widely expected to buy out the veteran forward, making him a free agent with the freedom to choose his next destination.- Leadership & Experience: Love’s impact goes beyond the box score. He’s a respected locker room presence, mentor, and former champion—qualities invaluable to a Cavs team with playoff aspirations.- Fan Favorite: Few players are as beloved in Cleveland as Love. His return would electrify the fanbase and bring a wave of nostalgia from the 2016 championship run.- Low Risk, High Reward: At 37, Love isn’t expected to play heavy minutes.But on a veteran minimum deal, his leadership and three-point shooting could be a strategic asset off the bench.> “His impact off the floor is amazing. Here’s a great person, advocate, coach/player and can help everyone on this team trying to make that push to be a title winner like Love was in 2016.” — Zach Shafron, local reporterNo discussion of Cavaliers reunions is complete without mentioning LeBron James . The King’s future is, as always, the subject of intense speculation. Here’s what we know:- Player Option Picked Up: LeBron has opted into his contract for the 2025–26 season, ensuring he’ll play a 23rd NBA season. However, this doesn’t guarantee he’ll remain with the Lakers, as trade rumors—especially involving the Warriors and even a Cleveland return—continue to circulate.- Cleveland Connections: While a LeBron return to the Cavs faces financial and logistical hurdles, the mere possibility has fans and analysts dreaming of a storybook reunion—especially if Love is also back in wine and gold.- Lakers and Warriors in the Mix: The Lakers are reportedly open to roster changes, and the Warriors have previously shown interest in acquiring LeBron. The Mavericks have also been mentioned as a dark-horse destination if a buyout occurs.Bringing back Love—and potentially LeBron—would instantly boost the Cavs’ credibility as contenders. Both are battle-tested veterans who know what it takes to win at the highest level.- Mentorship: Young stars like Donovan Mitchell and Evan Mobley could benefit immensely from Love’s and LeBron’s experience.- Culture: The 2016 Cavs were known for their chemistry and resilience. Reuniting key pieces could help recapture that magic.- Love: Stretch big, floor spacer, and rebounder—perfect for spot minutes and as a locker room leader.- LeBron: Even at 39, LeBron remains one of the league’s top playmakers and could elevate the Cavs to true contender status if a trade or buyout somehow materializes.While the emotional appeal is undeniable, there are practical considerations:- Love’s Role: At this stage, Love is best suited for a limited role, providing leadership and shooting off the bench.- LeBron’s Contract: LeBron’s $52.6 million salary and the Cavs’ cap situation make a trade difficult under the current CBA.- Roster Construction: The Cavs must decide whether to prioritize veteran presence or continue developing their young core.The prospect of a Kevin Love reunion in Cleveland is more than just a feel-good story—it’s a move that could provide tangible benefits for a Cavs team on the rise. As for LeBron James, the rumors may be swirling, but for now, they remain just that—rumors. Still, in an NBA landscape where anything can happen, Cavaliers fans can dare to dream of one more magical run with their championship heroes.Also read: Donovan Mitchell’s Seven-Word Tweet to Knicks Star Josh Hart Ignites New York Sports Buzz and Fan Speculation One thing is certain: the 2025 NBA offseason in Cleveland is shaping up to be as entertaining as any game on the court.","Kevin love recently found himself moved in a three-team trade to the utah jazz.

I wouldn’t call that 🔥.”A fifth fan by the username @frappharden posted, “Well, maybe he’ll actually get some f**king buckets this year ass Nepo, baby”.Despite the criticism, Bronny James’ father, LeBron James has always made sure to celebrate his son’s achievements and has even defended him.A few months ago, LeBron James was spotted confronting famous host Stephen A. Smith for the criticising his son, Bronny James, “constantly”.Last month, Stephen A. Smith opened up about it and said, ""He hid behind his son, tried to make something out of nothing, as if I was dogging his son, which I was not. The real issue was we don't like each other. And he used that as an excuse to confront me,"" Smith claimed.

Just six months after getting married to the NBA legend Dwight Howard, Amber Rose Howard, also known as Amy Luciani, filed for divorce on Monday, July 7, 2025. According to a report by EURWeb, irreconcilable issues were the cause of their divorce. She further requested that all marital goods and assets be ""equitably divided"" as per the laws. She asked for alimony as well.According to court records that TMZ Sports was able to get, on July 1, the reality star went to a Georgia judge and asked for a divorce from the basketball player. As stated by Amy Howard in the document:""The marriage is irretrievably broken… There are no prospects for reconciliation.""Additionally, she seemed to have deleted all ties to the NBA legend from her social media accounts. Their relationship has been scrutinised and trending on social media since the much-publicised problems with the player's ex-partner. Royce Reed, Dwight Howard 's ex-girlfriend, allegedly accused him of verbal, physical, and emotional abuse in an Instagram post, according to a report in Vibe.The ongoing controversy surrounding Dwight's lawsuit, in which he acknowledged having s*x with men, also caused a sensation. The internet was in a frenzy over the astonishing court confessions made in that lawsuit. It was filed by a guy who accused Dwight of s*xual assault. Dwight denied the assault and maintained that the actions were consensual, but the whole thing exposed his private life.The Detroit-born rapper kept her relationship with Dwight Howard a secret until formally announcing their engagement in December 2024.On Instagram, Amy Luciani shared the news. In a since-deleted post with a video, she flaunted her diamond engagement ring while out at a club with her partner. In the group of pictures taken at the time, they were both wearing diamond rings.Meanwhile, Dwight Howard now might find himself in a tight spot financially since Amy Luciani has filed for divorce. Without a prenuptial agreement in effect, Georgia courts may decide that his soon-to-be ex-wife will receive a fair share of the assets. She might also continue getting the financial help mentioned in the paperwork. The stakes are very high given the player’s lengthy NBA career, which included contracts worth over $200 million.Also read: Kevin Durant and Steve Nash revealed big issues with small guards in modern NBA games","Amber rose howard, also known as amy luciani, filed for divorce on monday, july 7, 2025.
