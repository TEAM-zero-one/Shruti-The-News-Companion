ESPN restricts Jason Kelce from making guest appearance

Why YouTube wanted Jason Kelce for Chiefs opener



The NFL’s 2025 season opener between the Los Angeles Chargers and Kansas City Chiefs is shaping up to be a spectacle — not just on the field but also behind the scenes in the broadcast world. While YouTube secured a Hall of Fame quarterback to headline its exclusive coverage of the Week 1 clash in São Paulo, Brazil, fans hoping to see Jason Kelce join the stream will be left disappointed.According to Ryan Glasspiegel of Front Office Sports, YouTube approached Jason Kelce about appearing on its coverage of the highly anticipated Chargers-Chiefs matchup. The former Philadelphia Eagles center, now a rising media personality, seemed like a natural fit given his strong ties to the Chiefs through his brother, Travis Kelce . However, ESPN reportedly blocked the move.Kelce, who signed a multi-year contract with ESPN last year to serve as an analyst on Monday Night Football, is restricted by a new company policy. The network has decided that on-air talent will no longer be permitted to appear on coverage from competitors such as YouTube or Netflix.Interestingly, this is a shift from last season when ESPN allowed Mina Kimes and Laura Rutledge to take part in Netflix’s Christmas Day doubleheader studio show.But with streaming platforms increasingly entering the live sports space, ESPN appears to be tightening control over its personalities.It’s easy to see why YouTube pursued Jason Kelce. His “New Heights” podcast with brother Travis has exploded in popularity, drawing even bigger attention recently with Taylor Swift’s appearance. The pop icon’s relationship with Travis Kelce has amplified media buzz, making Jason a hot commodity for any NFL-related broadcast.Also Read: Tom Brady's son Jack ditches stepmom Gisele Bündchen for special outing with his birth mother Bridget Moynahan While Jason Kelce won’t be part of the opener, the Chiefs-Chargers clash still promises major storylines — from Justin Herbert leading the Chargers’ new-look offense to Patrick Mahomes beginning Kansas City’s title defense.

Patrick Mahomes jokes about Travis Kelce ’s travel knowledge despite Argentina visit

Chiefs eye redemption after Super Bowl disappointment

The Kansas City Chiefs are starting the 2025 NFL season in unusual fashion—far from Arrowhead Stadium and deep into South America. Patrick Mahomes and his teammates will face the Los Angeles Chargers in São Paulo on September 5, marking one of the NFL’s boldest international season openers.As the Chiefs prepare for their long journey, Mahomes used the moment to lighten the mood with a playful jab at his star tight end. Speaking to reporters about the travel logistics, the quarterback admitted some of his teammates underestimated the distance.“The trainers and coaches have really done the research and they understand what we need to do, so now it's just going down there and playing football,” Mahomes explained. “I think more than anything it's just explaining to some guys how far the trip was. Some guys didn't understand how far the travel was. Travis, even though he just was down there last year, I was explaining to him how the globe works.”The dry humor was classic Mahomes, and while it came at Kelce’s expense, the Chiefs’ tight end is unlikely to mind. After all, Kelce has been used to the spotlight—whether from football dominance or his high-profile engagement to Taylor Swift.Beyond the jokes, this matchup carries significant weight. The last time the world saw Kansas City in action, they were dismantled by the Philadelphia Eagles in the Super Bowl. A strong performance in Brazil would be the perfect way to reset the narrative and reassert themselves as the AFC’s team to beat.Also Read: NFL punishes Shilo Sanders with $4,669 fine after ugly incident and Buccaneers release For fans in Brazil, the game also represents history—a rare chance to see two divisional rivals battle it out on their home turf.

Micah Parsons consoles young Cowboys fan after emotional reaction



Micah Parsons embraces pressure with Packers’ record contract



When the Dallas Cowboys stunned the NFL world by trading Micah Parsons to the Green Bay Packers, emotions ran high. Fans felt betrayed, pundits questioned Jerry Jones’ move, and a viral clip of a young supporter crying captured that heartbreak. Yet, what stood out was Parsons’ heartfelt response—FaceTiming the child, offering encouragement, and promising a Packers jersey with his iconic No. 1. In that moment, Parsons showed the human side of a blockbuster trade.The trade didn’t just impact analysts and fantasy football rosters—it hit fans on a deeply personal level. One viral TikTok video captured the raw emotion of a young Cowboys fan, filmed by his mother Lesley, breaking down in tears after learning Parsons had been dealt away. What followed turned into one of the most heartwarming moments of the offseason.Parsons himself saw the clip, reached out, and later FaceTimed the devastated child. His words were both empathetic and motivational: “I saw that video, I’m sorry, bruh. I hope you know, in life, things happen that you can’t control, but you just got to keep going.”The four-time Pro Bowler didn’t stop there. He promised the boy a brand-new Packers jersey with his No.1 on it. “Even though you’re a big Cowboys fan, I hope that you still follow me and my career, because that’s what it’s all about. Passionate fans. That just meant a lot to me. I hope you know that.” He even playfully reminded the youngster to focus on school, joking that bad grades might cost him the jersey.For the fan, it was a tough lesson in the business side of sports, but also a reminder that heroes can be human too.The Cowboys received a haul—two future first-round picks and defensive tackle Kenny Clark—in exchange for Parsons. Meanwhile, Green Bay wasted no time, signing him to a four-year, $188 million extension, making him the highest-paid non-quarterback in league history.At his Green Bay introduction, Parsons admitted the reality of the deal hadn’t fully sunk in. “I didn’t think I would be traded,” he said. “But that’s the harsh reality.” Still, he embraced the pressure, noting: “I’d be a fool to not think that there isn’t expectations… But then again, that’s a blessing in itself, that means that they believe in me that much.”Parsons’ first test comes quickly: a month from now, he’ll return to Dallas in a Packers uniform, staring down the very fans who once cheered his every sack.Also Read: Patrick Mahomes teases Travis Kelce with geography joke ahead of Chiefs’ season opener in Brazil","Micah parsons was traded by the dallas cowboys to the green bay packers.

IS THIS FINALLY THE YEAR JOSH ALLEN AND THE BILLS WIN THE SUPER BOWL?? | Broken Table

Josh Allen chasing Super Bowl glory in 2025



Josh Allen finally earned his first MVP award after a remarkable 2024 season, but the Buffalo Bills’ Super Bowl dream once again slipped away. A bitter AFC Championship loss to Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs left the quarterback hungry for more. Entering his eighth season, Allen knows the margin for error is gone—this is championship or bust for him and the Bills.The 29-year-old quarterback delivered one of the finest campaigns of his career, throwing for 3,731 yards, 28 touchdowns, and only six interceptions. On the ground, he added 531 rushing yards with 12 touchdowns, showcasing his trademark dual-threat ability. The performance not only earned him the league MVP but also secured a six-year, $330 million contract extension. Away from the field, Allen celebrated personal milestones too, marrying his longtime partner.Yet, despite all the accolades, the season felt incomplete without a Lombardi Trophy. For Allen, the next step is clear: turning personal achievements into team history. “Not letting the past impact us. If we keep putting our heads down and keep knocking at the door, the door is going to open eventually. The only thing I can think of is I get the chills just thinking about it.God’s timing is always right,” Allen told Albert Breer.Oddsmakers agree the Bills are primed for a breakthrough. With +600 odds, Buffalo enters the 2025 season as the Super Bowl favorite, edging out the Eagles and Chiefs. The only team sharing their odds is the Baltimore Ravens—who happen to be the Bills’ first opponent on September 8.Allen understands that past heartbreaks cannot define this team. After four straight Super Bowl appearances from 1990 to 1993 without a win, Buffalo has waited more than two decades for another shot at glory. This season, Allen is determined to deliver. With his MVP-caliber talent, renewed leadership, and unwavering belief, he’s preparing to lead the Bills where they’ve longed to go: Santa Clara in February 2026, with the Lombardi Trophy finally in hand.Also Read: “Hottest female”: Ciara's ex-boyfriend calls her his hottest ex contrasting his past with her life now with NFL star Russell Wilson","Josh allen claims bills will crush chiefs, eagles and ravens to finally win long-awaited super bowl.

Joseph Parker and Fabio Wardley waiting as Oleksandr Usyk’s future remains unclear

Following a video that showed Oleksandr Usyk dancing on stage in Ukraine, the world heavyweight champion has been asked to provide a new medical report. The video, shot earlier this week at a public event, showed the 38-year-old spinning, hopping, and waving his arms next to Ukrainian pop singer Nadia Dorofeeva. The video caused alarm since Usyk had only asked for additional time to heal from a back injury before defending his title against Joseph Parker.The World Boxing Organization (WBO) reacted quickly after the video was widely shared online by streaming platform DAZN with the caption:In response, WBO Championship Committee chairman Luis Batista Salas sent a letter to Usyk’s team demandingclarification of the boxer’s health.Salas wrote, adding that the new report must include the fighter’s present condition, recovery timeline, and medical evidence. The WBO has given Oleksandr Usyk until Monday to comply, warning that failure could lead to disciplinary action under its rules.The situation comes after Usyk had already asked the WBO in early August for a 90-day suspension of negotiations for his mandatory fight against Joseph Parker.At that time, his camp submitted medical papers recommending complete rest and physiotherapy.

Reports in Britain suggest that undefeated heavyweight Fabio Wardley (19-0-1) is the frontrunner to fight Parker later this year if the Usyk bout does not go ahead.The WBO’s demand has turned what looked like a simple medical delay into a bigger issue.

A painful night that tested Colorado’s spirit

Coach Prime’s calm words steady shaken emotions

Shedeur’s private rallying cry to his father

Regrouping together to answer the season’s challenge

The Colorado Buffaloes’ opening night against Georgia Tech ended in a narrow 27–20 defeat, but the loss carried a weight that went far beyond the scoreboard. In the aftermath, it wasn’t just Coach Prime’s words at the podium that mattered. It was a seven-word family message from his son, Cleveland Browns quarterback Shedeur Sanders, that underscored the family’s bond and demand for accountability.Colorado’s defense forced three first-quarter turnovers but failed to convert them into momentum. The Buffaloes finished with just one offensive touchdown, while Georgia Tech’s Haynes King gashed them for 156 rushing yards. In total, Colorado gave up 320 rushing yards—numbers that highlight a recurring weakness from last season. The result left fans and analysts questioning whether the Buffaloes can rise above the same flaws that haunted them in 2024.Deion Sanders took the setback in stride, choosing to focus on positives rather than panic. “I’m optimistic on everything. We’re definitely gonna be fine. We could’ve won that game. It’s not like we got our butts kicked,” he said afterward. His tone echoed the resilience he has preached since Colorado’s rebuild began, but behind closed doors, his son delivered a sterner call.Now an NFL rookie in Cleveland, Shedeur has transitioned from son to leader. Hours after the game, he typed a pointed reminder in the family’s group chat: “As SANDERS MEN we have to regroup.” The message symbolized a deeper expectation—that the Sanders legacy is measured not by setbacks, but by how swiftly they respond to them.For the Sanders family, football is a proving ground of character. Shilo continues to fight for his NFL shot, while Shedeur grows into his professional role. Next up for Colorado is Nebraska, a chance to turn frustration into fuel. Whether that private message becomes a turning point will depend on how the Buffaloes answer their own quarterback’s rallying cry.Also read: Chicago Bears fifth-round rookie Zah Frazier will sit out 2025 season after personal issue emerges","The colorado buffaloes lost 27–20 to georgia tech in their opening game of the season.

“he looks like he’s been huffing silver spray paint, like I REFUSE to believe that is his ACTUAL face hair color!!!!”

“Have fun massaging that strong foot,”

“Dayum Deion”

“shout out to the big dog!”

The buzz around actress Karrueche Tran and NFL legend–turned–Colorado coach Deion Sanders started when she was spotted holding his hand during his cancer surgery recovery. That emotional show of support instantly set off dating rumors, with many fans convinced the two were more than just friends. While Deion hasn’t said a single word about it, the speculation only grew louder as Karrueche continued appearing by his side, turning a private moment into one of the internet’s favorite talking points.Things escalated when Karrueche finally spoke out on thepodcast. She admitted that she is “dating” and “having fun,” but she didn’t name names. Of course, the timing couldn’t be ignored. With her already being spotted during Sanders’ health battle and their closeness in those hospital clips, fans didn’t need much more to put two and two together. Even without Sanders openly confirming, the internet seems pretty convinced that Karrueche’s mystery man is Prime Time himself.As soon as her comments spread online, social media lit up with reactions, some playful, some shady, and some downright brutal. Two themes quickly emerged, fans believe Karrueche has a “celebrity-only” dating pattern, and many just can’t get over the major age gap between her and Sanders.One user summed it up perfectly, tweeting:That line captured what a lot of people were thinking, that Karrueche seems to always be linked to well-known men, whether it was in Hollywood, music, or now the NFL world.Then came the age-gap commentary, with one fan writing:That reaction struck a chord, because it wasn’t just a one-off variation of the same comment flooded timelines. For some, the romance feels sweet and supportive. For others, the fact that Deion is 57 while Karrueche is 36 is a little too much to overlook.Of course, it wouldn’t be Twitter without a few stray jabs. One fan roasted Sanders’ look, writing,While another joked:referencing Sanders’ well-documented health issues.Still, not everyone was trolling. Some fans cheered the couple on, dropping comments likeandreminding everyone that plenty of people actually support the unexpected pairing.Between the trolling about her dating history, the jokes about Sanders’ age, and the memes about his appearance, this new romance has already become a pop culture spectacle. But for every critic, there’s a fan hyping them up. Until Deion himself confirms or denies the rumors, the internet is going to keep roasting, speculating, and posting memes at lightning speed.Also read - “Trapped you with a baby”: Fans react to Travis Hunter becoming a dad before rookie debut","The buzz around karrueche tran and deion sanders started when she was spotted holding his hand during his cancer surgery recovery.

PM Modi’s letter to Pujara:

Dear Cheteshwar,

I learnt about your decision to retire from all forms of cricket. Following the announcement, there has been an outpouring of appreciation from the fans and the cricketing fraternity about your remarkable achievements. I convey my heartiest congratulations and warmest greetings on a spectacular cricketing career.

In an age dominated by shorter formats of cricket, you were a reminder of the beauty of the longer format of the game. Your unflappable temperament and ability to bat long hours with great concentration made you the fulcrum of the Indian batting line-up.

Your outstanding cricketing career is dotted with moments of remarkable skill and resolve, especially in challenging conditions overseas. For example, fans will always remember instances like the tests in Australia, when you laid the foundation for India’s historic first-ever series win on Australian soil! Standing tall against one of the most potent bowling attacks, you showed what it meant to shoulder responsibility for the team.

There have been many series victories, centuries, double centuries and accolades in your career. But no numbers can capture the sense of calm that your presence gave to fans and teammates, that the team’s fate was in safe hands. This is truly your abiding legacy that goes beyond mere numbers.

Your passion for the game was also reflected in the fact that even while being an international cricketer, you made it a point to play first-class cricket, whether it was for Saurashtra, or abroad. Your long association with Saurashtra cricket and your contribution to putting Rajkot on the cricketing map will remain a source of immense pride for every youngster in the region.

I am sure that your father, a cricketer himself as well as your mentor, is proud of you. Puja and Aditi must be delighted to be able to spend more time with you. They have all made great sacrifices to support you along the way.

Beyond the field, your in-depth analysis as a commentator continues to add great value to cricket enthusiasts, who look forward to hearing your insights. I am confident that you will keep yourself associated with the game and inspire budding cricketers.

Best wishes for your journey ahead.

NEW DELHI: The Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) has reportedly reached out to former India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni with an offer to join the national team as a mentor ahead of next year’s ICC T20 World Cup. While the news has generated excitement among fans, former cricketer and West Bengal legislator Manoj Tiwary responded with a tongue-in-cheek remark about Dhoni’s well-known reclusive nature.Speaking to ANI, Tiwary joked about how difficult it can be to get in touch with the former India skipper.“Woh phone uthaye hain na? Jahaan tak mujhe pataa hain phone pe milna bohot mushkil hai woh! Message ka reply bhi milta bohot kam hai. Bohot players apne samay main kahaa bhi hai. Pataa nahi woh reply kya karenge… woh message padhenge ki nahi padhenge (Did he pick up the phone? Because it is difficult to reach him on the phone. Replies to messages from him are also very rare, many players have said this. Will he read the message or not, we don’t know),” Tiwary remarked with a smile.The former Bengal captain further said that the key question is whether Dhoni will accept the role in the first place.“The first thing is whether he will accept the role or not. It’s very difficult for me to predict what impact he will have. His experience as a captain and as a player will be very useful, as the new players emerging today and becoming stars of the Indian team give him a lot of respect. The pairing of MS Dhoni and Gautam Gambhir will also be worth watching,” he added.Dhoni, 43, called time on his international career in 2020 but continues to be a mainstay in the Indian Premier League as captain of Chennai Super Kings (CSK). Under his leadership, the franchise has lifted five IPL titles, the most recent coming in 2023, reaffirming his stature as one of the game’s most successful leaders.Across his international journey, Dhoni steered India to three major ICC trophies — the inaugural ICC World Twenty20 in 2007, the ICC Cricket World Cup in 2011, and the ICC Champions Trophy in 2013.","The board of control for cricket in india ( bcci ) has reportedly reached out to former india captain mahendra singh dhoni with an offer to join the national team as a mentor.

NEW DELHI: Rishabh Pant looks eager to return to the field and do what he does best – smashing bowlers all around the park. The wicketkeeper-batter, who fractured a toe on his right foot on the opening day of the fourth Test against England in Manchester this July, shared an update on Instagram with a photo of his bandaged foot.""How many more days in this,"" Pant wrote alongside the picture.The injury happened when Pant attempted a reverse sweep off Chris Woakes, only to inside-edge the ball onto his right boot, causing instant pain and swelling.The fracture, believed to be on the metatarsal bone, ruled him out of the rest of the Test series and put him on a six-week recovery plan.As a result, Pant will miss the Asia Cup 2025, starting September 9, where India are grouped with Oman, hosts UAE, and arch-rivals Pakistan. Group B features Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Hong Kong, and Sri Lanka.Earlier, the 27-year-old shared a lighthearted video on social media of himself baking pizzas. Limping slightly but smiling in a chef’s apron, he was seen kneading dough and arranging toppings.“Ghar pe to kuch banaya nahi hai, yaha pizza bana raha hai” (“I haven't cooked anything at home, and here I am making pizza”), Pant quipped, before adding an Italian touch to his caption: “Impasto, salsa, forno… and me.”In the clip, Pant said, “Today I'm going to show you how to make pizza… I think I'm gonna make vegetarian pizza. With the truffle? Yeah, with the truffle.”Staying true to his entertaining self, he joked midway: “Can I use your scissor, please? Where is it? Pizza is getting ready. I'm going to wait for it.

The crowd, of course, is thrilled to have the Cenation Leader there, chanting his name and giving him standing ovations.Cena tells Paul that without the fans, he is nothing, and calls him a wannabe who understands nothing about the business. After a little more back and forth, John Cena leaves the ring while talking about respect. He then sees the boy he had called ""toxic"" during his heel run and apologizes to him with a sorry and a thank you before leaving.The first match of the night is the WWE Women’s Tag Team title match between Charlotte Flair & Alexa Bliss vs Secret Hervice. Bliss and Flair are blindsided by Alba Fyre while walking up to the ramp, who injures Flair before the match can even begin. Security takes her away, and the fans are told that the match has now been changed to a singles match between Alexa Bliss and Chelsea Green.The match started off with both women on equal footing, but soon Green took control. They both tried to use their finishers to end the match in their favour, but the other always seemed to kick out before the three-count. Even with Fyre interfering multiple times, in the end, Bliss managed to roll Green for the win.But after the match, it turned into a numbers game when Green and Fyre ganged up on Bliss to take her out. An injured Flair runs in to save her partner, and though it looked like she had things in control, the Secret Hervice had the two beat to stand tall in the end.Michin makes her entrance into the ring before Kiana James shows up, flanked by Giulia - the Women’s U.S. Champion.

He asked Michael Cole if there was any update on Cody Rhodes , who replied in the negative. He then called out Orton, who emerged to the fans singing his name.They have a little back and forth, before McIntyre drops a Glasgow Kiss headbutt on Orton. He tries to go for a Claymore Kick, but Orton dodges it and hits McIntyre with a Draping DDT, followed by a Viper's Pose. The officials soon run in to stop Orton from doing more damage and McIntyre is seen rolling out of the ring and walking away.Backstage, Bo Dallas interrupts Melo Don't Miz while the tag team partners are seen warming up for their upcoming match. The three have a little exchange before Dallas walks away, and Melo is seen doing a fist bump with Miz.We also have a short stint involving SmackDown General Manager Nick Aldis who admonished Orton for attacking the security guards. He gives Orton a bottle of Fireball whiskey, but he leaves without it. R-Truth then makes his entrance and asks Aldis if he is going to drink that, to which Aldis says that, after the day he's had, he just might.With both tag teams coming from a win, this match promised an exciting premise. The Street Profits beat MFT's JC Mateo and Tonga Loa with a little help from Sami Zayn and Jimmy Uso, while the Melo Don’t Miz duo beat Fraxiom. Now they face each other for the #1 Contenders match for the WWE Tag Titles, with TSP making their entrance alongside B-Fab, followed by Melo Don't Miz.It's a pretty evenly matched fight, with both tag teams having good and some not-so-good moments.

The MFTs are there to stop him, but then Jacob Fatu comes in to take Talla Tonga.Zayn in the meantime, hit Sikoa with a Blue Thunder Bomb for a near fall, while the latter was distracted with all the chaos around him.
