Travis Kelce confesses the unexpected impact Taylor Swift had on his personal life



Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce is gearing up for his 13th NFL season, and it’s not just football that’s kept him in the spotlight. With over 12,000 receiving yards, 1,004 receptions, 77 touchdowns, and three Super Bowl titles to his name, Kelce’s Hall of Fame resume speaks for itself. But ever since going public with global pop icon Taylor Swift in 2023, his public visibility has shifted into a whole new realm.Despite being a fan favorite long before Taylor Swift entered the picture, Kelce admitted that the intensity of media attention since dating the Grammy-winning singer caught him off guard. Speaking candidly on the ""Bussin' With The Boys"" podcast, Travis Kelce reflected on the realities of being in such a high-profile relationship.“Yeah, it's just the paparazzi. That's probably the only thing I didn't grasp until you're in it,” Kelce admitted. “That's probably the craziest part. Like, I'm just playing golf and all of a sudden there’s a guy with a camera hiding in the trees. I’m like, ‘Oh no, I’ve gotta use the restroom now—I can’t just walk over there and do my thing.’”Kelce, known for his fun-loving and unfiltered personality, acknowledged that being with someone as globally recognized as Swift means constantly being watched.He quipped, “Never been ashamed of slamming beers, just don’t want my meat on Page Six.”While the attention has increased, Travis Kelce made it clear that at its core, their relationship is grounded in normalcy. “Yeah, we’re having fun with it, man. Just being a couple, dude — you already know,” he said, brushing off speculation that their public appearances are for show. “It gets thrown out there like we’re trying to seek attention every now and then, but we’re just enjoying life and having fun, going to hockey games… kind of easing her into more of the sports world. ”As Taylor Swift’s global reach introduces Kelce to fans far beyond the football field, he continues to focus on what he does best—dominate the gridiron. With Chiefs training camp just weeks away, the cameras won’t be going anywhere. Expect to see Swift back in her suite, cheering as Kelce chases a potential fourth Super Bowl ring.For Travis Kelce, the biggest transformation hasn’t been fame—it’s how fame now follows him off the field. But through it all, he and Swift seem unfazed by the noise. They’re simply two individuals, navigating laugh, love and life under the brightest spotlight imaginable, and doing it on their own terms.Also Read: Hailee Steinfeld and Josh Allen’s wedding featured a surprise nod to the Buffalo Bills","Kansas city chiefs star travis kelce is gearing up for his 13th nfl season.

Body language expert says Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce are showing signs of lasting love

Over the weekend, Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce lit up Manhattan with what many are calling the ultimate display of youthful, romantic energy. But it wasn’t just the cute outfits and dinner date that had fans talking—it was the way they moved, dressed, and interacted. According to body language expert Judi James, their coordinated style and subtle affection hint at something deeper than celebrity chemistry: the belief that they may have truly found “the one.”Popstar Taylor Swift looked radiant in a flirty pale pink mini dress with gold buttons, while Travis Kelce kept it sleek in cropped black trousers, white socks, loafers, and a crisp white shirt. While this might seem like standard celebrity datewear, Judi James sees it as far more intentional. “Taylor and Travis’s styling and their body language suggest something of a time-warp,” she noted, pointing to their classic prom-queen and king aesthetic.This wasn’t just a fashionable night out. Judi James observed that Kelce’s wardrobe choices are starting to mirror Swift’s romantic style. “Travis's short-cropped black pants and white socks suggest he's gradually and happily style-twinning with her,” she said.But it was his subtle movements that said even more. “Travis sucks his lips in at one point to show he's taking the date very seriously and his large paw of a hand encases Taylor's hand in a clasp of macho protection. ”From their body positioning— Kelce confidently leading while Swift walked demurely behind—to the way she held her small handbag close, everything about their presence suggested a couple relishing that new, enchanted stage of romance. “Taylor's body language epitomizes 'demure' here, with her head lowered, her elbows pulled into her waist and that dinky little bag held in one hand,” James added.Judi James believes this ""first-date college look"" may not be accidental. “It could be a desire to stoke the idyllic romantic side of their relationship or a mutual wish to present each other as 'The One', going back to a teen-date state to delete any high-profile and sometimes less than agreeable relationships they've each had with others in the past,” she explained.Also Read: Why Taylor Swift’s love life feels louder with Travis Kelce than it ever did with Joe Alwyn Swift has long built her brand on emotional storytelling, and this softer, sweeter public persona may be a reflection of a new, more intentional chapter.

Joey Chestnut on 2025 Return to Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest

What is at stake for Bertoletti



A NEW CHAMPION 🌭 Patrick Bertoletti wins 2024 Nathan's Hot Dog Eating Contest 🏆

Patrick Bertoletti, the reigning champion of the Nathan’s Famous Fourth of July Hot Dog Eating Contest, is gearing up for a high-stakes title defense at Coney Island. After downing a personal best of 58 hot dogs last year to clinch the coveted Mustard Belt in Joey Chestnut’s absence, Bertoletti is now focused on pushing past the “60‑dog club. ” “I’ll be eating next to [Chestnut] and he’s crazy fast out of the gate. That’s just extra motivation and drive,” he tells TMZ Sports. With Chestnut—the long-time “Jaws” of competitive eating—making his comeback, what was a surprise championship could turn into one of the most intense rivalries in hot dog history.Bertoletti, 40, began competitive eating in 2007, earning the nickname “Deep Dish” through his record-breaking performances in events like chicken wings, cream-filled doughnuts, and peanut butter & jelly sandwiches. With that experience fueling his confidence, he’s embracing new pressure as the defending champ. “It does feel weird because […] I’m not used to being the champ…but it feels good,” he explains in the TMZ video.Bertoletti says the anxiety linked to the title isn’t negative—it’s energizing. With the goal of breaking the 60‑hot‑dog barrier, he’s strategically pushing his training. “The goal is to improve on 58…if I could get into the 60 club, […] but 60 would be great,” he states .He anticipates that Chestnut’s blistering pace will ground him in focus: “If you have somebody like that next to you pushing the pace, […] you’re just gonna be focusing on keeping up with him. ”Joey Chestnut, a 16‑time Nathan’s champion, was controversially barred from the 2024 contest due to a vegan sponsorship conflict but is set to return on July 4, 2025. With a staggering 76‑hot‑dog record in 2021 and an ambitious 80‑dog target this year, Chestnut’s comeback sets the stage for a showdown. His absence last year left fans and athletes like Bertoletti feeling the competition was incomplete. For Bertoletti, Chestnut’s presence is not just a challenge—it’s validation. “It didn’t feel right without him there,” he reflected.For Bertoletti, this year’s contest brings more than the title. Establishing himself in the “60‑dog club” would cement his status among the elite of the sport. Equally, it's a rare shot to beat Chestnut head‑to‑head—a victory that could redefine his career. The contest’s broader narrative—legendary return, underdog champion, historic milestone—is captivating audiences beyond typical food‐sport fans.Also read: Celebrities spotted at Wimbledon 2025: David Beckham, Nick Jonas, John Cena and more As Independence Day approaches and Coney Island prepares for its annual spectacle, the clash between Patrick Bertoletti and Joey Chestnut promises to deliver drama, records, and edge‑of‑seat competition.

Whether a new era begins or the old guard reasserts dominance, this Fourth of July showdown stands poised to become one of the most memorable chapters in hot dog eating lore.","Patrick bertoletti, 40, is the reigning champion of the nathan’s famous fourth of july hot dog eating contest.

LeBron James’ Tribute to the Deceased Diogo Jota



The Impact of Jota’s Passing

Honoring Diogo Jota’s Legacy

The world of sports is in mourning following the tragic death of Diogo Jota, the 28-year-old Liverpool and Portugal forward, who died in a car accident in Spain alongside his younger brother, André Silva. The devastating incident has prompted an outpouring of grief from across the footballing and sporting communities, with tributes coming from teammates, rivals, and global icons—including NBA superstar and Liverpool FC part-owner LeBron James In the early hours of July 3, 2025, Diogo Jota and his 26-year-old brother André were traveling in a Lamborghini in the Spanish province of Zamora when the car’s tire blew out while overtaking another vehicle. The car veered off the road, caught fire, and both brothers were declared dead at the scene. No other vehicles were involved, and authorities are investigating the circumstances further.The tragedy struck less than two weeks after Jota’s wedding to his long-term partner, Rute Cardoso. The couple, high-school sweethearts, had three young children together. Jota’s last social media post was a video from his wedding day, captioned, “A day we will never forget”.LeBron James, who has been a part-owner of Liverpool FC through Fenway Sports Group since 2011, was among the first global sports figures to publicly honor Jota. On his official X account, James wrote: “My prayers goes out to his loved ones during this time! May you all be guided and protected! YNWA JOTA!! 🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾❤️”The acronym “YNWA”—“You’ll Never Walk Alone”—is the anthem of Liverpool FC and a message of solidarity, especially poignant in moments of loss. James’ tribute reflects his close connection to the club and its players, even if his personal relationship with Jota was not widely publicized. As a high-profile owner and ambassador, LeBron James’ words resonated deeply with Liverpool fans and the wider sports world.Jota’s death has left a profound mark on football. He was a key figure for Liverpool since joining from Wolverhampton Wanderers in 2020, scoring 65 goals in 182 appearances and helping the club secure the Premier League, FA Cup, and League Cup. Internationally, he earned 49 caps for Portugal and was part of the squad that won the UEFA Nations League.Tributes poured in from fellow athletes and public figures. Cristiano Ronaldo, Portugal’s football legend, wrote: “It doesn’t make sense. We were just together in the national team, and you had just gotten married. To your family, your wife and your children, I send my condolences and wish them all the strength in the world”.Liverpool FC expressed its devastation and requested privacy for Jota’s family, while fans gathered at Anfield to lay flowers, shirts, and scarves in his memory. The city of Liverpool flew its town hall flag at half-mast, and UEFA announced a minute’s silence before matches at the Women’s European Championship.Diogo Jota’s legacy will endure through the memories of his achievements on the pitch and the lives he touched off it. As LeBron James and countless others have shown, the global sports community stands together in honoring his memory, offering comfort to his family, teammates, and fans during this unimaginable loss.","Diogo jota, the 28-year-old portugal forward, died in a car accident in spain alongside his younger brother, andré silva.

Tyrese Haliburton’s routine diet is as much about flavor as fitness



Tyrese Haliburton doesn’t experiment with his pre-game food



Tyrese Haliburton is just 25 and knows that he can treat himself to sushi or a hamburger once in a while. However, the Indiana Pacers star knows when to limit their frequency and gives credit for his well-balanced diet to his chefs. A die-hard pasta lover, he enjoys it for dinner, but when it comes to game day, he sticks to a fixed menu he doesn’t tamper with at all. Here’s all about the diet that helps him maintain his A-game on the court.Since his second year in the NBA, Tyrese Haliburton has employed chefs, as he is not very proficient in cooking and would often end up eating at restaurants in their absence. “It’s just important that I have someone holding me accountable, but it’s also me eating the right things,” he told GQ in a 2023 interview.The No. 0 point guard believes in an early and hearty breakfast. He loves a big plate of French toast combined with eggs and bacon, topped with his permanent fixture — a smoothie.He prefers a comparatively lighter lunch, which could be a grilled cheese sandwich or something else, complemented with tomato soup.He likes to keep his favorite food, that is pasta, for dinner, which he complements with rolls and a Caesar salad — and, of course, a smoothie.He prefers to end his night with a shake made with ice cream and protein or have a cherry juice from his own brand, Cheribundi. He claims it helps him fall asleep easily.Haliburton isn’t fond of vegetables, but he consumes them in the form of green juices. He’s fond of smoothies, which he has with every meal.Haliburton has kept his pre-game food palette fixed for a long time and never experiments with it, since it works well for him. It’s always chicken, rice, and bread with a green juice for lunch before he hits the court for a game. After a game, the first thing he takes is cherry juice.Tyrese Haliburton is currently recovering from surgery for a torn Achilles tendon. He led the Indiana Pacers to the NBA Finals, but his injury worsened during Game 7, which they unfortunately lost to the Oklahoma City Thunder. He fell to the floor in pain and had to be escorted out mid-game.Also Read: “How soft are the NBA players now?”: Tyrese Haliburton’s injury in Game 7 sparks heated debate among fans Now in recovery mode — which is expected to last several months — the player will definitely be savoring his favorite pasta and hamburgers, as he has a long time before returning to the court.","Tyrese haliburton is the no. 0 point guard for the indiana pacers.

Carolina Hurricanes sign Nikolaj Ehlers to pivotal six-year, $51 million contract aimed at strengthening their offensive lineup

Nikolaj Ehlers brings proven scoring and speed to the Carolina Hurricanes lineup

The Carolina Hurricanes have landed one of the top NHL free agents, inking Nikolaj Ehlers to a six-year, $51 million deal. The 29-year-old winger was the most sought-after player remaining on the market when free agency began. A speedster with a scoring ability and always-reliable offense, Ehlers provides Carolina with a big addition as it seeks to maintain its status as one of the Eastern Conference's top teams next season.Nikolaj Ehlers' contract has an average value of $8.5 million per year and represents Carolina's commitment to bringing scoring punch to the team. The Danish winger comes from a 2024-25 season with the Winnipeg Jets where he accumulated 24 goals and 53 points in 69 games. He also contributed five goals and seven points during Winnipeg's postseason run before the Jets were ousted by the Dallas Stars in the second round.Hurricanes GM Eric Tulsky confirmed that negotiations with Ehlers' camp heated up over the last several days, leading to Thursday's signing. The Hurricanes had plenty of cap space, but their ability to make a long-term commitment without having to give up other core pieces of the roster helps to illustrate the significance of the deal.Ehlers will be part of an offense that also includes Sebastian Aho and Andrei Svechnikov, providing another scoring threat.Selected ninth overall by Winnipeg in 2014, Ehlers has recorded 225 goals and 520 points through 674 career games in the NHL. His production history made him a hot commodity once free agency commenced. Prior to this new contract, he was completing a seven-year, $42 million deal with a $6 million cap hit.The Hurricanes have been busy this offseason, signing not just Ehlers but also signing young forward Logan Stankoven to an eight-year, $48 million contract extension. Carolina also traded for New York Rangers defenseman K'Andre Miller, showing a clear emphasis on constructing a team that can contend long term.Now with the addition of Nikolaj Ehlers, the Carolina Hurricanes have fulfilled their requirement for increased scoring depth and bolstered an already skilled roster further. The transaction is a testament to their insistence on remaining competitive and in pursuit of a Stanley Cup in the future.Also Read: NHL Trade News: Florida Panthers sign MacKenzie Entwistle to two-year, two-way contract","Carolina hurricanes sign nikolaj ehlers to pivotal six-year, $51 million contract.

Florida Panthers sign MacKenzie Entwistle to boost forward depth and add physical edge to lineup

MacKenzie Entwistle aims for NHL return after injury challenges and time in the AHL

The Florida Panthers have added organizational depth with the signing of forward MacKenzie Entwistle to a two-year, two-way agreement. The 25-year-old, who spent several seasons in the Chicago Blackhawks system, will attempt a return to form after a 2024-25 season that was shortened by injury. Entwistle offers NHL experience and a physical presence that can be an asset at the bottom of the Florida lineup.MacKenzie Entwistle played 67 games with Chicago in 2023-24 with five goals, 11 points, 47 penalty minutes, and 138 hits. He was plagued by injuries for most of last season, limiting his efforts to seven regular-season contests with AHL's Charlotte Checkers, where he had one goal and two points. In limited play, Entwistle came back for the playoffs and registered two goals and 20 penalty minutes in eight post-season games, proving that he can perform under pressure.The Panthers have been busy adding depth to their forward corps after their deep 2024-25 playoff push. Entwistle's experience and versatility may be useful, particularly in a bottom-six position that requires energy and defensive dependability. Although he is likely to start the season in the AHL, Florida's coaching staff hasn't shut the door on potential NHL call-ups in case of injuries or roster shifts during the season.A third-round draft pick of the Arizona Coyotes in 2017 (69th overall), Entwistle was traded to Chicago as part of the Marian Hossa trade. He fought his way into the Blackhawks' lineup across portions of four seasons, earning respect for his work ethic, penalty killing, and physicality. His finest NHL run occurred in 2023-24, as he emerged as a consistent checking-line forward.The move by Florida to sign a two-year, two-way contract is one of caution and possibility. The two-way deal gives the Panthers flexibility in terms of cap management and roster fluidity while providing Entwistle with an opportunity to prove himself at the NHL level. If he can remain healthy and keep his aggressive style of play going, he might prove to be a solid depth addition to the Florida forwards, who always seem to appreciate grit and energy.Entwistle's signing is as much a reflection of the Panthers' emphasis on creating a strong, durable roster that can handle the rigors of an extended NHL season as anything else. Although he will probably begin the season in the AHL, his skillset and physicality make him a prime candidate to return to the NHL again in the near future.Also Read: Henrik Lundqvist shows how to retire in style with epic waterfront BBQ","Florida panthers sign mackenzie entwistle to boost forward depth and add physical edge to lineup.

Sergei Bobrovsky brushes aside personal glory; Florida Panthers system gets praise



This is how much it costs to look like 2x Stanley Cup champ, Sergei Bobrovsky 😲 Which goalie do you

Sergei Bobrovsky was the clear standout in the Florida Panthers’ latest Stanley Cup triumph. Still, when asked about his role in the title run, the veteran goaltender humbly redirected the spotlight. Speaking to Russian outlet MatchTV after clinching back-to-back championships, Bobrovsky downplayed praise from Edmonton Oilers forward Vasily Podkolzin, emphasizing instead the collective effort of his teammates and coaching staff. The Panthers, now chasing a third straight title, are setting their sights on NHL history.Sergei Bobrovsky's .905 save percentage in the pivotal game helped tip the series in the Florida Panthers' favor to win the Stanley Cup, but Sergei Bobrovsky remained true to his well-known modesty.I am just part of the team. Part of the system. All the guys worked to the maximum. The concentration and intensity, especially in these games, were off the charts. When a team plays like that, it makes the goalkeeper’s job easier. The opponent has no time for anything, and in key moments it is very difficult for him to do what he wants,"" he shared with MatchTV. “I’m excited about the next season, about the next challenge. We have, again, a great group of guys. I’m excited to be their goalie, to help them, to go through the challenges and hurdles with them.""The Florida Panthers are now on the brink of NHL greatness. With two titles in two seasons, they can make history and become the first team to win three in a row during the salary cap era. Only the Pittsburgh Penguins and Chicago Blackhawks have won three in total since the salary cap era began, but none have won a legitimate three-peat.""We have a great group of guys. We have good players, but next season starts from zero for everybody,” he acknowledged. “If you win [a third cup in a row], it’s going to be happiness.""Amidst the NHL's changing landscape, few teams have the depth, chemistry, and leadership Florida has nurtured in recent years. And underpinning it all is Sergei Bobrovsky's immoveable humility and unflappable play, inspiring it all.Also read: Sergei Bobrovsky becomes first goalie in NHL history with back-to-back 40-save games Whether they achieve the unattainable three-peat or come up short, Bobrovsky's team-first approach is already establishing the precedent for another unbelievable go.","Sergei bobrovsky was the clear standout in the florida panthers' latest stanley cup triumph.

Aaron Rodgers is stepping into his final NFL season—and he’s already planning his total disappearance from the spotlight. In a brutally honest appearance on The Pat McAfee Show, the 41-year-old quarterback confirmed what fans had long suspected: the 2025 season with the Pittsburgh Steelers will be his last. But it’s not just football he’s leaving behind—Rodgers says he’s retreating from public life completely, along with his wife, Brittani.“I’m pretty sure this is it,” Aaron Rodgers said bluntly about his one-year deal with the Steelers. “That’s why we just did a one-year deal. Steelers didn’t need to put any extra years on it.”While Rodgers promised to give Pittsburgh “everything I got,” he also made it clear he’s done chasing headlines. “When this is all done, I’m out; you won’t see me,” he said. “I don’t want to live a public life.”Rodgers’ clarity about walking away from fame underscores a deeper personal shift—one that includes his fiercely private marriage to Brittani.Rodgers spent much of the interview defending his wife's desire for privacy and slamming what he called a “sick society.” “Now I’m with somebody who’s private, who doesn’t want to be in the public eye,” he explained.“Didn’t sign up to be a celebrity, doesn’t want to be part of it.”The quarterback expressed frustration over paparazzi stalking his new life in Pittsburgh, including trying to photograph Brittani and even his dog, Apollo. “It’s a sick society, isn’t it?” he said.Despite being in the public eye for two decades, Rodgers says he's ready to cut the cord completely. “Just because I’m not selling wedding photos to the magazines... that’s just not what I want to do,” he said. He also warned fans not to expect family members to leak info either. “Any other ridiculous story about my family that I don’t talk to—they wouldn’t know any information about me,” he added.Also Read: “She made me better”: Patrick Mahomes says the woman everyone loves to hate, Brittany Mahomes—is the real reason behind his NFL greatness As Rodgers prepares to close the chapter on his NFL career, one thing is certain: when the final whistle blows, he won’t just be leaving the field—he’ll be vanishing from public view entirely.","Aaron rodgers says this nfl season is his last and he's ‘out’ for good afterward.
