'We don't look at averages and stats': Gautam Gambhir on sending Axar Patel at No. 5

NEW DELHI: Eyebrows were raised when India announced five spinners in the team for the ICC Champions Trophy . Historically, the pitches in Dubai do not overly favour spinners. However, the venue has also just got done with the month-long ILT20 league which may have left the pitches tired and more amenable to spin. Predominantly, though, India’s spinner-heavy squad was chosen to lengthen the batting lineup, TOI has learnt.The trend emerging from head coach Gautam Gambhir ’s tenure is the inclination to have more allrounders in the lineup across formats. Gambhir has been vocal about the need to bat deep. Seambowling allrounders are a rarity at the moment. Hence, Washington Sundar too has made the cut along with Axar Patel and Ravindra Jadeja Interestingly, it was Gambhir who insisted on having Shivam Dube back in the ODI scheme of things by adding him to the list of non-travelling reserves, say insiders.Gambhir is someone who prefers to have more options in the playing XI. More allrounders give him the chance to be flexible. If India advance in the tournament, spinners are likely to play a greater role.The idea, according to those in the know of developments, is simple — play two steady finger-spinners who can bat well to complement either Kuldeep Yadav or Varun Chakravarthy . Kuldeep and Chakravarthy are seen as genuine strike options. If the pitches at the start look like they can produce big runs, one might see Chakravarthy in the XI ahead of Kuldeep. The majority of Chakravarthy’s wickets have come while the batters have been looking to push the scoring rate. Kuldeep is seen as someone who can deceive the batter in the air and lure him into a false shot, like he did against England in the last ODI in Ahmedabad on Wednesday.Also See: Champions Trophy Schedule 2025 There are other factors too. India have played two Asia Cups at the venue over the last seven years and never played more than two frontline spinners in the XI.Jasprit Bumrah’s absence and Mohammed Shami being rusty after a long injury layoff has played a part in India picking a spin-heavy attack which can compensate for the inexperience of the two new pacers, Harshit Rana and Arshdeep Singh. It will be interesting to see how India’s campaign unfolds on the Dubai pitches, which usually sport a layering of grass to prevent the surface from cracking up.",The trend emerging from head coach gautam gambhir ’s tenure is the inclination to have more allrounders in the lineup across formats.

"Indian Navy women battle the elements, conquer Cape Horn in South America",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indian-navy-women-battle-the-elements-conquer-cape-horn-in-south-america/articleshow/118287208.cms,"Indian Navy women brave harsh conditions to conquer Cape Horn in South America

PANAJI: Few places on this planet test a sailor's mettle like Cape Horn , the southern tip of South America. It is where the might of the southern ocean meets the unyielding cliffs of Tierra del Fuego, waters feared and revered by mariners. To round the horn under sail is to step into an elite club of seafarers - a league that lieutenant commanders Dilna K and Roopa A sailed into on Valentine's Day.Their date with Cape Horn was by no means smooth sailing. Continuous rainfall, 40-knot winds, towering five-metre waves, and treacherous weather gave the two officers a memory of a lifetime. ""For the past few years, this is the moment we had been waiting for. It feels incredible to have successfully rounded Cape Horn,"" Roopa said.While the duo battled the elements onboard INSV Tarini , on the other side of the planet, their mentor commander Abhilash Tomy (retd) had his own share of sleepless nights, reliving his battle with the southern ocean. ""It is a big stress off my head. In the first two legs, I was not monitoring them too much, but during this leg, I was monitoring them every hour,"" said Tomy.Cape Horn is more than a waypoint on a chart. It is a rite of passage, with weather-beaten mariners often quipping that ""below 40°, there is no law. Below 50°, there is no God"". The Horn is situated 800km from Antarctica, making it one of the closest land points to the icy continent. The journey through this region not only requires exceptional navigational expertise but also resilience to the harsh conditions of the southern ocean. ""We proudly fly our flag here at Cape Horn,"" said Dilna.Rounding Cape Horn required INSV Tarini and its two courageous crew members to navigate through the Drake Passage - named after English explorer Sir Francis Drake, who confirmed the existence of an open sea route south of South America. ""This passage takes sailors through the Drake Passage, a treacherous waterway known for its extreme winds, towering waves, and unpredictable weather. The conditions in this region test even the most experienced mariners, making their successful passage a significant achievement,"" the Indian Navy said.The two women officers have now earned themselves the esteemed title of 'cape horners', a designation traditionally given to elite group of seafarers who have successfully navigated Cape Horn under sail. They now carry a distinction very few Indians can claim. They have joined the ranks of Captain Dilip Donde, Tomy, and the six naval women officers who were part of Navika Sagar Parikrama-I.""At Cape Horn, they got the worst weather in their sailing experience. Winds of 30 knots gusting to 40 knots. Temperatures were at 2-3°, and if you take into account wind speeds, you are talking about sub-zero temps. It's the longest they have sailed in such conditions,"" said Tomy.Having rounded the Horn under sail, after facing nature's wrath and coming out unscathed with INSV Tarini in good shape, the yacht has once again proved its ability. And while Tomy has stopped pacing about in dread, a sigh of relief has also been let out by Ratnakar Dandekar, who built the yacht at Divar.","Indian navy women brave harsh conditions to conquer cape horn in south america. To round the horn under sail is to step into an elite club of seafarers. Dilna k and roopa a sailed into on valentine's day.

has apparently taken a subtle jab at their recently traded superstarwho made his departure from the to play alongside the Los Angeles Lakers in a surprising blockbuster trade. While the Mavericks have received Anthony Davis , the team has been under severe backlash from fans and analysts alike. However, the Mavericks have been quite clear on their stance. After previously citing Doncic’s fitness issue, the Mavericks' head coach has recently given subtle hints that Doncic was the reason for two of their top stars— Kyrie Irving Dallas Mavericks coach Jason Kidd subtly suggested that Luka Doncic played a role in Kyrie Irving and Klay Thompson’s struggles, though he never mentioned him by name addressing him as just “the player we traded”. The team has been navigating a season of highs and lows, with Irving and Thompson stepping up after the blockbuster trade that sent Doncic to the Los Angeles Lakers.“(Kyrie) is gonna get more shots, Klay will get more shots, everybody will get more shots just because of the player that we traded. He was involved in everything,” Kidd said.Kidd has been careful with his words, consistently avoiding direct references to Doncic in press conferences. Meanwhile, the Mavs continue adjusting to their new roster, hoping that their latest acquisitions can keep them competitive in a tough Western Conference.Reports suggest the move wasn’t just about basketball— it also stemmed from concerns over discipline, effort, and chemistry.In Doncic’s absence, the Mavericks’ new superstar Anthony Davis has sparked concern over his injuries. He is currently sidelined which propelled Kyrie Irving to take charge. “For Kai, we joke about the 42 and zero last night. It wasn’t that he wasn’t looking to pass—it’s that those passes come out of a double-team,” Kidd said of the 32-year-old standout. “That leads to Klay or someone else benefitting from a wide-open three or an open layup. The hockey assist isn’t part of the NBA stat line, but it should be. He led the scoring by getting calls in the double-team,” he added.With injuries piling up, the Mavericks need their bench to step up as the season nears its final stretch. Irving missed the game against the Heat due to right shoulder soreness, leaving a gap in the backcourt. Anthony Davis, acquired in the blockbuster Doncic trade, was also sidelined after suffering an injury in his Dallas debut.Also Read: Luka Doncic gives unfiltered opinion on Los Angeles Lakers head coach JJ Redick’s leadership Without two of their biggest stars, the Mavs could face a tough challenge staying competitive in the Western Conference. The pressure is on their role players to deliver, especially with playoff positioning on the line. Still, they have claimed a stunning victory over the Heat with 118-113.

Fans quickly noticed that Gondrezick was with Brown as he celebrated at the parade in Boston after he and the Celtics secured the championship victory in June 2024.Although the official explanation for the breakup has not been made public, insiders indicate that a variety of factors may have played a role in this decision.

NHL Replaces All-Star Game With International Hockey Event—A Game-Changer for Fans and Players



A Preview of Olympic-Quality Hockey



The Challenges and the Bigger Picture



The Future of Midseason Hockey



For years, major sports leagues across North America have struggled to keep their All-Star Games relevant. With dwindling interest from both fans and players, these once-celebrated events have often been reduced to lackluster exhibitions, plagued by half-hearted performances and injury concerns. The NHL , however, has taken a bold step in 2025, scrapping its traditional All-Star Game in favor of a groundbreaking international tournament—the 4 Nations Face-Off . This move could redefine how leagues approach midseason breaks, offering a fresh, competitive alternative that’s already generating buzz.The 4 Nations Face-Off isn’t just another All-Star event with new branding—it’s a complete transformation. The tournament features four of the world’s hockey powerhouses: the United States, Canada, Finland, and Sweden. These teams will compete in a round-robin format, with the top two nations battling for the championship. Unlike previous All-Star exhibitions that lacked intensity, this tournament has serious implications. As Team USA’s alternate captain Charlie McAvoy put it, the 4 Nations Face-Off is ""not even comparable"" to traditional All-Star Games, emphasizing that ""those are just skills competitions. This is the real deal.""Fans have long been critical of the NHL’s All-Star weekend, which, despite a history of entertainment, has failed to maintain excitement. The skills competitions often feel half-hearted, and the game itself lacks the competitive spirit that makes hockey thrilling. In contrast, the 4 Nations Face-Off injects a new level of significance into the midseason break, ensuring top players have something meaningful to play for beyond an exhibition-style showcase.The timing of the tournament is no coincidence. With the NHL set to return to the Winter Olympics in 2026, the 4 Nations Face-Off serves as a preview of what’s to come. This competition allows players to build chemistry and national teams to gauge their strengths ahead of the Milano Cortina Olympics. According to The Athletic’s player poll, 81% of respondents expressed genuine interest in the 4 Nations Face-Off—an overwhelming shift from the lukewarm reception that recent All-Star weekends have received.Other professional leagues have also experimented with injecting national pride into their All-Star events, with varying degrees of success. The WNBA, for instance, has pitted Team USA against the league’s top players, while the NBA has considered similar changes. However, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver admitted that the All-Star Game might ""never again be a truly competitive game."" The NHL’s 4 Nations Face-Off, on the other hand, is designed from the ground up to ensure competition, rather than just a display of flashy skills.While the tournament brings fresh excitement to the midseason, it’s not without its drawbacks. Russia’s ongoing international sporting ban means that elite players like Kirill Kaprizov and Andrei Vasilevskiy won’t participate. Similarly, Czechia’s exclusion leaves out stars like David Pastrnak and Martin Nečas. Germany’s Leon Draisaitl, one of the NHL’s premier forwards, will also be absent due to a lack of national depth.Despite these omissions, the tournament represents a significant step toward a long-term goal: establishing a world championship tournament that consistently features the best players. The NHL’s absence from the Olympics in previous years has been a major void for international hockey. Meanwhile, other global competitions, such as the IIHF Ice Hockey World Championships, have often missed key players due to scheduling conflicts with the Stanley Cup Playoffs. The last true best-on-best event, the World Cup of Hockey, hasn’t been held since 2016. The 4 Nations Face-Off is the NHL’s first step in rectifying this gap.While the traditional NHL All-Star Game is set to return in 2026, the success of the 4 Nations Face-Off could shape the league’s approach to midseason entertainment in the long run. Fans and analysts alike will be closely watching how this tournament impacts ratings and engagement. In recent years, the NHL’s All-Star broadcasts haven’t drawn viewership numbers comparable to other leagues, but an intense, meaningful competition could change that narrative.Also Read: Auston Matthews Net Worth in 2025, Current Salary, Personal Life Details and More As teams battle for national pride and a championship, the 4 Nations Face-Off has the potential to redefine what midseason hockey should look like. By replacing an outdated, uninspired exhibition with something players actually care about, the NHL may have just set a precedent for other leagues to follow.","The 4 nations face-off features four of the world’s hockey powerhouses: the united states, canada, finland, and sweden.

Buffalo Bills OL Tommy Doyle

is medically retiring from the NFL. He posted on Instagram a farewell message, noting that he'll be back to tailgate.

The farewell message on Buffalo Bills OL Tommy Doyle's Instagram post read

What an adventure. The highs, the lows. The wins, the losses. The adversity, the lessons, the brotherhood—every moment has shaped me. After battling through injuries and dealing with nerve damage, I've made the tough decision to retire from the NFL.

I wanted to be upfront and address it rather than rumors and speculation.

As much as I wanted to keep pushing, I trust that God's plan is greater than mine.

To my teammates, coaches, family, trainers, and friends—you made this ride unforgettable. To the Pegula family and the entire Bills organization—thank you for believing in me. And to the city of Buffalo and the Bills Mafia—your love and support have meant everything.

This isn't goodbye—it's just the next chapter. Can't wait to be back next season, tailgating with y'all.

All the best Tommy. Thanks for being stellar both on and off the field.

WOW this is sad for the Bills but Thank you Tommy! Good luck on the next chapter!

""Congrats Tommy! I know fans will talk about your TD but that's not what I'll remember. You are one of the toughest players the Bills ever had. Pick me another one who tore an ACL like he did in the 'heat' game @ Miami but kept on playing because there was no one else!! Crazy

Thehas become a significantly important event during All-Star Saturday Night, rivaling the Slam Dunk Contest in popularity. With the rise of three-point shooting in the modern game, this competition has taken center stage, showcasing the league's elite sharpshooters. This year, all eyes are on Damian Lillard as he aims for a historic three-peat.The contest features eight players competing in a two-round format. Each participant has 70 seconds to shoot 27 balls from five racks positioned around the three-point arc. Each rack contains five balls: four regular balls worth one point and one ""money ball"" worth two points. The fifth rack, chosen by the player, consists entirely of money balls. Additionally, two ""Starry range"" balls, placed deeper than the standard three-point line, are worth three points each.The top three scorers from the first round advance to the finals, where the format repeats. In case of ties, a 30-second tiebreaker round determines advancement, while a full 70-second round decides the winner.The event is straightforward, requiring only an NBA referee to oversee the competition. The referee ensures players stay behind the line and confirms each made basket. This year’s lineup includes stars like Jalen Brunson (Knicks), Buddy Hield (Warriors), and defending champion Damian Lillard (Bucks).The 3-Point Contest tips off on Saturday, Feb. 15, at 8 p.m. ET from the Chase Center in San Francisco. Fans can catch the action live on TNT or stream it via Sling.The contest has a rich history, with legends like Larry Bird, who won three consecutive titles from 1986 to 1988, and Stephen Curry , a two-time champion. Last year, Lillard claimed his second title, and he’s now poised to join Bird as the only players to win three in a row.Here’s the complete table of past winners for the NBA All-Star 3-Point Contest:As the NBA continues to evolve, the 3-Point Contest remains a testament to the skill and precision that define today’s game.

Theare reportedly eyeing a move to bolster their three-point shooting, withemerging as a potential target. After a tough 131-119 loss to the Utah Jazz , where the Lakers’ three-point struggles were evident despite a 40% shooting night, the team is looking to address its inconsistent deep-range efficiency. Currently ranked 17th in the league with a 36.0% three-point shooting rate, the Lakers believe Beasley could be the solution to elevate their offense.Malik Beasley, 28, is having a career-best season with the Pistons, shooting 41.8% from beyond the arc on a career-high 9.4 attempts per game. With 212 three-pointers, he broke the Pistons' single-season record and surpassed Saddiq Bey's previous record of 211. His performance has been historic. Beasley scored 24 points and made seven of ten three-pointers in a recent 132-92 thrashing of the Chicago Bulls, showcasing his abilities.The Los Angeles Lakers ’ interest in Malik Beasley stems from their need for a reliable perimeter shooter to complement the playmaking of Luka Doncic and LeBron James . Both stars struggled in the loss to the Jazz, combining for eight turnovers and a -29 plus-minus rating. Adding Beasley could provide the Lakers with a consistent drive-and-kick option, enhancing their offensive versatility.Beasley, a former Laker, had a brief stint with the team during the 2022-23 season after being traded from the Jazz. While he averaged 11.1 points, his three-point shooting dipped to 35.3% in 26 games. However, his current form suggests he could offer significant improvement if he returns to Los Angeles.The guard signed a one-year, $6 million deal with the Pistons last offseason, aiming to secure a long-term contract in 2025.

Poll What Are You Looking Forward to for India in the 2025 ICC Champions Trophy? Strategic and Innovative Gameplay Outstanding Teamwork and Collaboration

India’s squad for ICC Champions Trophy, 2025:

Late in the afternoon on February 15, an unusual frenzy gripped the business class arrivals lounge of the Dubai International Airport. The word had travelled that the Indian cricket team was going to land shortly and plenty of fans had assembled to catch a glimpse of their favourite superstars. The area which generally sees passengers quietly make their way to the fleet of luxury vehicles waiting outside was buzzing with activity.Security officials were working overdrive when the flight carrying the Men in Blue landed on the runway. Few luggage trolleys were used to cordon off the area and the intensity picked up when the local police directed everyone to vacate the lounge area and head to the parking lot outside. There were loud cheers when head coach Gautam Gambhir led the entourage to the team bus. Everyone - from Virat Kohli to Hardik Pandya to Shreyas Iyer - acknowledged the fans while boarding the team bus.When the players took their respective seats, the waiting fans kept looking inside because captain Rohit Sharma was yet to exit the building. And when he did, there were loud cheers for the Hitman who walked briskly to the waiting bus and even summoned the security official for some instructions. Did he forget something again? Eh, not quite sure but you never know! The bus left the airport and KL Rahul, who made his way out at least 20 minutes after the team, took a separate car to the team hotel.Business as usual resumed after that and the usual calm was restored to the business class arrivals lounge. The ICC Champions Trophy 's first match in Dubai is still some days away and the buzz has naturally been missing in the city. And quite understandably so. Only India would be parked here because the rest of the teams will play their matches in Pakistan, the official hosts of the tournament. The teams allotted fixtures vs India will travel to Dubai and then head back as per the hybrid arrangement okayed by the International Cricket Council (ICC).The tournament gets underway on February 19 with India playing their opening match vs Bangladesh in Dubai on February 20. The large section of Bangladeshis residing here are excited to see their heroes in action and sound very optimistic on their chances too. The only question on their lips is ""when will the Bangladesh team land?"" and they certainly sound confident of taking a Jasprit Bumrah-less India down in their tournament opener.""I support Bangladesh and want them to win. It will be difficult but easier than before because Jasprit Bumrah , the dangerman, is not here. And we have good pacers. So it will not be an easy game for India as pacers do well in Dubai,"" said a cab driver who makes multiple trips to the airport in a day.""Pakistan is 50-50. They can do anything on their day but when it's not their day, they are a difficult team to even watch on TV (laughs),"" he added on the hosts' chances.Pakistan, the defending champions, will put their credentials to the test in the opener against New Zealand in Karachi.Rohit Sharma (Captain), Shubman Gill (Vice-captain), Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer, KL Rahul (WK), Rishabh Pant (WK), Hardik Pandya, Axar Patel, Washington Sundar, Kuldeep Yadav, Harshit Rana, Mohd.

NEW DELHI: Delhi Capitals ' dramatic last-ball victory over Mumbai Indians in the Women's Premier League was marred by two contentious run-out decisions, sparking debate among fans and experts.Arundhati Reddy sealed a tense two-wicket win by scrambling a two off the final delivery, but the focus remained on the two third-umpire calls that left many questioning the interpretation of the rules.With 25 runs needed from 15 deliveries, Shikha Pandey attempted a risky bye after missing a shot but was sent back by non-striker Niki Prasad. A direct hit at the striker's end saw Pandey stretching to make her ground, and at the moment the LED stumps lit up, she appeared to be short.However, after a lengthy review, third umpire Gayathri Venugopalan ruled Pandey not out, basing the decision on when the bail was completely removed from the groove rather than when the lights first illuminated.A near-identical incident occurred seven balls later, with Radha Yadav attempting a quick single before being sent back. Despite a desperate dive, replays showed her bat hovering above the crease when the LED lights first flashed. Yet, by the time the bails were fully dislodged, her bat had made contact with the ground. Once again, the third umpire deemed her safe.The decisions left MI captain Harmanpreet Kaur visibly frustrated, as she engaged in discussions with the on-field umpires. To add to Mumbai's woes, Yadav struck a six on the very next ball, significantly easing the chase.According to the WPL playing conditions, both run-outs could have been given out. The rules state: ""Where LED wickets are used, the moment at which the wicket has been put down shall be deemed to be the first frame in which the LED lights are illuminated and subsequent frames show the bail permanently removed from the top of the stumps.""Despite the controversy, Delhi Capitals celebrated a crucial win, but the debate over run-out protocols in the WPL is unlikely to die down anytime soon.",Delhi capitals registered a thrilling last-ball win over mumbai indians.
