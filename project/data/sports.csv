Ben Stiller reacts to McAfee’s objectionable commentary



Actor and ardent New York Knicks fan Ben Stiller has brushed off sports analyst Pat McAfee’s objectionable comments during Game 4 of the Eastern Conference Finals on Tuesday. A host of celebrity fans, including actors Stiller and Timothée Chalamet and director Spike Lee, were among the spectators as the Knicks faced the Indiana Pacers on the latter’s home ground at Gainbridge Fieldhouse in Indianapolis. McAfee, who provided some commentary, went on to call out the celebrity audience while pitching for the Indiana Pacers.On top of McAfee’s comments, the Indiana Pacers went on to beat the New York Knicks 130–121. It seems the adrenaline was running too high for McAfee as he called out the New York Knicks’ celebrity fans, who had come down to Indianapolis from New York just to watch the game. The home crowd even booed as McAfee said, “Spike Lee is here. Ben Stiller is here. Timothée Chalamet is here. Let’s send these sons of b****es back to New York. ”After the game, actor Ben Stiller came across a video of McAfee’s comment on X and reacted to it, “Yes. Weird. We were happy to be there and cheer our team, and other than that, Indy fans were awesome.” He went on to respond to other users as they weighed in on the incident.An X user and likely Indiana Pacers fan wrote, “You’re right, it wouldn’t happen in New York.Your fans decide throwing trash bags at the other team’s fan in the street is okay. A little friendly banter to rile up a crowd? Cmon man.” Responding to him, Stiller wrote, “All good. The garbage was bad.”The actor also shared a message for a Knicks fan who said he didn’t like what McAfee said. Replying to him, Stiller wrote on X, “It’s ok. He must be playing around - if it’s an actual point of view, it seems a little anachronistic or cliche? Like we are ‘big city celebs’ and we shouldn’t be there in the heartland? Again, everyone we met was awesome and incredibly cool.”When an X user said that Pacers fans booing the celebrity names were “all affectionate boos,” Stiller wrote, “I promise you, I actually felt that.” He added, “No bitterness at all Indy fans were amazing, good win for you guys.” Replying to another tweet, Stiller also said, “Appreciate that. Just wouldn’t not happen in NY.”Also Read: “HE GOTTA GO” — Frustrated New York Knicks fans demand firing of head coach Tom Thibodeau after Game 4 loss Stiller and Chalamet have been among the biggest celebrity fans of the New York Knicks.

The Proposed Trade: Moody for Washington

Why this trade makes sense for both teams

Theface a pivotal offseason as they balance developing young talent with maximizing Stephen Curry’s championship window. A potential trade involving Moses Moody for Dallas Mavericks forwardcould be the key to strengthening their roster.The Warriors’ young core—Jonathan Kuminga, Brandin Podziemski, and Moses Moody—has shown promise, but the team may need more experienced players to remain title contenders. With Curry entering his 17th season, Golden State is exploring trades to add playoff-tested contributors.Key reasons for the potential move:- Curry’s timeline demands win-now moves. The Warriors lack reliable wing depth.- PJ Washington offers two-way versatility and shooting.Washington, a 6’7” forward, had a strong 2024-25 season with the Mavericks, averaging:His ability to stretch the floor and defend multiple positions makes him an ideal fit in Steve Kerr’s system. As : ""With the incoming arrival of Cooper Flagg, teams are expecting the Mavericks to make PJ Washington available on the trade market for a rotational upgrade this summer."" (H/t: Sporting News)As proposed by Evan Sidery and elaborated by Dean Simon , the Golden State Warriors could offer:- Moses Moody (young guard with potential)- Future second-round picksIn return, Dallas would send PJ Washington, giving Golden State a proven forward on an expiring $46 million deal.- Warriors get a playoff-ready wing to support Curry.- Mavericks free up space for future roster moves while adding a developmental piece in Moody.Losing Moody would be a tough decision, but the Warriors must prioritize Stephen Curry ’s remaining prime years. Washington’s experience and skill set could be the missing piece for another deep playoff run.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Josh Giddey’s $120M Payday - The Chicago Bulls’ High-Stakes Bet on Their Aussie Superstar As Dean Simon noted in the original report, Washington’s extension eligibility in August could spark a competitive trade market, making this a move Golden State should consider sooner rather than later.",The golden state warriors face a pivotal offseason as they balance developing young talent with maximizing stephen curry’s championship window.

Wayne Gretzky highlights Caitlin Clark’s influence beyond basketball

Inside the NFL Owner’s Meeting + Gretzky on Ovechkin's Scoring Record, GOATs & NHL Playoffs | EP 141

In a recent episode of the New Heights podcast hosted by NFL brothers Jason and Travis Kelce, hockey legend Wayne Gretzky joined as a special guest—and made headlines for more than just his thoughts on the NHL playoffs. Amid a spirited conversation about his storied career and the current Stanley Cup race, Gretzky turned his attention to an emerging icon in a different sport: WNBA star Caitlin Clark.Known as “The Great One” in hockey circles, Wayne Gretzky is admired not just for his on-ice brilliance but also for his perspective on sports and life. That was on full display during the podcast when he acknowledged Caitlin Clark’s soaring popularity and the broader effect she’s had on women’s sports.“Look at Caitlin Clark—how she’s just taken over the country, for that matter, maybe the world,” Gretzky said. “She’s encouraged so many young girls now to participate in sports, whether it’s basketball, or soccer, volleyball.”This kind of praise from one of the most respected figures in sports history underscores just how transformative Clark’s presence has become. From sold-out arenas to record-breaking TV ratings, her influence has extended well beyond the basketball court.She’s helped shift how fans, media, and even other athletes view women’s sports.Gretzky didn’t stop at praising Clark’s star power. He also touched on the timeless values sports instill in young people—many of which are embodied by Clark's journey through college and now professional basketball.“My dad used to always say the greatest thing about sports is that you learn so much about real life. You learn how to be unselfish, you learn how to be dedicated, you learn how to work hard, you learn how to win, and you learn how to pick yourself up off the ground when you lose—and that’s life.”Also Read: Wayne Gretzky weighs in on Sam Reinhart's injury and its impact on the Panthers' Stanley Cup hopes As Caitlin Clark begins her second season with the Indiana Fever, the accolades keep coming.

Lauren Kyle opens up about the playoff vibe in Edmonton and her personal style journey

As the Edmonton Oilers continue their deep playoff run, the city is buzzing with anticipation and passion. But it's not just the on-ice action drawing attention—Lauren Kyle, wife of Oilers captain Connor McDavid, is making waves in her own right, blending her love for fashion with the electric atmosphere of playoff hockey.Last December, Lauren Kyle launched her fashion label, Sports Club Atelier, which quickly resonated with fans looking for stylish, sport-inspired apparel. Her latest initiative, The Foundry Collection, debuted this spring in collaboration with the Oilers—perfectly timed with the team’s playoff surge. The collection reflects Kyle’s unique vision of fusing fan spirit with high fashion.Speaking to ELLE Canada, Kyle captured the emotional rollercoaster that comes with playoff hockey in Edmonton, a city known for its deep-rooted love for the game.“The energy is just unreal. Everyone’s on edge, the fans are fully dialled in and you can feel how much it means to people,” she said. “I love being part of that. It’s emotional, exciting and a little chaotic in the best way. For me, it’s not just about the game—it’s about the vibe, the atmosphere, the outfits and the rituals.”Her words speak to a deeper cultural experience—playoff hockey in Canada is more than just a sport; it's a communal ritual where emotion, identity, and tradition collide.For Kyle, fashion has become her way of expressing and enhancing that experience.“Since starting the brand, my game-day style has evolved so much. I’m designing pieces that I genuinely want to wear, which means I get to merge my love of fashion with my love for the sport in a way that feels authentic,” she added.Also Read: Connor McDavid’s wife Lauren Kyle opens Bar Trove with NHL wives rallying behind her luxury restaurant dream Beyond the runway, Kyle continues to be a visible and vibrant supporter of the team.

Brandin Podziemski had successful surgery on his left wrist

The Golden State Warriors have recently confirmed that Stephen Curry’s teammate, Brandin Podziemski, underwent successful surgery on his left wrist. The team announced that the 22-year-old had a debridement procedure in Los Angeles this week. He is expected to fully recover and return in time for training camp. The surgery, done on Podziemski’s shooting hand, may offer clarity on his post-season shooting slump with the Warriors.Brandin Podziemski quietly played through significant discomfort during the Golden State Warriors' postseason run. According to the Warriors' official release, the young guard had successful left wrist debridement surgery and is on track to be ready for the 2025-26 season.“Brandin Podziemski underwent successful left wrist debridement surgery yesterday in Los Angeles. He is expected to make a full recovery and be ready for the start of training camp,” the Warriors wrote on X.Orthopedic specialist Dr. Nirav Pandya explained on social media that wrist debridement involves the removal of inflamed or scar tissue within the joint, helping to improve mobility and healing.The timing of this surgery now raises questions about Podziemski’s playoff performance.After shooting a solid 44.5% from the field and 37.2% from three during the regular season, his postseason numbers dropped to 36.4% overall and 32.8% from deep. The shooting dip became more noticeable in the Western Conference Semifinals against Minnesota, where he converted just 9 of 40 shots (22.5%) through the first four games.Despite the struggles, Podziemski still had moments of brilliance, most notably a 28-point performance against Houston in Game 4 of the first round and another 28-point effort in the season-ending loss to the Timberwolves. But the pain may have affected his consistency. In his own words, after his Game 4 outburst, Podziemski reflected on his mindset:""First, you got to tell yourself you belong in the moment. Good and great players want to be in the moment, thrive in the moment, don't back down from it.""""Everything I do, I'm never going to have a regretful decision. I'm just going to go out there and know and tell myself I belong, because I do.""The Warriors rode a strong finish into the playoffs, with Podziemski part of a revamped starting lineup that included Stephen Curry, Draymond Green, Moses Moody, and Jimmy Butler. That unit helped the team finish 48-34, eventually defeating the Rockets in seven games before bowing out to Minnesota.Also Read: Tyrese Haliburton earns massive praise from Los Angeles Lakers legend Magic Johnson after creating history in Indiana Pacers’ Game 4 win against New York Knicks Now entering his third season, Podziemski remains under contract through 2027.

Shubman Gill story: From a remote village near the border to India’s Test captain

NEW DELHI: The Indian Test team has officially stepped into its much-anticipated transition period, with Shubman Gill named captain for the upcoming five-match series in England. Wicketkeeper-batter Rishabh Pant has been appointed vice-captain. The squad also features Karun Nair, marking his return to the national fold after eight years. Nair, who last represented India in 2017, was dropped soon after becoming only the second Indian to notch a triple century in Test cricket.Among the notable omissions for the England tour, Shreyas Iyer 's absence stood out. Chief selector Ajit Agarkar explained the decision, saying: ""Shreyas had a good one-day series, played well in domestic as well but right now there's no room in Test cricket.""India head coach Gautam Gambhir addressed Iyer’s exclusion for the first time on Wednesday.""Mai selector nahi hun (I am not a selector),"" was Gambhir’s sharp retort to a journalist asking about Iyer’s omission from the squad.Iyer's leadership skills will be under the spotlight when Punjab Kings take on Royal Challengers Bengaluru in Qualifier 1 of IPL 2025 on Thursday — a high-stakes clash between two confident teams.With the cushion of a top-two finish, both sides are expected to go all out, aware that even a defeat in this match would offer another shot at making the final.Punjab Kings are navigating uncharted waters, having qualified for the play-offs for the first time since 2014. But under the leadership of Iyer and head coach Ricky Ponting, they’re unburdened by past failures.RCB, in contrast, are no strangers to the heartbreaks of knockout games and, like every season, will aim to finally break their title jinx.

Auston Matthews and his fans got emotional as his mother opened up about the financial struggles of getting him into hockey,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/auston-matthews-and-his-fans-got-emotional-as-his-mother-opened-up-about-the-financial-struggles-of-getting-him-into-hockey/articleshow/121166477.cms,"Image credit - Paige Taylor White/CP

Auston Matthews’ hockey dream wasn’t cheap and his mom took the weight

“I used to work in the morning for Starbucks, in the afternoon the restaurant, i was very fortunate to have two jobs. And believe me, if they would have more hours, I would have more jobs.""

Before Auston Matthews was an NHL superstar, his biggest supporter was clocking into two jobs, trying to make ends meet. His mom, Ema Matthews, didn’t just believe in his dream, she bankrolled it, penny by penny, from behind a Starbucks counter. For families without deep pockets, hockey can be financially brutal. But Ema’s resilience turned obstacles into opportunity and her son into one of the league’s brightest stars. Her story is the heartwarming reminder that every great athlete often has a real-life superhero cheering from the sidelines, sacrificing, hustling, and holding it all together so their child can chase the impossible.Ice time, gear, coaching, travel, youth hockey isn’t just a sport, it’s a financial beast. For the Matthews family, especially with Ema being originally from Hermosillo, Mexico, the culture and cost of the sport were both daunting. But she took on the challenge without hesitation, picking up multiple jobs including a gig at Starbucks to ensure Auston never missed a chance to grow on the ice.Ema shared in a past interview that the cost of hockey often reached up to $20,000 a year, a heavy ask for any middle-class family. To make it work, she didn’t just cut corners, she picked up shifts and poured lattes while helping Auston stay focused on the sport. She even deposited small amounts of money in his account so he could grab food with teammates like a regular teen. Beyond that, Ema often drove long hours to tournaments, handled equipment costs, and juggled bills, all to ensure Auston had every chance to chase his dreams without added stress.Ema’s story also breaks stereotypes. In a sport dominated by players from Canada and northern U.S. states, Auston’s rise as a player of Mexican heritage makes his success even more impactful. It's not just about talent, it’s about trailblazing, especially for kids of color or immigrant families who rarely see themselves represented in hockey.Auston Matthews is one of the Toronto Maple Leafs’ biggest stars and a face of the NHL. He’s not just known for his goal-scoring skills but also for his poise and work ethic, traits his mom likely helped instill. While fans celebrate his success on the ice, stories like Ema’s remind us of the sacrifices behind the scenes that made it possible.Ema Matthews’ story shows what’s possible when love, grit, and hustle lead the way, proving that behind every great athlete stands a family whose unwavering support shapes both their character and their incredible achievements. Her journey highlights the sacrifices, encouragement, and strength that fuel success, reminding us that triumphs on the ice are built far beyond the rink, in the hearts and homes of those who believe the most.Also read - “From baptism to strip club”: Pete Blackburn’s unhinged NHL comparison is going viral and fans totally get it","Auston matthews is one of the toronto maple leafs’ biggest stars and a face of the nhl.

Tom Brady thrives post-Gisele Bündchen divorce with Italian flair

Even in retirement, Tom Brady refuses to stay off the scoreboard—on or off the field. Two years after his high-profile divorce from Gisele Bündchen, the NFL legend is rewriting his own playbook, turning heads from Venice, Italy to Las Vegas, Nevada.Recently spotted throwing footballs in the narrow streets of Venice, surrounded by a group of admiring Italian women, NFL legend Tom Brady looked every bit the icon he’s always been. The seven-time Super Bowl champion seemed relaxed and energized—no pads, no stadium, just the streets of Italy and a perfect spiral. The moment felt like a metaphor for his post-NFL life: unconventional, enviable, and still centered around football.While his former partner Gisele Bündchen is forging her own path, Brady’s journey since their 2023 split has been all about reinvention. Beyond becoming the most decorated quarterback in league history, he’s now a powerful media figure and NFL investor.Tom Brady's record-breaking $375 million contract with Fox Sports made waves, solidifying him as the highest-paid sports analyst ever. His debut as a broadcaster was on the grandest stage possible—the Super Bowl—surpassing household names like Greg Olsen and Tony Romo.But Tom Brady’s influence isn’t limited to television. As a minority owner of the Las Vegas Raiders, he’s reportedly taken an active role in shaping the team’s future. The franchise’s recent decisions—including hiring veteran coach Pete Carroll and drafting standout running back Ashton Jeanty—have Brady’s fingerprints all over them.“Tom Brady has already hit a home run with Ashton Jeanty before he takes an NFL snap,” one source noted, hinting at the quarterback's eye for talent and leadership.Also Read: Gisele Bündchen’s $400M empire: How the supermodel rebuilt her life after divorce with Tom Brady and welcomed baby no. 3 Away from the gridiron, Brady’s life has taken on a new rhythm.

Carter Hart’s lawyer questions Brett Howden over what he saw in hotel room 209

Brett Howden’s memory questioned over past head injury and forgotten details

The Hockey Canada sexual assault trial involving five former members of the 2018 World Junior hockey team resumed in a London, Ontario courtroom, with NHL forward Brett Howden facing a pointed cross-examination over what he witnessed during the alleged incident.Brett Howden, testifying remotely from Las Vegas where he now plays for the Golden Knights, was questioned by Megan Savard, the lawyer representing Carter Hart. Hart is accused of sexually assaulting a woman known as E.M., including receiving oral sex during the early morning of June 19, 2018, in room 209 of the Delta hotel.Savard pressed Howden on statements he gave in 2018, asking whether Hart initially seemed hesitant to accept E.M.'s offer. “The impression you got was that Mr. Hart didn’t really seem like he wanted to agree to oral sex at first,” she suggested. Howden agreed, citing Hart’s possible desire to “look cool in front of his teammates.”Megan Savard further probed Howden’s recollection: “They like, kind of went to each other like it was 50/50… and then she gave him oral sex.” Howden confirmed that was his statement.In a strategic move, Megan Savard also cast doubt on the reliability of Howden’s memory.She reminded the court that he suffered a severe head injury in March 2022 during a televised game, in which he lost consciousness for nine minutes and was stretchered off the ice.Howden acknowledged the injury and admitted, “I’ve never really had to remember, try to remember so many little details like this before. And it’s definitely gotten a lot harder over time.”Adding another layer to the proceedings, Justice Maria Carroccia dismissed a key text message sent by Howden to teammate Taylor Raddysh days after the alleged incident. In the message, Howden wrote, “Dude, I’m so happy I left when all the s--t went down… Duber was smacking this girl’s ass so hard.”Also Read: Florida Panthers get injury boost ahead of Game 4 as Paul Maurice reflects on playoff pressure The judge ruled the message inadmissible, citing that Howden had “no present recollection” of the event and may not have been speaking from personal observation.

Poll Should cricket captains always back their bowlers in controversial run-out situations? Yes, it boosts team morale and unity No, sportsmanship should take precedence

RCB vs PBKS, IPL Qualifier 1: Quick Singles from Mullanpur | Indian Premier League

WHAT EXACTLY HAPPENED

IPL 2025: What went wrong for Delhi Capitals?

WHAT THE RULE SAYS

NEW DELHI: Former India spinner Ravichandran Ashwin, who has been under scrutiny himself since the controversial run-out of Jos Buttler in IPL 2019, stood firmly in support of Lucknow Super Giants bowler Digvesh Rathi on Wednesday. Speaking on his YouTube channel, Ashwin dissected the incident involving Rathi’s attempt to dismiss Royal Challengers Bengaluru’s stand-in captain Jitesh Sharma at the non-striker’s end during their IPL 2025 clash in Lucknow.""As an owner of LSG, I will be thinking that I need Jitesh Sharma's wicket. If he has stepped outside the crease, he is out. Now let me dive into the technicality of the incident. Is he justified in being out if he stepped outside the crease before Digvesh Rathi got into the delivery stride? Yes. Would it be bad for RCB? Yes, again, because they would not have liked Rathi or Pant if they did that. Now let's look into the real-case scenario. When Rathi landed his front foot, Jitesh was inside the crease. So, this was not out. After breaking the stumps, umpire Michael Gough asked him whether he was appealing, and not whether he was sure. He said, 'Yes, I'm appealing.' So the decision went to the third umpire, and the right decision was made,"" Ashwin explained.However, what happened after the decision left Ashwin furious. The cameras showed LSG skipper Rishabh Pant withdrawing the appeal and embracing Jitesh, an act the commentators hailed as a great display of sportsmanship. Ashwin strongly disagreed with that narrative.""Until now, everything was right. But after that, commentators started saying that Pant has withdrawn the appeal - what an amazing act of sportsmanship. Grow out of this. Pant is a fantastic cricketer. He scored a stunning century, and I know he will go on to do great things in cricket. I am already looking forward to the England series just to see how he will bat and help India win. I am a big fan of Pant. I'm clarifying it yet again before being targeted by people. But think, you are the father of Rathi, and his captain, in front of crores of people, criticised him. He actually went over the board. A captain's job is to back the bowler and not make himself feel small,"" Ashwin added.The incident took place in the 17th over of Rathi's spell. With Royal Challengers Bengaluru needing 29 runs off the final 19 balls, Rathi attempted to run Jitesh Sharma out at the non-striker's end.He paused before delivering the ball and removed the bails when he spotted Jitesh stepping out of his crease.Rathi went on to appeal for the dismissal. However, the third umpire, after reviewing the footage, ruled that the bowler had already completed his delivery stride and crossed the popping crease. The decision of 'not out' was flashed on the big screen. Simultaneously, LSG captain Pant also withdrew the appeal and hugged Jitesh, a moment that was widely praised as an act of sportsmanship. Nonetheless, Pant’s gesture had no bearing on the outcome, as the appeal was already invalid under the rules.According to MCC Law 38.3.1: ""At any time from the moment the ball comes into play until the instant when the bowler would normally have been expected to release the ball, the non-striker is liable to be run out...""Further clarity is provided in subsections 38.3.1.1 and 38.3.1.2, which state that the non-striker can be dismissed only until ""the moment the bowler's arm reaches the highest point of his/her normal bowling action in the delivery swing.""",Ravichandran ashwin defends digvesh rathi after controversial run-out.

Why no Shreyas Iyer for England tour? Coach Gautam Gambhir opens up

NEW DELHI: One of India's most crucial all-rounders in recent times, Ravindra Jadeja , has revealed that the two most influential figures in his cricketing journey share not just a first name, but also hail from the same state — Bihar.In a candid conversation on the podcast ‘Kutti Stories with Ash’, hosted by teammate Ravichandran Ashwin, Jadeja opened up about how both his childhood coach and his legendary mentor MS Dhoni have been central to his career.""My cricketing journey is between two Mahendras — Mahendra Singh Chauhan and Mahendra Singh Dhoni ,"" Jadeja said. ""I started playing in Jamnagar, at a ground called 'Cricket Bungalow', at the age of 8-9. My coach, who is still training at the same ground, is also from Bihar and his name is Mahendra Singh Chauhan. I have told this to Mahi bhai as well.”Jadeja recalled how Chauhan, a former police officer, laid the foundation for his athleticism and on-field agility.""He used to be a police officer, his mindset was that a sportsperson should be at the peak of his fitness. He used to believe that batting and bowling can be managed but one has to run a lot. My fitness level and fielding skills can be attributed to me running 15-20 kms around Jamnagar,"" Jadeja shared.When Ashwin asked him to describe Dhoni in a single word, Jadeja said, ""There is no one word to describe his greatness. He is on top of everyone.""Both Jadeja and Ashwin played crucial roles under Dhoni — not just for Team India, but also as key bowlers for Chennai Super Kings during the team’s IPL dominance.The discussion also touched upon Virat Kohli , India’s most successful Test captain, who recently stepped away from the longest format. Jadeja lauded Kohli’s unwavering intensity and winning mindset.""It was his positive approach — especially in Tests — the special thing about Virat is that he always wanted the team to pick 20 wickets in a Test match, so he never gives up at all. Be it a three-hour session or 45 overs left, he would still want to pick up all 10 wickets of the opposition,"" Jadeja said.Kohli walked away from Test cricket with an outstanding record — 9,230 runs in 123 matches at an average of 46.85, including 30 centuries and 31 fifties.","Ravindra jadeja opened up about how both his childhood coach and his legendary mentor ms dhoni have been central to his career.
