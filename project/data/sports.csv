Shubman Gill on missed chances, fielding lapses & World Cup preparation after ODI series loss

India batting star Rohit Sharma was at the centre of a major security scare recently after a woman allegedly grabbed his arm while he was entering the team hotel during the third ODI against New Zealand in Indore. A video of the incident, which has since gone viral on social media, shows the woman breaching the security cordon and approaching an unsuspecting Rohit, who appeared visibly startled by the sudden encounter.The clip later features the woman explaining her actions, claiming she was driven by desperation to seek help for her daughter, who is allegedly battling a serious illness and requires an expensive life-saving injection costing Rs 9 crore.“My name is Sarita Sharma. My daughter, Anika, is suffering from a serious illness, and to save her, we need an injection that costs Rs 9 crore and has to be imported from America. We have been organising small camps to raise funds, and so far, we have managed to collect Rs 4.1 crore. We are running out of time,"" she said in the video.The woman further revealed that she had been trying to reach out to Indian cricketers during the match in the hope of receiving assistance.“Yesterday, during the India-New Zealand match, we tried to reach out to cricketers in the hope of getting some help. We also set up a donation camp during the match, but it was not enough. I was trying to meet Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma, as they have been helping children. In a desperate attempt to save my child, I went to the hotel where Rohit Sharma was staying. Emotions got the better of me, and I ended up grabbing his hand,"" she added.Apologising for the incident, the woman appealed directly to the senior cricketers.“I want to appeal to Virat sir and Rohit sir. You may not be aware of what I was trying to do. I was not there to click any selfies; I just want to save my child’s life. I also want to apologise to the authorities for my actions. I did not know what else to do. I request Virat and Rohit that if they receive my message, please help me,"" she concluded.Rohit, 38, has retired from Test and T20 cricket but continues to represent India in the ODI format.Meanwhile, the former India captain is set to be conferred with an Honorary Doctorate (D.Litt.) by Ajeenkya DY Patil University (ADYPU) during its 10th Convocation Ceremony on Saturday, in recognition of his “unparalleled contribution” and “exemplary leadership” in cricket.""While fans know him as the 'Hitman' of cricket, the convocation marks a different kind of milestone for Rohit Sharma,"" the University said.""Presided over by the University’s President and Chancellor, Dr. Ajeenkya D Y Patil, the ceremony will see Rohit being honored for his unparalleled contribution to sports and his exemplary leadership on the world stage.""By bestowing this Honorary Doctorate, ADYPU recognizes the values of resilience and strategy that he represents-qualities that resonate deeply with the graduating class of 2026.""",Rohit sharma was at the centre of a major security scare recently.

Patrick Mahomes questioned Travis Kelce’s Taylor Swift romance before seeing it himself,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/patrick-mahomes-questioned-travis-kelces-taylor-swift-romance-before-seeing-it-himself/articleshow/127156404.cms,"Patrick Mahomes revealed he initially doubted Travis Kelce’s relationship with Taylor Swift until she appeared at Arrowhead Stadium. ESPN’s The Kingdom showed locker room disbelief, massive fan buzz, and how Swift’s presence reshaped game day energy. Teammates admitted the attention was overwhelming, yet the Chiefs stayed focused and won.

How Taylor Swift’s first Chiefs game changed everything inside the locker room

The moment Taylor Swift walked into Arrowhead Stadium, the Kansas City Chiefs felt it instantly. Phones buzzed. Heads turned. Energy shifted. What began as a regular-season game against the Chicago Bears quietly transformed into one of the most talked-about crossover moments in modern sports culture. Long before the internet caught up, the buzz was already echoing through the locker room.Inside the Chiefs organization, disbelief mixed with excitement. This was not just another celebrity sighting. It was Taylor Swift showing up for Travis Kelce, and it forced teammates to process the moment in real time while preparing to win a football game. For some, it felt unreal. For others, it felt historic.ESPN’s documentary The Kingdom captured those early reactions with rare honesty. Defensive tackle Chris Jones summed it up perfectly, saying, “You know the locker room was like, ‘Taylor Swift’s here. Taylor Swift’s here. For real? With Travis? Oh my god.’” He added, “We’re like, ‘Oh my god, Travis pulled Taylor Swift,’” a line that quickly became one of the episode’s most replayed moments.Quarterback Patrick Mahomes admitted he was skeptical at first, even after Kelce gave him advance notice.“He told me during the week. I was one of those like, ‘I got to see it, you know? I got to see it until I believe it,’” Mahomes said. Once the game began, the distraction was impossible to miss. “That’s the first person I noticed. I didn’t see anybody else,” he told Kelce on the sideline.Mahomes later explained the atmosphere shift, saying, “You definitely felt the buzz and you could see people in the stadium gravitating toward where she was at there.” Still, the focus never wavered. “But at the same time, we had business to handle.”Head coach Andy Reid added another layer to the story, revealing, “By that time, I knew they were going out. I knew her before him.” He even joked about Kelce’s reaction when Swift mentioned their connection, recalling, “And he went, ‘Oh no.’”As the postseason unfolded, Swift became part of the Chiefs’ inner circle. After the AFC Championship win, cameras caught her thanking Brittany Mahomes for emotional support, saying, “You’ve kept me so calm the last couple weeks. I did not know what to do and I’d just text Brittany and just be like, ‘Tell me it’s going to be OK. Tell me it’s going to be OK.”What started as a rumor ended up reshaping the NFL spotlight. As one teammate put it best, “The Swifties are a real thing.”","The kansas city chiefs beat the chicago bears in the afc championship. Taylor swift showed up for the first time at arrowhead stadium.

Carlos Correa’s lighthearted moment with a child reflects his warm personality off the field

To most of the children, a simple encounter with a star in the Major League Baseball can become a treasured memory. That emotion came out recently when Houston Astros shortstop Carlos Correa had a casual, happy moment with a child off the field. The interaction was natural, there was no focus on cameras or fans and it was a mere passing of a baseball. The soft and calming presence of Correa and his sincere warmth made that little gesture significant.These incidents help to remind the fans that sometimes athletes can make their most memorable impact not on the statistics but on character and humanity through the most ordinary kinds of moments and interactions that have stayed memorable to the viewers even after the event itself.When the ball was going back and forth, Correa made sure to support the child with words that were both humorous and convincing. “You are incredible. We got to sign you for the Astros , okay? When you are older, for the Astros. And we need you to pitch for us!”The comment was light-hearted, but genuine. It was not performance or pressure, but igniting belief and happiness. To the child, it was a joyful moment. To the viewers who saw the clip later, it was a good insight into how Correa is a friendly and benevolent person off the field.The incident came into the attention of more people when the wife of Correa, Daniella, posted the video on her Instagram account. Her post gave fans an opportunity to view a softer side of the Astros star, which is based on encouragement and empathy. Viewers also appreciated the interaction as they found it fascinating to watch high-level professional athletes relate to each other in a real manner.In the case of the Houston Astros, such moments subtly create a stronger connection between players and the community, demonstrating that the influence of baseball can be made through the simplest and most sincere acts that are not necessarily on the field.","Houston astros shortstop carlos correa had a casual, happy moment with a child off the field.

NHL trade rumors: Jason Robertson’s future draws attention as Penguins’ interest becomes harder to ignore,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/nhl-trade-rumors-jason-robertsons-future-draws-attention-as-penguins-interest-becomes-harder-to-ignore/articleshow/127218443.cms,"Jason Robertson trade rumors (The Hockey Writers)

Jason Robertson trade rumors fuel Penguins’ long-term plan



Jason Robertson trade speculation has moved from background noise to front-page talk as the Pittsburgh Penguins keep winning. Sitting third in the Metropolitan Division with a 23-14-11 record, Pittsburgh has changed its own narrative. This was supposed to be a year of survival. Instead, it has become a season of belief. That unexpected position has forced the front office to think bigger and act bolder as the trade deadline creeps closer.Rather than choosing a clean push or a full pivot, the Penguins are living in both worlds. Kyle Dubas is protecting the present while scanning the league for a player who can shape the future. That mindset explains why Dallas Stars winger Jason Robertson has entered serious conversation. According to Josh Yohe of The Athletic, Pittsburgh “absolutely love” Robertson, a telling phrase that reflects real intent, not casual interest.Robertson is not just another scorer. He is 26, in his prime, and producing at a level few wingers can touch. With 29 goals and 58 points through 50 games, he is delivering top-line offense while driving play in critical moments. That profile matters for a Penguins team still led by Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin but searching for the next offensive pillar.The appeal runs deeper than numbers. Pittsburgh has struggled to develop a young forward who can eventually carry the load. Robertson solves that problem instantly. He fits the age curve, the skill need, and the competitive timeline. Yohe also noted that the Penguins could “spend whatever it takes” for a player of this caliber without wrecking their long-term reset, a reflection of both asset depth and cap flexibility.Jason Robertson trade chatter has energized the fan base because the math works. Pittsburgh can offer legitimate prospects like Rutger McGroarty, Ville Koivunen, or Owen Pickering, plus premium picks. With projected cap space north of $11 million, the financial side is manageable. Moving a roster salary would be procedural, not prohibitive.If Robertson ever becomes available, the price will be steep. Dallas would demand value that hurts. Still, this is the type of swing that changes direction. Slide Robertson next to Crosby and the Penguins gain a left-shot finisher who can tilt games without perfect conditions. At this point, the question is not whether Pittsburgh can make the call. It is how much upside they are willing to chase before the deadline clock runs out.","Jason robertson is in his prime and producing at a level few wingers can touch.

Quote of the day by Jason Kelce: “One of the best things a person can be is a father”,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/quote-of-the-day-by-jason-kelce-one-of-the-best-things-a-person-can-be-is-a-father/articleshow/127218343.cms,"Jason Kelce’s retirement speech went beyond football, centering on family, fatherhood, and gratitude. The longtime Eagles center praised his parents, wife, and brother Travis, crediting them for shaping his values and resilience. Kelce emphasized that being a present, loving father now brings him greater fulfillment than his NFL career ever did.

Jason Kelce’s retirement speech reveals why fatherhood now defines his legacy

For most fans, Jason Kelce will always be remembered as the emotional heartbeat of the Philadelphia Eagles, a center who played with grit, humor, and rare authenticity. But when he announced his retirement, football quickly faded into the background. What stood out instead was how clearly his priorities have shifted, away from stadium lights and toward the quieter meaning of family.Jason Kelce’s message was not framed as a goodbye to the game. It felt more like an arrival into a different chapter. One built around presence, gratitude, and responsibility. As he spoke, it became clear that retirement did not signal an ending. It marked a return to the values that shaped him long before he wore midnight green.Jason Kelce’s most powerful moment came when he spoke about fatherhood, a role he now considers his greatest purpose. “I think one of the best things a person can be in this world is a father. A father who is present, loving (and) devoted just might be the greatest gift a child can ask for in our society, and I have a (expletive) good one,” he said.That belief connects directly to how he sees his future with his three daughters.For Kelce, success is no longer measured in Pro Bowls or championships. It is measured at home.His words about his brother, Travis Kelce, offered rare insight into a lifelong bond that shaped both men long before fame followed them.“There is no chance I’d be here without the bond Travis and I share. It made me stronger, tougher, smarter, and it taught me the values of cooperation, loyalty, patience and understanding.”Kelce also credited his wife, Kylie, for anchoring his life beyond football. “She has also given me three beautiful girls and a life that increasingly gives me more fulfillment off the field than it does on.”In stepping away, Jason Kelce did not walk away from greatness. He redefined it.","Philadelphia eagles center jason kelce announced his retirement from the nfl on monday.

Watt’s Pro Bowl ends in injury as the NFL selects Devin Lloyd in his place (Image via: Getty Images)

NFL replaces T.J. Watt with Jaguars LB Devin Lloyd



T.J. Watt’s season did not end the way anyone in Pittsburgh expected. Just days before the Pro Bowl Game, the Steelers’ defensive leader found himself ruled out with an injury that forced the league into a late change.Watt had earned his ninth Pro Bowl selection after another strong campaign. Still, instead of heading to Orlando, he is now watching from the sidelines as Jacksonville linebacker Devin Lloyd steps into the spotlight.On Jan 22, 2026, local Jacksonville radio station 1010 XL confirmed on X that Devin Lloyd had been named as Watt’s replacement for the 2026 Pro Bowl Games.“BREAKING: The Jaguars have been awarded another Pro Bowler! Jaguars LB Devin Lloyd has been named to the 2026 Pro Bowl Games in replacement of injured Steelers LB T.J. Watt,” the station posted.The NFL later confirmed the move, citing Watt’s injury as the reason for his withdrawal. While the Steelers have not released detailed medical specifics, team sources said Watt is not medically cleared to participate in any football activity.Watt’s absence closes the book on what had been another productive year for the 30-year-old. During the 2025 regular season, he recorded 7 sacks, 23 solo tackles, 3 forced fumbles, and 2 interceptions, numbers that once again placed him among the league’s most impactful edge rushers.For Lloyd, the call came as a reward for his best season since entering the league. The former first-round pick started 15 games for Jacksonville in 2025 and finished with 81 total tackles, six tackles for loss, one fumble recovery, and multiple game-changing plays in coverage.His biggest moment came in Week 5 against the Kansas City Chiefs, when he returned a Patrick Mahomes interception 99 yards for a touchdown in the Jaguars’ 31-28 win. Lloyd was also named second-team All-Pro by the Associated Press, becoming just the second linebacker in the last two decades to record at least 10 quarterback hits and five interceptions in a single season.Jaguars general manager James Gladstone spoke about Lloyd’s growth during a media interaction at the team’s end-of-season press conference on Jan. 8.“What he meant to our end result was certainly notable,” Gladstone said. “The way he worked every week, the way he connected with the staff, it showed up on Sundays.”Lloyd now joins long snapper Ross Matiscik as the second Jaguars player selected for the Pro Bowl Games this year. For Pittsburgh, Watt’s injury adds to a difficult offseason. Earlier in 2025, Watt signed a three-year, $123 million extension, and during an appearance on the ""Steelers Now"" podcast in July 2025, he admitted his future was closely tied to head coach Mike Tomlin.“I don’t want to play for anyone other than Mike T,” Watt said on the show.With Watt sidelined and uncertainty around the Steelers’ direction, the moment belongs to Lloyd. His Pro Bowl selection does more than fill a vacancy. It confirms his arrival as one of the AFC’s most complete linebackers.",Nfl replaces t.j. watt with jaguars lb devin lloyd for the 2026 pro bowl games.

There will never be anyone like Kobe Bryant . The Los Angeles Lakers legend has made several astonishing histories but his 81-point game in 2006 was record-breaking. On this day, he made the history that is yet to reach by the modern NBA stars. Of course, Wilt Chamberlain’s 100-point game remains unbeaten, but Bryant’s stunning feat has equally been celebrated over the years. On the 20th anniversary of Bryant’s wild performance, his wife Vanessa Bryant celebrates the record breaking feat in a series of Instagram stories.Vanessa didn’t have to caption anything from her part, the stories were the tale of the history itself as they spoke loud with vivid images of her late husband, who tragically passed away on 26 January in 2020 with his daughter Gianna Maria-Onore Bryant in a devastating helicopter crash.Vanessa Bryant often makes sure to keep her late husband Kobe Bryant in her memories. She often shares fragments of his legendary life as a standout NBA star on her posts on social media. Recently, Vanessa made sure to celebrate Kobe Bryant’s stunning 81-point game on its 20th anniversary with a series of heartfelt nods to the ex-Lakers star’s groundbreaking feat.On January 22, 2006, Kobe Bryant delivered a scoring display that reshaped modern NBA history.At Staples Center, Bryant took over the game with relentless pace dominating the Toronto Raptors.The performance still stands as the second-highest scoring game the league has ever seen. Unlike older scoring feats told through stories, this one occurred live on television.Bryant finished with 81 points after shooting 28-of-46 from the field, including 7-of-13 from three-point range. He added 18 made free throws on 20 attempts and logged 42 minutes. His scoring split told the story. Twenty-six points came before halftime. Fifty-five followed after the break.After the game, Bryant downplayed the moment. “I feel pretty good,” he said. “It hasn't really sank in yet. We had four days off coming up here. I'd have been sick as a dog if we lost this game. I wanted to step up and inspire us to play a great game and it turned into something really special.”Around the league, disbelief followed quickly. Tim Duncan thought the stat line was wrong. Dwyane Wade rushed to find a television after hearing the number. “I was like, ‘no way,’” Wade said. “At that time I think everybody was a fan of Kobe’s to see this is history right here being made.”Kyrie Irving remembered seeing the headline. “It said ‘Kobe 81,’” he said. “I just couldn't believe it.” Vince Carter had a similar reaction. “81? Or 51?” Dirk Nowitzki summed it up simply. “Nobody believed it.”Years later, the game still marks generations. Giannis Antetokounmpo recalled where he was that night. “I was 11 years old. I wasn’t playing basketball,” he said. Kevin Durant remembered watching with his father. “That brought us closer as a father and son,” Durant said. Stephen Curry admitted his first reaction was doubt. “81 just doesn’t even sound right,” he said.Bryant’s historic feat will be celebrated in the NBA for decades to come. Not many players came close to his elite score. Luka Doncic scored 73 in 2024, but was still 8-point short.","On january 22, 2006, kobe bryant delivered a scoring display that reshaped modern nba history.

A father-daughter gimmick turned into a gamblers’ meltdown, and the threats got real fast

Cardi B ’s ‘little white girl’ comment went viral too, but she walked it back right away

A 4-year-old who went viral for NFL picks is now dealing with adult-level ugliness. Her father says strangers sent their family death threats and money demands after her playoff predictions missed. The Los Angeles Times reported the threats. The New York Post also reported the same basic claim.Reese Donatelli became a social media hit through “Trust the Toddler,” a father-daughter series where she chooses winners by grabbing miniature NFL helmets. It started as a teaching tool. Then gamblers turned it into their personal excuse.Anthony Donatelli, a radio personality from Riverside, Calif., told the Los Angeles Times the family started getting threatening messages after Reese’s picks went sideways during the playoffs. Some messages demanded money from people who claimed they lost thousands because they followed a preschooler’s picks.Donatelli summed it up in one line: “It’s nuts,” then spelled out the obvious: “She’s obviously not an NFL analyst. She’s picking teams based on the color of her dress, or she’ll pick the Packers because she likes cheese. She just relates these silly little things as reasons why she picks certain teams.”That context matters because the backlash tried to treat her like a handicapper. During the first weekend of this month’s playoff games, several of Reese’s picks missed, and some followers started calling her picks “cursed.” Donatelli told the Los Angeles Times the series began nearly four years ago when he bought the mini helmets to teach colors, geography, and football. He said the concept stuck immediately.He described the early “aha” moment to the outlet: “It just clicked. I would put the match-ups of who was going to play that week in front of her, and for the past four years, she’s been calling football games. And she’s been pretty dang good at it,” he said.Then the playoffs hit and the streak flipped. One report said Reese guessed the wrong team for all six games during the first week of the playoffs. The next week, she went 1-for-9, with incorrect picks that included the Buffalo Bills, San Francisco 49ers, and Chicago Bears.Some people tried to keep it as a joke, at least on the surface. The Independent noted one Instagram user joked they bet “$10 million on Houston because of her,” adding they are now “more in debt than the U.S. government.” Another user pushed back on the entire idea of following her picks, writing: “If [you’re] letting a kid pick your parlays you shouldn’t be betting.”But Donatelli said it did not stay in “comment section comedy.” The family allegedly received threats. And his Instagram was set to private at the time of publication, per The Independent.The story picked up extra heat when Cardi B weighed in. The Independent reported she jumped on Instagram Live after Reese picked the New England Patriots to win, and Cardi B joked: “little white girl said we’re going to win. F** that, b***,” then immediately apologized, saying, “I didn’t mean to say that.”That moment mattered because it put a spotlight on the kid, not just the gimmick. It also tied the viral picks to a celebrity clip that people could repost and argue about. In the same reporting, Cardi B is referenced as being linked to New England Patriots wide receiver Stefon Diggs.There was also a twist the internet did not know what to do with. The Independent reported Reese’s Patriots pick was correct, with New England beating Houston 28–16 to advance to the AFC Championship.Donatelli tried to keep his own page light, at least publicly. After Reese hit the Patriots result, he wrote: “The curse has been reversed.” That line played into the joke. It also highlighted how ridiculous the blame game was in the first place.Here is what does not require debate. A 4-year-old does not control a playoff game. A 4-year-old does not owe gamblers refunds. If someone bets real money because a preschooler grabbed a helmet on camera, that is not “bad luck.” That is reckless behavior dressed up as fandom.","Reese donatelli became a social media hit through “trust the toddler,’ a father-daughter series where she chooses winners by grabbing miniature nfl helmets.

How Timothy McCormack ended up with a two-year prison term?

Who are the NBA players at the center of the gambling investigation?

A major sports betting scandal linked to the NBA has unfolded over the past few years, revealing a conspiracy that used inside information about players’ performance to make illegal gambling profits. This case recently made headlines again after Timothy McCormack, a key figure in the case, became the first person to be sentenced to prison for his role. His sentencing has led to an investigation that also involves current and former NBA players and raises questions about the integrity of professional basketball.The scandal centers on the use of “proposition betting” that doesn't depend on which team wins, but on specific players and how conspirators allegedly used information that is generally not publicly announced to place bets that almost certainly would win. Federal agents noticed strange betting activity, found it was connected to people who knew secret NBA game plans, and ended up charging many people involved.Timothy McCormack admitted in court that he used secret information about NBA players to place bets that almost always won. He knew some players would leave games early or not play their best, and he used that knowledge to make big bets and huge profits.At his sentencing in Brooklyn, McCormack spoke honestly about his long battle with gambling:""I've struggled with a gambling addiction for more than half my life,"" he said.Even though prosecutors wanted him to go to prison for about four years, the judge, LaShann DeArcy Hall, gave him a two-year sentence, saying his addiction was an important factor.The judge also pointed out how serious the crime was, saying:""There is no question this is a serious crime... Sports matters to me as an individual, as it should to society.""Prosecutors said McCormack was a key part in the case, adding that scams like this wouldn’t happen without people like him.Two NBA players, Terry Rozier and Jontay Porter, are involved in the investigation, but their situations are different.Jontay Porter, who used to play for the Toronto Raptors, admitted he took part in the scheme. He shared information about his own games and changed how he played to help with the bets. Porter pled guilty in 2024, has been banned from the NBA, and is waiting to hear his punishment after co-operating with the investigators.Terry Rozier, who plays for the Miami Heat but is on unpaid leave, has been charged with helping friends place bets by affecting his performance in a 2023 game. Rozier says he is not guilty and is free on a $3 million bond. His next court hearing is in March.","Timothy mccormack is the first person to be sentenced for his role in the case.

Dana White responds to Mauricio Sulaiman and defends Zuffa Boxing plans

Dana White has publicly responded after Mauricio Sulaiman accused Zuffa Boxing of bullying its way into professional boxing, bringing a growing power struggle into full view. The comments surfaced ahead of Zuffa Boxing’s first event under its Paramount+ deal, as debate intensified over how the new promotion plans to operate within the sport.Mauricio Sulaiman, the president of the World Boxing Council, questioned Dana White’s approach and said the promotion was being aggressive toward boxing’s traditional structure. He suggested that Zuffa Boxing’s arrival created unnecessary tension with long-established sanctioning bodies that have governed world titles for decades. The criticism followed earlier concerns about whether Sulaiman would even be allowed to present the WBC belt at a recent superfight overseen by White. Dana White rejected those claims and said Zuffa Boxing has no intention of taking over boxing or sidelining existing organizations.Replying to an Instagram post shared by Boxing Social, Dana White said Zuffa Boxing is not changing the foundations of professional boxing. Dana White stated that the Ali Act would remain fully intact and unchanged, stressing that fighters would continue to receive the same legal protections they have now.Dana White also said established sanctioning bodies would continue operating as usual. He specifically named the WBC, WBA, IBF, and WBO, and said promoters such as Oscar De La Hoya, Eddie Hearn, and Bob Arum’s Top Rank would continue doing business without interference.“I’m just doing something different,” Dana White wrote, questioning why his actions were being described as bullying. He added that fighters would still be free to compete across promotions and pursue opportunities outside Zuffa Boxing if they choose. Mauricio Sulaiman had earlier expanded on his concerns in an interview with Boxing Social, saying there was no need for confrontation. Mauricio Sulaiman argued that boxing already has a system built on history, tradition, and recognized world titles, and warned against what he viewed as unnecessary disruption.To support his position, Mauricio Sulaiman pointed to fighters currently linked to Zuffa Boxing who remain active within the WBC structure. He cited Callum Walsh, the WBC Continental Americas champion, who is set to headline Zuffa Boxing’s debut event. He also mentioned Dalton Smith and Conor Benn as fighters still pursuing WBC titles.The debate grew louder after IBF cruiserweight champion Jai Opetaia joined the Zuffa roster, raising questions about title unification. Recent reports suggest Zuffa Boxing may allow fighters like Jai Opetaia to pursue unification bouts while remaining under the promotion’s banner. Dana White’s comments also came as the proposed Ali Revival Act cleared a House committee. As Zuffa Boxing prepares for its launch, the exchange highlights rising tension between boxing’s traditional leadership and its newest major entrant.","Dana white responds to wbc chief mauricio sulaiman.

‘Reigning MVP’ Is Back in the Room: Josh Allen Named AP 2025 NFL MVP Finalist Again,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/reigning-mvp-is-back-in-the-room-josh-allen-named-ap-2025-nfl-mvp-finalist-again/articleshow/127168316.cms,"Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen warms up before a regular-season game in Orchard Park, N.Y., during the 2025 NFL season.

Josh Allen’s 2025 season made voters look past playoff disappointment

The finalist field shows how narrow Allen’s margin really is

Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen is back where the league keeps expecting him to be. On Jan. 22, Allen was named a finalist for the Associated Press 2025 NFL Most Valuable Player award, putting him in the same conversation that has followed his prime for most of the decade.The winner will be announced at “NFL Honors” on Feb. 5 at the Palace of Fine Arts in San Francisco, three days before Super Bowl LX. Allen enters as the reigning MVP, a label that now cuts both ways. It raises the standard. It sharpens the scrutiny.Allen’s regular-season case is built on output, durability, and historical pace. He completed 69.3% of his passes in 2025, throwing for 3,668 yards, 25 touchdowns, and 10 interceptions, while posting a 102.2 passer rating. He added 579 rushing yards and 14 touchdowns, continuing to blur the line between quarterback and short-yardage weapon.The Bills reached the playoffs for a seventh straight season, but the run ended early. Buffalo lost to Denver in the divisional round, and the organization fired Sean McDermott soon after. That context matters. MVP voters often penalize postseason flameouts, even when the award is technically based on the regular season.Still, Allen stacked milestones at a rate few quarterbacks have matched. According to the Bills’ official site, his 2025 season included becoming the youngest and fastest player to reach 300 regular-season touchdowns, passing Cam Newton for most rushing touchdowns by a quarterback, and surpassing Peyton Manning for most total touchdowns by a player age 30 or younger. He also reached 30,000 career passing yards and recorded multiple games with both passing and rushing dominance that had never been seen before.The résumé reads like a counterargument to voter fatigue. Allen did not just repeat past success. He extended it.Allen is not alone. The AP named Trevor Lawrence , Drake Maye, Christian McCaffrey, and Matthew Stafford as fellow finalists, per the Associated Press. Every name brings a different type of pressure.Maye led the NFL in passer rating and completion percentage while taking New England to the AFC championship game. Stafford led the league with 4,707 passing yards and 46 touchdowns and earned his first first-team All-Pro nod. McCaffrey once again separated himself as an all-purpose threat, finishing with 2,298 yards from scrimmage while helping San Francisco survive a season riddled with injuries.Voting closed before the playoffs, but context still lingers. A nationwide panel of 50 media members ranked their top five choices, with first-place votes carrying 10 points, per the Associated Press. Allen won this award last year by edging out Lamar Jackson, despite Jackson earning first-team All-Pro honors.That history matters. Allen enters this vote as the man to beat, but also the one voters may feel they have already rewarded.","Josh allen is a finalist for the associated press 2025 nfl most valuable player award.

How football helped shape Tom Brady’s parenting philosophy

Success through a father’s lens

Tom Brady may be remembered as the most successful quarterback in NFL history, but in recent years, the former New England Patriots and Tampa Bay Buccaneers star has often spoken about a role he values even more being a father.He wrote in his personal newsletter about what it really means to be a ""great father."" He said something that people all over the world have since found touching: ""I think part of being a great father is being a great example of doing what it takes to take care of your family.""The words capture a side of Brady that goes beyond Super Bowls, MVPs and championship parades.Brady explained that for much of his life, taking care of his family meant dedicating himself fully to football. The long hours, strict routines and intense focus were not just about winning games, but about showing his children what commitment and responsibility look like in real life.Brady says that being a parent doesn't just mean reading bedtime stories or helping with homework. It can also mean being a good role model by being disciplined, working hard, and being consistent.He believes children learn more by watching how their parents live than by listening to what they say.Brady is a father to three children Jack, Benjamin and Vivian. After his divorce from Gisele Bündchen in 2022, he has spoken openly about adjusting to co-parenting and finding balance between work and family.In recent months, Brady has shared several moments from his travels with his children across Europe, posting pictures from Germany, the Netherlands and Spain. The images show a relaxed side of the former athlete, enjoying simple moments away from the spotlight.Brady's comment makes it clear that success isn't just about trophies or records. He thinks that being a role model for his kids, someone they can look up to for advice, values, and a strong work ethic, is also a sign of success.He has acknowledged many times that winning Super Bowls didn't make him a great father, but the process of being better at his profession did help him become a better parent.A lot of followers, especially those who are trying to manage work and family life, have agreed with such a point of view.Brady's quote of the day is short but quite strong. It reminds parents all over the world that setting a good example might sometimes be more important than doing big things.","Tom brady wrote about what it really means to be a ""great father"" in his newsletter.

How Kobe Bryant’s 81-point night at Staples Center defines greatness long after his passing?

Twenty years ago today, Kobe Bryant put on a performance that changed how basketball is seen. On January 22, 2006, the Los Angeles Lakers guard scored 81 points in a regular‑season game against the Toronto Raptors — the second‑highest scoring total in NBA history behind only Wilt Chamberlain’s legendary 100‑point night from 1962. This wasn’t just a big scoring night, it was also a defining moment in Bryant’s career.That night was special not just because of how many points Kobe scored, but also the way he scored them. He defended well, made his own shots, and played strongly throughout the whole game. Even 20 years later, fans and experts still remember how amazing that night was and see it as how it marks Kobe as one of the best scorers in NBA history.On the evening of January 22, at Staples Center in Los Angeles, Kobe Bryant turned a seemingly ordinary game into an unforgettable moment. The first half didn’t go in favor of the Los Angeles Lakers, but Kobe didn’t let the game slip away. He kept scoring again and again, making jump shots, hitting threes, and drawing fouls, helping to keep his team in the game.By the end of the game, Kobe had scored 81 points. He made 28 shots out of 46 attempts, hit seven three-pointers, and scored 18 free throws.He also scored rebounds and made steals, helping his team in many ways. That night, he scored more than half of his team’s total points and broke long-standing team records, including Elgin Baylor’s 71-point mark, carrying them to a 122-104 victory.Kobe Bryant’s 81-point game was more than just a record, it changed how people view scoring in today’s NBA. Very few players had ever come close to scoring that much, and very few have done it, especially in a game that was truly competitive. While Wilt Chamberlain’s 100‑point night remains the highest in the league, many people see Kobe’s 81 points as more impressive because of the tough game situation and how he scored on his own. Over the years, that night has become one of the most important moments in Kobe Bryant's career and his lasting legacy long after his tragic passing.","On january 22, 2006, kobe bryant scored 81 points in a regular-season game against the toronto raptors.

Rockets vs Key Matchup: Embiid vs. Sengun

What’s at Stake for Philadelphia 76ers

for the Philadelphia 76ers on Thursday night against the Houston Rockets. The designation is tied to right ankle injury management, and unless there is a late change, he is expected to play at Wells Fargo Center.Embiid did not play in Philadelphia’s last game against the Phoenix Suns on Tuesday. The team chose rest over risk, with the focus on having him available for this matchup. His return comes against a Houston team competing for playoff positioning and built around size in the frontcourt.This season has been uneven for Joel Embiid. Injuries have limited him to 23 games, but when he has played, production has not been an issue. He is averaging 24.2 points and 7.0 rebounds per game while shooting 47.7 percent from the field.Earlier this month, Embiid dealt with left knee problems. The current ankle issue is being handled cautiously, but the probable tag suggests the team is comfortable with his condition. Philadelphia’s offense has struggled without him, particularly in scoring efficiency and rebounding.Both teams enter the game with key players unavailable or uncertain.Houston’s injuries thin out its rotation, especially in the frontcourt, which could matter if Embiid plays his usual minutes.If Joel Embiid is on the floor, the primary focus will be his matchup with Alperen Sengun. Sengun has been Houston’s most consistent inside scorer and is averaging more than 20 points per game. With Steven Adams out, Sengun will be asked to handle Embiid largely without help from a traditional backup center.Philadelphia has struggled on the boards when Embiid sits. His presence could quickly change that, while also forcing Houston to adjust its defensive coverages.The Sixers are trying to gain ground in a tight Eastern Conference race. A home win would help stabilize their position and reinforce how dependent the team remains on Embiid’s availability.Also read: Houston Rockets vs Philadelphia 76ers injury report: Injured and questionable players, head-to-head records, team stats, and more (January 22, 2026) Tip-off is scheduled for 7:00 p.m. ET.

NEW DELHI: The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) on Thursday all but confirmed its non-participation in the upcoming T20 World Cup as it stood by its decision not to travel to India for the tournament.""We want to play the World Cup, but we won't play in India,"" BCB president Aminul Islam Bulbul said.He also questioned the conduct of the ICC Board meeting held earlier this week. “We will keep fighting. There were some shocking calls in the ICC Board Meeting. The Mustafizur issue is not an isolated single issue. They (India) were the sole decision makers in that issue,” he added.In a strong statement, Islam further said, ""ICC had denied us our request to shift our matches away from India. We are not sure about the status of world cricket. Its popularity is going down. They have locked away 200 million people. Cricket is going to the Olympics, but if a country like us is not going there, it is ICC's failure.""However, Bangladesh sports advisor Asif Nazrul still hoped for ""justice"" from the ICC.
