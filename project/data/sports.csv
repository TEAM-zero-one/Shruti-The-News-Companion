What happened in the last Asia Cup?

NEW DELHI: There’s a growing buzz around the Asia Cup 2025 , with fans flooding social media with questions: When is the Asia Cup? What’s the schedule? When will the fixtures be released? Where will the tournament be held? As anticipation builds, the excitement around the 17th edition of the continental tournament is reaching fever pitch.The Asia Cup 2025 is scheduled to be held in September, and like the last edition, it will be played in the T20 format.The tournament will feature a total of eight teams.The five full members of the Asian Cricket Council — Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka — have earned automatic qualification. They will be joined by Hong Kong, Oman, and the United Arab Emirates, who secured their spots by finishing in the top three of the 2024 ACC Men's Premier Cup.Defending champions India will return to protect their crown, having thrashed Sri Lanka by 10 wickets in the final to clinch their eighth Asia Cup title, the most by any team in the tournament’s history.The 2023 Asia Cup was surrounded by political tensions, with India refusing to travel to Pakistan. As a result, India played their matches in Sri Lanka under a hybrid hosting model.In a six-nation tournament that included Nepal, India dominated the Super Fours, handing arch-rivals Pakistan a crushing 228-run defeat, effectively knocking them out of the competition.The final, held in Colombo, was one-sided as Mohammed Siraj’s fiery spell saw him claim six wickets, bundling Sri Lanka out for just 50 runs.India chased down the target in no time to lift the trophy in style.Post-Asia Cup, India also declined to travel to Pakistan for the ICC Champions Trophy 2025, playing all their matches in Dubai.In the group stage, they beat co-hosts Pakistan who failed to progress further. India went on to defeat New Zealand in the final to claim the Champions Trophy title.","The asia cup 2025 is scheduled to be held in september.

HASSAN: Heart Lamp , a collection of short stories by city-based Kannada writer Banu Mushtaq , has won the prestigious International Booker Prize 2025 . The book was translated from Kannada to English by Madikeri-based translator Deepa Bhasthi.An advocate and journalist by profession, Banu Mushtaq has made her mark as a storyteller, poet, novelist, and social activist.The award was announced at a ceremony held at London’s Tate Modern. Author Max Porter, who chaired the 2025 judging panel, revealed Heart Lamp as the winner — notably the first short story collection to receive this honour.“Heart Lamp is something genuinely new for English readers,” said Porter. “A radical translation that ruffles language to create new textures in a plurality of Englishes. It challenges and expands our understanding of translation.”He praised the book’s vibrant and uplifting narratives, rooted in Kannada yet enriched with the socio-political depth of various dialects and languages. The stories, he noted, explore themes such as women’s experiences, reproductive rights, faith, caste, power structures, and oppression.“This was the book the judges really loved, right from our first reading,” Porter said. “It’s been a joy to witness the evolving appreciation of these stories through the diverse perspectives of the jury.”After becoming the first Kannada author to win the International Booker Prize, Banu told TOI: “This prize shows the true potential of the Kannada language, its literature, and the possibilities ahead if more works are translated into other languages, especially English.”She emphasized the need to introduce more Kannada literature to a global audience. “There is a need to bring more and more Kannada works to readers around the world,” she said.Recalling the final moments before the announcement, Banu said, “It was very tense. When Max Porter announced Heart Lamp as the winner, it was electrifying. Everyone stood up and began congratulating me.”She described the honour as a shared victory. “This is not individual recognition. It’s recognition of teamwork,” she said, adding that despite the global attention, “My writing will remain the same.”Reflecting on her journey, she signed off with: “Life is amazing — from travelling in bullock carts to standing on this global stage.”","Heart lamp is a collection of short stories by city-based kannada writer banu mushtaq.

Greenstone Lobo predicts Virat Kohli & Rohit Sharma's ODI future

NEW DELHI: Chennai Super Kings’ nightmare run in IPL 2025 has left fans frustrated, and at the centre of the storm is their iconic captain, MS Dhoni The 43-year-old legend, who returned to lead the side mid-season after Ruturaj Gaikwad's injury, has found himself under intense scrutiny as CSK now stare at a possible last-place finish, a first in their IPL history.With just one game left, CSK have lost all five matches where they batted first this season.Their latest defeat came against Rajasthan Royals on Tuesday, where the Chennai bowlers failed to defend 188.Teen prodigy Vaibhav Suryavanshi starred again, smashing a composed 57, while Akash Madhwal and Yudhvir Singh Charak took three wickets each to help Rajasthan chase the target with ease.The result has sparked a wave of reactions on social media, with many fans even calling for the veteran's retirement from the IPL.Once known for his calm leadership and match-winning instincts, Dhoni now finds himself at the receiving end of criticism for not being able to inspire a struggling CSK unit this season.Batting down the order, Dhoni has scored 196 runs in 13 matches, with a strike rate of 135.17 and an average of 24.5, decent but far from the impact performances he once delivered consistently.CSK’s problems, however, go beyond Dhoni.The overseas players have failed to fire, and several veterans have looked out of form.If Chennai doesn’t beat table-toppers Gujarat Titans by a big margin in their final league game, they will likely finish last, an unthinkable position for the five-time champions.Whether this season marks the end of an era for MS Dhoni remains to be seen, but fans online are making their voices heard louder than ever.","Csk have lost all five matches where they batted first this season.

Auston Matthews’ hockey dream wasn’t cheap and his mom took the weight

“I used to work in the morning for Starbucks, in the afternoon the restaurant, i was very fortunate to have two jobs. And believe me, if they would have more hours, I would have more jobs.""





Before Auston Matthews was an NHL superstar, his biggest supporter was clocking into two jobs, trying to make ends meet. His mom, Ema Matthews , didn’t just believe in his dream, she bankrolled it, penny by penny, from behind a Starbucks counter. For families without deep pockets, hockey can be financially brutal. But Ema’s resilience turned obstacles into opportunity and her son into one of the league’s brightest stars. Her story is the heartwarming reminder that every great athlete often has a real-life superhero cheering from the sidelines.Ice time, gear, coaching, travel, youth hockey isn’t just a sport, it’s a financial beast. For the Matthews family, especially with Ema being originally from Hermosillo, Mexico, the culture and cost of the sport were both daunting. But she took on the challenge without hesitation, picking up multiple jobs including a gig at Starbucks to ensure Auston never missed a chance to grow on the ice.Ema shared in a past interview that the cost of hockey often reached up to $20,000 a year, a heavy ask for any middle-class family.To make it work, she didn’t just cut corners, she picked up shifts and poured lattes while helping Auston stay focused on the sport. She even deposited small amounts of money in his account so he could grab food with teammates like a regular teen.Ema Matthews’ story also breaks stereotypes. In a sport dominated by players from Canada and northern U.S. states, Auston’s rise as a player of Mexican heritage makes his success even more impactful. It's not just about talent, it’s about trailblazing, especially for kids of color or immigrant families who rarely see themselves represented in hockey.Auston Matthews is one of the Toronto Maple Leafs ’ biggest stars and a face of the NHL. He’s not just known for his goal-scoring skills but also for his poise and work ethic, traits his mom likely helped instill. While fans celebrate his success on the ice, stories like Ema’s remind us of the sacrifices behind the scenes that made it possible.Ema Matthews’ story shows what’s possible when love, grit, and hustle lead the way.","Auston matthews is one of the toronto maple leafs’ biggest stars and a face of the nhl.

Why the Milwaukee Bucks Consider It

Risks for Both Sides

Could thepull off a massive trade to pair Luka Dončić with? After a disappointing playoff exit, the Lakers are exploring bold moves to rebuild their championship-contending roster. One potential blockbuster deal could bring the two-time MVP to Los Angeles, reshaping the NBA landscape.The Los Angeles Lakers’ early playoff departure at the hands of the Minnesota Timberwolves has forced the front office into a critical offseason. With Luka Dončić’s future uncertain beyond next season and LeBron James nearing retirement, general manager Rob Pelinka faces tough decisions.The team must choose between:- Building depth around Dončić and James.- Swinging for a third superstar to form a historic trio.A proposed trade by Colby Faria of the Sporting News could deliver Giannis Antetokounmpo, giving the Los Angeles Lakers one of the most dominant duos in NBA history.Here’s how the deal could work:- Instant Championship Window: Pairing Dončić and Giannis Antetokounmpo would create an unstoppable pick-and-roll duo.- LeBron’s Last Ride: James may delay retirement for a shot at a fifth title.- Long-Term Star Power: Secures a future cornerstone if Dončić stays.- Draft Capital: Multiple unprotected picks offer flexibility for a rebuild.- Young Talent: Reaves and Knecht provide immediate contributors.- Financial Relief: Moves off Giannis’ supermax for future flexibility.While the trade is enticing, there are potential pitfalls:- For the Lakers: If the gamble fails, Dončić could leave in 2026, leaving the team in a full rebuild.- For the Bucks: Trading a franchise icon risks alienating fans unless the return yields future success.As analyst Colby Faria noted: ""If Giannis Antetokounmpo ended up with the Lakers, it would create one of the most talented duos in NBA history between he and Luka Dončić.""Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Golden State Warriors could eye $70 million Boston Celtics point guard to boster squad after unfortunate playoff exit The Lakers’ front office must weigh short-term glory against long-term stability.

RR, who had struggled to finish games this season, finally managed a convincing win, lifting them off the bottom of the table.Chennai Super Kings, on the other hand, were restricted to 187-8 thanks to an impressive spell by Akash Madhwal, who picked up 3 wickets for 29 runs and halted CSK’s momentum in the final overs.While the match had major playoff implications, it was Suryavanshi’s respectful gesture towards Dhoni that fans couldn’t stop talking about. Social media quickly flooded with praise for the teenager's humility and deep respect for one of cricket’s greatest icons.As Rajasthan ends its season on a high and Chennai fights to avoid a historic last-place finish, one thing is clear, Vaibhav Suryavanshi is a rising star with both talent and character.",14-year-old vaibhav suryavanshi touched ms dhoni’s feet in a touching gesture of respect.

NFL shocked as Commanders owner claims their franchise now deserves the title of “America’s Team”



There’s a running joke in the NFL that no matter the day, no matter the stakes, and no matter your team loyalty, odds are, you’ll be watching the Dallas Cowboys . Whether it’s Sunday night, Monday night, or even Thanksgiving, the Cowboys are somehow always on your screen. That familiar sigh? It’s the ritual resignation of fans across the country, muttering at the NFL’s favoritism and Jerry Jones' media pull — and still, they watch. Why? Because, love them or hate them, the Cowboys are ratings gold.In 2024, Dallas once again proved their status as television royalty. According to Nielsen, the NFL dominated American television with 72 of the top 100 broadcasts — and the Cowboys claimed 13 of those spots. That tied them with the reigning champions, the Kansas City Chiefs. Other elite teams like the Ravens, Packers, 49ers, and Bills trailed behind. It’s a striking reflection of the Cowboys' cultural grip, even if their playoff success hasn't mirrored their broadcast domination.But just as Dallas enjoys its primetime presence, a surprising voice has emerged to challenge the team's iconic nickname — ""America’s Team.""During a recent community event in Washington, D.C., Marjorie Harris , wife of Washington Commanders ’ managing partner Josh Harris, made a statement that ruffled feathers in Dallas. While discussing her excitement for the NFL Draft coming to D.C. in 2027, she casually — but confidently — staked a claim that sent shockwaves through Cowboys Nation.""We have so much to look forward to, and look, the Commanders are America's Team ,"" Harris said with a smile. ""What better place than to have the NFL Draft than in the Mall?""The response was swift and predictably intense. Cowboys fans — who’ve clung to the “America’s Team” label since it was famously coined by NFL Films’ John Facenda in 1978 — weren’t pleased. The nickname has been a badge of honor, a symbol of national popularity that transcended even the team’s on-field performance.But in 2024, the Washington Commanders gave football fans plenty of reasons to sit up and take notice. After a dismal 4-win season in 2023, the team made a stunning turnaround, notching 12 wins and making it all the way to the NFC Championship. Spearheaded by dynamic rookie quarterback Jayden Daniels, Washington looked electric, confident, and reborn. Credit goes to new GM Adam Peters and head coach Dan Quinn, who reshaped the team with purpose and resilience. But netizens are not finding enough reasons to give them the tag.Marjorie Harris’ bold declaration didn’t come out of nowhere. Unlike many team owners' spouses, she has taken an active role in the franchise’s community efforts and serves as the chair of the Washington Commanders Foundation. Her visible presence and leadership since the family's acquisition of the team in 2023 has only strengthened ties between the organization and its fan base.And perhaps that’s the larger point Harris was making. Her comment wasn't just about branding; it was about momentum, pride, and community engagement. The Commanders are not just back — they're becoming a franchise that fans, both old and new, can rally behind.Even Philadelphia Eagles fans — fresh off a Super Bowl win — have spent more time this offseason analyzing Jayden Daniels than celebrating their own title. And now, with Cowboys fans joining the fray in outrage, Washington seems to have successfully reinserted itself into NFC East relevance.Sure, Dallas isn’t going anywhere in terms of media exposure. They’ll still headline over a dozen national broadcasts next season. The brand is as powerful as ever. But for the first time in a while, someone’s actually challenging their long-standing title — not with nostalgia, but with fresh energy and results.So, are the Commanders really America’s Team now? Not yet. But if they keep winning, and keep making the right kind of noise — both on and off the field — that conversation might not sound so outlandish in a few years.And when the 2027 NFL Draft rolls into the National Mall, the whole country just might tune in… whether the Cowboys are playing or not.Also Read: Is this the end of the NFL's most beloved kicker?

NEW DELHI: The IPL 2025 showdown between Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) and Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) lit up with drama as tensions boiled over between spinner Digvesh Rathi and SRH opener Abhishek Sharma during the eighth over of a pulsating run chase.The flashpoint came when Rathi dismissed a blazing Abhishek, who had hammered 59 off just 20 balls in a ferocious assault on the LSG bowlers. Attempting to launch a wide googly over the off-side, Abhishek mistimed the shot and sliced it to sweeper cover, where Shardul Thakur held onto a sharp running catch.What should have been a moment of triumph quickly turned confrontational.Rathi, known for his flamboyant ""book-sign"" celebration, unleashed it once more after the crucial breakthrough. However, the gesture didn’t sit well with Abhishek. Visibly agitated, the southpaw exchanged heated words with Rathi, prompting the umpires and teammates to intervene and cool tempers.In a video that quickly went viral, Abhishek can be seen mouthing to Rathi while walking back to the pavilion: “Teri choti pakad ke marunga” — “I'll grab your braid and beat you up.”At the time of the dismissal, SRH were flying high at 99 runs, seemingly on course to chase down LSG’s formidable 205-run total. Abhishek’s fiery innings, studded with four boundaries and six massive sixes, had given Hyderabad the perfect launchpad.Earlier in the contest, Mitchell Marsh (65) and Aiden Markram (61) laid a solid foundation for LSG with explosive half-centuries. The innings stuttered in the middle overs after skipper Rishabh Pant ’s departure for just 7, but Nicholas Pooran’s late fireworks — a 45-run blitz off 26 balls — propelled LSG past the 200-run mark.While the match had its fair share of fireworks, it was the Abhishek-Rathi spat that grabbed the spotlight. Fans flooded social media with reactions and clips, turning the heated exchange into one of the most talked-about moments of the IPL season.","Ipl 2025 showdown between lucknow super giants and sunrisers hyderabad lit up with drama.

Who is Kevin De Bryune's wife Michele Lacroix? How an X exchange sparked a lifelong bond,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/news/who-is-kevin-de-bryunes-wife-michele-lacroix-how-an-x-exchange-sparked-a-lifelong-bond/articleshow/121300518.cms,"Image Source: Getty

A love story born online and went to the marriage altar

Michele Lacroix is more than Kevin De Bryune's wife

In the realm of football, you will be hard pressed to find anyone who doesn’t respect Kevin De Bruyne. But beyond the roar of the stadium and the pressure of elite competition is a personal narrative equally compelling. His wife, Michèle Lacroix, has been a rock, providing the support, love, and grounding that he has needed. Their love story didn’t launch with a glittering red carpet or the introduction of celebrities; instead, it all began with a single unassuming favourite on X. That small favor forged a lifelong bond that endures even in the face of time and fame.In 2014, on loan at Werder Bremen, he tweeted something that caught the eye of Michèle, a student at university in Genk, Belgium. She gave the tweet a like, and Kevin’s friend, being a good digital wingman, slid into her DMs on his behalf. That online exchange of words soon became, well, something a bit more conventional: regular conversations and, ultimately, what became a budding romance not long after.And two years later, Kevin got down on one knee in front of the Eiffel Tower in Paris, as romantic as it gets. In June 2017, they were married in Sorrento, Italy, in a love-filled celebration that inaugurated their married life.The couple now have three children together – Mason, Rome, and Suri – and a love that still thrives off the pitch.They have a refreshingly down-to-earth relationship despite the fanfare of professional football. Michèle has long been described as Kevin’s partner in crime and best friend, to him, and she has been credited for bringing balance to Kevin’s life. In sickness and in health — or in this case, in high times and low ones — they are riding out the ups and downs of the athlete's life together.As Kevin is praised on the field, Michèle has made a name for herself in her own right. She is a host of the Dutch-language podcast Secret Society and holds forth about pop culture and women’s issues. She’s not merely the sidekick to Kevin’s narrative, an adjunct to another story.Also Read: Manchester City chairman reveals tribute plans for midfielder Kevin De Bruyne In addition, Michèle often contributes to charity events, features in campaigns (such as her contractually bound McDonald’s Belgium commercial), and serves as an unwavering shoulder through injuries, victories, and club moves of Kevin. The next chapter in Kevin’s journey is on the horizon, away from Manchester City, wherever it is now, one thing is for sure – Michèle will be by his side, in every way.","Michele lacroix is more than kevin de bruyne's wife.

Mariners use Giancarlo Stanton's skills to end drought of not appearing in World Series

Giancarlo Stanton has been a name in the homes of baseball fans for years. But now, while recovering from injuries in 2025, rumors are spreading that the New York Yankees will trade him. A possible new destination? The Seattle Mariners. With prospects rising in New York, Stanton may no longer be required. But for a team like the Mariners, who are looking for a strong playoff push, Stanton's power at the plate would be the game-changer.Giancarlo Stanton has not appeared in a game thus far in 2025 due to both elbows being hurt. Meanwhile, Ben Rice has stepped in and played wonderful baseball. Along with other stars like Aaron Judge and Jason Dominguez, Rice has kept the Yankees on top. With so much youth talent, the Yankees might decide to say goodbye to Stanton.Giancarlo Stanton was the Yankees' top slugger at one time. He joined the Yankees in 2018 and immediately established an MLB record for the most difficult home run ever hit at 121.7 mph. That record still stands today. Being healthy, however, has not been a cakewalk.As Zachary Howell of Clutch Points informs us, it's unlikely Stanton can ever play for a complete season again. But even so, according to Howell, Stanton has some value, especially for a team that wants power in the playoffs.The Seattle Mariners are one of the few MLB teams never to have appeared in the World Series. Adding a large bat-like Stanton's would give their offense the boost that it needs so desperately. Even though Stanton was injured, he's a power hitter when he's not injured. Last year when the Yankees made their playoff run, he was among their best players.Giancarlo Stanton had played for the Miami Marlins. He also won the MVP award. If they trade for him, the Mariners will be acquiring a player with this much experience and playoff strength, something that they greatly lack.If Giancarlo Stanton joins the Mariners, he brings more than just home runs—he brings veteran leadership. His postseason experience could be vital in mentoring younger players and energizing Seattle’s clubhouse for a serious playoff run.If Giancarlo Stanton joins Seattle, he could be the missing piece. His leadership, power, and postseason pedigree might finally push the Mariners over the edge and end their long-standing World Series drought once and for all.Also Read: Who Is Cody Bellinger’s Wife Chase Carter's Ex-Boyfriend Giancarlo Stanton?","Giancarlo stanton may no longer be needed in new york with ben rice doing well.

Zoey Stark’s injury overshadows Rhea Ripley’s MITB victory

WWE Superstar Zoey Stark made her comeback to the limelight in a tragic manner on the recent episode of Monday Night RAW. What was supposed to be a critical milestone in her career, Stark got severely injured in her knee in a triple-threat qualifying match for the 2025 Women's Money in the Bank (MITB) ladder match. The incident has not only sidelined her from one of WWE’s most prestigious events but may also signal a prolonged absence from in-ring competition.The accident occurred at the Bon Secours Wellness Arena in Greenville, South Carolina, during a MITB qualifier bout between Zoey Stark, Kairi Sane, and Rhea Ripley. At its climax, Stark tried her characteristic springboard dropkick—a sportslike move that requires agility and accuracy. In targeting Kairi Sane, Stark slipped in executing the springboard, resulting in her awkwardly landing on her right leg.The blow caused her knee to bend in a distinctly unnatural manner, quite visibly startling both supporters and commentators. The match instantly became secondary as paramedics rushed onto the field to treat the hurt athlete. After the botched maneuver, Stark fell to the floor, cradling her right knee and exhibiting obvious signs of pain and distress. The referee stopped the match for a moment and motioned for medical attention. WWE ringside physicians made their way into the ring and evaluated her condition.Despite the extent of the injury, Stark first tried to leave the ring independently. She tried to stand, only to fall again, as she could no longer bear the weight of herself. Eventually, she was assisted backstage by medical personnel, affirming the severity of the ordeal.Veteran WWE play-by-play commentator Michael Cole guessed on-air that Stark may have re-aggravated an old injury. Stark had extensive knee surgery in 2021 to repair a torn ACL, MCL, and meniscus—injuries requiring months of rehabilitation.With the visual similarity and reaction of Stark, there is an increasing fear that her current injury is a recurrence or exacerbation of the same condition of the knee. But to date, WWE has not issued a formal medical diagnosis or recovery timeline. The wrestling fraternity came in support of Stark after the injury. AEW wrestler Thunder Rosa showed her concern with a heartfelt post on social media:""Wrestling is a lovely and risky sport. We leave everything on the table every time we go to the ring, and we also put a lot on the line when we do what we are passionate about. Zoey Stark, I love you, sister, and I hope that you heal soon."" — Thunder Rosa through X (previously Twitter)Zoey Stark's RAW match was her first on television since January. She had last remained an active member of the dissolved faction Pure Fusion Collective, after Sonya Deville and Shayna Baszler left. Stark was competing mainly in non-televised WWE house shows and sporadic Main Event tapings before this return.As a result of her earlier knee damage incurred during her stint in NXT, Stark was drafted to the main roster as part of the 2023 WWE Draft—a testament to how much the WWE believed in her promising future. The MITB qualifier was set to be a career-launching experience, which made her untimely injury so much more heartbreaking.With Stark out, the match went on between the remaining participants. Rhea Ripley took advantage of the situation, overpowering Kairi Sane and finishing the match with her characteristic Riptide finisher. The pinfall win earned Ripley a spot in the upcoming ladder match for Women's Money in the Bank, which is to be held on June 7. Ripley’s victory, however, was overshadowed by the concern surrounding Stark’s health, as WWE fans and analysts alike shifted focus to the severity of the injury.The extent of Stark’s injury remains unconfirmed by WWE, leaving her return date unknown. Given her history of severe knee damage, fans and medical experts fear that she could face another lengthy recovery process. This injury not only removes her from one of WWE’s most career-defining matches but also risks stalling the momentum she had just begun to regain. For now, Zoey Stark’s fans—and the WWE Universe as a whole—await official word from WWE’s medical team.",Wwe superstar zoey stark suffers a painful knee injury during mitb qualifier bout.

NEW DELHI: Abhishek Sharma stole the spotlight with a breathtaking 59 off just 20 balls, setting the tone for Sunrisers Hyderabad ’s emphatic six-wicket win over Lucknow Super Giants in Match 61 of IPL 2025 at the Ekana Stadium .The young left-hander’s fireworks at the top helped SRH chase down a challenging target of 206 with 10 balls to spare, dashing LSG’s hopes of making the playoffs.Opening alongside Atharva Taide, Abhishek came out with aggressive intent, taking on the bowlers from the outset.He smashed four boundaries and cleared the rope six times in his whirlwind knock, reaching his fifty real quick.His fearless hitting saw SRH race to 99 in under eight overs before he was dismissed by Digvesh Rathi, slicing a wide googly to sweeper cover, a moment that sparked a heated exchange between the two players.Even after Abhishek’s departure, SRH maintained control. Ishan Kishan contributed a brisk 35 off 28, while Heinrich Klaasen added a fluent 47 off 28 to ensure the chase stayed on track.Brief interruptions, including Kamindu Mendis retiring hurt, didn’t slow the innings, as Aniket Verma and Nitish Reddy finished the job comfortably in the 19th over.Earlier, Lucknow Super Giants posted a solid 205/7, thanks to Mitchell Marsh (65 off 39), Aiden Markram (61 off 38), and a late flourish from Nicholas Pooran (45 off 26).However, LSG’s bowling lacked sting, with only Digvesh Rathi (2/37 in 4 overs) managing breakthroughs. Their inability to contain runs during the powerplay and middle overs proved costly.With this result, SRH keep their campaign alive while LSG bow out of the playoff race. Abhishek Sharma’s explosive innings not only sealed the win but also reaffirmed his status as one of the most dangerous young batters in the league.","Abhishek sharma smashes 59 off just 20 balls in sunrisers hyderabad's six-wicket win over lucknow super giants.
