What happened on the field and why Tampa Bay made the call

Antonio Brown ’s reaction and the wider fallout



What this means for Shilo and the Sanders legacy

Antonio Brown’s social-media swipe at the Sanders family arrived hours after the Tampa Bay Buccaneers moved on from rookie safety Shilo Sanders, escalating an already tense offseason storyline that blends on-field discipline, family legacy and off-field baggage.Shilo Sanders was ejected late in Tampa Bay’s preseason finale following a punch thrown at tight end Zach Davidson — an act Buccaneers coach Todd Bowles publicly condemned. “You can’t throw punches in this league, that’s inexcusable,” Bowles said.“They're going to get you every time. You've got to grow from that.” Sanders had earlier drawn a pass-interference penalty in the same game, and with NFL rosters headed toward the 53-man deadline, the Bucs chose to cut ties rather than carry a disciplinary risk at a position where reliability matters.On X, Brown wrote bluntly: “Whole Sanders fam gonna end up getting cut out the league…” — a short, incendiary message that reopens questions about Deion Sanders’ sons and their NFL readiness.Brown has previously circulated footage and commentary that suggested the younger Sanders received advantages due to their father’s prominence, and his latest post doubles down on that narrative. Deion Sanders did not answer in kind; instead he publicly wished Brown well, choosing de-escalation over a media feud.Shilo’s path to pro stability was never straightforward: undrafted in April, he arrived with a solid college résumé (Jackson State, Colorado), a recent broken forearm and off-field financial complications, including a large civil judgment that has lingered in public filings.Cutting him now shifts the immediate question to other teams or practice squads willing to bet on his athletic upside despite maturity concerns. For Deion’s broader legacy, repeated public incidents involving his sons risk overshadowing his coaching renaissance — and fuel critics who claim influence alone won’t protect players from the league’s accountability standards.Also Read: Shedeur Sanders finally explains his reaction after being subbed out late against Rams in preseason finale Teams value talent — but in today’s NFL, availability and discipline are equally precious.

Clare initially turned down Tommy Fleetwood before love story started

Clare Fleetwood ’s support during heartbreaking near-misses

Tommy Fleetwood is one of the top-paid golfers in the world as of August 2025. On the PGA Tour itself, he has won more than $31 million in prize money. This statistic makes him one of the biggest-money winners in the history of the DP World Tour, with a career earnings total of around $35 million.Other sources of income have also bolstered Fleetwood, but still has yet to nab a win on the PGA Tour. In addition, he has taken home sponsorship deals with Nike, TaylorMade, and TAG Heuer, benefitting from a significant amount of millions as a result of golf's former Player Impact Program.Fleetwood met his wife, Clare, in 2015, which further blended his personal and professional lives. Clare was then a sports management executive when she became Tommy's client. Their work was the beginning of what would soon become a deeper relationship, despite their 23-year age difference.Clare explained how she initially turned down Tommy when he first asked her out because the age gap made her feel cautious. But after further thought, she succumbed, and the couple entered a relationship that shocked the golf world.The pair had concerns about whether mixing business with romance would work, but agreed to give it six months to see how it went.So when they did, they were surprised to find that the two arrangements reinforced each other, professionally and personally. Clare, who maintains a cool and calm approach, has regularly been acknowledged as a reason Tommy stays composed and relaxed in stressful situations on the course.Apart from materialistic dividends, there have been some massive emotional ups and downs in Fleetwood’s professional career. Clare has remained his rock through his lowest lows, which include several painful near misses on the PGA Tour.None was more heartbreaking than the one he endured at the Travelers Championship as Tommy once again finished in second place, this time the victim of a late charge by Keegan Bradley to come up one stroke short of the winner. Enticing words like these have shaped his career narrative to date, so near, but not close enough to cement that first PGA Tour title.Going into the last 18 holes of the Tour Championship, Fleetwood was quoted as a favourite, and Clare was back to have his back as always. Friends of the couple say Clare has been a great support to Tommy in dealing with the pressure, and his two losses have only made him more determined.Also Read: Who is golfer Tommy Fleetwood’s wife Clare?

Pop icon Taylor Swift may dominate the music charts and headlines for her relationship with Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce , but there’s another side to her that doesn’t often make the spotlight: her role as a godmother. Beyond the stadium appearances and sold-out tours, Swift plays a personal role in the lives of several celebrity children, showcasing the depth of her friendships and her influence beyond music.Swift’s first widely known godchild is Leo Thames King, son of actress Jaime King. Born in 2015, Leo quickly became a part of Swift’s inner circle, with the singer even penning emotional words inspired by the moment.When she first met him, Swift posted a touching photo with the caption, “Meeting my boy.” Jaime King, once a core member of Swift’s famous “squad,” has often spoken highly of her friend, calling her a “beautiful human being.” For King, naming Swift as godmother was “a really sacred thing,” signaling not just a celebrity connection but a genuine trust in the singer’s character.The most notable godparent role Swift holds is with the children of Hollywood power couple Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds. She is godmother to James, Inez, Betty, and Olin — a fact Swift humorously acknowledged while promoting Deadpool & Wolverine, writing, “Shout out to Wade Wilson, aka my godkids’ sperm donor.”Ryan Reynolds later clarified, “Swift is the godparent to my daughters.”Interestingly, the names James, Inez, and Betty are immortalized in Swift’s Folklore album, making her godmother role not just private but also creatively celebrated.Also Read: “She doesn’t include Blake”: Taylor Swift leans on Travis Kelce’s support and no longer values Blake Lively’s advice With five godchildren, Swift’s personal influence in Hollywood runs as deep as her professional success.

Shedeur Sanders and the ‘disaster’ label from Skip Bayless



Why Shedeur Sanders may need to leave Cleveland



The Cleveland Browns’ final preseason game against the Los Angeles Rams told a story few expected. For young quarterback Shedeur Sanders, who once flashed undeniable promise, the night unraveled into one of frustration and missed chances. Just weeks ago, he had impressed with sharp throws and composure against the Carolina Panthers. But this time, the rookie looked like a shadow of that quarterback—hesitant, disconnected, and left searching for answers.Sanders’ stat line against the Rams was forgettable: three completions on six attempts, totaling only 16 yards. For a player drafted in the fifth round after a dramatic slide, the performance raised immediate concerns. Skip Bayless didn’t sugarcoat it, branding the outing as a complete “disaster.” Yet, the analyst struck a careful balance—criticizing the moment while praising Sanders’ potential.“This young man can play quarterback at the highest level in this league,” Bayless said. “He is capable of being a franchise quarterback and taking a team to the promised land. But he's got the whole package. He's got enough size; he's not huge, but his arm is Brady-esque.It's at least as strong as Brady's. He can run... But the main things he has are poise and command, and leadership.”Bayless’ conviction underlines what scouts and fans noticed before the draft—Sanders isn’t short on talent. What he lacks, however, is the right environment to refine his game. Against Los Angeles, that truth became hard to ignore.The Browns took a gamble by selecting Sanders 144th overall, but their handling of him suggests hesitation more than investment. Instead of building on his momentum, Cleveland appears ready to relegate him to the practice squad. Making matters worse, Tyler Huntley showcased more polish in closing out the Rams game, further pushing Sanders down the depth chart.Bayless sees no upside in keeping the young quarterback trapped in Cleveland’s crowded roster.""Shedeur has to go elsewhere. The only way to get free of this situation is to free Shedeur from Cleveland. Free him. It's either for them to cut him, or them to practice squad him and some other team, somebody out there. They go sign him off of the practice squad.""That possibility looms large. Around the league, quarterback-needy teams continue to search for players with raw tools and long-term upside. Sanders, with his composure and leadership, fits that mold. If Cleveland fails to recognize it, another franchise just might.Although his final preseason outing didn’t unfold as he had hoped, Sanders still conveyed his gratitude in a Sunday Instagram post.""Thanks everyone for the [love] and support,"" Sanders wrote. ""There's a lot to learn from this preseason, but I'm really thankful for the opportunity to be out there. Day by day, rep by rep, I'll keep learning and getting better.""For now, Sanders’ NFL journey hangs in the balance. One poor performance does not define a career, but staying in the wrong situation can. His next move could determine whether he fades into obscurity—or rises to fulfill the promise so many still see in him.Also Read: Antonio Brown reignites feud with Deion Sanders, claims Shilo’s cut proves his sons can’t survive in NFL","Cleveland browns rookie quarterback shedeur sanders struggled against the los angeles rams.

Why Aaron Rodgers is a big-name addition, but not the single solution the Steelers need

What’s More Likely: Rich Eisen Talks Rams, Browns, Steelers, Vikings, Seahawks, Bucs, Falcons & More

Skylar Thompson ’s preseason spark and the message from Mike Tomlin



The arrival of Aaron Rodgers to Pittsburgh grabbed headlines, but the Steelers ’ culture of consistency suggests the team won’t hinge its season on one superstar. With 21 consecutive non-losing seasons and a roster built for physicality and depth, Pittsburgh still looks like a complete roster-first franchise rather than a one-man show.Aaron Rodgers brings experience, name recognition and the potential to lift passer play in key moments, yet the Steelers’ success has long been the product of complementary pieces. From veterans like DK Metcalf, Jonnu Smith and Jalen Ramsey to younger contributors such as Derrick Harmon and Jack Sawyer, Pittsburgh’s roster construction emphasizes balance.Last season’s 10–7 finish and a clutch record in one-possession games underscore a team mentality focused on situational toughness rather than star-dependent fireworks. As Rich Eisen put it on The Rich Eisen Show: “You know, I think it’s just the roster as a whole.”And while Eisen later added his vote for Rodgers — “Oh, I’ll go Aaron Rodgers. Come on now. What a disrespectful question that is.” — that doesn’t erase the reality that winning in Pittsburgh has historically been multi-dimensional.Preseason performances have shifted attention to the depth behind Rodgers. Skylar Thompson’s 11-of-13 passing, 152 yards and a touchdown in the preseason win over Carolina didn’t just look tidy — it raised questions about opportunity.Mike Tomlin didn’t downplay that impact: “He’s got playing experience. This guy started games in Miami. I think that experience shows — and we’re talking regular-season games.” That endorsement signals Pittsburgh’s willingness to trust proven depth rather than lean solely on a single veteran.Also Read: Shedeur Sanders finally explains his reaction after being subbed out late against Rams in preseason finale Realistically, the Steelers’ fortunes will be decided by coaching, health and the supporting cast as much as Rodgers’ arm. With an over/under win total around 8.5 and a tough schedule ahead, Pittsburgh’s identity — gritty, deep, and team-first — remains the most reliable predictor of whether this season ends with another playoff push.","Aaron rodgers brings experience, name recognition and the potential to lift passer play in key moments.

Pakistan squad:

The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) stunned many when it announced its 17-member squad for the upcoming UAE tri-series and Asia Cup 2025 without star batters Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan. Amid the speculation, PCB chairman Mohsin Naqvi has clarified that the decision was purely the work of selectors.“First of all, I don’t have even 1% role in putting players into the team or taking them out,” Naqvi told reporters on Saturday.“We have a selection committee and then an advisory body, they all sit together. The process goes through a lot — discussions that last 8–10 hours, sometimes for 2–3 days. Definitely, if a team is being selected, it’s in good hands, all professionals are there.

Quinton 'Rampage' Jackson's statement clears the air

The violent incident and its fallout

Quinton ""Rampage"" Jackson has spoken out for the first time after his son became embroiled in an incredible incident at a Knokx Pro Wrestling event at the LA Throwdown on August 23, 2025. The attack occurred in front of hundreds of viewers watching live on Kick during the professional wrestling match between Raja, a 25-year-old MMA fighter, and independent wrestler Stuart ‘Syko Stu’ Smith. Updates discussed include Syko Stu on the road to recovery, and Rampage recognised the incident as a 'work gone wrong'.To set the record straight, Rampage Jackson put out a message on X and set the record straight in a heartfelt post. He also contradicted speculation that Syko would suffer worse fates by announcing that Syko Stu is “conscious and stable"". He explained that the segment was to be entertainment, a ""work,"" but it did not quite turn out that way.Rampage attributed the event to poor judgment and a misunderstanding, emphasizing that his son was trained for MMA, not pro wrestling, and doesn't belong in one of those shows. Just days prior, he said Raja had received a concussion while MMA sparring and shouldn't have been competing.Rampage criticized Raja's actions in a statement and said he fears for the safety of his son and Syko Stu, who has been hospitalized with serious injuries, and apologized to both the injured wrestler and the Kick streaming platform.Also Read: From doubt to glory: Tapasya Gahlawat becomes U20 world wrestling champion The incident took place at a live Knokx Pro show, when Raja, who was not even scheduled to wrestle that night, entered the ring during Syko Stu‘s match.

Eventually, other performers stepped in to put a stop to the attack.As per the people in attendance, Raja was part of whatever was planned for the segment, but the stiff shots were not pre-planned. It said that the incident was the result of a backstage brawl in which Raja claimed Syko Stu threw a can of drink at him. Then he was pushed to take “revenge” in the ring, which he took as part of the show but much too far.Syko Stu, who is a U.S. Army veteran as well as a respected name in the independent wrestling scene, was hospitalized in serious condition but has since been reported to be stable. As the fallout from the incident reverberates through the wrestling and MMA worlds, the event has raised immediate questions about safety practices, training, and the involvement of civilians in live competition environments.","Mma fighter quinton 'rampage' jackson has spoken out for the first time after his son became embroiled in an incredible incident at a knokx pro wrestling event.

Shilo Sanders’ NFL dream with Buccaneers ends abruptly as team waives rookie after preseason drama

What’s next for Shilo Sanders in the NFL?



The Tampa Bay Buccaneers have officially parted ways with rookie safety Shilo Sanders after a turbulent preseason. Sanders, the elder son of Pro Football Hall of Famer Deion Sanders, saw his NFL journey hit a setback following an ejection in Saturday night’s matchup against the Buffalo Bills. The decision, though not surprising, underscores the fine margins undrafted rookies face when fighting for a spot in the league.Shilo Sanders’ chance to solidify his role ended abruptly when he got into a heated on-field altercation with Buffalo tight end Zach Davidson. The rookie was tossed from the game, drawing swift criticism from head coach Todd Bowles. “You can’t throw punches in this league. That’s inexcusable,” Bowles said firmly. “They’re going to get you every time. You’ve got to grow from that.”The ejection wasn’t the sole reason for the Buccaneers’ decision, but it proved to be the tipping point. According to ESPN’s Adam Schefter, “Buccaneers informed rookie safety Shilo Sanders today that he is being waived, per his agents Drew Rosenhaus and Robert Bailey.” For an undrafted free agent already facing an uphill battle, every snap mattered.Sanders struggled with pass coverage in limited preseason action, and the untimely incident further dented his chances.Meanwhile, some fans blamed the NFL for treating like this with Sanders family and brought the racism debate.At 25, Shilo Sanders carried both potential and pressure. Competing for a backup safety spot, he needed flawless execution and composure to earn trust from the coaching staff. Unfortunately, with Tampa Bay trimming its roster from 90 to 53 players, his margin for error was non-existent.Being waived doesn’t mark the end of Sanders’ career. By rule, he now enters waivers, where the other 31 NFL teams have a chance to claim him. If unclaimed, he’ll become a free agent, eligible to sign with any franchise. His most realistic path could be through a practice squad role. Teams often keep developmental players there, providing opportunities to grow and step up if injuries or trades create roster openings.For Shilo, this setback may serve as a crucial learning moment. The NFL is an unforgiving environment, particularly for undrafted rookies trying to prove their worth. Emotional maturity and discipline matter as much as athleticism. If Sanders can channel this experience into growth, his story in professional football may be far from over.Also Read: Why was Shilo Sanders ejected during Buccaneers’ preseason game against the Buffalo Bills","Tampa bay buccaneers have officially parted ways with rookie safety shilo sanders.

Potential destinations and Evgeni Malkin’s control over his future

The Pittsburgh Penguins are entering what could be a defining season for veteran star Evgeni Malkin. Reports suggest this may be Malkin’s final campaign with the team, as Pittsburgh navigates a major roster transition under President Kyle Dubas. While no official confirmation has come, insiders and media analysts alike are bracing for potential moves that could reshape the Penguins’ core.The team’s front office is actively trying to get faster and younger while maintaining some veteran presence. The attempted trade of Erik Karlsson, which has yet to materialize despite talks with the Carolina Hurricanes and Toronto Maple Leafs, highlights the complexity of Pittsburgh’s summer. Meanwhile, Malkin, entering the final season of his contract, is unlikely to sign an extension at 39. He recorded 50 points in 68 games last season, but the signs of age-related decline are becoming noticeable.“Even though it's not official, this is Evgeni Malkin's farewell tour,” reported Josh Yohe on the Athletic Hockey Show. The Penguins’ fans may soon witness the end of an era as one of the franchise’s greatest talents nears the twilight of his career.Malkin’s no-movement clause gives him substantial control over his next steps. Among the teams most linked to the superstar are the Vegas Golden Knights, Florida Panthers, and New York Rangers. With $6.1 million owed against the salary cap this season, the Penguins must consider both financial flexibility and competitive strategy.Also Read: NHL Trade Rumors: Vancouver Canucks push for middle-six center as trade market heats up Kyle Dubas praised Malkin’s career, calling him “the most underrated player maybe to ever play.” If Pittsburgh struggles early this season, trade speculation will intensify, and the Penguins may face difficult choices regarding their veteran core.

Connor McDavid focused on winning Stanley Cups before committing long-term

Connor McDavid’s future with the Edmonton Oilers is moving closer to a resolution, with NHL insider Elliotte Friedman hinting that contract extension talks could begin sooner than many anticipated. With one year left on his eight-year, $100 million deal, McDavid remains the most important player for Edmonton as they aim to build a team capable of ending their Stanley Cup drought.Elliotte Friedman suggested on the 32 Thoughts podcast that discussions could start between Canada’s 2026 Olympic orientation camp and the Oilers’ training camp. “Well, just at the start of the camp, I could see it,” Friedman said. “Look, I just think everybody wants to get it done. So I would expect [between] the Olympic camp and training camp, they sit down, they say, 'How’s this all going to look?’”Oilers general manager Stan Bowman has confirmed McDavid is a top priority, calling him “the best player in the League” and emphasizing that the team is ready to meet whenever McDavid is prepared. “Certainly we’re eager to meet with him whenever he wants. Timing-wise, Connor is going to drive that process,” Bowman stated.Despite the looming extension, McDavid’s main focus remains on winning. After another 100-point season and a deep playoff run that ended in a second consecutive loss to the Florida Panthers in the Stanley Cup Final, McDavid reiterated that team success is his priority. “Winning would be at the top of the list,” he said.“Winning is the most important thing.

Matthew Knies embracing higher expectations with Leafs and beyond



For Maple Leafs forward Matthew Knies, this summer has become about more than just preparation for the upcoming NHL season. Though he wasn’t chosen for Team USA’s roster at the 4-Nations Face-Off, Knies has another opportunity to showcase his talent. Later this month, he will skate alongside some of hockey’s biggest American stars at Team USA’s Olympic Selection Camp in Plymouth, aiming to earn a place at the 2026 Winter Olympics.Matthew Knies will join Auston Matthews, Patrick Kane, Jack Eichel, and Brady Tkachuk at the two-day event on August 26 and 27. For the 22-year-old winger, it represents more than just drills and scrimmages—it’s a chance to absorb wisdom from some of the league’s elite.“That is going to be a cool experience, just to meet a lot of those (Americans) to see what they do on and off the ice,” Knies shared. “Pick each other’s brains. Hopefully, I get a strong start to the season and make that team.”Already admired for his unique mix of size and skill—a combination that earned him the “unicorn” label—Knies has hinted at sharpening the more physical aspects of his game. His willingness to embrace the role of an agitator stems from influences like Tom Wilson, and spending time with Tkachuk could help him expand that edge.While the camp is a key milestone, Knies enters this season carrying significant expectations in Toronto. Fresh off a 29-goal, 58-point campaign, he begins the first year of a six-year contract extension signed in June. That deal places him firmly in the Maple Leafs’ long-term vision, but it also raises the bar for what he must deliver.Balancing the demands of the NHL and the opportunity to represent his country won’t be easy, yet Knies appears ready for the challenge.
