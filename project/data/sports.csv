Rishabh Pant's dismal Indian Premier League (IPL) season continued as the Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) captain scored a 17-ball 18 against Punjab Kings at the HPCA Stadium in Dharamsala on Sunday.LSG owner Sanjiv Goenka couldn’t hide his disappointment after Rishabh Pant’s failure and looked visibly upset.Pant stepped down the track, made room, and threw the kitchen sink at it, but by doing so, he lost his shape. The bat flew off his hand and landed near the square leg umpire, while the ball flew towards the deep point region, where Shashank Singh took a comfortable catch. Azmatullah Omarzai got the wicket for Punjab.Pant has endured a disappointing run with the bat, registering six single-digit scores for a total of 128 runs in 11 matches with a below-par strike rate of 99.22. His only noteworthy knock this season has been a 63 against Chennai Super Kings. Of the 70 batters who have faced at least 60 balls this season, only Pant has a sub-100 strike rate.Earlier, Punjab Kings produced a superlative batting display, led by Prabhsimran Singh, to post 236 for five against LSG in their crucial IPL match.Sent in to bat, Prabhsimran smashed a 48-ball 91 and shared a 78-run stand with skipper Shreyas Iyer (45) to lay the foundation before Nehal Wadhera (16), Shashank Singh (33), and Marcus Stoinis (15) chipped in to take PBKS to the imposing total.For LSG, Akash Maharaj Singh (2/30) and Digvesh Singh Rathi (2/46) took two wickets each, while Price Yadav (1/43) accounted for a wicket. Mayank Yadav, in fact, conceded 60 runs in his four overs, without taking a wicket.The LSG batting unit, which has performed well below par after the first stage of the tournament, will need to bat out of their skins to chase down the target. But at the end of 10 overs, LSG were reeling at 74 for 5.","Lsg owner sanjiv goneka can’t hide disappointment after rishabh pant fails again.

Punjab Kings climbed to second place on the IPL 2025 points table after their dominant 37-run win over Lucknow Super Giants at the HPCA Stadium in Dharamsala on Sunday. This victory marked PBKS’ seventh win of the season from 11 matches, taking their points tally to 15.

While Punjab Kings also have only three defeats, their NRR of +0.376 places them narrowly below RCB.Mumbai Indians, with 7 wins and 4 losses from 11 matches, are third with 14 points, but their impressive NRR of +1.274 — the best among all teams — gives them a strong edge if points get tied later in the tournament.Gujarat Titans follow closely in fourth with 14 points from 10 games, thanks to their consistent form and a solid NRR of +0.867.Delhi Capitals are holding the fifth spot with 12 points from 10 matches and remain in the hunt for a top-four finish.Kolkata Knight Riders, with 11 points from 11 matches, are still in the playoff race but need a strong finish.Lucknow Super Giants’ defeat to PBKS hurt their playoff chances, leaving them on 10 points from 11 games and a negative NRR of -0.469, which could be crucial in a tight finish.Rajasthan Royals and Chennai Super Kings have been eliminated from playoff contention. RR have just 3 wins from 12 matches, while CSK, surprisingly, sit at the bottom with only 2 wins from 11 games and a poor NRR of -1.117.Sunrisers Hyderabad are also struggling with 3 wins from 10 games and an NRR of -1.192, making their path to the playoffs extremely difficult.",Punjab kings climb to second place on the ipl 2025 points table.

In-form opener Prabhsimran Singh continued his splendid form with another match-winning 91 runs as Punjab Kings (PBKS) defeated Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) by 37 runs at the HPCA Stadium in Dharamsala on Sunday.Prabhsimran Singh's explosive 91, studded with six fours and seven sixes, set the stage for a high-scoring affair. It was Prabhsimran's third consecutive fifty. Shashank Singh's late cameo of 33 off 15 balls further bolstered Punjab's total to 236 for 5.If Prabhsimran shone with the bat, then left-arm seamer Arshdeep Singh picked up three wickets in the powerplay to put Punjab on top. Arshdeep, in his opening bursts, removed Mitchell Marsh, Aiden Markram, and Nicholas Pooran to knock Lucknow out of playoff contention.Chasing 237, LSG managed 199/7. For LSG, Ayush Badoni was the lone ranger, scoring 74 off 40 balls.Earlier, Prabhsimran's impressive innings came to an end when he attempted an ambitious switch hit off Digvesh Rathi, falling nine runs short of what would have been his second IPL century.The match began with LSG making an early breakthrough when Priyansh Arya was dismissed for 1 run, caught by Mayank Yadav at deep backward point off Akash Singh's bowling.Josh Inglis initiated the Punjab Kings' assault with three consecutive sixes against Mayank Yadav, whose bowling speed has reportedly decreased by approximately 15 kmph following his rehabilitation at the BCCI's National Cricket Academy.After Inglis's departure, Prabhsimran partnered with captain Shreyas Iyer, who scored 45 off 25 balls, to take control of the innings. Their partnership was aided by poor fielding from Avesh Khan.Prabhsimran particularly targeted Avesh Khan, hitting him for consecutive sixes over mid-wicket. Khan's figures were disappointing, conceding 57 runs in four overs, with additional runs leaked through misfielding.The partnership between Prabhsimran and Iyer yielded 78 runs in 7.5 overs before Rathi became the first spinner this season to dismiss the Punjab Kings captain.LSG's bowlers struggled throughout the innings, consistently bowling to Prabhsimran's strengths and allowing him to capitalize on scoring opportunities.","Prabhsimran singh's explosive 91, studded with six fours and seven sixes, set the stage for a high-scoring affair.

Punjab Kings (PBKS) co-owner Preity Zinta was left stunned after Shashank Singh smacked Mayank Yadav for a six that sailed outside the HPCA Stadium on Sunday.On the fourth ball of the 17th over, bowled by Mayank Yadav, Shashank Singh sent the ball over deep backward square-leg, hitting the roof of a building and going over.The shot elicited an epic reaction from Preity Zinta, who could be seen shouting ""oooohhhhhhhhhhh!""The umpire had to ask for a new ball as the ball landed outside the stadium.Prabhsimran Singh's 91 off 48 powers Punjab Kings to 236/5.Earlier, LSG skipper Rishabh Pant won the toss and opted to field first. At the toss, Pant said the ball might stop a bit early on, which is why he chose to bowl first.“We feel it is a bowling-first pitch. We don't know how it is going to play. Looks like it will stop a bit, a little loose on the top. Still, a good wicket. It is going to be a good match. Bowling first, we will have the advantage and see how the game unfolds, and that's the kind of advantage we were looking to have. Just trying to be simple more often. You want people to have a conversation when you are losing. Good to see youngsters stepping in,” he said.PBKS captain Shreyas Iyer said they had made one change – seam-bowling all-rounder Marcus Stoinis comes into the playing eleven. “We would have bowled first as well. The wicket was covered for a while, and it was pouring yesterday and the day before. It was under the sheets, and you know the moisture it adopts. The grass is thicker.”“I don't want to predict how the wicket is going to be. We are up for the competition. You've got to take positives from the game. You can't dwell on how bad you have done in a particular game. It haunts you every now and then.”“We need to be in high spirits and keep motivating each other and see to it that we are enjoying each other's success. That's the culture and camaraderie in the team. Just keeping things simple. I know it is tough, but that's the mantra,” he said.PBKS are fourth on the points table with six wins from 10 games and are very much in the reckoning to enter the playoffs.

Teammate Gary Payton II is also available despite dealing with a left thumb splint.The Warriors, who once led the series 3-1, now face immense pressure to avoid a historic collapse reminiscent of their 2016 Finals loss.

NEW DELHI: Rinku Singh delivered a match-defining fielding performance as Kolkata Knight Riders edged Rajasthan Royals by just one run in a dramatic finish at Eden Gardens on Sunday, keeping their IPL 2025 playoff hopes alive.With Royals needing three runs off the final ball, Shubham Dubey hit the ball to long-off and called for two. But Rinku, patrolling the boundary, sprinted in, picked up cleanly, and fired a one-bounce throw to Vaibhav Arora, who calmly removed the bails to catch a diving Jofra Archer short of his crease. It sealed a one-run win and triggered wild celebrations from the KKR camp.Rinku’s outfield brilliance had earlier saved a boundary in the 19th over with a full-length dive — an effort that proved decisive in the context of a high-scoring thriller.""It was important to save that (18.2) boundary.

NEW DELHI: Just days after setting the cricket world ablaze with a breathtaking century, 14-year-old Rajasthan Royals prodigy Vaibhav Suryavanshi is now experiencing a dry patch with the bat. The young sensation from Samastipur, Bihar — who smashed 11 sixes in a whirlwind knock at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium in Jaipur to become an overnight star — has since struggled to replicate that form. After being dismissed for a duck against Mumbai Indians , he managed just 4 runs against Kolkata Knight Riders .Suryavanshi began promisingly, opening his account with a stylish cover-driven boundary. However, his stay was short-lived. On the very next delivery, Vaibhav Arora bowled a short ball that Suryavanshi attempted to pull, only to miscue it towards mid-wicket. Ajinkya Rahane ran in and took a brilliant catch to send the teenager back to the pavilion.Notably, Suryavanshi’s stunning century came against a bowling attack comprising veterans like Ishant Sharma, Mohammed Siraj, Prasidh Krishna, Washington Sundar, Rashid Khan, and Karim Janat — making his achievement even more impressive. It was also the second-fastest century in the tournament’s history.Rajasthan Royals bowling coach Shane Bond recently revealed that the team management is being cautious with the teenage talent.“The coaching staff haven’t tried to complicate things too much with Vaibhav. He’s sort of got a bit of a license to go out and just play, which he’s done an amazing job so far, really, for a 14-year-old. So look again, he missed out in the last game, but for us, you don’t really want to panic with someone so young, you just come out and plug in tomorrow,"" Bond said at the pre-match press conference.“I know Vikram (Rathour) talks about his game plans and the type of bowlers that he’s going to come up against and he’ll do that again for this match, but outside of that, he’s a pretty young kid, so I’m just happy for him to get out there and keep swinging. It’ll be that again,"" he added.Bond emphasised the importance of patience when nurturing a player so young.“He’s (Vaibhav) obviously a seriously talented player, but he’s also still a kid. So, he’s sort of learning on the go, we’re going to be really patient with him because you have to be. And the other part of it is just all the off-field stuff, the travel (and such), you can’t expect a 14-year-old to be a professional. Like I’ve got a 16-year-old son and he’s a teenager, so we’re just trying to educate him on the things around and look after him, shield him a little bit from the social media stuff and all the trappings that come with the way he started, but he’s a lovely kid,"" Bond said.","14-year-old vaibhav suryavanshi is experiencing a dry patch with the bat.

Mikko Rantanen’s Game 7 heroics for Dallas leave Colorado fans branding him a 'traitor’

Mikko Rantanen ’s return to Colorado as a playoff opponent couldn’t have been more dramatic—or divisive. In a high-stakes Game 7 showdown, the former Avalanche star scored a hat trick and notched four points to lead the Dallas Stars to a 4-2 comeback win, knocking his old team out of the Stanley Cup Playoffs . While Rantanen delivered a clutch performance on the ice, the emotional aftermath has left Avalanche fans anything but forgiving.The Finnish winger, once beloved in Denver, was dealt to Carolina briefly before landing in Dallas. His departure was controversial, sparked by failed contract negotiations with the Avs. Though Rantanen claimed he wanted to stay—“At the end of the day, I always wanted to stay in Colorado”—many fans believe his decision to leave was driven by financial ambition. “Cheap ass. Could have stayed in Denver on the same contract. Douche,” one fan wrote, highlighting the growing resentment.Despite the venom, Rantanen’s performance was nothing short of spectacular. After trailing 2-0 in the third, Dallas stormed back with Rantanen leading the charge. His Game 7 heroics capped off a dominant series in which he recorded 12 points—including back-to-back four-point games in Games 6 and 7.Still, even his post-game comments acknowledging his emotional connection to his former team couldn’t salvage goodwill. “They’re my brothers.

Gujarat Titans aim to recover from the blow dealt by young sensation Vaibhav Suryavanshi when they face a struggling Sunrisers Hyderabad in an IPL match tonight (May 2).Suryavanshi stunned GT with his incredible performance, hitting the season’s fastest century in just 35 balls and becoming the youngest IPL centurion at only 14 years and 32 days old.Despite an eight-wicket loss — post a strong 209/4 score — the result hasn't altered GT's position in the league. The Titans remain one of the most consistent teams this season, boasting a balanced squad with strengths in both batting and bowling.Led by Shubman Gill, they sit comfortably with six wins out of nine matches (12 points). Just two more wins from their last five fixtures would secure a spot in the playoffs, reaching the 16-point threshold.GT's in-form top order gives them confidence, especially with standout Sai Sudharsan, who is second in the Orange Cap race with 456 runs and five fifties. Gill (389 runs) and Jos Buttler (406 runs) also rank among the season’s top batters, making a formidable trio despite recent challenges.Earlier this season, GT defeated SRH convincingly in Hyderabad by seven wickets, thanks largely to Mohammed Siraj's impressive 4/17 spell. They’ll be hoping for a similar performance this time.Meanwhile, SRH find themselves in a critical position, needing wins urgently. The runners-up last season have struggled — just three wins in nine matches — and sit ninth on the points table. Another loss could effectively eliminate their playoff hopes.While SRH have seen flashes of brilliance from openers Abhishek Sharma and Travis Head, consistency remains elusive for the team.The pitch at Narendra Modi Stadium favours the batters, which should benefit SRH. In five of the eight matches played at Motera, teams have scored over 200 runs, highlighting the batting-friendly conditions. Bowlers are likely to struggle, particularly in the second innings, as dew is expected to make an impact.Shubman Gill (C), Sai Sudharsan, Jos Buttler (WK), Sherfane Rutherford, Shahrukh Khan, Washington Sundar, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, Sai Kishore, Mohammed Siraj, Prasidh KrishnaImpact sub: Karim Janat/Ishant SharmaTravis Head, Abhishek Sharma, Ishan Kishan, Nitish Kumar Reddy, Heinrich Klaasen (WK), Aniket Verma, Kamindu Mendis, Pat Cummins (C), Harshal Patel, Simarjeet Singh, Zeeshan AnsariImpact sub: Mohammed ShamiGujarat Titans squad : Shubman Gill (Captain), Jos Buttler (wk), B Sai Sudharsan, Shahrukh Khan, Sherfane Rutherford, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, Kagiso Rabada, Ravisrinivasan Sai Kishore, Mohammad Siraj, Prasidh Krishna, Ishant Sharma, Washington Sundar, Glenn Phillips, Anuj Rawat, Mahipal Lomror, Arshad Khan, Jayant Yadav, Nishant Sindhu, Kulwant Khejroliya, Gerald Coetzee, Manav Suthar, Kumar Kushagra, Gurnoor Brar and Karim Janat.Sunrisers Hyderabad squad : Pat Cummins (c), Ishan Kishan (wk), Atharva Taide, Abhinav Manohar, Aniket Verma, Sachin Baby, Smaran Ravichandran, Heinrich Klaasen (wk), Travis Head, Harshal Patel, Kamindu Mendis, Wiaan Mulder, Abhishek Sharma, Nitish Kumar Reddy, Mohammed Shami, Rahul Chahar, Simarjeet Singh, Zeeshan Ansari, Jaydev Unadkat, Eshan Malinga.In Ahmedabad on Friday, temperatures are expected to be quite hot, reaching up to 44°C during the day.

'VIRAT'S SUPPORT IS HUGE FOR YASH'

Poll Do you think Yash Dayal's performance has improved since joining RCB? No, it has worsened No, it has remained the same Yes, slightly Yes, significantly

NEW DELHI: It must have been déjà vu for Yash Dayal when he was handed the final over by skipper Rajat Patidar on Saturday. It was the same scenario he faced in IPL 2024: same team ( RCB ), same opponent ( CSK ), same venue (M. Chinnaswamy Stadium ), and the same batter on strike ( MS Dhoni ).In 2024, Dayal had to defend 17 runs; this time, it was 15. Back then, despite being hit for a massive six off the first ball by Dhoni, Dayal held his nerve, pulling things back and leading RCB to a thrilling win that secured their playoff spot while sending CSK packing.Go Beyond The Boundary with our YouTube channel. SUBSCRIBE NOW! On Sunday, Dayal once again found himself entrusted with the crucial task by his captain, with the legendary Dhoni on strike. The atmosphere in the stadium was tense, but Dayal remained ice-cold.The final over was a spectacle of nerves and drama. CSK needed 15 runs to salvage some pride in what had been a dreadful campaign. Dayal gave away a single to Dhoni on the first ball and another single to Jadeja on the second. Then came the turning point: on the third ball, Dayal dismissed Dhoni and shifted the momentum in RCB’s favour.Also See: IPL Live Score KKR vs RR Shivam Dube entered with CSK needing 13 from 3 balls.Then, chaos. A waist-high no-ball gave Dube a free hit, which he smashed for six. The equation suddenly changed — 6 needed off 3 balls.With just six required from three, Dayal kept his composure. He bowled a single to Dube on the fourth ball, and Jadeja couldn’t make an impact on the penultimate ball, also taking a single.Now, it was down to 4 runs needed from the final ball. Dayal exchanged a brief word with Patidar. The tension was palpable, but Dayal calmly took his run-up and delivered a low full-toss. Dube connected hard, sending the ball to long-on, but only managed two runs.RCB dugout, players on the field and thousands in the stands erupted. Not only did the win lift them to the top of the points table, but it also marked another clutch finish from Dayal — his calmness under pressure proving decisive once more.A unique stat: In both the 2024 and 2025 instances, Dayal dismissed Dhoni.Despite the no ball and the six, another person who remained cool under pressure was his father, Chanderpal Dayal, watching from Allahabad. At no point did he doubt the outcome, knowing full that Yash would pull through.""It’s never over till the last ball is bowled in cricket. Yash is more mature now. I’m sure even the fans had given up — my family did too. But I was confident that Yash would pull it off. And he did. His calmness was the key in this match,"" Yash Dayal's father told TimesofIndia.com in an exclusive interview.""I was watching the 2024 match — he was in the same situation, and Dhoni was there too. When Patidar handed him the last over this time, I was literally smiling. The skipper knows Yash well. The management has shown a lot of trust in him. Virat has supported him immensely since he joined RCB. He’s the reason Yash is performing so freely, without any baggage on his shoulders""Virat hamesha bolte hain usko darr ke nahi, bindas khel, khul ke khel [Virat always tells him to not play with fear, but to play freely and with confidence],"" the father said.Dayal has burried the 2023 nightmare a long back. While playing for Gujarat Titans, Dayal had to defend 29 off the final over against Kolkata Knight Riders. KKR's hard-hitting batter Rinku Singh hit five consecutive sixes off Yash Dayal to give his team a dramatic victory.Dayal became the butt of jokes on social media. He was released by Gujarat Titans ahead of IPL 2024 Auction. But, RCB showed faith in him and bought him for Rs 5 crore. He was also retained by RCB prior to the 2025 season.“I would like to thank RCB for showing faith in me and for retaining me. I couldn’t have asked for a better team to play for. RCB believed in me even in my lowest moments. That is very special for me,” said Dayal on social media ahead of the season.Dayal's father Chandrapal revealed how Kohli helped Dayal in tough times.""He always said 'Papa bhul jao uss episode ko, mai yaad nahi karna chahta. Bahot aage jana hai [Papa, forget that episode. I don't want to remember it. Have to go a long way]'. He was never down, even after getting hit by Rinku Singh. I am really thankful to RCB for showing trust in him and supporting him,"" the father said. Virat Kohli has supported him a lot. When Yash joined RCB, Virat would often call him to his room — and sometimes, he would go to Yash’s room himself. They discussed that over [from 2024], and Virat told him one thing: ‘Keep working hard, toofan macha de. Main hoon tere saath. Chinta mat karna. Mehnat karna mat chhodna. Galtiyan karna, par seekhna aur aage badhna.’ (Keep working hard, create a storm. I’m with you. Don’t worry. Never stop putting in the effort. Make mistakes, but learn and move forward). Virat has given him a lot of freedom and turned him into a fearless cricketer,"" the father said.""Maine kaafi cricketers ko tootate hue dekhe hai, espcially bowlers ko par Virat ne apne haath se joda hai [I have seen many cricketers break down, especially bowlers, but Virat has connected them with his own hands],"" Chandrapal signed off.","Royal challengers bengaluru's yash dayal was handed the final over by rajat patidar.

Shah Rukh Khan: The superstar who turned IPL into a blockbuster

Sachin Tendulkar at 52: Power, Pride, and a Nation’s Pulse

NEW DELHI: There was a wave of excitement and anticipation after Punjab Kings (PBKS) announced their lineup for the opening IPL 2021 clash against Rajasthan Royals (RR). West Indian superstar Chris Gayle and his big-hitting countryman Nicholas Pooran were set to feature together, sparking discussions on how many sixes the duo might smash. However, the scenario turned out to be quite an anticlimax, as former South African cricketer Chris Morris dismissed Pooran for a golden duck. The 29-year-old's fortunes further worsened from that point, as he managed to score just 28 runs in seven matches, recording four ducks. Pooran, who had entered IPL 2021 with the reputation of someone who smashes sixes for fun, managed to hit just one six during that period.The wicketkeeper-batter failed to turn things around in the remaining matches, ending IPL 2021 with 85 runs in 12 outings. Pooran smashed just five sixes throughout the campaign, recording a strike rate of 111.84 and an average of 7.72. PBKS opted to release the West Indian cricketer at the end of the season, raising questions about his future in the IPL.However, the 29-year-old has pulled off a sensational comeback—one that very few can boast of—emerging as a genuine game-changer. Pooran currently leads the tally for most sixes in IPL 2025 , smashing 34 in 10 matches. MI batter Suryakumar Yadav is second on the list with 26 sixes in 11 games. Pooran has been the top run-getter for Lucknow Super Giants (LSG), amassing 404 runs at a strike rate of 203.01.Ex-West Indies cricketer Adrian Barath, the youngest player from his country to score a Test century, even stated that it's very possible for Pooran to become the first cricketer to score 250 in a T20 match.""Pooran can achieve anything he wants across every format. He is capable and has great strength and hunger to excel as much as possible. Pooran is also exceptionally hard-working and keeps grinding it out in the nets throughout the day till he has perfected his strokes,"" said Barath in an exclusive interaction with TimesofIndia.com.""Talent alone gets you nowhere. He has found that sweet spot with regard to mixing talent and hard work, which we've witnessed in the case of top players like Sachin Tendulkar and Brian Lara. At the same time, he also has a very strong base. Pooran's legs are very powerful, like a horse. His head stays still, which helps him connect well. In short, he has all the ingredients for six-hitting. The first time I saw Pooran was when he was 14 years old. I was impressed with the way he fielded with great intent, throwing his body around. I knew he was destined for success as a cricketer that very moment,"" he added.One of the major factors behind Pooran's transformation after the IPL 2021 debacle has been the support of West Indian cricketers Kieron Pollard and Sunil Narine , with whom he shares a close bond.""Pollard and Narine have backed him through thick and thin. I am very sure that they would have had discussions with Pooran following the conclusion of IPL 2021. Pollard and Narine have constantly guided, motivated, and helped him improve his game and take it to the next level,"" said Pooran's former coach David Furlonge.""Pooran also has a great deal of respect for them. I remember a match where all the Trinidadian as well as West Indian cricketers were in contention for selection. I went to Pollard and told him to drop somebody in this tricky situation. He called Pooran and said, 'Go and run three laps. You're not playing today.' Pooran simply said okay rather than creating a fuss,"" he added.Another significant reason behind Pooran's dominance, especially in IPL 2025, is the decision to promote him to the number three position. The West Indian cricketer has thrived in the role, making the most of the freedom the slot provides.""Pooran is best suited to bat at number three. Whosoever took the call to send him to that position deserves an award. It has changed his batting style. Pooran is now more responsible. When you go in to bat at number five, six, or seven, it doesn't help you develop as a batter,"" said former Cricket West Indies (CWI) director Baldath Mahabir, whose academy Pooran trained at during his early years.""Pooran has a great amount of confidence, and giving him a limited number of balls to face deprives him of the opportunity to express himself. I recollect an interaction between him and his first coach Dashrath Maharaj, who asked Pooran to hit the ball only if it falls in his zone. He simply replied, 'Coach, I have plenty of zones.' That is an indication of his confidence levels,"" added Mahabir.""Pollard and I would always discuss that Pooran should be batting at number three, especially in T20s. We used to try and send him up the order at number three or four to give him quality time in the middle,"" shared Furlonge.Former PBKS batting consultant and power-hitting coach Julian Wood termed the clarity Pooran has received regarding his batting position—and his consistent run at number three—as a tactically brilliant move.""He now has clarity with regard to his role after being played at every slot from number one to seven previously. With clarity comes confidence and trust in your technique, enabling Pooran to simply focus on hitting the ball in the best possible manner. Confidence plays a massive role in cricket. Pooran has also simplified his process and worked it all out with regard to rhythm and timing, resulting in his consistency going through the roof. He is a pure striker of the ball, just like Sachin and Virat Kohli,"" stated Wood.Pooran has been praised for his determination and dedication, often pulling off match-winning performances in difficult situations. However, no on-field challenge compares to the near-fatal road accident he survived in 2015.""I was in so much pain. I just wanted them to knock me out,"" Pooran had once shared while discussing the collision.Doctors were uncertain if he would ever play again, even suggesting that walking might be difficult. But Pooran defied the odds.""I visited him in the hospital. He was always very confident. I feared that he wouldn't be that strong following the accident and was also worried about the weight he had put on. He lost it easily and overcame all the physical and mental challenges—just like Rishabh Pant,"" said Mahabir.While most players would ease back into the game after such trauma, Pooran returned hungrier than ever—with Furlonge playing a key role in his comeback.""Pooran came back with purpose and complete focus, becoming even stronger despite the accident. Pollard, Narine, and Dwayne Bravo helped him by pushing him to achieve his goals. Coming back from an injury like that shows the character Pooran has,"" said Furlonge.""He always made himself available for practice and worked on his fitness extensively. Pollard and Narine used to approach me to let Pooran play—they knew his talent and wanted him to make full use of it. Pooran had his own personal trainer who guided him with a fitness programme that he followed religiously,"" he added.Though widely popular on social media for his humorous reactions, Pooran is fiercely competitive and brutally honest when expectations aren’t met.""Pooran's team lost the final of a tournament where he had helped the team sail through every stage, carrying them on his shoulders. He didn’t score in the final because he was mentally tired. Pooran wasn’t happy with his teammates’ performance and expressed his frustration in an outburst. He is extremely competitive and wants to win at any cost,"" said Furlonge.""No match is over till Pooran is at the crease. He once walked out to bat when his team was down and out with 200 runs needed. We won the match very comfortably in the end. Pooran is highly impactful—just like Chris Gayle—but more of a 360-degree player than him,"" he added.","Nicholas pooran is the top run-getter for lucknow super giants (lsg) the 29-year-old smashed 34 sixes in ipl 2025, with suryakumar yadav second on the list.

NEW DELHI: Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) won the toss and elected to bowl first against Punjab Kings (PBKS) in Match 54 of IPL 2025 , being played at the HPCA Stadium in Dharamsala on Sunday. This marks PBKS’ first home game at their second venue of the season, having played four previous matches in New Chandigarh.PBKS currently sit fourth on the points table with six wins from 10 matches and remain firmly in the playoff race. LSG, returning to action after a week-long break, are placed sixth with five victories from 11 games. A win today is crucial for them to stay in the hunt for a playoff spot.After calling correctly at the toss, LSG captain Rishabh Pant explained his decision to bowl first, citing possible early assistance for bowlers. ""We feel it's a bowling-first pitch. Not sure how it's going to behave, but it looks like the ball might stop a bit. It's slightly loose on the surface, though still a good wicket. Bowling first gives us an edge,” Pant said.With conditions having been wet over the past two days, LSG handed a debut cap to left-arm pacer Akash Singh and named leg-spinner Ravi Bishnoi among their impact substitutes, indicating a preference for seam in the early stages.On the other hand, PBKS skipper Shreyas Iyer revealed one change in the playing XI, with seam-bowling all-rounder Marcus Stoinis included. “We would’ve bowled first too. The wicket has been under covers due to rain over the last two days, and there's some moisture beneath. The grass is a bit thick,” Iyer said.The PBKS captain emphasised the importance of staying positive. “We’re up for the challenge. You can’t dwell on poor performances; they tend to haunt you. It's about maintaining high spirits, motivating one another, and enjoying each other’s success. That’s the culture we’ve built.”Born on April 26, 2002, in the quiet village of Nagla Ram Ratan in Bharatpur, Rajasthan, Akash Singh's journey to professional cricket is a testament to grit and raw talent. Hailing from a modest family—his father a farmer and his mother a homemaker—Akash took his first significant step towards a cricketing career at the Shardul Sports School in Bikaner.His potential quickly became evident, earning him a place at the prestigious MRF Pace Foundation, where he trained under the watchful eyes of legends like Glenn McGrath. The stint refined his control, rhythm, and swing—qualities that would shape his identity as a new-ball bowler.Akash made his domestic T20 debut for Rajasthan in the 2019 Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, making an immediate impact with a two-wicket haul. His impressive performances led to selections for India’s Under-19 squads in both the 2019 ACC Asia Cup and the 2020 ICC U19 World Cup. In the latter, he emerged as India’s strike weapon with the new ball, finishing with 11 wickets in six matches and playing a vital role in guiding the team to the final.His domestic career has seen him don the jerseys of Rajasthan, Nagaland, and Baroda—demonstrating his adaptability and hunger for opportunities. In red-ball cricket, especially in the Ranji Trophy, Akash has impressed with his ability to generate movement off the seam and dismiss top-order batters, including notable performances against powerhouse teams like Mumbai.The IPL journey began when Rajasthan Royals picked him in the 2020 auction, though he had limited exposure initially. He made his IPL debut in 2021 and later caught attention during his stint with Chennai Super Kings in 2023, where he played four matches, took five wickets, and showcased his sharp pace and deceptive angle. Mentorship under MS Dhoni proved to be a pivotal experience in his development.In 2024, Akash was roped in by Sunrisers Hyderabad, although he didn’t feature in a game that season.Known for his natural ability to swing the ball and hit the deck with intent, Akash Singh remains one of the most promising left-arm seamers in India’s fast-bowling pipeline—a young pacer with the tools to shine across formats and conditions.","Lucknow super giants (lsg) won the toss and elected to bowl first against punjab kings (pbks) in match 54 of ipl 2025, being played at the hpca stadium in dharamsala on sunday.

Nikola Jokic led the Denver Nuggets to a 120-101 win over the Los Angeles Clippers in Game 7 of the first round of the NBA playoffs , but it wasn’t exactly his performance on the court that made headlines hours later. The Denver Nuggets center drew attention for greeting teammate DeAndre Jordan , who was sitting in the stands, with 3 kisses, which he called “a Serbian thing.”Nikola Jokic’s 3-kiss gesture was enough for the TNT brigade to grill The Joker. TNT host Charles Barkley asked Jokic after the game, “Is that the ugliest person you’ve ever kissed in your life?” Jokic took some time to process the question and responded, “No… Actually. Hmm.” The pause in itself was enough to add to the kissing topic and left his fans laughing over it on social media.The incident went on to become a topic of discussion on Reddit as fans had their own reactions to Nikola Jokic’s explanation: “Yes, it's a Serbian thing, he wants to be a Serbian, so... I gotta let him have a little peace.""Reacting to it, a Reddit user wrote, “The facial expression after the pause was money. Prime comedic timing.” Commenting on the 3-kiss greeting, another said, “Might actually be the cutest thing I’ve ever seen on the court.” Sharing a suggestion on Jokic’s hilarious response, a fan wrote, “Leave it alone, Jokic! Your family is watching you! Hahaha.” “Goddamn, this is funny, lol,” wrote another. A comment also read: “Are the Inside Guys just now noticing this? Those guys have done the greeting kiss for years...”After their win over the Los Angeles Clippers, the Denver Nuggets move to the second round to play against the Oklahoma City Thunder, which are the number 1 seed in the West. After the win over the Clippers, Jokic told the media, “In the playoffs, we know that everybody needs to step up — offensively, defensively, whatever, energy-wise. And everybody who plays needs to contribute something. It was special today; the guys did that.”Also Read: What is Nikola Jokic's ethnicity?

Example: ""dear"" and ""deer"" tend to be linked by sound, not by some elaborate relationship such as predator and prey.

You have only four guesses per puzzle per day, so every guess matters.

Don't mindlessly click—consider each set carefully before submitting.

Try to come up with at least three connected words confidently before trying a set.
