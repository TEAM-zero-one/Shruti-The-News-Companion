As India prepare to face Pakistan in the Asia Cup 2025 match at Dubai International Cricket Stadium on September 14, controversy surrounds the fixture. While some oppose India playing against Pakistan due to terrorism concerns, IPL team Punjab Kings took a unique stance by not mentioning Pakistan in their match announcement on social media. A plea for urgent hearing into cancellation of the match was also denied by the Supreme Court.The Punjab Kings' social media post about India's upcoming match deliberately avoided naming Pakistan as the opponent. This move sparked such intense reactions that the franchise had to disable comments on their X social media channel.The Supreme Court petition highlighted serious concerns about India-Pakistan cricket relations. The petitioners argued that playing cricket with Pakistan sends the wrong message, especially after recent terror attacks like Phalangam and Operation Sindoor where Indian soldiers lost their lives.The plea specifically stated: ""Cricket between nations is meant to show harmony and friendship. But after the Phalagam terror attack and Operation Sindoor, when our people died and our soldiers risked everything, playing with Pakistan sent the opposite message that while our soldiers sacrificed their lives, we are celebrating sports with the same country sheltering terrorists.""The petitioners expressed worry about hurting the sentiments of terror victims' families.They emphasised that national dignity and citizen security should take priority over entertainment. The petition claimed that such cricket matches could negatively impact the morale of armed forces and the nation.India-Pakistan cricket matches traditionally generate massive interest, not just for the sporting rivalry but also due to the complex political relationship between the two nations. The upcoming Dubai clash continues to spark debate about sports and politics in the sub-continent.India and Pakistan have both started their Asia Cup campaigns with wins. Both the sub-continent giants registered commanding wins, against UAE and Oman, respectively. The two rivals could meet as many as three times over the course of the Asia Cup.",India face pakistan in the asia cup 2025 match at dubai international cricket stadium on september 14.

NEW DELHI: The upcoming India vs Pakistan clash in the Asia Cup 2025 is sparking political fireworks almost as fiercely as it promises to on the cricket field. Ahead of the high-stakes match, Shiv Sena (UBT) and Congress leaders have raised strong objections, labelling the fixture “shameless” and profit-driven, while BJP and allied state leaders have thrown their weight behind the Indian team, calling it a matter of national pride and ""compulsion to multilateral matches.""The criticism stems from India’s recent anti-terror operations against terrorists in Pakistan under Operation Sindoor, which the government said has been put on pause.The already-strained India-Pakistan relations dropped several notches lower after the deadly terrorist attack in Pahalgam's Baisaran meadow that claimed 26 civilian lives. In retaliation, India launched cross-border strikes deep inside Pakistan and PoJK, targeting terror hotbeds in Pakistan's Bahawalpur and Muridke.Shiv Sena UBT chief Uddhav Thackeray questioned the morality of holding the match, saying, ""... Our Prime Minister said blood and water cannot flow together, then how can blood and cricket flow together. How can war and cricket be at the same time?... They have done business in patriotism. The business of patriotism is only for money. They are going to play the match tomorrow also because they want all the money they will get from that match...Tomorrow, Shiv Sena (UBT) women workers will come out on the streets in Maharashtra and they are going to send sindoor from every house to PM Modi. ..""Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Sanjay Raut also criticised the decision, stating, ""...We will protest against this India-Pakistan cricket match. Women will come on the streets and our campaign is 'Sindoor Raksha Abhiyan'...You said that water and blood will not flow together. If water and blood will not flow together, then how will blood and cricket work together?...This is treason, shamelessness.""Raut further referred to ongoing grievances from past events, saying, ""Operation Sindoor has not ended yet, it is still going on. The sindoor of our 26 women was wiped off in Pahalgam. Their pain, grief, and anger have not ended. Even today, they are in shock. And you people are going to play cricket with Pakistan in Abu Dhabi. This is shamelessness, this is treason. My question is to the BJP, not to the government. My question is to the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, RSS, Bajrang Dal. Do you have any role in this or not?...""BJP MP and former BCCI president Anurag Thakur explained, “In a multilateral tournament organised by the ACC or ICC, we have to play as it is compulsory for all countries. If we do not take part, we will be eliminated from the tournament as the opposition will get the points. But we do not play bilateral tournaments with Pakistan, and we will not play with them until they stop hurting us with the terrorism that flourishes there. ”Maharashtra minister Nitesh Rane took a dig at Shiv Sena MLA Aaditya Thackeray, mocking him for planning to attend the match, saying, ""Aaditya Thackeray will go silently to attend the match (upcoming India vs Pakistan match in Asia Cup 2025), wearing a burqa. His voice will also help him in this. After wearing a burqa, if he speaks in a woman's voice, people will believe him... No one would recognise that he is Aaditya Thackeray. ..""Rane also criticised Uddhav Thackeray, asking, ""Does Saamana or Uddhav Thackeray have the moral right to comment on the India-Pakistan match? During a rally of one of Uddhav Thackeray's MPs, slogans of 'Pakistan Zindabad' were raised, green flags were waved, green gulal was thrown, and slogans like 'sar tan se juda' were chanted. So, why didn't they express anger towards Pakistan then?""Congress MP Imraan Masood joined the criticism, framing the match as profit-driven: ""This is a business... The rights to broadcast it are sold at very high prices... They don't care about the fact that it's only been a few days since our sisters' 'sindoor' has been wiped off... This is not the first time; earlier, we did not send our hockey team either. They should not try to tell the rules... Those who wiped the 'sindoor' of our sisters, and you are going to play a match with them. You should be ashamed, and the government should also be ashamed that they do not have enough morality left in them that earlier they were saying that blood and water will not flow together, and now you are making them play cricket together.""In contrast, Haryana Sports minister Gaurav Gautam wished the Indian team success, saying, ""India has given a befitting reply to Pakistan on every front. I think India will emerge victorious here as well. Best wishes to our Indian players.""","The upcoming india vs pakistan clash in the asia cup 2025 is sparking political fireworks almost as fiercely as it promises to on the cricket field.

He was on a family trip to Kashmir with his wife and 11 relatives. The group was scheduled to return to Kanpur on Apr 23.On Saturday, the family said that playing against Pakistan is an insult to those who lost their lives in the attack.

""The Indian Cricket Control Board has forgotten my husband's sacrifice in just a few months,"" she added.She further said that the BCCI should not have accepted playing a match with Pakistan. ""The BCCI seems to lack empathy for the 26 families and the soldiers who were martyred during Operation Sindoor; these things don't seem to matter to the BCCI. Perhaps it's because no one from their own families was affected. Another thing is, where are our cricketers? It's often said that cricketers have a sense of nationality, which is why cricket is considered almost like a national game in our country, even though our official national game is hockey,"" she said.""However, except for one or two cricketers, no one has come forward to say that we shouldn't play against Pakistan.

SRINAGAR: Ahead of India-Pakistan cricket match in the Asia Cup, Jammu and Kashmir Students Association (JKSA) on Saturday issued an advisory to Kashmiri students across the country to refrain from making social media posts that could land them in trouble.The advisory comes in the backdrop of Kashmiri students getting into trouble in other states in the past for allegedly cheering for Pakistani sportspersons during matches with India.In a statement widely circulated on social media, Nasir Khuehami, national convenor of the association, said Kashmiri students should treat the match “as just another sporting event and avoid any actions that might lead to unnecessary complications”. They should remain cautious as there are political connotations and deep emotions attached to an India-Pakistan match, he added.Alluding to the Pakistani team without naming it, Khuehami said; “Students must understand that by openly cheering for any particular team, they may find themselves in a vulnerable position... It is crucial for them to exercise caution and prioritise their safety on campuses and in their accommodations, keeping in mind the well-being of their families back home.”The JKSA convener pointed out that in the past, dozens of Kashmiri students were detained, arrested, summoned or booked for their social media activity or engaging in heated debates during India-Pakistan matches. “Such incidents have led to serious academic and legal consequences, impacting their education and future prospects,” he said.There is also a huge resentment among some sections in the country “with respect to this cricket match, in the backdrop of the Pahalgam terror attack and the eventual escalation of conflict”, Khuehami said. Despite Kashmiris coming out overwhelmingly in support of the Pahalgam victims and strongly against terrorism, there were several incidents in other parts of India “where students from Jammu and Kashmir suffered the most”, he added.“This particular cricket match will not be seen merely from a sports point of view but will inevitably carry political, emotional and nationalistic angles. We, therefore, reiterate the message of peace, caution, and harmony during this sensitive time,” he stated.",Kashmiri students advised to refrain from making social media posts that could land them in trouble.

Xavier Worthy dislocated his shoulder in the opener and is now listed as doubtful



The Chiefs are already short-handed at wide receiver and this only makes it worse



It feels like the Kansas City Chiefs just can’t catch a break with their wide receivers. Rookie sensation Xavier Worthy, who was supposed to be a game-changer in Patrick Mahomes ’ offense, is already dealing with a major setback. After dislocating his shoulder in the Week 1 opener against the Chargers, Worthy’s status for the Chiefs’ Week 2 clash with the Philadelphia Eagles isn’t looking too good. Here’s the latest scoop on his injury, what the team is saying, and how it impacts Kansas City’s game plan.Xavier Worthy’s NFL journey didn’t exactly start the way fans hoped. Just three plays into the season opener in São Paulo, Brazil, the rookie wideout went down after colliding with teammate Travis Kelce. The result? A dislocated right shoulder that immediately raised concerns about how long he’d be sidelined.The Chiefs have since confirmed he has been practicing on a limited basis this week while wearing extra shoulder protection. But when Friday’s official injury report dropped, Worthy was stamped as “doubtful” for Sunday’s big matchup against the Eagles. Andy Reid didn’t sugarcoat it either, he told reporters that Worthy’s chances of suiting up are “slim.”Kansas City’s receiver room was already thin before this injury.Rashee Rice is serving a six-game suspension, Jalen Royals has been ruled out, and now Worthy is highly unlikely to play. That leaves Hollywood Brown, JuJu Smith-Schuster, and Tyquan Thornton shouldering the load for Mahomes.Worthy was drafted specifically for his lightning speed and ability to stretch defenses vertically. Losing him this early takes away that explosive deep-ball option, which forces the Chiefs to lean more on short routes, screens, and their tight ends. In short, without Worthy, the offense looks a lot less scary.The silver lining in all of this? Doctors don’t believe Worthy needs surgery, and he’s not headed to injured reserve. That means the team expects him back in the coming weeks if rehab goes smoothly. Still, the Chiefs aren’t about to rush their rookie star back onto the field. Protecting his long-term health is the priority, even if it means taking a hit in the short term.The big question now is whether Worthy will test things in pregame warmups. Doubtful usually means out, but if he’s on the sidelines in full gear, it will at least show progress. For now, all eyes are on how Reid and Mahomes adjust the game plan without their speedy rookie.Also read - Cowboys vs. Giants heats up as CeeDee Lamb declares revenge on Dru Phillips","Xavier worthy dislocated his shoulder in the opener and is now listed as doubtful for sunday.

The visitors were bundled out for 158 in the 17th over, suffering their heaviest defeat in the format.For Salt, the evening was unforgettable. “That was really good fun,” he said afterwards. “A personal milestone but the fact we got 300 and won by such a big margin, I can’t have asked for much more.”His innings included eight sixes and 15 fours, and he overtook Liam Livingstone’s record for England’s fastest century by reaching three figures in 39 balls. It was also his fourth T20 hundred for England, making him the only player in the side to go beyond one.England’s bowlers then enjoyed their share of success as Jofra Archer picked up 3 for 25, Sam Curran took 2 for 11 and Will Jacks struck twice at the end. The win sets up a decider in Nottingham on Sunday, with Harry Brook pleased about the preparation. “Every must-win game we have now leading to the T20 World Cup is awesome preparation for us,” he said.The night, though, belonged to Salt, who walked off unbeaten, applauded by a buzzing Old Trafford crowd after writing a fresh chapter in England’s white-ball story.","England beat south africa by 146 runs at old trafford.

Tyreek Hill is under a lot of pressure after domestic abuse allegations from his ex-wife, Keeta Vaccaro, but the Miami Dolphins player is staying focused on the game. In his first public comments on Friday, Hill referred to the accusations as mere ""noise"" and emphasized that his main focus is on football and spending time with his children. With the NFL looking into the matter and Dolphins coach Mike McDaniel supporting him, Hill's remarks show his resolve to keep his personal issues separate from his professional game.Tyreek Hill, the standout wide receiver for the Miami Dolphins, spoke to the press on Friday, September 12, 2025, in light of the ongoing domestic abuse allegations from his estranged wife, Keeta Vaccaro.In his first public remarks since the allegations emerged, Hill highlighted his commitment to his work and personal life, saying that his top focus continues to be on football and family. ""My focus right now is just playing ball, and spending time with my kids and just doing what I’m best at: providing for my family,"" Hill spoke to the media at a press conference held at the Dolphins' training center in Miami Gardens, Florida.He added, ""So all the noise, I feel like if you allow that kind of stuff to get in the way of what you’re trying to do, it can only cloud what you’re really trying to get accomplished.""Hill's statement seems like a calculated move to shift focus from his personal legal issues back to his game.By calling the allegations ""noise,"" he made it clear that he wants to separate the situation, steering clear of directly addressing the claims so they don't mess with his sports career and team objectives.Hill's reply is rooted in a heated divorce battle with Keeta Vaccaro, his wife since November 2023. TMZ reports that Vaccaro claimed there were eight incidents of domestic violence that took place starting in January 2024.The claims were laid out in documents tied to their ongoing divorce proceedings in a Florida court. Vaccaro has accused his spouse of physical abuse throughout their marriage, but the initial reports didn't go into specifics about each incident. These documents were included in Vaccaro's plea for protective measures and financial assistance during the separation.Ever since Hill married Vaccaro in a hurry in the middle of the 2023 NFL, the relationship between both women attracted a great deal of attention. In January 2024 they originally filed divorce, but had briefly gotten back together before Vaccaro filed a repeat filing in May 2024.Together with the recent happenings related to a household brutality accusation, their legal battle has gotten all the more complex, continuing to debate on property and custody of children.The NFL has started looking into the allegations, as a league spokesperson confirmed in a statement to ESPN on Wednesday, September 10, 2025. The spokesperson mentioned, ""It is standard policy for the league to review a matter such as this,"" showing that the investigation is still in process and continuing.According to the NFL's Personal Conduct Policy, players might get disciplined, which can include suspensions, if any violations are proven, even if there aren't any criminal charges. They didn't give a timeline for when the investigation will be done.Miami Dolphins head coach Mike McDaniel spoke about the situation in a press conference at the team's facility.

Draymond Green doubts Josh Allen’s ability to “be the guy”



Do Josh Allen’s playoff struggles justify Green’s criticism?



The Buffalo Bills head into Week 2 of the NFL season riding high after a dramatic 41-40 comeback win over the Baltimore Ravens. Quarterback Josh Allen once again showcased his brilliance, throwing for nearly 400 yards and adding two rushing scores. Yet, not everyone is convinced he can lead Buffalo to the promised land. Golden State Warriors star Draymond Green has made his doubts loud and clear, and his words are sure to stir debate among football fans.Speaking with NFL insider Jordan Schultz, Green did not mince words when asked about Allen’s standing among top quarterbacks. “He’s not the guy,” Green said bluntly. “Yeah, no. And like I said before, Josh Allen is like a damn good quarterback, but just because he’s a damn good quarterback, don’t make you a guy. He’s never going to get it done when it matters the most.”Green, a four-time NBA champion, pointed out that true greatness is defined by postseason success. For him, Allen’s lack of a Super Bowl appearance overshadows his regular-season heroics. “Jalen Hurts is the guy. Patty Mahomes is the guy. Josh Allen isn’t the guy, when it matters the most,” Green added. “By the way, they can go at me all they want until they win a Super Bowl, I’m right.”His comments came despite Allen’s spectacular Week 1 performance, which many considered a statement game to open Buffalo’s season.While Green’s assessment may sound harsh, the numbers do highlight a frustrating truth for the Bills. Allen has made 13 playoff starts but has yet to reach the Super Bowl — the most postseason starts without an appearance for any active quarterback. Time and again, Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs have blocked Buffalo’s path, leaving Allen and his team stuck on the outside looking in.That said, Allen’s individual playoff performances have rarely been the issue. He owns a strong passer rating of around 100 in the postseason, with big plays both through the air and on the ground. In many of Buffalo’s exits, the defense has faltered at critical moments, making it difficult to pin all the blame on the quarterback.For now, Green’s critique hangs over Allen’s legacy. Regular-season magic has never been in question, but until Buffalo breaks through with a Super Bowl run, skeptics like Green will keep questioning whether Allen is truly “the guy.”Also Read: ""Eliminate distractions"": Julian Edelman spills truth on Bill Belichick’s no-nonsense dating advice before coach’s romance with Jordon Hudson","Draymond green doubts josh allen’s ability to “be the guy” for the buffalo bills.

NFL star Julian Edelman weighs in on Bill Belichick and Jordon Hudson



Julian Edelman reacts to Bill Belichick coaching Tar Heels



Former New England Patriots star Julian Edelman has opened up about his old coach, Bill Belichick, and his new relationship. Speaking to People, Edelman reflected on the legendary coach’s long-standing philosophy of “eliminating distractions” and admitted he found it ironic that Belichick’s own girlfriend, Jordon Hudson, is now drawing headlines.Bill Belichick, 73, is regarded as one of the greatest football coaches of all time, with six Super Bowl victories under his belt. He is now leading the North Carolina Tar Heels, but off the field, his relationship with 24-year-old Jordon Hudson has become a talking point. The couple, who share a 48-year age gap, met in 2021 and went public in early 2023.Edelman, who played 12 seasons under Belichick in New England, recalled how strict his coach was when it came to focus. “Everyone has their life outside of the sport. What he always told me is that we had to eliminate distractions. So, I don’t know. You could take what you want with that,” Edelman said.The former wide receiver even remembered times when Belichick scolded him for letting personal matters interfere with football. “I remember getting yelled at for being a distraction, so I think we’re all in the business of eliminating distractions.That’s just from what I learned from him.”The comments highlight the irony many fans see today: a coach who once preached about avoiding outside noise is now under the spotlight for his own personal life. For Edelman, it seems like a reminder that no one, not even Belichick, is immune to distractions.Beyond Belichick’s personal life, Edelman also shared his thoughts on seeing his former coach back on the sidelines. Watching North Carolina’s first games of the season, he was impressed by the energy and execution. “The first thing that came to my mind, ‘They look great in that first drive.’ Boy, did they look good. Man, Coach Belichick had them firing on all cylinders,” Edelman said.Still, Edelman acknowledged that Belichick faces challenges with a roster full of fresh faces. “TCU looked like they had a bunch of really good football players, and North Carolina had 70 new players on the roster. That’s a lot of players, and they have some catching up to do in that talent department.”Despite those hurdles, Edelman believes Belichick’s presence brings attention and credibility. “It was good to see him follow up that first week with the win against Charlotte, which he needed to win, but we’ll see how he does this week.”For Edelman, watching Belichick adapt to a new chapter is both exciting and ironic. The same coach who once drilled “eliminate distractions” into his players is now navigating distractions of his own.Also Read: Patrick Mahomes' wife Brittany seemingly speaks out on Charlie Kirk’s death with cryptic post about hate and division","Julian edelman has opened up about his old coach, bill belichick, and his new relationship.

Eagles-Chiefs rivalry continues to fuel fan interest



In a time when divisions often define society, the NFL still manages to bring people together. On Sunday, nearly 30 million Americans are expected to gather around their screens for the Philadelphia Eagles and Kansas City Chiefs’ highly anticipated Week 2 clash. Media insiders told The Athletic that Fox is projecting a record-breaking audience, setting the stage for one of the most-watched September games in NFL history.This isn’t just another early-season matchup. It is the 11th time in NFL history that a Super Bowl rematch takes place the very next season, and only the fourth to happen this early. Historically, the defending champion has won seven of the previous 10 rematches. With those stakes in play, Sunday’s game already feels bigger than Week 2 football.For Fox, the setup could not be more favorable. Competing games on CBS feature smaller markets, leaving the national spotlight solely on Eagles-Chiefs. Add in the fact that both teams draw strong fan bases, and it becomes clear why projections are climbing. If the broadcast reaches 30 million, it would surpass last year’s Week 2 record of 27.87 million from Bengals-Chiefs and challenge the all-time September mark of 31.1 million, set in 1993.Fox is treating the showdown like a playoff game. “Fox NFL Sunday” will air its first-ever two-hour pregame show on location, broadcasting from Kansas City’s Power & Light District and Arrowhead Stadium. Producers say they expect more than 3,000 fans to watch the pregame broadcast in person, bringing a festival-like atmosphere before kickoff.Richie Zyontz, the game’s producer for Fox, compared the event to NASCAR’s Daytona 500, saying, “Boom, right out of the box, you’ve got the biggest event of the year.” He added that the early-season timing forces the network to sharpen up quickly: “Truth be spoken, it would be great if it was cold and it was November or December, but it certainly gets us to shake out the cob webs early in the season and really sharpen up for what should be a great game. ”This is not the first time these two teams have drawn monster ratings. Their Super Bowl LIX meeting attracted a record 127.7 million viewers, while their 2023 regular-season clash pulled in more than 29 million, making it the most-watched Monday night game in nearly three decades.The NFL has strategically stacked its early schedule with marquee games, but Sunday’s matchup is clearly the crown jewel. Whether or not it breaks the September record, the Eagles-Chiefs showdown will showcase once again why the NFL remains America’s most powerful television force.Also Read: NFL clarifies decision to observe moment of silence for Charlie Kirk during Packers-Commanders game","Experts predict eagles vs chiefs super bowl rematch could drive record-breaking nfl ratings this september.

NEW DELHI: Back in 2018, when Gukesh Dommaraju and Divya Deshmukh were barely 13, they shared more than just a chessboard.In a now-viral clip from those early days, Divya asks Gukesh, “How much Hindi do you know?” To which the boy wonder tosses a deadpan reply, “Zero!”Though Divya’s instant reaction is to roll her eyes in mock disbelief, she would soon slip into the role of a translator, turning Gukesh’s English analysis into Hindi for a chess platform's Hindi channel, and in the process win over millions on social media.Seven years on, the setting could not have been more different. Amid the architectural splendour of Samarkand in Uzbekistan, the two prodigies, now Grandmasters (GMs) in their late teens, met again on Friday - except they didn't speak a word between them for hours at end.But this time, at the FIDE Grand Swiss, Gukesh, rated 2767, was the reigning World Champion and Divya, rated 2478, the Women’s World Cup winner. It was their first-ever clash in a classical format and also a reminder of how far Indian chess had come, and how blurred the lines between “male” and “female” boards have begun to look.“The eighth-round game between Gukesh and Divya Deshmukh in the FIDE Grand Swiss ended in a hard-fought battle after 103 moves,” GM Pravin Thipsay told TimesofIndia.com while analysing the game.“Divya chose a very unusual continuation on her fourth move (4…Be7). Apparently, Gukesh didn’t know this line because he took 17 minutes for his fifth move.""Although he had lost a lot of time, the opening choice of Divya doesn’t really look very sound, and White does get some very good technical edge.It was very dangerous to play such a position against Gukesh. In fact, I would never have thought that. And by move 12 or 13, Gukesh was already with a good sound advantage by advancing the queenside pawn (12.a5).”Yet, the youngest-ever world champion, undergoing a poor run of form at Grand Swiss this time, let his chances slip.“Gukesh chose a completely different plan to play on the kingside, and with 15.Bxf4, he opened up the game on the other side. As a result, all his advantage was gone, and we had roughly equal position,” explained Thipsay.“Later, Divya's decision to exchange Queen on move 19th didn't seem to be very good, and again Gukesh had the upper hand. But on 23.Nd2, Gukesh somehow didn’t find the right square for the knight, and that reduced the advantage. The game was thereafter into a very complex situation when nothing much was happening.”“Gukesh’s placement of the knight and the rooks after 28 moves turned out to be really bad and unproductive. And Divya, for the first time, got an advantage by move 30. It was a slight tangible advantage in an endgame, probably not enough to win, but she was better,” the 66-year-old GM continued.“A repetition could have taken place by move 40, but Gukesh refrained from repeating the moves and sacrificed a pawn. The rest of the game became a dead position, with Gukesh trying to set traps. Divya gave up a knight for the last pawn and got into an obvious rook-and-knight versus rook position, which is a theoretical draw.”For Thipsay, Gukesh is having his ""worst phase"" after a poor run of results, including three defeats, in the Grand Swiss.“This entire year has been quite bad. Hardly any event has passed where he hasn’t lost rating. So one can say this is probably the worst phase in Gukesh’s life since 2021.”It is a sobering assessment for the youngest World Champion. Once hailed as unstoppable, Gukesh now sits outside the top 10 in the live ratings, his 2748.2 mark dropping him to 12th place.For Divya Deshmukh, however, the draw was more than just half a point.“Women players rarely get consistent chances against 2600+ opposition,” Thipsay opined. “For her, tournaments like these are about exposure, practice, and proving herself. She has played with great spirit, and this result will give her confidence.”Gukesh, on the other hand, was never playing for qualification. Already holding the World Championship crown, he had no Candidates’ slot to chase. “He's only playing for practice and to expose himself to the elite players,” said Thipsay.But practice or not, every half-point surrendered has its cost.As the players shook hands after six and a half hours of play, there was no winner, yet no shortage of drama. With three rounds left, the tournament can still swing either way, “bad to worse” for Gukesh, or “good to better” for Divya.For now, the headline writes itself: The World Champion is out of the top 10. And the hand that nudged him down belongs to an old friend who once teased him about Hindi.","D gukesh and divya deshmukh, once child prodigies, faced off in the classical chess format for the first time at the fide grand swiss.

Nasser Al Dawsari and Musab Al Juwayr set the stage



Al Hilal relies on Nasser Al Dawsari’s midfield presence



Musab Al Juwayr aims to shine for Al Qadsiah



Al Hilal and Al Qadsiah meet in one of the most anticipated fixtures of the early Roshn Saudi League season. The Kingdom Arena will see familiar faces collide, as two Saudi Arabian internationals who once shared the same locker room prepare to face each other. Nasser Al Dawsari and Musab Al Juwayr are at the center of attention in a match that has plenty of storylines.For the first time since his permanent move away from Riyadh, Musab Al Juwayr will play against his former club. The midfielder, who earned the league’s Young Player of the Year award last season, joined Al Qadsiah this summer. He steps into a No.10 role, tasked with supplying the attacking pair of Julian Quinones and Mateo Retegui. Across the field, Nasser Al-Dawsari has been growing into a more influential figure for Al-Hilal.Nasser Al-Dawsari has long been regarded as a player waiting for his breakthrough. That moment arrived under Inzaghi. The Italian coach, who took charge earlier this year, has shown confidence in the midfielder, starting him in every game since his arrival. His role often goes unnoticed on the stats sheet. Instead of piling up goals or assists, Al Dawsari disrupts attacks, controls passing lanes, and keeps possession moving.For Musab Al Juwayr, Saturday’s clash is more than just another league game. After two seasons on loan at Al Shabab, he made his permanent exit from Al Hilal this summer. Now wearing Al Qadsiah’s No.10 shirt, he has the platform to prove his growth since leaving the club.With both players holding key roles for their sides, the outcome of their contest could set the tone not only for the match but also for their clubs’ campaigns ahead.

Predrag Rajkovic 's red card changes the momentum



Muhannad Al Shanqeeti seals dramatic late win



Al Ittihad showed they can win without Karim Benzema . In their first home game of the Saudi Pro League season, the defending champions beat Al Fateh 4-2. Steven Bergwijn scored twice, while Laurent Blanc’s side handled a dramatic contest filled with goals and red cards.Benzema, who scored a hat-trick in the opening week, was unavailable due to injury. That left space for Steven Bergwijn to step up.The Dutch forward delivered, scoring in the 35th and 39th minutes. His first goal gave Al Ittihad a 2-1 lead, and his second doubled the advantage before halftime. It was a reminder of his impact last season and showed he can carry the team when Benzema is missing.Before Bergwijn’s goals, Houssem Aouar had opened the scoring in the 22nd minute. Al Fateh responded quickly through Matias Vargas, leveling the game at 1-1. But Bergwijn’s brace shifted control toward the champions. Al Fateh’s Mourad Batna was then sent off before the break, leaving his side with a steep challenge.The game turned again after halftime. Al Ittihad goalkeeper Predrag Rajkovic received a red card for fouling Fahad Al Zubaidi inside the box.That dismissal gave Al Fateh hope, and Sofiane Bendebka converted the penalty in the 69th minute to make it 3-2.Suddenly, the two-goal cushion was gone. And tension grew inside Alinma Stadium.For a short spell, Al Fateh looked capable of stealing a point. With both sides reduced to ten men, the contest became wide open, and mistakes at the back could have punished either team.Al Ittihad eventually settled nerves in stoppage time. Muhannad Al Shanqeeti scored the fourth goal, confirming a 4-2 victory.The defending champions now have six points from their first two games, scoring nine goals in the process. Bergwijn’s finishing, combined with Blanc’s tactical management, underlined that this squad has multiple attacking threats beyond Benzema.Elsewhere in the Saudi Pro League on Friday, Al Ahli played a goalless draw against Al Ettifaq.

Team form, key players, and what to expect

The marquee team, Al-Ittihad, will be hosting Al-Fateh in Round 2 of the 2025–26 Saudi Pro League, where both teams will give it a fight. The defending champions, Al-Ittihad, will be in the spotlight in tonight’s match. In their first match, the reigning champions, managed by Laurent Blanc, brushed aside Al-Okhdood 5-2, while Al-Fateh slumped to a surprising 1-0 home defeat to Al-Fayha. The game provides Al-Ittihad a chance to reaffirm their title contender status at home, with Al-Fateh looking to come out to play and upset.The highly anticipated matchup is scheduled for Friday, 12 September 2025, at the Al-Inma Bank Stadium in King Abdullah Sport City, Jeddah.Kick-off times:Where to watch:Al-Ittihad will come into this game in some intense attacking form. Although they showed some cracks in the defensive unit corridor against here, a 5-2 opening win, this showcased the firepower out there. The opponent was hit with a hat-trick from star striker Karim Benzema that evening, where he once again established his place as their number one source of attack. There will be plenty of goals and assists as well from winger Steven Bergwijn.Al-Fateh, in contrast, is expected to take a more patient and counter-attacking style. Combining Youssouf and Bendebka in midfield will be vital for them to keep the ball and transition into the attack. Defensive issues remain a concern, and they will face their biggest test yet as they try to handle the pressure on the road.Also Read: Will Karim Benzema play tonight against Al-Fateh? Latest update on Al-Ittihad star’s availability History strongly favors Al-Ittihad. They also benefited from their home fans as they have clinched their most recent five league clashes against Al-Fateh in Jeddah. This will leave Al-Fateh hoping to remain tactically disciplined and score from set pieces or capitalize on the few opportunities that come their way. If Al-Ittihad can keep up their attacking threat without being too careless, they are very much the favorites for all three points.Prediction: Al-Ittihad 3-1 Al-Fateh. The champions are likely to dictate possession and have a larger share of goal-scoring opportunities, though Al-Fateh could get on the score sheet via the counter or from a set piece.","Al-ittihad host al-fateh in round 2 of the 2025–26 saudi pro league.

Let’s gauge through the emotions each of these women went through when they were in a relationship with the Ayahuasca Retreat lover, Aaron Rodgers.Shailene Woodley described her relationship with former Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers in an interview with Melissa Johnson ofMagazine.actress said she had lost herself completely. She said she understood what anxiety and depression truly were. Her stylist, Kris Zero, would try her level best to keep theactress occupied, but she would feel depressed again.“I haven’t shared much about my relationship with Aaron(Rodgers) because it always makes me cry. It was not right. But it was beautiful. I had a really awful, traumatic thing happen in early 2022.I felt like I lost my soul, my self, my happiness, my joy. I really understood depression and anxiety, and like, complete soul detachment.”She chose to remain in a toxic situation because she was empathizing with someone else.“Empathy kind of kept me in this loop of feeling everything for everyone. I knew I was depressed when I looked at a tree and felt nothing. That was the lowest low of my life.”Shailene Woodley’s stylist, Kris Zero, would wake her up with blasting music just to get her out of bed. “Sometimes I was so angry at her. But then we’d go surf, and for ten minutes that day, I thought life could be okay again.Then the depression would come back, and she’d out–We’re volunteering at the horse ranch! – and we’d find a random f*cking horse ranch and we’d clean up horse sh*t.We’d clean hooves and brush the horses, and for 20 minutes that day, I thought like could be okay again. And then depression came back, and she’d wake up the next morning and go–Let’s go on a hike and bring trash bags and clean up trash!”Melissa reported that after about six months, the depression started to fade.Olivia Munn, theactress, appeared on thepodcast, where she talked about a past relationship in which she felt trapped in a tumultuous family dynamic. She said that her therapist encouraged her to stay in the relationship that she wanted to get out of.“I had a therapist who I really loved, and I know that she cared about me, or at least I thought she did. I would constantly, from the very beginning, say–I don’t know about this, I don’t think this is the right(relationship), I want to get out. I gotta get out,” Munn said.Theactress said her therapist encouraged her to stay in that relationship. “She thought that my ‘picker’ was off, and she would look at it as: this person on paper looked great. And when there was couples therapy, they knew how to present the right way. Then the stories I would tell seemed unbelievable.From that experience, learning that I gotta go with my gut and I gotta be decisive with some things if it’s coming from a place where I want to survive, and I realize that I’m not happy, and that days and weeks and months go by of unhappiness and fear.I don’t know if there’s a word to describe what that relationship was like. It was without a doubt the hardest period of my life, being in that,” she said she felt “really trapped in a tumultuous family dynamic.”Munn further said that the relationship taught her to stand up for herself. “It taught me how to stand up and fight for myself, so that was great. I truly had no idea that I could be manipulated and hurt that way, that I wouldn’t just get out of something that was dangerous to my psyche.It’s not just the period that you’re with the person, but, if you’re lucky to get out, (it’s) the years of healing yourself afterwards,” Munn told Lewinsky.She further shared, “The catalyst was getting out of a relationship that had drained me and left me just really...it's hard, I don't know if there's a word to describe it what that relationship was like...it was, without a doubt, the hardest period of my life, being in that.”Danica Patrick, the former professional racing driver and model, appeared onpodcast, where she disclosed that she was in an emotionally abusive relationship with the 41-year-old quarterback, Aaron Rodgers.“The breakup with Aaron(Rodgers) in 2020—because it was sudden, it felt like it was my life. When you live with somebody, it’s your whole life—your dentist appointments, your hairdo, your clothes, your mailing address, everything. Because the nature of the relationship was emotionally abusive, it wore me down to nothing.Something that people could never imagine is that I would lack any confidence or belief in the simple things about who I am. Everything was torn to bits.He leaves a trail of blood. I don’t think I’m saying too much earth-shattering stuff; there’s been enough out there.But it gave me the greatest gift, which was myself—how much I needed to show up for myself, take care of myself,” Patrick told Sage Steele.The former IndyCar Series and NASCAR driver said she felt like she was built for hard things when she was in a relationship with Rodgers,“Hindsight, I ignored it(emotionally abusive relationship), but in real life, it was just like, I would say all the time—I’m built for hard things. I can handle hard things. And so, I just saw it as a hard thing, and my nature is to try harder and do more.What if I don't do it for the right person? What if I get too proud and go like—I'm just I'm done. Instead of going—Man, just try a little harder. What if you look back and think—Man, I wish I would have tried. I would never want that in my life. I wish I would have tried. This is probably why I don't have regret and I don't have shame.”","Aaron rodgers’ former partners have shared powerful excerpts from their past relationships, including phrases like “depression would come,’ “dangerous to my psyche,” and “emotionally abusive. ” thanks to the podcast world, women have started expressing themselves beyond the fear of judgment.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123764899,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-3192143,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Poll Which boxer’s performance impressed you the most at the World Boxing Championships? Jaismine Lamboria Nupur Pooja Rani Minakshi

NEW DELHI: Liverpool witnessed a landmark moment for Indian boxing on Saturday night as Jaismine Lamboria stormed to gold in the women’s 57kg category at the World Boxing Championships 2025, defeating Olympic silver medallist Julia Szeremeta of Poland in a gripping final. Adding to India’s glory, Nupur clinched silver in the women’s +80kg division, rounding off one of India’s finest campaigns on the world stage.Jaismine’s bout against Szeremeta began under intense pressure, with the Polish boxer — roared on by a large local contingent of supporters — taking the early initiative. However, the 24-year-old Indian regrouped brilliantly in the second round, using her superior reach and sharp counterpunching to wrest control of the contest. She never let go thereafter, sealing a 4-1 split decision victory and India’s first gold medal of the tournament.“This feeling can’t be expressed in words, I’m so happy to be a world champion,” an emotional Jaismine told Olympics.com. “After my early exit at Paris 2024, I worked hard on both my technique and mental strength. This medal is the reward for a year of relentless dedication.”While Jaismine’s triumph sparked celebrations, India’s medal tally grew further when heavyweight boxer Nupur battled valiantly but fell short in the women’s +80kg final against Poland’s Agata Kaczmarska.In a tightly fought contest, Kaczmarska, shorter but aggressive, neutralized Nupur’s height advantage by fighting at close quarters. The Polish boxer landed a decisive punch in the dying seconds to edge out Nupur 3-2 on split decision.Earlier in the day, Pooja Rani secured a podium finish, signing off with a bronze after a gritty semifinal battle against England’s Emily Asquith. India’s campaign was already historic, with three women boxers — Minakshi (48kg), Jaismine (57kg), and Nupur (80kg) — reaching the finals for the first time ever.","Jaismine lamboria wins gold in women's 57kg category at the world boxing championships 2025.

English bubbly beats champagne for first time to win top award,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/english-bubbly-beats-champagne-for-first-time-to-win-top-award/articleshow/123838270.cms,"



LONDON: A prestigious award for sparkling wine has gone to an English bubbly rather than a wine from the Champagne region in France for the first time ever.Nyetimber’s £130 (Rs 15,000) Blanc de Blancs 2016 Magnum on Tuesday became the first ever non-Champagne wine to win the Champion Sparkling Wine Trophy at the International Wine Challenge (ICW) in London in the competition’s history.It was described by judges as a “racy, pithy blanc de blanc.. a time capsule of a wine with mouth-watering acidity, citrus zest and camomile, with a chalky finish”. It achieved 97 points, beating four others in the shortlist including the €260 (Rs 27,000) champagne Le Clos Lanson Blanc de Blanc 2010.Nyetimber’s head winemaker, Cherie Spriggs, also won Sparkling Winemaker of the Year for the second time, having first been awarded the trophy in 2018. At that time, she was the first person outside of Champagne to win the award and the first woman.British wine has never had more sparkle. Nyetimber is now the favourite among discerning high classes in the UK and is served at top restaurants, hotels and bars such as Annabel’s, The Goring, The Savoy and The Ivy. Nyetimber is not yet on sale in India.Spriggs and husband Brad Greatrix, who have been making English sparkling wine at Nyetimber, an historic estate, which appears in the Domesday Book, now owned by Dutchman Eric Heerema, since 2007, put its success down to the greensand and chalk soils at their 11 vineyards in West Sussex, Hampshire, and Kent. The soil is similar to that of the Champagne region thanks to the same chalk seam which runs under the English Channel.With the weather in England getting warmer owing to global warming, the South Downs has become ideal for growing the classic champagne grapes: Chardonnay, Pinot Noir, and Pinot Meunier.","Nyetimber’s £130 (rs 15,000) blanc de blancs 2016 magnum on tuesday became the first ever non-champagne wine to win the champion sparkling wine trophy.
