Pune Headlines Today — Key Stories You Shouldn’t Miss.







PUNE: Former Union minister and senior Congress leader Suresh Kalmadi passed away at the age of 81 after a prolonged illness.He was undergoing treatment at Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital in Pune.According to his office, Kalmadi’s mortal remains will be kept at Kalmadi House in Erandwane till 2 pm to allow people to pay their last respects. The cremation will be held at Vaikunth smashanbhumi in Navi Peth, Pune, at 3.30 pm.Kalmadi was a veteran politician and sports administrator who served as the president of the Indian Olympic Association (IOA) and played a key role in India’s sports administration for several years.He came under national scrutiny in connection with the 2010 Commonwealth Games corruption case and was booked under the Prevention of Corruption Act for alleged misappropriation of Games funds. He was arrested in April 2011, following which the Congress suspended him from the party.Despite the controversy, Kalmadi continued to wield influence in sports bodies. In 2016, he and Abhay Singh Chautala were appointed life presidents of the IOA by a panel of over 150 members.However, after the Union sports minister sought a probe into the decision, Kalmadi declined the honour, stating in a letter to then IOA president N Ramachandran that the timing was not appropriate for him to accept the post.Before entering politics, Kalmadi served in the Indian Air Force as a pilot from 1964 to 1972, and retired from service in 1974. He later entered public life and went on to serve as Minister of State for Railways between 1995 and 1996 during a Congress-led government.","Former union minister and ex-ioa chief suresh kalmadi passes away in pune.

Maria Hanslovan’s fitness career, joint assets, and net worth of the duo





The brilliant career in Major League Baseball was the main factor that created the foundation of Andrew McCutchen’s finances. In 2005, the Pittsburgh Pirates called him up without delay, he threw at the peak of his superstar career, and later, he was awarded five All-Star titles and the National League MVP in 2013. Maria Hanslovan, McCutchen's wife, has set up her own fitness and wellness career which has been a steady income source for the couple and thus, has improved their financial stability.Through 16 seasons in the majors, McCutchen's total money earned from the MLB contracts was about $131.4 million. The highest salary he got was in 2012 when he agreed to a six-year deal, $51.5 million contract extension with the Pirates, thus making the player the franchise’s mainstay.Later transfers to teams like San Francisco Giants, Philadelphia Phillies, and Milwaukee Brewers accounted for even more millions, while his signing of a one-year $5 million contract renewal with the Pirates in 2025 is a testament to both his status as a veteran and his continuing worth to the team. Salaries, however, were not the only way, as he was also coming into the picture through endorsement deals by the likes of Nike and Marucci Sports, whose reputation he was in part making as a respected leader and role model.His public persona of being involved in philanthropy and community outreach, among other things, has made him more marketable and has thus provided him with the needed steady income streams even if he stops playing already.Formal fitness certifications play a minor role in Maria's career; the major part is the inspiration drawn from her personal story. Maria has made herself a confidante in the health and wellness area by sharing her training, eating habits, and playful family life. Her power is not restricted to the fitness world. She represents a person who supports McCutchen's cause and, at the same time, flourishes on her own.Collectively, the MLB power couple, Andrew McCutchen and Maria Hanslovan have $60-$65 million. Their wealth keeps rising from professional careers and joint assets alongside brand deals.

How Anthony Edwards’ status affects the game





ahead of their January 6, 2026 home game against the Miami Heat at Target Center. He was added to the injury report late in the day and is listed as questionable due to right foot injury maintenance.The timing matters. Minnesota is coming off a win over Miami in this short two-game set, and Edwards has been central to that success. His late appearance on the report has shifted attention away from the matchup itself and toward whether the Wolves will have their leading scorer on the floor at tip-off.Anthony Edwards is dealing with right foot maintenance, the same issue that caused him to miss multiple games in December. This is not a new injury, but it is something the team has monitored closely throughout the season. The questionable tag was added only hours before the scheduled 7:00 PM ET start.Minnesota has not indicated that Edwards suffered any setback in his last outing. The listing appears precautionary, especially given his recent workload and the tight schedule. As of now, no final decision has been announced, and his status could change shortly before game time.Before landing on the injury report, Edwards was playing at a high level. He scored 33 points in Minnesota’s 125–115 win over Miami and followed that with a 35-point performance against Washington, along with four steals. He is averaging 28.7 points per game this season, placing him among the league’s top scorers.If Anthony Edwards is unavailable, Minnesota will need to adjust quickly. Guards like Bones Hyland and Mike Conley would take on more responsibility, while the offense would rely more on half-court execution rather than Edwards’ shot creation.Miami enters the game in relatively better shape. Tyler Herro is available after dealing with toe issues and will play alongside Bam Adebayo. Jaime Jaquez Jr. remains out with an ankle sprain. Nikola Jovic and Keshad Johnson are available, while Terry Rozier continues to be sidelined and is not with the team.Minnesota is favored at home, but that edge narrows if Edwards does not play. Without him, the Wolves lean more heavily on Julius Randle and Rudy Gobert for scoring and stability. If Edwards is cleared, Minnesota’s offense looks much closer to what it showed in the previous win. Either way, his status will shape how this rematch unfolds.","Anthony edwards was added to the minnesota timberwolves’ injury report late in the day.

Jordan Chiles’ former rivals take up new roles







Jordan Chiles began the 2026 NCAA gymnastics season with a statement performance. She won the all-around with a huge 39.725 score. She also topped all four events. UCLA won the meet with 196.975, finishing ahead of California, Washington, and Oregon State. It was the kind of opening night every athlete hopes for. Chiles looked confident after finishing runner-up in 2025.But the story was not only about who was on the floor. Just a few steps away, familiar faces watched from the sidelines. Jade Carey, Haleigh Bryant, and Mya Lauzon were no longer competing. They were coaching. These were the same gymnasts who pushed Chiles throughout the 2025 season. Their presence raised a big question. If they were still competing, would Chiles have dominated the opener so easily?Jade Carey has already embraced her new chapter. After ending her career at Oregon State, she stayed with the program as a Student Assistant Coach. Gymnastics Now shared a moment of her watching closely, with the caption, “Same team, different role for Coach Carey.” Carey knows what it takes to beat the best. In the 2025 NCAA Championships semifinal, she scored 39.6250 in the all-around. Chiles scored 39.5875 in the same session. Carey finished just ahead of her.Haleigh Bryant followed a similar path. One of LSU’s most successful gymnasts, she retired in April 2025.She soon joined LSU’s coaching staff for the 2025–26 season. After watching the season opener, she posted, “Nights like these are why it was so easy to stay.” Bryant had posted a 39.5625 all-around score in the 2025 semifinals. That was very close to Chiles’ numbers.Mya Lauzon also moved into coaching. After a strong career at Cal, she returned in 2026 as an assistant coach. She shared the opener scores on Instagram and wrote, “Just the beginning for these bears.” Lauzon had tied for the all-around title at the 2025 ACC Championships with 39.625.Jordan Chiles still proved her class. She once posted a season-high 39.775 at the 2025 team final. But if her former rivals were still competing, winning would not have been this easy for her.

Several messages were directed at his fiancée, Julia Otto, including personal and deeply offensive remarks about their relationship and upcoming wedding.Some messages reportedly told her to “cancel the wedding” or made cruel comments about their future together.Otto’s Instagram account was later set to private, while Loop limited comments on several of his posts.The incident once again highlighted the dark side of fan behaviour, where disappointment over a sporting result turns into personal harassment.While many comments were abusive, not all fans joined in the attacks. Some supporters stepped in to defend the rookie kicker, reminding others that football games are rarely decided by one play.“I am a forever Steeler fan and my heart hurts for him. He's just a kid people, give him a break!” one fan wrote. Another added, “Sports betting has poisoned people’s brains”Loop, who was drafted as a late-round pick, had otherwise put together a solid rookie season, making the majority of his field goals and extra points before the miss against Pittsburgh.Broadcast footage from the game showed an emotional Loop walking off the field, visibly shaken. Ravens head coach John Harbaugh was seen consoling the kicker as they headed to the locker room.Speaking after the game, Loop admitted the miss hurt deeply. “For it to end like that sucks,” he said, explaining that he felt something was off the moment the ball left his foot.The Ravens’ loss was painful, but the backlash that followed has raised serious questions about fan conduct. While criticism comes with professional sports, targeting players’ families crosses a line.As Baltimore reflects on a season that ended one kick short, the episode serves as a reminder that behind every missed moment is a human being and that abuse should never be part of the game.","The baltimore ravens lost to the pittsburgh steelers on january 4.

‘Helmet hit’ on Shedeur Sanders has NFL reviewing Bengals DE Cedric Johnson for possible fine,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/helmet-hit-on-shedeur-sanders-has-nfl-reviewing-bengals-de-cedric-johnson-for-possible-fine/articleshow/126377518.cms,"The NFL is reviewing a helmet hit on Shedeur Sanders that already drew a flag.

NFL reviewing Cedric Johnson hit that drew roughing-the-passer flag

Roughing-the-passer fines can get expensive fast

Shedeur Sanders also walked into a new reality after Kevin Stefanski got fired

Sanders’ offseason plan starts with family, but the QB1 question is still hanging





Shedeur Sanders ended his rookie season with a win. Now the NFL has to decide if the hit he took in that game deserves a financial penalty.The Cleveland Browns beat the Cincinnati Bengals 20-18 on Sunday in their 2025 finale, and Sanders took a controversial shot in the second quarter that already drew a flag. The league is now reviewing it, per Athlon Sports.Sanders helped Cleveland close 2025 with a second straight win, finishing 11 of 22 for 111 yards and adding three carries for 26 yards, according to Athlon Sports. The rookie finished his first season at 120 of 212 passing (56.6%) for 1,400 yards, seven touchdowns, and 10 interceptions.The moment getting reviewed happened in the first half against Cincinnati. Bengals defensive end Cedric Johnson hit Sanders and made contact with his helmet on a late tackle, per the Athlon Sports report. Officials threw a flag for roughing the passer, giving the Browns 15 yards and an automatic first down.Athlon Sports cited Rule 12 Section 12 Article 11 of the NFL rulebook: “any physical acts against a player who is in a passing posture (i.e. before, during, or after attempting a pass) which, in the game official’s judgment, are unwarranted by the circumstances of the play will be called as fouls.”Now the question is whether the league thinks the flag was enough, or if it wants to send a second message with a fine.Athlon Sports noted that roughing the passer carries a potential fine of $17,389 for a first offense and $23,186 for a second.Johnson is in his second NFL season and has not been fined before, per Athlon Sports. If the NFL does issue discipline, Athlon Sports reported it would be announced via the gameday accountability report that publishes every Saturday.That part matters. The on-field call already hit Cincinnati for 15 yards. A fine would hit Johnson’s wallet and put his name on the league’s paperwork, which is the kind of thing defenders do not forget when the NFL starts building a “repeat offender” history.The hit is not the only storyline orbiting Sanders right now. The Browns fired head coach Kevin Stefanski after a 5-12 season and six years in charge, according to TotalProSports.TotalProSports reported Sanders was asked about the move moments after the decision became public. He kept it measured and did not take a victory lap.“We just found out a couple of seconds ago,” Sanders said. “I think it’s overall the mentality, like, things are going to happen. It’s how the league is. Moving forward, just focus on what we can improve individually for the next head coach.”TotalProSports also reported Sanders said after Sunday’s finale that he and Stefanski “grew to understand each other.” Sanders added: “We would share different things that we would both go through,” and, “I know he wanted this win, and I know he wants every win, but I know that this one means a lot.”That is the tightrope for a rookie quarterback. Be honest. Do not burn bridges. Keep it moving because the next coach decides your future.While the NFL sorts out the Bengals hit and Cleveland sorts out its coaching search, Sanders already has his first offseason stop picked out.In a separate report, Rex Villas wrote that Sanders told reporters, via Ashly Holder of Cleveland 19 News: “First and foremost, I have to go see Shilo! I heard he has some Christmas gifts for me. Then be with the family, then get back to work.”Villas also noted Sanders’ short-term future is not locked in. Deshaun Watson and Dillon Gabriel remain on the roster, and Sanders’ case for QB1 will likely get judged again during the next training camp.That is the theme of Sanders’ January. He finished his rookie year with real game reps and a third career win. Now he waits on three separate decisions he cannot control: what the NFL does with that hit, who Cleveland hires next, and how the quarterback depth chart shakes out by the time camp opens.","The nfl is reviewing a helmet hit on shedeur sanders that already drew a flag.

Stephen Curry’s wife, Ayesha Curry, has gotten brutally trolled







Stephen Curry and his wife, Ayesha Curry, have inspired their fans around the world with the commitment they have shown towards each other for more than a decade.Stephen Curry, the Golden State Warriors’ star player, has always been known to be a perfect husband and a loving father who has always prioritised his family. Despite this, Stephen Curry’s wife, Ayesha Curry, opens up about the rage she feels when other women try to pursue her husband.A few years ago, Stephen Curry’s wife, Ayesha Curry, spoke to Jada Pinkett Smith on the now discontinued show, Red Table Talk, where she opened up about her anger.Ayesha Curry said, ""But there have been a couple of times, where I've wanted to punch somebody in the face for sure…He can't see it coming, I see it from a mile away.""The popular entrepreneur added, ""Stephen is very nice by nature…Everything is always very friendly, sometimes to the point where, 'I'm a grown woman,' so, I'll just insert myself and be like, 'Hello, how are you doing?'""Ayesha Curry added that ""the ladies will always be lurking, hoping for their moment and waiting.

The Detroit Red Wings made their coach's line changes look brilliant. Todd McLellan shuffled his forward lines before Monday night's game against Ottawa, and his team responded with three first-period goals in a 5-3 victory that pushed them back into first place in the Eastern Conference.James van Riemsdyk recorded a goal and two assists for his second multi-point game of the season, while John Gibson turned aside 35 shots to backstop the victory. The Red Wings improved to 25-15-4 with 54 points, reaching the 25-win mark in just 44 games for the fastest pace since the 2011-12 season.Van Riemsdyk explained that McLellan's decision to shuffle the lines sent a clear message to the group. ""Anytime the coach kind of shuffles up the lines a good amount like that, he's probably just trying to get the team's attention,"" he said.He continued, ""We had guys contributing all over the place tonight, and that's what it takes to win."" The Red Wings came out flying in the opening period, scoring three times in the first 19:43 to put Ottawa in a deep hole. Andrew Copp opened the scoring at 7:06 with a breakaway goal after stealing the puck in the neutral zone.Dylan Larkin added a power-play goal at 13:51 for his 22nd of the season, tying Nicklas Lidstrom for 11th place on the franchise's all-time goals list with 264.Van Riemsdyk capped the first-period surge with a goal at 19:43, spinning around in the right face-off circle and snapping a shot that deflected off Nick Jensen past Leevi Merilainen.The Ottawa goaltender was pulled after allowing three goals on eight shots, with Hunter Shepard entering in relief. Gibson was especially good in the opening stretch with 17 saves within the period to keep Detroit’s three-goal lead intact.Michael Rasmussen praised his goaltender's performance after the game. ""He's been awesome for us,"" Rasmussen said. ""MVP for us tonight."" Ottawa made things interesting in the second and third periods.

Brady Tkachuk stays calm while talking about the punch from Logan Stanley







Ottawa Senators captain Brady Tkachuk faced a tense moment on the ice earlier this month during a game against the Winnipeg Jets. The incident happened midway through the second period of Ottawa’s 4-2 win on January 3, highlighting the physical nature of the game and the challenges players face in high-pressure NHL games.The altercations involved a punch thrown by the Jets’ defenseman, Logan Stanley, who punched Tkachuk when he was still involved in the action on the ice. Referees stepped in immediately and gave Tkachuk a misconduct penalty with an assessment of ten minutes, and later suspended the player. The event sparked discussions around discipline, player safety, and the limits of aggressive play in the league.Tkachuk described the moment as completely unexpected. “Honestly, I was still watching the play, and then out of the corner of my eye I just see the punch coming. Caught me by surprise. I didn't expect it,” he said. Despite the incident, he quickly moved past it, returning to the game and recording an assist to help Ottawa secure the win.Video review confirmed Tkachuk was not facing Stanley when the punch landed, a key factor in the league’s decision. He added, “The league made its decision. I'm over it, I could care less now, it's in the past.” He stayed focused on helping his team, showing why he’s considered a strong leader on and off the ice.The incident didn’t distract him from Ottawa’s game plan.Stanley, who has relied heavily on physical play this season, has already recorded 82 penalty minutes through 40 games, surpassing his career high. His suspension sidelines him for the Jets’ home game against the Vegas Golden Knights, though he is expected back against the Edmonton Oilers later this week. Ottawa’s win extended Winnipeg’s losing streak to nine games, underscoring both the Senators’ momentum and Tkachuk’s leadership on the ice.The incident highlights the NHL's focus on player safety while being able to show the fine line between aggressive play and disciplinary action. Tkachuk's calm and measured response shows professionalism under pressure, while Stanley's approach does represent the fragility associated with physical enforcement in high-intensity games.Also Read: Jets defenseman Logan Stanley receives one-game suspension for incident involving Ottawa Senators captain Brady Tkachuk","Brady tkachuk was punched in the face by winnipeg jets defenseman logan stanley.

Jaylen Brown and Kendall Jenner





The intersection of professional basketball and the Kardashian-Jenner empire has become one of the most persistent storylines in modern sports media. For over a decade, courtside seats at NBA arenas have served as the backdrop for high-profile romances that often dominate headlines as much as the games themselves. This combination of hardwood players with the glitz of show business has been a cultural crossover, with critics often debating the impact of these pairings. But the tabloid has a field day with this fodder.The list of the NBA superstars who have headlined entertainment sites due to their relationship with the cast of Keeping Up With the Kardashians could create another superstar roster by itself. Let’s dive in and see how these couples navigated the pressure of the court and the spotlight of reality television.The most significant early chapter of this trend began with the Los Angeles Lakers star. His 2009 whirlwind marriage to Khloé Kardashian was a cornerstone of the family’s media rise, even spawning a spin-off series. Despite his success as a two-time NBA champion, his personal struggles eventually led to a high-profile split, though the two remained legally entangled for years.Khloe and McCants' relationship could be seen as the first on the list after they briefly dated from late 2008 to early 2009.The pair later appeared on KUWTK in late 2009, while Khloe was married to Lamar Odom, where Khloe claimed McCants had cheated on her. But McCants later stated that the entire thing was nothing but a fabricated storyline to keep the show interesting. This highly publicised relationship, as claimed by McCants, “negatively affected” his career and cost him some big bucks.Perhaps the most scrutinized marriage in the family’s history occurred in 2011 when Kim Kardashian married the New Jersey Nets’ forward. The union famously lasted only 72 days before a divorce filing sparked months of tabloid speculation. Though the relationship was brief, it cemented the connection between the league and the Calabasas-based family.During a period of transition, Khloe Kardashian was linked to the prolific scoring guard. Their relationship in 2015 brought a new level of media attention to the Houston Rockets star, who later admitted that the intensity of the public spotlight was a challenge to manage alongside his professional commitments.No relationship on this list has seen more public ups and downs than the one between Khloé and the Cleveland Cavaliers center. Spanning several years and involving the birth of two children, their timeline has been defined by multiple reconciliations and very public controversies, keeping them at the center of the news cycle long after Thompson’s championship run.The family’s interest in the league shifted toward the younger generation when Kendall Jenner began dating the high-flying forward in 2017. The romance rumours sparked shortly after Griffin's split from his ex-fiance, Brynn Cameron. The relationship between Griffin and Kendall only lasted till early 2018, after reported suggested the couple has ""cooled off."" During his transition from the Clippers to the Pistons, the two were a frequent sight at concerts and dinners, representing a shift toward a more private, yet still highly visible, dating style.Continuing the trend of elite guards and forwards, Kendall was later linked to the Philadelphia 76ers standout. Their on-again, off-again relationship was a staple of 2018 and 2019, often highlighted by Kendall’s appearances at the Wells Fargo Center.The most enduring of the recent pairings involved the Phoenix Suns star. Devin Booker and Kendall were an item for over two years, frequently appearing on each other’s social media and attending high-profile events like the U.S. Open. Even after a reported split in late 2022, the couple was spotted together in late 2024 and early 2025, fueling the rumors, and it persisted well into 2025 as they seemed to communicate actively.The most recent addition to the rumor mill of NBA players and Kardashian-Jenner involves the Boston Celtics star, Jaylen Brown. Just barely six days into 2026, reports began to circulate linking him and Kendall Jenner, suggesting that despite her brief pivots toward the music industry, the connection between the supermodel and the NBA’s elite remains as strong as ever.Also read: The 5 highest-paid coaches in NBA right now: Steve Kerr, Mike Brown, and more","The intersection of professional basketball and the kardashian-jenner empire has become one of the most persistent storylines in modern sports media.

Alex Wennberg will allow San Jose Sharks to build their forward line around Macklin Celebrini

Also Read:





With the re-signing of Alex Wennberg, the San Jose Sharks are looking poised to finally build a playoff-caliber team. The Swedish center’s three-year contract extension will allow the management to experiment with what works for them while continuing to have some much-needed veteran presence.Wennberg’s $6 million AAV shows that the Sharks have faith in him. With rookie sensation Macklin Celebrini already breaking records, the team understands that they need playoff experience and consistent production to help a young roster learning how to compete.Wennberg has already established himself as a regular on playoff contenders. He spent six seasons with Columbus, posting at least 30 points three times while contributing to multiple postseason appearances. His time with the expansion Seattle Kraken proved equally productive.He has already helped the franchise reach the second round of the Western Conference playoffs during his second season with the team. The veteran center's playoff pedigree extends to last season, when he joined the New York Rangers.Wennberg helped them secure the President's Trophy and played all 16 postseason games during their run to the Eastern Conference Final.That experience is invaluable for a Sharks team that hasn't tasted playoff hockey in years.So far, Wennberg has met the expectations with which the Sharks welcomed him to their club, with him earning 35 points across 77 regular-season games last season. This season he is continuing to boost the Sharks' points production with 26 points in 41 games, putting him on pace for one of his greatest NHL campaigns.The timing of Wennberg's extension aligns perfectly with the Sharks' rebuild timeline. Logan Couture's contract comes off the books after the 2026-27 season, and other senior deals like those of Jeff Skinner and Ryan Reaves expire this year.That creates financial flexibility for San Jose to make additional roster moves and re-signings over the next few seasons. With Celebrini enjoying a phenomenal sophomore season and the Sharks pushing back into playoff contention, locking up Wennberg provides stability at center ice.The veteran's consistent production and playoff experience will be vital as San Jose's young core matures and learns what it takes to win in high-pressure situations. The extension signals that the Sharks believe their rebuild is progressing ahead of schedule. Wennberg won't just be part of the rebuild anymore. He'll be part of the contending team that emerges on the other side.",Alex wennberg has signed a three-year contract extension with the san jose sharks. The veteran center's $6 million aav shows that the sharks have faith in him. He has already helped the franchise reach the second round of the western conference playoffs during his second season.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126377844,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-51458,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

Why Kenyon Sadiq fits Kansas City’s long-term offensive reset





The Kansas City Chiefs are entering one of the most uncertain offseasons the franchise has faced in years. A 6–11 finish in 2025 not only ended their long playoff streak but also raised uncertainties about the future of the roster’s core leaders. Travis Kelce , who is undoubtedly the face of the offense for over a decade, is nearing the end of his contract and openly weighing what comes next.With Patrick Mahomes rehabbing a major knee injury and possible coaching changes looming, Kansas City is being forced to plan and enforce necessary changes. That planning now appears to include a potential successor at tight end, a position that has defined the Chiefs’ identity during their championship run.Kelce’s impact cannot be overstated, as was seen in this season, despite being a lackluster one. He also etched his name deeper into NFL history by becoming the fastest tight end to reach 13,000 career receiving yards. Still, the retirement speculation has only grown louder, especially with his high-profile relationship and upcoming marriage with Taylor Swift keeping him constantly in the spotlight.Draft experts believe Kansas City must act decisively for their future.Todd McShay of The Ringer recently connected the Chiefs to Oregon tight end Kenyon Sadiq in his early 2026 mock draft. McShay declared ""A lot of retirement news, potentially, about Travis Kelce. Regardless, Kenyon Sadiq, tight end, Oregon. This is going to be a retooled Chiefs next year. Mahomes, get him a difference maker.""Sadiq’s profile makes McShay’s idea compelling. He was a central piece of Oregon’s offense, earning Big Ten Tight End of the Year honors while leading all FBS tight ends in receiving touchdowns. His chemistry with quarterback Dante Moore showcased his ability to thrive against top defenses in competitive, high-intensity games.McShay believes that Sadiq could be the perfect replacement for Kelce and continue being the perfect safety valve for Mahomes. He placed Sadiq in the #9 spot in his 2026 mock draft. Whether Kelce returns or walks away, Kansas City appears determined to stay ahead of the curve, and adding Sadiq would be an intriguing decision.Also read: Travis Kelce reflects on a tough season as retirement questions linger",The kansas city chiefs are entering one of the most uncertain offseasons the franchise has faced in years.

Rather than being inundated with the preview of an NHL match or the rankings of the team, fans were laughing at a relatable view of the daily routine of a professional hockey player.The moment was initiated following a recent Pittsburgh Penguins match, where Rickard Rakell was obviously exhausted as he was on media availability after the game. As the forward discussed the game and the work of the team, his worn-out face soon became the subject of a social media joke made by his wife, Emmeli Rakell. In a sarcastic caption, she had indicated that, though the NHL life was grinding, Rakell still had to go home and do his household duties.The joke resonated with fans on all social platforms, and was rapidly going beyond the confines of the Penguins circles and into the larger NHL updates discussion.Emmeli Rakell would later go on to follow up on the joke by posting a follow-up post of Rickard Rakell washing clothes, and that she was not only teasing around.Instead of getting offended, Rakell seemed to be enjoying the joke and laughing at the attention as well as demonstrating that he feels comfortable with the viral moment.
