Megan Thee Stallion on her relationship with Klay Thompson





Klay Thompson might be known for his calm demeanor on the court, but off it, the Dallas Mavericks star recently showed his softer side. After arriving late to pick up his girlfriend, rapper Megan Thee Stallion , from the airport, Thompson went viral for his heartfelt apology and his remorse. The clip, shared by Megan on social media, captured the NBA star trying to make amends with flowers in hand and genuine regret on his face.The moment quickly became a talking point among fans, who couldn’t get enough of the couple’s chemistry and Thompson’s down-to-earth approach. It also comes at a time when both are thriving in their respective careers, with Thompson beginning his new season in Dallas and Megan releasing new music inspired by their relationship.In the video posted online, Klay Thompson can be seen handing Megan a bouquet while apologizing repeatedly for showing up late. “Roses for my boo,” he said while driving her home. “I’m sorry I was late, babe. Damn it. I’m sorry. I thought I timed it well. Ah, just sorry. There’s no excuse.”Fans immediately flooded social media with amused and affectionate reactions, praising Thompson’s gesture as “adorably human.” The incident added another viral moment to their growing list of public appearances since confirming their romance earlier this year.Over the summer, the couple enjoyed a fishing trip that gave fans a glimpse into their playful dynamic. “So today, Klay is taking me on another adventure and we’re going fishing,” Megan said at the time. Thompson responded lovingly: “I got my queen on board, of course I feel cool. I’m the coolest guy in this harbor!”For Megan, whose real name is Megan Jovon Ruth Pete, the relationship marks a new chapter. “This is my first relationship where I’ve ever been with somebody who’s genuinely a nice person, and he makes me genuinely happy,” she told Page Six.“I just never dated somebody like him before and I’m just grateful that he’s here by my side and he feels the same way about me.”Despite occasional public skepticism — even from personalities like Shaquille O’Neal, who jokingly doubted their relationship on The Big Podcast — fans have embraced the pair’s authenticity. O’Neal later called Megan “athletic, so beautiful, and so gorgeous,” insisting his remarks were lighthearted.For now, Thompson and Megan seem unfazed by outside opinions. Their recent viral moment only serves to extend a genuine connection between two stars from different worlds. The duo has been very active on social media to share their personal moments of joy and love. Megan has over 32.7 million followers on Instagram, while Thomson has 16.8 million fans on the platform.Stallion is fully embracing her lover girl era — and fans are loving it. The three-time Grammy winner took to Instagram to tease a behind-the-scenes look at her new single “Lover Girl,” a song she openly admits is inspired by her boyfriend, NBA star Klay Thompson.“This is my song about Klay,” Megan said in the clip with a shy smile. “First n**** in life that has ever gotten a song outta me.” Fans quickly flooded the comments, cheering for the rapper’s happiness and her growing romance with the four-time NBA champion.Listeners have already picked up on the deeper meaning behind “Lover Girl.” In the track, Megan raps about finding someone who truly matches her energy and confidence. “Ayy, your n**** fantasy, my man reality,” she spits, celebrating a relationship built on mutual respect and balance.The lyrics hint at a future together too, with lines about “making big moves” which is a nod to the couple’s rumored move-in together.Also Read: NBA’s highly anticipated Europe-based league’s potential release date revealed","Klay thompson arrived late to pick up his girlfriend, rapper megan thee stallion, from the airport.

Stephen Curry’s uncertain return keeps the Golden State Warriors fans on edge ahead of Oklahoma City Thunder clash

The Golden State Warriors fans are kind of anxious for tonight's match with the Oklahoma City Thunder. Their main player, Stephen Curry, who was suffering from an illness, was still listed as a probable player in the last game and thus was a concern for the fans.Having just returned from his injury, Curry missed his third consecutive game and the Warriors’ game against the Indiana Pacers due to illness. This happened due to Curry's lingering cold, after returning from an injury. His return may prove to be one of those defining moments at the beginning of the 2025–26 NBA season, as the team currently sits at an even record of 5–5.The Golden State Warriors have been struggling a lot during the time Curry was not there. They have lost their character, the offense has dropped to the lowest point, and even the defense has not been so dependable. A healthy Curry in the lineup could be the one thing this team needs. The coach Steve Kerr was also anxious due to Curry's health.However, thankfully, Steph Curry does not have a serious injury. The 37-year-old's ""lingering cold"" which has ruled him out for three consecutive games does not appear to be gone yet as winter is fast approaching in the US.He is therefore returning for the Oklahoma City Thunders game on November 12.Nevertheless, he had to miss back-to-back games against the Sacramento Kings and Denver Nuggets due to an unexpected illness. According to reports, his health got worse before those games, thus the Warriors' medical staff decided to put his complete recovery ahead of a hasty return.On November 10, the Golden State Warriors made the official announcement of Curry's injury. During Curry's absence, Draymond Green and Brandin Podziemski were the leading players of the Warriors' offense. Despite the fact that the star player of the Warriors has already missed a great deal of time this season, the announcement was still a huge disappointment for both the management and fans alike.Hence, the Warriors had tagged him as questionable heading into the previous match. However, when news broke a couple hours ahead of the game that Curry would miss the match against the Pacers, dreams were shattered.So far, the Golden State Warriors have had Stephen Curry on the court in 8 games during the 2025-26 NBA season, where he has been getting 31.1 minutes on average. However, he has scored a total of 26.8 points per game for the Warriors during this period of time. Tuesday night's game against the Oklahoma City Thunder will be Curry's next opportunity to play.Also read: Stephen Curry receives a blunt message as Golden State Warriors’ momentum suddenly unravels",Golden state warriors star stephen curry has been ruled out for three consecutive games due to an illness.

Jordon Hudson’s “banned” necklace fuels Belichick family tension





More NFL coverage

Things are looking frosty in the Belichick family these days. During North Carolina’s tight 20–15 win over Stanford on Saturday, head coach Bill Belichick’s girlfriend, Jordon Hudson, and his daughter-in-law, Jennifer Schmitt, appeared to keep their distance. The two women attended the game at Chapel Hill but reportedly avoided each other entirely — a scene that didn’t go unnoticed by fans and cameras alike. While Belichick focused on leading his Tar Heels, the off-field drama between Hudson and Schmitt quietly took center stage.Jordon, 24, was seen standing with folded arms in a white tank top and a blue reptile miniskirt, while Jennifer matched the team colors in a white crop top and blue shorts. The chilly atmosphere between them follows their very public online feud earlier this year.The tension dates back months when Jennifer, who’s married to Bill Belichick’s son Stephen, took a jab at Hudson’s behavior during Bill’s interview with CBS' Tony Dokoupil. Jennifer wrote, “Publicists act in a professional manner, and don’t 'storm' off set delaying an interview” — a pointed comment aimed squarely at Jordon.The young model had stepped in during that interview, prompting Bill to later defend her, saying she only intervened after he repeatedly told CBS Mornings producers he wanted to discuss his book, “The Art Of Winning: Lessons from My Life in Football. ”Since then, Jordon Hudson’s presence around UNC football has sparked constant headlines. Despite the Tar Heels’ 4–5 record, her game-day appearances continue to draw more attention than the team’s performance. At Saturday’s game, it was her outfit — especially a necklace featuring one word that seemed to reference her rumored “ban” from UNC facilities — that caught fans’ eyes.Back in May, rumors swirled that Hudson had been banned from team grounds, though the school denied them. Still, her choice of jewelry seemed like a subtle, perhaps petty, response to those claims. Standing on the sideline in stylish white boots, Hudson appeared unbothered and intent on making her presence felt.For now, the Tar Heels are finding their rhythm with two straight wins and another test coming against Wake Forest. But even as Bill Belichick brings his winning touch to Chapel Hill, it’s clear that the family drama off the field isn’t cooling down anytime soon.","Bill belichick’s girlfriend, jordon hudson, and his daughter-in-law, jennifer schmitt, appeared to keep their distance.

Remembering Marshawn Kneeland: Family and friends honor his life beyond the game

Tributes to Marshawn Kneeland continue from Dallas Stars, NFL and other sports figures

More coverage in NFL:

The NFL world is mourning the heartbreaking loss of Dallas Cowboys defensive end Marshawn Kneeland, who passed away at just 24. A rising star known for his relentless energy and bright smile, Kneeland’s sudden death has left a deep void across the football community. Beyond his growing success on the field, he was loved for his humility, warmth, and the quiet strength that defined him as both a player and a person.His passing came just days after a standout performance against the Arizona Cardinals, where he scored his first NFL touchdown on a blocked punt recovery. The moment captured his talent and determination, yet behind that triumph was a young man silently struggling. His tragic death has reignited an urgent conversation across professional sports about mental health and the emotional toll of life in the spotlight.Those closest to Kneeland describe him as more than just a football player, he was a gentle soul who carried warmth and humility into every room. His grandmother affectionately called him her “baby giant,” a nickname that beautifully captured the contrast between his imposing size and his tender heart.His cousin, Nicole Kneeland-Woods, shared an emotional reflection on the kind of person he was. “He was physically a big guy, but he was the most kindhearted, caring, just generous, loving person that you'd ever meet,” she told ESPN.“We always knew he was going to be something because he was different, focused. He knew what he wanted.”Kneeland faced unimaginable personal loss before reaching his dream, losing both his grandfather and his mother within a short span. Yet those who knew him say he carried himself with quiet strength, using their memories as motivation rather than despair. His family believes that resilience defined him as much as his athletic talent.Kneeland’s agent, Jon Perzley, was among the last people to speak to him. Perzley told ESPN that Kneeland had been in good spirits during their final conversation, focused on improving and continuing to grow as a player. He declined to share further details of their last exchange because of the ongoing investigation but confirmed that Kneeland told him he loved him.“He just had this charm about him that was so pure and honest. I don't think there's a person who crossed paths with him who had a bad thing to say,” Perzley said. “On the outside you go, he checks every box that exists, and so I think that's why it's really hard for people right now. It's hard to understand it. Really hard.”From Dallas to Western Michigan, Kneeland’s teammates shared stories that reflect his lasting impact. Andre Carter, who played alongside him in college, called Kneeland’s energy “infectious.” He said, It's an understatement to say how great his energy [was] and just how much he was needed in that room.”Western Michigan defensive lineman Hozey Haji-Badri, one of Kneeland’s closest friends, said he leaned on him for support after transferring from East Carolina. Kneeland picked him up before practice and took him out to eat afterward, helping him settle into the team. “He really got me acclimated,” Haji-Badri said. “And for that, I’ll never forget.” The two bonded over their shared love of food, from barbecue to Thai, and built a friendship that went far beyond football.Kneeland’s passing is a devastating reminder that success on the field doesn’t always reflect what’s happening inside. His life and untimely death have become a powerful call for empathy and mental health awareness across professional sports. The Dallas Cowboys organization, his teammates, and fans across the country continue to honor his memory, not just as a talented player, but as a compassionate young man who left an indelible mark on everyone who knew him. Marshawn Kneeland’s legacy will live on as a reminder of resilience, kindness, and the importance of reaching out before it’s too late.",Dallas cowboys defensive end marshawn kneeland died at just 24.

Fans expecting to see Caitlin Clark light up the court will instead find her on the golf course this week, but with an unexpected twist. The Indiana Fever superstar is set to participate in The Annika LPGA Pro-Am in Florida on November 12, marking her second consecutive appearance at the celebrity event. Yet what has everyone talking is her choice of caddie, teammate Sophie Cunningham, who plans to bring more laughter than golf expertise.Cunningham, known for her competitive edge and bold humor, made it clear that she is taking her new role lightly. She once misspelled the golfer’s warning “Fore!” as “Four!” on Instagram, a mistake that Caitlin Clark herself corrected. That small mix-up told fans everything they needed to know about Cunningham’s golf background. Even so, her energy and humor guarantee that this pairing will be one of the most entertaining of the tournament.During a recent episode of her Show Me Something podcast, Sophie Cunningham revealed her unconventional approach to caddying. “Hopefully they’re not too serious, because I’ll get kicked out of the group,” she said with a laugh.When co-host West Wilson reminded her that her job as a caddie is to keep the mood light, she replied, “Yeah, and I also found out that I don’t have to carry any [golf] bags.So I’m gonna be carrying a lot of beers.”When Wilson joked about rowdy spectators at the event, Cunningham quickly fired back, “Well, there will be a drunk female yelling back at them. Me.” That remark summed up her entire attitude toward the day ahead. She may not know every golf term, but she is determined to bring entertainment and good vibes.Clark will be joined by teammates Lexie Hull and Sophie Cunningham, both serving as celebrity caddies during the event. According to NBC Sports, the Golf Channel will provide live coverage of Clark’s round, which means fans can expect plenty of memorable moments between the trio.While Clark focuses on her swing and competitive edge, Cunningham’s carefree spirit will keep things light on the course. If Sophie Cunningham keeps her word, spectators may witness the most amusing caddie performance in LPGA Pro-Am history.Also Read: Is Jalen Green alright?

The Dallas Cowboys are finding ways to cope with the devastating loss of defensive end Marshawn Kneeland, who died on November 6 at the age of 24. Cowboys owner and general manager Jerry Jones broke his silence about the tragedy during an interview with Dallas-Fort Worth’s 105.3 The Fan, revealing emotional plans to honor Kneeland’s memory.The news has shaken the entire Cowboys community, leaving teammates and fans struggling to comprehend the loss of a young player who was only beginning his NFL journey.Jerry Jones confirmed that Cowboys players will wear a special decal on their helmets for the rest of the NFL season in memory of Kneeland. The design is still being finalized, but the gesture reflects how deeply the team wants to keep his spirit close. During Monday Night Football against the Las Vegas Raiders on November 17, players will also wear t-shirts honoring Kneeland during warm-ups. The tribute will continue when the Cowboys return home to AT&T Stadium to face the Philadelphia Eagles on November 23-- their first home game since Kneeland’s death, which Jones said left them “devastated. ”“Just hard to believe the content that was on the other phone in the middle of the night when we all got the news,” Jones told 105.3 The Fan, his voice heavy with emotion.Authorities found Kneeland’s body in Frisco with an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound, just hours after a police chase. According to dispatch audio obtained by PEOPLE, his family had received “a group text from him saying goodbye” shortly before his death.Jones spoke about the intense pressures NFL players face, both on and off the field. “Everybody evaluates everybody, it's the nature of it. You're under an evaluation almost from the time you get up until you go to bed,” he said, reflecting on the mental strain that often remains unseen. “No one gets more attention, no one gets any more scrutiny, no one gets any more critiquing than these guys that play this game... He lived that life every day. ”Remembering Kneeland, Jones added, “He was very unique in his zest for life… He was very unique in his passion for the game.” His words carried a deep sense of loss for a player who, as Jones said, “was just getting started.”The Cowboys held a team meeting led by head coach Brian Schottenheimer and psychologist Heather Twedell to help players process the tragedy. The team also leaned on The Defensive Line Foundation, an organization that supports individuals and families facing mental health crises.Through every tribute and conversation, one thing is clear -- Marshawn Kneeland’s spirit will remain a part of the Cowboys family forever.","Jerry jones reveals how the dallas cowboys will honor marshawn kneeland after his tragic death.

Bahraini woman reaches Captain status

Who is Captain Fatima Nabeel Al Qaood?

Why does the A380 matter?

Bahraini women in aviation

Inspiration for the next generation





For the Kingdom of Bahrain, the year marks a soaring new chapter in its history books. Captain Fatima Nabeel Al Qaood has landed an unprecedented achievement, becoming the nation's first female Captain to command the majestic Airbus A380. Taking the controls of the world's largest passenger aircraft, Captain Al Qaood has not only validated her own mastery of complex flight technology but has also symbolically lifted her entire country onto a global stage, demonstrating Bahrain's commitment to nurturing pioneering female leadership in one of the most demanding professions on Earth.The skies have a new commander, and she hails from the Kingdom of Bahrain. Captain Fatima Nabeel Al Qaood has officially achieved the ultimate dream of commercial pilots: the prestigious rank of Captain. What makes this an extraordinary milestone is the aircraft she commands—the colossal Airbus A380. Captain Al Qaood is the first woman from Bahrain to reach this elite status while piloting the world’s largest commercial passenger jet.This achievement follows a rigorous and demanding journey.Reaching Captain status requires accumulating thousands of flight hours, passing complex technical examinations, and demonstrating flawless command ability—skills proven by Captain Al Qaood on one of the most sophisticated machines ever built.Captain Fatima Nabeel Al Qaood's historic ascent to the command seat of the Airbus A380 is a defining moment for Bahrain and the Arab world, marking a major triumph for women in professional aviation. As a proud Bahraini national, her achievement is uniquely significant because she is the first woman from the Kingdom to achieve the rank of Captain while piloting the colossal A380, the world's largest commercial aircraft. While other pioneering women, such as Captain Yasmeen Fraidoon, previously broke the barrier by becoming Bahrain's first female Captains on smaller fleet aircraft, Captain Al Qaood has taken that legacy to the ultimate level of complexity and scale.Her success is the culmination of years of rigorous, demanding technical training and thousands of hours in the sky, positioning her not merely as a skilled pilot, but as a global symbol of the ambitious, highly-trained female workforce that is shattering traditional ceilings throughout the modern Gulf region.To truly grasp the scale of Captain Al Qaood’s achievement, one must understand the significance of the Airbus A380, often nicknamed the ""Superjumbo."" It represents the pinnacle of commercial aviation engineering, and commanding it is a globally recognized feat of skill.The A380 is a double-decker giant that demands exceptional expertise:Unmatched Scale: It is the largest passenger plane in operation, weighing nearly 600 tonnes at takeoff and carrying over 500 passengers.Technical Mastery: Its complex systems require a Captain who possesses not only piloting skills but also superior crew resource management and emergency procedure expertise.The Elite Few: The number of pilots, particularly women, qualified to command this massive aircraft is incredibly small, placing Captain Al Qaood in an elite global cohort of aviators.Her position is a powerful testament to her technical precision and ability to lead a crew responsible for hundreds of lives.Captain Fatima Nabeel Al Qaood’s achievement is the latest in a line of groundbreaking firsts for Bahraini women in the air, showing a consistent national commitment to female empowerment in the aviation sector.First Captains: Captain Al Qaood follows in the footsteps of pioneers like Captain Yasmeen Fraidoon, who became Gulf Air's first female Bahraini Captain on the national carrier's fleet (Airbus A320s/A330s). Captain Al Qaood's achievement extends this legacy to the A380.Military Milestones: In 2018, Sheikha Aisha bint Rashid Al Khalifa made history as the Kingdom's first female fighter pilot, flying a BAE Hawk.Engineering Excellence: Pioneering women like Hend Al Awadhi were the first female aircraft engineers, ensuring the safety of the fleet from the ground up.Captain Al Qaood’s command of the A380 is a symbol that the glass ceiling for women in the Gulf is not just cracked—it’s been completely shattered at the cruising altitude of 43,000 feet.Captain Al Qaood’s success is a direct, visible call to action for young women across the Middle East. Her journey is proof that dedication, passion, and rigorous training open doors to the most challenging and rewarding careers, regardless of background.By taking the ultimate seat on the ultimate jet, she has provided a powerful narrative: the complex technical fields of science and aviation are fully accessible. Her legacy, flying the world’s largest commercial aircraft, serves as a beacon of possibility, ensuring that the future of aviation is increasingly diverse and female-led.","Captain fatima nabeel al qaood is the first woman from bahrain to reach this elite status while piloting the world’s largest commercial passenger jet.

Pat Murphy’s back-to-back win writes a new chapter in baseball's long history of managerial greatness

Milwaukee Brewers manager Pat Murphy has created history by winning the 2025 National League Manager of the Year, becoming the first to claim the honor in consecutive seasons since Bobby Cox’s Atlanta Braves era in 2004 and 2005. The 66-year-old skipper’s latest triumph not only marks a personal milestone but also highlights the Brewers’ transformation into one of the most consistent and disciplined teams in the league. Murphy’s achievement is both rare and defining, placing him in the same breath as the legendary managers who shaped baseball’s modern era.Murphy’s journey with Milwaukee has been defined by belief and balance. After taking over from Craig Counsell, many predicted a rebuilding phase for the Brewers. Instead, Murphy turned skepticism into success, crafting a team built on adaptability, sharp game instincts, and strong clubhouse chemistry. His leadership style blends modern analytical precision with the emotional intelligence of an old-school baseball mind. “He’s not just managing games, he’s managing people,” one player said earlier this season, capturing the essence of Murphy’s impact. His consecutive Manager of the Year honors affirm that leadership in today’s game goes beyond tactics — it’s about creating trust and resilience that lasts through every inning.Pat Murphy now stands alongside some of baseball’s most respected figures, joining a legacy built by names like Bobby Cox, Dusty Baker Jr., Tony La Russa, Joe Maddon, and Buck Showalter. His back-to-back success places him among the few who have managed to sustain excellence across multiple seasons. Since the award’s inception, these names have represented the standard of strategic brilliance and team leadership that defined their eras.A look at the legendary names who've shaped the National League Manager of the Year legacy:2024 – Pat Murphy (Milwaukee)2023 – Skip Schumaker (Miami)2022 – Buck Showalter (NY Mets)2021 – Gabe Kapler (San Francisco)2020 – Don Mattingly (Miami)2019 – Mike Shildt (St. Louis)2018 – Brian Snitker (Atlanta)2017 – Torey Lovullo (Arizona)2016 – Dave Roberts (LA Dodgers)2015 – Joe Maddon (Chi Cubs)2014 – Matt Williams (Washington)2013 – Clint Hurdle (Pittsburgh)2012 – Davey Johnson (Washington)2011 – Kirk Gibson (Arizona)2010 – Bud Black (San Diego)2009 – Jim Tracy (Colorado)2008 – Lou Piniella (Chi Cubs)2007 – Bob Melvin (Arizona)2006 – Joe Girardi (Florida)2005 & 2004 – Bobby Cox (Atlanta)Under Murphy, the Brewers have built their success around strategy, depth, and connection. Without relying on star-heavy rosters, Milwaukee’s consistency has come from its culture of adaptability — a reflection of its manager’s steady influence. His approach to managing pressure, trusting younger players, and fine-tuning rotations has kept the team competitive even against higher payrolls.Murphy’s 2025 victory is more than a personal achievement. It’s a symbol of a manager redefining what success looks like in today’s National League — one built on balance, communication, and faith in the collective. As Milwaukee continues its rise, Pat Murphy’s back-to-back titles aren’t just part of the record books. They are the start of a new chapter in baseball leadership, one that future managers will look up to as the blueprint for sustained excellence.Also read: Fans can’t stop talking about Shohei Ohtani’s heartfelt Dodger Stadium moment with his dog","Milwaukee brewers manager pat murphy has won the national league manager of the year award for the second year in a row.

When can Jaguars expect Travis Hunter to return from his knee injury?



More NFL coverage

The Jacksonville Jaguars have taken a major hit as rookie sensation Travis Hunter is officially ruled out for the rest of the 2025 season. The team’s second-overall pick, who had been electrifying both sides of the ball, suffered a knee injury during practice in late October, dealing a crushing blow to Jacksonville’s playoff hopes. Initially placed on injured reserve with hopes of a late-season return, the situation took a sharp turn this week when it was confirmed that Hunter had undergone season-ending surgery.On Tuesday, NFL insider Adam Schefter shared the grim update on X, writing, “Travis Hunter underwent surgery today to repair his LCL which will sideline him for the remainder of the season. There was no additional damage beyond his LCL. The procedure was done by Dr. Cooper and Dr. Kaplan in Dallas. He’s expected to return to full football activities within six months.” That timeline gives fans hope that their dual-threat rookie will be back to full strength by the offseason.Based on Schefter’s report and the team’s official update, Hunter’s recovery window puts him on track to resume full football activities by mid-May 2026. This means he should be ready in time for Jacksonville’s training camp next summer.Fortunately, doctors confirmed there was no structural damage beyond the LCL, which significantly boosts his chances for a complete recovery.Before the injury, Hunter was showcasing exactly why he was one of the most hyped prospects entering the league. In just seven games, the 22-year-old proved his versatility—catching 28 passes for 298 yards and a touchdown on offense while making 15 tackles and breaking up three passes on defense. His ability to perform as both a receiver and cornerback made him an invaluable part of the Jaguars’ system.The Jaguars currently sit at 5–4, clinging to the AFC’s final Wild Card spot. However, losing a player of Hunter’s caliber could impact their playoff push significantly. Still, the long-term outlook remains optimistic. If recovery stays on course, Hunter’s full return next season could mark the start of an even more dominant era for Jacksonville’s rising star.",Jaguars rookie travis hunter ruled out for season.

The Edmonton Oilers needed something special on Monday night, and Connor McDavid delivered exactly that. With the team down late in the third period, McDavid’s sheer will and brilliance lifted Edmonton to a stunning 5-4 overtime win over the Columbus Blue Jackets at Rogers Place. It wasn’t just another comeback. It was the kind of performance that reminded everyone why McDavid is considered one of the best in the game -- a player who refuses to let his team go quietly.The Oilers, coming off a humbling 9-1 defeat to Colorado, entered this game under pressure to prove themselves. The fans were restless, and McDavid made sure their frustration didn’t go unanswered. “We hear it,” McDavid said. “We understand what happened on Saturday was not what we want to display to our fans. We’re all trying to win games, and we did that tonight.”Down 4-2 in the third period, McDavid took control. Less than a minute into the frame, he danced past Denton Mateychuk, cut across the crease, and lifted a backhand past Jet Greaves. Later, he struck again, slicing the deficit to one and reigniting belief on the bench and in the stands. His pair of goals sparked the Oilers’ rally, keeping his personal scoring streak alive at five games, with four goals and six assists in that span.“The group likes to put itself in a tough spot and just when you think it’s a tough spot, we go a little bit further,” McDavid admitted, according to NHL.com. “Then we decide it’s time to go. We stuck with it. We put ourselves in a tough spot, but we’re good at coming from behind.”With just 58 seconds left in regulation, Jake Walman’s shot deflected off Zach Werenski to tie the game, and Jack Roslovic sealed the win 56 seconds into overtime.“Connor wasn’t going to let us lose tonight, he was so focused on getting the job done,” coach Kris Knoblauch said. “He had an incredible night, two fabulous goals, but there was just so much determination to his game.”McDavid’s rallying cry of “enough is enough” after the Avalanche loss now rings louder than ever.

Before batting, head coach Gautam Gambhir and assistant coach Sitanshu Kotak spoke with him near the High Court end, news agency PTI reported.

He then moved to pace bowling, facing Nitish Kumar Reddy and a few local bowlers. A support staff member used a sidearm for throwdowns from a higher release point to give more bounce and pace. After that, Gill shifted to the central pitch for about 30 minutes of throwdowns with bowling coach Morne Morkel also bowling to him.Yashasvi Jaiswal, coming off scores of 67 and 156 for Mumbai in the Ranji Trophy match against Rajasthan, also had a long session on the central wicket, where he faced Morkel and throwdowns and played drives and pulls.Sai Sudharsan also batted for a long period. He scored 84 runs in two unofficial Tests for India A against South Africa A. The team management continues to try him at No. 3. In Tests, though, he is yet to make it his own, with only a 61 against England in Manchester and 87 versus West Indies at home to show so far in Tests.Among the fast bowlers, only Jasprit Bumrah bowled. He kept his workload light, bowling at two stumps for around 15 minutes and targeting the off stump.South Africa also trained on Tuesday after arriving from their hard-earned 1-1 draw against Pakistan in Rawalpindi.With captain Temba Bavuma fit and back to lead the side for the first time since the World Test Championship final win in June, South Africa held a training session with the full squad.
