The men’s game glittered with contracts and cameras, while the women’s team still lived in the half-light.And then came the present —— women who carried the strength of two generations within. Jemimah, dropped from the match against England, returned to script history against Australia.

:

In Pittsburgh, the question surrounding Sidney Crosby’s future has been gaining momentum. Fans and analysts have speculated whether the Penguins’ captain might end his career elsewhere or if his incredible legacy will remain tied to the Steel City. Penguins GM Kyle Dubas has finally addressed it, making it clear that there’s no room for doubt about his commitment—or Crosby’s.The 39-year-old executive, who also shoulders responsibilities with Team Canada’s Olympic roster, has made one thing certain: his plan for Crosby and the Penguins isn’t changing anytime soon. His goal remains focused on building a team capable of contending while keeping its core intact, both for today and tomorrow.Speaking to The Athletic, GM Kyle Dubas shared rare insights into his approach to keeping Sidney Crosby’s future in Pittsburgh aligned with the team’s larger vision. He emphasized the importance of communication and trust, explaining how he keeps both Crosby and his agent, Pat Brisson, informed of every move. “Our goal is not so different,” Dubas said of the 38-year-old captain. “Every day, we're trying to get better.We're trying to put ourselves in a position to win every single day. And I think that's been what we really set out to do from the spring to the summer through the fall.”Dubas acknowledged that results might not always be immediately visible, but his philosophy remains steady. “I communicate that with Sid and with Pat, and I just don't think we can veer from it if we're going to deliver for him a team that can contend while he's still at this level, while he's still playing,” he said. The GM praised Crosby’s character and dedication, noting how his leadership continues to define the Penguins’ culture.He also credited the rest of the leadership core—Evgeni Malkin, Kris Letang, Bryan Rust, Erik Karlsson, and Rickard Rakell—for maintaining that championship mindset. “That in itself is probably the most important part of bringing the team back to that point (contention),” Dubas added.As for what comes next, Dubas isn’t rushing into decisions about Crosby’s long-term future. With two years left on his contract, he believes the best path forward is simple: keep winning. “No, I would never,” he said when asked about trading or disrupting the core. “He's got two years, this year and next year, on his contract. And I just think that if we continue to take the right steps and we continue to win, that's the great solution to everything in sports. Just have to win.”For Kyle Dubas, success on the ice remains the answer to everything—including ensuring that Sidney Crosby’s story in Pittsburgh continues exactly where it began.",Penguins gm kyle dubas reveals his plan for sidney crosby’s future in pittsburgh.

Seattle Mariners catcher Cal Raleigh shared a deeply emotional post for his teammate Logan Gilbert after the pitcher and his wife Aviles welcomed their first child earlier this week.

Hornets Facing Depth Issues Amid Multiple Injuries

Tough Test Against the Short-Handed Heat

The’ hopes of turning their season around took another hit ahead of their November 7, 2025 matchup against the Miami Heat, as star point guardwas officially ruled out due to a right ankle impingement. This marks at least the third consecutive game Ball has missed, continuing a frustrating stretch that dates back to last season. Despite undergoing offseason surgery meant to stabilize the ankle, the lingering discomfort has resurfaced, raising concerns about his long-term durability and recovery timeline.For the Charlotte Hornets, Ball’s absence couldn’t come at a worse time. The team has struggled to find consistent rhythm on both ends of the floor, and losing their offensive engine only deepens the challenge. Ball’s unique blend of playmaking flair, scoring, and leadership has been the foundation of Charlotte’s attack since his arrival in the league. Without him, the Hornets’ offensive flow and tempo take a noticeable hit, forcing secondary players to assume bigger roles under difficult circumstances.LaMelo Ball’s ankle injury remains a recurring concern that has carried over from previous seasons. Even after undergoing surgery in the summer to correct the problem, he continues to experience setbacks. The Charlotte Hornets have listed him as doubtful and later marked him questionable for the Miami clash, but ultimately, medical staff decided to keep him sidelined for precautionary reasons.As of now, there is no clear timetable for his return, which has left both fans and analysts uncertain about when the young star will take the court again.Before the injury, LaMelo Ball was performing at an elite level, averaging 23.3 points, 7.8 rebounds, and 9.8 assists per game. Those numbers highlight how essential he is to Charlotte’s offensive system, often serving as both the primary scorer and playmaker. His ability to control the pace, create open looks for teammates, and score efficiently made him the heartbeat of the Charlotte Hornets’ offense.LaMelo Ball isn’t the only Hornets player unavailable for the Heat matchup. Charlotte’s injury report is stacked with key names, including Brandon Miller (shoulder injury), Collin Sexton (neck strain), Josh Green (shoulder surgery), and Grant Williams (knee surgery). These absences have stretched the Charlotte Hornets’ depth thin, forcing coach Steve Clifford to experiment with lineups and rotations.In Ball’s absence, the offensive duties fall primarily on guards like Tre Mann and Collin Sexton - when healthy - to facilitate plays and create scoring opportunities. However, without their lead playmaker, Charlotte’s ball movement and spacing have often suffered, resulting in inconsistent offensive performances.The Miami Heat are also missing key players, with Bam Adebayo and Tyler Herro sidelined due to injuries. Still, Miami’s defensive discipline and veteran leadership make them a tough opponent, especially for a Hornets squad lacking cohesion. Without Ball’s vision and creativity, Charlotte’s scoring options are limited, and the pressure mounts on role players to deliver.Also read: Charlotte Hornets vs Miami Heat regular season game: Full injury report, who's out, and more (November 7, 2025) As the Charlotte Hornets prepare for the matchup, the uncertainty surrounding LaMelo Ball’s recovery continues to cast a shadow over their early-season ambitions.

Fans remain hopeful that their young star will recover soon, but the current outlook remains cautiously pessimistic as the team navigates another stretch without its leader on the court.","Charlotte hornets star point guard lamelo ball has been ruled out due to a right ankle impingement.

Richie Adubato’s cause of death



Dick Vitale mourns longtime friend and fellow “Jersey Boy”



The basketball world is mourning the loss of Richie Adubato, a respected figure whose career spanned decades across the NBA , WNBA, and broadcasting. The former Orlando Magic coach and longtime radio analyst passed away Thursday at the age of 87, his family confirmed on social media Friday. Known for his quick wit, deep knowledge of the game, and passion for teaching, Adubato’s impact reached far beyond the sidelines.Across his six-decade career, Adubato earned a reputation as one of basketball’s most genuine and energetic minds. From guiding NBA locker rooms to mentoring WNBA players and entertaining fans behind the mic, he brought an infectious enthusiasm to everything he did. His passing leaves a significant void in the sport, especially among those who witnessed his kindness and humor firsthand.The cause of death of Richie Adubato has not been revealed as of yet. It is possible that the former Magic coach passed away due to old age. The Orlando Magic organization was among the first to pay tribute to the late coach. “The DeVos family and the Orlando Magic are saddened to learn of the passing of Richie Adubato,” the team said in a statement. “Richie’s legacy lives on in every story and lesson he shared — a coach who turned the gym into a place of connection and joy, impacting countless lives with warmth, humor, and unforgettable spirit.Our thoughts and prayers are with his wife, Carol, and the entire Adubato family.”Adubato joined the Magic as an assistant coach in 1994 before stepping in as interim head coach in 1997. He later became a fan favorite as the team’s radio analyst from 2005 to 2020, where his insights and storytelling became part of the franchise’s identity.Before his Magic tenure, Adubato coached the Detroit Pistons, New York Knicks, Dallas Mavericks, and Cleveland Cavaliers, as well as WNBA teams like the New York Liberty and Washington Mystics. His career path reflected his lifelong dedication to the game — from high school gyms in New Jersey to professional arenas across the country.Among those deeply affected by his passing was ESPN legend Dick Vitale, who shared a heartfelt tribute online. “Today my dear friend RICHIE ADUBATO passed away. Richie was one of our ‘JERSEY BOYS’ along with @MikeFratello Hubie Brown & yours truly who all chased dreams in coaching. Richie coached on every level – HS -College- @NBA. He’ll be missed but never forgotten. May Richie RIP!” Vitale wrote on X.The two shared a bond that stretched back to their New Jersey coaching roots in the 1960s. When Vitale joined the Detroit Pistons, he brought Adubato on as an assistant, marking the start of a friendship grounded in mutual respect and love for basketball.Also Read: Megan Thee Stallion receives heartfelt apology from boyfriend Klay Thompson after airport pickup mishap","Richie adubato passed away thursday at the age of 87, his family confirmed on social media.

The Denver Broncos might have scraped by with a narrow 10-7 victory over the Las Vegas Raiders, but the win didn’t come without its share of drama. Bo Nix, the star quarterback leading Denver’s charge this season, found himself at the center of attention for all the wrong reasons. Struggling through a rough outing, Nix completed just 16 of 28 passes for 150 yards, one touchdown, and two interceptions while losing yardage on the ground. As frustration built in the Mile High crowd, boos echoed through the stadium. Still, the young quarterback took it in stride, saying afterward, “I’ve been booed before. I’ll be booed again.”While Nix weathered criticism on the field, his wife, Izzy Nix, was the real star off it. On Friday, Izzy posted photos with her husband where her massive wedding ring caught the spotlight—literally shining as brightly as her support for Bo. Her post, both radiant and defiant, subtly reminded fans that behind every quarterback under pressure, there’s often someone quietly cheering them on. Despite the rough night, the Broncos are now 8-2 and comfortably sitting atop the AFC West. As the saying goes, winning cures everything in the NFL Izzy Nix, born on October 18, 1998, in Birmingham, Alabama, grew up with three siblings—Millie, Abbie, and Luke. A lifelong athlete, she spent 14 years as a gymnast before turning her energy toward cheerleading and basketball at Evangel Christian School. At Auburn University, fate intervened when she met Bo Nix, then the Tigers’ quarterback. “This guy is a true blessing lemme tell ya!!!! one year of knowing him and everyday gets sweeter 🤍,” Izzy wrote in 2021, capturing the essence of their budding romance.The couple’s story blossomed quickly. Bo proposed at Auburn’s Jordan-Hare Stadium in 2021, writing, “I knew from the first moment I laid eyes on you that you were special... I cannot wait to be your husband.” They tied the knot in a heartfelt Alabama ceremony the following year. Today, as they await their first child, Izzy continues to be Bo’s biggest cheerleader.Even when the crowd turns on her husband, Izzy’s light doesn’t dim—it only shines brighter.","Denver broncos quarterback bo nix was booed during a game against the las vegas raiders.

Jayden Daniels could return this season after elbow injury scare



More NFL coverage

Washington Commanders fans finally got a reason to breathe easier on Friday. Star quarterback Jayden Daniels received encouraging news regarding his left elbow injury that had caused widespread concern earlier in the week. Head coach Dan Quinn confirmed that Daniels will not require surgery after an MRI revealed no ligament damage. “It’ll knock him out for a while,” Quinn said, but crucially, the team will not be placing Daniels on injured reserve. That decision keeps the door open for a possible return later this season — a glimmer of hope for a struggling 3-6 Commanders team.Daniels, reportedly “feeling a little sore,” suffered the injury during last Sunday’s 37-6 loss to the Seattle Seahawks. Late in the fourth quarter, while still fighting to make plays despite the lopsided score, he was spun around on a tackle and landed awkwardly on his non-throwing arm. The sight of teammates surrounding him as trainers applied a temporary cast painted a grim picture. But after multiple medical evaluations, the outlook has turned unexpectedly positive. The Commanders will re-evaluate Daniels after their Week 12 bye, suggesting he could see action again this year.For the Commanders, this update is more than a health report — it’s a lifeline. Losing Daniels long-term would have been a devastating blow to a team already fighting to regain its footing after a slow start. The reigning NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year has faced his share of setbacks this season, including earlier knee and hamstring issues, but his impact when healthy is undeniable. Washington went 12-5 last year with Daniels at the helm, a stark contrast to this season’s 3-6 record.Backup Marcus Mariota has stepped in admirably, going 1-2 as a starter, but the offense clearly misses Daniels’ dual-threat ability and leadership. With upcoming games against the Lions and Dolphins before the bye, Washington hopes to stay within striking distance of the playoff race. Even though their postseason chances appear slim, the potential return of Daniels could inject fresh energy into a weary locker room.For now, the Commanders are counting small victories — and keeping faith that Jayden Daniels, the heart of their offense, might yet script another comeback before the season ends.","Washington commanders quarterback jayden daniels suffered an elbow injury last sunday.

Filip Hallander’s blood clot diagnosis shocks Penguins fans



More NHL coverage

The Pittsburgh Penguins have been flying high to start the 2025–26 season, but the team’s momentum hit a painful bump with unsettling news surrounding forward Filip Hallander. The 25-year-old winger, who had finally begun carving out a steady NHL role, has been diagnosed with a blood clot that will keep him off the ice for at least three months. The organization confirmed that Hallander will undergo rehabilitation in Pittsburgh, working closely with the Penguins’ medical staff and doctors from the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center to ensure a full recovery.The timing couldn’t be worse for Hallander. After years of bouncing between Sweden and the AHL, he had secured his place on the Penguins’ active roster, appearing in 13 games this season—already the most in his NHL career. During that stretch, he registered one goal and three assists, showing steady growth as a bottom-six forward. His two-way game, energy, and resilience had begun earning him praise from fans and teammates alike. Now, his progress faces an unexpected pause.According to the team, Hallander’s blood clot was discovered following a practice session earlier this week. He had participated in Monday’s matchup against the Toronto Maple Leafs and was seen practicing on Wednesday but left early, raising concern.Initially, head coach Dan Muse labeled him as “day-to-day with an undisclosed issue,” but further tests confirmed the serious diagnosis. The Penguins later revealed that Hallander would be sidelined “for a minimum of three months,” a timeline that could extend depending on his recovery.The setback means Hallander could miss action until after the Olympic break in Italy, cutting short what was shaping up to be a breakthrough campaign. A second-round pick in 2018, Hallander had returned to Pittsburgh this season after two strong years with Timra IK in Sweden, hoping to solidify his NHL future.For the Penguins, this injury adds to a growing list of absences that threaten to test their depth. Yet, there’s optimism that once Hallander fully recovers, he can resume his upward trajectory. With the medical care he’s receiving and his determination to return stronger, Hallander remains very much a name to watch in Pittsburgh’s future.",Pittsburgh penguins forward filip hallander has been diagnosed with a blood clot.

Theare set to face off on November 7, 2025, in a game that’s already being shaped by crucial injuries and lineup adjustments. Both teams will enter the night without key contributors, forcing coaches to dig deep into their rotations and rely on secondary players to carry the load. Despite the setbacks, the upcoming matchup promises to be an intriguing Eastern Conference contest, blending adversity, opportunity, and rising talent in equal measure.The absence of star power hasn’t dimmed the excitement, as fans eagerly await to see who will step up under the spotlight. Boston’s focus will be on maintaining offensive rhythm without their primary scorer, while Orlando will aim to exploit the Celtics’ weakened frontcourt. With both squads navigating thin rosters, the stage is set for an unpredictable and hard-fought game that will test each team’s adaptability and resilience.The Boston Celtics are hit hard by injuries and absences, headlined by Jayson Tatum’s unavailability due to a right Achilles repair. His absence strips Boston of its leading scorer and on-court leader, creating a significant void in their offense.

The lone absence is big man Moritz “Moe” Wagner, sidelined as he continues recovering from a left knee injury. While the Magic are largely healthy, Wagner’s absence could force them to reconfigure their interior rotation, giving Wendell Carter Jr. a heavier workload and creating space for younger players to earn key minutes.• Moritz Wagner (Left Knee Injury Recovery): OUTFranz Wagner, Desmond Bane, and Jalen Suggs are expected to pick up the offensive slack, forming a strong supporting trio around Paolo Banchero to challenge Boston’s depleted lineup.Boston’s game plan will likely revolve around Brown’s offense, with Pritchard and White seeking consistency from deep.

Thereceived a huge boost ahead of their NBA Cup matchup against the Chicago Bulls on November 7, 2025, as superstar. This update comes as a relief for Bucks fans who were concerned after the Greek Freak dealt with left knee soreness in recent days. With his name officially removed from the injury list, Giannis is set to lead Milwaukee in a must-win clash against a red-hot Bulls team that currently sits atop the Eastern Conference with a 6-1 record.This game is shaping up to be one of the standout fixtures of the NBA Cup group stage, featuring two franchises with contrasting trajectories. The Bucks are looking to regain momentum after a recent loss to the Toronto Raptors, while the Bulls have been one of the league’s early-season surprises, combining solid defense with balanced scoring. Having Giannis back on the floor gives Milwaukee the competitive edge they need to keep pace with their conference rivals.Giannis Antetokounmpo has been nothing short of dominant this season, averaging 32.3 points, 12.6 rebounds, and 6.3 assists per game. His performance continues to solidify his reputation as one of the most impactful players in the NBA. The Milwaukee Bucks will rely heavily on his leadership and all-around game, especially considering their current injury situation.Despite the good news surrounding Giannis, the Bucks will be missing other key contributors. Kevin Porter Jr. is out after undergoing surgery on his right knee, and Taurean Prince remains sidelined with a neck strain. These absences could shorten Milwaukee’s rotation, making Giannis Antetokounmpo’s presence even more vital to the team’s success.The Chicago Bulls enter the matchup in excellent form but are also dealing with health setbacks. Star guard Coby White has been ruled out, while Ayo Dosunmu’s availability remains uncertain. Even so, the Bulls’ depth has shined this season, with standout performances from Josh Giddey and Nikola Vucevic helping Chicago maintain its strong early record. The Bulls’ combination of youth and experience has created a winning formula, but missing White could test their offensive rhythm against a resilient Bucks squad.Tonight’s showdown promises intensity, as both teams aim to solidify their positions in the NBA Cup standings.

Cam Thomas’ sudden setback forced the Brooklyn Nets to rethink its strategies in a early-season twist

Due to an injury to the same problematic left hamstring that destroyed the previous season, Cam Thomas, the Brooklyn Nets ' top scorer was forced to miss Wednesday night's 112-103 victory over the Indiana Pacers. With 6:46 remaining in the first quarter against the Pacers, Thomas missed a 15-foot stepback jumper, seemingly hurting himself on the landing.Cam Thomas was later classified as OUT by the team prior to tonight's game against the Detroit Pistons. He was sidelined indefinitely as a result of the setback, in addition to being out for the rest of the match. The great shooting guard may face future difficulties after re-injuring the same hamstring that prevented him from playing in 59 games the previous season.Cam Thomas, who recently sustained a hamstring injury, will be missing from Brooklyn. Even though he will be missed, this might be the ideal chance for the rookies. Thomas had a great start to the season prior to the injury , averaging 21.4 points on 40.2% field goal and 35.6% three-point shooting.However, in his eight starts, he has only contributed 2.6 assists per game, which is indicative of his ongoing scoring-first role.Even so, Thomas has been making every effort to enjoy playing basketball some more.Thomas may miss Friday's game against the Detroit Pistons , and the team will reevaluate him on Thursday, according to head coach Jordi Fernandez. Although it's regrettable that Brooklyn's 23-year-old star might not be playing, this presents a chance that the team should take advantage of right away.His absence comes at the worst possible moment for the Nets.

How Connor McDavid's wife Lauren Kyle’s bold interior design identity is redefining what an NHL power couple looks like,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/how-connor-mcdavids-wife-lauren-kyles-bold-interior-design-identity-is-redefining-what-an-nhl-power-couple-looks-like/articleshow/125149911.cms,"Lauren Kyle, fiancée of NHL star Connor McDavid, is redefining the role of athletes' partners. She's built a powerful personal brand centered on sophisticated home design, proving WAGs can be influential entrepreneurs. Kyle's approach challenges traditional NHL masculinity, pushing the league towards a more modern, visually driven era and establishing herself as a significant market voice.

Lauren Kyle’s brand narrative reflects the shift toward design-led, CEO-style WAGs rather than just “player wives”





More coverage on NHL:

There was a time when the partners of pro athletes were barely seen, rarely quoted, and almost never included in the marketing conversation, especially in the NHL, which historically hosts one of the most “closed doors, keep it all quiet” cultures in North American sports. But Lauren Kyle, the fiancée of Edmonton Oilers superstar Connor McDavid , doesn’t exist in that old template.She’s not an accessory. She is the architect of a personal brand that leans into design, refinement, and highly curated home aesthetics. The conversations around her work have been loud, polarizing, and surprisingly influential. And now, she’s becoming a case study in how WAG entrepreneurship can shape cultural direction, not just add gloss to a player’s fame.Lauren Kyle’s rise isn’t simply about the “white and metallic house” moment that went viral. It’s the fact that she doubled down, she didn’t run from the discourse. She recast the reaction as proof that her vision evokes emotion. And in a luxury economy, emotion sells.Modern NHL fans tend to assume hockey culture = traditional masculinity + limited visual references. But Kyle is pushing an entirely different energy, magazine spreads, reflective surfaces, lifestyle-forward execution, and design-first storytelling.And that is exactly why her entrepreneurial trajectory matters. She isn’t evolving alongside the NHL brand, she’s dragging parts of the league into a more visually modern era with her.And it also reframes McDavid’s public image: not just athlete, but cultural architecture subject. Today, when people say things like “Lauren Kyle has an aesthetic,” that’s not gossip, that’s branding evidence. It means she has moved from a partner role to a market voice.Her message isn’t subtle: hockey wives aren’t background props anymore. Lauren Kyle is shaping the stage itself and the NHL has never seen a design-forward power couple quite like this.","Lauren kyle, fiancée of nhl star connor mcdavid, is redefining the role of athletes' partners.
