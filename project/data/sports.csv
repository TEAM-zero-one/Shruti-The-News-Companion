Why Dallas Might Move On from PJ Washington

What PJ Washington Brings to the Table

Thehave been searching for the right move to solidify their roster—and Dallas’ draft-night fortune may have just handed them the perfect opportunity. After the Mavericks landed Duke phenom Cooper Flagg with the No. 1 overall pick, their frontcourt is suddenly overflowing with talent, potentially making key contributor PJ Washington expendable. According to Blue Man Hoop’s Tyler Watts, the Warriors, who desperately need size, defensive versatility, and reliable secondary scoring, this could be the ideal trade target to push them back into title contention.Washington, who played a crucial role in Dallas’ 2024 NBA Finals run, now finds himself in a logjam behind Flagg, Anthony Davis, Dereck Lively II, and Daniel Gafford. With the Mavericks likely looking to consolidate talent, Golden State should pounce—because the 26-year-old forward checks every box the Warriors need filled.Watts laid out the reasoning behind this potential move: ""The Golden State Warriors should trade for PJ Washington after the Cooper Flagg selection created a frontcourt logjam for the Mavericks. Dallas has Dereck Lively II locked in at the five with Anthony Davis at the four. That means playing Flagg at the three. The Mavs have Washington and Daniel Gafford behind them. All five players want significant minutes, and Dallas only has so many available in the frontcourt."" (H/t: Sporting News)- Defensive Flexibility: At 6’7”, he can guard multiple positions and even operate as a small-ball center.- Offensive Reliability: He shoots efficiently (45.3% FG, 38.1% 3PT) and thrives in catch-and-shoot situations.- Playoff Experience: His contributions were key in Dallas’ deep playoff run last season.The Golden State Warriors struggled with two major issues last season:1. Lack of Size: Their frontcourt was often outmatched against bigger teams.2. Scoring Beyond Curry: Secondary scoring options were inconsistent.While the Jimmy Butler trade improved their roster, adding Washington could be the final piece to elevate them back into title contention.Despite his strong season, PJ Washington had a rough finale, going scoreless in 27 minutes during Dallas’ Play-In loss to Memphis. However, his overall production (career-second-best numbers) makes him a valuable trade asset.With Flagg joining an already stacked frontcourt featuring Lively, Davis, and Gafford, Dallas may prioritize consolidating talent rather than keeping Washington as a reserve.- Efficient Offense: Excels in spot-up threes, closeout drives, and rim finishes.- Defensive Toughness: Switchable defender who can handle one-on-one matchups.- Championship Pedigree: Played a major role in a Finals-bound team.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Golden State Warriors predicted to sign $18,001,011 Charlotte Hornets rookie to bolster squad around Stephen Curry and Jimmy Butler and improve title odds The Warriors need one more reliable piece to compete at the highest level.

From NHL starter to unrestricted free agent after serious criminal charges

Once viewed as the future of goaltending in Philadelphia, Carter Hart’s NHL career has taken a dramatic turn amid serious criminal allegations tied to the 2018 Hockey Canada sexual assault scandal. A former standout with the Everett Silvertips and one of Canada’s brightest young stars between the pipes, Hart now finds himself at the center of one of hockey’s most controversial and troubling stories.Born in Sherwood Park, Alberta, Hart was introduced to sports psychology by age 10 and was known for his sharp focus and calm demeanor on the ice. Drafted 48th overall by the Philadelphia Flyers in 2016, he quickly emerged as a top NHL goaltender, becoming the youngest in franchise history to win his debut in 2018. His poise in high-pressure moments—like back-to-back playoff shutouts in 2020—earned him widespread praise.Internationally, Hart was a mainstay in Team Canada’s net, winning gold at the 2018 World Junior Championship and silver at the 2019 World Championship. Known for his vision training, quiet intensity, and technical discipline, he was often compared to Montreal Canadiens legend Carey Price—his childhood idol.Everything changed in early 2024. Hart was placed on indefinite leave by the Flyers in January, with the team citing ""personal reasons."" Days later, London, Ontario police named Hart as one of five players ordered to surrender and face charges related to an alleged sexual assault involving members of Canada’s 2018 World Junior team.On February 5, Hart was officially charged with one count of sexual assault. The allegations stem from an incident that has rocked Hockey Canada and led to national outcry, mass resignations, and suspended funding from the federal government.In the wake of the charges, the Flyers declined to extend a qualifying offer to Hart, making him an unrestricted free agent. He has not returned to professional play since.Also Read: Hockey Canada sexual assault trial timeline: Inside the scandal threatening to change Canadian sports forever As court proceedings unfold, the once-celebrated netminder remains one of the most controversial figures in Canadian hockey—a cautionary tale about how a promising career can unravel amid serious off-ice allegations.","Carter hart is a rising canadian goaltender with a reputation for mental toughness and poise.

In 32 games for the Mountaineers, he averaged 18.6 points, 5.6 assists, 4.1 rebounds, and 1.5 steals, earning All-Big 12 First Team honors and an AP All-American Honorable Mention.Despite being slightly undersized (190 pounds) for an NBA combo guard, Small made up for it with elite athleticism.

Canucks face critical decision as Elias Pettersson trade whispers grow louder

As the July 1 deadline looms, the Vancouver Canucks are facing mounting pressure to make a defining choice about the future of their franchise star, Elias Pettersson. Despite public statements suggesting the team is comfortable keeping him, NHL insider Chris Johnston has revealed there are “whispers” around the league that teams are quietly exploring a last-minute trade for the elite center before his no-movement clause (NMC) takes effect.Elias Pettersson signed an eight-year, $92.8 million contract with the Canucks in March 2024, locking him in through 2032. However, the NMC embedded in the deal activates on July 1, giving Vancouver a rapidly closing window to consider their options without requiring his approval.Speaking on TSN’s OverDrive, Johnston explained: “The Canucks certainly are giving off all indications that they are comfortable keeping him. That’s where they’re focused… but there are at least whispers that some teams are trying to get in and see in this last week whether they can use that window to perhaps get the player. This is really the last chance you have at a trade.”Elias Pettersson's declining performance last season—finishing with just 45 points in 64 games, a sharp drop from his 102-point output in 2022-23—has fueled debate over his long-term value.His hefty $11.5 million cap hit only adds to the complexity, making a potential trade difficult for most teams unless salary is retained or exchanged.Yet, for Vancouver, moving Pettersson could offer much-needed flexibility, especially with other roster moves and cap constraints in play. Some analysts speculate that a fresh start for both sides might be on the table, even if the Canucks aren’t openly admitting it.Once the NMC kicks in, any trade will hinge entirely on Pettersson's consent—making this week not just crucial but potentially historic for the franchise.Also Read: NHL Rumors: Blackhawks delay contract extension talks with Connor Bedard despite rising value and strong commitment Whether the Canucks pull the trigger or stay the course, one thing is clear: the Elias Pettersson saga is far from over, and the hockey world is watching closely.","Canucks face critical decision as elias pettersson trade whispers grow louder.

The Green Regime

WWE superstar recently opened up about her experiences and shared an emotional and revealing account of her 2021 WWE release. Green is one of the famous antics and a top-tier wrestler, who managed to clinch WWE’s first US Championship in December 2024. She has revealed her past experiences and why she was let go from the company.To bring some creative changes, WWE goes through a rigorous process of terminating and ending contracts with WWE stars. Chelsea Green was one of the wrestlers who had to face a similar kind of experience of being fired from the company in 2021.However, in a significant development for WWE's women's division, Chelsea Green has reportedly inked a new multi-year contract with WWE, cementing her place again in the company. Let’s now take a look at what the WWE star had to say about her last release from WWE.Green was fired by the company in 2021 due to the pandemic, but had made her return at the Royal Rumble 2023, and had signed a contract that is supposed to expire this year. Recalling this moment, Chelsea Green shared her experience after parting ways from the company for a brief period of time.Green shared an emotional and revealing account of her 2021 WWE release during an appearance on theDuring the interview, the US Champions title holder said, “I called WWE and asked if I could be released from my contract early. Normally, we have ninety days, but I asked if I could be released on day sixty or seventy and forego my pay so I could get onto the indies earlier than the group (of other released WWE stars), so I could have more hype.”She further stated, “That’s the problem too, so we’re all back on the same day, so a bunch of us would show up on the same show. We’d all be on a TNA pay-per-view, or a Ring of Honor pay-per-view, or whatever, and then who are they gonna talk about? They’re gonna talk about the person who does the most flips – it ain’t me! I don’t leave my feet, so how am I gonna draw attention to myself? Okay, I’m gonna forego my pay, and then I’m gonna get on the indies two weeks to a month early, and everyone’s gonna be shocked. It’s gonna be truly surprising because nobody’s ever done that and WWE said yes.”Moreover, Green revealed that she got the intimation from her husband, Matt Cardona, who warned her timely about the termination. ""I got very lucky because Matt called me like three minutes before I was fired and said 'You're about to get fired,'"" Green said in the podcast.“I don't know how [he knew]. I'm so glad he did because it just gave me a split second in my kitchen – I was with Santana Garrett – to regroup and be like 'How am I going to handle this?'She further added, ""It's awkward. I'm sitting there with one of my girlfriends, like, is she going to get fired? Is it just going to be me?"" she continued. ""Either way, it's awkward. If it's just me, that's awkward because now I'm fired in front of my friend who's sitting there having tea with me. Or are we both going to get fired? That's f***ing awkward too, then we're both fired and we both don't have jobs.”However, overcoming all the odds, Chelsea Green joined WWE back in 2023, and since then, she has never looked back. She became the inaugural Women's U.S. Champion in December 2024 and is now the leader of the stable known ason SmackDown.","Chelsea green has reportedly inked a new multi-year contract with wwe.

The Kansas City Chiefs are entering the 2025 NFL season without the usual championship banner to raise. After falling to the Philadelphia Eagles in February’s Super Bowl, the team faces tough questions about roster depth. Now, one analyst believes a bold trade for Dolphins cornerback Jalen Ramsey could reignite Kansas City’s Super Bowl push.Despite having Patrick Mahomes under center, the Chiefs were outclassed by the Eagles’ star-studded roster in Super Bowl LVIII. With most of their cap tied up in Mahomes, Travis Kelce, and Chris Jones, adding high-end talent is tricky. Still, the team might have enough financial wiggle room to make one more splash and a blockbuster trade could be the answer.During a recent livestream, Bleacher Report’s Mitch Milani made his case: Kansas City should trade for seven-time Pro Bowl cornerback Jalen Ramsey.“(Ramsey) can do everything well,” Milani said. “He can be interchangeable with Trent McDuffie, and he could almost play safety. So just think about the scheme advantage that Jalen Ramsey would provide for the Kansas City Chiefs.”Milani noted how Ramsey’s ability to lock down elite receivers in man coverage could mirror the defensive strategy that helped Kansas City beat the 49ers in Super Bowl LIV.Jalen Ramsey isn’t just a name, he’s a proven game-changer. A three-time first-team All-Pro, Ramsey is entering his age-31 season and the final year of a $72 million contract. With trade rumors swirling and the Dolphins potentially looking to clear cap space, the time for a move is now.For the Chiefs, this is about more than filling a gap, it’s about seizing a short Super Bowl window. Ramsey’s ability to shadow No. 1 receivers, contribute in multiple coverages, and even slide into a safety role makes him a dream fit in Steve Spagnuolo’s defense.Also Read: Deion Sanders’ health concerns draw support from Pacman Jones and Travis Hunter: “God is so good” If Kansas City wants to reclaim the Lombardi Trophy, they’ll need more than Mahomes magic, they’ll need a dominant defense.

Danny Wolf makes NBA leap with Brooklyn Nets while Jake Wolf’s heartfelt reaction captures millions online,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/danny-wolf-makes-nba-leap-with-brooklyn-nets-while-jake-wolfs-heartfelt-reaction-captures-millions-online/articleshow/122097645.cms,"(Image Source - Getty Images)

A moment of pure emotion eclipses the draft stage

Brooklyn Nets see a versatile frontcourt piece in Wolf

Danny Wolf was picked as the Brooklyn Nets’ 27th overall choice and created a buzz of emotions. But it wasn’t Danny, the towering 7-foot forward, who made headlines—it was his older brother, Jake Wolf, who took center stage. Cameras recorded Jake crying at Barclays Center, and his heartfelt reaction rapidly became a sensation online. This isn’t just about a draft pick—it represents family, hard work, and dreams coming true.The draft night wasn’t solely about Danny Wolf; it was also a significant moment for Jake Wolf, a former player from Washington University in St. Louis. As the announcer proclaimed, “Danny Wolf, Brooklyn Nets,” everything seemed to pause. Jake, surrounded by family at Barclays Center, buried his face in his hands, clearly moved to tears. Monica McNutt from ESPN even remarked during the live coverage that he was “still trying to regain his composure. ” This emotional display soon became dubbed a “generational meme,” marking his entry into viral fame.Danny Wolf’s ascent to the NBA is nothing less than motivational. A towering 7-footer from Glencoe, Illinois, he started his college journey at Yale, where he received first-team All-Ivy League accolades, was named MVP of the Ivy League tournament, and led the league in both rebounds and blocks.After making the switch to Michigan for the 2024–25 season, he played all 37 games, averaging 13.2 points, 9.7 rebounds, 3.6 assists, and 1.4 blocks per game, with an impressive shooting percentage of 49.7% from the field and 33.6% from three-point range. This stellar performance made him the Big Ten’s top rebounder and a second-team All-Big Ten selection.Brooklyn’s choice of Danny Wolf marks their fifth selection in the first round—joining a lineup of guard-oriented picks such as Russian point guard Egor Demin, French wing Nolan Traoré, UNC’s Drake Powell, and Israeli guard Ben Saraf. The front office likes his physicality, court vision and spacing of Wolf, qualities that have turned him into a modern NBA big, a player who can shoot, pass, steal rebounds and defend the rim. Being efficient in pick-and-rolling situations and handling the ball is something that makes people notice the difference, unlike other players of his size.Jake Wolf is no stranger to the competitive side of basketball. Standing tall at 6‑11, he shone at Lake Forest Academy, where he was the team captain and averaged 14 points along with 7 rebounds during his junior year. He then went on to play two seasons at Washington University (2021–2023), participating in 27 games as a freshman and starting 22 as a sophomore. His response on draft night was filled with emotion — it was personal. It captured the essence of pride, dedication, and those late nights spent on the court with Danny.Also Read: Cooper Flagg’s $63 million NBA entry sets the stage for a Dallas Mavericks era built on talent and expectations The entry of Danny Wolf in the NBA draft became a history in itself and it is the emotional and teary reaction of his brother Jake which had jolted hearts.

Every outfit worn by the youngest son of the late NHL idol, Johnny Gaudreau, Carter Michael Gaudreau, carries gentle reminders of love, memories, and fatherhood.

Meredith captioned the post with the words, ""Carter only wears the outfits daddy picked out,"" and then went ahead to add an emoji that could say more than words ever would.The tribute in the wardrobe continued in the Instagram story, where Carter was seen dressed in a pale zip-up onesie and cuddled up next to older brother Johnny Jr.Meredith mentioned that this particular onesie had now become a very regular piece of Carter's wardrobe, connecting recent moments with past family memories.
