MFTs (Tama Tonga and JC Mateo) vs. Dragon Lee & Shinsuke Nakamura

Tiffany Stratton vs. Kiana James



Ilja Dragunov vs. Aleister Black

Drew McIntyre vs. Jimmy Uso

WWE SmackDown took place at the Mullett Arena in Tempe, Arizona, this week. The show kicked off to a turbulent start with a brawl and later saw some captivating bouts, including an exciting title match. Moreover, the night also witnessed Jade Cargill unleashing his wrath and finally, a No DQ main event match that ended in a highly physical encounter and chaotic fashion.Cody Rhodes opened the show after a brief backstage talk with Jimmy Uso. As he was about to speak, Drew McIntyre arrived at the scene and berated Rhodes and the fans for supporting his recent actions. As it continued, Uso launched a sneak attack on McIntyre, accusing him of being Jacob Fatu's attacker from last week. The chaos continued until the WWE officials came down to break it up.The first match of the night pitted Tama Tonga and JC Matteo against the new duo of Rey Fenix and Shinsuke Nakamura. While the MFT members brought their dominance and cohesive unit mentality, Fenix and Nakamura combined their different styles to work as a team. However, the final moments saw Solo Sikoa and Talla Tonga interfere. Talla hit a chokeslam on Fenix and Tama followed with a running elbow to score the win for his team.This was a non-title singles match. Kiana James had her client, Giulia, at ringside, who ran interferences during the match. However, Tiffany Stratton was able to hold her own and deliver an excellent match against her opponent. Following a back-and-forth showdown, it was Stratton who picked up the win over James with the Prettiest Moonsault Ever. Giulia attacked her after the match, only for Jade Cargill to arrive to make the save. However, in a shocking moment, Cargill took down the champion and laid a beatdown cementing her heel turn.The new WWE United States Champion, Ilja Dragunov, hosted his first US title open challenge on SmackDown. It was answered by Aleister Black, with his real-life wife, Zelina Vega, by his side. The match was a compelling and intense showdown between both SmackDown rising stars as the star-spangled prize hung in the balance. Moreover, Zelina Vega ran interferences which led to the referee asking her to leave the ringside. Just then, Damian Priest marched down to the ring and took off his glasses to show his damaged eye from Black's fireball attack weeks ago, which distracted him long enough for Dragunov to hit the H bomb on him to retain his title. Priest began attacking Black, only for Vega to intervene and escape with her husband.This was a No Disqualification match for the main event of SmackDown. The stipulation led both men to take action all over the ringside and make use of some foreign objects like tables and chairs. Following a physically battering showdown, the final moments saw Drew McIntyre countering a top rope move by Jimmy Uso by throwing a chair and scoring the win with a Claymore Kick. He tried to further attack Jimmy, only for Cody Rhodes to rush down and aid him. However, the show ended with Rhodes also eating a Claymore at the hands of McIntyre, who stood tall to end the show.Also read: Fact Check: Is the WWE Legend Undertaker really coming to Bigg Boss 19?","Wwe smackdown took place at the mullett arena in tempe, arizona, this week.

Los Angeles Lakers Injury Report vs Minnesota Timberwolves (October 24, 2025)

Key Injury Notes Lakers vs Timberwolves (October 24, 2025)

The October 24, 2025 regular-season clash between theis more than just an early-season showdown - it is a tale of two teams heading in opposite health directions. While Minnesota arrive nearly flawless in terms of roster fitness, Los Angeles continue to grapple with a growing list of absences, most notably LeBron James.The Minnesota Timberwolves enter the night with a clean bill of health for the second consecutive game, giving the head coach a full complement of players to work with. Anthony Edwards, coming off a dazzling 41-point performance in the season opener against Portland, leads the charge with his trademark scoring flair.Rudy Gobert anchors Minnesota’s interior, providing elite rim protection and rebounding, while Donte DiVincenzo and Jaden McDaniels balance the floor with perimeter spacing and defensive versatility. This depth and cohesion offer the Minnesota Timberwolves a clear advantage, particularly against a Lakers squad dealing with significant roster setbacks.Minnesota’s current run of good health is reminiscent of last season, when the team ranked among the league’s best in games missed due to injury - a factor that played a major role in their deep playoff push.Their ability to stay healthy early this season could once again prove decisive in building rhythm and chemistry.The Los Angeles Lakers’ situation couldn’t be more different. LeBron James remains sidelined as he continues to recover from right-sided sciatica, with the team targeting a potential mid-November return. In his absence, Luka Dončić has assumed full control of Los Angeles’ offense.After appearing to tweak his groin during the season opener against the Golden State Warriors, Dončić is cleared for Friday’s matchup and showed no signs of discomfort in practice. Head coach JJ Redick expressed confidence in the star’s readiness to lead, emphasizing his importance to LA’s early-season stability.The Lakers’ frontcourt, however, continues to suffer. Maxi Kleber remains out with a left oblique strain and is expected to miss at least two more weeks. Rookie forward Adou Thiero is also unavailable as he continues recovering from left knee surgery, with an estimated return by the end of October.Adding to the uncertainty, backup center Jaxson Hayes is downgraded to questionable just hours before tip-off due to left knee soreness. His status is a game-time decision, leaving the Los Angeles Lakers potentially thin in the paint once again.One positive note comes from Austin Reaves, who had tweaked his ankle earlier in the week but returned to full practice on Thursday. Redick confirmed that Reaves would be active, praising his resilience and work ethic.Without LeBron’s scoring and leadership, the Los Angeles Lakers’ offense flows primarily through Dončić’s playmaking and the contributions of Reaves and Rui Hachimura. However, the lack of reliable frontcourt depth continues to be a glaring issue. Deandre Ayton, who struggled in his Lakers debut with just 10 points on 5-of-7 shooting, faces immense pressure to deliver more consistency inside.Minnesota, on the other hand, enters the matchup looking to capitalize on their superior health and established chemistry. Edwards’ relentless attacking style poses a major threat to LA’s perimeter defense, while Gobert’s presence inside will test the Los Angeles Lakers’ rebounding and rim protection.• LeBron James (right-sided sciatica) – Out, aiming for mid-November return• Maxi Kleber (left oblique strain) – Out, re-evaluation in early November• Adou Thiero (left knee recovery) – Out until late October• Jaxson Hayes (left knee soreness) – Questionable, game-time decision• Luka Dončić (groin strain) – Cleared to play• Austin Reaves (ankle tweak) – Active• Minnesota Timberwolves – Fully healthy rosterThe Minnesota Timberwolves enter Crypto.com Arena as one of the few teams in the league enjoying complete roster health, bringing with them the momentum of an opening-night statement win. For the Los Angeles Lakers, the absence of LeBron James remains the defining storyline, leaving Dončić to shoulder the offensive load while navigating a thinned-out frontcourt rotation.","Minnesota timberwolves and the los angeles lakers meet on october 24, 2025.

Known for his bold takes and larger-than-life personality, Sharpe found himself reflecting not only on his career but also on his personal life amid a storm of controversy. Earlier this year, Sharpe faced a $50 million lawsuit filed by 20-year-old OnlyFans model Gabriella Zuniga, who accused him of sexual assault, emotional abuse, and non-consensual recording during their two-year relationship. Sharpe denied the allegations, describing the relationship as consensual, and eventually the case was settled for $20 million. Incidents like an accidental broadcast of an intimate moment on Instagram Live added to the media attention and intensified scrutiny on him.While the ESPN exit and the OnlyFans-related scandal created a perfect storm of professional and personal pressure, Sharpe reflected on who actually had his back during one of the toughest moments in his career. While some peers quietly distanced themselves, one former NFL star stood out: Chad Ochocinco. Sharpe recently opened up about the loyalty he received, giving fans a peek behind the scenes of life after ESPN.Enter Chad Ochocinco.

Smith, noting that the longtimeanalyst remained a consistent ally. Even amid a lawsuit, media backlash, and career changes, Smith stuck by Sharpe, reinforcing the importance of genuine relationships.Amid lawsuits, social media scrutiny, and high-profile firings, a few genuine connections like Ochocinco and Stephen A. Smith made all the difference. Fans praised Sharpe for recognizing those who stood by him, proving that gratitude and acknowledgment go a long way.Even after leaving ESPN and navigating the OnlyFans scandal, Sharpe’s attitude remains positive.

Aaron Gordon says no thank you to taking the game ball home

Aaron Gordon falls victim to ""Steph being Steph""

Aaron Gordon of the Denver Nuggets scored a career-high 50 points on Thursday against the Golden State Warriors, on their visit to the Bay Area. He was also the highest scoring player of the night. Unfortunately, all that hard work did not get his team the win they had hoped for. When he was offered the game ball to take back home, he refused, saying he had no plans of taking an L home. While his personal showcase was spectacular, as a team they fell short against Stephen Curry led Warriors.Aaron Gordon, after scoring a career-high of 50 points against the Golden State Warriors on his team's first match of the season, was offered the game ball. He had definitely earned it, with not just his personal achievement, but also as the highest scoring player of the night. But when asked if he wanted the memento, he refused. In a post-game interview, he said:“They’re asking if I wanted the game ball, and no, I don’t want the game ball to take an L home with me. No thank you.”The match went into overtime after a thrilling game of ball, and fans of both teams looked to be having a gala time, biting their nails in anticipation until the very end. Unfortunately for Gordon and his teammates, it was the Warriors who came out on top, with a 137-131 score line at the end. So it kind of makes sense that the player would not want to take home a reminder of his loss, even if he had an amazing performance on court personally.Aaron Gordon might have been the highest scoring player of the night, but his opponents showed up with full aggression, especially Stephen Curry. Curry scored 42 points and 7 assists as well as made 3 steals and 6 rebounds during the game, and was a complete powerhouse, especially during the second half of the game.Even Gordon had to admit, it's tough handling someone like Curry. His ""Steph being Steph,"" was enough for fans to understand what he meant. Even at 37 years of age, and on his 17th season in the NBA - Curry is one of the best players in the league. And whether you are a fan, or a rival, it's difficult to disregard his talent inside the court.Also Read: NBA gambling scandal: Stephen Curry calmly weighs in as the league faces its biggest storm yet","Denver nuggets' aaron gordon scored a career-high 50 points against the golden state warriors.

Scott Foster - Why do NBA fans call him the 'Extender'?

Scott Foster has a history with controversies

Scott Foster - once named the NBA ’s ‘only active celebrity referee’ is back in the headlines, and again, not for good reasons. NBA officials are of course an integral part of the game, but very few have made their mark as much as Foster. From his controversial refereeing techniques to some even more controversial scandals that his name has been linked to, he has had his fair share of drama in his career. And now, his name is popping up once again while the NBA's name gets dragged into a betting scandal the sports industry hasn't seen in a while. So, let's learn a little more about this referee that has everyone in a twist.Scott Foster is one of the oldest active referees in the NBA - currently in his 30th year on the job. While his long tenure has given him vast experience, it has also made him one of the most hated referees in the game. In fact, according to a 2023 poll taken by NBA players, over 25% of them named Foster as the worst referee in the league. Not an easy feat to achieve, but he did it!In recent times, the FBI has begun a large-scale investigation on matters related to fraud and cheating taking place in the NBA, even among high level officials. Multiple arrests have already been made, and fans of the game cannot help but drag Foster's name into the matter as well, especially given this will not be the first time his name gets involved in something similar.Scott Foster has a history with controversy in his 30-year-long career as a referee in the NBA. While he has never been charged on any criminal matters, Foster was linked to the 2007 trial of former NBA referee, Tim Donaghy - who pleaded guilty on counts of match fixing as well as fraud.Last year, in March of 2024, Foster was also accused by all-star center Rudy Gobert of sports gambling and match fixing during a Minnesota Timberwolves vs. Cleveland Cavaliers game. Gobert was later fined $100,000 for making a money gesture at the official, and Foster of course walked free. Now his name has been dragged into yet another scandal, and fans are eager to learn more about how this matter proceeds.Also Read: When money meets the game: Top sports gambling scandals from NBA to NFL that shook the sports world","Nba officials are an integral part of the game, but very few have made their mark as much as foster.

The Dallas Mavericks have yet another home game in their hands, and this time they will be facing the Washington Wizards, who lost their opener on a visit to Milwaukee. Both teams have not won their first game, and would be looking to change that in their next match up. The Wizards came last at the end of the regular season last time, while the Mavs ended their 2024-25 campaign by barely making the Playoffs margin as the 10th seed.

Similarly, the Washington Wizards, who have been on the road for their first two matches this campaign, would also like to take the win.After their loss to the San Antonio Spurs for the Mavs and the Milwaukee Bucks for the Wizards, this match will be important for both teams.The Mavs had a 39-43 run last season, and were ousted by the Memphis Grizzlies for the last Playoffs spot. The Wizards on the other hand had one of their worst seasons in the league, with a 18-64 run. This season they have had a couple of signings, but the Mavs have a better squad than their opponents on paper, making them the favorites to win the match. And Mavs fans would surely hope to see Cooper Flagg, who they have a lot of hope on, have a better time on court than he did on his first outing.Also Read: Is WNBA rookie Sonia Citron dating Dallas Cowboys star Marist Liufau?

The Bucks superstar has been a dominant force early in the 2025-26 NBA season, opening with an impressive 37-point, 14-rebound performance. While the toe injury is a fresh concern following earlier back soreness, the latest report no longer lists the previous issue - an encouraging sign for Milwaukee fans.The Milwaukee Bucks’ decision to list Giannis Antetokounmpo as “probable” rather than “questionable” suggests optimism about his availability. While he may not be operating at full strength, all signs point toward him taking the floor and leading the team in Toronto. The coaching staff will likely manage his minutes carefully, ensuring the injury doesn’t worsen as the Bucks look to sustain their strong start to the season.Milwaukee will be without guard Kevin Porter Jr., who remains sidelined due to a left ankle sprain. His absence leaves a noticeable gap in the backcourt, putting additional pressure on Giannis Antetokounmpo and other rotation players to carry the load offensively and defensively.Expect players like Myles Turner, AJ Green, and Gary Trent Jr. to step up in expanded roles as the Bucks seek balance in their lineup.For the Raptors, health concerns are minimal heading into the matchup. Despite a few minor ailments across the roster, Toronto is expected to field a competitive team led by Scottie Barnes, RJ Barrett, and Brandon Ingram - each capable of creating problems for Milwaukee’s defense.Giannis Antetokounmpo’s strong start to the season is even more impressive considering his uneven preseason, where lower back soreness and illness briefly interrupted his rhythm. The current left great toe sprain emerged shortly before the matchup with Toronto, but the Milwaukee Bucks medical team has determined that it can be managed without forcing him to sit out.This cautious approach reflects Milwaukee’s long-term strategy to protect its franchise cornerstone early in the year. While Giannis is expected to play through the discomfort, his movement and intensity will be closely monitored, and adjustments could be made depending on how the injury responds during gameplay.The Milwaukee Bucks enter tonight’s matchup looking to maintain momentum in the Eastern Conference, with Giannis Antetokounmpo’s probable status serving as a major confidence boost. His ability to dominate on both ends of the court often dictates Milwaukee’s performance, and even a slightly limited version of the Greek Freak can be a game-changer.Toronto, meanwhile, will look to capitalize on its home-court advantage at Scotiabank Arena. With a balanced mix of young stars and experienced scorers, the Raptors are eager to test themselves against one of the league’s elite teams.Match Details and Broadcast InfoThe game tips off at 6:30 p.m. ET from Scotiabank Arena in Toronto.

Four NBA clubs have recently handed in hot water as a result of the FBI's thorough investigation into illegal sports gambling. Portland Trail Blazers coach Chauncey Billups, Miami Heat forward Terry Rozier, and numerous others were charged with federal offences on Thursday as part of the large-scale investigation. Amidst all this, the Golden State Warriors star Stephen Curry recently weighed in on it. He said that he ""wouldn't worry"" about the NBA's integrity. Stephen Curry is redefining leadership at a pivotal moment, not just by winning championships or games but by the manner in which he carried himself off the court. The Golden State Warriors guard recently opened up on the massive illegal gambling controversy that shook NBA to the core.After a well-deserved win, during a press conference, he emphasized that ""we are all very responsible"" and that the blame doesn't simply rest with a select few. Acknowledging how the situation has severely questioned the league's ethics, he further said that:""It's not just an NBA thing.”Discussing the controversy , he indicated that teammates are aware of what is happening with sports these days and what to do and not to do. He further said:""I think on the whole, everybody's very mindful of what to do, what not to do, and understanding the landscape of sports right now in general.”He continued:""And that's not just a NBA thing, this is new territory for everybody. So I think, on the whole, we all are very responsible. ""The integrity of the game is fine, and then obviously we let the situation play out, whatever happens. But I wouldn't worry about that too much.""Even while the entire legal and disciplinary situation is still pending, the veteran's public position sets a precedent for the G.S Warriors and the league as a whole. This all happened after the FBI opened up an investigation that involved allegedly rigged, mafia-connected poker games. Due to the same, dozens of people have been arrested, including Chauncey Billups and Terry Rozier.On Thursday, federal prosecutors filed two separate indictments against Rozier and Billups. The accusations are denied by both men. Rozier is among six people arrested over alleged betting irregularities. Among these are allegations that NBA players have manipulated gambling markets by fabricating illness.Warriors team-mate Draymond Green also talked about it during the same press conference. He added:""I was shocked. It's a tough moment for the individuals involved, a tough moment for the league. But I'm not going to sit here and be like, 'man, you all partner with a gambling company, you open a can of worms'. That can of worms can be open with partnering with gambling companies or not. Partnering with a gambling company is not going to make gambling more accessible to us. The accessibility is what it is."" Green and Curry's remarks come at a time when the NBA is facing massive issues. His straightforward statement opens up about the indictments, corruption scandals, and concerns about legal exposure.Curry appeared to call for accountability while also subtly acknowledging the issue. For Warriors supporters, Curry's message gives his legacy a new meaning. He delivered conscience instead of PR lines throughout a scandal-plagued season.

Theare set to clash in what promises to be a thrilling regular-season showdown on October 24, 2025. Both teams enter the matchup with injury situations that could play a major role in determining the flow and outcome of the game.The Toronto Raptors head into the contest in relatively good health, with only minor concerns on their roster. Rookie Ja’Kobe Walter will sit out due to illness, marking the team’s only confirmed absence. Forward Collin Murray-Boyles is listed as questionable as he deals with a right forearm muscle strain, and his availability will likely be determined closer to tip-off.Despite these minor setbacks, the Raptors’ core lineup remains intact. Jakob Poeltl, Jamal Shead, Gradey Dick, and Chucky Hepburn are all cleared to play, bolstering Toronto’s balance on both ends of the floor. The likely starting lineup will feature Poeltl at center, Immanuel Quickley running the point, and a strong forward rotation anchored by Scottie Barnes, RJ Barrett, and Brandon Ingram. This combination gives Toronto an ideal mix of size, defense, and offensive versatility as they prepare to host one of the East’s top teams.On the other side, the Milwaukee Bucks have one major name on their injury list - Giannis Antetokounmpo . The superstar forward is listed as probable with a left great toe sprain, though early indications suggest he’s likely to suit up. His availability is a huge boost for Milwaukee after his explosive performance on opening night, where he tallied 37 points, 14 rebounds, and 5 assists in just 27 minutes.However, the Bucks will be without Kevin Porter Jr., who remains sidelined with a left ankle sprain. He’s expected to miss not only this matchup but potentially a few more games as he recovers. The rest of Milwaukee’s rotation looks solid, with Myles Turner, AJ Green, and Gary Trent Jr. all active and ready to contribute. Their presence will be critical in supporting Giannis and maintaining the Bucks’ early momentum in the Eastern Conference standings.Toronto’s defense, led by the ever-versatile Scottie Barnes, is expected to challenge Milwaukee’s offense throughout the night. With RJ Barrett and Brandon Ingram providing scoring punch from the wings, the Raptors will look to push the pace and test the Bucks’ transition defense. The absence of Ja’Kobe Walter might slightly thin Toronto’s depth, but the team’s top-heavy talent remains a serious threat.For Milwaukee, the primary question revolves around Giannis’ health and minutes. If he plays close to his normal workload, the Bucks will have a clear edge in interior scoring and rebounding. However, the loss of Porter Jr. could strain their backcourt depth, putting more pressure on role players like Green and Trent Jr. to step up offensively.The Raptors host the Bucks at Scotiabank Arena in Toronto, with tip-off scheduled for 6:30 p.m. ET. Fans can catch the action live on FDSWI and TSN, while streaming options are available through Fubo and NBA League Pass.This matchup promises to deliver a fierce early-season contest between two teams looking to establish their dominance in the East. With both sides managing key injuries and testing their depth, the Bucks vs. Raptors game could turn into one of the closest and most competitive battles of the season’s opening stretch.","The milwaukee bucks host the toronto raptors on october 24, 2025.

The San Francisco 49ers have started the 2025 NFL season 5-2, but injuries continue to test the team. Defensive stars Nick Bosa and Fred Warner are out for the year, and several key offensive players have missed games. Quarterback Brock Purdy has only two starts so far, and the wide receiver group has been especially hit hard. Brandon Aiyuk, the team’s top wideout, is still sidelined more than a year after tearing his ACL and MCL. His absence has left a big gap in the offense.Aiyuk had a breakout 2023 season, catching 75 passes for seven touchdowns and 1,342 yards, earning second-team All-Pro honors. But injuries and a contract holdout slowed him down in 2024. He tore his ACL and MCL in Week 7 last year and hasn’t played since. Right now, Aiyuk is on the physically unable to perform (PUP) list. There’s no official return date yet, but the 49ers are hopeful. ""There's more than hope, there's some evidence. .. he's making really good progress,"" GM John Lynch said in a weekly interview with KNBR. ""He’s been putting in time and it’s coming nearer as to when he’s gonna be out there on the field."" Once Aiyuk is ready, the team can move him off the PUP list, giving him 21 days to play.The 49ers have had to rely on other players to fill the void at wide receiver. Jauan Jennings, Ricky Pearsall, and Marquez Valdes-Scantling have all missed time. Valdes-Scantling was placed on injured reserve before Week 7. With so many receivers out, running back Christian McCaffrey has become the go-to target. He leads the team in catches (53), receiving yards (516), and is tied for most receiving touchdowns (three). Despite all the injuries, San Francisco still ranks first in the league in passing yards, showing just how adaptable their offense has been.Even with so many injuries, the 49ers have kept winning. Tight end George Kittle returned from a hamstring injury in Week 7, giving the offense a boost. On defense, depth players are stepping up in place of Bosa and Warner. The team’s ability to lead the league in passing yards and maintain a winning record shows how well they’ve adapted. Christian McCaffrey has also stepped into a bigger role as a reliable target, keeping drives alive and helping the team stay balanced. Aiyuk’s return would make them even stronger as they look toward the playoffs.","49ers top wide receiver brandon aiyuk still out in 2025.

Miami Dolphins wide receiver Tyreek Hill is facing a tough decision after a serious knee injury ended his season in Week 4 against the New York Jets. Hill, 30, has had two huge seasons with Miami, including a league-leading 1,799 yards in 2023, but now he’s not sure if he’ll return to the field next year. Hill got hurt in the third quarter when his left knee twisted awkwardly as he was tackled near the Jets’ sideline after making a catch. The injury immediately ended his season, leaving both him and the Dolphins unsure about the future — even though his contract with Miami runs through next season.On teammate Terron Armstead’s podcast, Hill opened up about how he will decide whether to come back. “At the end of the day, I feel like that decision is based on how I feel and where my mindset is at the moment,” he said. “I'm happy with the career that I've had. I love playing football, but it takes a lot — mentally and physically.” He also shared how he reacted in the moment he got hurt. “When I got tackled, I tried to get up and saw my leg was crooked. I just started laughing because I’ve been able to play this game for 10 years — my entire life, really — and I’ve been blessed with great talents and support from my family,” Hill said. “I wasn’t even thinking about the injury, just about all the great moments I’ve had playing this game.”Hill won a Super Bowl with the Kansas City Chiefs in 2020 and has become one of the league’s most explosive receivers.Even as Miami has struggled this season, dropping to 1–6 after a loss to Cleveland, Hill remains confident in the team and supportive of quarterback Tua Tagovailoa. “Everybody’s apparently on the hot seat. It’s a tough situation, but I’ll support Tua no matter what because that’s my brother,” Hill said. “He wants to win — and that should show people his commitment.”With Hill out, the Dolphins will need to adjust their offense while he takes time to heal and think about his future. His decision will depend on both his physical recovery and how he feels mentally about continuing his career.","Tyreek hill is facing a tough decision after a serious knee injury ended his season.

Pokémon VGC champion WolfeyGlick shares harassment and groping experiences at competitive tournaments

“once or twice”

Impact on personal life and future appearances





WolfeGlick, 2016 Pokémon VGC World Champion, has revealed troubling experiences of harassment at competitive Pokémon events. In a recent video, Glick detailed being groped during fan interactions and photo opportunities at most tournaments he attended last season. He also shared that online harassment, including unsolicited sexual comments, has added to his discomfort. These incidents have impacted both his professional and personal life, prompting him to reconsider attending live events.Glick explained that during fan meet-and-greets and photo sessions, he was gropedper event, though he emphasized that the number should have been zero. He clarified that the groping is distinct from other unwanted contact, like tapping or grabbing for attention, which he also finds unacceptable. Sudden, uninvited physical contact can cause him physical pain due to stiff muscles, making even brief interactions uncomfortable.In addition to in-person harassment, Glick has experienced online sexual harassment, receiving unsolicited sexual comments on social media platforms. While the competitive Pokémon community generally treats him respectfully, he stressed that certain fans engage in parasocial behavior that crosses boundaries.The repercussions of these incidents extend beyond tournaments. Glick noted that after events, he sometimes feels uneasy leaving his home for about a week. As a prominent VGC content creator with large YouTube and Twitch audiences, his presence significantly boosts visibility for the competitive scene, which makes his safety and comfort a matter of wider concern.Glick is currently re-evaluating his attendance at live events, including major tournaments, to prioritize his well-being. The Pokémon Company International, which organizes Regional, International, and World Championships, has not publicly responded to Glick’s statements. These tournaments typically do not provide dedicated personal security for individual competitors unless specifically arranged, highlighting a gap in safety measures for high-profile players.While Glick continues to engage with the community online, his disclosure underscores the importance of addressing harassment at fan events and creating a safer environment for all participants. His story serves as a reminder that even celebrated players can face serious violations, and preventive measures should be considered at competitive events.Also Read: Resurfaced clip of Nina Lin sparks debate over sexual consent in streaming","Wolfeyglick, 2016 pokémon vgc world champion, has revealed troubling experiences of harassment at competitive pokémon events.

“I just stuck my head in to see how our quarterback was doing … In no way would I want a player to come back out there that wasn’t ready to play.”

NFL’s concussion policy under scrutiny after Brian Daboll and Cam Skattebo violation

“created the perception”

On October 24, 2025, the New York Giants were hit with heavy fines after head coach Brian Daboll and rookie running back Cam Skattebo violated the NFL concussion-protocol rules during their Week 6 game versus the Philadelphia Eagles. The incident occurred on October 9, 2025, at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, when rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart was escorted to the blue medical tent for a concussion check. While Dart was receiving care, Daboll and Skattebo entered the tent area, a zone reserved only for medical staff prompting the league and the players’ union to act.During the third quarter of the game, Jaxson Dart was sacked and held his head on the ground. He was taken to the sideline medical tent for a concussion evaluation. The NFL and NFLPA found that Brian Dabollthe tent and Cam Skattebo subsequently entered and spoke with Dart before his evaluation was complete, actions that constituted a perception of interference.Although the review stated neither Daboll nor Skattebo actually disrupted Dart’s exam or care, their presence violated the policy that “only medical personnel deemed essential to the care of the athlete” may be present during such evaluations.As a consequence, Daboll was fined $100,000, Skattebo $15,000, and the Giants organization faced a $200,000 fine. After the incident, Brian Daboll publicly apologised, explaining:Also Read: “Jaxson Dart Is A Better Player”: Brian Daboll Faces Ruthless Decision After Russell Wilson Pushes Back Against Quarterback Challenge This situation highlights the strictness of the NFL’s concussion-protocol rules, which are in place to protect players like Jaxson Dart and uphold independence in medical evaluations.The league’s joint statement from the NFL and NFLPA emphasised that while Dart’s care was properly managed, the actions of Brian Daboll and Cam Skatteboof interference and therefore violated the protocol.In response, the New York Giants have moved to implement additional staff training and tighter access controls to avoid similar mistakes.Meanwhile, the Giants’ upcoming rematch with the Eagles has extra attention now, not just for the game result, but with this off-field issue fresh in mind.
