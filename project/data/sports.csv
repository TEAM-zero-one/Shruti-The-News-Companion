Steve Kerr comments on Jimmy Butler's pelvis contusion injury



Steve Kerr gives update on Jimmy Butler after scary fall onto back vs Rockets

Golden State Warriors head coach Steve Kerr responded to forward Jimmy Butler ’s recent injury. Butler suffered a pelvis contusion and exited early in Wednesday night’s 109-94 loss to the Houston Rockets after a hard fall late in the first quarter. The injury occurred when Amen Thompson was shoved into Butler’s legs during a rebound attempt, causing both players to hit the floor. Butler stayed down for several moments before getting up to shoot free throws, making one of two. He left the game shortly after and did not return. An MRI is scheduled for Thursday to assess the damage.After a devastating loss to the Houston Rockets, Steve Kerr shared his thoughts on Jimmy Butler’s pelvis contusion injury during the game. “ I feel terrible for Jimmy. Hopefully he's okay. We'll see,” Kerr said. “He's going to get an MRI tomorrow. And BP really proud of him for making the effort. You know, he's been feeling terrible all day,” he continued with an update on his MRI.Kerr admitted that there was nothing wrong with the play that left Butler injured. “I think Thompson just, you know, inadvertently found himself underneath Jimmy just based on the, you know, the tug of war that was going on there. So I mean we didn't we didn't think there was anything wrong with the play. It's just one of those plays,” he said, declaring that it was a clean play from both players.Without Butler, the Warriors faced a massive void as the Rockets came in with all the firepower they had. “You know they're going to be really aggressive. They're going to blitz them,” Kerr acknowledged. Still, he is determined to counter that in the next game. “So. Obviously. We've got to be able to counter that. You know, we had too many turnovers. And against that pressure. So they were blitzing him. And they got the ball out of his hands a little bit. And we just we weren't able to counter and generate enough good offense to win the game.”After Butler’s departure, Jonathan Kuminga stepped in and Kerr is quite confident in him. “Jonathan was ready. He's been great. You know, he's been preparing every single day keeping a great attitude. You know game one he was on the bench cheering the entire time. He's a great young guy.”Kuminga missed several games before filling the void in the roster in the absence of Butler. He scored 11 points. Jonathan Kuminga admitted it’s been challenging sitting out the last three games, but he’s maintaining a focused mindset. “No matter what circumstances I’m in, always got to stay ready,” Kuminga said. Despite the recent setbacks, he remains optimistic about the future: “Whenever your moment happens, it’s going to happen.”Also Read: Golden State Warriors hit with unfortunate Jimmy Butler update during clash with Houston Rockets As for Butler, the MRI would reveal the extent of his injury and his future in the playoffs.",Jimmy butler suffered a pelvis contusion and exited early in wednesday night’s 109-94 loss to the houston rockets after a hard fall late in the first quarter.

Is Cody Rhodes not coming back to WWE?

Is WWE hinting at Cody Rhodes’ Comeback?



Cody Rhodes’ reign as Undisputed WWE Champion came to a controversial end at WrestleMania 41. Facing a heel turned John Cena, Rhodes lost not just his title but also momentum in a match that saw outside interference from rapper Travis Scott. Cena, who aligned himself with The Rock en route to the event, capitalized on the chaos to win his 17th world title - overtaking Ric Flair's iconic record.For Rhodes, it was a heartbreaking loss that reversed his year-long journey as champion, which had begun with his triumphant win over Roman Reigns at WrestleMania 40.In the aftermath, WWE Hall of Famer Bubba Ray Dudley offered a surprising take: Cody shouldn’t return to WWE television right away. Speaking on Busted Open podcast , Dudley stressed the value of emotional build-up, suggesting that letting fans “miss” Cody for a while could make his comeback more impactful.""I would like to see them wait a while... Where's Cody Rhodes? We haven't heard from him?"" said Dudley. The comment quickly sparked debate online, with some agreeing that a brief hiatus might build anticipation.Cody’s notable absence on the Raw episode following WrestleMania only added to the intrigue. Instead, John Cena opened the show and was later ambushed by Randy Orton - shifting attention away from Rhodes. WWE has made no official statement about Cody’s status, further fueling questions about whether this silence is part of a storyline or something more.Some fans worry this could hint at a longer break or potential injury, though there is no confirmation of either.There may be hope for fans eager to see Cody back soon. WWE’s promotional poster for Money in the Bank 2025 in California features The American Nightmare, suggesting a potential return at the July event. The timing would align with WWE’s strategy of creating dramatic returns around major pay-per-views.A return at Money in the Bank could set up a redemption arc for Cody, possibly even another title shot against Cena before the legend’s final match in December.Is Cody Rhodes’ career over? Not even close. If anything, this setback appears to be a calculated pause in a larger narrative arc. With time, fan anticipation, and the right moment, Rhodes could be poised for one of WWE’s most memorable comebacks.","Cody rhodes’ reign as undisputed wwe champion came to a controversial end at wrestlemania 41.

JJ Redick on Hachimura: “He’ll keep wearing the mask”



Rui Hachimura’s playoff impact goes far beyond stat sheet





Playoff basketball doesn’t wait for anyone and neither did Rui Hachimura . On a night when every possession mattered, the Los Angeles Lakers leaned on grit, hustle, and a little bit of masked heroism to grind out a Game 2 win over the Minnesota Timberwolves. After taking a shot to the face early in the game, Hachimura briefly exited the floor, only to return moments later with a black protective mask and a fire in his eyes. The Lakers fed off that energy and evened the series, 1-1, with a performance that was anything but ordinary.After the game, head coach JJ Redick didn’t dodge the obvious topic, Rui Hachimura’s unexpected new look. The forward’s return in a protective mask raised questions about the severity of the injury and what it meant moving forward. Redick reassured reporters that Hachimura is doing well but mentioned that the mask will likely stay on for now as a precautionary measure.It’s not the most comfortable solution, but it’s a smart one. Facial injuries can be unpredictable, and for someone like Hachimura who brings physicality on both ends of the floor, it makes sense to take extra care. The important part? He’s staying in the lineup, and his presence remains a big part of the Lakers' playoff plans.While his stat sheet against Minnesota hasn’t exactly turned heads, Rui Hachimura’s presence on the court tells a much bigger story. He brings a level of consistency and versatility that doesn’t always show up in the box score. During the regular season, he quietly averaged 13.1 points and 5 rebounds per game, while shooting an impressive 41.3% from beyond the arc, proof of his ability to stretch defenses and keep opposing bigs honest. Add to that his size and strength on defense, and you’ve got a two-way player who can slide into multiple roles depending on the matchup.Also Read: Donovan Mitchell’s injury forces Cavs to think bigger than no. 1 seed And let’s not overlook his playoff pedigree. Hachimura has built a reputation for stepping up when it matters most. Whether it’s making timely shots, locking in defensively, or simply providing that calm, steady energy in chaotic moments, he has a knack for shining brightest under pressure. If the Lakers have any plans of making a deep postseason run, they’re going to need more of that clutch DNA, mask or no mask.",Rui hachimura returned to the court in a protective mask after taking a shot to the face.

Kevin Costner's Draft Day Scores Big on Netflix as NFL Draft Week Heats Up



Draft Day Official Trailer #1 (2014) - Kevin Costner, Jennifer Garner Movie HD

As the 2025 NFL Draft week unfolds, Kevin Costner’s 2014 sports drama Draft Day has unexpectedly surged back into the spotlight. Now trending on Netflix, the film has rekindled discussions about the intensity of draft-day decisions and the emotional stakes involved in professional football management. With the movie's return to streaming aligning perfectly with one of the NFL’s biggest annual events, its newfound relevance couldn't have come at a better time.At its core, Draft Day offers a dramatized peek into the whirlwind that surrounds the NFL Draft. Costner plays Sonny Weaver Jr., the fictional general manager of the Cleveland Browns, who finds himself navigating a maze of personal struggles and professional high-stakes gambles. The story unfolds over just 24 hours—a day that could define his career and change the trajectory of an entire franchise. The compressed timeline might defy the intricate, months-long preparations real NFL teams undertake, but it does an exceptional job of capturing the pressure-cooker environment that GMs endure.Though critics initially gave Draft Day a lukewarm reception—earning a 60% score on Rotten Tomatoes and a 6.8 on IMDb—the film has gradually built a dedicated fan base. While purists and insiders have called out some unrealistic elements, such as Sonny’s spur-of-the-moment draft decisions, fans have applauded the movie’s energy, tension, and compelling storytelling. The portrayal may not check every box for accuracy, but it resonates emotionally and delivers an engaging narrative that appeals to both hardcore football lovers and casual viewers.One of the movie's strongest points lies in its authentic flavor, thanks largely to the NFL's active involvement. With scenes shot during the real 2013 NFL Draft and appearances by actual players, coaches, and executives, the film achieves a level of realism that’s rare in sports dramas. The inclusion of familiar faces not only adds credibility but also makes for a delightful Easter egg hunt for fans. “Draft Day features a ton of cameos from real people in the football world,” a detail that has not gone unnoticed among viewers rediscovering the film on Netflix.Moreover, the all-star cast elevates the film's appeal. From Jennifer Garner and Denis Leary to Sam Elliott and the late Chadwick Boseman, the performances add gravitas and emotional weight. Each actor delivers with conviction, making the viewer feel the magnitude of every decision Sonny Weaver Jr. faces.In a sign of its growing cultural footprint, Draft Day is also being adapted into a television series—this time, set in the NBA. Produced by Lionsgate Television and LeBron James’ SpringHill Company, the upcoming series aims to shift the narrative into the world of basketball, offering viewers another look at the chaos and calculation behind professional drafts.While Draft Day may never fully escape criticism for its narrative liberties, its resurgence proves that it taps into something timeless—the passion, strategy, and drama that define professional sports. Its revival on Netflix during NFL Draft week only reinforces its place as a compelling sports drama that continues to stir conversation and capture hearts.Also Read: Shannon Sharpe’s NFL Draft appearance sparks outrage amid sexual assault lawsuit",Draft day gets unexpected second chance as nfl fans binge-watch kevin costner’s sports film on netflix.

Crypto and Hockey: An unlikely pairing?



The trust factor: Is Ndax ready for prime time?



Chasing the Gen Z audience or chasing the hype?



When the NHL announced its first-ever crypto partnership , naming Ndax the Official Crypto Trading Platform Partner during the 2025 Stanley Cup Playoffs , it left fans and critics alike wondering who exactly is Ndax, and why now?The partnership, while groundbreaking, has sparked a whirlwind of debate in the hockey community and beyond. Ndax, one of Canada’s largest crypto trading platforms, is stepping into the national spotlight at a time when crypto still polarizes public opinion. And the NHL, a legacy sports league rooted in tradition, is taking a bold leap into the volatile world of digital finance .Let’s be clear that this isn’t just a logo-on-the-ice kind of deal. The Ndax brand will be front and center during all Canadian broadcasts of the Stanley Cup Playoffs, embedded in camera-visible in-ice placements and the NHL’s digitally enhanced dasherboards. Beyond the optics, Ndax is launching ""Ndax ICE,"" a campaign offering fans a shot at crypto credits and tickets to the Stanley Cup Final. In short, the NHL is going all-in on this partnership. But should they be?Unlike household names like Coinbase or Kraken, Ndax is relatively unknown to the average sports fan. Founded in Calgary, Ndax (short for National Digital Asset Exchange ) has quietly grown into a regulatory-compliant, high-volume exchange with $17.5 billion in lifetime trading and $1 billion in assets under custody. Yet, critics argue that visibility doesn’t equal credibility, especially when dealing with an industry still recovering from high-profile collapses like FTX.For the NHL, a league that prides itself on its heritage and integrity, this move feels both ambitious and risky. Crypto, while promising innovation and financial freedom, remains a contentious space filled with regulatory gray areas, price volatility, and consumer skepticism. Is this a forward-thinking leap into the future or a gamble during the most prestigious event in hockey?From the league’s perspective, the move may be a calculated play to connect with younger, digitally-savvy fans. Crypto aligns with the fast-paced, tech-centric world that Gen Z and Millennials inhabit. But critics warn that this strategy might alienate traditional fans who view crypto as speculative, unstable, or even predatory.The NHL’s partnership with Ndax could be a game-changing alliance or a cautionary tale in the making. It’s a bold, polarizing move that positions hockey at the crossroads of tradition and tech disruption. Whether fans embrace it or push back, one thing is certain: the league’s playoff spotlight just got a lot more controversial.Also Read: Chris Drury’s new contract- Did Rangers play it smart or stuck in gamble they might regret?

With Ndax now etched into the ice and beamed onto screens across Canada, fans are left to wonder whether this partnership is a bold step toward the future or the kind of gamble that could leave the league out in the cold.","Nhl teams up with ndax for a crypto-powered playoffs.

Ovechkin, who has become an increasingly vocal supporter of the Washington Commanders, took the opportunity to connect with Daniels and the team in a very personal way.

LeBron James details why NBA playoff game 3 will be crucial



NBA Playoffs Are a Different Game | LeBron James & Steve Nash | MIND THE GAME

The Los Angeles Lakers bounced back in the playoff game 2 with a stunning 94-85 win against the Minnesota Timberwolves at the Crypto.com arena. LeBron James , the standout star and Lakers veteran, has recently shared that game 3 in the playoffs is the most crucial for any team. In a candid chat with Steve Nash on the Mind The Game podcast, the duo discussed the shift in the gameplay in the playoffs, even James compared it to the Olympic games.LeBron James recently had a candid chat with former Lakers star Steve Nash on the Mind The Game podcast. While the duo discussed many NBA topics, their thoughts on the playoff game 3 for the Lakers revealed James’ potential move. The Minnesota Timberwolves will be looking forward to adding another win to lead the series, while the Lakers’ stance will also define their playoff run after their game 2 victory.“The physical intensity of the defense — you’ve seen them in the regular season, but if they’re going to blitz you in the playoffs, that is a different blitz,” Nash initiated the discussion. “That is a different blitz. That is physical. That is hands. That is the body, feet — everything taking away space,” he added.James hailed the playoff defense intensity while acknowledging the referees for allowing defensive heat a bit more than in the regular season. “The referees allow it a little bit more, too. The refs allow it. And I love it. And I love when you can be more handsy, you can be more physical, and the whistle is not blown as frequently, right?” James said in the podcast.Does this mean James and the Lakers are looking to employ his defensive strategy more than their offense? Possibly. And there is a roster of capable players, including Luka Doncic and Austin Reaves, to aid him in clinching another win in the series with a blend of both offense and defense. Still, James, who is now 40 years old, finds it a bit difficult to catch up to the level of the intensity, at least with immediate effect.“I actually like this. But I need a game or two to actually get to it. It takes a couple games. Because if you’ve been training your body and playing a certain way for eight months, and then all of a sudden, within one week, you have to now go into the postseason where everything is more physical, everything is faster, everything is more intensified,” the Lakers legend shared.Certainly, there is a stark contrast in the regular season and the playoffs, as James puts it, “like playing in the NBA to now playing in the Olympics.”Game 3 is scheduled for Thursday night (9:30 p.m. ET) in Memphis.Also Read: NBA Playoffs: Golden State Warriors saw crushing game 2 defeat against Houston Rockets after Jimmy Butler’s injury In game 2, Luka Doncic led the team with an impressive 31 points and also contributed significantly with 12 rebounds and 9 assists in his 42 minutes and 9 seconds on the court.

Shedeur Sanders faces harsh draft scrutiny amid polarizing NFL projections



As the 2025 NFL Draft is almost here, a rising storm of skepticism surrounds Shedeur Sanders , the quarterback once heralded as a top-three pick. Just days before the event in Green Bay, the narrative around the Colorado standout and son of Deion ""Coach Prime"" Sanders has taken a dramatic turn, with criticism mounting from all corners of the league.Despite reports that the Pittsburgh Steelers and a few other teams have expressed interest, Shedeur’s draft process has been anything but smooth. In recent weeks, a wave of brutally honest assessments from NFL insiders has cast a shadow over his immediate future in the league.NFL Network’s Tom Pelissero shared a particularly jarring collection of quotes that have raised eyebrows across the scouting community. One assistant coach didn’t hold back, stating: ""The worst formal interview I've ever been in in my life. He's so entitled. He takes unnecessary sacks. He never plays on time. He has horrible body language. He blames teammates. ... But the biggest thing is, he's not that good."" That statement alone paints a picture of a player whose talent is being overshadowed by concerns about maturity and leadership.Another red flag came from an AFC executive who highlighted Shedeur’s apparent inflexibility during team interviews: ""It didn't go great in our interview. He wants to dictate what he's going to do and what's best for him. He makes you feel small."" Such remarks hint at deeper issues that could affect his locker room presence—an intangible yet vital aspect of a quarterback's role.Adding to the scrutiny, a general manager remarked that Ole Miss quarterback Jaxson Dart had far more impressive game tape. This view was echoed by an NFC GM who recalled liking Sanders a year prior but noted a steep drop-off: ""They did change coordinators. It just felt different. It felt less athletic, less arm talent -- everything felt less."" That sentiment encapsulates a broader disappointment with Sanders’ 2024 performance.The harshest blow, perhaps, came from an NFC quarterbacks coach quoted by Albert Breer of Sports Illustrated: ""This guy—if his last name was Breer—and he was coming out of Minnesota, he'd be a sixth-round pick. He doesn't play with good feet, he's late on stuff, he has an average arm. His accuracy is O.K., but he has no timing, no anticipation."" The coach also called out his underwhelming pro day performance, noting the absence of rhythm and precision expected at the NFL level.Still, some conflicting reports have cast doubt on just how poorly his interview with the Steelers truly went, suggesting the full story may not be as clear-cut as some believe.Once projected as a top-tier selection, Sanders may now find himself slipping into the later stages of the first round—possibly even beyond the 20th pick. Yet, in a draft class loaded with potential but thin on proven quarterbacks, his name may still carry weight. The question is: will it be enough to overshadow the growing doubts?For now, Shedeur Sanders remains one of the most polarizing prospects entering the draft. Whether he becomes a first-round steal or a cautionary tale will be decided not by his last name, but by how he handles the scrutiny and what he delivers on the field.Also Read: Who is Mel Owens?
