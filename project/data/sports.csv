The final drive with Walter Gretzky that meant more than the farewell ovation

Lessons from Walter Gretzky that shaped a hockey icon

Wayne Gretzky’s last NHL appearance on April 18, 1999, at Madison Square Garden is remembered as a celebration of the “Great One’s” extraordinary career. Yet, for Gretzky, the moment wasn’t only about the sold-out crowd, the ovations, or the history—it was about a quiet car ride with his father, Walter Gretzky.On the 25th anniversary of his retirement, Wayne Gretzky reflected on why he asked Walter to drive him to Madison Square Garden that night. “For my final game, I decided that since my dad drove me to the first game I ever went to, it would be great to drive my dad to my last game,” he told NHL.com.That ride, however, was far from ordinary. Gretzky admitted, “The ride was good, but it was kind of awful in the same sense because every three minutes, he kept hitting my leg and telling me that I could play one more year. I said, ‘No, dad, I’m done.’”While the NHL and fans worldwide treated the day as a fitting farewell to the greatest player in hockey history, Gretzky cherished that personal moment most. To him, it was the perfect full-circle memory, blending his first steps in hockey with the end of his iconic journey.Wayne Gretzky's father, Walter Gretzky was more than just a supportive parent—he was the guiding force behind Wayne’s rise.When officials tried to block young Wayne from moving to Toronto in 1974, Walter stood firm, saying, “No, they can't tell me where to send my own boy… If he will be happy elsewhere, we decide between the family.”Also Read: What is the Wayne Gretzky Rule and how it changed the modern NHL forever Walter’s philosophy of family first left a lifelong mark on Wayne, who carried those values into his career and personal life. Though Walter passed away in 2021, his wisdom continues to influence Gretzky, reminding fans that behind the hockey legend was always a devoted son.After his retirement in 1999, Wayne Gretzky was immediately inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame, making him the most recent player to have the waiting period waived. The NHL retired his jersey number 99 league-wide. Gretzky was one of six players voted to the International Ice Hockey Federation's (IIHF) Centennial All-Star Team.Gretzky's career achievements include a record nine Hart Trophies as the most valuable player in the NHL. Between 1981 and 1994, he won the Art Ross Trophy, presented to the NHL's season points leader, 10 times.","Wayne gretzky's last nhl appearance on april 18, 1999, at madison square garden is remembered as a celebration of the “great one’s” extraordinary career.

Sanders brothers face different NFL fates



Sanders family resilience shines brighter than football

Deion Sanders stood in a place only a father and a football legend could—watching his sons fight for their NFL dreams as teams trimmed rosters to 53. Both Shedeur and Shilo Sanders carried the Sanders name onto the field with passion, grit, and promise. The results, however, couldn’t have been more different, and yet Deion’s words showed where his true pride lies.Shedeur Sanders, drafted in the fifth round, found a home with the Cleveland Browns. His preseason started with sparks—13-of-24, 138 yards, and two touchdowns—but ended on a shaky note. Despite that, his work was enough to earn a place on the Browns’ roster. Shilo Sanders, on the other hand, went undrafted but was picked up by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. His path turned rough after being ejected for throwing a punch in the final preseason game, leading to an early cut.Through it all, their father stayed grounded. Deion Sanders, fresh off a battle with bladder cancer, kept perspective: “All of the Sanders’ are going to be straight, with or without football.” Those words carried a weight beyond sports—a reminder that the Sanders legacy isn’t defined by wins, losses, or roster spots.Even as Shedeur celebrates making the team, his role is set for development. With head coach Kevin Stefanski naming Dillon Gabriel the backup to Joe Flacco, Shedeur will start as the Browns’ third-string quarterback. Stefanski explained, “It’s such an all-encompassing evaluation… we also saw a lot of them out here in practice and how they are at their craft.” For Shedeur, growth remains the priority.For the Sanders family, setbacks are not dead ends. Shilo may have been cut, but opportunities remain in a league where injuries and roster shifts are constant. Shedeur, only 23, has shown flashes that justify Cleveland’s belief in him.Deion himself now turns his attention back to Colorado, preparing his Buffaloes for their opener against Georgia Tech. Yet whether it’s Folsom Field or an NFL stadium, the message remains the same: family strength outweighs football outcomes.The Browns may have secured their third-string quarterback, but the Sanders family has already proven they’re built for the long game—on and off the field.Also Read: “We got this one right!”: Tom Brady proves fatherhood is his greatest win with heartfelt letter to son Jack","Shedeur sanders, drafted in the fifth round, found a home with the cleveland browns.

Michael Jordan wins $8.9 million lawsuit against Dominick’s in 2015

Michael Jordan donates the proceeds and supports Chicago children

Even after retiring from the NBA, Michael Jordan has remained a strong and determined figure. Off the court, he is just as careful about his rights as he was about his game. One story from 2015 shows how seriously he protects his personal identity. Jordan’s actions sent a clear message about defending personal rights and giving back to the community at the same time.The case began in Chicago, Illinois, where Michael Jordan, the Hall of Famer and six-time NBA champion, noticed his name was used without permission. The Chicago-based supermarket chain Dominick’s, a subsidiary of Safeway that later closed in 2013, ran an advertisement in 2011 featuring Jordan’s name to promote a meat sale in a Sports Illustrated special issue. Jordan’s legal team said the chain had no right to use his name.The supermarket first offered a settlement of about $126,900, but Michael Jordan’s lawyers argued that the sum should match the real advertising value of his name. After the court reviewed the case, Jordan won $8.9 million. ESPN reported his comments after the verdict, saying,“No one, whether or not they’re a public figure, should have to worry about their identity being used without their permission.”Jordan added, “I hope this case sends a clear message…that I will continue to be vigilant about protecting my name and identity.”Michael Jordan made it clear that the lawsuit was not about money. Instead, it was about integrity, honesty, and defending his personal rights. He pledged to donate the full $8.9 million to 23 charities in Chicago that support children’s health, education, and well-being. In a news release shared with ABA Journal, Jordan said, “Chicago has given me so much, and I want to give back to its kids, the city’s future.”Jordan, now 62, is not only a legendary basketball player but also a cultural icon who uses his platform to make a difference. The Dominick’s case shows how he defends his rights and uses victories to help others.His careful attention to personal identity also comes amid other legal challenges, such as his 2015 lawsuit in China against Qiaodan Sports, which uses his name and number 23 without permission. This story originally appeared on ESPN and ABA Journal and highlights Michael Jordan’s commitment to personal rights, community support, and integrity both on and off the courtWhile not revealing his true name, Michael Jordan recently raised additional funds by offering a donation of $10 million and launching two community health centers in Wilmington, North Carolina in millions for these initiatives, emphasizing his great and continuous dedication to helping underprivileged areas.","""i want to give back to kids"" - michael jordan proudly donated $8.9 million after winning supermarket lawsuit in 2015.

Clare initially turned down Tommy Fleetwood before love story started

Clare Fleetwood ’s support during heartbreaking near-misses

Tommy Fleetwood is one of the top-paid golfers in the world as of August 2025. On the PGA Tour itself, he has won more than $31 million in prize money. This statistic makes him one of the biggest-money winners in the history of the DP World Tour, with a career earnings total of around $35 million.Other sources of income have also bolstered Fleetwood, but still has yet to nab a win on the PGA Tour. In addition, he has taken home sponsorship deals with Nike, TaylorMade, and TAG Heuer, benefitting from a significant amount of millions as a result of golf's former Player Impact Program.Tommy Fleetwood met his wife, Clare, in 2015, which further blended his personal and professional lives. Clare was then a sports management executive when she became Tommy's client. Their work was the beginning of what would soon become a deeper relationship, despite their 23-year age difference, and after the controversies from the media.Clare explained how she initially turned down Tommy when he first asked her out because the age gap made her feel cautious. But after further thought, she succumbed, and the couple entered a relationship that shocked the golf world.The pair had concerns about whether mixing business with romance would work, but agreed to give it six months to see how it went.So when they did, they were surprised to find that the two arrangements reinforced each other, professionally and personally. Clare, who maintains a cool and calm approach, has regularly been acknowledged as a reason Tommy stays composed and relaxed in stressful situations on the course.Apart from materialistic dividends, there have been some massive emotional ups and downs in Fleetwood’s professional career. Clare has remained his rock through his lowest lows, which include several painful near misses on the PGA Tour.None was more heartbreaking than the one he endured at the Travelers Championship as Tommy once again finished in second place, this time the victim of a late charge by Keegan Bradley to come up one stroke short of the winner. Enticing words like these have shaped his career narrative to date, so near, but not close enough to cement that first PGA Tour title.Going into the last 18 holes of the Tour Championship, Fleetwood was quoted as a fan's favourite, and Clare was back to have his back as always. Friends of the couple say Clare has been a great support to Tommy in dealing with the pressure, and his two losses have only made him more determined and focused towards the future.Also Read: Who is golfer Tommy Fleetwood’s wife Clare?

Maple Leafs Core Looks Different After Marner’s Exit

How the Maple Leafs Adjust Could Define Their Season

The Toronto Maple Leafs enter training camp under immense pressure to prove their revamped roster is capable of delivering results. With a turbulent offseason behind them—one that saw Mitch Marner leave for Vegas and Brendan Shanahan step away from the front office—the team now faces the challenge of redefining its identity. For a franchise long measured by postseason success, how quickly the new-look Leafs gel could determine whether this season restores faith or fuels further doubt.Losing Mitch Marner was never going to be easy. Widely regarded as one of the league’s premier playmakers and a strong two-way winger, his departure has left a gap that Toronto didn’t immediately address through a blockbuster signing. Instead, the Maple Leafs seem content to enter the season with internal solutions. That leaves young talents like Matthew Knies tasked with taking on more defensive responsibility, while the right side of the forward group remains a glaring question mark.One player drawing attention is Easton Cowan, though expectations suggest he will spend more time developing with the Marlies before stepping into a top-six NHL role. This reality places further pressure on Auston Matthews and William Nylander to elevate their chemistry, something that hasn’t clicked as seamlessly as the Matthews–Marner partnership once did.Meanwhile, additions like Nic Roy and Dakota Joshua could provide lineup flexibility, giving head coach Craig Berube room to experiment as the team searches for balance.The biggest storyline heading into the year revolves around how the Maple Leafs adapt to life without Marner. Auston Matthews, fresh off battling a shoulder injury last season, must prove he can remain dominant without his longtime linemate feeding him passes. If Nylander doesn’t seamlessly slot into that role, recently acquired Matias Maccelli could be called upon to act as a setup man, despite a dip in production last year.There’s also the intriguing possibility of Matthews evolving his game. By adopting more of a playmaking role—much like Steven Stamkos did in Tampa Bay after injury—he could help maximize Knies and Nylander’s offensive upside. Such an adjustment wouldn’t just patch the loss of Marner; it could also make Toronto more unpredictable offensively.Ultimately, the question is whether the Maple Leafs can quickly prove that their retooled roster remains competitive at the highest level. If they adapt with resilience, the early months of the season might spark confidence that this group, despite dramatic changes, is still built to chase a championship.Also Read: NHL Trade Rumors: Mason McTavish’s contract talks with Ducks take twist after Marco Rossi’s surprising extension","Toronto maple leafs enter high-stakes preseason needing to silence doubts about their rebuilt championship hopes.

Why Auston Matthews is under growing scrutiny



Is Auston Matthews being disrespected in the media?

Can Craig Berube unlock the best of Auston Matthews?



The Toronto Maple Leafs enter the 2025–26 season with more questions than answers, and at the heart of the storm stands Auston Matthews. After an injury-plagued campaign that saw his numbers dip to 33 goals, the Leafs captain faces louder criticism than ever. His place among the league’s elite has been challenged, and his response this season may determine not only his legacy but also Toronto’s pursuit of an elusive Stanley Cup.Auston Matthews’ slide to seventh on the NHL Network’s ranking of top centers ignited heated debate. Former players and analysts alike questioned whether his production and leadership still measure up against proven playoff performers. Toronto’s own media hasn’t spared him either. On TSN’s OverDrive, Dave Feschuk questioned his postseason impact, noting: “Sometimes he gives you the idea he isn’t concerned or he’ll do his thing. But his thing being 33 goals, and only four goals in 18 playoff games; that’s why he is 7th. ”The comparison with playoff-tested giants like Connor McDavid and Leon Draisaitl only sharpens the spotlight. Matthews’ critics point to his lack of signature postseason moments, where Toronto has repeatedly faltered in elimination games.For a franchise haunted by decades without a championship, patience is wearing thin.Inside the locker room, however, Matthews is still seen as a leader whose calm presence sets the standard. His teammates respect the way he leads by example rather than theatrics. New head coach Craig Berube is banking on that composure while also challenging Matthews to evolve into a more complete, two-way player. With a fully healthy season, Berube’s system could be the key to reshaping the narrative around his captain.The Maple Leafs’ season opener is fast approaching, and the stakes couldn’t be higher. For Matthews, silencing the doubts won’t just come from racking up goals in the regular season—it will hinge on delivering when it matters most.

Elliotte Friedman suggests beating Florida would have rewritten Mitch Marner’s future in Toronto

NHL Update From Europe | 32 Thoughts

William Nylander ’s comments show Mitch Marner’s heart was still in Toronto

The Toronto Maple Leafs’ breakup with Mitch Marner has been one of the most polarizing NHL storylines of the summer. After years of speculation about his long-term fit, the star winger was dealt to the Vegas Golden Knights in a blockbuster move. But according to insider Elliotte Friedman, Marner’s exit wasn’t inevitable — it might have been avoided entirely if the Leafs had managed to edge out the Florida Panthers in the 2025 Stanley Cup Playoffs.On his 32 Thoughts Podcast, Elliotte Friedman floated an intriguing counterfactual: “There are other players who feel that when Marner didn’t sign last summer that the writing was on the wall. My position is this: If they beat Florida in the second round – which they should have done – I don’t see how Mitch Marner isn’t in Toronto.”The idea highlights just how thin the margins are in playoff hockey. A Game 7 win against the Panthers wouldn’t just have sent Toronto deeper into the postseason, it might also have altered the front office’s perspective on keeping their core intact. Friedman even doubled down, saying, “I could be totally wrong… but I just don’t see a way if they beat Florida that Mitch Marner doesn’t find a way to re-sign in Toronto.”Adding fuel to Friedman’s theory are William Nylander’s recent remarks. He revealed, “I don’t think he was ever thinking of leaving ahead of time… his play was focused on helping us. Then I asked him after the season, and he wasn’t sure.”Also Read: NHL Trade Rumors: Rangers risk losing their Stanley Cup window as key stars face uncertain future Together, the remarks suggest Toronto’s playoff collapse didn’t just end a season — it accelerated a breakup.

What This Means for the Golden State Warriors

Theare exploring potential reinforcements this offseason, and one name on their radar is. As the franchise navigates a complicated summer, Beasley’s shooting ability could provide the offensive boost they are seeking.The Golden State Warriors ’ offseason has been anything but smooth. The front office is still working through contract decisions surrounding restricted free agent Jonathan Kuminga, a process that has slowed down their pursuit of other targets.With Stephen Curry, Draymond Green, and newly added Jimmy Butler leading the charge, Golden State is looking to squeeze out another championship run before time catches up with its core stars. To do so, the team knows it must strengthen its roster through smart signings.According to NBA insider Keith Smith, “the Warriors could potentially be involved in the running for Beasley, but their situation with Kuminga is currently holding them back.”Beasley, who became a free agent after a strong stint in Detroit, is known for his outside shooting and scoring punch. Last season with the Pistons, he played in all 82 games and started 18, averaging an impressive 16.3 points per game.He shot 41.6 percent from beyond the arc, reaffirming his reputation as a reliable floor-spacer. Malik Beasley has carved out a reputation as one of the league’s dependable shooters. His best statistical stretch came in the 2019-20 season, following his trade to the Minnesota Timberwolves, when he averaged 20.7 points across 14 starts.Before his professional career, Beasley played one season of college basketball with the Florida State Seminoles. He entered the NBA as the 19th overall pick in the 2016 NBA Draft.If the Golden State Warriors can resolve their situation with Kuminga, pursuing Malik Beasley could be a logical step to strengthen their bench and add much-needed perimeter scoring. At 28 years old, Beasley’s combination of shooting and experience makes him an attractive fit for a team built around stars who thrive with floor-spacing.Also read: NBA Trade News: Golden State Warriors Reject Sign-and-Trade Offers for $48,658,536 Million Star Duo to Improve Titular Odds Golden State’s future success depends on maximizing its current championship window.

No-Trade Clause Puts Control in LeBron’s Hands

How Salary Cap Rules Complicate Trade Mechanics

Why Timing and Championship Aspirations Play an Important Role

continues to be one of the NBA’s most intriguing trade possibilities, especially with persistent links to the. Despite discussions spanning over 18 months, a deal has not materialized due to a tangled mix of salary cap rules, the Los Angeles Lakers’ reluctance, and LeBron’s own no-trade clause.The Golden State Warriors have made repeated attempts to explore a trade for LeBron James, envisioning a historic duo alongside Stephen Curry. Reports indicate that team owner Joe Lacob even contacted former Lakers ownership to push the idea. Golden State’s interest underscores their desire to maximize Curry’s championship window with another generational superstar.The Los Angeles Lakers have been firm in shutting down trade talks involving LeBron James . While the Warriors have floated scenarios involving Jimmy Butler, Jonathan Kuminga, or multi-player packages, the Lakers have shown no willingness to part ways with their star. For Los Angeles, moving James without a return that significantly bolsters their roster would be a nonstarter.Beyond the Lakers’ stance, James himself wields rare control over his future thanks to his no-trade clause. This provision allows him to veto any deal, making his consent essential. Although speculation has swirled - fueled by comments from agent Rich Paul - LeBron has not formally requested a trade. His silence suggests he is weighing options, but for now, he remains committed to the Los Angeles Lakers.Even if all parties agreed, the financial side presents enormous challenges. LeBron’s contract requires near-exact salary matching under NBA trade rules. For Golden State, that means giving up a high-salary player like Jimmy Butler or combining multiple pieces such as Draymond Green, Moses Moody, and Buddy Hield. Such a move risks hard-cap restrictions and reduces roster flexibility - something the Warriors are cautious about, particularly with Kuminga’s restricted free agency looming.LeBron, who turns 41 later this year, remains motivated to compete for titles. The Warriors are similarly focused on short-term contention, but they are hesitant to jeopardize their future for a risky trade. The Los Angeles Lakers, meanwhile, are not eager to help a Western Conference rival strengthen its championship odds. This clash of ambitions further reduces the likelihood of an in-season deal.The more realistic window for movement could come in the summer, when James will enter free agency. A sign-and-trade scenario may emerge if the Los Angeles Lakers pivot toward rebuilding. Until then, trade chatter will persist, driven by the Warriors’ continued interest and LeBron’s carefully guarded stance.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Golden State Warriors Potentially Eyeing Former $42 Million Detroit Sharpshooter in Free Agency to Bolster Roster In short, while the idea of Curry and LeBron sharing the court fuels fan excitement, the realities of contracts, finances, and player control make the trade nearly impossible in the present.

Jared McCann’s value to the Seattle Kraken

Brandt Clarke’s future with the Los Angeles Kings

Brandt Clarke scores third hat-trick of the season

Ever since the rumor rounds returned with a new twist, the Seattle Kraken's Jared McCann and the Los Angeles Kings' Brandt Clarke have been the two most outstanding individuals. Attention is being drawn to both players for very different reasons. McCann, the most consistent and reliable scorer for the Kraken, is linked to teams needing additional offensive strength, while Clarke is an option on the trade list, though the Kings seem hesitant to make that move.Jared McCann has been the focal point of the offense for the Seattle Kraken. He has had 3 consecutive seasons of over 60 points to his name, with a 40-goal, 70-point season in 2022-2023. Although there have been a few rumors about the Montreal Canadiens and New Jersey Devils being interested in him, McCann’s departure from Seattle does not seem to be in the cards.In addition to the above, McCann’s contract makes him even more attractive — he is under contract until 2026-27 for $5 million per year and comes with a 10-team no-trade clause. If the Kraken do not struggle this season, it is unlikely he can be taken from them without giving up a lot in return.The Los Angeles Kings are on the other side of these developments and are now working on reshaping their blue line after summer departures and veteran additions.Amid this reorganization, young defenseman Brandt Clarke also came into the rumor spotlight. At 22 years of age, Clarke showed promising growth last season with 33 points in 78 games.While rumors circled that the Kings wanted to move him, it now looks like new general manager Ken Holland wants to gauge Clarke’s performance before taking action. Trading Clarke now would be a gamble, given his measures and entry-level contract, and would become even more so if he blossoms into a franchise defenseman.Also Read: Evander Kane shares heartfelt birthday tribute to finance Mara Teigen Jared McCann talks fade away yet again as the off-season ends.
