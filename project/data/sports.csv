Royal Challengers Bengaluru ( RCB ) will open their home account at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium tonight (April 2) against Gujarat Titans ( GT ).Though the Women’s Premier League (WPL) wrapped up three weeks ago, the ongoing heat and dryness have left the pitches looking browner than usual.RCB, coming off two consecutive wins to start the season, won’t mind this. Such a start has only occurred for the team twice before, in 2014 and 2021.In previous seasons, this notion of no home advantage could have affected RCB. However, this time may be different. Last year, they made a remarkable run to the playoffs, winning three out of their last six games at home consecutively.Also See: RCB vs GT, IPL Live Score 2025 Against the raucous crowd support for RCB, GT will need to explore various combinations. Should Jos Buttler open alongside Shubman Gill to enhance their powerplay?With David Miller not retained and Rahul Tewatia not in his prime hitting form, they risk over-relying on their top order. However, their bowling attack has the potential to deliver. Prasidh Krishna returns home, having played for Karnataka, and Mohammed Siraj returns to a venue that was his IPL home for seven years.Teams haven't dealt with much dew in the last two days. Regarding the pitch, Mo Bobat, RCB's director, anticipates a “typical Bengaluru pitch” that should produce plenty of runs.Notably, the 200-run mark wasn't surpassed in any of the seven knockout matches of the Syed Mushtaq Ali T20s held here in December. The same trend was observed in the seven WPL games, where spinners managed to take advantage of the surface.Royal Challengers Bengaluru probable XI: Virat Kohli, Phil Salt, Devdutt Padikkal, Rajat Patidar (c), Liam Livingstone, Jitesh Sharma (wk), Tim David, Krunal Pandya, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Josh Hazlewood, Yash Dayal.Impact Player: Suyash SharmaGujarat Titans probably XI: Shubman Gill (c), Jos Buttler (wk), Sai Sudharsan, Shahrukh Khan, Sherfane Rutherford, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, Kagiso Rabada, R Sai Kishore, Mohammad Siraj, Prasidh Krishna.Impact Player: Ishant SharmaRoyal Challengers Bengaluru squad: Philip Salt, Virat Kohli, Devdutt Padikkal, Rajat Patidar(c), Liam Livingstone, Jitesh Sharma(w), Tim David, Krunal Pandya, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Josh Hazlewood, Yash Dayal, Suyash Sharma, Rasikh Dar Salam, Manoj Bhandage, Jacob Bethell, Swapnil Singh, Abhinandan Singh, Romario Shepherd, Lungi Ngidi, Nuwan Thushara, Mohit Rathee, Swastik Chikara.Gujarat Titans squad: Sai Sudharsan, Shubman Gill(c), Jos Buttler(w), Shahrukh Khan, Sherfane Rutherford, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, Kagiso Rabada, Ravisrinivasan Sai Kishore, Mohammed Siraj, Prasidh Krishna, Ishant Sharma, Washington Sundar, Glenn Phillips, Anuj Rawat, Mahipal Lomror, Arshad Khan, Jayant Yadav, Nishant Sindhu, Kulwant Khejroliya, Gerald Coetzee, Manav Suthar, Kumar Kushagra, Gurnoor Brar, Karim Janat.Matches played: 5Royal Challengers Bengaluru won: 3Gujarat Titans won: 2Last match: Royal Challengers Bengaluru won by 9 wickets (2024)RCB have three wins out of five against GT but their record at home isn't the best.

Bret Hart , one of the most celebrated WWE heavyweight wrestlers of all time, is often regarded as an idol for wrestlers who reign in the ring currently. The WWE legend has recently grabbed eyeballs after he took a jibe at Hulk Hogan 's wrestling legacy and his impact on modern-day wrestlers.It is true that many wrestlers in the world today in the world of professional wrestling consider Hart as one of the major influences on their career. But, Hart believes that Hulk Hogan does not have much to contribute to today's generation.Hulk Hogan has been in the news recently after his wife, Linda Hogan, opened up about their broken marriage and how they had to separate due to infidelity, abuse, and family rift. The former WWE star has garnered everyone’s attention again after Hart drew a comparison between them.There was a time when Bret Hart and Hulk Hogan stood across each other inside the ring, challenging themselves to a bout. However, it seems that tensions are still flaring between the two veterans related to their in-ring legacy and ego. Let's take a look at Bert Hart's full statement and his take on Hulk Hogan's legacy.After Bret Hart commented on Hulk Hogan ’s wrestling legacy and that it has no impact on today’s generation, tension flared up between the two WWE icons. Hart spoke about it while responding to CM Punk ’s comments, who happens to be a massive fan of the star, on,” which aired on Tuesday, April 2, 2025.In the show, Punk explained why Hart is wrestling's equivalent to Wayne Gretzky’s contribution in hockey or what Michael Jordan was to basketball, which ignited a comparison from Hart between himself and Hogan.This statement led Bret Hart to comment on Hulk Hogan’s legacy and take a jibe at him. Bret stated, “I heard something a few months ago where Hulk Hogan was talking about me, and he said, the problem with Bret Hart is that he does think he was the greatest wrestler of all time.”He further added, ""I remember thinking about that, and going, hmm. Yeah, maybe. That might be the most truthful thing he's ever said.”Bret Hart next went on to say, “Then I think when you watch a lot of the wrestlers today, you don't see anybody imitating Hulk Hogan or Ultimate Warrior. You see a lot of wrestlers today really trying their best to capture my style, or some of the guys that I worked with, like-Dynamite Kid, or Curt Hennig, my brother Owen, and stuff like them. Yeah, they're wrestling my style, and that's the biggest compliment I can get from today's generation.”Bret Hart, in the interview, asserted that the young generation of wrestlers is following his style today, including talents like Dynamite Kid, Curt Hennig, and Owen Hart. He believes that not everybody is imitating Hulk Hogan's style nowadays.This is not the first time Hart has engaged in a professional feud with Hulk Hogan. The long-standing issue between Hart and Hogan date back to 1993's WWE WrestleMania 9. However, the two did manage to work together during Hart’s largely forgettable run in WCW in the late 1990s.Bret Hart was last seen on WWE RAW on September 9, 2024, in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, where he returned to the ring and addressed the fans about the importance of the location and his pride in being a Canadian champion.","Bret hart is one of the most celebrated wwe heavyweight wrestlers of all time.

NEW DELHI: Rohit Sharma shared insights on how his role has evolved over the years within the Mumbai Indians setup, from adapting to new responsibilities to leading the team to multiple titles. He acknowledged that while a lot has changed since he started, his passion and desire to win games and trophies for the franchise remain the same.Rohit has endured his worst IPL start since 2020.

Jalen Brunson’s New York Knicks comeback could be just days away



Jalen Brunson focused on long-term health



New York Knicks finding ways to win without Jalen Brunson



The New York Knicks have been navigating a crucial stretch without their star point guard, Jalen Brunson, who has been sidelined with a right ankle sprain since March 6. Despite missing 13 consecutive games, the team has stayed competitive, posting an 8-5 record in his absence. However, with the postseason rapidly approaching, the focus has shifted to when Brunson will be back on the floor to lead the Knicks in their playoff push . Jalen Brunson ’s return seems to be right around the corner, according to New York Knicks insider Ian Begley. After the team’s 105-91 win over the Philadelphia 76ers on Tuesday, Begley said a Thursday game in Cleveland is probably too soon, but the weekend? That’s looking much more likely.“Jalen Brunson, still working his way back, I think it’s a long shot for him to play at Cleveland the next game. But they have a couple of days off, then they go to Atlanta on Saturday. They’re home against Phoenix on Sunday,” Begley reported. “I think based on the trajectory and everything that’s gone on here, the weekend is a realistic landing spot for Brunson and his return,” Begly said, ""that Atlanta game, that Phoenix game. I think if everything continues to pace with his rehab, that’s the place where you’re looking for Brunson to be back on the court.""The Knicks have two big games this weekend—Saturday in Atlanta and Sunday at home against Phoenix—and that’s when Brunson could finally make his return. With playoff positioning still up for grabs, getting him back now would be huge for New York.Brunson isn’t rushing back just to get on the court—his focus is on being fully ready for the playoffs. Speaking before the Knicks faced the Trail Blazers, he made it clear that health comes first, especially with the intensity of the postseason ahead.“Realistically, I'm hoping to play before the playoffs,” Brunson said. ""It's good for me to get some game reps before we go into that type of stretch run, but the most important thing is trying to be 100 percent healthy.""Brunson is back to basketball activities—sprinting, cutting, and testing his ankle—but he’s not rushing. He’s working with the Knicks’ medical staff to make sure he returns at the right moment.“We’re going to communicate,” Brunson explained. “I never want to put [the medical team] in a position where I’m making the decisions because it’s honestly a team thing. But when I know it's something minor and I know I can play through it, I can play through it.”He added, “I just want to make sure we're on the same page. We’ve been on the same page for the past couple of weeks, and so we're going to continue to progress that way.”The Knicks have managed without Brunson, thanks in part to Landry Shamet . He hit six threes in the win over the Sixers and is averaging 10.3 points on 45% shooting from deep over the last four games.Mitchell Robinson looked strong in his first start of the season Tuesday, posting 14 points, 14 rebounds, and two blocks. After nearly 10 months recovering from ankle surgery, his return is a big lift for the Knicks' defense.Coach Tom Thibodeau credited the team for stepping up, emphasizing that replacing Brunson isn’t a one-man job.“We’ve said this all along – you’re not going to replace Jalen individually,” Thibodeau said. “You have to do it collectively, and I think we’ve done that.”Brunson, while grateful for his teammates’ efforts, is eager to be back.“There have been nights where obviously we didn’t perform well as a team, but then the next day they respond. That’s all we can focus on,” he said. “It sucks. It’s not fun. I really wish I was out there.”Also Read: “Our business is a piece of sh*t”: Michael Wilbon criticizes ESPN and Stephen A. Smith’s obsession with Bronny James The Knicks have stayed competitive without Brunson, but with the playoffs approaching, his return is critical.

If everything stays on track, he’ll be back just in time to guide them into the postseason.","Jalen brunson has been sidelined with a right ankle sprain since march 6.

Dwyane Wade's wife, Gabrielle Union, talks about the feelings she went through as the NBA legend had to undergo surgery



Gabrielle Union Breaks Silence on Dwyane Wade’s Cancer Fight

Dwyane Wade has been married to his wife, famous Hollywood actress Gabrielle Union, for more than a decade, but it seems like the NBA legend faced difficulties in expressing his health battles even to his wife. Recently, Gabrielle Union appeared on an episode of Today with Jenna & Friends, where she spoke about the things she went through as her husband dealt with cancer.On the February episode of Today with Jenna & Friends, Dwyane Wade’s wife, Gabrielle Union, said, “That level of vulnerability, to go through removal of a good chunk of his kidney and the healing that involved, he needed us to be OK with his vulnerability.”She added, “But more than that, he needed to be OK with his vulnerability. It was a challenge to give grace and receive it.”The famous actress, Gabrielle Union, also spoke about the fears she had experienced when the NBA legend had to undergo surgery to remove a major part of his kidney.On the same episode of Today with Jenna & Friends, Gabrielle Union said, “Obviously, him getting that diagnosis was traumatic for him, …But you also don’t understand the journey and the toll it takes on your marriage, on your family, on your kids,”Gabrielle Union has also confessed that there were times when the actress thought the NBA legend was “gone” despite being positive.The NBA legend Dwyane Wade underwent his kidney surgery back in December 2023 but kept things private until he was fully cured and ready to talk about it in public.Dwyane Wade first opened up about his cancer diagnosis on his podcast in January 2025.

When Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost crashed into each other at Suzuka

When Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost worked together

Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost ’s rivalry is counted among the most intense even today. Such was the inter-team competition between the two McLaren drivers that, despite coming from the same team, the McLaren duo clashed with each other at the 1989 Japanese Grand Prix , killing all chances of at least one of them taking the number 1 slot on the podium.One has not seen a rivalry as serious as that of Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost. The tension between them to win at any cost reached an all-time high when they crashed at the Suzuka Circuit in 1989. Prost retired after the crash, and Senna won, only to be disqualified later along with a hefty fine of $100,000 and a six-month ban. Things turned even worse when Senna blamed Prost for the incident.As Formula 1 shared a post to revisit the moment ahead of the upcoming Japanese Grand Prix on April 6, F1 fans were quick to react to the epic moment. Giving a reminder to the current F1 teams, an X user wrote, “F1 teams need to keep this in mind: unhealthy rivalry on the track can cost you everything.” Another reacted, “An iconic moment that changed the season. Suzuka 1989 – unforgettable.” An X user called it “the greatest rivalry in all sports combined.” A comment also read: “Senna vs Prost, the ultimate F1 grudge match.” Some also wrote while remembering Senna, “Miss this legend!”As if this was not enough, their rivalry continued when Prost moved to Ferrari, and the two once again got involved in a similar crash at Suzuka a year later. Senna rammed his car into Prost ahead of him at the 1990 Japanese Grand Prix.Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost were almost unbeatable when they raced for McLaren together and went on to win 15 out of 16 Grand Prix as a team.Senna and Prost had reconciled years after Prost’s retirement in 1993. Prost had once told Canal+ channel, “In the six months before his death, we spoke regularly on the phone, sometimes two or three times a week. He was not the same anymore, he even begged me to come back.”Also read: Here’s how fans at Suzuka make the Japanese Grand Prix the most special race of the year Senna died during the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix at the Imola Circuit in Italy when his car crashed into a barrier.

England's Jos Buttler delivered a match-winning performance with an unbeaten 73 off 39 balls, guiding Gujarat Titans (GT) to a commanding 8-wicket victory over Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) in their IPL 2025 clash on Wednesday.Chasing 170, Gujarat Titans relied on a 75-run second-wicket stand between Buttler and Sai Sudharsan (49 off 36) to overhaul the target with 13 balls to spare at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium.RCB, batting first after Gujarat opted to bowl, struggled against Mohammed Siraj’s impressive spell of 3/19 in four overs. Despite Liam Livingstone’s 54 off 40 balls, RCB could only muster 169/8 in 20 overs.The hosts suffered an early setback when Virat Kohli (7) fell cheaply, caught at deep square leg off Arshad Khan. Siraj then dismantled the top order, dismissing Devdutt Padikkal (4) and Phil Salt (14) in quick succession.With RCB at 42/4, Livingstone and Jitesh Sharma (33 off 21) stitched together a crucial 52-run stand. However, Sai Kishore (2/22) dismissed Jitesh and later sent back Krunal Pandya (5), keeping RCB under pressure.Livingstone fought back, smashing five sixes -- all off Rashid Khan -- but his luck eventually ran out as Siraj dismissed him. Tim David’s quickfire 32 off 18 balls added some late runs, but RCB’s total still seemed below par.Chasing 170, GT started cautiously as Bhuvneshwar Kumar removed skipper Shubman Gill (14) in the fifth over. However, Sudharsan and Buttler stabilized the innings with regular boundaries, shifting the momentum in Gujarat’s favor.Though Josh Hazlewood (1/31) dismissed Sudharsan before he could reach his fifty, Buttler remained composed. Paired with *Sherfane Rutherford (30 off 18)**, he ensured a smooth finish, stitching an unbeaten 63-run stand.Buttler’s five fours and six sixes, including a stunning reverse ramp over the wicketkeeper, kept GT ahead.

Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) has undergone a major transformation for the IPL 2025, with a revamped squad following the auction at the Abadi Al Johar Arena in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. The franchise, still looking for its elusive maiden title, is banking on a combination of fresh faces, experienced talent, and new leadership to break their trophy drought this season.Under the leadership of Rajat Patidar, who has been appointed as the new captain, RCB is determined to rewrite their history and clinch the title that has slipped through their fingers multiple times. The season kicks off with back-to-back wins against Kolkata Knight Riders and Chennai Super Kings. The buzz around their revamped squad has added to the anticipation.RCB's management made some bold moves at the auction to strengthen both their batting and bowling units. The team retained their core players, with Virat Kohli, Rajat Patidar, and Yash Dayal staying put. This strategic decision allowed them to spend significantly and bolster their ranks. With the second-largest purse among the ten IPL franchises, RCB was well-positioned to make big-ticket signings.Notably, RCB splurged on several high-profile players, bringing in the versatile all-rounder Liam Livingstone for ₹8.75 crore, wicketkeeper-batter Phil Salt for ₹11.50 crore, and Indian wicketkeeper Jitesh Sharma for ₹11 crore. These signings have strengthened their batting depth considerably, offering flexibility in both attack and defence.In the bowling department, RCB made strategic acquisitions to add experience and firepower. Australian pacer Josh Hazelwood returned to RCB for ₹12.50 crore, bringing valuable leadership to the pace attack. Alongside him, Bhuvneshwar Kumar was signed for ₹10.75 crore, adding another layer of skill and experience. To complement their fast bowling attack, RCB also secured young Indian spinner Suyash Sharma for ₹2.60 crore, rounding out their bowling resources with depth and variety.Andy Flower, RCB's director of cricket, expressed satisfaction with the squad's construction, emphasising the importance of balance in both the batting and bowling departments. ""It was really great to get Bhuvi today. That level of skill, along with Krunal’s capabilities, will complement Hazelwood's return to RCB. His experience will be invaluable. Yash Dayal showed his potential last year, and we also have Rasikh, who is competing for a spot,"" Flower remarked. ""We’re thrilled with the skill we’ve secured, especially with the level of expertise we’ve added to the squad. We’re feeling very positive about where we stand at the moment.""RCB will be hoping that the infusion of fresh talent, a new captain, and an all-around stronger squad will propel them to their first-ever IPL title in 2025.With an exciting squad at their disposal, RCB is ready to embark on what promises to be an electrifying IPL 2025 season. The stage is set, and all eyes will be on the team as they chase their dream of lifting the coveted IPL trophy.","Royal challengers bangalore (rcb) has undergone a major transformation for the ipl 2025, with a revamped squad following the auction at the abadi al johar arena in jeddah, saudi arabia.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan’s leg-spinner Abrar Ahmed has found himself in the spotlight once again -- this time not for his bowling but for a light-hearted confrontation with a fan following a controversial send-off to India’s Shubman Gill during the ICC Champions Trophy 2025.In a viral video circulating on social media, a passionate fan confronted Abrar during Pakistan’s series against New Zealand, questioning his antics against Gill.Watch:The incident occurred when Pakistan was facing New Zealand in the second ODI at Seddon Park.Also See: IPL Live Score, RCB vs GT A female fan confronted Abrar Ahmed -- who was not in the playing XI -- on the sidelines of the match, questioning his controversial send-off to Shubman Gill. ""What were you signaling to Shubman Gill?"" she demanded.Though the words weren’t clearly audible in the clip, Abrar’s awkward reaction and nervous smile indicated he was caught off guard.This confrontation stemmed from an intense moment in the India vs Pakistan clash in the Champions Trophy group stage.During that match, Abrar produced a stunning leg-break to castle a well-set Shubman Gill for 46. However, it was his animated send-off, gesturing Gill to walk off that sparked controversy among Indian fans.Virat Kohli, at the non-striker’s end, was visibly surprised by the dismissal and the send-off.While Abrar celebrated, social media erupted, with memes and jokes mocking the Pakistani spinner for his over-the-top reaction.Many fans felt his behavior was unnecessary, especially since India comfortably chased down Pakistan’s 241-run total, thanks to Kohli’s brilliant unbeaten century (100 not out off 111 balls).Meanwhile, Pakistan’s form in ODIs hasn’t been promising. Against New Zealand, they suffered an 84-run defeat, handing the Kiwis an unassailable 2-0 series lead.Pakistan’s top order collapsed, with Babar Azam (1), Abdullah Shafique (1), and Imam-ul-Haq (3) falling inside six overs.A valiant half-century from Naseem Shah and a fighting knock from Faheem Ashraf weren’t enough to save them from yet another defeat.","Pakistan leg-spinner abrar ahmed in spotlight for light-hearted confrontation with a fan.

IPL | Punjab Kings' Suryansh Shedge: From playing under Shreyas to dreaming of meeting Kohli

Nehal Wadhera made an unexpected, but impactful, debut for Punjab Kings , scoring an unbeaten 43 off 25 balls to help secure an eight-wicket victory over Lucknow Super Giants in an Indian Premier League match in Lucknow on Tuesday (April 1). The left-handed batter's performance, which included three boundaries and four sixes, was particularly noteworthy as he was informed about his selection just moments before the game.""I didn't know I would be playing. I only brought one kit because I was sure I wouldn't be in the XI. Normally, I carry two--one for batting and another for fielding. I even came in full sleeves,"" Wadhera revealed in the post-match press conference.""Sometimes, things work in your favour. If I had known earlier, I might have overthought it...this was one of those days when I was lucky that I did not know that I would be playing, and it turned out to be lucky for me,"" he added.""Ricky (Ponting) came up to me and said, 'If we bowl first, you'll be in the eleven.' I was a bit surprised and kept thinking, 'How can I be in the XI just because we're bowling first?' I thought maybe he made a mistake,"" Wadhera recalled.""Once the playing XI was announced, I realized I was in. That's why I only started warming up around the 11th or 12th over, knowing I might have to field,"" he noted.Lucknow Super Giants, batting first, struggled early at 35/3 but managed to post a competitive total thanks to Nicholas Pooran's 44 off 30 balls and Ayush Badoni's 41 off 33 balls. Abdul Samad contributed with a quick 27 off 12 balls.Arshdeep Singh was the standout bowler for Punjab Kings, taking three wickets for 43 runs. Marco Jansen, Lockie Ferguson, Glenn Maxwell, and Yuzvendra Chahal also picked up wickets.In the chase, Punjab Kings lost Priyansh Arya early for 8 runs. However, Prabhsimran Singh's explosive 69 off 34 balls, along with captain Shreyas Iyer 's unbeaten 52 off 30 balls and Wadhera's 43 not out, guided the team to victory with 22 balls remaining.Digvesh Rathi's bowling effort of 2/30 in four overs for Lucknow Super Giants proved insufficient to defend their total.The victory propelled Punjab Kings to the second position in the points table with two wins in two matches, while Lucknow Super Giants dropped to sixth place with one win and two losses.","Punjab kings beat lucknow super giants by eight wickets in indian premier league match.

Bombay Sport Exchange Episode 1: Interview with Sanjog Gupta, CEO (Sports) at JioStar

Mumbai: In a stunning, massive development, India's Test opener Yashasvi Jaiswal has decided to quit Mumbai and move to Goa. The 23-year-old will captain Goa in the 2025-26 season.On Tuesday, Jaiswal wrote an email to the Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA) seeking a No Objection Certificate (NOC) to change his cricket state team from Mumbai to Goa from the next season onwards. The MCA subsequently granted him the NOC.“He wrote an e-mail to us, seeking an NOC from the MCA to represent Goa next season. We’ve accepted his request,” Abhay Hadap MCA secretary told TOI.In his email to the MCA seeking transfer to Goa from Mumbai, Jaiswal has communicated, ""I have had the privilege of representing Mumbai in domestic cricket and have immensely benefited from the opportunities provided by the association. However, after careful consideration of my career aspirations and personal circumstances, I have decided to seek a transfer to Goa to continue my domestic cricket journey. I assure you that this decision is made in good faith and with due respect to the association that has supported my development. I am willing to comply with all necessary formalities as per the BCCI’s player transfer regulations and will ensure a smooth transition.""""Thank you for your support and guidance throughout my time with Mumbai. I sincerely appreciate all the opportunities given to me and hope to maintain a positive relationship with the association in the future.""Also See: IPL Live Score, RCB vs GT Meanwhile, BCCI jt secretary Rohan Desai, who was the secretary of the Goa Cricket Association till recently, told this paper, “It’s a great development for Goan cricket. Goa’s cricketers, especially the youngsters, will get to learn a lot from Jaiswal , who is a part of India’s Test team. It’s a blessing in disguise that a player of his stature will be a part of Goa’s dressing room. It’s a good decision by the GCA management, especially Shambha Desai, the secretary of the GCA to include Yashasvi in the squad. I’m looking forward to an exciting season for Goa.”Jaiswal made his first-class debut for Mumbai at the Wankhede Stadium in Jan 2019 against Chhattisgarh in a Ranji Trophy match, and has scored a majority of his 3712 first-class runs, including 12 hundreds and 12 fifties, in 36 matches for Mumbai. It was his sizzling performances for Mumbai that brought the dashing left-hander into the national reckoning. In Oct 2019, Jaiswal became the youngest man to hit a one-day double century, when, at the age of just 17, he smashed 203 off 154 balls against Jharkhand in the Vijay Hazare Trophy. In June 2022, the left-hander stroked twin hundreds (100 & 181) against Uttar Pradesh in the Ranji Trophy, and didn’t look back.In recent years, Mumbai players like Arjun Tendulkar, Siddhesh Lad and Eknath Kerkar have played for Goa.After the BCCI’s directive to the players to turn out for their state teams in domestic cricket, Jaiswal played in a Ranji Trophy match for Mumbai in the Ranji Trophy in the 2024-25 season, scoring 4 & 26 in the five-wicket defeat to Jammu & Kashmir at the MCA ground in BKC in Mumbai in Jan this year. Left out of India’s Champions Trophy squad but included in the list of non-travelling substitutes, the left-hander was drafted into the Mumbai Ranji squad ahead of their semifinal clash with Vidarbha in Nagpur on February 17. However, he had to pull out of the match just a day before the game due to pain in his ankle.Even though he belongs to the Bhadohi village in Uttar Pradesh, Jaiswal has a deep emotional connection with Mumbai, where he has played all his cricket till now in life. As a kid, he used to sleep in the Muslim United SC tent at the Azad Maidan and sometimes sell panipuris in the evening to make a living, before his childhood coach/mentor Jwala Singh took him to his home in Santa Cruz. In 2015, former India skipper Dilip Vengsarkar took Jaiswal to the UK for an exposure tour with his academy team. Jaiswal first attracted attention by making huge scores for the Rizvi Springfield School in the Harris Shield (inter-school competition for Under-16), and then did well for the Mumbai Under-16, Under-19 and Under-23 teams, before being picked for the Mumbai senior team.Jaiswal has currently been struggling for form while playing for the Rajasthan Royals in IPL-2025, where he has managed to score only 34 runs in three matches@11.33, with a strike rate of 106.25. The youngster was one of the standout performers for India in the 2024-25 Border-Gavaskar Trophy, where he scored 391 runs in five Tests@43.44, with one century and two half-centuries.",India's test opener yashasvi jaiswal has decided to quit mumbai and move to goa.

Poor bowling in Powerplay too

KOLKATA: In a repeat of last year’s Indian Premier League (IPL) title clash, the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) will lock horns with Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) at the Eden Gardens here on Thursday. But it has been a harsh reality check for both sides after the IPL mega auction as they have failed to replicate last year’s success so far.With two losses each in the first three games, KKR and SRH find themselves languishing at the bottom half of the points table. It’s still early days and there’s no immediate need to press the panic button, but both sides will be desperate to get their campaign back on track sooner than later.For that to happen, both teams need to get their opening acts right.Much of KKR and SRH’s success in the last season can be attributed to their openers. The sides feature prominently among IPL’s all-time highest Powerplay scorers. While SRH occupy the top two slots, putting up 125/0 (vs DC in 2024) and 107/0 (vs LSG in 2024), KKR are third with a score of 105/0 vs RCB in 2017.Gautam Gambhir pushing Sunil Narine up the order put the wind in KKR’s sails after they tried out as many as 14 different opening combinations across the 2022-23 seasons. After last year’s auction, though, KKR got a new opening duo, with Quinton de Kock replacing Phil Salt as Narine’s partner.Although Narine got 44 in the first match and De Kock hit 97 in the team’s winning cause against Rajasthan Royals, KKR have failed to put their rivals under scoreboard pressure, with scores of 60/1, 40/0 and 41/4 in three games -- the season’s lowest first-innings Powerplay scores.Last year the KKR’s opening pair was so dominant and the middle-order so consistent that they didn’t have to rely on finishers in most of their matches. No wonder Knights’ rising star Rinku Singh got to play only 113 balls last season when KKR lost only thrice.SRH began from where they left last year getting 94/1 in the Powerplay against Rajasthan Royals in their opening match at home. But since then, they have been left searching for that impactful start getting 62/2 and 58/4 in the next two games.The Orange Army has also lost regular wickets (seven so far), much like KKR, who had lost five wickets in the first six overs, which halted their progress. Although Travis Head looked dangerous at times, youngster Abhishek Sharma is yet to fire.With big-hitters like Ishan Kishan and Henrick Klaasen to follow, a brisk start can set the tone for SRH batters to take the game away from any opposition.To make matters worse, both the sides have failed to make early inroads while bowling too. They have allowed their oppositions to get off the block fast and thus lost control of proceedings.KKR bowlers have conceded 80, 54 and 65 runs while managing just two wickets in the first six overs, SRH bowlers too have proved expensive -- giving away 77, 77 and 52 runs, claiming four wickets.It’s time to get the right start in both the departments now.",Kolkata knight riders face sunrisers hyderabad in repeat of last year's title clash. Both sides have failed to replicate last year’s success so far. Kkr and srh find themselves languishing at the bottom half of the points table.

Ja Morant under NBA investigation for controversial gesture toward Golden State Warriors,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/ja-morant-under-nba-investigation-for-controversial-gesture-toward-golden-state-warriors-bench/articleshow/119925689.cms,"Ja Morant.

The NBA is investigating Ja Morant’s hand gun gesture



Memphis Grizzlies star Ja Morant is once again at the center of controversy, as the NBA has launched an investigation into a gesture he made during Tuesday night’s game against the Golden State Warriors. With less than 21 seconds left in the fourth quarter of the Grizzlies’ 134-125 loss, Morant appeared to make a finger-gun motion toward the Warriors’ bench. The action immediately drew reactions from Warriors stars Stephen Curry and Draymond Green. The NBA is also reviewing a similar gesture made by Golden State’s Buddy Hield, who directed a finger-gun motion at Morant earlier in the game. Both players were assessed technical fouls on the spot.It was not the first time Ja Morant faced punishment for the same, it was also not the second. The 24-year-old guard has already served two suspensions for flashing a gun on social media— an eight-game suspension in March 2023 after a nightclub incident in Colorado and a 25-game suspension later that year for a similar offense.ESPN’s Brian Windhorst weighed in on the situation, linking it to broader concerns about Morant’s standing with the Grizzlies. ""Look, there has been noise about Ja being unhappy all season long,"" Windhorst said on The Hoop Collective Podcast. ""There has been noise about, ‘Hey, could Memphis look to move Ja this summer? Could Ja look to get out of Memphis this summer? Could Ja look to force a trade, or at least request a trade?’” Windhorst suggested that the recent firing of head coach Taylor Jenkins may have been a strategic move to keep Morant satisfied in Memphis, as the franchise works to retain its star player amid ongoing speculation about his future.The Grizzlies are clinging to the No. 6 seed in the Western Conference playoff race. Morant’s return from injury had been a much-needed boost, but another suspension could severely impact the team’s postseason hopes.Fox Sports analysts Mike Harmon and Aaron Torres also discussed the situation. ""A guy who's been in trouble with the league before, and well, I got a feeling we’re not going to see him on the court for the rest of the regular season and probably the postseason. And that’s Ja Morant,"" Harmon said. ""I’m always happy to give a guy a second chance if it’s nothing violent or criminal, but this guy just has none of it.""The league has broad discretion in handling disciplinary matters, as outlined in its constitution, which grants Commissioner Adam Silver the authority to impose fines or suspensions for actions deemed ""prejudicial to or against the best interests of the Association.""As for Morant’s response after the news of the investigation, he took to X to share his thoughts on the matter, “ja this .. ja that .. 😂,” he wrote laughing off the whole ordeal.Also Read: J a Morant's late-game finger gun gesture sparks controversy as Memphis Grizzlies drop fourth straight game While the NBA has yet to announce a final decision, this latest controversy adds to the growing concern over Morant’s ability to mature and avoid self-inflicted setbacks. With his talent undeniable but his judgment repeatedly called into question, the Grizzlies and the NBA face yet another difficult decision regarding his future.","Memphis grizzlies star ja morant is once again at the center of controversy. The nba has launched an investigation into a gesture he made during tuesday night’s game against the golden state warriors. With less than 21 seconds left in the fourth quarter of the grizzlies’ 134-125 loss, morant appeared to make a finger-gun motion.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119925762,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-46528,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

NEW DELHI: When Jos Buttler gets going, the opposition is left searching for answers. Scoop, reverse scoop, pull, straight drive, cut, flick—every shot in the book was on display as he dismantled Royal Challengers Bengaluru. Gujarat Titans stormed to an eight-wicket victory, riding on Buttler’s batting masterclass.The Englishman dictated the chase with a blistering 73 off just 39 balls at a strike rate of 187.18. His knock, studded with nine boundaries and three sixes, left the RCB bowlers clueless.After the early dismissal of Shubman Gill, Buttler and Sai Sudharsan stitched a crucial 75-run partnership. Sudharsan contributed a steady 49 off 36 balls, ensuring GT stayed on course. Once Sudharsan fell, Buttler pressed the accelerator, taking GT home with 13 balls to spare and stamping his authority on the chase.Earlier, RCB struggled to find rhythm, posting 169/8 in 20 overs. Their innings never really took off, as GT’s bowlers struck at regular intervals. The early dismissals of Virat Kohli (7) and Devdutt Padikkal (4) put them on the back foot. Phil Salt (14) and Rajat Patidar (12) also failed to capitalize, leaving RCB tottering at 42/4 inside six overs. Liam Livingstone offered some resistance, smashing 54 off 40 balls, including five fours and three sixes. Jitesh Sharma (33 off 21) provided a quick cameo, but GT’s bowlers kept the pressure on. Sai Kishore (2/22) and Mohammed Siraj (3/19) were outstanding, never allowing RCB to settle. Tim David’s brisk 32 off 18 lifted RCB to 169, but it was always going to be a tough total to defend.In response, GT started cautiously, with Gill departing for 14. However, Buttler and Sudharsan took control, finding regular boundaries to keep the chase on track. After Sudharsan’s dismissal, Sherfane Rutherford (30* off 18) joined Buttler, and their unbeaten 63-run stand sealed the win in style.With this victory, GT climbed to fourth place in the points table, while RCB slipped to third, facing another setback in their campaign.",Gujarat titans beat royal challengers bengaluru by eight wickets.
