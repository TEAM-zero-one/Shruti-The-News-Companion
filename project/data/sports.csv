Vancouver Canucks sign Pierre-Olivier Joseph to shore up defense corps

“Pierre-Olivier has good speed and mobility and will add to our depth on the back end,”

“His addition gives us a player with some solid NHL and pro hockey experience, he is comfortable playing both sides, and he won a world championship with Tyler Myers in 2023. We look forward to getting him here to start working with our group.”

From draft pick to international gold

The Vancouver Canucks have kept up the rebuilding process on their roster by signing defenseman Pierre-Olivier Joseph to a one-year contract worth $775,000. The signing was announced by general manager Patrik Allvin on Wednesday. Joseph adds more depth and experience to the Canucks' blue line with proven NHL ability and success internationally. He played split last season between the Pittsburgh Penguins and St. Louis Blues.Pierre-Olivier Joseph played 47 NHL games last year, picking up three assists and spending an average of 15 minutes per game on the ice. He stands at 6-foot-2 and 185 pounds and is 26 years old, bringing size and agility that Canucks officials think will complement their existing defensive crew.Allvin said in a release.Joseph's versatility makes him capable of playing in Vancouver or for the Abbotsford Canucks in the AHL when necessary.His arrival is forecasted to bring additional competition for roster spots coming into training camp.Originally drafted 23rd overall by the Arizona Coyotes in the 2017 NHL Draft, Joseph was traded to the Penguins in 2019 as part of a trade that saw Phil Kessel go to Arizona. In Pittsburgh, he became a steady depth defenseman before ultimately making his NHL debut for the team.Last year, Joseph signed with St. Louis to play together with his brother Mathieu, but he was traded back to Pittsburgh in December for future considerations. Altogether, he's appeared in 194 NHL games, scoring eight goals and 40 points.Joseph also gained international accolades when he assisted Team Canada in capturing gold at the 2023 IIHF World Championship, recording one goal and a plus-6 rating in 10 games.In the addition of Pierre-Olivier Joseph, the Canucks have gotten a reliable, adaptive defenseman who adds both NHL exposure and a winning background. His signing is likely to bolster the blue line as the Canucks look to improve the roster for next season.Also Read: K’Andre Miller signs $60 million deal, credits his mom for making his NHL dream possible","Vancouver canucks sign pierre-olivier joseph to a one-year contract worth $775,000.

Taylor Swift distances from Blake and It Ends With Us while finding peace with Travis Kelce

What was once one of Hollywood’s most adored friendships has reportedly come to a dramatic end. Taylor Swift and Blake Lively, once inseparable on vacations, red carpets, and NFL game nights, are no longer on speaking terms. According to a revealing Page Six report, the collapse of their relationship stems from a $400 million lawsuit involving Blake’s It Ends With Us co-star Justin Baldoni — and Swift is now leaning on her boyfriend, NFL star Travis Kelce, for support during the fallout.The legal dispute exposed private texts where Blake Lively referred to Taylor Swift and Ryan Reynolds as her “dragons,” comparing herself to Khaleesi from Game of Thrones. This comment — made in the context of her legal dispute — reportedly outraged Swift, who felt blindsided and misrepresented.“She will forever be furious at how Blake quite clearly was using her for clout and leverage in her dealings with Justin,” a source close to Swift told Page Six. “She really hates that Blake would even think like that, let alone write the things she did in that text.”While Taylor Swift had previously licensed her song My Tears Ricochet for the film’s soundtrack, she never promoted the movie — even before the legal mess surfaced.Sources say that wasn’t by accident. Swift reportedly saw the friendship as casual and low-pressure, not one where she’d be expected to get involved in someone else's legal fight.“The truth is, the text wasn’t even accurate,” the insider said. “That’s not the kind of friendship they ever had—Taylor would never think of herself as Blake’s ‘dragon.’”Amid the public drama, insiders say Swift has found grounding and reassurance in her romance with Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce. The couple, who’ve become one of pop culture’s most watched pairs, have been spending more time together during Swift’s Eras Tour breaks.“Travis has been a calming presence for Taylor,” one entertainment insider shared privately. “She’s leaned on him throughout this entire fallout with Blake Lively. He gets the pressure she’s under and doesn’t ask anything from her except honesty and time.”“They were baking pals, travel pals, home decor pals… and to be totally honest, billionaire pals,” the source added. “It was nice to be with someone else who ‘gets it’.”Now, with the friendship fractured and the legal dust settling, Swift is said to be moving forward with a smaller, tighter circle — one where trust isn’t just assumed, but earned. “Taylor buries hatchets but keeps maps of where she put them,” the source added, quoting Swift’s lyric from End Game.Also Read: “Pleading for forgiveness”:Blake Lively refuses to let Taylor Swift cut her off as Travis Kelce quietly sides with the his lady love For Taylor Swift, who’s finally reclaimed the rights to her early music and continues to dominate stadiums worldwide, it’s a new chapter — one where Travis Kelce, not Blake Lively, plays the leading role beside her.The couple's high-profile romance has become a cultural phenomenon, blending pop superstardom with NFL fame, and giving fans a real-life fairytale to follow.","Taylor swift and blake lively are no longer on speaking terms, according to a report.

Kevin Durant and Steve Nash expose growing disadvantages for small guards in today’s evolving NBA



The Kevin Durant Interview (Part 1) | LeBron James & Steve Nash | MIND THE GAME

The NBA has seen a dramatic shift in how teams value certain skill sets, and the modern game may be pushing small guards toward the margins. In a candid discussion on the Mind the Game podcast, Kevin Durant and Hall of Famer Steve Nash discussed the challenges that undersized guards face in today's positionless, switch-heavy league. With playoff success depending more and more on defensive versatility, even talented scorers under 6'2"" are struggling to stay impactful on the floor.Kevin Durant, now with the Houston Rockets, didn’t hold back when speaking on how the league is evolving. “I don't know if the 6'2 and under guard is at a premium no more as a starter,” he said. “Maybe as a backup.” His comments reflect a growing sentiment among players and analysts. In today’s scenario, the game is too focused on size and defense for smaller guards to thrive without exceptional tools.Steve Nash agreed but pointed out that only certain body types and playing styles now make the cut. “It’s that either Donovan Mitchell, Jrue Holiday 6'3, Lou Dort,” Nash said. “Or it’s, nah, you got to be (bigger).”Durant expanded on that thought with a harsh truth. “You can't get picked on on defense,” he said.“That's the thing. Because we're playing such a pick on game that they will literally — if you can't guard — they will bring you up every play. If you're 6'0, 6'1 and you're not a bulldog like Davion Mitchell, Jrue Holiday on the defensive side or you're not an offensive flat out savant like Kyrie (Irving) where you can score on dudes that's 7'0 easily in ISO, then I just can't see it. ”Their conversation shifted to Cleveland Cavaliers guard Darius Garland, a skilled offensive player who was often targeted on defense during the postseason. Nash praised Garland’s game, saying, “He's an amazing basketball player. We don't talk about him as this amazing (player) because of the era. If he played in any other era, I think his value would be through the roof. He's that skilled. He's water bug. He's got every shot. He can playmake, but it’s an era where you also have to help that dude out defensively all the time.”Durant agreed with Nash’s points but added, “If you want a chance to beat the Cleveland Cavaliers, you are going at Darius Garland most the time on the defensive side. That’s not saying he's going to get scored on every time. He's just small.”Also Read: NBA analyst drops bombshell comments on LeBron James and Luka Doncic chemistry: “This is Luka’s team now” Durant used Orlando’s Paolo Banchero, a 6'10"" offensive mismatch, as an example of the type of players that exploit smaller defenders.

Florida Panthers re-sign Marchand, Bennett and Ekblad Despite NHL free agency speculation

Bill Zito: Florida Panthers GM Talks Signing the Big 3, Free Agency, Where He’s Taking the Cup

The Florida Panthers have successfully retained Brad Marchand, Sam Bennett, and Aaron Ekblad before the 2025 NHL free agency window opened. With just $19 million in available cap space, GM Bill Zito faced serious doubts. But the Panthers managed to secure long-term deals with their core stars, though not without losing important contributors from their championship-winning roster.Despite public skepticism, GM Bill Zito stayed true to his word about spending to the NHL salary cap to keep his core intact. Brad Marchand, coming off a Conn Smythe-winning postseason, signed a six-year deal worth $5.25 million annually. Sam Bennett agreed to an $8 million AAV deal, while defenseman Aaron Ekblad committed to an eight-year extension.Marchand and Bennett were both linked to the Toronto Maple Leafs during early speculation, while reports also suggested the Boston Bruins were interested in bringing Marchand back. Ekblad was rumored to be a target for the Utah Mammoth. But all three made their intention clear—they wanted to stay in Florida.Zito downplayed his role in the deals, saying it was the players who made the choice. “It was those guys,” he told reporters.The front office's ability to retain its core sets the Panthers up to challenge for a third straight Stanley Cup.The Panthers lost two key depth players—Nico Sturm and Nate Schmidt—who played important roles in their 2025 Cup run. Sturm, a two-time Stanley Cup champion, returned to the Minnesota Wild, the team where he began his NHL career. Schmidt signed a three-year, $10.5 million contract with the Utah Mammoth after joining Florida on a one-year, $800,000 deal.Both losses hurt Florida’s depth, but the top-heavy strategy reflects a win-now mindset. The Panthers are aiming to become the first team in the salary cap era to win three straight Stanley Cups. Only the Pittsburgh Penguins (2009, 2016, 2017) and Chicago Blackhawks (2010, 2013, 2015) have won three during this period—though never in consecutive years.Also Read: Alex Delvecchio, Detroit Red Wings legend and 3-time Stanley Cup champion, dies at 93 The Panthers’ cap management, star loyalty, and proven leadership give them a real shot at history, even if depth remains a question heading into the 2025–26 season.","Florida panthers re-sign brad marchand, sam bennett, and aaron ekblad.

Former NBA star Scottie Pippen’s ex-wife, Larsa Pippen, is a desirable woman. Her colorful dating life after her divorce from the NBA legend in 2021 is the legit proof. However, not all her dating choices were apt. She admitted the same in one of her old interviews with Jason Lee. The man in question was Malik Beasley, the Detroit Pistons guard.During the interview, Jason reminded Larsa that he had warned against dating Beasley. She readily agreed, but went on to clarify, saying:“I had COVID brain. I just had COVID. I was stuck in my house; I hadn't gone anywhere. He was there.

She credited her virtues for being the center of attraction among men. Talking about why she gets so much attention, Larsa said:“I feel like guys like me...

Additionally more than 775,000 people were excited to come to Detroit for the 2024 NFL draft. Detroit is a sports town. We’re sure we’ll see the same excitement for the WNBA returning. ”The City of Cleveland admins also sprang into action and reposted Caitlin Clark’s response from 2024, where she was seen praising the city. They tweeted:“Sophie, your teammate doesn’t seem to think Cleveland is too bad!We’re proud to have been chosen to host a WNBA team, and any player who comes here will feel that legendary passion Cleveland sports fans show our teams!”Sophie Cunningham had her list of cities ready, which she thought would be suitable destinations for the WNBA’s expansion. However, while doing so, she put Detroit and Cleveland off her list of preferred locations. She said:“Miami would have been a great one. Everyone loves Florida. Nashville is an amazing city. Kansas City, amazing opportunity. There’s a huge arena downtown (Sprint Center) that no one’s using. And I think the women’s soccer league (in Kansas City) is showing that people draw.”It was the concluding part that caught people’s attention.

NBA analyst drops bombshell comments on LeBron James and Luka Doncic chemistry: “This is Luka’s team now”,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/nba-analyst-drops-bombshell-comments-on-lebron-james-and-luka-doncic-chemistry-this-is-lukas-team-now/articleshow/122207740.cms,"LeBron James and Luka Doncic.

Los Angeles Lakers face power shift as NBA analyst questions LeBron James– Luka Doncic chemistry



In a dramatic turn of events in Los Angeles, an NBA analyst, John Gambadoro, has stirred the pot by claiming LeBron James is no longer the centerpiece of the Lakers. The statement comes just days after LeBron opted into his $52.6 million player option for the 2025–26 season. While fans expected this to signal yet another championship push with the purple and gold, whispers around the league suggest a power shift is underway, with Luka Doncic emerging as the new alpha in town. The analyst further teased that James does not like playing with Doncic.The moment the Los Angeles Lakers landed Luka Doncic, the direction of the franchise started to shift. And now, with LeBron entering his 23rd NBA season, that shift is becoming harder to ignore.On “The Burns and Gambo Show,” analyst John Gambadoro claimed, “LeBron does not like playing with Luka. Reeves does not like playing with Luka. Reeves does not like getting the ball with two seconds left on the shot clock. LeBron is not fond of playing with Luka. The Lakers are going to turn their attention to building around Luka, not LeBron.”Gambadoro’s claim adds weight to what has been building over time. Despite James averaging an impressive 24.4 points and 8.2 assists at age 40 last season, the organization seems less committed to a long-term future with him.ESPN’s Ramona Shelburne echoed that, noting the Lakers didn’t even sit down with James this summer to discuss an extension. “That means that it’s not in his control with the Los Angeles Lakers. That was a statement, even though they didn’t make a statement,” she said on air.That growing uncertainty hasn’t gone unnoticed. Brian Windhorst highlighted the gravity of the situation: “For the first time in 23 years, he’s not the franchise player.” The tone is clear as the Lakers are laying the groundwork for a Luka-centric team, not one centered around James.About on-court chemistry, that remains a work in progress. Luka himself recently told the Mind the Game podcast, “He’s been playing unbelievable, and I think it’s still a work in progress. You know, I think we’re getting better and better every day.” LeBron, too, praised the duo’s growth publicly. Yet the eye test and recent reports suggest the transition may not be seamless.Also Read: LeBron James once made Jayson Tatum cry, and it was not on court Of course, the Lakers are looking for a long-term future, and considering LeBron’s age, he is far from leading the franchise despite already acquiring the legendary status and playing at an elite level.","Los angeles lakers face power shift as nba analyst questions lebron james– luka doncic chemistry.

A Browns fan screamed “We own you” at Joe Burrow while he walked, and the video sparked outrage



“The Browns own you, bro! The Browns own you!”

NFL fans are defending Joe Burrow and calling out the Browns fan for going too far



NFL fans furious after Browns fan verbally attacks Joe Burrow in public. X

There’s rivalry, and then there’s straight-up harassment and unfortunately, Joe Burrow just experienced the second one. The Bengals superstar quarterback was out at night, minding his own business, when a Cleveland Browns fan spotted him and began heckling. Not playful trash talk. Just loud, repeated yelling.Burrow, classy as ever, didn’t even react. But the moment quickly went viral and fans across the league are calling it disgusting.The video, shared online shows Burrow walking with his security when a Browns fan starts taunting him loudly and relentlessly. It’s unclear where the incident happened, but the fan repeatedly yells,Burrow doesn’t stop, doesn’t respond, and doesn’t even look at the guy. His security team, though, makes their stance clear, telling the fan to back off.The clip has since gone viral, and while some found it amusing, the overwhelming majority of fans were shocked not just at what was said, but at where and how it was said.Trash talk between AFC North fans is nothing new but this felt different. Bengals fans rushed to Burrow’s defense online, praising his calm and blasting the fan for being obnoxious.Even some Browns fans chimed in, saying it was cringe and disrespectful. The general consensus? This isn’t sports rivalry, it’s just weird.There’s a difference between passionate fandom and crossing personal boundariesRivalries fuel the NFL. Browns vs. Bengals has always been intense, and sure Burrow hasn’t had the best win record against Cleveland. But there’s a big difference between what happens inside the stadium and what fans do on the street.Players, like anyone else, deserve privacy and peace when they’re off the clock. Harassing someone with a phone out and shouting in their face isn’t “supporting your team”, it’s just bad behavior.This moment isn’t just about one fan or one team. It’s part of a bigger problem where players get treated like public property, not people.Despite the taunting, Burrow didn’t flinch. He didn’t clap back. He didn’t escalate. He just kept walking like it didn’t even phase him.Also read - Stefon Diggs trains like a beast even while vacationing in a castle with Cardi B",Bengals quarterback joe burrow was harassed by a browns fan.

Cheng Hao’s AI robot football sparks revolutionary shift in sports with historic Beijing match,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/international-sports/cheng-haos-ai-robot-football-sparks-revolutionary-shift-in-sports-with-historic-beijing-match/articleshow/122206199.cms,"How Cheng Hao’s AI robots made football history in Beijing despite struggles

On Saturday June 29, 2025, history was made in Beijing, China. This was not just any ordinary football match as there were no humans involved. Four teams of AI humanoid robots were competing for the first time in a three-a-side football tournament. This competitive appearance was vital for the robots' sports capability and moreover it gave the world knowledge that sport is changing and AI is having an influence. However, things did look futuristic and moving in that direction, the match did demonstrate how far robots have to go.Booster Robotics, a tech firm run by Cheng Hao, organized an AI robotic football match in a stadium in Beijing, China. The teams were humanoid robots developed by university students. Each team controlled the robots using their own software in order for the robots to move, pass, and kick a ball.While the idea was exciting, the match had many funny moments. The robots fell down often, missed easy kicks, and even needed help standing up again. Some robots were removed from the match after failing to get back on their feet.Still, Cheng Hao saw it as a big step forward. He said, “In the future, we may arrange for robots to play football with humans.That means we must ensure the robots are completely safe.”Tsinghua University’s AI robots claim world’s first robot football championshipThe final AI robot football match was played between Tsinghua University’s THU Robotics team and China Agricultural University’s Mountain Sea team. The exciting final ended with a 5–3 victory for Tsinghua, who became the first robot football champions. A student from the winning side said, “They did really well, but the Mountain Sea team also gave us a surprise.”Subramanian Ramamoorthy , a professor at the University of Edinburgh, said that the robots were as good as the robots being demonstrated at the RoboCup competitions, and they were getting better each year.The demonstration confirmed that robots are in no position to replace human players similar to Kylian Mbappe, but getting better each game. The mix of AI, football, and robotics is now a real thing, and it’s just getting started.","Four teams of ai humanoid robots were competing for the first time in a three-a-side football tournament.

Bronny James on LeBron James’ retirement plans



LeBron James kept the media and his fans speculating about his retirement for months after the Los Angeles Lakers’ exit from the playoffs. But what has come as a complete shock is a social media post by NBA Central which claims it’s his son and teammate Bronny James who has announced his retirement. While the trolls celebrated the announcement, it doesn’t seem as it looks. Bronny is still very much a part of the NBA, but there is a slight twist to it.A post shared on NBA Central’s X account on Tuesday read: “BREAKING: Bronny James announces his retirement from the NBA.” This was followed by several harsh comments as many celebrated his retirement.But the aspiring footballer will probably be more encouraged to prove his best as he now gears up to represent the Los Angeles Lakers in Summer League in order to be better prepared to play alongside his father once again. The NBA Summer League mostly sees the participation of rookies and other young players to polish them further before they get a chance to play alongside the legends and veterans of the NBA in the regular season.Bronny James, 20, fulfilled his father LeBron James’ dream of playing together on the same team when he was picked by the Los Angeles Lakers as the No. 55 overall pick in the second round of the Draft. He had played just one year of college basketball for the USC Trojans.The development sparked an ongoing nepotism debate, as NBA fans compared his rookie beginnings to his father’s towering list of achievements.Bronny played 27 games in his debut season with the Los Angeles Lakers. He has an average of 2.3 points, 0.8 assists, and 0.7 rebounds per game in the NBA regular season.Last month, Bronny expressed his desire to watch LeBron continue to play basketball. On being asked if his father should play more matches, Bronny told Fox Sports, “Yeah for sure. However long he can come back for, it’s always a pleasure being around him. He’s locked in. The stuff he does for his body and the preparation and stuff like that, I want to take full advantage of it.”Also Read: LeBron James once made Jayson Tatum cry, and it was not on court LeBron James is yet to decide his future, but it remains to be seen if the father-son duo will unite once again on the court.","Bronny james, 20, played 27 games in his debut season with the los angeles lakers.

49ers legend Brent Jones compares Pearsall to breakout star Puka Nacua



Ricky Pearsall is entering his second NFL season with high expectations. After being shot before his rookie year, the San Francisco 49ers wide receiver returned to finish strong with 210 yards and 2 touchdowns in his final two games. With Deebo Samuel traded and Brandon Aiyuk injured, Pearsall is set for a breakout in the 2025 NFL season.Ricky Pearsall’s road to the NFL was anything but ordinary. Shot before his rookie year, the first-round pick didn’t just recover, he made a strong late-season impact. In the final two games of 2024, Pearsall totaled 14 receptions for 210 yards and two touchdowns, showcasing his route-running, athleticism, and chemistry with quarterback Brock Purdy.That late surge caught the attention of former 49ers tight end Brent Jones. Jones missed his own rookie season in 1986 after a head-on collision with a drunk driver. Later released by the Steelers, he rebuilt his career in San Francisco and became a three-time Super Bowl champion. Jones knows what it takes to overcome trauma and succeed at the highest level. He sees the same resilience in Pearsall.In a recent interview with Guy Haberman, Jones said, “To actually see it click for him really kind of made it special at the end of the year.I look for him to be a big contributor this year. What a special young man to fight back from all of that.”What makes Pearsall's situation even more interesting is the roster turnover in San Francisco. Deebo Samuel is now in Washington, and Brandon Aiyuk is expected to miss the start of the 2025 season. That leaves Pearsall with a clear path to a starting role and plenty of targets.Brent Jones went a step further in his praise, saying, “Do not sleep on this guy. Maybe not the amount of catches, but I think he’s gonna be Puka Nacua-like at some point.”Nacua was the breakout wide receiver of 2023, posting a rookie-record 105 receptions for 1,486 yards and six touchdowns with the Rams. While Pearsall may not hit those exact numbers, the opportunity is real and the trust from the coaching staff is growing.Also Read: Tyreek Hill wants another raise despite $90M deal—Dolphins, McDaniel reportedly considering trade The 49ers will be relying on their young receiver to make plays early in the season.
