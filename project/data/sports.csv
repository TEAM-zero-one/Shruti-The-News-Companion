Poll Is it time for CSK to rebuild their squad for the next season? Yes, a complete overhaul is needed. No, just a few changes are sufficient.

Greenstone Lobo predicts Virat Kohli & Rohit Sharma's ODI future

NEW DELHI: Chennai Super Kings’ nightmare run in IPL 2025 has left fans frustrated, and at the centre of the storm is their iconic captain, MS Dhoni The 43-year-old legend, who returned to lead the side mid-season after Ruturaj Gaikwad's injury, has found himself under intense scrutiny as CSK now stare at a possible last-place finish, a first in their IPL history.With just one game left, CSK have lost all five matches where they batted first this season.Their latest defeat came against Rajasthan Royals on Tuesday, where the Chennai bowlers failed to defend 188.Teen prodigy Vaibhav Suryavanshi starred again, smashing a composed 57, while Akash Madhwal and Yudhvir Singh Charak took three wickets each to help Rajasthan chase the target with ease.The result has sparked a wave of reactions on social media, with many fans even calling for the veteran's retirement from the IPL.Once known for his calm leadership and match-winning instincts, Dhoni now finds himself at the receiving end of criticism for not being able to inspire a struggling CSK unit this season.Batting down the order, Dhoni has scored 196 runs in 13 matches, with a strike rate of 135.17 and an average of 24.5, decent but far from the impact performances he once delivered consistently.CSK’s problems, however, go beyond Dhoni.The overseas players have failed to fire, and several veterans have looked out of form.If Chennai doesn’t beat table-toppers Gujarat Titans by a big margin in their final league game, they will likely finish last, an unthinkable position for the five-time champions.Whether this season marks the end of an era for MS Dhoni remains to be seen, but fans online are making their voices heard louder than ever.","Csk have lost all five matches where they batted first this season.

'Heart Lamp' shines at Int'l Booker: First Kannada title and 1st short story collection to win prize,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/heart-lamp-shines-at-intl-booker-first-kannada-title-and-1st-short-story-collection-to-win-prize/articleshow/121324532.cms,"Navy stitches past with present to sail into future

Kannada writer, lawyer, and activist Banu Mushtaq and translator Deepa Bhasthi on Wednesday scripted history by winning the International Booker Prize for 'Heart Lamp', the first Kannada title and the first-ever collection of short stories to be awarded the 50,000 pounds (about Rs 58 lakh) prize.""This moment feels like a thousand fireflies lighting up a single sky - brief, brilliant, and utterly collective,"" said Mushtaq after receiving the award.The award was announced by bestselling Booker Prize-longlisted author Max Porter in his role as chair of the five-member voting panel, at a ceremony at London's Tate Modern. Hailing 'Heart Lamp' as ""something genuinely new for English readers"", Porter termed it a ""radical translation which ruffles language, to create new textures in a plurality of Englishes. It challenges and expands our understanding of translation"".Bhasthi is the first Indian translator - and ninth female translator - to win the prize since it took on its current form in 2016. Mushtaq is the sixth female author to be awarded the prize since then. It is the second time an Indian language book has won the International Booker Prize after Geetanjali Shree's 'Tomb of Sand', translated from Hindi by Daisy Rockwell, won the award in 2022.Mushtaq's collection of 12 short stories, translated from Kannada into English by Bhasthi, chronicles the everyday lives of women in patriarchal communities in southern India. In her acceptance speech, Mushtaq said it was an affirmation that ""we as individuals and as a global community can thrive when we embrace diversity, celebrate our differences and uplift one another.""The tales in 'Heart Lamp' were written over 30 years, from 1990 to 2023. agenciesThe Navy commissioned INSV Kaundinya , a 20m-long sailing yacht based on a 5th-century fresco at the Ajanta caves , at the Karwar naval base on Wednesday.The wooden ship , stitched together entirely by hand in Goa, will embark on a transoceanic voyage along the ancient trade route from Gujarat to Oman, scheduled for later this year. Naval officials said if the first voyage is successful, the yacht will then sail from Odisha to Indonesia later.The induction of this wooden vessel comes 40 years after the Navy decommissioned INS Bhatkal, its last wooden-hulled minesweeper.""We knew that these stitched ships were used to cross the ocean from very ancient times. We know that Indians were sailing the oceans from the bronze age, from the Harappan period. There's enough evidence of Indians crossing from the ports of Gujarat to Oman and Bahrain and going all the way to Mesopotamia,"" said Sanjeev Sanyal, PM's economic advisory council member, who initiated the whole project.""The problem is that there are no records of exactly what sea-going ships during the Harappan period looked like. There are some texts, like the 'Yukti Kalpa Taru', which we used. We used some testimonies of ancient travellers from other countries who came to Indian Ocean,"" said Sanyal.With no detailed blueprints available, multiple stakeholders put their heads together to get INSV Kaundinya to sail. ""From Sanyal's vision to Malayali shipwright Babu Sankaran's skill, and from the Navy's oversight to the Goan shipyard Hodi Innovations' determination, the stitched ship replica is a model for successful collaborations,"" said Commodore Srikant Kesnur (retd).INSV Kaundinya is named after India's first known mariner who, according to legend, established the Fuhan dynasty after marrying a Naga princess.""Kaundinya is not mentioned in Indian records, but we know of him from records of Cambodia and Vietnam. We can only guess where he came from, but just as a hint, there is still a gotra called Kaundinya that lives along the Odisha-Andhra coast, and it is possible that Kaundinya is actually not his first name but his gotra name,"" said Sanyal.","Banu mushtaq and deepa bhasthi win international booker prize for 'heart lamp' it is the first-ever collection of short stories to be awarded the 50,000 pounds (about rs 58 lakh) prize.

Wayne Gretzky’s son Ty Gretzky followed a different path while honoring his father’s legendary hockey legacy

While Wayne Gretzky is known around the world as the “Great One” of hockey, his eldest son Ty Gretzky has built a name for himself outside the NHL spotlight — all while preserving the legacy of his father through coaching, entrepreneurship, and family pride.Born on July 9, 1990, Ty Gretzky is the second child of Wayne and Janet Gretzky and the first of their sons. Although Ty didn’t pursue a professional hockey career like his iconic father, the sport still plays a significant role in his life. In fact, Ty co-founded The Gretzky Hockey School in 2014 with Wayne, a venture that gives young athletes across North America a chance to learn hockey fundamentals from the family that helped shape the sport.“He was my hockey guy. He loves hockey,” Wayne said about Ty during a 2021 episode of The Steam Room podcast. “We do hockey camps all over North America. He is one of my best friends and I love it.”Interestingly, Ty wasn’t named after a hockey legend — but rather a baseball icon. “I named Ty after Ty Cobb because I love baseball,” Wayne shared. It’s a nod to the family's appreciation for multiple sports, even as hockey remains central to their identity.Outside of hockey, Ty is a devoted husband and father. He married Sara Marie Cusick on February 29, 2020, in a glamorous Gatsby-style wedding in Brooklyn, New York. Together, they’ve welcomed two daughters, Sicily in 2021 and Vienna in 2023, adding another generation to the Gretzky legacy.Ty has also paid homage to his father through creative ventures like Gretzky’s Basement, a Toronto pop-up replicating Wayne’s famous memorabilia room filled with artifacts from his historic career. It’s an immersive tribute to both Wayne’s impact on hockey and the family's role in keeping that legacy alive.Also Read: Wayne Gretzky's son Ty Gretzky shows favouritism, backs Rick Tocchet's return as Flyers head coach with enthusiastic message Although Ty Gretzky may not have skated on NHL ice, he has built a legacy rooted in family, tradition, and the values passed down by one of hockey’s greatest — a quiet leader off the rink who continues to inspire the next generation.","Ty gretzky was born on july 9, 1990, in toronto, canada.

Panthers surge early, but Brad Marchand steals spotlight with fiery outburst

Paul Maurice’s cryptic reaction and Bobrovsky’s uncalled hit controversy

Game 1 of the Eastern Conference Final between the Florida Panthers and Carolina Hurricanes wasn’t short on fireworks—and we’re not just talking goals. While Florida dominated the scoreboard with a convincing 5-2 win, the real headline-stealer was Brad Marchand ’s mid-game ejection following a heated confrontation with Shayne Gostisbehere.Sergei Bobrovsky stood tall in goal, stopping 31 shots, while Carter Verhaeghe led the charge with a goal and an assist. The Panthers’ offensive depth was on full display as Rodrigues, Nosek, Bennett, and Luostarinen all contributed. However, despite the commanding performance, it was Marchand’s boiling point that became the talk of the night.Midway through the third period, with the Panthers cruising 4-1, tensions escalated fast. It started when Shayne Gostisbehere fired a puck directly at Marchand after dodging a heavy hit attempt earlier in the play. Marchand responded with fury—dropping his gloves and engaging in a full-blown scrap.According to Sportsnet, “Marchand was IRATE after he was given four minutes for roughing and a game misconduct for his tussle with Gostisbehere.” Gostisbehere, meanwhile, received only a minor, giving the Hurricanes a two-minute power play advantage.When asked about the confrontation post-game, head coach Paul Maurice was blunt yet evasive: “Yeah, I’ve got one. I’ll be keeping that to myself.” That response only added fuel to the debate, especially since another incident involving Andrei Svechnikov went uncalled. Svechnikov appeared to make contact with Bobrovsky’s head near the crease earlier in the game, but referees let it slide—prompting outrage online.One fan noted, “This looks like an intentional knee to Bobrovsky’s head by Svechnikov... should definitely be looked at.”Also Read: “Don’t think it’s justified”: Brad Marchand slams Leafs fans, says Toronto backlash is ‘crucifixion’ not criticism Despite the chaos, the Panthers now lead the series and have momentum on their side.

Why the Los Angeles Lakers Would Do It

Why the Warriors Would Consider It

Theandare under pressure to make big moves this offseason. After disappointing playoff exits, both teams face tough decisions—and a surprising trade involvingcould be on the table.According to Colin Keane of Sporting News , the Warriors, led by Stephen Curry , Draymond Green, and Jimmy Butler, fell short in the Conference Semifinals against the Minnesota Timberwolves. Their lack of depth and youth was exposed, signaling a need for fresh talent.The Lakers, built around LeBron James and Luka Doncic, also struggled defensively and were eliminated in the first round by the same Timberwolves squad. Their roster imbalance has forced front-office discussions about aggressive retooling.Here’s the potential deal that could shake up both franchises: Draymond Green (4-time All-Star, defensive anchor)- Dalton Knecht (young sharpshooting wing)- Rui Hachimura (expiring contract)- 2031 first-round draft pick LeBron James , now 40, is still elite, but the Los Angeles Lakers must maximize their championship window.Draymond Green’s defensive versatility and playmaking would immediately elevate their roster.- Defensive Upgrade: Green’s ability to guard multiple positions fixes a major Lakers weakness.- Leadership: His vocal presence and playoff experience would bolster the locker room.- Win-Now Move: Knecht’s potential doesn’t align with the Lakers’ urgency to contend.As writer Colin Keane noted: ""Green would be heartbroken to trade in his Warriors uniform and go somewhere else, but his positive relationship with LeBron has been well-documented.""According to Colin, trading Draymond Green would be emotional, but the Golden State Warriors must plan for life after Curry.- Future Assets: Knecht and the 2031 pick offer long-term upside.- Financial Flexibility: Hachimura’s expiring deal clears future cap space.- Youth Movement: Green’s departure accelerates a rebuild around younger talent.While this specific trade might not be enough, the Warriors should keep an open mind if better offers emerge.Both teams are at a crossroads. The Los Angeles Lakers get a proven winner in Draymond Green, while the Golden State Warriors secure assets for the future. Whether this deal happens or not, one thing is clear: major changes are coming for these franchises.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Golden State Warriors could eye $70 million Boston Celtics point guard to boster squad after unfortunate playoff exit This trade scenario remains speculative, but it highlights the tough choices ahead for both teams.

Eyes on history as Cristiano Ronaldo nears 1,000-goal mark

On 21 May 2025, Cristiano Ronaldo scored his 935th career goal in Al-Nassr 's 2–0 win over Al-Khaleej in the Saudi Pro League to further extend his legendary status, a stoppage-time penalty from the icon helped Al-Nassr to the three points, bringing the Portuguese star even closer to his career milestone of 1,000 career strikes while simultaneously reinforcing his status as the greatest goalscorer in football history.For all their attacking threat, Al-Nassr were pushed hard by a stubborn Al-Khaleej outfit but were in control for much of the match. The first half ended without any goals, but it was Colombian forward Jhon Durán who broke the deadlock in the 75th minute, calmly finishing inside the area to give the home side a well-deserved lead.The visitors did everything they could to earn an equalizer, which allowed for space on the counter for Al-Nassr. Then, in the dying seconds of the game, Cristiano Ronaldo was badly tackled inside the box, winning a penalty. Stepping up, the 40-year-old slotted home obliquely in the 97th minute, securing his 935th career goal and sealing the outcome.Ronaldo's 98th goal in 110 appearances in the Saudi Pro League keeps him among the top scorers in the league. His role remains crucial for Al-Nassr as they push for a strong end to their domestic season.Cristiano Ronaldo's goal record rises to 935, and he is now just 65 goals from the elusive 1,000-goal club — a milestone no player in the modern era has ever achieved. With the sun setting on his career, Ronaldo nevertheless continues to be pivotal to the Al-Nassr frontline.The Saudi club's contract reportedly runs to the end of June 2025, with the possibility of a one-year extension or a final transfer — but nothing has yet been made official.

Two-time All-Star Jean Segura retires



After over a decade of consistency in MLB Jean Segura has officially announced his retirement, drawing the curtain on a memorable 12-year career that took him across six franchises and left a lasting impression on fans and teammates alike.The announcement was made through CAA Sports, Segura’s agency, via Instagram on Wednesday. The post honored the 35-year-old infielder’s accomplishments, stating, “Congratulations to Jean Segura on an incredible MLB career.” With that, the baseball world took a moment to reflect on one of the game’s most quietly impactful players.Segura’s journey began with the Los Angeles Angels, but he soon found his rhythm during stints with the Milwaukee Brewers and Arizona Diamondbacks. It was in 2016, while donning a Diamondbacks uniform, that Segura reached peak form—leading the National League with 203 hits and notching a career-best 6.6 WAR. His consistency at the plate and relentless energy on the field made him a fan favorite and a nightmare for opposing pitchers.One of his most memorable chapters came during his two-season run with the Seattle Mariners from 2017 to 2018. Acquired in a blockbuster trade that also brought Mitch Haniger to Seattle, Segura quickly lived up to his nickname in the Pacific Northwest—“Jean, Jean, the hitting machine.”He posted a .302 batting average, with 7.1 bWAR, and made the 2018 American League All-Star team. His three-run homer off Josh Hader in the All-Star Game that year remains one of the highlights of his Mariners tenure.Despite his individual brilliance, team success often eluded Segura. He reached the postseason only once, during the Philadelphia Phillies ’ 2022 World Series run. Though the Phillies ultimately fell short against the Houston Astros, that playoff appearance was a long-overdue reward for a player who had consistently delivered throughout his career.His final stint in the majors came in 2023 with the Miami Marlins, closing out a career stat line that includes a .281 batting average, 1,545 hits, 110 home runs, 513 RBIs, 211 stolen bases, and an OPS of .729.For fans who followed him from Milwaukee to Miami, Jean Segura’s career was never about flash. It was about reliability, heart, and a tireless work ethic. As he steps away from the game, the legacy he leaves behind is one of grit, grace, and a bat that never stopped swinging.Also Read: Why Juan Soto’s effort against the Red Sox is raising eyebrows among fans, teammates and pundits alike","Two-time all-star jean segura retires after 12-year mlb career.

The news was confirmed by the Colts, marking the end of a remarkable chapter in both the team’s history and the broader football world.“We are devastated to announce our beloved Owner & CEO, Jim Irsay, passed away peacefully in his sleep,” said Colts COO Pete Ward. “Jim’s dedication and passion for the Indianapolis Colts, in addition to his generosity, commitment to the community, and most importantly, his love for his family were unsurpassed.”Irsay’s impact on the Colts cannot be overstated. Taking full control of the franchise in 1997 after the passing of his father, Robert Irsay, he led the team into its most successful era. Under his leadership, the Colts drafted quarterback Peyton Manning in 1998, a decision that transformed the franchise into a perennial contender. Over the next decade, the Colts captured eight division titles and culminated their dominance with a Super Bowl XLI victory in 2006 against the Chicago Bears.But Irsay’s journey with the Colts began long before he assumed ownership. Raised in a football household, he joined the organization as a teenager, taking on roles that spanned from equipment manager to front-office executive.In 1984, at just 24 years old, he became the youngest general manager in NFL history—the same year the Colts relocated from Baltimore to Indianapolis. When his father suffered a stroke in 1995, Jim stepped up to oversee day-to-day operations, cementing his leadership role.Away from the field, Irsay was as distinctive as they come. He embraced life with a deep passion for music, curating an impressive collection of music memorabilia that he often showcased during public exhibitions and jam sessions with his band. His philanthropy was equally powerful, with generous contributions aimed at mental health, addiction recovery, and support for marginalized communities across Indiana and beyond.“Simply put, he wanted to make the world a better place and that philosophy never wavered,” Ward said. “Jim will be deeply missed by his family, the Colts organization, and fans everywhere.”Irsay leaves behind a legacy carried by his daughters—Carlie Irsay-Gordon, Casey Foyt, and Kalen Jackson—who are already actively involved in team operations. Though the franchise has yet to announce formal succession plans, the Irsay legacy appears set to continue through them.The official cause of Jim Irsay’s death was not revealed in the Indianapolis Colts’ statement, yet his declining health over the years paints a complex picture. In December 2023, police in Carmel, Indiana, found him unresponsive with agonal breathing and a weak pulse. Narcan was administered, and while he “responded slightly,” the event was labeled a suspected overdose. Still, Irsay later attributed the scare to a hematoma from a leg injury.Battling addiction for decades, Irsay once admitted to 15 rehab stints and surviving a previous overdose where he “went code blue.” His 2014 DUI arrest added to a troubled past. Yet, through it all, his love for the Colts and football remained, with the organization noting, “some of Jim’s fondest memories came from his youth working training camps in Baltimore.”Survived by his ex-wife, Meg Coyle, and ten grandchildren, Jim Irsay’s influence extended well beyond football. He shaped a generation of Colts fans and brought a spirit to the league that was uniquely his.Also Read: Taylor Swift cuts off Blake Lively over explosive legal scandal: Travis Kelce caught in the crossfire as explosive private texts and betrayal surface","Jim irsay, the longtime owner and ceo of the indianapolis colts, has died.

Travis Kelce spotted shirtless after workout in Miami, triggering strong reactions online

Fans defend Kelce and call out double standards in online body shaming

Travis Kelce, the Kansas City Chiefs ' superstar tight end, found himself at the center of a heated social media debate this week—not over football, but over body hair.Photos of Kelce surfaced on Instagram via celebrity gossip account Deux Moi, capturing the three-time Super Bowl champion shirtless near his car in Miami after what appeared to be a workout. While such candid snaps of athletes are nothing new, it wasn’t his physique or fame drawing attention this time—it was the unusual pattern on his back hair.As fans zoomed in, they noticed patches of hair missing on his upper back. One Instagram user boldly speculated that it looked like “his girlfriend had tried to wax his back and failed halfway.” Another quipped, “A trigger warning would’ve been nice.”While some poked fun at the seemingly uneven patches, others were quick to slam the comments as body shaming. One user fired back, “These comments aren’t passing the vibe check,” while another added, “Some of you haven’t been with an adult man and it shows.”The backlash against the jokes was swift and passionate. Many fans noted the double standards in how male and female celebrities are treated in similar situations. “Ouch the body shaming,” one commenter lamented, while another urged, “Imagine if the photo was a woman, and the men were making comments about her body hair.”A particularly strong response came from a fan who celebrated Kelce’s natural look, writing, “I genuinely LOVE a man with body hair. It's HOT AF. And the fact he doesn't feel the need to overly groom something natural coz of society's expectations makes him even hotter.”Some users also pointed out a likely cause for the bald patches: years of wearing football pads causing friction and hair loss. “Travis is getting in shape for football season,” one fan reminded. “He’s not worried about his back hair.” Another chimed in, “Same thing happens to hockey players too!”Even Deux Moi stepped in to cool down the discourse, commenting, “I feel like you guys are being slightly dramatic.”Also Read: Did Travis Kelce just confirm he’s living with Taylor Swift?

Giancarlo Stanton has been a name in the homes of baseball fans for years. But now, while recovering from injuries in 2025, rumors are spreading that the New York Yankees will trade him. A possible new destination? The Seattle Mariners. With prospects rising in New York, Stanton may no longer be required. But for a team like the Mariners, who are looking for a strong playoff push, Stanton's power at the plate would be the game-changer.Giancarlo Stanton has not appeared in a game thus far in 2025 due to both elbows being hurt. Meanwhile, Ben Rice has stepped in and played wonderful baseball. Along with other stars like Aaron Judge and Jason Dominguez, Rice has kept the Yankees on top. With so much youth talent, the Yankees might decide to say goodbye to Stanton.Giancarlo Stanton was the Yankees' top slugger at one time. He joined the Yankees in 2018 and immediately established an MLB record for the most difficult home run ever hit at 121.7 mph. That record still stands today. Being healthy, however, has not been a cakewalk.As Zachary Howell of Clutch Points informs us, it's unlikely Stanton can ever play for a complete season again. But even so, according to Howell, Stanton has some value, especially for a team that wants power in the playoffs.The Seattle Mariners are one of the few MLB teams never to have appeared in the World Series. Adding a large bat-like Stanton's would give their offense the boost that it needs so desperately. Even though Stanton was injured, he's a power hitter when he's not injured. Last year when the Yankees made their playoff run, he was among their best players.Giancarlo Stanton had played for the Miami Marlins. He also won the MVP award. If they trade for him, the Mariners will be acquiring a player with this much experience and playoff strength, something that they greatly lack.If Giancarlo Stanton joins the Mariners, he brings more than just home runs—he brings veteran leadership. His postseason experience could be vital in mentoring younger players and energizing Seattle’s clubhouse for a serious playoff run.If Giancarlo Stanton joins Seattle, he could be the missing piece.

Roger Goodell , NFL Commissioner, said at the NFL’s spring meeting, “It’s an incredible honor for any athlete to represent their country in the Olympics, which is the pinnacle of global sport.I know first-hand that the inclusion of flag football in the Olympics had sparked a tremendous amount of excitement among NFL players interested in the chance to compete for their country on the world stage.We are thrilled that they will now have that chance.” Talking about this very chance, Minnesota Vikings star wide receiver Justin Jefferson went heart-to-heart in the same spring meeting, standing alongside Commissioner Roger Goodell.25-year-old Justin Jefferson shared at the NFL’s spring meeting, “I’m just at a loss for words.

WWE Superstar Zoey Stark made her comeback to the limelight in a tragic manner on the recent episode of Monday Night RAW. What was supposed to be a critical milestone in her career, Stark got severely injured in her knee in a triple-threat qualifying match for the 2025 Women's Money in the Bank (MITB) ladder match. The incident has not only sidelined her from one of WWE’s most prestigious events but may also signal a prolonged absence from in-ring competition.The accident occurred at the Bon Secours Wellness Arena in Greenville, South Carolina, during a MITB qualifier bout between Zoey Stark, Kairi Sane, and Rhea Ripley. At its climax, Stark tried her characteristic springboard dropkick—a sportslike move that requires agility and accuracy. In targeting Kairi Sane, Stark slipped in executing the springboard, resulting in her awkwardly landing on her right leg.The blow caused her knee to bend in a distinctly unnatural manner, quite visibly startling both supporters and commentators. The match instantly became secondary as paramedics rushed onto the field to treat the hurt athlete. After the botched maneuver, Stark fell to the floor, cradling her right knee and exhibiting obvious signs of pain and distress. The referee stopped the match for a moment and motioned for medical attention. WWE ringside physicians made their way into the ring and evaluated her condition.Despite the extent of the injury, Stark first tried to leave the ring independently. She tried to stand, only to fall again, as she could no longer bear the weight of herself. Eventually, she was assisted backstage by medical personnel, affirming the severity of the ordeal.Veteran WWE play-by-play commentator Michael Cole guessed on-air that Stark may have re-aggravated an old injury. Stark had extensive knee surgery in 2021 to repair a torn ACL, MCL, and meniscus—injuries requiring months of rehabilitation.With the visual similarity and reaction of Stark, there is an increasing fear that her current injury is a recurrence or exacerbation of the same condition of the knee. But to date, WWE has not issued a formal medical diagnosis or recovery timeline. The wrestling fraternity came in support of Stark after the injury. AEW wrestler Thunder Rosa showed her concern with a heartfelt post on social media:""Wrestling is a lovely and risky sport. We leave everything on the table every time we go to the ring, and we also put a lot on the line when we do what we are passionate about. Zoey Stark, I love you, sister, and I hope that you heal soon."" — Thunder Rosa through X (previously Twitter)Zoey Stark's RAW match was her first on television since January. She had last remained an active member of the dissolved faction Pure Fusion Collective, after Sonya Deville and Shayna Baszler left. Stark was competing mainly in non-televised WWE house shows and sporadic Main Event tapings before this return.As a result of her earlier knee damage incurred during her stint in NXT, Stark was drafted to the main roster as part of the 2023 WWE Draft—a testament to how much the WWE believed in her promising future. The MITB qualifier was set to be a career-launching experience, which made her untimely injury so much more heartbreaking.With Stark out, the match went on between the remaining participants. Rhea Ripley took advantage of the situation, overpowering Kairi Sane and finishing the match with her characteristic Riptide finisher. The pinfall win earned Ripley a spot in the upcoming ladder match for Women's Money in the Bank, which is to be held on June 7. Ripley’s victory, however, was overshadowed by the concern surrounding Stark’s health, as WWE fans and analysts alike shifted focus to the severity of the injury.The extent of Stark’s injury remains unconfirmed by WWE, leaving her return date unknown. Given her history of severe knee damage, fans and medical experts fear that she could face another lengthy recovery process. This injury not only removes her from one of WWE’s most career-defining matches but also risks stalling the momentum she had just begun to regain. For now, Zoey Stark’s fans—and the WWE Universe as a whole—await official word from WWE’s medical team.",Wwe superstar zoey stark suffers a painful knee injury during mitb qualifier bout.

United, on the other hand, had to go through Real Sociedad, Olympique Lyonnais and Athletic Bilbao, scoring a whopping 19 goals in just the knockout phase.A win for Spurs would see them claim silverware for the first time since the 2008 League Cup. As for Europe, trophies haven't come around since the 1984 UEFA Cup.United have enjoyed more success in that regard, and are one of the most successful teams in world football. The FA Cup in 2024 remains their most recent trophy, but 20 league titles, three Champions Leagues and several other domestic crowns find place in United's trophy cabinet. The Red Devils have won the Europa League once - in the 2016/17 season.The Europa League final will be played between Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur.The Europa League final will be played at San Mames, home of Athletic Bilbao in Spain.The Europa League final will be broadcast live on the Sony Sports Network (Sony Ten 1, Ten 2, Ten 3 and Ten 5 & HD channels).
