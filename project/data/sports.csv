Gisele Bündchen gets emotional while describing her divorce as “the death of my dream”

Gisele Bündchen defends Tom Brady, dismisses media speculation over football’s role in the split

A quiet love story and learning to live without apology

In March 2024, Gisele Bündchen gave fans an emotionally raw glimpse into her post-divorce life during a heartfelt sitdown with Robin Roberts, reflecting on the end of her 13-year marriage to NFL icon Tom Brady. As part of the IMPACT x Nightline special Climbing the Mountain, the supermodel's tearful moment caught headlines—but beyond the emotion was a message of resilience, healing, and self-discovery.Gisele Bündchen, now 44, opened up about what she once described as “the death of my dream.” When Roberts gently revisited the quote, asking how she was coping more than a year after the split was finalized, Gisele struggled to answer before turning away and softly requesting, “Can I have a little moment?”That vulnerable pause wasn’t scripted—it was the real-time unfolding of a woman still navigating the aftershocks of letting go of a once-idealized life. And it struck a chord with fans who had watched her grace red carpets and Super Bowl stands by Brady’s side for over a decade.Following their October 2022 divorce, media speculation had pointed fingers at Tom Brady’s return to football as a key factor. But Gisele Bündchen strongly rejected that narrative in a Vanity Fair interview: “It’s the craziest thing I’ve ever heard.”Bündchen continued, “Listen, I have always cheered for him, and I would continue forever.”Despite the pain of separation, her sentiments toward Brady remained grounded in mutual respect. “If there’s one person I want to be the happiest in the world, it’s him, believe me,” she said. “I want him to achieve and to conquer. I want all his dreams to come true.”The interview at that time also hinted at Gisele Bündchen’s future—with herself and possibly with someone new. When asked if she was ready to love again, she replied with serene confidence: “Where my heart is now is where I am right now. I’m living my truth, and I’m not apologizing for it.”Behind the scenes, she had reportedly grown close to Joaquim Valente, her children’s jiu-jitsu instructor, though the relationship started as a friendship. “They’re taking it slow,” a source said at the time, noting how Valente had been a steady source of comfort during her transition.Also Read: “She is secure and happy”: Gisele Bündchen thrived after dumping Tom Brady—was the NFL legend the real problem?

Connor McDavid has reflected on his future in the NHL and in the Edmonton Oilers



Connor McDavid, one of the most talented and popular players in the NHL, has been recovering from a brutal heartbreak after his team, the Edmonton Oilers, ended up losing the 2025 Stanley Cup Finals to the Florida Panthers. With Connor McDavid’s contract with the Edmonton Oilers expiring in 2026, there are a lot of speculations about his future and it seems, the NHL star player has made his feelings pretty clear about it.A few days after the Edmonton Oilers lost to the Florida Panthers, Connor McDavid reflected on his future in the NHL. As per NHL.com, Connor McDavid spoke about his new contract and said, “It’s only been a couple of days since the season ended, I’m going to take some time to regroup.”The Edmonton Oilers’ captain added, “I’m going to talk to my agent a little bit and family and all that, and make some decisions whenever that time comes. But there’s no rush on anything like that.”The Edmonton Oilers’ fans have a special connection with Connor McDavid for the number of years he has spent with the team and the efforts he put in to try and bring the Stanley Cup home this year.However, it seems there are other teams who are waiting for Connor McDavid to not extend his contract with the Edmonton Oilers.For instance, recently Bleacher Report’s Adam Gretz recently wrote about the Toronto Maple Leafs being a potential team for Connor McDavid to join, in case the Oilers’ captain decides to leave his current team.Bleacher Report’s Adam Gretz wrote recently, “The Maple Leafs already have their own superstar and No. 1 center in Auston Matthews…But if McDavid ever does become available, Toronto would have to find a way to get involved in the bidding.”However, at this point, nothing is finalised and Connor McDavid is busy maintaining a pretty low profile in his life, as he spends his days with his close family and friends. With Connor McDavid’s wife, Lauren Kyle, also starting a new venture, the Oilers’ captain has supported her through all of her high and lows in her career.Also Read: NHL trade rumors: Connor McDavid might have the Toronto Maple Leafs waiting for him amid trade speculations","Connor mcdavid has reflected on his future in the nhl and in the edmonton oilers.

Swifties connect the dots between an Eras lyric and Travis Kelce’s first encounter

July 7 now holds a deeper meaning in the Swift-Kelce timeline

Fans about Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce's relationship (SS via Twitter)

Before Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce became pop culture’s favorite power couple, fans believe their love story quietly began during a pivotal moment on the Eras Tour. A single lyric, a packed stadium, and one NFL star in the crowd—Swifties are convinced destiny was already singing in Kansas City that night.On July 7, 2023, during her Kansas City stop, Taylor Swift paused between songs and asked the crowd, “Will you allow me the honor of starting over?” The lyric — from her emotional ballad Last Kiss — was poignant on its own, but now, fans are giving it a whole new meaning. As fate would have it, Kelce was in the crowd that very night. Though the two hadn't met yet, Swifties are convinced that destiny was already at work.To the fans, this wasn’t just a concert — it was a cosmic nudge. Kelce reportedly attended the show with no idea that his life was about to change. But as Swift performed to a stadium of screaming fans, confetti raining down and bridges being belted out like gospel, something clicked. As one fan noted on social media, “He walked in a tight end and walked out a hopeless romantic.”The lyric from Last Kiss became symbolic. What once sounded like heartbreak has now become a line reinterpreted through love — a subtle, almost spiritual call for a fresh start, made even more poetic by what followed.What’s remarkable is how fans are treating this date like a new national holiday. Edits are being made. Fonts are being chosen. Tears are being shed. Many even believe that “the Eras Tour was a matchmaking ritual in disguise.” Swifties have always been excellent storytellers, but this theory might be their most cinematic yet.One Swifties @reneeasance wrote, “Well now I’m crying.” @j_eckerle wrote, “It was rare. I was there. I remember it all too well.” Another fan @thirteen_87 wrote, “This is sweet. I hope they can read this.” Another user @cleantvloverr wrote, “i’m in a puddle of tears.”Now, over a year later, Kelce seems fully committed to playing the long game. Whether he’s dancing at Swift’s concerts or traveling across continents to support her, he’s fully embraced the role of romantic lead.Also Read: Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce refuse to satisfy public curiosity—no relationship update until they’re ready With their love continuing to unfold like a live tour setlist, fans are already imagining Swift’s next album including a subtle thank-you to Arrowhead Stadium.

Anthony Cirelli trade talks are not simple, but not off the table



Canadiens willing to make bold NHL moves this offseason



Lightning’s decision may come down to roster depth



The Montreal Canadiens are actively exploring trade options to upgrade their forward group this offseason, and Tampa Bay Lightning center Anthony Cirelli has surfaced as a top target. Team officials reportedly believe Cirelli’s skill set aligns perfectly with their roster needs, particularly as a reliable second-line pivot behind captain Nick Suzuki.Despite the Canadiens’ interest, pulling off a trade for Anthony Cirelli would be far from straightforward. The Lightning values his versatility and leadership, especially as they work to stay competitive in a tight Eastern Conference. Cirelli has long been viewed as a cornerstone in Tampa’s middle-six and a key penalty-kill contributor.Montreal has already demonstrated this offseason that it is willing to be aggressive. The team added top talent through the draft and is working to complement its young core with experienced, playoff-proven players. Anthony Cirelli checks many of those boxes.Though Montreal has reportedly considered other options to fill their second-line center void, including younger and older names across the league, Cirelli stands out due to his balanced game and long-term upside.He could also provide mentorship to developing forwards like Cole Caufield, Juraj Slafkovský, and Ivan Demidov.For Tampa Bay, the decision to entertain offers for Anthony Cirelli would likely hinge on their confidence in internal replacements. While the Lightning have a strong core intact, moving a forward of Cirelli’s caliber would leave a hole in their lineup, one that may not be easy to fill without adding from the outside.Anthony Cirelli has become a focal point in NHL trade rumors for good reason. He’s the kind of smart, dependable center that playoff teams are built around. If the Montreal Canadiens can navigate the trade hurdles and convince Tampa Bay to deal, they could make one of the biggest moves of the NHL offseason.Also Read: Former NHL enforcer Nick Tarnasky destroys drunk man in wild viral golf course brawl",Anthony cirelli has become a focal point in nhl trade rumors for good reason.

Astrologer Mark Du Boise sees red flags in Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce’s natal charts

Self-Proclaimed World's Top ASTROLOGER Speaks! | TGA 4

Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce may look like the ultimate power couple, but one astrologer believes their stars are far from aligned. While the world buzzes with speculation about a possible engagement, especially after the couple’s loved-up Fourth of July getaway, a bold new prediction suggests their story may end in heartbreak.Travis Kelce, the Kansas City Chiefs tight end, and Taylor Swift, the global pop icon, have been inseparable since going public with their romance in September 2023. From Swift cheering at NFL games to Kelce flying across continents to catch her Eras Tour, the pair have shown unwavering support for one another.Fans have even speculated that a secret proposal may have already happened. However, reports from outlets like People and Entertainment Tonight suggest they are waiting until Kelce finishes what could be his final NFL season.Amid all the romantic speculation, astrologer Mark Du Boise has thrown cold water on the fairytale. Calling himself the “world’s best” astrologer, Du Boise analyzed their birth charts and concluded that their cosmic chemistry is off.“Taylor’s troubled. She’s a sun-moon quincunx. It’s hard astrology. I don’t think anyone is going to last with her,” Du Boise claimed, suggesting that Swift’s Sagittarius sun and Cancer moon create inner tension between her adventurous nature and emotional needs.Meanwhile, Kelce’s Libra sun and Sagittarius moon make him charming and balanced, but potentially hesitant to commit deeply. According to Du Boise, the two signs together create a disconnect that could spell doom for long-term happiness.Despite the celestial warning, fans see no trouble in paradise. The couple continues to make public appearances, exchange heartfelt glances, and integrate into each other’s lives—including their families. Kelce even brought Swift into his brother Jason’s inner circle, showing signs of growing closeness and commitment.Also Read: Will Taylor Swift join Travis Kelce at the American Century Championship in Lake Tahoe this weekend?

Ace Bailey's Injury: What Happened?

Impact and Fan Reaction on Ace's Injury

fans hoping to catch a glimpse of rookiein action at the Las Vegas Summer League were hit with disappointing news: Bailey has been ruled out of the Jazz’s first game due to hip flexor soreness. The update, confirmed by beat reporters and team sources, means Bailey will be sidelined as the Jazz face the Charlotte Hornets, turning what was a highly anticipated debut into a waiting game for both the player and his supporters. Ace Bailey , the No. 5 pick in the 2025 NBA Draft, had already generated buzz with his performances in the Salt Lake City Summer League, which served as a warm-up to the main event in Las Vegas. In his debut against the Philadelphia 76ers, Bailey played over 25 minutes, putting up a solid stat line of eight points and seven rebounds despite some rookie nerves. He quickly found his footing, following up with an 18-point, seven-rebound, three-assist performance against the Memphis Grizzlies, showcasing his athleticism with highlight-reel dunks and confident shot-making.“Just confidence. Stop thinking so hard... Just be Ace Bailey, who I am,” Bailey said after his breakout game, reflecting a growing comfort with the NBA pace and spotlight.Bailey sat out the Jazz’s final Salt Lake City Summer League game with what was initially described as a right groin strain.Hopes were high that he would return for the Las Vegas opener, but the team ultimately ruled him out due to hip flexor soreness—a common but frustrating injury for athletes that can linger if not properly managed. While the Jazz have not indicated that the injury is serious or long-term, they are taking a cautious approach, prioritizing Bailey’s health and long-term development over a single summer showcase.The timing is undeniably a letdown for Jazz fans who traveled to Vegas or tuned in specifically to see Bailey’s electrifying talent. The Summer League is a prime stage for rookies to make their mark, and Bailey’s absence is felt both on the court and in the stands. However, most analysts agree that missing a Summer League game is unlikely to have any lasting impact on Bailey’s NBA trajectory. The Jazz coaching staff has emphasized that their focus for Bailey is on developing his all-around game, especially his defense, decision-making, and off-ball movement, rather than immediate scoring output.While the setback is disappointing, Bailey’s early showings have already offered a glimpse of why he was such a coveted prospect. His blend of size, athleticism, and scoring instincts has drawn attention, and his attitude suggests he’s ready to put in the work required to succeed at the next level. The Utah Jazz and their fans will be hoping for a quick recovery, with the expectation that Bailey will return to action before the Summer League concludes—if not, his full debut will have to wait until preseason or the regular season.Also read: Larsa Pippen Spills on Her “Immature” NBA Coach Ex Before Finding Love With 31-Year-Old Jeff Coby For now, the message is clear: Ace Bailey’s story with the Utah Jazz is just beginning, and a minor injury won’t dim the excitement for what’s to come.",Utah jazz rookie ace bailey has been ruled out of the jazz’s first game due to hip flexor soreness.

Jerome Bettis questions Steelers' identity shift away from run-first football

Jerome Bettis on the Dan Patrick Show Full Interview | 07/10/25

Clash of philosophies between Aaron Rodgers and Arthur Smith looms large



The Pittsburgh Steelers may have made headlines this offseason by landing Aaron Rodgers and DK Metcalf, but not everyone’s convinced the glitzy moves align with the team’s traditional DNA. In fact, Hall of Famer Jerome Bettis is ringing the alarm bells—and Rodgers might be silently agreeing.Aaron Rodgers signed with Pittsburgh for what could be his final NFL season, bringing a Hall of Fame résumé and a clear philosophy: he thrives in a controlled, efficient, pass-first offense. But that clashes with what offensive coordinator Arthur Smith has planned—a ground-heavy, tight end–centric scheme that echoes old-school football more than Rodgers’ up-tempo style.Bettis, appearing on The Dan Patrick Show, didn’t hold back. When Patrick asked about the departure of running back Najee Harris and whether Rodgers changes the team’s approach, Bettis was clear: “They’re going to run the football. They drafted [a] young kid from Iowa who’s really, really good running back.”He emphasized that even with Aaron Rodgers and Metcalf on board, abandoning the run game would be a fundamental mistake. “If you ask Aaron Rodgers to throw the ball 40 times, that’s a mistake,” Bettis warned.His logic? At 41, Rodgers shouldn’t be scrambling or absorbing unnecessary hits. The offense should play through the run to maximize play-action and control tempo.The tension deepens when you examine Arthur Smith’s history. Known for heavy run schemes, multiple tight end sets, and complex pre-snap motion, Smith’s system is almost the antithesis of what Rodgers prefers. The quarterback’s track record thrives in motion-light, single-tight-end, pass-heavy playbooks—a setup far from what Pittsburgh appears to be building.Even Bettis acknowledged this delicate balance: “He’s moving. He’s getting the ball out. He’s, you know, quick in the huddle, out of the huddle, running.” That doesn’t mesh easily with Smith’s grind-it-out game plans.Beyond the philosophical divide, practical concerns remain. Pittsburgh’s backfield, featuring rookie Kaleb Johnson and Jaylen Warren, is unproven. Meanwhile, the offensive line—an Achilles’ heel for Rodgers in New York—must protect its aging quarterback or risk an early collapse.Also Read: What we learned about Joe Burrow’s mindset, swagger and quirky side from Netflix’s 'Quarterback’ The Steelers’ attempt to fuse new-school talent with old-school identity could either produce fireworks—or a full-blown identity crisis.

Connor McDavid left searching for answers

After leading the Florida Panthers to back-to-back Stanley Cup championships, Matthew Tkachuk is in no mood to show mercy. When asked if he felt bad for Connor McDavid and the Edmonton Oilers, Tkachuk dismissed the suggestion outright.He pointed out that no one offered the Panthers sympathy when they lost in 2023 despite their injuries. Now, with two Cups in hand, Tkachuk isn’t about to soften his edge, especially not for a rival team.The Panthers and Oilers have built a fierce rivalry over the past two seasons, and Tkachuk’s latest remarks have only intensified it. Despite the Panthers having the upper hand with two straight Finals wins, the tension shows no signs of cooling.Tkachuk, a former Calgary Flames forward, has a long history with the Oilers, and his latest comments reflect a personal edge that keeps this rivalry burning.According to Tkachuk, fans from Western Canada have been hoping for a break for the Edmonton Oilers. But his message was clear: the Stanley Cup isn’t something to be handed out for pity. His competitive mindset has no room for emotional appeals.His time in Calgary made him all too familiar with Edmonton’s hunger for a Cup and even more determined to deny it.While the Panthers celebrate, Connor McDavid and the Oilers are left facing another tough offseason. Despite elite talent and deep playoff runs, they’ve fallen short once again.Tkachuk’s cold reaction is likely to sting, but it may also fire up McDavid and his teammates heading into next year. The Oilers are still chasing their first championship in the McDavid era, and the Panthers are standing firmly in the way.Tkachuk has drawn a clear line in the sand: there are no handouts at the top. And with the Panthers now firmly established as the team to beat, don’t expect this rivalry, or Tkachuk’s sharp edge, to disappear anytime soon.Also Read: Former NHL enforcer Nick Tarnasky destroys drunk man in wild viral golf course brawl","Matthew tkachuk has led the florida panthers to back-to-back stanley cup championships.

Nick Wright: Knicks should TRADE KAT to Lakers for LeBron James | What's Wright NBA

Sportscaster Nick Wright recently took part in an in-depth discussion surrounding LeBron James’ next stop and shared his viewpoint. On his podcast, ‘What’s Wright? With Nick Wright’, he elaborated on all the factors that work in the New York Knicks’ favor if they choose to trade Karl-Anthony Towns for LeBron James. From cost factor to strengthening the team’s defense, he shed light on all the positive things that can happen with the trade for the Knicks.Rumors about LeBron James leaving the Los Angeles Lakers are overflowing in NBA circles. Amidst these rumors, Wright’s dissection of the LeBron-Towns trade can provide the Knicks the perspective they need to make a blockbuster trade decision.Retirement, player option, or new team? The buzz around LeBron James' next move refuses to slow down. Amidst all the murmur around the Los Angeles Lakers’ superstar’s future, Nick Wright has come up with his perspective. He elaborated on how the New York Knicks’ decision to trade Karl-Anthony Towns for LeBron James can rejuvenate the organization. Talking about the pros, he said:“The pros, in my opinion, are oddly by adding a guy in year 23, a 40 guy who's going to be 41, you actually get better defensively for two reasons. One is it's more Mitchell Robinson minutes instead of Town. So that's definitive, you know, that helps you a lot defensively. But also, as LeBron showed last year, once they got Luca, if he's not the primary offensive creator, he still has the ability to be a good, not great defender like he once was, but a good defender if that's where he can put his energy. ”He further said: “The other sneaky pro for the Knicks is, do they actually want to move towns before he's he wants this next mega extension when they traded all those picks for Bridges and you're going to have to extend him and you've already extended OG and you're obviously in the Jaylen Brunson business.”He further continued, “Like does the fact that LeBron would be short term act is that actually a positive because you don't want to you know have the big money associated with Carl Anthony Towns when there are, I think, legitimate real concerns of if our two best players are Brunson and Towns are we good enough defensively ever to win four rounds. I think those are all real, legitimate discussions.”Wright’s thoughts largely revolved around the role LeBron can play in the New York Knicks, without the team needing to make a long-term commitment. Also, moving Karl-Anthony Towns can help the Knicks manage costs, as they have already signed hefty deals with Jalen Brunson, OG Anunoby, and Mikal Bridges, per Basketball Network. He further moved to how it is the right time to make the deal, as the trade leading to LeBron moving to an Eastern Conference team can improve the Knicks’ chances to win the title after 52 years.Wright pinpointed, “The Celtics are off the chessboard. The Pacers are off the chessboard, and the Bucks don't know where they are on the chessboard. We're already the favorites in the conference. We haven't won a championship in 52 years.What if we go for it (LeBron-Karl-Anthony trade)? It certainly is a worthy legitimate conversation, just like it.”Here is Wright’s complete discussion:In the discussion, Wright also pulled out LeBron James’ longtime agent Rich Paul’s statement to ESPN, where he explained LeBron’s mindset for the coming season. Rich Paul had told ESPN, as per Shams Charania’s report dated June 29, 2025:“LeBron wants to compete for a championship. He knows the Lakers are building for the future. He understands that, but he values a realistic chance of winning it all. We are very appreciative of the partnership that we've had for eight years with [governor] Jeanie [Buss] and [general manager] Rob [Pelinka] and consider the Lakers as a critical part of his career.We understand the difficulty in winning now while preparing for the future. We do want to evaluate what's best for LeBron at this stage in his life and career. He wants to make every season he has left count, and the Lakers understand that, are supportive, and want what's best for him.""So, the trick right now lies in finding the correct team for LeBron James, which can help him have a ring before he hangs up his sneakers. And currently, the best win-win situation is possible to achieve with the LeBron James-Karl-Anthony Towns trade. According to Wright, the only con of the trade will be LeBron’s age, who will be playing his season 23, and is about ten years older than Karl-Anthony Towns.Also Read: “He wants to win”: Insider updates on LeBron James amid Los Angeles Lakers’ drama If all factors as indicated by Wright are taken into consideration, James may consider exercising his player option and ask for a move to the Eastern Conference, with the New York Knicks as his next stop.

Historic Arrest in Australia After Racial Abuse of NBL Star Montrezl Harrell Marks Major Step Toward Combating Online Hate in Sports,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/historic-arrest-in-australia-after-racial-abuse-of-nbl-star-montrezl-harrell-marks-major-step-toward-combating-online-hate-in-sports/articleshow/122393866.cms,"Montrezl Harrell (Image via Getty)

Montrezl Harrell

The Incident: Social Media Turns Sour

The Investigation and Arrest

Reactions: Zero Tolerance and Cultural Change

The Broader Issue: Social Media Abuse in Sports

Why This Matters: Setting a Precedent

Entertaining Take: The Courtroom, Not the Court

In a landmark moment for Australian sport and social accountability, a Victorian man has been arrested and charged following a racially abusive social media attack directed at, a prominent player for the Adelaide 36ers in the National Basketball League (NBL). The incident has sparked widespread discussion about online abuse, athlete safety, and the power of law enforcement to hold digital offenders accountable.The controversy began in November 2024, shortly after a heated on-court incident involving Harrell at John Cain Arena. Following the game, Montrezl Harrell received a barrage of racist abuse from a burner Instagram account. The messages included the use of the 'N' word and the phrase ""get out of my country,"" among other offensive remarks. The abuse was promptly reported to Basketball Australia’s Integrity Unit, setting the wheels of justice in motion.After a thorough investigation, Victoria Police, in collaboration with Basketball Australia’s Integrity Unit, identified and arrested a 37-year-old man from Huntingdale, Victoria. The man was charged with ""using a carriage service to menace, harass and/or offend,"" a serious offense under Australian law that can carry a maximum penalty of five years in prison.The accused has been bailed and is scheduled to appear at Moorabbin Magistrates' Court on August 15, 2025. This arrest marks the first successful prosecution in Australian basketball for racially abusing an athlete via social media—a significant milestone in the fight against online hate.The NBL and Basketball Australia have both strongly condemned the abuse and praised the swift action taken by authorities. Lauren Blecher, NBL's chief corporate and governance officer, stated: ""The NBL stands united with Basketball Australia in taking a firm stance against any form of online abuse or vilification. The action by Victoria Police sends a clear message that such behaviour will not be tolerated. We are incredibly proud of the collaborative efforts that led to this outcome. ""A spokesperson for Basketball Australia’s Integrity Unit emphasized the importance of athlete safety and the need for cultural change: ""Every athlete deserves to compete in a safe environment, free from abuse. There are laws in place to govern appropriate behaviour towards athletes, and it’s important the public understands that. Taking a stand sends a clear message of zero tolerance and helps drive the cultural change needed to create a safe sport and respectful environment for everyone. ""This case is not an isolated incident. Social media abuse targeting athletes—especially those from minority backgrounds—has been a recurring issue in Australia and worldwide. Just last year, Tasmania JackJumpers coach Scott Roth revealed that his team's players and their families had been ""attacked brutally through social media to the point where it's ugly,"" highlighting the urgent need for better protections and accountability.This arrest sends a powerful message: anonymity online does not equate to immunity from the law. For too long, trolls and abusers have hidden behind fake accounts, believing themselves untouchable. This case demonstrates that with the right collaboration between sports organizations and law enforcement, perpetrators can and will be brought to justice.While Montrezl Harrell is known for his fierce presence on the basketball court, it’s the courtroom where the real drama will unfold next. The accused, who once thought he could hide behind a burner account, now faces the full weight of the law—a reminder that the digital world is very much part of the real one.Also read: LeBron James’ Final Act? Los Angeles Lakers Set the Stage for a Legendary Hollywood Farewell in 2026 The arrest of the Australian man for racially abusing Montrezl Harrell is a watershed moment for Australian sport and digital accountability. It is a testament to the courage of athletes who speak out, the diligence of integrity units, and the evolving power of law enforcement in the digital age. As the case heads to court, it stands as a warning to would-be trolls: the game has changed, and the referees are watching—on and off the court.","A victorian man has been arrested and charged following a racially abusive social media attack directed at montrezl harrell, a prominent player for the adelaide 36ers in the national basketball league.

San Jose Sharks bet on Jeff Skinner’s scoring touch and playoff experience to boost NHL rebuild

What Jeff Skinner’s signing means for the San Jose Sharks’ NHL future

On Friday, the San Jose Sharks signed veteran winger Jeff Skinner to a one-year, $3 million deal, hoping to tap into the scoring instincts and leadership he’s built over 15 NHL seasons. For Skinner, now 33, this move marks another dramatic turn in a career that began with Calder Trophy glory and stretched all the way to his long-awaited first Stanley Cup Playoff goal last year. He arrives in San Jose with 699 career points and the chance to be both a mentor and an impact scorer on a team hungry for improvement. It’s a fresh start that might just suit him perfectly.When the Carolina Hurricanes drafted Skinner seventh overall in 2010, their scouts saw “nobody in the draft that scores goals like Jeff Skinner.” He delivered instantly, winning the Calder Memorial Trophy as the league’s top rookie and earning a spot in the All-Star Game at 18—the youngest to play in it, a record he still holds. But along with that early promise came adversity: concussions interrupted strong seasons, yet Skinner kept finding ways to produce and lead. He eventually wore the alternate captain’s ‘A’ in Carolina and recorded multiple hat tricks, proving his resilience and goal-scoring pedigree. Jeff Skinner’s career took its next major turn in 2018 with a trade to the Buffalo Sabres. He quickly lit it up, becoming only the second player in franchise history to notch 20 goals before December and finishing with 40 on the season. That earned him an eight-year, $72 million extension. But over time—and after a coaching change—his role diminished, leading to a buyout announced by Buffalo on June 29, 2024.Just two days later, Skinner landed with the Edmonton Oilers, signing on July 1. He scored 16 goals during the 2024–25 regular season and, in a moment that showcased his patience paying off, finally broke through in the postseason. On May 29 in Dallas, he scored his first playoff goal during the Western Conference Final. “It’s special to finally get here, and to contribute means a lot,” he said that night.Now in San Jose, Skinner will try to recapture the form that made him one of the league’s top pure scorers. The Sharks are betting on his veteran savvy and willingness to embrace new roles, something he made clear last season when he said, “There’s always more you can do, more to give.”For a San Jose team searching for leadership and proven NHL scoring, Jeff Skinner’s signing offers both experience and the possibility of one last great chapter. Fans will be watching to see if this veteran sniper can deliver the goals—and guidance—that help the Sharks take meaningful steps forward. What do you think of this signing? Let us know your thoughts.Also Read: Minnesota Wild re-sign Michael Milne to one-year deal, betting on NHL breakthrough","The san jose sharks signed veteran winger jeff skinner to a one-year, $3 million deal.
