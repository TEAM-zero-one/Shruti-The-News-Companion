Osamu Nishimura loses his year-long battle against esophageal cancer





Osamu Nishimura , one of the most prolific wrestlers from the Japanese wrestling community has passed away at the age of 53. Nishimura had been suffering from esophageal cancer since last year and lost his battle to the vicious disease this year. He leaves behind his wife and 6-year-old son. Nishimura was best known for his time in New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) and MUGA World Pro Wrestling (MUGA).Osamu Nishimura's cancer diagnosis came late, and in March 2024, when he was diagnosed, he already had stage four esophageal cancer. He had already had a cancer scare back in 1998 when Nishimura was diagnosed with a cancerous tumor in his retroperitoneal space. He used natural remedies and alternative treatments to fight the cancer and was declared cancer-free two years later, in 2000.Unfortunately for him, this time the battle was already half-lost by the time he came to know about it. The cancer had already spread to his lymph nodes by the time of diagnosis. The entire upper left side of his body, except his head, had been affected. He even underwent a craniotomy to help with his battle, but nothing seemed to be of any help by the end.But cancer did not mean he left his wrestling days behind. His last match was in December 2024, after his diagnosis, where he teamed up with Katsushi Takemura and Shinya Aoki against Atsushi Onita, Mammoth Sasaki, and Raijin Yaguchi. Now less than a year after the diagnosis, Nishimura passed away after losing his battle against cancer.It was announced earlier today, on Feb 28, that Osamu Nishimura had passed away. He was 53 at the time of his death. WWE star Shinsuke Nakamura also posted a condolence message after the passing of Nishimura. Other than wrestling, he was also a representative of the Tokyo Bunkyo Ward Assembly and served as a food education instructor. He was re-elected to a fourth term in 2023 and served as a councilor until he died in 2025.Also Read: Expected Timeline for WWE Veteran Randy Orton’s Return From Hiatus Revealed",Osamu nishimura had been suffering from esophageal cancer since last year.

Golden State Warriors' Stephen Curry’s New 3-Point Record Leaves Damian Lillard and Klay Thompson in the Dust,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/golden-state-warriors-stephen-currys-new-3-point-record-leaves-damian-lillard-and-klay-thompson-in-the-dust/articleshow/118615384.cms,"Credits: NBA

Is Golden State Warriors Stephen Curry’s 3-Point Record the Most Unbreakable Stat in NBA History?

In the realm of NBA three-point shooting, there's Stephen Curry , and then there's everyone else. It's like comparing a supernova to a sparkler. While Damian Lillard and Klay Thompson are certified sharpshooters, Curry's recent exploits are less a demonstration of skill and more a display of basketball sorcery. Take the Golden State Warriors ' recent East Coast swing opener against the Orlando Magic. Even when the Dubs faced a daunting early deficit, Curry, simply rewrote the script.He started slow, almost toying with the Magic, before unleashing a second-quarter inferno. It was almost four minutes into the first quarter before the two-time MVP made his first shot. He scored the opening points of the game for the Warriors after draining a 28-footer. Orlando surged to a 34-23 lead as Curry closed the quarter with five points and two assists. Steph Curry scored 16 points in the second quarter, including the final three-pointer, a 49-footer, which reduced the Magic's lead to 66-52.When you see ""Most games with 9+ 3-pointers made in NBA history,"" it reads:45 — Steph Curry14 — Damian Lillard12 — Klay ThompsonYou don't just see a number, you witness a chasm. A canyon. A continental divide.Lillard and Thompson, two titans of the long ball, are relegated to the 'also-rans' section of the Curry story. It's not a slight on their abilities, but a testament to Curry's otherworldly consistency. They're like elite chefs forced to watch a culinary demigod effortlessly whip up a five-star meal while blindfolded. Imagine trying to explain to a casual fan that someone has more than three times the number of elite shooting performances than their closest competitors. It's like explaining quantum physics with interpretive dance.ALSO READ: Why Kevin Durant Said NO: The Real Reason He Killed Potential Golden State Warriors Trade Curry's dominance isn't just about making shots; it's about altering the very fabric of the game. He's redefined what's possible, forcing defenses to stretch to absurd lengths, and inspiring a generation of kids to launch shots from the logo. So, while Lillard and Thompson continue to light up scoreboards, Curry's legacy is etched in a different stratosphere, a place where gravity bends and three-pointers fall like rain.","Stephen curry has more games with 9+ 3-pointers made in nba history than damian lillard and klay thompson.

Mel Kiper Jr. Wants the New York Giants to select Travis Hunter

The NFL Combine is now underway, with teams assessing potential prospects to shape their franchises. Heisman Trophy winner Travis Hunter is a top prospect in the draft, likely to be a top-three selection. Hunter's impressive career at Jackson State and Colorado has led the Big 12 in receptions, touchdowns, interceptions, tackles, and passes broken up.Travis Hunter, a Colorado cornerback and wide receiver, is gaining attention for his versatility in the NFL. ESPN's Mel Kiper Jr. projects him as the third overall pick, potentially joining the New York Giants, sparked by his exceptional skills.""Hunter is my top-ranked prospect in the class, and though I currently see him as a receiver in the pros, he could also play cornerback for New York,"" Kiper wrote. ""He can make a massive impact on either side of the ball, and he'll likely see at least some time on both sides.”""Perhaps the Giants take his ball skills and quickness and drop him at receiver opposite Malik Nabers to form a solid supporting cast around whomever is under center. Perhaps they look at his elite instincts and finally land a true CB1. Either way, this pick would be clutch for a struggling Giants team.”Travis Hunter's dual capabilities could be beneficial for the Giants, as NFL analyst Sam Monson suggests he could serve as the team's top cornerback and wide receiver, complementing current standout Malik Nabers.The concept of an NFL two-way player is rare, but Hunter's talents have generated discussion among league executives and coaches. Tennessee Titans coach Brian Callahan views it as ""very realistic,"" with the possibility of Hunter starting as a cornerback before gradually assuming offensive responsibilities.Nevertheless, there are questions regarding the physical cost and the challenge of learning both positions. In spite of these issues, Hunter's unusual combination of ability and adaptability makes him a commodity, with the potential to redefine conventional positional roles in the league.With the draft approaching, the Giants' strategy is again the subject of debate. Instability at quarterback and potential desire for veterans Matthew Stafford or Sam Darnold create space for a utility-type addition like Hunter, who could serve in various capacities.Also Read: “An exceptional talent”: Travis Hunter already winning over NFL coaches and executives as a viable two-way player In short, Travis Hunter’s rare two-way skill set makes him one of the most intriguing prospects in the upcoming NFL Draft . His ability to contribute on both defense and offense presents a unique chance for teams like the Giants to strengthen their roster and overall effectiveness.","Travis hunter, a colorado cornerback and wide receiver, is gaining attention for his versatility.

While Crosby has been a lifelong Penguin, speculation grows about whether he might one day reunite with MacKinnon in the NHL.""I'm, I'm not sure it happens before the trade deadline,"" Hayes said on TSN's OverDrive. ""It feels like an off season move, or sit right like now, if he's gonna eventually conclude.""Sidney Crosby and Nathan MacKinnon, both from Nova Scotia, have a well-known friendship, and their on-ice chemistry has often led to speculation about a potential team-up in the NHL.MacKinnon recently secured his long-term future with the Avalanche by signing an eight-year, $100.8 million contract, making him one of the highest-paid players in the league. With a strong core that includes defenseman Cale Makar, the Avalanche are considered top Stanley Cup contenders, and adding Crosby would only increase their chances of success.Talking about winning with Nathan MacKinnon in the 4 Nations Face-Off, Hayes mentioned that if Crosby contemplates a trade, he would prefer it to be handled discreetly and swiftly.""That's the thing. And... if you're gonna get to that conclusion, do it as quickly as you can,"" Hayes said. ""Yes, like, if it's in the back of your mind that you kind of realize, all right, I don't think I can finish this dance. It's gonna get worse before it gets better. And that's likely what's gonna happen in Pittsburgh.""Also Read: NHL Score: Nathan MacKinnon led the Avalanche past Devils in a 5-1 win with two goals While the thought of Sidney Crosby teaming up with MacKinnon in Colorado is exciting, his deep commitment to the Penguins makes a trade seem unlikely.

Travis Kelce has three hard-and-fast rules in his relationship with Taylor Swift

Travis Kelce, the 35-year-old Kansas City Chiefs player, allegedly has three hard-and-fast rules in his relationship with Taylor Swift, also 35. The two, who started dating over the summer of 2023, are frequently spotted together and have both attained tremendous success in their careers—Swift as one of the world's largest music icons and Kelce as a vital member of the Chiefs. Even with their great push, the Chiefs failed to reach the Super Bowl following a 40-22 defeat to the Philadelphia Eagles on February 9.Kansas City Chiefs superstar Travis Kelce has three hard and fast rules when it comes to his relationship with singer Taylor Swift. Dating since summer 2023, the two are regularly spotted together and are a hot topic for fans and the media. Swift is among the world's leading musicians, and Kelce is an integral part of the Chiefs, who came up short of the Super Bowl after a 40-22 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles on February 9.According to the Life and Style Magazine, through MSN, Swift apparently has some 'rules' about how Kelce can stay in contact with her and whom the football player can socialize with during his free time.“They’ll be doing lots of texting and calling, too, but Taylor likes to see Travis in real time,” a source said. “She likes to know where he is and who he’s with. It’s not that she doesn’t trust him; she just wants to feel connected. Taylor loves Travis’ energy and spontaneity, but she doesn’t want him wasted at the bar with pals. He can celebrate his wins in style with her and their friends.”Being a high-level athlete, Travis Kelce probably does not have much of his free time spent in bars, considering the strenuous nature of his profession. Otherwise, when he is not training or on the field, he co-hosts the extremely popular New Heights podcast with his brother Jason Kelce, a retired NFL great. The podcast has attracted an enormous following and gives fans an inside look at football and the brothers' personal lives.The third rule in the relationship of Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift is one that is most argued about. The couple has reportedly agreed to not be seen with others of the opposite gender to avoid gossip and speculation. This ruling, though questionable, is probably a move to preserve their privacy and keep away from extra reinforcement from their respective professions.“Taylor’s been in this biz long enough to know what comes with being in the spotlight,” they added.The Chiefs star recently disclosed his relationship during an appearance on the Stephen A. Smith Show. “I’m enjoying all aspects of life,"" said Kelce. ""Me and Taylor are happy and I couldn’t be happier to enjoy that confidence off the field and all the support I could ever ask for at the stadium.""He added, “I think personally, the beauty of being in a very strong relationship is that you get that support to be able to come in and focus on your craft, focus on being the best version of you. I think I’m as focused as I’ve ever been on my job and being the best player that I could possibly be week in, week out for this team.""Also Read: “Enjoyed a quiet night”: Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift return to the spotlight following international getaway after Chiefs' Super Bowl loss","Travis kelce, 35, and taylor swift, also 35, started dating over the summer of 2023.

Lucia: The Groundbreaking Protagonist Redefining GTA



Grand Theft Auto VI Trailer 1

The Significance of Lucia’s Inclusion in GTA 6



The Bonnie-and-Clyde Effect in GTA 6



How Lucia's Inclusion Affects Gameplay



A Defining Moment for Rockstar



The revelation that Lucia will become the first-ever female protagonist within the Grand Theft Auto series marks a turning point for Rockstar Games and gaming as a whole. GTA 6 will mark a long-anticipated shift, shattering well-established traditions to include a lead female character for the first time, offering unique insights into narratives, gameplay styles, and diversification. With this bold act, much anticipatory hype has been generated between fans and pundits.For more than two decades, the GTA series has focused on male protagonists, from Claude in GTA 3 to Franklin, Michael, and Trevor in GTA 5. Introducing Lucia makes it clear that Rockstar is serious about changing with the times and appealing to a wider, more varied audience. Not only does she subvert gaming's traditional gender roles, but she also provides new narrative directions unexplored within the series before.Including Lucia in GTA 6 injects a totally new direction to the game's storyline. The first female protagonist, her backstory will most certainly explore new dynamics between characters and inter-personal tensions that define her as distinct from other past protagonists. Rockstar's move to include a female character as the title face for the game follows the increasing trend towards gender representation in high-level gaming franchises, recognizing the need for greater inclusivity in storytelling. In addition to representation, the presence of Lucia in GTA 6 holds potential for new gameplay mechanics, including divergent heist tactics, mission structures centered around relationships, and special character powers that will revolutionize the way players interact with the game's world.The trailer for GTA 6 suggests a Bonnie-and-Clyde-themed story, where Lucia is paired with a male companion involved in a criminal enterprise. The implication of this is that Rockstar is tightening its approach to storytelling through an emphasis on character relationships. The dual-protagonist model, which was successful in GTA 5, may return as a way for players to enjoy the game's events from multiple viewpoints. Also, Lucia's background could bring in new factions and conflicts within the Vice City-based environment, deepening the story further. Her character also could defy crime saga conventions, providing a morally nuanced and complex protagonist who adds mystery to the story.Aside from altering the story, Lucia's addition could retool GTA 6's gameplay. Rockstar has a history of breaking the mold of open-world gaming, and Lucia's character could bring mechanics specific to her personality. Players could experience new relationship-based interactions that affect mission success, more role-playing depth that enables Lucia's story to be influenced by moral decisions, and gameplay additions that make the world feel more real than ever. These developments would be a game-changer for the series, making GTA 6 one of the most engaging installments in the franchise so far.Lucia's status as GTA 6's female protagonist is not just a milestone; it's a statement about the direction of the series. By embracing both diverse storytelling and gameplay options, Rockstar is raising the bar for open-world games. As the hype for GTA 6 remains strong, Lucia has become a defining characteristic that may redefine the series for years to come.Also Read: GTA 6 Second Trailer: Expected Release Date, Plot Details, Protagonists, and More","Lucia will become the first-ever female protagonist within the grand theft auto series.

What Happened Between Anthony Edwards and Jarred Vanderbilt?

What Sparked Anthony Edwards' Heated Shoving Match with Lakers' Jarred Vanderbilt?

now

The sweet symphony of squeaking sneakers and simmering rivalries. In the Lakers-Timberwolves clash at Crypto.com Arena delivered a spicy side dish alongside the hardwood action. Forget popcorn, we were served a full-blown shoving match between Minnesota’s golden boy, Anthony Edwards , and his former teammate, the Lakers ’ defensive dynamo, Jarred Vanderbilt . Think less ""friendly reunion"" and more ""awkward family dinner where someone spills the gravy.""The post-first-quarter buzzer brawl, resulting in technical fouls for both, wasn't just a fleeting moment of heat. It was a potential harbinger of doom for the Timberwolves . While things cooled down quickly, the damage was done. Edwards , already flirting with suspension, now sits precariously at 15 technical fouls – one measly whistle away from a mandatory sit-out.Let's break it down: a team already battling injuries, facing a Lakers squad hungry for playoff positioning (evidenced by their dominant 58-47 halftime lead), now risks losing its offensive linchpin. Edwards, averaging a blistering 27.5 points per game, is the engine that makes the Timberwolves roar. Without him, the offense could sputter like a vintage car running on fumes.Why is this so critical? With 22 regular-season games remaining, and a playoff berth on the horizon, the odds of Edwards picking up another technical are higher than a LeBron James dunk. Every contested call, every perceived slight, every passionate outburst becomes a potential landmine. The Lakers, smelling blood in the water, capitalized on the Timberwolves' internal turmoil, dominating the first half.The psychological impact cannot be understated. Knowing their star is walking a tightrope, the Timberwolves' focus might waver. Every possession becomes a pressure cooker. Can they afford Edwards' fiery spirit, or will it ultimately burn them? The Lakers, meanwhile, are likely relishing the potential advantage. They know a weakened Timberwolves team is easier prey.ALSO READ: LeBron James Celebrates After Beating Dallas Mavericks: What’s the Justin Timberlake Connection? This isn't just about fouls and suspensions. It's a narrative. It's drama. It's the kind of storyline that makes fans hold their breath, wondering if Edwards can keep his cool, or if the Timberwolves will pay the price for a moment of on-court chaos.","Anthony edwards and jarred vanderbilt were involved in a post-first-quarter shoving match.

The Memphis Grizzlies are gearing up for a high-stakes showdown against the New York Knicks on Friday, February 28, at FedExForum, but all eyes are on the injury report, particularly the status of star guard Ja Morant. Ja Morant , who has been a key contributor for the Grizzlies this season, is currently listed as fit to play in tonight’s game. His availability for the game remains uncertain, leaving fans and analysts speculating about his potential impact on the court.

When and where to watch the Cleveland Cavaliers play tonight against the Boston Celtics (February 28, 2025)?

The Cleveland Cavaliers have received a significant boost ahead of their highly anticipated matchup against the Boston Celtics on Friday, February 28, with star guard Darius Garland declared fit to play. Garland, who was previously listed on the injury report with a hip issue, has been cleared and is expected to take the court at TD Garden for the 7:30 p.m. ET tip-off. Darius Garland ’s return comes at a crucial time for the Cleveland Cavaliers, who are enjoying a stellar season with a 48-10 record. The 24-year-old point guard has been a key contributor, averaging 18.9 points and 5.6 assists over the last 20 games. His ability to orchestrate the offense and knock down perimeter shots—averaging 2.5 three-pointers per game during that stretch—will be vital against a Celtics team known for its defensive prowess.The Celtics, sitting at 42-17, have their own injury concerns heading into the game. Jrue Holiday (finger), Jaylen Brown (thigh), and Luke Kornet (personal) are all listed as questionable, potentially leaving Boston shorthanded. Despite these uncertainties, the Celtics remain a formidable opponent, led by Jayson Tatum, who ranks seventh in the league with 26.6 points per game.Cleveland’s offense, which ranks second in the NBA with 122.9 points per game, will look to exploit any gaps in Boston’s defense. Donovan Mitchell , the Cavaliers’ leading scorer, has been in exceptional form, averaging 24.9 points over the last 20 games. With Darius Garland back in the lineup, the backcourt duo of Mitchell and Garland could prove to be a nightmare for the Celtics.Defensively, the Cavaliers have been solid, allowing just 111.2 points per game, good for 10th in the league.
