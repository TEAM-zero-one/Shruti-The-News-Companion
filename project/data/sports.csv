Panthers Win Game 5 to Take 3-2 Lead in Stanley Cup Final | NHL on TNT

Wayne Gretzky is a name synonymous with greatness in the NHL , but the origin of his famous nickname, ""The Great One,"" has a surprising twist. During a recent segment on NHL on TNT’s Face Off, Wayne Gretzky shared that his father, Walter Gretzky, was not a fan of the moniker when it first appeared during his youth hockey days.Long before Wayne Gretzky shattered NHL records, he was just a ten-year-old prodigy from Brantford, Ontario, netting an unbelievable 400 goals in a single season. A reporter from the London Free Press came to profile the young phenom. At the conclusion of the article, the journalist proposed a fitting nickname: “The Great One,” drawing inspiration from legends like “Mr. Hockey” and “The Golden Jet.”“They said, ‘We should just call him The Great One,’” Gretzky recalled. “Well, my dad tried to kill that right away — it just kept coming back.”Gretzky believed such a title placed unnecessary pressure on his young son. He didn’t want Wayne to bear the weight of premature hype. But despite his father's objections, the nickname gained traction and became permanently linked to the budding superstar.Over time, the family had no choice but to embrace the label. “Finally, I just was like, ‘Well, we’re going to have to live with it,’” Gretzky admitted.And live with it he did. By the time he retired in 1999, Wayne Gretzky had not only fulfilled but exceeded the expectations that came with such a grand title. With 894 goals, 2,857 career points, and 61 NHL records, “The Great One” wasn’t just a nickname—it became his rightful legacy.Switching gears to current NHL action, Wayne Gretzky also shared his thoughts on the Edmonton Oilers' Game 5 loss to the Florida Panthers. “Right from the get-go, Florida played a really smart, intelligent road game,” he said, noting that Edmonton looked “cautious” and “on their heels” early on.Also Read: No longer Canadian: Wayne Gretzky’s Canadian identity questioned after Donald Trump friendship sparks controversy Wayne Gretzky’s nickname, “The Great One,” once resisted by his father, ultimately came to represent not just early talent, but a lifetime of excellence, From a childhood nickname to a storied NHL career, Gretzky’s story remains one of humility, brilliance, and enduring greatness.","Wayne gretzky's iconic nickname, ""the great one,"" originated from a profile of his youth hockey dominance.

Miami Heat Lead Kevin Durant Trade Talks—Rising Rookie Could Make or Break Blockbuster Deal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/miami-heat-emerge-as-frontrunner-in-blockbuster-kevin-durant-trade-but-one-rising-rookie-could-make-or-break-the-deal/articleshow/121981237.cms,"Image via Barry Gossage/ Getty Images

Kel’el Ware could be the X-factor in Miami Heat’s bid to land Kevin Durant in blockbuster trade

The Kevin Durant sweepstakes are heating up—and the Miami Heat may finally be in the driver’s seat. As multiple teams circle the two-time Finals MVP, one name is suddenly dominating the trade conversation: Kel’el Ware. According to NBA insider, Miami could leap ahead of the pack if they include the 7-foot-4 rookie standout in their offer to the Phoenix Suns. But as of now, Ware hasn’t officially been put on the table. That hesitation could be the difference between a blockbuster and a bust.Trade conversations between the Phoenix Suns and Miami Heat are reportedly gaining traction, but one key piece is still missing. According to ClutchPoints insider Brett Siegel, things are progressing—but not quite finalized. “Although the two sides are not right at the finish line yet in trade talks,” Siegel wrote, “one player can get them there.”That player is Kel’el Ware, a rising rookie talent who has caught the attention of Suns executives. “That would be Kel'el Ware, a rookie standout in Miami's frontcourt who is a giant with his 7-foot-4 wingspan and two-way potential,” Siegel explained.Phoenix is reportedly fixated on Ware’s upside and believes his inclusion could unlock the next stage of negotiations.“If the Heat include Ware in a revamped package to what they have already offered, talks with the Suns will reach a whole new level,” Siegel continued, “as he is the player Phoenix wants in discussions with Miami.”So far, the Heat have not fully committed to sending Ware in any official proposal. But according to Siegel, there’s a sense around the league that the Heat are closest to closing the deal—if they’re willing to make that leap. “This is why many around the league who spoke with ClutchPoints view the Heat as the team that can get over the finish line the easiest,” Siegel wrote.In the proposed framework, Miami’s outgoing assets would include Ware and Andrew Wiggins, while additional teams could be brought in to help Phoenix clear salary and get under the luxury tax.Also Read: “Wish you were here”- Amidst trade rumors Kevin Durant pays emotional tribute to NBA legend Kobe Bryant Kevin Durant remains one of the league’s most dangerous scorers, and he’s made it clear he’d welcome a move to Miami. Still, the final call may rest with Heat president Pat Riley and whether he’s ready to part with Kel’el Ware. With the Suns aiming to cut costs and a half-dozen teams still in the mix, the window to land Durant won’t stay open for long. If Miami wants to win the sweepstakes, it’s time to push their final chip in.","Kel’el ware could be the x-factor in miami heat’s bid to land kevin durant in blockbuster trade.

Myles Garrett is one of the highest-paid defensive ends in NFL history. Mike Moraitis of The Sporting News said on June 20, “T.J. Watt is looking for Myles Garrett money in contract extension. ” Now, if T.J. Watt’s contract extension talks at the Pittsburgh Steelers are revolving around Myles Garrett’s kind of money, there’s bound to be some comparison between the two players. And it’s bound to reach the Pittsburgh Morning Radio Show on 93.7 The Fan! And it did!The host of the Fan Morning Show, Adam Crowley, chimed in by saying Myles Garrett may be a first-ballot Hall of Fame guy, but he’s not better than T.J. Watt statistically. A former Pittsburgh Panthers quarterback who joins them (93.7 Radio Talk Show hosts Dorin Dickerson and Adam Crowley) every Thursday, Pat Bostick, too shared his views. Bostick said the two(T.J. Watt and Myles Garrett) can’t be compared because they play different games. Let’s hear their plights, shall we?Host of the Fan Morning Show at 93.7 The Fan in Pittsburgh, Adam Crowley said,“Edge rushers, this floored me on this ESPN quarter-century team.DeMarcus Ware - good player, great player. Jared Allen - great player. Julius Peppers - great player. Myles Garrett’s on the list. I mean, seriously. I’m not saying Myles Garrett isn’t a great player. He is. He’s a first-ballot Hall of Fame guy. Every single statistic, he trails T. J. Watt.Why does it seem like the National Consensus likes Garrett more than Watt? Because I do think that is the consensus. I think most average NFL fans, by the way the National Media talks about Garrett, they think he’s a better player than T.J. Watt. Statistically, he’s not. He’s a better athlete. He got drafted No. 1 overall because of it. He was a phenom in college. Like, is that what it is?”Pat Bostick, former Pittsburgh Panthers quarterback, joined the hosts of 93.7 The Fan on June 19. Bostick shared,“I think edges come in different packages. He’s a nine technique in a 4-3 defense. T.J. Watt, for the majority of his career, is a standup outside linebacker. They’re both edges now. Everyone wants to call them edges now. His opportunities are quite frankly different than Myles Garrett’s.I think he’s got more designed one-on-ones because of how they play schematically. I think Garrett and Watt play different positions, and they’re being compared in an edge category that’s melding them two together. I don’t think that’s necessarily fair to either one of them.”The crew of the 93.7 The Fan Radio Talk Show was later joined by Aditi Kinkhabwala of CBS Sports and they asked her about the Myles Garrett and T.J. Watt issue. She sided with T.J. Watt. What did she say?Aditi Kinkhabwala said, “I got asked that, too. Oh, is T.J. Watt’s whole contract situation being held up by Myles Garrett? And my response to that is T.J. Watt is not that petty. This is not about - oh, I need one more penny than Myles Garrett.”Ian Rapoport, NFL Insider, also said, “You know if they possibly can, they’re going to try and not make him(T.J. Watt) the highest-paid edge-rusher in the NFL.”But how much does T.J. Watt want? As much as Myles Garrett? Then, how much does Myles Garrett make? Myles Garrett earns $40 million a year -his contract is for four years and $160 million. But who started all this Myles Garrett and T.J. Watt comparison to even begin with?It was Adam Schefter, NFL Insider, who shared on ESPN's Unsportsmanlike on Tuesday that Trey Hendrickson and T.J.

Fans of the NFL are familiar with Joe Burrow, the Cincinnati Bengals quarterback, for his big throws, cool demeanor, and game-changing plays. But there is one other topic worth discussing—his hair. Yes, since entering the NFL in 2020, Joe Burrow has certainly changed the game as well as his hairstyle a number of times. And some of them? Totally unexpected. From classic cuts to bleached looks, Joe Burrow has given fans something new almost every year. But what were the wildest ones? Let’s go back and look at every hairstyle Joe Burrow has rocked with the Cincinnati Bengals—some may surprise you.Joe Burrow was drafted by the Cincinnati Bengals as the No. 1 overall pick in April 2020 and had a fresh classic haircut. This is the same haircut he sported while winning a national title at LSU in January 2020. After this clean look, fans were able to see Joe Burrow until the end of the 2021 season, including Joe Burrow opting for this classic look in Super Bowl LVI (February 2022) in Los Angeles.Then came a small change—Joe Burrow kept the same cut but grew it out a bit. By the 2023 offseason, fans noticed longer, shaggier hair.That summer, Burrow posted an Instagram Story wearing a headband and called himself “The Dark Knight”, comparing himself to Batman.But the wildest change came in July 2024, just before training camp. Joe Burrow showed up with a fully bleached buzz cut. He looked like rapper Eminem, and people couldn’t stop talking about it. Joe Burrow said, “Me and B.J. [Hill] decided to do it together, so here we are.”By September 2024, when the regular season began, Joe Burrow had moved on from the Eminem look.He showed up with frosted tips, giving major 90s boy band vibes. But after the Cincinnati Bengals lost their first three games, fans blamed the hair. On X (Twitter), one user joked, “Joe needs to cut those tips—bad luck.”Soon after, he went back to his normal look. So now fans are left wondering—what will Joe Burrow try next?","Joe burrow was drafted by the cincinnati bengals as the no. 1 overall pick in april 2020.

Magic Johnson praises Jeanie Buss and Mark Walter in heartfelt reaction to record-setting Lakers sale



The Los Angeles Lakers legend Magic Johnson could not hide his feelings after a bombshell report that the franchise was being sold. In a stunning move that has redefined sports business history, the Los Angeles Lakers— one of the NBA's most valuable franchises— has been sold for a record-breaking $10 billion. Jeanie Buss and her family agreed to sell their 66% majority stake to billionaire Mark Walter, CEO of TWG Global and Guggenheim Partners. The transaction, first reported by ESPN’s Shams Charania, makes it the largest sale of a professional sports franchise ever, surpassing the Boston Celtics' $6.1 billion mark earlier this year.Magic Johnson, the face of the Los Angeles Lakers' greatness and a longtime close friend of Jeanie Buss, had no hesitation in applauding her decision and the legacy she now leaves behind. Taking to X, Johnson poured out a series of personal and public reflections.“Job well done to my sister Jeanie Buss for striking an incredible deal and picking the right person to carry on the @Lakers legacy and tradition of winning - Mark Walter, my business partner and friend! Mark Walter is the best choice and will be the best caretaker of the Laker brand. The proof is in the pudding on what he’s been able to accomplish with the LA Dodgers.Mark has been nothing short of a winner notching 2 World Series and 11 NL West divisional titles in the last 12 years!” Johnson wrote.Mark Walter, already a minority stakeholder in the Lakers since 2021, also owns the Los Angeles Dodgers, the WNBA’s Sparks, and interests in Chelsea FC and a Formula 1 team. His entry into majority ownership, as confirmed to CNBC, is viewed not just as a business move but as a strategic continuation of LA's winning culture.“Laker fans should be ecstatic. A few things I can tell you about Mark – he is driven by winning, excellence, and doing everything the right way. AND he will put in the resources needed to win! I can understand why Jeanie sold the team to Mark Walter because they are just alike – they are competitive people, have big hearts, love to give back, and both prefer to be behind the scenes. This makes all the sense in the world. I am so so SO happy and excited for @Lakers fans all over the world!!” Johnson added.The sale marks the end of a 46-year legacy that began when Dr. Jerry Buss purchased the Lakers for $67.5 million in 1979. Under the Buss family's leadership, the franchise flourished, capturing 11 NBA championships and becoming a global brand. Jeanie Buss, who took over as governor in 2013 following her father’s passing, will retain her position and a minority share post-sale.“Just like I thought, when the Celtics sold for $6B, I knew the Lakers were worth $10B!” Johnson stated, referencing the Celtics’ March 2025 sale to private equity executive Bill Chisholm.Despite the mammoth valuation, the Lakers’ home—Crypto.com Arena—is not included in the deal, which makes the sheer franchise value even more staggering.“I know that my sister Jeanie would have only considered selling the Lakers organization to someone she knows and trusts would carry on the Buss legacy, started by her father Dr. Buss. Now she can comfortably pass the baton to Mark Walter, with whom she has a real friendship and can trust. She’s witnessed him build a winning team with the Dodgers and knows that Mark will do right by the Lakers team, organization, and fans! Both are extremely intelligent, visionaries, great leaders, and have positively impacted the greater Los Angeles community! I love both my sister @JeanieBuss and my business partner Mark Walter,” Johnson shared in another post.The sale, which still requires formal league approval, is expected to close within months. For Johnson, the emotion was palpable when he spoke directly to Jeanie.“I just talked to my sister Jeanie Buss to tell her congratulations, and that I’m so happy for her and family. I told her that her dad Dr. Buss would be very proud of her for getting $10B for the Lakers, the largest sports franchise sale in history!” he wrote.Also Read: Los Angeles Lakers $10 Billion Sale Shatters Sports Franchise Records; Buss Family Makes NBA History The Lakers, with 17 NBA championships and a global fanbase, are entering a new era.

Jonathan Toews adds veteran poise and winning mentality to the Winnipeg Jets

At 37 years of age, Jonathan Toews finds himself ready to once again lace up the skates, not for just any team but for the home team, the Winnipeg Jets. After leaving the NHL due to health issues, the three-time Stanley Cup champion is making a comeback in the league with a one-year deal expected to come to fruition on July 1. This move brings him back to Manitoba, and given the anticipated return to the shape of the veteran center, hopes of him making an impact in the 2025 season are rekindled.The arrival of Jonathan Toews to Winnipeg is much more than just a nice hometown return. It is good reinforcement for a team facing leadership voids, with captain Adam Lowry expected to sit out at least until the start of the season because of a late-stage hip surgery. Toews comes in-proven leader and an added forward. Formerly captain of the Chicago Blackhawks, Toews is a 15-year veteran of the NHL elite and a three-time Stanley Cup champion at that.For Winnipeg, Toews offers NHL prowess, face-off dominance, high-pressure composure, and a great hockey sense: traits that almost defined the Blackhawks' heyday. Through 2023, he had an absence from the ice due to immune-related health complications, but Toews' resurrection hints at his not only physical and mental recovery, but also his return to embracing top-level competition with a palpable tang.Kevin Cheveldayoff, Jets GM, emphasized the special qualities of a player with Toews' background: from the intimate knowledge of his hometown to his competitive nature, to his joining locker-room experience under a proud player. He further enunciated that Toews' presence alone could provide a stabilizing voice for young teammates and perpetuate the winning culture.It could not be a better time for him to join. Winnipeg, making inroads in the past few seasons, can surely benefit from Toews' seasoned insights and offer him a skilled and tested playoff mindset. With a very long layoff, his role may be a transitional one at first.

Everybody looks like a superstar before real games are played, commented one fan for Indianapolis Colts' newest quarterback Daniel Jones

Fans commented on that X post with in-chorus reactions:

Yeah bro its practice hero season for him. He’ll be trash or on a stretcher before September. He aint throwing Darts though

Never had an issue with him throwing balls in SPRING PRACTICE like MOST QBs. Its when football actually turns into football thats his bugaboo

He does this every offseason. Why we had false hope every year

He always looked alright in practice but game time with pass rush he crumbled under the pressure

He does this ts every year in camp

The problem was never when he was in shorts

He always looks solid in practice lol

He always did in the off-season program and practice. Games came and he hid in his shell

Everybody looks like a superstar before real games are played ! He fooled us 6 seasons in a row think I’m gonna fall for that now lmao

He did this with the Giants too. The second it matters he crumbles

My dude. Its practice. Danny Jones is the best minicamp qb ever

That’s cuz it’s practice. He did that sh*t for us. Watch if he gets into actual live game action

He threw nice deep balls during practice. Also, prior years before the injuries he also threw good deep balls

Always threw a nice ball, in practice. his problem is processing under real game speed

Always a good “in shorts” QB

Daniel Jones may shine in Indianapolis because their offensive line is better than the one he got in New York

A chance to compete for the starting quarterback position with a third-year veteran, Anthony Richardson.

Richardson has been inconsistent ever since he was drafted by the Indianapolis Colts.

Jones played with quarterback Sam Darnold in the Minnesota Vikings.

Creative offensive head coach Shane Steichen, who turned the raw talent of Jalen Hurts into an MVP-caliber quarterback in Philadelphia, would coach Jones in Indianapolis.

Steichen could maximize Jones’ talent in Indianapolis because he has a better offensive line there as compared to the one he had in New York.

NEW DELHI: India’s young batting star Yashasvi Jaiswal produced a fighting, memorable hundred in the first Test against England at Headingley, Leeds, on Friday. Battling intense hand cramps and visible discomfort, the 23-year-old showed remarkable grit and composure to reach his fifth century in Test cricket.Despite the physical struggle, Jaiswal stood tall against a lacklustre England bowling attack, dispatching deliveries with power and precision. His aggressive intent never waned as he punished anything loose with confidence, scoring freely across all parts of the ground.Jaiswal reached his hundred off 159 deliveries — an innings that featured 16 crisp boundaries and a towering six. It was a perfect mix of resilience and flair as he carried India forward with an authoritative knock.The emotional moment of his century was captured and shared online by 14-year-old Vaibhav Suryavanshi, a rising cricket talent who idolises Jaiswal.In the video, Jaiswal is seen on 99 before nudging a single off Brydon Carse to bring up his hundred.His celebration was full of passion — a loud roar, a leap in the air, helmet off, arms stretched, followed by a warm hug from Shubman Gill at the other end.With this knock, Jaiswal entered an elite list of Indian batters who have scored centuries in their maiden Test innings on English soil.Murali Vijay’s 146 at Trent Bridge in 2014Vijay Manjrekar’s 133 at Headingley in 1952Sourav Ganguly’s iconic 131 at Lord’s in 1996Sandeep Patil’s unbeaten 129 at Old Trafford in 1982And now, Yashasvi Jaiswal’s unbeaten 100 at Headingley in 2025Jaiswal’s superb innings eventually came to an end when England captain Ben Stokes produced a beauty.

Nick Knight EXCLUSIVE: On Shubman Gill and absence of Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma in England

Former England captain Michael Vaughan delivered a stark assessment of Virat Kohli 's Test cricket legacy in England, noting that while his leadership and presence will be missed during the five-match series, his batting average of 33.21 in English conditions doesn't warrant significant concern ahead of India's upcoming Test series starting in Leeds.

Maybe they've been waiting for this moment. Don't be surprised that they play really well,"" Vaughan added, highlighting the potential of India's emerging cricketers.","Former england captain michael vaughan says virat kohli's batting average of 33.21 in english conditions doesn't warrant significant concern.

After winning his second Stanley Cup, Brad Marchand made sure to use the moment not just to celebrate, but to send a not-so-subtle reminder to teams that once doubted the Florida Panthers roster. One of his sharpest jabs came at the Calgary Flames, who once traded away both Sam Bennett and Matthew Tkachuk, now vital parts of Florida’s championship core.It has been a difficult stretch for the Flames. Missing the playoffs for three straight seasons while watching Tkachuk and Bennett dominate the postseason makes the trades sting even more. The Matthew Tkachuk deal, though initially considered a strong return, hasn’t aged well. Calgary received Jonathan Huberdeau and Mackenzie Weegar, but Huberdeau’s struggles in Calgary have been well-documented.The 37-year-old Marchand, acquired by Florida from Boston earlier in the year, has leaned fully into his new role as both on-ice leader and off-ice agitator. At the celebratory dinner that quickly turned into a nightclub-style party, Marchand publicly thanked teams like Calgary for “giving up on” key players like Bennett and Tkachuk.Brad Marchand has never been one to shy away from controversy. Now, as a Cup winner again, he’s embracing the spotlight with the same energy he brought on the ice. For the Calgary Flames, his post felt like salt in a still-fresh wound.
