The two have been soaking up the sun and relaxing by the ocean and playing in the water. Livvy closed out her gymnastics career at LSU in April.

After a fine rookie season, things have not been as successful in 2025. Four wins, three losses, a decent 2.77 ERA, 47 punch outs, and 0.95 WHIP, but the wins certainly did not come easy.The last outing was against the St. Louis Cardinals on May 6, allowing two runs over six innings. The Pirates lost, Paul Skenes wants to rebound in his next start on May 12 against the New York Mets.Despite her relaxing vacation, Livvy remains supportive of Paul amid his pitching struggles.

Kuminga’s playoff role expands amid Warriors’ injury woes

Game 2 of the Warriors-Timberwolves series took a dramatic turn as Golden State faced a 17-point deficit at halftime. Withsidelined due to a hamstring strain, head coach Steve Kerr made a bold adjustment, insertinginto the starting lineup for the second half. The Warriors ’ offense sputtered without Curry, who played just 13 minutes in Game 1 before exiting with the injury.Steve Kerr scrambled for solutions, using 14 different players in the first half—a playoff record since at least 1998, according to NBA on ESPN. The lineup shuffling failed to generate momentum, as Minnesota capitalized on Golden State’s disjointed play.Jonathan Kuminga, who had been largely out of the rotation since returning from injury late in the season, provided a rare bright spot late in the second quarter with an eight-point surge. His energy prompted Kerr to make a decisive move.At the start of the third quarter, Jonathan Kuminga replaced Quentin Post in the lineup, signaling Kerr’s urgency to spark a comeback. Anthony Slater of The Athletic noted the shift on social media, highlighting Kuminga’s late-first-half production as the catalyst for the change.The Timberwolves, led by Jimmy Butler, continued to exploit Golden State’s defensive gaps, but Kuminga’s athleticism offered a potential counter. His ability to attack the rim and defend multiple positions gave the Warriors a dimension they sorely lacked in Curry’s absence.Steve Kerr’s handling of Kuminga has been a storyline since the forward’s return from injury. Limited minutes late in the season raised questions about his playoff role, but Curry’s injury forced Kerr’s hand. With the series shifting to Golden State for Game 3, Kuminga’s second-half performance could determine whether he remains a fixture in the rotation.The Warriors stole home-court advantage by winning Game 1, but Stephen Curry’s status looms large. If he misses extended time, Kuminga’s emergence becomes even more critical.

Meanwhile, Kerr’s lineup experiments highlight the team’s urgency—desperation meets adaptability. With the series shifting back to San Francisco, all eyes will be on whether Kuminga can solidify his role or if Minnesota’s dominance continues. One thing’s certain: the Warriors’ playoff survival now hinges on unexpected heroes stepping up.","Golden state warriors trail by 17 at halftime after experimental rotations.

LeBron James details first knee injury of his life, which made him miss the Met Gala

The Los Angeles Lakers ' season wrapped up with a disappointment. And the small losses aside, the biggest regret for the team's loyalists is the fact that another season just went by where LeBron James' prime has gone to waste as he had to move aside after sustaining a knee injury. LeBron suffered a Grade 2 MCL sprain in his left knee from his collision with DiVincenzo in Game 5, and during a recent appearance on a podcast, he revealed he hinted at his retirement.In fact, as per some rumours, James may become a free agent this summer, but retirement is also a possibility. The star has spoken extensively about this decision in recent offseasons, and it appears that the end of his career is approaching.This season, James averaged 24.4 points, 7.8 rebounds, and 8.2 assists, and many experts believe that the next season might even be his final. It's no secret that James' 2025 season was cut short due to a knee injury, which even made him skip the Met Gala. On the latest episode of the 'Mind the Game' podcast with Steve Nash, LeBron revealed something surprising.King James, as he's fondly known as admitted that this is the first knee injury of his life! ""In my 22-year career, this is my first knee injury. I've had regular tendonitis, patella, all that stuff, but this is the first time I have had a sustained knee injury where you gotta get off your feet. You gotta be shelved for a minute,"" he said.He further explained, ""I knew when the impact happened between me and DiVincenzo, my knee locked up. That's why I stayed on the ground. If the knee would release a little bit, but I knew right then and there with the pain that I had never felt before... My knee bent inward, and that's the MCL injury I picked up. The doc told me that it would take four to six weeks. I have four to six weeks now.""""Even if we won Game 5, I would have missed 6 and 7, and even further. I have some time now to get it right and get back to full strength,"" he added.LeBron disclosed that he was prepared to wait until Friday for an MRI after sustaining the injury on Wednesday, but the pain he experienced upon waking on Thursday made him move up the imaging appointment. LeBron also mentioned retirement during the podcast and shared that he would make this decision with his family after the Lakers' final game of the season.""I haven't had the conversation with the family yet as far as me going forward or whatever the case may be,"" the 40-year-old said during Thursday's episode of Mind the Game with Steve Nash (35:25 mark). ""But we'll see what happens.""",Lebron james suffered a grade 2 mcl sprain in his left knee from his collision with divincenzo in game 5.

Cleveland Cavaliers Without Mobley: The Challenge Ahead

Theface a crucial moment in their Eastern Conference semifinal series against the Indiana Pacers , with their playoff hopes hanging in the balance as star forwardbattles an ankle injury. As the series shifts to Indianapolis for Game 3, Mobley’s status remains officially questionable, casting uncertainty over the Cavs’ game plan and their prospects for a comeback.Evan Mobley, who suffered a left ankle sprain during the fourth quarter of Game 1, missed Game 2 alongside Darius Garland (toe) and De’Andre Hunter (thumb).All three participated in a team walk-through on Thursday, “touched the ball,” and are listed as questionable for Game 3, according to head coach Kenny Atkinson. While there is optimism within the organization, sources report Mobley was moving cautiously during practice, suggesting he is still managing the effects of his injury. A final decision on his availability will likely be made closer to tip-off.Evan Mobley has been a cornerstone for the Cleveland Cavaliers , earning the franchise’s first-ever Defensive Player of the Year award this season. His two-way presence is vital, anchoring the defense and providing efficient scoring. In Game 1 against the Pacers, Mobley delivered an impressive stat line:- 20 points- 10 rebounds- 2 assists- 2 steals- 9-of-13 shooting (69.2% FG)His ability to protect the rim, switch onto perimeter players, and contribute offensively makes him irreplaceable in Cleveland’s system. Over the postseason, Mobley has accumulated 170 points and 72 rebounds, underscoring his consistency and importance.If Evan Mobley is unable to play in Game 3, the Cleveland Cavaliers face a daunting task. In Game 2, with Mobley, Garland, and Hunter sidelined, Cleveland struggled defensively and on the glass, losing 121-112 as Indiana capitalized on second-chance opportunities and interior scoring. Reserve forward Dean Wade and guard Ty Jerome were pressed into larger roles, but neither can replicate Mobley’s defensive impact or offensive versatility.Without Mobley, the Cavaliers must rely more heavily on Donovan Mitchell, who scored 48 points in Game 2, and hope for increased contributions from Jarrett Allen and the supporting cast. Defensively, Cleveland will need to tighten rotations and gang-rebound to compensate for Mobley’s absence.Also read: Will Darius Garland play tonight against the Indiana Pacers? Latest update on the Cleveland Cavaliers star's injury report for Game 3 (May 9, 2025) Evan Mobley’s status for Game 3 remains uncertain, but his presence-or absence-will be a decisive factor as the Cavaliers attempt to avoid a 0-3 series deficit. If he is unable to suit up, Cleveland’s margin for error shrinks considerably, and their ability to contain Indiana’s offense will be severely tested. The Cavs’ playoff hopes may hinge on Mobley’s ankle and his ability to return to the court at close to full strength.","Evan mobley suffered a left ankle sprain during the fourth quarter of game 1.

Abdul Carter settles on this jersey number for Giants after denied request for Lawrence Taylor’s Jersey No. 56,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/abdul-carter-settles-on-this-jersey-number-for-giants-after-denied-request-for-lawrence-taylors-jersey-no-56/articleshow/121036225.cms,"Abdul Carter picks No. 51 for the Giants after jersey number requests denied (Image via: Getty Images)

Giants fans divided over Abdul Carter’s jersey number choice



Can Abdul Carter make Giants Jersey No. 51 his own?



Before even stepping on the field, Abdul Carter is already turning heads in New York. The Giants’ first-round pick recently made headlines by asking to wear Lawrence Taylor’s iconic No. 56, a request that was quickly denied. Now, after striking out with two retired jersey numbers, Carter has picked a new one that still gives a subtle nod to the Giants legends who came before him.Fresh off a standout career at Penn State, Carter called Taylor “the greatest football player of all time.” So when he publicly floated the idea of wearing Taylor’s retired No. 56, it didn’t go over well. Giants fans pushed back—and Taylor himself made his stance clear.“I know he would love to wear that number, but hey, I think it’s retired,” Taylor told the New York Post. “Get another number and make it famous.”After that firm rejection, Carter pivoted to another Giants great, Phil Simms. The rookie had worn No. 11 in college, and Simms initially said he’d be open to unretiring his jersey number for Carter. But soon after, Simms admitted his family overruled him. That door was shut, too.With both No. 56 and No. 11 off the table, Carter made a calculated move, he chose to wear jersey number 51—a subtle nod to both legends, taking digits from each of their iconic numbers.The No. 51 jersey number was last worn by pass rusher Azeez Ojulari, who departed for Philadelphia in the offseason. Now, it belongs to a rookie linebacker ready to leave his mark.NFL jersey numbers are more than digits, they represent history, pride, and pressure. By eyeing two retired numbers right out of the gate, Carter showed fearlessness. Some fans see it as confidence; others call it disrespect. Either way, the decision to wear No. 51 has already added another layer to Carter’s growing spotlight.Also Read: Shocking: Jordon Hudson, Bill Belichick's girlfriend, banned from UNC facility after explosive controversy Now it’s up to him to prove that he belongs.

Recapping Jimmy Butler’s performance in Game 2 of Round 2 against Minnesota Timberwolves

Golden State Warriors vs Minnesota Timberwolves Full Game 2 Highlights - May 8, 2025 | NBA Playoffs

Golden State Warriors ’ Jimmy Butler spoke to reporters after Game 2 loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves . In the postgame presser, he was asked if he felt burdened by the nickname ‘ Playoff Jimmy ’ given to him. He projected his confident and chilled-out side and shared how he devises his game plan, keeping all the expectations aside.Jimmy Butler attended the postgame presser after losing Game 2 of Round 2 to the Minnesota Timberwolves.He shared that he was not bogged down ever by the nickname ‘Playoff Jimmy’ given to him and believed that he could provide his teammates comfort when needed by playing basketball the right way. The Golden State Warriors faced various challenges with Stephen Curry missing the action due to a hamstring injury. Commenting on the expectations that his nickname ‘Playoff Jimmy’ draws, he said:“I don't have a burden or expectation.I don't. I play basketball the right way. I will continue to play basketball the right way. If that time comes where your people that are saying whatever, [I'm] supposed to score 40 or 43, whatever the case may be, I'm capable of it.”He continued, saying, ""I can do it, but I love making sure that my guys are comfortable, passing the ball to them, taking the right shots at the right time. But we'll talk about it, if that may be needed. Who knows.""Jimmy Butler had huge shoes of Stephen Curry to fill in, and his reputation as a master of the playoffs made him the center of attention. However, all the attention did not waver his focus, and he showed the same by pitching in honest efforts in Game 2.Jimmy Butler’s performance lacked the edge for which he is nicknamed ‘Playoff Jimmy’ in Game 2 against the Minnesota Timberwolves. He gave the Warriors first points on a three, but after that he failed to create magic.Unlike his stature and previous performances in postseason, he seemed a bit unsure about making his shots against the Timberwolves and lost a few important opportunities to add to the team’s score. Butler’s overall performance featured 17 points, 7 rebounds and 4 assists, which didn’t have anything extraordinary about it.Perhaps, Butler is yet to recover mentally from the pelvic injury and that showed in his defensive approach that highlighted most part of his game. His passive approach became the team’s style too, and they could not put forth a good fight against the Timberwolves.Also Read: Jimmy Butler plays through injury, reflects on his Clutch Rebound as Golden State Warriors beat Houston Rockets What do you think of Jimmy Butler’s performance in Game 2 against the Minnesota Timberwolves?

Mikko Rantanen’s unstoppable 2025 playoffs: The EDGE stats driving his historic run,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/mikko-rantanens-unstoppable-2025-playoffs-the-edge-stats-driving-his-historic-run/articleshow/121040060.cms,"Photo by Jonathan Kozub/Getty Images

EDGE stats prove Mikko Rantanen is a complete player in the 2025 playoffs

Mikko Rantanen has been on fire in the 2025 Stanley Cup Playoffs . After being traded twice this season—first from Colorado to Carolina, and then from Carolina to Dallas—he’s found a home in Texas and, in the process, has turned into the postseason’s most dangerous player. From back-to-back hat tricks to a series of standout performances, Rantanen is not only leading the Stars’ charge but also putting up numbers that make it hard to argue he isn’t the Conn Smythe frontrunner .And while everyone’s talking about his goals, there’s a hidden story in the data that shows just how well-rounded his playoff performance truly is.It’s no surprise Mikko Rantanen has been scoring at will—he’s a natural goal-scorer. But looking deep into the numbers, his success isn’t just about putting the puck in the net; it’s about where and how he’s getting his shots. Take his shot locations, for example. He’s been everywhere, from the front of the net to midrange areas, and it’s been paying off. Excluding his incredible wraparound goal against Colorado, he’s been in the 93rd percentile for high-danger shots on goal, which means he’s consistently putting himself in positions where scoring is most likely. Even more impressive is the fact that he’s scored three high-danger goals so far—putting him in the 95th percentile. But Rantanen hasn’t just been getting close to the net; his midrange game has been nearly as deadly. With four mid range goals, tied with Nathan MacKinnon for the league lead, he’s found a way to beat goalies from nearly every angle.It’s not just about shot selection, though. The other piece of the puzzle is his work ethic and skating. Rantanen has been putting in serious mileage this postseason, skating a total of 23.88 miles, which places him in the 92nd percentile among forwards. And this isn’t just cruising around—the guy is involved in every shift. His 20.53 miles at even strength ranks him in the 95th percentile, and he’s also been effective on the power play, with 3.35 miles skated during man-advantage situations (88th percentile). That work ethic is paying off with goals, too. He leads the NHL in even-strength goals with six, and he’s added two power-play goals to round out his impact.But there’s another layer to Rantanen’s dominance: his shot quality. His Projected Goal Rate (PGR)—a stat that measures how likely his shots are to result in a goal based on the quality of the attempt—sits at 8.30 percent this postseason. That’s third in the NHL, behind only Leon Draisaitl and Zach Hyman. For context, anything above 12 percent is considered a high-probability shot, so Rantanen’s number speaks to the fact that not only is he taking a lot of shots, but he’s taking a lot of good ones.Mikko Rantanen’s postseason performance isn’t just about scoring a bunch of goals and grabbing headlines—though he’s certainly doing that, too. When you look at the numbers, it’s clear his playoff run has been built on much more than just good luck. His ability to get to the right places on the ice, combined with his relentless skating and high-quality shot attempts, makes him the total package. It’s no wonder he’s considered the favorite for the Conn Smythe. If he keeps this up, there might be no stopping him—or the Dallas Stars.Also Read: Breaking down the 2025 NHL MVP finalists: Hart and Ted Lindsay award predictions","Mikko rantanen has been on fire in the 2025 stanley cup playoffs.

Amid a wave of injuries to key players, the spotlight is on star guard, who has been playing through a calf strain but remains the Cavaliers’ primary hope for a turnaround.Mitchell has been dealing with a mild calf strain, which, while not severe enough to keep him out of the lineup, has raised some concerns among fans and analysts.Despite visible discomfort and moments of limping at the end of both games against the Pacers, Mitchell has not been listed on the official injury report. Head coach Kenny Atkinson provided reassurance, stating he does not expect Mitchell to carry any injury designation heading into Game 3. Donovan Mitchell’s impact has been nothing short of heroic. In Game 2, he exploded for 48 points, carrying the Cleveland Cavaliers offensively and nearly willing them to a win despite the absence of other key contributors. His performance included highlight-reel plays and relentless scoring, but Cleveland ultimately fell short, squandering a 20-point lead and losing in the final moments. In Game 1, Mitchell also led the team in scoring, although the exact point total was not specified in the available reports. His leadership and scoring have been the Cleveland Cavaliers’ lifeline, especially with Darius Garland and Evan Mobley sidelined.Mitchell is not only Cleveland’s leading scorer but also the emotional and strategic anchor of the team. His ability to create shots, attack the rim, and draw defensive attention opens opportunities for teammates. In the playoffs, his scoring average has soared, and his usage rate has spiked as the Cleveland Cavaliers have leaned heavily on his offensive production. Without Mitchell, Cleveland’s offense would struggle to generate quality looks, and their ability to keep pace with Indiana’s high-powered attack would be severely diminished.If Mitchell’s calf strain were to worsen or force him out of the lineup, the Cleveland Cavaliers’ prospects would become dire. The team would have to rely on secondary scorers like Caris LeVert, while hoping for unexpected contributions from the bench. The absence of Mitchell’s shot creation and leadership would put immense pressure on Cleveland’s already depleted roster, making a comeback in the series highly unlikely.Also read: Will Darius Garland play tonight against the Indiana Pacers?

What the Cleveland Cavaliers Can Do If Garland Remains Out

Theare facing a critical juncture in their playoff series against the Indiana Pacers, and the status ofhas become a central storyline. After missing four consecutive playoff games with a painful toe sprain, Garland’s potential return for Game 3 could be decisive as the Cavaliers attempt to climb out of a 2-0 series deficit.has been sidelined since aggravating his toe injury during Game 2 of the first-round series against the Indiana Pacers. While he has been progressing in his recovery, he has yet to participate in full-contact practice. Head coach Kenny Atkinson recently reported that Garland, along with Evan Mobley and De’Andre Hunter, took part in Thursday’s walk-through, but there was no live action. All three remain listed as questionable for Game 3, with their availability to be determined just before tipoff. There is optimism within the organization that Garland could make his return, providing a much-needed boost to the struggling Cavaliers.Before his injury, Garland was a key force for Cleveland. In the 2024-25 regular season, he averaged 20.6 points, 6.7 assists, and 2.9 rebounds per game, ranking 12th in the league in assists and shooting an efficient 47.2% from the field. In his last two games before the injury, he posted back-to-back 25-point outings, including a 25-point, 5-assist performance in a win over Detroit and another 25 points in a loss to Boston. In the first two games of the Miami series, Garland averaged 24.0 points on 51.6% shooting and 41.2% from three, along with 7.0 assists-a testament to his offensive orchestration and scoring prowess.Garland’s absence has been deeply felt. The Cleveland Cavaliers’ offense has struggled to keep pace with Indiana’s high-octane attack, particularly in Game 1, where Cleveland lost 121-112 and failed to match the Pacers’ tempo and shot creation. Backup guard Ty Jerome has filled in admirably but lacks Garland’s speed and playmaking, which has slowed Cleveland’s transition game and limited their offensive versatility.If Garland is unable to play in Game 3, the Cleveland Cavaliers will need to continue relying on Donovan Mitchell , who erupted for 48 points in Game 2, as the primary offensive engine. The team will also look for increased playmaking from secondary ball handlers like Caris LeVert and Ty Jerome, while hoping for contributions from their frontcourt to compensate for Garland’s absence. However, without their star point guard, Cleveland’s margin for error shrinks considerably, especially against a Pacers squad that thrives in transition and boasts one of the league’s most dynamic backcourts.Also read: Cleveland Cavaliers Injury Update (May 9, 2025): Is Evan Mobley Playing in Game 3 vs the Indiana Pacers?

How to play NYT Connections



Don't analyse the connections too deeply.

The game tends to employ simple links such as sounding similar, similar spellings, or common themes.

Example: ""dear"" and ""deer"" tend to be linked by sound, not by some elaborate relationship such as predator and prey.

You have only four guesses per puzzle per day, so every guess matters.

Don't mindlessly click—consider each set carefully before submitting.

Try to come up with at least three connected words confidently before trying a set.

The initial organization is deliberately mischievous to mislead you.

Shuffling the words may allow you to see new patterns or concealed connections.

Shuffle it as a routine to begin and whenever you are stuck.

A rising NHL defenseman with potential for the San Jose Sharks?



International success raises expectations but NHL transition remains uncertain for Hävelid



The San Jose Sharks are stirring up the NHL waters once again, making headlines with the announcement of their newest signing: defenseman Mattias Hävelid . At just 21 years old, Hävelid has been carving out a name for himself in Sweden, and now, he's making the leap to the NHL after penning a three-year, entry-level contract with the Sharks. But is this a masterstroke of scouting or another risky gamble by a franchise in need of serious revamping?Mattias Hävelid’s résumé is undeniably impressive for someone of his age.In his recent season with Linköping HC and Djurgårdens IF, Hävelid racked up solid numbers, finishing as one of the top contributors on the blue line. He logged 14 points, including two goals and 12 assists, for Djurgårdens, and helped lead them to a HockeyAllsvenskan Championship with an impactful postseason performance. His success at both ends of the rink in Sweden raises one burning question: Is he ready to translate this success into the NHL?Hävelid’s experience in the Swedish Hockey League (SHL) shows promise, with 43 games under his belt and a tally of 12 points. The defenseman’s offensive upside, combined with his ability to play both power play and penalty kill roles, makes him a versatile asset. But here’s the kicker: the SHL is not the NHL. The level of competition, the speed, and the physicality differ drastically. Hävelid’s size, standing at 5’10” and weighing 176 pounds, could also be a factor in whether he can withstand the grind of North American hockey, where larger, more aggressive players dominate.The Sharks have been rebuilding for some time now, and Hävelid's signing looks like part of that long-term plan. But this isn’t the first time San Jose has taken a shot on an international prospect who hasn't quite proven themselves on the big stage. Are the Sharks making the right bet, or is this just another misstep in their roster construction?Hävelid’s international experience with Sweden's U-18 and U-20 teams certainly suggests a bright future. He was instrumental in Sweden’s gold medal-winning campaign at the 2022 U-18 World Juniors, leading all defensemen in goals, assists, and points. His silver medal at the 2024 World Juniors, where he finished among the top contributors in assists and points, further elevates his profile.However, translating that international success into the NHL is no guarantee. The transition from junior hockey to the pros is a monumental one, and Hävelid's development will be heavily scrutinized over the next few seasons.Also Read: Oilers lean on depth and drama to snatch Game 2 from Vegas With the Sharks in need of a solid defenseman to build their future around, Hävelid may be their guy, if he can adjust to the league’s demands quickly. But with their franchise in flux, fans may be left wondering: Will this gamble pay off, or will the Sharks be left wishing for a better defensive prospect? Time will tell, but the pressure is on.",Mattias hävelid signs a three-year deal with the san jose sharks. The 21-year-old defenseman has played in 43 games for linköping hc and djurgårdens if.
