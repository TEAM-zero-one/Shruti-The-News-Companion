Taylor Swift Has “Distanced” Herself From Blake Lively Because Of This Reason, Fans Say



Blake Lively Was Not Spotted With Taylor Swift At Super Bowl 2025



Taylor Swift, the billionaire pop star, has been in the news since she got booed at the Super Bowl last weekend when Travis Kelce’s team, the Kansas City Chiefs lost the trophy to the Philadelphia Eagles. Away from the Super Bowl drama, the pop star has also found herself involved in the legal drama between Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni. But now, the reason why Taylor Swift has “distanced” herself from Blake Lively is pretty clear, according to fans.Taylor Swift has remained pretty silent about the whole controversial situation and is yet to make an official announcement about it. It seems like fans have found the reason behind it.A fan took to X and wrote, “The fact that Taylor Swift, huge advocate of the womens movement, didnt support bestie Blake Lively speaks volumes. If anyone would support, know and have proof that Blake was harrassed it would be Taylor Swift. Talks, calls, texts...Yet Taylor didn't support it. Hmmm”Another fan wrote, “If my bestfriend who made me godmother to her children was in a legal battle over sexual harassment & retaliation, I would be standing ten toes down with her. I would not abandon her. The fact that Taylor Swift distanced herself from Blake Lively is damning enough.”While it is not confirmed why Taylor Swift has not been spotted recently with her best friend, Blake Lively, fans are pretty convinced that this is the reason behind it.For the unversed, Blake Lively had accused Justin Baldoni of harassment and Justin filed a counter lawsuit against Blake Lively and her husband Ryan Reynolds accusing them of defamation and trying to take over control of their blockbuster movie, It Ends With Us. Taylor Swift was named by Justin Baldoni in the lawsuit as he felt Blake Lively tried to “use” Taylor Swift’s power and influence to gain control of the movie.Many fans also expected to see Taylor Swift and Blake Lively at the Super Bowl held last weekend but Blake was nowhere to be found at the stadium. This was in complete contrast to the 2024 Super Bowl when Blake Lively was spotted cheering on Travis Kelce as she stood next to Taylor Swift. The two were also spotted hugging each other when the Kansas City Chiefs won the trophy last year.A few days ago, a source revealed to Page Six that “Taylor really wishes Blake hadn’t dragged her into this whole situation.” This might be true considering how Taylor Swift has avoided being spotted with Blake Lively.With the Chiefs losing the Super Bowl, both Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift have been trolled but have remained silent. They have also not been spotted out in public since then.Also Read: Hailee Steinfeld reacts as Josh Allen gets asked out on a date during their appearance at NFL Honors",Taylor swift has been in the news since she got booed at the super bowl.

‘If that gets him back’: Dana White Seemingly Nods Conor McGregor’s Potential Match In BKFC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/mma/news/if-that-gets-him-back-dana-white-seemingly-nods-conor-mcgregors-potential-match-in-bkfc/articleshow/118365377.cms,"Conor McGregor Eyeing A BKFC Championship; Where Does That Leave UFC & Dana White?

Last year, UFC president Dana White said if Conor McGregor fights again for a promotion it ""will be sometime next year"". Late last year, the Irish UFC star was ordered to pay Nikita Hand almost 250,000 euros in damages and her legal costs. After he was found liable for assault in a civil r**e case. And now that McGregor has declared his intentions to be a bare-knuckle fighting champion, White has seemingly okayed McGregor’s possible return to the ring once again.McGregor who’s also known as The Notorious One made waves recently when he shared his intentions of stepping into the BKFC ring. ""If you think I'm here giving these speeches and leading these men into battle and that I'm not going to step in myself, think again. Without a doubt. Conor McGregor will fight in the Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship, mark my words. I would do it for free,"" Conor said at a recent press conference when asked about the BKFC event scheduled to be held in April.However, McGregor is under contract with the UFC and reportedly has two fights remaining on his contract. So, fans were naturally curious to find out whether he would return to the UFC ring before his BKFC conquests.David Feldman, president of BKFC, reportedly met with White to get his approval to feature McGregor in the BKFC fight. There is something at stake. I think the UFC will probably be willing to collaborate in that regard because they collaborate with Bare Knuckle. And Conor is an owner, a minority owner, so there might be something there if that gets Conor back in the ring,"" UFC star Brendan Schaub, in his podcast, The Schaub Show.McGregor also known as ‘Notorious’, has been a staple in the UFC for over a decade and chances are, his much-anticipated stint in bare-knuckle boxing will up his value, and lead his UFC investors to a profit in the near future.There’s quite a bit of speculation surrounding his BKFC debut and fans are now anticipating the possibility of seeing McGregor face off against Eddie Alvarez or a rematch with rival Nate Diaz in the bare-knuckle arena.","Conor mcgregor has declared his intentions to be a bare-knuckle fighting champion.

Barrett, who was drafted third overall by the Knicks in 2019, spent four-and-a-half seasons in New York before being traded to Toronto in January 2024. While he was a reliable secondary scorer for the Knicks, his inconsistent three-point shooting and underwhelming playoff performances led to his departure. Since joining the Raptors, Barrett has shown flashes of improvement, averaging 21.8 points per game on 55.3% shooting from the field and 39.2% from beyond the arc in 32 games last season.This season, RJ Barrett’s shooting efficiency has dipped slightly, but he’s started February strong, posting 23.5 points per game while shooting 51.3% from the field and 36.4% from three-point range. If he can sustain this level of play, Barrett could become an attractive option for teams like the Los Angeles Lakers , who are in need of reliable perimeter scoring to complement Doncic.Pairing RJ Barrett with Luka Doncic would create a dynamic offensive duo. Doncic’s ability to draw defenders and kick the ball out to a capable shooter like Barrett could elevate the Lakers’ offense to new heights. However, any potential deal would depend on the Raptors’ willingness to part ways with RJ Barrett and the Los Angeles Lakers’ ability to make the finances work.Also read: NBA Offseason Rumors: Los Angeles Lakers in potential pursuit of $8 million Golden State Warriors center to support the Luka-LeBron deadly duo As the offseason approaches, all eyes will be on Barrett and whether the Los Angeles Lakers can pull off a move to bring him to Los Angeles.

Kendall Gill shared NBA execs’ verdict on the GOAT debate

The debate on LeBron James Michael Jordan , the greatest of all time debate is far from settling as it comes up with new perspectives. While James still has, at least a few years on his sleeves and he has been on a streak of adding more records to his already stunning basketball resume, Jordan’s impact in the basketball narrative has always been on top alongside James. Now, in a recent interview, former Chicago Bulls star Kendall Gill shared that NBA executives already have theirpick in the debate.NBA has never openly shared its pick on the LeBron James vs. Michael Jordan GOAT debate. While it has been a safe play for the league to maintain the balance among fans, former NBA star Kendall Gill seemingly has the answer to the long-time debated question as he shared that he got it from NBA executives at the United Center. In a recent chat with the 2 Raw 4 TV podcast, the former NBA star gave the inside scoop on the matter.“I’m at the United Center all the time. And I did this specifically to get answers from executives of other teams. I go downstairs and ask each executive: ‘In their prime, who would you take in the draft—Michael Jordan or LeBron James?’ Just one executive chose LeBron over Jordan. That tells you everything,” Gill said.That tells you everything? Of course, most have been long-time devout fans of Jordan but James has also made his case strong. Additionally, it is also hard to compare the legends following their statistics.James is on top in regards to both their career points holding a stunning 41,641 points and continuing while Jordan posted 32,292 points in his legendary career. James has 21 All-Star selections to his credit while Jordan ended his career with 14. James has never won the Defensive Player of the Year award in his career. In the 1987–88 season, Jordan won the NBA Defensive Player of the Year award, becoming the first player to claim both the scoring title and DPOY in the same year. Jordan has 10 NBA scoring titles, which is the most in NBA history while James has claimed only one. Michael Jordan won the MVP award five times and James is a four-time NBA MVP.Also Read: “Go f**k it, go”: LeBron James explains what his wife Savannah James endured to influence his basketball legacy The stats continue and both the legends have made their marks in the league in different ways.

Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift might make their red carpet debut at the Met Gala

Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift, who have been dating since summer 2023, may be making their red carpet debut this year. They could have attended major red carpet events like Swift's Eras Tour film premiere in Los Angeles in October 2023 and the Grammys and VMAs in 2023 and 2024, but decided against them due to scheduling or unknown reasons. With Swift's Eras Tour over and Kelce having a break before the next football season, this event might be the perfect opportunity for them to make their red carpet debut.Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift have been busy with social engagements and busy schedules since dating in 2023. Taylor's Eras Tour and Travis' role in helping the Kansas City Chiefs win three consecutive Super Bowls make them as busy as any celebrity couple.Both Swift and Kelce, who are off the road after a disappointing Super Bowl loss, are expected to attend the Met Gala red carpet on May 5. People Magazine reports that they will make headlines due to their fashion expertise and previous attendance at the event. Both Swift and Kelce are expected to make a statement at the event.“As part of their R&R time, it's thought the couple could finally make an official red carpet appearance together — with the Met Gala earmarked as their first potential event together,” the Mirror reported of Kelce and Swift. “So far Swift and Kelce, who began dating in 2023, have struggled to align their schedules to step out together at an event.”Swift and her boyfriend Kelce have decided to attend the Met Gala, a first for Swift, as she hasn't attended the event with any of her boyfriends since 2016. This follows their 2023 invitation to the Oscars, where they also declined. “… However the Met Gala isn't until May, and with Swift not planning to tour this year it's thought she and Kelce could turn out at the red carpet event together. The event would be a ‘relationship first' for the pair as they anticipated to step out together.”Also Read: “Negotiate with terrorists”: Saturday Night Live producer branded Travis Kelce's girlfriend Taylor Swift a terrorist Taylor Swift has been supporting Kansas City Chief and Travis Kelce after the Super Bowl 59 loss, but was unable to cheer on Kelce.

“It was my idea. I just felt that the negotiation had gone on so long, I just wanted to make sure that he heard from us how we felt about him. I just felt like he deserved that respect.

“And so David and I flew down to Tampa, had a great conversation over a few hours, and frankly Pete did all the talking. Scott Boras was there and Scott didn’t say a freaking word the whole time. And it was like I turned to him, I go, 'I just want to make sure... you're still breathing over there!'”

""I love it. That means you're onto something, you're doing something well. Last year, we might've been a little bit of an underdog. Now all of the sudden, people are noticing, 'Hey, this is a good team.' And that's the way I want it. We want to come into every season with high expectations.”

Pete Alonso’s re-signing with the New York Mets has been one of the hot topics of the offseason.

While fans are curious about the nature of their relationship, there is a bizarre speculation going around that Taylor Rooks was “previously with” Ceedee Lambs.A fan took to X and wrote, “Wasn’t she just with CeeDee Lamb?”, while another fan wrote, “Wasnt she just with CeeDee lamb last week??”A third fan wrote, “CeeDee punching air rn”. The reason for this speculation is, just a day before the Super Bowl, Taylor Rooks was spotted with Ceedee Lambs at a party in New Orleans.In the pictures that have gone viral, Ceedee Lamb is dressed in a white graphic T-shirt as he wrapped his arm around Taylor Rooks. Taylor Rooks looked stunning as she wore a black strapless dress and big golden hoops. She kept her short hair open and opted for minimal makeup to complete her look for the night.When the picture of Taylor Rooks with Ceedee Lamb had gone viral, fans were losing their minds over how beautiful they looked together. A fan wrote, “Now that is a beautiful couple!”, while another fan wrote, “If this his gf lamb is winning she’s beautiful let’s go Lamb!”Currently, there is no confirmation if Taylor Rooks is dating either of the NFL players or is just friends with both of them but fans have made up their own stories.As for Joe Burrow, he remains officially single as he has not confirmed any relationship rumours after his relationship with ex girlfriend Olivia Holzmacher ended in 2023. Olivia Holzmacher and Joe Burrow met in college back in 2017 and remained together for a couple of years.She was also spotted cheering on for Joe Burrow many times and there were also rumours about an engagement. As luck would have it, things did not work out between the two and they broke up.Later, Joe Burrow was rumoured to be dating famous Olivia Ponton but the two have not confirmed their relationship yet.Also Read: Taylor Swift has ""fresh evidence"" against her in Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni drama that is raising new questions","Cincinnati bengals quarterback joe burrow was recently spotted with a woman.

Segment with Gunther and Jey Uso

Penta vs. Pete Dunne

Raquel Rodriguez vs. Roxanne Perez

Seth Rollins vs. Finn Bálor

WWE RAW this week saw the last few slots for the Elimination Chamber being filled, along with other exciting matches and heated moments taking place.The February 17th, 2025, edition of Monday Night RAW was presented from the Spectrum Center in Charlotte, North Carolina. The show continued the road to the WWE Elimination Chamber with more qualifying matches and explosive in-ring action by superstars.Sami Zayn returns to RAW after being taken out with a Piledriver assault by Kevin Owens. He accepted Kevin Owens' challenge for the Elimination Chamber, but RAW GM Adam Pearce refused to make the match, considering Sami is still not cleared. But Zayn insists on Pearce and claims that he is not afraid of the repercussions. Following a huge verbal back and forth, in the end, Adam Pearce makes the match, but an Unsanctioned match.The match was made last week after AJ Styles returned to RAW and had an altercation with Dominik Mysterio and Carlito. The action went back and forth as Dominik displayed an exceptional performance against The Phenomenal One. But in the end, it was not enough to put him down. Despite Carlito interfering, Styles takes him out and counters Dominik with a Styles Clash to win. After the bout, Bron Breakker tries to spear Styles, but he moves out, and Dominik Mysterio gets taken down, leading to AJ taking him out with a Pele Kick.This contest was a WWE Women’s Intercontinental Championship No.1 Contender’s Match. Dakota Kai and Ivy Nile fought with everything they had as a huge opportunity hung in the balance. In the final moments of the bout, Dakota Kai delivers a springboard stomp to the back of Ivy Nile's head. She then lifts her and hits a Go To Kick to pick up the win. As she celebrates, the champion Lyra Valkyria enters the ring to pose with her title.The World Heavyweight Champion Gunther mocks Jey Uso by entering him through the crowd. He even threatens Michael Cole and Pat McAfee for running his mouth each week and being a huge YEET movement fan. As Gunther continues to insult Jey and claim that he will end his WrestleMania dreams, the YEET man storms to the ring, breaking through the officials, and a brawl ensues between them. The officials rush to the ring to separate the duo as the segment comes to an end.Pete Dunne looked to gain momentum at the expense of RAW's newest rising star, Penta. The match was a stellar bout pitting two different styles against each other with captivating in-ring action. Towards the end of the bout, Ludwig Kaiser interferes but gets into a verbal altercation with Pete Dunne. Penta sends Pete crashing into Kaiser and hits the Penta Driver to seal the victory.This was the last Women’s Elimination Chamber Qualifying Match. The upstart Roxanne Perez went up against the dominant Raquel Rodriquez in this high-stakes bout. The match was a stellar showdown and a thrilling experience to witness. Towards the end, Bianca Belair makes her way to confront Liv Morgan. She tries to run but is stopped by Naomi. This distraction costs Raquel as Roxanne hits the Pop Rox to get the three count and pick up the win.The main event was the Men’s Elimination Chamber Qualifying Match, pitting longtime rivals Seth Rollins against Finn Balor. This was their 11th one-on-one match in WWE, and much like their previous encounters, Balor and Rollins put up yet another captivating showdown. The excellent display of in-ring prowess of both competitors, multiple counters, and near falls made it a must-see bout and led to the fans erupting in a 'This is Awesome' chant. In the end, Balor connected with a Coupe De Grace and locked in a cross face. But Rollins escaped the hold and quickly countered with a Stomp to win and get the last spot in the Elimination Chamber match.Also read: Two New Matches Teased for WWE Elimination Chamber 2025 on SmackDown","The february 17th, 2025, edition of monday night raw was presented from the spectrum center in charlotte, north carolina.

Liam Lawson Expects a Challenging Red Bull F1 Debut



Liam Lawson on the 2025 F1 Season, Advice For Rookies, & George Russell's Escape Room Skills

Liam Lawson is set to make his highly anticipated full-season debut in Formula 1, stepping into a Red Bull seat alongside Max Verstappen . However, the young Kiwi is under no illusions about the challenges ahead. With only 11 grand prix starts under his belt, all of which came in the latter half of 2023 and 2024, Lawson acknowledges that adapting to the demands of a full F1 calendar will be a daunting task.Liam Lawson was officially named as Sergio Perez’s replacement in December, following a disappointing season for the Mexican driver. Despite Red Bull’s dominant performance last year, the 22-year-old driver is not expecting immediate success, particularly given his lack of experience on several circuits that feature early in the 2025 calendar.The upcoming season will introduce Lawson to a host of unfamiliar tracks, adding an extra layer of difficulty to his transition into one of F1’s most competitive seats. “Going into a year like this, especially the start of the season, I’m going to a lot of tracks I haven’t done before,” he admitted. “I think the start of the year is going to be the hardest as well. Going to a bunch of tracks I haven’t done before starting the season, it’s going to be very, very tough.”While the Red Bull RB21 is expected to be a front-running car, Lawson is not setting unrealistic expectations for himself. His early-season schedule includes challenging circuits like Melbourne, Shanghai, Miami, and Montreal—places he has either never raced on or only experienced in junior categories. Nonetheless, he remains eager to embrace the challenge, stating, “I’m very excited for Melbourne and I’m very excited for the start of the year.”Despite the uphill battle, Lawson is looking forward to proving himself at the highest level. “There’s a lot of cool tracks that I haven’t done that I think I will enjoy, like Melbourne. China looks like a cool track, Canada is somewhere I’ve always wanted to drive.”Also Read: ""Anyone who doubts him is silly"": Lando Norris slams critics of Lewis Hamilton ahead of Ferrari F1 debut With a new team, heightened expectations, and an uncharted season ahead, Lawson is prepared for what could be his toughest yet most rewarding year in Formula 1.",Liam lawson is set to make his full-season debut for red bull in 2025.

Justin Turner's Contribution to Chicago Cubs: Offering Infield Depth and Veteran Leadership



Cubs Playoff Hopes Powered by Experience



The Chicago Cubs bolstered their roster by signing 40-year-old veteran infielder Justin Turner to a one-year, $6,000,000 contract pending a physical. Turner adds experience, leadership, and offense to a Cubs roster trying to get back to the playoffs for the first time since 2020. With third base and first base played, he adds valuable depth behind Michael Busch and rookie Matt Shaw.The Cubs have officially signed Justin Turner, adding a seasoned veteran to their roster. Turner will be a reserve at first base and add depth at third, where the Cubs intend to begin rookie Matt Shaw. Although Turner saw only six games at third last year, his veteran presence will provide much-needed stability in the infield. His leadership and postseason experience—86 career playoff games—will be an asset for the Cubs' young core.Turner is a prolific hitter well beyond his years. In his previous season, he registered a.354 on-base percentage over 139 contests for the Toronto Blue Jays and Seattle Mariners with 11 home runs and a.259 average. Throughout his 16 seasons of major league service, Turner has held an outstanding.821 OPS, a testament to his power to reach base and plate appearances. Turner's clutchness will provide the depth the Cubs offense seeks to its lineup.Turner's postseason resume is one of the main factors why Chicago signed him. The ex-Los Angeles Dodgers veteran has been involved in several deep playoff series, earning two All-Star nods and placing in the top-15 in MVP voting three times. The Cubs, who have not made the playoffs in four years, are hoping Turner's experience will lead them back into contention.Alongside the Turner signing, the Cubs also inked right-hander Chris Flexen to a minor league deal. Flexen, 30, made 30 starts for the Chicago White Sox last season and could provide additional pitching depth if called up during the season.The signing of Justin Turner represents a strategic adjustment for the Cubs in an attempt to bolster the roster with established leadership and middle-of-the-lineup depth. He is valuable because of his experience, two-way capability, and steady bat. With the spring training taking place, Turner's arrival has the potential to return the Cubs to playoff positioning in 2025.Also Read: Who is Cole Tucker’s wife Vanessa Hudgens?

Vladimir Guerrero Jr.’s take on rejecting contract extension with Blue Jays

""I am confident that we exhausted the communication, the ideas, the thoughts and communicated every dollar. The offers that we made for Vlad would've been record-setting and would've made him one of the highest-paid players in the game.""

""Listen, I want to be here. I want to be a Blue Jay for the rest of my career. But it's free agency. It's business. So I'm going to have to listen to 29 more teams and they're going to have to compete for that.""

"“Old fool”: Deion Sanders refused to be swayed by Patrick Mahomes' hype, remains a strong supporter of Tom Brady as the GOAT",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/old-fool-deion-sanders-refused-to-be-swayed-by-patrick-mahomes-hype-remains-a-strong-supporter-of-tom-brady-as-the-goat/articleshow/118314888.cms,"Image via Imagn Images

Deion Sanders chooses Tom Brady in the GOAT debate against Patrick Mahomes

Deion Sanders , known for his life and personality, recently visited New Orleans and met Kayla Nicole, Travis Kelce 's ex-girlfriend, representing I Am Athlete. During a conversation, she asked Prime a question about Tom Brady or Patrick Mahomes , which stood out among the other questions she asked.Chiefs quarterback Mahomes is on the verge of becoming the GOAT, a feat no other quarterback has achieved, including Brady. Analysts like Stephen A. Smith believe Mahomes has solidified his place in the conversation. However, Deion Mahomes, an ""old-school"" man, remains a strong supporter of Brady as the greatest of all time.Deion Sanders, a former Buffaloes coach and NFL Hall of Famer, refused to be swayed by Patrick Mahomes' hype at the 2025 NFL Honors gala, instead choosing Tom Brady in the GOAT debate. ""I'm going with Brady,"" Sanders declared confidently. ""I'm old school. Not old fool.""Despite concerns, Mahomes remains a champion with a record of seven Super Bowl titles, five Super Bowl MVPs, and three league MVPs. His longevity, dominance, and rings continue to reign supreme. Mahomes, a three-time Super Bowl winner and MVP, is being hailed as Brady's successor.However, Sanders has been lukewarm on Mahomes. When celebrating Kansas City's AFC Championship win, Sanders praised Travis Kelce, head coach Andy Reid, and even wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins-but left out the Chiefs' QB.""I got mad love for my brother, Travis Kelce, and I'm proud of all that he's accomplished,"" Sanders tweeted. ""And I'm so darn happy for one of our game's greatest receivers, DeAndre Hopkins, Coach Reid & the Chiefs. Wow, God is good.”Kayla Nicole inquired about Prime's stance on the Kendrick vs Drake controversy, and he provided a detailed response. “Come on man you know I’m a Drake guy. I’m Weezy, I’m Mack Maine. You know I’m on that side.”Deion Sanders revealed a bias towards rappers, but did not confirm if he had spoken with Drake after the beef erupted. Prime admitted, “I haven’t spoken to him about this. I love them both but it shouldn’t be all this foolishness. I don’t like all this. Can we all just get along? Can we love one another? Like unity, you and I. I don’t like that. Come on this is entertainment… I don’t like to see brothers going at it.”Also Read: “Never gets a flag”: Fans call out Travis Kelce for getting away with taunting against the Philadelphia Eagles Deion Sanders is reportedly downplaying the contributions of quarterback Mahomes, despite his significant role in the Chiefs' victory over Buffalo. Mahomes may challenge Brady's legacy, but Sanders is not yet there, and the GOAT debate is intensifying as Sanders doubles down on his pick.","Deion sanders met travis kelce's ex-girlfriend kayla nicole in new orleans. She asked him about tom brady or patrick mahomes as the goat. Sanders said he was going with brady because he is ""old school"" sanders also revealed his bias towards rappers drake and kendrick lamar.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118314880,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-38884,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
