During a drinks break in the 40th over of India's chase, KL Rahul spoke with Virat Kohli , appearing to encourage him to stay at the crease until the end. With India requiring 65 runs from 60 balls against Australia on Tuesday, KL Rahul took on the role of aggressor in this Champions Trophy semi-final in Dubai.Rahul quickly scored a four and a six in his next five deliveries to ease the pressure on Kohli. He then rotated the strike to Kohli when India needed 40 runs from 45 balls, with Kohli 16 runs away from his 52nd ODI century.Kohli, despite being in control throughout the chase, attempted an unnecessary slog sweep against Adam Zampa and was caught at long-on. This uncharacteristic dismissal visibly frustrated KL Rahul at the non-striker's end.""Main maar raha that naa (I was going after the bowling),"" Rahul told Kohli as he walked past him.In the dressing room, coach Gautam Gambhir was also left visibly upset and mumbled something to the support staff and players seated alongside him.After the match, KL Rahul revealed his conversation with Kohli. ""When I walked in and when I played 10-12 balls I told him that you're the batter that needs to go on and be there till the end. And let me try and hit or let me try and take one chance an over. Because like you said we only needed 6 runs and over. But 6 runs and over on that wicket seemed like 8-8.5. So, you had to take one chance and over, one boundary or one six,"" Rahul told Star Sports.""So, I told him that I will do that and why don't you just rotate the strike and be there because you're the set batter and it might be harder. If you get out another set batter comes it becomes a lot more harder. But yeah, he felt like it was in his range to hit and yeah he didn't time it well.""Rahul maintained his composure and finished unbeaten with 42 runs from 34 balls, securing the victory with a six in the 49th over's first ball. This win advanced India to their fifth Champions Trophy final. Hardik Pandya contributed with a quick 28 runs from 24 balls before his dismissal.Despite the one mistimed shot, Kohli's performance was exceptional. He formed a crucial 91-run partnership for the third wicket with Shreyas Iyer, who scored 45 runs, after the early dismissals of Rohit Sharma (28) and Shubman Gill (9).Although Australia were missing key players, India hadn't defeated them in ICC tournament knockouts since the 2011 World Cup quarterfinal.Kohli effectively handled leg-spinner Adam Zampa, who had previously troubled him. He utilised pull shots and drives between sweeper cover and mid-wicket for consistent scoring.After losing both Iyer and Axar Patel (27) in quick succession, Kohli reached his fifty in 53 balls. Glenn Maxwell dropped a catch when Kohli was on 51 off Cooper Connolly's bowling.Kohli's innings ended when India needed 40 runs to win, as he hit the ball to Ben Dwarshuis at long-on off Zampa's bowling.","Virat kohli was 16 runs away from his 52nd odi century.

'Nobody has a right to raise a finger on him'

NEW DELHI: The national president of All India Muslim Jamaat , Maulana Shahabuddin Razvi , on Wednesday criticised cricketer Mohammed Shami after a video of him drinking an energy drink during the Champions Trophy semifinal match against Australia in the UAE went viral, even as the Muslim community was observing Ramadan fasting.In a video shared by news agency ANI, Razvi stated, ""One of the compulsory duties is 'Roza' (fasting)...If any healthy man or woman doesn't observe 'roza', they will be a big criminal. A famous cricket personality of India, Mohammed Shami had water or some other beverage during a match.""Highlighting that Shami was physically fit to play, Razvi further said, ""People were watching him. If he is playing, it means he is healthy. In such a condition, he did not observe 'Roza' and even had water...This sends a wrong message among people.""""By not keeping 'roza', he has committed a crime. He should not do this. In the eyes of Shariat, he is a criminal. He will have to answer God.""NCP-SCP MLA Rohit Pawar came out in support of Shami, asserting that the Indian cricketer prioritises his performance over fasting. Pawar stressed that religion should not be intertwined with sports and highlighted that the Muslim community takes pride in Shami’s accomplishments.""While representing the country, if Mohammad Shami feels that his performance might get even slightly affected due to fasting and what if something happens, then he will never be able to sleep. He is a hardcore Indian who has made the team win many times. Religion should not be brought up in sports. If you ask any Muslim person today, he/she will say that they are proud of Mohammad Shami,"" Pawar stated.Executive Member of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, Maulana Khalid Rashid Farangi Mahli, defended Shami, stating that fasting is compulsory for Muslims, but there are exceptions.""It is compulsory for all Muslims to observe roza, especially in the month of Ramazan. However, Allah has clearly mentioned in the Quran that if a person is on a journey or not well, they have the option not to observe Roza. In the case of Mohammed Shami, he is on a tour, so he has the option not to observe Roza. Nobody has a right to raise a finger on him,"" he said.Shami delivered an impressive performance, conceding only 27 runs in his first seven overs. Utilising his experience, he outfoxed Australian batters with variations in speed, line and length, finishing with figures of 3/48 in 10 overs.",'religion should not be mixed with sports' says all india muslim jamaat president.

Stephen A. Smith Predicts a Major Year for Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift



Stephen A. Smith Addresses Presidential Run Rumors, Gives His Taylor Swift & Travis Kelce Hot Takes

ESPN’s Stephen A. Smith is never one to shy away from bold predictions, and his latest take has sent fans into a frenzy. The sports commentator, known for his unfiltered opinions, believes that Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce and pop sensation Taylor Swift are headed for a wedding in 2025. During his appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon on March 5, Smith confidently weighed in on the highly publicized romance, leaving Fallon and the audience in shock.Stephen A. Smith, 57, appeared on NBC’s Tonight Show to discuss a variety of topics, including the possibility of running for U.S. President in 2028. However, it was his take on Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift’s relationship that truly electrified the conversation. When Fallon asked whether the Chiefs' tight end would marry Swift in 2025, Smith’s response had the host leaping out of his seat in excitement.“I’m scared to get this wrong,” Smith admitted. “Travis Kelce, that’s my dawg. I got to tell you: a lot of ladies love Travis Kelce. Travis Kelce has loved a lot of ladies.” However, when it came to Swift, Smith had no doubts about the seriousness of the relationship. “But Taylor Swift’s a different animal. She looks good. She’s incredibly talented. And she’s worth about a billion (dollars). We’re going to guess a ‘yes’ on this one.”Smith’s enthusiastic endorsement of the relationship didn’t stop there. He went on to describe Swift as a “three-headed monster,” praising her beauty, talent, and financial empire. “You know what I’m saying? Look good, talented, and you’re a billionaire?” he raved.Kelce and Swift’s whirlwind romance has been one of the most talked-about relationships in entertainment and sports. The two officially went public in September 2023, and since then, speculation about an engagement has only intensified. Fans have noticed Swift frequently wearing gloves at Chiefs games, fueling rumors that she might be hiding a ring. The whispers only grew louder when Kelce playfully dodged questions about a possible proposal. “Wouldn’t you like to know,” he teased reporters ahead of Super Bowl 2025.Their relationship has continued to flourish, with Swift showing unwavering support for Kelce throughout the NFL season. She was in attendance for both the 2024 and 2025 Super Bowls, while Kelce reciprocated by making appearances at her record-breaking Eras Tour concerts. He even surprised fans by joining her on stage in London last June.Also Read: ""They’re not good at this"": Bill Simmons warns Tom Brady’s role with Raiders could be ‘Dangerous’ for the franchise’s future With their bond growing stronger and hints of a future together becoming harder to ignore, Stephen A.

Sunil Chhetri coaxed out of retirement to help India qualify for Asian Cup,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/chhetri-coaxed-out-of-retirement-to-help-india-qualify-for-asian-cup/articleshow/118769075.cms,"Panaji:

India’s record goal scorer Sunil Chhetri has been coaxed to come out of retirement and join the national team for the crucial final round of the AFC Asian Cup 2027 qualifiers.The 40-year-old Chhetri was included among the 26 probables for the international friendly against Maldives on March 19 and the Group C opener of the Asian Cup qualifiers against Bangladesh on March 25 in Shillong.India, without a win in the whole of 2024, have been clubbed with Bangladesh, Hong Kong and Singapore with only the top team making it to the continental showpiece in Saudi Arabia.“The qualification for the Asian Cup is very crucial for us. Given the importance of the tournament and the matches ahead, I discussed with Sunil Chhetri about making a comeback to strengthen the national team. He agreed, and so we have included him in the squad,” India coach Manolo Marquez said on Thursday.The striker had not made any official statement on this development till late Thursday. Bengaluru FC however put out a cryptic “Maybe all goodbyes are just an ‘I’ll see you soon’ in disguise,” on their official X handle.“Sunil’s leadership qualities are unmatched. He has played international football for close to two decades and a player of his stature can motivate the entire team. His form too has been impeccable in the ISL, scoring 12 goals. India can greatly benefit with a striker like him in the team,” said All India Football Federation (AIFF) president Kalyan Chaubey.Chhetri is India’s highest-ever goalscorer and was third among the world’s active players, behind Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi, when he called time on his international career in May last year. Since then, he has continued to star for Bengaluru FC and has scored goals in the Indian Super League (ISL).This season he has scored 12 goals in the ISL, second only to the Moroccan Alaaeddine Ajaraie who tops the list with a record 21 for NorthEast United. Other Indian strikers have not really delivered, prompting Marquez to fall back on the services of the veteran striker.Marquez, who also coaches FC Goa, took over the national team after Chhetri’s international retirement and will have him in the dressing room for the first time.In his first assignment — the InterContinental Cup — Marquez tried young Kiyan Nassiri, Edmund Lalrindika, Manvir Singh and Liston Colaco upfront without much success. India drew goalless against Mauritius and lost 0-3 to Syria. India did score in the next two friendlies against Vietnam and Malaysia, both ending 1-1, through Farukh Chaudhary and Rahul Bheke.The only bright spark for Marquez and Indian football this season has been the rise of Brison Fernandes, with the Goa winger’s seven goals bracketing him among the top-10 scorers in the ISL. He could provide the surprise element on the wings for the national team, if declared fit.The other big call in the national team probable list is the exclusion of goalkeeper Gurpreet Singh Sandhu. The first name on the starting list for several years, Gurpreet’s form for BFC this season has been inconsistent and marked by errors. He lost his place in the team for two games to Lalthuammawia Ralte but has since made a comeback.ISL Golden Glove contender Vishal Kaith (Mohun Bagan), Amrinder Singh (Odisha) and Gurmeet Singh (NorthEast) are the three goalkeepers in Marquez’s list.",India's record goal scorer sunil chhetri has been coaxed to come out of retirement and join the national team for the crucial final round of the afc asian cup 2027 qualifiers.

The Los Angeles Lakers are making strategic moves as they gear up for the playoffs, with reports indicating that Jordan Goodwin ’s two-way contract will soon be converted into a standard NBA deal. This decision comes as the team continues its impressive run, winning seven straight games and 18 of their last 21. To make room for Goodwin, the Lakers are likely to waive either Cam Reddish or Alex Len, with Reddish being the more probable candidate.Jordan Goodwin, a 26-year-old guard, has quickly become a valuable asset for the Los Angeles Lakers since joining the team in early February. Over eight games, he has averaged 6.1 points, 3.8 rebounds, and 1.0 assist in 16.9 minutes per game. Despite a recent right ankle sprain slowing his momentum, Goodwin’s contributions have not gone unnoticed. Head coach JJ Redick has repeatedly praised him, calling him a key rotation player.According to The Athletic’s Jovan Buha, the Los Angeles Lakers are expected to convert Goodwin’s contract as late as possible to maximize financial flexibility. ""I do expect him to be converted at the end of the season as late as possible, and then be on the playoff roster. ... He's kind of become the 9th man, and you could argue that depending on the night and depending on the matchup, he should be like the 8th man,"" Buha said on his podcast . He also hinted at a potential multi-year deal for Goodwin in the future, stating, ""I think he's going to get a multi-year contract, longer-term later in the season.""Jordan Goodwin’s journey to the Lakers began after they waived Armel Traore to open a roster spot. A four-year NBA veteran, he has previously played for Washington, Phoenix, and Memphis, holding career averages of 6.4 points, 3.8 rebounds, and 2.6 assists across 128 games.

Firing of Coach Luke Richardson sparks questions about Connor Bedard’s development

Chicago Blackhawks fans are upset with interim head coach Anders Sorensen after his blunt comments about Connor Bedard’s performance. Following a close 4-3 loss to the Minnesota Wild in December 2024, Sorensen criticized Connor Bedard and the team, urging them to be more aggressive offensively. Many fans felt this public criticism could hurt Bedard’s confidence rather than help his development.The situation has been made worse by the Blackhawks' overall struggles this season. In December 2024, the team fired head coach Luke Richardson, reportedly due to their poor performance and possibly his handling of Connor Bedard. With the team struggling in the standings, fans are growing increasingly concerned about the direction of the franchise and whether Bedard, seen as the future of the team, is being properly supported.Blackhawks beat reporter Ben Pope provided insight into Connor Bedard’s recent struggles, pointing out that despite Chicago scoring 16 goals over three games, Bedard failed to record a single point. “The Blackhawks have scored 16 goals the last 3 games yet Connor Bedard has 0 points, which is wild,” Pope posted on social media.“He knows he’s getting chances; he knows he’s setting up some chances,” said the head coach, but fans straight up disagreed. “He ain’t getting any chances at all, he’s way too slow,” one fan commented in direct contradiction of the coach’s statement.“I realize that Bedard is just 19 and playing on a horrible team, but he was terrible in the Kings game—terrible in all three zones. He should visit Donato’s skating coach in the offseason. He needs to get faster, stronger, smarter,” another fan commented.Coach Sorensen believes Connor Bedard is making the right plays but has struggled to find the net, even in the Blackhawks’ 5-1 win over the L.A. Kings. Goalie Spencer Knight stole the spotlight, making 41 saves, while Bedard praised his new teammate.However, fans were less forgiving, pointing out Bedard’s struggles in all three zones. Some suggested he needs to work on his speed, strength, and overall game to improve his impact on the ice.Concerns about Connor Bedard’s development are growing as he struggles while Ryan Donato thrives. Fans say he needs to improve his speed and skating, while critics also target Coach Sorensen’s “boring” approach. Analyst Greg Wyshynski even suggests Bedard could seek a trade if the Blackhawks remain mismanaged.Also Read: “Keep shooting and keep believing”: Auston Matthews addresses significant drop in goal scoring for the Maple Leafs As criticism of Connor Bedard grows and the Blackhawks struggle, concerns about his development and future in Chicago intensify.

Canucks' coach scoffs at Brady Tkachuk’s Quinn Hughes comments

BRADY TKACHUK & JON COOPER Join the Show - Ep. 547

Brady Tkachuk recently called out the Vancouver Canucks , suggesting they blocked Quinn Hughes from playing in the 4 Nations Face-Off for Team USA. Hughes had been recovering from an oblique injury since January 31, and despite speculation that he might join the tournament, he ultimately sat out.Brady Tkachuk implied on the Spittin' Chiclets podcast that Quinn Hughes wanted to play but wasn't cleared by the Vancouver Canucks, calling it ""shady business."" However, the Canucks maintain that Hughes' absence was purely due to his injury and recovery process.According to NHL reporter Noah Strang, Canucks coach Rick Tocchet simply laughed off Brady Tkachuk’s comments about Vancouver blocking Quinn Hughes from playing in the 4 Nations Face-Off. Strang posted on X, “Rick Tocchet says they laugh at Brady Tkachuk’s notion that #Canucks not letting Hughes play at 4 Nations was ‘shady business’. We can’t even play the guy, so how was he going to play for the Americans?”Quinn Hughes was off the ice from Jan 31 to Feb 26, making Brady Tkachuk’s claim questionable. Since returning, he’s played three games, with two losses and one assist. His injury remains unchanged, suggesting health, not interference, kept him out.Brady Tkachuk didn’t hold back when he appeared on Spittin’ Chiclets’ YouTube channel, sharing strong opinions on the 4 Nations Face-Off and the Quinn Hughes situation. “I actually FaceTimed Quinn. Kinda like when he was figuring it out when people were like, ‘Quinn might come, Quinn might not come, ’” Brady said.He continued, “I think he was all about coming, but I just don’t think he got cleared by Vancouver to play. So, it’s a little shady business to begin with. We all know who they are cheering for.” This triggered a response from Rick Tocchet.Quinn Hughes is out against the Ducks after a lower-body injury in Saturday’s Kraken game. He missed the final 9:05, skipped practice Sunday, and left Tuesday’s session early. Coach Tocchet says they’ll monitor his recovery daily.Quinn Hughes has 60 points in 50 games this season, ranking 143rd in goals but excelling in assists, placing him among the top 11 defensemen. He’s 29th overall in points. Coach Tocchet admitted Hughes hasn’t been himself lately, saying, “Eighty percent Quinn, we’ll take, but we have to be careful.” His future this season remains uncertain.Also Read: “Pretty cool feeling”: Brady Tkachuk gave his take on USA-Canada 4 Nations Face-Off fights, deemed team USA as villains With Hughes battling injuries and not at his best, his season’s trajectory remains uncertain.

Taylor Swift urged to keep her personal and professional brands separate

Taylor Swift is reportedly coming under more pressure to keep her personal life separate from her professional image. Some, according to insiders, think that her very public romance with Travis Kelce might be having a detrimental impact on her reputation. The debate was heightened after she received boos at the Super Bowl—a moment that some waved off as friendly ribbing, while others interpreted it as a sign that her involvement in the NFL universe isn't welcomed by everyone.Taylor Swift is said to be increasingly being urged to keep her personal and professional brands separate. Sources claim that certain advisers of hers are of the view that her celebrity romance with Travis Kelce might be damaging her carefully crafted persona.Disapproval mounted after she was booed at the Super Bowl, but others interpreted as definitive proof that her growing presence within the NFL community isn't for everyone. Since Swift is arguably one of the most powerful entities in the music industry, a few insiders fret that her visibility with the world of sports would bring unnecessary turmoil to her profession.At the same time, Travis Kelce is also receiving flak, especially from fans of the Kansas City Chiefs questioning if his priorities on football have been diluted. His disappointing outing in the last game of the season against the Philadelphia Eagles only added fuel to the fire, with some of them positing that his life outside the football field, including his relationship with Taylor Swift, might be affecting his performance.Once regarded as an untouchable leader on the field, Travis Kelce is now under scrutiny for possibly letting distractions interfere with his play. Since the couple continues to be in the spotlight, both Swift and Kelce find themselves at the center of discussions regarding whether their romanceTaylor Swift and Travis Kelce, formerly the epitome of power couples connecting music and sport, now face a reversal of public perception that could be hard to discount. Rumors of a possible wedding later in the year only served to heighten debate, with some industry sources warning that cross-pollinating their brands to such an extent might prove to have unforeseen effects. With the couple's relationship making up-page news every day, the test is to keep their romance alive while keeping their respective careers intact.“This whole situation is creating a weird tension between her and Travis, especially since this is their first real bump in the road,” a source told Radar Online. “Until now, it’s been nothing but good times! You can only imagine the awkward discussions happening behind the scenes about when it’s appropriate for them to be seen together and how they’re supposed to act. Definitely not the romantic vibe they were hoping for!”Also Read: Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce losing their popularity as Super Bowl loss shifts spotlight away Taylor Swift has been pulled into a surprise legal battle with her close friends Blake Lively, Ryan Reynolds, and former co-star of Lively's Justin Baldoni.

Fed up with the unwanted connection, she perceives it as a possible threat to her image. Consequently, part of the insiders is now calling on her to distance herself from Lively, just as she's being advised to do regarding her affair with Travis Kelce.",Taylor swift is said to be increasingly being urged to keep her personal and professional brands separate.
