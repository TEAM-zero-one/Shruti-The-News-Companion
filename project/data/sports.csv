Team India are set to pocket a record-breaking sum from the International Cricket Council (ICC) following their historic victory in the Women’s World Cup 2025 final against South Africa at the DY Patil Stadium on Sunday.With the win, India not only lifted their maiden Women’s World Cup title but also secured the highest-ever prize money in the history of cricket - a whopping USD 4.48 million (Rs 39.78 crore).The amount is part of a total tournament pool of USD 13.88 million (about Rs 123 crore), which was announced by the ICC ahead of the event. This was a whopping 297 per cent increase from the USD 3.5 million purse at the 2022 edition in New Zealand.The winners’ prize of USD 4.48 million represents a 239 per cent jump from the USD 1.32 million that Australia received for winning the last edition, while runners-up South Africa will earn USD 2.24 million (Rs 19.88 crore).Each losing semi-finalist is entitled to USD 1.12 million (Rs 9.94 crore), while all eight teams were guaranteed USD 250,000 for participation, plus an additional USD 34,314 for every group-stage win.According to a PTI report, the BCCI is also considering matching the prize and bonuses that the men’s team received after their T20 World Cup 2024 win.A senior BCCI source told PTI, “The BCCI supports equal pay for men and women and hence there are lot of discussions that if our girls win the World Cup, the reward won't be anything less compared to the men's global triumph. But it isn't nice to make an announcement before they win the Cup.”The Rohit Sharma-led men’s team was awarded ₹125 crore for their T20 World Cup victory last year, a figure that could now serve as a benchmark for the women’s side following their landmark success.As the celebrations continue in Navi Mumbai, India’s triumph, and the record prize it brings marks a defining moment for women’s cricket and reflects the ICC’s stated goal of “a world-class Women’s Cricket World Cup” and “a clear commitment to long-term growth.”The final saw Team India women defeat Laura Wolvaardt's South Africa by 52 runs in Navi Mumbai.",India women secured a historic win at dy patil stadium in navi mumbai to secure a record sum in prize money from the icc.

SRINAGAR: Former India all-rounder Parvez Rasool condemned Tuesday social media memes mocking West Indies star Chris Gayle after the abrupt collapse of Indian Heaven Premier League (IHPL) in J&K, calling the portrayal “irresponsible and harmful for Kashmir’s cricket”.Rasool said Gayle did not flee but left after completing his three-match commitment. “When he left the hotel, everyone greeted him warmly. People must show respect to such a great cricketer,” he said, adding that Gayle’s presence encouraged local players and promoted tourism. Gayle was seen last week enjoying a Shikara ride on Dal Lake, smiling and waving to fans.“An international cricketer of great repute, Chris Gayle, was here. He praised one of our boys and said he played well. It was a rare moment for us,” Rasool said. “He interacted with local players, visited Dal Lake to promote tourism, and now people are making memes saying he ran away. That’s unfair and not good for us or for cricket.”The T20 tournament organised by non-profit Yuva Society collapsed Saturday night after organisers allegedly fled a Srinagar hotel without paying players, staff, or umpires.Turning to the controversy, Rasool said the league was “poorly managed” but not a scam. “I was the biggest sufferer and they didn’t pay me anything,” he said. “The idea was to give local players a chance to share the field with international cricketers. Unfortunately, lack of sponsors and poor crowd turnout ruined it.”",Former india all-rounder parvez rasool condemned tuesday social media memes mocking west indies star chris gayle.

Charlise Springer’s words remind fans what baseball truly stands for

A season that tested every ounce of heart, faith, and resilience

Looking ahead as the Blue Jays promise to ‘run it back’

When the Toronto Blue Jays’ dream run came to a heartbreaking end in Game 7 of the World Series, it wasn’t just the players who felt the pain—it was their families, the fans, and an entire nation that had believed in their story. After leading the series 3–2 and returning home to Rogers Centre with hopes of ending a 32-year title drought, the Blue Jays watched their fairytale slip away. Costly missed chances in Game 6 and a gut-wrenching ninth-inning home run by Miguel Rojas sealed their fate, leaving the stadium heavy with silence and disbelief.A day later, while the city was still nursing its heartbreak, George Springer’s wife, Charlise Springer, stepped forward with a message that struck deep emotional chords. Her heartfelt words, filled with gratitude, pride, and grace, reminded everyone that baseball is more than just wins and losses—it’s about resilience, connection, and moments that outlast the scoreboard. “I’m so proud of my husband, this team and every single family that poured their hearts into this season,” she wrote. “The highs, the late nights, the travel, the memories. Baseball doesn’t promise fairytale endings, but it gives you people and moments that last a lifetime.Feeling nothing but gratitude for the chance to represent Canada’s team and be part of something so special🇨🇦 💙 Until next season🐎#RunItBack.”Charlise’s post quickly spread across social media, not for its glamour, but for its sincerity. Thousands of fans flooded the comments, calling her words “beautiful,” “real,” and “exactly what the city needed to hear.” In a moment of collective heartbreak, her message brought perspective—it wasn’t about the loss, but about the love, loyalty, and shared memories that baseball creates. Her reflection reminded everyone that behind every player’s jersey is a family that lives every win and loss just as deeply.For the Blue Jays, this wasn’t just another playoff push—it was a season that redefined their identity. From battling injuries and midseason slumps to clawing their way into the postseason spotlight, Toronto defied every odd stacked against them. Charlise’s words, “This group showed nothing but heart, humility and resilience from day one and it was an honor to watch them chase this dream together ,” perfectly echoed what fans had witnessed all season long—a team that played for each other and carried the weight of a nation on their shoulders.George Springer, one of the veterans who has become the emotional heartbeat of the clubhouse, embodied that spirit of fight. Through every late-night comeback and pressure-packed inning, he stood as a symbol of belief and leadership. And while the final chapter didn’t end in celebration, it unfolded with the kind of grit that defines lasting legacies.Though the pain of this loss may linger through the winter, the message of hope remains loud and clear. With their core still intact and a fanbase unwavering in belief, the Blue Jays are already turning the page with one mantra: Run it back. As Charlise Springer so beautifully expressed, baseball may not always deliver fairytales—but it always delivers moments that stay forever. And for Toronto, that story is far from over. Because every heartbreak in this city, only fuels a stronger comeback. And when the lights shine again next season, the Blue Jays will be ready to write the ending they've long waited for.Also read: Shohei Ohtani’s rare Game 7 moment sparks fiery exchange as Toronto Blue Jays’ manager John Schneider confronts umpire in World Series showdown","Charlise springer’s words remind fans what baseball truly stands for.

As Patrick Mahomes returns to Buffalo, the stakes are different — but emotions are always present





For most NFL spouses, game week tends to mean travel, schedules, childcare adjustments, and a flood of national attention, but for Brittany Mahomes, there’s history attached to Buffalo. And not the fun, competitive kind. Before this weekend’s Chiefs-Bills showdown, an old incident involving a Bills supporter is circulating again online, reminding fans that not every rivalry moment lives only inside the stadium walls.Brittany, who has been in the public eye alongside Patrick Mahomes since college, once publicly reacted to a fan display that crossed a major line. Now, with yet another high-stakes meeting on the schedule, the memory of that moment is once again part of the conversation.Ahead of a previous Chiefs vs Bills matchup, Brittany Mahomes addressed what she considered to be one of the ugliest fan moments she had ever seen involving her family. A Kermit the Frog puppet, wearing a Patrick Mahomes No. 15 jersey, was hung publicly in Buffalo.Brittany's reaction was immediate, emotional, and blunt. “Do we remember this, Buffalo? Absolutely disgusting,” she posted. She also followed that with a pointed reminder about basic decency in sports culture, writing, “So as you go home tonight, I pray we become better people.”Those words weren’t just about trash talk. They were about human respect and they still land heavily today.Sunday's meeting wasn't just another regular season date. Patrick Mahomes and Josh Allen have developed the kind of on-field rivalry that dictates national windows, defines postseason eras, and fuels nonstop football debate. Kansas City enters with momentum. Buffalo enters with swagger. Both enter with pressure.And on the periphery of all that football energy sits a memory from November 2024, a moment Brittany Mahomes hasn’t forgotten, and clearly never wanted normalized. It proves one thing: rivalries can be electric. But respect still matters, especially when the entire world is watching.Also Read: “A sad, pathetic, nobody loser”: Swifties unleash fury on Kayla Nicole after Halloween stunt reignites drama with Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift","Brittany mahomes publicly condemned a disrespectful kermit the frog puppet mocking patrick mahomes.

The Bigger Picture: Sending a Message to Tarik Skubal

As the 2025 MLB season officially comes to an end, the focus quickly shifts toward the offseason - a period that promises major shakeups across the league. With a long list of stars expected to test free agency, front offices are already weighing their options between blockbuster signings and strategic trades. For the, one of the biggest storylines centers on their uncertain infield situation and the possible departure of Gleyber Torres.This offseason features a loaded market with names like Kyle Schwarber, Cody Bellinger, Alex Bregman, and Pete Alonso potentially switching uniforms. While many clubs are expected to make aggressive pushes in free agency, others will look to bolster their rosters through the trade market. The Tigers may fall into the latter group, especially if they decide to replace Torres with an established All-Star talent.This winter’s free-agent market is stacked with talent. Stars like Kyle Schwarber, Cody Bellinger, Alex Bregman, and Pete Alonso headline a group of players who could redefine the league landscape. However, while many franchises will dive into free agency, others - like the Detroit Tigers - may prefer the trade route to strengthen key areas.Expect some clubs to move aggressively early in the market, while others play the waiting game to gauge player values. Either way, there’s a sense that this offseason will spark considerable movement, with several marquee names possibly finding new homes.The Detroit Tigers face a crucial decision regarding Gleyber Torres, who is now an unrestricted free agent. Losing him would be a significant blow to the team’s lineup. Torres played in 145 regular-season games in 2025, producing a .256/.358/.387 slash line with 16 home runs and 74 RBIs. His consistency and presence were vital to Detroit’s overall success, making him a priority - though re-signing him may prove difficult given market competition.According to Bleacher Report’s Joel Reuter, the Tigers could make a blockbuster move by trading with the Toronto Blue Jays for two-time All-Star Bo Bichette. Reuter wrote, “Bo Bichette does not turn 28 years old until March 5, and after a down year in 2024, he returned to elite form offensively this season with a .311/.357/.483 line that included 44 doubles, 18 home runs and 94 RBI in 139 games.”Here’s a quick look at how Bichette compares to Torres in 2025:Bichette’s offensive resurgence makes him an ideal candidate for Detroit’s infield. Although his defensive metrics at shortstop suggest limitations, a shift to second base could maximize his strengths while filling Torres’ vacancy.A move for Bichette would carry broader implications beyond filling a positional gap. It would also signal Detroit’s commitment to building a legitimate championship contender. As Reuter noted, “It would also represent a significant move to show Tarik Skubal the front office is serious about building a title contender, as the Detroit Tigers try to hammer out a long-term extension with their ace before he hits the open market after the 2026 season. ”By bringing in an All-Star-caliber talent like Bichette, the Tigers could demonstrate to Skubal - and the rest of the roster - that the organization is intent on competing for a World Series.Also read: MLB trade rumors: Philadelphia Phillies potentially eyeing $190 million star amid Alec Bohm uncertainty The Detroit Tigers’ front office faces a defining offseason.

Zion Williamson’s latest hamstring injury halts strong start



The New Orleans Pelicans’ winless start to the 2025 NBA season just took another painful turn. Star forward Zion Williamson has suffered a Grade 1 left hamstring strain, the team announced Tuesday, sidelining him for at least seven to ten days. The 25-year-old will be re-evaluated after that period, but no official return date has been set.The timing couldn’t be worse for New Orleans, which sits at 0-6 after a rough opening stretch. Williamson had been one of the few bright spots, leading the team in scoring, rebounding, and assists. His latest setback adds another chapter to a career that’s been defined as much by injuries as by his explosive talent.Before his injury, Zion Williamson was averaging 22.8 points, 6.8 rebounds, and 4.6 assists per game, proving once again why he’s the centerpiece of the Pelicans’ offense. In Sunday’s loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder, he led the team with 20 points, nine rebounds, and six assists, displaying the versatility that made him the No. 1 overall pick in the 2019 NBA Draft.But just days later, the Pelicans confirmed the news fans dreaded. “Zion Williamson has been diagnosed with a grade 1 left hamstring strain. He will be re-evaluated in 7-10 days and further updates will be appropriately provided.,”the team’s statement read. The announcement sparked concern, given Williamson’s long history of lower-body injuries, particularly hamstring issues that have sidelined him repeatedly in recent seasons.Since entering the league, Williamson has played in just 219 of a possible 478 regular-season games, missing more time than he’s been available. He appeared in only 30 contests last season before a back injury ended his campaign early. Despite these interruptions, his efficiency remains elite, averaging 24.6 points on 58.6% shooting for his career.The setback is particularly disheartening considering Williamson’s efforts to start the season healthy. He told reporters during training camp, “It feels good to feel good. I haven’t felt like this since college or high school.” His improved conditioning and dominant preseason performances had reignited hope that he might finally play a full season.Now, that hope is once again on pause. The Pelicans, desperate to turn their season around, must regroup without their franchise cornerstone.Also Read: Kawhi Leonard’s name dragged once again as 11 Aspiration investors filed lawsuit against LA Clippers owner Steve Ballmer","Zion williamson has been ruled out for at least seven to ten days with a hamstring strain.

LaMelo Ball’s Season Performance So Far

What It Means for Charlotte Hornets Fans

Themay have to make a crucial decision tonight asahead of their matchup against the New Orleans Pelicans. The 23-year-old guard has been dealing with a right ankle impingement that kept him out of Sunday’s game against the Utah Jazz. His recovery progress is being closely watched, and his presence - or absence - could play a major role in shaping the Hornets’ chances on the road.Ball’s injury has drawn significant attention given his importance to Charlotte’s offense. As one of the league’s premier playmakers, his ability to control tempo, create scoring opportunities, and rebound effectively makes him indispensable to the team’s success. The Hornets’ medical staff has listed him as questionable on the latest injury report released on November 4, 2025, indicating that his final game-time status will likely depend on how his ankle responds during pre-game warmups.The Charlotte Hornets confirmed that LaMelo Ball missed Sunday’s contest versus the Jazz due to his ongoing ankle issue, and while his condition has improved slightly, there’s still caution surrounding his return.He is listed as ""questionable"" for tonight's game vs the New Orleans Pelicans. The team’s official report categorized his status as questionable, suggesting that they’re weighing the risk of aggravating the injury against the need for his leadership on the court. Charlotte’s coaching staff has emphasized that Ball will undergo further evaluation before tip-off in New Orleans.The right ankle impingement has limited Ball’s ability to pivot and drive effectively - both critical parts of his dynamic playstyle. Although the Charlotte Hornets have managed without him in short stretches, his absence has been felt, especially in transition plays and late-game execution. Given how early it is in the season, the team is expected to prioritize long-term health over short-term gains, but a surprise return tonight remains a possibility if Ball clears medical checks.Before this setback, Ball had been delivering another impressive season, averaging 23.3 points, 9.8 assists, and 7.8 rebounds per game across six appearances. Those numbers highlight his all-around impact, not only as a scorer but also as a facilitator and rebounder. His chemistry with young teammates like Brandon Miller and Mark Williams has been a bright spot for the Charlotte Hornets’ developing offense.If he takes the court tonight, Ball could immediately tilt the momentum in Charlotte’s favor. His court vision and rebounding ability have been key to keeping the Hornets competitive, and his playmaking presence helps stretch defenses, giving shooters more open looks.Also read: Is Joel Embiid playing tonight vs the Chicago Bulls?

From gold medals to rival clubs, Jordyn Huitema’s heartfelt reaction shows the bond that still shines through

Chicago doubles down on its future by locking in Grosso’s leadership until 2028

It’s a big win for Chicago — and an even bigger one for Canadian soccer star Julia Grosso. On Tuesday, the midfielder, who is also the girlfriend of Houston Astros shortstop Jeremy Peña, signed a long-term extension with Chicago Stars FC that will keep her with the club through the 2028 NWSL season. The team confirmed the news on Instagram, posting, “✶ From Canada, for Chicago ✶ Julia Grosso re-signs with Chicago Stars FC through 2028! "" Within hours, the announcement sparked a wave of reactions from across the sports world, including a warm and emotional response from Grosso’s Olympic teammate Jordyn Huitema — who happens to be dating Seattle Mariners outfielder Julio Rodríguez.Huitema quickly reshared the club’s post on her Instagram story, adding a heartfelt caption that fans couldn’t stop talking about. “She’s there to stay,” she wrote, followed by another line that said, “You’ve got a good one, Chicago,” tagging Grosso. The moment went viral within minutes, with fans praising the genuine friendship and sportsmanship between the two athletes, both of whom have balanced elite football careers with life alongside MLB superstars.Huitema’s reaction wasn’t just about club loyalty — it came from a place of shared triumph and years of mutual respect.The two have been inseparable teammates for years, first linking up as part of the Canadian women’s national team that captured the country’s first-ever gold medal at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. It was Grosso who etched her name into Canadian sports history that day, calmly converting the decisive penalty in the final against Sweden after a tense 1-1 draw through extra time.Huitema, a rising star then, played a crucial role in that same campaign, and their shared Olympic journey cemented a friendship that has lasted well beyond national duties. Today, even as they represent rival NWSL clubs — Huitema with Seattle Reign and Grosso with Chicago Stars — their support for one another remains strong and sincere, as reflected in Huitema’s viral post.For Chicago Stars FC, re-signing Grosso represents more than a simple extension — it’s a statement of intent. Since joining the club (then called the Chicago Red Stars) in 2024 after a successful stint with Juventus, Grosso has become the heartbeat of their midfield. Her composure under pressure, technical precision, and leadership have made her one of the most dependable players in the NWSL.Extending her contract through 2028 signals Chicago’s confidence in her as a foundational piece of their rebuild and future success. It also solidifies Grosso’s role as one of the league’s top international stars, bringing both experience and visibility to the franchise.Huitema’s message — “She’s there to stay” — summed up the sentiment perfectly. And as fans continue to celebrate the moment, it’s clear that this was more than a signing; it was a celebration of friendship, legacy, and belief that greatness lasts when built together.Also read: ""No fairytale ending"": George Springer’s wife Charlise breaks silence after Toronto Blue Jays’ devastating World Series loss","Julia grosso signed a long-term contract extension with chicago stars fc on tuesday.

Blake Treinen’s tribute hat photo sparks Charlie Kirk confusion after Dodgers’ World Series win

Social media users wrongly claim Blake Treinen wore the Charlie Kirk hat in the World Series

A new rumor about Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Blake Treinen spread online after the team’s World Series win on Saturday, November 1, 2025. The claim said Treinen wore a hat with “Charlie Kirk” written on it during the World Series celebration. But this claim is false. The viral picture that started it all was not from the World Series.It was from a September 12 game against the San Francisco Giants, weeks before the championship series. The image began circulating after a Facebook post by user Scott Mandel falsely said Treinen wore the hat “during the World Series.” Several pages, including The Dodgers TOP, then reposted the same image, spreading the wrong information further.The photo is real, but it’s old. During the September 12, 2025 game in San Francisco, Blake Treinen wore a special white hat with “Charlie Kirk” written on it and two small Christian crosses. This was to honor Charlie Kirk, the founder of Turning Point USA (TPUSA), who was shot and killed on September 10 during an event at Utah Valley University.According to Fox News, Blake Treinen, who is known for his strong Christian faith, wore the tribute hat as a personal gesture. Musician Sean Feucht shared photos and a short video from that game on Instagram, writing:“My friend and pitcher for the Dodgers, Blake Treinen, played with this on his hat last night.”Feucht later posted another video from October 8, showing Treinen giving the hat away after a game against the Philadelphia Phillies, and thanked him for “remembering Charlie Kirk tonight.”After the Dodgers’ World Series win, the same September photo began to recirculate on Facebook and X. Some users wrongly claimed the hat appeared during the World Series celebration.Also Read: Barack Obama Sends Heartfelt Reaction To Los Angeles Dodgers’ World Series Triumph After Nerve-Racking Game 7 Over Toronto Blue Jays Fact-checking sites including Primetimer and Fox News confirmed that the image was not taken during the World Series.

How Stephen Curry became the final trigger that led to Steve Nash retire

Stephen Curry joined LeBron James and Steve Nash for the latest episode of their Mind the Game podcast, and it was an absolute hoot. From exchanging hilarious stories to showcasing the respect and admiration they have for each other, the episode gave fans a lot to cover. But one of the best bits came when Steve Nash revealed the reason behind his retirement from the game of basketball.Nash started his playing career with the Phoenix Suns back in 1996 - a team he played for the majority of his career. Then after 15 years, he left the playing cleats behind in 2015 after his last tenure - 4 years with the Los Angeles Lakers. Many believed it was due to his health issues, but as recently revealed by Nash himself - while they definitely did play a part, one major reason for his retirement was none other than Stephen Curry.Stephen Curry was 21 years old when he joined the NBA as a player for the Golden State Warriors back in 2009. But it wasn't until 2013-2014 that he finally came into his being, showcasing his talent on the court as one of the top players to ever grace the league. And it was in 2015, when Steve Nash retired after playing in the league for 15 years. He was already having some back and knee problems before his last season started, and during the Mind the Game episode, he reminisced about a preseason game when he and his LA Lakers team faced the Warriors with Curry running the game.""I'm guarding Steph... he's running everywhere, I'm like back is broke... I think it's time. If you can't beat 'em...""Nash spoke of how Curry's game style and the way he had the point guard running all over the court, and feeling like he was going to break his back, made him finally think that maybe it was time to consider the possibility of retirement. Bron could be heard cackling while Nash was making the admission, saying, ""I don't like to talk about this in public,"" to which the Lakers star said, ""We got a Mind the Game exclusive,"" in response.LeBron James had once said, during one such episode of Mind the Game, that Steph Curry was a player whose influence on the game has been one of the biggest on the game. He named Curry and Allen Iverson as two players who had the biggest impact on the game ever, since he started watching the game, which is high praise for the Warriors star. But who knew he was also the reason behind his friend and teammate retiring from the game as a player.Also Read: “I'm pulled in a lot of areas"": Stephen Curry’s heartfelt confession about striving to be a ""better husband"" resurfaces as Ayesha Curry faces heat","Stephen curry joined lebron james and steve nash for the latest episode of their mind the game podcast.

Australia has named uncapped opener Jake Weatherald in their 15-man squad for the first Ashes Test against England, along with Brendan Doggett and Sean Abbott as backup fast bowlers. The squad announcement came on Wednesday in Sydney, with Steve Smith set to captain in place of injured Pat Cummins for the series opener in Perth on November 21.The 31-year-old Weatherald could become Usman Khawaja's sixth opening partner since David Warner's retirement last year, following unsuccessful trials with Steve Smith, Nathan McSweeney, Sam Konstas, Travis Head, and Marnus Labuschagne.Chief selector George Bailey has not confirmed Weatherald's place in the starting eleven. ""No, not confirmed in the XI. Obviously we've got 14 of our 15-man squad playing round four (of the Sheffield Shield). Still some information to gather out of that. Cameron Green, being one, returning to the bowling crease, that'd be good,"" Bailey said.Cameron Green's bowling fitness remains a key consideration, having only bowled minimal overs since returning from back surgery 13 months ago.If Green can bowl sufficient overs, he will likely bat at number six, with Weatherald opening and Labuschagne at number three.The team might alternatively position Labuschagne to open with Khawaja, moving Green to number three and Beau Webster to sixth position if Green's bowling remains limited.""We are looking forward to the squad connecting and preparing in Perth leading on from a busy domestic and white ball schedule to kick off the Test summer,"" Bailey added.Regular captain Pat Cummins, who has been sidelined with a lower back injury since facing the West Indies, will travel with the squad to Perth and aims to return for the day-night second Test in Brisbane from December 4.Scott Boland will lead the pace attack alongside Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood in Cummins' absence.Spinner Nathan Lyon enters his 140th Test needing just two wickets to surpass Glenn McGrath and become the sixth-highest wicket-taker in Test history.The five-Test series will proceed from Perth to Brisbane, Adelaide, Melbourne, and Sydney.England, who managed a 2-2 draw in the 2023 home Ashes series, haven't won in Australia since 2010-2011.The Australian squad consists of Steve Smith (captain), Sean Abbott, Scott Boland, Alex Carey, Brendan Doggett, Cameron Green, Josh Hazlewood, Travis Head, Josh Inglis, Usman Khawaja, Marnus Labuschagne, Nathan Lyon, Mitchell Starc, Jake Weatherald, and Beau Webster.",Jake weatherald named in australia's 15-man squad for first ashes test.

India women's cricket team leave hotel, likely to meet PM Narendra Modi next

The Indian women’s cricket team finally had their fairytale moment when they beat South Africa by 52 runs in the final to lift the Women’s World Cup for the first time. After falling short twice in 2005 and 2017, Harmanpreet Kaur and her team rewrote history, ending years of heartbreak and bringing home the biggest prize in the game.The win sparked memories of India’s famous 1983 men’s World Cup victory under Kapil Dev, when a young team stunned the mighty West Indies. Many drew parallels between the two triumphs, but legendary opener Sunil Gavaskar believes the achievements, though both iconic, should not be seen on the same scale.Writing in his column for The Sportstar, Gavaskar said, “The win once again emphasised, if ever it was needed, that sporting intelligence wins trophies, not fancy degrees from universities. It also proves that it will invariably be Indian coaches who get the best results since they know the players – their strengths, weaknesses, and temperament – and understand the nuances of Indian cricket better than any foreigner, however accomplished he or she may be. ”Gavaskar went on to explain why he does not see the 2025 victory as identical to the men’s triumph in 1983. “There were some who tried to compare this win with the men’s team winning the World Cup in 1983.The men had never progressed beyond the group stage in earlier editions, and so everything from the knockout stage onward was new to them, while the women already had a better record, having been in two finals before this magnificent triumph. ”His point carried weight. While the 1983 team was a complete underdog, the Indian women had already shown their potential in global tournaments, reaching the ODI finals in 2005 and 2017 and the T20 World Cup final in 2020. Yet, Gavaskar acknowledged that Harmanpreet’s team had achieved something monumental.“Just as the '83 win galvanised Indian cricket and gave it a voice that was heard around the world, this victory will make the countries that started women’s cricket long before India did realise that their era of domination has been shaken. The ’83 win also encouraged parents of aspiring cricketers to let their children take up the game,” he added.Gavaskar further highlighted how this victory could change the landscape for women’s cricket in India. “Similarly, this win will give new wings to women’s cricket, bringing more girls into the game from the remotest parts of India. The WPL has already begun that process, as parents now see the sport as a genuine career option for their daughters and are more willing to support them.”While the men’s 1983 win created a cricketing revolution, Gavaskar believes Harmanpreet Kaur’s World Cup-winning side has lit a similar spark for women’s cricket in India, one that could inspire the next generation of young girls to pick up the bat and ball.","India women's cricket team won the women's world cup for the first time.
