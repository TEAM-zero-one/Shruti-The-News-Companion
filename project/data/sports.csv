Sanju Samson or Ishan Kishan? | Greenstone Lobo predicts the ideal player for T20 World Cup

Pakistan have suffered a major setback ahead of their mouth-watering Under-19 clash against India at the Queens Sports Club in Bulawayo, a match that will decide the fourth semi-finalist of the ICC Under-19 World Cup in Zimbabwe. Afghanistan and England joined Australia as the latest entrants into the semi-finals on Friday following impressive performances in their Super Six clashes, with an unbeaten England becoming the first team from Group 2 to reach the final four. Sunday’s marquee India-Pakistan encounter now shapes up as a virtual knockout.Pakistan’s preparations were dented after wicketkeeper-batter Mohammad Shayan was ruled out due to injury, the Pakistan Cricket Board confirmed.“Pakistan U19 wicketkeeper-batter Mohammad Shayan has been ruled out of the ICC U19 Men's Cricket World Cup after being struck on the nose by a ball while wicketkeeping to a fast bowler during a scenario-based practice match,” the PCB said in a statement. He was taken to hospital, where X-rays confirmed a fracture, with a replacement set to be named in due course.Australia had already progressed to the final four from Group 1, while Afghanistan grabbed the remaining spot following a commanding 191-run win over Ireland.England sealed qualification from Group 2 after defeating New Zealand by 65 runs, courtesy a five-wicket haul from Manny Lumsden. India currently enjoy an advantage heading into their clash with Pakistan, sitting on six points from three matches with a superior net run rate, while Pakistan have four points.In Harare, Afghanistan rode on a scintillating 163 from Faisal Khan to post 315/7 after electing to bat first. Faisal struck 18 fours and a six in his 142-ball knock, which stands as the highest individual score by an Afghan batter in tournament history. Afghanistan were in early trouble at 27/2 before a 75-run third-wicket partnership between Faisal and Uzairullah Niazai steadied the innings. The game swung decisively in Afghanistan’s favour during a 188-run fourth-wicket stand between Faisal and captain Mahboob Khan, who scored 89 off 79 balls with five fours and two sixes.Ireland’s Reuben Wilson and Olly Riley picked up three wickets apiece, but the Irish chase never took off. Ireland were bowled out for 124, with Marko Bates (34) and Wilson (31) adding 55 for the sixth wicket in a brief show of resistance. Abdul Aziz led Afghanistan’s bowling with 3/21, while leg-break bowler Aqil Khan wrapped up proceedings with three wickets for 36 runs.Earlier in Bulawayo, New Zealand, already out of semi-final contention, restricted England to 234/7 on a tricky surface. Ben Dawkins made a cautious 42, while Ben Mayes (53) and Caleb Faloner (47) chipped in with vital contributions. Mason Clarke was the pick of New Zealand’s bowlers with 2/38. However, Lumsden turned the game on its head with figures of 5/17 as New Zealand were bowled out for 169 in 38.5 overs, despite Senith Reddy’s 47 and a 58-run stand with Callum Samson.",Pakistan's wicketkeeper-batter mohammad shayan ruled out of under-19 world cup.

Cooper Flagg’s historic 49 points set league record but couldn’t save the tanking Mavericks against Hornets,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/cooper-flaggs-historic-49-points-set-league-record-but-couldnt-save-the-tanking-mavericks-against-hornets/articleshow/127801757.cms,"Cooper Flagg (Image via Getty)

Rookie Cooper Flagg drops historic 49-point game in a loss to Hornets

Mavs can’t convert Cooper Flagg’s excellence into victory

Dallas Mavericks rookie Cooper Flagg just made the NBA record for most points scored by a teenager in a single season. In a close-contested 121-123 loss to the Hornets on Thursday night, Cooper Flagg’s individual brilliance was on full display for the fans to witness when the rookie dropped 49 points.Despite the historic performance at the American Airlines Center, the Mavericks were unable to snap their three-game losing streak. Whereas the Hornets have been cruising recently. With this win against Mavs, they are now on a five game winning streak.After being selected as the #1 overpick in the 2025 NBA draft, Cooper Flagg has barely given the Mavs’ front office any reason to feel disappointed. The 19-year-old rising star surpassed Cliff Robinson’s long-standing record of 45 points scored as a teenager in 1980.Finally, the day came after four long decades when Cooper Flagg broke the record with his career high 49 points against Hornets. He finished the night with 10 rebounds, 3 assists, while shooting 20-of-29 from the field, 3-5 from three-point line, and went 6-6 from FT.Along with setting the league record, Flagg also broke the Mavericks' franchise rookie scoring record of 42 points, previously held by Aguirre. His efficiency on the court this season has been staggering.As a rookie, he’s leading the franchise not only in total points (856) and points per game(19.5 PPG), but also in Steals per game (1.3).But Flagg wasn’t the only rookie who mesmerized everyone on Thursday night. His former Duke University roommate, Kon Knueppel of the Charlotte Hornets, also led his team with a career-high 34 points, setting a franchise rookie record by hitting eight three-pointers.Flagg’s scoring outburst in the second quarter fueled his high-scoring night. He went 8-of-9 from the field and poured in 23 points. However, the Hornets’ attack with Brandon Miller contributing 23 points, and LaMelo Ball’s 22 points with six triples, was too much for Mavs defense. Despite Klay Thompson’s 16 points, Dallas failed to secure a win.Cooper Flagg might be leading the race for 2026 Rookie of the Year, but if Dallas can’t convert their rookie’s sensational talent into a win, then the championship dream would be nothing more than a distant fantasy. They currently sit at 12th place in a conference that is filled with heavyweights like the reigning NBA champions Thunder (38-11) and the surging Spurs (32-15). In comparison to them, Mavericks’ 19-29 record doesn’t look promising.","Dallas mavericks rookie cooper flagg just made the nba record for most points scored by a teenager in a single season.

Stefon Diggs highlights Terrell Williams return inspires Patriots ahead of Super Bowl

The New England Patriots are heading back to the Super Bowl, and this season has been about more than wins and stats. Behind the victories, the locker room has rallied around a story of resilience. Terrell Williams, the team’s defensive coordinator, battled prostate cancer earlier this season. His return to the sidelines for Super Bowl LX has inspired every player on the roster.The Patriots’ season was remarkable. After back-to-back 4-13 seasons, QB Drake Maye threw for 4,394 yards and 31 touchdowns, and the team went 9-0 on the road, a first in NFL history. But it was New England’s defense, shaped by Williams’ schemes, that carried them in the playoffs, including a 10-7 AFC Championship win over the Denver Broncos.Patriots WR Stefon Diggs spoke at Gillette Stadium about the impact of Williams’ comeback. He said, “This team has been through a lot. A lot of guys have had family issues, things happen, and health issues. Another road warrior. We have got a lot of love and respect for Coach T and his strength. "" WR further added, ""Even when we see him around the building, everybody is smiling. Everybody is hollering at him.""Terrell Williams, 51, was diagnosed with prostate cancer in September 2025.During his treatment, linebackers coach Zak Kuhr took over play-calling duties, but Williams remained involved in game planning and team meetings. His return for the Super Bowl adds both stability and inspiration to a defence that allowed just 26 points over three playoff games.Patriots head coach Mike Vrabel shared that defensive coordinator Terrell Williams will travel with the team to Santa Clara for the Super Bowl. He’s doing good,” HC said. “He’s excited about travelling with us. I appreciate you asking. Doing well, so we’re excited about having him.”As Williams undergoes treatment, he often stays with the team. And now that the legend is in good health and is about to make a trip out west, the players couldn't be more happier.The Patriots face the Seattle Seahawks in Super Bowl LX on February 7, 2026, in San Francisco. While the matchup promises fireworks, Williams’ return is the emotional core of the team. For New England, his presence is a reminder that resilience, unity, and determination define a season just as much as touchdowns and sacks.","Stefon diggs shares what terrell williams’ super bowl return means to patriots amid cancer battle.

Why Kyle Tucker Would Have Fit Toronto Blue Jays’ Long-Term Plan

Toronto Blue Jays (Image Source - Getty Images)

What Each Side Would Have Gained

The Risks That Would Have Come With It

If Kyle Tucker had reached the open market instead of signing with the Los Angeles Dodgers in January 2026, the Toronto Blue Jays would likely have emerged as one of the most aggressive teams in pursuit.Tucker is one of the rare players who checks every box. He brings power without selling out his approach, plays strong defense in the outfield, and is still firmly in his prime. Players like that almost never become available, which is why his hypothetical free agency would have reshaped conversations across the league. Toronto, facing growing pressure after several playoff appearances that failed to produce a deep run, would have been well positioned to act.The Blue Jays have hovered on the edge of true contention for years. They’ve had talent, depth, and pitching, but the lineup has often lacked a single, game-altering presence who changes how opponents plan an entire series. Tucker fits that role cleanly. He’s not just another bat in the order; he’s the type of hitter who forces pitchers to work differently and reshapes how defenses align.Timing would have mattered as much as talent. With the Houston Astros managing payroll constraints and Tucker nearing the most expensive years of his career, the idea of him becoming available had already loosened the market.For Toronto, this wouldn’t be about extra depth or small upgrades. It would be a clear push to lift the team’s level and turn a good contender into a real championship threat.Any discussion around Kyle Tucker begins with contract reality. Industry expectations suggest his next deal could comfortably exceed $400 million, a figure that would place him among baseball’s highest-paid players. For Houston, moving him before that point would have meant gaining young, controllable talent while avoiding a massive long-term obligation.Toronto, meanwhile, would have seen a rare opening. The organization has both the prospect depth and the competitive urgency to justify a major swing. While any deal would have required real sacrifice, either top prospects or players ready for everyday roles, the payoff would have been immediate. This would have been the type of move that defines an era rather than supplements it.From Toronto Blue Jays’ point of view, adding Kyle Tucker would have solved multiple problems at once. He offers consistent middle-of-the-order production, with a track record of strong averages, power, and run creation. That kind of reliability has been uneven in recent Blue Jays lineups, especially when games tighten late in the season.There’s also the matter of presence. Tucker carries star weight. His arrival would have sent a clear message to both the clubhouse and the fanbase that the front office was willing to push beyond comfort to chase a championship.For Tucker, Toronto would have represented a chance to step into a major market with a competitive roster already in place. The environment would have supported both performance and profile, while positioning him for the type of long-term contract his production suggests is coming.The cost would not have been light. Toronto would have needed to part with valuable future assets, potentially thinning out depth that matters over a long season. There’s also the reality of Tucker’s recent injury history, including time missed in 2024, which adds uncertainty to any long-term commitment.For Houston, moving on from a cornerstone player would have meant an immediate hit to star power and lineup balance. The success of such a move would hinge entirely on how quickly and effectively the return pieces developed.Tucker himself would have faced the pressure that comes with a new league, a demanding market, and heightened expectations. Toronto is not a quiet place to struggle, especially for a player brought in to change outcomes.If Tucker hadn’t already committed to the Dodgers, Toronto likely would have been among the first teams to step up with a major offer. The move lined up with their timeline, the shape of the roster, and their push to win now. There would have been real risk for everyone involved, but the potential reward would have been just as big.Also read: MLB trade rumors: New York Mets exploring blockbuster move for $116.5 million Arizona Diamondbacks star following Jeff McNeil exit Deals like this don’t just alter a single roster. They change how a team is viewed for years. For the Blue Jays, a player like Kyle Tucker could have been the difference between staying close and finally breaking through.","Kyle tucker is one of the rare players who checks every box.

Factors behind Brian Cashman’s trust

The goal is to find a way. First, we have to win the East. Then we have to win the pennant, neither of which happened last year. That’s our only focus.""

What would the Yankees need to make it this time?

The New York Yankees are one of the best teams in baseball so far. But so far, till now, they haven't won a World Series championship since 2009. And for a team like the Yankees, it's suspicious. On the other hand, the Los Angeles Dodgers won back-to-back World Series championships in 2024 and 2025. And adding to that, fans and news reporters are recurrently asking a question: Does Brian Cashman truly believe that the Yankees can beat the Dodgers and win the 2026 title?According to Cashman, they can beat the Dodgers, but only under certain conditions. Cashman thinks that if the team works hard and improves in its core areas, it can certainly fight. He defended the team's decision to maintain the offseason. While fans think that the Yankees didn't do anything to improve the team after last year's playoff defeat. He has a trust in the Yankees that, after certain improvements this offseason, will definitely make them better in every aspect.Taking all the terms and conditions in accordance with Cashman's belief, it's quite obvious that he focuses on the process and the journey rather than a guaranteed victory.He is showing trust wholly, keeping his expectations in real terms. It needs a lot more than only belief to win a World Series.This is what Cashman said: ""Besides good pitch, defence, and practice, luck is needed to win the game. And while facing strong build teams like the Dodgers, who have been champions recently, it's really hard.To get the trophy for 2026, the Yankees have to keep in mind so many things. Starting with the health of their players, the whole season, practice sessions, and everything else should be on their must-have list. Some injuries are evident as one reason for the team's recent defeats.Secondly, the pitching staff the Yankees have should be consistent throughout the season. And especially during the playoffs. New players should be able to handle pressure in matches. Brian Cashman firmly believes that the Yankees can truly be that champion if they stay consistent and work hard this time.","The new york yankees haven't won a world series championship since 2009.

Steelers coaching staff update: Former Saints star Jahri Evans joins Mike McCarthy team,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/steelers-coaching-staff-update-former-saints-star-jahri-evans-joining-mike-mccarthy/articleshow/127807861.cms,"Image via IMAGN

A reunion years in the making

Why Jahri Evans’ track record matters in Pittsburgh

The Pittsburgh Steelers’ new era under head coach Mike McCarthy continues to take shape. In the latest development, former New Orleans Saints star and Hall of Fame finalist Jahri Evans is expected to join McCarthy’s coaching staff.According to multiple reports, Evans will take up a role as an assistant offensive line coach in Pittsburgh. The move reunites him with McCarthy, who was Evans’ head coach during the final season of his playing career with the Green Bay Packers in 2017.Evans is widely regarded as one of the greatest offensive linemen in Saints history. Drafted in the fourth round in 2006, he became a cornerstone of New Orleans’ dominant offense for more than a decade. During his time with the Saints, Evans earned six Pro Bowl selections and four first-team All-Pro honors. He was also part of the team that won Super Bowl XLIV.After retiring from playing, Evans returned to New Orleans in 2022 to begin his coaching career. He started as a coaching intern and gradually worked his way up, serving as the assistant offensive line coach over the past season. His steady growth within the Saints organization made him a respected young coach.Since being hired to replace longtime head coach Mike Tomlin, McCarthy has been working quickly to assemble his staff. Bringing in Evans shows a clear pattern McCarthy is leaning on coaches and former players he knows and trusts.Evans’ familiarity with McCarthy’s system and coaching style likely played a big role in this hire. The two worked together during Evans’ final NFL season in Green Bay, and that connection appears to have remained strong.The Steelers are also in the process of changing their offensive staff after some recent changes. With new leaders in place, making the offensive line stronger will be a top objective, especially because the team wants to stabilize its attack before the 2026 season.Evans is also a finalist for the Pro Football Hall of Fame Class of 2026, with the official announcement expected soon. His decorated playing career adds credibility to his coaching profile, particularly when working with offensive linemen.This move is good for Pittsburgh since it gives them both experience and stability. Evans knows what it takes to be the best because he played for one of the league's most dynamic attacks when he was at his best.McCarthy is still putting up his staff, and the signing of Evans shows that he wants to build a strong foundation in the trenches. The Steelers' new coaching staff is slowly coming together for the 2026 season, with more additions expected in the next few weeks.","Former new orleans saints star jahri evans is expected to join mike mccarthy's coaching staff in pittsburgh.

What are the trade options for the Blackhawks to consider this season?

Blackhawks vs. Penguins | NHL Highlights | January 29, 2026

The Chicago Blackhawks, who are quite far from the playoff hopes in the Western Conference, are planning to be poised as buyers ahead of the March 6 deadline rather than fire-sale assets. With a 21-22-7 record through 50 games, they trail the San Jose Sharks by eight points for the final wild-card spot but boast ample cap space and draft picks to become a major buyer before the NHL deadline.As the Blackhawks are out of a playoff spot as February approaches, many have naturally wondered if they trade some of their players ahead of the deadline. Meanwhile, Connor Murphy, Ilya Mikheyev, Jason Dickinson, Matt Grzelcyk, and Nick Foligno are the Blackhawks' most notable pending UFAs with the potential to be moved. This would prompt them to trade the players, but they should also pivot to buyer mode ahead of the trade deadline.As the Chicago Blackhawks currently hold a 21-24-9 record and sit in sixth place in the NHL's Central Division, they are drawing attention around this year's 2026 NHL trade deadline as discussions heat up about whether they should rebuild their club or trade players.Despite looming speculation about moving pending free agents such as Connor Murphy, IIlya Mikheyev, Jason Dickinson, Matt Grzelcyk, and Nick Foligno, the hockey community thinks that the team should remain open to acquiring players under contract beyond this season to accelerate its long-term competitiveness.As reported by the Hockey News, the Vancouver Canucks could make sense as a trade partner for the Blackhawks, as they have two top-six wingers, Conor Garland and Jake DeBrusk, who are signed for multiple years beyond this season. The Canucks sit last in the NHL and announced plans to rebuild, which could make these players available to acquire.Meanwhile, the Blackhawks can keep an eye on players like Alexis Lafreniere, who could be a great fit on a Blackhawks club on the rise. Vincent Trocheck, on the other hand, would be a fantastic top-six veteran center for the Blackhawks to bring in.Also, as Calgary Flames center Nazem Kadri's name is considered for trade deals and is currently doing the rounds, he could be a strong veteran for Chicago to add to their group. Even Blake Coleman would be a nice addition for the Blackhawks to add, as he is a well-respected leader who has good offensive strengths and plays a heavy game.",Chicago blackhawks currently hold a 21-24-9 record and sit in sixth place in the nhl's central division.

LeBron James' Steady production this season

Matchup against a weak defense

Why LeBron James' presence is important for the Los Angeles Lakers

What to watch during the game at Capital One Arena (January 30, 2026)

’ road game on. He is not listed on the injury report, which means there are no restrictions on his minutes.This gives the Lakers some stability going into the game. They have been dealing with minor injuries in the backcourt, so having their main ball handler fully fit makes a clear difference. With him active, the team can run its normal offense from the start. There is no need for last-minute lineup changes or reduced playing time.The official report does not mention LeBron James at all. Players who are at risk of sitting or being limited are usually marked as questionable or probable. That is not the case here. Guard depth is still not at full strength while Austin Reaves works back from a calf strain. Because of that, the Lakers will continue to rely on LeBron to bring the ball up, set up teammates, and control the pace.Another key teammate, Luka Dončić, has been dealing with a leg and ankle issue and was listed as questionable earlier in the day. In contrast, there has been no similar concern around LeBron.Even at 41, LeBron is putting up strong numbers. He is averaging a little over 22 points per game, along with around six rebounds and six assists.He is still one of the team’s main scorers and also its primary passer. Late in close games, the ball usually goes through him so he can either take the shot or find an open teammate.His outside shooting has held up, and he remains reliable in the final minutes when the result is on the line.The Washington Wizards have struggled to stop opposing offenses this season. They give up a lot of points and often react slowly on the perimeter. That type of defense suits the Los Angeles Lakers when they run plays through LeBron. He can attack mismatches, get into the paint, and force help defenders to move before passing to an open shooter.If Washington cannot contain his drives, the Lakers should be able to create good shots throughout the game.The Los Angeles Lakers are fighting for position in the Western Conference and need to beat teams below .500. Games like this are ones they are expected to win. LeBron helps keep the game under control. He reduces rushed plays and limits empty possessions by slowing things down when needed.He is also the first option at the end of tight games. Without him, the offense would lean heavily on Dončić and a thinner rotation. With him on the floor, the team has more balance.First, who handles the ball in the final minutes if the score is close. The Lakers may choose between LeBron creating from the top or letting Dončić take the main scoring role. Second, his three-point attempts. He averages just under two made threes per game, but this matchup could give him more open looks. Lastly, his total minutes. With a busy road stretch and his age, the coaching staff may try to find short rest periods unless the game stays tight.Also read: Los Angeles Lakers vs Washington Wizards injury report: Who's playing, injured and questionable players, head-to-head records, team stats, and more (January 30, 2026) There is no doubt about his status.

for the road game between theand the Washington Wizards because of soreness in his left ankle. The team plans to make the final call shortly before the game starts.This is not a ruling that he is out. It means the Lakers want to see how his ankle feels after warm-ups before deciding.Luka Doncic's problem started earlier this week against the Cleveland Cavaliers. After taking a shot, Doncic stepped back and lost his footing near the edge of the raised court. He slipped into the gap between the playing surface and the sideline area. His left leg twisted as he fell and he had to leave the game for a short time.He later returned and still finished with 29 points, six assists and five rebounds in about 30 minutes. After the game he said he was not fully healthy. Since then, the team has treated the issue as left ankle soreness and limited his load in practice.For the game at Capital One Arena, Luka Doncic is officially marked as questionable with left ankle soreness. Austin Reaves is also listed as questionable because of a left calf problem.Rookie Adou Thiero is ruled out with a right MCL sprain. A questionable tag usually means the player has a real chance to play, but nothing is certain until closer to tip-off.The Los Angeles Lakers are fighting for playoff position in the West. Luka Doncic has carried a large part of their offense this season. In 38 games he is averaging 33.6 points, 8.7 assists and 7.7 rebounds. He handles the ball, creates shots and scores at a high rate.If he cannot play, the Lakers will have to rely more on role players and bench scorers. That could make it easier for Washington to control the game.The decision will likely come after shootaround and pre-game warm-ups. Updates will appear on team channels and the official feeds of the NBA in the hours before tip-off. Players in this situation often end up playing, but the team may be careful because the fall in Cleveland was unusual and could have made the ankle unstable.Tip-off is 7:00 p.m. Eastern Time. That means the final update should come around 5:30 to 6:30 a.m. IST, one to two hours before the game starts.Also read: Is LeBron James playing tonight vs the Washington Wizards?

NHL Insider says Artemi Panarin demands a staggering amount of $50 million contract extension

Is Artemi Panarin on the Move? 🤔

Artemi Panarin, who has been making headlines due to his trade from the New York Rangers, seems to have made their trade efforts more complicated as the Rangers star is reportedly demanding a staggering amount of $50 million contract extension, as reported by NHL insider Elliotte Friedman.The New York Rangers are going through a significant roster shake-up, the team is preparing to move a high-profile player, and they have apparently decided to scratch star forward Artemi Panarin in a 5-2 loss to the New York Islanders at UBS Arena on Thursday.As per reports, Panarin will not play for the New York Rangers in their last two games before the NHL roster freeze for the Olympic Winter Games Milano Cortina 2026, which begins Feb. 4, 2026. Meanwhile, the Rangers are sitting at the bottom of the Eastern Conference with very limited possibilities to be back in form.As the trade buzz around Artemi Panarin has attracted huge traction, NHL Insider has stated that the star winger has made trade efforts for the New York Rangers complicated by asking for a staggering amount of $50 million contract extension.According to Sportsnet, NHL insider Elliotte Friedman revealed on his 32 Thoughts Podcast that he's been hearing from teams that Panarin and his agent, Paul Theofanous, are seeking a $50 million contract extension. Friedman stated, “I think everybody understands that if you're going to get Panarin, he is going to try to hit a contract home run, even though he's 34 years old. And the number I was hearing, and a few teams backed me on this, was $50 million,""NHL Insider Kevin Weekes reported this week that as many as 14 teams have expressed interest in Panarin, including Anaheim, Los Angeles, San Jose, Vegas, Dallas, Utah, Colorado, Minnesota, Seattle, Toronto, Carolina, Washington, Tampa Bay, and New York Islanders.“Per sources, as of today, I’m told the following have expressed interest in Panarin: ANA, LA, SJ, VGK, DAL, UT, COL, MIN, SEA, TOR, CAR, WAS, TBL, NYI. More clubs will join, and importantly player has to approve any move first,” the insider tweeted.As per reports, among them, the current Stanley Cup champions Florida Panthers, have gained traction as a team, and according to NHL insider Pierre LeBrun, the Panthers sit near the top of Panarin’s personal list, due to the team’s approach and recent success. “If I had to think of a team that would probably be number one on Panarin’s list, I would say the Florida Panthers, like almost every other player in the league,” LeBrun said.While Friedman says that the Colorado Avalanche and Anaheim Ducks could only acquire Panarin as a rental. However, the Dallas Stars would only do a trade and contract extension if they move on from Jason Robertson.It is important to note that Artemi Panarin is in the final year of his seven-year, $81.5 million contract, with $11.64 million in average annual value. Now, it will be interesting to witness which team will choose Panarin with a good trade deal.","Artemi panarin has been making headlines due to his trade from the new york rangers.

Main factors in the Portland Trail Blazers vs New York Knicks game (January 30, 2026)

What to expect on Blazers vs Knicks Jan 30

Thein New York with both teams in very different situations. Portland is trying to stop a three-game slide while dealing with several injuries. New York is coming in on a four-game winning streak and has most of its main players available.This game is likely to be decided by depth and basic execution. Portland is missing key guards and needs replacement players to handle the ball and score. New York’s job is not as difficult. They need to defend well, take care of the ball, and use its size advantage.The game will be played at Madison Square Garden, where the Knicks have been strong this season. New York already beat Portland once earlier in the year, and the Blazers are even more short-handed for this meeting.Portland Trail Blazers are 23-25 and have lost three straight. Head coach Chauncey Billups has to rely on a thin rotation.• Damian Lillard - left Achilles management• Scoot Henderson - left knee tear, out for weeks• Matisse Thybulle - right knee tendinopathy• Kris Murray - undisclosed issue• Blake Wesley - sidelined• Duop Reath - right foot stress fracture• Deni Avdija - low back strain, around 25 points and 7 rebounds per game• Robert Williams III - knee managementIf Avdija cannot play, Portland will depend more on Shaedon Sharpe for scoring and on Jerami Grant for defense and secondary offense.Without Lillard and Henderson, Portland lacks steady ball handling. That has led to many turnovers this season.New York Knicks are 29-18 and has won four in a row.• Josh Hart - ankle soreness• Miles McBride - ankle management• Jalen Brunson - around 26 points and 6 assists per game• Karl-Anthony Towns - about 20 points and 11 rebounds• Mikal Bridges• OG Anunoby - around 16 points and 5.4 reboundsIf Hart or McBride sits, Brunson will handle the ball more often, with Bridges and Anunoby helping to create plays.These teams have met 126 times in the regular season. Portland leads the series 70-56. New York won the first meeting this season 123-114 on January 11, 2026. In that game, Brunson and Towns scored more than 40 points combined, and Portland struggled with turnovers.Portland now enters the rematch with fewer healthy guards than it had in that loss.Portland’s last few games include losses by scores of 111-115 and 94-102. The team averages about 16.1 turnovers per game, one of the highest marks in the league.New York has won games by wide margins during its streak, including 119-92 and 103-87. The Knicks have controlled rebounds and limited easy fast-break chances for opponents. Towns anchors the middle, and the wings cover ground on defense. This sets up a simple contrast: Portland must avoid mistakes, while New York looks to force them.Portland needs reliable offense without its top two guards. Sharpe has to score efficiently, Grant has to defend without fouling, and Avdija, if he plays, has to contribute on both ends.New York needs steady guard play if Hart or McBride cannot go. Brunson will see more pressure, so wing support is important. Turnovers will likely decide the pace. If Portland protects the ball, the game can stay close. If New York forces early mistakes, it can build a quick lead.This matchup favors New York. The Knicks are healthier, at home, and have already beaten this opponent once this season. Avdija’s status is the biggest variable. If he plays well, Portland can stay competitive. If he is out, New York should control rebounds, limit mistakes, and manage the game from start to finish.For Portland, the path is simple and that is fewer turnovers and balanced scoring. For New York, it is strong defense, good rebounding, and letting its main players carry the offense.","Portland trail blazers are 23-25 and have lost three straight.

‘I Did That on Purpose’: Tony Romo Admits Taylor Swift ‘Wife’ Line Was a Troll Note,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/i-did-that-on-purpose-tony-romo-admits-taylor-swift-wife-line-was-a-troll-note/articleshow/127804194.cms,"Tony Romo admitted he intentionally called Taylor Swift Travis Kelce’s “wife” on air in 2023 to mess with fans.

Tony Romo Says He Dropped the ‘Wife’ Line to Make Fans Spiral

The Real Story Is the Pressure Romo Admitted Came With the Swift-Kelce Spotlight

Tony Romo is owning it. The former Dallas Cowboys quarterback says his viral on-air slip in December 2023 was not a slip at all. He intentionally called Taylor Swift Travis Kelce’s “wife” to mess with fans while the relationship was turning into the NFL’s biggest side show.Romo made the confession Thursday, Jan. 29, during SiriusXM’s “The Morning Mash Up.” He said he wanted people to “think for a second,” then realized the internet took the bait exactly like he expected.Romo admitted he leaned into the moment on purpose. “I did that on purpose and people were like, ‘Do you know something?’” He followed it with the real point of the prank. “Nah, I just wanted to make you guys think for a second [and] just mess with you a little bit.”The original moment happened on Dec. 10, 2023, during a Kansas City Chiefs loss to the Buffalo Bills, when Romo referred to Swift as Kelce’s “wife,” then corrected himself. A week later, he did it again during Chiefs vs. Raiders, then quickly walked it back with “girlfriend,” setting up the booth banter that made the clip travel.At the time, it was obviously inaccurate. Swift and Kelce did not announce their engagement until Aug.26, 2025, when they posted, “Your English teacher and your gym teacher are getting married 🧨.”Romo’s “trolling” confession is funny, but the subtext is the tell. He also said it was difficult to stay neutral and balanced while the Swift-Kelce coverage exploded and cameras kept hunting for her reaction shots. That’s not a small thing for an analyst. The job is the game. The broadcast also knows what drives attention.And that’s why this clip never died. It wasn’t just “did he misspeak.” It was “is the booth playing along with the circus.” Romo’s answer is basically yes. He pushed a button because he knew fans would fight about it, clip it, repost it, and keep the conversation going long after the final whistle.","Tony romo admitted he intentionally called taylor swift travis kelce’s ‘wife’ on air in 2023 to mess with fans.

Kevin Durant momentised the viral Ashy legs joke

Kevin Durant’s dominance on and off the court

Kevin Durant’s stature as an NBA superstar is equipped with relentless scoring on the court and sharp wit on social media. However, his latest victory didn't involve a buzzer-beater, but rather a clever pivot in the world of skincare.On Tuesday, January 27, 2026, NBA superstar Kevin Durant released a viral video addressing the internet’s long-standing obsession with his ashy legs, while officially announcing a partnership with the global skincare brand CeraVe. Durant gave some hilarious replies to tweets posted by fans. By leaning into the meme culture rather than fighting them, the 15-time All-Star has successfully monetized one of the most persistent jokes in his NBA career.Kevin Durant via his X account on Thursday posted, “Y’all keep bringing up my legs…might be time to address it with @cerave? #ad.” But to understand how and what led to this moment, let’s rewind to November 2021.During a game, a close-up photo of Durant’s dry, cracked ankles went viral. This led to NBA fans’ roast show. But Durant’s performance that night remained elite, a fact he pointedly highlighted in his new promotional video.“I had 35 points on 12 shots that night. That is way more important than my ashy ankles,” remarked Durant.The partnership with the global skincare brand CeraVe, owned by L'Oréal, marks a significant branding shift for Durant. In the clip, Durant responds with a shrug and a background cash register sound to a fan tweet that said, “Going to be the first NBA player with a lotion deal.”In December 2025, on an episode of the Unguarded podcast, the 37-year-old admitted that he had stopped minding his grooming. He said, “I really used to care at one point about like, ‘Man, let me get a [haircut] this week. Then after a while, I was like, ‘I'm way more relaxed when I'm just not giving a f***.’ I just stopped getting cut. Stopped lotioning.”Now, from that to this partnership, Durant’s laid-back attitude and raw honesty have laid the perfect foundation for an ad campaign with a global skincare brand.While Durant is making headlines for his skin, his on-court production for the Houston Rockets remains stellar. Playing in his 18th NBA season, Durant is averaging 26.5 points, 5.4 rebounds, and 4.5 assists per game while shooting at an efficiency of 51.4% from the field and above 40% from the arc.Currently, Durant sits at 6th place in the NBA’s all-time scoring list, a feat that he recently achieved.
