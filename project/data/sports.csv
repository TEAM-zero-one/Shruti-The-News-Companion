T20 World Cup: India humiliate Pakistan again

Super 8 Qualified Teams

India (Group A)

Sri Lanka (Group B)

Zimbabwe (Group B)

England (Group C)

West Indies (Group C)

New Zealand (Group D)

South Africa (Group D)

One spot remaining: Pakistan (if they beat Namibia).

If Pakistan lose: USA qualify.

Netherlands need a huge win over India to stay in contention (NRR factor).

Super 8 Groups

The eight teams will now be split into two further groups in the Super 8 stage:

Super 8 – Group 1 (G1)

India

Zimbabwe

South Africa

West Indies

Super 8 – Group 2 (G2)

TBA (Pakistan/USA/Netherlands)

New Zealand

Sri Lanka

England

The Super 8 stage of the ICC T20 World Cup is nearly set, with seven teams confirming qualification and one final berth still to be decided.From Group A, India advanced in dominant fashion, winning all three of their matches.Group B saw Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe progress after Zimbabwe’s final league game against Ireland was washed out in Kandy. The shared points eliminated the 2021 champions Australia, who cannot catch Zimbabwe on the table.From Group C, England and West Indies qualified, while Group D representatives are New Zealand and South Africa.That leaves Pakistan in a must-win situation against Namibia. Victory will send Pakistan through and complete the Super 8 lineup. Any other result will confirm their elimination.However, there are further permutations. If Pakistan lose, United States national cricket team will qualify. The Netherlands national cricket team also remain mathematically in contention — but only if they defeat India by a massive margin. The challenge for the Netherlands is their net run rate of -1.352, compared to USA’s healthy +0.787, making qualification highly improbable unless there is a dramatic swing in results and NRR.The top two teams from each Super 8 group will advance to the semi-finals, setting up the final sprint towards the T20 World Cup 2026 title.","The super 8 stage of the icc t20 world cup is nearly set, with seven teams confirming qualification and one final berth still to be decided.

Tom Wilson Breaks Down the Sequence of His Fight



Washington Capitals winger Tom Wilson triggered the first fight in men's Olympic hockey since 1998 when he dropped the gloves against France's Pierre Crinon with seven minutes remaining in Canada's dominant 10-2 preliminary round victory Sunday at Santagiulia Arena in Milan.The altercation was sparked by a forearm Crinon delivered to Nathan MacKinnon's head in the third period. The French defenseman received only a two-minute minor for the high hit, a punishment Wilson and his Canadian teammates felt fell well short of what was deserved.Mollie Walker reported Wilson's post-game breakdown of how events unfolded. The Capitals winger said the decision to drop the gloves came quickly once he found himself face-to-face with the same player who had targeted MacKinnon.After Wilson finished a hard check on Crinon behind the French net, the situation escalated rapidly. ""It was kind of a dirty hit,"" Wilson said. ""I obviously ended up with the same guy who had done it. Hockey is an emotional game. It's a competitive game.”He continued, “When you come together with a big guy, you kind of have to make the decision quickly and the gloves came off."" Wilson described being thrown to the ice as the moment instincts fully took over.""Got thrown down to the ice, and then from there it's just kind of a melee,"" he said. ""I mean, it's fight or flight at that point. I just wanted to stick up for our team.""MacKinnon praised Wilson after the final buzzer, noting Crinon's hit was clearly late and high. ""I definitely appreciate him sticking up for me,"" MacKinnon said. Connor McDavid also backed his teammate, saying Wilson was just protecting himself and calling him exactly the type of player every team needs.Drew Doughty noted that fighting is rare in Olympic hockey but Wilson's response was entirely expected given the circumstances. ""When a guy takes a run at one of our big guys, that's what Willy does,"" Doughty said. The bout also completed Wilson's Olympic Gordie Howe hat trick, having already scored a goal and added an assist.Crinon was suspended by the French hockey federation for the rest of the tournament for violating Olympic spirit. Wilson was cleared by the NHL-IIHF disciplinary committee and will suit up for Canada's quarterfinal Wednesday as the gold medal favorites open the knockout rounds.",Washington capitals winger tom wilson triggered the first fight in men's olympic hockey since 1998.

NEW DELHI: Australia’s T20 World Cup campaign came to an abrupt end on Tuesday after rain washed out Zimbabwe’s Group B fixture against Ireland in Pallekele without a single ball being bowled.The abandonment proved decisive, as the shared points carried Zimbabwe into the second stage of the tournament for the first time, while the 2021 champions were eliminated.Seven teams have now sealed their spots in the next round.

If the NFL gave out a Lombardi Trophy for ""Most Interesting Offseason,"" Los Angeles Rams star Puka Nacua would already be planning his parade.Just weeks after the Rams’ 2025 season ended, the 24-year-old wide receiver has managed to stay in more headlines than a political scandal. But while most players are training or vacationing in silence, Puka is out here playing ""Relationship Roulette"" with the internet’s favorite icons.On February 15, 2026, Puka turned up at the Daytona 500 but not with an influencer or a friend, but with 14-time WWE Women’s Champion Charlotte Flair (39).Charlotte didn't hide the hang-out, either. She posted a series of photos to her Instagram story of the two lookingcomfortable, walking arm-in-arm through the pits. Her caption:Since Charlotte finalized her divorce from wrestler Andrade El Idolo back in late 2024, the ""Queen"" has been single and fans are officially losing their minds over the possibility of a new sports power couple.Fans instantly pointed out how thrilling and exciting this offseason looks for Puka, they are treating Puka’s dating life like he’s still playing for fantasy points.With a 15-year age difference between the Rams star and the WWE legend, the jokes were inevitable.A popular theory is that Puka is simply trying to complete every possible celebrity interaction before training camp starts.Not everyone is laughing. Rams fans are starting to wonder if Puka is gettingmuch cardio off the field.The chaos truly began in early February 2026. During an interview, actress Sydney Sweeney described her ideal man as someone ""athletic, outgoing, and willing to go skydiving.""Puka didn’t hesitate. He hopped on X (Twitter) with a simple, two-word response that broke the sports-world internet:""Love skydiving.""While that move alone earned him ""legend"" status among his teammates, he wasn’t done.

Here is everything you need to know about the trophy’s ""off-season"" at the mall.



1. It’s a 7-Pound Masterpiece

2. $50,000 of Sterling Silver

3. The 4-Month ""Labor of Love""

4. Engraving the ""Final Score""

5. Why it’s in Bellevue

6. 72 Hours of Hand-Punching

7. The ""Replica"" Secret

Just nine days after the Seattle Seahawks defeated the Patriots 29–13 in Super Bowl LX, the city’s favorite item has returned to its birthplace. The Vince Lombardi Trophy is currently on display at Tiffany & Co. in Bellevue Square, drawing massive crowds of the ""12th Man"" eager for a victory selfie.Despite its massive presence, the trophy is surprisingly light. It stands exactly 22 inches tall and weighs approximately 7 pounds (107.3 ounces). This specific weight was chosen by designer Oscar Riedener in 1966 so that a victorious player could easily hoist it with one hand.The trophy is crafted entirely from .925 sterling silver. While stadium lights often give it a golden hue, there is no gold in its composition. The estimated production cost is $50,000, though its ""replacement value"" for insurance is significantly higher due to its status as a one-of-a-kind art piece.Each year, a new trophy is built from scratch at the Tiffany hollowware workshop in Cumberland, Rhode Island. It takes master silversmiths approximately four months to complete, utilizing ancient techniques like spinning, soldering, and hand-chasing.The trophy currently in Bellevue is a finished masterpiece, but it’s actually ""incomplete."" Following the victory parade, the trophy is traditionally sent back to the workshop to have the final score (29–13) and the names of the winning players permanently hand-engraved into the base.Tiffany & Co. has a long-standing tradition of displaying the trophy in the winning team's home city. Because the Seahawks won Super Bowl LX, the Bellevue Square location, one of the brand's premier Pacific Northwest stores was selected as the official ""fan hub"" for the trophy’s local tour.Look closely at the silver football on top. Every ""dimple"" and lace on that regulation-size silver ball is hand-punched. There are no machines used in the detailing; it requires roughly 72 hours of direct manual labor to ensure the texture perfectly mimics a real pigskin.While the trophy in Bellevue is an official Tiffany-made Lombardi, the Seahawks organization often keeps the ""Game Day"" trophy (the one kissed by Kenneth Walker III and Sam Darnold) at the VMAC training facility for team events. The store often displays a ""sister trophy"" or a high-fidelity replica to ensure the original remains safe during the chaotic post-Super Bowl weeks.","Tiffany & co. has a long-standing tradition of displaying the trophy in the winning team's home city.

Determined Celtics leader Jayson Tatum drops strong comeback hint after major Achilles rehab progress

Boston Celtics stay cautious with Jayson Tatum’s return despite strong playoff push and fan optimism

Jayson Tatum, the standout player for the Boston Celtics, tore his Achilles during Game 4 of the NBA playoffs against the New York Knicks in May of last year. That was around nine months ago. For background, Jayson Tatum sustained the injury during the Boston Celtics' defeat by the New York Knicks in the Eastern Conference Semifinals the previous season.After 40 weeks of recuperation, Tatum is making quick progress and gave an emotional update on his 2025 and 2026 rehab experiences as rumors of his comeback continue to circulate. Even though there were early concerns that he would miss the entire 2025–2026 NBA season, Tatum is giving positive updates on his recuperation.After tearing his Achilles tendon during the previous postseason, Jayson Tatum made it plain that he wanted to return to the court before the end of the current campaign. The forward for the Boston Celtics has recovered from his injury more quickly than most anticipated, and his confidence has remained strong throughout.Tatum recently reached the 40-week milestone and paused to consider the behind-the-scenes aspects of the process. Tatum wrote:“40 weeks… I’ve really grown to appreciate this journey I’ve been on and allow time for me to pat myself on the back for showing up every day!”ESPN's Shams Charania gave an update on Tatum a little more than a week ago, stating that he is still making the required preparations for a return in the near future.As stated by Charania on February 8:“He has aggressively attacked his rehab at every turn. And listen, there are more boxes for Jayson Tatum to check… There are more phases in his rehab; he’s gotta practice with the team, of course..”He continued:“And then, again, there are also the normal nerves of coming back from an injury of this magnitude — a torn Achilles in May — to a really good team that has aspirations for potentially advancing in the playoffs.”Previously, Tatum has uploaded footage of himself in the gym, going through dribbling drills, strolling through one-on-one situations with coaches, and performing stationary dunks. He's obviously hoping to make a comeback this season, providing his rehabilitation continues to proceed as planned.Tatum hinted at a possible comeback on social media on Monday. The caption for the picture was just one word: ""Soon."" The picture shows Tatum with his trainer, Nick Sang, on the sidelines.The 27-year-old Tatum might make a comeback for the season's last quarter.

Nevertheless, Celtics supporters surely hope that the team's star forward will be able to play while there is still time on the calendar to have an impact.The front management has consistently stated that Boston will not rush their star forward back from injury, despite Tatum's efforts and the optimism of the fan base. In his absence, the Celtics have maintained their competitiveness and surpassed All-Star Jaylen Brown to take one of the stronger spots in the Eastern Conference.

Dave Ryding reflects on Olympic career, final season goals, and historic impact on British alpine skiing

Dave Ryding stood at the finish line knowing a long chapter of his life was ending. The 39-year-old British skier delivered an emotional message after his final Olympic race at the Milano Cortina 2026 Winter Games. Speaking through tears, Dave Ryding signaled that retirement was near, closing a journey that inspired winter sports fans for more than a decade.Ryding finished 17th in the men’s slalom in Bormio. While it was not a medal result, the moment still mattered deeply. He was among only 46 skiers who completed the difficult race out of 96 starters, showing his determination until the very end. Soon after the race, he opened his heart about the future. “We’ll see, we’ll see. To be honest, I feel like it’s time,” he said, as reported by TNT. His words made clear that the Olympic stage had likely seen his final run.Emotion-filled Ryding’s voice as he described the end of his career. “I will never look back and think ‘What if?’ I will never look back and think, ‘Did I retire too early?’ I gave it my all right until the end, and it was a hell of a ride,” he said. He added that the journey brought unforgettable highs, meaningful friendships, and even meeting his wife through skiing.The Milano Cortina 2026 appearance marked Ryding’s fifth Winter Olympics. He had already shared in June 2025 that this season would be his last in competitive ski racing. Even so, he wanted to finish with pride. After crossing the finish line in Bormio, he bowed to the crowd to thank fans and the sport that shaped his life. He later admitted he might have stayed one season longer than expected, but he wanted to leave knowing he had given everything.Ryding’s Olympic history includes a strong ninth-place finish at the 2018 Winter Games, his best result on that stage. Beyond the Olympics, he made national history in 2022 by becoming the first British alpine skier to win a World Cup gold medal. That victory proved that athletes from Great Britain could compete with the world’s best in a sport long dominated by other nations.Before his final season began, Ryding clearly explained his goal. “As everyone knows, this is my last season of ski racing, and I’m going to give everything I’ve got to make my final Olympics my best one,” he told ESPN. He also thanked the people who supported him through years of training and competition.Now, as retirement approaches, Ryding leaves behind more than results. He leaves a story of persistence, national pride, and love for the sport. His journey shows that success is not only about medals but also about dedication and heart.","Dave ryding shared heartfelt retirement message as final winter olympics slalom in milano cortina 2026 closes historic skiing chapter.

2. A Disastrous Week on the Field and in Court

3. The ""Little Miss Drama"" Confirmation

""Just because I ain’t f*ing with my baby daddy doesn't mean you get to talk about my baby daddy!""

For New England Patriots star Stefon Diggs, February 8, 2026, was supposed to be the pinnacle of his career. Instead, it became the week he lost it all: the Lombardi Trophy, his spotless reputation, and his high-profile relationship with Cardi B Just nine days after the Patriots' crushing 29–13 loss to the Seattle Seahawks, the ""Super Bowl LX Curse"" has officially claimed its most famous couple. Here is the breakdown of the three reasons why the most talked-about romance of 2025 collapsed in real-time.The breaking point allegedly occurred before the coin toss even happened. Viral footage from the Super Bowl sidelines showed a woman known as Pree (previously linked to Cardi’s ex, Offset) wearing an official ""WAGs"" credential and shaking hands with Diggs.Tensions boiled over when Pree was spotted sitting in the Diggs family section, mere rows away from where Cardi B was expected to sit. While Cardi performed a high-energy halftime cameo with Bad Bunny, she notably ""vanished"" immediately after her set, skipping the rest of the game and the post-game festivities.Winning heals all wounds, but losing Super Bowl LX only exposed the fractures. Diggs finished the game with a lackluster 3 catches for 37 yards, leading to brutal trolling from fans and rappers like BIA and 50 Cent.Compounding the sports failure was a mounting legal crisis. On February 13, just days after the loss, Diggs reportedly had to address a felony strangulation charge involving his former private chef. The combination of professional failure and legal drama reportedly led Cardi, who has been in ""protection mode"" since welcoming their son, in November 2025 to finally pull the plug.Cardi B officially signaled the end of the road during her ""Little Miss Drama"" Tour stop at the Kia Forum on February 15. In a viral moment that has since dominated TikTok, Cardi addressed a diss from BIA by telling the crowd:The statement served as a dual-purpose announcement: it confirmed the breakup while asserting that Diggs is still ""family"" and off-limits to outsiders.By Monday morning, both stars had scrubbed their Instagram feeds of each other and hit the ""unfollow"" button. While sources say that a reconciliation is ""possible"" once the Super Bowl dust settles, Cardi’s focus is clearly on her record-breaking tour and her four children.

Nelly Korda balances Tiger Woods partnership, TGL criticism, and strong return to form in 2026 season

Nelly Korda and Tiger Woods are back in the spotlight together, but this time the story is about business and timing. Just days after Nelly Korda publicly questioned the new tech-driven TGL league backed by Tiger Woods, she stepped into a fresh partnership connected to him. The move surprised many fans because her earlier comments raised concerns about missed opportunities for women’s golf. Still, the World No. 2 quickly shifted focus toward a new chapter. Korda announced a major agreement with Upper Deck, a global leader in sports trading cards and memorabilia that already works with Woods.The partnership will bring her image to trading cards, collectibles, and long-term branding projects starting in 2026. Sharing her excitement, Korda said, “I’ve seen firsthand the passion and joy that collecting brings to so many people. It isn’t just about creating collectibles; it’s about working with a company that knows how to best represent your brand and connect with fans all over the world.” Her decision shows a balance between speaking honestly about the sport and building new opportunities beyond the course.Before the partnership news, Korda had openly shared mixed feelings about TGL.She said, “I think it’s a huge and unbelievable mistake that we’re not playing alongside the men. There’s no greater way to grow the game, and it would have been revolutionary.” At the same time, she added, “I also think it’s great that we are getting this opportunity, so that’s my mixed feelings.”While that debate continued, her focus returned to performance. The 27-year-old entered 2026 after a frustrating 2025 season where she went winless in 20 starts. Even so, she still recorded nine top-10 finishes and earned about $2.8 million, showing her level never truly dropped. Looking back, she admitted on The Lads YouTube channel, “A year without missing cuts, but I’d rather actually miss a couple and win… there were flashes of really great golf. ”Her response came quickly in 2026. Korda ended a 14-month win drought by capturing the Hilton Grand Vacations Tournament of Champions, proving she remains one of the best players in the world. With confidence rising again, she is preparing for a busy schedule that includes the Mexico Riviera Maya Open at Mayakoba, the Amundi Evian Championship, the AIG Women’s British Open at Royal Lytham, and the Solheim Cup in the Netherlands.Together, the business partnership and on-course comeback show an athlete shaping her future in more ways than one. Korda continues to speak openly, compete strongly, and expand her global presence, often in the same headlines as Tiger Woods.","Nelly korda questions tiger woods tgl format then joins upper deck partnership after 2026 comeback win season.

Tyson Fury and John Fury relationship under spotlight as heavyweight comeback raises questions

Tyson Fury is stepping back into boxing again, and this time the biggest debate is not about his opponent but it is about his family. The former heavyweight champion, who announced retirement after losing twice to Oleksandr Usyk in late 2024, is returning to the ring for another comeback fight scheduled in London. Fury’s decision has already sparked strong reactions, especially from his father, John Fury, who publicly said he is unhappy with the way things are going.The comeback has quickly become a talking point because Fury’s inner circle appears divided. While the boxer is focused on training and preparing for his next challenge, his family worries about his health and the direction of his career. Reports also suggest tension at home, making the buildup to his return feel more personal than sporting. As Fury prepares for another high-pressure fight, questions about family support and long-term safety are growing louder.John Fury has openly shared his frustration, saying he feels pushed away from his son’s team. Speaking to the Daily Mail, he explained that people around Tyson have influenced their relationship.He said, “I don’t think he listens to me because of the people around him. I just think there have been that many people in his ear about me… If you get told enough times, ‘your father’s this, your father’s that,’ you start believing it.”John has worked closely with Tyson since the start of his career, so his comments carry weight. Even though he supports his son’s return, he wants him fully prepared.He added, “I want to see him coming in against this man with a pair of shoulders, big, solid, muscled up for him. I don’t want to see a thin, fat guy who’s done a bit of skipping and some bag work.”Tyson Fury has also admitted family relationships have been tense.In another interview with the Daily Mail, he said his father, brothers, and even his wife Paris had stopped speaking to him for a period.At the same time, Fury says recent events made him rethink life and push toward another fight.Now, as the London bout gets closer, the focus is not only on boxing skills but also on whether Tyson Fury can balance family pressure, public expectation, and one more shot at success inside the ring.","Tyson fury is returning to the ring for another comeback fight in london.

Could George Pickens be Micah Parsons 2.0 with Jerry Jones or would franchise tag help?

Would Jerry Jones negotiate with David Mulugheta for George Pickens?

ESPN’s Todd Archer reported that the Dallas Cowboys had issues with wide receiver George Pickens arriving on time, which led to internal punishment. Archer’s sources said Pickens was fined during the season.However, when Cowboys owner Jerry Jones was asked about it, he downplayed the issue, saying, “I’ve missed a few [meetings] myself,” and called Pickens an outstanding teammate. This leniency could suggest a double standard on accountability by the Cowboys, especially after Micah Parsons’ chapter in the 2025 season.The contract negotiations and disputes that dominated the 2025 offseason for Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones and defensive end Micah Parsons may resume with wide receiver George Pickens. Pickens had 93 receptions for 1,429 yards and nine touchdowns in 2025. This is his final contract year.After his strong performance last year, he is expected to demand more. However, reports say a franchise tag worth $27 to 28 million could be applied to Pickens.ESPN’s Todd Archer reports that players do not want a franchise tag because, even if fully guaranteed, it does not provide long-term security. Teams often use it as a stepping-stone toward a long-term agreement.If Pickens does not favor this, and since David Mulugheta, Micah Parsons’ agent, also represents Pickens, there is a slim chance Pickens could become Parsons 2.0 for the 2026 season.Parsons attended the mandatory minicamp and training camp but did not practice. The relationship was strained and he was traded to the Green Bay Packers for Kenny Clark in exchange.Archer reported that the franchise tag could guarantee Pickens’ stay for the 2026 season, but it also raises the possibility he might skip the offseason program, minicamp, or training camp.“I don’t know. We’ll see how it goes. Probably both. But I expect to be speaking with George [Pickens],” Jerry Jones said on 105.3 The Fan in early January when asked about the upcoming negotiations with Pickens, who shares an agent [David Mulugheta] with Parsons.Sports Illustrated’s Randy Gurzi reported that Jones doesn’t believe he did anything wrong [with Parsons chapter], and states that Parsons is the one who backed out of a deal [five-year contract worth nearly $202.5 million].Instead of learning from this and agreeing to keep Mulugheta in the loop, Jones still believes he should negotiate directly with the players.","George pickens had 93 receptions for 1,429 yards and nine touchdowns in 2025.

He then started to behave in a way which many viewers found disrespectful.Viewers active on the live stream said Shabazz appeared intoxicated and repeatedly ignored warnings.

Brad Marchand Team Canada quarterfinal lineup decision against Latvia explained



Before the Olympic quarterfinals, Team Canada's lineup talks have gotten more serious. Veteran forward Brad Marchand is expected to rejoin the team. The return of the experienced winger, who had been out of earlier games, has been a big topic of conversation in recent NHL updates. Analysts are trying to figure out how his presence could change the team's balance during the elimination stage.Jon Cooper, the head coach, now has to make a big decision that takes into account performance, chemistry, and tactical needs. Younger players have brought energy to the tournament, but when the pressure is on in knockout hockey, the focus often shifts to proven veterans. This situation has sparked debate among insiders and fans about which player should make room for Marchand.Brad Marchand, representing Team Canada, is set to play in the Olympic quarterfinal matchup against Latvia after being a healthy scratch in previous games. The Boston Bruins forward is widely recognized for his playoff-style intensity and leadership, qualities that many believe could be crucial in high-pressure elimination contests.Craig Button, an NHL insider, recently said that the Carolina Hurricanes could take Seth Jarvis out of the lineup to make room for Marchand, and Button said that even though Jarvis is fast and skilled, Team Canada might put more value on physicality, defensive awareness, and experience deeper in the lineup during knockout play.Jon Cooper's choice will probably take into account both the matchup and the chemistry of the team, and Canada may focus on structured forechecking and veteran calmness against Latvia, especially as the tournament moves into win-or-go-home situations.","Brad marchand, representing team canada, is set to play in the olympic quarterfinal matchup against latvia after being a healthy scratch in previous games.
