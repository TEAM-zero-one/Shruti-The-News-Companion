Poll Will Praggnanandhaa become the next World Chess Champion? Yes, definitely! Maybe in the future. No, he won't. Unsure at this moment.

Dutch No.1 Grandmaster Anish Giri, 31, sparked conversation across the chess world on Friday with a tongue-in-cheek reaction to R Praggnanandhaa becoming the new World No.1 junior.“Chess juniors nowadays have to be at least U16, keeping track of U20 players is totally pointless,” Giri, who currently holds the live rating of 2748.0 and is world no. 10, wrote, hinting at how elite young talents are now already competing at the top of the senior world rankings.The remark came shortly after 19-year-old Praggnanandhaa’s remarkable victory at the UzChess Cup Masters 2025 in Uzbekistan, which propelled him to a live rating of 2778.3 — making him the World No.4 overall and officially India’s highest-rated chess player.He leapfrogged both World Champion D Gukesh (2776.6) and Arjun Erigaisi (2775.7), reshuffling the Indian chess hierarchy.Praggnanandhaa’s road to victory was nothing short of dramatic. Starting the final day behind both Nodirbek Abdusattorov and Javokhir Sindarov, he scored a crucial win over Abdusattorov in the last classical round to force a three-way tie.In the blitz tiebreaks, Praggnanandhaa showed nerves of steel, eventually winning the tournament in the second set of rapid games — his third major classical title of the year.Five-time world champion Viswanathan Anand applauded the youngster, stating, “This win seemed the least likely with just two rounds to go… An impressive demonstration of character.”With this triumph, Praggnanandhaa adds the UzChess Cup to his 2025 title haul, which already includes victories at the Tata Steel Chess Tournament and the Superbet Classic in Romania. He also recently finished runner-up at the Stepan Avagyan Memorial.While Giri’s comment playfully downplays the relevance of junior rankings, Praggnanandhaa’s performance makes one thing clear — the future of world chess is already here, and it’s thriving in India.",19-year-old r praggnanandhaa won the uzchess cup masters 2025 in uzbekistan. His win propelled him to a live rating of 2778.3 — making him the world no.4 overall.

Dwyane Wade and Gabrielle Union have spoken about the things they have learned from their failed first marriages and how it helped to make their marriage stronger



Dwyane Wade might have retired from the NBA a few years ago but his marriage to Gabrielle Union is still considered to be one of the strongest marriages in the world of sports and entertainment. Both Dwyane Wade and his wife, Gabrielle Union, have stayed by each other’s side on the toughest days, and a few years ago, they had opened up about why their marriage is so strong.In 2021, two years before Dwyane Wade was diagnosed with cancer, the NBA legend and his wife, popular Hollywood actress Gabrielle Union, spoke to People together about how they have managed to make their marriage work, despite demanding careers and failed marriages in the past.Dwyane Wade had said, “It’s about learning each other, learning what she wants for her life and for her career and trying to support all those things.”Hollywood actress, Gabrielle Union, added, “This is both of our second marriages...We didn’t do it right, the first time around. There’s another way – to be more collaborative and equitable. We humble ourselves, listen and we meet in the middle.”Previously, Dwyane Wade was married to his high school sweetheart, Siohvaughn Funches, but the two split just after five years of marriage in 2007 and got legally divorced in 2010.Gabrielle Union was also married to Chris Howard, but the two divorced in 2005, after six years of marriage which the actress had admitted that she and her ex husband had engaged in infidelity.Even though Gabrielle Union and Dwyane Wade started dating in 2008, the NBA legend ended up having a child out of wedlock when the two broke up for a short while in 2013.However, both Dwyane Wade and Gabrielle Union stayed together despite the NBA legend fathering a child with a different woman, and today the blended family have a strong bond with one another.Currently, while Gabrielle Union is pretty busy with her successful and flourishing career in Hollywood, Dwyane Wade is busy creating awareness about the illness he experienced and how he has recovered.Also Read: “I can’t afford to pay”: Dwyane Wade’s wife Gabrielle Union opens up about financial pressures despite the NBA legend’s massive net worth","Dwyane wade and gabrielle union got candid about their first marriages in 2021 and what went right in their second marriage.

Trey Hendrickson still waiting as Bengals’ contract offer fails to match market value

Bengals Star Trey Hendrickson SOUNDS OFF on Contract Status, Future in Cincinnati

Bengals defense needs Trey Hendrickson now more than ever



Trey Hendrickson has officially turned down a $28 million-per-year offer from the Cincinnati Bengals, intensifying his contract holdout and casting serious doubt over his future with the team. Despite leading the NFL in sacks last season, the star EDGE rusher remains unsigned long-term, fueling speculation that one of Cincinnati’s most dominant defenders could be on his way out in 2025.Trey Hendrickson isn’t just another pass rusher, he’s the most productive EDGE defender in the NFL over the last two seasons. After posting a league-leading 17 sacks in 2024 and a staggering total of 35 since 2023, Hendrickson has become the anchor of a Bengals defense that desperately needs his presence.Yet, despite his performance, the Bengals have reportedly offered just $28 million annually—a figure well below market value for a player of Hendrickson’s caliber. While the deal would place him eighth among NFL EDGE defenders in annual salary, it still falls short of what most believe he’s worth in today’s rising salary cap environment.According to NFL Network’s Tom Pelissero, Hendrickson isn’t demanding to surpass Myles Garrett’s record-setting $40 million AAV.Instead, he’s seeking multi-year security that reflects his elite status and long-term impact in Cincinnati.“He would like to get a multi-year deal that gives him security and keeps him in Cincinnati,” Pelissero stated on The Rich Eisen Show. “Bengals just have not stepped up with significant enough of an offer for him to take it.”The Bengals’ hesitation to lock in Trey Hendrickson is raising concerns—especially after their defense struggled during the 2024 season. With Joe Burrow returning healthy, Cincinnati is back in win-now mode. Losing their top defensive player could seriously hurt those chances.Also Read: Michael Penix Jr. takes over as Falcons’ starting QB; $27.5M Kirk Cousins moved to backup role To make matters worse, stars like T.J. Watt are also due for new deals, and market prices are rising. If the Bengals wait too long, they risk overpaying later or losing Hendrickson entirely. And if that happens, the Bengals may find out just how hard it is to replace a true game-changer off the edge.","Trey hendrickson has officially turned down a $28 million-per-year offer from the cincinnati bengals.

Details of the Investigation Surrounding Malik Beasley’s Gambling Allegations

Impact on Malik Beasley's Contract and Career

NBA’s Gambling Crackdown: Malik Beasley Faces Career-Threatening Investigation Amid League’s Betting Dilemma

is at the center of a major controversy that threatens both his lucrative future and his NBA career. Beasley, 28, is under federal investigation for alleged involvement in gambling activities tied to NBA games and prop bets during the 2023–24 season—a probe that has already paused his anticipated $42 million contract negotiations with the Pistons.The U.S. District Attorney’s office is currently investigating allegations that Malik Beasley placed wagers on NBA games—including player prop bets—during his time with the Milwaukee Bucks in the 2023–24 season. According to reports, at least one major U.S. sportsbook detected unusual betting activity tied to Beasley’s performance as early as January 2024, raising suspicions.However, as of now, Beasley has not been formally charged with any crime. His attorney, Steve Haney, has pushed back against premature judgment, stating, ""An investigation is not a charge. Malik is afforded the same right of the presumption of innocence as anyone else under the U.S. Constitution.""Meanwhile, the NBA has acknowledged its cooperation with federal authorities, with league spokesman Mike Bass confirming, ""We are cooperating with the federal prosecutors' investigation.""The situation remains fluid, but the case could have significant implications for both Beasley’s career and the league’s ongoing efforts to maintain integrity around gambling-related issues.The ongoing investigation into Malik Beasley’s alleged gambling activity has put a sudden halt to his contract negotiations with the Detroit Pistons. Prior to the probe, the two sides were in advanced talks on a three-year, $42 million deal—a reflection of Beasley’s strong 2023–24 campaign, where he averaged 16.3 points per game, his second-highest scoring output in his career.However, those discussions have now been paused indefinitely as the legal and league review plays out. The stakes are high for Beasley: if found guilty of violating the NBA’s stringent anti-gambling rules, he could face severe penalties, including a lengthy suspension or even a lifetime ban.Such an outcome would follow the precedent set by Jontay Porter, who was permanently expelled from the league in 2024 after an investigation revealed he had compromised games for betting purposes. As the situation unfolds, Beasley’s future in the NBA hangs in the balance, with both his career and reputation on the line.The NBA maintains a strict zero-tolerance policy against players gambling on league games, despite its lucrative partnerships with sports betting companies. This hardline stance was reinforced in 2024 when Jontay Porter was handed a lifetime ban—and later faced criminal charges—for his involvement in a betting scandal.Now, Malik Beasley finds himself under similar scrutiny, with investigators probing whether he wagered on NBA games, including player prop bets, during his time with the Milwaukee Bucks. The allegations have already derailed his pending three-year, $42 million deal with the Detroit Pistons, leaving his career in limbo.While Beasley is not the only player recently investigated—Miami Heat guard Terry Rozier also faced scrutiny over unusual betting activity, though without charges—his situation carries higher stakes. His legal team, led by attorney Steve Haney, has emphasized the presumption of innocence, but the shadow of Porter’s banishment looms large. If found guilty, Beasley could suffer the same fate: not only losing his NBA career but also forfeiting millions in earnings.Until the investigation concludes, the league, teams, and fans await answers—with the outcome set to send shockwaves through the NBA’s ongoing struggle to balance its embrace of legalized gambling with the integrity of the game.Also read: LeBron James Opts Into $52.6 Million Player Option, Will Return to the Los Angeles Lakers for 2025-26 Malik Beasley’s NBA career and financial future are in jeopardy as he faces a federal gambling probe.

After his record NHL season and $64 million deal, Sam Bennett and Zoe Zeleny restate their commitment to ‘Benny’s Buddies’

Big money and star power. Sam Bennett has come to a real inflection point by signing an eight-year, $64 million contract with the Florida Panthers that runs through the 2032-33 season, almost doubling his existing cap hit and marking his evolution to the franchise player. The Panthers are rejoicing since they are able to hold onto a playoff hero, but Bennett looks beyond 'hockey'. Together with fiancée Zoe Zeleny, he is already planning how to leverage this success for their off-ice cause, meaning his reach now extends way beyond the ice.This contract extension could not have been better timed. Fresh off his second straight Stanley Cup win and Conn Smythe Trophy, Bennett set pen to paper on an eight-year, $64 million contract extension. The Florida Panthers winger will now be taking home $8 million a year for his services until the 2032-33 season, vastly overshadowing his old cap hit of $4.425 million.Bennett's 2024-25 stat line was peak Bennett: 51 points; 25 goals, 26 assists, and seven power-play goals occur rarely. The playoffs, however, sealed his reputation. Performing in clutch moments, he set an NHL record by scoring 13 goals on the road and racking up 15 goals in total, earning him MVP honors.But off the ice, it was something very personal that defined what this contract was all about. On a recent Zoom call, he was wearing a ""Benny's Buddies"" cap, referring to the charitable foundation which he and his fiancée, Zoe Zeleny, started. The two started that program to help children and families in the local community, and this new deal will allow them to do so on a much bigger scale.According to Panthers TV reporter Katie Engleson, Bennett said, “That was one of the first things me and my fiance talked about. We get to continue Benny’s Buddies.” The quote not only speaks to the excitement surrounding the contract but also to the couple's commitment to turning professional success into action.Also Read: Rasmus Andersson trade buzz: Toronto Maple Leafs eyeing a $27 million veteran to fix defensive woes The $64 million contract for Bennett guarantees much more apart from just his tenure with the Panthers-the investment continues to hold a bit of the commitment Brennan and Zoe have retained for the community.

Jalen Williams on the insane female attention the NBA players get

Jalen Williams keeps focus on basketball

The Oklahoma City Thunder have won their maiden NBA championship, a victory that brings with it not only name, fame, and money — but also an increase in female attention. With million-dollar contracts and stardom reaching new heights, NBA players often find themselves vulnerable to situations that can go far beyond admiration. Some women go to extreme lengths, with a few even using the opportunity to deceive or exploit them. Jalen Williams, now a member of an NBA title-winning team, once opened up about this aspect of fame, speaking candidly about how players can be susceptible to the wrong kind of attention — and the consequences that may follow.In a 2023 appearance on the Don’t Trip We Got You podcast, Jalen Williams — popularly known as J-Dub — was asked if he had personally experienced any of those “crazy” situations involving women seeking the attention of NBA stars.“Me personally, no. I try and stay out the mix as far as… like girls… during the season,"" Williams responded.He said, ""I've seen some stuff just in general. Like I know girls be hanging out in the hallways and hotel rooms all the time and kind of do that just to see who they can get to come upstairs. They know your schedule and stuff, and you always get the random DMs like ‘fly me out.’”When the host pointed out that such attempts sometimes work, Williams explained why many young players fall into the trap.“You guys definitely see it, but like, that's the trap that I think a lot of—especially younger—guys fall into. You got girls at 2 a.m., 3 a.m., you’re already tired, you’re vulnerable. Just played a back-to-back. You might have had a good game. Then they’ll be at your hotel room like, ‘Take me upstairs, let’s go out to eat,’ blah blah blah,” he said.Williams called it “insane,” suggesting that such encounters have, at times, ended in theft or blackmail involving compromising photos. “There’s been all kinds of stuff. People get their wallets stolen, or they’ll take a picture of you while you’re asleep. So you always gotta be careful in that regard,” he added.Despite his rising popularity, Jalen Williams has kept his personal life extremely private. There have been no public confirmations of a relationship, and if he is dating someone, he's kept it well under wraps.As a result, the spotlight has remained firmly on his performance. In Game 7 of the NBA Finals, Williams scored 20 points along with four assists and four rebounds, becoming the second-highest contributor for the Oklahoma City Thunder behind Finals MVP Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. After the win, Alexander called Williams a “once-in-a-lifetime player” — and it seems he just might be right.","Jalen williams, a member of the oklahoma city thunder, opened up about female attention on a podcast.

Super Bowl fallout leaves Mahomes searching for his voice and form



Chiefs face cultural reset as leadership model comes into question



The Kansas City Chiefs’ 2024 season ended not just in defeat — but in disillusionment. A crushing loss to the Philadelphia Eagles in the Super Bowl didn’t just cost them a title, it fractured the image of invincibility around Patrick Mahomes. For years, Mahomes symbolized calm under pressure, football brilliance, and leadership. But this season’s finale exposed cracks in both the quarterback and the franchise’s identity.While Mahomes posted respectable numbers, the fire and fearlessness that once defined his game were missing when it mattered most. His throws lacked urgency, his body language reflected frustration, and his leadership seemed muted. Fans were stunned not just by the loss, but by Mahomes’ inability to rally the team when it mattered. For a player used to miracle moments, this ending felt eerily quiet.Behind closed doors, questions are swirling about Mahomes' mental fatigue and whether he’s burdened by the weight of his own myth. A former rival defensive end criticized his “emotional flatline” during crunch time, calling it a sign of pressure getting to him.The narrative isn’t just about poor play anymore — it’s about whether Mahomes has lost the edge that once terrified defenses. This shift is rippling through the locker room and the fanbase alike.This wasn’t just Mahomes’ loss — it was the Chiefs’ cultural reckoning. The team, once known for resilience and composure, looked shell-shocked against the Eagles. Internal sources suggest a lack of vocal leadership, waning morale, and strategic confusion throughout the postseason run. Now, management faces a critical decision: rebuild the team’s emotional foundation, or risk long-term damage to the franchise’s core.Also read: Russell Wilson’s NFL redemption tour begins in New York after Giants’ brutal season As the 2025 season looms, the pressure is now twofold — Mahomes must rediscover his identity, and the Chiefs must reignite a culture of belief. The talent remains, but the aura has cracked. Whether Mahomes bounces back as the fearless icon or fades into just another “what if” story will define Kansas City’s next era. The road to redemption has begun — but this time, it starts from within.","Chiefs face cultural reset as leadership model comes into question.

India’s Day 2 at the Nets in Edgbaston | IND vs ENG Test Series

Poll Do you think India is too reliant on Jasprit Bumrah? Yes, other bowlers need to step up No, he is our best bowler Partially, but he can handle the pressure

Kuldeep Yadav spins it tight at Edgbaston

Former India captain Mohammad Azharuddin has cautioned the team management against over-reliance on pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah and called for the inclusion of left-arm wrist spinner Kuldeep Yadav in the second Test against England at Edgbaston.India went down by five wickets in the first Test at Headingley, despite centuries from Shubman Gill, Rishabh Pant , KL Rahul and Yashasvi Jaiswal. However, the team faltered with repeated collapses and a bowling unit heavily dependent on Bumrah to both take wickets and control the run rate.“They are too much dependent on Bumrah. It’s not easy because you need more experienced bowlers, and they should play Kuldeep Yadav,” Azharuddin told PTI Videos, suggesting that the wrist-spinner’s inclusion could offer more control and variety.India will face England in the second Test starting July 2 in Birmingham. With conditions likely to favour spin later in the match, Azhar said picking the right bowling combination will be key to bouncing back from the Leeds defeat.“We lost because of the batting collapse, but now they have to pick the right players. Bowling has to be perfect,” he noted.Azhar also defended new Test captain Shubman Gill, who is leading India for the first time in a five-match series. “This is just his first match as captain. You can’t talk about captaincy so early. He should be given a fair chance, support, and time,” Azhar said.The former skipper, who led India in 47 Tests, stressed that patience is crucial. “We cannot just complain and criticise players like that,” he added.","Jasprit bumrah is india's best bowler, but other bowlers need to step up, says mohammad azharuddin.

India Add Spin Option Ahead of 2nd Test | All Eyes on Team Balance

June 29, 2024, will forever be remembered as the day India ended a 11-year wait for an ICC title, winning the T20 World Cup in a nerve-wracking final against South Africa in Barbados. Under Rohit Sharma ’s leadership, India clinched the crown with a narrow seven-run win, sealing a night of high drama and national celebration.One of the most-discussed moments from that epic final came during South Africa’s tense chase. With 30 runs needed off 30 balls, Rishabh Pant suddenly went down, signalling discomfort in his knee. Play stopped.At the time, it looked like a concerning injury, especially given Pant’s recovery from a life-threatening car accident in 2022.Now, a year later, Rohit Sharma has shared fresh insight into that moment, admitting he initially feared the worst.“See, Hardik has come to bowl there. So, we were discussing with Hardik what to do. I didn't know what had happened before. I genuinely thought that something had happened to him. The accident he had, I thought he was just trying to. But actually, it was just to stop the game a little bit. The momentum was with them.So, it was very important to break that. So, I think we went back to that. Eventually, Hardik dismissed Klaasen,” Rohit told Star Sports.Speaking earlier on The Great Indian Kapil Show, Rohit had revealed how Pant’s presence of mind helped India regroup: “When South Africa needed 30 runs off 30 balls, just before that, there was a small break. Pant used his intelligence to pause the game - he had a knee injury, so he had his knee taped, which helped slow down the game - because the game was fast-paced, and at that moment, all a batter wants is the ball to be bowled quickly.""But we had to break the rhythm. As I was setting the field and talking to bowlers, suddenly I saw Pant fallen on the ground. The physiotherapist had arrived and was taping his knee. Klassen was waiting for the match to start again. I am not saying it's the only reason, but it could be one of them - Pant Sahab used his smarts and things worked out in our favour.”India’s eventual win not only ended years of ICC heartbreak but also served as an emotional farewell for Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Ravindra Jadeja, and coach Rahul Dravid. One year on, Pant’s “injury” remains one of the most iconic—and debated—turning points of that unforgettable night.","Rishabh pant's injury break was a strategic move, says rohit sharma.

Dwyane Wade’s Praise for the Boston Celtics

Strategic Implications for Boston

Thehas drawn widespread attention across the NBA landscape, especially in light of Jayson Tatum’s ongoing Achilles recovery. Among the voices praising the move is Hall of Famer Dwyane Wade, who has publicly commended Boston’s boldness and strategic thinking during a period of crisis for the franchise.Jayson Tatum, the Boston Celtics ’ franchise cornerstone, suffered a devastating Achilles rupture during the 2025 Eastern Conference semifinals against the New York Knicks. The injury required surgery and has left Tatum sidelined for an extended period, with no clear timetable for his return. Team officials have stated that Tatum is progressing well, but they refuse to rush his recovery, prioritizing his long-term health over any short-term gains. Most projections rule him out for the majority, if not all, of the 2025-26 season.This injury couldn’t have come at a worse time for Boston. Tatum was at the peak of his powers, coming off an NBA title, an Olympic gold medal, and an All-NBA First Team selection. His absence has forced the Celtics’ front office to rethink their roster structure and competitive strategy for the foreseeable future.In response to Jayson Tatum’s injury and the need to avoid punitive luxury tax penalties, Boston Celtics president Brad Stevens executed a series of high-profile trades.Boston sent out Jrue Holiday and Kristaps Porziņģis, both key contributors to their 2024 championship, and in return acquired Anfernee Simons and Georges Niang—both on expiring contracts. These moves have already saved the Celtics close to $200 million in payroll and taxes.Simons, 26, arrives from Portland after averaging 19.3 points and 4.8 assists per game last season. He is widely regarded as a dynamic offensive talent, particularly from beyond the arc, where he has a career 38.1% three-point shooting percentage. While Simons is not known for his defense, his scoring prowess is expected to help fill the offensive void left by Tatum’s absence. Dwyane Wade , a respected NBA legend, has publicly praised the Boston Celtics for their aggressive approach in acquiring Simons during such a turbulent period. Wade highlighted several key aspects:- Boldness Amid Adversity: Wade admires the Boston Celtics’ willingness to make tough decisions and take risks, rather than settling for a passive rebuild in the wake of Jayson Tatum’s injury.- Roster Flexibility: By acquiring Simons and Niang on expiring contracts, Boston maintains flexibility for future moves, whether that means keeping Simons as a key scorer or leveraging him in another trade.- Competitive Spirit: Dwyane Wade emphasized that the Celtics, even without Tatum, have retained a playoff-caliber core, led by Finals MVP Jaylen Brown and Derrick White, and can remain competitive in an unpredictable Eastern Conference.The Simons trade signals Boston’s intent to remain relevant in the playoff race, rather than conceding a lost season. The Boston Celtics’ front office is balancing the need to stay under the luxury tax “second apron” with the imperative to field a competitive team. There is ongoing speculation that Simons could be flipped again if a “tempting deal” arises, but for now, his scoring is a critical asset.Meanwhile, the Celtics have made it clear they are not entertaining offers for Jaylen Brown or Derrick White, reaffirming their commitment to a competitive core. The franchise’s future direction will likely depend on Tatum’s recovery timeline and the team’s performance with Simons in a leading role.Also read: Boston Celtics star Jayson Tatum shares frustrating recovery update after Achilles injury - ""This is some bull***t!"" Dwyane Wade’s endorsement of the Anfernee Simons trade underscores the Boston Celtics’ determination to adapt and compete, even in the face of adversity.

Former India cricketer Sanjay Manjrekar has called for KL Rahul to demonstrate more consistency in Test cricket , particularly as he steps into a senior role following the retirements of Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma. Meanwhile, Rishabh Pant has strengthened his position in India's batting lineup by becoming only the second wicketkeeper in cricket history to score twin centuries in a Test match, following Andy Flower's feat.Being one of the most experienced players in India's relatively young batting order, Rahul is now expected to provide stability and leadership while delivering consistent performances with the bat.Pant's achievement of scoring two centuries in the Leeds Test has particularly impressed Manjrekar, who praised the wicketkeeper-batsman's dedication to the longer format of the game.""I think he will because it seems like he enjoys batting in Test cricket. Any batter who gets two hundreds in a Test match, it takes a lot out of you mentally, not so much physically, getting a hundred in the first innings, and 48 hours later, you have the same kind of reserve to get another hundred. So that is a hallmark of an exceptional player,"" Manjrekar said on Star Sports.Manjrekar emphasized that KL Rahul needs to avoid being known for stop-start performances and must maintain consistency throughout the series.""I see Pant carrying his form, but there is another senior batter in the team, who now has got no choice but to carry his form right through the series. Indian cricket needs him badly, and KL Rahul cannot be a one-hundred wonder or a one-Test-match performer,"" Manjrekar added.The spotlight is now firmly on Rahul, with increased expectations as he assumes the role of the senior-most batter in India's Test lineup. Pant's recent performance has set a high standard, demonstrating his ability to deliver consistently in the red-ball format.As the team undergoes transition, it will be up to the more experienced stars to steer the ship clear of obstacles and help the younger stars manoeuvre this transitional phase.","Former india cricketer sanjay manjrekar has called for kl rahul to demonstrate more consistency in test cricket.

And that’s how I sort of timed my retirement from India also,"" he had said.Unmukt’s numbers in the first two editions of the MLC, where he plays for Los Angeles Knight Riders (LAKR), were not good enough. In the first season, he managed only 68 runs in four outings, and in the following season, he scored 158 runs in six matches.However, in the 2025 MLC, Unmukt has found his rhythm. He is LAKR’s sole bright spot as the team is currently languishing at the bottom of the points table. With 243 runs in seven matches, Unmukt is currently placed sixth in the list of top run-getters.Will this be enough to get him into the US side? The 32-year-old definitely knows what he needs to do.""Whenever I have not got selected, performance was the only way you come back in. So I can only think along those lines,"" he said.""You know, as a cricketer, my lines are always very straight: I want to keep working hard, and keep improving my skills, and keep making sure that whenever I get the opportunity I go there and perform.""My only way to get back is to let my bat keep talking,"" he would say.LAKR have three games left this season and they are mathematically out of the playoffs race. But for Unmukt, these matches will be a chance to finish the season on a high in his quest for redemption.From being touted as a prodigious talent to trying to find his feet in a different country, it has been chaotic for Unmukt, but this is his only way to live his dream.""I have grown up with this mindset and mentality that I just want to keep getting better every day. The whole fight is with me. I want to be a better version of myself. That is something which has been a very strong fundamental thing inside my head,"" he said.""I feel that the journey is still ongoing. I still have a number of years left with me.

The Emotional Toll and Fan Reaction

The NBA world was stunned when the, their franchise cornerstone, to the Los Angeles Lakers in a late-night deal that many—including Doncic himself—considered both shocking and disrespectful. As details of the trade and its aftermath have emerged, it has become clear that the manner of Doncic’s exit and the subsequent public narrative have fueled his motivation this offseason like never before.“They have no idea… I worked my ass off to be here. So it’s kinda, I would say disrespectful, just sad that people say that,” Luka Doncic on criticism from the Mavericks’ front office. Luka Doncic’s departure from Dallas was not just a bold move—it was a historic event for the franchise and its fanbase. Despite five First-Team All-NBA selections in six seasons, a Western Conference Finals, and an NBA Finals appearance, Doncic was traded in a deal widely viewed as lacking in value and executed without his consent. The Mavericks’ front office, led by GM Nico Harrison, justified the move by questioning Doncic’s fit with the team’s culture, as well as his conditioning and work ethic.After the trade, a series of leaks and hit pieces emerged from the Mavericks’ organization, painting Doncic in a negative light.Reports suggested that his off-court habits and communication issues with the team’s medical staff were factors in the decision to move on from him. These narratives, particularly the public questioning of his work ethic, deeply stung Doncic. The Mavericks ’ handling of his exit and the subsequent criticism have become a driving force for Luka Doncic. According to ESPN’s Dave McMenamin, Doncic has committed to an intensive offseason training and nutrition program, determined to address every criticism leveled at him by his former team. People close to the Lakers have praised his focus and presence at optional workouts, noting that he has been a constant in the gym since the trade.Doncic himself has been vocal about how the Mavericks’ actions and words have motivated him:- Public Rebuke: Doncic has openly called the narrative about his work ethic “disrespectful,” emphasizing that his achievements were the result of relentless hard work, not luck or entitlement.- Personal Motivation: He has described the trade and the rumors as “a motive… for a long, long run here” with the Lakers, making it clear that he intends to prove his doubters wrong on the court.- Professional Approach: Rather than engage in a war of words, Doncic has let his performance speak for itself, delivering standout games against his former team and other top opponents.Doncic’s exit has left a lasting impact on Mavericks fans, many of whom are still reeling from the loss of a player who became the face of Dallas basketball. The organization’s attempts to erase his legacy—such as removing references to him—have only intensified the sense of disrespect and galvanized Doncic’s resolve to excel elsewhere.His first return to Dallas as a Laker was marked by high anticipation, with fans eager to show their appreciation and Doncic eager to make a statement against the team that let him go. The ongoing chants of “fire Nico” from Dallas fans reflect the widespread belief that the franchise mishandled the situation and underestimated Doncic’s value and commitment.As Doncic enters the offseason, his focus is sharper than ever. The disrespect he felt from the Mavericks has become a source of fuel, pushing him to new heights in his preparation and performance. With the Lakers, Doncic is determined to chase a championship and cement his legacy—not just as one of the league’s most talented players, but as one of its most resilient and motivated competitors.Also read: Dwyane Wade Applauds Celtics’ Bold Gamble as Anfernee Simons Trade Keeps Playoff Hopes Alive Amid Jayson Tatum’s Achilles Crisis The saga of Luka Doncic’s exit from Dallas and his response is a powerful reminder: for some athletes, disrespect is the ultimate motivator.

According to body language expert Judi James, their coordinated style and subtle affection hint at something deeper than celebrity chemistry: the belief that they may have truly found “the one.”Taylor Swift looked radiant in a flirty pale pink mini dress with gold buttons, while Travis Kelce kept it sleek in cropped black trousers, white socks, loafers, and a crisp white shirt. While this might seem like standard celebrity datewear, James sees it as far more intentional. “Taylor and Travis’s styling and their body language suggest something of a time-warp,” she noted, pointing to their classic prom-queen and king aesthetic.This wasn’t just a fashionable night out. James observed that Kelce’s wardrobe choices are starting to mirror Swift’s romantic style. “Travis's short-cropped black pants and white socks suggest he's gradually and happily style-twinning with her,” she said.But it was his subtle movements that said even more. “Travis sucks his lips in at one point to show he's taking the date very seriously and his large paw of a hand encases Taylor's hand in a clasp of macho protection. ”From their body positioning—Kelce confidently leading while Swift walked demurely behind—to the way she held her small handbag close, everything about their presence suggested a couple relishing that new, enchanted stage of romance. “Taylor's body language epitomizes 'demure' here, with her head lowered, her elbows pulled into her waist and that dinky little bag held in one hand,” James added.James believes this ""first-date college look"" may not be accidental. “It could be a desire to stoke the idyllic romantic side of their relationship or a mutual wish to present each other as 'The One', going back to a teen-date state to delete any high-profile and sometimes less than agreeable relationships they've each had with others in the past,” she explained.Also Read: Why Taylor Swift’s love life feels louder with Travis Kelce than it ever did with Joe Alwyn Swift has long built her brand on emotional storytelling, and this softer, sweeter public persona may be a reflection of a new, more intentional chapter.

Wild Aaron Rodgers Prediction | Steelers Big Offseason Decisions

Steelers face growing pressure after recent quarterback missteps

Aaron Rodgers is just a few practices into his Pittsburgh Steelers journey, but speculation about how long he’ll wear black and gold is already heating up. The four-time MVP has reportedly made a strong first impression—demonstrating leadership, organizing offseason workouts in Malibu, and setting the tone for a team eager to return to its former glory.Yet despite the promising start, one Steelers legend isn’t convinced Rodgers will last the season.Former Steelers linebacker and NFL Defensive Player of the Year James Harrison recently raised eyebrows with a bold prediction. Speaking on the future of the Rodgers-Steelers relationship, Harrison didn’t mince words: if the team struggles, he believes Rodgers’ time in Pittsburgh could end sooner than expected.“If Rodgers isn’t working out, and the Steelers aren’t winning, the distraction will be too much,” Harrison said, adding that the team might choose to “move on by the midway point.”This isn’t Harrison taking a personal shot at Rodgers—it’s coming from someone who has seen plenty of locker room drama during his time in Pittsburgh. His comments reflect a concern that Rodgers’ larger-than-life presence could become a liability if things go south.This isn’t the first time Pittsburgh has gambled on a new quarterback. After a string of underwhelming seasons post-Roethlisberger, the franchise has cycled through short-lived experiments at QB, none offering long-term stability.That history raises the stakes for Rodgers’ tenure even more.While head coach Mike Tomlin has not commented on any potential contingency plans, there’s no denying the expectations are sky-high—and the margin for error razor thin.If Rodgers performs like his old self, the Steelers could be contenders. But if the offense stumbles early, the pressure from fans, media, and even inside the building could force a radical decision.Rodgers may be the most accomplished quarterback the Steelers have had in years, but that won’t guarantee job security. As James Harrison made clear, “unless they’re winning, the Steelers-Rodgers relationship isn’t going to work out.”Also Read: ""A spoiled child"": Aaron Rodgers slammed as overrated and selfish in final NFL season amid Tom Brady comparisons For now, Rodgers is saying the right things and doing what leaders do. But in Pittsburgh, patience is running low—and only performance will determine whether his story ends in redemption or another high-profile exit.","James harrison warns aaron rodgers could become a distraction if the steelers aren’t winning.
