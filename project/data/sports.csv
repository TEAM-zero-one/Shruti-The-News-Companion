Julian Edelman’s Patriots Hall of Fame induction brings back emotional memories for Tom Brady

Tom Brady leans on friendships as he navigates post-retirement life and personal change

After a turbulent year marked by his retirement from the NFL and a very public breakup with supermodel Gisele Bündchen , Tom Brady is finding new reasons to smile—and this time, it’s not about football glory or career milestones. The legendary quarterback recently expressed heartfelt joy over the induction of his longtime friend and former teammate Julian Edelman into the New England Patriots Hall of Fame.Tom Brady and Julian Edelman share a bond that extends far beyond the gridiron. The two created one of the most iconic QB-WR duos in NFL history, helping the Patriots clinch three Super Bowl titles and countless unforgettable moments. Now, with Edelman being honored for his contribution to the franchise, Brady was quick to show his support with a brief yet meaningful message on social media: “You deserve it.”That simple tribute carried the weight of years of brotherhood, perseverance, and mutual respect. For Brady, the recognition of Edelman’s career also seems to represent something deeper—a welcome reminder of loyalty and friendship during a time of personal transformation.Tom Brady’s split from Gisele Bündchen after 13 years of marriage understandably shifted much of the media’s focus from his career achievements to his private life. As she has moved on publicly, Brady has been quietly adjusting to life after football and life without one of the most high-profile marriages in sports history.In moments like this—celebrating Edelman’s well-earned accolade—Brady appears to be drawing strength and joy from the unshakable bonds built during his playing days. These relationships, rooted in years of shared sacrifice and trust, seem to provide emotional grounding amid the transitions of retirement and personal reinvention.Brady has always been known for his intensity, discipline, and desire to win. But in this chapter of his life, it’s clear he also values legacy, connection, and loyalty just as much. Honoring Edelman isn’t just a nod to the past—it’s a sign that Brady is looking forward while cherishing the people who helped define his journey.Also Read: “Stop calling me someone’s ex”: Kayla Nicole moves beyond Travis Kelce’s shadow and the Taylor Swift narrative In a time when headlines often blur the personal and professional, Brady’s sincere appreciation for Edelman shows where his heart truly lies: with those who stood beside him through it all.Gisele Bündchen and Joaquim Valente are enjoying their new life after welcoming their baby. They have been spotted in Miami enjoying their time together and considering marriage. Rumors have not been confirmed, but Life & Style suggests that Gisele's ex-boyfriend Tom Brady may receive an invite if she marries her partner.

Shedeur Sanders picked off on Day 1, but Browns still see upside in rookie QB



The NFL dream has finally begun for Shedeur Sanders, as the former Colorado standout took the field in Berea, Ohio, for his first rookie minicamp with the Cleveland Browns . While the spotlight was bright and the expectations even brighter, Sanders' NFL debut was a mixture of rough starts and promising flashes.The very first pass Shedeur Sanders threw during team drills didn’t go according to plan.Under pressure from a free rusher, he attempted a play-action pass in the red zone, lofting the ball toward the left sideline—only to have it intercepted by a defender. A forgettable first impression? Perhaps. But for a quarterback known for his 74 percent completion rate in his final college season, this was less about mechanics and more about adjusting to the unforgiving speed of the NFL.Yet, Sanders didn’t let that early mistake define his day.Despite the shaky beginning, Sanders settled in and delivered a performance that revealed why the Browns were willing to bet on him, even after his surprising draft slide to the fifth round at No. 144 overall. Participating in various drills and 7-on-7 sessions, Sanders demonstrated his passing range—from sharp short throws to tight-window touchdowns.Browns insider Brad Stainbrook captured and shared glimpses of Sanders in action, highlighting two touchdown passes during scrimmage plays and several well-placed throws over defenders. Stainbrook later noted that Sanders “looked sharper than Dillon Gabriel,” the other quarterback in the rookie camp, who was selected by the Browns 94th overall.The quarterback competition is already becoming one of the more intriguing storylines of Cleveland’s offseason. Sanders and Gabriel, both entering the league with impressive college résumés, will have every opportunity to climb the depth chart. And while Gabriel got the first reps, Browns head coach Kevin Stefanski made it clear that nothing is set in stone. “I wouldn't look into anything,” Stefanski remarked. “I think you'll see the whole weekend, going through the spring. I mean, we don't pay too close attention to who is in there first.” When asked if the order would change, he simply replied, “I’ll see who.”For Sanders, Friday marked more than just his first practice—it was a statement of intent. Dressed in shorts, a jersey, and helmet—far from full NFL gear—he still managed to showcase glimpses of poise and precision that hint at his potential to grow under center.“This is only the beginning,” Stainbrook wrote. And for Shedeur Sanders, whose college career spanned from Jackson State to the bright lights of Colorado, this beginning may come with challenges—but also a chance to shape his legacy in Cleveland, one pass at a time.Also Read: Despite buzz, Aaron Rodgers not locked in with Steelers; retirement rumors keep gaining steam","Shedeur sanders took part in his first cleveland browns rookie minicamp on friday.

Fans react to Derek Carr’s retirement from the NFL after 11 seasons

Also read:

34-year-old New Orleans Saints quarterback Derek Carr retires after 11 seasons, the NFL announced on May 10 via their X account. A fan commented, “Are you surprised that Derek Carr decided to retire?” The reason for his retirement is a significant degenerative injury to the rotator cuff of the right shoulder.According to the official website of the New Orleans Saints, “In late March, while ramping up his preparation for the 2025 NFL season, Derek experienced pain in his right shoulder.It was his first time throwing a football at a significant volume since recovering from both a concussion and left-hand injury sustained during play on December 8, 2024. Derek immediately contacted the Saints Medical Team. Eventually, medical scans determined objectively that Derek sustained a labral tear and also had significant degenerative changes to his rotator cuff.”Since the shoulder injury, Derek Carr thought of a pathway to follow after consulting with his medical staff - surgery was an option but it would ruin his 2025 NFL season, and could not guarantee the kind of play he would have as a quarterback post-surgery.Derek Carr shared with the New Orleans Saints official website, “Upon reflection of prayer, and in discussion with Heather, I’ve decided to retire from the National Football League. For more than 11 years, we have been incredibly blessed, and we are forever grateful and humbled by this experience. It’s difficult to find the right words to express our thanks to all the teammates, coaches, management, ownership, team officials, and especially the fans who made this journey so special. Your unwavering support had meant the world to us.”NFL shared an X post with the caption: “Saints QB Derek Carr is retiring after 11 seasons. (via @rapsheet, @tompelissero, @mikegarafolo)”Fans reacted to it with varied emotions. Some expected it, while some did not see it coming.“The Saints future is looking ROUGH 👀”“Are you surprised that Derek Carr decided to retire?”“Doing this after free agency and the draft is nasty work. I love it 😂”“Just when we thought the Saints could have been competitive this upcoming season”“One of the best average QBs ever somehow”“Damn. Rough way to end it”“I’m pretty sure he retired about 2 years ago”“Wow.. his shoulder must be screwed like mine.”“Now he can ride of into the sunset with his millions of dollars“Felt like much longer, 11 seasons is an eternity in football days”“I’ll admit, Saints now have the worst QB room.”“Makes passing on Shedeur seem worse”“This is possibly the biggest surprise of the season”","34-year-old new orleans saints quarterback derek carr retires after 11 seasons.

Why Game 3 is a must-win for the Boston Celtics (May 10, 2025)

Can the Boston Celtics turn things around?

Theface a critical Game 3 against the New York Knicks at Madison Square Garden, trailing 0-2 in the Eastern Conference Semifinals. After squandering 20-point leads in both home games, the pressure is on. The biggest question looming over the matchup: Will Kristaps Porzingis be healthy enough to make an impact?Good news for Celtics fans - Kristaps Porzingis will play and start in Game 3.He has no official injury designation, but his recent performances reveal a player struggling with a lingering viral illness.- In Game 1, he played just 13 minutes and failed to score.- In Game 2, he logged 14 minutes and managed only 8 points before exiting.Adding to Boston’s challenges , forward Sam Hauser is listed as doubtful with an ankle injury. His absence hurts the Celtics’ wing depth and removes a key three-point threat off the bench.With Porzingis limited and Hauser likely out, Boston’s rotation will be tested. Mazzulla may need to rely more on small-ball lineups and extended minutes from Al Horford and Luke Kornet.History is not on Boston’s side. No NBA team has ever come back from a 0-3 deficit—teams in that spot are 0-159. The Celtics themselves nearly pulled off the impossible in 2023, rallying from 0-3 against the Miami Heat before falling in Game 7.Another loss tonight would put them on the brink of elimination. After blowing two big leads at home, they can’t afford another slip-up. Every possession matters, and the margin for error is gone.The Knicks are rolling, but Boston still has the talent to make this a series. If Kristaps Porzingis can give them even 20 productive minutes and the bench steps up without Hauser, they have a shot. If not, their season could effectively end tonight.Also read: Will Jaylen Brown play tonight against the New York Knicks?

The rise and rise of India, Royal Challengers Bengaluru star Virat Kohli

On multiple occasions during the Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Australia, Virat Kohli gave reminders to his Team India colleagues of how 'he is done' with Test cricket .It is understood that not many took it seriously at that time because it was an exhausting tour for the team where Kohli, too, didn't have a good time except a hundred early in the series. In nine outings, he could manage only 190 runs and 100 of those came in a single innings.Down Under, the right-hander struggled after the early high and was nowhere close to the high standards he had set in that part of the world.The next big assignment for the Indian team after the BGT was the Champions Trophy and the highs of the multi-nation tournament pushed the Test discussions back.However, well before the discussions for the England Test tour got underway, Kohli reached out to the Board of Control for Cricket in India BCCI ) and said he wanted to call it a day in the longest format. While it came as a surprise to the men who matter, who had him in the scheme of things at least for England, Kohli had made up his mind.Not just BCCI, even people, who have the best interests of Indian cricket at heart, outside of it want him on that flight to England but the ball seems to be in Kohli’s court now.It is worth noting that Kohli expressed desire to lead the side again but it wasn't entertained by the BCCI as they had an eye on the future, and wanted to groom a young leader for the new World Test Championship cycle. As TimesofIndia.com had reported, Shubman Gill was earmarked as the leader for the future as the Indian cricket board didn't want to look back as far as captaincy is concerned.""A new WTC cycle is starting. Future and continuity has to be kept in mind as far as the team is concerned. Even coach Gautam Gambhir would want a set of players he is likely to work with for an extended period. There can't be any stop-gap solutions for such an important series.

Explained: Why Rohit Sharma retired from Test cricket

Rohit Sharma’s last press conference as a captain

NEW DELHI: Rohit Sharma ’s decision to step away from Test cricket has sparked widespread debate, and former cricketer Sanjay Manjrekar didn’t hold back when weighing in.Taking to his official ‘X’ handle, Manjrekar pointed to Rohit’s recent slump and waning fitness as key reasons why the decision made sense.“164 in his last 15 innings. Out of which 10 were at home v Bangladesh & NZ.Average 10.9. With his current fitness levels… Rohit Sharma’s days as Test opener were over. So…” Manjrekar posted, summarising his view with stark clarity.Rohit, 38, officially announced his Test retirement on Wednesday via Instagram. In a brief but heartfelt note, he wrote, “It’s been an absolute honour to represent my country in whites. Thank you for all the love and support over the years.”His exit comes at a time when his place in the Test squad was under scrutiny. With a five-match Test series against England looming and reports of potential leadership changes within the BCCI, the timing of his decision seemed inevitable.While Rohit bows out from the longest format, he remains committed to white-ball cricket. After leading India to T20 World Cup glory in 2024 and retiring from the format, he confirmed that he will continue playing ODIs.Despite finishing with an impressive Test career tally of 4,301 runs, 12 centuries, and a highest score of 212, his recent form had noticeably dipped.In his final nine matches, Rohit averaged just 10.93 and even dropped himself during the Sydney Test of the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.Away from the pitch, Rohit also took aim at the current state of cricket commentary in India, calling it “disappointing” in a candid interview.ALSO READ: 'It is very disappointing': Rohit Sharma not happy with Indian commentary standards He criticised the shift in focus from the game to sensationalism, highlighting a growing disconnect between the media and cricket itself.As he moves on from the whites, Rohit’s legacy—especially in white-ball formats—remains firmly intact.",Rohit sharma announced his retirement from test cricket on wednesday.

‘Bombs Are Coming’: India-Pak Aerial Clash Sparks Panic During IPL; Chilling Video from Dharamsala

The Board of Control for Cricket in India has suspended the Indian Premier League , with 16 games remaining, due to escalating conflict between India and Pakistan, and England has emerged as a potential host for the final stages of the tournament. The BCCI will prioritise hosting the remaining matches in India if security concerns are resolved, but the England and Wales Cricket Board is open to discussions about hosting if approached.ECB chief executive Richard Gould confirmed England would be willing to step in if needed.“We will help our counterparts at the BCCI where we can,” he was quoted as saying by English media outlet Mail Online.The initial postponement is for a week , following consultations with the 10 franchises who expressed concerns about player safety, broadcaster views, and fan sentiments.Former England captain Michael Vaughan suggested completing the IPL in the UK before India's Test series against England begins on June 20.""I wonder if it's possible to finish the IPL in the UK,"" Vaughan wrote on X. ""We have all the venues and the Indian players can then stay on for the Test series… Just a thought?""The timing of the remaining matches presents a significant challenge. Hosting the tournament before India's Test tour would require quick agreements between the BCCI, ECB, and English venues, complicated by ongoing domestic cricket schedules.Another possibility is rescheduling IPL games for September during the Asia Cup window , which is unlikely to proceed.England's schedule includes South Africa white-ball series from September 2 to 14, suggesting the IPL could potentially resume in England afterward, utilising grounds not needed for the County Championship.A potential clash with England's three-match T20 tour of Ireland from September 17-21 is considered less problematic.Devajit Saikia, the BCCI's honorary secretary, confirmed the decision to suspended the league was made after consultation with franchises who ""conveyed the concern and sentiments of their players, and also the views of the broadcaster, sponsors and fans.""The BCCI released a strong statement of national solidarity: ""At this critical juncture, the BCCI stands firmly with the nation. We express our solidarity with the government of India, the armed forces and the people of our country. The Board salutes the bravery, courage, and selfless service of our armed forces, whose heroic efforts under Operation Sindoor continue to protect and inspire the nation, as they lead a resolute response to the recent terrorist attack and the unwarranted aggression by Pakistan's armed forces.""The statement continued: ""While cricket remains a national passion, there is nothing greater than the nation and its sovereignty, integrity, and security of our country. The BCCI remains firmly committed to support all efforts that safeguard India and will always align its decisions in the best interest of the nation.""",The indian premier league has been suspended due to security concerns.

A rising NHL defenseman with potential for the San Jose Sharks?



International success raises expectations but NHL transition remains uncertain for Hävelid



The San Jose Sharks are stirring up the NHL waters once again, making headlines with the announcement of their newest signing: defenseman Mattias Hävelid . At just 21 years old, Hävelid has been carving out a name for himself in Sweden, and now, he's making the leap to the NHL after penning a three-year, entry-level contract with the Sharks. But is this a masterstroke of scouting or another risky gamble by a franchise in need of serious revamping?Mattias Hävelid’s résumé is undeniably impressive for someone of his age.In his recent season with Linköping HC and Djurgårdens IF, Hävelid racked up solid numbers, finishing as one of the top contributors on the blue line. He logged 14 points, including two goals and 12 assists, for Djurgårdens, and helped lead them to a HockeyAllsvenskan Championship with an impactful postseason performance. His success at both ends of the rink in Sweden raises one burning question: Is he ready to translate this success into the NHL?Hävelid’s experience in the Swedish Hockey League (SHL) shows promise, with 43 games under his belt and a tally of 12 points. The defenseman’s offensive upside, combined with his ability to play both power play and penalty kill roles, makes him a versatile asset. But here’s the kicker: the SHL is not the NHL. The level of competition, the speed, and the physicality differ drastically. Hävelid’s size, standing at 5’10” and weighing 176 pounds, could also be a factor in whether he can withstand the grind of North American hockey, where larger, more aggressive players dominate.The Sharks have been rebuilding for some time now, and Hävelid's signing looks like part of that long-term plan. But this isn’t the first time San Jose has taken a shot on an international prospect who hasn't quite proven themselves on the big stage. Are the Sharks making the right bet, or is this just another misstep in their roster construction?Hävelid’s international experience with Sweden's U-18 and U-20 teams certainly suggests a bright future. He was instrumental in Sweden’s gold medal-winning campaign at the 2022 U-18 World Juniors, leading all defensemen in goals, assists, and points. His silver medal at the 2024 World Juniors, where he finished among the top contributors in assists and points, further elevates his profile.However, translating that international success into the NHL is no guarantee. The transition from junior hockey to the pros is a monumental one, and Hävelid's development will be heavily scrutinized over the next few seasons.Also Read: Oilers lean on depth and drama to snatch Game 2 from Vegas With the Sharks in need of a solid defenseman to build their future around, Hävelid may be their guy, if he can adjust to the league’s demands quickly.

India's probable Test squad for England Tour

Hours after TimesofIndia.com reported that star India batter Virat Kohli has reached out to the Board of Control for Cricket in India BCCI ) and said he wanted to call it a day in the longest format, the X handle of County Championship took a shot at the Indian legend, indicating that he is afraid of facing the England quicks in the upcoming five-match Test series, starting from June 20.In a ten second video posted on the X by the County Championship, the England speedster Gus Atkinson and Josh Tongue can be seen shattering the stumps in the ongoing four-day tournament in England.The post was quoted with the comment ""We don't blame you Virat.""In Border-Gavaskar Trophy held earlier this year, Virat Kohli could manage only 190 runs in nine innings and 100 of those came in a single knock at Perth.Down Under, the right-hander struggled after the early high and was nowhere close to the high standards he had set in that part of the world.It is worth noting that Kohli expressed desire to lead the side again but it wasn't entertained by the BCCI as they had an eye on the future, and wanted to groom a young leader for the new World Test Championship cycle."" - This sentence is grammatically correct.As TimesofIndia.com had reported, Shubman Gill was earmarked as the leader for the future as the Indian cricket board didn't want to look back as far as captaincy is concerned.Kohli, who made his Test debut in 2011, has represented India in 123 Tests, scoring 9230 runs at an average of 46.85.He also led India in 68 Tests, making him the country's most successful captain in the format. His intensity, fitness, and leadership transformed India into a dominant Test side both at home and overseas.With Rohit Sharma having recently retired from Test cricket, Kohli’s exit would leave the team without its two most experienced batters.

Jacob Fatu vs Damian Priest vs Drew McIntyre vs LA Knight



Becky Lynch vs Lyra Valkyria

Penta vs Dominik Mysterio

Pat McAfee vs Gunther

John Cena vs Randy Orton

WWE Backlash 2025 was a spectacular show that saw no title changes, amazing in-ring matches, a surprise debut and a controversial ending to the main event. WWE presented their latest Premium Live Event, Backlash, from the Enterprise Arena in St.Louis, Missouri. The event produced some remarkable matches, a former NJPW star making his debut, and John Cena once again using underhanded tactics to retain his WWE title after chaos erupted in the main event.This was the opening match, which was a Fatal 4-Way for Jacob Fatu's WWE United States Championship. The match went all over the ringside and showed carnage as all four superstars used everything to their advantage. Towards the end, heated rivals, Damian Priest and Drew McIntyre, took the fight in the crowd, and Priest delivered a South of Haven chokeslam from a raised platform. Back in the ring, Solo Sikoa appeared to save Jacob Fatu as LA Knight was about to put him through a table. Knight took out Solo, but was attacked by the surprise debut of Jeff Cobb. This led to Fatu to capitalize and hit the moonsault to pick up the win and retain his title.Lyra Valkyria defended her WWE Women's Intercontinental Championship against Becky Lynch. They engaged in a heated combat and delivered a spectacular match. Some spots saw Lynch beating Lyra in front of her fiancé, who was sitting in the front row, and The Man trying to use some underhanded tactics. However, Valkyria managed to roll up Lynch to score the pinfall and win. Right after that moment, Lynch lost it and laid a beatdown on her opponent before walking away.Dominik Mysterio defended his WWE Intercontinental Championship against Penta in a rematch from RAW. Both high-flyer superstars displayed an excellent showing in the ring. Penta fought the interference of all Judgment Day members who came to Mysterio's aid. In the end, Penta's rival, El Grande Americano, appeared and nailed him with the object in his mask. Dirty Dom hit the frogsplash and pinned Penta to win the match.Pat McAfee displayed an excellent effort against a much stronger Gunther in the match. However, the Ring General had dominated him towards the end, which led to Michael Cole leaving his commentary duties to come to his aid. Cole tried his best to assist McAfee, but Gunther managed to lock him in the sleeper hold and win the match. Following the bout, he showed a sign of respect to McAfee before leaving the ring.This was the headliner match for the Undisputed WWE Championship. Randy Orton had the hometown crowd on his side, while Cena went up against Orton with everything he had. The match saw fans erupting in a This is Awesome chant and saw massive chaos towards the end. Orton had multiple opportunities to pin Cena, but every time, a referee was taken out. Moreover, Orton also RKOed multiple WWE officials, including Nick Aldis, who came out to check on the referees. Just as he was about to punt kick Cena, R-Truth showed up to stop him and also ate an RKO. Cena utilized the opportunity to hit Orton with a low blow and hit him with the belt to retain his title.Also read: WWE Backlash 2025 results: John Cena successfully retains the WWE Undisputed title","Wwe presented their latest premium live event, backlash, from the enterprise arena in st.louis, missouri.

Why Derek Carr’s sudden retirement could shake up the Saints' future—for the better,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/why-derek-carrs-sudden-retirement-could-shake-up-the-saints-futurefor-the-better/articleshow/121071200.cms,"Derek Carr’s unexpected retirement could benefit the Saints by triggering a competitive quarterback battle and paving the way for offensive renewal.

Derek Carr’s exit opens unexpected door in Saints’ quarterback competition



The New Orleans Saints were thrown into disarray on Saturday morning when veteran quarterback Derek Carr unexpectedly announced his retirement from the NFL. What initially seemed like a strategic pause for potential relocation has now emerged as a pivotal moment in the franchise’s trajectory. And while Carr walking away from a $30 million paycheck raised eyebrows, it could ultimately serve as a much-needed reset button for a team caught in prolonged mediocrity.Derek Carr’s departure comes at a time when the Saints are juggling financial strain, an aging core, and limited quarterback prospects.The veteran QB made his decision after suffering a shoulder injury during off-season workouts, adding to a slew of issues including two concussions in one year, a non-throwing hand injury, and an oblique strain. Head coach Kellen Moore appreciated Carr’s transparency throughout the process, stating, “He did everything he could... he’s communicated extremely well. He’s worked really hard to get himself in position, and ultimately this was the outcome.”In his retirement statement, Carr expressed gratitude, saying, “For more than 11 years, we have been incredibly blessed, and we are forever grateful and humbled by this experience… Your unwavering support has meant the world to us.”Despite the sentimental tone of Carr’s farewell, the Saints now face a quarterback crisis that could paradoxically lead to their long-term salvation.With Carr out, New Orleans finds itself with a trio of young, untested quarterbacks—Jake Haener, Spencer Rattler, and Tyler Shough. These names, while promising on paper, don’t exactly strike fear into opponents' hearts. And as SI’s Conor Orr noted, “The reality is looking closer to the notion that the New Orleans Saints may have the most meager—on paper—quarterback situation in the league.”Head coach Kellen Moore is prepared to keep an open competition: “We’re going to let all three of these guys roll, and they’ve all earned these opportunities,” he said. But even Moore knows that without a proven leader under center, expectations for the upcoming season must be tempered.Rookie Tyler Shough seems ready to rise to the challenge, telling ESPN’s Katherine Terrell, “I think that’s all you can ask for is an opportunity… I’ve got to continue to grow and get better and do my best to elevate the quarterback room.”However, what this trio lacks in star power, they may offer in clarity: this is no longer a team pretending to compete in the short-term. The Saints have an opening to finally build with the future in mind.For years, New Orleans has been stuck in an awkward space—too competitive to land a top draft pick, yet not good enough to contend. Their aggressive cap strategies have kept the team in win-now mode since 2020, often to their own detriment. The result? A roster of veterans capable of frustrating wins without delivering real progress.Carr was, in many ways, a reflection of that identity—a competent but not transformative player who symbolized a franchise spinning its wheels. As Orr points out, “Carr’s retirement may end up being the best development that could have happened for the Saints.”With the Saints now poised to potentially finish with a record poor enough to secure a top pick in the 2025 NFL Draft, this could be the reset button they've long avoided. Orr even goes as far as to call Carr’s exit a “blessing in disguise,” suggesting that one truly bad season might be what the team needs to finally get back on track.And there's a silver lining already on the horizon. The offensive line, anchored by first-round talents like Taliese Fuaga, Trevor Penning, Kelvin Banks Jr., and Cesar Ruiz, alongside standout Erik McCoy, has the potential to grow into a dominant unit. This foundational strength can serve as the cornerstone of a rebuilt offense—one ready to welcome a true franchise quarterback when the time is right.For a team that hasn’t picked in the top three of the draft since selecting Reggie Bush in 2006, the chance to bottom out in 2025 could break the cycle of mediocrity. The Saints no longer need to chase fleeting playoff hopes or romanticize almost-trades for Patrick Mahomes. The future demands something bolder: a clean slate.Letting go of winning seasons, even meaningless ones, is painful for any fanbase—especially one that remembers the ‘Aints era all too well. But clinging to a mid-tier status quo has delivered diminishing returns. Carr’s retirement, voluntary or not, forces the organization to face its identity crisis head-on.Whether this was part of a strategic pivot by Carr or a genuine calling to step away, his absence opens the door for necessary change. The Saints now have an opportunity—perhaps their best in years—to finally escape quarterback purgatory and invest in a future that doesn’t just flirt with relevance but aims for sustained success.What begins as a season of uncertainty might just end up being the year New Orleans finally finds its path forward.Also Read: Gisele Bündchen and Joaquim Valente rumored to wed in Brazil—will Tom Brady be part of the guest list?","Derek carr’s retirement could benefit the saints by triggering a competitive quarterback battle and paving the way for offensive renewal.

Dubai police arrested several people involved in fights after a weekend soccer match between UAE Pro League clubs Shabab Al Ahli and Al Wasl in a rare disturbance in the tightly policed sheikhdom.Officers used surveillance footage to identify suspects, Maj Gen Abdullah Al Ghaith said in a statement Wednesday. Police didn't say how many people were arrested.Al Wasl won the match on Saturday 2-1. Angry Shabab Al Ahli fans threw water bottles at Al Wasl fans and on the soccer field, while Al Wasl fans lit smoke flares and hurled water bottles. Local media reported that fans threw stones, clashed outside the stadium and confronted Shabab Al Ahli defender Bogdan Planic as he made his way to the team bus before security guards intervened.The UAE Football Association on Tuesday demanded both soccer clubs pay fines over the fights and swearing.

MUMBAI: The suspension of IPL - India's most heavily insured sporting event - has brought renewed scrutiny to the utility and limits of event insurance amid geopolitical tensions.Howden, the insurance broker to the BCCI, acknowledged the suspension and said it would wait for an official decision on cancellation or rescheduling. ""Match cancellations are complex and dynamic, and speculating is not in the best interest,"" the firm said.IPL 2025 already saw a sharp rise in premiums following Rs 50 crore in weather-related claims last season. Reinsurance support dwindled, with just 20-30% of structured risks being transferred.The recent JioStar merger reshaped demand patterns, prompting broadcasters to reduce their coverage. While policies typically cover cancellation, adverse weather, unrest, and injuries, they are triggered only by outright cancellation or abandonment, not temporary suspensions - leaving policyholders exposed to short term halts.""For a claim to be triggered, the event should either get cancelled or abandoned. Currently, IPL has been suspended for a week owing to the current situation at the border. The organiser can always commence the event at a later stage once things normalise. A similar situation happened during Covid 2021, wherein IPL was suspended, and after a few months, it commenced and successfully concluded,"" said Amit Agarwal, CEO of Howden Broking The pressing question is whether insurers may treat the disruption as a war event. Most policies, except marine cargo, exclude war-related risks as they fall under force majeure - events deemed uninsurable. If applied, even routine claims, such as for travel cancellations, could be denied. Besides IPL, corporates are delaying product launches and conferences as international guests are avoiding them due to advisories.""Event cancellations in the current scenario should be treated as insured events until declared otherwise. Coverage can be broad on paper, including cancellations and suspensions,"" said Anup Dhingra, MD, FINPRO, IMEA. Rushik Patel of Edme Insurance Brokers said the key complication lies in the vagueness of war clauses.","Ipl 2025 already saw a sharp rise in premiums following rs 50 crore in weather-related claims last season.

How to play NYT Connections



Don't analyse the connections too deeply.

The game tends to employ simple links such as sounding similar, similar spellings, or common themes.

Example: ""dear"" and ""deer"" tend to be linked by sound, not by some elaborate relationship such as predator and prey.

You have only four guesses per puzzle per day, so every guess matters.

Don't mindlessly click—consider each set carefully before submitting.

Try to come up with at least three connected words confidently before trying a set.

The initial organization is deliberately mischievous to mislead you.

Shuffling the words may allow you to see new patterns or concealed connections.

Shuffle it as a routine to begin and whenever you are stuck.
