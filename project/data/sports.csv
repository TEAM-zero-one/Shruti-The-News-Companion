WHAT IS IYER’S INJURY?



WHAT HAS THE BCCI SAID?



NEW DELHI: Team India vice-captain Shreyas Iyer remains in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of a Sydney hospital as he continues to recover from the severe fall he suffered during the third ODI against Australia. Iyer, who took a stunning catch while running backward from point to dismiss Alex Carey, appeared to injure his left rib cage during the effort and was taken to the hospital shortly after returning to the dressing room on Saturday.It has been reliably learnt that Iyer’s body vitals dropped to dangerously low levels after the fall, prompting an emergency rush to the hospital in what was a life-threatening situation at that moment.The impact from the fall is believed to have split a body part just below the rib cage, resulting in severe internal bleeding. It is understood that Iyer was not in good condition inside the dressing room and was quickly rushed to the hospital after his blood pressure dropped alarmingly. Those aware of the developments said the situation “could have been touch and go,” but the BCCI medical team and support staff acted swiftly to ensure he received immediate medical care.Iyer is expected to remain in the ICU for at least two more days, though his stay could be extended if the bleeding doesn’t subside within the next 48 hours. Should there be no improvement, he is likely to remain under close observation for the coming week. As of now, it is considered certain that he will stay hospitalised for at least seven days.According to information accessed by TimesofIndia.com, Iyer may have suffered a splenic rupture, which led to internal bleeding.It is reliably learnt that the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) is speeding up the formalities to ensure someone from his family can be in Sydney at the earliest.It is not clear at this stage when that will happen.""Arrangements are being made by the BCCI. As of now, it is not clear whether both parents will go, but someone will be with him at the earliest in the hospital,"" says a source tracking developments.""As of now, Iyer's sister was supposed to travel to Australia, and even the paperwork has been initiated, but it could well be the case that one of the parents accompanies her,"" adds the source.In this delicate situation, the BCCI is keeping a close watch on the cricketer’s condition and keeping his family updated on every development.""Shreyas Iyer sustained an impact injury to his left lower rib cage region while fielding during the third ODI against Australia in Sydney on 25th October 2025. He was taken to the hospital for further evaluation,"" the BCCI said in an official statement.""Scans have revealed a laceration injury to the spleen. He is under treatment, medically stable, and recovering well. The BCCI Medical Team, in consultation with specialists in Sydney and India, is closely monitoring his injury status. The Indian Team Doctor will remain in Sydney with Shreyas to evaluate his day-to-day progress.""A ruptured spleen is a serious medical emergency that can lead to dangerous internal bleeding. Because the spleen is highly vascular and fragile, it’s one of the most vulnerable organs in the abdomen and can be easily damaged.The spleen, a soft, fist-sized organ in the upper left abdomen, filters and stores about a quarter of the body’s red blood cells and platelets while producing white blood cells to fight infections. Its delicate structure and thin outer capsule make it highly prone to injury from blunt trauma. A rupture can cause severe internal bleeding and demands immediate medical attention, often requiring surgery.Most splenic ruptures result from traumatic injuries, with car accidents accounting for nearly 50% to 75% of cases. Contact sports such as football and hockey also pose significant risks. In some cases, violent impacts like punches, stabbings, or gunshot wounds can cause the rupture. The spleen may tear immediately upon impact or later due to internal swelling from the injury.","Shreyas iyer remains in the icu of a sydney hospital as he continues to recover from the severe fall he suffered during the third odi against australia.

Who is Shane Bieber's wife Kara Bieber?



When Toronto Blue Jays ace Shane Bieber met his future wife, Kara, he didn’t exactly make a stylish first impression. The MLB star, who’s now battling for a World Series title against the Los Angeles Dodgers, once showed up to their first meeting in jeans and sandals. It was a fashion choice that earned him a quick roast from Kara. Years later, the couple laughs about it, but at the time, she wasn’t impressed at all.Before he became a World Series starter and a two-time All-Star, Shane Bieber was just another college alumnus back in town. During an alumni weekend at UC Santa Barbara, he met Kara through mutual friends. The connection was instant, but not without a little humor.In a candid chat with Paradise Valley City Lifestyle, Kara Bieber recalled the moment vividly. “It was alumni weekend, and Shane was back in town. We had mutual friends who introduced us and instantly hit it off. He showed up in jeans and sandals, and I remember thinking, ‘Wow, this guy needs a wardrobe update.’”That first impression didn’t last long. Beneath the casual outfit, Kara saw someone genuine and grounded. The pair began dating soon after and stayed together through Shane’s rise with the Cleveland Guardians before tying the knot in January 2023 at Hevadu Vineyard Estate in Malibu.In July of that same year, they celebrated their fifth anniversary as a couple.This year has been especially eventful for the couple. In March, they welcomed their first child, a son named Kav McClain. Just a few months later, Shane was traded to the Blue Jays in exchange for Khal Stephen, and now he finds himself pitching on the game’s biggest stage.Kara Maxine Bieber is much more than a baseball spouse. A Northern California native and former college athlete, she balanced basketball, volleyball, and even rodeo competitions during her time at UC Santa Barbara.After graduation, she channeled her competitive drive into entrepreneurship, founding Kara Maxine LLC, along with two thriving brands— Kinlike, a clothing label, and TELT Skincare, a wellness line known for its clean formulas.Kara is also open about her journey into motherhood, sharing heartfelt reflections online. “Kav McClain, you didn’t just enter our lives, you rewrote it,” she wrote on Instagram. “Every emotion, step I take and purpose I have is now altered in the very best way.”As her husband Shane dominates on the mound, Kara continues to build her own empire off it.Also Read: Shane Bieber clears years of confusion and confirms no relation to Justin Bieber after Toronto Blue Jays' World Series clash at Dodger Stadium","Kara bieber roasted shane bieber's wardrobe choices on their first date.

How Jannik Sinner can reclaim the World No. 1 ranking

In a stunning upset at the Paris Masters on Tuesday, World No. 1 Carlos Alcaraz lost to unseeded Cameron Norrie 4-6, 6-3, 6-4. The defeat opens the door for second-ranked Jannik Sinner to claim the top spot. The defeat to Norrie ended Alcaraz's impressive 17-match winning streak in Masters 1000 events.Alcaraz struggled throughout the match, making 54 unforced errors and winning only 64% of his first-serve points. The Spanish star's frustration was visible as he had an animated discussion with his coach Juan Carlos Ferrero after dropping the second set.""I'm really disappointed about my level,"" Alcaraz admitted after the match. ""I didn't feel well today. A lot of mistakes.""For Norrie, the victory marked his first career win against a top-ranked player. He sealed the match on his second match point when Alcaraz returned his powerful first serve long. This was their first indoor meeting, with Norrie now leading their head-to-head record 3-5.The loss comes as a surprise given Alcaraz's impressive 2025 season, during which he claimed eight titles, including three Masters tournaments and two Grand Slams - the French Open and US Open.Sinner now has a clear path to the number one ranking. He needs to win the Paris Masters to overtake Alcaraz's 11,250 points.Currently at 10,510 points, Sinner will gain points with each win - reaching 11,500 if he claims the title.The Italian star enters the tournament in good form, riding a 21-match winning streak on indoor hard courts. His last indoor defeat came against Novak Djokovic in the 2023 ATP Finals final. However, his past performance at the Paris Masters has been modest, with just one match win in three previous appearances.The battle for the top spot will continue beyond Paris, with both players facing different challenges at the upcoming ATP Finals, where Sinner defends 1,500 points compared to Alcaraz's 200 points.","World no. 1 carlos alcaraz loses to cameron norrie at the paris masters.

Draymond Green sparks chaos with flagrant foul against Memphis Grizzlies

Draymond Green fouls out but leaves a big impact on the Golden State Warriors win

The Golden State Warriors forward Draymond Green was once again caught in the middle of controversy during their 131-118 win over the Memphis Grizzlies on Monday. The veteran committed a flagrant-1 foul on Grizzlies center Santi Aldama in the third quarter after pulling him down by the neck during a fast-break play. Despite the heated exchange that followed, Green managed to stay in the game and played a key role in the Warriors’ victory.The incident took place when Draymond Green lost control of the ball near midcourt. Santi Aldama grabbed the loose ball and ran toward the basket for a layup. As the Spaniard went up, Green grabbed him by the neck and dragged him to the floor.Jaren Jackson Jr. quickly rushed to his teammate’s aid and exchanged words with the Golden State Warriors forward. Green, unfazed, shouted back, “SHUT UP! SHUT UP! SHUT UP! SHUT THE F**K UP! SHUT UP.”The replay later showed that Green appeared to hold Aldama to prevent a hard fall and potential injury. Still, Aldama stayed on the ground, holding his neck in pain. Green didn’t stop there, and called the Grizzlies player “soft as f**k.”Despite the foul, referees ruled it as a flagrant-1, allowing Green to remain in the game. When Aldama missed both free throws, Green mocked him by galloping down the court and staring at him.The Warriors used their winning momentum beautifully to dominate the third quarter 36-24, with Green contributing five rebounds and two assists. He also helped limit Jackson Jr. to just 16 points.Draymond Green fouled out in the fourth quarter after colliding with Jaren Jackson Jr. with 7:32 remaining. Coach Steve Kerr challenged the call, but it was upheld. The 2017 Defensive Player of the Year exited the game with seven points, 10 rebounds, four assists, and one steal.His impact, however, went beyond the box score. Green was a beast on both ends, organizing the offense and anchoring the defense. He also finished with a game-high +18 net rating.With this win, the Golden State Warriors have already registered 3 wins in 4 matches.

NFL season’s Week 7 matchup between the Washington Commanders and the Dallas Cowboys witnessed star quarterback Jayden Daniels get hurt. He suffered a hamstring injury that had him leave in the third quarter and never return. His mother, Regina Jackson, immediately tweeted, “I wish you would stop manifesting RGIII on my son. Words are powerful and that’s all that’s talked about🙏🙏.” This takes us back to Daniels’ interview with Boardroom about his mother, where he said, “Nothing gets past my Mama.”Back in December 2024, in a cover story for Boardroom titled “Commander in Chief Jayden Daniels, The Ultimate Co-Sign—Q & A with Travis Scott and Kevin Durant,” NBA legend Durant asked Daniels, “One of the most important things for me in my career was learning to surround myself with the right people off the court and start building my business team so I could do stuff like create Boardroom. How are you approaching building your team, and how do you ensure you do so while staying locked in on football?”The Commanders quarterback replied, “The biggest thing to putting the right people around me…obviously, nothing gets past my mama. That’s the biggest thing. She reads people, and she doesn’t wanna put people around me that she doesn’t feel will benefit me at the end of the day.”The second-year signal caller further elaborated, “So that’s kind of the biggest thing, but staying close to my family, keeping my circle tight, like I’m always around my family, my cousins, even my boys that have known me ever since before I got here and along the way, people that I became close with on my team or in college—be able to keep that tight knit group of guys that really feel have that same mindset and goals as me on and off the field, so that we’re able to grow with each other.Daniels also talked about his mother’s dedication towards his games, “For her to show up at every game, whether it’s sunny, hot, rainy, or cold? She’ll throw on three or four coats and be cheering no matter what, making sure that I’m my best and taking as much off my plate as possible.”","Washington commanders quarterback jayden daniels suffered a hamstring injury against the dallas cowboys.

The Golden State Warriors and Los Angeles Clippers square off on October 28, 2025, in a regular-season clash that promises intensity, star power, and strategic drama. While fans can expect a high-energy contest between two of the Western Conference’s top contenders, both teams are dealing with significant injury setbacks that could reshape the dynamics on the floor.The Los Angeles Clippers enter the game short-handed, with three players unavailable for selection. Newly signed guard Bradley Beal continues to sit out due to persistent back soreness, missing his second straight contest. His ongoing absence has raised concerns about his long-term durability as the season unfolds. In Beal’s stead, the offensive burden will fall primarily on James Harden and Kawhi Leonard, who have already shown their ability to lead the charge in high-pressure situations.Rookie guard Kobe Sanders remains sidelined with a right knee sprain, while Jordan Miller is recovering from a left hamstring strain. Both players are expected to miss this matchup but could return later in the week if their rehabilitation progresses as planned.• Out: Bradley Beal (Back – soreness)• Out: Kobe Sanders (Right knee – sprain)• Out: Jordan Miller (Left hamstring – strain)The Golden State Warriors are also managing several injuries but will have their key stars ready to go.Forward Alex Toohey remains out with a knee injury after missing the previous game against the Memphis Grizzlies. His status for future contests depends on upcoming medical evaluations.Veteran center Al Horford, who joined the Golden State Warriors for his defensive presence and leadership, is dealing with a toe injury and is listed as day-to-day. The team is closely monitoring his status given the physical challenge presented by the Clippers’ frontcourt. Guard De’Anthony Melton continues his recovery from a knee injury and will be re-evaluated closer to the end of the week.• Out: Alex Toohey (Knee – injury)• Out: Al Horford (Toe – injury, day-to-day)• Out: De’Anthony Melton (Knee – injury)The Los Angeles Clippers will look to Bojan Bogdanović to play an expanded role alongside their superstars. In their most recent victory, Harden and Leonard combined for an impressive 50 points and 23 assists, setting the tone for their offense. Bogdanović’s scoring versatility, combined with the athleticism of Derrick Jones Jr. and the interior presence of Ivica Zubac, gives Los Angeles a strong mix of experience and adaptability. Kris Dunn will also play an important role on both ends, particularly in backcourt defense.For the Warriors, young talents Jonathan Kuminga and Moses Moody have taken full advantage of early-season opportunities.

The Los Angeles Clippers began the season with a blast, but only briefly. The management recently announced that Bradley Beal will be on the sidelines Tuesday night when the Clippers host the Golden State Warriors. He also missed Sunday's game against the Portland Trail Blazers. All this is happening due to his back soreness. Bradley Beal was labelled as ""OUT"" for Tuesday night's game against Stephen Curry, Jimmy Butler, and the Warriors on the Clippers' injury report. Before being declared out, Beal was listed as ""QUESTIONABLE"" to play on Sunday night.According to insiders, Beal was hurt on a defensive play during Friday night's Clippers' home opener against the Phoenix Suns. They further said:“He took that charge and it kind of gave him some back spasms.”In 20 minutes in a game, he averages 5.5 points while shooting 45% from the field and 25% from beyond the arc. The Clippers are hoping that this most recent setback won't interfere with Beal's performance for a long time. Due to a number of health issues, the experienced guard has only played in 196 of the 328 regular-season games since the 2021–22 season.This past offseason, Los Angeles signed Beal to a two-year, $11 million contract.The Clippers, who are now the oldest team in the NBA, are anticipated to exercise caution in 2025–2026 as they monitor the health of their veteran-heavy squad. When Los Angeles plays the New Orleans Pelicans on Friday, Beal will have another chance to make a comeback.Beal's back injury will keep him out of his season opener. Bogdan Bogdanovic will take Beal's place in the starting lineup. Beal also missed Sunday night's win over the Portland Trail Blazers for the second consecutive game.His last appearance was on Friday, when the Clippers beat the Phoenix Suns . This time Beal is taking complete rest. This probably means that perhaps the team might prefer Beal to rest at home and the Clippers play without him.This season, the Clippers are trying to balance everything. Without Beal, the team has to tread lightly between keeping his health intact and still attempting to play successfully. His injury affects the team's overall chemistry and on-court philosophy as well as his own game.Beal has averaged 21.5 points, 4.0 rebounds, 4.3 assists, and 1.1 steals per game while shooting 46.4 percent from the field and 37.6 percent from three throughout his 14-year, 803-game NBA career. Beal seemed to have lost some of his spark over a few losing seasons with the Phoenix Suns, but the Clippers are gradually integrating him into what they want to achieve.Also read: Jayson Tatum debuts new hairstyle at Bradley Beal’s recent wedding pictures while pushing through Achilles rehab","Bradley beal will miss tuesday night's game against the golden state warriors.

The New Orleans Saints are making a bold quarterback change after their 23-3 loss to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in Week 8. Rookie Tyler Shough will now take over the starting job from Spencer Rattler, as head coach Kellen Moore shifts direction to evaluate the team’s long-term future under center.The decision comes after Rattler started the first eight games of the season, posting 1,586 passing yards, eight touchdowns, and five interceptions. While not disastrous, his performances lacked the consistency and explosiveness needed to elevate the Saints’ struggling offense. Moore made the switch during Sunday’s game, inserting Shough for his first NFL action.Shough completed 17 of 30 passes for 128 yards with one interception, adding 12 rushing yards on three attempts. The second-round pick showed poise and mobility, enough for the Saints’ coaching staff to hand him the reins moving forward. According to NFL Network insider Ian Rapoport, Moore informed the quarterbacks that the “Saints making rookie QB Tyler Shough their starter,” signaling the franchise’s commitment to evaluating Shough’s potential immediately.Shough’s first start won’t come easy. He will face the Los Angeles Rams’ high-pressure defensive front in Week 9 — a difficult matchup for any rookie quarterback making his debut as a starter.With a Week 11 bye ahead, Shough will have two opportunities to prove he belongs before a break allows the Saints to recalibrate and fine-tune the offense around him. The timing makes this a critical evaluation window.New Orleans currently projects to hold the No. 1 pick in the 2026 NFL Draft, which puts the team in a franchise-defining position. If Shough performs well over the next several games, the Saints may not need to draft another quarterback. Instead, they could flip that top pick for a blockbuster return and rebuild faster.Tyler Shough’s first official NFL start marks a crucial turning point for the New Orleans Saints — a move that could determine the future of the franchise and reshape their quarterback room for years to come.Also Read: Michael Strahan reacts hilariously after Halloween prank hits live broadcast on Fox NFL, Charissa Thompson responds with “Sorry”","New orleans saints coach kellen moore benched starting quarterback spencer rattler on sunday.

Toronto Maple Leafs forward William Nylander’s status remains unclear and is in question for the team ahead of their match against the Calgary Flames. This is the second consecutive game against Calgary, which will be hosted at the Scotiabank Arena. According to the Maple Leafs, Nylander will be a game-time decision for the Toronto Maple Leafs, and this is due to the major injury that the player has sustained recently. Let’s find out if Nylander is fit to play against the Calgary Flames or if he still needs time to recover. Maple Leafs right winger William Nylander ’s status remains unclear ahead of the team’s second game against the Calgary Flames, which is set to be played at the Scotiabank Arena on Tuesday. As per the team, they are preparing for a pivotal clash with the Calgary Flames, with Nylander once again a game-time decision for the second straight game.Previously, Nylander left Friday’s 5-3 setback to the Buffalo Sabres at KeyBank Center with a lower-body injury. The player did not return to the ice for the warm-up and remains in doubt for Tuesday’s game, too.Reports suggest that Nylander took part in the morning skate for the return match on Saturday but was held out despite taking line rushes.He took part in a full practice on Monday, but Maple Leafs head coach Craig Berube said they would see how he feels in the morning. Meanwhile, a game-time decision assessment was given again on Tuesday to check his health status.Speaking to Craig Berube regarding Nylander’s return, the head coach stated, “I think it depends on a couple of things,” Berube said. “I really don't want to get too detailed into it, but there's a couple of areas where he needs to feel right.”Berube further continued, “It's hard for him to know until it's game time out in the warm-up, and how he feels and how he's doing certain things. That's the decision that's going to be made.”As the Leafs are bracing for the possibility of Nylander’s absence in the upcoming match against the Calgary Flames, the team is currently busy finding his replacement for the clash. Sources claimed that Sammy Blais could have a potential debut. After being claimed off waivers before the season started, Blais could make his Leafs debut in the club’s 10th game of the regular season.Berube also dropped a hint at his possible appearance in the game, stating, “He's a physical player. He likes to throw his body around on the forecheck,” Berube said of Blais. “And from the past that I had Sammy, he's got really good hands. He's good and tight with the puck and can do pretty incredible things.”Additionally, he might be a choice for the team as Berube coached Sammy Blais during the St. Louis Blues’ 2019 Stanley Cup run and a couple of years afterward.","Toronto maple leafs forward william nylander’s status remains unclear and is in question for the team ahead of their match against the calgary flames.

How did Alex Tuch characterize the Buffalo Sabres’ unforeseen resurrection?

Watch All Of Alex Tuch's 36 Goals From The 2024-25 Buffalo Sabres Season | Goal Highlights

What makes Tage Thompson sure this team is ready to compete?

The Buffalo Sabres have come alive, and this time the trust is genuine. After a difficult beginning of the season, Buffalo has managed to climb into the Eastern Conference wild-card battle, proving that sometimes the soul can be stronger than the past. Though for years optimism has been far and few between in upstate New York, the Sabres’ revival with powerhouses like Tuch and Thompson has cast a dream shadow over the fans — even if it still feels like a bit too early for the hope.Not too long ago, the Sabres were in such a bad space that after three defeats in a row and just two goals scored, many had already written them off for a season to be forgotten. However, Alex Tuch, when asked about the situation, remarked that it was a rapid transformation. “Our compete has been through the roof, honestly, since Day 1,” he said. “We're starting to find our scoring touch here. Everyone is chipping in, everyone is producing. ”Buffalo went off the charts in its offense, scoring eight against Ottawa and then freezing the defending champ Florida Panthers. They even matched the Maple's strength, winning and losing in one home-and-home series, respectively, and even getting three out of four points.It’s not flawless — but it’s a sign of something good.Tage Thompson thinks this is not a coincidence — it’s development. “Every single game we've played this season, we've been right there,” he stated. “Sometimes it just comes down to bad puck luck, sometimes it's self-inflicted with our puck decisions.”The power play of Buffalo is very much the main story. The once 24th-ranked unit has now made it to the list of top 10 in the league and is flourishing with a very simple philosophy — shoot more and think less. Thompson even said, “When we keep it simple and shoot and get to the net is when we get their PK spinning a bit, and that's when we've had success.”The Atlantic Division might still be very strong, but the stumbling of typical giants such as Tampa Bay and Toronto has led to the opening of a window. Whether the Sabres will actually be able to take advantage of it is not clear yet, but what is certain is that this particular team has decided to stop playing scared. Belief on the ice is back for Buffalo.Also Read: Brad Marchand shines at 37, but the Florida Panthers need more support","The buffalo sabres have come alive, and this time the trust is genuine.

Jaxson Dart brings smiles as Superman at children’s hospital



Real heroes wear courage, not jerseys, always



Quarterbacks are often celebrated for their touchdowns and trophies, Jaxson Dart just earned applause for something far greater—his heart. The New York Giants’ rising star turned a simple Halloween visit into a moment of pure magic when he showed up at a local children’s hospital dressed as Superman. What followed was not just about costumes or candy, but about connection, courage, and the kind of heroism that doesn’t need a football field.The visit became an instant internet favorite after a young boy named Giuseppe shared the moment on his Instagram account, Giuseppe Strong. Dart, the Giants’ rookie sensation and former Ole Miss standout, was seen hugging Giuseppe in a heart-melting scene that quickly went viral. The caption described it as part of the hospital’s trick-or-treating fun, but the emotions behind it went far deeper.Giuseppe recognized Dart right away, his face lighting up as the quarterback flashed his million-dollar smile. The post drew thousands of reactions, including one that stood out from a Philadelphia Eagles fan who commented, “As an eagles fan, I love this guy.” When even rival fans are showing love, you know the moment has struck a chord.The NFL world has recently seen more of these acts of humanity. After Cam Skattebo’s season-ending ankle injury against the Eagles, their head of security, Dom DiSandro—affectionately called Big Dom—brought cheesesteaks and pizzas from Angelo’s to the hospital where the Giants’ star was recovering. It showed that compassion easily transcends rivalries.Giants backup quarterback Russell Wilson, who often visits children’s hospitals himself, once learned he was being benched for Dart during one such visit. It’s fitting, because players like Dart and Wilson seem to understand that perspective better than most.Seeing children like Giuseppe—brave, cheerful, and full of hope—reminds even the toughest athletes what real strength looks like. Sports may give us heroes on the field, but moments like these remind us who the true champions are.As Giuseppe’s post perfectly captured, Dart gave him “the best time” trick-or-treating. And perhaps without realizing it, the young quarterback reminded everyone that sometimes, being a superhero simply means showing up with kindness.Also Read: NFL trade deadline drama: Eagles’ AJ Brown at center of massive insider update and speculation","Jaxson dart, the new york giants' rookie sensation, visited a local children's hospital dressed as superman.
