Gautam Gambhir Press Conference: Team India head coach heaves fire after 2-1 ODI series win over SA

NEW DELHI: India head coach Gautam Gambhir is under increasing scrutiny after consecutive home Test series defeats, despite enjoying early success with India’s Champions Trophy and Asia Cup wins since taking charge in July last year. The team’s struggles in red-ball cricket — including a 3-0 loss to New Zealand followed by a 2-0 defeat against South Africa — have raised alarms, especially as India have been whitewashed in a home Test series only three times in history, with two of those coming during Gambhir’s stint.However, former India head coach Ravi Shastri believes criticism should not be directed at just one individual. Speaking on Prabhat Khabar’s YouTube podcast, he urged a broader view of accountability.""So when results come, one thing the public should remember is that players should also take responsibility. It should not be that you target one individual. It has happened to me, that is why I am speaking from experience. So it is important that the players also take the rap on the knuckles when something like this happens. There should be pride. They should feel hurt that we have lost. Until that happens, things will not move forward,"" he said.""Har match jitna hai. Nahi jitega to bandook tumhari taraf. Agar ye mere saath hota to mai pehle responsibility leta. Wo pride hona chaiye. Hurt hona chaiye ki hum haare hain. Pressure sabko aata hai. Jhelna padta hai. Cricket is 90 percent here in the mind [We have to win every match. If we don’t win, the gun will point at you. If this had happened with me, I would have taken responsibility first. There should be pride. You should feel hurt that we have lost. Everyone feels pressure. You have to deal with it. Cricket is 90 percent here — in the mind],"" Shastri said.Shastri also highlighted the importance of leadership qualities beyond tactics.""If your performance is poor, you could be fired. Therefore, you need to maintain patience. Communication and man-management skills are crucial here. Only then can you motivate the players to win. And that's what we did. The most important thing is to enjoy whatever you do. Don't take it as pressure,"" he explained.Drawing from his time overseeing India’s dominant Test period between 2014 and 2021, Shastri stressed that defeats should be viewed collectively.Watch the video here ""Everyone, right from the team management to the players, you can't single out one person. It's a collective decision. South Africa defeated India; no single player defeated India. South Africa played well as a team. Where did we play?"" he questioned.While he avoided directly criticising Gambhir, Shastri reiterated shared accountability for the recent slump.India’s first-ever home Test whitewash took place in 1999–2000, also against South Africa — a reminder of how rare such setbacks have been.",Gautam gambhir under increasing scrutiny after consecutive home test series defeats.

(Images via Twitter)

Viral clip of Shedeur Sanders becomes the main story as fans and people debate the “thong” moment

Equipment experts confirm Shedeur Sanders was wearing a standard NFL jockstrap during the Titans game

Shedeur Sanders delivers a four touchdown performance while the Browns lose and the discourse derails completely

Shedeur Sanders became the center of the NFL’s strangest viral moment on Monday Night Football after a broadcast replay caught the Cleveland Browns rookie in an unplanned wardrobe slip. The clip spread across social platforms within minutes and sparked a full internet spiral about what he was wearing under his uniform.Shedeur Sanders threw four total touchdowns in the 31-29 loss to the Tennessee Titans, but the conversation moved away from his production and focused on a two second shot that fans turned into a meme factory. Social media pushed one question louder than anything that happened in the game itself, and the fallout has fully overshadowed his stat line.The moment happened in the fourth quarter when Tennessee Titans defensive tackle T’Vondre Sweat dragged Shedeur Sanders down near the goal line. His uniform pants shifted as he hit the turf. The back strap of his underwear appeared on the broadcast camera. The exposure lasted less than two seconds, but the replay angle captured it clearly enough for the internet to screen grab, zoom, repost, and stitch it across every platform available.Within minutes, clips on X, TikTok, and Reddit labeled the angle as evidence that he was wearing a thong. One viral reaction read, “BRO, was Shedeur Sanders wearing a thong?” Another user added, “Please tell me we don’t have Watson 2.0 lol.” A third post joked, “The thing gonna thong,” which quickly became the unofficial tagline of the moment. Fans kept uploading slow motion edits and cropped zooms, treating the frame like a detective assignment.TPS amplified the conversation by highlighting screenshots where fans wrote, ""Bro is Shedeur Sanders wearing a thong???😭😭😭😭😭"" and ""Is Shedeur Sanders wearing a thong🤣.""Amid the internet frenzy, reporters and equipment specialists stepped in with the actual explanation. The visible strap was part of a standard athletic jockstrap, not lingerie. The gear has been common across contact sports for decades. It has an elastic waistband, a protective front pouch, and two straps that run under the buttocks. Those straps leave part of the area uncovered to prevent bulk under pads and allow mobility.High definition replays made the strap look similar to a thong. That optical confusion sustained the jokes even after multiple journalists clarified the equipment. Many fans admitted they had never seen what a jockstrap looks like when a player falls at a certain angle. One viewer responded with a simple line that summed up the tone of the discourse: “That is very weird.”The misunderstanding did not fade overnight. The clip kept circulating the next morning and remained one of the most shared NFL moments of the day even though it had nothing to do with gameplay.Shedeur Sanders threw for 364 yards, three passing touchdowns, and added his first NFL rushing touchdown in the game. He pushed the Cleveland Browns back into contention late in the fourth quarter. The team trailed 31-17 when he scrambled for a seven yard score. He later led an 80 yard touchdown drive to cut the Tennessee Titans lead to two points.Cleveland faced a potential game tying moment with a two point conversion. The Browns removed Shedeur Sanders from the field and ran a direct snap to running back Quinshon Judkins. The play failed. The Titans secured the 31-29 win and improved to 2-11. The Browns fell to 3-10, and both teams remained out of playoff contention.After the loss, Shedeur Sanders said, “I’ve been this way,” when asked about the late push and his confidence despite the noise surrounding the moment.Shedeur Sanders entered the league with heavy scrutiny after his draft slide and early season questions about Cleveland’s decision making with him in critical moments. The online reaction to the jockstrap clip has now overshadowed a productive performance that should have been the focus. Conversations about his mechanics, decision making, and late game execution took a back seat to a viral freeze frame.Instead of discussing his four touchdowns or his rally attempts, the public conversation shifted to a misunderstanding about protective equipment. The Browns have a short turnaround and a difficult schedule ahead, and Shedeur Sanders now has to answer for a moment that should never have turned into the main story of the night.","Shedeur sanders threw four touchdowns in the browns' 31-29 loss to the tennessee titans.

How Charlise Castro shaped her own career rather than being just a baseball wife

How George Springer and Charlise Castro's relationship grew through hard work and understanding

Charlise Castro’s life shows how identity and love can coexist for sports families

Charlise Castro’s life story reads far beyond the tag of being married to Toronto Blue Jays right fielder George Springer. She was a college standout long before she walked down the aisle, earning respect for her talent in softball and her later success in the wellness field. Her journey offers a look at how partners of elite athletes build their own paths while living in a world dominated by bright stadium lights and constant attention. Castro’s growth reflects ambition, resilience, and a firm belief that her identity deserves its own spotlight.Castro’s athletic journey began at the University at Albany where her strength at the plate turned her into a force in Division I softball. Her scholarship was earned, her achievements were celebrated, and her award as America East Player of the Year stamped her influence as one of the best young hitters in the country. Her selection to Puerto Rico’s national team only elevated her visibility, showing she could compete internationally. Yet her switch from professional play to personal development shows how she values reinvention over comfort.After graduating, Castro chose personal growth over lingering nostalgia for sport. She earned an MBA from the University of Saint Rose, taking her knowledge from the field into classrooms and business settings.That shift positioned her for a career in health, fitness, and wellness coaching where she could help others find confidence and balance. Her evolution showcases how athletes can turn discipline into leadership and passion into service.Castro has developed a quiet but credible space in the wellness world where she blends her business skills with lived athletic experience. Instead of promoting glamour without substance, she uses her platform to guide people toward stronger lifestyles. Even with Springer’s fame attracting followers, Castro’s work stands on its own credibility, supported by years of sport and education. She projects independence in a world where athlete spouses are often expected to stand behind.Castro first met Springer in 2011 when both were student athletes determining their futures. They bonded over long training days, competitive pressure, and goals that required sacrifice and patience. When Springer chased the majors, Castro chased academic achievement, creating parallel pursuits rather than one supporting role. Their connection deepened through understanding rather than dependency.The couple married in January 2018 in Newport Beach, California, in a setting suitable for two people balancing spotlight and family. The years since brought travel, clubhouse life, new homes, and eventually parenthood as they welcomed two children into the fold. Castro’s ability to nurture home life while working shows how she and Springer operate as a team, not as celebrity center and shadow. Their relationship reflects mutual ambition wrapped in family values.Today, Castro represents the changing narrative of partners in professional sports where wives create personal value instead of standing as silent figures on camera. Her athletic roots, career achievements, and steady role in Springer’s life make her part of his story without being overshadowed by it. Her journey is a reminder that balanced relationships in sports are built on choice, effort, and equal dreams. For George Springer, she remains his biggest supporter but also his truest match in drive and determination. Their story reminds everyone that shared ambition can build a lasting bond.Also read: Freddie Freeman and Ryan Reynolds’ SickKids video goes viral as fans explode with hilarious reactions online","Charlise castro is the wife of toronto blue jays right fielder george springer.

Patriots’ positive signs on Will Campbell’s recovery



'Secret Sauce' Following BYE- Patriots HC Mike Vrabel Joins! Campbell Update? ||The Greg Hill Show

The New England Patriots received some encouraging news regarding rookie left tackle Will Campbell, who has been sidelined since Week 12 due to an MCL sprain. Campbell missed the team’s Week 13 matchup against the Cincinnati Bengals, and his placement on injured reserve meant he would be out for at least the next three games, with the Week 14 bye not counting toward the minimum four-week IR stay. For a team navigating a critical stretch of the regular season, any positive sign of recovery is a huge boost.While the initial injury reports were alarming, there is reason for optimism. Sports Illustrated’s Albert Breer had labeled the injury a Grade 3 MCL sprain, suggesting a severe tear. However, recent observations indicate that Campbell’s progress may be better than expected. Patriots head coach Mike Vrabel offered an update that has fans hopeful, signaling that the rookie left tackle’s comeback could align well with the team’s playoff push.On the first practice following the team’s bye week, Campbell was seen walking through the locker room with no brace on his knee, later putting on only a sleeve. This simple detail suggests that the MCL sprain may not be as severe as initially feared. “So far, so good,” Coach Mike Vrabel said regarding Campbell’s recovery.Typically, an MCL sprain requires four to six weeks of recovery, depending on severity. If Campbell follows the shorter end of this timeline, he could return for the Week 18 regular-season finale, giving him time to regain his rhythm before the playoffs.On the other hand, if the recovery takes longer, the Patriots may need to carefully manage his return in postseason play.Securing the No. 1 seed would provide an additional week of rest, giving Campbell a better chance to return at full strength.

Spurs stay hopeful as Victor Wembanyama’s long-awaited return inches closer

San Antonio thrives without Wemby but eagerly awaits his dominant comeback

Victor Wembanyama of the San Antonio Spurs has missed the past ten games while recovering from a calf strain. The Spurs have maintained their hot start, sitting seventh in the Western Conference with a 15-7 record. But San Antonio isn't the same without the awe-inspiring Wembanyama, who could be returning after a three-week hiatus.Wembanyama hasn't played since November 14 due to a left calf issue, but he appears to be close to returning to action. McDonald had stated that Wembanyama was unlikely to play at all during the NBA Cup consolation schedule, ruling the superstar out of Monday's game in New Orleans and Wednesday's road game against the Lakers.The 7-foot-5 French great was once again leading the league in blocks, averaging career highs in many key statistical categories, and the San Antonio Spurs were positioned as early Western Conference contenders.However, according to veteran beat reporter Jeff McDonald of the San Antonio Express-News, Wembanyama will miss the Spurs' 11th consecutive game on Monday night, when they face the Pelicans in New Orleans.Wembanyama is classified as out on the Spurs injury report for their game against the New Orleans Pelicans on Monday, December 8. He is likely to miss his eleventh consecutive game. However, Wembanyama took full part in Sunday's practice. According to McDonald, Wemby will be deemed ""iffy"" to play Wednesday when the Spurs face the Los Angeles Lakers in an NBA Cup quarterfinal.However, according to Jeff McDonald of the San Antonio Express-News, Wembanyama (calf) participated fully in Sunday's practice. Wembanyama participated in Sunday's practice, and McDonald reports that the third-year prodigy is ""iffy"" for Wednesday's game, but unlikely to play Monday.While the information is optimistic for Wembanyama, it is unclear when he will suit up again. Following the two NBA Cup games, the Spurs played at home against the Wizards on December 17.Following Wednesday's 114-112 victory over the Orlando Magic, the Spurs hold the NBA's eighth-best offensive rating at 119.4. They had the league's ninth-best assist-to-turnover ratio at 2.0 after Wembanyama left with a strained calf, after ranking 23rd in the previous 12 games with him.San Antonio is 7-3 without Wembanyama and will need to go at least one more game without the All-Star center. However, they are on the verge of finally welcoming the 7 '5'' superstar back into the fold. In 12 games this season, Wembanyama has averaged 26.2 points, 12.9 rebounds, 4.0 assists, and 3.6 blocks. He won't turn 22 until January.Also read: What is Victor Wembanyama’s net worth?

LeBron James delivers a crown worthy performance

LeBron James is a legend both on and off the court

The Los Angeles Lakers travelled all the way to Wells Fargo Centre, needing a spark after their 105-126 loss to the Boston Celtics. And LeBron James made sure they didn’t leave without one. In a closely contested 112–108 victory over the 76ers, the superstar delivered another reminder that age and injuries may slow him down, but they haven’t dimmed his brilliance.The win didn’t just energize the fanbase, it also caught the attention of Lakers legend and NBA icon Magic Johnson, who rarely misses an opportunity to hype up a team that reminds him of the electric Showtime era. He called this Lakers roster “the most entertaining team in the NBA right now.”Despite missing the last game due to sciatica, the same reason that forced him to miss the first 14 games, and lingering left foot arthritis, Lebron James played for 34 minutes and put up 29 points, 7 rebounds, and 6 assists, including a remarkable fourth-quarter stretch in which he poured in 11 consecutive points. Three straight three-pointers ignited the Lakers’ bench and silenced a hostile Philly crowd, proving once again that he can still take over games whenever he chooses.Luka Doncic, meanwhile, added his own masterpiece, a 31 points, 15 rebounds, 11 assists, triple-double, helping the Lakers improve to 17–6, keeping them at 2 in the Pacific Division. With this, Doncic also remains the player with the highest average points this season: 35.Taking to social media after the game, Magic Johnson couldn’t contain his excitement. He wrote, “LeBron James was nothing short of spectacular scoring 11 straight points in the 4th quarter (including three straight 3-pointers) and had 29 total points tonight to defeat the Philadelphia 76ers 112-108!”He added, “The NBA’s leading candidate for MVP, Luka Doncic, had a triple double with 31 points, 15 rebounds and 11 assists! The Lakers are the most entertaining team in the NBA right now. ”Magic also highlighted the crowd’s reaction, a mix of awe and disbelief, as LeBron, Luka, and Austin Reaves traded big shots and dazzling plays throughout the night. For a fanbase that had been grumbling about inconsistency in recent weeks, the performance was a breath of fresh confidence.Due to Lakers’ inconsistent performances, some critics suggested that the management should look beyond LeBron James, but Sunday night served as a timely reminder of his ageless magic and ability to flip momentum and lift the entire roster.Off the court, James continues to support community work. Recently, he partnered with Amazon to deliver holiday essentials to families supported by the LeBron James Family Foundation. Students at the I Promise School were also surprised with brand-new LeBron XXIII sneakers, another gesture highlighting how deeply he remains connected to the people who shaped him.At 40, LeBron is still defying expectations on the hardwood floors, but off the court, he continues to support and lift the communities.Also Read: “Family” - LeBron James sends heartfelt message to fans from Toronto highlighting viral clip from post-ga","The los angeles lakers beat the philadelphia 76ers 112–108.

Texans’ defense dominates Chiefs while Patrick Mahomes struggles



Fans slam Patrick Mahomes as team battles uncertain 2025 season



The Kansas City Chiefs’ 2025 season has been a nightmare so far, with early defeats setting a troubling tone for a team expected to dominate. Their latest loss against the Houston Texans has intensified fan frustration, leaving many questioning the team’s strategy, execution, and Patrick Mahomes ’ role as the franchise quarterback.Patrick Mahomes, known for his clutch performances, faced harsh scrutiny after struggling throughout the game. His left knee, visibly injured during the matchup, became a hot topic among fans and analysts. While some believed Mahomes was using the injury as an excuse, others noted the relentless pressure from Houston’s defense, which left the Chiefs’ offense struggling to find any rhythm.In the Sunday showdown, Mahomes completed just 14-of-33 passes for 160 yards and threw three critical interceptions, resulting in one of the lowest passer ratings of his career. The Texans’ defense executed a perfect game plan, sacking and pressuring Mahomes relentlessly. During the third quarter, he was seen limping and using a heating pad on his left knee, fueling fan speculation that the injury might be exaggerated.Despite the backlash, reports confirm that Mahomes was indeed dealing with knee discomfort. However, the primary reason for the Chiefs’ defeat was the Texans’ defensive mastery.Kansas City’s offensive line struggled to protect their star quarterback, while turnovers and stalled drives ensured the Texans controlled the game from start to finish.Social media erupted with fans criticizing Patrick Mahomes, accusing him of exaggerating the knee injury to justify another loss. “Patrick Mahomes limps every game!! Like bro, we know you're faking! lol.,” one user wrote, while another added, “He's been doing that for years.” Others defended him, emphasizing the immense pressure faced by a quarterback leading a team under-performing this season. The Chiefs’ 2025 campaign continues to be a rollercoaster, and this latest defeat underscores the urgent need for better consistency and stronger offensive execution.Kansas City now turns its attention to Patrick Mahomes’ recovery and the team’s ability to come together. With early-season struggles behind them, every upcoming game is crucial if the Chiefs hope to turn their 2025 campaign around and keep playoff hopes alive. The team will need stronger execution on both offense and defense to regain momentum and compete at the highest level.Also Read: Will Campbell injury update: Coach Mike Vrabel reveals rookie left tackle’s recovery progress, says “so far, so good”","Kansas city chiefs' 2025 season has been a rollercoaster, with early defeats setting a troubling tone for a team expected to dominate.

Philip Rivers emerges as the Colts’ unexpected solution



Philip Rivers returned to the center of NFL conversations on Monday as the Colts searched for stability after a devastating blow to their season. With Daniel Jones sidelined for the year due to a torn Achilles, Indianapolis moved quickly to explore options that could keep its playoff hopes alive. That urgency led to a surprising development when NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport and Mike Garafolo reported that Rivers will visit the team facility on Tuesday for a workout. The news arrived on his 44th birthday, creating a moment that blended timing, nostalgia and the possibility of an unexpected comeback.Rivers last suited up in 2020, a season that many believed marked the close of his long career. In that lone year with the Colts, he pushed the franchise into the postseason and provided the leadership they needed at the time. He has since stayed around the game while coaching high school football at St. Michael Catholic in Fairhope, Alabama. That school is also home to Colts rookie Riley Leonard, who views Rivers as a mentor. Their connection adds meaning to a reunion that feels sudden but not entirely out of place for the franchise.The quarterback room collapsed quickly for Indianapolis. Jones’s season-ending injury followed the earlier loss of Anthony Richardson, who remains out with a fractured orbital bone.Leonard is expected to start this week against the Seahawks, but he is navigating a knee issue after stepping in during the game against Jacksonville. These problems backed the Colts into a corner, leaving them with few choices and pushing them toward Rivers, who has not taken an NFL snap in four years.Rapoport underscored the urgency by posting, ""The Colts are planning to bring potential Hall of Fame QB Philip Rivers into their facility Tuesday to work out to see if he may join their practice squad, per me & Mike Garafolo. This is real. Daniel Jones’ season is over, Riley Leonard will start, but Rivers may be an option."" If he signs, he would instantly become the league’s oldest active player, edging out Aaron Rodgers.For a team trying to rescue a season slipping away, Rivers represents experience, calm and a familiar voice in the huddle. Now the Colts must decide whether this surprising path can guide them through the weeks ahead.Also Read: Madison Beer teases major career update as Justin Herbert prepares for crucial Chargers–Eagles showdown","Philip rivers will visit the team facility on tuesday for a workout.

Drake Maye’s wife Ann Michael Maye has become a surprising highlight of the Patriots season, and it has nothing to do with football stats or playbooks. Her TikTok baking videos have turned into a daily event for fans, and the New England Patriots are getting a sweet taste of it, too. Coach Mike Vrabel revealed that the treats filling her feed are not only real but show up in the building, and he has tried some himself. With the team sitting at 11-2 and enjoying a bye week, Ann Michael kept her own streak alive with her steady flow of “Bakemas” creations, including a cinnamon sourdough loaf that had viewers hooked.Fans have crowded her comments with praise, pushing her TikTok engagement past 2.5 million likes. Long before the latest surge, she was already baking themed treats for game days. Before the Patriots’ last win, she made Patriots-style M&M and chocolate chip cookies, and she called Thanksgiving her “Super Bowl.” Now the attention has shifted again after Vrabel admitted he sampled her apple crisp bars and said they were “delicious. ” He also said, “She brings them in for the O-lineman.” That sounds like a pretty strong game plan on its own.The rest of the roster might be wondering when their turn is coming, but fans have gotten plenty to enjoy.

Jaylen Brown earns spotlight after NBA announcement



Boston Celtics thriving while Jayson Tatum recovers



The Boston Celtics walked out of their fifth straight victory with more than momentum in their pockets. Jaylen Brown, already carrying the bulk of the team’s offense this season, added another personal milestone as the NBA unveiled its latest honors. His surge has shaped Boston’s push up the standings, and the league’s announcement highlighted how central he has become during a stretch defined by heavy usage and consistent production. The recognition arrived as another marker in a season where Brown has stepped into a starring role.The NBA named Brown the Eastern Conference Player of the Week after he powered the Celtics through an undefeated run against the New York Knicks, Los Angeles Lakers, and Toronto Raptors. His numbers during that span reflected an elite rhythm in December first week: 34 points, 6.7 rebounds, and 5.7 assists on efficient splits from every level. Boston improved to 15-9 with the streak, climbing back into the top tier of the East.Jaylen Brown opened the week with a statement performance, adding 42 points on 66.7 percent shooting against the Knicks, the team that ended Boston’s 2025 postseason. His impact touched every part of the game, including a team-best plus/minus of plus-15.The Celtics noted the performance marked “Brown’s 14th career 40-point game, third of the season, and second in four days.”Even an illness that kept him out against the Washington Wizards didn’t interrupt his rhythm. He returned to score back-to-back 30-point outings against the Lakers and Raptors, adding eight rebounds in both games. His recent stretch includes nine games with at least 20 points, fueling Boston’s rise.This season has also brought career-high averages across major categories. The absence of Jayson Tatum, who has been recovering from an Achilles injury, opened a window for Brown to run the offense. The departures of Al Horford, Jrue Holiday, and Kristaps Porzingis put even more weight on his shoulders. He has answered with efficient scoring, improved playmaking, and steady leadership.Head coach Joe Mazzulla has pushed the Celtics forward with a rotation built around Brown, Derrick White, Neemias Queta, Payton Pritchard, and Anfernee Simons. All but Simons are posting career-high scoring averages. The team sits fifth in net rating and second in offensive rating.After the win over Toronto, Mazzulla shrugged off questions about the standings, saying, “No, it doesn’t mean anything. It doesn’t show you anything. There are ebbs and flows along the way in the league. At the end of the day, we have a clear identity of who we are.”A late-season Tatum return remains possible, but Brown’s surge keeps Boston stable and dangerous.Also Read: Why Desmond Bane was fined?
