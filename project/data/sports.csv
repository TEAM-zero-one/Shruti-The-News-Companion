She captioned the photo, “Traditions at the US Open. Thank you Emirates for hosting an incredible night of tennis.”The sighting added to the significance of the week, as it followed Jack’s birthday celebrations on August 22. Jack, born in 2007, has grown up in the public eye as the son of Brady and Moynahan, who dated from 2004 to 2006.Six days earlier, Tom Brady had shared a heartfelt tribute to his eldest son. “From little steps to big dreams, happy birthday Jack. You’ve always shown grace, courage, love, and kindness since the day you were born. I’m so proud of the man you are! Welcome to adulthood—it comes with higher credit card limits, bigger bills, and no curfew… well, maybe not all at once!”He added, “A dad’s heart soars with his children’s happiness, not with his own.We love you so much, and I know this will be your best year yet.”Also Read: “He was stunned”: Tom Brady was blindsided when Gisele Bündchen revealed she was expecting Joaquim Valente’s child Tom Brady and Bridget Moynahan’s relationship ended before Jack’s birth, yet both have maintained a respectful co-parenting dynamic over the years.

Deion Sanders’ advice for Travis Hunter as a new dad



Travis Hunter embraces fatherhood and NFL dreams



Travis Hunter is stepping into fatherhood and the NFL at the same time, and one man who has been by his side throughout this journey is Deion Sanders. The Hall of Famer, who once recruited Hunter to Jackson State and later coached him at Colorado, recently shared heartfelt fatherly advice for the Jacksonville Jaguars rookie as he embraces life’s two biggest milestones — becoming a professional athlete and a dad.For Sanders, Travis Hunter has always been more than a player. Their bond goes back to 2021 when Hunter, then the No. 1 recruit in the nation, shocked everyone by committing to Jackson State instead of a powerhouse like Florida State. He later followed Sanders to Colorado, where he won the 2024 Heisman Trophy as a two-way sensation. Through it all, Sanders played a fatherly role, especially during Hunter’s toughest moments.On the night Hunter lifted the Heisman, his biological father was absent due to legal troubles. Sanders stepped in, embracing the young star in what became one of the most emotional moments of Hunter’s career. Years later, when Sanders was quietly battling a bladder cancer scare and couldn’t attend Hunter’s wedding, the rookie showed up at his coach’s Texas ranch, standing by him as the two shared quiet moments fishing together.“Oh my god, I’m taking a deep breath because I love him to life — I love him like he’s my son,” Sanders said. “It’s funny when your son is now a father… it’s a beautiful thing.“The thing that I told him is let’s correct all the things that we think we didn’t receive as children and let’s do that in our fatherhood. No matter what happens, let’s make sure we are the best darn father that ever walked. That’s what I told him. I’m proud of him, I love him to life, and I miss him dearly.”It wasn’t coach-speak. It was a father figure speaking to someone he considers family.Hunter, just 22, is now a husband and a father. He and his longtime girlfriend, Leanna Lenee, tied the knot earlier this year before welcoming their first child, a baby boy. In a heartfelt video titled “Dear Son…”, Hunter can be heard saying to his newborn, “Gotta be better than me.”The timing couldn’t be more symbolic. On September 7, Hunter will make his NFL debut when the Jaguars face the Carolina Panthers. It marks the start of two parallel journeys: one on the field as a top draft pick, and one at home as a father. With Sanders’ wisdom and his own determination, Hunter now carries two legacies — as a rising NFL star and as a dad committed to doing things right. Fans and critics will be watching Hunter how he make his debut a dreamy one.Also Read: Justin Jefferson injury update: Vikings may take cautious approach as hamstring issue raises long-term concerns","Deion sanders gives travis hunter fatherhood guidance.

Connor McDavid, the Edmonton Oilers’ captain and one of the most talented players in the league, has been dealing with speculation about his future in the team. His contract with the Edmonton Oilers is all set to expire in a few months and fans are pretty stressed about the situation. While Connor McDavid has made a confusing few statements about it, TSN analyst Bryan Hayes has broken his silence on it.A few days ago, Connor McDavid spoke about his future with the Edmonton Oilers at the Team Canada’s Olympic camp.The Edmonton Oilers’ captain said, “I have every intention to win in Edmonton…I’d say all options are on the table, really…I don’t have a preference either way.”While this might have been the first time that the star player publicly addressed the situation, Connor McDavid’s statements had left many confused.Recently, on TSN’s Overdrive, analyst Bryan Hayes spoke about Connor McDavid’s situation.Bryan Hayes said, ""I find his phrasing very curious…Like, that is very manipulative, right?

Hockey’s cultural landscape has moved beyond one man’s legacy

The Canadian identity crisis goes deeper than Wayne Gretzky’s shadow

Tired of too many ads? go ad free now

For decades, Wayne Gretzky stood as the ultimate symbol of Canadian hockey pride. His dazzling play and unmatched records gave Canada a face in the global sports arena, and his legacy still commands respect. Yet as the game evolves, a cultural shift is forcing Canadians to reconsider whether Gretzky still embodies the sport’s identity.When Gretzky retired, many believed his status as “The Great One” would eternally tie him to Canada’s hockey soul. But today’s NHL reflects a broader, more global identity. Stars like Connor McDavid , Auston Matthews, and Sidney Crosby have taken the torch, while international icons from Sweden, Russia, and the United States increasingly shape the league.Canada’s hockey culture is no longer built solely on a single national figurehead. Instead, it reflects diversity, new styles of play, and a growing international influence. Gretzky’s records still hold weight, but younger generations see him as a legend of the past, not the face of today’s game.The debate isn’t about Gretzky’s greatness, it’s about what he represents. Canada once relied on him to symbolize dominance and unity in hockey. But as the sport evolves, Canadians are confronting uncomfortable questions about their place in a game they no longer exclusively own.Hockey’s growth in non-traditional markets, combined with Canada’s struggles to consistently dominate on the world stage, has fueled this identity crisis. While Gretzky remains the most iconic name in hockey history, he no longer reflects the modern state of the sport or Canada’s role within it.Also Read: Wayne Gretzky's daughter Paulina Gretzky turns head in bold gothic look during Italian getaway with Dustin Johnson In the end, Gretzky’s influence will never disappear, but Canada’s hockey identity now extends beyond his shadow.

Josh Allen gets emotional over Hailee Steinfeld’s success



Josh Allen manifests a Buffalo Super Bowl parade



Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen has been in the spotlight plenty of times, but his latest candid conversation with NFL Network’s Kyle Brandt might be the most revealing yet. Captured by Hard Knocks cameras during preseason, the exchange showed not only Allen’s pride in his wife Hailee Steinfeld ’s new movie Sinners but also his unshakable belief in bringing a Super Bowl to Buffalo.When Brandt asked Allen about Sinners, the quarterback couldn’t hide his admiration for Steinfeld’s performance alongside Michael B. Jordan. He called the movie “an A+,” adding, “My wife absolutely kills it. And hopefully, awards season coming around, people make the right decisions.”Allen’s praise didn’t stop there. Asked whether it was a hot take to call Steinfeld the most talented person in their household, Allen immediately agreed: “Absolutely not. A thousand percent. And I’m okay with it.” He revealed he was moved to tears at the film’s premiere. “When we watched it at the premier I was crying at the end. I was just so proud of her. I get emotional thinking about it. It was a pretty cool experience.With the Academy Awards scheduled for March 2026, just weeks after the Super Bowl, Steinfeld’s name could well be in the conversation for Best Supporting Actress. That means the Allen household may be preparing for not just one but two unforgettable celebrations this winter.While Allen beamed with pride over Steinfeld, his own dreams remain fixed on Buffalo. He told Brandt that he has already envisioned the Bills’ first Lombardi Trophy parade in vivid detail. “It’s not written down, but it’s up there,” he said of the victory speech he plans to deliver.Allen painted the scene: a frigid five-degree day, buses rolling through icy streets, and thousands of fans filling downtown Buffalo as the team makes its way to City Hall. “I can feel it,” he said. “I see it all. So, gotta turn it into a reality.”For Allen, it’s more than just optimism—it’s manifestation. By speaking his vision into existence, he’s aligning personal pride with professional ambition. And if fate plays along, the coming months could define both his career and his family’s legacy in unforgettable fashion.Also Read: Experts warn Ravens’ Buffalo Bills woes may continue, but Lamar Jackson could flip the script under the lights",Josh allen opens up about wife hailee steinfeld’s new movie sinners.

Reactions to Charles Barkley’s take

The debate over who the GOAT is among Michael Jordan Kobe Bryant , and LeBron James will never end, but Charles Barkley has added a fresh perspective to the conversation. The NBA legend shared his thoughts on the differences between the three players, and why he believes LeBron James stands out as a person.Charles Barkley, who has some free time during the NBA offseason, recently appeared on The Bill Simmons Podcast where he discussed his views on LeBron James, Kobe Bryant, and Michael Jordan.He told Bill Simmons, “The three best players I've ever seen were Michael, Kobe, and LeBron. And I'll tell you the difference in the three... Michael and Kobe are dangerous. They'll kill your a**. LeBron's a nice guy, and that's not a knock. He's still great, great, great, but he's a nice guy. Michael and Kobe aren't nice guys. They're different.”Doubling down on his opinion, Barkley added, “I always tell people the difference between Michael and Kobe, man, they are dangerous. I mean, they really wanted to kill you and humiliate you.”It is to be noted, Barkley made it clear that he never had that killer mentality. “Everybody's not built like that. I'm not even built like that.I think I'm a pseudo-tough guy. I want to win, but I'm just not like those guys.”However, Barkley stopped short of ranking LeBron above Jordan in the GOAT debate. He explained, “LeBron is amazing. What he's done in the community is amazing. In fairness, I wouldn't even put LeBron past Kobe, let's get that out of the way. I want to be fair. The reason I put Michael up there, above those other guys — LeBron has stacked his teams, let's be realistic.”NBA fans agreed with Barkley’s take. One fan wrote on YouTube, “What an incredible interview — great NBA stories, talking about Kobe, MJ, and Bron without hating on any of them (though slight jabs at Bron lol) — and then the detailed discussion about the business aspect of Inside the NBA. Hoping for more of these with more players from the 90s!”Another fan commented, “Chuck has his quirks, but one thing that always shines through whenever I listen to him is that he is genuinely a really good guy.”Also Read: Los Angeles Lakers coach claims Luka Doncic and LeBron James have improved in each other’s company: “I think it’s two-way motivating” LeBron James is currently the most senior active player in the NBA.

However, James put all speculation to rest and confirmed that he will return next season.","Charles barkley says lebron james is a nice guy unlike michael jordan and kobe bryant.

Niko Mikkola’s rise from depth defenseman to reliable Panther



How Paul Maurice turned Niko Mikkola into a playoff asset



Why Niko Mikkola’s presence matters for Aleksander Barkov and Sergei Bobrovsky



The Florida Panthers have plenty of stars. Aleksander Barkov anchors the offense. Sergei Bobrovsky continues to stand tall in goal. Matthew Tkachuk thrives in the spotlight. Yet, behind the headlines, defenseman Niko Mikkola has become the kind of player every championship roster needs: steady, physical, and quietly effective.His path to South Florida was far from straightforward. Drafted by the St. Louis Blues in 2015, Mikkola struggled to find consistent minutes early in his NHL career. A brief stint with the New York Rangers added little clarity about his future. But since signing with Florida in 2023, he’s grown into a dependable presence on the Panthers’ blue line.Standing 6-foot-6, Niko Mikkola brings the kind of reach and strength few opponents enjoy facing in his first full season with Florida. Here, he logged 76 games, scoring six goals and adding 16 assists, and more importantly, his playoff performance proved he could step up under pressure.Game 3 of the 2024 Eastern Conference Final against the Carolina Hurricanes. This marked a turning point; Mikkola scored twice, including the game-winner. This helps the Panthers seize control of the series for a player once considered a depth option. It was a breakout moment that showed his value goes far beyond the stat sheet.Florida Panthers coach Paul Maurice has praised Mikkola for his adaptability and intensity. The defenseman’s ability to close space quickly and play an aggressive style makes him fit perfectly into the system Maurice demands.What sets Mikkola apart is his balance between physical play and mobility. He isn’t just big, he can skate, recover, and force opponents into mistakes. Maurice has leaned on him for difficult defensive assignments, trusting that his presence will give stars like Aleksander Barkov and Matthew Tkachuk more room to create offensively.Championship teams are built on depth, and Niko Mikkola provides exactly that. For Aleksander Barkov, knowing the defense behind him can hold firm allows more freedom up front. For Sergei Bobrovsky, Mikkola’s shot-blocking and crease-clearing presence are invaluable.Brad Marchand, now a teammate in Florida, summed it up well: opponents have no time and space when Mikkola is on the ice. That kind of pressure tilts the game in subtle but significant ways.Mikkola may never grab the same spotlight as Barkov or Bobrovsky, but his emergence as a trusted defenseman ensures the Panthers remain one of the NHL’s toughest teams to break down. For Florida, “The Condor” is no longer a hidden piece; he’s an essential oneAlso Read: NHL Trade Rumor: Will Rasmus Andersson spark a defensive shake-up this season?","Niko mikkola was drafted by the st. louis blues in 2015.

When will CSK legend MS Dhoni retire from IPL? Astrologer Greenstone Lobo predicts

Irfan Pathan on X (Screengrab)

Former India all-rounder Irfan Pathan has reacted sharply after an old interview clip linked to MS Dhoni resurfaced online, sparking heated debate on social media.The video, from years ago, featured Pathan reflecting on his communication with Dhoni during his playing days and included remarks that some interpreted as a cryptic reference to the former captain’s off-field preferences.As the clip gained traction, Pathan took to X with a cryptic post, questioning the motives behind its sudden reappearance. “Half decade old video surfacing NOW with a twisted context to the Statement. Fan war? PR lobby?” he wrote, suggesting the resurfacing may have been deliberate. In the interview, Pathan had recalled an incident from the 2008 Australia series when media reports suggested Dhoni was dissatisfied with his bowling.“Yes, I asked him. During the 2008 Australia series, Mahi bhai’s statement came out in the media that Irfan wasn’t bowling well. I thought I had bowled well throughout the series, so I went and asked Mahi bhai. Sometimes statements are twisted in the media, so I also wanted to clarify. Mahi bhai said, ‘No Irfan, there is nothing like this, everything’s going as per plans.’ When you get a reply like this, you believe that okay, you do what you can. Also if you keep asking for explanations again and again after that, you hurt your self-respect,” Pathan said.He followed that account with a pointed remark: “I don’t have a habit of setting up hookah in someone’s room or talking about this. Everyone knows. Sometimes if you don’t speak about it, it’s better. A cricketer’s job is to perform on the field and that is what I used to focus on.”The remarks have ignited a storm of online discussion, with fans divided over whether they were a dig at Dhoni or a broader comment on team culture at the time.By addressing the controversy through his latest post, Pathan has indicated his displeasure at the way the comments have been framed and interpreted, while hinting that the video surfacing again may be part of a deliberate attempt or scheme.","Former india all-rounder irfan pathan has reacted sharply after an old interview clip linked to ms dhoni resurfaced online.

Uncovering the Insane Price of Wayne Gretzkys Final Jersey Sold at Auction #NHL #waynegretzky

Wayne Gretzky’s final NHL point jersey is expected to surpass $1 million



Kobe Bryant’s first No. 24 Los Angeles Lakers jersey returns to the market



Sotheby’s Sports Week to feature rare memorabilia from global icons



Two jerseys tied to defining moments in sports history are set to re-enter the market. Sotheby’s will auction Wayne Gretzky’s final NHL point jersey and Kobe Bryant’s first No. 24 Los Angeles Lakers jersey on September 30 in New York. Both items are expected to sell for more than $1 million, reflecting their historical and cultural weight.On April 18, 1999, Wayne Gretzky stepped onto the ice for the last time in his storied career. Playing for the New York Rangers against the Pittsburgh Penguins, he set up Brian Leetch’s late second-period goal. That assist became Gretzky’s 2,857th and final NHL point, capping a career that left him as hockey’s all-time leading scorer.The jersey he wore during that period is now available for sale again. Sotheby’s confirmed it is one of four sweaters Gretzky used that night, authenticated by MeiGray and the Rangers. It is signed, inscribed with the date, and previously displayed at Madison Square Garden. Collector Rob Gough purchased it for $715,120 in 2023 but is now selling, with expectations that the price will climb past the million-dollar mark.Kobe Bryant’s number change from 8 to 24 ahead of the 2006–07 season marked the start of a new phase in his career. He wore the new jersey for the first time on November 3, 2006, scoring 23 points in a win over the Seattle SuperSonics. That year, he averaged 31.6 points per game and won his second straight scoring title.The jersey was originally sold by Upper Deck Authenticated for just $10,875 shortly after the game. Nearly two decades later, the market has undergone a dramatic shift. Bryant’s memorabilia surged in demand following his passing in 2020, with Sotheby’s recently selling his NBA debut jersey for over $7 million. This first No. 24 jersey, signed and inscribed “First 24,” is now expected to cross the million-dollar threshold.The Gretzky and Bryant jerseys will headline Sotheby’s Sports Week on September 30. Gretzky’s will be sold in a dedicated event titled The Great One at 6 PM ET, followed by Bryant’s in Legends of Sport at 6:15.

Connor McDavid, balancing personal value and team success in contract plans



Edmonton Oilers expect Connor McDavid to shape future NHL salary standards

With Connor McDavid closing in on the last year of his current contract, the Edmonton Oilers will face one of the most defining moments in their history. The signing of a $112 million contract for his teammate, Leon Draisaitl, earlier this summer only fuels the speculation that McDavid's contract would follow the same trajectory. In addition, comments from Jeff Jackson, the CEO of the Oilers, in which he stated that Draisaitl’s contract, while respected, would not be the standard for McDavid’s extension talks, also add more to the teasing.On “Oilers Now,” Jeff Jackson brought up McDavid’s appreciation of Draisaitl and the team’s bigger picture of the organization. While more certainly comes into play with Draisaitl’s record-breaking deal, McDavid’s decisions will certainly be about much more than money. While discussing McDavid, Jackson talked about how humble, thoughtful, and purposeful he is, especially in understanding the need for roster agility.Rather than focusing on the most lucrative deal, McDavid is aiming for an agreement that offers reasonable pay but also allows the Oilers to retain other key players. His conduct mirrors his guiding principles as a leader: McDavid, like many others in leadership roles, seeks to maximize team victories and ensure the organization remains competitive in the long run instead of chasing personal wins or financial milestones.Having signed an eight-year, $100 million deal in 2017, McDavid’s contract will expire after the 2025-26 season. Given the increase in the NHL salary cap and the prospect of McDavid’s next statistically dominant contract, it will likely set the remuneration record. Last season, he achieved 100 points in 67 games and added 33 more in the playoffs, winning the 2024 Conn Smythe Trophy.In August at Canada’s Olympic camp, McDavid stated that he is not hastening the extension’s conclusion but is still devoted to Edmonton. His intentions are unmistakable: Winning the Stanley Cup for the Oilers, with the additional aspiration of Olympic gold. To the Oilers, it will be vital to make their captain feel appreciated and supported to successfully sign what will be one of the most important contracts for both the franchise and the NHL.Also Read: Dennis Hildeby’s contract extension sparks strong reaction from Maple Leafs fans Following Leon Draisaitl's recent contract negotiations, McDavid has publicly shut down any rumors of a potential holdout.

Jeff Driskel brings experience to Raiders’ QB room

Why the Raiders signed Jeff Driskel right now

Jeff Driskel, a 32-year-old veteran quarterback, has just signed with the Las Vegas Raiders’ practice squad on Monday, September 1, 2025, in Las Vegas. This move gives the Raiders more depth at quarterback just before their season opener. Driskel has played for many teams in the NFL and now lands on his ninth one. He arrives as an emergency backup behind starters Geno Smith and Kenny Pickett.Jeff Driskel was drafted in the sixth round of the 2016 NFL Draft by the San Francisco 49ers after playing college football at Florida and Louisiana Tech. Over nearly a decade, he’s worn jerseys for the Bengals, Lions, Broncos, Texans, Cardinals, Browns, and most recently, the Washington Commanders in the 2024 season.In his NFL career, Jeff Driskel has played in 25 games and started 12, winning just 1 and losing 10. He has a career completion rate of about 58.6%, with 16 touchdown passes and 10 interceptions.With the Raiders, Jeff Driskel steps into the practice squad alongside rookie Cam Miller and serves as a reliable fallback if both Geno Smith and Kenny Pickett (who has a hamstring issue) are unavailable.Also Read: “Respect Women, Or Else…”: Cardi B Explodes Outside California Courthouse After Offset Brag And Stefon Diggs Pregnancy Question The Raiders made this move just before their Week 1 game against the New England Patriots.Injuries in the quarterback room, like Kenny Pickett’s hamstring and Aidan O’Connell’s preseason wrist injury, made insurance necessary.Jeff Driskel connects well with the Raiders’ system, too.

Inside the story of Saquon Barkley

It’s been a five-year journey. I’ve been using this as my diary, as my therapy,”

“The heart of this film beats strongest away from the stadium, where Saquon’s identity as a father, husband, and friend reveals a man whose priorities transcend yardage and contracts.”

The significance of timing and storytelling

For the first time, fans will be able to see Saquon's life on and off the field in a documentary film directed by David E. Talbert, who has released his share of blockbusters such as ‘Think Like a Man’ and ‘Jingle Jangle: A Christmas Journey. ’ Saquon announced on the eve of the Philadelphia Eagles' season opener. Titled ‘Saquon,’ the film also features legendary filmmaker Martin Scorsese serving as executive producer, and is set to premiere on Amazon Prime Video on Thursday, October 9, coinciding with an equally significant Thursday Night Football matchup in which the Eagles face Barkley’s former team, the New York Giants.Saquon follows Barkley through his last five years, promising a candid and introspective view of some of the most important events in his life, at least based on press releases and the film's trailer. Fans will witness both the messy contract negotiations with the Giants and the shocking turn that followed, including signing the dotted line for the Eagles and winning a Super Bowl that solidified his legacy. But they'll also see his recovery from ACL surgery.The movie goes far beyond stats and plays of the Eagles' star. The story also dives deep into the personal side of the athlete: his relationships, his role as a father and partner, and the emotional process he describes as both “a diary” and “therapy.” Barkley’s voice rings throughout: “he says in the teaser. The press release adds,Also Read: Saquon Barkley credits Christianity for unlocking the best year of his NFL career The release of the movie isn't just a clever option; it's a strategic option. Throw in the fact that it'll also mark the night Barkley returns to MetLife Stadium to play his former team, and you have a serious narrative juggernaut. Not by coincidence, of course, considering the superstructure of a whole day of Barkley content afterward, moving the spectacle beyond the gridiron.Of course, it doesn't hurt to have a little pedigree; Martin Scorsese executive produces. Scorsese is obviously a cinematic master, and his presence bodes well for a documentary that will delve deeper than the average sports narrative.Barkley is following in the footsteps of Eagles legend Jason Kelce, as Kelce's own version of this film premiered on Prime Video in September 2023. In Saquon, fans are getting a storyline that mixes athletic excellence, personal redemption, and big-screen drama in one package.","Philadelphia eagles running back saquon barkley will be the subject of a documentary film.

Roman Anthony’s impact and what his absence means for the Red Sox



Roman Anthony, the 21-year-old outfielder for the Boston Red Sox, was placed on the injured list on Wednesday, September 3, after suffering a left oblique strain. The injury happened Tuesday night during Boston’s 11-7 win over the Cleveland Guardians at Fenway Park. Anthony struck out in the fourth inning and was seen holding his left side before leaving the game. He later underwent an MRI that confirmed the strain. Manager Alex Cora explained on WEEI radio that these injuries usually take four to six weeks, which could rule Anthony out for the rest of the regular season.Roman Anthony’s injury became clear on Tuesday, September 2, when he swung and missed at a pitch during the bottom of the fourth inning at Fenway Park.After the strikeout, he bent slightly, placed a hand near his ribs, and walked straight back to the dugout. He was quickly replaced in the outfield by Nate Eaton.The following morning, September 3, the Red Sox confirmed he would go on the 10-day injured list. Manager Alex Cora said,adding that a normal recovery for such an injury takes at least four weeks.
