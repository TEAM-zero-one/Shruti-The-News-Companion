As the two captains came out for the toss in Match 65 of the ongoing IPL 2025, Pat Cummins was the usual suspect from the Sunrisers Hyderabad camp. But the face in red, representing Royal Challengers Bengaluru, was not Rajat Patidar . Instead, Jitesh Sharma is captaining RCB in the match with a top-two place on the line for the franchise. For SRH, though, this game holds no bearing as they've already been eliminated.At the toss, Jitesh got the luck of the coin and decided to field. In the chat with Ravi Shastri, Jitesh revealed Patidar is not fully out of the game and can come in later as the Impact Player.He also revealed the team's change in Devdutt Padikkal not playing with Mayank Agarwal coming in.""We have raised our bar and we are looking to top the table. We are not complacent. We want to play the playoffs on top. The ways the seniors have handled the juniors have created a good atmosphere and cricketing culture. RCB always enjoy their cricket. We want to win every game,"" said Jitesh.""Rajat is the impact player. Mayank is going to replace Padikkal,"" he added.Sunrisers Hyderabad, meanwhile, have three changes, including Travis Head coming in. The Aussie had been out in the previous game as he had tested COVID-19 positive.The other inclusions are Abhinav Manohar and Jaydev Unadkat.""We have been playing well in the last few games.

MUMBAI: The 'coronation Day' Shubman Gill as India’s new Test captain has finally arrived. When the national selectors meet at the BCCI HQ here on Saturday at 1pm to pick the squad for the upcoming five-Test tour of England, Gill is all set to be named as the new captain of India's red-ball team.While the 25-year-old Punjab batter will lead the side, either KL Rahul or Rishabh Pant would be his deputy. According to a reliable source, premier pacer Jasprit Bumrah ruled himself out of the captaincy race when he informed the selectors that he would not be interested in the job as he will not be able to play in all the five Tests in England.This will be India's first Test series since the Test retirements of the superstar duo of Rohit Sharma (previous Test captain) and Virat Kohli. The selection meeting is set to be followed by a press conference of chief selector Ajit Agarkar.Like they did in the case of the Australian tour in Dec-Jan, the selectors are likely to ignore veteran pacer Mohammed Shami for the gruelling tour as the 34-year-old's ability to bowl long spell is a concern, and there's little chance that he will be able to feature in all the five Tests. With Bumrah already having informed the BCCI that he wouldn't feature in more than three Tests, taking another bowler who can't last the series isn't a great idea.According to sources, the selectors are likely to ignore Punjab Kings captain Shreyas Iyer from India's Test squad, despite the middle-order batter having done well for Mumbai in the Ranji Trophy in the 2024-25 season. The 30-year-old scored 480 runs @68.57, with two centuries, in five matches in the Ranji Trophy last year. A big indication that Iyer wasn't there in the selectors' scheme of things was evident when he was ignored from the India A squad shadow tour to England, which precedes the series. ""Iyer's new stance, bold strokeplay, carefree attitude to batting are all suited to the white-ball game now. The selectors aren't convinced about his red-ball skills,"" a source tracking developments told TOI.Two batters who are definitely in with a contention for a berth in the India squad are Sai Sudharsan and Karun Nair. Both have been picked for the India A tour to England-the team will depart on Sunday- though Sudharsan will only join the side from the second match. Primed for a Test comeback after as long as eight years, Nair has been a prolific scorer in domestic circuit - he slammed 863 runs in nine Ranji Trophy matches with four centuries at an average of 53.93 to play a stellar role in Vidarbha's third Ranji Trophy triumph. Even in the 2023-24 Ranji season, Nair had stroked 690 runs in 10 matches@40.58, with two centuries and three fifties, to help Vidarbha finish as finalists. The 30-year-old's high point in domestic cricket, though, came in the Vijay Hazare Trophy last season, when he smashed 779 runs in nine matches (eight innings) at an incredible average of 389.50, with five centuries. ""If the selectors don't pick someone who has shown such consistency in domestic cricket, then what's the point of playing domestic cricket. He's a certainty,"" a source tracking developments told TOI.The 23-year-old Sai has been on fire while playing for the Gujarat Titans in IPL-2025, and is currently the leading run-scorer in the League with 638 runs in 13 matches @53.16, fifth five fifties and a hundred under his belt. The left-handed from Tamil Nadu has been rated highly, and it would help that his opening partner and captain Gill will now be the new captain of the Test side. The only glitch is that Sudharsan's first-class ecord isn’t great-he has scored 1957 runs in 29 matches@39.93, with seven hundred and five fifties. However, his technique, temperament, consistency and strokeplay all make Sudharsan an attractive package.Highly impressed with Sudarshan, his batting colleague at Gujarat Titans, former England white-ball captain Jos Buttler had told the official broadcaster, “I've said it a few times, day one watching him in the nets, I was blown away by how good he is. More importantly, (he's got) great head on his shoulders. The effort he puts in, the work, the understanding of his game, the humility to keep coming everyday and keep working. He's shown fantastic consistency and getting the rewards he deserves.”While he has formed a successful opening partnership with Gill in the ongoing IPL, Sudharshan is unlikely to open in England. The Indian team management is likely to continue with the opening combination of Yashasvi Jaiswal and KL Rahul. With Gill likely to slip down to No 4 to fill in the big shoes of Kohli at that slot, the No. 3 slot could be a toss-up between Sudharsan and Nair.Mumbai's middle-order batter Sarfaraz Khan too could find a place in the squad. Though he couldn't get a game in the Border-Gavaskar series in Australia which India lost 3-1, Sarfaraz has been picked for the India A side to tour England. It would help Sarfaraz's case that both Devdutt Padikkal, who was preferred ahead of him in the first BGT Test in Nov last year at the No 3 slot, and Rajat Patidar are nursing injuries. Named as the India captain for the nth time, Abhimanyu Easwaran is likely to be retained in the side as the third opener.Sources revealed that there is a though that the vastly-experienced Cheteshwar Pujara (37) could take up a 'VRS' offer if picked and retire at the end of the series, especially absence of seniors like Rohit and Kohli, but it's unlikely that the selectors and team management will go back in time as the series marks the start of the new World Test Championship cycle.Shami is expected to be ruled out but the final verdict will be taken basis the report from NCA. That leaves room for Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Siraj, Prasidh Krishna, Akash Deep and Harshit Rana as pacers. Ravindra Jadeja and Washington Sundar will be the spinning allrounders, while Nitish Kumar Reddy, who has been asked to bowl more recently by the selectors, and Shardul Thakur will be the seam bowling all-rounders. The lone specialist spinner will be Chinaman Kuldeep Yadav. The two wicketkeepers will be the out-of-form Rishabh Pant and Dhruv Jurel.The likely squad: Shubman Gill (captain), Yashasvi Jaiswal, KL Rahul, Karun Nair, Sai Sudharsan, Sarfaraz Khan, Ravindra Jadeja, Washington Sundar, Nitish Kumar Reddy, Rishabh Pant, Druv Jurel, Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Siraj, Prasidh Krishna, Akash Deep, Harshit Rana, Shardul Thakur and Kuldeep Yadav.India are set to depart for England on June 6, with the first Test of the series scheduled to begin on June 20 at Headingley in Leeds.",The national selectors meet at the bcci hq here on saturday at 1pm to pick the squad for the upcoming five-test tour of england. Gill is all set to be named as the new captain of india's red-ball team.

IPL 2025: The unsung heroes of India's T20 league

NEW DELHI: Despite a comprehensive 42-run defeat against Sunrisers Hyderabad, Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) stand-in skipper Jitesh Sharma remained optimistic, calling the loss a “good sign” ahead of the IPL 2025 playoffs.The high-scoring encounter saw Hyderabad, already out of contention, spoil RCB’s chance to top the points table. Ishan Kishan ’s unbeaten 94 off 48 balls, supported by a collective batting effort, took the Sunrisers to a massive 231/6. In response, RCB's chase showed early promise through Virat Kohli and Phil Salt, but a middle-order collapse sealed their fate.Jitesh, who led the team in Rajat Patidar ’s absence, admitted that RCB were “rusty” and lacked the early intensity.""I think it was 20-30 runs extra. They played very well. I didn't have any answers for their attack. We were rusty. The intensity was not there initially, but it's good to lose this game. In the death, we were bowling more accurately,"" he said post-match.He added that the timing of the defeat could prove valuable. “Sometimes losing a game is a very good sign because you can check and analyse. After this loss, we've got a setback to check things again.We’ll move forward.”Tim David’s injury during the final over of the first innings added to RCB’s concerns. Although the Australian bravely came out to bat despite a hamstring niggle, he was clearly struggling. “Right now, I haven't met David because I was upset I got out,” Jitesh admitted.Choosing not to dwell on negatives, Jitesh emphasised RCB’s collective performance. “The positive things are that everyone’s chipping in. Losing this game was good — we are batting well. We will bounce back in a good way in the upcoming games,” he concluded.",Royal challengers bengaluru (rcb) lost by 42 runs to sunrisers hyderabad.

Poll Will RCB secure a top-two finish in IPL 2025? Yes No

'Chances are still there': Abishek Porel believes in IPL 2025 playoff miracle

NEW DELHI: Already assured of a playoff spot, Royal Challengers Bengaluru will look to secure a top-two finish in the league stage for the first time since 2016 when they take on Sunrisers Hyderabad in their IPL 2025 clash on Friday. The last time RCB finished in the top two was during the 2016 season, which saw them end up as runners-up.Currently second on the points table with 17 points from 12 matches, RCB can potentially seal a top-two berth with wins in their remaining two fixtures.Friday’s encounter, which was initially slated as a home game for RCB, had to be shifted due to the arrival of the monsoon season.Former India cricketer Aakash Chopra weighed in on the conditions expected at the new venue — the Ekana Cricket Stadium in Lucknow — and predicted a low-scoring contest.“Don’t expect a high-scoring game – Ekana won’t allow it. It’s a big ground, not Chinnaswamy. But it’ll still be a good contest. Don’t count out SRH. That said, the dice is loaded in favor of the team Virat Kohli plays for,” Chopra said on the JioHotstar Network.He further shared his thoughts on the playoff race. “A change is coming. RCB vs PBKS – I think one of them drops a game. MI vs PBKS is also crucial. Don’t rule out SRH – they beat LSG and have game-changers.One big innings, like Marsh’s today, can shake things up. I won’t be surprised if the top four look completely different,” he said.RCB’s form has been bolstered by the outstanding run of Virat Kohli, who has struck seven half-centuries in 11 innings, providing consistent starts at the top.The team was riding a four-match winning streak before the league was disrupted due to the India-Pakistan military conflict. However, their return match after a 20-day hiatus was washed out, halting their momentum. It remains to be seen if they can recapture the rhythm and intensity that marked their pre-break performances.Chasing a long-awaited IPL title, RCB are enjoying one of their most consistent seasons in recent years.",Royal challengers bengaluru take on sunrisers hyderabad on friday.

Why the Los Angeles Lakers Would Do It

Why the Warriors Would Consider It

Theandare under pressure to make big moves this offseason. After disappointing playoff exits, both teams face tough decisions—and a surprising trade involvingcould be on the table.According to Colin Keane of Sporting News , the Warriors, led by Stephen Curry , Draymond Green, and Jimmy Butler, fell short in the Conference Semifinals against the Minnesota Timberwolves. Their lack of depth and youth was exposed, signaling a need for fresh talent.Built on LeBron James and Luka Doncic, the Lakers also had defensive issues and lost to the Timberwolves in the first round. The front staff has been compelled to explore significant retooling due to their roster imbalance.Here’s the potential deal that could shake up both franchises: Draymond Green (4-time All-Star, defensive anchor)- Dalton Knecht (young sharpshooting wing)- Rui Hachimura (expiring contract)- 2031 first-round draft pick LeBron James , now 40, is still elite, but the Los Angeles Lakers must maximize their championship window.Draymond Green’s defensive versatility and playmaking would immediately elevate their roster.- Defensive Upgrade: Green’s ability to guard multiple positions fixes a major Lakers weakness.- Leadership: His vocal presence and playoff experience would bolster the locker room.- Win-Now Move: Knecht’s potential doesn’t align with the Lakers’ urgency to contend.As writer Colin Keane noted: ""Green would be heartbroken to trade in his Warriors uniform and go somewhere else, but his positive relationship with LeBron has been well-documented.""According to Colin, trading Draymond Green would be emotional, but the Golden State Warriors must plan for life after Curry.- Future Assets: Knecht and the 2031 pick offer long-term upside.- Financial Flexibility: Hachimura’s expiring deal clears future cap space.- Youth Movement: Green’s departure accelerates a rebuild around younger talent.While this specific trade might not be enough, the Warriors should keep an open mind if better offers emerge.Both teams are at a crossroads. The Los Angeles Lakers get a proven winner in Draymond Green, while the Golden State Warriors secure assets for the future. Whether this deal happens or not, one thing is clear: major changes are coming for these franchises.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Golden State Warriors could eye $70 million Boston Celtics point guard to boster squad after unfortunate playoff exit This trade scenario remains speculative, but it highlights the tough choices ahead for both teams.

Tony Romo weighs in on the Travis Kelce-Taylor Swift phenomenon



Tony Romo believes Travis Kelce 's relationship with Taylor Swift is beneficial, asserting ""he’s probably doing less than he used to when he was younger."" Romo suggests the increased media attention masks a quieter lifestyle, arguing, ""it can be a net positive if you look at it closely. ""Former Dallas Cowboys quarterback and current CBS Sports analyst, Tony Romo, offers a unique perspective on the highly publicized relationship between Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce and pop superstar Taylor Swift. Far from viewing it as a distraction, Romo contends that the high-profile romance is a ""net positive"" for Kelce, both professionally and personally.Tony Romo, 45, who himself experienced the spotlight dating Jessica Simpson during his NFL career, suggests that the public perception of Kelce's social life might be misleading. ""People won’t even realize this, but he’s probably doing less than he used to when he was younger,” Romo exclusively told Us Weekly. He elaborates that the frequent photographs of Kelce and Swift dining out merely capture a routine activity, akin to a married couple.“If you get your picture taken going to dinner with your superstar girlfriend, it looks like you’re going out or something. No, he just went to dinner. Almost as if he’s married, going to dinner with his wife or something.He didn’t get photographed when he was going out with his buddies all the time.”According to Tom Romo, the increased media coverage actually belies a more settled existence for the athlete. “He’s far less out there. He’s doing far less things than when he was younger. It’s just the fact that if you’re written about a lot and it’s not about football, some people are always going to think that it plays a role. But the truth is that it can be a net positive if you look at it closely.”Addressing Travis Kelce's statistically modest 2024 season, which saw career lows in touchdowns and receptions, Romo believes it was a natural adjustment to the intense scrutiny. “That was his first whole season being under that microscope,” Romo noted, referencing the start of their relationship in September 2023. “It was the first full season and offseason where the public and the world knew. Like anybody, we all learn through experience and we get wiser. ”Romo expresses full confidence in Kelce's ability to navigate this new level of fame, drawing parallels to his own experiences. “Not that [Kelce] has to do anything,” Romo explained.“The guy is a [future] Hall of Famer who has played at the highest level. He’s won Super Bowls. He’s made some of the biggest plays in the most clutch situations ever. I think he’ll figure things out real quick, even if there was something to figure out. I think everyone should just put their trust in him.” He concluded by adding, “And I think he’s got himself a wonderful, wonderful girlfriend.”On a personal note, Romo, now a father of three, embraces a busy family life, finding comfort and convenience in his Skechers Hands Free Slip-ins®. “Me and my wife are taxi cab drivers these days,” Romo joked.“Going from practice to practice to pickup to games. It’s a blast. It’s really one of the great times in my life doing all of this. That’s where Skechers works because I have the slip-on shoe and can be like, ‘Oh, gotta go to the next one. Oh! Didn’t realize we had another one. Slip it on and go.’”Also Read: Did Travis Kelce just confirm he’s living with Taylor Swift?

Fans celebrate Jim Irsay’s city-wide legacy during Indianapolis’ ultimate weekend of sports and community pride,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/fans-celebrate-jim-irsays-city-wide-legacy-during-indianapolis-ultimate-weekend-of-sports-and-community-pride/articleshow/121372282.cms,"Indianapolis turns into a sports paradise as Jim Irsay’s influence echoes across the entire city (Getty Images)

Jim Irsay’s imprint turns Indianapolis into a vibrant hub of sports, music, and community spirit



Indianapolis is buzzing this Memorial Day weekend. From the roar of engines at the Indianapolis 500 to packed arenas cheering for the Indiana Pacers and WNBA’s Indiana Fever, the city has become a living testament to the dream one man helped build. As fans crowd the streets, it’s impossible to ignore the absence of Jim Irsay, the longtime Indianapolis Colts owner who passed away in his sleep at 65. His vision didn’t just transform a football franchise — it reshaped an entire city’s identity.Irsay arrived in Indianapolis in 1984, when the Colts made their dramatic midnight move from Baltimore. Back then, the city had yet to step into the sports limelight. The downtown area was a quiet place with little to offer beyond Market Square Arena. But Irsay saw more than just potential; he saw possibility. And in the decades that followed, his influence would stretch far beyond the gridiron.Mark Miles, CEO of IndyCar and Penske Entertainment, who has worked hand-in-hand with Irsay on countless city initiatives, captured the sentiment of many: “It’s incredibly sad, it’s a big ache in my heart… this weekend is sort of emblematic of what he helped build and I’m sorry he missed it,” according to AP.Indeed, this weekend isn’t just a spectacle — it’s a culmination of a vision that started with a football team and blossomed into a multi-sport renaissance. Saturday’s sold-out Fever game, headlined by rising star Caitlin Clark, Sunday morning’s Indianapolis 500 with over 350,000 expected fans, and Game 3 of the Eastern Conference Finals between the Pacers and the Knicks that same night all point back to the groundwork laid by Irsay.And his impact wasn’t confined to just owning a football team. “He was more than the owner of the Indianapolis Colts, he was a transformative figure in our city and state, a passionate advocate for the community,” said Indiana Pacers owner Herb Simon. “Jim helped shape our city into the sports capital it is today, and his legacy, both on and off the field, will continue to inspire us and generations to come.”During the early 2000s, as stadium talks heated up, Irsay never once threatened to leave Indianapolis. That unwavering loyalty spoke volumes. Miles, who also led the 1987 Pan Am Games and later the Super Bowl XLVI organizing committee, acknowledged that without Irsay’s backing, neither event would have found a home in Indy. “We would never have had a Super Bowl without Jim Irsay, without the Colts or Jim Irsay’s passion or commitment to getting it here and that never really wavered. ”Even in his final days, Irsay remained connected to the city’s heartbeat. His last tweet was a nod to another Indy sports team — a small but telling moment that reflected a man who genuinely loved the community he helped elevate.His daughter, Casey Irsay Foyt, will now carry the torch as she steps onto the Indianapolis Motor Speedway to serve as honorary starter for Sunday’s race. Along with her sisters, she represents not just the next chapter of Colts ownership but the continuation of a family deeply embedded in the city's cultural fabric.“To have his death heading into this epic sports weekend has us pausing to reflect on just how categorically he changed and enhanced the city’s skyline,” said Chris Gahl of Visit Indy. “That’s the culture he helped put in place in our city.”Jim Irsay didn’t just bring football to Indianapolis — he brought heart, ambition, and a vision that turned Indiana No Place into Indiana Some Place. And this weekend, every cheer, every footstep, and every celebration echoes his legacy.Also Read: Fans convinced Taylor Swift may move in with Travis Kelce after his luxurious Florida mansion hint","Jim irsay, the longtime indianapolis colts owner, passed away in his sleep at 65.

Florida Panthers’ Sam Reinhart injury sparks concern amid 2-0 Eastern Conference final lead over Hurricanes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/florida-panthers-sam-reinhart-injury-sparks-concern-amid-2-0-eastern-conference-final-lead-over-hurricanes/articleshow/121366282.cms,"Sam Reinhart’s injury threatens Panthers’ Stanley Cup run (Image via: Getty Images)

Reinhart ’s injury threatens Florida Panthers’ Stanley Cup hopes



The Florida Panthers grabbed a commanding 2-0 lead in the Eastern Conference Final with a dominant 5-0 win over the Hurricanes. But what should’ve been a perfect night took a sharp turn when star forward Sam Reinhart exited with an injury. As one of Florida’s top playoff performers, his absence now raises serious doubts about the team’s momentum just as they inch closer to the Stanley Cup Final.Sam Reinhart, the offensive engine behind Florida’s deep playoff push, exited Game 2 early after a heavy hit from Sebastian Aho left his left leg bent unnaturally near the blue line. Though he briefly returned to the bench, Reinhart was clearly in pain and didn’t step back onto the ice for the remainder of the game. This injury comes at a critical moment, Reinhart had been on fire throughout the postseason, tallying 11 points in 13 games, including key contributions in the Panthers’ first-round sweep of Tampa Bay.The exact severity of Reinhart’s injury remains unclear as the Panthers await medical evaluations, with head coach Paul Maurice stating, “We'll get him looked at Friday. We'll get an update Saturday.” This cautious approach reflects the serious nature of the situation and the uncertainty surrounding how soon, or if, Reinhart will return to the lineup.Losing Reinhart’s scoring prowess and playmaking ability could seriously disrupt Florida’s offensive flow, especially with the Hurricanes desperate to claw back into the series. Florida has obliterated Carolina’s defense in the first two games, outscoring them 10-2 and showcasing a balance of scoring from stars like Matthew Tkachuk, Aleksander Barkov, and even role players such as Sam Bennett, who netted two goals in Game 2.Also Read: Jordan Staal criticizes Hurricanes’ performance after devastating game 2 loss to Florida Panthers The Panthers’ strong start may hide a fragile truth, if Reinhart’s injury keeps him out, Florida’s offense could lose its edge. The team will face increased pressure to maintain their pace as the series returns home for Game 3. With a chance to secure a third straight Stanley Cup Final appearance, all eyes will be on Reinhart’s medical update and whether Florida can keep its momentum without him.",Florida panthers forward sam reinhart was injured in game 2 of the eastern conference final against the carolina hurricanes.

Offense and defense can stealthily propel Pittsburgh Steelers into playoff conversation

Mike Tomlin has been the head coach of the Pittsburgh Steelers since 2007. During all these years, he never had a losing season, which is very rare in the NFL. Nevertheless, he has never received the NFL Coach of the Year award. Numerous individuals within the football community now think that 2025 may be the year Mike Tomlin will at last receive that recognition. Next season is not shaping up to be an easy one for the Steelers , but that might just benefit Mike Tomlin's argument.This season, the Pittsburgh Steelers are not regarded as a strong team by most analysts. This past May of 2025, prior to the season beginning, analysts on NFL Network and ESPN were forecasting that the Pittsburgh Steelers could only go 9-8 this season.The team made some puzzling moves during the offseason. They traded wide receiver Diontae Johnson on March 12, 2025, for draft picks in the future. They did not bring in a definitive top quarterback either, though Aaron Rodgers rumors were the talk in early April.In spite of this, Mike Tomlin is unshaken. At a press conference on May 5, 2025, in Pittsburgh, he stated, ""Every season has new challenges. That's part of the job.But I believe in this group.""His optimism has players and fans anxiously observing. If Mike Tomlin is able to get this team into the playoffs, it will be difficult for the league to disregard his work.The Pittsburgh Steelers have made some adjustments that may serve them well. Offensive coordinator Arthur Smith has constructed a scheme that plays to the strengths of quarterback Mason Rudolph.Running back Jaylen Warren and rookie Kaleb Johnson are impressive. Tight end Pat Freiermuth and wide receiver D.K. Metcalf will be a major target.The defense is younger now, with new faces on the line and depth at linebacker. There are questions in the secondary, but Mike Tomlin said on May 10 via Steelers.com, “We’ll clean things up in camp.”","Mike tomlin has been the head coach of the pittsburgh steelers since 2007.

Auston Matthews and his fans got emotional as his mother opened up about the financial struggles of getting him into hockey,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/auston-matthews-and-his-fans-got-emotional-as-his-mother-opened-up-about-the-financial-struggles-of-getting-him-into-hockey/articleshow/121166477.cms,"Image credit - Paige Taylor White/CP

Auston Matthews’ hockey dream wasn’t cheap and his mom took the weight

“I used to work in the morning for Starbucks, in the afternoon the restaurant, i was very fortunate to have two jobs. And believe me, if they would have more hours, I would have more jobs.""





Before Auston Matthews was an NHL superstar, his biggest supporter was clocking into two jobs, trying to make ends meet. His mom, Ema Matthews, didn’t just believe in his dream, she bankrolled it, penny by penny, from behind a Starbucks counter. For families without deep pockets, hockey can be financially brutal. But Ema’s resilience turned obstacles into opportunity and her son into one of the league’s brightest stars. Her story is the heartwarming reminder that every great athlete often has a real-life superhero cheering from the sidelines, sacrificing, hustling, and holding it all together so their child can chase the impossible.Ice time, gear, coaching, travel, youth hockey isn’t just a sport, it’s a financial beast. For the Matthews family, especially with Ema being originally from Hermosillo, Mexico, the culture and cost of the sport were both daunting. But she took on the challenge without hesitation, picking up multiple jobs including a gig at Starbucks to ensure Auston never missed a chance to grow on the ice.Ema shared in a past interview that the cost of hockey often reached up to $20,000 a year, a heavy ask for any middle-class family. To make it work, she didn’t just cut corners, she picked up shifts and poured lattes while helping Auston stay focused on the sport. She even deposited small amounts of money in his account so he could grab food with teammates like a regular teen.Ema’s story also breaks stereotypes. In a sport dominated by players from Canada and northern U.S. states, Auston’s rise as a player of Mexican heritage makes his success even more impactful. It's not just about talent, it’s about trailblazing, especially for kids of color or immigrant families who rarely see themselves represented in hockey.Auston Matthews is one of the Toronto Maple Leafs’ biggest stars and a face of the NHL. He’s not just known for his goal-scoring skills but also for his poise and work ethic, traits his mom likely helped instill. While fans celebrate his success on the ice, stories like Ema’s remind us of the sacrifices behind the scenes that made it possible.Ema Matthews’ story shows what’s possible when love, grit, and hustle lead the way.Also read - “From baptism to strip club”: Pete Blackburn’s unhinged NHL comparison is going viral and fans totally get it","Auston matthews is one of the toronto maple leafs’ biggest stars and a face of the nhl.

Greenstone Lobo predicts Virat Kohli & Rohit Sharma's ODI future

NEW DELHI: India head coach Gautam Gambhir has finally broken his silence on the high-profile retirements of Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli from Test cricket, calling it a personal choice and urging respect for their decisions.Speaking ahead of India’s five-Test tour of England, which begins on June 20 in Leeds, Gambhir addressed the vacuum left by the exit of two of India’s modern greats.“I think when you start the game and when you want to finish, it’s a very individual decision,” Gambhir said in an interview with CNN-News18. “No one has the right — be it the coach, the selector, or anyone in this country — to tell someone when to retire. It comes from within.”Both Rohit and Kohli stepped away from the longest format earlier this month, ending a chapter of Indian cricket that spanned over a decade.Though Gambhir admitted the team would miss their experience, he emphasised the opportunity this moment presents for the younger players. “Yes, it will be tough, but then there’ll be people putting their hands up for sure,” he said. “Someone missing out might give another person an opportunity to do something special for the country.”He cited India’s Champions Trophy win without Jasprit Bumrah as proof that the team can succeed despite the absence of senior names.As per reports, the BCCI is expected to announce the Test squad and India’s new red-ball captain on Saturday, with Gambhir and chief selector Ajit Agarkar addressing the media.","India head coach gautam gambhir has finally broken his silence on the high-profile retirements of rohit sharma and virat kohli from test cricket.

And being retired, he doesn't require any special dispensation to play in the Olympics as active NFL players do.Although NFL owners recently voted to allow current players to participate, Brady doesn't require that rule to be extended to him.Tom Brady is famous for maintaining a strict schedule and being physically fit.

LeBron James clinched a historic milestone, surpassing Michael Jordan



The 40-year-old LeBron James is still making waves in the NBA. In his 22nd season, the Los Angeles Lakers star achieved a feat no player, not even Michael Jordan , had accomplished. He became the oldest player in league history to receive regular-season MVP votes. Although the Lakers are officially out of the playoffs, James is not done making history in his name.This historic milestone of LeBron James came after LeBron finished sixth in the 2024–25 MVP race, a remarkable result considering his age and the sheer depth of competition this season. While Shai Gilgeous-Alexander rightfully earned the award, with 913 total points, and Nikola Jokic and Giannis Antetokounmpo rounded out the top three, James quietly edged past younger superstars like Stephen Curry, Anthony Edwards, and Jalen Brunson to claim a top-six finish. His final tally of 16 MVP points came from one fourth-place vote and several fifth-place nods.It wasn’t the most dominant statistical season of his career, but LeBron’s impact on the Lakers remained undeniable. Averaging 24.4 points, 7.8 rebounds, and 8.2 assists over 70 games, he led the Lakers to the third seed in the Western Conference. His elite-level gameplay is still hard to ignore.In the historical context, Michael Jordan, considered by many as the greatest of all time, previously held the record for being the oldest player to receive MVP votes, aged 39 years and 3 months, during his stint with the Washington Wizards in the 2001–02 season.LeBron, now 40 years and 4 months old, has surpassed that mark.LeBron James is now both the youngest (19 years, 4 months) and oldest (40 years, 4 months) player in NBA history to receive MVP votes. He first earned MVP recognition during his rookie season in 2003–04, finishing sixth with 93 points behind Steve Nash.Also Read: LeBron James' agent on Los Angeles Lakers star's future: ""It's not the physical aspect, it's where you're at mentally"" Of course, it was another great feat of the Lakers legend, directly standing in line with NBA icon Jordan. James seemingly has one or more seasons in his sleeves, and many records will be added to his name, making him one of the greatest of all time, if not the greatest. Despite retirement rumors after this season, James is holding on to his career as he dismissed the rumor.","Lebron james became the oldest player in nba history to receive regular-season mvp votes.

WWE Superstar Zoey Stark made her comeback to the limelight in a tragic manner on the recent episode of Monday Night RAW. What was supposed to be a critical milestone in her career, Stark got severely injured in her knee in a triple-threat qualifying match for the 2025 Women's Money in the Bank (MITB) ladder match. The incident has not only sidelined her from one of WWE’s most prestigious events but may also signal a prolonged absence from in-ring competition.The accident occurred at the Bon Secours Wellness Arena in Greenville, South Carolina, during a MITB qualifier bout between Zoey Stark, Kairi Sane, and Rhea Ripley. At its climax, Stark tried her characteristic springboard dropkick—a sportslike move that requires agility and accuracy. In targeting Kairi Sane, Stark slipped in executing the springboard, resulting in her awkwardly landing on her right leg.The blow caused her knee to bend in a distinctly unnatural manner, quite visibly startling both supporters and commentators. The match instantly became secondary as paramedics rushed onto the field to treat the hurt athlete. After the botched maneuver, Stark fell to the floor, cradling her right knee and exhibiting obvious signs of pain and distress. The referee stopped the match for a moment and motioned for medical attention. WWE ringside physicians made their way into the ring and evaluated her condition.Despite the extent of the injury, Stark first tried to leave the ring independently. She tried to stand, only to fall again, as she could no longer bear the weight of herself. Eventually, she was assisted backstage by medical personnel, affirming the severity of the ordeal.Veteran WWE play-by-play commentator Michael Cole guessed on-air that Stark may have re-aggravated an old injury. Stark had extensive knee surgery in 2021 to repair a torn ACL, MCL, and meniscus—injuries requiring months of rehabilitation.With the visual similarity and reaction of Stark, there is an increasing fear that her current injury is a recurrence or exacerbation of the same condition of the knee. But to date, WWE has not issued a formal medical diagnosis or recovery timeline. The wrestling fraternity came in support of Stark after the injury. AEW wrestler Thunder Rosa showed her concern with a heartfelt post on social media:""Wrestling is a lovely and risky sport. We leave everything on the table every time we go to the ring, and we also put a lot on the line when we do what we are passionate about. Zoey Stark, I love you, sister, and I hope that you heal soon."" — Thunder Rosa through X (previously Twitter)Zoey Stark's RAW match was her first on television since January. She had last remained an active member of the dissolved faction Pure Fusion Collective, after Sonya Deville and Shayna Baszler left. Stark was competing mainly in non-televised WWE house shows and sporadic Main Event tapings before this return.As a result of her earlier knee damage incurred during her stint in NXT, Stark was drafted to the main roster as part of the 2023 WWE Draft—a testament to how much the WWE believed in her promising future. The MITB qualifier was set to be a career-launching experience, which made her untimely injury so much more heartbreaking.With Stark out, the match went on between the remaining participants. Rhea Ripley took advantage of the situation, overpowering Kairi Sane and finishing the match with her characteristic Riptide finisher. The pinfall win earned Ripley a spot in the upcoming ladder match for Women's Money in the Bank, which is to be held on June 7. Ripley’s victory, however, was overshadowed by the concern surrounding Stark’s health, as WWE fans and analysts alike shifted focus to the severity of the injury.The extent of Stark’s injury remains unconfirmed by WWE, leaving her return date unknown. Given her history of severe knee damage, fans and medical experts fear that she could face another lengthy recovery process. This injury not only removes her from one of WWE’s most career-defining matches but also risks stalling the momentum she had just begun to regain.
