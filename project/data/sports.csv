Super Bowl 2026 playoff picture, odds, date, location and halftime show



Super Bowl 2026 is almost near as the NFL postseason tightens and the championship picture sharpens. Sunday’s action delivered clarity and drama in equal measure, trimming the field and pushing the league closer to crowning its next champion. Fans now have real matchups to debate, odds to track, and dates to circle as the road to February gains momentum.New England set the tone early. The Patriots handled the Houston Texans 28-16 in the AFC Divisional Round, a composed performance that underlined their playoff experience. That win locked in an AFC Championship clash with the Denver Broncos, while the NFC picture hinges on a high stakes meeting between the Chicago Bears and Los Angeles Rams. The winner earns a trip to face the Seattle Seahawks, who continue to look like the team everyone wants to avoid.The updated Super Bowl odds reflect how tight the race has become. Seattle leads the board at +145, rewarded for its balance and late season consistency. New England sits close behind at +250, proving once again that the Patriots thrive when the margin for error disappears. The Rams follow at +315, while Denver and Chicago remain longer shots at +1000 and +1600, respectively.Beyond the matchups, the calendar now matters. The 2026 Super Bowl will be played on Sunday, February 8, with kickoff scheduled for 6:30 p.m. ET. The stage is Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, California, marking the second time the venue will host the league’s biggest night after Super Bowl 50. NBC will carry the broadcast, continuing its long standing relationship with marquee NFL events.The spectacle extends well past the game itself. This year, Bad Bunny will headline the Apple Music Halftime Show. The global star behind “DeBÍ TiRAR MáS FOToS” is expected to take the stage shortly after the second quarter, likely between 5 and 5:30 p.m. PT. Fans are already buzzing about possible guest appearances, with names like Cardi B, J Balvin, Jennifer Lopez, and Ricky Martin circulating due to past collaborations.For those hoping to attend in person, tickets remain available but come at a premium. Packages through the NFL’s official hospitality partner, On Location, start around $7,100 per person, a reminder that as Super Bowl 2026 draws closer, access becomes as exclusive as the moment itself.","The 2026 super bowl will be played on sunday, february 8, with kickoff scheduled for 6:30 p.m. Et.

Bill Belichick returns to TV as ESPN adds him to national title broadcast

Bill Belichick is back on television. Just weeks after finishing a difficult first college football season at the University of North Carolina, the 73-year-old coaching legend has landed a new role with ESPN. The network confirmed that Bill Belichick will appear on the ACC Network’s broadcast of the College Football Playoff national championship game, set to be played in South Florida at Hard Rock Stadium.The game will feature the Indiana Hoosiers against the University of Miami Hurricanes and is scheduled for a 7:30 p.m. kickoff. ESPN announced that Belichick will be part of the on-air team, marking his return to TV while he continues working as head coach of the Tar Heels in Chapel Hill.ESPN said Bill Belichick will be paired with former Miami and Georgia head coach Mark Richt for the ACC Network’s coverage.The move comes only weeks after North Carolina ended a rough season with a 4–8 record, missing both a bowl game and the expanded College Football Playoff.Belichick became North Carolina’s head coach in 2025, taking his first job at the college level after leaving the New England Patriots following the 2024 NFL season.Before going to Chapel Hill, he spent months on television. He appeared on “Monday Night Football’s ManningCast” with Peyton Manning and Eli Manning and also made regular appearances on The Pat McAfee Show.Now, Bill Belichick is mixing both worlds. He is still leading North Carolina’s rebuild, but he is also stepping back into the media spotlight.ESPN’s announcement said the move brings “one of football’s greatest minds” back to the broadcast booth.Belichick is the only head coach in NFL history to win six Super Bowls with one team. He also won two more Super Bowls as a defensive coordinator with the New York Giants.While returning to television, Bill Belichick has stayed busy on the recruiting trail. One of his biggest recent moves was bringing in quarterback Billy Edwards Jr. to Chapel Hill.ESPN’s Pete Thamel reported that Edwards chose North Carolina after being granted a medical redshirt, giving him one more year of college eligibility.Billy Edwards Jr., a Virginia native, transferred to Wisconsin in August 2025 after playing at Maryland.He later suffered a knee injury and missed the rest of the season. Now, he will compete with Gio Lopez for the Tar Heels’ starting job.He will also work under Belichick and new offensive coordinator Bobby Petrino, another longtime NFL coach.The addition matters for a North Carolina team that struggled badly. The Tar Heels beat only two Power Four teams, Syracuse and Stanford, during the 2025 season.Off the field, Belichick has also faced attention around his personal life, including heavy media focus on his relationship with Jordon Hudson.Despite the noise, sources around the program say Belichick has stayed locked in on recruiting and player development.North Carolina will next hold its spring game on April 12 at Kenan Stadium, where fans will get their first look at the new roster.","Bill belichick will appear on the acc network’s broadcast of the college football playoff national championship game.

Rasmus Andersson trade reshapes Vegas and Calgary futures



Rasmus Andersson’s trade marks the end of a defining chapter in Calgary, and it reshapes the Western Conference race in one decisive stroke. The Flames have officially moved their longtime blue line anchor, retaining half of his contract, and sent him to the Vegas Golden Knights in a blockbuster deal that signals two franchises heading in very different directions.For Calgary, this moment felt inevitable. The organization has been listening, weighing, and waiting. With time still left before the 2026 trade deadline, the Flames finally acted, converting one of the league’s most valuable trade assets into future-focused returns. Vegas, meanwhile, doubled down on urgency. Sitting atop the Pacific Division, the Golden Knights chose certainty over patience and paid accordingly to strengthen a defense built for playoff battles.The trade package reflects how highly Andersson was valued across the league. Calgary receives veteran defenseman Zach Whitecloud, a 2027 first-round pick, a conditional 2027 second-round pick that escalates if Vegas wins the Stanley Cup, and defense prospect Abram Wiebe from the University of North Dakota. TSN’s Darren Dreger confirmed Calgary’s decision to retain 50 percent of Andersson’s salary, a move that maximized return while easing Vegas’s cap structure.At 29, Andersson leaves behind a decade-long run with the Flames, having grown from a steady defender into one of the NHL’s most productive right shots. This season alone, he has posted 30 points in 48 games, ranking 20th among defensemen, with 10 goals just shy of a career best. He now joins a Vegas roster designed to win now, even without a contract extension in place. His pending free agency adds intrigue, but Vegas is clearly betting that results will speak louder than paperwork.Boston’s role in the chase adds another layer. The Bruins explored the possibility, even gaining permission to discuss an extension, but restraint won out. Still in a re-tool phase, Boston chose not to sacrifice young talent and premium picks for what could have been a short-term rental. That decision cost them Andersson, but it reinforced a measured approach to roster building.For Vegas, the price was steep and deliberate. For Calgary, the return sets a new timeline. The Rasmus Andersson era is over, but for both teams, the consequences of this trade are only just beginning.","Rasmus andersson has been traded to the vegas golden knights.

Jim Cornelison national anthem delivers playoff intensity at Soldier Field



Jim Cornelison's national anthem performance echoed through Soldier Field long before the first snap, setting an emotional tone that felt bigger than football. As snow-bitten air wrapped the stadium in Chicago, fans rose early, sensing that something memorable was unfolding. This was not a routine pregame moment. It was a statement, delivered in voice and presence, before the Bears and Rams collided in a high-stakes playoff night.The crowd leaned in as the opening notes rang out, and within seconds, the atmosphere shifted. Players paused. Fans sang along. Television viewers across the country felt it too. The anthem did not just open the game, it grounded it. In a city craving another deep postseason run, the moment captured pride, history, and hope in one sweeping performance.Cornelison’s appearance came ahead of a tense NFC Divisional Round clash, with the No. 2 seed Bears chasing their first conference championship appearance since 2011. Across the field stood the No. 5 seed Rams, a franchise that last tasted Super Bowl glory in 2021 and returned hungry for another shot. Both teams had battled through the wild-card round, earning their place under the bright lights of Soldier Field.Jim Cornelison has become a familiar and trusted voice in Chicago sports, and Sunday night proved why.The 61-year-old delivered “The Star-Spangled Banner” with power and control, drawing cheers that rivaled any touchdown roar. Fans later described the performance as chilling, not because of the weather, but because of its emotional weight.NBC’s national broadcast carried the rendition to millions, giving Cornelison a stage worthy of his reputation. He has sung the anthem at Bears home openers in 2011, 2016, 2019, and 2025, along with playoff games across multiple seasons. Beyond football, he remains a fixture at Chicago Blackhawks games, where he also performs “O, Canada,” and at iconic events like the Indianapolis 500.Cornelison’s reach extends well beyond stadiums. A former member of the Lyric Opera Center for American Artists, he has performed in renowned opera houses worldwide. He also serves on the board of the Illinois Patriot Education Fund and holds the title of honorary squad commander of the U.S. Air Force Band of Mid-America.","Jim cornelison's national anthem set an emotional tone that felt bigger than football.

While the allegation has gone viral online, neither Tomlin, the NFL, nor the Steelers have confirmed it. Tomlin cited reflection and gratitude in his statement, as his wife publicly expressed pride and support.

I nfl uencer’s explosive claim clouds Mike Tomlin’s Steelers departure as NFL stays silent

When Mike Tomlin stepped away from the Pittsburgh Steelers, the football world expected reflection, legacy talk, and respectful closure. Instead, the vacuum left by his silence became a breeding ground for speculation. Within hours, social media had shifted the narrative away from football and toward a deeply personal allegation that spread faster than any official explanation.The sudden nature of the exit, paired with Tomlin’s spotless public reputation, created the perfect conditions for rumor to take hold. Influencer commentary, not league statements, began shaping public perception. What followed was not confirmation, but noise. Loud, unverified, and impossible to ignore.Instagram personality Harold White ignited the controversy by repeating claims he said were circulating privately. None have been verified by NFL, the Pittsburgh Steelers, or Mike Tomlin himself. Still, the language of certainty fueled virality.""Why is there a rumor going around about the real reason that Mike Tomlin stepped down from coaching the Pittsburgh Steelers is because he got a side woman pregnant while his wife has cancer and he broke the personal conduct rule or something,"" White said.""And so they trying to keep everything hush.”“Rumor is gaining traction even down to people, they're saying that this woman was a bartender. ... People that work with her are verifying this and they saying that he paid her $3.5 million to stay quiet. I'm getting DMs, people saying this is true, that this is out of Newcastle, Pittsburgh. They have even dropped pictures, allegedly of Tomlin with this mistress.""Tomlin’s actual departure statement struck a sharply different tone. “After much thought and reflection, I have decided to step down as head coach of the Pittsburgh Steelers. This organization has been a huge part of my life for many years, and it has been an absolute honor to lead this team. I am deeply grateful to Art Rooney II and the late Ambassador Rooney for their trust and support.”After 19 seasons, a Super Bowl title, and zero losing records, Tomlin’s résumé remains untouched by scandal in official channels. His wife, Kiya Tomlin, responded with pride and gratitude, not defensiveness. That contrast matters.Until facts replace speculation, this story remains a reminder of how quickly influence can outpace truth in modern sports culture.","Mike tomlin stepped down as head coach of the pittsburgh steelers.

Harshit Rana press conference: 'Team wants to groom me as an all-rounder'

Harshit Rana recently shared a light moment that perfectly captures Virat Kohli ’s playful side, taking fans back to the celebrations after India’s 2025 Champions Trophy triumph.Recalling the scenes inside the dressing room after the final, Rana said he was part of the squad but did not play the match. When he walked in after the win, he found himself meeting Anushka Sharma for the very first time.“I entered the dressing room, and Anushka Sharma was also there. I was meeting her for the first time. So I called her ‘ma’am’,” Rana said while speaking to MensXP.That, however, quickly turned into a joke at Rana’s expense. Kohli , never one to miss an opportunity for humour, immediately stepped in. “Then he told me, ‘tu ma’am kyu bol raha hai inko? Bhabhi bol inko’,” Rana recalled, laughing at the memory.Rana explained that he tried to justify himself, given it was their first interaction. “I told him that I am meeting her for the first time,” he said. Kohli was not done yet. “Then he told her that I am like that, and just some time ago I poured champagne on him, and I am calling you ma’am now.”When asked if Kohli is really as funny as he sometimes appears on camera, Rana did not hesitate. “A lot, he likes jokes a lot,” he said.Kohli has long been known for his intense and driven approach on the field, especially during his time as India’s captain, when the team reached new standards of fitness and competitiveness.But stories like these underline another side to him, a leader who enjoys keeping the dressing room atmosphere light and relaxed.Rana, meanwhile, has been steadily carving out his place among India’s emerging fast bowlers since making his international debut in 2024. After making his mark with KKR in the IPL, he was part of India’s 2025 Asia Cup-winning squad and has become a trusted option for Shubman Gill in the ongoing ODI series against New Zealand.","Harshit rana recently shared a light moment that perfectly captures virat kohli ’s playful side.

Jalen Williams suffers another injury setback after exiting Heat loss with hamstring issue

Thunder face mounting injury concerns as Jalen Williams and Isaiah Hartenstein remain sidelined

Due to a right hamstring strain, forward Jalen Williams will not play for the Oklahoma City Thunder against the Cleveland Cavaliers on the road on Monday. Williams was hurt in the second quarter of Oklahoma City's 122-120 road defeat to the Miami Heat on Saturday.He is classified as out for Monday's road game against Cleveland at 1:30 p.m. CST, but a date for his recovery has not yet been provided. After having their five-game winning streak ended on Saturday in Miami, Oklahoma City is trying to get back on track on Monday, but the Thunder will have a hard time getting back on track due to their injury report. OKC will probably rely on Ajay Mitchell.Jalen Williams has a right hamstring strain, according to the OKC Thunder's injury report released on Sunday. However, Williams has only appeared in 24 of Oklahoma City's 43 games this season due to injury.Midway through the second quarter of Oklahoma City's 122-120 loss to the Miami Heat on Saturday night, Williams left the game due to what the Thunder at the time described as thigh soreness.Williams had a terrible setback after missing the first 19 games of the season due to a right shooting wrist injury that necessitated two surgeries.The All-NBA forward averages 4.8 rebounds, 5.6 assists, and 16.8 points.Jalen Williams turned the corner downhill from a Chet Holmgren screen in the middle of the second quarter of a game in which he looked more like himself than at any other point this season. As the defense collapsed on him, he attempted to loft a pass to Holmgren, but it sailed out of bounds as Williams reached for the back side of his leg, hobbling the baseline and remaining on that end of the court unable to get back on defense.The 2022 lottery pick was able to gather himself under the hoop and limp to the locker room as the Oklahoma City Thunder called a timeout during the Heat's five-on-four possession. Due to pain in his right thigh, the squad decided to bench him for the second half in South Beach.Since the Thunder selected him 12th overall in the 2022 draft, the fourth-year professional, who was an All-Star last season, has averaged 18.0 points, 4.6 rebounds, 4.4 assists, and 1.4 steals per game in 239 games.Isaiah Hartenstein, the Thunder's big man, was also sidelined for the 12th consecutive game due to a calf injury. How long the reigning NBA champions will be without their all-star forward is unclear.With 16.8 points per game, Williams is third on the club. He also averages 5.6 assists, 4.8 rebounds, and 1.3 steals. Two of OKC's regular starters are now out. Due to a right soleus (calf) injury, Isaiah Hartenstein will also miss his 12th consecutive game on Monday.Darius Garland is expected to lose a lengthy amount of time for the Cavaliers due to a right great toe sprain, thus Cleveland is also short-staffed going into this game. For this midday match, Max Strus and Sam Merrill will accompany him in street attire.","Jalen williams has a right hamstring strain, according to the okc thunder's injury report released on sunday.

Nick Foles offers calm perspective that sparks hope for Broncos Country after Bo Nix injury



The Denver Broncos are approaching the AFC Championship Game under circumstances few expected just a week ago. Rookie quarterback Bo Nix suffered a season ending ankle injury in the divisional round, forcing Denver to quickly rethink its postseason approach. The loss of their starting quarterback has naturally shifted expectations and created uncertainty around the offense.With kickoff drawing closer and emotions still fresh, Broncos Country has been searching for reassurance. While the team has turned to its depth chart for answers on the field, perspective from outside the locker room has also helped steady the mood ahead of a matchup that now carries even more weight.Former NFL quarterback Nick Foles provided that perspective with a thoughtful social media message on Sunday evening. Drawing from his own experience, Foles acknowledged how difficult the moment feels for players and fans alike while pointing to a reason for cautious optimism.“Note for the Broncos and their fans: I know it has been an emotional 24 hours,” Foles tweeted. “I feel for Bo and the team, and I'm sending prayers for a strong recovery.A positive note going into the game versus the Patriots is that they struggle against backup QBs in championship-type games.”The message resonated as Foles has experienced almost the same case. In the 2017 season, he replaced an injured Carson Wentz and proceeded to bring the Philadelphia Eagles into a Super Bowl victory over New England. His post season performance is one of the most memorable performances by a backup quarterback who succeeds on the biggest stage.It is now left to Jarrett Stidham who will be making his first career postseason start. It is even more engaging with the plot when Stidham is set to confront his ex-team, the New England Patriots, in a Super Bowl bid.Denver is not requesting Stidham to re-write history overnight. Rather he will be looking at execution, being calm and being dependent on the roster around him. With the approaching AFC Championship, the words of Foles have made Broncos fans change to being shocked to believing that there is still a chance, that opportunity would arise even at the most unexpected moments.",Denver broncos quarterback bo nix suffered an ankle injury in the divisional round.

The end of the NFL season can feel abrupt, especially for teams with playoff expectations. For the Los Angeles Chargers, that reality arrived quickly after their wild-card loss to the New England Patriots. While the defeat closed the book on another challenging year for Justin Herbert , the week unfolded very differently for someone close to him.As Herbert processed the disappointment of an early playoff exit, his girlfriend, Madison Beer, was celebrating a major career moment. The singer released her new album, Locket, on Friday, and the rollout came with a highly visible spotlight. An advertisement for the album appeared on a Times Square jumbotron in New York City, marking a milestone moment in her music career.Beer shared photos of the Times Square display on her Instagram story, pairing the photos with her song “For the Night.” The timing stood out. While Herbert’s season had just ended in frustration, Beer was enjoying one of the biggest promotional moments of her career. The Chargers’ playoff run ended with a loss to New England, despite the team making it back to the postseason. Herbert struggled to find consistency during the game and finished with 159 passing yards.Afterward, he addressed his performance honestly in his postgame comments. ""I didn't play weel enough and didn't make any plays,"" Herbert said. ""We let the defense down today.""The loss marked Herbert’s third career playoff appearance, but once again, the Chargers failed to reach the divisional round. It added to the growing pressure surrounding a quarterback who has delivered strong regular-season play but has yet to make a deep postseason run.Earlier in the week, Beer had another milestone moment when she appeared on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. The performance came just ahead of the album release and marked her debut on the late-night stage. She later shared photos and videos from the appearance on Instagram with a caption that captured her excitement. ""oh what a night! bad enough debut on @fallontonight""For the show, Beer wore an off-white halter-neck dress with a fitted silhouette and a high slit, drawing attention as she promoted her new music. Herbert and Beer confirmed their relationship publicly in October, when they were seen sharing a kiss on the sidelines before a Chargers game against Washington. Since then, Beer has regularly been spotted supporting Herbert at games, including a Week 17 appearance against the Houston Texans.As Herbert heads into another offseason focused on improvement and answers, Beer’s career continues to gain momentum.","Madison beer released her new album, locket, on friday.

Nicol Delago’s breakthrough and Lindsey Vonn’s experience light up Tarvisio



Italy’s alpine ski team continues its strong run with less than three weeks left before the Milan-Cortina Winter Olympics. On Saturday, Nicol Delago delivered a landmark moment by winning her first World Cup race in the downhill on home snow in Tarvisio. The result added to the growing confidence around the Italian camp as Olympic preparations enter the final stretch.The race also underlined the remarkable form of Lindsey Vonn . At 41, the American legend finished third, securing her fifth podium in five downhill races this season. With the Olympics approaching in Italy, both Delago’s breakthrough victory and Vonn’s consistency sent a strong message to the rest of the field.Nicol Delago topped the timing sheets with a winning margin of 0.20 seconds over Germany’s Kira Weidle-Winkelmann. Lindsey Vonn followed closely, just 0.26 seconds behind the Italian. Delago had shown strong signs earlier by leading the final training session on Friday. Until now, her best World Cup results had been three second-place and two third-place finishes. Her younger sister, Nadia Delago, who won Olympic bronze in downhill at the 2022 Beijing Games, finished 10th in this race.The Tarvisio downhill returned to the World Cup calendar for the first time in 15 years. Vonn was one of only two skiers in the field with prior racing experience on the course. In her earlier appearances at Tarvisio across different disciplines, she had recorded two victories and four second-place finishes. After the race, Vonn explained that while the track itself felt unfamiliar, she clearly remembered the electric atmosphere.Talking about the race, it was quite challenging due to fog hanging over the middle section of the course, reducing visibility. Delago briefly lost control when her skis split apart in the fog but recovered quickly. She then increased her lead at every split and celebrated joyfully at the finish. Vonn posted the fastest speeds at both checkpoints, reaching 136.3 kph, but a slight detour into fresh snow cost her time.In the downhill standings, Vonn extended her lead to 144 points over Emma Aicher. She also moved up to third overall with 510 points. The Olympic downhill in Cortina is set for February 8, with a super-G scheduled in Tarvisio on Sunday.","Nicol delago wins her first world cup downhill on home snow in tarvisio.

Cardi B’s post-rhinoplasty look

When Grammy-winning rapper Cardi B was spotted in a Gillette Stadium VIP suite, cheering on her boyfriend Stefon Diggs with New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft, we knew something was amiss. Something was pin pointing to their shared history. But who would go back and turn the pages of history? No worries. We’ve done that for all.The “Bodak Yellow” singer was spotted dancing with the Patriots owner at a Fanatics party during Super Bowl LIII weekend in Atlanta in 2019. Cardi was scheduled to perform at Michael Rubin’s Fanatics party at the College Football Hall of Fame.The “Am I the Drama?” creator co-headlined the event with rapper Meek Mill, who partnered with Kraft on Reform Alliance, a criminal justice reform organization supported by Jay-Z and Van Jones.In a 2019 appearance on 98.5 The Sports Hub’s “Toucher and Rich” program [now, it’s Toucher & Hardy], Kraft discussed forging relationships with the hip-hop community.“Honest to goodness, I don’t force it,” Kraft said. “We live in a world where all of us have to find ways to build bridges and connect with everybody. There’s good in every situation, and you try to understand it and relate to it.That’s how you understand how the world works, when you try to keep people together to win championships, which is not easy, guys.”The Patriots had beaten the Los Angeles Rams 13-3 and won Super Bowl LIII. It was the sixth and final Super Bowl win for Tom Brady as a Patriot. He won his seventh Super Bowl as a Buccaneer. Anyway, coming back to Kraft and Cardi B. What happened at the party?Kraft danced to Cardi B’s performance on her song “Money.” Describing the dance with Offset’s ex-wife, Kraft said, “Meek Mill kept saying, ‘You gotta go out there. You gotta go out there. They don’t think you can dance.’Once someone puts you on the defensive, they don’t expect me to follow the beat, not that I had much rhythm. I don’t think most of my colleagues expect to see me Super Bowl weekend hanging with Cardi B and trying to show her a few moves.”Dov Kleiman, an NFL aggregator, shared a wholesome picture of Kraft and Cardi taken six years after their first meeting. Notable changes: The owner has reportedly lost a few pounds, while the “I Like It” singer is sporting her post-Rhinoplasty look.Diggs’ partner underwent a nose job [rhinoplasty] in 2020. She tried non-surgical nose fillers around 2018-2019, but they made her nose look longer and wider. So, she had corrective surgery in 2020 because the fillers backfired.“I always felt like I had a big nose,” Cardi said via The Glow Memo’s Michelle Villett. “Even before I was famous, I was like, ‘Damn, I’ve got my daddy’s nose.’ I was always afraid to do my nose, and I finally took the step.”Also Read: Stefon Diggs scans the stands searching for Cardi B after New England Patriots’ big 42-10 win over New York Jets",New england patriots owner robert kraft and rapper cardi b were spotted together at super bowl liii.

Allan Donald on Virat Kohli’s legacy: Can he reach 100 centuries?

Poll What do you think is India's biggest area for improvement after the recent ODI series against New Zealand? Batting depth Bowling consistency Fielding performance Strategic decisions

NEW DELHI: India captain Shubman Gill struck a candid and reflective note after his side slumped to a 41-run defeat against New Zealand in the series-deciding ODI on Sunday, admitting that while Virat Kohli ’s batting continues to be a massive positive, the team still has “a lot of areas” that need improvement.Kohli, once again, stood tall in adversity, smashing a record-extending 54th ODI century — his 85th international hundred — but his valiant effort went in vain as India were bowled out for 296 in 46 overs while chasing a stiff target of 338 at the Holkar Stadium. New Zealand clinched the series after India had entered the contest level at 1-1.“After the first match, coming here 1-1, the way we played — a bit disappointed,” Gill said at the post-match presentation. “Lots of areas that need some improvement. There are areas we need to look back, reflect and do better.”Despite the defeat, Gill was quick to underline the positives, led, inevitably, by Kohli’s form. “The way Virat bhai is batting, that’s definitely a plus always,” the skipper said, acknowledging the senior batter’s consistency and impact even as results eluded the team.India’s chase had unravelled early at 71 for four, but Kohli revived hopes with a fighting 124 off 108 balls, laced with 10 fours and three sixes.He stitched together an 88-run stand with Nitish Kumar Reddy (53) and later added 99 runs for the seventh wicket with Harshit Rana (52), briefly keeping India in the hunt.Gill also praised Rana’s all-round contribution, particularly his batting down the order. “The way Harshit has batted in this series, batting at No. 8 is not easy, but the way he stepped up and the way our fast bowlers have bowled in this series has been pretty good,” he said.On Nitish Kumar Reddy, Gill stressed that opportunities would continue with an eye on the bigger picture. “Keeping the World Cup in mind and where it’s going to be, we want to give him opportunities and we want to give him enough overs when he’s out there and just see what kind of combinations work for us and what kind of deliveries work for him as well.”Kohli’s hundred added several milestones to his glittering career. It was his seventh ODI century against New Zealand — the most by any batter — and his 10th hundred overall against the Kiwis across formats. He also surpassed Ricky Ponting to become the leading run-scorer in ODIs at No. 3.",India captain shubman gill says there are areas that need improvement.
