Dak Prescott believes the Cowboys are close to competing with the Eagles

Dak Prescott believes the Dallas Cowboys are close to matching the Philadelphia Eagles’ level and says it's their turn to win a Super Bowl . Despite playoff struggles, he’s confident in the team’s potential, especially with new offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer. The rivalry with the Philadelphia Eagles remains intense, and Dak Prescott sees progress.Dak Prescott praised the Philadelphia Eagles for earning their championship but emphasized that the Dallas Cowboys are close to matching their level. He acknowledged the Eagles' success while expressing confidence that Dallas can compete with them.""I feel like we compete with the Eagles and beat them for the most part when we play them. I don't want to say check the record when they're the guys holding the trophy right now, so credit to them, they've earned it and they deserve it by all means. But yeah, very close,"" said Prescott.In the 2024 season, the Cowboys were beaten badly by the Eagles in both games, with losses of 34-6 at home and 41-7 away, totaling a 75-13 point difference. Prescott was injured and missed both matchups, so the Cowboys played without their star quarterback. However, in 2023, with Prescott healthy, the two teams split their season series, each winning one game, showing how much closer the competition is when Prescott is on the field.Despite the Cowboys' recent playoff struggles, with a 2-5 record and no progress beyond the divisional round, Dak Prescott remains optimistic about their future. He believes in the team's potential, especially with the hiring of Brian Schottenheimer as the new head coach.

FOX Sports reporter Erin Andrews has never been shy about her love for Taylor Swift . A self-proclaimed Swiftie , Andrews has often expressed her admiration for the global superstar, even sharing how magical her experience was when she attended Swift’s Eras Tour in London. However, beyond being a devoted fan of Swift’s music, Andrews has also praised the singer for influencing gameday fashion and making it fashionable for women to embrace both sports and style.Recently, Erin Andrews once again showered Swift with appreciation, emphasizing how the pop icon has “made it cool” for women to love sports while looking great. But perhaps what excites the veteran sports reporter even more is Swift’s relationship with Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce. Andrews has been an outspoken supporter of the high-profile romance, even predicting that the couple might be on the verge of a major milestone.In a recent interview at the NFL’s Super Bowl shop in New Orleans, where she was promoting her WEAR by Erin Andrews collection, the sportscaster openly expressed her desire to see Swift and Kelce take their relationship to the next level.

I think they are so cute, and I love how they support each other. They're adorable.""Andrews and her Calm Down with Erin and Charissa podcast co-host Charissa Thompson had playfully suggested the idea of Swift and Kelce dating during an August 2024 episode, months before the couple became official. At the time, Kelce had publicly shared his disappointment at not being able to meet Swift backstage during one of her Kansas City concerts. Sensing a perfect opportunity, Thompson made a direct appeal to the singer, saying, ""Please try our friend Travis. He is fantastic.” Meanwhile, Andrews added, ""Take us up on this. Go on a date with this guy. Do it for America.""While Andrews acknowledges that she and Thompson can’t take full credit for the romance, she takes pride in having played a small role in encouraging Swift to give Kelce a chance. ""We just suggested he's such a great guy. He's so fun to be around as everybody sees. He's just got this amazing personality. He's super funny,"" Andrews recalled.As Travis Kelce and the Chiefs prepare to defend their Super Bowl title against the Philadelphia Eagles, Swift is expected to be in attendance at the Superdome in New Orleans. With all eyes on the power couple, speculation has been mounting about a possible post-game proposal. Fans are eager to see if Kelce will take this golden opportunity to pop the question, fulfilling Andrews’ wish for the couple.Also Read: Jason Kelce shrugs off extra halftime rest advantage as brother Travis Kelce gears up for fifth Super Bowl appearance With FOX Sports covering the event, Andrews may have the perfect chance to witness history unfold—both on and off the field.

Did Serena Williams disrespect her sister by performing Cripps walk at Superbowl?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/did-serena-williams-disrespect-her-sister-by-performing-cripps-walk-at-superbowl/articleshow/118177460.cms,"Serena Williams has sparked controversy after performing the Crip Walk during Kendrick Lamar ’s Super Bowl halftime show , with critics questioning whether she disrespected her late sister, Yetunde Price , who was murdered by a Crip gang member in 2003.Williams, 43, was seen dancing to Lamar’s hit “Not Like Us” during the show, which took place at New Orleans’ Caesars Superdome. Her appearance immediately drew attention, as she executed the signature footwork associated with the Crips, a gang with deep ties to Compton, California—the same city where her sister was killed in a drive-by shooting.Yetunde Price, the oldest half-sister of Serena and Venus Williams, was shot and killed on September 14, 2003, in Compton. A personal assistant to the Williams sisters and a nurse, Price was caught in gunfire by Robert Maxfield, a known Crip gang member. She was just 31 years old. Maxfield was later convicted of voluntary manslaughter and sentenced to 15 years in prison.Williams’ Super Bowl performance was met with mixed reactions, with some praising her participation in Lamar’s high-energy set, while others condemned her for what they saw as a thoughtless gesture. The Crip Walk, or C-Walk, has long been associated with the Los Angeles-based gang, making her decision particularly controversial given her family's history with gang violence.American columnist Jason Whitlock on his 'Fearless' podcast lashed out at Serena calling her a ""clown"".Speaking about her appearance, Williams revealed that Lamar personally invited her to join the performance. “When @kendricklamar and team called and was like ‘we’ve been trying to do something forever, what about this? We loved your Crip Walk at the Olympics after you won the gold medal,’” she wrote. “I’m like Super Bowl? Are you serious? When in the world would I ever be able to dance at a Super Bowl? (Never) let’s do it!”Williams had previously performed the Crip Walk after her victory over Maria Sharapova in the 2012 London Olympics, which had also drawn criticism at the time. Reflecting on her Super Bowl appearance, she joked, “Man, I did not Crip Walk like that at Wimbledon. Oh, I would’ve been fined.”However, not everyone saw it as lighthearted. Sports analysts and social media users pointed out the uncomfortable link between her dance and her sister’s murder. One ESPN commentator accused Williams of “trolling” her reported ex, Drake, who was the target of Lamar’s diss track “Not Like Us.” Others, however, believed Williams was simply celebrating her Compton roots and supporting Lamar, another Compton native, in a career-defining moment.","Serena williams performed the crip walk during kendrick lamar's super bowl halftime show.

NEW DELHI: Coach Gautam Gambhir stated on Wednesday that ""world-class"" Mohammed Shami and other fast bowlers will have an opportunity as a result of Jasprit Bumrah 's absence from India's Champions Trophy squad.India's hopes of winning the title were severely damaged after Bumrah was disqualified from the 50-over competition that begins February 19 in Pakistan and Dubai.In a perfect tune-up to the Champions Trophy , India, the top-ranked team in ODI cricket, crushed England by 142 runs in the final game to win the series 3-0.However, following India's victory in Ahmedabad, Bumrah 's lower back ailment continued to be the topic of conversation.""If he's injured, he's injured, whether it's me, whether it's the captain, we can't do much about it,"" Gambhir told reporters.""Obviously, we know that he's an important factor.

Sachin Tendulkar Exclusive Interview: On ISPL, memories of tennis ball cricket and more

NEW DELHI: Virat Kohli is unlikely to lead the Royal Challengers Bengaluru ( RCB ) in the upcoming edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL). It is reliably learnt that Kohli, who earlier held discussions with the management during the time of leadership vacuum, may not take up the role for IPL 2025 .With Kohli giving strong indications to the management, the think tank have been in a huddle for the last few weeks. Their entire auction strategy seemed to have revolved around Kohli and now that he may not take the job, the franchise has no option but to look within the group as they didn't show any desire to get a captain at the mega auction.It is further understood that the management has already had multiple discussions with senior India players in the RCB camp and Rajat Patidar has emerged as the frontrunner to lead the franchise from the 2025 edition. Krunal Pandya, who has proven captaincy credentials, is also an option as he always has been in the ""leadership plans"" of the franchise.It is learnt that the RCB management rates Krunal's leadership acumen very highly too and the all-rounder, who has been doing a stellar job as Baroda captain in the domestic circuit, continues to be part of the leadership group.RCB have sent an invite for a ""special media gathering for key announcement"" on February 13 and a captaincy announcement is likely. Director of Cricket Mo Babat, Head Coach Andy Flower and some key representatives of the franchise will be in attendance.There is also a possibility of mentor and batting coach Dinesh Karthik being present as he, too, played a key role in solving the captaincy puzzle.Patidar led Madhya Pradesh to Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy final this year where they lost to Mumbai in the title clash. He was the second-highest run-getter this season with 428 runs in nine innings.","Virat kohli is unlikely to lead the royal challengers bengaluru ( rcb ) in the upcoming edition of the indian premier league (ipl) it is reliably learnt that kohli, who earlier held discussions with the management during the time of leadership vacuum, may not take up the role for ipl 2025.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118186630,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-32450,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Tired of too many ads? go ad free now

SA20 league commissioner Graeme Smith and the various ambassadors such as AB de Villiers, Jacques Kallis and Allan Donald have no hesitation in accepting that Indian Premier League (IPL) is the biggest T20 league in the world. And it is an accurate statement in a lot of metrics - viewership, fan attendance, prize money, salaries, revenues and in the intangibles such as attracting the best local and international talent.IPL even has the capacity - and the might - to ensure that no other T20 league happens during its two month window. For those eight or so weeks, international cricket nearly grinds to a halt too. That is for another day, for another article.For the purpose of this article, we look at what IPL can learn from the SA20, which concluded its third edition on Saturday.With MI Cape Town crowned champions in front of over 22,000 fans, it was a proud moment for former South Africa captain Graeme Smith . Not so long ago, South African cricket was struggling to get fans through the turnstiles. Cricket, the third most popular sport in the country after rugby and football, has turned a leaf, induced in large parts by the franchise-based T20 competition.The loyalty shown by the fans has even taken Smith by surprise as the St George's Park had a lot of Orange & yellow for Joburg Super Kings and a covering of blue for MI Cape Town.""I think fan loyalty has amazed me this year, when I've arrived in stadiums and seen, you know, the Orange Army in PE or yellow in Joburg and blue, that's actually surprised me, how fast people have got behind their teams. And, you know, almost in the India style, where they're not even cheering the opposition's success. So that's been amazing,"" said Smith, who played for Pune Warriors India and Rajasthan Royals in the IPL, in an exclusive conversation with TimesofIndia.com.AB de Villiers believes the timing of the SA20 could not have come at a more fitting time for South African cricket. He added that the weather plays a big role in bringing people by the thousands.""It (SA20) came at a time when people were hungry to see quality cricket,"" said De Villiers, who is an SA20 Ambassador, in an interaction with select media.""I think South Africans love the outdoors and around December, January and February... It's the best time, weather wise. We love our sports. The timing of this tournament is spot on as South African cricket was going through a bit of a dip. There were some structural changes in the board, now there's a bit of consistency,"" he further explained.Even though the third edition didn't offer many edge-of-the-seat games, crowds continued to pour in huge numbers. Not many grounds can offer what the South African venues do - grassbanks, brass bands in volume, lawn chairs, barbecues and a complete family outing.Through the course of the playoff week during the SA20, St George's Park in Gqeberha, Centurion and Wanderers in Johannesburg, there was a personality to the crowd that you won't get in the IPL.At St George's Park, placed in beautiful Port Elizabeth, sitting along the coast, there's an iconic band that practices twice a week and arrives in numbers to keep the fans entertained through their African music and renditions of popular songs.They take their place on the unreserved wooden seats at one of the oldest grounds in the country and play the trumpet, the trombones, the drums and a colossal tuba.Move to Centurion and the grassbanks become more prominent. Instead of the stands, fans - many of them families - prefer plonking themselves on the lawn chairs that are allowed inside the stadium. There is a picnic atmosphere with food, beer and about 20 barbecue pits stationed by the organisers for visitors to use the grills if needed. As thousands watched the SA20 playoffs, there were youngsters who entertained themselves by throwing the rugby ball around or playing cricket of their own.

Interestingly, the difference in pricing between the grassbanks and the seated stands isn't all that much. The seated stands for a playoff game were priced at R150-R190 (Rs. 750-Rs. 950) while grass embankments were priced at R120-R150 (Rs 600-Rs 750).Not far away from the Centurion is the Wanderers. When trying to enter, there are the segregating barricades that one is accustomed to while entering stadium venues in India but what differs is the ease of entry.After scanning the barcodes of tickets, with gates opening as early as three hours in advance on the day of the final, fans are free to buy food, drinks, dance their way through the evening with plenty of activities for the spectator - such as the brass band on entry, selfie point in front of a board bearing Sachin Tendulkar's name and photos with people in costumes.

Then there are a couple of common themes across the stadiums to keep everyone entertained. It ranges from dance cams, lookalike cams, to hilarious face morphers. This is besides the massive prize money on offer to fans who take a single-handed catch.Further, the food and beverages are modestly priced at the stadiums - a near-luxury at the IPL and even at the European, American sports facilities. A giant pizza slice was priced at R90 (~ Rs 422), a burger at R65 (~ Rs 304) or a bag of popcorn at R20 (~Rs 93).As a result, SA20 ensures there is an atmosphere for the ardent cricket fan and something for the entire family - young or old. IPL, in this regard, has a long way to go.","The sa20 concluded its third edition on saturday. Mi cape town were crowned champions in front of over 22,000 fans.

Matthew Breetzke 's record of most runs by a batsman in his first two one-day internationals, which was 150 and 83, was eclipsed by the hundreds that Rizwan and Salman scored.South Africa had amassed an impressive 352-5 thanks to Breetzke's innings.Salman and Rizwan put together a game-changing partnership of 260, setting a new record for Pakistan's fourth wicket, surpassing the 206 put up by Younis Khan and Shoaib Malik against India at Centurion in 2009.As they surpassed Pakistan's previous best successful chase of 349 against Australia in Lahore in 2022, their scorching innings should help allay concerns about the team's weak batting.Salman scored 16 boundaries and two sixes in his 103-ball knock, while Rizwan blasted nine boundaries and three sixes off 128 balls.Earlier, after South Africa won the toss, Breetzke followed up his best-ever debut score against New Zealand in Lahore on Monday with a visually appealing 84-ball 83, laced with a six and 10 boundaries.Breetzke surpassed West Indian Desmond Haynes's total of 195 runs in his first two games in 1978, before being brilliantly caught by spinner Khushdil Shah. Temba Bavuma (82) and Heinrich Klaasen (87) both contributed to the tourists' impressive score, which was unabated by Pakistan's renowned bowling assault.As the batsman tried to finish a run, irate Pakistani fast bowler Shaheen Afridi aggressively argued with Breetzke because wickets were not falling.Shaheen and his opponent made physical contact and spoke back and forth before being separated by umpire Asif Yaqoob.Two of the South African team's four changes, Tony de Zorzi (22), and Bavuma, put on 51 for the first stand. Breetzke and the captain then put together a second-wicket stand of 119.After hitting 13 boundaries in his 96-ball knock, Bavuma was run out.In the final 10 overs, the South Africans added 110 runs thanks to Klaasen's quick 56-ball knock, which included three sixes and eleven boundaries.With 44 and 15, respectively, Kyle Verreynne and Corbin Bosch were still in the game, helping South Africa surpass 350.",Pakistan beat south africa by six wickets to reach tri-series final in karachi.

NEW DELHI: Shubman Gill produced a brilliant seventh ODI century, whilst Virat Kohli secured a vital fifty as India defeated England by 142 runs in the final match to achieve a 3-0 series sweep, perfectly concluding their Champions Trophy preparations on Wednesday.Gill's splendid 112 from 102 balls was the standout performance, whilst Kohli (52) and Shreyas Iyer (78) played crucial roles in helping India post an imposing 356 after being asked to bat first.The Indian bowling unit subsequently took control, dismissing England for 214 in 34.2 overs to secure their second-largest ODI victory by runs against this opposition.England's familiar pattern continued as they faltered against spin following a bright start against pace from Ben Duckett (34) and Phil Salt (24).The pitch's reduced pace assisted the Indian bowlers as scoring became increasingly challenging throughout the match.Duckett led England's initial charge but proved overeager. After hitting Arshdeep Singh (2/33) for four consecutive boundaries in the fifth over, he attempted another but fell to a slower knuckle ball, caught by captain Rohit Sharma at mid-off. Arshdeep then dismissed Salt with a slower bouncer, caught easily by Axar Patel.Tom Banton showed promise in his first ODI against India, executing two impressive reverse sweeps but could only manage 38 from 41 balls with four fours and two sixes.Joe Root departed for 24 when Axar (2/22) bowled him via an inside edge, whilst Harshit Rana (2/31) accelerated England's downfall by removing Harry Brook (19) and Jos Buttler (6) in quick succession.England's position deteriorated from 84/2 after 10 overs as Indian bowlers maintained pressure with regular wickets, whilst the visitors struggled despite favourable batting conditions.Earlier, Gill's fluent 112, supported by Kohli and Iyer, helped India set 357 in their final match before the Champions Trophy.Gill orchestrated India's innings with his seventh ODI century - 112 from 104 balls (14x4s, 3x6s), lifting his average above 60, whilst forming century partnerships with Kohli and Iyer.The India vice-captain achieved the distinction of scoring centuries across all international formats at the Narendra Modi Stadium, including an IPL hundred at the venue.Gill demonstrated excellent technique against both pace and spin until Adil Rashid (4/64) bowled him.Kohli gradually found his rhythm, executing several impressive shots including three boundaries off Mark Wood and Saqib Mahmood.Despite reaching his 73rd ODI fifty, Kohli struggled against Rashid, who dismissed him for the fifth time in ODIs, caught behind after scoring 52.Kohli remained 37 runs short of 14,000 ODI runs, a milestone likely to be achieved during the Champions Trophy.Rohit (1) departed early, edging Wood to Salt, whilst Iyer fell to Rashid, unnecessarily chasing a delivery down leg-side.",India defeated england by 142 runs in the final match of the odi series. Shubman gill scored a superb 112 from 102 balls to help india post 356. Virat kohli (52) and shreyas iyer (78) played crucial roles in india's victory. England were bowled out for 214 in 34.2 overs to complete a 3-0 series sweep.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118186143,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-133844,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

In total 707 runs were scored in 99 overs at the National Stadium in Karachi on Wednesday, with bats from both sides breathing fire in the ODI tri-series match between hosts Pakistan and South Africa.Led by Heinrich Klaasen (87), Matthew Breetzke (83) and captain Temba Bavuma (82), the South African team posted a formidable total of 352 for 5. But the home side successfully chased down the big target, powered by brilliant centuries from Salman Ali Agha (134) and captain Mohammad Rizwan (122 not out) with an over to spare.The six-wicket win took Pakistan to the final of the tri-series against New Zealand at the same venue on Friday, and the matches played so far in this tournament have indicated that the ICC Champions Trophy is going to be full of runs.The two venues used for the tri-series -- Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore and the National Stadium in Karachi -- will also host the upcoming Champions Trophy , with the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium as the third venue.While India play their matches in Dubai as part of a hybrid arrangement, the big-hitting stars among the two-time ODI World Cup winners will miss playing on the flat tracks in Pakistan.Each of the three league games in the tri-series -- two in Lahore and one in Karachi -- have seen the team batting first going past the 300-run mark, while two of those were successfully chased.Batting first in Lahore, New Zealand made 330 for 6 against Pakistan, while South Africa scored 304 for 6 in the next match, which the Kiwis chased down successfully. And if the 7.14 runs per over in Karachi on Wednesday are anything to go by, then the final is likely to witness another run-fest.""Batters will certainly take a lot of heart from the performances they put in the past two games, and as a bowling unit, we are working to understand how to create more pressure and ultimately force batters to take risks,"" said SA coach Rob Walter, after Pakistan completed their highest successful ODI chase to beat the Proteas on Wednesday.He added that more totals in excess of 350 are on the cards if similar batting conditions and the flat decks become the norm at the three Champions Trophy venues, while bowlers will have to think out of the box to get wickets.""As I said, both teams struggled to take wickets; it wasn't just unique to us. So the method (of taking wickets) moving forward is going to be important to us,"" said the coach.""If the pitches are the same moving forward, then you can expect to see more scores of 350.""",Pakistan beat south africa by six wickets in odi tri-series match in karachi.
