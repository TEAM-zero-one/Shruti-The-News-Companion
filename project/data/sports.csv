Whenever Scott Foster steps on the court, it brings relief to the side that is lagging in the series. Coincidentally, the referee has been a part of all those games, where the lagging team got a lifeline. As a result, he earned the nickname, ‘The Extender.’ However, apart from being a lucky charm for the lagging side, he has come under the scanner on several instances where his decisions created controversy.Recently, Scott officiated Game 4 between the Indiana Pacers and Oklahoma City Thunder. As expected, the Oklahoma City Thunder made a comeback and saved themselves another chance by evening the series 2-2. His decisions caused uproar among fans at various points during the crucial game, the most prominent one being Alex Caruso given a clean chit despite fouling on Tyrese Haliburton.Here are the top 5 controversial decisions given by Scott Foster, which drew angry fan reactions and also led the NBA to rescind them, at times.Chris Paul never denied having a beef against Scott Foster, and why wouldn’t he? Paul’s teams were 0-13 in the playoff losses, a streak that they finally broke in 2023.The same year, while playing against the Phoenix Suns, Chris Paul was controversially ejected from the Golden State Warriors by Scott.The decision did not go well among the fraternity, and the rumors swirled in NBA circles that there was money acting behind the call.Scott Foster was a part of the 2023 NBA Denver Nuggets-Miami Heat final as the replay center official. Though behind the screen, he continued to cause a stir among fans with his controversial calls. In one of the disputed fouls made by Aaron Gordon, he upheld the decision and stripped Jimmy Butler of a three-pointer.The decision sparked social media debate, where fans did not hold back their thoughts about Foster and his dubious calls.2023 seemed to be a year full of Scott Foster horror for the NBA fans. He made the most controversial calls that year. One such decision was later rescinded by the NBA on the grounds of an erroneous decision.The foul in question is a technical foul given to Jaylen Brown in Game 7 between the Boston Celtics and the Philadelphia 76ers. Scott stuck to his decision despite the video showing that Brown just reacted to a push and didn’t make an intentional contact.Brown later said to reporters, “I don’t know which way I should have responded to it. But if I didn’t do anything, it probably would have played on. And here comes Scott Foster, right away before even deciphering the situation, gives me a tech.”The decision was later retracted by the NBA.Foster seemed unnecessarily aggressive towards Nikola Jokic during Game 4 of the 2023 NBA Finals. He called Jokic for a fifth foul. Interestingly, the contact was not at all conspicuous and could have easily been shrugged off. Scott went on to call it a technical foul, leading to a frenzy among fans.One Reddit user ranted on his handle:“Scott Foster legitimately is crooked… one or two pieces of coincidental evidence may be bad luck… but Foster has a whole fucking book of coincidental evidence of rigging”The call reflected badly on Jokic’s team Denver Nuggets, who had to send their star performer to the bench for a significant period.The peak of hate towards Scott Foster for his erroneous and inconsistent officiating was seen in 2024. In a game played in March 2024 between the Minnesota Timberwolves and the Cleveland Cavaliers, Foster called Rudy Gobert for a foul. Gobert could not contain his resentment and responded with a ‘money sign’ alluding to Foster’s probable involvement in betting.The reaction from Gobert cost him a $100,000 fine. He apologized later for the gesture and the loss it brought to the team.Also Read: Referee Scott Foster suffers bloody nose injuries early in Oklahoma City Thunder and Minnesota Timberwolves’ Game 2 Scott Foster’s inconsistent officiating has always been a pain for NBA fans.

Wayne Gretzky’s fortune and assets are shaping Paulina’s multi-million dollar legacy

The Steinway powerboat is more than just a toy—it’s a Gretzky family heirloom in the making





As Dustin Johnson pursues another shot at U.S. Open glory, attention has shifted to his wife, Paulina Gretzky—not just for her support, but because of what she stands to inherit from her legendary father, the Great One, Wayne Gretzky. While Johnson has secured massive paydays from both the PGA Tour and LIV Golf, Paulina’s future is lined with generational wealth thanks to her father's illustrious career and lavish lifestyle.Wayne Gretzky, often referred to as “The Great One,” is more than just a hockey legend—he’s a financial powerhouse. With an estimated net worth of $250 million, Gretzky holds 61 NHL records and has turned his post-retirement years into a business empire. For Paulina, this means inheriting not only an enormous fortune but also a portfolio of jaw-dropping properties and luxury items.Among his holdings, Gretzky owns a lakefront estate in Idaho, multiple Florida homes, and a childhood residence in Brantford, Ontario. He even repurchased his famed ‘Gretzky Mansion’ in Thousand Oaks, California, only to flip it for a profit in 2021.But one of the most unique pieces in Wayne Gretzky's collection isn’t a home—it’s a custom, handcrafted 34-foot Steinway 340 HT powerboat.Commissioned in 2021, this bespoke mahogany boat—built by Couer Custom—is worth $900,000 and blends elegance with engineering. It can hit speeds of 50 mph but is designed for leisure. “I was relatively fast when I skated, but these days I drive my car slow,” Wayne Gretzky told Robb Report. “I'll take comfort over speed any day.”The boat features plush loungers, a main cockpit with cozy sofas, a stern sunpad, and even an electric bimini for added shade. Paulina’s mother, Janet Jones, played a pivotal role in designing its stylish aesthetic. “She’s the creative one in the family; the only thing I asked for was to have a Canadian flag at the back,” Gretzky added.Also Read: Wayne Gretzky sparks controversy by accusing Florida Panthers of buying success with tax loopholes Between her father’s sprawling real estate, massive fortune, and luxurious custom yacht, Paulina Gretzky’s future looks every bit as glamorous as her past—and Dustin Johnson may not be the biggest star in the household for much longer.","Paulina gretzky stands to inherit a multi-million dollar fortune from her father, hockey legend wayne.

How Wiggins Fits With LeBron and Doncic





Theare weighing their options this offseason, and according to a popular NBA analyst, one potential move involves swapping a key forward for a proven NBA champion.The Los Angeles Lakers have two clear paths in free agency: pursuing a dominant center or trading for an experienced wing player to bolster their championship aspirations. According to recent reports, the franchise may lean toward the latter by targeting Miami Heat star Andrew Wiggins.Lake Show Life’s Svyatoslav Rovenchuk suggests the Lakers could package forward Rui Hachimura in a deal to acquire Wiggins from the Miami Heat.""The fit of Rui Hachimura alongside (Luka) Doncic and (LeBron) James has quickly come under scrutiny after a premature first-round exit to the Minnesota Timberwolves,"" Rovenchuk wrote. ""This has led many to believe the Lakers are better off trading the starting forward."" (H/t: Sporting News)Andrew Wiggins could provide the Los Angeles Lakers with much-needed perimeter scoring and defensive versatility. Here’s why this trade could work:- Salary Match: Hachimura ($17 million) plus another expiring contract could match Wiggins’ $28.2 million salary for 2025-26.- Proven Playoff Performer: Wiggins was instrumental in Golden State’s 2022 title run, averaging 17.2 points and 4.5 rebounds per game.- Immediate Upgrade: While Hachimura is solid, Wiggins offers better two-way impact and championship experience.Once considered an underachieving talent in Minnesota, Wiggins revitalized his career with the Golden State Warriors . His improved motor and efficiency made him a key piece in Golden State’s success.However, after a slow start in 2024-25, the Warriors traded him to Miami in the Jimmy Butler deal.Wiggins’ skill set complements the Lakers’ star duo:- Reliable three-point shooting for better floor spacing.- Strong perimeter defense to ease the load on LeBron James.- Playoff-tested mentality, crucial for deep postseason runs.With the Heat struggling, Wiggins may welcome a move to a contender like the Lakers.While Hachimura has been a steady presence, Wiggins represents a clear upgrade for a Los Angeles Lakers team in win-now mode. If Los Angeles can structure the right deal, adding the former Warriors champion could be the move that pushes them back into title contention.","The los angeles lakers have two clear paths in free agency: pursuing a dominant center or trading for an experienced wing player.

Tyrese Haliburton fires back at critics, Stephen A. Smith takes it personally in fiery rant



Hilarious fan reactions to ‘ Dumb and Dumber ’ trolling of Stephen A. Smith and Kendrick Perkins at Game 4







Sometimes, the loudest message in a Finals game doesn’t come from a superstar or a coach—it comes from the stands. During Game 4 of the 2025 NBA Finals at Gainbridge Fieldhouse, while most fans rocked gold Pacers shirts, two individuals turned heads with bold fashion choices straight out of a comedy classic. Dressed in Dumb and Dumber-style tuxedos—one bright orange, one electric blue—they topped it off with oversized face cutouts of ESPN’s Stephen A. Smith and Kendrick Perkins. It was a hilarious, pointed response to recent media criticism of Pacers guard Tyrese Haliburton—and fans online immediately took notice.The media heat on Tyrese Haliburton started after Game 2, when he was criticized for his passiveness in a 107–123 Pacers loss. On “First Take”, ESPN’s Stephen A. Smith didn’t hold back. “Win the damn chip, bro… That ain’t on me. That’s on you,” he said, implying Haliburton wasn’t delivering when it mattered. Smith continued, “Just in case he was talking about me—my brother, I'm not going away… this train don’t stop.”Then came Game 3. Haliburton bounced back with 22 points, 11 assists, and 9 rebounds in a 116–107 Pacers win. After the game, he was asked about the media noise. He didn’t name names but made his feelings clear: “Most of the time, the talking heads on the major platforms, I couldn’t care less honestly. Like, what do they really know about basketball?” Kendrick Perkins , speaking on NBA Today, gave Haliburton credit for stepping up.“He finally arrived to the NBA Finals—to us box score watchers,” Perkins said. He even acknowledged, “He outplayed SGA.”And then came Game 4, when two fans used fashion to flip the script. Their orange and blue tuxes carried double meaning: orange symbolizing Smith’s New York Knicks loyalty, and blue a nod to the Oklahoma City Thunder—Perkins’ former team. It was comedy, commentary, and petty brilliance all rolled into one.Fans took to X with no shortage of reactions to the trolling masterclass.One fan said: “Absolutely incredible troll job by Pacers fans dressed as Stephen A. Smith and Kendrick Perkins. Dumb and Dumber tuxedos and all.”This tweet captured the moment perfectly and praised the fans for the elite-level trolling and creative execution.A second user chimed in with: “Two guys in the front row at the Pacers game dressed like Dumb and Dumber with Stephen A Smith and Kendrick Perkins faces on their suits.”This user highlighted the boldness of the fans’ courtside position, emphasizing how visible and intentional the troll job was.Another user joked: “Are these two guys front row at the Pacers game calling Stephen A Smith and Kendrick Perkins Dumb and Dumber?”This tweet added playful speculation, bluntly asking if the fans were deliberately labeling the ESPN duo as the classic comedy characters.One more said:“Best thing I’ve seen tonight…. Dumb and Dumber at the Pacer game tonight!”This comment called the bit the highlight of the evening—more memorable than even the on-court action for some viewers.And finally, another user said:“Pretty sure these fans are in Dumb and Dumber costumes…with face cutouts of Stephen A Smith and Kendrick Perkins.”This tweet added to the confirmation and appreciation of the stunt, acknowledging the detail in the fans’ outfits and execution.Also Read: Tyrese Haliburton shares heartwarming moment with Obi Toppin’s daughter before crucial Indiana Pacers vs. Oklahoma City Thunder NBA Finals Game 4 From Tyrese Haliburton shrugging off criticism to two fans turning sports talk into visual satire, Game 4 of the NBA Finals was about more than basketball. It became a statement on media narratives, on confidence, and on the creative passion of Indiana’s fan base.

A new leadership duet in Los Angeles Lakers

Early glimpses of success and struggle





When Luka Doncic walked into the Lakers locker room, he didn’t just bring talent — he brought tension, too. The February blockbuster trade sent Anthony Davis packing and handed LeBron James a new challenge: sharing control. While wins piled up early, playoff heartbreak and quiet chemistry gaps revealed the truth—this partnership is still in its early steps. Can two legends learn to lead together before the moment passes?February 2, 2025, marked a significant midseason trade for the Lakers: they traded Anthony Davis, Max Christie, and a 2029 first-round pick to Dallas, bringing in Luka Doncic, Maxi Kleber, and Markieff Morris. This was the first midseason trade involving two current All-NBA players. LeBron was taken aback at first—believing it was a joke during a family dinner in New York—before coming to terms with the fact that a new era was upon them.At first, there were some questions, but it didn't take long for signs of unity to pop up. LeBron gave a shoutout to Luka for his locker room presence, saying he has a knack for ""instilling confidence in his teammates."" Doncic shared that feeling, referring to the enthusiastic reception he got before the game as a ""significant moment"" that bonded the players and staff.When they were playing, LeBron compared their synergy to that of a quarterback and wide receiver, noting how Luka’s insight and his scoring talent mesh perfectly.In their fourth matchup, the Lakers took control against the Nuggets, with Doncic scoring 32 points, grabbing 10 rebounds, and dishing out 7 assists, while LeBron contributed 25 points and 9 rebounds, leading to seven consecutive victories and a 39–21 record. However, building chemistry doesn’t just happen. A first-round playoff loss to Minnesota revealed weaknesses: lack of frontcourt depth, exhaustion, and defensive lapses.Even now, there are little signs pointing to a growing connection. Analysts have observed the clear synergy between the duo on the court, but their locker-room 'handshakes' seem a bit flat—indicating that their chemistry is still in the early stages. LeBron has taken on the role of a friendly mentor—giving elbow bumps and sharing advice—but these stars are still figuring out how to trust one another beyond just the numbers.Luka Doncic’s debut with the Lakers has been quite the show—it’s a change that really rocks the foundation of a franchise built around LeBron James. While the early wins suggested a bright future, the playoff setbacks and the need for patience in the locker room reveal that this is a journey, not an instant solution. The base is strong, leadership is collaborative, and confidence is shared—but the Lakers now have to bolster their supporting cast, improve their defense, and cultivate team harmony.Also Read: “He Might Not Be from This Planet” — JaVale McGee recalls watching Stephen Curry drain 100 unbelievable practice Shots If LeBron and Doncic get the locker-room dance down, this partnership could totally transform Lakers basketball.

Fans are losing it over Joe Burrow’s long curls in resurfaced Bengals photo





Apparently, all it takes to break the internet is one photo of Joe Burrow with long, dramatic locks. No new interview, no injury update, no trade buzz just curls, a football, and a menacing QB stare straight out of a retro yearbook.A picture of the Bengals star QB rocking longer-than-usual hair is making the rounds online again, and let’s just say: NFL fans are doing everything from crying laughing to thirst-tweeting like it’s 2013 Tumblr.Once twitter dropped the throwback-style pic, it was over. Fans saw Joe Burrow channeling peak teen-movie heartthrob energy, and the X replies went absolutely feral.Some were stunned. Others are confused. Most? Completely entertained.It’s giving: Netflix teen drama villain, Midwestern rock band lead singer, Guy who drives a vintage Camaro and never texts backBut also? It's giving confidence. Joe’s always been the guy who knows he looks good. And with the internet losing it over this photo, he clearly knew what he was doing.To be clear: Joe didn’t show up at minicamp like this. This isn’t his latest haircut debut. It’s just a photo, likely old, possibly for media day or a promo shoot and yet somehow, it’s got more reach than half the league’s OTA footage combined.There’s something about this version of Burrow that’s just too memeable. The fierce stare. The flowing locks. The Bengals jersey. It’s giving “villain in a lacrosse drama,” and fans can’t get enough.This isn’t just an internet moment. It’s a moment. A digital campfire around which NFL fans gather to joke, flirt, and photoshop Burrow into vintage movie posters.And for a league that lives and breathes QB drama, it’s kinda perfect. No hot takes. No controversies. Just hair, vibes, and a Bengals QB looking like he’s about to steal your girl and your playoff hopes.Whether you think he looks like 80s Batman, a soap opera villain, or just a dude who forgot to get a trim, one thing’s clear: Joe Burrow is unintentionally owning the NFL timeline today.And all it took... was a photo.Also read - Antonio Brown posts carefree video after attempted murder warrant, internet stunned","Fans are losing it over joe burrow’s long curls in resurfaced bengals photo.

Lobo Predicted It, Again: South Africa’s Historic WTC Win vs Australia





NEW DELHI: South Africa defeated reigning champions Australia by five wickets in the World Test Championship final at Lord's on Saturday, successfully chasing down a target of 282 before lunch on the fourth day. Aiden Markram 's superb 136 and captain Temba Bavuma's 66 led South Africa to victory, while Australia's captain Pat Cummins acknowledged his team fell short despite being favoured to win against a South African side with fewer star players.Australia initially held a 74-run lead after the first innings, but couldn't maintain their advantage as South African fast bowler Kagiso Rabada delivered an impressive performance with match figures of 9-110.""Things can change pretty quickly. Unfortunately, it was a bridge too far,"" said Cummins at the post-match presentation ceremony.Steve Smith's first-innings score of 66 stood as the only half-century or better by an Australian specialist batsman in the match. Smith's participation in the upcoming first Test against the West Indies in Barbados on June 25 is now uncertain due to a dislocated finger sustained while dropping a slip catch.""We've got a couple of weeks before the first Test in the Windies, so we'll sit down and have a bit of a think,"" said Cummins.""To make these finals, it's normally off the back of being really strong at home, but you've got to win some away series too,"" he later added at a post-match press conference. ""So, in some ways, it's good we get to dust ourselves off and turn around in a couple of weeks and start looking ahead to the next one. That's one of the good things about the World Test Championship, every Test series and every Test match feels like you're playing for something significant. ""South Africa's successful run chase marked the second-highest at Lord's in Test history, behind only the West Indies' 344-1 against England in 1984.""They (South Africa) were fantastic in that fourth innings. There wasn't a lot in the wicket but they didn't give us a chance,"" said Cummins.The match concluded the third edition of the World Test Championship, following New Zealand's victory in 2021 and Australia's triumph in 2023, with India finishing as runners-up in both instances.The championship's format has faced criticism due to countries having the freedom to determine their Test match participation during the two-year qualifying cycle. South Africa played just 12 Tests in the recent cycle, without facing England or Australia, while Australia reached the final after winning 13 out of 19 matches.""They showed why they're in this final and are deserved champions,"" Cummins said of South Africa.Regarding the format, Cummins jokingly remarked, ""I preferred it at the Oval last time,"" before adding more seriously, ""It's something you build towards for two years, it's a huge achievement to make the final, and then a one-game shootout, I think it's a fantastic spectacle.""Australia may need to reassess their batting lineup as they begin a new World Test Championship cycle, particularly considering Marnus Labuschagne's struggles, who averaged only 25.63 in Tests during the 2024/25 season and scored just 17 and 22 at Lord's after being promoted to opener.",South africa defeated reigning champions australia by five wickets in the world test championship final at lord's on saturday.

The mystery around Joe Burrow’s rumoured relationship with Olivia Ponton







Joe Burrow, one of the most popular and talented players in the league, has finally opened up about Trey Hendrickson’s situation with the Cincinnati Bengals. While Joe Burrow is known for always supporting his teammates, it seems like his take on Trey Hendrickson’s situation with the Cincinnati Bengals has raised some eyebrows among fans.Recently, Joe Burrow was spotted at the Cincinnati Bengals’ first day of minicamp but Trey Hendrickson remained missing from it.After the minicamp, Joe Burrow was asked about Trey Hendrickson’s situation and the star player said, ""Last year we had two (distractions) This year we have one. That's definitely less. You'd love to have none but, you know, that's life in the NFL. We're all supporting Trey, and would love for him to be back.""But Joe Burrow’s words have not gone down well with his fans. A fan wrote, “Mr. Excuses back at it again”, while another fan commented, “wow burrow can’t count to 2? or he just forget about that 1st round bust already?”A third fan wrote, “Kinda disappointed in Joe.. put the same emphasis on the front office to sign Trey as you did Tee and Jamarr. I expected more.. But that’s just me and this is business”.However, some fans have also supported Joe Burrow.A fan wrote, “I love Joe because he’s always trying to get his guys paid. This is the answer that gives Trey a bit more leverage.”Another fan wrote, “#Bengals front office, is putting Joe Burrow in such a tough spot, every year, for absolutely no reason… Trey deserves to be paid, he was there with the team, when others weren’t. He is a leader on that defense, as they continue to dismantle the D. Pay him 🙏🏽”While Trey Hendrickson’s contract dispute is yet to be solved, Joe Burrow’s personal life has also been in the news.A few weeks ago, at Coachella 2025, Joe Burrow was spotted getting out of a van that also had model Olivia Ponton sitting inside. While there were rumours of the two dating back in December 2024, their appearance at Coachella sparked such rumours again.However, both Joe Burrow and Olivia Ponton have remained tight lipped about their dating lives.Also Read: ""I come off as mean"": Travis Hunter's wife Leanna Lenee opens up about how NFL WAGs treated her amid brutal trolling",Joe burrow opens up on trey hendrickson’s situation in the cincinnati bengals.

NEW DELHI: Sarfaraz Khan continued his strong form in England with a blazing century for India A against the main Indian Test squad on Day 2 of the ongoing intra-squad warm-up game in Beckenham on Saturday. While the 27-year-old dazzled with a 76-ball 101, Jasprit Bumrah endured a quiet outing, finishing wicketless in his seven-over spell.India A ended Day 2 at 299/6 in reply to India's 459, with Ishan Kishan unbeaten on 45 and Shardul Thakur on 19. The highlight of the day, however, was Sarfaraz’s explosive ton, laced with 15 fours and two sixes. He was eventually retired out to allow others a hit in the middle — a tactical call that didn’t diminish the impact of his knock.Sarfaraz’s latest hundred adds to his growing reputation in English conditions. He had earlier scored 92 against England Lions in an unofficial Test match, showcasing his talent ahead of India’s five-match Test series against England starting June 20.Earlier in the innings, India A lost Ruturaj Gaikwad for a two-ball duck to Mohammed Siraj , caught behind by Rishabh Pant. But Abhimanyu Easwaran (39) and Sai Sudharsan (38) — both part of the upcoming Test squad — provided some stability.Among the Indian bowlers, Siraj (2/86) and Prasidh Krishna (2/41) made notable contributions, while Nitish Kumar Reddy picked up one wicket. However, India's premier fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah failed to make an impact, conceding 36 runs in his seven overs without taking a wicket. Arshdeep Singh (0/52 in 12 overs) also went wicketless.India’s batting on Day 1 was anchored by half-centuries from captain Shubman Gill and KL Rahul , who looked fluent in the middle as the team builds towards the England Test challenge.","Sarfaraz khan scored a blazing century for india a against the main indian test squad on day 2 of the ongoing intra-squad warm-up game.

Temba Bavuma on picking Ngidi over Paterson for WTC Final: 'Tough decision'





South African fast bowler Kagiso Rabada has etched his name alongside West Indies legend Gordon Greenidge as the only two players in the 141-year history of Lord’s to appear on the iconic honours boards in both the home and away dressing rooms. Rabada ’s latest feat came during the World Test Championship (WTC) final against Australia at the historic ground. The 30-year-old delivered a masterclass, claiming 5 for 51 in the first innings and following it up with another four wickets in the second, helping South Africa stay competitive against a strong Australian side.In Test cricket, players who score a century or take a five-wicket haul at Lord’s earn the privilege of having their name inscribed in gold lettering on the famous honours boards - an accolade revered by cricketers worldwide.Before Rabada, this rare distinction belonged solely to Gordon Greenidge. The legendary opener’s scores of 214 not out and 103 for the West Indies against England in 1984 and 1988 are immortalised on the away honours board. Lesser known, however, is Greenidge’s appearance on the home board — a result of his 122 while playing for the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) against the Rest of the World in 1987.Rabada, too, was already on the away board for his five-wicket haul (5 for 52) against England in 2022.But this time, a unique twist added to the story. As South Africa were assigned the home dressing room for the WTC final, Rabada’s first-innings five-for earned him a place on the home board as well — making him only the second player in Lord’s history to achieve this honour.A piece of sticky batting tape with Rabada’s name written on it has been temporarily attached to the board for his figures of 5-51, as tradition dictates during the match. The gold lettering will follow soon, reported the BBC.Rabada’s achievement is even more poignant given his recent redemption arc, bouncing back strongly after serving a doping ban for using a recreational drug — an incident Australian captain Pat Cummins confirmed his side would not exploit as a sledging tactic. “That’s not our style. I doubt that will come up,” Cummins said before the final.Cricket greats have not held back in their praise. Former Australia skipper Ricky Ponting likened Rabada’s prowess at Lord’s to that of Glenn McGrath, who famously exploited the unique slope at the ground to devastating effect. “Glenn McGrath was exactly the same at Lord’s. He loved bowling there and mastered the slope from both ends — something not talked about as much as it should be,” Ponting told the ICC. “These big games are about big-name players standing up, and Rabada did exactly that. ”Reflecting on his name appearing in both dressing rooms, Rabada called the achievement “cool”, underlining the personal significance of joining such a niche club in cricket’s spiritual home.",Kagiso rabada is only the second player in lord's history to have his name inscribed on both the home and away honours boards. The 30-year-old claimed a total of 9 wickets during the world test championship (wtc) final against australia at the historic ground. West indies legend gordon greenidge is the only other player to have both honours.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121829108,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-79092,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Caitlin Clark’s elite shot-making fuels a statement win over the New York Liberty





Caitlin Clark is back. Her return was one of the highly anticipated events in recent times, and the Indiana Fever fans got to see high-octane action on the court from their favorite star. Caitlin Clark returned to the Indiana Fever lineup with a vengeance on Saturday, delivering one of the most electric performances. Facing the previously undefeated New York Liberty at Gainbridge Fieldhouse, Clark reminded the basketball world exactly why she’s the face of the league’s new era. Her 32-point explosion, complemented by a jaw-dropping barrage of deep threes, lifted the Fever to a commanding 102-88 victory, breaking New York’s perfect record. It was also a stern signal that Clark's full-throttle return from a quad injury, which had sidelined her for three weeks, was underway.In her first game back after missing five straight contests with a strained left quad, Caitlin Clark didn’t hesitate to take charge. She opened the game firing, scoring 14 points in the first quarter on 5-of-7 shooting. But it was her stunning sequence in the closing moments of the frame that truly flipped the game’s energy.Clark knocked down three three-pointers in a mere 38 seconds, two of which came from beyond the 30-foot mark, sending the home crowd into a frenzy.By the final buzzer, Clark had piled up 32 points, 9 assists, 8 rebounds, and 2 blocks in just 31 minutes of action. She hit 7 of her 14 attempts from beyond the arc, many of them from well behind the line, torching the Liberty’s defense and setting the tone for the Fever’s most complete win of the season.Ahead of the game, Clark made her intentions known loud and clear. “Why would I be out there to play 20 minutes?” she told reporters. “I’m out there to win and give everything I have for this team.”The energy didn’t go unnoticed outside of Indianapolis either. LeBron James , watching from afar after the Lakers’ early playoff exit, took to Instagram after Clark’s dominant showing, replying to her celebratory post with a simple but telling comment: “Welcome back!!!!”Chris Paul also chimed in during the game. The Spurs veteran posted on X, “Liberty vs Fever!! Great game!

The Black captain of the South African Test team — a team once regarded as a prized possession of the whites, in a nation divided by colour had his face in his palms.He was trying to soak in the moment. He may not have visualised this in his wildest dreams when he was growing up as a cricketer on the outskirts of Cape Town. The skipper could easily have walked out of the field on Friday evening with a hamstring pull, but he didn’t.Years down the line, when this victory will be discussed, Aiden Markram ’s name will keep cropping up for what he did with the bat in a difficult chase. But all those who endured the roller-coaster of the WTC final for four days will remember Bavuma’s 134-ball vigil on virtually one leg.Remember, Bavuma probably wasn’t everyone’s No. 1 choice as South Africa captain, just as Siya Kolisi wasn’t when the Springboks the pride of white South Africa in those years of Apartheid won the 2019 Rugby World Cup. Kolisi didn’t stop there, he went on to join a select group of rugby captains to win the World Cup back-to-back in 2023.These triumphs, the first being the 1995 Rugby World Cup immortalized by the 2009 Clint Eastwood film Invictus, in which Morgan Freeman played Nelson Mandela — have meant way more than just a win on the sports field.Quiz: Who's that IPL player? While Mandela used rugby as a unification tool in a country torn by racism, success on the cricket pitch was always considered a given for a nation blessed with incredible talent.Just before they got banned from international cricket, an all-white South African team consisting of the likes of Mike Procter, Barry Richards and Peter Pollock had whitewashed a powerful Australia 4-0. On their return on Nov 10, 1991 at Eden Gardens Kolkata in an ODI against India, the world was wowed by the magnificent Allan Donald.Come every World Cup, South Africa start as one of the favourites, till something other-wordly struck. While in 1992 it was the rain-rule that turned a chase of 22 runs off 13 balls to a bizarre 22 runs off one ball due to a five-minute spell of rain, in 1996 it was a brilliant Brian Lara innings in the quarters.In 1999, Hansie Cronje’s South Africa were the best team for most parts of the tournament till the magic of Shane Warne and a last-over choke by Lance Klusener and Donald finished a dream.The choker’s tag fell firmly on the South Africans and India were the beneficiaries just about a year ago in Barbados. Needing 30 off 30 in the T20 World Cup final, a South African team that hadn’t put a foot wrong till then in the tournament, messed it up as Suryakumar Yadav’s catch of the century in the last over won Rohit Sharma’s boys the title.Long after that game was over, as India celebrated, the South Africans didn’t leave the ground. One could see them sitting in their balcony, staring at India’s moment of triumph.Probably they were internalizing the hurt promising themselves that there will be a rainbow at the end of the tunnel. At a sun-soaked Lord’s on Saturday, however, they did keep their tryst with destiny",South africa beat australia in the cricket world cup final at lord's. Temba bavuma's 134-ball vigil on virtually one leg was crucial. South africa have won the rugby world cup back-to-back in 1995 and 2019. Success on the cricket pitch was always considered a given for the springboks.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121858311,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-224258,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
