NEW DELHI: An interim inquiry into the Federation Internationale du Sport Universitaire (FISU) World University Games 2025 fiasco has uncovered a disturbing pattern of corruption, nepotism, regional bias, moral misconduct and procedural lapses within Association of Indian Universities (AIU). The lapses - including unauthorised foreign travel, suspicious financial transactions, misuse of authority, biased selections and failures to register qualified athletes - not only embarrassed India internationally but also denied student-athletes crucial competitive opportunities.The four-member committee headed by Guru Ghasidas Vishwavidyalaya vice-chancellor Alok Kumar Chakrawal, in its interim report accessed by the TOI, found strong evidence of dereliction of duty and possible financial misconduct by suspended joint secretary (sports) Baljit Singh Sekhon.""There appear to be instances indicative of dereliction of duties, failure to discharge duties, breach of responsibility, nonfeasance, negligence, failure to act,"" the report noted. Multiple unexplained deposits were found in Sekhon's bank account in June 2025 - transactions ""potentially linked to his official capacity.""The committee also flagged conflicting statements regarding who funded his Germany trip.When contacted, Sekhon said since he is under suspension it would not be correct to make any comment. Another suspended official, Gaurav Rai, is accused of facilitating the inclusion of his PhD guide - a yoga expert - in the Indian contingent even though yoga was not part of the Games. He allegedly accepted travel sponsorship from KIIT University without approval, amounting to ""unauthorised financial benefit. "" The committee said ""repeated non-compliance with established protocols... may be construed as gross disobedience, blatant insubordination,"" recommending termination under AIU rules.The report also raised ethical concerns involving former joint secretary, AIU, Binu George Varghese, citing a complaint that he ""shared a twin-room accommodation with a female official"" during the 2023 Chengdu Games - behaviour termed ""a case of moral turpitude."" It further noted that ""officials from the South Zone were disproportionately appointed"" as basketball coaches and managers, indicating ""regional bias"" and ""neglect of national integration principles. "" Varghese didn't respond to calls and text message for his comments. According to AIU sources, the general council on Oct 24, 2025 decided to repatriate Varghese and terminate Rai.The inquiry followed nationwide outrage over India's mishandled participation at WUG 2025 in Germany, where several selected athletes were unable to compete due to administrative lapses.In badminton, six players were barred after only half the names were submitted. India's bronze-winning mixed team had just six of its 12 players on the podium. Athletes across sports called the fiasco ""career sabotage,"" prompting the Sports Authority of India to intervene.Operational failures included a Rs 1,000-per-match fine for jersey violations, no pre-booked practice courts and athletes borrowing shuttlecocks. AIU did not fund designated coaches, leaving players without support staff.While interim, the report warns of ""multiple areas of concern that merit deeper investigation,"" underscoring systemic failures that cost athletes their rightful place on the world stage.","An interim inquiry into the fisu world university games 2025 fiasco has uncovered a disturbing pattern of corruption, nepotism, regional bias, moral misconduct and procedural lapses.

How “Tweaker” Became a Cultural Phenomenon

GELO - Tweaker (Official Video)

Tweaker's Chart Domination and Viral Impact on Fans

How LiAngelo Ball Went From Basketball to Music Trailblazer

LiAngelo Ball’s transformation from overlooked basketball prospect to music industry headliner has officially reached a historic milestone. His debut single “Tweaker,” released under the stage name Gelo, has achieved platinum status - an achievement that puts him in the same conversation as heavyweight artists like Drake . For an athlete-turned-musician, this level of success is both unprecedented and culturally significant, signaling a genuine crossover moment that few have ever achieved.In addition to redefining LiAngelo's public persona, this achievement represents the pinnacle of a swift ascent that started in early 2025. LiAngelo, a musician who was frequently overshadowed by his brothers Lonzo and LaMelo Ball, has carved out a whole new path, demonstrating that his musical drive and artistic intuition were much more than a curiosity.Released in January 2025, “Tweaker” exploded online almost instantly. Its nostalgic, bouncy beat - powered by piano, organ keys, and lush synth pads - captured the spirit of early-2000s hip-hop. Paired with Gelo’s melodic, sing-song delivery and a catchy “whoa” hook reminiscent of Big Tymers-era anthems, the track resonated widely. Produced by Kunica and Glockie Cheez, the song painted a picture of luxury, swagger, and newfound fame, creating an irresistible vibe that appealed to both younger listeners and fans of classic hip-hop aesthetics.As the song became more popular in sports culture, its momentum increased even further. ""Tweaker"" spread far beyond the typical music circles when NBA and NFL clubs, such as the Detroit Lions, Chicago Bulls, and Cleveland Cavaliers, adopted it as a joyous anthem in locker rooms and warm-up exercises.The success of “Tweaker” eventually led to a massive $13 million record deal with Def Jam and Universal Music Group. The contract included an extraordinary $8 million guaranteed signing bonus—more than what many current NBA players earn annually. This landmark deal solidified Gelo’s credibility and marketability within the hip-hop and R&B world.Adding even more momentum, a high-profile remix featuring Lil Wayne elevated the track’s status, giving it a stamp of approval from one of rap’s most influential figures.“Tweaker” made history by reaching No. 1 on the US Rhythmic Billboard chart - an exceptional feat for a debut single from a former basketball player. The song sparked viral dance trends across social platforms and earned praise from artists like T-Pain, Lil Yachty, and Joe Budden. Its appeal spanned music, sports, and online culture, cementing LiAngelo Ball as 2025’s breakout music star.Before rising to prominence in the music industry, LiAngelo Ball spent years navigating the NBA G-League and international basketball leagues. Eventually, he gave up the sport entirely, a decision that was validated by his outstanding achievements. His debut album League of My Own, which was released in July 2025, showcased his growth as a musician and cemented his place in the industry.Also read: Angel Reese responds with 4-word message after her name is dragged into viral NBA courtside altercation More than just a personal triumph, LiAngelo Ball's platinum success for ""Tweaker"" is an impactful cultural event.

How Braeden Bowman, Adam Fantilli , and other emerging forwards are boosting their fantasy value

Must Add Players for Week 8! Best Schedules & Waiver Wire Targets Fantasy Hockey

The NHL fantasy waiver wire for the date of November 22 is bringing to light a new collection of fast-rising forwards, and the week’s breakthrough candidate is none other than Braeden Bowman, whose promotion to L1 and PP1 in Vegas has left the fantasy managers in a state of confusion. The following week, with the reshuffling of lines in the teams and the young talent being given bigger roles, is one of the best in the month for the forward's value pickups.Apart from Bowman, a number of mid-rostered players are now flourishing due to the upgraded deployments, better linemates, and a more consistent scoring pattern. References from THN Fantasy and The Hockey News reveal a number of forwards who are giving out far more than their roster percentage, thus making them excellent additions for managers needing instant offense.Braeden Bowman is the first name on the list after he registered his first career multi-point game, and he has gained significant playing time alongside Jack Eichel. Any forward with L1 and PP1 deployment in Las Vegas is a must-see, and especially the one that is already building chemistry with the team’s leading star.Adam Fantilli is certainly the next choice, having scored six goals in his last seven games and being set up as Columbus’s most dangerous forward among Kirill Marchenko and Dmitri Voronkov.His confidence, the way he is used, and his scoring touch all indicate that he has fantasy value for a long time.Kyle Palmieri has a safer, more consistent profile thanks to his L1 and PP1 role with Bo Horvat. The Blues continue to be one of the weakest defensive teams in the league, which means Palmieri has the perfect matchup and a high floor. Tyler Seguin is still reaping the benefits of playing alongside Jason Robertson, while Calgary’s penalty problems increase his chances for power-play points.Philipp Kurashev presents a volatile situation, but has great potential at the same time, as he plays alongside Macklin Celebrini and Will Smith. His scoring streak indicates he is part of the Sharks’ offensive crescendo, even though he is on the second power play unit.This week's waiver wire is a unique opportunity to acquire valuable forwards, with the likes of Bowman, Fantilli, and Palmieri—so it is an excellent moment to boost your fantasy team.Also Read: NHL trade rumors: Pavel Mintyukov buzz heats up as Canadiens Montreal explore their options","The nhl fantasy waiver wire for the date of november 22 is bringing to light a new collection of fast-rising forwards.

Kansas City fans are bracing for a pivotal showdown as Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs return to Arrowhead Stadium to face the Indianapolis Colts. After back-to-back road losses to the Bills and Broncos, Mahomes knows the margin for error has vanished. The team (5‑5) needs a win to keep its AFC playoff hopes alive, and all eyes are on the three-time Super Bowl MVP to bounce back. Beyond the pressure of the field, Mahomes also found moments of personal joy, giving fans a glimpse into life outside football.Off the field, Mahomes spent Friday evening with his wife, Brittany, enjoying a rare night out before the high-stakes matchup. Brittany shared several updates on Instagram, spotlighting her red leather outfit for dinner at 1587 Prime, the Kansas City steakhouse Mahomes opened with Travis Kelce earlier this year. The posts allowed followers to see a different side of the quarterback, one grounded in family, love, and life beyond the playbook.In one post, Brittany drew attention to a small detail in her outfit, writing, “1587 & a cute bow,” with her back turned to the camera. She later shared a black-and-white photo giving her 2.1 million followers a clear look at the front of her ensemble. 1587 Prime has become a hotspot for Chiefs players and NFL personalities alike, with Travis Kelce and his fiancee, Taylor Swift, among the frequent guests.The restaurant honors both Mahomes’ No. 15 and Kelce’s No. 87, and even offers signature cocktails inspired by their partners.Patrick Mahomes didn’t appear in Brittany’s Friday night posts, but she gave him a nod earlier in the day for his thoughtful gesture. A bouquet of “just because flowers” from her high school sweetheart appeared on her Instagram story with the caption, “@patrickmahomes you are the best ever.” Moments like these show a couple enjoying each other’s company and staying grounded, even amid the demands of the NFL season.As the Chiefs prepare to take on the Colts, the Mahomes pair brings off-field positivity into a high-pressure weekend. Brittany’s style, their shared moments, and Patrick’s focus on bouncing back all contribute to the narrative heading into a crucial home game.

Kim Kardashian once surprised fans by praising Taylor Swift’s “super cute and catchy” music

In late 2021, long before their names resurfaced in more recent cultural debates, Kim Kardashian made headlines for a reason no one expected: she openly praised Taylor Swift’s music. At the time, the comment stunned fans because it arrived years after the two had been locked in one of pop culture’s most public and polarizing feuds.Yet during a candid moment on the Honestly With Bari Weiss podcast, Kardashian didn’t hesitate to admit that she had plenty of Swift’s songs saved on her phone. It was an unexpected shift in tone that suggested, at least publicly, that some of the tension between the two megastars had eased, even if their complicated history still loomed large.During the rapid-fire portion of the interview, Kardashian was asked about some of her favorite albums. While she predictably mentioned Yeezus and My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy when discussing Ye’s catalog, she surprised the host when Taylor Swift’s name came up.Kim didn’t pick a specific album, but she didn’t downplay her appreciation either. “I mean, I really like a lot of her songs,” she said. “They’re all super cute and catchy.I’d have to look in my phone to get a name.”For fans who lived through the highly publicized fallout, from the infamous 2009 VMAs moment to the explosive controversy surrounding the edited 2016 phone call, hearing Kardashian speak so casually about enjoying Swift’s music felt almost surreal. At the time, Kim had already told Watch What Happens Live that the feud was “over,” even though the two stars still hadn’t spoken.Her 2021 podcast comments didn’t rewrite their history, but they did offer a small look at how public figures sometimes outgrow old conflicts, even when their disagreements once dominated global headlines.

Boston Red Sox Linked to Stunning Pursuit of a Two-Time Cy Young Winner

Tarik Skubal’s Dominance Makes Him a Game-Changing Target

The $400 Million Question

The Boston Red Sox appear ready to build on their long-awaited return to postseason baseball, and the early signs point toward an aggressive approach this offseason. After securing a playoff berth for the first time in years, the organization seems determined to turn a promising step forward into a championship-caliber leap. With optimism growing around the franchise, the team’s front office is now exploring ways to elevate its pitching staff to elite status.One major theme emerging from Boston’s offseason strategy is the pursuit of a high-end arm to pair with breakout ace Garrett Crochet. Crochet’s rise to becoming the Cy Young runner-up has shifted the Red Sox’s priorities, putting a spotlight on the need for a reliable and dominant No. 2 starter who can complement him at the top of the rotation.According to MLB speculation, Boston could find its ideal rotation partner in one of the league’s very best pitchers: Detroit Tigers superstar Tarik Skubal. Bleacher Report’s Zachary D. Rymer has suggested that the Boston Red Sox may target Skubal through a blockbuster trade, banking on his elite résumé to create a formidable 1–2 punch with Crochet.Rymer’s projection points to a potential scenario in which Detroit decides to leverage maximum value for its ace.Despite being in the midst of a competitive window, the Tigers might consider moving the two-time Cy Young Award winner now rather than risking losing him for nothing when his contract expires. The idea is that Detroit could land a massive return package featuring multiple top-100 prospects, along with either an MLB-ready frontline pitching prospect or an established No. 1 starter to reshape its 2026 rotation.Tarik Skubal’s 2024 season further cemented his position as one of baseball’s premier pitchers. He delivered a 13-6 record with a dazzling 2.21 ERA, racked up 241 strikeouts, and posted a 0.891 WHIP across 195 innings. His performance earned him a second straight Cy Young Award, placing him just ahead of Crochet in the voting.Pairing Skubal with Crochet would instantly transform the Boston Red Sox rotation into one of the most intimidating duos in MLB. But the path to making such a move is complex.For the trade to make sense, Boston must address the financial reality: Tarik Skubal carries a projected $400 million price tag as he approaches his final year under contract. Acquiring him as a one-year rental would require surrendering multiple top-100 prospects—an expensive gamble unless the Boston Red Sox secure him long-term.Also read: MLB trade rumors: New York Yankees could sign $426 million Angels superstar in blockbuster deal after Cody Bellinger opt-out If Boston is serious about building an elite pitching core, re-signing Tarik Skubal becomes essential.

WTC Final: Steve Smith on future, facing South Africa and revised format

Poll Who do you think won the battle of words between Monty Panesar and Steve Smith? Monty Panesar Steve Smith It's a tie

The first Test of the Ashes has begun with an unexpected off-field storm, as former England spinner Monty Panesar unleashed a blistering response to Australia's stand-in captain Steve Smith , escalating what has become the most unlikely feud of the series. Smith had earlier mocked Panesar's infamous Celebrity Mastermind appearance while reacting to the former cricketer's advice that England should needle the Australian skipper by resurrecting memories of the 2018 Sandpaper Gate scandal. The Australian star told reporters to “do yourself a favour” and watch Panesar's quiz-show errors — including mixing up Athens' location and calling America a city — calling it “pretty comical”.But Panesar struck back with ferocity in a Telegraph column, claiming he had “won the battle” and branding Smith's press-conference comments as proof of “mental vulnerability” ahead of a blockbuster series opener.“To think that he wanted to talk about me before one of the biggest days of his career… is flattering and nothing short of hilarious,” Panesar wrote. “I cannot believe he has dug out the old YouTube clip of my shocker and memorised it word by word.”Panesar conceded his Mastermind performance was “terrible” and “a shocker”, but insisted it was still preferable to Smith's own missteps. “We've both made mistakes, but at least mine was on a celebrity quiz show.His was on a cricket field, and we both have to live by them. It seems right now only one of us can.”The former spinner went further, saying if he ever confronted Smith, he would question whether the 36-year-old could “look himself in the mirror yet” after Cape Town 2018. “I would ask Steve whether he can actually admit he was part of Sandpapergate — the worst example of Australian cheating in history.”Panesar suggested Smith's reaction proved England had already succeeded in getting inside his head. “I am delighted to have got so far inside his mind… imagine how much damage Ben Stokes and his side are going to be able to do once play starts in Perth?”He even offered sledging scripts for England players: “If I was Jofra Archer, I'd be telling him ‘I'm swinging the ball even without sandpaper'; if I was Joe Root: ‘Fine or coarse paper, mate? Tell us the tricks of your trade.'”With both sides gearing up for the brutal on-field contest, the Panesar–Smith saga has added an unexpected psychological subplot to an already high-voltage Ashes opener.",Former england spinner monty panesar hits back at steve smith.

India batting coach Sitanshu Kotak shares key update on Shubman Gill's fitness ahead of second Test in Guwahati

NEW DELHI: India Test captain Shubman Gill has been released from the squad ahead of the Guwahati Test and has already left for Mumbai on Friday. The youngster travelled with the side on November 19 but didn't turn up for training on November 20. It is learnt that he will be resting in Mumbai for the next two-three days before seeking specialist opinion from Dr Dinshaw Pardiwala. As of now, there is no trip planned to the BCCI Centre of Excellence (CoE) and more clarity is expected in the coming days.In Gill's absence, Pant will lead the side in the crucial second Test vs South Africa starting November 22. The team management will have to take some tough Playing XI calls and as TimesofIndia.com had reported, Sai Sudharsan and Nitish Kumar Reddy are frontrunners to be picked with Axar Patel likely to return on the bench. In the training session on eve of the match, only KL Rahul, Yashasvi Jaiswal and Sudharsan turned up as the rest took it easy.India lost the first Test at the Eden Gardens inside three days and a lot of focus has been on the playing surface since then. While Eden wasn't the ideal surface, Guwahati is expected to roll out a red soil pitch which will offer both turn and bounce. It may not be as unplayable as Eden but will keep the spinners in play.India batting coach Sitanshu Kotak spoke at length about the pitch for the opening Test and felt it wasn't something they expected.""See, in the last match wicket, Gautam said that he took all the blame on himself. He said that he took the blame because he felt that he should not put the blame on the curators,"" Kotak said. ""Now, what happened in the last match, after a day, it felt like it was crumbling. There was a little bit of soil [that came up after the ball pitched]. All of you can see that. That was not expected. Even if the spin was expected, it was after 3 days or on the third day in the evening. Sometimes, the weather, sometimes, even the curators did not want it. I am telling you the truth. No one wanted it to be like this.""",India test captain shubman gill has been released from the squad ahead of the guwahati test.

Repeatedly ignored! How Indian cricket is letting players like Sarfaraz Khan down

NEW DELHI: Sarfaraz Khan ’s continued absence from the Indian Test team has led to questions from several former players. The Mumbai batter has not played a Test since November 2024.Meanwhile, former India cricketer Aakash Chopra said Sarfaraz has been affected by a perception issue. Sarfaraz has played six Tests so far, scoring 371 runs at an average of 37.10, with three fifties and one century. His highest score in Tests is 150.""I think there is a clarity issue in the case of Sarfaraz. I think it is a case of perception and understanding. I am trying to think—they might have a perception that he may not do as well in swinging conditions or play fast bowling well. Maybe he is not our guy in SENA countries. So he did not get the chance. But even to make that perception, I have to allow him to fail. He is not even being allowed to fail. And now there is no place in the team as well,"" Chopra said on Shubhankar Mishra's YouTube channel.Chopra added, ""I think Sarfaraz should play, or else it would be unfair.""Sarfaraz has also has had a difficult Ranji Trophy season so far, scoring 178 runs in five matches with one fifty.The right-hander batter’s returns are indeed low for the lofty standards he has set in the Ranji Trophy in the seasons preceding his India Test call-up. He made 556 runs in 2022-23 season in six matches at 92.66, piled up as many as 982 runs in 2021-22 at 122.75 in six matches, and before that, Sarfaraz smacked 928 runs in the 2019-20 season in six matches at 154.66.","Former india cricketer aakash chopra said sarfaraz has been affected by a perception issue.

Poll What do you think about Usman Khawaja being barred from starting the innings? Poor decision by the management Necessary for player safety Indifferent, it happens in cricket

Australia’s opening day of the Ashes took an unexpected turn when Usman Khawaja was barred from starting the innings.The opener, who had spent an extended period off the ground with stiffness, did not meet the minimum on-field requirement to bat.Stand-in captain Steve Smith tried to bring him back shortly before England’s innings ended, but the collapse came too quickly for the 38-year-old to regain eligibility.That forced a reshuffle, with Marnus Labuschagne walking out alongside debutant Jake Weatherald.Former Australia allrounder Tom Moody criticised the confusion on Fox Cricket, calling it “poor management… Beyond a joke… like Starc led the attack, we needed Uzzie [Khawaja] to lead the batting.”Weatherald’s debut lasted only two balls, trapped lbw by Jofra Archer after a review, leaving Smith to take strike much earlier than planned. Khawaja, still unable to bat because the dismissal came too soon after his return to the field, remained in the dressing room as Australia attempted to settle after the disruption.He finally came on after the wicket of Marnus Labuschagne in the 15th over, but only managed 2 runs and lasted just an over.The day had already swung violently before the batting order drama.Mitchell Starc demolished England with a fiery 7/58, ripping through the top order inside the first hour and returning after lunch to break the middle order.Only Harry Brook (52) and Ollie Pope (46) offered resistance as England were dismissed for 172, with debutant Brendan Doggett supporting Starc with 2/27.Australia’s reply was equally turbulent. England’s quicks hit back hard, led by captain Ben Stokes, who produced a six-over burst returning 5/23. Archer and Brydon Carse added two wickets each as Australia slid to 123/9 by stumps, still trailing by 49.Smith and Labuschagne held through the early storm, but England maintained pressure throughout the evening session.With the match finely balanced, both sides head into day two with the contest wide open.","Usman khawaja was barred from coming on to open for australia and from coming in as the no. 3 batter due to a specific rule in cricket.

Why coach Gautam Gambhir can't continue with his IPL ways in Test cricket

India’s evolving approach to their batting order has once again raised eyebrows, with head coach Gautam Gambhir and the team management making another unexpected shuffle during the first Test against South Africa at Eden Gardens. In a move that surprised many, India fielded four frontline spinners and sent Washington Sundar in at number 3, a slot previously occupied by Sai Sudharsan in the West Indies series earlier this year. Before that, both Sudharsan and Karun Nair had been used at the same position during the tour of England.Former India batter Aakash Chopra voiced his concerns over the continuous reshuffling and questioned whether the team was lacking clarity in its long-term plans.“Washington Sundar has presented himself as a phenomenal option who can bat at the top of the order, and of course is a more than handy bowler. The bigger question that Gautam and the team management need to answer is are we going to keep changing goalposts after every series?” Chopra said during a JioStar media day interaction.Sudharsan, who made scores of 7, 87 and 39 against the West Indies, found himself out of the XI for the opening Test against South Africa. Sundar replaced him at number 3 and made 29 and 31 in the match.“You’re well within your rights to go with Washington, but if Washi is your long term choice, then were we just wasting time with Sai Sudharsan or even Karun Nair to bat at 3?” Chopra asked.He stressed that India’s top order must prioritise pure batting attributes above all else.“You would first want to prioritise the batting capabilities, not only the skill but also the temperament and the patience and the ability to bat time. That is why you look for the purest specialists who have only one job to do. Your top 4 or 5 are there just to bat and nothing else.”Chopra added that if Sundar is indeed being groomed primarily as a batter, the last several months of experimentation may have served little purpose.“If you choose Washington Sundar as a batter, fair enough, but it just feels like the last six or seven months were futile and you didn't really gain anything from it,” he said.He also questioned the messaging to Sudharsan, who performed reasonably well but still lost his place.“What message do you give to Sai Sudharsan that we gave you a chance, you scored the runs, but we had a change of heart. Transition gives you the chance to experiment, but what makes it easier is clarity and consistency,” Chopra concluded.",India's evolving approach to their batting order has once again raised eyebrows.

Why is the series called The Ashes?



What is inside the urn?



NEW DELHI: England and Australia are facing off in the opening Test of the 2025-26 Ashes series at the Optus Stadium in Perth, renewing one of cricket’s most iconic rivalries. The contest derives its famous name from a mock obituary printed in 1882 after Australia claimed their first Test win on English soil.For both nations, the Ashes series carries immense prestige, often regarded as being on par with the honour of winning a World Cup. Its name has a unique and storied origin rooted in cricket history.The term originated on August 29, 1882, when English journalist Reginald Shirley Brooks published a tongue-in-cheek obituary in the Sporting Times following England’s defeat at The Oval.""English cricket was dead and the body will be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia,"" Brooks wrote in the Sporting Times.England captain Ivo Bligh vowed to reclaim those “ashes” during the team’s upcoming tour of Australia later that year. England went on to win the series 2-1.After that triumph, a small urn was presented to Bligh’s team, giving rise to the tradition of calling every future Test series between England and Australia “The Ashes.”What the urn actually contains has long been debated. Some believe it holds the ashes of a bail from the third match of the 1882 series, while others speculate it might contain remnants of a burnt ball cover or stump.In 1998, Bligh’s daughter-in-law offered another theory, claiming the urn held the ashes of her mother-in-law’s burnt veil.The original urn was handed over to the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) at Lord’s after Bligh’s death in 1927, and since then, teams have competed for a replica of the treasured artifact.Today, the England–Australia rivalry remains one of cricket’s most iconic and fiercely contested battles, with both sides determined to claim the coveted urn.",England and australia face off in the opening test of the 2025-26 ashes series at the optus stadium in perth.

New Delhi: For Parveen Hooda, the road back to the ring was far lonelier than any bout she has ever fought. The young boxer had spent nearly two years on the outside — suspended after three whereabouts failures, grappling with the stigma, the self-doubt and the slow grind of proving she hadn’t given up on herself or her sport.On Thursday in Greater Noida, she finally stepped back into the light. With a gritty 3-2 split verdict over Japan’s Ayaka Taguchi, Parveen claimed the 60kg gold at the World Boxing Cup Finals, turning a period defined by silence and uncertainty into a statement of revival.“This gold means everything,” Parveen told TOI during an interaction. “For me, it’s not just about winning a tournament, it’s about proving to myself that I could come back after everything I went through. I wanted to show that I never stopped fighting, even when I wasn’t inside the ring.”The 25-year-old from Rurki village in Rohtak, Haryana, who had once proudly clinched bronze at the 2023 Asian Games in Hangzhou, found herself stripped of both her Asiad medal and the consequent 2024 Paris Olympics quota spot. Her world collapsed when the International Testing Agency (ITA) announced in May 2024 that she had committed three whereabouts failures between April 2022 and March 2023 — a violation under WADA’s (World Anti-Doping Agency) anti-doping rules.Her punishment: a 22-month suspension, later backdated to 14 months. Her loss: an Olympic dream she had fought to earn.“It broke me at first,” she said. “I won’t lie about that. When the ban was announced, I kept thinking — how did I let something like this happen? For months, I struggled with guilt and frustration,” she said.Cut off from competition and team environments, she retreated into what she calls “a tunnel of introspection”. The silence was deafening but eventually healing.“There were days I didn’t feel like training at all,” Parveen recalled. “But then I reminded myself — this is not how my story ends. I told myself that when I return, I have to return stronger, mentally and physically.”She turned the forced break into a period of rebuilding. “I kept telling myself that I still belonged at the top,” she said.",Parveen hooda won gold at the world boxing cup finals in greater noida.
