Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce enjoy stylish date night in NYC ahead of NFL season



Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce are soaking in every moment together before football takes over the tight end’s calendar. The couple, who’ve become pop culture’s most talked-about duo, were spotted enjoying a summer date night in New York City on Friday, June 20, just days after appearing together at the NHL’s Stanley Cup Final.The romantic outing unfolded in Manhattan, where Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce were seen leaving a trendy restaurant. In a fan-shared video that quickly circulated online, Kelce, 35, could be seen warmly shaking hands with a staff member before stepping outside. Moments later, Swift followed, her signature elegance on full display. The pair paused briefly before reaching their ride, sharing a small but affectionate gesture as they held hands before getting into their car.Taylor Swift turned heads with a soft, summery look—a light blue bustier-style tank top paired with a white pleated mini skirt. She completed the look with white stilettos and a matching shoulder bag, embodying casual glamour. Kelce complemented her perfectly in a white T-shirt and shorts, offering a relaxed, athletic vibe.Their New York outing came just a week after the duo were seen at Game 4 of the NHL’s Stanley Cup Final in Sunrise, Florida.There, they cheered on the Florida Panthers as they faced off against the Edmonton Oilers. Swift opted for a cream jacket and athletic shorts, paired with her iconic red lipstick. Kelce wore a vibrant red sweatshirt and shorts combo, topped off with a coordinating cap—subtly proving yet again that this couple knows how to serve a coordinated look.But beyond the coordinated fashion and glamorous appearances, the couple seems to be prioritizing quality time. According to a source close to Taylor Swift, she is “really looking forward” to supporting Kelce during the upcoming NFL season. “Not just because she loves supporting Travis,” the insider shared with PEOPLE, “but because for the first full season since they started dating, she’s not juggling a packed tour schedule. ”Swift recently wrapped up her record-breaking Eras Tour in December 2024. Spanning five continents and grossing over $2 billion, it became the highest-grossing tour in music history. With her schedule finally free of cross-country flights and nightly performances, this fall promises more stability for the couple. “The past two seasons were a whirlwind between performing across multiple countries, long flights, and trying to squeeze in alone time together wherever possible. It wasn’t easy, but they made it work,” the source added.As Kelce gears up for another run with the Kansas City Chiefs, the couple seems committed to making the most of the calm before the storm—hand in hand, in love, and very much in sync. As we are 10 weeks always from season kick off, fans are hoping to see Swift more frequently.Also Read: ""Still got cheated on by his wife"": Shirtless at 47, Tom Brady flexes shredded physique and fans bring Gisele Bundchen reference","Taylor swift and travis kelce enjoyed a date night in new york city on friday.

While the details are sourced from credible insights, it’s important to note that these are not confirmed moves or official statements. Readers are encouraged to take this analysis with a grain of salt and stay tuned for official updates as the offseason unfolds.)

Why the Boston Celtics Must Make a Move

The Porzingis Dilemma: Risk vs. Reward

Pros of Trading Porzingis

Cons of Trading Porzingis

The Celtics’ front office must weigh two paths:

The Boston Celtics are entering an offseason unlike any other. Fresh off their 2024 NBA championship, the team now faces tough financial choices—including a potential $140 million decision involving Kristaps Porzingis.Most championship contenders focus solely on upgrading their roster, but Boston’s situation is different. With a looming luxury tax crisis, the Celtics must shed salary to avoid financial penalties that could hamper future flexibility.As ESPN’s Bobby Marks points out, trading Porzingis could save the team $135-140 million in luxury tax next season. In a recent trade mock-up, Marks proposed a three-team deal:- Celtics receive: Brandon Clarke, Jay Huff- Chicago Bulls receive: Kristaps Porzingis, Xavier Tillman- Grizzlies receive: Talen Horton-Tucker (via sign-and-trade), Nikola Vucevic, Chicago Bulls’ 2030 second-round pickWhile this trade would ease Boston’s financial burden, it comes at a cost. Kristaps Porzingis has been a key piece for the Boston Celtics when healthy, but his injury history makes him a gamble. Trading him now, while his value is high, could prevent future financial strain. However, losing him would weaken Boston’s frontcourt significantly.As Ivan White notes in the original article: ""On paper, that deal looks like a disaster for the Boston Celtics. While Clarke and Huff could be solid contributors, neither can provide the same impact as Porzingis at his peak."" (H/t: Sporting News)- Massive tax savings ($140 million)- Avoids long-term risk if injuries persist- Opens flexibility for future moves- Loss of elite rim protection and floor spacing- No direct replacement for his two-way impact- Weakens championship window for 20251.Keep Porzingis and push for another title, accepting heavy financial penalties.2. Trade him now, prioritize future flexibility, but risk a weaker roster.A decision is expected soon, as Boston looks to balance immediate contention with long-term sustainability.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Dallas Mavericks predicted to $45,000,000 Indiana Pacers star to fill up void after Luka Doncic trade The Boston Celtics are under serious financial pressure, which is why trading Kristaps Porzingis has become a realistic possibility. Moving him could save the franchise between $135 and $140 million in luxury tax penalties—a massive relief for their long-term salary cap situation. However, Porzingis remains a tricky asset; his injury history makes him a gamble, but when healthy, he’s a game-changing two-way player. Whatever Boston decides will have major implications—keeping him could solidify their 2025 title hopes, while trading him might sacrifice short-term competitiveness for future flexibility.","The boston celtics are entering an offseason unlike any other.

Is jersey number 0 cursed? Fans can’t get over insane theory after Tyrese Haliburton’s injury resembled Damian Lillard and Jayson Tatum,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/is-jersey-number-0-cursed-fans-cant-get-over-insane-theory-after-tyrese-haliburtons-injury-resembled-damian-lillard-and-jayson-tatum/articleshow/122026901.cms,"Jayson Tatum, Tyrese Haliburton and Damian Lillard.

Tyrese Haliburton’s Achilles injury resembled Damian Lillard and Jayson Tatum , which sparked jersey no. 0 curse speculation



Fans react to the theory of the cursed jersey number 0



Tyrese Haliburton’s injury has put the Indiana Pacers far behind the winning line in the NBA Game 7 finals decider, as the OKC Thunder eventually secured the 103-93 win. As Haliburton fell on the floor after a non-contact injury, a wild theory surfaced, which coincidentally reflects that three NBA superstars who wore jersey no. 0 succumbed to the same Achilles during postseason games. Many fans believe that the jersey number is cursed as three fallen star lost their chance of a championship.So, is jersey number 0 cursed? While any rational thinker would dismiss it as a superstition, a recently surfaced wild theory suggests that three NBA stars— Damian Lillard, Jayson Tatum, and now Tyrese Haliburton have met with the same fate, coincidentally, they wear the same jersey number.Let’s put things in perspective, Indiana Pacers star Tyrese Haliburton had been battling a nagging calf strain for several games leading up to the NBA Finals. But in Game 7 against the Oklahoma City Thunder, his worst fears materialized. Just minutes into the first quarter, Haliburton crumpled to the floor clutching his lower leg. His father later confirmed it was a torn Achilles.“I know the risks, I know everything that comes with it.I just had to hear it was OK,” Haliburton had said days earlier. The 24-year-old had been the heart of Indiana’s playoff run, averaging 17.3 points, 8.6 assists, and 5.3 rebounds, including four game-winning shots. His exit not only cost the Pacers their floor general but also highlighted the growing list of casualties this postseason.Damian Lillard and Jayson Tatum add to the injury epidemic. The string of Achilles injuries began with Milwaukee Bucks guard Lillard, who went down in Game 4 of the first round. Just weeks later, Boston Celtics forward Tatum followed suit in the Eastern Conference Semifinals against the New York Knicks. Both stars, according to former NBA All-Star Gilbert Arenas, had reportedly been experiencing calf pain prior to the injury, just like Haliburton.“Even with Jayson Tatum… and Dame — [I asked] was your calf hurting before? And they both said yes,” Arenas revealed during a Finals watch party.Their stories mirror a larger trend. According to injury analyst Jeff Stotts, eight Achilles tears occurred during the 2024–25 NBA season—a staggering number that already shattered the previous high of five. That count doesn’t even include Haliburton, Thanasis Antetokounmpo (preseason), or draft prospect Jalon Moore (via Sporting News).NBA fans, especially the Indiana Pacers supporters, were quick to respond to the wild theory.“Unbelievable,” one fan reacted with a shocked-faced emoticon.“No way that's insane,” another reacted.“Zero chance this is a coincidence??” one fan made a claver joke on the theory.“There’s some voodoo afoot,” another wrote.It is possible that the reason for these injuries is fatigue, overwork, and even low-top shoes as potential contributors. With players clocking over 40 minutes per night during the postseason, many believe the physical load is simply unsustainable. Achilles injuries, after all, are among the most traumatic in sports, often requiring a year of rehab with no guaranteed full recovery.","Tyrese haliburton’s injury has put the indiana pacers far behind the winning line in the nba game 7 finals decider, as the okc thunder eventually secured the 103-93 win.

NBA fans criticized ESPN’s commentator Doris Burke for her Game 7 analysis

One of the biggest nights of the NBA world resulted in such a way that would be remembered by the fans till the upcoming season finals. During the Game 7 of 2025 NBA Finals, as the Oklahoma City Thunder dominated and decimated Indiana Pacers with an overall score of 103-91, ESPN’s reputed commentator Doris Burke diverted the attention of the NBA fans for all the wrong reasons. Frustrated with her analysis during the final game between the Pacers and Thunder, NBA fans lashed out against Dosis Burke on social media.ESPN’s prominent commentator Doris Burke became the centre of the Game 7 of 2025 NBA Finals on social media. She was criticized for her direct analysis on the game between the Indiana Pacers and Oklahoma City Thunder. As Doris Burke was behind the mic, fans vented out their frustration on X and did not hesitate from calling her the worst commentator in the history of the NBA. A fan even mentioned-“Doris Burke is hands down the worst announcer in @NBA history. Her voice ruins the Finals. It’s Game 7, and we’re stuck listening to a WNBA highlight reel in disguise. This isn’t equality, it’s punishment. Do better @espn. PS: Malika Andrews is a nightmare too.”“One thing all NBA fans can agree on. This might be the last time we hear Doris Burke call an NBA finals game.”“The one takeaway from the Finals that every NBA fan should agree with, Doris Burke should not be behind the mic. Way to many cringeworthy moments.”“Doris Burke has ruined my NBA playoffs experience with her voice. It is completely intolerable. Every “S” sound comes out of her mouth with an “SH” sound. I cannot STAND listening to her.”“When you’re sad the NBA season is over but then realize you don’t have to hear Richard Jefferson and Doris Burke ever again.”“Doris Burke needs to be fired or at least not on Game 7 of the NBA Finals.”However, according to reputed media outlet The Athletic’s senior sports writer Andrew Marchand, there is a strong possibility that after 2025 NBA Finals, ESPN’s broadcasting panel could be re-shuffled.

Sitanshu Kotak press conference: Big revelation on Shubman Gill

NEW DELHI: Legendary Indian cricketer Sunil Gavaskar has expressed strong reservations over the naming of the ongoing five-match Test series between India and England as the Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy. Gavaskar argued that Sachin Tendulkar ’s name should appear before James Anderson’s, citing Tendulkar’s seniority and vastly superior achievements in international cricket.Writing in his column for Mid-Day, Gavaskar dismissed the reasoning that names were ordered alphabetically and took particular aim at the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) for their decision.“The ECB is fully entitled to call the series by any name they choose but for most, if not all, Indian cricket lovers it is jarring to know that Anderson's name comes first. Not only is Sachin Tendulkar along with Kapil Dev the greatest Indian cricketer, but also senior to Anderson by more than a dozen years. He is numero uno as far as runs and centuries are concerned in Test cricket but also at the one-day level too he has more runs than anybody else,” Gavaskar wrote.The former India captain continued by underlining the disparity in accomplishments between the two cricketing icons.“Anderson is third in the list of wicket takers in Test cricket and his record is nowhere as good as Tendulkar in one-day cricket. Tendulkar is also part of a World Cup winning team which Anderson has not been.Jimmy Anderson was a terrific bowler but mainly in English conditions and his record away is nowhere near as good as Tendulkar's is,” he added.Gavaskar also called upon Indian fans and the media to refer to the series as the Tendulkar-Anderson Trophy, flipping the current order to reflect what he believes is the more appropriate recognition.In the same column, Gavaskar offered suggestions regarding the Pataudi Medal of Excellence, which is currently awarded to the captain of the series-winning team. He questioned the logic behind that structure.“Why the captain and what if the series is drawn? That's why it would have been better to have had a Pataudi medal for the man of the match for every Test, culminating in the Pataudi Trophy for the player of the series. This way, the Pataudis will be remembered after every Test match played as well as after the series is finished in England,” Gavaskar remarked.","Gavaskar has expressed strong reservations over the naming of the ongoing five-match test series between india and england as the anderson-tendulkar trophy.

Tyrese Haliburton, one of the most popular and talented players in the NBA, left the Indiana Pacers’ fans shocked and heartbroken as he had to exit Game 7 of the NBA finals early due to an injury on his right leg. With Game 7 being the third consecutive game in which the Indiana Pacers lost against the Oklahoma City Thunder, fans are now questioning young players and the way they have gotten injured this season.Tyrese Hailburton’s injury has sparked a discussion about what has been going wrong with the players this season and it has sparked a divide among fans.While some fans have blamed the number of games the players have to participate in, others have blamed the young players’ lifestyle.A fan took to X and wrote, “As physical as the 90s were, you hardly ever heard of players tearing their Achilles. They already take games off, it sucks those players got hurt but how much softer do we want the NBA?”Another fan posted, “How about these guys are in better shape eat better train better than the guys in the 80s and you want to shorten the season? lol make things easier for people that have it easy”.A third fan wrote, “So we are supposedly seeing more advanced athletes than ever before, but they can’t handle as many games as guys have played for 40 years now? You get paid big money to play 82+games, do it”, while another user posted, “Or unpopular opinion, these dude need to start taking care of their bodies? If it was a season issue, a lot more players would be having these type of injuries.”However, neither the Indiana Pacers nor Tyrese Haliburton has responded to the speculations yet.Tyrese Hailburton has been dealing with many injuries this season, and before Game 6, he had spoken about playing even though he was in pain.He had said, “These are the men who I’m willing to fight with, and we’ve had a very special season together, developing a special bond in our team. Also, I feel that I would regret not trying it.”Also Read: “Stay home with Savannah”: LeBron James’ potential move to Amazon Prime NBA commentary sparks outrage and disappointment among fans",Tyrese haliburton’s injury in game 7 has sparked outrage among fans.

NEW DELHI: India’s star wicketkeeper-batter Rishabh Pant continued his scintillating form, smashing his eighth Test century on Day 4 of the first Test against England at Headingley Stadium in Leeds on Monday. Pant created history and became the first Indian wicketkeeper to score centuries in both innings of a Test match.Remarkably, this was Pant’s second century of the match, following his 134 in the first innings — marking back-to-back hundreds in the same Test.With this feat, Pant has joined an elite list of visiting batters who have recorded five consecutive 50-plus scores in England.The list includes greats like Don Bradman, Hansie Cronje, Shivnarine Chanderpaul, Kumar Sangakkara, and Daryl Mitchell. The record is led by Australia’s Steven Smith, who has seven such scores.Only two designated wicketkeepers have scored centuries in both innings of a Test match: Andy Flower (142 & 199* vs South Africa, Harare 2001) and Pant (134 & 118 vs England, Headingley 2025).Pant joined this elite club with his back-to-back centuries, becoming the first Indian wicketkeeper to achieve the rare feat.Only a select group of Indian batters have scored centuries in both innings of a Test match.

Jasprit Bumrah press conference: Lashes out at critics, dropped catches and no balls

Greenstone Lobo predicts winner of IND vs ENG series | Who Has the Astrological Edge?

NEW DELHI: India’s pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah continued his red-hot form by picking up his 14th five-wicket haul during the first Test against England at Headingley, Leeds, on Sunday — a feat made more impressive by the fact that four catches were dropped off his bowling. His brilliance helped India edge ahead with a slender six-run lead as England were bowled out for 465 in the second session.However, despite his heroics, Bumrah will not feature in all five Tests of the series. BCCI chief selector Ajit Agarkar confirmed that Bumrah’s workload will be managed across the series to preserve his fitness.Bumrah has been in sensational form in 2024, claiming 78 wickets at an astonishing average of 15.07, with six five-wicket hauls. In stark contrast, all other Indian pacers combined have taken 80 wickets at 33.48 with just one five-for in the same period.Such has been Bumrah’s impact that cricketing greats Sunil Gavaskar and Cheteshwar Pujara even made a lighthearted request to his wife, sports broadcaster Sanjana Ganesan, asking her to convince him to play the full series.With this latest effort, Bumrah has equaled Kapil Dev’s record of 12 five-wicket hauls in away Tests — but achieved it in just 34 matches compared to Kapil’s 66.His overseas dominance includes five four-wicket hauls in Australia, three each in England and South Africa, and two in the West Indies. Remarkably, only two of Bumrah’s 14 five-wicket hauls have come on Indian soil.He also became the first Indian bowler to take 10 five-wicket hauls in SENA countries (South Africa, England, New Zealand, Australia). He is now just two behind Pakistan legend Wasim Akram, who leads with 11 such hauls in those nations.Overall, Bumrah has 210 wickets in 46 Tests at an outstanding average of 19.33 and an economy rate of 2.77. His best Test bowling figures remain 6 for 27.While India have five other pacers in the squad, Bumrah’s recent performances underline just how irreplaceable he is — even as the team looks to balance workload with long-term sustainability.","Jasprit bumrah picked up his 14th five-wicket haul during the first test against england at headingley, leeds, on sunday.

EA Sports reveals early ratings for Michigan State players in College Football 26,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/gaming/ea-sports-reveals-early-ratings-for-michigan-state-players-in-college-football-26/articleshow/122037428.cms,"EA Sports is all set to launch the College Football 26 video game on July 10. However, ahead of the launch the early player ratings have surfaced online increasing an excitement among Michigan State fans. While no Spartan player cracked the elusive 90+ overall mark, several key contributors and promising talents have received solid initial ratings.The highest-rated Spartan in the game, according to early leaks, is senior tight end Jack Velling , coming in with an 88 overall. Despite a somewhat quiet first season in East Lansing, expectations are clearly high for Velling as he enters his final collegiate year.Close behind him is transfer redshirt junior wide receiver Chrishon McCray with an 87 overall. McCray, who transferred from Kent State, is expected to be a major playmaker in the Spartans' passing game. Fellow transfer wideout Omari Kelly, a senior from Middle Tennessee State, also received a respectable 85 overall.On the defensive side, senior defensive back Nikai Martinez secured an 84 overall, entering his second season with Michigan State after starting all 12 games last year. Notably, redshirt junior punter Ryan Eckley also received an 84 overall, a testament to his strong performance last season where he led the Big Ten in punting average.Perhaps the most debated rating among the early reveals is that of sophomore wide receiver Nick Marsh , who currently sits at an 84 overall. Many Spartan fans and analysts believe this rating is ""criminally low,"" anticipating a breakout season from Marsh that could see his rating significantly increase in future game updates. He is currently ranked as the third-highest receiver on the team within the game, a placement that has raised eyebrows given his potential.Other notable ratings include:* QB Aidan Chiles: 81 Overall* RB Nathan Carter: 85 Overall* C Tanner Miller: 87 Overall* LB Wayne Matthews III: 83 OverallIt's important to remember that these are early, initial ratings, and EA Sports has a history of adjusting player overalls throughout the game's lifecycle based on real-world performance. For now, Spartan fans can begin strategizing their dynasty runs and eagerly await the full launch of EA Sports College Football 25 to take control of their favorite Michigan State stars.","Ea sports is all set to launch the college football 26 video game on july 10.

KL Rahul press conference: On his role, being elder brother in team, role clarity and match

England face a formidable challenge at Headingley, needing 371 runs to win the first Test against India. After conceding a big second-innings lead, England’s openers Zak Crawley and Ben Duckett ensured they finished Day 4 at 21 for no loss, keeping hopes alive for what would be a historic chase. With Headingley famous for some of Test cricket’s most dramatic fourth-innings run chases, all eyes are on whether England can script another thrilling finish.Headingley cricket ground in Leeds has witnessed some of cricket’s most memorable run chases in Test match history, with Australia’s pursuit of 404 runs against England in 1948 standing as the highest successful chase at this venue. The historic ground has hosted five remarkable fourth-innings victories, showcasing extraordinary batting performances and match-winning partnerships that have left an indelible mark on Test cricket.The highest successful run chase at Headingley came in 1948 when Australia, led by Don Bradman, achieved a target of 404 runs with seven wickets to spare. Bradman’s unbeaten 173 and Arthur Morris’s 182 formed a partnership of 301 runs that secured this historic victory for Australia.The second-highest chase occurred in 2019 when England successfully pursued 362 runs against Australia. Ben Stokes emerged as the hero with an unbeaten 135 off 219 balls, forming a crucial last-wicket partnership with Jack Leach, who contributed just one run to the cause.West Indies achieved the third-highest chase in 2017, successfully reaching a target of 322 runs with five wickets remaining. Shai Hope’s twin centuries and Kraigg Brathwaite’s significant contribution helped the West Indies secure a memorable victory on English soil.The fourth spot belongs to England’s chase of 315 against Australia in 2001. Mark Butcher’s outstanding innings of 173 runs from 227 deliveries guided England to victory despite a shaky start at 33 for 2.The fifth-highest successful chase at Headingley was completed by England against New Zealand in 2022, when they reached the target of 296 with seven wickets in hand. Joe Root and Ollie Pope’s partnership of 134 runs off 168 balls proved crucial after England lost both openers with only 51 runs on the board.Quiz: Who's that IPL player? These successful chases at Headingley have featured remarkable individual performances. Don Bradman’s unbeaten 173 in 1948, Ben Stokes’ 135 not out in 2019, and Mark Butcher’s 173 in 2001 stand as some of the finest fourth-innings batting displays at this ground.The venue has particularly been favourable for England, who feature in four of the five highest successful chases. Three of these victories came against their traditional rivals Australia, while the other was against New Zealand.The success rate of teams batting fourth at Headingley demonstrates the ground’s potential for producing exciting finishes. The pitch characteristics and conditions have often allowed batting teams to successfully chase substantial targets.These historic chases have often involved significant partnerships. The 301-run partnership between Bradman and Morris in 1948, the last-wicket stand between Stokes and Leach in 2019, and the Root-Pope partnership in 2022 exemplify how crucial partnerships have been in successful pursuits at this venue.Each of these five chases has contributed to Headingley’s reputation as a ground capable of producing dramatic Test matches with successful fourth-innings pursuits. With a 371-run target now set, England’s current team has a chance to add its name to this famous list — but it will take something truly special to do so.","England face a formidable challenge at headingley, needing 371 runs to win the first test against india.

Stellar Blade PC review: A polished port that sharpens every blade strike,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/reviews/stellar-blade-pc-review-a-polished-port-that-sharpens-every-blade-strike/articleshow/121866038.cms,"Story

Combat and gameplay

Character design and game aesthetics

Verdict

Our rating: 3.5

Stellar Blade 's PC version maintains the game mechanics as its first outing on the PS5. It doesn't try to copy the expansive open-world games that are currently trending. Instead, it sticks to a simple and focused design with clear levels and a combat style that relies on timing. It may not offer anything completely new, but it brings back a style that many games don't use anymore.This major release from Shift Up doesn't try to do everything all at once. It avoids trend-chasing and keeps things straightforward, focusing on exciting fights, movie-like scenes, and a world that feels planned out rather than huge and empty. Stellar Blade seems to be sure of what it wants to be, and that steady focus makes it easy to enjoy—even when some parts feel familiar.Set in a post-apocalyptic future, Stellar Blade tells the story of Eve, a brave soldier sent to take back Earth from deadly creatures called the Naytiba . Most of humanity now lives in a space colony, watching from above and hoping for a second chance. That chance comes when Eve lands on the planet with one goal—reclaim what was lost.The story moves at a steady pace, pulling you into its detailed world. One moment you're walking through the glowing streets of Xion, the next you're exploring an old, rusted factory filled with smoke and broken machines. Background voices and short conversations with NPCs help explain the world without slowing things down.While the plot feels familiar, it's Eve who makes it stand out. Her calm determination and curiosity come through clearly in the original Korean voice acting, helping us connect with her as she fights to bring hope back to a broken planet.Stellar Blade keeps things simple at first, but its combat quickly becomes the star of the show. We started with basic three-hit combos, but soon learned how to mix in dodges, parries, and flashy air combos that make every fight feel exciting.Dodging at just the right time (aka Perfect Dodge ) slows things down, giving you a chance to counterattack easily. Parrying well, on the other hand, can break enemy defenses wide open.As you get used to enemy patterns, the fights start to flow like a dance. Bosses raise the challenge by mixing wide attacks with fast projectiles, forcing you to move and react smartly. To stay ahead, we had to focus on upgrades that made Beta attacks recharge faster and made parrying easier.By the later stages, Eve felt powerful—but not unstoppable. New enemy types kept changing their attack styles, keeping the combat fresh and forcing us to adapt.When everything clicks, the action feels smooth and rewarding. Eve weaves through danger, counters with style, and keeps the pressure on. These are the moments that show what Stellar Blade does best: fast, responsive combat that makes every fight feel like a carefully timed performance.We tested the game on a machine that features an Intel Ultra 9 processor, paired with 32GB RAM and an Nvidia RTX 5090 graphics unit. The game maintained a constant frame rate of 60fps. We didn't notice any stutter or frame drops while playing the title, even during extended sessions.Stellar Blade brings a bold and stylish look to its main character, Eve—but it's more than just eye-catching design. While some games pull back on proactive design to stay safe, developer Shift Up stuck to its creative vision and showed that style doesn't have to come at the cost of substance. Eve's design may turn heads, but what matters more is how well the rest of the game supports it.Many games with flashy characters fall flat because they don't back up their looks with solid gameplay. Stellar Blade avoids that trap. The combat is tight, the story has heart, and the characters—Eve, Adam, Lily, and others—feel like real parts of the world, not just decoration.

Hell on earth (but make it medieval)

When glory kills actually feel glorious

The sound of silence (and chainsaws)

Until it is done (for now)



Our rating: 4/5

Don't you think video games are getting too complicated? Every title coming out these days feel compelled to drop me into a 200-hour increasingly cinematic sandbox filled with fetch quests that demand dozens of hours exploring vast open worlds for what, just to kill off the bad guy for world peace? Well, Doom: The Dark Ages is exactly that but it’s honest about it, and bluntly effective. After years of watching the franchise from the sidelines, occasionally nodding along to Mick Gordon's brutal soundtracks without context, I finally dove headfirst into it. What I discovered wasn't just my entry point into the series, but a reminder of why sometimes the most sophisticated gaming experiences come wrapped in the simplest packages.The Dark Ages positions itself as a prequel to the modern Doom trilogy, casting the legendary Slayer in a medieval-meets-sci-fi setting where alien overlords, demonic hordes, and humanity's last defenders clash across sprawling battlefields. The premise couldn't be more straightforward: you are an unstoppable force of nature, demons exist, and your job is to make them not exist anymore. No moral complexity, no branching dialogue trees, no companion approval ratings to manage. Just pure, undiluted aggression channeled through increasingly creative methods of digital violence.What struck me immediately was how liberating this clarity felt. In a gaming landscape increasingly obsessed with cinematic storytelling and player choice consequences, The Dark Ages presents a different philosophy entirely. The Slayer speaks exactly one word throughout the entire campaign, yet his character development through body language and environmental storytelling proves more compelling than most fully-voiced protagonists. There's something profoundly satisfying about a character who solves every problem by hitting it really, really hard with medieval weaponry.The Dark Ages' isn’t very good with it’s storytelling but let’s honest it doesn’t really need to be. Instead, it is the Doom’s ages old combat formula, which is subtly evolved but still maintain its frenetic DNA. The introduction of the Shield Saw fundamentally changes how encounters unfold, shifting from Doom Eternal's emphasis on constant movement to a ""stand and fight"" mentality that initially sounds counterintuitive to everything the franchise represents.Yet somehow, it works brilliantly. While shields have mostly been known to be defensive equipment to humans, for the Slayer, it’s a weapon, traversal tool, and tactical game-changer rolled into one circular buzzsaw of destruction. Parrying incoming attacks feels satisfying in a way that transcends mere mechanical feedback; there's a rhythm to combat that emerges naturally as you learn to balance aggression with precise timing. Unlike the rigid resource management that sometimes made Doom Eternal feel like solving an equation under pressure, The Dark Ages allows for more improvisational approaches to demon disposal.The weapon roster adapts familiar tools to the medieval setting without losing their essential character. The Super Shotgun remains the close-quarters king, but new additions like the skull-spitting gatling gun and chain-attached railgun offer fresh approaches to crowd control and armour piercing. Each weapon feels purposeful rather than redundant, contributing to a combat system that rewards experimentation without punishing players who develop preferences.What impressed me most was how the game manages to feel both more accessible than its predecessor while maintaining tactical depth. The shield bash's traversal capabilities replace Eternal's air dash system seamlessly, while the parry mechanics add a layer of skill expression that never feels mandatory for success. It's a delicate balance that many action games struggle with, providing systems that enhance experienced play without alienating newcomers.Beyond the moment-to-moment combat, The Dark Ages succeeds in creating environments that justify their existence beyond being demon-killing arenas. The level design strikes an excellent balance between linear progression and exploratory freedom, with larger hub areas offering multiple objectives and secrets to discover at your own pace. These aren't the overwhelming open worlds that dominate modern gaming, but focused playgrounds that reward curiosity without overwhelming players with busy work.The medieval aesthetic could have easily felt like a gimmicky departure from the series' established visual language, but id Software wisely blends fantasy elements with the technological underpinnings that define Doom's universe. Watching massive mechs stomp across castle battlefields while dragons soar overhead creates moments of genuine spectacle that feel earned rather than manufactured. These setpiece moments, while not always mechanically perfect, serve their purpose as palate cleansers between the more intense combat encounters.The game's approach to progression also deserves mention for how it respects player time. Upgrades feel meaningful without being overwhelming, and the currency systems are straightforward enough that you're never confused about what you need or where to get it. Secrets are well-integrated into level design, offering genuine rewards for exploration without requiring exhaustive searching to find every hidden item.Perhaps what surprised me most about The Dark Ages was how it made me reconsider my relationship with action games in general. I've spent years gravitating toward narrative-heavy experiences, convinced that emotional investment required complex storytelling and character development. The Dark Ages demonstrates that engagement can come from perfectly tuned mechanics and clear, achievable goals just as effectively as any branching storyline.The game's violence is cartoonish in the best possible way—so over-the-top that it transcends any concerns about real-world implications and becomes pure digital catharsis. There's an almost meditative quality to chaining together perfect parries, weapon swaps, and glory kills that creates its own form of flow state. The feedback loop is immediate and satisfying: see demon, devise elimination method, execute plan, admire results, repeat.This isn't to say The Dark Ages completely abandons narrative ambition. The wordless characterisation of the Slayer, the environmental storytelling embedded in each level, and the broader mythology all contribute to a surprisingly coherent world. But these elements serve the gameplay rather than demanding attention in their own right, creating a more integrated experience than many games that pride themselves on their storytelling.The campaign's 22-chapter structure maintains excellent pacing throughout its roughly 20-hour runtime, never allowing any single element to overstay its welcome. Even the occasional mech and dragon sequences, while mechanically simpler than the core combat, provide necessary variety and spectacle without derailing the overall experience.If there's one area where The Dark Ages stumbles, it's in the audio department. While I haven’t really spent hours slaying on Mick Gordon’s composition, yet somehow his absence is immediately noticeable, and I guess it would be even more so for someone who have been a regular of series’ previous entires.While Finishing Move's soundtrack is competent, it lacks the driving intensity that made Gordon's work such an integral part of the Doom experience. The music often fades into background noise rather than amplifying the on-screen chaos, a significant departure from how seamlessly audio and gameplay integrated in previous entries.This isn't a fatal flaw, but it does represent a missed opportunity to elevate already excellent gameplay with equally excellent audio design. The sound effects themselves remain top-tier, every shotgun blast, demon roar, and shield clang carries appropriate weight, but the musical backing never quite matches the energy of what's happening on screen.Doom: The Dark Ages succeeds as both an entry point for newcomers and a worthy addition to an established franchise by remembering that complexity and sophistication aren't synonymous. It knows exactly what it wants to be and executes that vision with laser focus.Now I understand what I'd been missing all these years. The Dark Ages doesn't just serve as my belated introduction to the series, it’s a masterclass in why Doom has endured for over three decades. What I initially dismissed as mindless violence revealed itself as carefully orchestrated chaos, where every system works in harmony to create something greater than the sum of its parts. The sophistication I'd been seeking in complex narratives and sprawling worlds was here all along, hidden beneath layers of demon viscera and shotgun shells.This realisation feels almost embarrassing in hindsight. I'd spent years chasing elaborate gaming experiences, convinced that depth required complexity, when Doom was quietly perfecting the art of elegant simplicity. The Dark Ages strips away every unnecessary element to focus entirely on what matters: the pure joy of interactive entertainment. No padding, no filler, no respect for your time wasted on anything that doesn't contribute to the core experience.In a year likely to be dominated by sprawling open worlds and narrative epics, Doom : The Dark Ages offers something increasingly rare: a game that respects your time, trusts your intelligence, and never forgets that fun should be the primary objective. Sometimes that's exactly what hell ordered.","Doom: the dark ages is a prequel to the modern doom trilogy.

“Straight ball hai, Rishabh aise yeh jaroori nahi hai theke? Marna hai to seedha lag jayega na iss ball pe zabardasti with the wind try kare jaa raha hai.”

KL Rahul press conference: On his role, being elder brother in team, role clarity and match

India vice-captain Rishabh Pant yet again proved why he is one of the most entertaining characters in world cricket, both with his audacious shots and with the conversations he has with himself in the middle.On Day 4 of the first Test against England at Headingley, Pant added another gem to his growing collection of iconic knocks overseas. After scoring a masterful 134 in the first innings, he stitched a momentum-shifting 195-run partnership with KL Rahul in the second innings and brought up his second century of the match, becoming the first Indian to score twin tons in a Test in England.While Pant’s flamboyance is well-known, what caught the stump mic and the cameras was his candid reminder to himself during one of his adventurous attempts against Shoaib Bashir. Eyeing another innovative stroke, Pant muttered,This self-advice came as he was trying to reverse scoop a delivery that did not warrant such a shot. Moments later, Pant calmed himself down and returned to a more traditional approach, eventually steering India towards a massive lead.Pant’s 118 off 140 balls in the second innings secured his place in an elite club. He became only the second designated wicketkeeper after Andy Flower to notch hundreds in both innings of a Test. He also matched the record for the most sixes in a Test innings in England, hitting nine maximums, a feat previously achieved by Andrew Flintoff and Ben Stokes Quiz: Who's that IPL player? His innings pushed his tally in England to 808 runs from 10 Tests at an impressive average above 42. His match total of 252 runs is now the highest for a wicketkeeper in a Test in England, surpassing Alec Stewart’s 204 against South Africa in 1998.After reaching his milestone, batting legend Sunil Gavaskar asked Pant to celebrate with a somersault. Pant, however, gave his trademark grin and saved the flip for another day. He instead continued his charge, smacking Joe Root for a mix of unconventional sweeps and classical lofted drives before falling for 118, caught by Zak Crawley.While India’s lower order folded quickly, Pant and Rahul’s fireworks gave India a massive cushion, leaving England to chase 371 on a wearing Headingley surface.Fans will remember this innings not just for the runs but also for Pant’s honest, almost comic self-talk that reflects the genius and unpredictability that define him.",Rishabh pant is the first indian to score twin tons in a test in england.
