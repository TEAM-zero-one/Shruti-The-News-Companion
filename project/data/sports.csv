Fritz upset by curfew

On the hottest day in Wimbledon 's history, defending champion Carlos Alcaraz survived a major scare at the hands of 38-year-old Fabio Fognini. It was also a day of numerous seeds falling and history being created by British players.Temperatures at the All England Club topped 32 degrees Celsius (89.6 Fahrenheit), surpassing the previous record of 29.3 Celsius set in 2001.Amid such conditions, Spain's Alcaraz had to dig deep for a 7-5, 6-7 (5/7), 7-5, 2-6, 6-1 win over Italy's retiring Fognini in a gruelling clash that lasted four hours and 37 minutes on Centre Court.It was only the first time since Roger Federer narrowly beat Alejandro Falla in 2010 that a defending champion had been taken to a fifth set in the Wimbledon first round.During the match, the 22-year-old Alcaraz rushed to help a spectator who had collapsed in the stands, handing over a bottle of water as medics came to the woman's aid.At the end of the match, Alcaraz pointed to Fognini in appreciation of the Italian's effort. Fognini later revealed his son Federico, an Alcaraz fan, was banned from speaking to the five-time major champion - leaving the youngster angry. To make up for it, Fognini asked Alcaraz for his shirt after the match as a gift for his son.Top women's seed Aryna Sabalenka used ice packs to stay cool during her 6-1, 7-5 win over Canadian qualifier Carson Branstine on Court One.The 27-year-old Belarusian, a three-time Grand Slam champion, has experienced tough three-set defeats in this year's Australian Open and French Open finals.Despite her success, she has never advanced beyond the Wimbledon semi-finals and missed last year's tournament due to a shoulder injury.“I felt really great. I'm super grateful to be healthy, ready to compete, and to have gotten through the first round,” Sabalenka said. Next, she will face Czech player Marie Bouzkova, ranked 48th in the world.As for Branstine, a professional model who funds her tennis by posing for the camera, it was a challenging day out in the sun as well. She needed six hair ties, hairspray for the bun and it still wasn't enough. Absence of a scrunchie didn't help either.Two-time Wimbledon finalist Ons Jabeur was visibly upset and tears streamed down her face as she withdrew from her first-round match against Viktoriya Tomova.The Tunisian player was behind 7-6 (7/5), 2-0 when she decided to withdraw against the Bulgarian, who is ranked 111th in the world.Meanwhile, Daniil Medvedev, a former US Open champion and a semi-finalist at Wimbledon for the past two years, experienced a meltdown during his match against France's Benjamin Bonzi.Bonzi won 7-6 (7/2), 3-6, 7-6 (7/3), 6-2 after three hours and seven minutes. An angry Medvedev smashed his racket against his chair at the conclusion of the match.In other results, Holger Rune lost after squandering a two-set lead, falling to Chile’s Nicolas Jarry. Former finalist Matteo Berrettini was also knocked out, and Stefanos Tsitsipas retired due to injury.Additionally, former French Open champion Jelena Ostapenko was defeated by Britain’s Sonay Kartal in three sets, 7-5, 2-6, 6-2.In all, 10 seeds fell on the opening day - seven among men (Medvedev, Rune, Berrettini, Tsitsipas, Tallon Griekspoor, Alexei Popyrin, Francisco Cerundolo) and three among women (Paula Badosa, Ostapenko, McCartney Kessler)For British tennis, it had already been a record-breaking Wimbledon before the gates even opened at SW19. Twenty-three British players entered the singles draws - the highest since 1984. And not since 1976 have there been 14 Britons in action on Day 1 of Wimbledon.By the time day one concluded, well semi-concluded due to the 11pm curfew, seven (Emma Raducanu, Katie Boulter, Sonay Kartal, Cameron Norrie, Billy Harris, Arthur Fery and Oliver Tarvet) had progressed to the second round - the most in a single day in the Open Era. The list includes Tarvet and Fery, ranked 733 and 461 in the world, respectively. The 21-year-old Tarvet pocketed £99,000 for his first round win, except he can't make more than £7,290 a year due to the financial rules.“But I’m not here for the money,” he said after joking he'd hire a private jet to fly to the US where he's a college student. “I’m here just for the experience and to stamp my mark on the ATP circuit. And I think I’ve done a good job so far.”American No. 1 Taylor Fritz expressed frustration, saying, “I couldn’t do anything,” after making a dramatic comeback on No. 1 Court on Monday night.In his first-round match against Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard, Fritz led in points and committed fewer errors after two sets. However, he found himself two sets down, losing two tiebreaks to the Frenchman, who has one of the biggest serves in the sport—larger than Fritz’s.Despite the odds, Fritz fought back to win the next two sets, including a dramatic fourth-set tiebreak. Trailing 5-1 and two points from defeat, he rallied to win. Jubilantly, he pumped his chest toward his box, yelled “let’s f—ing go,” and sat down, riding the momentum toward what he believed would be a victorious finis. Or so he thought.However, after a lengthy discussion with a tournament official, play was halted due to Wimbledon’s curfew, set at 11pm local time — even though it was only 10:18 pm when the match was paused. “Then don’t ask me,” Fritz said as he packed up his rackets and sat back in his chair, telling his box he “couldn’t do anything.”The All England Club confirmed that the match was suspended because of the curfew, which was 42 minutes away at the time. Remarkably, the previous four sets between Fritz and Perricard lasted 44, 48, 33, and 45 minutes, respectively, meaning only one of those sets could have been completed within the remaining time.","Carlos alcaraz beat fabio fognini in five sets in the first round of wimbledon.

“Their body language suggest something…”: Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce's subtle body language during NYC dinner hints at their true connection,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/their-body-language-suggest-something-taylor-swift-and-travis-kelces-subtle-body-language-during-nyc-dinner-hints-at-their-true-connection/articleshow/122148909.cms,"Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce's recent Manhattan outing has sparked discussions about their relationship's potential (TheImageDirect.com)

Body language expert says Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce are showing signs of lasting love

Over the weekend, Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce lit up Manhattan with what many are calling the ultimate display of youthful, romantic energy. But it wasn’t just the cute outfits and dinner date that had fans talking—it was the way they moved, dressed, and interacted. According to body language expert Judi James, their coordinated style and subtle affection hint at something deeper than celebrity chemistry: the belief that they may have truly found “the one.”Taylor Swift looked radiant in a flirty pale pink mini dress with gold buttons, while Travis Kelce kept it sleek in cropped black trousers, white socks, loafers, and a crisp white shirt. While this might seem like standard celebrity datewear, Judi James sees it as far more intentional. “Taylor and Travis’s styling and their body language suggest something of a time-warp,” she noted, pointing to their classic prom-queen and king aesthetic.This wasn’t just a fashionable night out. Judi James observed that Kelce’s wardrobe choices are starting to mirror Swift’s romantic style. “Travis's short-cropped black pants and white socks suggest he's gradually and happily style-twinning with her,” she said.But it was his subtle movements that said even more. “Travis sucks his lips in at one point to show he's taking the date very seriously and his large paw of a hand encases Taylor's hand in a clasp of macho protection. ”From their body positioning— Kelce confidently leading while Swift walked demurely behind—to the way she held her small handbag close, everything about their presence suggested a couple relishing that new, enchanted stage of romance. “Taylor's body language epitomizes 'demure' here, with her head lowered, her elbows pulled into her waist and that dinky little bag held in one hand,” James added.Judi James believes this ""first-date college look"" may not be accidental. “It could be a desire to stoke the idyllic romantic side of their relationship or a mutual wish to present each other as 'The One', going back to a teen-date state to delete any high-profile and sometimes less than agreeable relationships they've each had with others in the past,” she explained.Also Read: Why Taylor Swift’s love life feels louder with Travis Kelce than it ever did with Joe Alwyn Taylor Swift has long built her brand on emotional storytelling, and this softer, sweeter public persona may be a reflection of a new, more intentional chapter. If their body language is anything to go by, both Swift and Kelce are not just enjoying the moment — they’re laying the groundwork for something much more enduring.","Taylor swift and travis kelce's recent manhattan outing has sparked discussions about their relationship's potential.

Candace Parker's legacy reached new heights on Sunday night as the Los Angeles Sparks raised her iconic No. 3 jersey to the rafters at Crypto.com Arena. The halftime ceremony took place during a game against the Chicago Sky. It was a significant chapter in WNBA history. While Angel Reese powered the Sky to a 92-85 win over the Sparks, the true spotlight was on Parker as she was being immortalized by the team she led for 13 seasons. Los Angeles Lakers veteran LeBron James and Hall of Famer Magic Johnson shared their heartfelt messages for the former Sparks superstar.Candace Parker’s jersey retirement made her just the third player in Sparks history to receive the honor, joining Lisa Leslie and Penny Toler. Thousands filled the arena to celebrate her decorated career. Tributes poured in from basketball royalty. LeBron James, the NBA’s all-time scoring leader, took to Instagram to share a brief but powerful reaction to the moment, posting a video of the ceremony with the caption, “🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽”.Magic Johnson, Los Angeles Lakers icon and Sparks co-owner, offered a far more extensive tribute. Taking to X , Johnson wrote: “Candace Parker has left an indelible mark on the Los Angeles Sparks, not only as one of the greatest players to ever grace the court, but as a true ambassador of our franchise and women’s basketball as a whole.”The NBA legend continued, “Beginning with her arrival to the City of Angels in 2008, she not only lived up to the expectations placed on her as a two-time Gatorade Basketball Player of the Year and NCAA National Champion, she far exceeded them. Her unparalleled skill, relentless drive, and leadership elevated the Sparks to new heights and set a new standard of greatness. Candace is the best all-around player that has ever played in the WNBA. ”Johnson went on to add, “Her legacy is immeasurable — she redefined excellence, was a champion on the court and for the Los Angeles community and inspired countless fans and future generations of athletes. Very few champions get to see their jersey hanging from the rafters in this city. Retiring Candace’s No. 3 jersey is not just a celebration of her extraordinary career, but a tribute to the enduring mark she's left on this organization, the WNBA, and the city of Los Angeles. She will forever be a part of the Sparks family.”The tribute didn’t end there. WNBA Hall of Famer Lisa Leslie, who handed the franchise’s leadership to Parker in 2008, praised her successor with heartfelt emotion. “She changed the game. When I handed the keys over to Candace Parker, I knew the Sparks were in good hands,” Leslie said. “Nobody else can do what she’s done for the LA Sparks.”Parker, now a three-time WNBA champion, two-time MVP, and the league’s only player to win a title with three different teams, stood at center court with her family. Reflecting on her journey, she said, “It’s super important to see this jersey in the rafters before any others because my 13 years here were super special. It was ups, downs, wins, losses, heartaches and rewards, but it’s super special to share that with my teammates and coaches with an organization that bet on me with the first pick in the 2008 WNBA Draft. That was a long time ago.”Also Read: Dorian Finney-Smith opts out of Los Angeles Lakers deal, Houston Rockets emerge as serious free agency suitor Candace Parker’s No. 3 jersey will now live forever in Sparks history, as the team honored the legend in her post-WNBA life.

Standing 6'4"" and playing both forward and center, Parker’s versatility and dominance on the court are evident in her career averages: 16.0 points, 8.5 rebounds, and 4.0 assists per game over 410 appearances. She boasts a field goal percentage of 47.9%, a solid 24.4 PER (Player Efficiency Rating), and a win share of 64.3, underlining her efficiency and impact on both ends of the floor.As for Candace Parker's personal life, she and Anna Petrakova share a love story that blossomed through basketball. The two first crossed paths in 2012 while playing for UMMC Ekaterinburg, a Russian team where Parker was already a key player. Petrakova joined that season, and the pair quickly formed a strong bond that began as teammates and grew into something more.By early 2019, Parker proposed, and they quietly married in December that same year. They chose to keep their relationship private, only sharing the news two years later— along with the exciting reveal that they were expecting a baby.","Candace parker's no. 3 jersey was retired by the los angeles sparks on sunday night.

However, there is speculation that suggests thecould reunite Anthony Davis with this familiar face and his former 40-year-old teammate.According to Bleacher Report’s Greg Swartz, the Mavericks have a realistic path to acquiring James this summer without dismantling their core.Swartz outlines a potential deal where Dallas sends a package of role players and a future draft pick to Los Angeles:- Players Dallas could trade:- Daniel Gafford- P.J. Washington- Naji Marshall- Caleb Martin- Compensation:- Unprotected 2029 first-round pick""Financially, this trade can work for Dallas without having to give up any of their core players,"" Swartz noted. "" The Lakers could really use this influx of frontcourt talent to complement Doncic and Austin Reaves."" (H/t: Sporting News)- Reunites Davis and James, who won a title together in 2020.- Adds championship experience alongside rising star Cooper Flagg.- Keeps the team in title contention after their 2024 Finals run.- Gains younger, versatile pieces to build around Doncic.- Secures future draft capital.- Moves an aging star while maintaining competitiveness. LeBron James and Anthony Davis spent nearly six seasons together in Los Angeles, forming one of the league’s most dominant duos. Their 2020 bubble championship remains a highlight, but injuries and roster changes prevented further success.""James has stated on his Mind the Game podcast what a great situation Flagg is going into with veterans all around and getting to play for Jason Kidd,"" Swartz mentioned. A move to Dallas would allow James to play under Kidd—his former Lakers assistant—while joining forces with Davis, Kyrie Irving, and Flagg.While the trade is feasible, concerns remain:- Age and injuries: James is 40, and Davis has struggled with durability.- Chemistry: Integrating multiple stars isn’t always seamless.Still, Swartz believes the Mavericks offer an appealing setup: ""What makes Dallas a more desirable spot for James is the addition of Flagg, who raises this team's ceiling immensely.""A LeBron-to-Dallas trade would be a dramatic twist, but it aligns with both teams’ goals.

Poll Should Andrew Flintoff have pursued a career in WWE? Yes, it would have been exciting No, boxing was a better choice Maybe, depending on his fitness I have no opinion on this

Former England cricket all-rounder Andrew Flintoff nearly transitioned to professional wrestling after his cricket career ended. He was in negotiations with World Wrestling Entertainment ( WWE ) and came close to signing a contract for a match against The Undertaker After retiring from cricket, Flintoff explored various career options when he received broadcasting opportunities and discovered WWE as a potential path.""I just hid for a bit and started to wonder, 'What am I going to do now?' Some of the TV offers started to come, which was never the plan – I stumbled into that,"" Flintoff told The Overlap’s ""Stick to Cricket"" podcast. ""I nearly joined the WWE, I didn't want to box, that was never the plan. I would have been called 'Big Fred'""""What happened was, it got to a point in Dubai where I was unfit, I'd put on weight and was just not in a good place. I wanted to get fit again, but I needed motivation. As a kid, I loved WWE, so I came up with this idea, because I was doing League of Their Own with Sky, to fight the Undertaker in Manchester""Flintoff's idea reached WWE co-founder Vince McMahon , leading to direct communications between them. He began training for a potential showdown with The Undertaker in Manchester.""I wrote this treatment up and presented the idea to Sky, it started gathering momentum and next minute it's being passed onto WWE.

Challenges the couple faced and their rise above it



Under the glow of stadium lights and amidst the rhythmic pulse of tennis balls on court, a captivating partnership has emerged. Morgan Riddle, a Minnesota-born influencer-turned-courtroom companion, and Taylor Fritz, America’s tennis rising star, now share more than victories—they share a journey marked by cosmopolitan flair and genuine devotion. Their love story began in the shadow of a global pandemic, yet quickly gained warmth, resilience, and sparkle. As Morgan transformed from a Midwest theater lover into “the most famous woman in men’s tennis,” she and Taylor became symbols of modern romance meeting athletic ambition. Together, they've navigated the intensity of global tours, broadcast fame, and online controversies—all while championing a mission to “make tennis cool again.” This article uncovers how they met, how their bond blossomed both privately and on screen, and how Morgan has become a cultural force against the backdrop of tennis’s elite world.Taylor Fritz and Morgan Riddle’s path crossed in early 2020 on the exclusive dating app Raya, when Morgan—new to Los Angeles during COVID—sought connection. “Because it was during Covid, no restaurants were open, no bars were open so we ordered sushi,” she told People.“We went to his place and I made him watch Midsommar with me, the really messed up horror movie… I think I traumatized him a little bit.”Their first date, flanked by sushi and unsettling horror cinema, became a charming anecdote of mutual curiosity and comfort in isolation. From that moment, the pair grew inseparable—both emotionally and geographically—as Morgan soon joined Taylor on the ATP Tour, supporting him from tournament stands and fostering a shared mission: to breathe fresh energy into tennis culture.Born July 31, 1997, in Saint Paul, Minnesota, Morgan Riddle Kimm was raised with cultural roots grounded in one of America’s hockey heartlands. “Tennis was not a big aspect of her life growing up in Minnesota… I personally was more into theater and speech and debate, not athletic at all,” she explained on Hold On to Your Racket podcast.After earning a degree in English from Wagner College, Morgan briefly worked in real estate before entering media and influencer marketing. She held roles such as Media Director for Love Your Melon and later transitioned to full-time content creation by 2022.Morgan now curates engaging tennis content—from Instagram and TikTok to her YouTube channel—geared toward younger audiences and fashion-forward consumers. She even partnered with Wimbledon to host ""Wimbledon Threads,"" showcasing tournament fashion.Morgan’s online catchphrase—to “make tennis cool again”—is more than aspiration; it’s a calculated movement. With over 436,000 Instagram followers and a growing TikTok presence, she brings fresh attention to one of tennis’s most talented American men.Taylor appreciates her public visibility. Morgan told EssentiallySports, “We travel so well together… we get along really well, which is why I think we’ve been able to make it work the last couple of years.” And when criticism emerged over her content, Morgan swiftly defended her approach on The Squeeze podcast: “Well, f--- that,” she said of criticism—asserting pride in her public persona.Taylor’s backing has been unwavering. Morgan explained, “Taylor has always been really good about [blocking out the noise]… he was very helpful in coaching me through that.” Their mutual support became especially vital during tennis’s global spotlight via Netflix’s Break Point, where Morgan even shared behind-the-scenes glimpses with fans.Ever visible at Wimbledon, the US Open, and Indian Wells, Morgan has become a fixture alongside Taylor. A standout moment came at Wimbledon 2025, when she wore an elegant pink ensemble and was described by media as a “stylish yet figuratively tense” presence courtside as Taylor battled through a five-set epic.Their dynamic also has potential PR impact. A Glamour profile framed Morgan as part of a new wave of influential athlete partners, celebrating how women like her enhance both the sport and its stars.Together, they’ve logged over 30 weeks per year on the road, an uncommon commitment that Morgan says has tested and strengthened their bond: “How do you guys spend that much time…without wanting to rip each other’s heads off? But we get along really well.”Morgan’s rise hasn’t been without friction. Some traditionalists viewed her visibility as capitalizing on Taylor’s status. On The Squeeze, she confronted this head-on: “They expected me to sit in the box, be relatively private… I kinda came in guns blazing.” Taylor backed her stance: “When it first started happening…he’d be like, ‘Why are you reading that?’ Their unity remains unshaken: “We really love each other. We have a very healthy relationship [and] nothing that anyone says online is gonna have any sort of effect on that.”Morgan and Taylor appeared together in Netflix’s Break Point, offering fans a rare look at their off-court life. Morgan later commented: “I think everyone was iffy about it at first…but now the whole tour has warmed up to it.”In interviews, Taylor highlights Morgan’s influence in keeping routines structured and positive. Glamour’s WAG Revival piece also noted the couple’s synergy: “If his ranking had gone down, they'd say it's my fault,” Morgan acknowledged.Also read: The Ultimate Fan Ranking: 10 Greatest Female Tennis Players in History Morgan Riddle and Taylor Fritz represent a refreshing narrative in tennis—a story of love, ambition, and modern partnership.

Morgan’s mission to revitalize tennis culture, coupled with Taylor’s competitive drive, reflects a blend of public influence and private resilience.

Joe Burrow shoulders blame as Trey Hendrickson’s contract standoff puts Bengals ’ 2025 season at risk

$28M offer falls short as Hendrickson holdout threatens Bengals’ 2025 hopes



Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow is reportedly blaming himself—not the team—for the unresolved contract situation with star pass-rusher Trey Hendrickson. As Hendrickson’s holdout continues, Burrow’s reaction highlights leadership, but also underscores the growing pressure on the franchise ahead of the 2025 NFL season.According to ESPN’s Jeremy Fowler, Joe Burrow isn’t pointing fingers at the Bengals’ front office for failing to secure Hendrickson’s extension. Instead, he’s internalizing the issue, believing it’s on him to lead the team through the distraction.“He puts it all on his shoulders and says, ‘Hey, we have to get this done. I’m the quarterback of this franchise,’” Fowler reported.While that mindset is admirable, Burrow doesn’t control contract negotiations. The Bengals have reportedly offered Hendrickson a deal worth $28 million per year. But considering Hendrickson has recorded more sacks than any edge rusher in the NFL over the past two seasons, that offer may not reflect his true market value.According to Over the Cap, a $28 million annual salary would rank Hendrickson eighth among edge rushers, trailing players like T.J. Watt and Myles Garrett, even though Hendrickson has outperformed many of them recently.His camp is pushing for a top-five salary, and rightly so, given his consistent impact on the Bengals' defense.Fowler added that Hendrickson remains firmly committed to his stance and is prepared to miss games if a new deal isn’t reached. For a Bengals team aiming to rebound in the AFC and make a deep playoff run, losing their top defensive player could be a massive blow.Burrow’s willingness to take the blame shows leadership, but it doesn’t change the reality. The Bengals must resolve this holdout before it disrupts team chemistry and derails their 2025 campaign.Also Read: Jim Kelly ranked top 15 Super Bowl era QB: Ahead of Lamar Jackson, Bart Starr, and Warren Moon If the Bengals want to remain competitive in 2025, securing Trey Hendrickson with a fair-market deal is critical.

Gary Bettman on possible NHL expansion, the growth of hockey in the US & more | The Pat McAfee Show

As the 2025–26 NHL season was about to begin, Gary Bettman spoke about the progress of the league on “The Pat McAfee Show” in a candid manner. From international tournaments to franchise strength, Bettman went through hockey's growing momentum with a wide-angle view. The conversation went more into the off-ice decisions and global engagement that are now designing the future of professional hockey, rather than staying on scores and standings.In his talk, Gary Bettman emphasized that the NHL is growing in the international sphere. With the 4 Nations Face-Off happening recently and the Milano Cortina 2026 Olympics around the corner, it probably makes him proud that the players are so invested in representing their countries. Moreover, endless international events bring fan engagement to all corners of the globe, but Bettman pointed out that international athletes feel an onslaught of passion from within, never seeing traffic of such magnitude ever crossing their career path.Switching gears, Bettman praised the Florida Panthers for their back-to-back Stanley Cup wins, from their strong ownership, commitment, and dedication from the players.He said that if a team provides the right culture and resources, talent is attracted to it and remains long-term competitive. This is the big difference, he said, between sustainable teams in this league.Expansion talk led to some light-hearted banter as the proud Indianapolis native suggested his city as a potential future team location. Nearly eight cities have shown interest, Bettman affirmed, but the NHL is not pursuing expansion currently. The anticipated strength and stability of its 32 teams are utmost in focus right now, he said, hailing them as the healthiest and most engaged the league has ever seen.Reflecting on the wrapping interview, Bettman said about the 2025 NHL Draft that it was a memorable event: the emotional moments and stars from top draft pick Matthew Schaefer’s reaction to the involvement of celebrities all came together to make it a significant night for our sport, in his words.Also Read: Evander Kane returns to Vancouver Canucks: The hometown dream tarnished with a sudden incident The thoughts from Bettman reveal a league with flux in its native North America and an increased period of extension in global stature.

“Thank you @carlosalcaraz for the concern shown to my mum today who was taken ill during your tennis match at Centre Court @Wimbledon today. Unlikely you’ll see this message but I can try! Thank you @BBCSport”

“Fans are not used to having this weather,”

“Sitting five hours in the sun without moving can be really hard.”

An unexpected event happened during Carlos Alcaraz’s thrilling first-round match at Wimbledon 2025. The crowd was focused on the tennis, but suddenly, all eyes turned to a fan in trouble. What followed was an emotional moment of kindness and care that brought attention to the extreme weather and showed a different side of one of tennis’s biggest stars.Carlos Alcaraz halted play during his first-round match on Centre Court on Monday, June 30, 2025 to help a fan who had passed from heat. The match against 38-year-old Fabio Fognini was already tight over five sets. Still, Alcaraz three-nil half through the fifth set suddenly stopped play.The scorching 91°F (33°C), the hottest first day of major draw play in Wimbledon history, had caused an elderly spectator in the stands to become sick. Alcaraz, now ATP-ranked No. 2 dashed into medical personnel as the fan was given a bottle of water swiftly.Officials made certain the fan received correct treatment, hence the game was postponed over fifteen minutes.

Jimmy Butler’s journey from homeless teen to NBA stardom

Jimmy Butler started from absolute scratch in building a life that gave him a name, fame, and a game — literally. Life had been tough for him from the start. He never even knew who his father was, as he had walked away when Butler was still an infant. Then, at just 13, his mother threw him out of the house. With no home or money, Butler kept himself going with the help of friends and made it to the NBA through sheer hard work, grit, and determination.In an old interview with ESPN, Butler expressed his dislike for being pitied over his tough childhood. “There's nothing to feel sorry about. I love what happened to me. It made me who I am. I'm grateful for the challenges I've faced. Please, don't make them feel sorry for me.”Butler has every right to the respect he’s earned for surviving his teenage years by moving from one friend’s house to another. “I don’t like the look of you. You gotta go,” his mother had said while throwing him out when he was just 13.Among the friends who helped him was Jordan Leslie, who later became an NFL player. Leslie’s mother welcomed Butler into their big family of six-seven children and let him stay with them for a few months — on one condition: he had to follow the same rules as her own kids.Butler once revealed that he couldn’t believe her graciousness, especially after how his own parents had treated him. Michelle Lambert, Leslie’s mother, told ESPN, “I told him my kids looked up to him. He had to stay out of trouble, work hard in school, and set an example. And you know what? Jimmy did it. Anything I asked him to do, he did it without asking questions.”After managing to get through high school, it was Butler’s basketball talent that paved the way forward. He eventually earned an athletic scholarship to Marquette University, where he represented the college team and was named to the All-Big East Honorable Mention list twice during his second and third years.Despite everything, Butler has said he loves his parents and occasionally meets them, holding no hard feelings.Also Read: NBA Trade Rumors: Golden State Warriors predicted to land $20 million Boston Celtics center to support Stephen Curry and Jimmy Butler and improve title odds He is now a father to a daughter and two sons with his ex-girlfriend, Kaitlin Nowak.

Poll Do you think Carlos Alcaraz's act of kindness should be recognized more in sports? Yes, athletes should be role models. No, it's just part of the game.

Amid the blistering heat of Wimbledon 's hottest opening day in history, it wasn't just the tennis that stole the show - but a moment of genuine compassion from defending champion Carlos Alcaraz that left a lasting impression.Temperatures soared to a sweltering 33°C (91°F) on Monday, marking the hottest Day 1 since the tournament began 148 years ago. Organizers scrambled to keep spectators safe with added water stations, shaded areas, and staff equipped with refillable bottles. Still, the oppressive heat proved too much for some.Midway through a dramatic five-setter against veteran Fabio Fognini on Centre Court, Alcaraz noticed an elderly fan in distress. Without hesitation, he halted play and pointed out the incident to officials. He handed a water bottle into the stands as medical personnel arrived, delaying the match for over 15 minutes.Later that evening, a poignant moment unfolded off the court. The daughter of the woman who fainted posted a message on X, writing: ""Thank you @carlosalcaraz for the concern shown to my mum today who was taken ill during your match.

Exclusive | Arjuna Awardee Vantika Agrawal: 'People still ask, 'Chess is fine, but what do you really do?''

Poll Do you believe that chess is perceived differently in Northern and Southern India? Yes, definitely No, it's the same everywhere

NEW DELHI: In the hit HBO series ""Game of Thrones"", those from the North and the South had a contrasting approach towards dominance and survival. And for eventual success? The blood and instinct of the North had to join hands with the alliance-building of the South.Along those lines, a similar story is playing out in Indian chess.23-year-old Vantika Agrawal, a double gold medallist from the 2024 Chess Olympiad and an Arjuna Awardee, says she feels let down by the way chess is perceived in the northern part of the country.""In North India, there is no culture of chess,"" the Uttar Pradesh-born chess star tells TimesofIndia.com.""If someone asks what you do here, and you say, 'I'm a chess player,' their response is usually, 'Okay, but what do you actually do? What are you studying?' I think it's still the same story, even after winning so many medals. People still ask, 'Chess is fine, but what do you really do?'""Her words land like a checkmate: honest, sharp, and damning. And she is not alone.If a line is drawn in the middle, the southern part of India would undoubtedly be the undisputed Dragonstone of Indian chess. From Viswanathan Anand and Koneru Humpy to D Gukesh, from Praggnanandhaa to his sister Vaishali, the land has produced enough crops.Whereas, in North India, in places like Delhi, Haryana, Punjab, and Uttar Pradesh, the board looks starkly different.Delhi Chess Association (DCA) president Bharat Singh Chauhan doesn’t sugarcoat it: “By birth, North Indians are different and South Indians are different.There’s a massive cultural difference between North and South India. If I put it bluntly, in the South, even a billionaire can be seen wearing slippers and standing at a bus stop, while here in the North, even someone with Rs 5 crore gets treated like royalty.""In the North, chess often battles for legitimacy — seen by many as a hobby rather than a career.""Speaking of Delhi specifically, Parimarjan Negi, a GM from Delhi who is now settled in the US, and GM Sahaj Grover, too, have almost quit chess. They feel like whatever they wanted to achieve from this sport, they have achieved it. It’s a cultural and mindset difference. In the South, there is a deep-rooted chess culture. Even if you talk to Viswanathan Anand today, you’ll see the difference,"" added the DCA president.The numbers back him up. Delhi NCR alone sees Rs 5 crore in monthly earnings across 200-odd chess coaches. Yet, the quality is not up to the mark, with families switching coaches for marginal cost differences.""Today, there’s no chess player dying of hunger. Here, the thing is, nobody retires. There’s also no control over trainers. Many come promising, 'I’ll make your child the next Anand,' but they’re lying. It’s just marketing. For a profit of Rs 5,000, people switch coaches. That’s what we lack here,"" Chauhan elaborated. ""In the South, there’s loyalty — like Vishnu Prasanna has been with Gukesh for years. The same goes for RB Ramesh and Praggnanandhaa, Vaishali, Aravindh Chithambaram. That culture doesn’t exist here. We are trained thugs.""ALSO READ: 'Earlier, I used to beat Indians at will': What global chess stars in their 30s, 50s, and 80s say about India's dominance Grandmaster SL Narayanan, who hails from Kerala — a state often grouped into the broad 'South' label — goes a step further to make a sharp distinction. “People label everything as ‘South,’ but honestly, only Tamil Nadu has that level of chess support,"" the 27-year-old said. ""In my state, if you become a Grandmaster, it's still not a big deal. But Tamil Nadu? The government awards you. That motivation is powerful.”He isn’t exaggerating. International Arbiter and senior chess administrator Gopakumar Sudhakaran, who also hails from Kerala, says Tamil Nadu’s emergence as the mecca of Indian chess is no accident — it’s the result of cultural evolution. And surprisingly, the COVID-19 pandemic, despite its devastation, played a significant role in accelerating this shift.""In Tamil Nadu, chess is part of household culture. Even if it’s not competitive, the father, mother, everyone knows how to play. That’s not as common in the North. But it's just how societies evolve differently,"" Sudhakaran added.""Post-COVID, online platforms have really helped bridge the gap. Earlier, we couldn’t imagine International Masters coming from places like Jammu & Kashmir; now, it’s happening. Coaching is more accessible, and we’ve entered a kind of cosmopolitan training environment.""Chess was once seen as gambling in some parts of North India, but now parents see its value and support their children.""Shyam Sundar M, a 2013 Grandmaster who now coaches young talents like FIDE World Junior Champion Pranav V and GM Srihari LR at Chennai’s Chess Thulir academy, reveals how and why so many Tamil Nadu players dedicate themselves entirely to chess, often at the cost of academics.“In Tamil Nadu, many players dedicate themselves fully to chess, often sacrificing academics. And I have seen a large trend since the COVID-19 days. Some schools here, like Velammal, are supportive, offering flexibility in terms of attendance and even financial help. When Gukesh won (the World Championship), he was gifted a car worth nearly Rs 1 crore. The state government also gives cash awards,"" the 33-year-old Shyam Sundar explained.“In Tamil Nadu, more players keep coming up. So naturally, some parents start thinking maybe even my child can become like that. They get inspired by other kids’ success. And when more players come, overall interest in the game also increases. That’s how the game becomes more fair and competitive.”The North isn’t barren. But it lacks the sacred institutions that the South has carefully cultivated. Like Jon Snow staring down Daenerys’s dragons, the northern talent still burns bright, just without the firepower behind it.The challenge now is to forge a unified kingdom, one where Vantika doesn’t have to explain her profession, where switching coaches isn’t routine, and where a child from Rohtak can dream as vividly as one from Rameswaram.","Vantika agrawal, a double gold medallist from the 2024 chess olympiad, says she feels let down by the way chess is perceived in the northern part of the country. Delhi chess association (dca) president bharat singh chauhan doesn’t sugarcoat it: “there’s a massive cultural difference between north and south india"" grandmaster sl narayanan, who hails from kerala, says only tamil nadu has that level of chess support.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122159120,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-65004,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
