Poll Should players be compared to legends like Virat Kohli? Yes, it motivates them No, it adds unnecessary pressure

Former Pakistan batter Ahmed Shehzad has come out strongly against the trend of comparing players, particularly Babar Azam , with modern-day great Virat Kohli . Speaking in an interview, Shehzad said that such comparisons are not only unfair but also add unnecessary pressure on players, which is visible in Babar’s current struggles.“When everything was going well, you were running campaigns comparing players. Now that the performances are not coming, you are saying ‘don’t compare two players’. Why not? Virat Kohli ’s comparison cannot be made with anyone in the world. He is a legend of this generation, a role model. You cannot compare him even with MS Dhoni . Dhoni may have been a great captain, but as a batter, cricketer, and athlete, Kohli stands alone. No one should be compared with anyone because it’s unfair and it adds extra pressure, which we are now seeing on Babar Azam,” Shehzad said.Babar’s dip in form has been a talking point for months. He has now gone 72 consecutive international innings without scoring a century, with his last hundred coming against Nepal. Since 2023, no other cricketer has endured a longer drought without a century.Adding to that, since 2024, Babar and Mohammad Rizwan are the only two batters from full-member nations with a strike rate below 80.The struggles have coincided with a change in leadership. Babar is no longer Pakistan’s captain across formats, having stepped down earlier this year following criticism over results and his own performances. The recent ODI series against West Indies only intensified the scrutiny, as Pakistan suffered a 202-run loss to concede their first bilateral ODI series to the Caribbean side in 34 years.Shehzad’s remarks highlight the pressure top players face when placed on the same pedestal as legends, and why the weight of public comparisons can often prove damaging to form and confidence.","Former pakistan batter ahmed shehzad has come out strongly against the trend of comparing players, particularly babar azam, with modern-day great virat kohli.

I will have something to say about it…when I can legally.”However, Joy Taylor strongly denied any connection between her lawsuit and getting fired from FOX Sports.The former FOX Sports executive added, ""I will say that that situation and that suit had nothing to do with the changes that happened at FS1. I mean, I think from a logical standpoint, everyone can just look at it and see what the changes were and that there were three shows that were cut.""For the unversed, earlier this year, Joy Taylor, Charlie Dixon and Emmanuel Acho had found themselves in a huge legal mess.Former FOX Sports’ employee Noushin Faraji had filed a lawsuit against them for “sexual misconduct”.As per the lawsuit filed by Noushin Faraji, apparently, Charlie Dixon had tried to get close to her even though she rejected his advances.

Why This Matters for the Los Angeles Lakers

The Odds of This Trade Happening

Thecould be preparing for another bold roster shake-up, with reports suggesting the team may explore a trade that sendsto the Sacramento Kings in exchange for forwardand guard. The move would aim to build a more balanced lineup around newly-extended superstar Luka Doncic and NBA legend LeBron James.On August 2, the Los Angeles Lakers officially committed to a new era by signing Doncic to a three-year, $165 million contract extension. Now, with two of the league’s best playmakers on the floor, General Manager Rob Pelinka may look to complement them with versatile two-way talent rather than another ball-dominant guard. Austin Reaves delivered a career year in the 2024-25 season, showcasing his scoring and playmaking ability. However, his lack of defensive presence could make him a less-than-ideal fit alongside Doncic over a full season.Rishav Bhat of ClutchPoints noted the potential reasoning behind a move for Keegan Murray, writing: “Despite Murray being one of the brightest young players the Kings have, he has emerged as a trade candidate because he is also one of the only remaining trade assets on their roster.At 24 years old and on a modest $11.1 million salary, Murray offers rare upside, strong defense, secondary scoring, and a team-friendly contract that the Kings can make use of in pursuit of a bigger star. ”If the Kings seek a replacement for point guard De’Aaron Fox - traded to the San Antonio Spurs last season - Austin Reaves could fill that role. For the Los Angeles Lakers , Keegan Murray and Keon Ellis would bring complementary skills that could fit seamlessly with Doncic and James.The 6-foot-8 forward has emerged as one of Sacramento’s most promising young players. His combination of size, defensive versatility, and efficient scoring could help stabilize the Los Angeles Lakers’ frontcourt.Ellis, a 6-foot-6 undrafted shooting guard, became one of Sacramento’s breakout performers in 2024-25. His elite three-point shooting and defensive instincts make him an appealing target for Los Angeles.Ellis’ defensive rating and ability to stretch the floor could make him the ideal backcourt partner for Doncic, who thrives alongside high-efficiency shooters and defensive-minded guards.• Fit with Stars: Doncic and James already provide elite playmaking, so adding players who excel off the ball and on defense could balance the roster.• Defensive Boost: Murray and Ellis both offer strong defensive metrics, something the Lakers need after recent struggles on that end.• Youth and Upside: At 24 and 25, Murray and Ellis align with a long-term approach while still being ready to contribute immediately.Also read: NBA Trade News: Denver Nuggets Sign $578,577 Dallas Mavericks Rookie to Bolster Wing Depth and Improve Championship Odds While the concept makes sense for both sides in theory, there’s no indication talks are active. The Kings may be hesitant to part with Murray, while the Los Angeles Lakers could weigh whether moving on from Austin Reaves is worth the risk. Still, as the Lakers look to maximize Doncic’s prime years, surrounding him with versatile, defensive-minded talent may become a necessity sooner rather than later.",The los angeles lakers could be preparing for another bold roster shake-up.

She is also involved in philanthropic endeavors and has proven herself to be a smart and successful businesswoman apart from being a NBA legend’s wife.According to multiple sources like AfroTech and Sportskeeda, the wife of Carmelo Anthony, La La Anthony, has amassed a great fortune.

Vikings ’ inclusion of male cheerleaders sparks mixed reactions from fanbase

Antonio Brown’s history of polarizing behavior overshadows preseason buzz



Former NFL wide receiver Antonio Brown has stirred fresh controversy after publicly targeting one of the Minnesota Vikings’ newly appointed male cheerleaders. The incident comes at a time when the team’s decision to add male performers to its cheer squad has already divided fans, sparking discussions about tradition, inclusivity, and the evolving culture of the NFL.The Vikings recently confirmed that Blaize Shiek and Louie Conn would join their cheerleading roster for the 2025 season. The decision was presented as a step toward gender equality and representation within the organization, aligning with a growing trend of NFL teams adopting co-ed cheer squads.While many supporters applauded the move as progressive, others pushed back, arguing it clashed with long-standing game-day traditions. Some season ticket holders reportedly went as far as threatening to cancel their memberships over the change. This divide existed well before Antonio Brown’s remarks but has now been amplified by the former wideout’s public criticism, in which he tweeted, “F*ggot of the Day” alongside a video of Shiek.Antonio Brown, who enjoyed a 12-season NFL career and a Super Bowl victory, has built a reputation for courting controversy both during and after his playing days.His latest jab comes just as the Vikings have kicked off their preseason with a 20-10 win over the Houston Texans. The team is now preparing to face the New England Patriots and Tennessee Titans before opening their regular season against the Chicago Bears on September 8.Much of the preseason focus had been on the return of rookie quarterback J.J. McCarthy from a season-ending injury last year. However, Brown’s comments have shifted the conversation from on-field performance to a broader cultural clash.Also Read: “Overhyped and overrated”: Josh Allen’s wife Hailee Steinfeld faces harsh criticism from Dave Portnoy For many observers, the situation underscores the resistance that often accompanies change in sports culture.

Shedeur Sanders' oblique injury escalates Cleveland Browns’ quarterback preseason troubles



Cleveland Browns backup QB battle continues with Pickett Gabriel and Tyler Huntley in spotlight amid Sanders' injury



Cleveland Browns fans have been bracing for uncertainty at quarterback all preseason, and the latest setback only deepens the concern. Rookie Shedeur Sanders, who impressed in his preseason debut, has suffered an oblique injury during practice, adding to previous hamstring issues for Kenny Pickett and Dillon Gabriel. With the regular season approaching, questions about the Browns’ starting QB and roster strategy are intensifying.Shedeur Sanders’ performance in the first preseason game had many fans hoping he could start in Week 1. Yet, the unofficial depth chart still lists him fourth, behind Dillon Gabriel—a move that has sparked debate among supporters and analysts. Head coach Kevin Stefanski had indicated Sanders would start the team’s second preseason game against the Eagles if Pickett and Gabriel were unavailable. Now, with Sanders sidelined for evaluation, that plan remains uncertain.The possibility of all three young quarterbacks being unavailable puts veteran Joe Flacco in the spotlight. At 40, Flacco is the most experienced option, though he has not taken part in preseason action. For a team in rebuilding mode, this presents a delicate balance to develop the younger quarterbacks with live reps or rely on Flacco’s steadiness to navigate the early weeks.Pickett appears to be the odd man out but could still make the roster if either Gabriel or Sanders is moved to the practice squad. Gabriel’s placement ahead of Sanders continues to baffle fans, while Tyler Huntley, brought in as preseason depth, is the most likely to be released unless he impresses in the remaining games.Also Read: Aaron Rodgers’ awkward ‘Joe Biden’ moment exposes his struggle to fit in with Steelers, and how Cam Heyward and I.J.

Jeff Blashill is set to lead Chicago Blackhawks, focusing on developing the team’s young roster and building a culture of competitiveness.

In Detroit, he led the team to the playoffs in his first season but missed postseason play in subsequent years, finishing with a record of 204-261-72 over 537 games. His focus on fundamentals and player development aligns with the Blackhawks’ current emphasis on nurturing young talent.Speaking ahead of the 2026 season, Blashill emphasized the importance of growth: “The reality is our growth will be based on how quickly our young guys mature. Not only how they mature physically, but more importantly, how their games mature.”Training camp, scheduled for September 15–19, 2025, will introduce Blashill’s system.
