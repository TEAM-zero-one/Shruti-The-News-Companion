Patrick Mahomes battles quiet rehab as Brittany Mahomes creates stability for their children,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/patrick-mahomes-battles-quiet-rehab-as-brittany-mahomes-creates-stability-for-their-children/articleshow/127473169.cms,"Patrick Mahomes is enduring a demanding offseason as he recovers from an ACL and LCL tear, limiting his usual family routine. While he focuses on rehabilitation and a possible Week 1 return, Brittany Mahomes is creating joyful moments for their children, helping maintain normalcy as the Chiefs star patiently works through recovery.

Brittany Mahomes steps forward as Patrick Mahomes grinds through rehab

Patrick Mahomes is used to controlling chaos on the field. This offseason, control is not an option. The Kansas City Chiefs quarterback is rehabbing a serious knee injury in near silence, learning patience while his body resets and his routine disappears. Training days have turned into long recovery sessions, and the familiar rhythm of movement, travel, and playtime now looks very different.At home, life keeps moving. Brittany Mahomes has taken on the emotional heavy lifting, making sure Sterling, Bronze, and Golden Raye still experience joy while their father watches more than he participates. The family recently stepped out together, not for football, but for normalcy. It was a small escape, yet a telling one, as Mahomes continues one of the toughest offseasons of his career.The injury changed everything. Patrick Mahomes tore his ACL and LCL late in the season after taking a hit while extending a play against the Chargers. Surgery followed, along with a long recovery timeline that demands restraint, something not often associated with his improvisational style.Brittany documented a family trip to Disney On Ice, sharing moments of Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, and Donald Duck skating as the family briefly stepped away from their Missouri home.She described the day simply as the “best time today,” a phrase that reflected effort, not ease.Behind the scenes, Mahomes is already focused on returning. His goals remain clear, even as medical caution shapes every step. “I want to be ready for Week 1,” Mahomes said. “The doctors said I could. But I can't predict what will happen throughout the process. That's the goal to play Week 1 and have no restrictions.“You want to be out there healthy and give us the best chance to win. I hope to do some things in OTAs and training camp and be able to do things there.”Outside voices have urged patience. Pro Football Talk’s Mike Florio has noted how late-season ACL injuries complicate timelines, especially for quarterbacks who rely on movement. Examples like Adrian Peterson offer hope, but Mahomes faces multiple ligament repairs in a modern recovery environment built around caution.For now, the Chiefs star heals quietly. Brittany keeps life bright. Together, they move forward one careful step at a time.","Patrick mahomes tore his acl and lcl late in the season.

Emma Raducanu, Eugenie Bouchard, and Marta Kostyuk react to Katie Boulter’s Australian Open look

Alex de Minaur did the winning on court, but off the court, it was his fiancée Katie Boulter who stole the spotlight at the 2026 Australian Open. After Alex de Minaur beat Frances Tiafoe in straight sets in the third round in Melbourne, fans were not just talking about his tennis. They were also talking about a glamorous photo shared by his fiancée, British tennis player Katie Boulter. She attended the match looking stylish and confident, and the photo quickly caught attention across the tennis world.What made it bigger was the reaction from famous players. Emma Raducanu, Eugenie Bouchard, and Marta Kostyuk all noticed the post and shared their love in the comments. One comment, in particular, went viral and sparked wide talk online. It compared Boulter’s look to Kate Middleton, the Princess of Wales. The moment mixed tennis, fashion, and personality, making it one of the most talked-about off-court moments of the Australian Open so far.On Saturday, January 24, a day after Alex de Minaur’s third-round win over Frances Tiafoe, Katie Boulter shared a photo on Instagram from the Australian Open. The 29-year-old British player looked elegant and relaxed as she supported her fiancé from the stands.Katie Boulter added a fun caption to the post. She wrote, “51% shareholder 😏.” The line was a playful response to former tennis star Jim Courier. Courier had joked that de Minaur would become a “49% shareholder” in their marriage during on-court talk after the match.The post quickly drew comments from top names in women’s tennis. Retired Canadian player Eugenie Bouchard left the most talked-about reaction. She wrote, “Kate Middleton vibes.” The comment compared Boulter’s look to Catherine, Princess of Wales, and fans loved it.Emma Raducanu also reacted with a heart-eyes emoji, “😍.” Ukrainian player Marta Kostyuk followed with a warm message, writing, “Beautiful 😍🥰.” Their responses helped push the moment across social media.Later, Alex de Minaur spoke about wedding planning after the match. He said, “Honestly, the fact that we’re both tennis players and we’ve both got quite a busy schedule helps. We are doing as much as we can together.” He added, “I’m sure when it comes to the details of napkins and flowers and decoration purposes, that’s not my forte. I’ll leave that to Katie.”On court, de Minaur kept moving forward. He beat Alexander Bublik in the fourth round to reach the quarterfinals. His next match will be tough, as he is set to face Carlos Alcaraz. De Minaur has lost all five of his past matches against the Spanish star.","Alex de minaur beat frances tiafoe in straight sets in the third round of the australian open.

The post captured a rare off field moment for Blake Snell and his family



Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Blake Snell may be navigating the intensity of another demanding MLB season, but his family recently offered fans a refreshing glimpse into life away from the spotlight. His wife, Haeley Snell, took to Instagram to share intimate vacation moments from Maui, featuring the couple and their children in a serene island setting.The photos reflected a calm, unhurried atmosphere, capturing the family dressed elegantly amid lush greenery and open skies. Paired with the caption, “phone on dnd,” the post subtly highlighted the value of disconnecting and being present. Fans quickly connected with the sentiment, responding warmly to a moment that felt genuine rather than staged.One of the main reasons why the Maui photos resonated was due to their simplicity. In one image, Blake and Haeley were standing together in a tropical background, whereas another image depicts the couple with their children, with a lot of emphasis on closeness and balance. The casual nature of the pictures was refreshing, a contrast to the stress that typically envelops the life of a star pitcher.The comments section was full of positive remarks about the family being warm and the calm surroundings.Some of the fans commented on how natural the scene was, enjoying a glimpse of Snell outside game days and stat lines.Out of social media, the continuity and development are still evident in the professional life of Snell. He was selected by the Tampa Bay Rays in the first round of 2011 MLB Draft and made his debut in Major league in 2016 and gradually became one of the most trusted left handed pitchers in the baseball game. His most successful year was 2018 as he won the American League Cy Young Award by topping the league in wins and earned run average.To further solidify his reputation, Snell was traded to the San Diego Padres before the 2021 season and won a second Cy Young Award in 2023. In 2024, he moved to the San Francisco Giants and made one of the highlights of the season by throwing a no hitter against Cincinnati Reds. In 2025, he joined the Los Angeles Dodgers on a five year contract and helped the club to win the World Series against the Toronto Blue Jays.The subtle Maui post by Haeley was a silent reminder to fans that despite milestones and championships, family time will remain ever relevant.","Los angeles dodgers pitcher blake snell and his family are on vacation in maui.

Does it have a long-term effect?’ Joe Rogan says 49ers injury pattern doesn’t add up as team opens probe,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/does-it-have-a-long-term-effect-joe-rogan-says-49ers-injury-pattern-doesnt-add-up-as-team-opens-probe/articleshow/127556512.cms,"Joe Rogan reacts to the San Francisco 49ers’ electrical substation injury theory as the team confirms it will investigate player safety concerns. (Image via Getty)

Joe Rogan calls the injury trend ‘not normal’ while pointing to data dating back more than a decade

John Lynch confirms 49ers will look into the theory while stressing player safety comes first

Joe Rogan didn’t hedge his words this week when a long-running conspiracy theory around the San Francisco 49ers resurfaced on his podcast. The claim centers on an electrical substation located next to the team’s training facility and Levi’s Stadium, with some suggesting it may be contributing to the franchise’s unusually high injury rate.The conversation gained new weight after 49ers general manager John Lynch confirmed the organization plans to investigate the theory. While experts continue to dispute any medical link, the team has acknowledged the volume of injuries is a concern worth examining.Rogan addressed the topic on his podcast while speaking with guest Paul Rooslie, reacting to claims that electromagnetic fields near the facility could be affecting player health. He referenced discussions among players that reportedly began more than a decade ago.“The players started talking about all this in 2012, I believe,” Rogan said. “And people were like, ‘All that’s nonsense.’ Now, the stats are in, and you’re looking at the amount of injuries that come from this area, it’s like, this is not normal.”Rogan went further, arguing that the number and severity of injuries tied to the 49ers stand out compared to the rest of the league.“So, there’s a disproportionate amount of catastrophic injuries that come out of San Francisco and their training facility is right outside this power station,” he said.“Way more Achilles tendon blowouts, way more knees blown out, way more catastrophic ligament and tendon ruptures.”He emphasized that his focus was not on proving a conclusion, but on questioning whether the pattern warrants scrutiny.“Electricity,” Rogan said. “By the EMF signal. EMF signals we know disrupt human beings, but to what extent?”San Francisco has not endorsed the theory, but Lynch confirmed this week that the organization is taking it seriously enough to explore. Speaking to reporters, the general manager said the team cannot ignore claims tied to player health, even if they remain unproven.“Because it deals with, allegedly, the health and safety of our players, I think you have to look into everything,” Lynch said.“We’ve been reaching out to anyone and everyone to see, does a study exist other than a guy sticking an apparatus underneath the fence and coming up with a number that I have no idea what that means?”Lynch also acknowledged skepticism surrounding the theory while making clear the team will not dismiss it outright.“We’ve heard that debunked,” he said. “The health and safety of our players is of the utmost priority. We aren’t going to turn a blind eye.”The renewed attention comes after an injury-heavy 2025 season for San Francisco. Fred Warner, Nick Bosa, George Kittle, and Brock Purdy were among the notable players who missed time. The 49ers reached the playoffs, defeated the Philadelphia Eagles in the wild-card round, then suffered a 41-6 loss to the Seattle Seahawks in the divisional round.","The san francisco 49ers have been linked to an electrical substation near their training facility and levi’s stadium.

Jordan’s $75 million bet on Zion Williamson

Zion Williamson in the 2025-26 NBA season

The Jumpman is officially moving on. In a move that has sent shockwaves through the sneaker world and NBA Twitter alike, Jordan Brand is reportedly discontinuing Zion Williamson’s signature shoe line. The Zion 4, which hit shelves in early 2025, will serve as the final chapter of a partnership that once felt like a guaranteed dynasty.While Zion remains on the Jordan roster for now, the sunsetting of his line marks a massive pivot for a brand that once bet the house on the Duke phenom. For fans who remember the sheer hype of 2019, this isn't just a business decision, it’s the end of one of the most polarizing eras in modern sports marketing.To understand how things got here, one needs to take a look back at the absolute frenzy surrounding Zion’s entry into the league. He was drafted as the #1 overpick in 2019 by the New Orleans Pelicans over Ja Morant. But before he even played a single second of NBA basketball, Williamson signed a monster 7-year, $75 million deal with Jordan Brand in July of 2019. It was the second-largest rookie shoe contract in history, behind LeBron James’ legendary $90 million deal in 2003.The hype generated alongside the #1 draft pick and monstrous rookie deal with Jordan was undeniable. Zion was seen as the Chosen One for a new generation of NBA players due to his size, skill, and athleticism. He was supposed to carry the Jumpman torch into the future.However, the journey has been anything but smooth. From the infamous exploding shoe incident at Duke to a series of high-profile injuries that kept him off the court for nearly half of his career games, the Zion effect struggled to translate into consistent retail success. While Jayson Tatum and Luka Doncic have seen their signature lines flourish, Zion’s sneakers, despite cool collaborations like thepack, never quite captured the mainstream imagination the way Jordan Brand expected.On the court, Zion Williamson’s 2025-26 story tells a different story in itself. Currently, Zion is putting up a solid 22.0 points, 6.0 rebounds, and 3.4 assists per game while shooting nearly 58% from the field. When he is healthy, he remains an absolute bulldozer in the paint, recently coming off a dominant 24-point, 10-rebound performance with 10-18 from the field against Spurs and helped Pelicans to win by 104-95.However, the injuries continue to haunt him. Zion has already missed 16 games this season due to a mix of hamstring issues and recent illness. While his scoring remains elite, the Pelicans have struggled with consistency, sitting at the bottom of the Western Conference standings with a 12-36 record.","The zion 4, which hit shelves in early 2025, will serve as the final chapter of a partnership that once felt like a guaranteed dynasty.

Cooper Kupp finds strength in family as Seahawks journey turns personal



Cooper Kupp stood at the center of one of the most emotional Sundays of the NFL season, carrying history, heartbreak, and hope into a championship stage. Once celebrated as the face of a Super Bowl comeback in Los Angeles, the veteran wide receiver now wears different colors with the same quiet fire. The moment felt heavy and personal, shaped not just by football, but by family, loyalty, and a career that refuses to slow down.At 32, Kupp understands how quickly the league moves on. The Rams chose not to meet his expectations in free agency, closing a chapter that included a Super Bowl MVP and countless clutch catches. Seattle did not hesitate. A three year, $45 million deal with $17.5 million guaranteed gave him a fresh start, and it placed him face to face with the past sooner than anyone expected.The NFC Championship Game against Los Angeles Rams was more than a playoff clash. It was a collision of memories. Cooper Kupp embraced former teammates Matthew Stafford and Puka Nacua before kickoff, sharing smiles that hinted at mutual respect and unfinished emotions. Then he turned toward the stands, where his true support system waited.Anna Marie Kupp and their three sons made their presence impossible to miss.Cooper Jameson, born in 2018, Cypress Stellar, born in 2021, and Solas Reign, born in 2023, proudly wore Seahawks gear and Kupp jerseys. Anna added a custom “10” coat, blending style with meaning. The image spoke louder than words. This was a family fully committed to the next chapter.Their bond has deep roots. Cooper and Anna met as teenagers at a high school track meet in Washington, when she handed him a medal after a race. He has often described that moment as love at first sight. They married in 2015, long before the bright lights of Super Bowls and free agency drama.In a June 2022 conversation with PEOPLE, Kupp described his wife as the ""absolute warrior"" of their family. That strength has carried them through relocations, injuries, and now a rivalry that feels personal. Anna once shared a heartfelt note about moving back to the Pacific Northwest, a return that felt both emotional and empowering.For Cooper Kupp, revenge is not loud. It lives in preparation, precision, and purpose. Surrounded by family and fueled by unfinished business, he stepped onto the field not just to beat his former team, but to honor the journey that brought him there.","Cooper kupp and wife anna marie met as teenagers at a high school track meet in washington.

Los Angeles Lakers vs Chicago Bulls Game Outlook

The Los Angeles Lakers visit Chicago on January 26 to face the Bulls in a game shaped by injuries, travel problems, and recent form. A winter storm has complicated travel, and both teams arrive short-handed. The Lakers are 27–17 and coming off a 116–110 win over Dallas. The Bulls are 23–22 and have won four straight.Los Angeles is trying to build consistency after an uneven stretch. Chicago is doing the opposite, using strong home performances to stay competitive in the East. With key players missing on both sides, this matchup is likely to come down to who handles limited rotations better.Injuries will play a major role in how this game unfolds.Austin Reaves is out with a calf strain, leaving a gap in the Lakers’ guard rotation. Adou Thiero is also out with a right MCL sprain, further reducing frontcourt depth. Jake LaRavia is questionable due to a left quad contusion and illness after scoring 13 points in his last game. If LaRavia does not play, the Lakers will lean even more on Luka Doncic to run the offense and log heavy minutes.Chicago Bulls will be without Tre Jones, who is sidelined with a left hamstring strain.Zach Collins is also out with a right first toe sprain, weakening the Bulls’ interior depth. Noa Essengue remains a long-term absence as he continues recovery from shoulder surgery. Yuki Kawhi and Emanuel Miller are unavailable due to G-League rules.With those players out, Chicago will lean on Nikola Vučević, who is putting up 18.3 points and nine rebounds per game, and Matas Buzelis, who is averaging 16.5 points and giving the team reliable shooting from the outside.This is the first meeting between the teams this season. The Los Angeles Lakers have had a slight edge in recent years, but games in Chicago have often been close. Vucevic has been effective against Los Angeles in past matchups, while Doncic’s passing and shot creation could test a thin Bulls backcourt.Chicago will look to play through Vucevic inside and create clean looks for Buzelis on the perimeter. Los Angeles will depend on Doncic to control the game and manage late possessions. With both teams missing rotation players and scoring well recently, the game projects to be close and relatively high scoring, with execution and depth likely deciding the result.","The los angeles lakers visit chicago on january 26 to face the bulls.

What to Watch Charlotte Hornets vs Philadelphia 76ers (January 26, 2026)

’s availability remains the main question as theget set to face the Philadelphia 76ers on January 26. He has been dealing with a right thumb contusion, but there is no official indication that he will sit out. As of the latest injury updates, Ball has not been ruled out, and the expectation around the team is that he is pushing to play.Charlotte’s lineup has often looked different with and without Ball on the floor, which makes his status important for this matchup. Philadelphia is also navigating injuries of its own, adding another layer of uncertainty to how the game could unfold.LaMelo Ball is not listed as out on the Hornets’ most recent injury report. The thumb issue surfaced recently, but Ball has already played through it. He was previously listed as questionable for an earlier game and still took the floor, suggesting the injury is being managed rather than worsening.There have been no reports of setbacks specific to January 26, and Ball is also not included alongside other injured Hornets, such as KJ Simpson. That absence from the report points toward availability, though a final call is expected closer to tip-off.The Charlotte Hornets will host the Philadelphia 76ers in an Eastern Conference matchup that could shift based on who is available. Philadelphia will be without Joel Embiid, who is sitting out due to ankle injury management on the second night of a back-to-back.Charlotte also has uncertainty elsewhere. Collin Sexton is a game-time decision because of a hamstring issue, which could further increase Ball’s role if he plays.Ball first dealt with the thumb contusion after coming off the bench against Cleveland. Despite the issue, he logged minutes and remained productive. He later played through a questionable designation and scored efficiently, showing no major limitations.Since then, there have been no new concerns tied to the thumb. His continued presence in games suggests the Hornets’ staff is comfortable with his condition.This season, LaMelo Ball is averaging 19.3 points, 4.2 rebounds, and 7 assists. Those numbers reflect his role as the primary ball handler and creator for Charlotte. Against Philadelphia, he has been consistent, averaging 19.1 points and 7.1 assists across eight career games. That stretch includes a 38-point performance in November 2024.Support from Brandon Miller and Miles Bridges gives Charlotte additional scoring options if Ball is available.If Ball plays, Charlotte gains stability and playmaking, especially with Philadelphia missing key pieces. His shooting has held up despite the thumb issue, including a recent strong performance from three-point range.Also read: Is Joel Embiid playing tonight vs the Charlotte Hornets?

NHL reviewing incident after William Nylander apologizes for on-camera gesture



Toronto Maple Leafs forward William Nylander found himself at the center of unwanted attention Sunday, not for his on-ice production, but for a brief off-ice moment that quickly went viral. During Toronto’s 4-1 home loss to the Colorado Avalanche, a camera shot caught Nylander making an obscene gesture while watching from the stands.The incident came at a difficult time for both player and team. Already sidelined with injury and amid a rough stretch for the Maple Leafs, Nylander’s actions sparked scrutiny across the hockey world and prompted a public apology soon after the final horn.Nylander addressed the situation directly on Instagram, calling the incident a “moment of frustration” and emphasizing that no offense was intended toward Leafs Nation. “Only love for Leafs Nation. Sorry about my moment of frustration today! Didn’t mean to upset anyone. Looking forward to being back on the ice and not in the stands. Love Willy,” the Maple Leafs forward wrote following Sunday’s 4-1 loss.The apology was swift and measured, aimed at cooling a situation that escalated quickly once the clip aired. Still, the matter may not end there, as TSN Hockey Insider Chris Johnston reported that the NHL is reviewing the incident, leaving open the possibility of league discipline.The gesture occurred early in the third period with Toronto trailing 3-0. Nylander, who has been out with a groin injury, was seated in a suite alongside teammates Chris Tanev, Dakota Joshua, Calle Jarnkrok, and Philippe Myers. As the camera briefly focused on the group, Nylander flashed the middle finger before the feed returned to the ice. The moment was short, but its impact lingered.Context matters here, including Sunday’s game. Nylander has missed five straight contests due to injury, forced to watch as Toronto dropped its fourth consecutive home game and sixth loss in seven outings. Frustration has been evident around the club, and this was another reminder of how quickly emotions can spill over during a difficult stretch.From a hockey standpoint, Nylander’s absence is significant. He has been one of Toronto’s most consistent offensive contributors this season, posting 17 goals and 31 assists for 48 points in 37 games while averaging 18:33 of ice time. His production has been difficult to replace, particularly as the Leafs struggle to find rhythm at even strength.Toronto now sits at 24-19-9 and faces mounting pressure heading into a busy stretch. The Maple Leafs return to action Tuesday against the Buffalo Sabres before embarking on a six-game road trip that could shape their season. Whether Nylander faces additional consequences remains to be seen, but his focus, and the team’s, will be on getting healthy, stabilizing their play, and keeping distractions to a minimum.","Nhl reviewing incident after william nylander apologizes for on-camera gesture.

Here is the list of 5 of the most iconic Micheal Jordan NBA All-Star cards:

Hoops All-Star #21(1989):

Fleer Michael Jordan All-Star #6 (1992):

SP All-Stars #AS2 Gold and Silver (1995):

The NBA All-Star season is a widely celebrated event across the big league. As the 2026 NBA All-Star season is just around the corner, it is impossible not to think about the player who turned this into a global event: Michael Jordan. Across 14 All-Star Game appearances, Jordan wasn’t just a participant, he was the main attraction. His impact is irreplaceable for fans to the point that All-Star themed Michael Jordan cards have become a must-have for NBA fans.Starting from his rise as a basketball superstar to his final appearances as a legend nearing the end of an era, these cards capture the different chapters of Jordan’s All-Star journey. Below is a look at five Michael Jordan NBA All-Star cards that continue to define his impact on the game.Michael Jordan’s 1989 Hoops All-Star card may not be the first card made to celebrate one of his All-Star games, but it is still one of the nicest to look at, because of how attractive the card is. It captures Jordan dribbling a ball on the court, in a bright red Eastern Conference All-Star jersey, reminding the fans of how confident he looked while playing.In 1992, Fleer made its cards look better by adding a shiny finish to them and offering collectors more special cards to chase.One special set was the blue-colored All-Star cards that were printed sideways and did not come in every pack, only a few showed up in a full box of 36 boxes. Fans loved these cards back then, and many still want them today. Because many were not printed evenly, cards that are nicely centered are harder to find and are more valuable.Michael Jordan announced his first retirement in 1993, he made a sudden comeback in 1995, and he also returned to the All-Star stage that same year. It was one of the most talked-about moments of the decade. Jordan lived up to the hype by putting up 20 points and taking home the game’s MVP award. That year’s SP All-Star cards came in two main versions. The standard silver design was fairly common, showing up in about one out of every five packs, while a much rarer gold version appeared far less roughly one per two boxes. For sneaker fans, this card holds extra appeal because Jordan is shown wearing the iconic Air Jordan 11 “Columbia”.This card is widely seen as one of the most important basketball cards ever made because it introduced ideas that had never been done before. It was among the first cards to include a piece of a jersey actually worn in a game, and it was the very first card to have a real autograph. Only 23 copies were produced, making it extremely rare. Each card includes a patch from a jersey Jordan wore in an All-Star Game, along with a signature he himself signed directly on the card, making it extremely special for fans.Celebrating Jordan's final All-Star game in 2003, the Upper Deck SE All-Star Die Cut card. It takes inspiration from the 1993 SE Die Cut set. Blending classic with a modern look, and it stands out as one of his most underrated cards that many fans believe doesn't get the recognition it deserves.",The nba all-star season is a widely celebrated event across the big league. Michael jordan made 14 all-stars appearances and his impact on the game is irreplaceable for fans.

Sam Darnold’s 346-yard, 3-touchdown night ends Seattle’s wait and sets up Super Bowl LX showdown

Katie Hoofnagle’s sideline moment, custom ‘14’ fit, and the relationship Seattle keeps seeing after wins

Sam Darnold delivered the biggest game of his career when it mattered most. The Seattle Seahawks quarterback threw for 346 yards and three touchdowns Sunday night, leading a 31-27 win over the Los Angeles Rams in the NFC Championship Game and sending Seattle to Super Bowl LX.While the box score told one story, the reaction from the stands told another. Darnold’s fiancée, Katie Hoofnagle, was in attendance and shared her response on Instagram shortly after the win. It was brief. It was loud. It matched the moment.Darnold completed 25 of 36 passes for 346 yards, three touchdowns, and zero interceptions against the Rams. The performance capped a postseason run that flipped his career narrative again, this time on the sport’s biggest stage short of the Super Bowl.Seattle signed Darnold ahead of the 2025 season, a move that carried skepticism at the time. He answered it across the year, finishing the regular season with 4,048 passing yards. Sunday’s win marked his second playoff victory this postseason and secured the Seahawks’ first Super Bowl berth with him under center.After the game, Hoofnagle posted a short video from the stadium and added a two-word caption aimed directly at her fiancé.“LFG 14.”Former Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson also weighed in, posting on X after the win. “Sam Darnold’s comeback story over the past 2 years has been one of the most inspirational things to watch! Cool seeing him overcome!!! Congrats bro. Hope you win it! 🏆 Go Hawks,” Wilson wrote.Seattle will face the New England Patriots in Super Bowl LX on Feb. 8. The game will be played in Santa Clara, Calif.Hoofnagle didn’t keep a low profile Sunday night. She attended the NFC Championship Game in a custom black hoodie and faded blue denim pants, with Darnold’s jersey number “14” printed on the leg. She paired the look with white heels and a white purse, later sharing a mirror selfie on Instagram without a caption.She also posted a video from the field after the game showing Darnold walking over to her on the sideline. The two shared a hug and a kiss in front of the home crowd at Lumen Field. Hoofnagle added three white heart emojis to the clip.The moment fit a season-long trend. Hoofnagle has been a visible presence at Seahawks games throughout the year, often posting outfits tied to wins, including divisional-round celebrations earlier in the postseason.Darnold proposed to Hoofnagle during the 2025 offseason in Dana Point, Calif. She later shared the engagement publicly after saying yes on the beach. The two met while Darnold was with the San Francisco 49ers in 2023. Hoofnagle played college soccer at South Carolina, starting 67 games over four seasons.Now, she will return to the Bay Area, where she’s from, for the Super Bowl. Darnold will go with her, one win away from a championship that few predicted when the season began.Seattle waited. Darnold delivered.

Avalanche's Gabriel Landeskog Assisted Off The Ice After Hard Collision Into Post

Colorado Avalanche forward Gabriel Landeskog has been sidelined since early January due to an upper-body injury, impacting the team’s lineup. The 33-year-old star was injured during a game against the Florida Panthers on Jan. 4, and his recovery timeline has been closely monitored by the Avalanche medical and coaching staff.With the Winter Olympics coming up, Landeskog is working to get fully healthy so he can play for Team Sweden and perform well on the international stage.Colorado Avalanche forward Gabriel Landeskog is making steady progress in his recovery from an upper-body injury, with hopes of representing Team Sweden at the upcoming Winter Olympics. The 33-year-old star, sidelined since Jan. 4 after sustaining the injury against the Florida Panthers, is gradually returning to on-ice activity under careful supervision. Avalanche coach Jared Bednar provided the latest update following their 4-1 victory over the Toronto Maple Leafs.Bednar confirmed that Landeskog is increasing his workload in the gym and on the ice, though he remains limited due to soreness.“He’s getting better. Time will tell, but the goal would be for him to be able to go play for the Olympics, and he’s still targeting that,” Bednar said. Landeskog’s determination is clear, as he continues to push through recovery while keeping international play in focus.Landeskog had contributed 22 points (seven goals, 15 assists) in 41 games before his injury. His absence has created a gap in the Avalanche lineup, but the team remains cautiously optimistic about his return. Bednar emphasized that while there is always risk when players are not fully healthy, Landeskog is expected to make careful decisions regarding his readiness. His participation would strengthen Sweden’s roster and provide a boost to the Avalanche upon his return.Meanwhile, defenseman Devon Toews continues his rehabilitation from an upper-body injury and missed his 10th consecutive game Sunday. Toews, part of Team Canada’s roster, has recorded 13 points (one goal, 12 assists) and a plus-26 rating in 40 games this season. The Avalanche is managing both players’ recovery timelines to ensure they can contribute at peak performance without risking further setbacks.Landeskog’s potential participation in the Winter Olympics remains a key development, reflecting his commitment to representing Sweden while preparing to return to the NHL in top form.","Colorado avalanche forward gabriel landeskog is making steady progress in his recovery from an upper-body injury.

Gus Kenworthy talks about being linked to Miley Cyrus before coming out

Gus Kenworthy opened up about his past in a new interview and spoke in a very honest way about what life felt like before he came out as gay. The Olympic freestyle skier said a recent TV show made him think about the years when he was hiding a big part of himself. He also talked about the time he was linked to pop star Miley Cyrus after the 2014 Winter Olympics.The 34-year-old shared his thoughts in an interview with The New Yorker, published on Sunday, January 25. He explained how watching the show helped him understand his own feelings from the past. Kenworthy said some moments on screen felt very close to his real life.Gus Kenworthy became a global name after the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, where he won a silver medal for the United States. A year later, in 2015, he publicly came out as gay.But before that, he says he often felt trapped between who people thought he was and who he really was. In the interview, Kenworthy spoke about a time right after the Sochi Games.On February 13, 2014, he and his teammates swept the podium. The next day was Valentine’s Day, and reporters asked him about his “dream date” and “celebrity crush.” Kenworthy said he panicked. He did not feel ready to speak his truth.“I kind of froze and said Miley Cyrus,” he shared. Soon, that answer spread online. Miley Cyrus even replied and followed him on social media.Kenworthy said the attention felt unreal, but also heavy. “I felt like I was digging a deeper hole,” he explained, because he was still hiding a big part of his life.He said there was friendly messaging between them, and he truly admired her. But inside, he knew it was not the life he wanted. “I didn’t want to keep waking up and pretending,” he said. That feeling stayed with him until he finally chose to speak openly in 2015.Gus Kenworthy also spoke about a show called Heated Rivalry, which follows the hidden life of a famous hockey player. He said he watched it recently and did not expect it to affect him. At first, he thought it was just another sports drama.But the third episode changed his view. It focused on a closeted athlete dealing with fame and secret relationships. “I saw myself in him,” Kenworthy said. “I don’t think I’ve ever felt that kind of reflection before.”He explained that the character’s wish to be open, but fear of losing everything, was exactly how he felt for many years.Gus Kenworthy said he even wrote to the show’s creator because the story moved him so much. Today, Gus Kenworthy is open about who he is and continues his sports career.He is set to represent Great Britain at the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milan, Italy, after previously competing for the United States in 2014 and 2018.","Olympic skier gus kenworthy opens up about being linked to miley cyrus and his hidden life.

Luka Doncic's scoring milestone rewrites Lakers history



Luka Doncic and Lakers fans react to historic pace



Fresh out of being named Player of the Week, Luka Doncic has added another insane feat to his resume. He scored 2,000 points in 65 games to become the quickest Lakers to hit the milestone. Doncic keeps finding new ways to bend expectations in Los Angeles.Los Angeles entered the matchup against Chicago riding momentum, having won three of its previous four games. Consistency has been a work in progress, but recent performances have shown growth on both ends of the floor. The Doncic-led Lakers secured the stunning 129-118 victory over the Bulls as he logged 38 minutes to score 46 points, 7 rebounds, and 11 assists.The numbers behind Luka Doncic’s scoring milestone underline how dominant his recent stretch has been. Over the past week, he delivered elite performances against top competition. He poured in 38 points with 13 rebounds and 10 assists against Denver. Two nights later, he followed with 32 points, 11 rebounds, and eight assists versus the Clippers. The run continued against Dallas, where he posted 33 points, 11 assists, and eight rebounds in a hard-fought win.Now, his 2000 points in 65 games proved that he is here to make a statement.That level of production secured another Player of the Week award, the second of the season and the 16th of his career. For the year, Doncic is averaging 33.4 points, 7.8 rebounds, and 8.7 assists per game. He leads the league in scoring average and free throws made while ranking near the top in assists and steals. Reaching 2,000 points in 65 games placed him ahead of LeBron James’ pace from his first Lakers season, a comparison that adds weight inside a franchise built on scoring legends.The reaction to Luka Doncic’s scoring milestone was immediate and loud across social media. One fan captured the disbelief perfectly, writing, ""That's absolutely wild! Luka hitting 2,000 points as a Laker in just 65 games is straight-up insane pace🤯 —faster than even LeBron's 67-game mark when he first joined in 2018.🏀""Another fan focused on what it means for the league, saying, ""To reach 2,000 points in 65 games is legitimately terrifying for the rest of the league."" Praise continued to pour in as long-term potential entered the conversation. ""Luka has GOAT potential,"" one supporter commented, while another added, ""Damn even faster than Lebron.""Others highlighted how natural he looks in Los Angeles colors. "" Luka Dončić hits 2000 points as a Laker already—insane pace! The Slovenian superstar is cooking in purple & gold,"" one fan wrote. Another kept it simple, posting, ""Luka Doncic just built different 💥."" One even looked deep into Lakers history, adding, ""He might end up being the 2nd best Lakers scorer, right behind Kobe.""Doncic's dominance is on the rise, and he has been unstoppable after the blockbuster trade that proved to be a jackpot for the Lakers.","Luka doncic scored 2,000 points in 65 games to become the quickest lakers to hit the milestone.

Fernando Tatis Jr.’s offseason routine reflects a balance of training, exploration and recovery

San Diego Padres outfielder Fernando Tatis Jr. is widely regarded as one of the most complete players in Major League Baseball. Known for his blend of power, speed and defensive range, the 27 year old continues to earn respect from peers across the league. New York Mets star Juan Soto has previously described Tatis as the best all around player in the game.While baseball remains his clear priority, the offseason gives Tatis space to reset and refocus. A recent Instagram post offered insight into how he uses this time, combining physical challenges, personal interests and structured training while spending time in the Dominican Republic.The carousel started with Tatis at the peak of Pico Duarte the tallest mountain in the Dominican Republic and the Caribbean. The picture had a certain cultural and personal significance, a wooden cross, the Dominican flag and a bust of Juan Pablo Duarte can be seen in the background. Instead of a simple traveling picture, the instant was a measure of perseverance, concentration and attachment to home.There was another slide with sweeping views of Valle de Bao, a popular hiking spot in Cordillera Central mountain range. The post was then moved underwater, which emphasized interest of Tatis in free diving.His training has included breath control and underwater conditioning with Deep End Fitness, which has known to have a high level of physical and mental requirements.The later pictures shifted the attention to preparation. Tatis was filmed floating on water with a serene background, and a gym mirror selfie that focused on his conditioning. Brief scenes of batting practice and some hiking scenes were added to the carousel, and there were also relaxed moments in the sun and personal creative touches.Taken together, the post showed how Tatis approaches the offseason with intention. The combination of exploration, recovery and regular training also helps him to create a platform that sustains his performance by the time the season comes back. It reflects a mindset focused on longevity, mental clarity, and maintaining peak readiness for the long demands of a full MLB season.","San diego padres outfielder fernando tatis jr. is spending the offseason in the dominican republic.

Scotland on Monday announced their 15-member squad for the upcoming ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2026, marking a swift transition from late entrants to fully prepared contenders for the global event starting February 7 in India and Sri Lanka.The European side were drafted into the tournament after the International Cricket Council (ICC) replaced Bangladesh, following the Bangladesh Cricket Board’s (BCB) refusal to send its team to India citing security concerns. Scotland, the highest-ranked team outside the original qualification list, were subsequently confirmed as Bangladesh’s replacement.Led by captain Richie Berrington, Scotland will be featuring in their seventh Men’s T20 World Cup, having previously appeared in six of the nine editions of the tournament (2007, 2009, 2016, 2021, 2022 and 2024). Alongside the main squad, Cricket Scotland also named two travelling reserves and three non-travelling reserves.Cricket Scotland’s Head of Performance Steve Snell expressed confidence in the balance and depth of the selected squad, particularly with the challenges of sub-continent conditions in mind.“The coaching staff, selectors, and I are all really excited about the squad that has been picked. We feel it's well-balanced and caters for a lot of different scenarios and challenges that the team will face in India,” Snell said, as quoted by the ICC.Snell also highlighted young fast bowler Zainullah Ihsan as one to watch. “There's obviously a great opportunity for Zainullah Ihsan, and whenever he's played at youth level or for the ‘A’ squad, he's shown an exciting range of skills and bowled at genuine pace,” he said, while also praising Oli Davidson for his work ethic and deserved call-up.Placed in Group C, Scotland will face England, Italy, Nepal and the West Indies, with their tournament opener scheduled against the West Indies at Eden Gardens on February 7.","Scotland named 15-member squad for icc men’s t20 world cup 2026.
