Sakhira was chief organiser of a Sikh gathering held under the banner of Sarbat Khalsa that appointed jailed Jagtar Singh Hawara, the assassin of former Punjab CM Beant Singh, as a parallel jathedar of Akal Takht. Giani Gargaj halted and another Sikh priest stepped forward to bestow the siropa upon Gurmeet Kaur. ""We don't consider Giani Gargaj as quom's (Sikh community's) jathedar, so we can't allow him to bestow siropa upon the wife of Mehal Singh Babbar,"" said Sakhira.Babbar, who had been in hiding in Pakistan since 2003, died at the Combined Military Hospital in Lahore due to kidney failure. Babbar was a key figure in BKI, a group banned under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967. He was also wanted in connection with multiple militant incidents across Amritsar, Jalandhar, and Faridkot districts.","Gurmeet kaur is the wife of babbar khalsa international (bki) deputy chief mehal singh babbar.

Bon Iver’s Justin Vernon calls Taylor Swift’s ‘Exile’ performance an ‘out of body’ moment during Eras Tour reflection,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/bon-ivers-justin-vernon-calls-taylor-swifts-exile-performance-an-out-of-body-moment-during-eras-tour-reflection/articleshow/119982963.cms,"Image via Getty Images

Justin Vernon was moved by fans singing “Exile” without him onstage

Bon Iver Talks Collabs with Taylor Swift and Charli xcx and New Album SABLE, fABLE (Extended)

Singer-songwriter Justin Vernon , frontman of Bon Iver and long-time collaborator with Taylor Swift , recently reflected on a surreal moment tied to Swift’s record-breaking Eras Tour . Appearing on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon on April 2, Vernon promoted his upcoming album SABLE, fABLE and opened up about the powerful experience of hearing thousands of fans belt out their duet “exile” at Swift’s live shows—even though he’s never performed it with her on that stage.When Jimmy Fallon brought up Taylor Swift’s live performances of “exile”—their hauntingly emotional track from her 2020 folklore album—Vernon was visibly moved. Describing the moment as “out of body, out of body,” he revealed how surreal it felt watching stadiums full of fans passionately sing the song he helped bring to life.“Sadly we didn’t ever get a chance to sing it with her on her tour,” Vernon said. “She got to come sing it with us but I saw those clips and I’m like, ‘Gosh, they sound better than one of me can sound.’”His admiration for Swift's audience didn’t stop there. Vernon called the entire experience “pretty powerful,” saying, “To just see that and to hear how that sounded. It was amazing.”Vernon’s relationship with Swift goes beyond one song. He also collaborated on the title track “evermore” from her 2020 sister album and has spoken warmly about their creative bond. In a past interview with The New Yorker, he described their first meeting as a surprisingly natural connection.“I was, like, ‘Wow, you’re somebody that I would have been very close friends with in high school,’” he shared. “‘You’re real and you’re here.’”Vernon continued, expressing his awe for Swift’s meteoric rise: “To see what she’s been up to, the propulsion, the expansion… I don’t know, it’s just unlike anything anyone’s ever seen. And yet there she was, this person who made a lot of sense to me.”Also Read: Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce’s low-profile approach after Super Bowl and Grammys seen as strategic move by PR experts As Vernon revisits those emotional musical moments, he’s also looking forward to the release of SABLE, fABLE, Bon Iver’s fifth studio album, set to drop on April 11. With past collaborations and genuine connections like his with Swift, Vernon continues to bridge indie introspection with mainstream impact—proving that powerful music often starts from a place of deep authenticity.","Justin vernon was moved by fans singing ""exile"" without him onstage.

making history

Trey McBride was raised by two moms who shaped his strength and spirit

Trey McBride’s new deal just made NFL history

Trey McBride ’s story is so much more than football—it’s about family, breaking barriers, and redefining what strength looks like in the NFL. Raised by two moms in a small Colorado town, McBride became the first known NFL player with same-sex parents. And now? He’s not just making headlines—he’sas the highest-paid tight end in NFL history . From trailblazer to record-breaker, Trey is proving that love, resilience, and hustle can take you all the way to the top.Long before the big paychecks and Pro Bowl nods, Trey McBride was a kid growing up in Fort Morgan, Colorado. Raised by his two moms, Kate and Jen, alongside his four siblings, Trey’s life wasn’t about fame—it was about love, discipline, and pushing through.He’s never shied away from celebrating his family. In fact, he credits his moms for teaching him everything about hard work and perseverance. Their support wasn’t just emotional—it was foundational. In interviews, Trey has said their presence helped him handle pressure and stay focused, no matter what challenges came his way.Trey didn’t wait until the pros to turn heads. At Colorado State , he quickly became a standout. His senior year was something out of a highlight reel—90 receptions, 1,121 receiving yards, and the John Mackey Award for best tight end in college football.Scouts couldn’t ignore his combination of size, hands, and grit. The Arizona Cardinals picked him in the second round of the 2022 NFL Draft, making him the first-ever player raised by same-sex parents to enter the league. It was a history-making moment—but Trey was just getting started.After a quiet rookie season, Trey exploded in 2024. He became one of the most reliable tight ends in the league, hauling in 111 receptions for 1,146 yards and adding three touchdowns to his name. That performance earned him his first Pro Bowl selection and solidified his connection with Cardinals QB Kyler Murray , who praised McBride’s work ethic and leadership.Fans and analysts alike started seeing him not just as a rising star—but as a top-tier tight end with a long, bright future.On April 3, 2025, Trey inked a 4-year, $76 million extension with the Cardinals, with $43 million guaranteed. That makes him the highest-paid tight end in NFL history, surpassing Chiefs legend Travis Kelce.It wasn’t just a business move—it was a statement. Trey’s journey from a small-town kid raised by two loving moms to the top of the league shows just how far passion and perseverance can go. Kyler Murray called the extension a “no-brainer,” and the Cardinals locked in their star for years to come.Also read - Saquon Barkley surprises Donald Trump’s daughter Ivanka and grandson with a signed football at J.P.

Aaron Rodgers' NFL future hangs in the balance – And the Steelers may be left waiting



Wild Steelers Trade, Aaron Rodgers Decision | AST Call-In Show

As the NFL offseason rolls forward and the 2025 Draft looms closer, one name continues to dominate headlines—Aaron Rodgers. Despite his decorated career and four MVP awards, Rodgers remains unsigned, and all eyes are on what has become one of the league’s most compelling storylines. Among the teams reportedly most invested in his future are the Pittsburgh Steelers, who appear all-in on the 41-year-old quarterback. But with every day that passes, hope in Pittsburgh may be giving way to uncertainty.The Steelers, who lost both Russell Wilson and Justin Fields in free agency, have cleared the deck in their quarterback room—placing their faith firmly in Aaron Rodgers. Currently, only Mason Rudolph and Skylar Thompson remain on the roster, neither seen as a long-term solution. With the Steelers clearly banking on Rodgers to stabilize their offense, any hesitation from his camp could be detrimental.Owner and president Art Rooney II recently admitted, “We keep getting positive sort of signals about it. So yeah, I’d say we feel pretty good about it at this point.” Still, even he hinted that patience won’t be endless, stating Rodgers has “not forever, but a little while longer” to decide.But behind the scenes, conflicting opinions are surfacing. According to Pro Football Talk's Mike Florio, one “high-level” NFL executive offered a different take on Rodgers’ true intentions: “The opinion is he doesn’t really want to play for the Steelers, and he’s waiting for Minnesota.” Florio clarified, “It’s not a fact; it’s not a report. But it’s somebody who is in the ecosystem and isn’t a low-level employee.”This speculation adds a new twist. While the Minnesota Vikings had previously expressed interest, they appear to have committed to second-year quarterback J.J. McCarthy. Yet, the possibility remains that Rodgers is hoping for a last-minute opening in Minnesota’s quarterback room—leaving Pittsburgh as more of a fallback than a preferred destination.Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin , known for his calm demeanor, is reportedly giving Rodgers space and not imposing any hard deadlines. When asked about whether a deadline had been set, Tomlin responded, “Not to my knowledge. I don’t know that we’ve approached it from a deadline perspective.” Still, the absence of urgency doesn’t eliminate the pressure mounting within the organization.Interestingly, Rodgers had already visited the Steelers’ facility back in March and even held a throwing session with newly acquired wide receiver DK Metcalf. That interaction was viewed by many as a promising sign, one that suggested Rodgers was seriously weighing the move. But weeks later, no decision has been made—and silence often speaks volumes in the NFL.At 41, Rodgers holds all the cards. He can afford to wait, watch, and choose his next destination carefully—or even walk away from the game altogether. While retirement hasn’t been publicly discussed as a likely option, it still lingers in the realm of possibilities.Also Read: Could the Giants really draft both Travis Hunter and Shedeur Sanders in 2025? Mel Kiper Jr. believes so For Pittsburgh, the stakes are high.

A-list celebration brings football icons and soccer royalty together in Miami

Tom Brady’s cheeky jab at Beckham sparks playful international debate

When legends collide, sparks fly—and that’s exactly what happened at David Beckham ’s extravagant pre-50th birthday party in Miami. Held ahead of the soccer icon’s milestone on May 2, the lavish event became an unexpected headline-grabber, thanks to none other than NFL legend Tom Brady and his cheeky sense of humor.The intimate yet star-studded gathering was thrown by Victoria Beckham and hosted in Miami, home to Beckham’s MLS club Inter Miami CF. The guest list included some of the most recognizable names in sports, such as Lionel Messi, Luis Suárez, Jordi Alba, Sergio Busquets, and basketball icon Shaquille O’Neal. But it was Brady who stole the spotlight with his playful Instagram posts that reignited the never-ending “football vs. soccer” debate.Clad in a sharp tuxedo and all smiles next to the birthday boy, Brady posted, ""Happy 50th @davidbeckham. I'm glad we finally agreed it's called soccer not football,"" poking fun at the age-old transatlantic argument.The comment, lighthearted as it was, stirred the pot among fans from both sports worlds. Many soccer purists bristled at Brady’s “soccer” reference, while NFL followers applauded the GOAT for sticking to the American terminology.Later, Brady doubled down on the humor by sharing another Instagram Story with Beckham and Shaquille O’Neal, captioned, ""The backup goalies for @intermiamicf (Okay the backups to the backup).""While the party was buzzing with celebrities, sources say the vibe was surprisingly relaxed. According to Hollywood insider Rob Shuter, the event took place at a private, off-the-grid venue with minimal security and glam. Instead of flashing lights and red carpets, the focus was on authentic camaraderie, laughter, and celebrating Beckham’s legacy with close friends.Beckham’s early birthday bash wasn't just a glamorous affair—it became a moment where different sports cultures collided, and fans were reminded that even legends love to stir the pot, especially when there’s cake and champagne involved.Also Read: Aaron Rodgers future: The QB delays Steelers decision as Brett Favre's advice fuels hopes for a last-minute Vikings offer In true Brady fashion, the night wasn’t just about celebration—it was about making headlines.

NEW DELHI: Lucknow Super Giants edged past Mumbai Indians by 12 runs in a thrilling IPL 2025 clash at the Ekana Stadium on Friday, registering their second win of the season. The victory lifted LSG to sixth place on the points table, while MI slipped to seventh after their third loss in four matches.Despite a career-best 5/36 from MI skipper Hardik Pandya and a valiant 67 off 43 balls by Suryakumar Yadav, MI fell short in their chase of 204, finishing at 191/5.LSG rode on a blazing start from Mitchell Marsh (60 off 31) and Aiden Markram (53 off 38) to post 203/8. Pandya’s late strikes, including wickets of Markram, Pant, and Miller, restricted further damage.MI’s reply started poorly as openers Will Jacks and Ryan Rickelton departed early. Suryakumar and Naman Dhir (46 off 24) revived the chase with a 69-run partnership. However, Dhir’s dismissal by Digvesh Rathi – who repeated his now-controversial “letter-writing” celebration – shifted momentum.Suryakumar kept MI in the hunt but fell in the 17th over to Avesh Khan, triggering a slowdown. With 22 needed off the final over, Pandya’s lone six wasn’t enough as MI stumbled in the final moments.Earlier, LSG’s opening duo had powered them to 69/0 in the powerplay, before MI pulled things back with timely breakthroughs, including a strong spell from Pandya. But the target proved just out of reach.203 for 8 in 20 overs (Mitchell Marsh 60, Aiden Markram 53, Ayush Badoni 30, David Miller 27; Hardik Pandya 5/36).191 for 5 in 20 overs (Naman Dhir 46, Suryakumar Yadav 67, Tilak Varma 25, Hardik Pandya 28 not out).","Lucknow super giants beat mumbai indians by 12 runs in ipl 2025 clash.

He wasn’t the flashiest guy on the field—but if you were paying attention, you’d always find #95 doing the dirty work, showing up when it mattered most.Even after the lights dimmed on his NFL career , Wells never lost that trademark grit. When he was diagnosed with cancer two years ago, he didn’t back down. Instead, he fought it with the same tenacity and heart he brought to every play.His wife, Lisa, and their two sons were by his side every step of the way. They witnessed up close just how strong he remained—even when his body grew tired. His passing has left his family heartbroken and the football world reflecting on a life that, though far too short, left a lasting impact.Dean Wells entered the NFL in 1993 as a fourth-round pick by the Seattle Seahawks , and he wasted no time making an impression. Standing 6-foot-3 and weighing 248 pounds, he was a true force on the field. Over six seasons with the Seahawks (1993–1998), Wells became one of the team’s most dependable defenders.In 1999, he joined the Carolina Panthers , where he played three more seasons and continued to anchor the defense until 2001. Across his nine-year NFL career, Wells racked up 529 tackles , 2.5 sacks, three interceptions, six forced fumbles, and four fumble recoveries.But what truly set him apart wasn’t just the stat sheet—it was his football IQ, his steady locker room leadership, and his willingness to always do the tough, thankless jobs that help teams win.Dean Wells wasn’t just a linebacker. He was a fighter, a teammate, a husband, and a father—a man who showed the world how to face adversity with quiet courage and dignity.Though his life was cut short, the mark he left on the game, and on everyone who knew him, is permanent.Rest easy, Dean. You gave the game—and the people around you—everythingAlso read - Taylor Swift’s message to Travis Kelce as he prepares for a ‘make-or-break’ NFL season","Dean wells passed away on april 3, 2025, after a two-year battle with cancer.

NEW DELHI: Despite Lucknow Super Giants ’ (LSG) disappointing eight-wicket defeat to Punjab Kings (PBKS) in the 2025 IPL, franchise owner Sanjiv Goenka has kept his faith in Rishabh Pant ’s leadership abilities.He delivered a stirring message -- one that not only motivated his squad but also highlighted his unwavering faith in skipper's potential.Also See: IPL Live Score, LSG vs MI In a conversation with Star Sports, Goenka made a striking declaration: “The moment we knew he (Rishabh) was not being retained, we planned the team around him. I've said this before, and I have no hesitation in saying it again: I believe he's a great leader. His best leadership is yet to come. So, 27 is the number we got him at. If it had meant 28, that would have been the number.”Goenka emphasised that Pant’s leadership journey is still unfolding, and that LSG is fully invested in his aggressive, instinct-driven style. “We were very clear—we needed a leader who trusts and backs his instincts, who is fearless, who is destructive. And in Rishabh, we get all of that,” he added.Pant, however, endured a tough outing against Punjab, managing just two runs. LSG’s top order faltered, with Mitchell Marsh falling for a golden duck, but a gritty 65-run stand between Nicholas Pooran (44) and Ayush Badoni (41) helped steady the innings.Late cameos from David Miller and Abdul Samad took the team to 171/7, but it proved insufficient.Punjab’s openers were ruthless in reply. Prabhsimran Singh smashed 69 off 34 balls, while Shreyas Iyer (52 not out) and Nehal Wadhera (43 not out) chased down the target with ease, sealing the win in just 16.2 overs.Despite the loss, Goenka addressed the team with encouragement. “This evening, you are entitled to your disappointments.

But it was what followed that raised eyebrows — a fierce send-off by Rathi that echoed his celebration from LSG’s previous match against Punjab Kings, for which he had already been fined 25% of his match fees and handed one demerit point by the IPL Despite the prior punishment, Rathi repeated the gesture with no signs of restraint, unleashing the now ‘infamous’ paper celebration as Dhir walked off. The moment was quickly picked up by fans and is now sparking debate over whether further disciplinary action will follow.The earlier IPL statement had cited a Level 1 breach under Article 2.5 (relating to “using language, actions or gestures which disparage or could provoke an aggressive reaction”), and while Rathi had accepted the sanction, his actions on Friday suggest he isn’t backing down from his trademark aggression.With two send-offs in two games, the league and match referee may have a bigger decision to make, as repeated breaches could lead to sterner consequences.","Lucknow super giants spinner digvesh rathi sent off mumbai indians batter naman dhir.

Gianni Infantino says 2026 FIFA World Cup will feel like watching 104 Super Bowls in just one month



The age-old debate between American football and global football (soccer) has long stirred passionate arguments. While the NFL dominates the sports landscape in the United States with the Super Bowl as its crown jewel, the rest of the world pledges allegiance to the beautiful game—football. And now, FIFA President Gianni Infantino has reignited that conversation by comparing the upcoming 2026 FIFA World Cup to not just one Super Bowl, but “104 Super Bowls in a month.”Gianni Infantino’s comments came during an appearance on The Herd with Colin Cowherd, where he made a bold case for the World Cup's global supremacy. “The impact will be global,” Infantino said. “I mean look at the Super Bowl, which is fantastic. It has what, 120, 130 million viewers, right? The World Cup has 6 billion viewers [over a month of matches], so a World Cup is 104 Super Bowls in a month—which is three Super Bowls a day... This can happen every week if you have the best league in the world.”The numbers speak volumes. Super Bowl LIX averaged 127.7 million viewers—a monumental feat by any standard. Yet, the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar pulled in a staggering 5 billion fans across all platforms, with the final between Argentina and France alone drawing 1.42 billion viewers. The average global live audience for the tournament stood at 175 million—higher than the population of most countries.While the Super Bowl offers a single-night spectacle filled with high-stakes action, star-studded halftime shows, and billion-dollar ad slots, the World Cup delivers 104 games spread across a month. It’s not just a sports event—it’s a global festival. That’s precisely what Infantino is banking on with the expanded 48-team format for the 2026 edition, hosted jointly by the United States, Canada, and Mexico.To warm up American fans for the main event, FIFA is launching the reimagined Club World Cup this summer. Slated from June 14 to July 13, it will feature 32 of the world’s top clubs including Manchester City, Real Madrid, Bayern Munich, and Lionel Messi’s Inter Miami. Infantino labeled the competition as historic, saying, “The first time there will be a club truly crowned world champion by FIFA.”Though some critics argue that Infantino’s “104 Super Bowls” analogy is laced with exaggeration—especially considering not every World Cup match has the drama of a high-stakes final—the underlying message is clear: no other event rivals the global scope, frequency, and cultural impact of the World Cup.Also Read: ""Football Is for All"": Super Bowl champ Khalen Saunders’ LGBTQ-friendly football camp sends a powerful message of acceptance in the NFL So, while the NFL may rule Sundays in America, the 2026 FIFA World Cup is set to remind the world just how massive football really is.

Derrick Henry’s contract extension talks makes many fans uncomfortable about it



Derrick Henry sold his luxurious home to an unknown buyer for a whopping $1.6 million



Derrick Henry, one of the most popular and talented players in the league, has been in the news lately due to his deal with the Baltimore Ravens . The star player signed a two year deal with the team for a whopping $16 million last season and now there are rumours of a contract extension. But fans feel differently about the whole thing.Recently, The Athletic’s Jeff Zrebiec posted an update on X about what the Baltimore Ravens’ coach, John Harbaugh, said about Derrick Henry’s situation. The post read as, “Harbaugh said that he'd like the team to extend RB Derrick Henry who is in last year of deal.”According to a transcript via the team, John Harbaugh recently spoke about Derrick Henry’s contract extension and said, ""It's definitely in the conversation. I know that's been talked about, and yes, I'd love to see that get done as well.""But fans feel uncomfortable with this. A fan commented, “Like how long? He's 31. That's 75 in RB years”, while another fan wrote, “I love Henry, but he's entering his 31 year old season and father time is undefeated. In the history of the NFL, how many 32+ year old great RB's have we seen? How long does Harbaugh want to Extend him?”A third fan wrote, “Id be careful rewarding veteran RB’s with long term deals. The Ravens could regret this decision a year from now”, while another user commented, “Long term deal? Anything more than 2 years is foolish.”However, other fans support this decision of the Baltimore Ravens. A fan commented, “Derrick is like the LeBron of football. Both take great care of their bodies and hold themselves to another standard. I believe he has a good few more years in him”.Another fan wrote, “Frank Gore played until he was 37 and Henry had alot less wear/tear than Gore did at 30”.Neither the Baltimore Ravens nor Derrick Henry has issued a statement about this whole situation. As of now, nothing has been confirmed, but the star player has continued to prove his worth on the field.In the 2024 season of the NFL, Derrick Henry scored 18 touchdowns and ran for 1,921 yards.Recently, Derrick Henry has also been in the news for personal reasons. As per TMZ, the NFL star recently sold his luxurious house in Dallas for a whopping $1.6 million.According to TMZ, apparently, Derrick Henry initially listed the price as $1.8 million but then brought it down to $1.6 million a few months later and sold it to an unidentified buyer.Derrick Henry has not issued a statement about this yet and is currently busy focusing on keeping himself healthy.Also Read: Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce are reportedly making a shocking strategic move amid growing relationship speculations",Derrick henry has been in the news lately due to his deal with the baltimore ravens.
