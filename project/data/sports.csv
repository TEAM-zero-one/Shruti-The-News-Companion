Shedeur Sanders' net worth 2025: How much money does the new Browns quarterback have?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/shedeur-sanders-net-worth-2025-how-much-money-does-the-new-browns-quarterback-have/articleshow/120730178.cms,"Shedeur Sanders, once college football’s top NIL earner, risks stability for an uncertain NFL career after being drafted in the fifth round by the Browns.

What is Shedeur Sanders' net worth?



As the 2025 NFL Draft unfolded, many eyes were glued to the screen for one reason — Shedeur Sanders . The Colorado quarterback, known for his playmaking skills and magnetic persona, was expected to be an early pick. However, the draft night narrative took an unexpected twist. Sanders slid all the way to the 144th pick, where the Cleveland Browns finally took the leap.“Draft time is not real time,” reflected veteran agent Leigh Steinberg. “It’s water-torture time. Every second seems like a minute. Every minute seems like an hour. Drip, drip, drip.”For Sanders, this wasn’t just about waiting — it was about watching his payday shrink. Still, the dynamic quarterback enters the league not in his father's shadow, but blazing a path of his own, already among college football's top earners.Shedeur Sanders, son of NFL legend Deion Sanders, has had one of the most watched journeys in modern football. Once hailed as the face of the NIL revolution, Shedeur’s decision to go pro—despite lucrative college opportunities—underscores both the allure and risks of chasing an NFL dream.Sanders has a net worth of $4 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth . Born on February 7, 2002, and raised under the tutelage of his father, Shedeur developed into a standout quarterback at Trinity Christian School in Texas. A four-star recruit, he initially committed to Florida Atlantic University before pivoting to Jackson State when his father took over as head coach. There, he didn’t just thrive—he dominated. Winning the Jerry Rice Award as the best freshman in FCS football, he quickly became one of college football’s most recognizable stars.His move to the University of Colorado only amplified his visibility. Though the Buffaloes had mixed results, Shedeur’s individual performance—marked by accuracy, decision-making, and mobility—kept NFL scouts intrigued. Off the field, he was a marketing juggernaut. With endorsement deals from Gatorade, Beats by Dre, and Mercedes-Benz, and a social media following that rivaled pro athletes, his NIL earnings reportedly topped $5 million. “He was the highest-paid NIL player in college sports,” noted various reports.But despite the potential to earn even more by staying in college—especially as players like Carson Beck and Darian Mensah continued profiting from NIL—Shedeur entered the 2025 NFL Draft. Deion Sanders confidently declared his son a top-five pick, but doubts around Shedeur’s mechanics and leadership led to a surprising slide. The Cleveland Browns selected him in the fifth round, 144th overall.His rookie deal averages just over $1.16 million annually—with no guaranteed money. And given the NFL’s harsh reality, where nearly half of fifth-rounders don’t make the roster, Shedeur’s professional path is filled with uncertainty.Still, with his pedigree, media appeal, and raw talent, Shedeur Sanders may yet prove that betting on oneself—despite the odds—is the ultimate power move in today’s evolving football economy. NFL world will keep an sharp eye on him.Also Read: Is Shedeur Sanders making a financial sacrifice by entering the NFL instead of staying in college?","Shedeur sanders, son of nfl legend deion sanders, entered the 2025 nfl draft.

John Lynch’s lesson to Shedeur Sanders



Lynch shows empathy for Shedeur Sanders



In the high-stakes world of the NFL Draft, where hype often overshadows talent, one quarterback is proving that where you're picked doesn’t always determine your future. Brock Purdy , selected as the final pick of the 2022 NFL Draft, is shattering expectations. Now, as he leads the San Francisco 49ers to Super Bowl glory and two NFC Championship appearances, the team is looking to extend his contract. His rise to NFL stardom is a powerful lesson for Shedeur Sanders , who faced an unexpected slide in the 2023 draft.Shedeur Sanders , known for his stellar college career and impressive stats, leading the Big 12 in passing yards, touchdowns, and completion percentage was widely expected to be one of the top quarterbacks selected in the 2023 NFL Draft. Instead, he found himself dropping to the fifth round, a surprising fall that left many scratching their heads. Despite his college success, the Cleveland Browns passed on him twice in the second round before selecting him in the fifth.In the wake of Sanders' draft slide, John Lynch, the 49ers' general manager, stepped forward with a message of encouragement. Reflecting on the unexpected success of Brock Purdy, Lynch reminded everyone that a player’s draft position doesn't define their potential. ""It’s not when you go, it’s not where you go, it’s what you do with that opportunity,"" Lynch shared in a post-draft press conference. Purdy’s journey from being overlooked by 31 teams to leading the 49ers to the brink of a Super Bowl—proves that success is built on the right mindset and seizing opportunities, no matter when or where they come.Lynch showed empathy for Sanders, acknowledging the emotional toll of the draft process. “It’s tough for a young man, but I know that he's a competitor.” Lynch said, recognizing the pressure and disappointment Sanders likely faced. But he also emphasized Sanders' competitive nature, expressing confidence that the quarterback now has the chance to prove his worth with the Cleveland Browns.Much like Purdy, Sanders now has a golden opportunity to prove his doubters wrong. While his fall in the draft may have been a blow to his pride, it also positions him to make a statement and potentially redefine his career. This is the moment where he can transform his narrative from an overlooked prospect to a standout NFL star.Also Read: “How Much Time Do You Have?” Jalen Milroe’s honest yet witty reply on where he needs to improve As Lynch reminded everyone, the real question isn’t about when or where you’re drafted, but what you do once you get the chance. And now, the ball is in Sanders' court. Can he rise above the doubt and take his career to new heights, just like Brock Purdy did? Only time will tell, but if his competitive spirit matches his talent, he might just become the next success story the NFL never saw coming.","Shedeur sanders was widely expected to be one of the top quarterbacks selected in the 2023 nfl draft.

A Father's Pride: How RR, Dravid & Vikram Shaped Vaibhav Suryavanshi

NEW DELHI: Punjab Kings spinner Yuzvendra Chahal sent cricket fans into a frenzy on Wednesday night with a jaw-dropping hat-trick against Chennai Super Kings (CSK), and among the many reacting to his heroics was RJ Mahvash, who posted a now-viral tribute on social media: “God mode on kya? Yuzvendra Chahal strength of a warrior sir.”The comment, shared on Instagram, quickly gained attention — not only for the praise it heaped on Chahal, but also because of ongoing dating rumours linking the RJ and the star spinner.The post added fuel to fan curiosity while celebrating one of the greatest bowling displays of IPL 2025 so far.Playing for Punjab Kings, Chahal turned the tide in the 19th over of the CSK innings at Chepauk.With CSK cruising at 177 for 5 and looking to finish strong, the leg-spinner struck gold, removing MS Dhoni , Deepak Hooda, Anshul Kamboj, and Noor Ahmad in the space of just six balls.He finished with incredible figures of 4 for 32 in just three overs.Dhoni, who had just hit Chahal for a six, was caught trying to clear long-off.Hooda and Kamboj followed in quick succession, both falling cheaply.Chahal sealed his hat-trick with the wicket of Noor Ahmad, joining an elite list of bowlers to take four wickets in a single IPL over.This was Chahal’s second IPL hat-trick and a record-breaking ninth instance of him claiming four or more wickets in an innings, the most in league history.The performance stunned CSK and tilted the momentum completely in Punjab’s favour.","Punjab kings spinner yuzvendra chahal took a hat-trick against chennai super kings.

Giannis Antetokounmpo and Tyrese Haliburton’s father’s altercation stole the spotlight at Gainbridge Fieldhouse



Fans reacted to Giannis Antetokounmpo’s confrontation with Tyrese Haliburton’s father

The Indiana Pacers edged out a dramatic 119-118 overtime victory against the Milwaukee Bucks . While Tyrese Haliburton 's game-winning shot over Giannis Antetokounmpo lit up Gainbridge Fieldhouse, the postgame headlines were stolen by a courtside altercation between Giannis and Haliburton's father, John. Fans online are not happy with John’s move, as many are asking the NBA to ban him from the playoffs.Giannis Antetokounmpo was making his way off the court when John Haliburton approached him, waving a towel with his son's face on it and allegedly yelling, “This is what we do.” The bold move did not sit well with the two-time MVP, who interpreted the act as a blatant show of disrespect. Giannis responded, and the two ended up in a tense face-to-face standoff that required players and staff from both benches to intervene.Giannis later addressed the confrontation: “I believe in being humble in victory. That’s who I am,” he said in his postgame comments. “Some people will say when you win the game, you can talk s___ and say it’s a green light for you to be disrespectful. I disagree. I’ve won a championship, they haven’t.”The Bucks star added, “I feel like that’s very, very disrespectful.”Tyrese Haliburton didn’t shy away from the issue either. Addressing the incident in his postgame press conference, he took accountability for his father’s actions. “As far as the incident between Giannis and my pops, I had no idea until I got to the back and was shown the video. I don’t agree with what transpired... I don’t think that my pops was in the right at all there.”Fans online quickly shared their thoughts on the matter. Many demand a ban on John Haliburton from the NBA games as a form of punishment.“Better be banned for the rest of the playoffs for this dumb s*it,” one fan wrote on X.“Father should be banned for rest of playoffs,” another echoed the same.“Father a bad example of sportsmanship,” another wrote.“I’m glad i saw this angle cause Hali dad was deff in the wrong for taunting Giannis after a big loss like that,” another shared.“What a clown,” one fan condemned the action of John.“Why is he seeking out a 7 foot Greek god like that.

The feud between former Pittsburgh Steelers stars Antonio Brown and Ben Roethlisberger has been one of the most dramatic in NFL history , but it just got even more bizarre. In a recent twist, Brown dropped a bombshell, claiming that he once hooked up with Roethlisberger’s sister during the 2011 Pro Bowl. This revelation has sent shockwaves through social media, adding fuel to an already intense rivalry.

But this latest bombshell may just be his most jaw-dropping move yet.The reaction from fans has been explosive. On social media, many are calling out Brown for airing such personal details in public, while others are applauding him for his unapologetic attitude.Antonio Brown and Ben Roethlisberger’s feud has been simmering for years, dating back to Brown’s time with the Pittsburgh Steelers. Brown has often criticized Roethlisberger, calling out his leadership style and claiming mistreatment during their time together. The timing of Brown’s recent claim about hooking up with Roethlisberger’s sister at the 2011 Pro Bowl seems intentional, as it reignites the long-standing rivalry and shifts focus back onto their personal issues.This revelation, while evil, doesn’t just add another chapter to the Brown-Roethlisberger saga, it also raises questions about how we view the legacies of both players. Roethlisberger, once considered one of the top quarterbacks of his era, now faces a renewed focus on his personal relationships, both within and outside of football. Brown, on the other hand, has long been a polarizing figure, but his most recent comments may just solidify his reputation as one of the most unpredictable and controversial players in NFL history.Also read - Cam Newton calls Shedeur Sanders “too cocky and snobbish,” and fans say Cam is finally getting a taste of his own medicine","Antonio brown tweeted that he and ben roethlisberger's sister had a one-night fling during the 2011 pro bowl.

A Father's Pride: How RR, Dravid & Vikram Shaped Vaibhav Suryavanshi

NEW DELHI: Punjab Kings (PBKS) have suffered a major blow ahead of their crucial IPL 2025 clash against Chennai Super Kings , as star Australian all-rounder Glenn Maxwell has been ruled out of the remainder of the tournament due to a fractured finger.PBKS skipper Shreyas Iyer confirmed the news at the toss on Wednesday, saying, “Unfortunate that he's got a fractured finger. Haven’t decided on a replacement so far.”Maxwell, bought for a hefty Rs 4.2 crore, has had a disappointing season with the bat, scoring just 48 runs in seven matches at an average of 8.00.While he managed to pick up four wickets, his overall performance fell well short of expectations, and his absence now leaves a significant hole in the PBKS middle order.PBKS will still back themselves to perform at Chepauk, coming into the match with five wins from nine games and sitting fifth on the table.With the playoffs in sight, they’ll look to cement their position with a win against a struggling CSK.For Chennai, this is a do-or-die clash. Languishing at the bottom of the table with just two wins in nine matches, the Super Kings are desperate to reignite their campaign.Despite the return of MS Dhoni as captain after Ruturaj Gaikwad’s injury, CSK have failed to turn things around. Poor form from senior players like Ravindra Jadeja, Rachin Ravindra, and Matheesha Pathirana has hurt their chances badly.However, CSK have found hope in young Ayush Mhatre, who impressed on debut and will again be key against PBKS’s potent bowling attack, especially in the powerplay against Arshdeep Singh.The duel between Shivam Dube and Yuzvendra Chahal in the middle overs could also prove decisive.With both teams having everything to play for, fans can expect a high-stakes showdown tonight in Chennai.","Glenn maxwell ruled out of remainder of ipl with fractured finger.
