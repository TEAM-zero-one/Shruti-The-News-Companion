Gautam Gambhir hits out at critics after India beat Australia to reach Champions Trophy final

Virat Kohli steers India to third consecutive Champions Trophy final

NEW DELHI: The outcome of Sunday’s ICC Champions Trophy final is likely to form the base for Indian cricket’s preparation for the ODI World Cup in 2027 and the next World Test Championship (WTC) cycle.It could determine the future course for captain Rohit Sharma with the Indian cricket board (BCCI) keen on having a stable leadership while planning the coming two years.According to sources, there could be a tough discussion over moving on from Rohit at least as captain in ODIs and Tests. The board has also held back announcing the fresh central contracts and will wait for the final against New Zealand. TOI understands chief selector Ajit Agarkar and head coach Gautam Gambhir have already discussed the proposition with the board and Rohit after returning from the Australia tour. It is also learnt that during the meeting, the Indian captain was not averse to the idea of setting a roadmap for the team once the Champions Trophy ends.“Rohit still believes there is some cricket left in him. He has been told to communicate his plans going forward. Retiring is his call but there will be another discussion around continuing with captaincy. Rohit himself understands the need to have a stable captain if the team wants to prepare for a World Cup. There have been talks with Kohli too but there doesn’t seem to be much anxiety around him,” a BCCI source told TOI.BCCI usually announces its annual player retainership before the IPL. The board wanted to see how the team fared in the Champions Trophy after a disastrous Test season.It is learnt that the board wanted to revisit the Grade A+ contracts. Currently, Rohit, Kohli, Jasprit Bumrah and Ravindra Jadeja make up the top grade.With BCCI’s policy suggesting that players performing in all three formats are preferred for A+ contracts, there were some concerns with Rohit, Kohli and Jadeja retiring from T20Is and also enduring a very rough Test season. However, a strong showing in the Champions Trophy could help these players retain the marquee contract.It will be interesting to see if Axar Patel, KL Rahul and Rishabh Pant are promoted to A category. Shreyas Iyer is likely to win back his central contract after he was removed last year due to disciplinary issues. Kohli has sort of strengthened his case with a superlative show in the Champions Trophy so far.“The board will wait for Rohit’s decision after the Champions Trophy. If by any chance he chooses to retire, then the board will see what needs to be done. One can’t discount the fact that he won the T20 World Cup in July and has led well in the Champions Trophy as well,” the source said.Interestingly, MS Dhoni had quit white-ball captaincy two years before the 2019 World Cup which gave Kohli time to ease into the role.Kohli too stepped down as white-ball captain in 2021, leaving Rohit two years to run the team before the 2023 ODI World Cup.Factoring in that current ODI vice-captain Shubman Gill is still raw as a captain and Jasprit Bumrah’s persisting fitness issues, the selectors will need more time if they have to move on from Rohit.",The outcome of sunday's icc champions trophy final is likely to form the base for indian cricket’s preparation for the odi world cup in 2027 and the next world test championship (wtc) cycle.

Eric Bischoff and Hogan took me aside right before going to the ring and go, ‘Hey, we’re switching the belt.’ ‘What are you talking about?’ ‘We’re switching the belt tonight.’ ‘On me? With Hogan? Hogan is going to put me over on national TV? Not pay-per-view?’ ‘It’s Nitro. You guys have been left laying for 63 straight weeks. We need to throw the fans a little bone. We’re going to put the title on you tonight. You’re red hot. Sting is coming out of the ceiling, but you’re there every week and the fans are with you.’”

Sunil Chhetri return for India both good news and bad,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/sunil-chhetris-return-for-india-both-good-news-and-bad/articleshow/118793430.cms,"With 94 goals, the talismanic Sunil Chhetri is India’s greatest goal-getter

Panaji: Last year, Indian football lived out its annus horribilis.Mostly under former coach Igor Stimac – a defender who had helped Croatia win third place at the 1998 World Cup in France — the national team failed to log in even a single international win to its name. The team played 11 games and lost six. Five games were drawn, four goals were scored and 15 conceded, numbers that prompted even the staunchest fans to turn their backs on a team that had promised so much only a year back, when India won an unprecedented three trophies and broke into the top 100 of the FIFA rankings for the first time since 2017.Last year also happened to be when Sunil Chhetri decided to call time on a much-feted 19-year-old international career.Today, barely three months into 2025, the state of the game in India continues to be so dire that Manolo Marquez , Stimac’s successor after the Croatian was shown the door, has had to coax the 40-year-old striker to come to the aid of the party. Chhetri has been recalled in the hope that he will bail out India in the opening clash of the Asian Cup 2027 final round qualifiers against Bangladesh – that slippery regional rival -- later this month.With 94 goals, the talismanic Chhetri is India’s greatest goal-getter, but his return to the Indian fold is both good news and bad.He is third to only Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi in the all-time active scorers’ list, but last season, the goals had dried up, his last goal coming off a penalty in a 2-1 defeat to Afghanistan in March 2024.But Chhetri’s returns are not even half the problem.Indian football is tottering while facing a weird predicament. A tiny sample: Marquez , Stimac’s successor after the Croat was shown the door last year, is a much-respected Spanish coach known to mould young talent and get results.However, in a move awash with potential conflicts of interest, he was entrusted with the tricky responsibility of coaching both club, FC Goa, and country, an arrangement that suited the All India Football Federation (AIFF), its hands forced due to financial constraints, having paid a huge compensation ($400,000; ₹ 3.36 cr approx) to the sacked Stimac who had threatened to approach FIFA over unlawful termination.At the moment, Marquez reportedly draws his salary from his FC Goa employers, while the AIFF only pays for allowances during the National team camps, the understanding being that he will be full time with the AIFF from next year till May 2026, a deal that will cost the AIFF approximately ₹3 crore.But secretly, like any self-respecting mister, Marquez would be squirming inside. The Indian scenario presents such a contrast to where the 56-year-old Catalan perhaps first learnt his trade.Spain are the leading light of international football. Their biggest name is a 17-year-old, teeth-behind- braces schoolboy winger, Lamine Yamal, while their 40-year-old maestros do the playmaking in the middle rung of the depth-rich La Liga. In India, he has to recall a retired hero because he finds himself with no options.Spain and India are not exactly apples and oranges, you could argue. But it is also true that football – its processes and philosophies – is as alike as it can be dissimilar. Indian club football has been borrowing liberally from Spanish thought, but little or nothing of it shows up on the National side.In the four matches that India have played under Marquez, the team is still without a win. If it’s any consolation, there’s been just one loss, while the other three ended in draws. Strangely comforting has been the fact that the coach wasn’t too happy with draws against Mauritius, Malaysia and higher-ranked Vietnam.Yet, there hasn’t been a striker of note to put his hand up and be counted.Domestic forwards have fared poorly in the current ISL season. With 12 goals, second only to the Moroccan Alaaeddine Ajaraie at NorthEast United, Chhetri is in fine form, but his comeback from retirement exposes just how bare Indian football’s talent cupboard is.The forwards have never really delivered in the top-tier of Indian football, with most players struggling in front of goal. Only Brison Fernandes, a young winger from Goa, features among the top 10. Among the top 20, there’s Subhashish Bose, a left-back from Mohun Bagan Super Giant.Perhaps, Chhetri’s aura has loomed so large over Indian football over the past two decades that no one was found suitable. But that can never be an excuse.Indian football’s problems are too deep-rooted to disappear overnight, or even just under a year.Money certainly doesn’t seem to be the problem. There’s plenty of investment and footballers in the top-tier earn handsomely. A national team player for example will earn anywhere between Rs 1.5 crore to Rs 2.5 cr annually, depending on which club he chooses, a huge reward for a country that’s currently ranked 127th in the world.No wonder players are comfortable here and are in no mood to move abroad, play in lower divisions of Europe, and improve themselves, rubbing shoulders with those who are of a different level.Bhaichung Bhutia was among the first Indian footballers who challenged himself by choosing to move abroad in the early 2000s. The former India captain felt Chhetri coming out of retirement was good news for the national team but wasn’t too sure if it will help Indian football move ahead.“It’s very unfair to say Indian players don’t get the opportunities to play,” countered Bhutia, “There are other positions; attacking midfielders, wingers, lot of Indians are fielded there. Our youth development programmes must provide a more mature environment for attackers to grow. You see the best goal scorers are from South America because they create that culture as a kid for you. You have to be smart. That smartness has to be brought out right from a young age.“In grassroots, what we should include is a lot of small-sided games, streets football. The most important aspect for a striker (to score) is not to dribble or shoot from distance but get into the right positions. Great strikers always get into the right positions and make it look easy,” he added.A striker needs not just a nose for goals but also the skillset. But who’ll help him acquire that? “We don’t coach the position very well. We don’t have specialists,” pointed out Dempo CEO and AFC Pro Coaching License holder, Pradhyum Reddy.But do clubs – and coaches – have the luxury of time for that?“In football, the problem is that you don’t have time (to achieve results),” Marquez said during a Townhall with TOI in Goa last month, “If you lose four, five, six games you are usually sacked. For a coach, it’s very difficult to have a long vision. But, despite the difficulties, you have to move in the correct way, follow the process and wait for results. Sometimes, your ideas may be correct, but they will sack you (if the results are not good).”“Here,” Marquez strove to point out, “The challenge is not for me, it’s for Indian football. The aim is to develop Indian football, step by step. It will take time, maybe one, two or three years.”When the Indian Super League (ISL) was launched in 2014 with much fanfare, it helped attract more fans to the game. There was better crowd attendance, women flocked too for the first time and ground conditions improved drastically. There was professionalism in all aspects, but the standard of football hasn’t improved.Some have blamed it on the contract between FSDL, which runs the league, and the AIFF, which allows the top-tier not to have relegation. It simply means clubs are not under pressure to give their best once they know they aren’t going to make it to the playoffs. Everyone in football knows, that without relegation there is no competitive football in the league and there is no pressure on the players. That aspect greatly weakens things in the domestic competition.Then, of course, there’s the elephant in the room: foreign players. East Bengal’s young David Lalhlansanga has shown promise, scored four goals from 16 appearances, but he’s often been left on the bench in favour of Greek Dimitrios Diamantakos and Brazilian Cleiton Silva, despite the duo’s terrible form.At a time when foreigners accounted for 80% of all ISL goals, the foreign-player quota in ISL’s starting XI was cut down from five to four in 2021-22. There were hopes of a greater influx of Indian talent. That did happen, but the forwards have not really measured up to the challenge.“There are players (in the ISL) who would do great in the second division which doesn’t have foreign players. It would help them develop but obviously they won’t get the same money. If the money is significantly more, you cannot blame the players (for choosing to sit on the bench),” said Reddy.“Why not reduce foreign players at least in I-League?” asks Reddy, “If AIFF reduces the quota, there will be more opportunities. It does not make sense for clubs to register six when four are allowed to play. It’s a waste of money and opportunity to have two extra foreigners on the bench.”Former stars point to more obvious shortcomings.“Indian forwards must enhance their capabilities,” said former India striker and captain IM Vijayan . “Currently, they lack the stamina to sustain performance throughout a complete match. Despite showing promise in club competitions, they underperform while representing the national team. Their commitment falls short of what previous generations demonstrated.”That is perhaps why Marquez clearly marks Sunil Chhetri out from the rest of the domestic strikers. Commitment, and his famed mentality, even if all that’s revolving around his comeback is nothing short of surprising for any self-respecting football landscape that harbours ambitions of playing the World Cup soon.","Sunil chhetri is india’s greatest goal-getter, but his return to the indian fold is both good news and bad. He is third to only cristiano ronaldo and lionel messi in the all-time active scorers’ list, but last season, the goals had dried up. In the four matches that india have played under marquez, the team is still without a win.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118793428,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-72664,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

When and where to watch LaMelo Ball play tonight against the Cleveland Cavaliers (March 7, 2025)?

As the Charlotte Hornets prepare to face the Cleveland Cavaliers on Friday, March 7, 2025, at the Spectrum Center, all eyes are on LaMelo Ball’s injury status. The Hornets’ star point guard is listed as probable due to illness, raising questions about his availability for the game. LaMelo Ball ’s availability tonight faces uncertainty as he is listed as GTD on the team’s injury report. The Charlotte Hornets, struggling with a 14-47 record, are already dealing with a lengthy injury report. Brandon Miller, Tre Mann, and Grant Williams are out for the season, while key players like Mark Williams and Josh Okogie remain sidelined. Ball’s potential absence would further deplete a roster already missing significant firepower.Ball, who leads the team with 26.2 points per game, has been a bright spot in an otherwise challenging season for Charlotte. His ability to create plays and knock down three-pointers (averaging 3.9 per game) has been crucial. However, his illness adds uncertainty to the Hornets’ chances against the league-leading Cavaliers, who boast a 52-10 record and a fully healthy roster.The Cleveland Cavaliers , on the other hand, enter the matchup in peak form. Donovan Mitchell, averaging 24.4 points per game, headlines a squad that leads the NBA in scoring (123.1 points per game) and three-point shooting (39.3%). Their dominance on both ends of the floor makes them heavy favorites, especially against an injury-riddled Charlotte Hornets team.For Charlotte, Miles Bridges has stepped up in recent games, averaging 22.6 points and 8.4 rebounds over the last 20 contests. However, without Ball at full strength, the Hornets face an uphill battle against Cleveland’s suffocating defense and high-powered offense.Fans can catch the game live at 7 p.m. ET on FDSSE and FDSOH or stream it on Fubo. While the Cavaliers aim to extend their winning streak, the Charlotte Hornets hope Ball’s probable status turns into a green light, giving them a fighting chance in front of their home crowd.Also read: Will Donovan Mitchell play tonight against the Charlotte Hornets?

When and where to watch Nikola Jokic play tonight against the Phoenix Suns (March 7, 2025)?

The Denver Nuggets are facing potential setbacks as they prepare to host the Phoenix Suns on Friday, March 7, at Ball Arena. The team’s injury report lists five players, including reigning MVP Nikola Jokic, who is questionable with an ankle injury. Jokic’s availability remains uncertain, casting a shadow over the Nuggets’ chances in this critical Western Conference matchup. Nikola Jokic ’s availability faces uncertainty as he is listed as GTD in the team’s injury report. Jokic, the Denver Nuggets’ leading scorer and rebounder, has been instrumental in Denver’s success this season, averaging 28.8 points, 12.8 rebounds, and 11.3 assists per game. His absence would be a significant blow to the team, which currently holds a 40-22 record and sits third in the NBA in scoring (121 points per game).Alongside Jokic, forward Aaron Gordon is also questionable with an ankle issue, while Julian Strawther (knee) and DaRon Holmes (Achilles) are ruled out. Zeke Nnaji, however, is probable with an ankle injury. The Nuggets’ depth will be tested if Jokic and Gordon are sidelined, especially against a Suns team looking to climb the standings.The Suns, led by Devin Booker and Kevin Durant, have their own injury concerns. Bradley Beal is questionable with a calf strain, and Cody Martin is out with an abdominal injury. Despite their 29-33 record, the Suns remain dangerous, ranking eighth in three-pointers made per game (14.2) and fourth in three-point percentage (37.8%).Jokic’s potential absence could shift the dynamics of the game. Denver’s offense heavily relies on his playmaking and scoring, and his defensive presence on the boards is unmatched. Without him, the Denver Nuggets would need Jamal Murray and Michael Porter Jr. to step up significantly.Fans can catch the game live on ESPN, ALT, and AZFamily, or stream it on Fubo. Tip-off is set for 10 p.m. ET.Also read: Will Devin Booker play tonight against the Denver Nuggets?

Cleveland and Oklahoma City.

Charles Barkley predicts the Eastern Conference Finals winner



As the 2024-25 NBA season winds down, the playoff picture is taking shape, with the race for the championship heating up. While many eyes remain fixated on the Los Angeles Lakers and Golden State Warriors following their blockbuster trade deadline acquisitions of Luka Doncic and Jimmy Butler, TNT analyst Charles Barkley has made it clear that the real story lies elsewhere, specifically inDuring a recent segment on Inside the NBA, Charles Barkley made a bold prediction regarding the Cleveland Cavaliers, who currently hold the best record in the Eastern Conference. The NBA Hall of Famer did not hold back as he declared them the favorites to win the conference and advance to the NBA Finals.""Man, the Cleveland Cavaliers are going to the finals,"" Barkley said. ""The Celtics, that's going to be a great series if they play the Celtics. But right now, I'm telling y'all, and I told you to book it last week. The Cleveland Cavaliers are going to the NBA Finals.""The Cavaliers' dominance this season has been undeniable. As the only team in the NBA with three All-Stars— Donovan Mitchell, Evan Mobley, and Darius Garland— Cleveland has emerged as an offensive powerhouse. They are averaging a league-best 123.1 points per game. Their defense, anchored by Mobley and Jarrett Allen, has been just as formidable. Their playoff spot is already secured.However, while the Cavaliers and the Oklahoma City Thunder— who currently lead the Western Conference— continue their dominant seasons, Barkley took issue with the lack of media coverage they are receiving compared to the Lakers and Warriors. He directly called out ESPN for its fixation on the two storied franchises, arguing that smaller-market teams are being unfairly overlooked.""The Lakers are doing great,"" Barkley said. ""Got a long way to go. But the reason the season's been going great is the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Oklahoma City Thunder. Y'all just want to talk about the Warriors and the Lakers. They're both doing great, don't get me wrong. If I turn out to be wrong, I got no problem with that. But y'all are idiots cause y'all talk about the Lakers and the Warriors all the time.""Barkley further asserted that the league’s best teams deserve more attention than they’re getting.""The Cleveland Cavaliers have won 12 straight games,"" he continued. ""Oklahoma City got the MVP and they are on fire. Y'all are talking about who's in second place. That's the reason I get pissed.""Also Read: Steve Kerr gives major update on Brandin Podziemski's injury as Golden State Warriors secure a huge win against Brooklyn Nets It is no secret that the Cavaliers have been one of the most underrated teams in the league despite standing on the top of the Eastern Conference standing with a solid 52-game winning stats, losing only 10 games this season.",Charles barkley predicts the eastern conference finals winner for the 2024-25 nba season.

Head coach JJ Redick has repeatedly praised him, calling him a key rotation player.According to The Athletic’s Jovan Buha, the Los Angeles Lakers are expected to convert Goodwin’s contract as late as possible to maximize financial flexibility. ""I do expect him to be converted at the end of the season as late as possible, and then be on the playoff roster. ...
