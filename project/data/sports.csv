Poll Do you believe that celebrity relationships can remain low-key like Crosby and Leutner's? Yes, absolutely! Not really, it's hard to stay private

Sidney Crosby 15 years long relationship with girlfriend Kathy Leutner





NHL legend Sidney Crosby has not only guided the Pittsburgh Penguins to championship heights but has also established a quiet, solid, long-lasting relationship off the ice with long-time girlfriend American model Kathy Leutner. Though Sidney Crosby's on-ice accomplishments are well-documented, his love life has long been kept under wraps. Kathy Leutner has been his constant companion, regularly seen cheering him on at pivotal matches but never hankering for the limelight herself.The two began dating back in 2008 when they were introduced by common friends. Sidney Crosby was an NHL superstar by then, while Kathy Leutner was establishing a thriving modeling career for brands including Abercrombie & Fitch, Hollister, and Faviana. She was selected in 2011 to appear on Sports Illustrated's model search and was one of the very few women from her agency to receive an in-office interview with the editorial team. Kathy Leutner has been Sidney Crosby's rock since the start of his NHL career. They met when he was just 21 years old, in his third NHL season with the Pittsburgh Penguins.Born in 1986 in Chantilly, Virginia, Kathryn A. Leutner is the daughter of John and Judith Leutner.She graduated from Chantilly High School in 2004 and was offered a partial athletic scholarship from James Madison University, a testament to her prowess in the sport. Despite her strong ties to athletics, modeling quickly took over. She was discovered at a mall near her hometown, just a year after graduating from high school, while shopping with her mother.Kathy began her modeling career in 2005 and got her big break in 2011 when she appeared in Sports Illustrated magazine.Leutner once confessed in an initial interview that sports was her main focus, but the moment she entered the modeling world, she knew that this was what she was meant to do. Her dream came true when she started gracing the covers of Fitness Magazine and landing campaigns for big lifestyle brands.The couple is yet to make any announcements of marriage plans; their long-term relationship speaks of a connection much stronger than social media pronouncements or red carpet sightings. Despite their lack of public announcements about their future plans, fans wish for a potential engagement or wedding.Sidney Crosby and Kathy Leutner are arguably the sport's most low-key celebrity couple, but their almost two-decade relationship is telling. Where fame usually drowns out personal life, this couple shows us that true love doesn't require attention. While Crosby keeps working on building his NHL legacy, Leutner is his biggest fan, sitting quietly in the background while still playing an important role behind the scenes.Also Read: With Mike Sullivan gone and Dan Muse in, Sidney Crosby‚Äôs loyalty faces the ultimate test",Sidney crosby has been dating american model kathy leutner for 15 years.

Magic Johnson sends a clear message to the Indiana Pacers, pointing out a major mistake







The Indiana Pacers missed a critical opportunity to seize control of the NBA Finals on Sunday night, falling to the Oklahoma City Thunder 123-107 in Game 2. Now tied at one game apiece, the Pacers face growing pressure as the series shifts to Indianapolis, especially after Lakers icon Magic Johnson pinpointed a glaring issue in Indiana‚Äôs offensive game plan.Following the Game 2 loss at Paycom Center, Magic Johnson delivered an unfiltered assessment of what‚Äôs holding the Indiana Pacers back against the surging Thunder. ‚ÄúIf the Indiana Pacers are going to win Game 3, Haliburton‚Äôs mindset needs to be score the basketball right from the tip and get the Pacers into their transition game. In Games 1 and 2, they played too much half court basketball and they can‚Äôt beat the Oklahoma City Thunder playing that style,‚Äù Johnson posted on X.Magic's statement hit at the core of Indiana‚Äôs approach. For the second game in a row, the Pacers stumbled out of the gate. Tyrese Haliburton, who has been the offensive catalyst all season, was once again a non-factor in the first half, registering just three points and three assists on 1-of-5 shooting.Haliburton admitted the Thunder‚Äôs aggressive defense forced him off rhythm. ‚ÄúThis is who they are defensively,‚Äù he said.‚ÄúThey got a lot of different guys who can guard the ball, fly around ... I just got to figure out how to be better earlier in games. Kudos to them, they're a great defensive team. But [I will] watch the film, see where I can get better.‚ÄùThe Thunder, led by a dominant 34-point performance from Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, overwhelmed Indiana with ball pressure and rim protection. OKC also got major contributions from Alex Caruso (20 points), Jalen Williams (19), Aaron Wiggins (18), and Chet Holmgren (15), showcasing the depth Indiana is struggling to match.Haliburton, who exited the postgame press conference with a visible limp, pointed to strategic adjustments the Pacers need to make going forward. ‚ÄúOur offense is built from the inside out. We got to do a better job getting downhill. They collapse and then make plays there, but I thought we could improve a lot there.‚ÄùHe also recognized the importance of altering his playmaking dynamics. ‚ÄúWe had some success there, me playing off the pitch a little bit more, flying around rather than if I'm in that high ball screen... that gives them a chance to really load up, pack the paint,‚Äù the Pacers standout shared.He added, ‚ÄúThere are many different ways that you can choose to digest what's in front of you. We just focus on taking it a day at a time. You got the split. You feel good about that. But we definitely wanted to play better tonight.‚ÄùAlso Read: Los Angeles Lakers legend Magic Johnson sends praise for OKC Thunder following huge Game 2 win The Pacers now return to Gainbridge Fieldhouse for Game 3 on Wednesday, marking the city‚Äôs first NBA Finals game in 25 years. As the series balanced and the Thunder‚Äôs defensive blueprint worked to perfection, Indiana must act on Johnson‚Äôs advice quickly, or risk falling behind in a series that‚Äôs slipping fast. Regardless, the stakes are high with the series tied 1-1. Of course, Game 3 will not be the decider but it would bring the winner one step closer to the championship dream.","Indiana pacers lost 123-107 to the oklahoma city thunder in game 2 of the nba finals.

'A particularly special feeling': Andy Flower hails Virat Kohli, RCB after historic title win





NEW DELHI: Diageo India, the Indian branch of UK-based Diageo Plc and owner of the IPL franchise Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB), has firmly rejected rumours of selling the team. In a letter addressed to the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and its Surveillance Department on Tuesday, June 10, a Diageo India representative stated that the media reports suggesting a potential sale are purely speculative.""The company would like to clarify that the aforesaid media reports are speculative in nature and it is not pursuing any such discussion,"" Mital Sanghvi, the company secretary, informed the regulating body of the Indian Stock Market. ""This is for your information and records.""According to a Cricbuzz report, Diageo's statement was in response to a query from the Bombay Stock Exchange, where the company is publicly listed. Since speculation about a possible sale of the RCB franchise began circulating, shares of United Spirits ‚Äî the Diageo-owned company that holds RCB ‚Äî have seen a notable uptick.On Tuesday, Bloomberg reported that Diageo is considering selling the IPL champions.The report surfaced shortly after RCB‚Äôs maiden IPL title win on June 3 ‚Äî a milestone achieved after 17 years ‚Äî followed tragically by an incident in Bengaluru on June 4, where celebrations turned fatal, leaving 11 dead and many injured.Though Diageo officially dismissed the sale reports as ""speculative,"" the ambiguity of their statement has sparked deeper speculation. A seasoned voice in India‚Äôs sports business ecosystem suggested that ‚Äúbeing a public company, there will be a lot of pressure on reputational damage,‚Äù hinting that Diageo could be weighing its options more seriously than publicly admitted.There are also murmurs about Diageo valuing the RCB franchise at around USD 2 billion. While some industry insiders view that figure as inflated ‚Äî especially when compared to Torrent‚Äôs acquisition of Gujarat Titans at approximately INR 7500 crore (around USD 1 billion) ‚Äî others disagree. Lalit Modi , the architect of the IPL, told Cricbuzz that a USD 2 billion valuation for RCB is quite realistic.""I will not be surprised if it is sold for a higher price,"" he remarked, adding that comparing the RCB valuation to that of the newer Gujarat franchise isn‚Äôt an apples-to-apples comparison.""I will not be surprised if it is sold for a higher price,"" he said , stating that the valuation of GT cannot be compared here since it was a one-year-old deal.The sale report remains speculative, as clarified by the Diageo official in the response to the BSE.""No decision is final and they may decide against selling the team, the people said, asking not to be named as the details are private,"" the Bloomberg report says.","Royal challengers bengaluru (rcb) are the ipl champions.

As Kansas City Chiefs star tight end Travis Kelce enters what could be the most critical‚Äîand possibly final‚Äîseason of his NFL career, insiders reveal that his once fairytale romance with pop superstar Taylor Swift is beginning to encounter growing strain, as the stark contrast between Kelce‚Äôs rigid training schedule and Swift‚Äôs glamorous, fast-paced lifestyle creates subtle but mounting tension behind closed doors.According to the Star Magazine, Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce‚Äîboth 35‚Äîare entering a challenging new chapter in their relationship. Kelce, still reeling from a devastating Super Bowl loss, has thrown himself into a punishing fitness schedule, complete with strict calorie tracking, early nights, and intense workouts. And while Swift has been supportive, even traveling to Florida recently for a quiet night out in West Palm Beach, sources say the pop icon is starting to feel the strain.‚ÄúEveryone told her dating an athlete comes with sacrifices,‚Äù an insider reportedly told Star Magazine. ‚ÄúBut she didn‚Äôt expect the lifestyle to be so rigid.‚ÄùTaylor Swift, known for her electrifying performances and glamorous public appearances, is reportedly finding Kelce‚Äôs football-focused lifestyle less than thrilling.

With training camp looming, his focus has turned almost entirely to the field. That drive for redemption has reportedly left little room for the kind of spontaneous fun the couple once enjoyed‚Äîwhether that meant surprise date nights or jet-setting between concert stops.Though their relationship remains strong on the surface, close friends say Swift misses the spark of earlier days‚Äîthose filled with concert cameos, hand-in-hand appearances on red carpets, and playful social media posts. Now, reality is setting in as they try to balance two high-octane careers that demand very different daily rhythms.Still, Swift continues to show up for Kelce.

After days of unrelenting speculation, Vanessa Bryant took to Instagram Stories on Sunday, June 1, to put the rumors to rest.

His demise created a huge void in the NBA world as fans are still mourning his untimely passing.Since their passing, she‚Äôs kept their memory alive through meaningful business ventures and charitable work.

Victor Wembanyama embarks on a 10‚Äëday Shaolin monk retreat after DVT diagnosis sidelines season

How a Shaolin retreat could reshape Wembanyama‚Äôs comeback‚Äîphysically and mentally





Standing at 7 feet 3 inches, this NBA superstar is trading in his high-flying dunks for some much-needed calm. Victor Wembanyama of the San Antonio Spurs was recently seen at the iconic Shaolin Temple in China, where he swapped his signature curls for a shaved head and donned monk robes. This tranquil appearance comes after he had to sit out early in the season back in February due to a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in his right shoulder. Fans are now left wondering: is this spiritual break just a pause, or is it a significant step towards healing and refocusing for the next NBA season?Victor Wembanyama, who was named the 2023‚Äë24 NBA Rookie of the Year, has embarked on a ten-day retreat at the historic Shaolin Temple in Henan Province, diving deep into monk life. Last season, he averaged 24.3 points, 11 rebounds, and 3.7 assists per game, but his campaign ended early in February due to a rare case of deep vein thrombosis in his right shoulder. Now, he‚Äôs swapping the basketball court for a monastic lifestyle ‚Äì donning traditional grey robes, enjoying vegetarian meals, and sitting quietly among Buddha statues.On this quiet 10-day spiritual trip, Wembanyama has apparently set aside the usual NBA tour excitement in China.He took a break from his travel plans from checking out the Great Wall to seeing Beijing to fully dive into Shaolin Kung Fu and meditation. Access to the temple has been limited, and the young star has turned down media interactions to keep the peace of his retreat.This isn‚Äôt just about Zen and being alone, it‚Äôs a calculated strategy that fuses physical therapy with mental resilience. The Shaolin training underscores both intense physical discipline and inner clarity traits that align with Wembanyama‚Äôs elite athletic goals. After being diagnosed with DVT after the All-Star Game, he has been taking a measured recovery getting back into weight training and court work in April stressing, ‚Äúthere are definitely steps for me to reach. ‚Äù Now, this monk-like break could sharpen his mindset, giving him a fresh purpose as he looks forward to a full recovery and a return for the 2025 season.Also Read: Giannis Antetokounmpo shuts down LeBron James critics with bold tweet backing NBA legend‚Äôs skillset Social media is buzzing with excitement.

The NBA‚Äôs China sector even recognized his journey of reflection and healing on its official X account.","Victor wembanyama has embarked on a 10-day retreat at the historic shaolin temple in henan province, diving deep into monk life.

Otto Kemp's clutch performance validates the Philadelphia Phillies' player development system

How Otto Kemp's versatility strengthens Philadelphia Phillies' roster depth





Otto Kemp‚Äôs impressive major league debut highlights that undrafted players can make a difference when needed, since the 25-year-old rookie‚Äôs three-hit contest helped the Philadelphia Phillies beat the Chicago Cubs 4-3 in extra time at Citizens Bank Park. A Point Loma Nazarene University graduate who had not been drafted and became a free agent last year played very well in his home debut, collecting three hits and making a key bunt single that helped Brandon Marsh win the game with his walk-off. The win ended a five-game losing streak and demonstrated how well the team‚Äôs farm system is working.Otto Kemp‚Äôs first game with the Philadelphia Phillies showed that the team was ready to give a chance to less-noticed players. Rob Thomson, the manager, had already noticed Kemp‚Äôs good batting average and strong approach to the game when he was playing for Triple-A Lehigh Valley.Jacob Smith‚Äôs first major league hit came off Cubs starter Matthew Boyd in the fifth inning, and he aims to remember the moment by framing the ball. Otto Kemp made his way to third base on Boyd‚Äôs missing throw, and then scored after Weston Wilson got an RBI single, making it 2-1 for the Philadelphia team.Otto Kemp stood out mainly because he could perform effectively in stressful situations. In the 2021 St. Cloud Rox summer baseball game, Kemp made his last attempt at a bunt, and now, in the 11th inning, he used a bunt to set up the rally that won the game.Otto Kemp‚Äôs ability to play in multiple spots will greatly benefit the Philadelphia Phillies in the future. While playing in Triple-A, he was the starting third baseman in 33 games, appeared in 17 games at both first and second base, and in seven games in the outfield.Rob Thomson said Otto Kemp might play both first base and the outfield as he begins his major league career. Now that Bryce Harper is out with wrist problems, Kemp gets a chance to help the team right away. The Phillies believe Otto Kemp can handle various playing roles and still continue his offensive success. His 14 home runs and 55 RBI in 58 games in Triple-A showed that he can handle both power plays and key hitting situations.The significant emotions of Otto Kemp‚Äôs arrival were clear as everyone in the family went the extra mile to witness it. His wife brought their dog and drove up from North Carolina, while his parents took a red-eye flight from California also to attend their son‚Äôs first game at Citizens Bank Park.NBC Sports Philadelphia and MLB.TV will be showing the games, so fans can watch Otto Kemp as he follows up on his great debut.Also Read: Why MLB dropped ESPN and what it means for baseball fans in 2025 The Philadelphia Phillies' victory over the Chicago Cubs demonstrated that sometimes the most impactful stories come from unexpected sources.

Tua ‚Äôs sudden body change sparks buzz across NFL







Tua Tagovailoa showed up to Dolphins minicamp looking like a different man and fans can‚Äôt stop talking. Just months after viral photos showed him looking bloated and out of shape, the quarterback now looks lean, locked-in, and lighter than ever. But behind the physical change, questions are swirling about what's really going on in Miami.When Tua Tagovailoa stepped onto the field at Dolphins minicamp this week, jaws dropped ‚Äî and not because of a perfectly placed spiral. The 27-year-old quarterback stunned onlookers with a completely new physique, shedding the bulky frame seen just three months ago in now-infamous boat party pictures. Gone is the puffiness; in its place is a noticeably slimmer, sharper Tua.While some fans are applauding the transformation as a sign of renewed commitment, others are digging deeper. Was this a genuine health overhaul ‚Äî or a response to the harsh online backlash that followed his offseason antics? Either way, Tagovailoa has once again become the center of NFL gossip, with social media dissecting every inch of his new look.Last season, Tagovailoa played just 11 games, finishing with 2,867 passing yards, 19 touchdowns, and 7 interceptions ‚Äî solid, but far from elite.His ongoing injury struggles, especially multiple concussions, have raised long-term concerns about his future in Miami. And with Zach Wilson arriving from Denver and rookie Quinn Ewers joining the QB room, the pressure has never been higher.Tua addressed the media with calm confidence, noting a ‚Äúculture shift‚Äù within the Dolphins. But it‚Äôs not the locker room culture fans are gossiping about. It‚Äôs the quarterback‚Äôs body. And in a league that scrutinizes its stars relentlessly, such a drastic shift in appearance was bound to raise eyebrows.Also Read: Myles Garrett sends chilling warning to Aaron Rodgers: ‚ÄúPut him in the graveyard‚Äù Transformation stories are nothing new in the NFL.

NEW DELHI: Former India spinner Harbhajan Singh has backed Australia to retain the World Test Championship (WTC) title in the upcoming final against South Africa at Lord‚Äôs, citing their superior familiarity with English conditions as a key factor.Led by Pat Cummins , Australia are aiming to become the first team to win the WTC title twice, having secured the mace in 2023 by defeating India at The Oval in the tournament‚Äôs second edition.In contrast, South Africa, captained by Temba Bavuma, are set to play their maiden WTC final.

While this is their first appearance in a red-ball ICC final, they have consistently featured in recent ICC knockout events.‚ÄúAustralia will come prepared. They‚Äôve played a lot of cricket in England - Ashes, the last WTC Final - and that experience will count. They understand these conditions better than South Africa. Plus, they‚Äôre a champion side. The difference lies in how you handle pressure during big matches, and Aussies are masters at that.

Q. You've played in the IPL, come from a country like England where cricket is extremely popular. And then you go to the US, where you have to explain the basics of the sport. How much of a challenge is that?

Liam Plunkett:

Q. Do you recall a moment where you had to explain the sport, and you've been a little surprised by how challenging that could be?

Q. Conventionally everyone thinks and knows the longer formats. How do you sell the T20 format?

Q. How do you build the sport at the grassroots level? Which not only makes the sport pppular but also feeds into the MLC.

Liam Plunkett:

Q. Another challenge is infrastructure. For a sport to become big, especially in the US, it needs to go through the NCAA system. It needs to be followed at the lowest level, but you need to have good grounds and stadiums. How do you work your way around that?

Liam Plunkett:

Q. MLC have consciously kept focus on US market and audience, not pandering to the Indian TV share. What do you make of that decision?
