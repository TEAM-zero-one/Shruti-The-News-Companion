EXCLUSIVE: India to boycott Pakistan in Asia Cup? Harbhajan Singh says, 'Khoon aur paani ek saath nahi beh sakte'

Poll Who do you think had the upper hand in the rivalry between Irfan Pathan and Shahid Afridi? Irfan Pathan Shahid Afridi It was evenly matched Not sure

NEW DELHI: Former Pakistan leg-spinner Danish Kaneria has stirred fresh controversy by backing Irfan Pathan ’s explosive revelations about his long-standing rivalry with Shahid Afridi , calling out the former Pakistan captain for resorting to personal attacks.Pathan, who enjoyed considerable success against Pakistan — with 67 wickets and 807 runs in Indo-Pak clashes — dismissed Afridi 11 times across formats, including a golden duck in the 2007 T20 World Cup final. Speaking to Lallantop, the former India all-rounder recalled how the rivalry turned bitter after Afridi mocked his identity in an interview.“Afridi had said, ‘I am the real Pathan, he is a fake Pathan’. Badtameez aadmi hai. Mujhe laga ki aap sirf mere baare mein nahi bol rahe ho, mere walid ke baare mein bhi baat kar rahe,” Pathan revealed. “So whenever I had the ball in hand, I made sure I dismissed him. I have shown him 11 times who the real Pathan is — in big moments, in series deciders, and in the World Cup final.”Kaneria, Afridi’s former teammate, echoed Pathan’s claims in a scathing social media post. “Irfan @IrfanPathan bhai, you’re absolutely right.He always resorts to personal attacks — be it on someone’s family or their religion. Class and decency clearly aren’t his strengths,” Kaneria wrote while sharing the interview clip.Pathan also recalled off-field flashpoints, including a fiery mid-air spat during India’s 2006 tour of Pakistan. “Afridi came and placed his hand on my head, messing up my hair. He asked me, ‘How are you kid?’ I said, ‘Since when have you become my father?’… Later, I told him, ‘He has eaten dog meat, he has been barking for a long time.’ After that, he couldn’t reply.”For Pathan, Afridi’s taunts only served as fuel. “On the field, my performances were the perfect answer. I showed him who the real Pathan is.”Kaneria’s intervention has reignited an already fiery debate, bringing back to spotlight one of cricket’s most infamous rivalries.","Former pakistan leg-spinner danish kaneria has stirred fresh controversy by backing irfan pathan ’s explosive revelations about his long-standing rivalry with shahid afridi.

Arjun Tendulkar, son of cricket icon Sachin Tendulkar, is all set to begin a new chapter in his personal life. The 25-year-old has reportedly got engaged to Sanniya Chandhok, 26, on August 13, 2025.The age gap between the couple, a little over a year, has already drawn attention because it mirrors Sachin Tendulkar’s own marriage.The Master Blaster tied the knot with Anjali in 1995, despite her being five years older.Sachin was born on April 24, 1973, while Anjali was born on November 10, 1967. Their relationship, and enduring bond, was once seen as unconventional but soon became one of Indian cricket’s most admired partnerships.Arjun, born on September 24, 1999, has been steadily carving out his career in cricket.A left-arm pacer and lower-order batter, he made his IPL debut for Mumbai Indians in 2023. While his career is still in its early stages, his personal life has already taken a decisive turn with his engagement.Sanniya Chandhok, born on June 23, 1998, is a year older than Arjun.Reports suggest the couple celebrated their engagement in a private ceremony attended by close friends and family.Interestingly, Arjun himself is younger than his sister Sara Tendulkar, who is two years older, making the age dynamic within the family a familiar one.Much like his father, Arjun seems unfazed by societal expectations around age gaps in relationships.The Tendulkar family, long admired for its grounded approach to fame, appears set to welcome a new member with warmth and celebration.As Arjun balances the demands of cricket and prepares for a new phase off the field, the parallel with Sachin’s own life journey is hard to miss.Once again, a Tendulkar son seems ready to walk in his father’s footsteps, this time, in love.","Arjun tendulkar has reportedly got engaged to sanniya chandhok.

Poll Which player from the Class of 2023 do you think will be missed the most in the 2025 squad? Rohit Sharma Virat Kohli Ravindra Jadeja

NEW DELHI: With the Indian selectors expected to unveil the squad for the Asia Cup 2025 on Tuesday, August 19, speculation is mounting over who will make the cut for the continental T20I event. India, placed in Group A alongside Pakistan, UAE, and Oman, will feature in the tournament scheduled in the UAE from September 9–28.This edition will be played in the T20I format, aligning with the T20 World Cup cycle next year. The last edition in 2023, however, was an ODI competition jointly hosted by Pakistan and Sri Lanka. That squad, led by Rohit Sharma, lifted the trophy, but much has changed in the two years since.From the Class of 2023, three stalwarts — Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, and Ravindra Jadeja — have retired from T20Is, drawing curtains on their illustrious careers in the shortest format. Their absence has created both a leadership vacuum and opportunities for the next generation.Several others who featured two years ago have drifted away from India's T20 set-up. Ishan Kishan, Prasidh Krishna, Mohammed Shami, and Shardul Thakur have not been part of the scheme in recent times, either due to form, fitness, or selection dynamics.That leaves a solid core of players still very much in contention for the Class of 2025. Suryakumar Yadav , now India's T20I captain, heads the list, with Hardik Pandya , Jasprit Bumrah, and Shubman Gill expected to play central roles. Shreyas Iyer, Axar Patel, KL Rahul, Mohammed Siraj, Washington Sundar, Tilak Varma, and Kuldeep Yadav also remain in the selectors' consideration.The key talking point, however, is how many of these 2023 squad members will survive the transition. The rise of youngsters like Yashasvi Jaiswal, Rinku Singh, and Jitesh Sharma has made competition stiffer, while experienced hands such as Pandya and Bumrah provide balance.As the BCCI gears up for the announcement, the focus will be on continuity versus fresh blood. For now, the question lingers: who from the Class of 2023 will carry forward India's challenge in the Class of 2025?","Rohit sharma, virat kohli, and ravindra jadeja have retired from t20is.

Poll Do you think Vanessa Bryant handled the pregnancy rumors well? Yes, very cleverly No, she should have addressed them directly

Met Gala Surprise: Rihanna Stuns With Baby Bump Reveal, A$AP Rocky Confirms It’s Baby No 3

After days of unrelenting speculation, Vanessa Bryant took to Instagram Stories on Sunday, June 1, to put the rumors to rest. Her response wasn’t a press statement or a legal warning, it was a wild meme with a big middle finger to the internet trolls. The meme featured music icon Rihanna floating in water with a snorkel mask on her head, holding a drink, and flipping her middle finger.“Me protecting my peace, not pregnant & having fun all summer,” Vanessa Bryant wrote in the caption on her response to the online trolls who spread her pregnancy rumors about five years after her husband, Kobe Bryant ’s, untimely and devastating demise.It was clear, clever, and vintage Vanessa who shut down noise without saying a word about the origin of the gossip. No press release needed when you’ve got Rihanna energy with a direct middle finger gesture.The rumors had emerged out of nowhere, with some users pointing to photos allegedly showing a ""baby bump,"" though no timestamps or context were attached to those images. Vanessa hasn't been publicly linked to anyone romantically, and there’s been zero confirmation from her side—until now.In another Instagram Story later that evening, Vanessa shared a motivational quote that hinted at how she views the entire situation and what matters to her personally.“The only way to impress me, is by being a good person,” the quote read. “I don’t care what you have, what you wear, where you live, or what you drive. I just have deep respect for people with pure hearts and good intentions.”Adding one final touch to her trilogy of clapbacks, she posted another Rihanna meme, this one stating, “I’m not mean, I’m just not the one.”With the classic Rihanna memes, Vanessa showed that she is busy being a proud mom to her daughters while being the powerhouse of her business ventures. While she does not care about the rumor mill, her reaction explicitly showed that she is urging privacy.Vanessa Bryant, who shares four daughters with Kobe— Natalia, Bianka, Capri, and the late Gianna— has remained devoted to family and philanthropy. Most recently, she shared footage of a joyful family ski trip over the holidays, showing the tight-knit bond she maintains with her children.Natalia Bryant stepped into the fashion world just like her mother, officially joining IMG Models in 2021 at the age of 18. “Ever since I can remember, I wanted to model,” she shared in a statement posted by IMG on Instagram. “There is a lot to learn, but I feel this is a great opportunity for me to learn and express myself creatively.”Vanessa and Kobe Bryant tied the knot in April 2001. Tragically, in January 2020, Kobe and their 13-year-old daughter Gianna lost their lives in a helicopter crash that also killed seven others. They were headed to Kobe’s Mamba Sports Academy for a youth basketball game when the accident occurred. Kobe was 41 at the time. The loss shook the sports world and left a lasting impact on fans, friends, and loved ones across the globe. Kobe has left a huge legacy to his name as well, he is considered one the of the elite NBA superstars of all time with astounding stats, records and intense playmaking abilities. His demise created a huge void in the NBA world as fans are still mourning his untimely passing.Since their passing, she’s kept their memory alive through meaningful business ventures and charitable work. Kobe launched the Mamba Sports Foundation in 2016, aiming to support young athletes. After his death, Vanessa renamed it the Mamba & Mambacita Sports Foundation in honor of both Kobe and Gianna. Today, the foundation helps underserved boys and girls in sports, pushing forward the mission they believed in. It's her way of carrying on their legacy with purpose and heart.Vanessa Bryant’s response was indeed witty and empowering as she hinted that she deserves privacy and reminded the world that while she may be a public figure, her peace and dignity aren’t up for debate, especially not over unfounded gossip. After the viral response via memes, Vanessa has seemingly closed the chapter as she did not extend the matter any further with any other comments about it afterwards.Days after shutting down the pregnancy rumor, Vanessa Bryant made a glowing courtside appearance with her daughters at the New York Liberty vs. Chicago Sky game. The WNBA shared a sweet clip showing Vanessa alongside Natalia, 22, Bianka, 8, and Capri, 5, all smiling and waving for the camera.Later, Vanessa uploaded an image of her in a restaurant, candidly posing as she waited for the food to be arrive. Considering the dress, it appears that the photograph was shot after her recent attendance in the game.Their family moment quickly caught fans’ attention online, adding a warm highlight to the evening. It was a rare and heartwarming public outing for the Bryant family, showing their strong support for women’s basketball. It was Vanessa's first public outing since she debunked the horrendous pregnancy rumors.Recently, Vanessa honored her husband Kobe's memory with a heartfelt Instagram post on Instagram, sharing a throwback photograph of the family with the NBA legend, ""Happy Fathers Day @kobebryant 💕 You are so missed. We love you so much. #GirlDad 💕💕""Earlier this July, Vanessa Bryant added another heartfelt moment to her social media with a birthday post for her sister, Sophie. The sweet throwback photo featured Vanessa, her late husband Kobe Bryant, and Sophie together, smiling during happier times. It comes after several touching family updates, including daughter Natalia’s recent USC graduation and emotional tribute to her dad.As for her fortune, Vanessa's net worth has seen major growth over the years. While Kobe Bryant’s NBA success helped build their fortune, Vanessa carved her own path, too. She’s earned recognition as a model, businesswoman, and philanthropist, adding to her wealth through years of steady work.As of 2025, her estimated net worth is $600 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth. A large portion of that came from Kobe’s estate, after his tragic passing in 2020. At the time, Forbes valued the Lakers legend’s net worth at $600 million.Vanessa Bryant just shared a sweet throwback-inspired moment that melted hearts online. Her youngest daughter, Capri, recreated one of Kobe Bryant’s most iconic photos from 1999—wearing a cast and pajamas just like her dad did after a wrist injury. Vanessa captioned the photo, “Like father, like daughter. 💜 Capri Kobe Bryant 💜 #BabyMamba #KokoBean 💜💛🐍,” reminding fans how Kobe’s spirit lives on through their kids. From raising her children to keeping Kobe's memory alive, Vanessa has been an example of love and a remarkable parent. Also, there is no report of her seeing anyone as she remains loyal to her beloved husband Kobe, cherishing his legacy with their kids.Vanessa Bryant’s newest tribute arrives just months after she shared memories from a snowy holiday getaway with her daughters. Last December, she posted sweet moments on Instagram— showing the girls toasting marshmallows and skiing through the snow. Little Capri even shared a carousel ride with Vanessa, making the winter trip extra special.Additionally, Vanessa Bryant also grabs headlines for her friendship with several celebrities including Ciara, she often comments and likes the posts of her friends on social media. As of now, Vanessa is keeping a low profile about her personal life like always.Recently, Vanessa Bryant touched hearts with a heartfelt tribute to Kobe Bryant, joined by daughters Natalia, Bianka, and Capri during the Dodgers’ Bobblehead Night. She shared sweet photos from the emotional occasion, and her Instagram post celebrating Kobe Bryant’s legacy quickly drew an outpouring of love from fans. Certainly, Vanessa has been a proud mother with strong bonding with her kids.Recently, They partnered with @baby2baby and their Angel, @vanessabryant, to take part in a special Back-to-School Celebration for the incredible students of Ninth Street Elementary in Los Angeles.

Auston Matthews’ health in spotlight ahead of season opener



Why Auston Matthews’ form is crucial to the Leafs’ ambitions



With October 8 approaching, the Toronto Maple Leafs face a cloud of uncertainty surrounding their captain, Auston Matthews. The team’s offensive heartbeat is still under scrutiny as whispers about his health grow louder. A season opener against the Montreal Canadiens is no small stage, and Matthews’ readiness could very well determine whether Toronto begins with a statement or a stumble.Auston Matthews, who battled injuries and saw a noticeable dip in his goal-scoring last season, enters this year with more questions than answers. TSN’s Overdrive didn’t mince words when discussing the situation: “We don’t know what his health situation is. The idea he is going to be fully healthy is a big question mark. He’ll say it when he arrives but I’ll believe it when I see it.”Adding to the challenge is the absence of Mitch Marner, his long-time partner in offensive crime. Marner’s fingerprints were on half of Matthews’ regular-season goals and 60% of his playoff tallies last season — a partnership that has been instrumental in making Toronto’s top line one of the most feared in the NHL.Without Marner, the pressure on Matthews to generate his own scoring chances intensifies.If Matthews isn’t at full strength, Toronto may need to reshuffle quickly. Max Domi is the likely candidate to fill Marner’s spot on the wing, but banking on Domi as a top-line fixture through an entire season — and deep into the playoffs — is far from a sure bet. This uncertainty could push general manager Brad Treliving to explore the market for another top-six forward capable of providing both creativity and finishing touch.Last season told a mixed story. Auston Matthews suited up for 67 games, producing 78 points (33 goals, 45 assists). While impressive by most standards, it was a significant step back from his jaw-dropping 69-goal campaign the year prior. That drop-off, combined with lingering injury concerns, has fueled speculation about whether he can return to peak dominance.For Toronto, the stakes couldn’t be clearer: an in-form Auston Matthews is non-negotiable if the team hopes to contend. His health directly impacts the offense’s rhythm, the power play’s potency, and the confidence of the locker room. Meanwhile, Matthews carries a $13.25 million cap hit and holds a full no-movement clause (NMC), giving him complete control over any potential trade.Amidst all these health update, Sens captain Brady Tkachuk said some things good about Auston Matthews. “I’ve known Auston since I think I was 14 or 15,” Tkachuk said. “And he’s always been so good, and he’s just so funny and such a great guy to be around.” “It was pretty awesome for me to be able to learn from him as a captain, and what makes him himself,” Tkachuk added. “And of course, one of the best players in the NHL.""The countdown to October 8 is ticking fast. For the Maple Leafs, the question isn’t just whether Auston Matthews will be in the lineup — it’s whether he’ll be ready to lead from the first puck drop.Also Read: NHL Trade Rumors: Connor McDavid-style contract tension reportedly brewing for Winnipeg Jets","Auston matthews’ health in spotlight ahead of season opener with toronto maple leafs.

Craig Berube doesn’t trust Nick Robertson; Maple Leafs $1.82M settlement sparks NHL trade rumors,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/craig-berube-doesnt-trust-nick-robertson-maple-leafs-1-82m-settlement-sparks-nhl-trade-rumors/articleshow/123364642.cms,"Nick Robertson’s role with Leafs remains in doubt (Image via: Getty Images)

Why Nick Robertson struggles to fit in Craig Berube’s Maple Leafs system



Maple Leafs re-sign Nick Robertson to a one-year, $1.825M deal! | Instant Analysis

Why Nick Robertson’s goal-scoring doesn’t guarantee him a role with Maple Leafs



The Toronto Maple Leafs have settled with Nick Robertson on a one-year, $1.82 million deal for the 2025-26 season, avoiding arbitration. But the contract has done little to silence speculation about his future. With Toronto reshaping its roster under new head coach Craig Berube, Robertson looks more like a trade chip than a long-term fit.Toronto’s message has been consistent since Berube’s arrival: the Leafs want to change their “DNA.” After nine straight years of postseason exits before the Conference Finals, the organization has embraced a tougher, more physical style of play. Additions like Mattias Macelli and Nicolas Roy are expected to replace Mitch Marner’s offensive production, while Scott Laughton and Dakota Joshua bring grit to the fourth line. Depth forwards David Kampf and Henry Thrun remain options, and prospect Easton Cowan is pushing for a full-time role.In this new structure, Robertson’s profile doesn’t stand out. The 23-year-old winger offers pace and scoring ability but lacks size and physicality, qualities Berube values highly. As analyst Michael Amato noted in his Sportsnet column, it’s “hard to imagine Robertson working his way into head coach Craig Berube’s list of trusted players.”That lack of trust was evident last postseason, where Robertson played just three of Toronto’s 13 playoff games and was often a healthy scratch.Robertson’s numbers suggest untapped potential. He scored 15 goals last season, though 11 came against non-playoff teams, raising questions about his consistency against tougher opponents. Still, his back-to-back campaigns scoring at a 20-goal pace make him an attractive option for clubs seeking middle-six scoring. For a team struggling offensively, Robertson’s speed and shooting could be a bargain at $1.82 million.Elliotte Friedman’s 32 Thoughts podcast pointed to a possible move, while Sports Illustrated’s Jacob Punturi named the Chicago Blackhawks, Detroit Red Wings, and Pittsburgh Penguins as logical suitors. Chicago could use him alongside Connor Bedard, Detroit continues to add skill under Steve Yzerman, and Pittsburgh needs affordable scoring to support Sidney Crosby’s final years.Also Read: Connor McDavid and Lauren Kyle’s Muskoka weekend: Inside their Ontario lakeside getaway For Toronto, Robertson may be the casualty of a culture shift.

Jason Brown calls Caleb Williams “gay” as fans pile on with roast reactions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/jason-brown-calls-caleb-williams-gay-as-fans-pile-on-with-roast-reactions/articleshow/123365818.cms,"(Image via Getty Images: Caleb Williams)

Jason Brown calls Caleb Williams “gay” over silver nail polish

“Gay.”

Fans react with pure trolling energy



The NFL preseason gave us a little unexpected drama off the field, and it had nothing to do with a touchdown. Bears rookie QB Caleb Williams showed up rocking silver nail polish before the game. The reporter tweeted about it, noting that fans believed the color was symbolic, silver nails for the silver Lombardi Trophy. But instead of joining in on the hype, Jason Brown jumped into the conversation with a one-word reply that sent the internet spiraling.According to fans, the silver was a symbolic nod to his ultimate goal — the Lombardi Trophy. But instead of celebrating the gesture, Jason Brown jumped into the conversation with a one-word reaction that immediately set the internet on fire:That’s it. One word, but enough to hijack the whole conversation.For context, Jason Brown isn’t new to stirring the pot. He has a reputation for blunt takes and online shock value, which makes his remark unsurprising but it doesn’t mean fans let it slide. Instead of piling on Caleb Williams, the replies quickly flipped against Brown himself.Most of the reactions weren’t serious debates, they were straight-up roast sessions.Fans turned Brown’s comment back on him, mocking how he always finds a way to stay relevant.Instead of anyone questioning Caleb’s style choice, the overwhelming majority of fans just laughed at Brown.Caleb Williams didn’t address the post and probably won’t. For him, silver polish is just another extension of the same personal style he showed at USC. What started as a symbolic gesture from Caleb Williams ended up becoming another Jason Brown controversy. But unlike his coaching days, this time the coach didn’t control the play.Beyond the viral exchange, this moment feeds into a bigger shift in the NFL. Younger stars like Caleb Williams are embracing individuality whether it’s nail polish, jewelry, or bold fashion fits before games. While some “old-school” voices like Jason Brown clearly don’t approve, the new era of athletes sees self-expression as part of their brand and confidence.Also read - “No skips”: Zoë Kravitz raves about Taylor Swift’s 'The Life of a Showgirl' album revealed on Travis Kelce’s New Heights podcast","Bears rookie qb caleb williams showed up rocking silver nail polish before the game.

Spencer Rattler stuns NFL preseason as Saints’ quarterback battle turns into a redemption drama,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/spencer-rattler-stuns-nfl-preseason-as-saints-quarterback-battle-turns-into-a-redemption-drama/articleshow/123366253.cms,"Spencer Rattler's preseason spark keeps the Saints' QB race wide open (Image credits: IG/X)

Tyler Shough vs. Spencer Rattler: More than a battle

Why the city feels his fight

Spencer Rattler’s journey has never followed a straight line. Once crowned the future of college football, then benched and forgotten, the quarterback now finds himself at the heart of the New Orleans Saints’ most dramatic storyline. His preseason performances—flawed yet fearless—have reignited a debate about whether the former high school prodigy can finally turn his career into the redemption saga he has been chasing for years.Rattler entered Oklahoma with superstar billing, the kind of recruit who graced magazine covers before throwing an NFL pass. But college football’s spotlight is unforgiving. After a promising start, his stumbles cost him the Sooners’ starting job and his reputation as a sure-fire first-rounder.Transferring to South Carolina gave him a second chance. There, he stitched together gritty performances, silencing doubters with a late-season surge that proved he wasn’t done. The Saints noticed enough to draft him in the fifth round of 2024, a quiet nod that his story wasn’t over yet.When Derek Carr’s injury pushed Rattler into the spotlight last fall, the rookie did not flinch. In seven appearances—six of them starts—he logged 1,317 passing yards, four touchdowns, and five interceptions.The numbers carried blemishes, but he set a franchise rookie record for passing yards, an achievement that carried weight inside the locker room.Head coach Dennis Allen later reflected, “He got thrown into the fire, and he didn’t shrink. That matters in this league.” Those moments, however, were just the opening notes of a longer symphony Rattler is still learning to conduct.The 2025 preseason has transformed Rattler from placeholder to headline. Against Jacksonville, he entered late, fired a 20-yard touchdown to Dante Pettis, then bulldozed into the end zone himself for a two-point conversion that secured a 17–17 tie. He closed with 199 passing yards, one touchdown, and one interception—stats that hinted at chaos but also courage.“Spence doesn’t play safe, he plays bold,” Pettis said after the game. “That’s the kind of quarterback guys rally around.” In a city that thrives on resilience, Rattler’s brand of daring has begun to resonate with fans who crave fight as much as finesse.The Saints’ quarterback competition has become more than a depth chart dispute. Tyler Shough, a rookie with polish and pedigree, has shown consistency in his early preseason snaps. Yet Rattler’s story drips with something less tangible but equally powerful—edge. He embodies the athlete who has been knocked down and refuses to stay there.Analysts note that both quarterbacks bring different flavors: Shough’s structure versus Rattler’s improvisation. For New Orleans, the decision could shape not only the offense but the team’s identity moving forward.New Orleans has always embraced fighters, from storm survivors to street musicians improvising against the odds. In Rattler, fans see a mirror of that spirit—someone who was written off but refuses to fade. Whether he wins the starting job or not, he has already reminded the league that his story is far from finished.The preseason may be a proving ground, but for Spencer Rattler, it feels like destiny calling again—louder, sharper, and impossible to ignore.Also read: Joe Milton’s inaccuracy is silently wrecking Dallas Cowboys receivers’ roster chances","Spencer rattler entered oklahoma with superstar billing, the kind of recruit who graced magazine covers before throwing an nfl pass.

What’s Next for Cunningham?

guardwent down with a painful right knee injury during Sunday’s clash with the Connecticut Sun on August 17, 2025. The scary moment, which unfolded midway through the second quarter, has left Fever fans and the wider basketball community anxiously awaiting clarity on her condition. Sophie Cunningham came down with an injury when Sun guard Bria Hartley drove hard toward the basket. Cunningham stepped in to help defensively, but Hartley lost her balance and tumbled into her, landing directly on Cunningham’s right knee.Cunningham immediately fell to the floor in visible agony, clutching her leg and unable to stand. Fever trainers rushed to her side before she was helped off the court and officially ruled out for the rest of the game.Head coach Stephanie White summed up the moment bluntly: “I’m like, ‘Holy s—’…how much pain she was in…it’s like, crap.”The timing couldn’t be worse for Indiana. The Indiana Fever are already battling through a wave of injuries, including the absence of rookie sensation Caitlin Clark and other key players. Cunningham has been a steady presence, averaging nearly 26 minutes per game with 89 points and 36 rebounds this season.Her departure forced the Fever to dig deeper into an already thin rotation, raising questions about how they will navigate the next stretch of their schedule.The team confirmed Sophie Cunningham would undergo an MRI to assess the severity of the injury. While early talk points to a possible knee sprain, no timeline can be set until test results are back.The moment sparked an outpouring of emotions online. Cunningham’s sister, Lindsey, openly criticized the officiating, calling for stronger player safety standards. Fans echoed those frustrations, pointing fingers at referees and expressing concern for Sophie’s health.One supporter captured the mood of many:“Yeah, I’m out. No reason left to watch this team anymore then. Terrible basketball. Healing thoughts to Sophie. She’s the only one that seemed to play with any heart anymore.”The response underlined Cunningham’s reputation as a passionate competitor who has become a fan favorite in Indiana.As of August 18, Sophie Cunningham is scheduled for an MRI to determine the exact nature of the knee injury. If it turns out to be a mild sprain, there’s optimism she could return within weeks - potentially before the Indiana Fever’s crucial August 23 matchup against the Minnesota Lynx.But if scans reveal something more serious, Cunningham’s absence could extend into the postseason, dealing a huge blow to Indiana’s playoff hopes. With the Fever hanging on to a postseason spot, her health could very well determine how deep the team goes.Until results come in, the Indiana Fever must push forward without one of their toughest leaders on the floor.

Cam Heyward holds in during training camp as veteran Steelers players seek new deals

Chris Boswell, the Pittsburgh Steelers’ veteran kicker, has ended his hold-in and returned to the field during the team’s preseason game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Saturday, August 16, 2025. This move comes after weeks of speculation regarding his contract status. With 41 field goals made in 2024, leading the NFL , Boswell is starting his 11th season with the Steelers under contract until 2026. Boswell's contract, signed in 2022, puts him outside the top ten highest-paid kickers in the league, even if he had an amazing performance last season.Chris Boswell started the game and also after a touchdown by teammate Brandon Johnson in the preseason game against the Buccaneers. His presence on the field shows his preparedness for the coming season, even though he didn't try a field goal in this game.Clearly indicating his desire for a contract correction, Chris Boswell's hold-in approach, where a player attends team events but abstains from games or practice, was a clear sign.His performance in 2024, converting 41 of 44 field goals and all 35 extra points, earned him his second Pro Bowl selection and first-team All-Pro honors.Also Read: “Just don’t be Travis Hunter”: Dennis Rodman slams NFL star’s controversial relationship with wife Leanna Lenee One Steelers veteran, Chris Boswell, is negotiating his contract.

Should his contract circumstances not be resolved, he has indicated he will miss regular-season games.The circumstances of both Boswell and Heyward show the difficulties seasoned players confront when their performance exceeds their remuneration.

Battlefield 6 open beta has just ended yesterday, but it ended with absolute bang. This whole beta phase was able to notch up a mammoth player count of over half-a-million players, which is absolutely astounding for a beta version.It’s quite true that the past two weekends have been totally devoted to Battlefield 6, and it will be hard for many to move on from that as this game will only be playable again on and after October 10, 2025, when the game gets fully released. However, there are really some pretty great FPS games for you to play until Battlefield 6 gets released to quench your thirst. Here are the five of them:Valorant is a completely different game from Battlefield 6, with only the “FPS” tag common in both. The gunplay mechanism is also way contrasting between these two titles, but there is a reason Valorant is in this list.With over 25 distinct agents and unique abilities of each one, scattered in four different categories, this tactical 5v5 shooter is undoubtedly one of the most played games right now. Just like CS2, two teams collide each other on taking control of map sites, one restricting another one from destroying the sites by detonating a bomb called Spike.Another exciting FPS title but breaking the military-style barrier, Apex Legends is one of most popular games in the world right now. The game features a huge array of characters with each having different abilities.Not only that, Apex Legends is based on a futuristic setting, that means everything around you - maps, buildings, weapons, vehicles - are going to be ultra modern and exciting to access.Delta Force is the reincarnation of the classic title which came over two decades ago. The game is already available on PCs and is releasing on consoles on August 19, 2025. This is a free-to-play FPS title with extraction-based 3v3v3 game modes.Those who really like realistic military simulators, are definitely going to fall in love with this game as well because Delta Force holds a heavy and serious gameplay vibe, which is the core concept of the Battlefield franchise since day one.Its inclusion might surprise many fans keeping in mind Battlefield 2042 might be the worst installment of this iconic franchise. However, as Battlefield 6 open beta just ended, DICE has incorporated some great new content in Battlefield 2042 to hook the players with this game.BF2042 has recently received a sudden update which brought so many fan favorite aspects like the Lynx Sniper Rifle, the SU-25TM Frogfoot and many more. Not only that, the premium Battle Pass in BF2042 is absolutely free now.There is no doubt that Call of Duty Black Ops 6 and Warzone is at the no 1 spot in the list. It’s has been a long-standing battle between Call of Duty and Battlefield 6 over the debate of which one is better.As the release date of Black Ops 7 is also seemingly falling just after Battlefield 6, we are really up for another mouth-watering battle. Then, why not try out Black Ops 6 before the release of BF6, as it features everything - a great Campaign, thrilling Multiplayer modes and breath-taking Zombies.","Battlefield 6 open beta has just ended yesterday, but it ended with absolute bang.
