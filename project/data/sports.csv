Lack of proper planning by event organizers Inadequate crowd control by authorities





BENAGLURU: The Karnataka government has held the management of the Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) responsible for the deadly stampede that claimed 11 lives outside the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium on 4 June.In a status report submitted to the High Court, the state said the RCB management, along with its event partner M/s DNA Networks Private Limited and the Karnataka State Cricket Association (KSCA), “unilaterally decided to hold the victory celebration without prior consultation with the police and without obtaining the necessary permissions or licence for such celebrations.”The report, dated 12 June, was ordered to be disclosed by the High Court in its order on 8 July.The government also noted that the RCB had posted a video clip of cricketer Virat Kohli as part of its promotions for the parade and celebrations.According to the report, on 3 June at around 6:30pm, the CEO of KSCA submitted an intimation on behalf of DNA Networks to the Inspector of Police at Cubbon Park Police Station. The letter stated that if RCB were to win the IPL final that evening in Ahmedabad against PBKS, the team intended to organise a victory parade around the stadium.However, the police denied the request due to “insufficient information regarding the expected gathering size, arrangements made, possible bottlenecks, and the like, as well as the proposal being made on very short notice,” the report stated.Despite this, the next morning at 7.01am on 4 June, RCB posted an invitation on its official social media platforms announcing a victory parade from Vidhana Soudha to Chinnaswamy Stadium. A second post at 8.00am reiterated the same message.At 8.55am, RCB posted a video featuring Virat Kohli on its official handle @RCBtweets, in which he said the team “intends to celebrate this victory with the people of Bengaluru and RCB fans on 04.06.2025 after the team returns to Bengaluru.”Later, at 3:14pm, another post was made announcing the timing of the parade—from 5:00pm to 6:00pm—followed by celebrations inside the stadium. It was only in this post that RCB mentioned limited free passes were available at shop.royalchallengers.com.By then, however, crowds had already gathered in large numbers, the report stated. The government also noted the huge online engagement with these posts, with the first receiving 16 lakh views, the second 4.26 lakh views, the third 7.6 lakh, and the final one 17 lakh views.“It is pertinent to note that a mere intimation was given by the organisers; there was no requisition for permissions in the prescribed format, nor was any necessary information provided to the concerned departments to anticipate the gathering and make adequate preparations,” the report added.The state cited the Licensing and Controlling of Assemblies and Processions (Bangalore City) Order, 2009, to underscore the procedural violations.","The karnataka government has held the management of the royal challengers bengaluru responsible for the deadly stampede that claimed 11 lives on 4 june.

Rob Gronkowski, former tight end for the New England Patriots, recently talked about the Patriots’ newest head coach, Mike Vrabel, with Jamie Erdahl, host of Good Morning Football on NFL Network. Gronkowski said Vrabel had done an excellent job till now–both in free agency and in the 2025 NFL Draft. The retired tight end has no questions about any of his offseason moves. All that’s left now is to see if Vrabel can bring the team together and win games.Gronkowski also hinted that the Patriots may sign another player before the trade deadline. Why? Because they have 50-60 million dollars left in spending. Albert Breer, Senior NFL Reporter, recently shared that the Patriots would be very interested in signing wide receiver Terry McLaurin. McLaurin–whose contract talks are still not happening with the Washington Commanders. Before we jump to any conclusions, let’s go back to our first topic of discussion–what exactly did Rob Gronkowski say about HC Mike Vrabel?The 36-year-old NFL Analyst shared with Good Morning Football host Jamie Erdahl, “As far as I think, Mike Vrabel is doing an excellent job so far. You really can’t question any of the moves that he has done this year in free agency and in the draft. I think they smacked it out of the park. What we’ve really gotta see now is how coach Vrabel can bring this team together so they can have that chemistry to go out and play together as a team.Go out there and win games. Possibly have a shot at making the playoffs and winning the division. And if not winning the division, at least getting a wild card, so they can compete in the playoffs.That’s what he has to do. He has to bring this team together–because all the moves in the offseason have been done in the draft and free agency. He’s been doing such a great job. You can’t really question him yet, and you’ve gotta just see how he does once the season hits. ”The NFL Analyst for FOX Sports further said that the Patriots may sign a player before the 2025 NFL Trade deadline. Gronkowski did not hint at Terry McLaurin directly, but mentioned the exact money left in spending. He gave some other clues too. The retired tight end said, “Maybe they’re gonna make another splash before the trade deadline because they have about 50-60 million dollars left in spending. So maybe they’re gonna go out and make a trade to amp up a position they need progress at, throughout the season. ”Albert Breer talked about Washington Commanders wide receiver Terry McLaurin on NBC Sports Boston’s “Early Edition” on Wednesday night. Breer said, “I think the Patriots would be very interested in this. Now, there’s a price point for all of it. What would that mean? Obviously, he’s not going to come here with an unresolved contract situation, so you’d be talking about a draft pick plus a contract. But certainly as far as what they’re looking from a person, as a player, helping Drake Maye–this guy checks every box. ” –Rob Gronkowski mentioned earlier that the Patriots are looking for a player that can amp-up a position they need progress at - amp up quarterback Drake Maye?

Themade headlines early in the 2025 offseason by signingto a two-year, $12 million contract. While the move initially raised eyebrows, it has since drawn sharper criticism, with many insiders now placing the deal among the offseason’s most puzzling signings. With analysts divided, the discussion around LaRavia’s value and fit in LA continues to grow louder.At 23, Jake LaRavia has already bounced between several NBA franchises. Originally the 19th overall pick in 2022 by the Timberwolves , he was immediately traded to Memphis and later moved again to Sacramento before entering free agency this summer. He’s long been considered a prototypical “3-and-D” wing—a role modern NBA teams highly prize.During the 2024–25 season, split between the Grizzlies and Kings, LaRavia posted:- 66 appearances- 6.9 points, 3.9 rebounds, and 2.4 assists per game- An efficient 47.5% field goal shooting, including 42.3% from beyond the arcDespite these solid shooting splits, Jake LaRavia hasn’t yet established himself as a regular starter or high-impact contributor.The Los Angeles Lakers made LaRavia their first major free agent signing, handing him a fully guaranteed two-year deal worth $12 million—slightly above the taxpayer mid-level exception.That contract immediately triggered a hard cap for LA, significantly tightening their financial flexibility.This move also filled the roster spot vacated by Dorian Finney-Smith, who left for Houston on a four-year, $53 million deal. While Finney-Smith brought more experience and defensive pedigree, the Los Angeles Lakers opted for youth and upside.However, several league executives and commentators have ranked LaRavia’s deal among the least valuable of the summer, criticizing the contract’s size relative to the player’s career output.- Overpay for a Role Player: Critics say $6 million annually is too much for someone who has yet to prove himself as more than a rotational piece.- Cap Space Consequences: Triggering the hard cap for a relatively unproven player has many questioning the Los Angeles Lakers’ cap management strategy.- Better Alternatives Ignored: Some analysts argue that more experienced, playoff-tested wings were available at comparable or even lower price tags.A Western Conference executive summed it up bluntly: “The Lakers may have paid top dollar for a player best suited as an eighth or ninth man on a contender, rather than a key contributor.”And another insider noted: “It’s a classic gamble on upside, but the cost could handcuff LA’s front office if LaRavia fails to break out next season.”Despite criticism, LA sees significant potential in Jake LaRavia. His youth, size, and ability to knock down threes offer qualities the front office values under new head coach JJ Redick.Rob Pelinka, Los Angeles Lakers president of basketball operations, defended the move: “Jake is a high-IQ two-way player… We think Jake has significant basketball upside, which will be honed nicely in our Lakers basketball development program.”From a team-building standpoint, LaRavia helps address two long-standing issues: three-point shooting and defensive versatility. At just 23, the Lakers believe there’s plenty of room for growth—and they’re betting he’ll flourish in their system.To better understand the skepticism, here’s how LaRavia stacks up against similar players signed this offseason:While Jake LaRavia boasts a better shooting percentage than both Finney-Smith and Reddish, his overall production and impact still leave much to be desired.Also read: Damian Lillard Returns to Portland Trail Blazers on Three-Year, $42 Million Deal Featuring No-Trade Clause The Los Angeles Lakers’ acquisition of Jake LaRavia is a high-stakes play on future development. With limited experience but promising shooting, he could emerge as a key floor-spacer in Redick’s system—or end up as a costly misfire that limits LA’s options moving forward. Whether this deal becomes a savvy investment or a cautionary tale in cap management will depend entirely on LaRavia’s growth in the seasons ahead. For now, the spotlight is firmly on him as one of the most debated contracts of the summer.","Jake laravia has agreed to a two-year, $12 million contract with the los angeles lakers.

The American League jumped ahead early in the swing-off, with Brent Rooker, Kyle Stowers, and Randy Arozarena hitting three home runs, making the score 3-1 for the AL.Then came Schwarber's moment. With the fans roaring and his teammates cheering him on, he stepped up and put on a stunning display. Schwarber hit three back-to-back home runs on his three swings, measuring 428 feet, 461 feet, and 382 feet, flipping the score to 4-3 in favor of the National League.""It was incredible,"" Schwarber said to reporters. “The guys were really into it. They were yelling, screaming, cheering me on every swing. When that last one goes over, they were all pumped. It was a lot of fun.”Jonathan Aranda, the final batter for the American League and a player for the Tampa Bay Rays, was unable to match Schwarber's hitting power, missing out on a home run. Meanwhile, Pete Alonso, who was supposed to bat next for the National League, didn't even need to step up to the plate—the game had already ended, and Schwarber had taken the victory.Philadelphia Phillies fans gave all sorts of reaction to their start winning the MVP spot and commented on X, “The MVP crown fits Kyle Schwarber perfectly after that SCHWARBOMB. 👑💣” The Phillies’ official X account echoed the sentiment: “KYLE SCHWARBER IS THE 2025 MLB ALL-STAR GAME MVP! #RingTheBell.”Fans and analysts alike lauded the swing-off format’s debut. One X user wrote, “We needed this swing-off format a decade ago,” while another called it “ELECTRIC.”MLB’s official X account joined in, posting, “The 1st Swing-Off in All-Star Game history was ELECTRIC. Great job, baseball 👏.” While another user commented saying, ""With the MLB's new swing-off format debuting in the 2025 All-Star Game after a 6-6 tie, it’s clear they’ve officially turned the midsummer classic into a home run derby audition""The format’s success has sparked discussions about adopting it in regular-season extra innings, with one fan pleading, “Dear Rob Manfred, replace the ghost runner in extras with a home run swing-off.

Luka Doncic could walk away in 2026 and leave the Los Angeles Lakers

Luka Doncic could rethink after watching the Los Angeles Lakers moving past LeBron James

It looks like the Los Angeles Lakers could be on the verge of losing one of their top talents — Luka Doncic. Rumors are flying that the Slovenian superstar might bail on the team, and this possible exit seems linked to the way the Lakers have managed LeBron James , a legend whose treatment has caused some tension in the organization.Luka Doncic, a remarkable talent hailing from Slovenia, is currently facing a significant moment with the Lakers. He’s in the fourth year of a five-year, $215 million deal that he inked in [insert year], featuring a player option for the 2025-26 season. This means Doncic could potentially become a free agent as early as next summer if he chooses to opt out and forgo an extension.Starting August 2, 2025, Doncic will be eligible to sign a huge four-year, $229 million extension that would keep him with the Lakers until the end of the 2029-30 season. But earlier this offseason, ESPN’s Bobby Marks had a different perspective. He suggested that Doncic might opt for a shorter, three-year contract instead. Why would he do that? This strategy would allow him to renegotiate a year sooner, with 10 years of NBA experience under his belt—a key milestone that raises the maximum contract limit. Marks provided this analysis in an ESPN piece, emphasizing Doncic’s tactical choices.If Doncic decides not to take the extension at all, he might play through the 2025-26 season and then explore free agency next summer. ESPN’s Brian Windhorst highlighted the importance of this — “This is a stress max right now for Luka. The Lakers are a little bit stressed out about it. If he signs it, relief for the Lakers. … If he does not sign it, he can be a free agent next summer when there are going to be 10-plus teams with cap space.” Windhorst pointed out that various teams in the league are going to start making moves to go after Doncic, which puts more pressure on Los Angeles to keep him content.At the center of this drama is LeBron James, the Lakers' seasoned superstar since 2018. James is in the last year of his contract and will be turning 41 in 2025. The Lakers' management has indicated a move towards a future focused on younger players—specifically Doncic. This change, however, has sparked debate about the way James is being treated.Fox Sports’ Nick Wright pointed to this tension on July 16, suggesting the Lakers’ actions could be alienating Doncic. “I think the way the Lakers are not so subtly dissing LeBron James about how excited they are to be done with [him] — I can’t imagine Luka is happy about that,” Wright said on his show. He argued that the franchise’s apparent eagerness to move on from James, a mentor and teammate to Doncic, might erode the younger star’s trust in the organization. Posts on X, like one from [insert handle], echo this sentiment, noting, “LeBron James feels sidelined as Lakers prioritize Luka Doncic in secret meeting amid trade rumors.”Following the Buss family's sale of the Los Angeles Lakers to Mark Walter, the team is prioritizing Luka Doncic as their franchise star. Doncic can sign a 4-year, $229 million extension, while LeBron James' future remains uncertain as the Lakers manage cap space for 2026 signings. LeBron James wasn't aware about the deal between Buss family and Mark Walter but on the other Luka Doncic knew what was going on.LeBron James and Luka Doncic have a solid connection, with the veteran frequently mentoring the younger player both on and off the court. The Lakers not extending James' contract—or at least not giving him the respect that Wright thinks he should get—might be sending a signal to Doncic about how the team views its star players.Also Read: Jalen Williams plans retire his Parents after bagging the $287 million contract and championship season Keeping Doncic isn’t just about having a superstar on the team—it’s about safeguarding their legacy and staying competitive. To make this happen, they’ll have to fix some issues, starting with how they deal with James.","Luka doncic is in the fourth year of a five-year, $215 million deal that he inked in [insert year], featuring a player option for the 2025-26 season.

Jayden Daniels’ mom addressed relationship rumors, fiercely defended son’s personal freedom



Everytime, there's news about Commanders QB Jayden Daniels and any rumored relationship angle, more than him, it is his mom Regina Jackson who steals the show. Daniels' mom, who is very protective about his son and what way his life should take, believes it is all for her son's well-being only. But fans of the QB think otherwise. The same happened when Daniels walked out with USC superstar basketball player JuJu Watkins at her massive birthday party this week.Jayden Daniels and USC basketball star JuJu Watkins have had fans speculating about their relationship for months now, and the latest twist only adds fuel to the fire. Though neither of the two young stars has confirmed anything romantic, the internet can’t help but react—especially when Daniels was spotted at Watkins’ recent birthday bash.What truly sent social media into overdrive wasn’t just Daniels’ appearance but his mom, Regina Jackson, once again sliding into the spotlight. As one fan hilariously put it, “Jayden momma was right behind ’em holding both they hand.” While clearly an exaggeration, it’s not too far from what fans have come to expect from the ever-present Mama Daniels.One fan @TyronMcDaniel commented, ""Bro escaped from his moms grip, she prolly made him wear a wire 🤣🤣🤣"" While another named @rankit4mesports was however got surprised thinking that his mom was not there by saying, ""Surprised Ma Dukes wasn’t there."" A third one named @shubea added, ""Did his mommy approve him being there?""The buzz around the duo started earlier this year during March Madness.Daniels, fresh off being drafted, showed up courtside at a USC game to support Watkins. As he leaned in to chat with her, Jackson made a perfectly timed entrance and sat between them—instantly turning the moment into meme-worthy content.Regina Jackson used her appearance on The Pivot podcast to clear the air around swirling rumors. Her increased visibility—whether courtside with JuJu Watkins or dancing at a wedding—had fans speculating about her involvement in her son’s personal life.But Jackson didn’t hold back. “I’m putting it on record. My son can date, he can live freely, make his own decisions,” she declared. While Daniels values her opinion, she emphasized that it’s rooted in their bond and trust built over years—not control.Addressing the viral “them girls” comment, Jackson clarified it originated from a years-old LSU interview. “It should be every parent’s fear,” she said, adding that public figures like her son face added risks: “You never know who’s really there for you and who’s really against you.”Professionally, Jackson brings more than just maternal instinct. With dual degrees and agent certification, she’s not just qualified—she’s redefining the role of a parent-manager. “He doesn’t know the predators or the vultures… I’m also his mom,” she said.“I had Jayden. Jayden didn’t have me,” Jackson concluded—firmly staking her identity beyond just being an NFL mom.At 24, Daniels is already being looked at as the face of the Commanders’ future. Watkins, meanwhile, is building her own legacy on the hardwood. But every time they’re seen together, it’s Mama Jackson who seems to become the main character.Whether this friendship evolves into something deeper or not, one thing’s for sure—Regina Jackson isn’t going anywhere. And for now, she’s turning every headline about her son’s rumored romance into a family affair.Also Read: “Non-p***y getting male lonelies”: Joy Taylor, Fox Sports now fired host once called for legalized prostitution","Jayden daniels sparks more dating buzz with juju watkins, but it's mama jackson who steals the show again.regina jackson used her appearance on the pivot podcast to clear the air around swirling rumors. “i’m putting it on record.

His agent, Tory Dandy, told general manager Joe Hortiz that Mike Williams, age 30, plans to retire after eight seasons in the NFL.

Buffalo Bills' Josh Allen embraces greener lifestyle with Hailee Steinfeld as new season looms



Josh Allen credits wife Hailee Steinfeld for giving him moral support



Buffalo Bills’ Super Bowl aspirations depend on Josh Allen's leadership— and new mindset



Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen is making a new noise on and off the field in 2025 by eliminating butter and dairy from his diet and creating a disciplined lifestyle with his actress wife, Hailee Steinfeld. Coming off a 2024 NFL MVP-winning season and a very public wedding in May, Josh Allen is zeroed in on his next goal: bringing the Buffalo Bills their first-ever Super Bowl championship.Entering NFL training camp, Josh Allen is demonstrating the same commitment to recovery and nutrition as he does to his game-day performance. During a recent interview with GQ, the Buffalo Bills star announced that he has eliminated butter and dairy from his diet, opting instead for lean proteins and nutrient-dense foods such as sushi in order to remain in top condition.""Honestly, right now, it’s probably the best it’s ever been, partly because I wanted to look good for some recent events in my life.” Josh Allen said.Josh Allen, 29, claims that the adjustments started with preparing for his wedding with Hailee Steinfeld—and he's remained on the routine since. With health and hardware in mind, he has moved toward a lighter meal plan, typically avoiding breakfast and relying on steak, chicken, and fish to power through his grueling workouts.""I was making sure that I was staying fit and slim so I could fit in the clothes. My diet consists of a pretty light breakfast or light lunch. Sometimes I don’t eat breakfast, and I don’t follow the intermittent fasting diet. When I wake up, I’m not extremely hungry. A lot of protein, whether it’s steak or chicken. I’ve really just dove into fish. Sushi is like my favorite food right now, so it’s helped me with diversifying my proteins and what carbs I’m taking in,” Allen shared. ""But I’m not sitting here counting calories. And when I’m back in Buffalo, we have a chef who cooks for us at least two times a week. I’m also taking the butter and dairy out, trying to eat very clean.”When he's home in Buffalo, Allen said the team's in-house chef is instrumental in keeping meals performance-driven. This enhanced focus on fitness comes as no surprise to his elite-level play. The quarterback has played in just four fewer games throughout his career, even with his high-contact style of play, and has continued to refine himself as a passer and as a runner.In addition to the physical change, Allen admitted to the emotional aid he's had from his wife, Pitch Perfect and Hawkeye star Hailee Steinfeld. Allen said last year, ""She’s been a huge part. The morale, the support. When I get home, she’s my biggest fan, my biggest supporter. She’s just the best.""The Buffalo Bills are again one of the top competitors in the AFC, joining the Kansas City Chiefs, Cincinnati Bengals, and Baltimore Ravens. For Josh Allen, however, this season is not about stats or MVPs—it's about getting over the hump and finally bringing a championship to Buffalo.Also read: Josh Allen gives up oceanfront mansion after secret wedding—did Hailee Steinfeld want him out of L.A.?

The ex-Clemson Tigers standout has been making waves during minicamp, which has NFL analyst Lance Zierlein giving the rookie's skill set and his place in the team some serious thought.“What Briningstool lacks in mass, he makes up for with toughness in both phases. He’s a possession-based tight end who majors in zone-beaters but will struggle to separate against man coverage. He operates in space with good body control and strong hands at the catch point and does an adequate job of keeping defenders on his hip. Despite a high pad level, he can help as a run blocker both connected to the line and in space.He’s not a true “Y” or “F” tight end but is capable enough in all areas to become a factor in two-tight-end sets,” wrote NFL analyst Lance Zierlin.As the Kansas City Chiefs prepare for another Super Bowl run, head coach Andy Reid and his staff may have discovered something greater than a depth chart option in Briningstool. With Travis Kelce nearing the end of his career, the team could be quietly planning for the next era at tight end.Fantasy owners are already paying attention. Jake Briningstool provides long-term potential value, particularly in dynasty formats where insight into player growth is important. If he becomes a key part of Kansas City's passing game, his value could mushroom—maybe even to the point of rivaling that of Travis Kelce.Nobody is counting out Travis Kelce just yet—far from it, fantasy football grizzled veterans—but Jake Briningstool's emergence does indicate that Kansas City might be looking to the future. If he keeps impressing throughout training camp and preseason games, Jake Briningstool might find himself as a key element of the Chiefs' offense sooner rather than later.Also read: “He’s in the sunken place”: Travis Kelce’s post-Taylor Swift transformation has fans spiraling Only time will reveal if he'll drape himself in the crown Kelce's possessed for almost a decade.
