Hornets’ Offensive Struggles Highlight Ball’s Importance

Tough Road Test Against the Milwaukee Bucks

LaMelo Ball’s anticipated return has become one of the main storylines as the Charlotte Hornets prepare to face the Milwaukee Bucks on November 14, 2025. After missing significant time, the Hornets are hoping that Ball’s presence will spark a much-needed shift in their early-season momentum. With the team struggling to find consistency on both ends of the floor, the timing of his expected comeback could not be more critical.Charlotte enters this matchup at 3-7, clearly feeling the effects of playing without their franchise cornerstone. Ball’s ability to orchestrate the offense, set the game’s tempo, and elevate the scoring around him has been sorely missed. Tonight’s contest presents both a challenge and an opportunity for the Hornets to regain their footing in the Eastern Conference.LaMelo Ball is expected to suit up for tonight’s game after being listed as “probable” following a five-game stretch on the sidelines due to a right ankle impingement. His recovery has been handled with caution, given his history of ankle-related setbacks. The Hornets monitored his progress closely through limited practice involvement, targeted rehab sessions, and strength-building work with the team’s G League affiliate.Ball’s return is viewed as a positive progression in his rehabilitation, with both the medical staff and coaching team encouraged by his improvements. Head coach Charles Lee noted that Ball’s strength and movement have been improving daily, adding that the team has been focused on ensuring long-term durability rather than rushing him back prematurely.In LaMelo Ball’s absence, the Hornets have struggled to maintain rhythm offensively. His season averages of 23.3 points, 7.8 rebounds, and 9.8 assists reflect not only his scoring ability but also his central role as the team’s primary playmaker. Without him, Charlotte has lacked fluidity, consistency, and leadership on the court.The team’s record during this stretch underscores those challenges, with the Hornets failing to generate the offensive balance needed to close out games. LaMelo Ball’s playmaking is essential not only for creating scoring opportunities but also for stabilizing the team during crucial moments.Charlotte will lean heavily on Ball’s expected return as they head into a difficult matchup against a Bucks squad that has performed strongly at home. Although Ball is likely to play, the Hornets are still dealing with other injuries, including the absence of Josh Green, who remains sidelined.Fans are eager to see whether Ball can make an immediate impact upon his return. As Charlotte attempts to turn around its early-season slump, his presence gives the team a fighting chance to rediscover its competitive edge.Also read: Is Giannis Antetokounmpo playing tonight vs the Charlotte Hornets?

Milwaukee’s Dependence on Its Superstar

What to Expect Tonight from the Milwaukee Bucks vs Charlotte Hornets Game (November 14, 2025)

as the Milwaukee Bucks prepare for another important matchup against the Charlotte Hornets. Listed as probable, the two-time MVP appears on track to play barring any last-minute issues during warm-ups. Milwaukee is in a tight battle near the top of the Eastern Conference standings, making every game crucial, especially with several roster injuries.The Bucks opted to rest Giannis in the previous game against the Hornets due to a flare-up of his left knee patellar tendinopathy. The condition has been a recurring hurdle throughout the season, requiring careful management to ensure he remains healthy for Milwaukee’s long-term goals. With the team continuing to monitor him closely, tonight’s contest is expected to see him back in action if pregame evaluations go smoothly.Giannis Antetokounmpo’s left knee patellar tendinopathy is not considered a severe injury, but it is persistent and demands consistent load management. The Bucks’ medical staff has reduced his practice workload and strategically limited his minutes whenever necessary.Despite the discomfort, Giannis has remained dominant on the floor in recent weeks, averaging more than 33 points and nearly 12 rebounds per game. His production levels highlight how impactful he remains even while dealing with ongoing knee irritation.In the latest injury update released on November 14, 2025, the Bucks officially listed him as probable for tonight’s rematch with Charlotte. His participation in warm-ups and light drills suggested that he’s trending in the right direction. While the team remains cautious, the expectation is that Giannis will suit up unless he experiences any unforeseen symptoms before tip-off.Milwaukee’s success this season has been closely tied to Giannis’ availability. His two-way dominance elevates the Bucks’ offense and defense, allowing Milwaukee to maintain its competitive edge even while navigating multiple absences elsewhere on the roster. The team continues to be without Kevin Porter Jr., who remains sidelined after right knee meniscus surgery, and Taurean Prince, who is out with a neck strain.Given these injuries, Giannis Antetokounmpo’s return becomes even more important as the team looks to maintain stability in the rotation. Should he play, he is expected to set the tone early, providing the energy and production the Bucks rely on. In the unlikely scenario that he is unable to go, the pressure would shift heavily onto Damian Lillard, Khris Middleton, and Brook Lopez, who would be tasked with carrying both the scoring load and defensive responsibilities.As the Bucks prepare for another showdown with a Hornets team battling inconsistencies and injury issues of its own, Giannis Antetokounmpo’s presence could be the deciding factor. For now, all signs point toward a strong return from Milwaukee’s franchise star in what should be an intense and competitive matchup.","Giannis antetokounmpo is listed as probable for the milwaukee bucks vs charlotte hornets game (november 14, 2025) the two-time mvp has been dealing with a flare-up of his left knee patellar tendinopathy.

More coverage on NFL WAGs:

The electric connection between Tom Brady and Rob Gronkowski echoes the dynamic spark we see today with Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce, offering a vivid lens for comparison. Brady, a seven-time Super Bowl legend, closed out his storied career with three seasons in Tampa Bay, hanging up his cleats as a Buccaneer in 2023. Gronkowski, never far from the spotlight, first retired from the New England Patriots in March 2019, only to be lured back by Brady for a Tampa Bay reunion. Their partnership delivered fourth Super Bowl win before Gronkowski announced his second retirement in June 2022. But was his heart truly at rest? Perhaps not, since he rewrote his retirement script. On November 12, Rob Gronkowski signed a ceremonial one-day contract with New England at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts, so he could officially retire as a Patriot after 11 total NFL seasons. Witnessing this emotional homecoming, his longtime partner and SI Swimsuit star Camille Kostek celebrated on Instagram , sharing 11 photos, one supposedly for each season, and declaring him a “Patriot for life.”The first snapshot was taken inside Gillette Stadium, likely from the Patriots' office. The NFL couple stood in business casuals before a backdrop of Gronkowski’s moments as a Patriots player. Camille Kostek wore a dark denim blue co-ord set with a denim shirt and matching wide-legged trousers. Her medium-length wavy blond hair was left down. She wore glossy peach lipstick, blush, and prominent kohl on the corners of her eyes, along with big, round gold earrings.Gronkowski wore a navy-blue suit with a white collared shirt and brown and white shoes. He had a thin goatee and a spiked army cut.The next snapshot showed them with Patriots owner Robert Kraft, who appeared to be signing his one-day contract. Another image showed the Gillette Stadium Jumbotron displaying a big message: “THANK YOU GRONK,” with Patriots’ Super Bowl championship banners above, commemorating six victories. Other images included the four-time Super Bowl champion in an interview or photoshoot, the stadium in its raw form, and Gronkowski chatting with current head coach Mike Vrabel. The coach and the tight end never played together, as Gronkowski was drafted a year before Vrabel was traded. Vrabel played linebacker for the Patriots from 2001 to 2008. The last image is the cutest, featuring the couple’s French bulldog, Ralphie Gronkowski, whom Rob and Camille adopted in February 2021. Ralphie lies comfortably on a sofa, wearing a Patriots jersey.","Gronkowski retired from the new england patriots in march 2019, only to be lured back by tom brady for a tampa bay reunion in june 2022.

The Columbus Blue Jackets were left searching for answers after captain Boone Jenner exited Tuesday’s game against the Seattle Kraken with an upper body injury. The veteran center left early in the second period, immediately raising concerns for a team that relies heavily on his leadership and dependable two way presence.Jenner had been performing well to start the season, providing steady production and anchoring the top six. His early exit disrupted the team’s rhythm and created uncertainty about his availability for the upcoming stretch of games.On Thursday, head coach Dean Evason finally addressed the situation and shared the clarity the team needed. He revealed that Jenner’s injury is not a short-term issue, indicating that the Blue Jackets will likely be without their captain for a longer period than hoped. The update delivered a tough blow to a roster already searching for consistency.Jenner, age 32, recorded three goals and seven assists through 16 games before the setback. His value goes beyond scoring, as he regularly handles key faceoffs, heavy minutes, and leadership responsibilities. Unfortunately, injuries have been a recurring part of his recent seasons. He has not appeared in 70 games since the 2019 to 2020 campaign and played only 56 games last year.This new absence adds to that pattern at a difficult point in the schedule.Columbus will likely be without Jenner when they face the Edmonton Oilers on Thursday night. The team also hosts the New York Rangers on Saturday and the Montreal Canadiens on Monday, creating a challenging stretch without their most experienced forward. His absence will influence special teams, physical play, and overall lineup stability.There is some good news with the return of Kent Johnson, who missed the Kraken game. Johnson has five points in 15 appearances and will help strengthen the center position, though replacing Jenner’s complete impact remains a significant task. As the Blue Jackets move through this crucial part of the season, Jenner’s recovery timeline becomes a major storyline to monitor.

Availability for Tonight’s Pelicans Matchup

Rehab Progress and What Comes Next

The Los Angeles Lakers will once again be without LeBron James as they prepare to face the New Orleans Pelicans on November 14, 2025. The superstar has been officially ruled out due to persistent right sciatica, an issue that has plagued him since before the start of the 2025–26 season. Despite taking encouraging steps in his rehabilitation program and participating in extensive practice sessions, the Lakers are not ready to clear him for gameplay.LeBron James’ ongoing recovery has included multiple workouts with the Lakers’ G League affiliate, the South Bay Lakers, where he has taken part in full-contact 5-on-5 drills. Although these sessions have produced promising signs - with no reported discomfort or post-practice setbacks - the organization continues to prioritize caution, keeping him sidelined until he reaches full readiness for NBA action.LeBronLeBron has been out since the beginning of the season after dealing with right sciatica, a nerve-related condition causing intense pain in the lower back and radiating down his right side. This condition prevented him from joining training camp and has already kept him from the Lakers’ first 13 regular-season games. While working with the South Bay Lakers, he has steadily increased the intensity of his sessions and has reportedly handled full-contact scrimmages well.Still, team medical staff and coaches believe he needs additional time before he returns to the main roster.For tonight’s Lakers vs. Pelicans game, the organization has officially listed LeBron James as out. The decision reflects the team’s commitment to long-term health management, especially with sciatica being the type of injury that can flare up under heavy physical strain. The Lakers will also be missing several key contributors, including Austin Reaves, Rui Hachimura, and Jordan Goodwin, all ruled out for the matchup. Meanwhile, Adou Thiero remains questionable, leaving the roster in a challenging position as they face a competitive Pelicans squad.Although LeBron James is unavailable tonight, the trajectory of his rehabilitation remains positive. His participation in multiple high-intensity G League practices without complications indicates meaningful progress. The Lakers are optimistic that he could rejoin the team after their upcoming road trip, depending on how he responds to continued conditioning. For LeBron James, the priority is ensuring he returns at a level where he can perform at his standard of excellence, particularly as he aims to compete in what could be a historic 23rd NBA season.Also read: Los Angeles Lakers vs New Orleans Pelicans regular season game: Full injury report, who;s out, and more (November 14, 2025) For Lakers fans, patience remains essential.

Can Edmonton Oilers actually convince the Nashville Predators to trade Juuse Saros?

“Absolutely Dynamic”: 55 Minutes of Juuse Saros Saves

At the beginning of their season, the goaltending dilemma at the Edmonton Oilers turned out to be their most important story, particularly after the humiliating 9-1 loss to the Colorado Avalanche. That loss led fans and analysts to push for GM Stan Bowman to take action immediately, and now he is under a lot of pressure to consider upgrading the goaltender position. Stuart Skinner has managed to perform better recently, and so he has received some support, but the conversation concerning if Juuse Saros could be the long-term answer still reigns in the league discussions.Interest in Saros rose when Jeff Marek first floated his name as a possible target, then insiders like Allan Mitchell and Mark Spector followed up with more detailed analyses. The biggest problem is clear: Edmonton is very close to the salary cap limit, has almost no tradable players, and Saros has only just begun the first year of an eight-year contract that carries a full no-movement clause. This situation makes any trade incredibly difficult, despite the fact that most people think that Saros would quickly bring stability to the Oilers’ most vulnerable area.The first question is whether Nashville wants to discuss things.Until now, the insider's view of the situation is that the Predators are not interested in trading Juuse Saros. Allan Mitchell mentioned that any trade would see the Nashville team retaining some salary, and allowing it to take back several players, whereas, in the case of Skinner, Frank Seravalli was not sure if Saros’ recent performance could be considered an upgrade over Skinner.The Pittsburgh Penguins, meanwhile, are figuring out how their narrative is changing. Insiders, like Josh Yohe, are saying that after the team’s surprisingly good start, players like Erik Karlsson, Rickard Rakell, and Bryan Rust are no longer going to be trade candidates — at least not as long as the team stays in the playoffs. GM Kyle Dubas will not be chasing risky rentals or sacrificing future assets, which implies he is adopting a more conservative approach compared to the previous seasons.The Oilers can only have Juuse Saros in their dreams for the moment, as all indications are that this trade is unlikely to happen — at least for now. Nashville wants to keep its goalie, and Edmonton has no room under the cap, making it more probable that the latter's next step will be aiming at a backup strengthening rather than going for a spectacular blockbuster trade.More coverage on NHL",Edmonton oilers' goaltender dilemma was their most important story at the start of the season.

As the Calgary Flames navigate a slow start to the 2025-26 season, trade chatter has begun to swirl loudly. As names like Rasmus Andersson and Nazem Kadri have dominated speculation, insiders now say the player drawing the most attention is another veteran forward, Blake Coleman. Despite the rising demand for Kadri and Andersson, Flames forward Blake Coleman is drawing the most early interest.The reason behind this trade chatter is due to his contract and reliable play, which is making him attractive to potential suitors. Coleman, who is in the fourth season of his six-year, $29.4 million contract. Meanwhile, multiple teams have contacted Calgary expressing strong interest in the 33-year-old winger, according to recent reports.As trade speculation is picking up momentum, Calgary Flames forward Blake Coleman has emerged as a top trade target amidst potential NHL suitors. He has become the focal point of interest among multiple NHL contenders as he is considered one of the most dependable two-way forwards, offering a strong penalty-killing presence, leadership experience, and reliable secondary scoring.According to Pierre LeBrun of The Athletic, Coleman is getting the most attention now.""Interestingly, for all the speculation around Andersson and Kadri, ... the player who’s received the most attention from other teams is Blake Coleman,"" LeBrun wrote. ""Teams are ... letting Flames GM Craig Conroy know that if he entertains moving Coleman, get in touch... In no way is Calgary shopping Coleman. But Conroy can’t control teams reaching out. "" (source: Sportskeeda)The primary reason behind this attention is based on Coleman’s experience and contract. As per reports, he is signed through 2026-27 with a $4.9 million salary, on a 6-year with $29,400,000. Coleman is known for strong two-way play and has won two Stanley Cups with Tampa Bay. So, many contending teams value his leadership and playoff play.As per his NHL stats and career, Coleman has eight points in 19 games this season, including seven goals and one assist so far. Moreover, the veteran player has earned 298 points in 643 career games. He remains one of Calgary’s most reliable forwards every night and holds value as an offensive addition for any team.Calgary must now decide whether to keep its veteran forwards or trade them. The organization is therefore expected to monitor how the season unfolds leading up to March, with their overall trajectory ultimately shaping every trade decision.","Calgary flames forward blake coleman has emerged as a top trade target amidst potential nhl suitors.

Are Maple Leafs making a mistake by chasing Rasmus Andersson amid ongoing defensive struggles?

Leafs Readying For Life Without Matthews | Real Kyper & Bourne

Once again, the trade talks surrounding Rasmus Andersson have come up with the Calgary Flames having a hard time at the beginning of the season. Andersson, who is now in the last year of his six-year contract, has a cap hit of $4.55 million that is still reasonable and has a modified six-team no-trade clause, thus making him one of the most fascinating players to be mentioned in the trade rumors. His contract runs out in 2026, but the unclear situation concerning the Flames' future has put the talks about his future into overdrive.Across the border in Toronto, the Maple Leafs’ inconsistent start of 8-8-2 has created a situation where more urgency than optimism prevails. Their attack is still maintaining a high rate of scoring of 3.61 goals per game, but conceding 3.83 goals has laid bare the same defensive shortcomings that have troubled the team for a number of years. Besides, the injuries of key players such as Auston Matthews and Anthony Stolarz, and the fact that the special teams are among the worst in the league, have made it really hard to ignore the defensive problems of the Leafs. As a result, all attention was turned to Andersson, who has been a good, top-four defender able to take the toll of 24+ minutes of ice time at night.Analyst Sam McKee on Sportsnet 590 The FAN warned the Maple Leafs about being overly optimistic in their Rasmus Andersson pursuit.The trade of major assets for a player who might become a UFA in 2026 is a gamble, considering that Toronto has limited prospects and draft picks. Also, McKee doubted whether the Leafs’ current situation — inconsistent defense, a power play ranked 24th, and a penalty kill ranked 19th — justifies a forceful move. However, with Calgary postponing Andersson’s extension negotiations, the speculation is increasing. Despite that, McKee suggests that the Leafs should not be hasty with such an expensive choice.Rasmus Andersson may be the right player, but this may be the wrong time. With the Leafs’ assets already stretched thin and their performance unreliable, patience—not panic—might be the smarter long-term move.More coverage on NHL",Rasmus andersson is in the last year of his six-year contract with the calgary flames.

What to Expect in the Los Angeles Lakers vs New Orleans Pelicans Matchup (November 14, 2025)

Theenter their November 14, 2025 regular-season matchup with significant roster complications on both sides. What was initially projected to be a star-powered showdown has quickly transformed into a depth-driven contest shaped by injury-induced adjustments and strategic reshuffling. With several key names unavailable or uncertain, both teams are navigating a delicate balance between maintaining competitiveness and protecting their long-term health goals.The stakes remain high regardless of the setbacks. The Lakers are aiming to stabilize their early-season rhythm without multiple veteran leaders, while the Pelicans look to stay afloat in the standings despite long-term absences to core players. These circumstances position the clash at Smoothie King Center as a test of grit, adaptability, and coaching flexibility.Los Angeles Lakers enters the matchup with a lengthy list of unavailable contributors. LeBron James is ruled out due to right sciatica, a major loss given his playmaking, leadership, and ability to elevate the team in high-pressure stretches. Young wing Adou Thiero is listed as questionable with a left knee injury that may require surgery, leaving his status uncertain.The guard rotation takes a further hit as Gabe Vincent remains sidelined with a left ankle sprain.Taurean Prince continues to recover from a neck herniated disc, reducing forward depth and versatility. Kevin Porter Jr. is unavailable as he recovers from right knee meniscus surgery, and Jordan Poole is out with a left quad strain, removing a major scoring option. With so many players missing, the Lakers are leaning heavily on Austin Reaves and Rui Hachimura to carry offensive and defensive responsibility, though the absence of James and Poole will be significant.The New Orleans Pelicans are facing their own critical setbacks. Zion Williamson is still out with a left hamstring strain, though reports note progress in rehab and clearance for non-contact on-court work. Dejounte Murray remains sidelined with a right Achilles rupture, eliminating a major defensive presence and backcourt playmaker. Two-way guard Trey Alexander is out, and several developmental and G League players - along with Gabe Vincent following recent roster movements - remain unavailable.Day’Ron Sharpe is questionable with a left glute contusion, adding to frontcourt concerns. In response, New Orleans relies heavily on Luka Dončić’s elite scoring and facilitating, supported by Trey Murphy III, DeAndre Ayton, and Jake LaRavia, who have stepped up to maintain competitive balance despite the injuries.The extensive injury situations on both sides shift the emphasis toward depth production, defensive execution, and in-game adjustments. The Los Angeles Lakers must find ways to compensate for missing star power and perimeter scoring, while the New Orleans Pelicans aim to build around the reliable output of Dončić and supporting talent. Fans can expect a physical, tactical, and closely contested battle defined by resilience rather than marquee names.","The los angeles lakers host the new orleans pelicans in a november 14, 2025 regular-season matchup.

What the Sixers Will Rely on Tonight

Fan Reactions and Game Expectations

Joel Embiid has officially been ruled out for tonight’s matchup against the Detroit Pistons, as the Philadelphia 76ers continue to manage his right knee soreness. The Sixers’ latest injury report for November 14, 2025, confirms that the reigning MVP will not suit up, extending a stretch of careful monitoring following his ongoing knee issues. This decision aligns with the team’s long-term approach, particularly as they remain engaged in NBA Cup Group Play.This marks the second straight game Embiid will miss after sitting out against the Boston Celtics. Philadelphia has avoided playing him on consecutive nights this season, prioritizing his recovery and ensuring that minor flare-ups do not escalate. While the news may disappoint fans hoping to see him dominate in the paint, the team has emphasized that Embiid has fortunately avoided any structural damage, and his day-to-day status indicates optimism moving forward.The organization maintains a cautious stance but remains encouraged by Joel Embiid’s progress. Despite knee soreness lingering over recent games, medical evaluations have reportedly shown no major concerns. His status as day-to-day suggests that his absence is more about precaution than setback. This approach reflects Philadelphia’s larger goal of keeping their franchise cornerstone healthy for the long haul rather than pushing him into November games at the expense of durability.Joel Embiid’s last outing - a standout 29-point performance in a win over the Toronto Raptors - showcased the level of impact they lose without him. His scoring, defensive presence, and leadership continue to anchor the Sixers’ identity. With him sidelined, the coaching staff must lean on adjustments that boost energy, creativity, and next-man-up effort.Tyrese Maxey instantly becomes the focal point of the offense, and recent history suggests he’s up for the task. Maxey has averaged over 30 points and close to seven assists in his last four games against Detroit, making him Philadelphia’s clearest path to staying competitive. The team will also be without Paul George, who continues to recover from left knee surgery, adding to the pressure on the backcourt.Center depth becomes critical with Joel Embiid unavailable. Veterans Andre Drummond and rookie Adem Bona are expected to handle the interior responsibilities, bringing contrasting styles that could give the Sixers a dynamic but unpredictable presence in the paint. Rookie VJ Edgecombe remains questionable with back spasms, further thinning the rotation.Supporters have largely backed the decision to rest Joel Embiid, joking online about “load management and living-room leadership,” while also recognizing the importance of preserving their superstar. Tonight offers Maxey another chance to strengthen his emerging star power as Philadelphia seeks to remain competitive despite missing key contributors.","Joel embiid has officially been ruled out for tonight’s matchup against the detroit pistons.

More coverage in NFL:

Los Angeles Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert is used to commanding national attention, but Week 11 brings a rare twist that puts his own family in the spotlight. His younger brother, Patrick Herbert, is on the verge of making his NFL regular-season debut, setting the stage for an unexpected storyline that has quickly gained momentum ahead of Sunday’s matchup.For the Jacksonville Jaguars, the timing couldn’t be more compelling. Injuries at the tight end position have created a real opening for Patrick, who has quietly spent the season developing on the practice squad. Now, as the Jaguars prepare to face the Chargers, the possibility of a Herbert-versus-Herbert moment has become one of Week 11’s most intriguing developments.Patrick Herbert, like his older brother, came through the Oregon program and earned a shot in Jacksonville with the hope of carving out his own NFL path. Though he has yet to take an official snap in a regular-season game, circumstances this week may finally give him that chance. The Jaguars are dealing with injuries to Brenton Strange and Hunter Long, thinning the depth at tight end and increasing the likelihood of elevating Patrick to the gameday roster.Despite Johnny Mundt and Quintin Morris sitting ahead of him on the depth chart, the coaching staff may opt to bring Patrick up for added depth and flexibility.For Patrick, sharing an NFL field with Justin would not only be historic—it would mark a personal milestone after months of hard work on the practice squad.Patrick spoke earlier this week about how meaningful this moment could be, acknowledging that watching Justin succeed over the last several years has been both inspiring and grounding. Facing his brother on an NFL stage is something the family dreamed about, but few expected it to materialize this soon.If the Jaguars elevate Patrick, Week 11 instantly becomes more than just another AFC showdown. It becomes a rare family narrative, one that brings together two brothers chasing the same dream on opposite sidelines. And for Patrick Herbert, this could be the moment that officially launches his NFL journey, turning a long-awaited opportunity into a memorable debut.","Patrick herbert will make his nfl debut in week 11, facing brother justin.

Poll Should South Africa have escalated the stump-mic incident? Yes No

South Africa have taken a measured stance on the stump-mic moment that briefly overshadowed the opening day of the first Test at Eden Gardens, with batting coach Ashwell Prince confirming the visitors will not escalate the matter.The incident unfolded during the 13th over of South Africa’s innings, moments after Jasprit Bumrah struck Temba Bavuma on the pads with a delivery that cut back into the right-hander.India’s appeal was turned down, leading to a discussion between Bumrah and wicketkeeper Rishabh Pant over the DRS call. The stump mic picked up a remark, which was widely interpreted online as “bauna bhi hai”, which triggered debate on social media.Prince, however, dismissed the prospect of internal discussion or formal action.“No, there will be no discussion. It's the first time, obviously, it's come to my attention. I don't think there'll be any issues with what's happened out in the middle,” he said.Bavuma, returning after a calf strain, lasted 11 balls before Kuldeep Yadav removed him with a leg-slip trap. His early exit came during a phase in which India clawed back control after South Africa’s steady start at 62/2.Bumrah’s spell, meanwhile, continued to dictate the course of the day.The fast bowler claimed 5/27, striking early blows by removing Aiden Markram and Ryan Rickelton before triggering a collapse that sent South Africa tumbling to 159 all out. His ability to generate movement on a dry surface that offered inconsistent bounce stood out even in a bowling attack built around four spinners.The visitors had entered the series after a mixed run last season, one that included both strong home performances and stretches of inconsistency away from familiar conditions. Their World Test Championship defence began with injuries disrupting the squad, and Bavuma’s delayed return added to the adjustments made for the Kolkata Test.While the stump-mic remark dominated online chatter after play, South Africa’s camp has shifted focus back to the cricket, emphasising that their assessment remains confined to on-field events. India closed the day at 37/1, leaving the match finely poised heading into Day 2.With no complaint expected and both sides turning their attention to the remainder of the Test, the controversy is unlikely to stretch beyond its brief viral moment","Jasprit bumrah was involved in a controversial moment as his words, which were likely aimed at temba bavuma, were picked up on the stump mic. The incident unfolded during the 13th over of south africa’s innings, moments after bumra struck bavuma on the pads with a delivery that cut back into the right-hander.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125333030,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-52680,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
