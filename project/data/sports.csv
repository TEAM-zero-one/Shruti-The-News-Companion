Asia Cup press conference: Suryakumar Yadav on playing Pakistan, Sanju Samson, India Playing XI

NEW DELHI: In a rare incident during the Asia Cup 2025 clash between India and UAE at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium on Wednesday, UAE batter Junaid Siddique was initially given out after a sharp direct throw from India’s wicketkeeper Sanju Samson found him short of the crease. However, Indian skipper Suryakumar Yadav chose to withdraw the appeal when Siddique pointed out that bowler Shivam Dube’s towel had slipped from his waistband during the run-up.The unusual moment came in the 13th over when Siddique attempted a wild swing at Dube’s short-pitched delivery. Replays from the third umpire confirmed that his foot was outside the crease, and the “OUT” signal was flashed on the big screen before India opted to overturn the appeal.The gesture did not impact the match result, as UAE were bundled out for just 57 runs soon after.Kuldeep Yadav, returning to white-ball action after warming the bench during India’s five-Test tour of England, was the star with the ball. The left-arm spinner demolished the UAE batting order with sensational figures of 4 for 7 in just 2.1 overs.Jasprit Bumrah set the tone for India’s dominance, removing Kerala-born opener Alishan Sharafu with a pinpoint yorker.Sharafu had top-scored for UAE with 22 off 17 balls, including three fours and a six, before Bumrah’s lethal delivery ended his innings. Once Sharafu departed, the UAE batting line-up collapsed swiftly, with wickets tumbling in quick succession.Chasing a modest target of 58, India cruised to a 9-wicket win, starting their Asia Cup 2025 campaign in emphatic fashion.India will next face arch-rivals Pakistan on Sunday in Dubai, a contest already billed as the marquee clash of the group stage.",Uae batter junaid siddique was initially given out after a sharp direct throw from india’s wicketkeeper sanju samson found him short of the crease.

Who Wins the Most?

Theare reportedly in advanced talks to acquirefrom the Los Angeles Clippers in a blockbuster trade that could reshape the NBA landscape. By pairing Leonard with LeBron James and Luka Doncic, the Lakers aim to create one of the most formidable trios in league history. The trade would not only offer immediate title hopes but also bring strategic advantages for all teams involved.NBA sources indicate that the Lakers would need to offer a substantial trade package to secure Kawhi Leonard, who is under a $50 million salary for the 2024-25 season. The Clippers are expected to demand a mix of promising young players such as Austin Reaves or Bronny James, future draft picks, expiring contracts, and salary-matching assets.An interesting development making this trade more plausible is the NBA’s ongoing investigation into the Clippers’ 2021 cap circumvention, which could potentially void Leonard’s contract and allow the Lakers to sign him at a discounted rate, sources suggest.Adding Kawhi Leonard would drastically enhance the Los Angeles Lakers ’ championship aspirations. Leonard’s elite two-way play would complement the scoring prowess of Doncic and the leadership of LeBron James.Leonard, known for his clutch performances and defensive excellence, averaged 21.5 points, 5.9 rebounds, and 3.1 assists on nearly 50% shooting in the current season.Key benefits for the Lakers include:• A versatile lineup that can switch defensively.• Balanced scoring options and reduced pressure on star players.• A renewed push toward winning now while LeBron James remains at his peak.For Kawhi Leonard, the trade offers stability and a healthier environment. Leonard would share playmaking responsibilities with Doncic, allowing him to conserve energy and lower injury risks. He would also join a championship-caliber roster while remaining in Los Angeles, near family and personal interests.Leonard’s benefits include:• Access to a title-driven team structure.• Reduced physical demands and prolonged career viability.• A chance to move past off-court controversies involving the Clippers. The Clippers , by trading Leonard, would open the door to rebuilding with younger talent and future draft picks. The team’s roster, currently averaging 33.2 years of age - the oldest in NBA history - would undergo much-needed rejuvenation.Advantages for the Clippers:• Increased flexibility for future signings.• Relief from salary cap constraints.• Public relations improvement following scandal coverage.• The Lakers become instant title contenders with three elite scorers and defenders.• Kawhi Leonard benefits from reduced injury risks and better team support.• Clippers gain young assets and strategic cap space for rebuilding.• Potential chemistry challenges with Leonard’s previous reluctance to play alongside LeBron James.• Clippers’ competitiveness may dip in the short term.• Lakers may risk depth for a win-now approach.The Lakers win immediately, forming the league’s most talented trio and maximizing LeBron’s remaining window.• The Lakers gain an elite roster capable of challenging for titles.• Leonard receives better health management and career opportunities.• The Clippers position themselves for long-term growth and roster flexibility.• NBA fans benefit from a high-stakes rivalry and an exciting narrative.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Los Angeles Lakers Target $1,082,061 Los Angeles Clippers Star to Strengthen Defense and Support LeBron James & Luka Doncic A Kawhi Leonard trade to the Los Angeles Lakers could be one of the biggest moves in recent NBA history.

Kawhi Leonard chose Los Angeles Clippers over Los Angeles Lakers to dodge LeBron James and $28M payout,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/kawhi-leonard-chose-los-angeles-clippers-over-los-angeles-lakers-to-dodge-lebron-james-and-28m-payout/articleshow/123793641.cms,"(Image Source - Getty Images)

Why Kawhi Leonard Dodged the Los Angeles Lakers and LeBron James

The Los Angeles Clippers initially labeled the allegations as provably false before changing their language to absurd

In the summer of 2019, Kawhi Leonard was at the top of the NBA world. After guiding the Toronto Raptors to their first championship, the calm superstar entered free agency as the most sought-after player available. His choice would change the league's dynamics, balancing local loyalty with championship dreams and personal desires.In the end, Leonard chose the Los Angeles Clippers instead of the Los Angeles Lakers or a possible comeback with the Raptors.From the beginning, the Lakers were considered a long shot, despite their flashy reputation and the addition of LeBron James and Anthony Davis. In 2019, various reports mentioned that Leonard had no desire to play with James, thinking it could lead to a clash of egos or styles.According to NBA insider Chris Haynes, then with Yahoo Sports, Leonard's camp explicitly avoided the Lakers because he ""didn't want to play with LeBron,"" preferring to be the unquestioned leader. This sentiment was echoed in later reflections; for instance, in a 2024 Fadeaway World report, it was noted that Leonard rejected the chance to form a superteam with James and Davis, opting instead for Paul George as a partner.A faceless NBA executive mentioned to Newsweek in September 2025 that the Lakers ""dodged a bullet"" by not acquiring Leonard, highlighting his injury record and the unfolding scandal. At that moment, Lakers GM Rob Pelinka was chasing Leonard hard, but the forward's dislike for sharing the spotlight with James who he had just triumphed over in the Finals with the Warriors sealed the deal. Leonard's decision favored freedom over joining a dominant team.Jump ahead to 2021-2022, and things get a bit dicey with Leonard's agreement with Aspiration, a climate finance company. As Pablo Torre first mentioned on his podcast ""Pablo Torre Finds Out"" back in September 2025, Aspiration committed to shelling out $7 million each year for four years beginning in April 2022, specifically for no services provided.The contract, found among more than 3,000 pages of documents, had a clause that let Leonard off the hook from any work. Torre also verified, through the Boston Sports Journal, that Leonard got $20 million in company shares now completely worthless after Aspiration went bankrupt.In August 2021, Leonard signed an extension with the Clippers; then in September 2021, Ballmer put $50 million into Aspiration; that same month, the Clippers announced Aspiration as a sponsor; Leonard's LLC got registered in November 2021; and the payouts kicked off in 2022. An unnamed Aspiration employee told Torre this was a ""scheme to skirt the NBA salary cap."" The deal was never publicized, unlike endorsements with celebrities like Leonardo DiCaprio or Drake, who received far less.In a September 2025 interview with Ramona Shelburne for ESPN, Ballmer refuted claims of cap violations, saying he was ""conned"" by Aspiration and had no say in their deal with Leonard. He acknowledged that he introduced Aspiration to Leonard at their request but maintained that the Clippers followed the rules. Initially, the Clippers labeled the allegations as ""provably false,"" but later they toned it down to ""absurd. ""Also Read: Luka Doncic shuts down the critics with a EuroBasket best defender nomination So far, Leonard and Robertson have kept quiet. If this scandal is confirmed, it could overshadow earlier cases like the 1998 Joe Smith-Timberwolves trade, which led to penalties and lost draft picks. At this moment, it puts a negative spin on Leonard's choice to go with the Clippers avoiding LeBron, securing George, and reportedly receiving a $28 million side deal that Toronto ethically declined.","Kawhi leonard avoided the los angeles lakers and lebron james because he ""didn't want to play with lebron,"" preferring to be the unquestioned leader.

Travis Kelce weighs retirement after Super Bowl loss and new engagement

“A handful of things have to happen, or not happen, that will make Travis decide if he keeps playing. This should be the end.”

Taylor Swift and Jason Kelce support his choice without pressure

, “Taylor is not going to be the Gisele or Yoko of Travis and his career. She wants him to make his own choice.”

DEMIDOV makes INSTANT impact in 1st NHL period!

Matthew Schaefer of Islanders takes No. 1 spot



Ivan Demidov of the Canadiens earns second place



Ryan Leonard and Zeev Buium round out the top five



NHL Network has released its annual ranking of the top 25 NHL prospects, shining a spotlight on the next generation of players expected to make an impact. The list includes highly regarded draft picks and standout performers from junior, college, and international tournaments. This year, New York Islanders defenseman Matthew Schaefer earned the top position, edging out Montreal Canadiens forward Ivan Demidov.Schaefer, the first overall pick in the 2025 NHL Draft, leads this year’s ranking. The 18-year-old defenseman played last season with Erie in the Ontario Hockey League, where his strong skating and all-around play made him stand out. Despite missing time with a clavicle injury, he showed his potential with 22 points in 17 games.Schaefer also represented Canada at the World Junior Championship before his injury, scoring once and assisting on another goal in two games. He had previously been part of gold-medal teams at both the Hlinka Gretzky Cup and the Under-18 World Championship. NHL Network analysts credited his maturity and defensive awareness as key reasons for placing him at the top of the list.The Islanders see Schaefer as a foundational piece for their future blue line, following in the footsteps of previous No. 1 picks like Connor McDavid , who also came from Erie.Right behind Schaefer is Montreal Canadiens forward Ivan Demidov. The 19-year-old winger has already given fans a glimpse of his ability after appearing in both regular-season and playoff games last spring. In his NHL debut, he scored a goal and added an assist, quickly showing he could handle the pace of the league.Before moving to North America, Demidov put up 49 points in the Kontinental Hockey League with SKA St. Petersburg, the most ever by a player under 20 in that league. His creativity, puck skills, and offensive instincts have drawn comparisons to some of the league’s top young stars.Montreal supporters are hopeful that Demidov will become a centerpiece of their rebuild. Given his performance in Russia and quick adjustment to the NHL, expectations for his rookie season are high.Washington Capitals forward Ryan Leonard claimed the No. 5 spot after another standout year at Boston College. Known for his scoring touch, Leonard led the NCAA with 30 goals and was named Hockey East Player of the Year. He also captained the United States to a gold medal at the 2025 World Junior Championship, where he had 10 points in seven games.Just ahead of him at No. 4 is Minnesota Wild defenseman Zeev Buium. The Denver standout followed up a 50-point freshman season with another strong campaign, again finishing near the top of NCAA scoring among defensemen. Buium also played a role in the United States’ World Junior gold medal run, adding six points and strong defensive play.Together with Schaefer and Demidov, both Leonard and Buium represent the depth of talent set to enter the NHL in the next few seasons.

Why the Cowboys could use Jadeveon Clowney’s experience right now



Also read

Veteran defensive end Jadeveon Clowney could soon be back on an NFL roster. After being connected to the Baltimore Ravens for much of the offseason, the 32-year-old is now in Texas to meet with the Dallas Cowboys, according to Josina Anderson. Clowney, who did not play in Week 1, is reportedly exploring a potential role with a Cowboys defense that suddenly finds itself in need of depth on the edge. With Micah Parsons now in Green Bay, Dallas has a clear hole to fill in its pass-rushing unit. Clowney has a history of signing late in the offseason, and this visit could lead to a quick deal if both sides are aligned.Clowney, 32, spent the 2024 season with the Carolina Panthers and put up solid numbers: 46 combined tackles, 5.5 sacks, 11 quarterback hits, and nine tackles for loss across 14 games. He’s just two years removed from one of the best campaigns of his career, tallying 9.5 sacks with the Baltimore Ravens in 2023. Over 11 seasons, the former No. 1 overall pick has logged 58 career sacks. Dallas is currently leaning on a young edge group that includes Sam Williams, Dante Fowler Jr. , Marshawn Kneeland, James Houston, and rookie Donovan Ezeiruaku following the exit of Micah Parsons.In 14 games last season with the Carolina Panthers, Clowney finished with 46 total tackles and 5.5 sacks—a productive year for a rotational edge rusher.He may no longer be a full-time starter, but his ability to disrupt plays off the edge in passing situations remains valuable, especially for a team like Dallas that is trying to stay competitive after roster turnover. The No. 1 overall pick in the 2014 NFL Draft, Clowney has had stints with multiple teams including the Texans, Seahawks, Titans, and Browns, and has developed into a trusted veteran presence who understands how to make an impact in specific defensive packages.At this point in his career, Clowney is best suited for a rotational pass-rushing role, particularly in third-down or obvious passing situations. The Cowboys have young talent across the defensive line, but with Parsons gone, the team is likely looking for a veteran who can help bring pressure without needing to play every down.Clowney fits that mold well—and could provide leadership in the locker room as well as production on the field.","Veteran pass rusher jadeveon clowney visits the dallas cowboy.

Stephen Curry’s Three-Point Revolution as a Blessing

S1 E4 - Matt Barnes - Big Boy's The Hangout - Kobe Bryant - Steph Curry Lakers Lebron All the Smoke

The Curse of Stephen Curry’s Influence

Matt Barnes believes traditional post up play has become rare in today’s game

Stephen Curry has changed the game of basketball with his unmatched three-point shooting, turning the NBA into a quick, long-range sport. Former teammate Matt Barnes, during an appearance on Big Boy's ""The Hangout"" podcast, referred to Curry’s influence as both a blessing and a curse.In the episode titled ""S1 E4 - Matt Barnes - Steph Curry Lakers Lebron All the Smoke,"" which was released on YouTube, Barnes shared with host Kurt Alexander that Curry’s approach has revolutionized the game but has also caused players to focus too much on three-pointers, which has led to a decline in traditional skills.Stephen Curry's incredible three-point skills have changed basketball and has added a new level in the game. While looking at the history we see that players like Shaquille O'Neal and Tim Duncan ruled the paint, while Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant excelled with their mid-range game.Stephen Curry's shooting and long-range ability made the three-pointer a key tool, leading to the rise of the 'pace-and-space' era. The average points scored per game in the NBA increased from 100.0 in 2013-14 to 114.7 in 2023-24, while three-point attempts surged from 22.4 to 34.8 per game.Barnes mentioned to Big Boy, ""Steph...totally transformed it. It's not just the NBA, but the entire way basketball is played, period,"" motivating a focus on skill worldwide.Barnes points out a downside: players think they can copy Curry, which results in them depending too much on three-pointers. “Steph was a gift and a curse to this game because everyone thinks they could do it,” he told Big Boy.This mentality has standardized basketball, leading players to prefer 25-foot shots rather than driving, a trend that Barnes labeled as the “Steph Curry and Klay Thompson effect.” He highlighted that although Curry and Thompson are exceptional shooters, ""everyone believes that shooting the three-pointer is crucial for success,"" which limits the variety in the game.The three-point revolution has marginalized back-to-the-basket big men. Barnes told Big Boy, “Are the big men gone? Yeah…There’s no more back-to-the-basket.” Today's stars such as Nikola Jokic and Joel Embiid combine outside shooting with their height, which is different from classic centers like O’Neal. “You see the Embiids…Jokic…those would be back-to-the-basket centers. But now you see these guys…shooting threes,” Barnes mentioned that while there's more versatility now, he's sad to see post-up play fading away. He hinted that this trend could come back around, but right now, traditional big men are like ""unicorns.""Also Read: Kawhi Leonard chose Los Angeles Clippers over Los Angeles Lakers to dodge LeBron James and $28M payout From the physical 1980s to the soaring 2000s, basketball has constantly changed. According to Barnes in his chat with Big Boy, Curry’s three-point era has made the game more skillful but less varied, with his legacy influencing its future direction.","Matt barnes believes traditional post up play has become rare in today’s game.

On September 5, 2025, at LoanDepot Park in Miami, a Philadelphia Phillies vs. Miami Marlins game turned into more than just baseball. Outfielder Harrison Bader hit a home run into the stands. Drew Feltwell, a father, caught the ball and handed it to his 10-year-old son Lincoln, who hugged him with joy. But the happy moment was interrupted. A woman walked up, angry, and demanded the ball. Drew stayed calm as she raised her voice. In the end, Drew took the ball from Lincoln and gave it to her. The video of the clash spread online within hours. Millions watched, and the woman was quickly called the “Phillies Karen.”After the game, Drew Feltwell explained why he handed over the ball. He said the woman “just would not stop,” and he wanted to protect his son from more stress.Later, speaking to USA TODAY Sports on September 8, Drew asked the public to stop attacking her.The night was saved by kindness from the teams. The Miami Marlins gave Lincoln a gift bag.Harrison Bader himself met the boy and signed a bat for him, making sure the memory stayed special. The moment showed how a tense situation could still end with hope.The woman who grabbed the ball faced heavy backlash once the clip went viral. Online users hunted for her name, but several women were wrongly accused.Cheryl Richardson-Wagner and Leslie-Ann Kravitz both had to speak out, saying they were not involved. Even a school district in Pennsylvania denied that the woman worked for them.The attention was so intense that one sports card company even offered $5,000 for the baseball, but only if she signed it with the words “I’m sorry.” The label “Phillies Karen” became a symbol online, with people calling her behavior selfish and unfair.But therapists say the outrage is about more than one ball. Many feel it reflects bigger issues of power, fairness, and respect in American society.Also Read: Phillies Karen Identified And Fired After Taking Harrison Bader Home Run Ball From Drew Feltwell’s Son As psychotherapist Stephanie Sarkis explained","Phillies karen story explained: what harrison bader and kid’s national outrage reveals about the american mindset.

Net worth: Estimated between $200 million and €250 million

Ballon d'Or winner and captain of Saudi Pro League club Al-Ittihad, Karim Benzema has climbed the ranks of the world's most paid soccer players. In 2025, the amount of the contract and salary received by Benzema not only indicates his value, but also the capital development of Saudi football.

Auston Matthews reflects on last season's struggles



Toronto Maple Leafs face uncertainty without Mitch Marner

Fans react cautiously to Auston Matthews’ statement



Toronto Maple Leafs captain Auston Matthews is trying to ease concerns about his health. After an injury-filled 2023–24 campaign, the forward said he feels stronger and healthier this offseason. Yet, instead of calming the fan base, his comments have left many wondering if the team’s most important player is truly ready for the grind ahead.Matthews played only 67 games last season, missing time with injuries that never seemed to go away fully. He scored well below his usual standard and later admitted he wasn’t healthy from the very start. The situation grew so serious that he even traveled to Germany to get a second opinion. For a player often relied upon to carry the Leafs’ offense, his struggles showed on the ice.The forward admitted the past year was frustrating, but added he worked hard during the summer to get back to where he needs to be. “My health is good. I feel a lot better. I think I took really good steps this offseason as far as that goes, and so I’m really happy with that progress and happy with where I’m at,” Matthews said.The Leafs already face a major adjustment after parting ways with longtime forward Mitch Marner.His departure means more pressure falls on Matthews to lead both on and off the ice. Toronto’s playoff hopes often rise and fall with his performance, and that’s even more true this year.If Matthews is anything less than fully fit, the Leafs could struggle to keep pace in a tough Eastern Conference; his scoring ability, leadership, and presence as captain are all factors Toronto cannot afford to lose. For many, the worry isn’t whether Matthews can start the season strong but if his body will hold up through 82 games and the postseason.On paper, Matthews’ words sound encouraging. But Leafs fans were quick to read between the lines on social media. Some questioned whether “feeling better” really means he’s fully healthy. Others speculated he may still be dealing with a back issue that could linger or require surgery later in the year.“Not exactly the words I was hoping to hear from #34,” one fan posted, echoing a wider concern across the fan base. Another worried that he may play through the season but risk breaking down before the playoffs.The reaction highlights the fragile trust between the team and its supporters after repeated early postseason exits. Fans know Matthews’ health is the single biggest factor in whether Toronto can go further this year. Until he proves it on the ice, words alone won’t be enough to calm their nerves.For now, the message is mixed. Matthews insists he’s in a better place physically, but skepticism lingers. With the new season just around the corner, the Leafs and their fans can only wait to see if their captain is truly ready to lead them.Also Read: NHL star Leon Draisaitl's wife, Celeste Desjardins, shares a bond with Mikayla Nurse, the wife of Darnell Nurse",Auston matthews played only 67 games last season due to injuries.

Al-Hilal eyes reunion of Simone Inzaghi and Piero Ausilio

Potential impact on Inter Milan if Piero Ausilio leaves

Saudi Pro League giants Al-Hilal are waiting to hear back from the current Inter Milan sporting director, Piero Ausilio, over the possibility of a switch to the club. The news comes after Al-Hilal appointed former Inter Milan head coach Simone Inzaghi. The Saudi side wants to reunite Inzaghi with Ausilio, who was instrumental in building the title-winning Inter team that Inzaghi managed.Al-Hilal also notes the pursuit of Piero Ausilio in bolstering the management of Simone Inzaghi, in which the successful duo can be united once more. Ausilio is reportedly in favor of moving to Al-Hilal, taking the opportunity to work with Inzaghi again. The Saudi club had one of the busiest transfer windows by signing high-profile players and is now paying attention to strengthening its administration.Also Read: Al-Hilal withdraws from 2025 Saudi Super Cup citing fatigue, sparks debate on player welfare It would spell the end of an era at Inter Milan as well if Piero Ausilio were to leave the club to join Al-Hilal. The directive is not only vital but equally vital in the success of Inter Milan. For example, if he vacates his position, Inter Milan management will have to scramble for the best competitor available in order to stay at the top of Italian football.Piero Ausilio played a huge role in Inter Milan's success, especially in the UEFA Champions League last year.His recruitment strategy and management of the squad ensured there was depth and balance all over the field.Guided by him, Inter Milan assembled a side that could go toe-to-toe with the best in Europe, making the latter rounds of the tournament and proving tough to beat in key fixtures. A lot of it was down to Ausilio's decisions in the transfer market and how well he identified talent, attributes many lauded as key components for Inter Milan's success on the continental stage.With the ongoing back and forth, Piero Ausilio has a choice ahead of him, and one that could reverberate through both Al-Hilal and Inter Milan, and perhaps the whole of football. Al-Hilal has previously signed manager Simone Inzaghi and sporting director Piero Ausilio, and the pair will only strengthen the club's ambitions of becoming an internationally competitive force.","Saudi pro league giants al-hilal are waiting to hear back from the current inter milan sporting director, piero ausilio, over the possibility of a switch to the club.

Former UFC welterweight predicts Cory Sandhagen will shock the world and defeat Merab Dvalishvili,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/international-sports/former-ufc-welterweight-predicts-cory-sandhagen-will-shock-the-world-and-defeat-merab-dvalishvili/articleshow/123811871.cms,"Cory Sandhagen (Image Source: Getty)

Why Cory Sandhagen’s style could pose problems

Dan Hardy’s Bold Prediction for Ilia Topuria!

“Sanhagen’s one of my favorite fighters to watch. He’s a very, very good problem solver in the moment. He’s good at reading what’s in front of him and adapting his technique… And the thing with Merab because he’s got a very high pace… there’s almost like a subconscious motor… that subconscious motor can be a little bit predictable. So someone like Sandhagen’s going to see rhythms… I’m expecting knees and uppercuts and damaging things up the center channel and elbows on the inside.

”

Merab Dvalishvili’s dominance and what is on the line

In the boldest of predictions, former MMA welterweight Dan Hardy predicts Cory Sandhagen will score an upset over champion Merab Dvalishvili in the middle of UFC 320. This pattern has a ceaseless forward pressure that Hardy describes as predictable, and one that a cerebral, movement-centric striker like Sandhagen is more than capable of taking advantage of. Hardy wrote this before their matchup scheduled for October 4 at the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas. Hardy sees a huge clinic, predicting knees, uppercuts, and elbows ripping through the middle and giving rise to fight-altering damage.Hardy identifies Cory Sandhagen's elite fight IQ and his international-level range of striking disciplines, Muay Thai, kickboxing, and boxing, as crucial elements that can upset Merab Dvalishvili's cadence.Cory Sandhagen is incredibly mobile, very light on his feet, effectively tall at 5-11 with a 70-inch reach, and portion switches with no thought, making him capable of mixing it up and maintaining distance at will. His movement to pivot angles whilst at the same time incentivising Dvalishvili’s unrelenting forward pressure might create opportunities for counter-attacks that go on to inflict serious damage. That's the sort of strategic snare Hardy thinks could lead the Georgian champion to the first loss of his career in years.Hardy states in the conversation:Sandhagen has developed a reputation for being one of the most creative and cerebral fighters in the bantamweight division. He can turn the tides whenever he wants, whether it's with spinning strikes or a flying knee out of thin air.Also Read: “Henry Cejudo vibes” - UFC fans react as Merab Dvalishvili takes a visual dig at Sean O’Malley during UFC With the current record of 20-4, Dvalishvili has been running through the bantamweight division for nearly two years with a dominant 11-fight winning streak. Against elite opposition, his pace, aggressiveness, and pace-breaking takedown output have proved overwhelming. In his recent fights, he has displayed the skill of pressuring people until they cannot handle his cardio or durability.The champion's engine is perhaps the hardest riddle to decipher in today's MMA.

Asia Cup: Gautam Gambhir in a serious discussion with India vice-captain Shubman Gill

NEW DELHI: Left-arm spinner Kuldeep Yadav and seamer Shivam Dube ran through the United Arab Emirates’ batting lineup as India romped to a nine-wicket win in their Asia Cup 2025 opener on Wednesday. Kuldeep’s sharp googlies earned him figures of 4 for 7, while Dube claimed 3 for 4, helping bowl out UAE for just 57 in 13.1 overs — the lowest-ever T20 total against India.In reply, India made light work of the chase, reaching 60 for 1 in just 4.3 overs. Opening batter Abhishek Sharma impressed with 30 off 16 balls, hitting three sixes and two boundaries, while Shubman Gill remained unbeaten on 20.After the victory, Gill posted on social media: “Step one.”UAE’s innings never truly got going despite a reasonable start from Alishan Sharafu (22) and captain Muhammad Waseem (19), who put together 41 for 2 in the powerplay.India’s relentless bowling soon took control. Bumrah dismissed Sharafu with a pinpoint yorker and Mohammad Zohaib was caught at backward point attempting an ambitious shot against Varun Chakravarthy.Kuldeep’s three-wicket over, which included a plumb leg-before dismissal of Waseem, dismantled the middle order.Dube then struck thrice in his two overs, and UAE folded with more than six overs to spare.A rare moment of confusion saw Junaid Siddique initially stumped, but India withdrew the appeal after he explained that Dube’s rag distracted him. He fell the next ball trying to recover. Kuldeep finished the innings by having Haider Ali caught behind.India’s chase was clinical. Abhishek launched Ali’s first ball over wide extra cover for a six and continued to dominate before falling off a miscued short ball. Suryakumar Yadav then smashed Siddique for a six, and Gill sealed the win with a boundary to mid-on.India now head into their next group matches against Pakistan and debutants Oman, having made a resounding statement in Dubai.","India beat united arab emirates by nine wickets in their asia cup opener.

India Asia Cup prediction: Why bad news could be in store for India | Greenstone Lobo predicts

Speaking to TimesofIndia.com ahead of India’s Asia Cup 2025 opener, astrologer Greenstone Lobo offered an intriguing perspective on the tournament’s likely outcome.While India are widely seen as the overwhelming favourites, Lobo explained why predicting winners of smaller tournaments can be more complex than forecasting World Cups.“When we talk about winning tournaments, predicting a major tournament like a World Cup is actually easier. But it becomes a little more difficult to predict which team will win an IPL or a T20 World Cup. And it’s even more difficult to predict a smaller tournament like an Asia Cup,” Lobo said.According to him, the difference lies in horoscopes. Captains with the strongest charts usually succeed in the biggest competitions, while those with “slightly lesser horoscopes” can still triumph in smaller tournaments. “That is where it gets tricky and interesting,” he noted.Turning to the present edition, Lobo highlighted Suryakumar Yadav’s leadership as a major positive.“He’s got a phenomenal chart. Pluto is in nascent exaltation, Neptune is very powerful. Planet Z is in its own house. That’s a very strong indication he’s going to do well,” he said, calling the Suryakumar–Gautam Gambhir combination “an extremely powerful team and a big proposition for winning the T20 World Cup.”Yet, Lobo warned that this strength could ironically make the Asia Cup a “banana peel"".He pointed to Pakistan’s new T20I captain Salman Ali Agha, born in 1993, as a serious contender: “He has got a phenomenal chart. If it comes between Surya and Salman, Sky has a higher chance to win the T20 World Cup, which means Salman can win a smaller tournament like the Asia Cup.”He also mentioned Sri Lanka, under Charith Asalanka, and Afghanistan, led by Rashid Khan, as potential surprises.“India, yes, we are the firm favourites, even astrologically,” Lobo concluded, “but we are not the only favourites. Pakistan, Afghanistan, even Sri Lanka—they all have strong chances.”","Astrologer greenstone lobo predicts india to win the asia cup 2025.

The waiting game: why Martin Necas’s contract talks are taking time

The implications for the Avalanche’s championship window

The Colorado Avalanche are entering a critical moment with forward Martin Necas as training camp approaches. The 26-year-old acquisition, brought in exchange for fan-favorite Mikko Rantanen, represents both opportunity and risk for the Avs. General Manager Chris MacFarland knows Necas’s talent is undeniable, but securing a long-term deal before the season starts is essential for the team’s championship ambitions.Negotiations have hit a pause as Martin Necas and his agent monitor the market closely. Observers point to the ongoing discussions around Minnesota Wild superstar Kirill Kaprizov as a benchmark. While Necas isn’t in the same elite tier, the outcome of Kaprizov’s deal could set expectations for top forwards across the league.A breakout season from Necas without a signed contract could push his asking price above $10 million per year, complicating Colorado’s salary cap strategy. As MacFarland balances his roster and Cale Makar’s upcoming mega-deal, timing is everything.Signing Necas is more than a contract—it’s about cementing the team’s core for the future. The trade for Necas was a calculated gamble aimed at creating a younger, faster forward group, but the full payoff hinges on securing his commitment.A well-negotiated contract ensures the Avalanche maintain flexibility while keeping their title hopes alive. As the season approaches, fans are watching closely to see if Colorado can finalize the deal and unleash Necas’s full potential on the ice.Also Read: Brad Marchand could finish his career with Anaheim Ducks despite Florida Panthers deal, predicts NHL analyst For the latest updates on Necas’s negotiations, Avalanche game schedules, and NHL trade rumors, nhltraderumor.com remains the go-to source for fans seeking expert analysis and real-time insights.

Why the NHL’s decision matters for players and hockey’s image

The path ahead for the players and the league

The NHL is preparing to make a decision in the “relatively near future” on the status of five former Hockey Canada players acquitted in a high-profile sexual assault case. Michael McLeod, Carter Hart, Alex Formenton, Dillon Dube, and Callan Foote were all cleared of charges in July following a trial that captured national attention and reignited discussions about consent and hockey culture in Canada.Despite their acquittal, the five players remain ineligible to play in the NHL while the league continues its internal review. NHL Deputy Commissioner Bill Daly told reporters at the NHL/NHLPA media tour in Las Vegas that “the matter is taken very seriously, and that’s why it’s still under review.” The delay has left the players in a state of uncertainty, unable to resume their professional careers in North America.

Why Sidney Crosby to Canadiens trade is under serious debate

Is Sidney Crosby still the game-changer Montreal needs?

Speculation about Sidney Crosby’s future in the NHL is heating up once again. With two years left on his $17.4 million contract, and after the Pittsburgh Penguins finished near the bottom of the Metropolitan Division last season, trade rumors surrounding the veteran star have gained momentum. His recent game-winning performance for Team Canada at the 4 Nations Face-Off further fueled questions about whether Crosby’s next chapter could be with a Canadian franchise like the Montreal Canadiens.On TSN’s FanDuel OverDrive, analysts Bryan Hayes, Jeff O’Neill, and Jamie McLennan debated what a potential trade package might include. O’Neill argued that the deal “probably starts with Lane Hutson or something,” suggesting the Canadiens could offer top-tier prospects. McLennan countered by emphasizing that draft picks and prospects would likely play a bigger role than established young stars. “I don’t think it’s somebody on their live roster that is playing. Like it’s not Demidov,” he said.Despite differing opinions, Hayes pointed out that cap space wouldn’t be a hurdle, noting Montreal had already cleared $10.5 million in space. The conversation became more pointed when Hayes asked, “Would you do Demidov straight up for Sid right now?” O’Neill replied without hesitation, “Of course.To bring in Sidney Crosby into the fold, to get a couple of years out of him.”At 38 years old, Crosby remains remarkably productive, having scored 31 goals and 84 points in 80 games last season. However, McLennan questioned whether Montreal is realistically positioned to contend for a Stanley Cup in Crosby’s remaining elite window, stating, “Is Montreal a Cup winner in two years? I don’t see that.”Also Read: Brad Marchand could finish his career with Anaheim Ducks despite Florida Panthers deal, predicts NHL analyst As the Canadiens aim to build on their recent playoff return, this debate highlights the tough decisions teams face when balancing immediate star power with long-term development.","Sidney crosby has two years left on his $17.4 million contract with the pittsburgh penguins.
