NEW DELHI: Indian cricketer Rinku Singh suffered a personal tragedy on Friday morning as his father, Shri Khanchand Singh, passed away at Yatharth Hospital in Greater Noida after battling stage-four cancer. The hospital’s PRO confirmed the news, bringing an outpouring of condolences from across the cricketing fraternity.Rinku had briefly left India’s T20 World Cup squad earlier in the tournament to be with his father after his condition worsened following India’s first Super 8 fixture against South Africa. Despite the emotional strain, the left-hander returned swiftly to Chennai to rejoin the squad ahead of the Zimbabwe clash.However, Rinku did not feature in the playing XI against Zimbabwe, with the team opting for Sanju Samson to open alongside Abhishek Sharma. His absence came just hours before the heartbreaking news emerged.Former India spinner Harbhajan Singh expressed his condolences in a heartfelt message on X. “Pained to learn about the demise of Shri Khanchand Singh Ji, father of Rinku Singh. This must be an especially difficult time for Rinku and his family, even as he remains committed to his responsibilities during the T20 World Cup. My heartfelt thoughts and prayers are with him and his loved ones. May Waheguru grant eternal peace to the departed soul and give strength and courage to the bereaved family,” he wrote.India will next travel to Kolkata for their final Super 8 clash against West Indies, but for Rinku, cricket momentarily takes a backseat as he mourns an irreplaceable loss.","Rinku singh's father, shri khanchand singh, passed away on friday morning.

Kyle Anderson reaches a buyout agreement with the Grizzlies

What Kyle Anderson’s buyout agreement means for the Grizzlies and the Timberwolves



Minnesota is turning to a familiar face as the playoff race tightens in the Western Conference. Kyle Anderson is returning to the Timberwolves after reaching a buyout agreement with the Memphis Grizzlies. The veteran forward could be available as soon as Sunday in Denver, giving Minnesota an immediate boost in experience and versatility.The 32-year-old forward knows the system, the locker room, and the stakes. He played a huge role in Minnesota’s run to the Western Conference finals in 2024 and built a reputation for steady play and sharp decision-making. Now, with the Timberwolves sitting at 36 to 23 and holding fifth place in the West, his return arrives at a pivotal point in the season.Kyle Anderson reached a contract buyout with the Memphis Grizzlies, per ESPN’s Shams Charania. The veteran forward is planning to join the Minnesota Timberwolves for the rest of the season.Anderson began the 2025- 26 season with the Utah Jazz before being traded to Memphis as part of the Jaren Jackson Jr. deal. His second stint with the Grizzlies lasted only four games. In that span, he averaged 9.3 points and 3.5 rebounds in 22.3 minutes per contest.For the season across Utah and Memphis, he posted 7.5 points, 3.3 rebounds, and 2.7 assists in 20.4 minutes per game.His path back to Minnesota closes a busy chapter that included stops with Golden State and Miami following his three-year, $27 million deal in 2024. Now, he returns to a franchise where his impact extended beyond the box score.For Minnesota, the move strengthens a roster with postseason ambitions. Anderson averaged 7.3 points, 4.3 rebounds, and 4.5 assists during his previous two seasons with the Timberwolves. He started 46 games in his first year with the team and helped stabilize lineups, adjusting to major roster changes. Coaches consistently valued his court vision, defensive awareness, and leadership.For Memphis, the departure creates a gap in veteran presence. The Grizzlies are developing young talent such as GG Jackson II, Jaylen Wells, and Cedric Coward. Anderson’s experience and defensive instincts could have supported that growth.Minnesota continues the demanding stretch run.","Kyle anderson reached a contract buyout with the memphis grizzlies.

T20 World Cup: Suryakumar Yadav press conference ahead of India vs South Africa

Why Pakistan need to start packing, and book their flights ASAP!

NEW DELHI: It was a must-win game for India to stay alive in the T20 World Cup semifinal race, and they delivered in emphatic fashion. Defending champions India crushed Zimbabwe by 72 runs in their Super Eights clash at Chennai’s MA Chidambaram Stadium, keeping their hopes alive while giving their net run rate a much-needed boost.Batting first, India posted a mammoth 256 for four, thanks to a blazing 55 from opener Abhishek Sharma and an unbeaten 50 from Hardik Pandya. Zimbabwe, who had stunned Australia and Sri Lanka to reach the Super Eights, could only manage 184 for six in reply, leaving India in complete control and setting up a winner-takes-all clash against the West Indies on Sunday.""We wanted to leave everything behind. We didn’t think too much about what we did in the league stage or in the last game in Ahmedabad. Our video analyst had prepared a slide for all the batters and bowlers, highlighting what we’ve done well over the past year. We looked at that, took a lot of positivity from it, and came here with clarity,"" Suryakumar Yadav said after the match.""With contributions from the top order right down to number seven, I think there was hardly anything missing in our performance. To be very honest, we could have been a little more clinical with the ball. But at the end of the day, a win is a win, and we’ll take it as we move forward.""The victory also confirmed South Africa’s place in the semifinals after their nine-wicket win over West Indies.""We’ll definitely tighten a few screws when we go and play the West Indies cricket team.I don’t want to take any credit away from the Zimbabwean batters. I think they batted beautifully. Yes, the wicket was good, but the way they approached the innings — taking their time in the powerplay and then accelerating smartly — was impressive,"" Suryakumar added.India’s left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh starred with the ball, returning 3 for 24 from his four overs. Zimbabwe’s Brian Bennett was left with the consolation of an unbeaten 97, the highest individual score by a Zimbabwean in T20 World Cup history, as his side bowed out of semifinal contention despite a promising start.""Credit goes to them as well. From a bowling point of view, though, we could have been a little smarter with certain options at key moments. In situations like this, we need to be courageous with our decisions. There’s no option other than taking the positive route. Once we reach Kolkata, we’ll sit down and plan properly for that game. For now, it’s about taking a day off, travelling, and relaxing,"" Surya concluded.","Defending champions india crush zimbabwe by 72 runs in their super eights clash.

Is this the end of the T20 World Cup for India? Greenstone Lobo predicts results

NEW DELHI: India’s T20 World Cup campaign roared back to life in emphatic fashion as they crushed Zimbabwe by 72 runs in a virtual knockout, a performance that earned glowing praise from batting legend Sachin Tendulkar . Hailing the team’s character under pressure, Tendulkar declared that “must-win games reveal temperament” after India piled up their highest-ever total in T20 World Cup history.Reeling from a crushing 76-run defeat to South Africa in Ahmedabad that left their net run rate in tatters, India responded with authority. Asked to bat first, they unleashed their most fearless brand of cricket, racing to 256/4 in 20 overs — the highest total of this edition. It was not about one monumental individual score, but collective intent. Every batter in the top order struck at over 150, marking the first instance of the top six scoring 20-plus at such a rate in a T20 World Cup innings.In a post on X, Tendulkar wrote: “Must-win games reveal temperament. 256 revealed plenty! Highest total of this T20 World Cup, and what stood out was the intent throughout the game today. Well played, India, take this rhythm into the next game. Congratulations to Zimbabwe as well on a great tournament!”Half-centuries from Abhishek Sharma (55 off 30) and Hardik Pandya (50 not out off 23), along with Tilak Varma’s blazing unbeaten 44 off 16, powered India’s assault.Zimbabwe fought bravely in reply, finishing at 184/6. Brian Bennett dazzled with an unbeaten 97 off 59, while Sikandar Raza chipped in with 31. Arshdeep Singh (3/24) led India’s bowling effort.Skipper Suryakumar Yadav admitted the bowling could have been “a little more clinical” but lauded the batting display as “heartening.” He revealed the team consciously blocked out the noise after the South Africa loss, drawing confidence from a season-long performance review prepared by the analysts.With a decisive clash against West Indies looming in Kolkata, India have rediscovered belief — and as Tendulkar noted, their temperament when it mattered most.",Sachin tendulkar hails india's character under pressure.

Poll Who do you think was the bigger influence in India’s turnaround against Zimbabwe? Hardik Pandya’s all-round performance Tilak Varma’s explosive cameo at the death

Moments before entering the stadium, India head coach Gautam Gambhir was following the live stream of West Indies vs South Africa on his phone. The fixture carried a lot of weight, and a West Indies win could have ended India's campaign before they took the field against Zimbabwe in Chennai on Thursday. The stakes were high and not only the coach, sitting in his usual front seat on the team bus, but the entire group was tracking the developments in Ahmedabad. The Aulakhs were no different and remained an animated bunch in the team hotel as Darshan Singh Aulakh, Arshdeep's father, didn't mince his words every time a West Indies batter went big.""My family was in the room and when the West Indies batters were hitting,(father was abusing what are they doing). So I was like, it's okay, don't be angry and just enjoy the match and hope South Africa win and we also win our remaining matches. If we play good cricket, the result will take care of itself. Well played to them and thank you to them as well for giving us the chance to decide our result. They played well and now we will try to beat them in the finals,"" said Arshdeep Singh in the mixed-zone media interaction.The West Indies had a terrible start with the bat but bounced back, raising some tension in the Indian camp too. Jason Holder and Romario Shepherd's late onslaught pushed the total from 83/7 to 176/8, and the late fireworks were enough to keep the Men in Blue glued to the action nearly 2,000 kilometres away.India were in a must-win situation in the Super Eight but they surrendered complete control after an ordinary outing against South Africa, which severely damaged their net run-rate. A West Indies win would have kept them mathematically alive but the required outcome would have been far from reachable. Hardik Pandya also revealed that they were ""keeping an eye,"" but focus quickly shifted to their own game once the result came in their favour.""We all were keeping an eye. You know, now it’s all about playing good cricket, backing your skill set, you know, kind of absorbing the pressure and making sure that you put the best foot forward. We were keeping the eye, but at the same point of time, once the game got over, we focused on the fact that this is our game. We need to focus on this,"" said Hardik after winning the man of the match for his all-round performance vs Zimbabwe.South Africa's clinical run-chase returned control to their zone, and the focus shifted back to playing good cricket as they walked out in front of a noisy crowd at the MA Chidambaram Stadium. Whistles weren't allowed but the regular chants and self-instructed Mexican waves kept the atmosphere lively while the two teams battled it out in the middle. The chants of ""Abhishek ko bowling do,"" ""Tilak ko bowling do"" got noisier when mere formalities were left and even the players engaged with the crowd to keep the spirits high in the stands.Tilak played along and instructed the crowd to ask Surya for bowling, rolling his arm over as a signal too. The mood in the camp seemed good and the confidence from a strong batting performance was reflected in their movements on the field during the defence. The entire group chose to keep things simple and focussed on returning to the brand of cricket they have played in the bilaterals preceding the multi-nation tournament.""After the last game, we just as a team and Gautam sir also said the same thing that whatever the situation, just remind what brand of cricket we played since last year and also the New Zealand series and South Africa series the way we played. So whatever the situation, as individuals, just go out there and smile and enjoy the game. At the same point, just look at the team, what the team needs.""Whenever you just see what the team needs, then you won't be under pressure. You always look at the situation, how the wicket is going, all these things come into the mind. You won't see as an individual like I should score runs, all this just goes off from the mind. So that's what we discussed and as an individual we are just focusing on what the team needs and at the end of the day we have done well,"" said Tilak at the post-match presser.Tilak has had starts in the tournament but has lacked fluency, especially intent, in the middle-overs. Because Sanju Samson moved to the top of the order, Ishan Kishan dropped to No. 3, forcing the left-hander to change batting positions and face the challenge of batting at a different number in a completely different situation. From anchoring the previous fixtures, his role shifted to that of the bludgeoner in the death overs, and he played his part perfectly. Coming into bat at 172/4 in the 15th over, Tilak combined with his Mumbai Indians captain Hardik Pandya to accumulate 84 runs off just 31 deliveries, ultimately scoring 44 off only 16 deliveries. It wasn't a role he had played before and his happy to bat wherever the situation and team demands.""I always say that whatever team needs, I'm up for it. So I've done the same role since the last four years in IPL for the Mumbai Indians, and also I've done a few games for the Indian team. So I'm up for it. Whatever the team needs, I'm up. And according to the situation, I can adjust. But as I said before I was just waiting for one innings. So I am really grateful to God for that. The right time it has been given, but I am up for it. I am pretty confident now that going forward I can win the games for the team,"" Tilak explained.India's next fixture against the West Indies at the Eden Gardens is a virtual quarter-final but the mood in the dressing room and hotel rooms, is expected to be relaxed leading up to the must-win clash. Thanks to South Africa and then later to a clinical performance with both bat and ball against Zimbabwe.","India were in a must-win situation in the super eight but they surrendered complete control after an ordinary outing against south africa.

India Playing XI drama: How three players are fighting for two spots | Sanju Samson IN?

India did not just win on Thursday night, they produced one of the most complete batting performances in their T20 World Cup history. The 256 for four against Zimbabwe was their highest total in the tournament and it came with 17 sixes, the joint most India have hit in a T20 World Cup innings, going past the 15 they struck against Australia in Gros Islet in 2024. India have now smashed 63 sixes in this edition, their highest in a single World Cup, with only West Indies on 66 ahead of them overall.What stood out even more was the collective intent. All six Indian batters scored at a strike rate above 150, the first time in T20 World Cup history that six or more players have scored 20-plus runs at that tempo in the same innings. There were only 26 dot balls in the entire 20 overs, equalling the fewest in a completed innings at the tournament. The pressure never dipped and Zimbabwe were forced to chase leather almost throughout. Abhishek Sharma set the tone. After three ducks following his return from illness, he found his rhythm with a 26-ball fifty that reignited India’s charge. Sanju Samson provided early fluency, Ishan Kishan kept the momentum intact and then Hardik Pandya and Tilak Varma delivered the knockout blows. Pandya powered his way to an unbeaten fifty, while Tilak, who had faced questions over his strike rate, hammered 44 off 16 balls at a strike rate of 275.India scored 80 runs in the final five overs to put the game out of reach.Zimbabwe had their own highlight through Brian Bennett’s unbeaten 97, the second highest individual score against India in T20 World Cups after Chris Gayle’s 98 in 2010. Bennett’s assault included a 26-run over off Shivam Dube, whose 46 runs conceded in his first two overs became the most by a bowler at that stage of a T20 World Cup match.In the larger picture, this was India rediscovering their attacking identity after a heavy defeat to South Africa. The sixes, the strike rates and the minimal dot balls all reflected a team that recalibrated quickly and struck back with authority, keeping their semifinal hopes alive in emphatic fashion.","India's 256 for four against zimbabwe was their highest total in the tournament.

NEW DELHI: New Zealand knocked co-hosts Sri Lanka out of the T20 World Cup with a comprehensive 61-run win in Colombo on Wednesday, but the result has also kept Pakistan in contention for a dramatic semi-final qualification. With England already through, the race for the final spot from Super Eights Group 2 will now be decided over the last two matches.Chasing 169, Sri Lanka needed a convincing victory to stay alive but faltered badly, crawling to 107/8 and exiting the tournament with one game still to play. The heavy defeat ended their campaign and confirmed a fifth straight failure to reach the semi-finals since their 2014 title triumph. The win also significantly boosted New Zealand, whose net run rate jumped to a healthy +3.050, putting them in pole position to qualify alongside England.However, Pakistan’s hopes hinge on the outcome of England versus New Zealand in Colombo on Friday. If New Zealand defeat England, they will finish on five points and qualify directly, rendering Pakistan’s final Super Eights clash against Sri Lanka irrelevant.Pakistan’s opportunity opens up only if England beat New Zealand. In that scenario, England will top the group with six points, leaving New Zealand on three and Pakistan with a chance to draw level if they beat Sri Lanka in their final match in Kandy.If Pakistan win and both teams finish on three points, qualification will be decided by net run rate. The current projections underline the scale of the task facing Pakistan.For instance, if England beat New Zealand by 50 runs, Pakistan would need to defeat Sri Lanka by roughly 20 runs to edge ahead on net run rate, assuming a first-innings score of around 170.If Pakistan chase instead, the equation becomes tougher. They would need to complete the chase in approximately 17.5 overs to surpass New Zealand’s net run rate. Any slower victory could still leave them behind the Blackcaps.England’s dominance in the Super Eights has simplified the group standings, but Sri Lanka’s exit has ensured the final semi-finalist will be decided in a tense finish.Pakistan must now deliver not just a win, but a big one — and hope England do them a favour — to keep their World Cup dream alive.","New zealand knocked co-hosts sri lanka out of the t20 world cup with a comprehensive 61-run win in colombo on wednesday.

Charlie McAvoy Believes His Family Deserved Something Good



Charlie McAvoy has endured more adversity over the past year than most players face in a career. The Bruins defenseman dealt with a shoulder injury that became infected after the 4 Nations Face-Off, ending his 2024-25 season. A broken jaw and four lost teeth sidelined him for 11 games this season.Away from hockey, McAvoy's family navigated an undisclosed health concern involving his son, Rhys. The 27-year-old kept those details private but acknowledged the toll it took. Winning Olympic gold in Milan provided relief that extended far beyond the rink.McAvoy spoke with reporters after Team USA's 2-1 overtime victory against Canada, reflecting on what the gold medal meant to his family. The Long Beach, New York, native discussed the conversations he had with his wife, Kiley, leading up to the tournament.The couple understood just how much they needed this moment together. ""We had talked about it leading up to this tournament, just how much has gone on in our lives this year,"" McAvoy said. ""Lot of it is public. But a lot of it not what we've gone through as a family this year.""McAvoy revealed the mindset he carried into the gold medal game.He believed his family had earned the right to celebrate something after months of hardship. ""We just kept in my head that, 'We deserve this. We deserve something good to happen to us,"" he said. ""The McAvoys needed a win this year.""Having his entire family in the stands made the achievement even more meaningful. His wife, son, parents, and friends from his hometown all witnessed the historic victory together. ""This was just amazing for my family to have them there, every one of them,"" McAvoy said.""We all got to celebrate this and enjoy it together. We'll have this memory forever."" McAvoy contributed a pivotal play during the tense third period. With Connor Hellebuyck out of position during a scramble, Tom Wilson flipped a puck toward the open net. McAvoy dashed into the crease and kept it out.""The game was just moving so fast,"" he recalled. ""The pressure was so high. It would have definitely gone in if I hadn't been there."" The moment connected McAvoy to the 1980 Miracle on Ice team he grew up idolizing.He knows Mike Eruzione through their Boston University connection and understands his generation now carries that same legacy forward. ""I put that on par with the Stanley Cup,"" McAvoy said. ""I did one. I can say I'm a winner now.""The Bruins need that winning mentality as they resume their playoff push. Boston holds the second wild card spot in the Eastern Conference with a 32-20-5 record and 69 points.

Owen Tippett: Philadelphia Flyers Face Critical Decision on Owen Tippett Before Trade Deadline,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/philadelphia-flyers-face-critical-decision-on-owen-tippett-before-trade-deadline/articleshow/128820523.cms,"Owen Tippett with the Philadelphia Flyers (Via Getty Images)

Owen Tippett remains Philadephia Flyers’ most consistent goal scorer



The Philadelphia Flyers have nine days to decide whether Owen Tippett belongs in their long-term plans. The 26-year-old winger currently carries no trade protection in his contract, but that changes next season when a no-movement clause kicks in for the 2026-27 campaign.One insider, however, has listed Tippett as a trade candidate on February 27, highlighting the contractual timing that makes this deadline particularly significant for the Flyers forward. But if the Flyers want to get to a long playoff run, they will need to be sure about the winger.Tippett has proven he can put the puck in the net at the NHL level. The winger has posted three consecutive 20-goal seasons and looks poised to reach the milestone again this year. But to ESPN Greg Wyshynski, that’s not all.In a recent segment, he gave his take on the trade rumors circulating about Tippett. ""Is Tippett's name being out there just noise or something more palpable?"" Wyshynski wrote. ""Everything we've heard is that the Flyers might move him in the right hockey trade to help the club.""But while his goalscoring makes him a hot commodity, he carries a hefty $6.2 million cap hit active through 2031-32.With 19 goals and 35 points in 57 games so far, his contributions remain good enough for teams to consider a long-term commitment.The Peterborough, Ontario native has accumulated 112 career goals and 108 assists across 404 games with the Flyers and Panthers. Florida originally selected him in the first round before trading him to Philadelphia.But while Tippett remains a concern, Philadelphia enters the final weeks of the regular season on a 3-6-1 slide over its last 10 games. The Flyers sit at 25-21-11 with 61 points, eight points behind the New York Islanders in the Metropolitan Division standings.The organization must weigh whether Tippett fits their timeline as they continue developing young talent around Matvei Michkov and Travis Konecny. Trading him now provides maximum flexibility and return value before the protection clause limits potential destinations.Moving Tippett after this season becomes significantly more complicated. Teams pursuing him would need to appear on his approved list, narrowing the market and potentially reducing the return Philadelphia could receive.The March 6 deadline at 3 p.m. ET looms large for general manager Daniel Briere. Tippett's name has not circulated heavily in trade rumors, but the contractual situation makes him worth monitoring as the deadline approaches.Philadelphia must determine whether it wants Tippett anchoring their wing for the next half-decade or whether his value peaks right now.",The philadelphia flyers have nine days to decide whether owen tippett belongs in their long-term plans.

Playing at the same venue



Facing spin



Team news



New Zealand middle-order batter Mark Chapman looked perplexed when he was asked about the Super Eight groups, where all four table-toppers, who have done well in their respective groups, will end up facing each other. It has been done because of the pre-tournament seedings.The 31-year-old smiled and replied, “When it comes to scheduling and planning, that’s not really in my domain.”Chapman’s response sums up the way New Zealand play their cricket. No fuss, no theatrics, just straight down to business.After playing three matches in Chennai and one in Ahmedabad, all on red-soil pitches, the Kiwis had only one training session to adapt to the conditions ahead of their first Super Eight match against Pakistan at the R Premadasa Stadium.None of them rushed towards the pitch for a closer look. Once warm-ups were done, the players moved to the indoor nets. About an hour later, Daryl Mitchell came out barefoot to inspect the surface, spending a good fifteen minutes studying every inch of the 22 yards.Chapman, who did not get to see the surface, left it to the senior leadership group.“In the subcontinent, the toss always plays a factor depending on the conditions.I haven’t seen the pitch yet, so I don’t actually know what it looks like. There will be discussions behind the scenes with the senior leadership group about what we want to do,” he said.The black-soil pitches in Colombo do assist spinners, and with bigger boundaries and a slower outfield, it presents a new challenge for the 2021 T20 World Cup finalists.“We haven’t played in Sri Lanka yet. A lot of guys in our team have played a lot of cricket here, so I don’t see that playing too much of a factor. Guys understand what they need to do, and we are confident we will face whatever conditions are in front of us,” said Chapman, whose knees were heavily strapped.“In India, particularly on red-soil pitches, conditions have been favourable for batting. It has been tough for the bowlers, and the margins have been very small. We have seen scores close to 200 regularly.“Here, it is slightly different with the slower nature of the pitches. The bowlers will hopefully get a chance to show their skills, and spinners are more likely to play a part here,” he added.Although Pakistan are stationed in Sri Lanka, they played their group matches at two different venues in Colombo.New Zealand will be the only team playing all their Super Eight matches at the same venue, facing Pakistan on February 21, Sri Lanka on February 25, and England on February 27, all at the R Premadasa Stadium.“One of the challenges in tournaments like these is hopping from venue to venue and adapting. When we play three games at the same place, we learn with each game.“It is nice to turn up at the same venue with similar pitches and adjust. Tomorrow is our first game here, so we will have to adapt anyway, but we will understand the conditions better as we go,” he said.New Zealand’s first challenge will be Pakistan’s spin-heavy attack. Usman Tariq, Abrar Ahmad, Mohammad Nawaz, Saim Ayub, and Shadab Khan form a strong unit.“Pakistan have a number of very good spinners, each with their own threat. We have played them quite frequently over the last few years.“We are well aware of what they will bring. For us, it is about being really clear in how we want to play against them,” he said.Obviously, there was a Usman Tariq question: “Usman Tariq has a unique action with the way he pauses at the crease, so that is something to factor in.""Chapman, whose role is to take on spinners in the middle overs, explained why running between the wickets will be crucial.“Given the slower pitch and bigger boundaries, you have to change your game plan. Against spinners, it is about different options like the sweep or reverse sweep. In India, you can target straight boundaries more.“For me, it is about finding different areas of the ground. There are big pockets here, so it is not all about sixes. Twos, fours, and running between the wickets are very important, especially if it is not a high-scoring game,” he said.New Zealand have suffered injury setbacks. Michael Bracewell has been ruled out of the remainder of the tournament after re-injuring his left calf. Captain Mitchell Santner missed the last group match against Canada due to illness, while Lockie Ferguson returned home for the birth of his first child.“Mitchell Santner looks pretty sprightly and excited to get back on the park, barring any last-minute illness.“Lockie has just returned and is coming off a long flight. We will see how he pulls up. I cannot confirm whether he will be in the playing eleven,” Chapman said.","New zealand will be the only team playing all their super eight matches at the same venue, facing pakistan on february 21, sri lanka on february 25, and england on february 27.

Former India wicketkeeper-batter Dinesh Karthik has praised Jammu and Kashmir pacer Auqib Nabi for his performance in the 2025-26 Ranji Trophy, saying his campaign stands out among recent fast-bowling efforts in domestic cricket.Posting on X, Karthik urged young cricketers to follow Nabi's example if they aim to represent India.""Watching this Ranji Trophy campaign and following it closely, one thing I can say for certain, for all the young boys and girls out there playing this sport and wanting to represent the country -- do it the AQUIB NABI way,"" Karthik wrote.Karthik said he could not recall a pacer in recent years who had controlled a season in similar fashion.""Can't think of any pacer/player in a long time doing what he's done. Domination from start to end and almost single-handedly winning the domestic tournament that matters the most to get into the national side,"" Karthik wrote.He also highlighted Nabi’s endurance and consistency across conditions.""Fitness across the whole campaign, bowling those long spells and across different soils, weather conditions, and whether there's been any help for a pacer or not, he's been there for his team with the belief every time he's had the ball to STRIKE for his team,"" Karthik posted.Praising his mindset, Karthik added:""Hats off to you AQUIB, you're an absolute champion and hope you get a lot of success that comes your way, and may you be the lesson on.

His tally includes two four-wicket hauls and six five-wicket hauls.Meanwhile, Jammu and Kashmir were in a strong position against eight-time champions Karnataka at stumps on Day 3 of the Ranji Trophy 2025-26 final at the KSCA Hubli Cricket Ground.Jammu and Kashmir posted 584 in 173.1 overs in their first innings.

New Zealand, led by skipper Mitchell Santner, will take on England, led by Harry Brook, in a Super 8 T20 World Cup match on Friday. The game is important for the Black Caps, who want to secure a spot in the semi-finals.England are already through after winning their first two Super 8 matches—a 51-run win over Sri Lanka and a two-wicket victory against Pakistan. New Zealand impressed with a 61-run win over Sri Lanka, boosting their net run-rate to +3.050. To advance, the Kiwis just need to avoid a heavy loss. They have also shown they handle spin well, having beaten Sri Lanka despite facing six spinners.Brook and Will Jacks have been solid against Pakistani spinners like Saim Ayub, Mohammed Nawaz, and Shadab Khan. New Zealand’s Santner, Rachin Ravindra, Glenn Phillips, and Cole McConchie could be more effective on a slightly slower Premadasa track. Brook is in form, with a match-winning hundred against Pakistan, while veteran Jos Buttler is expected to step up after a quiet tournament. At the same time, England’s Jacks (off-spin) and Liam Dawson (left-arm spin) can challenge the Kiwi batsmen.At Premadasa, a total of 165–175 could be enough to win if the spinners are effective.""You're always confident going into these fixtures, especially when we know what the surface is going to be like, but I think it'd be silly to underestimate England at any point,"" Black Caps all-rounder Rachin Ravindra said after his match-winning performance against Sri Lanka on Wednesday.""They're obviously such a quality unit, and they've shown this in bowling, and how well they've been bowling.

Every game drains you. The intensity is seriously high and you know things can change very quickly in T20 cricket. You wake up the next morning and it can all be over in a couple of days.”Markram credited the bowlers for keeping the big hitting West Indies to 176/8. He was effusive in his praise for allrounder Corbin Bosch , who nailed perfect yorkers in the final over and gave away just five runs. “He keeps it really simple, trains smartly and doesn’t give himself too many options,” Markram said.West Indies captain Shai Hope backed the aggressive batting approach even though the top order collapsed on Thursday. “There’s always some element of risk whenever you’re batting. So if you want to challenge the opposition, then you’ve got to find runs, especially on a surface like that which is so good. You still have to measure the risks in some way. If we just bat deep and only get 150-160 on a surface like that, it is always going to be tough work,” Hope said.",South africa have emerged as a strong contender for the world cup title.

T20 World Cup: Ryan Burl press conference before India vs Zimbabwe

NEW DELHI: Strike rate 331.58. Seven fours. Five sixes. That is not just a stat line — it is a statement. And it had the unmistakable stamp of Vaibhav Sooryavanshi all over it.The young India star once again lived up to his reputation of taking bowlers apart from the very first ball, hammering a breathtaking 19-ball 63 for DY Patil Blue against Indian Navy in the ongoing DY Patil T20 Cup. With IPL 2026 just over a month away, the timing of this assault could not have been more ominous.Chasing 220, Vaibhav wasted no time settling in. Sixteen runs came off the first four deliveries he faced. By the end of just 12 balls, he was already on 43 — bowlers scrambling, fielders scattered, and the tempo of the game firmly hijacked.His half-century arrived in the fifth over — a six followed by a four — in just 14 deliveries. He added another towering maximum before walking back for 63 off 19 balls, striking at a staggering 331.58.For those who have followed his rise, this is hardly surprising.Vaibhav first shook the IPL in 2025 when he blasted a 35-ball hundred against Gujarat Titans, becoming the youngest centurion in the league’s history and the fastest Indian to a century in the tournament. That innings announced the arrival of a new-age aggressor — fearless, unapologetic, and relentlessly attacking.His dominance continued in the Under-19 circuit. In 25 Youth ODIs, he piled up 1,412 runs at an average of 56.48 and a remarkable strike rate of 165.72. Four centuries and seven fifties followed, including a stunning 175 off just 80 balls in the U19 World Cup final — an innings that sealed India’s triumph.Even off the field, Vaibhav has done things differently. He made headlines for skipping his Class X board exams to prioritise cricket — a decision that now seems vindicated by the numbers.In 18 T20s so far, he has amassed 701 runs at a strike rate of 204.37, crossing 150 in 12 innings — a testament to his consistency in high-tempo cricket.At the DY Patil T20 Cup, he simply carried that momentum forward.While Kuwar Pathak’s 87 and Nitin Tanwar’s unbeaten 57 powered Indian Navy to 220, the spotlight inevitably swung back to Vaibhav. Yash Dhull (12 off 8), Sarfaraz Khan (27 off 19), Shashank Singh (20 off 12), Anand Bais (35* off 24) and Arjun Tendulkar (55* off 29) all chipped in — but it was Vaibhav’s blitz that set the tone.And if this was meant to be a warm-up ahead of IPL 2026, bowlers across franchises would be watching closely.Also See: IND vs ZIM Live Score",Vaibhav sooryavanshi smashes 63 off 19 balls in dy patil t20 cup.
