India T20 World Cup Qualification Scenario

Scenario 1 – India win both matches

Scenario 2 – India win one match

Team India’s hopes of reaching the T20 World Cup 2026 semi-finals have taken a serious hit after a crushing 76-run defeat to South Africa in their opening Super 8 fixture in Ahmedabad on Sunday. Led by Suryakumar Yadav , India were thoroughly outplayed as the Proteas dominated both innings.South Africa, after opting to bat first, posted a commanding 187/7. David Miller anchored the innings with a fluent 63, while Dewald Brevis provided momentum with a brisk 45. Despite Jasprit Bumrah ’s impressive spell of 3/15, India were unable to prevent South Africa from finishing strongly.The chase unravelled quickly. India never settled into any rhythm and were eventually bowled out for just 111. Marco Jansen was the chief destroyer with four wickets, sealing a comprehensive win and inflicting major damage on India’s Net Run Rate, which now stands at -3.800.The defeat leaves India in a must-win situation. They need victories in both of their remaining Super 8 matches against West Indies and Zimbabwe to ensure qualification for the Final Four. Even then, scenarios could complicate matters.If India secure wins in both fixtures, they will finish with four points.In most cases, that should be enough to qualify. However, complications arise if South Africa win only one of their remaining matches and the winner of the West Indies vs Zimbabwe clash also defeats South Africa. In that situation, three teams could end up on four points, pushing qualification to Net Run Rate calculations. Ideally for India, South Africa winning both of their remaining matches would simplify the equation and reduce reliance on NRR.If India manage just one win, they will require South Africa to win all their remaining games. Additionally, India’s sole victory must come against the winner of the West Indies vs Zimbabwe contest. That outcome would leave India, West Indies and Zimbabwe level on two points each, once again making Net Run Rate the deciding factor.India now find themselves under immense pressure. A defeat alone may not have been disastrous, but the scale of the loss and the severe blow to their Net Run Rate have left their campaign hanging by a thread.",India lost to south africa by 76 runs in their opening super 8 fixture. The defeat leaves india in a must-win situation. They need victories in both of their remaining super 8 matches against west indies and zimbabwe to ensure qualification for the final four.

Jack Hughes scores winner as Quinn Hughes, Connor Hellebuyck and Dylan Larkin celebrate historic Team USA hockey gold medal

Quinn Hughes could barely stand still, but Team USA did not mind one bit. Just minutes after the United States beat Canada 2-1 in overtime to win the gold medal, Hughes went live on NBC and looked like he had already started the party. The 26-year-old defenseman slurred his words while speaking to NBC host Mike Tirico. His brother Jack Hughes and goalie Connor Hellebuyck stood close, almost holding him up as he talked.The United States had just won its first Olympic men’s hockey gold medal since the 1980 “Miracle on Ice.” So the mood was loud, proud, and emotional. During the interview, Quinn Hughes thanked “our troops for allowing us to play this game” and repeated the line twice. He also thanked fans back home and called the moment “very special.” Before it ended, teammate Dylan Larkin jumped in with a drink in his hand and shouted hello to Mike Tirico.The wild interview came right after Jack Hughes scored the overtime goal that sealed the win against Canada. It was a tight game from start to finish, but the United States found the final push when it mattered most.Later, at the postgame press conference, the players were calmer and more clear.Jack Hughes spoke about the long road to this moment. “Your whole life you’re always going up against things,” he said. “There’s always new challenges. Every single player in that game went through so many things. It’s a journey, the whole lifetime of work. I’m just a part of that.”Head coach Mike Sullivan said the team could feel support from back home. He shared that many fans woke up early to watch the game from the United States. He even said the president was watching.Soon after the win, President Donald Trump called the team to congratulate them. “Congratulations, that was an unbelievable game,” Trump told the players. He invited them to the White House and also asked them to attend the State of the Union address on February 24. The team said they planned to celebrate first in Miami.The celebration was loud. The party was real. And Quinn Hughes’ interview showed just how much the gold medal meant to Team USA.","Quinn hughes slurred his words while speaking to nbc host mike tirico.

Scenario 1 – India win both matches

Scenario 2 – India win one match

NEW DELHI: Team India’s road to the T20 World Cup 2026 semi-finals has become significantly tougher after a heavy 76-run defeat to South Africa in their opening Super 8 clash in Ahmedabad on Sunday. Placed in Group 1 alongside South Africa, West Indies and Zimbabwe, India slipped into early trouble in the second phase of the tournament.In the other Group 1 fixture, West Indies registered a dominant 107-run win over Zimbabwe to move to the top of the table. Following that result, South Africa sit second, while India have dropped to third, with their Net Run Rate taking a massive hit.Under the leadership of Suryakumar Yadav, India were outclassed in all departments. After choosing to bat, South Africa piled up an imposing 187/7. David Miller led the charge with a composed 63, while Dewald Brevis injected momentum with a quickfire 45. Jasprit Bumrah stood out with figures of 3/15, but the rest of the attack struggled to contain the flow of runs.India’s response never gathered steam. Regular wickets derailed the chase, and the batting line-up failed to build partnerships. Marco Jansen ripped through the middle order with a four-wicket haul as India were bundled out for 111.The comprehensive defeat not only handed South Africa two crucial points but also left India with a worrying Net Run Rate of -3.800.With two matches remaining, India are now in a must-win situation.If India beat both West Indies and Zimbabwe, they will finish on four points. And if South Africa win all their matches, both India and South Africa will qualify for the semis.If India win both matches and South Africa lose one of their games, three teams could end up tied on four points.

Gautam Gambhir’s animated chat with Abhishek Sharma goes viral; Team India lands in Chennai

NEW DELHI: Former Pakistan fast bowler Shoaib Akhtar slammed India’s bowling attack after their heavy 76-run loss to South Africa in the T20 World Cup Super 8 match. He said the defeat exposed how fragile India’s bowling unit is, especially against strong batting line-ups like the Proteas.Akhtar was particularly critical of Hardik Pandya and Shivam Dube, who gave away 67 runs in six overs for just one wicket. He felt they lacked pace and intimidation, and that using them in the death overs was a tactical mistake.“Hardik and Shivam Dube were bowling at around 120 kmph. It’s not as if they are Malcolm Marshall — someone who would intimidate a batting line-up of South Africa’s calibre. If you deploy them in the death overs, such a counterattack from the Proteas is inevitable,” he said on Tapmad.He also pointed out that India’s bowling looked vulnerable overall, with South African batters dominating even the team’s key bowlers.Akhtar highlighted Varun Chakaravarthy’s expensive spell, saying his usual pace was down and that he was punished by the batters.“Indian bowling has been exposed. If you look at Varun, whose strength is bowling at 97-98 kmph, he was clocking 94. And when he came into the attack, he was hit for a no-look six by Dewald Brevis,” he added.Akhtar suggested that India should bring Kuldeep Yadav into the team, calling him the “missing link” who can trick batters and take wickets at crucial moments. “The missing link here is Kuldeep Yadav. He is someone who can deceive batters in the air and pick up wickets when needed. He is a proven match-winner.”He also felt that Varun Chakaravarthy and Washington Sundar offer similar skills, making India’s bowling attack predictable and easier for top teams to attack.","Shoaib akhtar slams hardik pandya, shivam dube after india's defeat to south africa.

A four-year-old post by former South Africa batter Herschelle Gibbs, who worked with Babar Azam at Karachi Kings in the Pakistan Super League (PSL), is doing the rounds on social media. Gibbs had urged Babar to add a couple of attacking shots to his game to improve his strike rate. In a reply to one of the fans, he also took a jibe at Babar’s reluctance to seek advice. “He’s very much in his own world with his batting, not open to many suggestions,” Gibbs had written.In every Pakistan nets session, Babar cuts a lonely figure. He pads up and bats, and the only cricketer who speaks to him for advice is Abrar Ahmad, who made his international debut under Babar. For Shadab Khan , Babar is still the skipper, as he keeps calling “skip” before bowling to him in the nets.Babar remains a leader in the group, but he has lost his aura after failing to evolve his game. He has played four T20 World Cups and has not hit a single six since the 10-wicket win against India in Dubai in 2021, when Varun Chakravarthy was the bowler.In 2025, he was dropped from the T20I setup, with coach Mike Hesson stating that Babar needed strong performances in the Big Bash League (BBL) to earn a recall. After Pakistan’s loss to India in the Asia Cup, Babar was brought back.However, his poor run for the Sydney Sixers, where he scored just 202 runs in 11 innings at a strike rate of 103.06, sparked intense debate over his inclusion in the T20 World Cup squad.Fans, coaches, and former cricketers have all trained their fire on him.Despite the criticism, the 31-year-old remains the leading run-scorer in T20Is, with 4,571 runs. No batter has crossed fifty more often in the format’s 21-year history, doing so 39 times, along with three hundreds. His 475 fours are also the most by any batter. Yet the numbers that matter most in T20s paint a harsher picture. A strike rate of 128.18 strips him of any claim to all-time greatness and is the lowest among batters with at least 3,500 runs in the format.In the pre-match press conference ahead of Pakistan’s washed-out game against New Zealand, Hesson did not hold back while addressing Babar’s powerplay strike rate and backed his stance with numbers. “Babar is well aware that his strike rate in the powerplay is below 100 in T20 World Cups,” Hesson said.Across the four T20 World Cups Babar has played, he has faced 217 balls in the powerplay for 187 runs. His strike rate of 86.17 is the lowest among batters who have faced a minimum of 200 deliveries in that phase.Babar did not even come out to bat against Namibia at his newly designated No. 4 position. Instead, Khawaja Nafay and then Shadab Khan were sent out, marking the first time in Babar’s T20I career that he did not bat.After the Namibia match, Shadab defended the decision and spoke about the clarity within the group. “Babar knows exactly when his role comes into play. The messages are clear for every player. The team changes according to conditions, and that’s what is happening,” he said.A few days later, Hesson further explained Babar’s role. “We brought Babar back for a specific role post the Asia Cup. We wanted stability through the middle, and he gives us that. When we reached the 12th over the other day, Babar was not the best option. We had players better suited for the end. Babar understands that. He knows his skill set and also knows when others can perform that role more efficiently,” Hesson said.During nets in Kandy on a humid Monday afternoon, Babar was seen batting mostly against the left-arm spin of Mohammad Nawaz and a local net bowler. Hesson stayed close, constantly talking to him. Instead of the wild slog he attempted against Axar Patel in Colombo, Babar worked on playing with the spin and executed a few elegant inside-out shots.Power has never been Babar’s game. He mastered the anchor role, but in modern T20 cricket, that role has lost relevance. Teams now demand momentum in the powerplay. Pakistan, however, have persisted with anchors at the top. Whether it was Babar or his former opening partner Mohammad Rizwan, the strategy often ended up increasing pressure on the rest of the batting order due to slow scoring rates.Babar was once tipped as the “King” of Pakistan cricket. Comparisons with Virat Kohli were constant, and for a brief period, he was mentioned alongside Steve Smith, Kane Williamson, Kohli, and Joe Root as part of the modern greats. That peak, however, did not last, and now with every match he is becoming the ""match ka mujrim"" for Pakistan.Former Pakistan captain Rashid Latif believes Babar’s second removal as captain has left a mental scar. “He should not have taken the captaincy again after being removed the first time. That was a mistake. The second sacking dented his confidence,” Latif told TimesofIndia.com.At 31, Babar stands at a career crossroads. The talent is unquestioned, but the demands of modern T20 cricket have moved faster than his evolution. With spin expected to dominate in Kandy, the likely recall of Abrar Ahmad, and the need for a left-hander such as Fakhar Zaman in the top order, Babar’s place is no longer guaranteed. Even if he plays, his role is shrinking. The crown he once wore comfortably now sits uneasily, and time is no longer on his side.","Herschelle gibbs' social media post on babar azam has been doing the rounds.

Why India are in deep trouble | T20 World Cup 2026 | India vs South Africa

The Super 8 stage of the T20 World Cup has begun with dramatic shifts in momentum, as both groups take early shape following a series of decisive results.In Group 1, West Indies hold the top spot after a commanding 107-run win over Zimbabwe on Monday. Windies also have a stunning net run rate of +5.350 after the record win - their biggest in the T20 World Cup history. The big defeat left Zimbabwe at the bottom of the group.South Africa now occupy the second spot after a commanding 76-run win over defending champions India at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad. The Proteas have two points and a formidable Net Run Rate of +3.800. It was a statement performance from the side that lost to India in the 2024 final. After posting 187/7, powered by David Miller’s 63 off 35 balls, South Africa bowled India out for just 111 in 18.5 overs. Left-arm pacer Marco Jansen starred with figures of 4-22 in 3.5 overs, ending India’s 12-match winning streak in T20 World Cups.India, meanwhile, are placed third following their heavy defeat and a damaging NRR of -3.800, leaving their semi-final hopes under immediate pressure.Group 2 has also seen clear early movement. England lead the standings after a 51-run victory over Sri Lanka in Pallekele.They have two points and a healthy NRR of +2.550. Phil Salt anchored England’s innings with a composed 62 off 40 balls, guiding them to 146-9, while Will Jacks added late impetus and later struck three wickets in the powerplay as Sri Lanka collapsed to 95 all out.Pakistan and New Zealand are placed second and third respectively, with one point each after their match was washed out due to rain. Sri Lanka sit bottom of the group with a NRR of -2.550.The race for the semi-finals is well and truly underway.",The super 8 stage of the t20 world cup has begun with dramatic shifts in momentum.

Inside Pakistan’s intense nets session in Kandy ahead of their Super Eight clash against England

England left-arm spinner Liam Dawson insisted the two-time champions will not be consumed by the buzz around Pakistan’s mystery spinner Usman Tariq ahead of Tuesday’s crucial T20 World Cup Super Eights encounter. He stressed that England are preparing for Pakistan’s entire spin unit rather than focusing on one individual threat.England head into the contest on the back of a convincing 51-run win over co-hosts Sri Lanka. Another victory against Pakistan would seal a top-two finish in their Super Eights group and confirm a semifinal berth.However, there are concerns over England’s susceptibility to spin after four of their top five batters were dismissed by Sri Lankan spinners in their previous outing — an issue that could be tested against a Pakistan attack featuring Tariq, Shadab Khan, Abrar Ahmed, Saim Ayub, Salman Agha and Mohammad Nawaz.Tariq has drawn attention throughout the tournament for his unusual action, including a pronounced pause before delivering his off-breaks. England captain Harry Brook was even seen imitating Tariq’s bowling style during practice. Despite the spotlight on the Pakistani spinner, Dawson underlined the importance of a balanced approach.“It’s not all about Tariq. They’re a very good team with some dangerous players, and Tariq’s obviously a very good bowler.But we’re not going to just look at him. We’ll look at the whole team and see how we can nullify them,” Dawson told reporters on the eve of the match.Dawson played a key role in England’s win over Sri Lanka, combining with Will Jacks and Adil Rashid to claim seven wickets as Sri Lanka were dismissed for 95 while chasing 146/9. He pointed to the diversity within England’s spin attack as a major strength.""We're all very different types of spinners. Jacksy gets a lot of overspin and a lot of bounce. Dilly (Rashid) has all his variations. Me - I sort of don't get the bounce that the other two get. It will be a different challenge on Tuesday night. We might get a better batting wicket. We'll have to see.""“Out of the three or four of us, I’m probably more the defensive spinner in this, and I know that’s my role, and I’m just trying to be consistent for the captain. Adil can use all his tricks, and he comes on us to get the wickets and get us back in games or put us ahead in games.“We’re all very experienced. If you look at the amount of cricket that me and Adil have played, even Jacks as well, it’s probably only with Beth that’s probably got a little bit less experience. But there’s a lot of trust in the guys that go out there and try to execute what you want to try and do,” he added.",Liam dawson insists england will not be consumed by buzz around usman tariq.

In the NFL, a fumble can cost you a game. But for New England Patriots star Stefon Diggs , fans are convinced a recent ""fumble"" might have cost him something much bigger- a future with Grammy-winning superstar Cardi B The 2026 offseason was supposed to be about Diggs chasing a ring, but instead, the only thing trending is his relationship status. After a high-profile romance that saw the pair welcome a baby boy in November 2025, the ""it"" couple of the sports world seems to have hit a massive dead end following Super Bowl LX.It all started on Super Bowl Sunday. While Diggs was battling it out on the field, eagle-eyed fans noticed Cardi B wasn't her usual ""number one fan"" self. After performing a high-energy halftime set, Cardi reportedly vanished from the stadium, skipping the post-game festivities entirely.By Monday morning, the digital receipts were in: the two had hit the ""unfollow"" button on Instagram. In the world of celebrity gossip, that’s not just a yellow flag, that’s a full-on ejection from the game.The internet, as usual, had a field day. The ""fumbled"" memes started flooding X (formerly Twitter) almost immediately.Between Diggs’ lackluster stats in the Super Bowl and the rumors of a messy breakup involving an alleged hotel room guest, fans haven't been kind.one viral post read.Others have pointed out the irony of the situation, noting that Diggs had teased an engagement proposal just days before the big game. Talk about a ""Hail Mary"" that didn't connect!Cardi B isn't one to stay quiet for long. During hertour stop in Los Angeles, she threw a bit of shade and a bit of protection toward her ex. While responding to a diss from fellow rapper BIA, Cardi told the screaming crowd:While she’s clearly moving on and focusing on her tour, she made it clear that while they might be ""over,"" the respect (or at least the family tie) remains.As of late February 2026, Diggs is reportedly trying to ""work his way back"" into Cardi’s good graces, but insiders say she’s currently ""building a wall."" Whether this is a permanent split or just a very public timeout, one thing is certain: Stefon Diggs is currently in the middle of the most scrutinized ""replay review"" of his life.","Stefon diggs and cardi b split after super bowl lx.

J2hundred’s arrest before Tottenham Hotspur vs Arsenal Premier League match raises questions about ‘Yid army’ chant





J2hundred did not expect his football prank to end in handcuffs. But that is exactly what happened on February 22, 2026, in Tottenham, just hours before the North London derby between Tottenham Hotspur and Arsenal. The Kick streamer was walking through the streets near the stadium wearing a red Arsenal shirt. Around him were Tottenham fans getting ready for the big match. Police officers were already present to control the crowd.At first, J2hundred appeared to be joking with supporters while streaming live. Some fans shouted back at him. A few threw drinks. Officers nearby were watching closely and taking notes. Moments later, after J2 shouted “Yid army,” the mood changed. An officer stepped in and said, “Can you nick him? He’s used the word ‘Yid army,’ which is illegal, so it’s a public order, let’s get him out of here.” He was then placed in handcuffs on camera.J2hundred, who has more than 250,000 subscribers on YouTube, is known for street videos around London. His channel features music clips and public pranks. One of his most watched videos, “Trick or Treating with a Gang of Roadmen !,” has nearly four million views.Police had appeared in that video as well.On Sunday, his plan was simple. He and his friend Maciej walked around Tottenham wearing Arsenal jerseys to get reactions from rival fans before the Tottenham Hotspur versus Arsenal Premier League match. As expected, some Spurs fans reacted loudly. Police were already monitoring the area because derby matches can get tense.During the stream, J2 noticed an officer writing in a notebook and asked, “What notes are you taking down?” The officer replied, “I’m just writing stuff down.” J2 responded, “Well, it’s not like we’re doing anything.” The officer answered, “Well, you are.” The exchange seemed calm at that point.Things shifted when J2 shouted, “Yid army! Yid army!” Tottenham supporters have long used that phrase about their team. However, the word “Yid” is widely known as a slur against Jewish people. Because of that history, police treated the chant as a possible public order offense.As officers moved him away, J2 said, “Wait, Yid army is their team.” He later added, “I wasn’t trying to aggravate anyone, I don’t think it’s fair. If you’d asked me to leave, I would’ve left. I didn’t even know that was a racist chant. I’ve never heard that before. The last time I came to a Tottenham match, they were singing it, so I sang it as well.”After he was taken away, Maciej continued the stream briefly before it ended. Later, on Instagram Stories, Maciej wrote, “J2 is still in cells and has given me permission to post on his behalf. #FREEJ2.” As of now, there has been no confirmed public update about his release.","J2hundred, who has more than 250,000 subscribers on youtube, is known for street videos around london.

Jermod McCoy

Kayden McDonald

The 2026 NFL Scouting Combine is set to begin in Indianapolis , bringing together more than 300 of the best college football players in front of coaches, scouts, and executives from all 32 NFL teams. The event is one of the most important steps in the pre-draft process, giving prospects the chance to showcase their athletic ability and meet teams.For many players, the combine can significantly change draft projections. With the 2026 NFL Draft approaching, several names are already drawing attention as potential risers depending on how they perform this week. According to Nate Tice of Yahoo Sports , Auburn edge rusher Keldric Faulk is widely seen as one of the top defensive prospects in the class. His size, length, and versatility allow him to line up across the defensive front. Scouts will closely watch his speed and agility testing, which could determine whether he becomes a top-10 pick.Texas Tech pass rusher David Bailey is known for his explosiveness off the edge and strong production. The combine gives him a chance to prove he can maintain that burst against elite competition and improve his stock as a potential first-round selection.Ohio State safety Caleb Downs has earned praise for his instincts and tackling ability. Teams see him as a modern defensive chess piece who can play multiple roles. A strong showing in coverage drills could make him one of the first defensive backs taken.Miami offensive lineman Francis Mauigoa is considered a powerful blocker with long-term starter potential. His movement drills will be important in deciding whether teams see him as a tackle or a guard at the next level.Sonny Styles made a smooth transition from safety to linebacker at Ohio State. His rare combination of size and speed makes him an intriguing prospect. If he tests well, he could enter the conversation as a top defensive pick.Miami’s Rueben Bain Jr has built a reputation as a disruptive edge defender who wins with power and technique. Scouts will be watching his burst and flexibility, which could separate him from other pass rushers.Another Ohio State defender, Arvell Reese, has impressed with his athleticism and versatility. His ability to rush the passer and play off the ball gives him a strong upside if his testing numbers match his film.Oregon tight end Kenyon Sadiq is viewed as a dynamic receiving threat. During drills, his speed and route running may really shine out, making him one of the more fascinating offensive prospects to keep an eye on.Tennessee cornerback Jermod McCoy missed the 2025 season because of an injury, thus workouts and medical evaluations will be very important. He might swiftly go up the boards if he proves he is completely healthy.Kayden McDonald, a defensive tackle for Ohio State, is recognized for being strong and stopping runs. Teams will want to see how explosive he is in tests, which might show how good he is at disrupting things in the middle.The 2026 NFL Combine will be a big part of draft talks because so many outstanding players will be there. A great week might mean the difference between a good pick and hearing their name called considerably earlier on draft night for these athletes.",The 2026 nfl scouting combine is set to begin in indianapolis.

Playing at the same venue



Facing spin



Team news



New Zealand middle-order batter Mark Chapman looked perplexed when he was asked about the Super Eight groups, where all four table-toppers, who have done well in their respective groups, will end up facing each other. It has been done because of the pre-tournament seedings.The 31-year-old smiled and replied, “When it comes to scheduling and planning, that’s not really in my domain.”Chapman’s response sums up the way New Zealand play their cricket. No fuss, no theatrics, just straight down to business.After playing three matches in Chennai and one in Ahmedabad, all on red-soil pitches, the Kiwis had only one training session to adapt to the conditions ahead of their first Super Eight match against Pakistan at the R Premadasa Stadium.None of them rushed towards the pitch for a closer look. Once warm-ups were done, the players moved to the indoor nets. About an hour later, Daryl Mitchell came out barefoot to inspect the surface, spending a good fifteen minutes studying every inch of the 22 yards.Chapman, who did not get to see the surface, left it to the senior leadership group.“In the subcontinent, the toss always plays a factor depending on the conditions.I haven’t seen the pitch yet, so I don’t actually know what it looks like. There will be discussions behind the scenes with the senior leadership group about what we want to do,” he said.The black-soil pitches in Colombo do assist spinners, and with bigger boundaries and a slower outfield, it presents a new challenge for the 2021 T20 World Cup finalists.“We haven’t played in Sri Lanka yet. A lot of guys in our team have played a lot of cricket here, so I don’t see that playing too much of a factor. Guys understand what they need to do, and we are confident we will face whatever conditions are in front of us,” said Chapman, whose knees were heavily strapped.“In India, particularly on red-soil pitches, conditions have been favourable for batting. It has been tough for the bowlers, and the margins have been very small. We have seen scores close to 200 regularly.“Here, it is slightly different with the slower nature of the pitches. The bowlers will hopefully get a chance to show their skills, and spinners are more likely to play a part here,” he added.Although Pakistan are stationed in Sri Lanka, they played their group matches at two different venues in Colombo.New Zealand will be the only team playing all their Super Eight matches at the same venue, facing Pakistan on February 21, Sri Lanka on February 25, and England on February 27, all at the R Premadasa Stadium.“One of the challenges in tournaments like these is hopping from venue to venue and adapting. When we play three games at the same place, we learn with each game.“It is nice to turn up at the same venue with similar pitches and adjust. Tomorrow is our first game here, so we will have to adapt anyway, but we will understand the conditions better as we go,” he said.New Zealand’s first challenge will be Pakistan’s spin-heavy attack. Usman Tariq, Abrar Ahmad, Mohammad Nawaz, Saim Ayub, and Shadab Khan form a strong unit.“Pakistan have a number of very good spinners, each with their own threat. We have played them quite frequently over the last few years.“We are well aware of what they will bring. For us, it is about being really clear in how we want to play against them,” he said.Obviously, there was a Usman Tariq question: “Usman Tariq has a unique action with the way he pauses at the crease, so that is something to factor in.""Chapman, whose role is to take on spinners in the middle overs, explained why running between the wickets will be crucial.“Given the slower pitch and bigger boundaries, you have to change your game plan. Against spinners, it is about different options like the sweep or reverse sweep. In India, you can target straight boundaries more.“For me, it is about finding different areas of the ground. There are big pockets here, so it is not all about sixes. Twos, fours, and running between the wickets are very important, especially if it is not a high-scoring game,” he said.New Zealand have suffered injury setbacks. Michael Bracewell has been ruled out of the remainder of the tournament after re-injuring his left calf. Captain Mitchell Santner missed the last group match against Canada due to illness, while Lockie Ferguson returned home for the birth of his first child.“Mitchell Santner looks pretty sprightly and excited to get back on the park, barring any last-minute illness.“Lockie has just returned and is coming off a long flight. We will see how he pulls up. I cannot confirm whether he will be in the playing eleven,” Chapman said.","New zealand will be the only team playing all their super eight matches at the same venue, facing pakistan on february 21, sri lanka on february 25, and england on february 27. New zealand middle-order batter mark chapman looked perplexed when he was asked about the super eight groups.

NEW DELHI: England and Pakistan are preparing for an important match in the T20 World Cup, and the pitch is expected to help spin bowlers (bowlers who make the ball turn). This means batters may find it harder to score runs.England, who won the World Cup in 2022, haven’t played their best yet but are still doing well. They started the Super Eights round with a big win against Sri Lanka, which boosted their confidence and put them at the top of their group.England also know the conditions well because they recently played and won matches at the same ground, which gives them an extra advantage.Pakistan is likely to rely heavily on their spin bowlers to challenge England.They have several skilled spin options, including Usman Tariq, Shadab Khan, Mohammad Nawaz, Abrar Ahmed, and Saim Ayub. These players can make batting difficult, especially as the pitch is expected to get slower as the match goes on.The weather conditions are expected to be favourable for the match. The temperature will be around 19° C.Skies are forecast to be mainly clear, with light winds from the SSE at around 6 km/h and gusts reaching up to 13 km/h.The probability of rain is low at 13%, while the chance of thunderstorms is minimal at 3%. No rainfall is expected, so weather interruptions are unlikely, and playing conditions should remain stable throughout the match.Harry Brook (c), Tom Banton, Jos Buttler, Ben Duckett, Phil Salt, Jacob Bethell, Sam Curran, Liam Dawson, Will Jacks, Jamie Overton, Rehan Ahmed, Jofra Archer, Adil Rashid, Josh Tongue, Luke Wood.Salman Ali Agha (c), Abrar Ahmed, Babar Azam, Faheem Ashraf, Fakhar Zaman, Khawaja Nafay, Mohammad Nawaz, Mohammad Salman Mirza, Naseem Shah, Sahibzada Farhan, Saim Ayub, Shaheen Shah Afridi, Shadab Khan, Usman Khan, Usman Tariq.","England and pakistan are preparing for an important match in the t20 world cup.

A gripping spin contest is on the cards when England take on Pakistan in a crucial Super Eights clash of the ICC Men's T20 World Cup on Tuesday, with conditions expected to favour slow bowlers.England enter the match with momentum after a commanding 51-run win over Sri Lanka that lifted them to the top of the Super Eights standings. While their batting hasn’t fully clicked, England’s spinners have stepped up impressively. Adil Rashid and Liam Dawson have choked opposition line-ups, while Will Jacks’ all-round contributions continue to prove invaluable.Opener Phil Salt also rediscovered form with a timely knock, though concerns linger over Jos Buttler and captain Harry Brook, both yet to make significant scores. Despite that, England have consistently found ways to win.“We still haven't had that perfect game with the bat. We haven't managed to get the starts and the big scores that we'd like,” Brook admitted. “Hopefully rewards can come a little bit later down the line for the lads with the bat.”Pakistan, meanwhile, face a far more urgent situation. Their Super Eights opener against New Zealand was washed out, leaving them little margin for error in the race for the semi-finals.Their hopes will hinge on a formidable spin attack featuring Abrar Ahmed , Shadab Khan and Mohammad Nawaz, while leading run-scorer Sahibzada Farhan will again carry the batting burden.On a surface expected to slow down, the contest could ultimately be decided by which team’s spinners seize control — and which batting unit adapts better under pressure.Sahibzada Farhan, Saim Ayub, Salman Agha (c), Babar Azam, Fakhar Zaman, Usman Khan (w), Shadab Khan, Mohammad Nawaz, Faheem Ashraf, Salman Mirza, Usman TariqPhilip Salt, Jos Buttler (wk), Jacob Bethell, Tom Banton, Harry Brook (c), Sam Curran, Will Jacks, Jamie Overton, Liam Dawson, Jofra Archer, Adil Rashid","England take on pakistan in a crucial super eights clash of the icc men's t20 world cup on tuesday.
