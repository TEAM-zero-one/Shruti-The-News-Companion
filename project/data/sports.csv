Bombay Sport Exchange Ep 5: Shane Watson on how IPL gave him a lifeline & his tribute to Phil Hughes

Poll Do you believe Rohit Sharma’s achievements will inspire future cricketers? Not really. Maybe, but it depends. Definitely!

Virat Kohli retires from Test cricket after 14 years

NEW DELHI: A historic moment unfolded at the iconic Wankhede Stadium on Friday as the Rohit Sharma Stand was officially unveiled, honouring India’s ODI captain. The emotional ceremony was soon followed by a light-hearted moment that went viral — a video capturing Rohit pulling up his younger brother Vishal, reportedly over a dent in their car.In true Rohit fashion, his reaction was hilariously deadpan: “Yeh kya hai?” he asked, pointing at the damage.Vishal, caught off guard, replied sheepishly, “Reverse.”To which Rohit responded, “Kiska? Tere se?” — a quick-fire exchange that had fans in splits, many calling it “peak big brother energy.”Wankhede holds a special place in Rohit's heart — it’s where his cricketing journey took flight back in 2007. Speaking at the unveiling, the veteran batter expressed deep gratitude to everyone involved in the event and reflected on the stadium’s personal and professional significance in his life.""Firstly, I would like to thank everyone who has come here to make this event so special. What is going to happen today, I never dreamt of it,"" Rohit said. ""As a kid growing up wanting to play for Mumbai and India, no one thinks about things like these. Like any other sportsperson, I only aimed to give my best and serve the nation. While doing that, you achieve many milestones, but something like this is truly special.""Rohit’s parents — Gurunath and Poornima Sharma — his wife Ritika Sajdeh, and brother Vishal were present at the stadium to witness the unveiling. Emotions ran high as Rohit acknowledged the impact of their sacrifices on his journey.“To have my name amongst legends of the game and renowned world leaders... I can’t put this feeling into words. I’m grateful to the MCA, the Apex Council, and everyone involved,” he said. “To receive this honour while I’m still playing makes it even more surreal. I’ve retired from two formats but continue to play ODIs. On the 21st, when I return here to play for Mumbai Indians against Delhi Capitals, it’ll be a truly special moment.”Rohit, who recently retired from Test cricket, has been a cornerstone of Mumbai cricket and led India to back-to-back ICC titles — the T20 World Cup in 2024 and the Champions Trophy in 2025.As he wrapped up his address, Rohit humorously noted that his Mumbai Indians teammates were eager for his speech to end so they could start their training. “It’ll be even more special when I get to play an India match at this venue again. To receive this honour in front of my parents, wife, and brother is beyond words. I’m deeply grateful for all they’ve done.”Ritika Sajdeh, often seen by Rohit’s side during tournaments and known as one of his strongest supporters, was visibly emotional throughout the event.Having debuted for India in 2007, Rohit has enjoyed a decorated international career. He was part of India’s 2007 T20 World Cup-winning squad and has represented the country in 159 T20Is, 273 ODIs, and 67 Tests. He bid farewell to T20Is after India’s title triumph in Barbados last year.","The rohit sharma stand was officially unveiled at the wankhede stadium on friday.

India’s golden boy of athletics, Neeraj Chopra , scripted history on Friday evening at the Doha Diamond League 2025 by breaching the elusive 90-metre barrier in men’s javelin throw for the first time in his career. The reigning world champion recorded a best throw of 90.23 metres, becoming only the 25th athlete in history to cross the prestigious mark. However, despite his personal milestone, Chopra had to settle for second place as Germany’s Julian Weber stole the show with a winning throw of 91.06 metres.Competing at the Qatar Sports Club Stadium , Neeraj got off to a brilliant start with a strong 88.44m throw in his very first attempt, which immediately put him in the lead. His second attempt was a foul, but he bounced back in style with his third — launching the javelin to a staggering 90.23 metres. That effort not only marked a career-best for Chopra but also made him the latest entrant in the elite 90m club, a mark considered the gold standard in javelin throwing.Julian Weber, however, had other plans. The German athlete, a consistent performer on the Diamond League circuit, saved his best for the day — unleashing a mighty 91.06m throw that edged out Chopra and earned him the top podium finish.Quiz: Who's that IPL player? The milestone comes at an exciting phase in Neeraj’s career. Now under the guidance of legendary coach Jan Zelezny a three-time Olympic champion and world record holder with a throw of 98.48m , Neeraj appears to be peaking just in time for a packed athletics season. This was Chopra’s first major competition of the year after switching coaches, and his performance in Doha will surely raise expectations ahead of the Olympics and other major events.Chopra’s feat adds him to an exclusive group of 25 javelin throwers worldwide who have thrown beyond 90 metres a club that includes greats like Zelezny himself, Johannes Vetter, Thomas Röhler, and Arshad Nadeem. The 90m throw has been achieved just 126 times in history, underlining the rarity and difficulty of the achievement.Although he didn’t win the event, Neeraj’s performance has reignited excitement among Indian sports fans and experts alike, signalling a new chapter in his illustrious journey. As one of the most decorated athletes in Indian history, Neeraj continues to push boundaries, and with the 90m milestone now conquered, his sights are firmly set on even bigger glories.This Doha meet was especially crucial as Chopra will not compete later this month due to the cancellation of the NC Classic 2025 in Bengaluru. With a statement performance in Qatar, he has laid down a strong marker for the rest of the season.A strong run from India’s Parul Chaudhary saw her set a new national record in the women’s 3000m steeplechase, clocking 9:13.39 to finish a commendable sixth in a high-quality field in Doha.With this performance, Chaudhary not only raised the national benchmark but also improved significantly on her 16th-place Diamond League debut in Eugene last year.",Neeraj chopra recorded a best throw of 90.23 metres at the doha diamond league 2025.

Juan Soto’s cool reaction to Yankees fans' boos goes viral after Mets debut in Bronx



Juan Soto knew what was coming, and still, the moment had an electric, almost cinematic, weight to it. As the New York Mets superstar walked up to the plate at Yankee Stadium on Friday night, the Bronx faithful erupted—not in admiration, but in fury. It was a chorus of 50,000 voices united in disapproval, just as he had predicted. “50,000 fans against one,” Soto told the New York Post ahead of the Mets-Yankees clash. He wasn’t wrong.Despite the storm of boos, there was an odd poetry in the moment. Soto, ever the showman, tipped his helmet and flashed a grin, even mouthing what appeared to be a “thank you” to the home crowd. It was his first time back in the Bronx since Game 5 of the 2024 World Series—this time wearing the colors of the Mets, not the pinstripes that once defined his sensational 2024 season.In that unforgettable year, Soto had delivered an MVP-caliber performance for the Yankees—slashing .288/.419/.569 with a career-high 41 home runs and helping power the team to its first World Series appearance since 2009. His towering, go-ahead homer in the 10th inning of Game 5 of the ALCS had practically etched him into Yankee lore. But that chapter ended unexpectedly when Soto opted for a 15-year, $765 million megadeal with the Mets—just $5 million more guaranteed than the Yankees' 16-year offer.The decision stung, and Yankee fans made sure he felt it. While his first at-bat resulted in a five-pitch walk off Carlos Rodón, it wasn’t about the stats that night—it was about the theater.And the Bronx Bleacher Creatures added their own twist to the drama. When Soto took his position in right field in the bottom of the first inning, they turned their backs to him—a symbolic act of betrayal felt by the fans during his free agency departure.Oddly enough, buried beneath the thunderous boos was a standing ovation—perhaps the crowd’s way of acknowledging his past heroics while simultaneously expressing their heartbreak.For Soto, it was a homecoming defined by tension, emotion, and undeniable star power. He walked away unshaken, wearing the boos like a badge of honor.Also Read: Juan Soto returns to Yankee Stadium and gets booed in a bizarre way","Juan soto faced loud boos from yankees fans during his first at-bat in the bronx but responded with calm confidence.

"""You'll never be as good as your dad"": How brutal criticism pushed Wayne Gretzky's son Ty Gretzky away from pro hockey",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/youll-never-be-as-good-as-your-dad-how-brutal-criticism-pushed-wayne-gretzkys-son-ty-gretzky-away-from-pro-hockey/articleshow/121163848.cms,"Wayne Gretzky son Ty Gretzky faced immense pressure growing up (Image via Instagram)

Being the son of “The Great One” came with more pressure than praise for young Ty Gretzky

Growing up in the shadow of hockey’s most iconic figure is no easy feat — just ask Ty Gretzky . As the eldest son of NHL legend Wayne Gretzky , Ty was never just another kid on the ice. Every shift, every goal, and every stumble came with a heavy dose of scrutiny — from teammates, rivals, and even strangers in the stands.In a candid 2006 interview with The New York Times, a 15-year-old Ty Gretzky opened up about the harsh realities of being Wayne Gretzky’s son. “I get smack-talked all the time on the ice from other players,” he said. “Just like, ‘I thought you were going to be a lot better,’ stuff like that.”Even at a young age, Ty was dealing with the weight of impossible expectations. Despite having a passion for the game, his last name made it nearly impossible to play without comparison. Speaking to Thousand Oaks Acorn, he admitted to eventually removing his last name from his jersey in an effort to blend in: “Somehow people in the stands would just find out who I was and yell, ‘You’ll never be as good as your dad in hockey.’”The pressure didn’t stop there. During his second year playing center for a lower-tier team at Shattuck-St. Mary’s School — a well-known hockey academy — Ty managed four goals and six assists over 29 games. Still, his stats were often overshadowed by his surname. “It wasn’t just about playing hockey anymore,” Ty implied. “It became about living up to a legacy I didn’t ask for.”Ultimately, Ty chose not to pursue hockey professionally, but he never abandoned the game. Instead, he found a meaningful way to stay connected to the sport — and to his father. In 2014, he co-founded The Gretzky Hockey School alongside Wayne, creating a space where young players can develop their skills without the burden of comparison.Also Read: Wayne Gretzky's son Ty Gretzky’s Mother’s Day post hides a deeper message about family legacy Ty’s story is a poignant reminder that even in the world of sports royalty, carving out your own identity can be the biggest challenge of all.","Ty gretzky is the eldest son of nhl legend wayne gretzki.

Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce might be stepping into the spotlight together—officially. The superstar couple, whose relationship has captivated fans worldwide since going public, could make their long-awaited red carpet debut next month at the 2025 Kids’ Choice Awards on June 21.While both have maintained a relatively low profile since the NFL season ended, a shared nomination night could be the perfect moment for them to finally appear hand-in-hand before the cameras.Taylor Swift has landed two major nominations: “Favorite Female Artist” and “Favorite Song” for her chart-topper “I Can Do It With a Broken Heart.” She’s up against big names like Ariana Grande, Sabrina Carpenter, Kendrick Lamar, and her close friend Selena Gomez.Travis Kelce, meanwhile, is nominated in the “Favorite Male Sports Star” category, a nod to his dominant performance in the NFL. He and his brother Jason Kelce also earned recognition for their hit podcast “New Heights,” nominated in the “Favorite Podcast” category.With both Swift and Kelce being celebrated individually at the same event, fans are buzzing over the possibility that this may mark their first official red carpet appearance as a couple.Since their whirlwind romance became public in 2023, Swift and Kelce have mostly kept their outings under the radar.

However, with the Kids’ Choice Awards falling during a quieter stretch for both stars, the timing seems ideal.Recently, the couple was spotted in Philadelphia celebrating Mother’s Day with their families—a rare but heartwarming public sighting.

Conor McGregor’s vague comeback statement continues to be a mere gimmick as UFC CEO Dana White dismisses any possible bout for the fighter

MMA fans finally have an answer, as the, on Friday, May 16, 2025, dismissed the idea of Conor McGregor ’s return to the Octagon. Supporters of the Irish fighter had a hope when the Notorious recently posted a set of cryptic words on his Instagram story, which were still dicey owing to the fighter’s previous vague statements of picking up the gloves again.Former UFC champion Conor McGregor was last seen going head-on against Dustin Poirier at UFC 264, where the former broke his leg during the bout. Post that, the Irish fighter was supposed to face Michael Chandler at UFC 303 but had to withdraw owing to a toe injury. Since then, there have been no signs of the fighter stepping back into the Octagon anytime soon. Instead of any concrete announcement or confirmation of a comeback bout, the fighter engages in posting occasional training clips and cryptic statements that partly hint at his return to the Octagon.Recently, the fighter was seen posting a series of cryptic messages on his Instagram stories directed towards the UFC executives and the boss, Dana White. Across two different stories, his statements read“@danawhite @tkogroup call that big b**t nurse”“Let’s get this show started @ufc”It has been quite some time since the fighter had last tagged the promotion and its executives directly in a comeback statement. Which is why fans were somewhat more optimistic rather than being sceptical about McGregor’s potential comeback.But much to the dismay of the community, Dana White, on May 16, made a revelation about his recent interaction with McGregor, which crushed the hopes of the fans. In a recent clip, the UFC CEO makes a statement about the potential comeback of the fighter, “He is not fighting anytime soon. I haven’t talked to him in a minute. Yeah…I don’t know.”Also read: UFC color commentator Daniel Cormier reacts to heavyweight champion Jon Jones’ hypothetical claims Dana White, plain and simple, dismissed the fighter’s supposed request that was made via the Instagram stories. Fighters like Michael Chandler, too, waited for McGregor to step back into the Octagon before finally moving on with other fighters, thereby concentrating on their own careers. With White’s statement, McGregor’s claims become irrelevant, and fans can now be assured about the probable future of the fighter inside the Octagon.","Conor mcgregor was last seen going head-on against dustin poirier at ufc 264.

Rohit Sharma’s last press conference as a captain

It was an evening of emotion, legacy, and heartfelt tributes at the Wankhede Stadium as the Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA) officially unveiled the Rohit Sharma Stand honouring one of Mumbai’s finest cricketing sons. But amid the cheers, applause, and camera flashes, what truly moved hearts was a quiet, tearful moment Ritika Sajdeh , Rohit Sharma’s wife, was seen holding back tears as her husband’s name lit up the iconic stadium.A video now going viral captures Ritika in the stands, visibly emotional as the Divecha Pavilion Level 3 was officially renamed after the India and Mumbai Indians captain. The moment wasn’t just a tribute to Rohit’s cricketing journey, it was a culmination of years of dedication, sacrifice, and support behind the scenes.From Borivali’s bylanes to the world’s grandest cricketing stages, Rohit Sharma’s rise has been spectacular. But through every high and heartbreak, Ritika has stood by him from his career-defining double centuries to the heartbreaks of World Cup exits. Her teary-eyed reaction encapsulated the personal side of this professional triumph.Quiz: Who's that IPL player? As tributes poured in including a moving Instagram post from teammate and close friend Suryakumar Yadav it became clear this wasn’t just about a name on a stand. It was about what Rohit represents: consistency, calm, class and the people who’ve journeyed with him, quietly in the background.Surya’s message read:""Congratulations @rohitsharma45 on achieving incredible things on the cricket ground, from finisher to opener to our captain, you have been an inspiration and our pride, in every role.Very rarely comes a leader who leads from the front, and changes the game for better. You are that leader, who has changed not just the game, but the approach, the attitude, the dressing room atmosphere, the team and redefined the role of a captain.Like I have said before, good things happen to good people, and you deserve it all and more. Wankhede just got even more iconic..""Also present was MI owner Akash Ambani , who called Rohit's honour “a moment that will inspire an entire generation.”With over 19,700 international runs, 49 centuries, a 2024 T20 World Cup title, and five IPL championships, Rohit’s cricketing stats are monumental but it was Ritika’s silent tears that perhaps spoke loudest.

Belichick replied, “We have a good personal relationship,” before quickly pivoting away from further personal discussion.For a coach who has built his legacy on tunnel vision and minimal distractions, the relationship has sparked a unique blend of curiosity and criticism.

NBA Draft analyst expressed view on Cedric Coward’s joining Duke Blue Devils

Recapping Cedric Coward's 2024-2025 college basketball season

'Cedric Coward is likely gone' | Where does Duke turn if Coward STAYS in the Draft? | FIELD OF 68

Cedric Coward performed brilliantly in the NBA Draft Combine and stood out in the physical attributes as well. It has become a matter of concern for the Duke Blue Devils , who may have to face tough competition to have Coward by their side. NBA Draft analyst Jonathan Givony also hinted at the possibility of Coward not returning to Duke’s campus in his recent tweet.Firstly, it was Cooper Flagg becoming the No.1 pick and gravitating towards the Dallas Mavericks; now it is Cedric Coward showing interest in testing new waters (as per his Instagram post). The Duke Blue Devils may have to adjust to a shrinking roster with two top picks slipping from their hands. The situation has become more evident after the NBA Draft Combine, in which Cedric Coward checked various boxes with ease. His brilliance in athletics, shooting rate, and physical attributes must have left several NBA teams vying for his attention. Taking stock of the situation, the NBA Draft analyst, Jonathan Givony, expressed his view on Coward’s future on X, tweeting:“Footage of Duke-commit Cedric Coward at the NBA draft combine. 6'6 1/2 wing shot the ball well in drills (made 72% of his aggregate jumpers) and measured a 7'2 wingspan. Sounding increasingly unlikely he'll step foot on campus in Durham.”Cedric Coward stood out in both physical attributes and athletic parameters. Given the race among the NBA teams for picking the best for the respective rosters, it is quite likely that Coward will be surrounded by suitors in June. It has definitely weakened chances for the Duke Blue Devils to have an ensemble roster in place and has increased difficulties for the team.Though several media reports suggest that Coward committed himself to the Duke, but his media sessions tell otherwise. Whether he will be keeping his commitment or will be busy trying new waters remains to see.From the views of the NBA Draft Combine, Cedric Coward seems to be in his best health and completely fit to take on the NBA challenges. However, his 2024-2025 college basketball season didn’t go as expected. He suffered a shoulder injury just after the first six games, which cut short his season unexpectedly.Playing for the Washington State, he had an impactful run despite a shortened season. He averaged 17.7 points per game, and delivered 55.7% field-goal percentage. It is his exceptional shooting ability and formidable physical attributes that have started murmurs around his plausible future course in the NBA.Also Read: Cooper Flagg’s performance leads Duke Blue Devil to major win over Illinois fighting Illini Cedric Coward’s NBA Draft Combine performance is certainly an achievement for the player who was a no body once.

Micah Parsons contract talks highlight Dallas Cowboys’ salary cap pressure



Do Ravens or Bills have better odds of winning SB, Micah Parsons: Cowboys will have 12 wins | SPEAK

The Dallas Cowboys and Micah Parsons are at the center of a heated contract standoff grabbing the attention of NFL fans and experts alike. Reports claimed a handshake deal was already in place, but Parsons quickly took to social media to label those rumors as completely false. The core issue is Parsons seeking a massive $200 million extension that would not only break records for defensive players but also make him the highest-paid non-quarterback in NFL history, surpassing Ja’Marr Chase’s recent $161 million deal.Micah Parsons is no ordinary player. As a four-time Pro Bowler and two-time All-Pro, his dominance on the field has earned him superstar status. The Dallas Cowboys have shown they are willing to invest heavily in their top talent, recently signing Dak Prescott and CeeDee Lamb to major contracts. However, Parsons’ contract negotiations are progressing at a different pace, raising questions about the team’s salary cap flexibility and their approach to negotiations. Some wonder if the Cowboys are holding back to control Parsons’ demands, or if they are simply limited by the financial commitments they have already made.Adding to the uncertainty is the public clash between media reports and Parsons’ own statements, which has created confusion about the transparency of the talks. The longer the Cowboys delay, the more leverage Parsons gains, especially since his current contract only covers this season. The possibility of a holdout is becoming more real, which could disrupt Dallas’ defensive plans and affect team chemistry.Also Read: Is Travis Kelce escaping to $20M Florida estate amid NFL offseason and media spotlight on relationship with Taylor Swift? In the end, both Parsons and the Cowboys appear committed to building a future together. The key question is how much Dallas is willing to pay to keep their defensive star. Contracts of this size are rare in today’s NFL and require a careful balance between player value and salary cap management. As the season opener nears, pressure is mounting for both sides to reach an agreement. Whether the Cowboys finalize the deal or the standoff continues, the outcome will play a major role in shaping the team’s competitive future and could redefine the market for defensive players across the league.","The dallas cowboys and micah parsons are at the center of a heated contract standoff.
