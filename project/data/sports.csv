The following day, Palash Muchhal was also admitted to a hospital in Sangli, Mandhana's hometown, before being transferred to Mumbai for treatment.The wedding delay was officially announced by Mandhana's manager, citing the health emergencies as the reason for the postponement.Following the postponement, Mandhana removed all wedding-related posts from her Instagram account, though some casual photographs with Palash remain visible.

Bo Bichette’s injuries spark big concern as MLB analysts explain Blue Jays’ slow approach

Bo Bichette is in the news again as MLB analysts wonder why the Toronto Blue Jays have still not re-signed him. The questions grew louder this week when the team signed starting pitcher Dylan Cease to a seven-year, two hundred and ten million dollar deal. Many fans thought the team would sign Bo Bichette first because he is one of their top players. Instead, the Blue Jays chose to move fast with Dylan Cease, and that raised doubts.On Thursday, Jeff O’Neill, Bryan Hayes and Dave Feschuk spoke about this on TSN’s “Overdrive” show from Toronto. They said the delay with Bo Bichette may show that the team has concerns. They also said there could be “red flags” that the Blue Jays are thinking about before offering a long contract.Bryan Hayes said the Toronto Blue Jays may still be trying to understand Bo Bichette’s true market value. He explained that the team did not need to study Dylan Cease’s price because many teams were already ready to offer him big money.But with Bo Bichette, he said the team may be unsure about the right number. He added that Bo Bichette may also believe he should get top pay, but that does not always match what a team wants to spend.Dave Feschuk then spoke about Bo Bichette’s injury issues. He said these injuries cannot be ignored.He explained that Bo Bichette was not healthy for most of the playoffs last year. He also said that the shortstop missed a large part of the 2024 season when the Blue Jays finished last in the American League East. Dave Feschuk said these things matter because teams think carefully before giving a long contract that covers many years.Bo Bichette missed eighty-one games in the 2024 season. His injuries included right knee tendonitis, a right quad strain and a right calf strain. He missed the final month of the regular season while he was leading MLB in hits. He returned only for the World Series.Dave Feschuk also said teams may be more careful with money because the next Collective Bargaining Agreement talks will happen after the 2026 season.He said some teams believe a salary cap could arrive, so they do not want to spend too much before the MLB rules change. Bo Bichette has been a career point two nine four hitter with one hundred eleven home runs and four hundred thirty-seven RBIs. His hitting numbers remain strong, but teams must decide how his injuries will affect his future deals.Also Read: San Francisco Giants Jump Ahead Of $8.2B New York Yankees In Rising Race For Tatsuya Imai","Toronto blue jays signed starting pitcher dylan cease to a seven-year, two hundred and ten million dollar deal this week.

'Tagda maar diya': Virat Kohli’s explosive shot leaves Rishabh Pant speechless - Watch,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/india-vs-south-africa/tagda-maar-diya-virat-kohlis-explosive-shot-leaves-rishabh-pant-speechless-watch/articleshow/125667791.cms,"Virat Kohli (X)

The BCCI shared a new video on Saturday from Team India’s training session at the JSCA Stadium in Ranchi, giving fans a glimpse of senior stars Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma gearing up for their return to ODI cricket. The three-match series against South Africa begins on 30 November, and the experienced pair will be seen again in blue after stepping away from T20Is and Test cricket. They now feature only in the one-day format at international level.In the clip posted online, a light-hearted moment involving Rishabh Pant and Kohli has caught the attention of fans. Pant was keeping during the nets when the pacer delivered a good-length ball to Kohli. The former captain danced down the track and produced a cleanly struck pull shot that left Pant impressed. Reacting instantly, Pant said from behind the stumps, “Bhai ji, acha ball tha yeh. Tagda maar diya,” praising both the delivery and Kohli’s effortless timing.Rohit and Kohli last played an ODI together during the tour of Australia in October. In that game, Rohit produced an unbeaten match-winning 121, while Kohli supported him with a fluent 74 not out. Their 168-run partnership set the tone for India’s win.As the Ranchi opener approaches, both batters stand on the brink of major milestones. Rohit, who currently sits at the top of the ODI batting rankings, is closing in on the 20,000-run mark in international cricket. He has amassed 19,902 runs across 502 matches, including 4,301 in Tests, 4,231 in T20Is, and 11,370 in ODIs. The Indian captain needs only 98 more to become the fourth Indian to enter the elite 20,000-run club after Sachin Tendulkar , Virat Kohli and Rahul Dravid .Kohli is on the verge of creating history as well. One more hundred will move him past Tendulkar for the most centuries by a batter in a single international format. Both legends are currently tied with 51 tons each, with Tendulkar’s tally coming in Tests. Kohli’s next century will make him the first to reach 52 in one format. Only these two greats have managed to score 50 or more hundreds in any single format of the game.",Virat kohli and rohit sharma are gearing up for their return to odi cricket.

Travis Kelce sent a resounding message on Browns rookie Shedeur Sanders



Cleveland finally felt a long awaited spark when Shedeur Sanders stepped onto the field for his first NFL start. The Browns needed someone to steady an offense that had been stuck for most of the season, and Sanders delivered a performance that shifted the mood in the city. His debut not only brought a win but also caught the attention of two of Cleveland’s most accomplished sons, Jason and Travis Kelce . Their excitement set the tone for a conversation that echoed across the league.Travis Kelce did not hide how thrilled he was. He sent a strong message to Sanders on the latest episode of New Heights, praising the rookie with all the energy fans expect from him. “Talk your sh**, Shedeur, let’s f**ing go. My dog goes in, gets his first start, gets his first dub. Let’s f*cking go, man. The 45th starting QB for the Browns since 1994. First Browns QB to win in his first official start since 1995. Cleveland’s been waiting for this. We’ve been waiting for this,” Travis said.For Travis, this moment carried extra meaning. He grew up in Cleveland, starred at the University of Cincinnati and has always kept a place in his heart for the Browns. Seeing Sanders command the offense and lead a 24 to 10 victory over the Raiders reminded him of what the city has been longing for. Jason Kelce agreed, saying Sanders brought something that had been missing. “In one game, Shedeur showed them more than they had seen, really, in any of the games with Gabriel,” he said.Jason noted that Sanders was not perfect, but his poise and timely throws stood out.Sanders went 11 for 20 for 209 yards with one touchdown and one interception. His best throw came on a play where Las Vegas brought heavy pressure. Instead of folding, he rolled right and sent a 52 yard strike to Isaiah Bond. His touchdown came later when rookie Dylan Sampson turned a screen into a 66 yard score. It was the type of play Cleveland had been desperate to see.A week earlier, Sanders struggled in relief duty. He entered cold and completed only four passes against Baltimore. This time he had preparation, rhythm and confidence. Now he faces a much tougher test when the Browns meet the 49ers. With the Kelce brothers and the city behind him, Sanders steps into Week 13 with belief and momentum on his side.Also Read: Meet Taylor Burr, the Chiefs’ breakout sideline personality who’s living her dream and charming viewers nationwide",Shedeur sanders made his debut for the browns against the raiders.

'Get Off Your Phone': Travis Kelce’s Past With Kayla Nicole Resurfaces Amid Taylor Swift Lyric Storm

Kayla Nicole explains ‘over-sexualized comments’ on the On Tap with Harry Jowsey podcast



Kayla Nicole is back in the spotlight, and fans of Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce are not happy at all. Kayla, who dated Travis Kelce until 2022, spoke on the “On Tap with Harry Jowsey” podcast and made a comment that upset many people. She said she does not want to date any more athletes, but then she added that she would date team owners. The internet quickly jumped on this line, and many fans said she is “never beating those gold digger allegations.” This one comment spread fast and started a huge fight online.Right after the podcast clip came out, fans on X began reacting. Some Swift fans said Kayla Nicole was again throwing “small shots” at Travis Kelce. Others said her comment sounded rude toward all athletes. A few people joked that Kayla has only dated one athlete, so saying she will never date one again did not make much sense. That made people laugh even more and turned the whole thing into a trending moment.Another fan dragged Taylor Swift’s ex-boyfriend Joe Alwyn into the talk. They joked that Joe also loved Taylor’s lifestyle and “connections.” Many people online wrote that Kayla Nicole should stop bringing up anything that looks like a jab at Travis Kelce.One person said, “I don’t see anyone lining up.” Another fan said they will always defend Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce “any day” from Kayla’s comments. Someone else joked that Kayla is entering her “villain arc. ”Some fans also reminded others that Travis Kelce did not cheat on Kayla with Taylor Swift. They said the breakup happened long before Taylor Swift came into the picture, so these new comments feel unnecessary. People even mentioned her Halloween video where she used a Toni Braxton song, saying she should just “move on.”During the same talk with Harry Jowsey, Kayla Nicole also opened up about people calling her “too sexual.” She said this happens even when she wears simple clothes like a swimsuit. She explained that she is not trying to make “thirst trap” photos. She said she is simply at the beach or pool, and people turn it into something else.Kayla Nicole said she has dealt with this problem for “years and years.” She told Harry that she cannot control how others see her and that it is “not my fault” if people feel attracted to her. Her comments kept the online talk going, and fans continued reacting long after the podcast clip went viral.Also Read: “Tayvis Thanksgiving Is Like”: Perez Hilton Reacts As Taylor Swift And Travis Kelce’s Viral Steakhouse Photo With Chiefs Fans Sparks New Buzz","Taylor swift fans call out kayla nicole after her team owner dating comment sparks gold digger claims again.

Pros, Cons, and Overall Winner

Talk around the league has escalated as theare increasingly positioned as a potential landing spot for Milwaukee Bucks superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo . With the franchise eyeing a future built around Luka Dončić , the possibility of pairing him with another generational MVP has created a wave of speculation across NBA circles.This momentum is driven by recent indications that the Lakers are exploring aggressive paths to remain contenders beyond the LeBron James era. Reports suggest they are more willing than ever to make short-term sacrifices if it means strengthening their core around Dončić, who continues to perform at an MVP level.Among the most detailed proposals is a five-team structure that envisions the Lakers acquiring Giannis along with Olivier-Maxence Prosper from Dallas and Tyrese Martin from Brooklyn. In this scenario, LeBron James heads to Dallas, Brooklyn gains Dalton Knecht, and Los Angeles sends Milwaukee a haul of wings - RJ Barrett, PJ Washington, Caleb Martin, and Naji Marshall - along with extensive draft control.The Bucks’ return would include swap rights in 2026, 2028, 2030, and 2032, plus a 2031 first-round pick. Meanwhile, the Raptors and Nets secure young pieces and trade exceptions to reshape their flexibility.Alternate proposals maintain the same intention but reduce the complexity. One such idea involves the Lakers sending LeBron, Austin Reaves, and two first-rounders directly to Milwaukee in exchange for Giannis and Kyle Kuzma. These frameworks prioritize Milwaukee’s need for draft capital and young talent rather than retaining an aging LeBron.For the Lakers, landing a 30-year-old superstar in his prime alongside a 26-year-old Dončić offers a pathway to multiple championship runs. Their recent head-to-head battles - highlighted by Dončić’s 41-point performance in a dominant win - underscore the potential of their combined offensive strength.Milwaukee, on the other hand, would gain assets to address the team’s drop-off when Giannis is off the floor. Their pursuit of additional scorers such as Zach LaVine and Anfernee Simons shows a desire to rebalance the roster, and a major trade could accelerate a full-scale retool.Dallas would reload instantly with LeBron’s leadership beside rising talent. Brooklyn and Toronto would walk away with young guards like Knecht and Hardy, plus valuable exceptions.The Lakers benefit from a potential dynasty-forming duo capable of combining for over 65 points per game while boosting the league’s global appeal. The Bucks secure valuable rebuilding tools but risk alienating fans by moving their franchise icon. The complexity of multi-team negotiations and Knicks-related timing issues remain hurdles.Also read: NBA trade rumors: Golden State Warriors could chase $54.2 million Dallas Mavericks superstar in blockbuster 3-team trade to fix center depth If such a scenario were to play out, the Lakers emerge with the clearest long-term upside, while Milwaukee transitions into a new era fueled by assets and flexibility.",The los angeles lakers are increasingly positioned as a potential landing spot for milwaukee bucks superstar giannis antetokounmpo.

Fans react to Luka Doncic’s Bugatti moment

The Los Angeles Lakers hosted the Dallas Mavericks on Black Friday at Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles, and all eyes were on Luka Doncic before the first tip. The 26-year-old star arrived in a way that instantly dominated social media chatter, it was a $5 million Bugatti W16 Mistral.Only 99 of the hypercars exist worldwide, making the sight of it rolling into the arena nothing short of extraordinary. Fans and photographers alike captured the moment, and the arrival set the tone for a high-stakes showdown between the Lakers and Doncic’s former team.Doncic’s reputation for flair and spectacle is well-known, but this entrance took it to another level. The Mistral packs a 1,600-horsepower quad-turbo W16 engine, blending automotive engineering with celebrity showmanship.Lakers general manager Rob Pelinka even commented on the hypercar, telling Doncic, “You are now all L.A.,” acknowledging how seamlessly the star had stepped into his new West Coast chapter. With the Mavericks looking to tighten their defense, Doncic’s dramatic pull-up added an extra layer of anticipation before the game.Before the game, Doncic showed off the Mistral to Snoop Dogg, who reacted with visible excitement. “I left my keys at home,” Snoop joked, marveling at the vehicle’s design and power.The open-top hypercar features exposed carbon fiber, bold orange accents, and a performance-focused interior, reflecting the kind of bold, high-end choices Doncic has become known for both on and off the court. This wasn’t just a display of wealth; it was a statement of identity, connecting his rising Lakers chapter with a sense of exclusivity and spectacle.The W16 Mistral represents the final celebration of Bugatti’s legendary quad-turbocharged W16 engine before the brand moves toward hybrid V16 technology.

Since entering the league, he has earned Rookie of the Year honors, multiple All-Star selections, and led the league in scoring during the 2023–2024 season. His presence in Los Angeles continues to command attention, both through his on-court skills and off-court lifestyle choices.Doncic’s fans were quick to react to the moment.

What Hailey Sikman and Jade Dickens said about Jammie Booker at the Texas event



Jammie Booker, 28, lost her World’s Strongest Woman title after officials said she is a biological male and also after explicit photos spread during the event. This happened at the 2025 contest in Arlington, Texas, last weekend. On Tuesday, the Official Strongman Games said they removed her win because they only allow people to compete in the category of the sex marked at birth. This pushed Andrea Thompson , 43, from Great Britain, into first place.Rivals told the Daily Mail and Fox News Digital that they only learned about Booker’s gender after the event. They said the photos and videos were sent to them later. One photo showed Booker grabbing her chest and sticking out her tongue. The Daily Mail also said competitors shared adult pictures and videos that seemed to show Booker had worked in porn. Because of this, the event became a huge controversy.Strongwomen Hailey Sikman and Jade Dickens said they felt “conned” because they did not know anything about Jammie Booker’s gender before the contest ended. Jade Dickens told Fox News Digital that she was “beyond mad.” She said, “Nobody knew he was a man.”She also said Booker was quiet, and she believed Booker’s voice might have revealed the truth.Hailey Sikman said she tried to talk to Booker during the event, but Booker did not respond. Sikman said many women felt Jammie Booker was “arrogant” and “talking s***.” They believed she kept a distance from other athletes.On Tuesday, the Official Strongman Games shared a strong statement. They said, “It appears that an athlete who is biologically male and who now identifies as female competed in the Women’s Open category.” They also said they tried to contact Booker but did not get a reply.The Daily Mail looked into claims that Booker worked in adult entertainment. Their report said Booker looks like a porn performer named Jammie Jay, and Booker also uses the TikTok name @jammiejaysvids. The IAFD (Internet Adult Film Database) shows that “Jammie Jay” was nominated at the Trans Erotica Awards in 2020 and 2022. The site also lists several adult movie titles under that name.The Daily Mail reached out to Booker and her coach but got no response. They also contacted the Official Strongman Games to ask if these photos and videos were part of the decision to remove the title.In a 2017 YouTube video, Jammie Booker said she was a “21-year-old trans woman” with a hard past and strict parents. In a July podcast with champion strongwoman Erin Murray, Booker talked about having three partners and said she uses Google Calendar to plan time with each one.She said she trains early in the morning and keeps her schedule tight so she can balance work, partners, and strongwoman training.Also Read: Why Did A Biological Male Win The World’s Strongest Woman?

How will Marcus Foligno’s injury affect Minnesota’s Wild lineup?

Marcus Foligno (#17) All 23 Goals of the 2021-22 NHL Season

The veteran winger Marcus Foligno has been placed on injured reserve by the Minnesota Wild effective November 26, after he picked up a lower-body injury in the course of the game against the Chicago Blackhawks, which went into overtime on Wednesday night. Foligno was involved in a collision with Oliver Moore and had to leave the match late in the second period, and the Wild has since called up Nicolas Aubé-Kubel from their AHL affiliate in Iowa to take his place on the roster. Minnesota is currently without five forwards, including Ryan Hartman, Vinnie Hinostroza, Marco Rossi, and Vladimir Tarasenko, while they have approximately $3.43 million in cap space.Foligno will be out for the next three games at least and can only return as early as December 4 against the Calgary Flames. This winger, who is 34 years old, has not been very productive offensively in recent times, getting only two assists in 23 games, and his average ice time of 13:07 is the lowest in the last seven years. Nevertheless, he still plays a vital defensive role, and numbers like expected goals against per 60 minutes (2.63) and scoring chances against per 60 (28.29) show that he is worth having in his own zone.The Wild have to deal with the problem of performing up to standard while the crucial forwards are out of the lineup.The head coach, John Hynes, has not given any specific time frame for Marcus Foligno’s full recovery, so Minnesota has to cope with using its depth players, together with recalled Aubé-Kubel, to keep its lineup alive.Foligno's IR placement is very timely as the team is poised to extend its winning streak to six and fortify its Central Division position. The Wild will have to make extensive ice time adjustments, change line combinations, and rethink deployment strategies to remain competitive during his absence.Foligno's injury puts additional strain on the Minnesota forwards; however, good roster management and the help from the fit players are going to be the key factors in getting through the upcoming fixtures.Also Read: NHL Updates: Montreal Canadiens re-sign defenseman Mike Matheson to a long-term extension","Marcus foligno has been placed on injured reserve by the minnesota wild.

Tip-off is set for 7:30 PM ET, and for the first time in a while, Charlotte’s star point guard walks into a matchup without an injury tag shadowing him. His clean bill of health is reassuring for a fanbase that has watched him battle ankle concerns all season.Charlotte is desperate for stability, especially with their record slipping further below .500. Having Ball at the helm offers something this team has lacked in recent weeks: direction.

With Black Friday bringing a national spotlight to the tournament slate, the timing couldn’t be better.LaMelo Ball enters tonight’s contest after logging 27 minutes in Wednesday’s outing against the Knicks, where he posted 11 points, six rebounds, and four assists. Despite a rough 4-for-14 shooting night, his presence alone boosted Charlotte’s tempo and spacing. Even as whispers of ongoing ankle management persist, the official injury report listed him as fully available.That clarity allows the Hornets to lean on his signature dynamism - no-look passes, deep-range orchestration, and paint manipulation.This comes after a turbulent stretch in which Ball missed significant time due to a right ankle impingement. His return has been gradual, but the recent uptick in minutes shows that the team is confident in his durability. With Brandon Miller also cleared, Charlotte’s offensive engine finally resembles what it was designed to be earlier this season. Still, Hornets fans understand how quickly fortunes can shift if Ball tweaks the ankle again.Chicago enters Spectrum Center in disarray. The Bulls are dealing with an injury avalanche headlined by Zach Collins, who remains out with a left scaphoid fracture, and Isaac Okoro, listed as doubtful due to lumbar radiculopathy. Several others are questionable: Nikola Vucevic (knee), Coby White (calf/injury management), Patrick Williams (wrist), Kevin Huerter (pelvic contusion), and Dalen Terry (calf).

Stakes for Milwaukee’s NBA Cup Hopes

Thehead into their NBA Cup showdown against the New York Knicks on November 28, 2025, with uncertainty surrounding their franchise superstar., and the final call will be made closer to tip-off at Madison Square Garden. As the Bucks attempt to keep their Cup dreams alive, the possibility of another game without their two-time MVP looms large.Milwaukee enters this matchup under immense pressure. A six-game losing streak has dropped them to 8-11 and 11th in the Eastern Conference, a slide largely attributed to Giannis’ four-game absence. With the NBA Cup wildcard still within reach, every possession becomes crucial for a team desperate to rediscover momentum.Giannis Antetokounmpo first suffered the left adductor strain on November 17 against the Cavaliers, logging only 13 minutes before exiting the game. Since then, the Milwaukee Bucks have cautiously monitored his progress. After participating in pregame workouts and practice on November 27, he was upgraded to questionable, with coach Doc Rivers clarifying that the delay in return is not due to any physical setback.Before the injury, Giannis Antetokounmpo was in dominant form - averaging 31 points, 10.8 rebounds, and 6.8 assists across 13 games while shooting an impressive 62% from the field and 50% from beyond the arc. His absence has exposed Milwaukee’s reliance on his two-way presence, creating a noticeable drop-off in rim pressure, playmaking, and overall offensive cohesion.The Milwaukee Bucks continue to feel the impact of other injuries as well. Kevin Porter Jr. remains out following right knee meniscus surgery, Taurean Prince is sidelined due to neck surgery, and Alex Antetokounmpo is currently in the G League system.This Group C finale is critical. Milwaukee must win and get help from other results to keep their NBA Cup hopes alive, facing a Knicks squad that has surged to an 11-6 record and an imposing 8-1 mark at home.

DJ Moore’s injury update clears him for action ahead of the Bears’ next matchup

Every Bears fan knows the emotional trauma of checking the injury report every week like it’s a final exam score. And this week, all eyes were glued to one name: DJ Moore. After a stretch of uncertainty and practice updates that felt more dramatic than a reality show teaser, fans finally got the answer they were hoping for. The Bears star wideout and the offense’s spark plug is officially good to go. So yes, Chicago, you can exhale. Let’s break down why his availability today is a huge deal.The week began with mild panic when DJ Moore popped up in headlines after missing time in practice. Even though the team didn’t list anything major, fans immediately feared the worst. He’s the most reliable receiving option Chicago has, and losing him especially when the offense has been trying to build momentum would’ve been a nightmare.Thankfully, the final injury report confirmed the best-case scenario: DJ Moore is expected to play. He carries no injury designation, meaning the team is confident in his health and ready to deploy him as usual.This isn’t just another name returning to the lineup, this is the guy who shifts coverages, opens lanes, and gives the quarterback a dependable target when things get messy. Without Moore, defenses collapse on the run and dare Chicago to win with secondary receivers.With Moore? The entire field opens up.That’s why his availability today completely changes Chicago’s offensive plan. Expect more aggressive play-calling, deeper routes, and plenty of chances for Moore to take over the game the way he has all season.Even though he’s cleared, the Bears may still manage his workload just to avoid flare-ups. But if the game script calls for it, Moore will absolutely see meaningful volume. Chicago leans on him heavily whether it's third-down conversions, red-zone looks, or momentum-changing deep shots.Now all eyes shift to kickoff to see if he can deliver the game-changing moments Chicago desperately needs.Also read - Will Saquon Barkley play against the Chicago Bears today?
