Dewald Brevis offered some resistance with 22 runs, but the Indian bowling unit, led by Arshdeep Singh, Jasprit Bumrah , Varun Chakravarthy, and Axar Patel, dismantled the opposition, each picking up two wickets. Hardik and Shivam Dube claimed one each. The all-round performance earned Hardik the Player of the Match award, as India took a 1-0 lead in the five-match series.However, more attention than the match itself has been drawn to former India cricketer and commentator Aakash Chopra , who took playful pot shots at Pakistan opener Sahibzada Farhan .During South Africa’s innings, when the team were 28/2 in the fourth over, Bumrah bowled a good-length delivery on the last ball after Aiden Markram had smashed a six.Commentating at the time, Chopra said, “Bumrah ko chhakka maarna itna aasaan nahi hota. Kabhi lag jaaye to kuch log documentary bana lete hain [It’s not so easy to hit Bumrah for a six. If someone manages to do it once, some people even make a documentary on it].”Watch the video here The remark, delivered without naming anyone, clearly referenced Sahibzada Farhan, who had hit Bumrah for sixes during the Asia Cup T20 2025.Farhan had even shared a clip of a documentary made on his innings after Pakistan lost to India in the final, making him a target for Chopra’s humorous dig.The commentary clip has gone viral, with fans praising Chopra’s wit.The second T20I between India and South Africa will be played on December 11 in Mullanpur.","India beat south africa by 101 runs in the first t20i at cuttack.

Pete Alonso ranks among the most well-known power hitters in Major League Baseball. Popularly called the “Polar Bear,” the slugging first baseman built his reputation on home runs and durability. After spending his entire early career with the New York Mets, Alonso started a new chapter in early 2025. He is now with the Baltimore Orioles, a move that quickly became one of the biggest talking points of the MLB offseason.Pete Alonso's net worth is projected to be around $25 million in 2025.

Top teams Sidney Crosby could play for next



Hockey fans love a good mystery, and few topics stir more curiosity than Sidney Crosby’s future. A new anonymous poll among NHL players has given that conversation fresh life. The answers reveal a clear theme. While the league changes fast, most players still believe Crosby will choose stability over spectacle. The poll, conducted by The Athletic with 120 participants, asked players where they think Crosby will play next. The responses hint at loyalty, superstition, and admiration that stretch far beyond Pittsburgh.The numbers lean heavily toward one conclusion. Nearly every player believes Crosby is still tied to the city he has called home since his first NHL shift. A non-Penguins player summed it up by saying, ""He's been a Penguin for all his career. Riding it out and playing all his years there, that would be a special moment for him."" That sentiment echoed again and again, building a picture of a superstar whose identity feels inseparable from his team.Players described Crosby with words that paint him as someone who values routine and long-term bonds. One said, ""I think he's a pretty loyal (guy) and seems like a guy who's going to spend his whole career in one place.""Another added that even though legends sometimes finish their careers elsewhere, Crosby’s steady nature makes him different. Some pointed to his habits, saying he “seems like a pretty superstitious guy,” which only strengthened their belief that he won’t pack up and move.Others made their opinions even more direct. ""I think Crosby is a Pen for life. I can't see him anywhere else."" Another added, ""I think he's extremely loyal."" One more said, «I think he finishes (his career) off in Pittsburgh.» A player even joked about his production with, ""And he'll probably score 100 points again. That seems like his going rate."" The idea that Pittsburgh would let him go felt unthinkable to some. ""They're not going to let him walk. They'd lose too many fans.""Still, the poll revealed two other teams that players see as realistic possibilities. Montreal came in second, a nod to Eastern Canadian roots and childhood fandoms. One player explained, ""If you grow up in Eastern Canada, you grow up a Habs fan, right? Just seems like Montreal would be an option."" Another admitted, ""I don't think Crosby will ever leave. But it would be Montreal if he did.""Colorado finished close behind, fueled by the idea of Crosby joining his close friend Nathan MacKinnon. As one player said, “To play with (Nathan) MacKinnon.” Another added that wherever Crosby ends up, he hopes ""it's a contender.""In the final tally, Pittsburgh earned 73.7 percent of the votes, Montreal 12.7 percent, and Colorado 11.9 percent. The results show how much respect Crosby holds in every dressing room. His future remains uncertain, yet the fascination around it remains one of the NHL’s most compelling storylines.Also Read: NHL Trade Rumors: Quinn Hughes emerges as a stunning Penguins target as blockbuster deadline possibilities heat up again","Sidney crosby's future remains one of the nhl's most compelling storylines.

Stephen Curry, the Golden State Warriors’ star player, has been with his wife, Ayesha Curry , even before he was drafted in the NBA.While Stephen Curry is pretty private, Ayesha Curry is more public about the things that happen in her life. The popular entrepreneur had opened up about what she feels when women approach Stephen Curry.A few years ago, in 2019, Ayesha Curry appeared on the now cancelled, Jada Pinkett Smith‘s show, Red Table Talk, where she opened up about women approaching Stephen Curry.Stephen Curry’s wife, Ayesha Curry, said, ""But there have been a couple of times, where I've wanted to punch somebody in the face for sure…”The popular entrepreneur added, “He can't see it coming, I see it from a mile away.""Stephen Curry’s wife, Ayesha Curry, continued, ""Stephen is very nice by nature…Everything is always very friendly, sometimes to the point where, 'I'm a grown woman,' so, I'll just insert myself and be like, 'Hello, how are you doing?'""She added that ""the ladies will always be lurking, hoping for their moment and waiting.""However, despite the fame and wealth, Stephen Curry has always remained deeply in love and committed to his wife, Ayesha Curry, and their beautiful children.Some of Ayesha Curry’s statements in the the now cancelled, Jada Pinkett Smith‘s show, Red Table Talk, had raised eyebrows then.In 2023, Stephen Curry’s wife, Ayesha Curry, opened up about the criticisms she had received for her comments and blamed Jada Pinkett Smith‘s show, Red Table Talk, for it.Ayesha Curry spoke to Business Insider about it and said, “It’s not what I said, and the context was weird…Yeah.

Could Quinn Hughes be the missing piece for the Penguins as fresh reports tie him to a blockbuster deadline move?





The talk around Quinn Hughes has taken a sharp turn tonight as the Pittsburgh Penguins have suddenly entered the conversation with real weight. The idea of Hughes leaving Vancouver has been simmering for weeks, but this new twist has pulled fresh eyes onto a saga that already had fans and analysts buzzing. Instead of slowing down, the story keeps gathering speed, and the timing could not be more dramatic with the season settling into its rhythm.What once looked like a simple list of suitors now appears more complex after a report connected Kyle Dubas and the Penguins to the superstar defenseman. Elliotte Friedman mentioned Pittsburgh as a team to watch, and that hint alone has sent the hockey world scrambling. The possibility of Hughes landing in a city hungry for another championship has added a new layer to a developing storyline.The Penguins have played with a sense of purpose this season, and their strong start has created real belief that the window for another Stanley Cup is still open. That urgency has fueled talk that management might swing big. If the team plans to give Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin one more deep run, Hughes would be a dream fit. His elite skating and playmaking could lift an already determined roster into a true contender.Friedman suggested that Dubas is ready to push hard to make a deal. Pittsburgh holds a deep prospect pool and future first round picks that could help the Canucks begin a full rebuild. For Vancouver, a partner willing to offer both high-end youth and long-term draft capital would be difficult to dismiss, especially if they choose to reset their direction.The real test lies in whether Hughes is open to signing long term in Pittsburgh. If he prefers a different landing spot, Dubas would need to consider the risk of acquiring him as a rental player. That uncertainty will shape how aggressive the Penguins become as the deadline approaches.With the New Jersey Devils still seen as a major contender because of the family ties, Pittsburgh’s late entry has changed the tone of the race. The final stretch will reveal whether the Penguins can turn interest into a blockbuster move worthy of the spotlight.Also Read: “I look for transparency, but..."": Billionaire owner Michael Andlauer opens up with surprising honesty about Brady Tkachuk tampering saga",Vancouver canucks defenseman quinn hughes has been linked to the pittsburgh penguins.

Quarterback Patrick Mahomes and player Travis Kelce struggled on the field. Brittany Mahomes, wife of Patrick Mahomes, remained silent on social media after the game. This quiet response mirrored the disappointment felt by many fans. The team's playoff hopes are now uncertain.

Kelce struggles, Mahomes takes heat, and Brittany distances herself from the chaos

Brittany Mahomes has never been shy about showing love for the Kansas City Chiefs, especially when her husband Patrick Mahomes takes the field at Arrowhead Stadium. From stadium arrivals to postgame celebrations, her Instagram is often filled with glam snapshots, family moments, and behind-the-scenes excitement. But Sunday’s matchup against the Houston Texans brought a different kind of energy and this time Britney chose not to post at all.After the Chiefs’ 20–10 defeat, the atmosphere among fans turned tense, and the blame quickly fell on both Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce for their lackluster performance. Instead of sharing her usual reactions, Brittany Mahomes went silent, leaving fans to interpret her disappointment without a word.Before kickoff, Brittany Mahomes seemed poised for another enthusiastic game day, sharing Instagram stories of the stadium buzz. Yet as the game unfolded, Kansas City Chiefs faltered early and never recovered. Kelce dropped late-game opportunities and the offense struggled to find rhythm, a shock to a fan base accustomed to polished comebacks. Once the loss was sealed, Brittany’s social feed suddenly stopped.No postgame thoughts. No family shots. Just silence.This isn’t the first time her online presence has mirrored the team’s emotional highs and lows. When the Chiefs win, Brittany often floods social media with celebration. But when they lose, fans get nothing at all, a silent statement that speaks louder than her usual hype. Making the night even more unusual, she also wasn’t seen alongside Taylor Swift and Selena Gomez, who attended separately in support of Travis Kelce.With this defeat, Kansas City Chiefs suffers more than a bruised ego. Their playoff hopes are now hanging by a thread, and for the first time in nine seasons, they’ve lost the AFC West crown, a title now held by the Denver Broncos. Their next game against the Chargers could determine whether their season lives or dies.As frustration among supporters rises, Brittany’s silence reflects what many Chiefs fans are feeling: uncertainty. The once-unstoppable dynasty suddenly looks fragile, and if Mahomes and Kelce don’t turn things around fast, the quiet moment on Brittany’s Instagram may be the least of Kansas City’s worries.Also Read: Brittany Mahomes sends a clear message to fans as they question Patrick Mahomes’ legacy during tough season","Brittany mahomes has never been shy about showing love for the kansas city chiefs.

Philip Rivers’ week 15 status: Will the Colts start the 44-year-old QB in Seattle?



The Indianapolis Colts have shocked the NFL by pulling 44-year-old Philip Rivers out of retirement after Daniel Jones went down with a season-ending Achilles injury. With the playoff race tightening and stability at quarterback slipping away, the Colts turned to a trusted veteran who already proved he can win in Indianapolis. Suddenly, Rivers is back in the building and potentially days away from returning to action.The biggest question heading into Week 15 is whether the former Pro Bowler will suit up against the Seattle Seahawks. Making a comeback at this stage of the season is rare, but the Colts’ situation might demand it. With a playoff berth still within reach, Indianapolis is evaluating just how quickly Rivers can get up to game speed.Rivers completed a private workout shortly after the Colts’ Week 14 loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars, and the front office liked what they saw. Impressed by his conditioning and familiarity with the system, the team signed him to the practice squad on Tuesday. Now, all attention turns toward how ready he is to take the field and whether he could start as soon as Sunday.As the team ramps up preparations for the Seahawks, the Colts continue to monitor everything from Rivers’ timing to his ability to re-adjust to NFL tempo.While nothing has been finalized, Indianapolis has made it clear they won’t hesitate to activate him if he proves capable of running the offense.Adding to the nostalgia of his return, Rivers will also reclaim his old jersey number. With Daniel Jones on injured reserve, the veteran quarterback will once again wear No. 17, the number he’s proudly represented throughout his entire career.Rivers’ history with Indianapolis gives him a strong head start. During his 2020 season with the Colts, he delivered steady and efficient play, completing 68% of his passes for 4,169 yards, 24 touchdowns, and 11 interceptions. That performance propelled the team to an 11-5 finish and a playoff berth, ending in a narrow Wild Card loss to the Buffalo Bills before Rivers announced his retirement.Now, nearly five years later, Indianapolis is hoping his leadership and precision can once again bring stability at the most crucial point of the season. Whether he starts in Week 15 or soon after, Rivers’ comeback adds a dramatic twist to the Colts’ playoff push, and all eyes will be on Seattle to see if the veteran’s return becomes reality this Sunday.Also Read: Philip Rivers returns to NFL at 44 to join Indianapolis Colts amid quarterback shortage, reveals NFL insider",Indianapolis colts signed 44-year-old philip rivers out of retirement on tuesday.

How Charlise Castro shaped her own career rather than being just a baseball wife

How George Springer and Charlise Castro's relationship grew through hard work and understanding

Charlise Castro’s life shows how identity and love can coexist for sports families

Charlise Castro’s life story reads far beyond the tag of being married to Toronto Blue Jays right fielder George Springer. She was a college standout long before she walked down the aisle, earning respect for her talent in softball and her later success in the wellness field. Her journey offers a look at how partners of elite athletes build their own paths while living in a world dominated by bright stadium lights and constant attention. Castro’s growth reflects ambition, resilience, and a firm belief that her identity deserves its own spotlight.Castro’s athletic journey began at the University at Albany where her strength at the plate turned her into a force in Division I softball. Her scholarship was earned, her achievements were celebrated, and her award as America East Player of the Year stamped her influence as one of the best young hitters in the country. Her selection to Puerto Rico’s national team only elevated her visibility, showing she could compete internationally. Yet her switch from professional play to personal development shows how she values reinvention over comfort.After graduating, Castro chose personal growth over lingering nostalgia for sport. She earned an MBA from the University of Saint Rose, taking her knowledge from the field into classrooms and business settings.That shift positioned her for a career in health, fitness, and wellness coaching where she could help others find confidence and balance. Her evolution showcases how athletes can turn discipline into leadership and passion into service.Castro has developed a quiet but credible space in the wellness world where she blends her business skills with lived athletic experience. Instead of promoting glamour without substance, she uses her platform to guide people toward stronger lifestyles. Even with Springer’s fame attracting followers, Castro’s work stands on its own credibility, supported by years of sport and education. She projects independence in a world where athlete spouses are often expected to stand behind.Castro first met Springer in 2011 when both were student athletes determining their futures. They bonded over long training days, competitive pressure, and goals that required sacrifice and patience. When Springer chased the majors, Castro chased academic achievement, creating parallel pursuits rather than one supporting role. Their connection deepened through understanding rather than dependency.The couple married in January 2018 in Newport Beach, California, in a setting suitable for two people balancing spotlight and family. The years since brought travel, clubhouse life, new homes, and eventually parenthood as they welcomed two children into the fold. Castro’s ability to nurture home life while working shows how she and Springer operate as a team, not as celebrity center and shadow. Their relationship reflects mutual ambition wrapped in family values.Today, Castro represents the changing narrative of partners in professional sports where wives create personal value instead of standing as silent figures on camera. Her athletic roots, career achievements, and steady role in Springer’s life make her part of his story without being overshadowed by it. Her journey is a reminder that balanced relationships in sports are built on choice, effort, and equal dreams. For George Springer, she remains his biggest supporter but also his truest match in drive and determination. Their story reminds everyone that shared ambition can build a lasting bond. It shows how two people can grow stronger when they move forward with the same purpose. It is this quiet understanding that makes their bond feel real and enduring always. And because of this, their relationship feels strong even in the toughest seasons together.Also read: Freddie Freeman and Ryan Reynolds’ SickKids video goes viral as fans explode with hilarious reactions online","Charlise castro is the wife of toronto blue jays right fielder george springer.

Philip Rivers return sparks family excitement and concern



Philip Rivers Media Availability : Dec 10

Philip Rivers stepped back into the NFL spotlight this week, carrying the same competitive spark he once showed on Sundays. The difference today is the weight of time. The longtime quarterback, who recently celebrated becoming a grandfather, now prepares for a potential return with the Indianapolis Colts at 44. While fans view his comeback as a feel-good twist to a turbulent season, those closest to him feel the intensity of what lies ahead. His wife Tiffany senses the physical reality of the league he once commanded with ease.Rivers spoke with an honest tone as he fielded questions about the surprise signing. His words made it clear that football instincts never fade, but life off the field can shift priorities. The excitement inside his home mixes with nerves, especially for Tiffany, who has lived through every high and low of his career.Rivers, now on the Colts practice squad after Daniel Jones’ injury on Dec. 7, addressed the tension his return brings. He said, ""My wife has been my biggest fan the whole time I played, and she's nervous about the physical aspect of it, as you expect any wife to."" He later explained that injuries were always part of the job. ""I mean, for 250 games or whatever it was, that was a risk, as you see every week."" He added, ""Whether you're 24 in the best shape, or you're 44 and not so sure.Anything can happen.""Despite the unpredictable nature of the sport, Rivers told reporters that fear never controlled him. ""That has never been a concern of mine,"" he said. His mindset remains steady. ""Dudes are big and fast, just like they were, so I'm just taking it one day at a time."" He joked that if he did get hurt, ""I'd have a long time to recover.""His children, who range from toddlers to adults, are pushing him on with enthusiasm. Some barely remember his Chargers days. Rivers shared, ""My six-year-old asked, 'Dad, why don't you play anymore?'"" His sons, he said, are ""fired up"" but still ask, ""'Dad, do you think you can do it?'""Rivers insisted he retired peacefully after 2021 and enjoyed coaching at St. Michael Catholic High School, but the competitive fire lingered. ""I didn't walk away because I felt like I was done,"" he said.Whether he takes the field in Seattle this Sunday will depend on how the week unfolds. For now, Rivers continues to prepare, balancing family nerves with a veteran’s calm as he steps toward an NFL return no one saw coming.Also Read: Colts owner Carlie Irsay-Gordon steps out in bold fit as she evaluates 44-year-old Philip Rivers on the field","Philip rivers reveals his wife’s ‘nervous’ reaction to his unexpected nfl comeback.

Carlie Irsay-Gordon and the Colts quarterback shake-up



The Indianapolis Colts walked into December looking like the feel-good surprise of the season. Now the mood around the team has shifted as three straight losses and the season-ending injury to quarterback Daniel Jones have forced a dramatic move. The sight of 44-year-old Phillip Rivers stepping back onto an NFL practice field created a swirl of curiosity. What made it more striking was team owner Carlie Irsay-Gordon standing on the sideline in an all-black outfit, watching every throw like someone determined to reshape her team’s fate.Rivers has not played since January 9, 2021, when the Colts lost a Wild Card game to the Buffalo Bills. He stepped away to focus on his family and help raise his ten kids while coaching high school football in Alabama. Seeing him back in a Colts helmet felt both nostalgic and surreal, but given the chaos at quarterback, it also made sense.The Colts have reached a point where they need solutions fast. Both Riley Leonard and Anthony Richardson are hurt, leaving the roster scrambling for stability. Rivers already knows Shane Steichen and the offensive system, so he was only a phone call away. The team signed him to the practice squad to evaluate him, and early signs show he still throws with the rhythm and power that once carried him past 60,000 yards and 400 touchdowns.His return became even more of a story when Irsay-Gordon arrived at practice in black gear with commando-style boots, almost like she was on her own scouting mission. Her presence was not for show. She has a reputation for being involved in every layer of football operations. She is also known for a line that people around the team still talk about. She once said she listens to play calls to learn where the team can improve, calling it a “scary micromanaging quote. ”At 45, the daughter of the late Jim Irsay has found her own leadership style. Fashion may get her noticed, but decisions like bringing in Rivers define her influence. If he takes the field Sunday against the Seattle Seahawks, the attention will shift from her outfit to the veteran quarterback who might get one more chance to save a season.Also Read: ""Off-balance and out of rhythm"": Is Patrick Mahomes the reason behind Chiefs' struggle?

Madison Beer: Blackmailed With My Nudes (Full Episode)

Madison Beer is entering a new chapter, one marked by emotional clarity, healthier relationships, and a willingness to confront the darkest moments of her past. In a powerful and vulnerable appearance on Alex Cooper’s Call Her Daddy podcast, the singer revisited the trauma she carried as a teenager when private photos of her were leaked online.The incident left her feeling isolated and exposed, fueling a belief that she “would die young” and pushing her toward two suicide attempts. Today, Madison speaks with a sense of healing she once thought she’d never reach, crediting her support system, including boyfriend and Los Angeles Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert , for helping her see life through a steadier, safer lens.During the conversation, Madison detailed the overwhelming shame and despair she felt when those images surfaced years ago. She explained that one of her attempts was directly tied to that moment, saying she had been unable to see a path forward.While she now views her life with more hope, she shared that she wishes she could go back and comfort her younger self, someone who desperately needed reassurance but had no idea how to ask for it.Her struggles, she admitted, didn’t stay confined to her teen years. Madison told Cooper that depression often seeped into her romantic relationships, leading to codependency and difficulty being alone.But something has shifted in her current relationship with Herbert. For the first time, she feels genuinely safe with a partner.She emphasized that she is with someone “who genuinely cares for her and someone she can truly trust,” a sentiment fans have noticed through their consistently low-key but supportive dynamic.Herbert, meanwhile, is navigating his own challenges on the field. Despite playing with a protected left hand following surgery, he led the Chargers to a gritty overtime win against the Eagles on December 8, helping the team secure second place in the AFC West.The quarterback’s resilience mirrors Madison’s emotional journey, two people rebuilding in different ways, yet aligned in their support for one another.Also Read: Justin Herbert and Madison Beer spark wedding buzz after ‘mother-in-law mode’ comment","Singer madison beer bravely shared her teenage trauma of leaked private photos, which led to suicidal thoughts and attempts.

I went a break down, had some chances in the first set but couldn’t use them. Zverev was serving very well, but I just tried to stick there mentally and play my best tennis when it came. To everyone here, my family, my girlfriend, my friends, and my whole team watching from home, thank you so much for your support.”Laila Hasanovic also cheered for him at the ATP Finals, making the season feel even more special. As Sinner grows as a champion, he is also learning how to balance his career and his personal life.In his interview with Vanity Fair in 2024 with writer Federico Rocca, Sinner said that it is not easy to keep a strong relationship because he travels so much. He explained, “Of course, it’s not easy. I travel a lot and during tournaments I’m very focused. But I think it’s a wonderful thing when you find the right love like everyone else.”He also said that many tennis greats have had families during their best years. He said, “And then, if you think about it, the best tennis players in the world all have wives and children.”Then he added a fun little detail about himself: “I’ve never been to a nightclub.

How Connor McDavid, J.T. Miller, and more are showing signs of decline in 2025

8 Minutes of J.T. Miller Highlight-Reel Plays

In this judgment, Father Time reflects on an NHL player’s performance evaluation between 2022-2025, taking into consideration The Athletic’s criteria of the player’s age (28–32), total period of no major injuries, and continuous decline in the statistics, as well as All-Star and contract of the players won’t weaken their case. This time, alongside Connor McDavid, Jordan Binnington, J.T. Miller, Filip Forsberg, and Linus Ullmark, analysts question whether the said stars’ stats reflect natural aging or just temporary troubles.Such cases are not really about panic, but rather they are pointing out some patterns in the related area of Usage, minutes, systems, and team performance. All these factors working together provide a clearer view of which players' struggles are only for a short time and which ones can be part of longer-term trajectories.It's J.T. Miller (Rangers) who is facing the most significant drop, going down from a 91-point pace in Vancouver to a 51-point projection this season. The Athletic mentions a decline in power-play production and fewer primary assists as major reasons for the decrease. His side, however, claims that Mikey Sullivan’s low-event system and his health problems are the main factors that affect his numbers. The judgment: there are indications of decline, but not enough to declare his high-end impact extinct.Jordan Binnington (Blues) comes into the picture with the lowest goals-above-expected number in the whole league. The prosecution brings forward various bad performances, while the defense states that St. Louis' issues and his historically over- and underperforming nature are factors contributing to the decline trend. The decision: significant drop, but still able to stabilize through a stronger second half.Connor McDavid (Oilers) surprises the most. Although the overall scoring is at the highest level, his 5-on-5 production is at the lowest in his career. The Athletic points out a consistent decline over the last five years in primary chances, shots, and possession metrics. His defense asserts that these circumstances are mainly due to heavy minutes and constant line rotations. The verdict: not an even-strength giant as before, but still very much a capable and top-level team.Filip Forsberg (Predators) seems to be the most affected player as he feels the negative impact of reduced power-play utilization and cannot find suitable words to explain the slowed-down bursts of speed. His defense claims that it is Nashville's weak power play that has been hindering his numbers from growing higher. The verdict: team-inflicted slow down rather than loss of personal skills.Linus Ullmark (Senators) has a tough time with his save percentage and is regularly caught in highly dangerous situations from which he will eventually get shot at. His camp is adamant that it is only a temporary setback. The ruling: the bar has been lowered, but still not so that one can’t hope for improvement.According to The Athletic’s ratings, the decline of any of these athletes is not necessarily by all means. There are some alarming signs that accompany each case, but allow for a recovery as well. The 2025 season is a decisive one—a comeback or giving Time That Father half a year of stronger proof next year.Also Read: Why was Max Domi left out vs. the Washington Capitals, and will he get another chance this weekend?","Connor mcdavid, jordan binnington, j.t.
