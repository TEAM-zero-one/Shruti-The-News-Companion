How Arthur Jones’ net worth translates in 2025

Breaking down Arthur Jones’ NFL contracts and career earnings

Arthur Jones’ net worth is once again being discussed following his untimely death at 39 on October 3, 2025. The former Baltimore Ravens defensive tackle, remembered as a Super Bowl champion and older brother to UFC legend Jon Jones and Pro Bowler Chandler Jones, built a successful NFL career that brought in millions. But as with many professional athletes, the reality of his take-home wealth is more complicated than the headlines.As financial experts often note, headline contract numbers don’t equate to net worth. Federal and state taxes, agent fees, and union dues typically cut nearly half of a player’s paycheck. After these deductions, plus living expenses and the uncertainties of retirement, Jones’ wealth would have settled into a more modest figure.Factoring in his career contracts, time missed, and standard post-career costs, a conservative estimate places Arthur Jones’ net worth in 2025 at roughly $4 million to $8 million. This range reflects the large Colts contract, offset by injuries and early release, along with the assumption of prudent — but not flawless — investing.Jones entered the league in 2010 as a fifth-round draft pick of the Baltimore Ravens. His breakout came during the 2012 season when he played a pivotal role in the team’s Super Bowl XLVII victory over the San Francisco 49ers. That success helped set the stage for his biggest payday.In March 2014, Jones signed a five-year contract with the Indianapolis Colts worth around $33 million, averaging nearly $6 million per season. While the deal was lucrative, his time in Indianapolis was impacted by injuries and a suspension, which reduced the total payout he received compared to the full contract value. The Colts released him in 2017, after which he signed briefly with Washington before retiring.Taking into account his Ravens salary, the Colts deal, and his final season in Washington, Jones’ career earnings likely exceeded $20 million in gross NFL cash.Also Read: “Arthur wouldn’t hesitate to…”: Jon Jones’ touching remarks gain new meaning after tragic passing of Super Bowl champion Arthur Jones While financial curiosity surrounds his career, Arthur Jones is ultimately remembered for his impact on the field and in the locker room.

For fans, teammates, and family alike, Jones’ legacy is less about spreadsheets and more about his role as a champion, a mentor, and a brother.","Arthur jones' net worth is once again being discussed following his untimely death at 39 on october 3, 2025.

He was seen using crutches and wearing a walking boot in practice midweek.He also missed all sessions this week. Head coach Todd Bowles confirmed Bucky Irving underwent an MRI, and the team hopes to know more by Friday.

Luka Doncic's Injury Update for Preseason Game 1

Los Angeles Lakers’ Strategy Without Luka Doncic

What Fans Can Expect from the Lakers

, will not play in tonight’s preseason opener against the Phoenix Suns. He has also been ruled out of the October 5, 2025 matchup against the Golden State Warriors. The decision was reached jointly by Doncic and the Lakers organization, with a focus on pacing his return after a demanding offseason and prioritizing long-term readiness. Luka Doncic ’s summer was highlighted by his participation in the 2025 EuroBasket tournament, where he put on dazzling performances. Among his standout moments was a 39-point game in the quarterfinals against Germany. While his efforts carried Slovenia deep into the competition, the heavy workload prompted the Los Angeles Lakers to manage his preseason minutes carefully to avoid fatigue and possible setbacks.The 26-year-old guard shed weight in the offseason and has been gradually adjusting during Lakers training camp. Head coach JJ Redick has emphasized a new focus on conditioning and injury prevention following the team’s disappointing first-round playoff exit last season. The approach is designed to have Doncic at peak strength when the regular season begins, rather than pushing him into early preseason contests.While not dealing with any serious issues, Doncic did sustain a minor right knee contusion during EuroBasket. He noted needing therapy after a knock in one of the games but reassured fans that he was fine. This minor injury further supports the Lakers’ cautious stance, especially given that this will be Doncic’s first full season with Los Angeles after being acquired in a blockbuster trade from Dallas earlier in the year.With Luka Doncic sitting out, the Los Angeles Lakers will use the preseason opener against the Suns to experiment with rotations and build chemistry among the roster. The focus will be on evaluating supporting players and testing lineups, ensuring the team develops balance while waiting for their new franchise centerpiece to take the court.Although Doncic won’t play in the first two preseason games, fans can expect him back later in the exhibition schedule or by the regular season opener. The team’s long-term strategy is to keep him healthy and fully prepared for the grueling 82-game campaign.Also read: Los Angeles Lakers vs Phoenix Suns Preseason Game 1 Key Injury Report (October 3, 2025): Who’s Playing, Who’s Out, and More Luka Doncic’s absence from the first two preseason games is not the result of a serious injury, but rather a strategic move by the Los Angeles Lakers.

Despite McDavid's potential for a record-setting salary, the Oilers face significant cap challenges due to existing high-value contracts. McDavid prioritizes winning a Stanley Cup, suggesting he might accept less to ensure a competitive team, forcing Edmonton to find creative financial solutions.

Frank Seravalli weighs in on Connor McDavid’s future after Kirill Kaprizov’s $136M deal

Connor McDavid’s goal: The best team around him with a genuine chance to win

Level of concern with McDavid potentially leaving?

Connor McDavid’s dilemma is to win now or cap later

Connor McDavid’s future with the Edmonton Oilers has once again taken center stage in NHL contract discussions. After Minnesota Wild forward Kirill Kaprizov secured an eight-year, $136 million extension this week, the attention immediately shifted to what Edmonton’s superstar captain might demand when his next deal comes up. The Oilers are already weighed down by big-money contracts that could limit how far they can go for McDavid.While McDavid is expected to set the market whenever he signs, Edmonton’s financial structure complicates the picture. The Oilers are currently locked into expensive long-term commitments. Leon Draisaitl’s $14 million salary, Evan Bouchard’s double-digit deal, and Darnell Nurse’s $9.25 million contract already consume a large portion of the cap. On top of that, goaltender Stuart Skinner is due for a significant raise in the near future.NHL insider Frank Seravalli highlighted this challenge, stating, ""They can't, I don't think the Edmonton Oilers can afford to go more. In fact, I don't think on their cap that they can really even afford to go 17 million, um, because of all the other deals that they've got."" Edmonton's potential with McDavid is limited due to cap pressure.That kind of financial squeeze makes it difficult for the Oilers to entertain numbers north of $17 million annually — a figure that insiders believe McDavid could command. Even with the NHL’s salary cap set to climb in the coming seasons, Edmonton’s roster construction leaves little margin to maneuver.Oilers GM Stan Bowman addressed Connor McDavid’s contract situation on Wednesday, admitting there is still no clarity on whether the superstar captain will have a new deal before the regular season begins. Bowman revealed via TSN that ongoing talks with McDavid’s agent Judd Moldaver remain frequent but offered no firm timeline, stressing, “I don’t like to make predictions, we’ll see where it goes.”Beyond the financial puzzle, McDavid’s decision may come down to competitiveness. The Oilers have enjoyed success over the past two years, but McDavid understands that aging players, a thin prospect pipeline, and limited draft picks can quickly derail momentum.For McDavid, the question is not simply “how much” but “how far can this team go?” He has made it clear throughout his career that chasing a Stanley Cup defines his priorities. That means Edmonton must strike a balance — paying its franchise player while still building the depth required to compete against the league’s best.Kaprizov’s blockbuster contract raised expectations league-wide, but McDavid’s case is different. He may ultimately accept less than his maximum value if it ensures the Oilers remain contenders. At the same time, Edmonton must find creative ways to manage the salary cap or risk losing the most dominant player in the game.McDavid’s decision will shape not just the Oilers’ future, but also the landscape of the NHL. His contract situation is now one of the defining storylines of the league.Also Read: Leon Draisaitl’s wife Celeste Desjardins just can’t stop reliving her dream wedding; Labels it “Happiest day of our lives”","Connor mcdavid's contract future with the edmonton oilers is under intense scrutiny following kirill kaprizov's massive deal.

McIlroy’s Calm Amid Chaos



A Front-Row View From Zola



Fan THROWS beer at Rory McIlroy’s wife at Ryder Cup

Italian football icon Gianfranco Zola has praised McIlroy for his calmness and dignity throughout the Ryder Cup at Bethpage Black when this Northern Irish golfer was subjected to waves of hostility from sections of the American crowd. McIlroy stood tall throughout withstanding relentless pressure and putting in one of his best Ryder Cup showings that sealed the 15-13 win for the Europeans.Ryder Cup has always had the glare of being a heated edition, yet this one crossed so many boundaries. European players were singled out for heckling, booing, and demeaning chants, more so McIlroy. At one point, McIlroy's wife, Erica Stoll, was taunted harshly, and an American gentleman tossed a cup of beer in her direction, leaving her sobbing.The abuse went a notch higher when the host of the Ryder Cup Heather McMahan led a rude chant against McIlroy, an event which ultimately led to her resignation; and on another occasion, McIlroy was called a homophobic name as he got ready to play. It aroused massive conversation about fan behavior and the limits of sportsmanship in golfing.Sarcastically and ironically, McIlroy had blown kisses at the hecklers during the first day.However, by the fifteenth tee time on day two, patience had gone beyond McIlroy, refusing to putt until the fans cooled off. Even then, his demeanor was extremely calm.Making an eye-catching 4-1-0 record in his matches, the best ever in a Ryder Cup, McIlroy was able to focus his fury and hence play a huge role in Europe's victory.Being a guest at the tournament who, at times, was even allowed to drive a buggy thanks to his affiliation with vice-captain Francesco Molinari, Zola experienced the onslaught of abuse firsthand. In an interview with La Gazzetta dello Sport, the Chelsea legend expressed his dissatisfaction at the concerted efforts to create such a bad atmosphere.""Obviously the fans went too far,"" said Zola. “Some people came to Bethpage too hyped up and then found the wrong way to vent their frustrations with insults and aggression directed mainly at McIlroy, the strongest player. They were afraid.""Praising McIlroy’s response, Zola added: ""Because he's the greatest of them all, he was fantastic, he responded like a gentleman and a champion, as did Shane Lowry, who was playing with him.Not being caught up by hostility, McIlroy's resilience earned points for Team Europe, setting the example to rise above the negativity. According to Zola, the Northern Irishman showed true champions win with talent and character, creating a legacy sometimes far greater than the actual winning.","Gianfranco zola has praised rory mcilroy for his calmness and dignity throughout the ryder cup at bethpage black.

Many fans want to know the money details behind their heroes, so here are the top five players with the most career earnings while with the Bills.Josh Allen shines as the quarterback who turned the Bills into a strong team with his strong throws and fast runs on the ground. He has passed for more than 167 touchdowns and keeps guiding the group at just 28 years old, with lots more wins ahead.His big money comes from a 2021 deal and a new six-year one in 2025 for $330 million total. So far, Allen has pocketed $232,610,993 from the Bills, topping all others in team records. Plus, his yearly pay now sits high among all league players.Stefon Diggs added exciting catches to the Bills, with 445 grabs for 5,372 yards and 37 scores in only 65 games played. He left after the 2023 season for another squad, but his four years boosted the attack side greatly.Money flowed from changed contracts full of extra bonuses and goals met, adding up to $77,450,882 earned with the Bills.On top of that, Diggs often topped team lists in big numbers, showing his steady top play every time.Jerry Hughes gave solid help on defense for the Bills across nine full years, collecting 350 stops, 117 hits on quarterbacks, and 53 sacks in 144 matches. He started in 2013 after a team switch and grew into a main backup known for lasting long and pushing rivals hard.Deals had many add-ons and bonuses over time, pushing his total take to $71,365,000 from the group. What is more, Hughes built respect as an older guide for the front-line defenders.Tre'Davious White climbed fast to the top cornerback level in the NFL , winning Pro Bowl spots and All-Pro nods in his first six seasons with the Bills. He came back in 2025 after a short time away and has shone since day one as a rookie in 2017.Also Read: NFL to launch pro men's and women's Flag Football Leagues ahead of 2028 Olympics in LA, confirms Commissioner Roger Goodell Contracts packed big payments and extra rewards, leading to $69,062,023 made with the team up to now.

His numbers dropped a bit later on, yet he stayed a scary rusher for passes during those four seasons.A huge six-year pact for $100 million fueled his cash flow to $67,400,000 with the squad. Still, that early-loaded agreement pointed out the ups and downs of spending big on free players.","The buffalo bills have a rich history filled with talented players who earned big salaries for their great work on the field.

Maple Leafs roster moves after Scott Laughton injury

Scott Laughton’s career achievements and comeback outlook

News of Scott Laughton's injury left Maple Leafs fans concerned, as he is due to miss a couple of weeks. The Maple Leafs confirmed that Laughton, who showed promise in the preseason games, had suffered a lower-body injury during the Thursday night game against the Detroit Red Wings. This roadblock comes at a very crucial time, with Laughton eager to make his mark in the full season with Toronto following a trade that moved his young career on a new trajectory with the team.On the morning of Friday, the Maple Leafs announced that Laughton would be week-to-week with a lower-body injury. The 27-year-old forward was acquired last season at the trade deadline for Nikita Grebenkin and a first-round pick. Laughton was struggling at the start of his 20 regular-season games, yet he began to show glimpses in the postseason of the player Toronto hopes to be relying on this season.Laughton has been pretty straightforward about how a mid-season trade affected his performances, but the whole summer spent in Toronto allowed him to settle. In good momentum going into the season with 20-year-old Easton Cowan and fan favorite Steven Lorentz on the fourth line, Laughton would undergo another unexpected injury that brought more uncertainty and forced the Leafs to reconsider their final roster choices for Kampf, Jarnkrok, and Robertson, all in line for first-team action.Entering the contract's back end, Scott Laughton was set from the get-go to make an immediate impact and earn an extension. A Toronto product, he has embraced the city and the team as a whole, building chemistry with the younger guys like Cowan while also serving as a veteran presence. The fans have embraced him for the energy, effort, and heart he puts on the ice, and the feeling of his absence is huge in that respect.Hopefully, he can get well soon, and that will allow him to get back on the ice, strengthening the Leafs. His presence on the ice is going to be vital to Toronto's hopes this season in terms of scoring depth and leadership on the lower lines.A temporary Laughton injury spells trouble for Toronto. Fans and teammates alike are wishing for his speedy recovery and return to the lineup to continue helping on and off the ice.Also Read: Why Jack Roslovic turned down Edmonton: Inside the NHL free agent decision",Scott laughton suffered a lower-body injury during the thursday night game against the detroit red wings.

Los Angeles Lakers vs Phoenix Suns Preseason Game 1: Betting Recommendations and Prop Plays

What to Expect from the Los Angeles Lakers vs Phoenix Suns Matchup

The NBA preseason tips off in style with thegame this Friday at the Acrisure Arena. More than just a warm-up, this matchup sets the stage for the 2025-26 season with two historic Western Conference rivals testing new lineups, strategies, and depth. Both teams enter with different trajectories from last year, but the intensity of their rivalry ensures an exciting start to the basketball calendar.Early predictions give the Los Angeles Lakers a slight advantage, largely due to their past success against the Suns and their consistency in recent meetings. Playing at home further boosts their chances. Still, Los Angeles is dealing with key absences - most notably LeBron James - which could disrupt their rhythm. That gives Phoenix, with Devin Booker leading the charge and new head coach Jordan Ott implementing his system, a real shot at an upset or at least covering the slim +1.5 spread.Oddsmakers currently list the Lakers as the betting favorite with moneyline odds near -159, while the Phoenix Suns sit as underdogs at around +135. The spread hovers between -1.5 and -2.5 in favor of Los Angeles, signaling how close this contest could be. The projected total points range from 219 to 229, which makes sense for a preseason opener that will likely feature faster tempos, experimental rotations, and less focus on defensive structure.For bettors, Phoenix covering the spread or a moneyline play on the Suns could be a smart value given the Lakers’ shorthanded roster.The Lakers wrapped up the 2024-25 season with a 50-32 record, capturing the Pacific Division title and finishing third in the West. Their playoff run ended earlier than hoped, but they remain a top-tier squad. Statistically, they sit in the middle of the pack across most categories but excel at free-throw shooting and three-point efficiency. Even without LeBron or Luka Doncic logging heavy preseason minutes, their depth and the growth of role players should keep them competitive.The Suns finished last season at 36-46, missing the playoffs after ranking 27th in defensive rating. Their offense, however, was respectable with an offensive rating of 114.7, largely powered by Booker. The offseason brought major change, with Jordan Ott stepping in as head coach and fresh roster pieces intended to fix their defensive flaws. Expectations are on building cohesion and discipline while maintaining offensive firepower.Historically, the Lakers have held a slight upper hand, particularly on home court. Their last preseason clash ended in a dramatic overtime tie at 113-113, showing just how tightly contested these games can be. A notable trend is Los Angeles’ inability to pull away comfortably, as 11 of their last 14 games were decided by three points or fewer. Meanwhile, Phoenix battled through an eight-game road losing streak last season, underlining both their struggles and their potential to bounce back with the right adjustments.• Back the Suns to cover the +1.5 spread for better safety.• While the Lakers’ moneyline is reasonable, bettors should monitor final lineup confirmations.• The total points over 219.5 looks appealing given the likelihood of open, free-flowing play.• Player props: Devin Booker’s scoring over is worth attention, while Austin Reaves’ assist or points totals could present value.• Keep an eye on rookies and bench players - preseason often gives them the chance to shine past expectations.Preseason basketball isn’t about wins and losses as much as it is about experimentation and rhythm. For the Suns, Ott may stress defensive schemes while evaluating how new players fit his system. For the Lakers, the absence of superstars means testing depth and refining rotations will be a priority. Fans can expect stretches of high-scoring runs, loose defensive setups, and flashes of brilliance from rising talents eager to prove themselves.The Suns vs. Lakers preseason opener promises more than just warm-up basketball. With new coaching philosophies, roster shake-ups, and the backdrop of a classic rivalry, this matchup provides both fans and bettors a first taste of what the 2025-26 season could bring. Expect a tight, fast-paced contest full of intrigue, strategy, and fresh storylines.","The nba preseason tips off in style with the los angeles lakers vs phoenix suns game this friday at the acrisure arena.

Fans and analysts on both sides of the river are abuzz on what it might mean for Vegas and the league in terms of salary, tax advantages, and top-notch Eichel performance as the Knights' No. 1 center.NHL insider Elliotte Friedman spoke on the 32 Thoughts podcast to give some inside insight, stating that the Golden Knights view Jack Eichel as a franchise cornerstone and a future Stanley Cup winner. ""I heard that in the summer, when they signed Marner, they knew that Eichel was going to go past him...They recognized Eichel, the number one center, a Stanley Cup team, and a hugely valuable player for them.""According to Friedman, some teams were expecting Vegas to target $13 million amounts for Eichel, but sources say the Knights might actually be looking at something in the range of $25 million combined with Marner's salary. In and of itself, this huge extension is justified in terms of Eichel's value last season, which also included a career-high 94 points in 77 games.Further, Nevada's no-state-tax implication would make even higher salaries conceivable than if they had to pay taxes like in a high-tax state like Minnesota, where Kaprizov signed his huge deal. Friedman stated, ""I think Eichel knows he's not going to get to 17, but where's the sweet spot? You know, one of the things that Vegas is a no-tax state, Minnesota is a high-tax state.""Jack Eichel, with his goal-scoring, playmaking, and leadership abilities, has rapidly emerged as the heart of the Golden Knights' offense. Going into the last year of his current contract, he is very much focused on the season and holds that the contract negotiations tend to take care of themselves if one keeps their focus on the right things. GM Kelly McCrimmon has also stressed that re-signing Eichel is a priority, thus making the upcoming negotiations critical to the long-term success of the team. Given Eichel's record-breaking stats and leadership qualities, as well as Vegas's own strategic advantages, this deal could be a landmark contract in the NHL.If Jack Eichel’s next contract ends up in excess of Mitch Marner's $96 million contract, then it will set a new standard for great centers in the NHL. With the insiders' input, Eichel's career-high season, and the Golden Knights' commitment, the fans definitely have something to look forward to as the league looks on as this huge negotiation unfolds.Also Read: Why Jack Roslovic turned down Edmonton: Inside the NHL free agent decision","Nhl insider elliotte friedman spoke on the 32 thoughts podcast to give some inside insight, stating that the golden knights view jack eichel as a franchise cornerstone and a future stanley cup winner.
