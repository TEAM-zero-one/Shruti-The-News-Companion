Raptors’ Perspective

A Potential Turning Point for Chicago

The, still in the thick of a rebuild after missing the postseason in seven of the past eight years, could be preparing for a significant roster shake-up. A recent trade pitch from Mark Morales-Smith of SI.com suggests the team could send forwardto thein exchange for wing scorer RJ Barrett.Morales-Smith’s mock deal positions Barrett as a potential cornerstone for the Chicago Bulls ’ young core, which already features Josh Giddey , Matas Buzelis, Isaac Okoro, and recent No. 12 pick Noa Essengue.The Chicago Bulls remains in a contract stalemate with Giddey this summer, but plans to offer him a long-term extension are in motion. With promising frontcourt depth in place, the front office could be open to moving on from Patrick Williams, whose production hasn’t matched expectations since being drafted fourth overall in 2020.Despite an underwhelming track record, the Bulls extended Patrick Williams in June 2024 on a five-year, $90 million deal. Trading him for Barrett - who has posted All-Star-level numbers - would immediately give Chicago a dynamic scoring threat. Barrett would likely slot in as the team’s No. 1 offensive option, replacing some of the load that might be lost if Coby White departs in free agency next summer.Barrett, 25, has consistently proven his offensive value, averaging at least 19.6 points per game in each of the last four seasons. In his first full season with Toronto during 2024-25, he delivered:His scoring ability, rebounding presence, and playmaking would not only boost Chicago’s offense but also bring balance to a roster currently leaning on young talent with untapped potential.For the Toronto Raptors , this deal could be about adding long-term assets while gaining a young forward in Patrick Williams, who still carries upside despite inconsistent performance. Jevon Carter’s inclusion adds depth at the guard spot, and the first-round pick strengthens the Raptors’ asset base.Also read: Warriors Rumors: Golden State Predicted to Cut Ties with Jonathan Kuminga for $69 Million Chicago Bulls Superstar Morales-Smith summed up the reasoning behind the swap by noting that moving on from Patrick Williams for Barrett “would fit Chicago’s rebuild and provide the team with a talented wing to pair with its young core.” If executed, the trade could mark a decisive step in reshaping the Chicago Bulls into a competitive force in the Eastern Conference over the next few seasons.","A recent trade pitch from mark morales-smith of si.com suggests the team could send forward patrick williams to toronto in exchange for wing scorer rj barrett.

Fortnite has recently announced its highly awaited collaboration with the Power Rangers. In this crossover, we will see The Mighty Morphin Power Rangers take action against the Kraken-borne bugs in Chapter 6 Season 4 in Fortnite.From the Mighty Morphin Megazord to themed weapons like the Swarmstrike Launcher and the OG “Go Go Power Rangers” theme song, this collaboration will have everything it it. However, the highlight of this collab has to be the Power Rangers costume, which fans can get early even before its actual release.Just like players were able to notch up the Fantastic Four skins early before their release by participating in the Fantastic Four Cup in Fortnite, now there is another couple of tournaments which can grant two Power Ranger skins early - Red Ranger Cup and Pink Ranger Cup.Both the cups are going to take place on August 6, 2025. These are going to be solo tournaments, where players will take part in standard Battle Royale matches. Players need to check out the in-game Compete tab to know the exact timings of these tournaments as they will vary depending upon different locations and time zones.The Red and Pink Rangers Cup will be available for only three hours. In this short span, players can enter a maximum of 10 matches per cup.If you are thinking about maximizing your chances by taking part in both the cups, then keep in mind that they will become live simultaneously and will expire at the same time. So, it is advised to the fans to only focus on one cup at a time.As the name suggests, these two cups will grant the Red Ranger and Pink Ranger outfits respectively. But how to get them? In order to obtain these skins for absolutely free, players need to be on the top spots for different regions in these tournaments. Players can score points to be in the leaderboards by winning matches and eliminating opponent players. Here is the region wise breakdown and top spots to secure the skins:Another interesting fact about these cups are that, these aren't region locked. So, if you are facing difficulties to be in the leaderboard in your native regions, then you will always have the option to change your server to any location for a favorable condition.However, those who fail to be in the top spots in these two cups, don’t need to be disappointed at all. If any player manages to score 8 points in either of the tournaments, then he will be rewarded with the Jason’s Mark Spray (Red Ranger Cup) or the Kimberly Was Here Spray (Pink Ranger Cup) or both.Usually players get their rewards from such tournaments immediately after these end. But the Red Ranger and Pink Ranger outfits will be available to the tournament winners at the start of Chapter 6 Season 4.Apart from the two tournaments, the Season 4 Battle Pass has also featured two different power ranger skins as well - the Green Ranger and the White Ranger.","Red and pink power ranger cups will grant players power ranger skins.

WWE's Friday Night SmackDown's August 8th edition was another episode set around the fallout from SummerSlam 2025. Live from the Bell Centre in Montreal, Quebec, this SmackDown edition is only a week after the big 2-night event in New Jersey - SummerSlam 2025. Fans expected an appearance from John Cena , and he didn't disappoint. He opened the show to loud cheers from the audience, who loved having the real and face Cena back among them.John Cena obviously was going to address what happened at the end of that night at SummerSlam, and the return of none other than Brock Lesnar back to the ring after more than a year of absence. Cena talks about the crowd and how loud and warm it was. He said he feared leaving it all behind after 2 decades in this business, and that people would forget about him once he leaves. He also fears Lesnar, but he is not going to let that hold him down.The Cenation leader says that if Brock Lesnar wanted some, he could come and get some. Just then, Logan Paul makes his entrance to loud boos from the audience as usual. He mocks Cena for turning face again, and says since Cena was giving out matches, he wants one. He proposes a face-off at Clash in Paris when Drew McIntyre attacks Cena from behind.Things were getting a little tough for Cena with these two after him, but just then, none other than Cody Rhodes makes his appearance, and the crowd goes wild.He and Cena make quick work of Paul and McIntyre, and Cena accepts Paul's challenge for Clash in Paris, but before that Rhodes and he will fight Paul and McIntyre in a tag team match tonight. The fans are eating.The first fight of the night is a tag team match between The Motor City Machine Guns vs. Talla Tonga and JC Mateo of Solo Sikoa's faction, MFT. The latter makes quick work of the MCMG and comes out on top after a chokeslam from Talla Tonga on Chris Sabin.Of course, after the match, Solo Sikoa comes to the stage. After hyping the MFT, he says that it's a shame that he is all geared up and ready to fight, but there is no one to fight him. Just then, WWE ’s SmackDown GM Nick Aldis makes an appearance and says since Sikoa is so ready to fight, he has someone he can fight. None other than Sami Zayn comes in, and we have our next match ready to go.The match starts after Sami Zayn is done basking in the cheers of the Montreal crowd. Solo Sikoa tries to back Zayn into a corner, but the latter is not having that. When it seems like Zayn is getting the upper hand, Tala Tonga runs interference, Zayn beckons him when Sikoa comes from behind. But Zayn anticipated that and goes for a folding press, taking the win.Backstage Charlotte Flair tells her tag team partner, Alexa Bliss , that since it's the latter's birthday tomorrow, she got her a gift. But she will give it to her on the stage with grandeur. The Allies of Convenience then make their entrance to loud cheering from the Montreal crowd. Flair shows Bliss her gifts - a cake (for both of them) and a tag team partner for Lilly - Charlie, both wearing a WE'RE NOT FRIENDS T-shirt like Little Miss Bliss.And just when everyone thought we were getting a hug from the two non-friends, Chelsea Green and her Secret Hervice make their entrance. Green begins to talk smack to the Tag Team Champions, and Flair says since it's Bliss' birthday, she is ready to give her another present - a show to a fight with Chelsea Green. The Secret Hervice and their leader tried to dodge and flee, but Nick Aldis comes in once more and gives Bliss his own little gift - a brand new referee whose first match is going to be overseeing the one between Flair and Green. And we have our next fight ready to go.Both women inside the ring - Charlotte Flair and Chelsea Green - are powerful and talented. And they bring it to the ring. Flair goes for her opponent with everything she's got, but Green is not one to be quiet about it. Flair goes for a German suplex, Green counters with a superplex. Green gains momentum for a while, and asks Piper Niven and Alba Fyre to bring in the cake that Flair had gotten for Alexa Bliss' birthday.Unfortunately, for Chelsea Green, the plan backfired. While Bliss takes out the Secret Hervice, Flair goes for a killswitch into the cake. And finally, a Figure Eight proves too much for Green who has no other choice but to accept defeat.The segment ends with Flair and Bliss eating the very cake that Flair used to smash Chelsea Green's face into.We also get a little backstage segment of John Cena and R-Truth getting to catch-up backstage. Truth says if Cena is back, then he is back, and it adds to a fun moment before the tag team stage is set for the night.The last match of the night is between Cody Rhodes & John Cena vs. Drew McIntyre & Logan Paul. Rhodes and Paul start it off with McIntyre and Cena on the sidelines. The American Nightmare bashes into his opponent, and soon after, he gives the tag to the Scottish Psychopath. Then it's one after the other as McIntyre and Paul go in and out of the ring, but Rhodes is stuck without being able to tag in his partner.The crowd is chanting ""We want Cena,"" but it is while before Rhodes can finally tag John Cena in. Shoulder block after shoulder block, Cena goes to pin The Maverick after an Attitude Adjustment, but McIntyre interrupts before the three count. Rhodes comes in to block a Claymore from McIntyre and the referee calls it.Cena and Paul continue fighting backstage, while Rhodes and McIntyre are still in it. The latter blasts Rhodes with his own championship belt and then pushes him through the table after a Claymore. The night ends with McIntyre talking smack into Cody's ears as he lies there unable to move.Also Read: “I’m happy to have him back”: Paul Heyman defends Brock Lesnar’s return to WWE","Wwe's friday night smackdown's august 8th edition was another episode set around the fallout from summerslam 2025.

The future of Connor McDavid in the National Hockey League (NHL) has never looked more uncertain or more thrilling. As the face of the Edmonton Oilers, McDavid has been expected to re-sign and carry the team into another championship run. But now, insiders say a single factor could tip the scales in favor of a bombshell move to the Toronto Maple Leafs, led by none other than fellow superstar Auston Matthews.Despite ongoing discussions with the Oilers, McDavid has yet to finalize an extension deal, sparking whispers across the NHL. The delay follows Edmonton’s recent Stanley Cup Finals defeat to the Florida Panthers, which may have raised questions about the team’s long-term competitiveness and direction. While McDavid remains under contract, the league is already buzzing with the possibility of him testing free agency in 2026.At the heart of McDavid’s decision lies more than just money. Sources suggest lifestyle, team trajectory, and his legacy in the game may all be weighing heavily on his mind. The Edmonton Oilers are prepared to throw down a historic offer that could surpass anything the NHL has seen, but whether that’s enough remains to be seen.If McDavid decides to stay, the Oilers will maintain one of the most dangerous cores in hockey. But if he opts to join Matthews in Toronto, the NHL landscape will shift dramatically, potentially setting up a new era of Eastern Conference dominance.For now, the hockey world waits.

When he fought Hata, he was coming off two straight wins.In response to his death, the Japan Boxing Commission announced it will only sanction 10 Rounds for future OPBF title wins from the 12 Rounds in an effort to prevent him and others from suffering similar injuries.Though welcomed, many in the boxing community will say Shigetoshi Kotari's death will leave a lasting impact on boxing. Shigetoshi Kotari’s passing is a heartbreaking reminder of boxing’s risks. His courage in the ring inspired many, and his loss has sparked important changes aimed at protecting fighters. The sport will never forget him, and safety must come first moving forward.","Shigetoshi kotari, a promising 28-year-old japanese boxer, has died just six days after a major title fight. He entered the ring at tokyo's korakuen hall on august 2 to fight yamato hata for the opbf super featherweight title. He went 12 full rounds, ending in a split draw, before collapsing in his corner.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123197925,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-17628,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Friday night’s preseason game between the Detroit Lions and Atlanta Falcons at Mercedes‑Benz Stadium came to a sudden stop when Lions safety Morice Norris was taken off the field in an ambulance after a hard hit. With 14:50 left in the fourth quarter, Norris went low to tackle Falcons rookie running back Nathan Carter. His facemask hit Carter’s midsection, and his head snapped back from the impact. Medical staff treated Norris on the field for nearly 20 minutes before he was wheeled away to the Grady Memorial Hospital.During the delay, athletes from both teams joined hands on the field in a gesture of unity. Once medical personnel and the ambulance cleared the area, play technically resumed – with Falcons quarterback Emory Jones taking a snap, though nobody was really ready to compete. With 6:31 remaining, an official announced the game was suspended “per New York.” At that time, Detroit held a 17‑10 lead.Detroit Lions head coach Dan Campbell said that the decision came from the coaching teams, not the league office. “Raheem Morris is the ultimate class act,” he said, adding “We agreed it just didn't feel right to finish that game.”Lions quarterback Kyle Allen recalled that the severity was clear as soon as trainers rushed out with stretchers.“Usually, you see a couple trainers out there,” Allen said, as quoted in ESPN. “It's never good when they bring out the stretchers. We just started praying for him and hoping for the best. When it's taking that long, with that many people and that many trainers around him, you're just hoping for the best.” He added that nobody on the sideline wanted to continue.“I don't think anyone on that sideline wanted to play,” Allen said. “We weren't part of that decision, but you could just look in everyone's eyes and see it wasn't worth it.” Falcons wide receiver Casey Washington echoed the sentiment, saying, “That's somebody's life, and that's bigger than football.”The Lions said 24-year-old Morice Norris, who joined the team as an undrafted free agent from Fresno State in 2024, would stay in the hospital overnight for observation. Norris posted a reassuring Instagram story the next morning that read, “I'm all good man. Don't stress it. Appreciate all the check ins and love.” Head coach Campbell confirmed Norris’s mother, Francina Pleasant, was with him at the hospital.“It’s an eye‑opener. It hits a little different,” Campbell said. “It puts things in perspective. And I'll tell you what, man, it's a violent game and we love it. And when something like this happens, the silver lining is … the brotherhood. I mean, to see all those guys from that team, our team kind of come together and everybody's thinking about another player just means a lot.”What happened Friday night showed that, it wasn’t about winning or losing – it was about making sure a teammate was okay.",Detroit lions safety morice norris was taken off the field in an ambulance after a hard hit.

Phoenix Suns’ Perspective

Los Angeles Lakers’ Offseason Strategy

Why This Move Makes Sense Now

Thehave already made notable moves this offseason, but reports suggest they could still pursue further roster upgrades to bolster their chances in the competitive Western Conference. According to Dean Simon of Sporting News, adding another reliable two-way wing might be the next step, and Phoenix Suns forward Royce O’Neale could be the ideal target.For the Los Angeles Lakers to land O’Neale, the most realistic package would likely involve rookie forward Dalton Knecht and an expiring contract, such as Maxi Kleber’s $11 million deal. While Knecht was initially seen as a promising fit when the Lakers drafted him 17th overall in 2024, the relationship between him and the front office may have soured after an attempted trade during the past season.Royce O’Neale, 32, offers proven playoff experience, defensive versatility, and consistent three-point shooting - a combination that could perfectly complement both LeBron James and Luka Dončić . In the 2024-25 season with the Suns, he delivered career-best numbers in several categories.His ability to hit shots at a high volume from deep while guarding multiple positions makes him a valuable asset for any team aiming for a deep playoff run.The Phoenix Suns could view Knecht as a young scoring forward who fits their ongoing youth movement following the trade of Kevin Durant to the Houston Rockets earlier this summer. Knecht’s upside and offensive potential might appeal to a franchise looking to develop younger talent for the future.This offseason, the Los Angeles Lakers have already added Marcus Smart, the 2022 Defensive Player of the Year, and 2018 No. 1 overall pick Deandre Ayton on team-friendly contracts. While these moves strengthen both ends of the court, Dean Simon notes that “more work is left to be done if the Lakers want to compete with the Western Conference’s top-tier talent.”• Playoff-ready addition: Royce O’Neale brings eight years of NBA experience, including significant postseason minutes.• Perfect floor spacer: His 40.6% accuracy from three on nearly six attempts per game could open up the floor for James and Dončić.• Defensive boost: Capable of guarding wings and smaller forwards effectively.• Low-risk trade: Lakers part with an unproven rookie and an expiring contract for a veteran who fits their immediate championship window.Also read: Why the Los Angeles Lakers Could Move $51 Million Star Following Legendary Luka Doncic Contract Extension, Per NBA Analyst If Rob Pelinka opts to make the deal, the Los Angeles Lakers could significantly enhance their depth and versatility - two qualities that could prove decisive in a loaded Western Conference.","The los angeles lakers have already added marcus smart and deandre ayton.

Shedeur Sanders shines in NFL preseason debut with Browns, scores first touchdown



Shedeur Sanders: A debut with promise and room to grow



Shedeur Sanders wasted no time making his mark in the NFL . In his preseason debut on Friday night against the Carolina Panthers, the Cleveland Browns rookie quarterback delivered both poise and playmaking flair. Within the first quarter, Sanders not only moved the chains with his legs but also threw the first official touchdown pass of his professional career- a moment that sparked excitement among fans and drew an emotional reaction from his father, Deion Sanders.Shedeur Sanders’s big moment came late in the first quarter. After Browns linebacker Nathaniel Watson recovered a fumble deep in Panthers territory, Cleveland found themselves just 10 yards from the end zone. Two plays later, Sanders zipped a perfectly placed seven-yard strike to Kaden Davis, threading the football between two defenders for six points. The rookie had already flashed his versatility earlier, scrambling 10 yards on a third-and-9 to secure his first NFL first down.Interestingly, Sanders wasn’t even expected to start this game. Entering camp, he was listed last on the team’s initial depth chart, competing against Kenny Pickett, Joe Flacco, and Dillon Gabriel.But with Pickett and Gabriel sidelined by injuries, Sanders got the nod—and he seized the moment. His first touchdown came on his fourth drive, capitalizing after a muffed punt set up another red-zone chance.For Deion Sanders, this was a proud parent moment. Watching from afar rather than the sidelines, the Pro Football Hall of Famer celebrated online, posting, “Yes Lawd! Yes!” before the night was over. Before kickoff, Deion had expressed confidence in his son’s readiness, saying, “He’s gonna be a problem out there tonight.”The debut wasn’t flawless—Sanders missed an open target and felt the full brunt of NFL pass rush pressure for the first time—but it was undeniably encouraging. He showcased mobility, arm talent, and composure under the lights, converting key third downs both by running and throwing.With the Browns’ quarterback competition still wide open, Sanders’ performance on Friday has given coaches more to consider. If he continues to build on this momentum, the rookie could climb the depth chart faster than expected—and perhaps turn what began as a temporary opportunity into something far more permanent.Also Read: Tom Brady heaps praise on Patrick Mahomes’ career so far: ""Love watching him play”","Cleveland browns rookie quarterback shedeur sanders made his nfl debut on friday night.

Connor McDavid’s path to Wayne Gretzky’s points record: Can the Oilers captain make NHL history?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/connor-mcdavids-path-to-wayne-gretzkys-points-record-can-the-oilers-captain-make-nhl-history/articleshow/123187848.cms,"Wayne Gretzky's seemingly unbreakable NHL points record of 2,857 looms large as Connor McDavid chases history (Getty Images)

How realistic is it for Connor McDavid to catch Wayne Gretzky’s untouchable points record?

The more attainable milestone: Oilers’ all-time points leader

Wayne Gretzky’s career point total — 2,857 — has long been considered hockey’s most unbreakable record. Across 1,487 NHL regular-season games, “The Great One” scored 894 goals and recorded 1,963 assists, dominating an era when goal-scoring exploded. The 1980s saw Gretzky surpass the 200-point mark four times, with league scoring averages often exceeding 7.5 goals per game. In today’s NHL, where the average sits closer to 6.0, matching that level of production presents a far steeper challenge.Connor McDavid has been rewriting the modern offensive playbook. Through 712 games, the Edmonton Oilers captain has tallied 361 goals and 721 assists for 1,082 points — an astounding pace in the current low-scoring climate. At just 28 years old, McDavid has already topped 120 points in three of the last four seasons, showing no signs of slowing down.While McDavid’s production is elite, the numbers reveal the monumental scale of the task. Over his career, McDavid averages about 125 points per season. Gretzky’s pace? Around 158 per year — even after factoring in his final seasons during the so-called “dead puck era.”To pass Gretzky’s 2,857 points, McDavid would need another 1,775 points.At his current pace, that’s more than 14 additional seasons, or roughly 1,165 games, with no significant decline. This would require him to remain productive into his early 40s, in an Ovechkin-like career marathon. Realistically, the physical demands and inevitable drop in production make this almost impossible.While Gretzky’s all-time NHL mark may remain out of reach, McDavid is well within striking distance of another historic achievement — becoming Edmonton’s all-time franchise points leader. Gretzky’s Oilers record stands at 1,669 points, meaning McDavid needs just 587 more. At his current pace, he could surpass that within five seasons.Of course, one key factor remains — his contract.

Poll Do you think Gautam Gambhir's reaction to the pitch curator was justified? Yes, he was right to defend his team No, he should have handled it better

NEW DELHI: Former Australian batter Matthew Hayden has offered his verdict on India head coach Gautam Gambhir ’s fiery altercation with Oval pitch curator Lee Fortis ahead of the series-deciding fifth Test against England during Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy.The flashpoint occurred during India’s training session, when Gambhir was heard telling Fortis, “You don’t tell any of us what we need to do. You have no right to tell us, you’re just a groundsman, nothing more,” while pointing a finger at the chief curator. Batting coach Sitanshu Kotak quickly stepped in, pulling Fortis aside to cool tempers.Speaking on All Over Bar The Cricket after India’s 2-2 series draw, Hayden said the incident reflected a common dynamic in England.“This is a typical case in England. It is a bit of a flex — here we are, final Test match, this is my venue, and they are going to try and make it difficult on Gautam Gambhir. But I think he's got every right to tone it down. He could have used better language. But the reality is, his team is trying to train ahead of the most important Test match,” Hayden remarked.Former Australian all-rounder Greg Blewett backed Hayden’s assessment, recalling his own frustrations with pitch restrictions.“I agree. Even now, even as a commentator, you get near the pitch and everyone is saying you can't get anywhere near it and you're like I haven't got spikes on. It is quite ridiculous. I get the frustration. But I agree that the language that he used wasn't great. If he reflects, he could have probably handled it a little better,” Blewett said.Despite the controversy, India shifted focus back to cricket, pulling off a thrilling 6-run victory at the Oval to level the series — leaving the verbal clash as just another subplot in an epic series in England.","Former australian batter matthew hayden has offered his verdict on india head coach gautam gambhir ’s fiery altercation with oval pitch curator lee fortis.

Gautam Gambhir's fiery press conferences: Every time the India head coach lost his cool

Poll Should Kuldeep Yadav have been included in the playing XI during the recent series against England? Yes, he’s a valuable asset. No, the current strategy was justified.

Is Kuldeep completely a dud with the bat?

NEW DELHI: As an age-old adage goes in cricket, ""Batters win you games, but bowlers win you tournaments."" Sadly, Team India 's head coach Gautam Gambhir doesn't believe in this theory when it comes to Test cricket.Since he has taken over the role of head coach of Team India, results have been a mixed bag. In T20Is, India are world champions, and given the depth of talent with Jasprit Bumrah in it, they are going to dominate world cricket for a while. The future of one-day cricket is in a fix, but India under Gambhir did win the 2024 Champions Trophy, with two of the best in the format -- Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli -- backed by a four-pronged spin attack. In two years’ time, even without these two stalwarts, this Indian cricket team can win the next World Cup in South Africa and put that November 19 ghost behind them.Gambhir's predecessor, Rahul Dravid, has called the depth in India's white-ball talent ""scary,"" and he is right because it is a well-oiled system that will produce results.Arguably, the most challenging job for any coach and captain is Test cricket, the format which is probably the epitome of the sport. Test cricket tests the character of individuals, and you need strategy, and most importantly, you need bowlers who can take 20 wickets and win you matches.Twice India have come agonisingly close to winning the World Test Championship (WTC), only to finish second.Under Gautam Gambhir, India have played 15 Test matches, winning five and losing eight, including an embarrassing series defeat at home to New Zealand, their first in 12 years. His red-ball tactics have raised eyebrows; his rigidity in prioritising batting depth over balance, and his decision to keep Kuldeep Yadav on the bench, cost India a golden chance to bury the Bazballers once and for all. India did manage to draw the series, thanks to a spirited performance backed by the extraordinary skill of Mohammed Siraj , but they should have beaten toothless England.In the Delhi cricket circuit, there is a famous line about Gautam Gambhir: ""If he likes you, he will go beyond to make sure that you are in the playing XI, and if he doesn't, you won't be near the premises of the Arun Jaitley Stadium."" Gambhir has had his fair share of controversies since his playing days, and he is still abrasive as a coach. ""You are just a groundsman,"" he hurled towards Surrey groundsman Lee Fortis in an argument. It is Delhi's equivalent of slang like ""teri aukaat kya hai? (what is your status?)""Coming back to cricket, there were so many loopholes in Gambhir's strategy in the recently concluded Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy. On mostly flat England decks, wrist-spinner Kuldeep Yadav, who had floored England at home on similar pitches with 19 wickets in four Tests, was carrying drinks. The reason given was that the management wanted batting depth. There were three Indians in the top five leading run-getters of the series; Harry Brook managed to pip Rishabh Pant by two runs as the Indian wicketkeeper-batter missed the Oval Test due to injury.No, coach Gambhir, he isn’t. He is not flashy, but he knows how to put a price on his wicket. Remember his 131-ball vigil in Ranchi, where he scored 28 and forged a 76-run stand for the eighth wicket with Dhruv Jurel? India eventually won the match. In Dharamsala again, he scored a valuable 30. A few years ago, on a dicey Chattogram pitch, he faced 114 balls for his 40, and his all-round display earned him the Player of the Match award.Forget Kuldeep, what was the point of sending Akash Deep as night watchman at Lord's when you had an accomplished lower-order batter in Washington Sundar, fresh from his beautiful spell? India could have used Akash Deep's lusty blows when Ravindra Jadeja was trying hard to farm the strike in the fourth innings.Anshul Kamboj was called in as an injury replacement for Arshdeep Singh and was given a Test debut at Old Trafford, probably the flattest pitch of the series. He looked all at sea, and the reasoning was that they wanted him for the overcast conditions. The most suitable place for Anshul or even Arshdeep to bowl was on the spicy The Oval pitch, but they were carrying drinks.India's No. 3 has been reduced to a game of musical chairs. Sai Sudharsan played the first Test but was dropped at Edgbaston. Karun Nair, who was India's designated No. 6 at Headingley, got the opportunity and played the next two Tests, but was later dropped at Old Trafford. Coach Gambhir’s reasoning was that no one in his side is dropped, they are just looking for good balance. Karun did make a comeback at The Oval because Pant was out and India were looking to strengthen the batting, and Washington Sundar, who had scored a match-winning century at No. 6 in the fourth Test, was batting at No. 8.Yes, India did manage to steal a series draw against England, but they should have won it, and coach Gambhir needs to reflect on his philosophy going forward.","Gautam gambhir has had a mixed record as head coach of team india. India have played 15 test matches, winning five and losing eight. The team have come agonisingly close to winning the world test championship (wtc), only to finish second. India's no. 3 has been reduced to a game of musical chairs.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123198659,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-148282,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
