India women's cricketers get a grand welcome in their respective hometowns

Bengal's first World Cup-winning cricketer Richa Ghosh received multiple honors at Eden Gardens on Saturday. The ceremony brought together cricket legends Sourav Ganguly, Jhulan Goswami , and Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee.The 22-year-old wicketkeeper-batter from Siliguri received the Banga Bhushan award and was appointed Deputy Superintendent of Police. The West Bengal government also presented her with a gold chain.The Cricket Association of Bengal awarded her Rs 34 lakh, calculated at Rs 1 lakh for each run she scored in the final match.""The World Cup triumph is a special, special win and only Richa can tell us what that feels like. Your career has just begun. Women's cricket will grow massively in the next four to six years, and there will be more opportunities,"" Ganguly said.""I hope you make the most of them and one day, like Jhulan, we'll stand here and say: 'Richa -- India captain'. You're just 22... You've got time. All blessings and heartiest congratulations.""Richa's contribution to India's victory was significant. Batting at number 7, she scored 34 runs off 24 balls, including three fours and two sixes in the final against South Africa.India posted 298 for 7, while South Africa managed only 246 runs.""The role she plays batting lower down the order is very difficult. You get fewer balls but you have to score the most runs. People may remember Jemimah's 127 not out or Harmanpreet's 89 in the semifinals, but Richa's strike rate of 130-plus made the difference. What she's done so simply is equal in value to Smriti or Harman.""Jhulan Goswami, India's highest ODI wicket-taker, discovered Richa during Bengal's 2013 district trials in Siliguri.""In 2013, we were struggling so I suggested for trials in districts. During the under-15 trials in Siliguri, I spotted Richa. I requested the officials to support her. She was so talented at that age, I'd never seen that before. I wanted her to be in the senior team, and the rest is history. Finally, tor haath diye amader World Cup ta aslo — onek onek dhonnobad.""Richa expressed her gratitude and amazement at the reception she received.""It feels like a dream -- the way I was received in Siliguri and now here. It's like living a dream.""She shared insights about her training methods.""When I bat at open nets, I set a target — how many runs I can score in a specific time. That helps me in big matches. They always praise my sixes, so I try for more big hits. It's about choosing the right ball.""Richa discussed her approach to handling pressure.""I like to take pressure, but I keep myself calm by watching movies and staying away from home. Barite sob theke samne thakbe.""The Banga Bhushan and Banga Bibhushan awards are West Bengal's highest civilian honors. These awards recognize individuals who excel in various fields including art, culture, literature, public administration, and public service.The ceremony was attended by Sports Minister Aroop Biswas, actor-MP Mimi Chakraborty from North Bengal, and Richa's parents, Manabendra and Swapna Ghosh.Ganguly presented Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee with a replica of the 'Freedom Trophy' before the India-South Africa Test series opener at Eden Gardens on November 14.

Tom Brady says the quiet part out loud after FOX Sports swaps Mark Sanchez for Drew Brees,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/tom-brady-says-the-quiet-part-out-loud-after-fox-sports-swaps-mark-sanchez-for-drew-brees/articleshow/125185389.cms,"Tom Brady welcomes Drew Brees to FOX Sports after Mark Sanchez’s exit, highlighting accuracy, career production and a major shift in the network’s NFL booth.

Tom Brady reacts publicly to Drew Brees replacing Mark Sanchez at FOX Sports

Drew Brees steps into Mark Sanchez’s former role as Brady highlights the accuracy conversation





Tom Brady reacted to Drew Brees taking over Mark Sanchez’s spot at FOX Sports, and the response instantly pulled attention across the NFL . The move puts two of the most accurate quarterbacks in league history under the same network roof, and Brady made sure the focus keyword, Tom Brady, was in the first line as he set the tone with his usual dry-fire humor.Brees’ hiring comes as FOX Sports officially parted ways with Sanchez following his ongoing felony case. The network announced Brees’ arrival with a highlight reel, and Brady immediately jumped in with a punchy, public welcome. The two quarterbacks now headline a reshaped analyst lineup built on production, accuracy and career-long credibility.Tom Brady did not hold back when FOX Sports confirmed Drew Brees as the new analyst replacing Mark Sanchez. Brady shared FOX Sports’ announcement clip and attached a line that instantly made waves across social media. His message read:“And just like that I become the 3rd most accurate QB at @FOXSports (Terry still has both of us beat) Welcome to the family @drewbrees!!!”The accuracy comment was rooted in fact. Drew Brees retired with a 67.7% completion rate, which places him third all time behind Joe Burrow and Tua Tagovailoa. Brady’s reaction added a layer of self-awareness and competition that people rarely hear from him, and it worked because the numbers back all of it.Brees is stepping into a major role. FOX Sports expects him to call games with Adam Amin starting next week and remain on the team through at least 2026. He already has experience across NBC Sports, ESPN’s “First Take” and Netflix’s international game coverage. FOX Sports is betting on a quarterback who built his legacy on precision, control and film-room mastery.Mark Sanchez’s exit shifts the balance of FOX’s broadcast team. According to multiple outlets, FOX Sports cut ties as Sanchez faces a felony battery case in Indiana. He pleaded not guilty, and the legal process is ongoing. FOX Sports confirmed to The Athletic that he is no longer part of the broadcast crew. The decision opened the lane for Brees, and Brady’s reaction shows that the quarterback fraternity is already treating the move as a major shakeup.Brady and Brees owned their era, stacking numbers that still look unreal. Tom Brady started 333 games, threw for 89,214 yards, 649 touchdowns, and finished with a 251-82 record, putting him first all time in passing yards, passing touchdowns, completions, attempts, and starts. Drew Brees wasn’t far behind, going 172-114 with 80,358 yards and 571 touchdowns while completing nearly 68% of his throws. He ranks second in league history in completions, attempts, yards, and touchdowns, sitting right behind Brady in every major category.Drew Brees enters FOX Sports at a moment when the network needs stability, professionalism and credibility in the booth. He retired with 80,358 passing yards, 571 touchdowns and one of the most efficient careers the league has ever seen. The numbers place him behind Tom Brady in yardage and touchdowns but ahead of almost everyone in accuracy and consistency.Brees shared his own statement following the announcement. He said:“I appreciate the opportunity FOX has given me in the booth and with their team. I hope my passion for this game is reflected in the knowledge and insight I provide to fans each Sunday.”His arrival is rooted in a reputation built across two decades with the New Orleans Saints and the San Diego Chargers. Former teammate Darren Sproles described Brees’ leadership on “Up & Adams,” saying:“For him, to mention me out of all the weapons that he had. That is very special. With Drew, you didn’t have to think like that on the field. Drew always put you in the right place at the right time.”These details matter because FOX Sports is replacing a quarterback known for chaotic storylines with one known for structure and precision. Mark Sanchez’s legal issues removed him from the booth as he deals with felony battery and multiple misdemeanor charges after an incident in Indianapolis earlier this year. He had already been sidelined after being stabbed and arrested on the same night. He pleaded not guilty and awaits further proceedings.Drew Brees offers none of the uncertainty, and that is part of the reason FOX Sports moved quickly. He already worked on NBC’s Notre Dame broadcasts, contributed to Football Night in America, and appeared on “First Take” before signing with FOX Sports. His presence turns the broadcast team into a high-accuracy, high-football-IQ group, which pairs naturally with the tone Tom Brady wants to bring to television.Brady himself is walking into his own broadcast era. He will be in the booth this Sunday covering the Detroit Lions and Washington Commanders, while the New England Patriots and Tampa Bay Buccaneers face each other in one of the biggest matchups of the weekend. Brady refused to pick a side in the game, saying:“Just... don’t ask me to pick any sides here.”","Tom brady welcomes drew brees to fox sports after mark sanchez’s exit.

Brittany Mahomes’ new advisory board appointment adds a cultural shift moment to a growing NWSL era





More coverage on NFL:

The Kansas City Chiefs are in the middle of a painful reset week and not just because Patrick Mahomes is coming off a rare touchdown-less performance. Kansas City’s QB1 is regrouping, refocusing, and trying to recalibrate an offense that suddenly looks uneven.But while conversations around the Chiefs have been dominated by red-zone issues, missed opportunities, and Mahomes admitting “I got to be better,” there’s another Mahomes headline hitting at the exact same time, one that has nothing to do with football mechanics. Brittany Mahomes isn’t just the loudest supporter inside the CPKC suites anymore. She’s officially stepping into the boardroom of women’s sports and Patrick had no words.

Golden State Warriors’ Struggles Without Curry

Other Key Injuries and Warriors vs Pacers Game Details (November 9, 2025)

Why This Game Matters for Both Teams

fans are holding their breath ahead of tonight’s matchup against the Indiana Pacers, as franchise cornerstonedue to illness. The two-time MVP has missed the last two contests, both of which ended in losses for the Warriors. With the team now sitting at an even 5-5 record, his return could be a crucial turning point early in the 2025-26 NBA season.The Golden State Warriors’ recent struggles without Curry have been evident. Their offensive rhythm has faltered, defensive consistency has waned, and morale has dipped. As the team prepares for a tough stretch of games, a healthy Curry back in the lineup could provide the spark they desperately need. Head coach Steve Kerr has remained cautiously optimistic, hinting that the final decision on Curry’s participation will be made closer to tip-off.Stephen Curry’s illness appeared suddenly, forcing him to sit out consecutive games against the Sacramento Kings and Denver Nuggets. Reports suggest his symptoms worsened before those matchups, leading the Warriors’ medical staff to prioritize his full recovery over a rushed return.Although specific details about the illness haven’t been disclosed, it was severe enough to affect his conditioning and overall readiness.Coach Kerr has reiterated that the team will not take unnecessary risks with their superstar’s health. Should Curry return tonight, his playing time is expected to be limited as part of a gradual reintegration plan. The Golden State Warriors aim to ensure that their leader is fully recovered before ramping up his minutes, especially with a challenging road trip looming.Without their star point guard, Golden State’s offense has lacked fluidity. The team has committed more turnovers, suffered from poor spacing, and failed to capitalize on open looks. These offensive woes, combined with defensive lapses, have resulted in back-to-back defeats that turned a strong 4-1 start into a .500 record.Veteran forward Draymond Green has publicly addressed the team’s struggles, citing both defensive breakdowns and lack of composure during key moments. Jimmy Butler, now serving as the Warriors’ secondary scorer, has shouldered a heavier offensive load but has struggled to compensate for Curry’s elite shooting and playmaking.Stephen Curry isn’t the only concern for the Golden State Warriors heading into the Pacers matchup. Veteran center Al Horford is also questionable with a left foot strain. Horford missed the previous game and has been inconsistent since joining the team this offseason, shooting below 30 percent from the field while battling recurring foot discomfort.Tonight’s game against the Indiana Pacers tips off at 8:30 PM Eastern (5:30 PM Pacific) at the Chase Center in San Francisco. Fans can watch the live broadcast on Amazon Prime Video, NBA League Pass, and Fubo TV.This contest holds added significance beyond Curry’s potential return. The Golden State Warriors lost to Indiana earlier in the season and are eager for redemption on home court. A win tonight could not only help stabilize their record but also restore confidence across the roster. With both Curry and Horford’s availability still uncertain, all eyes will be on the pregame updates to see if the Warriors’ leader finally makes his long-awaited return.Also read: Golden State Warriors vs Indiana Pacers regular season game: Full Injury report, who’s out, and more (November 9, 2025) If Stephen Curry suits up, even in limited minutes, his presence alone could rejuvenate a struggling Warriors squad desperate to regain its championship rhythm.","Stephen curry remains listed as questionable for tonight's game against the indiana pacers.

Swifties decode Joe Alwyn’s clover dish photo — claiming it was a quiet nod to Taylor Swift as she prepares for her wedding with Travis Kelce,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/swifties-decode-joe-alwyns-clover-dish-photo-claiming-it-was-a-quiet-nod-to-taylor-swift-as-she-prepares-for-her-wedding-with-travis-kelce/articleshow/125158940.cms,"Swifties believe Joe Alwyn’s Instagram photo featuring a heart-shaped dish with a four-leaf clover was a subtle show of support for Taylor Swift’s $360 million masters buyback deal. Fans linked the clover to Shamrock Capital, interpreting the image as a quiet nod to Swift’s victory, even though Alwyn never addressed it publicly.

Taylor Swift fans once believed Joe’s clover photo was an indirect nod to the buyback and Shamrock Capital

More coverage on NFL:

Back in early 2025, before Taylor Swift’s $360 million masters buyback became one of the most celebrated business wins in modern pop music history, fans were already looking for clues, at times in places even the artist’s closest circle never acknowledged. One of those viral rabbit holes traced back to Joe Alwyn.Months before Taylor Swift’s ownership announcement shook the industry, Alwyn shared an Instagram carousel that most people swiped right through, until Swifties saw the fifth slide. A heart-shaped porcelain dish stamped with a four-leaf clover became suddenly more than décor. In hindsight, Swift fans believed it was a quiet thumbs-up and now that speculation has resurfaced again.The original theory sparked because the clover, to Swift’s online detectives, aligned too easily with the Shamrock Capital narrative, the firm Swift bought her music back from. In fan logic, it wasn’t just springtime imagery or St. Patrick’s Day aesthetics. It was support. It was a symbol. And it was emotional closure for a relationship that ran parallel to Swift’s fight for control over her catalogue.Joe Alwyn didn’t say a word publicly about Swift’s historic business win.He didn’t post a caption about empowerment, ownership, or old battles finally ending. But Page Six amplified the fan narrative anyway, noting that Swifties genuinely believed “He’s happy for her.”Now, months later, this theory is trending again, not because anything new has happened, but because Swift’s masters deal is being revisited as a major turning point in celebrity-led IP ownership. And when pop culture cycles back, so do the symbols fans once obsessed over.It’s proof of how deeply Swift fans archive and how long they hold onto meaning. Even when the moment has passed. Old theories eventually become nostalgia. And in this case, the clover moment is now less about Joe and more about how Swift fans refuse to forget their favorite breadcrumbs.","Taylor swift fans once believed joe alwyn’s clover photo was an indirect nod to the buyback and shamrock capital.

Lenny Wilkens’ brilliance defined eras of NBA greatness



Lenny Wilkens’ legacy beyond wins and titles



The basketball world is mourning the loss of Lenny Wilkens, a trailblazing figure who shaped generations of the sport both on and off the court. The Hall of Famer, remembered for his graceful playmaking and calm authority as a coach, passed away Sunday at the age of 88. Wilkens, a nine-time NBA All-Star and one of the few individuals enshrined in the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame as both player and coach, leaves behind a career that spanned over four decades of influence.A Brooklyn native who rose from humble beginnings, Wilkens’ journey from Providence College standout to NBA champion coach remains one of basketball’s most inspiring success stories. His 1,332 career wins rank third all-time, trailing only Gregg Popovich and Don Nelson, while his 2,487 games coached remain an NBA record. From the court to the sideline, Wilkens carried himself with quiet confidence, earning respect for his intelligence, poise, and unwavering integrity.Lenny Wilkens’ basketball career was remarkable in both scope and substance. Drafted sixth overall by the St. Louis Hawks in 1960, he quickly proved himself a cerebral point guard, leading the league in assists twice and earning nine All-Star nods during his 15-year career.Standing just over six feet tall, Wilkens never relied on athletic flash — instead, his mastery of timing, positioning, and teamwork made him one of the smartest floor generals of his time.His playing days transitioned seamlessly into coaching. Wilkens became a rare player-coach with the Seattle SuperSonics and later the Portland Trail Blazers, before fully committing to coaching. He famously guided the SuperSonics to their first and only NBA championship in 1979. It was a triumph that immortalized him in Seattle sports history. “I know what young players are going through,” Wilkens once said. “I understand their backgrounds. I didn’t come from anything either, so I’ve been there.”While Wilkens’ basketball résumé is unmatched, his influence extended well beyond the game. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver called him “one of the game’s most respected ambassadors,” noting that “Lenny Wilkens represented the very best of the NBA — as a Hall of Fame player, Hall of Fame coach, and one of the game's most respected ambassadors.”He was not only a two-time Olympic gold medalist — as an assistant on the 1992 Dream Team and head coach of the 1996 U.S. men’s squad — but also a pillar of his community. His Lenny Wilkens Foundation raised millions for youth programs and health initiatives in Seattle, the city where a statue now stands in his honor.Wilkens’ passing marks the end of an era, but his spirit endures in the countless players, coaches, and fans he inspired. As Steve Kerr, who played under him in Cleveland, recalled, “What I remember most is just the dignity. He was such a dignified human being and a great leader through quiet confidence.” Lenny Wilkens elevated everyone around him.Also Read: Late NBA legend Kobe Bryant's wife Vanessa Bryant shares heartfelt two-word message honoring daughter Natalia Bryant","Lenny wilkens was a nine-time nba all-star and two-time olympic gold medalist.

Suryakumar Yadav and Abhishek Sharma press conference: On touching a trophy, Women's World Cup, more

NEW DELHI: India’s final T20I against Australia at The Gabba in Brisbane ended without a result as persistent rain and lightning forced the match to be abandoned on Saturday. Before the weather intervened, India had raced to 52 for no loss in just 4.5 overs, sealing the five-match series 2-1.This result gave India their fifth consecutive T20I series win over Australia, underlining their continued dominance in the shortest format. Openers Abhishek Sharma (23 not out) and Shubman Gill (29 not out) provided a brisk start, treating the crowd to some delightful strokeplay before the skies opened up and forced the players off the field.Abhishek, who became the second fastest Indian to reach 1000 T20I runs, was given two early lives in the powerplay — first when Glenn Maxwell dropped him at long-off off Ben Dwarshuis, and then when Dwarshuis himself put down a chance at the boundary off Nathan Ellis. Making the most of those reprieves, the left-hander struck two elegant boundaries and looked set for a big score before rain had the final say. Gill, meanwhile, looked in sublime touch, timing his shots beautifully and hitting six boundaries.Once play was called off, India were declared series winners, having earlier registered victories in Hobart and the Gold Coast after losing the opening match in Melbourne.After the match, Abhishek Sharma and captain Suryakumar Yadav addressed the media.During the press conference, a reporter asked Abhishek about his partnership with Shubman Gill, which has often been described as an “Ice and Fire” combination.Abhishek smiled and responded, “I’d actually say we’re more like fire and fire. The way Shubman was batting today. We’ve been playing together since the Under 12 days, so there’s a deep understanding between us. I usually know what shot he’s about to play, and he understands which bowler I’m planning to target. Sometimes he helps me with shot selection, and I do the same for him — that chemistry is something we really enjoy on the field. ”His words perfectly summed up the bond between two of India’s brightest young batters — a partnership built on years of friendship, trust, and shared firepower at the top.","India’s final t20i against australia at the gabba in brisbane ended without a result as persistent rain and lightning forced the match to be abandoned.

“Play with me”: Shohei Ohtani's heartfelt words to Miguel Rojas after game-changing World Series home run win hearts online,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/mlb/news/play-with-me-shohei-ohtanis-heartfelt-words-to-miguel-rojas-after-game-changing-world-series-home-run-win-hearts-online/articleshow/125148678.cms,"Shohei Ohtani (Image via: Gary A. Vasquez-Imagn Images)

Shohei Ohtani’s message shows his bond with teammates runs deeper than the game

Miguel Rojas wasn’t supposed to be the headline hero of the World Series — but baseball loves surprises. When the veteran infielder crushed a game-changing home run in the Fall Classic, he gave the Los Angeles Dodgers more than just a lead — he gave them momentum. The 36-year-old, who’s built his career on grit and defense, found himself at the center of one of the most emotional moments of the Dodgers’ championship run. And what followed in the dugout turned that swing into something unforgettable.Rojas later shared that as he returned to the bench, he was greeted by none other than Shohei Ohtani — the two-way superstar who has transformed the Dodgers’ clubhouse with both talent and heart. Speaking to MLB broadcaster Chris Rose, Rojas revealed how Ohtani walked up to him, smiling, and said something that instantly became a story fans can’t stop talking about. “I think one of the coolest things that happened in my life so far. ... I’m by the bat rack like laying my helmet, and Shohei came to me and say ‘Miggy, you can’t retire next year. You’re playing with me for 10 more years,’” Rojas recalled, laughing as he relived the moment.It was just one line, but it spoke volumes. Rojas, who has often hinted at nearing the end of his playing career, replied with humor and heart: “Shohei, I’m old, and I don’t know if I can play for 10 more years, but I’ll play with you next year for sure.”That lighthearted exchange summed up everything fans love about this Dodgers team — a blend of experience, youth, and unshakable camaraderie. Ohtani, known for his calm presence and relentless work ethic, has not only redefined the game with his two-way brilliance but also transformed the dugout energy. His bond with veterans like Rojas proves that leadership isn’t just about home runs or strikeouts — it’s about lifting the people around you.Moments like these remind fans why the Dodgers continue to feel more like a family than a franchise. Behind the fireworks and the trophies lies a team built on mutual respect and shared joy. When Shohei Ohtani told Rojas, “Play with me,” it wasn’t just a joke — it was a glimpse into the heart of a champion.For Rojas, that simple gesture from one of baseball’s biggest stars turned a personal milestone into something bigger — a moment of connection that defined the Dodgers’ back-to-back World Series triumphs. And for fans, it’s a reminder that the best stories in baseball don’t just happen on the field — they’re written in the dugout, one heartfelt word at a time.

Sidney Crosby’s frustration grows as Penguins’ offense sputters



More NHL coverage

The Pittsburgh Penguins fell 2-1 in a shootout to the New Jersey Devils in a tense divisional battle on Saturday night, and captain Sidney Crosby’s emotions afterward said it all. Despite a strong outing in net by Arturs Silovs, the Penguins’ offense couldn’t capitalize on their opportunities, leaving Crosby visibly frustrated by the team’s inability to find the back of the net. It wasn’t a lack of effort—it was about execution, and the Penguins captain made that clear.“We can’t accept just getting one [goal], but sometimes the game’s going to dictate that. Sometimes it’s not going to go your way, [but] we’ve just got to continue to play the right way. I thought we did that,” Crosby said following the defeat. “We didn’t try to cheat for offense. We had some good looks, [but] unfortunately they didn’t go in.”The Penguins dictated much of the game’s tempo, especially through the first two periods, outshooting and out-chancing the Devils. Arturs Silovs was solid in goal, making 23 saves and keeping the Penguins within striking distance. Ryan Graves provided the lone tally for Pittsburgh, but the lack of finish around the net proved costly against a sharp Jake Allen, who turned away several high-quality chances.Saturday’s result was more than just another loss—it was a missed opportunity. With first place in the Metropolitan Division on the line, the Penguins now sit just one point behind the Devils. The performance was strong, but the inability to convert when it mattered most highlighted an ongoing concern for a team looking to establish consistency.The frustration is understandable, especially for Crosby, who continues to lead by example in his 19th NHL season. Earlier in the year, he was at the center of trade rumors linking him to the Montreal Canadiens, but his focus remains fixed on one goal—winning another Stanley Cup with Pittsburgh. Under new head coach Dan Muse, who took over after Mike Sullivan’s departure, the Penguins have found renewed energy and structure.Whether they can maintain that edge deep into the season remains to be seen. For now, the message from Crosby is simple: effort alone isn’t enough. The Penguins must turn strong play into tangible results if they want to stay on top of one of hockey’s toughest divisions.","Pittsburgh penguins fell 2-1 in a shootout to the new jersey devils on saturday night.

Sixers Face Tough Challenge Against Red-Hot Pistons

will not play tonight against the Detroit Pistons as theopt to rest their star center for the second leg of a back-to-back. The decision aligns with the team’s load management strategy, ensuring Embiid’s knee remains healthy throughout the long NBA season. After delivering a season-high 29 points and six rebounds in just 26 minutes during Saturday’s win over the Toronto Raptors, the reigning MVP will take a night off to recover.The 76ers have made Embiid’s health a top priority, particularly given his history of knee injuries. The team continues to monitor his workload closely, avoiding back-to-back appearances as a precautionary measure. This approach reflects a commitment to long-term success over short-term results as Philadelphia looks to remain competitive deep into the season.The official injury report for November 9, 2025, confirms that Joel Embiid is OUT against Detroit. Philadelphia will also be without Paul George, who is still recovering from knee surgery, and Dominick Barlow, sidelined with an elbow injury. Rookie Johni Broome remains out with an ankle sprain, leaving the Sixers short-handed once again. On a positive note, Jared McCain is available after missing Saturday’s game and is expected to play a larger role tonight.The team’s depth will be put to the test, as the Pistons come into the matchup leading the Eastern Conference standings. Philadelphia will look to Tyrese Maxey to lead the offense and fill the void left by Embiid’s absence. Maxey’s scoring ability and leadership will be crucial as the Sixers attempt to contain Detroit’s dynamic backcourt and high-paced offense.Joel Embiid’s absence is not the result of a setback but rather a calculated move to preserve his long-term fitness. The Sixers have implemented a strict policy preventing Embiid from playing on consecutive nights, especially early in the 2025-26 season. His history of knee issues has prompted the team’s medical staff to emphasize rest and recovery, ensuring he stays dominant throughout the campaign and into the playoffs.Despite his limited minutes, Embiid remains a cornerstone for Philadelphia, showcasing elite performances whenever he’s on the floor. His 29-point showing against Toronto reaffirmed his impact, proving that the load management strategy is paying off.The Detroit Pistons, led by Cade Cunningham, have emerged as one of the top teams in the East with a 7-2 record. Philadelphia’s 130-120 win over the Raptors on Saturday showcased their resilience, but tonight’s matchup will test their depth without their star big man.

A Battle of Momentum at Fiserv Forum

Thereceived a huge boost ahead of their NBA Cup matchup against the Chicago Bulls on November 7, 2025, as superstar. This update comes as a relief for Bucks fans who were concerned after the Greek Freak dealt with left knee soreness in recent days. With his name officially removed from the injury list, Giannis is set to lead Milwaukee in a must-win clash against a red-hot Bulls team that currently sits atop the Eastern Conference with a 6-1 record.This game is shaping up to be one of the standout fixtures of the NBA Cup group stage, featuring two franchises with contrasting trajectories. The Bucks are looking to regain momentum after a recent loss to the Toronto Raptors, while the Bulls have been one of the league’s early-season surprises, combining solid defense with balanced scoring. Having Giannis back on the floor gives Milwaukee the competitive edge they need to keep pace with their conference rivals.Giannis Antetokounmpo has been nothing short of dominant this season, averaging 32.3 points, 12.6 rebounds, and 6.3 assists per game. His performance continues to solidify his reputation as one of the most impactful players in the NBA. The Milwaukee Bucks will rely heavily on his leadership and all-around game, especially considering their current injury situation.Despite the good news surrounding Giannis, the Bucks will be missing other key contributors. Kevin Porter Jr. is out after undergoing surgery on his right knee, and Taurean Prince remains sidelined with a neck strain. These absences could shorten Milwaukee’s rotation, making Giannis Antetokounmpo’s presence even more vital to the team’s success.The Chicago Bulls enter the matchup in excellent form but are also dealing with health setbacks. Star guard Coby White has been ruled out, while Ayo Dosunmu’s availability remains uncertain. Even so, the Bulls’ depth has shined this season, with standout performances from Josh Giddey and Nikola Vucevic helping Chicago maintain its strong early record. The Bulls’ combination of youth and experience has created a winning formula, but missing White could test their offensive rhythm against a resilient Bucks squad.Tonight’s showdown promises intensity, as both teams aim to solidify their positions in the NBA Cup standings. The Milwaukee Bucks, led by a determined Giannis Antetokounmpo, will look to bounce back on their home court at the Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

Cam Thomas’ sudden setback forced the Brooklyn Nets to rethink its strategies in a early-season twist

Due to an injury to the same problematic left hamstring that destroyed the previous season, Cam Thomas, the Brooklyn Nets ' top scorer was forced to miss Wednesday night's 112-103 victory over the Indiana Pacers. With 6:46 remaining in the first quarter against the Pacers, Thomas missed a 15-foot stepback jumper, seemingly hurting himself on the landing.Cam Thomas was later classified as OUT by the team prior to tonight's game against the Detroit Pistons. He was sidelined indefinitely as a result of the setback, in addition to being out for the rest of the match. The great shooting guard may face future difficulties after re-injuring the same hamstring that prevented him from playing in 59 games the previous season.Cam Thomas, who recently sustained a hamstring injury, will be missing from Brooklyn. Even though he will be missed, this might be the ideal chance for the rookies. Thomas had a great start to the season prior to the injury , averaging 21.4 points on 40.2% field goal and 35.6% three-point shooting.However, in his eight starts, he has only contributed 2.6 assists per game, which is indicative of his ongoing scoring-first role.Even so, Thomas has been making every effort to enjoy playing basketball some more.Thomas may miss Friday's game against the Detroit Pistons , and the team will reevaluate him on Thursday, according to head coach Jordi Fernandez. Although it's regrettable that Brooklyn's 23-year-old star might not be playing, this presents a chance that the team should take advantage of right away.His absence comes at the worst possible moment for the Nets. With Drake Powell and Ben Saraf out for tonight's game, the squad has already suffered several blows to its depth. Brooklyn still lacks a starting point guard who can reliably move the ball within the offence without Thomas.The Brooklyn Nets now have a number in the victory column that is greater than zero. On Wednesday night, the Nets defeated the Indiana Pacers 112-103 to secure their first victory of the season away from home.For a team that had its worst start in ten years, it was a breath of relief.

How Connor McDavid's wife Lauren Kyle’s bold interior design identity is redefining what an NHL power couple looks like,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/how-connor-mcdavids-wife-lauren-kyles-bold-interior-design-identity-is-redefining-what-an-nhl-power-couple-looks-like/articleshow/125149911.cms,"Lauren Kyle, fiancée of NHL star Connor McDavid, is redefining the role of athletes' partners. She's built a powerful personal brand centered on sophisticated home design, proving WAGs can be influential entrepreneurs. Kyle's approach challenges traditional NHL masculinity, pushing the league towards a more modern, visually driven era and establishing herself as a significant market voice.

Lauren Kyle’s brand narrative reflects the shift toward design-led, CEO-style WAGs rather than just “player wives”





More coverage on NHL:

There was a time when the partners of pro athletes were barely seen, rarely quoted, and almost never included in the marketing conversation, especially in the NHL, which historically hosts one of the most “closed doors, keep it all quiet” cultures in North American sports. But Lauren Kyle, the fiancée of Edmonton Oilers superstar Connor McDavid , doesn’t exist in that old template.She’s not an accessory. She is the architect of a personal brand that leans into design, refinement, and highly curated home aesthetics. The conversations around her work have been loud, polarizing, and surprisingly influential. And now, she’s becoming a case study in how WAG entrepreneurship can shape cultural direction, not just add gloss to a player’s fame.Lauren Kyle’s rise isn’t simply about the “white and metallic house” moment that went viral. It’s the fact that she doubled down, she didn’t run from the discourse. She recast the reaction as proof that her vision evokes emotion. And in a luxury economy, emotion sells.Modern NHL fans tend to assume hockey culture = traditional masculinity + limited visual references. But Kyle is pushing an entirely different energy, magazine spreads, reflective surfaces, lifestyle-forward execution, and design-first storytelling.And that is exactly why her entrepreneurial trajectory matters. She isn’t evolving alongside the NHL brand, she’s dragging parts of the league into a more visually modern era with her.And it also reframes McDavid’s public image: not just athlete, but cultural architecture subject. Today, when people say things like “Lauren Kyle has an aesthetic,” that’s not gossip, that’s branding evidence. It means she has moved from a partner role to a market voice.Her message isn’t subtle: hockey wives aren’t background props anymore. Lauren Kyle is shaping the stage itself and the NHL has never seen a design-forward power couple quite like this.","Lauren kyle, fiancée of nhl star connor mcdavid, is redefining the role of athletes' partners.

How the Buffalo Sabres will adjust Without their Captain on the Ice



The Buffalo Sabres are getting ready to go without their captain and mainstay on defense, Rasmus Dahlin, who has left the team for an unspecified period for personal reasons. The team made the announcement on Friday that Dahlin will be away while he returns home to Sweden to be with his fiancée, Carolina Matovac. The 25-year-old defenseman has been a consistent contributor to Buffalo's defense this season, with nine points in 14 games, but now the focus understandably shifts from hockey to family.Dahlin's choice coincides with a very personal and emotional story in his life. Matovac, suffering from sudden heart failure in summer, needed emergency CPR, life support, and finally a heart transplant. She has been recuperating in Sweden while Dahlin has been in North America to start the NHL season. The Athletic's Matthew Fairburn reports that Sabres coach Lindy Ruff has revealed that Matovac's condition is stable and the whole team is behind Dahlin's move. Ruff added, ""I don’t think you can describe it. I don’t think you can feel what he’s feeling. I’m very passionate about the fact that no one would want to walk in his shoes and have dealt with what he dealt with. He has the support of everybody on this.""With Dahlin gone, Buffalo will have to make adjustments both in terms of playing style and atmosphere in the locker room. His absence as captain and one of the best defensemen in the NHL creates a huge gap in both leadership and playmaking.It is anticipated that defensemen Owen Power and Mattias Samuelsson will take the extra defensive workload during Dahlin's leave of absence, as the Sabres will try to remain competitive. Ruff might also depend to a greater extent on inexperienced defensemen in the areas of keeping the puck and changing the play, which will be a challenge that can uncover maturity and depth in Buffalo’s young core that is already going through an emotional period.The Sabres are now looking at the picture beyond just victories and defeats. The number one thing on their list is to continue taking care of Dahlin and his family till the latter is able to come back — something that even in top-level sports, there are instances that are more than just the match.More coverage on NHL","Rasmus dahlin will be away while he returns home to sweden to be with his fiancée, carolina matovac.
