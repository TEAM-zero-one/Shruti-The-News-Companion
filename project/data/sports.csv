Royal Challengers Bengaluru win IPL 2025 final



Why Sanskrit phrase still shines on the IPL trophy



Why IPL winners don‚Äôt keep the original cup







Since its inception in 2008, the Indian Premier League (IPL) has evolved into more than just a cricket tournament; it embodies the intersection of talent, ambition, and opportunity. Amidst the glitz, cheering crowds, and nail-biting matches, one subtle detail often escapes notice: the Sanskrit inscription etched onto the IPL trophy. The line written in Sanskrit quietly encapsulates the very spirit of the league, reflecting its mission to provide a grand stage for emerging players to shine and transform their lives through the power of performance.In 2025, the Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) ended their long drought and won their inaugural IPL title, becoming the 8th title-winning team after 18 long years. However, as the camera panned over the trophy during the celebrations, fans might have caught sight of an etched line in Roman script (English letters) that stood out from the rest in terms of its age in comparison with glitz around it.The line states:Though the trophy has undergone transformations over the years, this Sanskrit phrase has been consistent subtly affirming values IPL believes in.The phrase translates to:This line isn't merely ornamented‚Äîit's philosophical and deliberate.It captures the spirit of what IPL seeks to do: providing untapped talent the opportunity to shine on the biggest platform.As per a top IPL official:Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) won their first-ever IPL title by beating Punjab Kings (PBKS) by 6 runs in the 2025 final at Ahmedabad's Narendra Modi Stadium. In a battle between two teams that had never won the IPL, it was Rajat Patidar's RCB that kept their cool to defend a target of 191 on a demanding pitch.The win also saw a long-awaited victory for Virat Kohli, whose unwavering quest for the IPL title had finally been realised. Earlier in the season, RCB had become the first team in IPL history to win all away games in a season. They had placed second in the league standings behind Punjab but then defeated PBKS twice during the playoffs - once in the qualifier and again in the final - to secure a historic title push.Sanskrit, as an ancient language, has timeless wisdom. Inscribing a line of Sanskrit on the IPL trophy was a symbolic gesture by the organisers‚Äîpaying homage to India's cultural heritage while commemorating an event followed by the world.Inscribing it in Roman script rather than Devanagari makes it readable by an international audience, yet maintaining its Indian essence.""It proves that tradition and modernity exist together. That the principles of ancient India are still relevant even in a flashy, commercialised league like the IPL,"" opined a sports culture historian.The IPL is a live party to ""Yatra Pratibha Avsara Prapnotihi."" Hundreds of cricketers have climbed from anonymity to fame due to their performances in the tournament.Surprisingly, the original IPL trophy is not kept by the winning team. After the last match, it was returned to the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI). The champions do receive a replica to put on display, but the actual trophy stays with the BCCI as an ongoing honour. Also, the same trophy is used every year‚Äîwith the name of the new champion inscribed after each season. Only when space gets exhausted on the current one is a new trophy commissioned.","Rcb‚Äôs ipl win in 2025 brings focus back to trophy's sanskrit phrase.

Is UNC ‚Äúconcerned‚Äù about Bill Belichick‚Äôs girlfriend, Jordon Hudson?



Fans question why Bill Belichick‚Äôs girlfriend, Jordon Hudson, was on the field







Bill Belichick and his girlfriend Jordon Hudson have received a lot of hate due to their age gap of around forty eight years. But things quickly got worse when, in April, Jordon Hudson shut down a question about how they met when CBS‚Äô Tony Dokoupil asked about it to Bill Belichick during an interview. Fans labelled her as ‚Äúcontrolling‚Äù and ‚Äútoxic‚Äù even when Bill Belichick stood by his 24 year old girlfriend. But it seems like things are far from over, as it seems like there are some important personnel who are ‚Äúdeeply concerned‚Äù about Jordon Hudson‚Äôs presence.Recently, journalist Pablo Torre appeared on Bill Simmons‚Äô podcast and said, ""What if I told you that [Belichick's] inner circle of actual coaches on staff, including a certain Mike Lombardi, is deeply concerned about Jordon Hudson and her presence in the building?""This is not the first time there have been reports that the University of North Carolina has been dragged into Bill Belichick and Jordon Hudson‚Äôs drama. Many fans have accused 24-year-old Jordon Hudson of ‚Äúcrossing the line‚Äù and getting involved with Bill Belichick‚Äôs work when she should not have.However, Bill Belichick has strongly defended his girlfriend amid all the drama and has been a huge source of support for her.Recently, the New England Patriots‚Äô legend appeared on NFL legend, Michael Strahan‚Äôs popular ABC special, Good Morning America, where Bill Belichick spoke what Jordon Hudson actually does.Bill Belichick said, ""She does the business things that don't relate to North Carolina that come up in my life so I can concentrate on football.

Cam Skattebo's viral moment provokes criticism over NFL history blind spot



Does Cam Skattebo know ball? üß†

A generation gap or something more?

New York Giants first-year running back Cameron Skattebo became the focus of an unintended NFL tempest‚Äînothing on the field, but for seemingly not knowing anything about the league's greatest legends. In one recent video making its rounds on the internet, Cameron Skattebo can't recognize NFL legends from their pictures, kicking off an emotional Reddit discussion in which fans toggle between anger and empathy.Cameron Skattebo, who played college football at Sacramento State Hornets and Arizona State Sun Devils before the New York Giants drafted him in the fourth round of the 2025 NFL Draft, soon found himself a topic of conversation on Reddit‚Äîbut not the kind related to his athleticism.In one clip of him now circulating, Cameron Skattebo misidentifies players during a quiz segment. When presented with a picture of Calvin Johnson, better known as ‚ÄòMegatron,‚Äô confusion set in.Redditors were both amused and frustrated. One of the top comments stated, ‚ÄúNot knowing Calvin is wild, but an NFL player not knowing Brett Favre is crazy ffs.‚ÄùAnother commenter joked, ‚ÄúBanish him from the league for this,‚Äù and others reluctantly empathized, one of them noting, ‚ÄúTo be fair, though, Calvin retired when Skattebo woulda been like 13 or 14, and he wasn‚Äôt a guy who was in many commercials or broadcast booths.So it‚Äôs not thaaaat crazy with all that in mind.‚Äù""They‚Äôre so disappointed they‚Äôre almost speechless by the end lol. The joy fully sucked out of the room,"" another user said.""Well we didn‚Äôt teach him memory skills at ASU I guess,"" a fan joked.""Tbf I haven‚Äôt seen most of these guys without a helmet on,"" another defended, ""I got Colston and Megatron though.""""This dude off my draft board,"" one Reddit user said to which another replied, ""I imagine Cam needs to watch it again too. Dude looked like he got concussed 4 times during it.""A fan tried to defend Skattebo's 'ignorance' by commenting: ""Calm down guys, memory is hard. I can't even remember the last time the Buffalo Bills won a superbowl.""The discussion soon escalated beyond Cameron Skattebo, with wider questions about how younger players identify with the history of the league. One commenter wrote that most players don't grow up watching the NFL but rather center on their own development or college careers. ‚ÄúA lot of these guys don't even follow the NFL til they get to the league. Might have been a college fan, or just doesn't watch football,‚Äù another Redditor wrote.Even fans conceded trouble identifying helmet-wearing players by face alone. ‚ÄúNot really. I wouldn‚Äôt recognize Joe Montana from face alone probably. I definitely wouldn‚Äôt recognize megatron from face alone. I think people here are forgetting these dudes play in helmets lol. Outside of a handful of players there‚Äôs probably not many non-Eagles I could recognize,‚Äù admitted one commenter.""I mean, not knowing Golden Tate, Kam Chancellor, and Darren Sprolesis honestly understandable,"" one more added.Nevertheless, the overall opinion was tilted towards incredulity, particularly in light of Johnson's place in NFL legend.While the NFL fan base in turn roasted and justified Cameron Skattebo's viral blunder, the moment highlighted something greater‚Äîthe transience of fame, the changing tides of fandom across generations, and the way legacy players disappear from popular consciousness sooner than we want them to. Skattebo learned this lesson not offered in college: understanding the past can inform how you're perceived in the present.Also Read : Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce delight fans with synchronized dance at Tennessee wedding",New york giants first-year running back cameron skattebo can't recognize nfl legends from pictures.

Raiders risked it all for Patrick Mahomes? Insider bombshell rattles AFC West





For years, the Las Vegas Raiders have lived a recurring nightmare: Patrick Mahomes. Twice a season, they face the architect of their AFC West woes, a quarterback who has single-handedly carved out a dynasty in Kansas City and consistently left the Silver and Black in his wake. His dominance ‚Äì 12 wins in 14 outings against Las Vegas, racking up over 4,000 passing yards and 33 touchdowns ‚Äì has pushed the Raiders to the brink in their quest for a franchise quarterback. But how far were they willing to go to escape Mahomes' shadow? Could they, against all odds, have ever considered acquiring him?Raiders GM John Spytek recently gave an honest account of the team's rigorous two-year hunt for a starting quarterback. He confirmed their absolute commitment.""Pete [Carroll] and I were completely serious,"" Spytek stated, ""when we said we'd explore every possible avenue for a quarterback."" This intensive search, he shared, involved bold inquiries. ""We contacted various teams just to gauge interest,"" he admitted, jokingly adding, ""I'd be hesitant to even mention some of the names we inquired about trading for, but you never know.‚ÄùNaturally, the burning question from reporters was immediate: did this wide-ranging dragnet extend to Chiefs General Manager Brett Veach? In a league where ""desperate times call for desperate measures,"" the idea of somehow luring Mahomes away from their bitter rivals ‚Äì if you couldn't beat him, why not join him, right? ‚Äì might seem like a fleeting fantasy for a beleaguered fanbase.However, Spytek quickly squashed any such speculation. ""We didn't go that far, you know?"" he admitted, acknowledging the sheer implausibility of such a blockbuster, intra-division trade. The notion of Chiefs' Patrick Mahomes donning the Silver and Black, while perhaps a tantalizing dream for some, was never a realistic avenue for the Raiders' front office.Eventually, Spytek and Coach Pete Carroll's deep search led them to veteran quarterback Geno Smith from the Seahawks via trade. Spytek expressed confidence, noting Smith's strong performance and history with Carroll. ""With Geno in particular, Pete has a history with him, and he's played his best football for Pete,"" Spytek stated. ""And he played well last year, too.‚ÄùThe cost of securing Smith's services was substantial, involving a third-round draft pick and the absorption of the $75 million remaining on his contract. Even with the team's disappointing 4-13 finish last season, Spytek maintains a positive outlook on the team's trajectory under Smith's leadership. He stated, ""It's a work in progress, but he's been awesome so far.""Also Read: ‚ÄúGot hammered on a f**king boat‚Äù: Julian Edelman and Rob Gronkowski call out Tom Brady for being a lame teammate off the field The Raiders still face the challenge of Patrick Mahomes, but their plan is clear.

Former NBA legend, Allen Iverson shares a heartwarming post for his son, Isaiah Rahsaan Iverson on his Instagram. The post contains photos from Isaiah‚Äôs childhood, teenage years, and graduation ceremony. Allen went on to praise him saying that he‚Äôs the true definition of what a son should be, and the way he always looks out for family is what makes him better than others. He goes on to say how proud of a father he is. However, this post came days after Allen dedicated an entire post for ex-wife, Tawanna Turner.Allen Iverson talks profoundly about his son Isaiah on his recent Instagram post. He talks about Isaiah‚Äôs qualities and how he is a son that every father will be proud of.‚ÄúThe true definition of a son,‚Äù says Allen as he starts the post, showing how proud he is of Isaiah.Iverson further went on to say how Isaiah takes care of his mother and siblings, and never disrespects his parents. He also went on to say that Isaiah always puts family first and takes responsibility heads on. From his post it seems after Allen and Tawanna separated, it was Isaiah who put on the ""head of the family"" tag and took good care of the family.However, this post comes days after Allen dedicated an entire post to ex-wife Tawanna Turner, with whom he shares five children, Allen Iverson II, Isaiah Rahsaan Iverson, Dream Alijha, Tiaura, and Messiah Lauren. The post had a montage of the couple‚Äôs photos from prom, early court days, and as such. Allen captioned the photo as ‚ÄúHER‚Äù followed by heart and crossed fingers emoticons.Allen and Tawanna tied the knot in 2001, and had a happy marriage for quite some years. However, trouble entered their married life in the form of lavish expenditures, Iverson‚Äôs questionable parenting skills, and alcohol habits. In 2013, when Iverson retired from the world of NBA, his married life also came to an end. The couple called it quits in 2013 and agreed to co-parent their kids. Their divorce made headlines back in 2013 due to all the chaos it unraveled. With Iverson being officially bankrupt and declaring in the court that he doesn't even have money for a cheeseburger to Tawanna literally pulling out $61 from her purse and giving it to the NBA legend, the couple has seen it all. Tawanna has been Iverson's rock through all ups and down, and they still remained friends after the divorce. Iverson even gave a special shoutout to Tawanna in his Hall of Fame speech in 2016.However, it seems Allen‚Äôs life turned upside down soon after his lady luck left. After retirement, Allen spent all of his fortune on expensive cars, and lavish lifestyle. Due to this, he became bankrupt by 2015. Despite getting into the Hall of Fame in 2016, life was still in shambles for Iverson. The once NBA legend was back in square one, starting from scratch.Allen was at his top during his time with the Philadelphia 76ers, when he won the MVP of the year in 2001. He also went on to win the Rookie of the Year award in 1997. During the Game 1 of NBA Finals of 2001, Iverson scored 48 points against the Los Angeles Lakers, which was a record in itself. It was during this time that Iverson was the peak of his career, after which his life took a complete 180-degree turn.However, things have started taking turn for Iverson as he recently signed a deal with Reebok and agreed to be the Vice President of basketball division for the brand. He had earlier made a lifetime deal with Reebok back in 2001, which brought him $800,000 per year. The contract also had a clause that stated Iverson will get an additional $32 million at the age of 55. Will the new role help Iverson turn the course of events or will he fall back into old habits?

Wayne Gretzky, the face of hockey greatness, has ignited a fierce debate that goes beyond the ice rink‚Äîone that‚Äôs raising eyebrows across NHL circles and beyond. While appearing on The Pat McAfee Show, ""The Great One"" opened up about the financial disparities in the league, taking subtle aim at how no-state-income-tax franchises like the Florida Panthers might be gaining an upper hand in the talent war.Speaking candidly, Wayne Gretzky stated, ‚ÄúObviously Florida and Tampa Bay is a unique situation‚Ä¶from a financial point of view, if that‚Äôs what a player‚Äôs thinking about, obviously, but if a player‚Äôs thinking, you know, what I want to play in a hockey culture, like playing and living in the city of Edmonton, I loved it for 10 years.‚ÄùGretzky‚Äôs words struck a chord‚Äîhighlighting the growing tension between market-driven decisions and hockey's traditional roots. While Florida teams like the Panthers can offer higher take-home pay due to their tax structure, cities like Edmonton offer something money can‚Äôt buy: fan intensity and legacy.The Panthers‚Äô on-ice success, including multiple Stanley Cup Final runs, has coincided with the state‚Äôs tax-friendly policies, allowing the team to recruit and retain talent without overspending. That advantage, though legal, raises a question of fairness. Could this be undermining the NHL‚Äôs competitive balance?Wayne Gretzky didn‚Äôt directly accuse teams of exploiting the tax loophole‚Äîbut his tone was clear.When discussing Edmonton, he reflected, ‚ÄúYou leave the arena in Edmonton, you know you‚Äôve been in a hockey game‚Ä¶1.3 million have watched that game and the other 200,000‚Ä¶the only reason they didn‚Äôt is because they were working.‚ÄùIn response to the buzz, Panthers head coach Paul Maurice emphasized the area‚Äôs growing sports culture and praised efforts to build community over competition. ‚ÄúI think there‚Äôs room for all of us down here‚Ä¶So how about we just share it? We share the spotlight,‚Äù he said.Maurice also lauded GM Bill Zito‚Äôs cross-sport cooperation with the Dolphins and Marlins, saying, ‚ÄúBill‚Äôs been kind of involved.

Aaron Judge proves 2017 critics wrong with historic rise over Andrew Benintendi

Aaron Judge‚Äôs rise to greatness over Andrew Benintendi





Back in 2017, a comparison was made between two of the best rookie players in baseball- Andrew Benintendi of the Boston Red Sox and Aaron Judge of the New York Yankees. At that time, one well-known columnist chose Benintendi over Judge for the future. Eight years later, the numbers and career paths show a very different picture.On August 21, 2017, a column published in The Boston Globe favored Andrew Benintendi over Aaron Judge as the better long-term pick. The writer pointed to their head-to-head matchups that season. In their first 15 games against each other, Benintendi had better results: 4 home runs and 12 RBIs, while Judge hit just .155 with 1 home run and 2 RBIs against the Red Sox.Benintendi was thought to be a powerful all-round performer at the time. During the 2018 ALCS versus the Houston Astros, he had already made a significant contribution by making a critical catch that enabled the Red Sox to win the series and afterward the World Series. Boston had Aaron Judge five seasons before he was dealt to the Kansas City Royals in February 2021.In 2022, he was subsequently chosen to be an All-Star.Benintendi inked a five-year, $75 million contract with the Chicago White Sox in 2023. That season turned bad, though, as the club lost 121 games. Although not quite elite, Benintendi is a good hitter with a career average of .269 as of the moment.Also Read: Aaron Judge Breaks Century-Old Unbelievable Record Beating Mantle Gehrig And Hornsby In Epic Chase Aaron Judge, meanwhile, has developed into of the most well-known players in baseball. The Yankees' captain, two-time MVP, and six-time All-Star is presently 33 years old. Breaking the American League record, he hit 62 home runs in 2022. In 2023, he had 58 home runs, 144 RBIs, and a.322 average.Leading the league in several areas, batting average, on-base percentage, slugging, and total bases, Judge is set to do so in 2025. He is on course to have the greatest slugging season since Babe Ruth as of June. Judge honestly accepted culpability and vowed to bounce back stronger even after a critical mistake in Game 5 of the 2024 World Series.","Aaron judge proves 2017 critics wrong with historic rise over andrew benintendi.

Why Browns are thinking about Kirk Cousins for QB

Cleveland Browns TRADE for Kirk Cousins? ESPN proposes wild deal to shake up Browns QB room





The Cleveland Browns are heading into 2025 with a big question mark at quarterback. With Deshaun Watson out after Achilles surgery, the team‚Äôs current options‚ÄîKenny Pickett, Joe Flacco, Dillon Gabriel, and Shedeur Sanders‚Äîoffer potential but no clear answer. Now, talk is heating up about trading for veteran Kirk Cousins. He might be the solution the Browns are looking for or a costly risk they can‚Äôt afford.Watson‚Äôs injury has thrown the Browns into a tricky spot. GM Andrew Berry‚Äôs off-season moves brought in four quarterbacks, each with their own strengths, but none have proven they can consistently lead a team hungry for success. Pickett and Flacco have some experience, but questions remain about their ability to perform week in and week out. Meanwhile, Gabriel and Sanders are young and promising but unproven in the NFL.That‚Äôs where Kirk Cousins comes in. The 36-year-old veteran, currently the backup in Atlanta behind Michael Penix Jr., is eager for a starting role. USA TODAY‚Äôs Jacob Camenker believes Cousins could be the ideal short-term solution for the Browns, a steady veteran to guide the team while the younger quarterbacks develop. Cousins has a solid track record and knows how to work within a good offense, making him an appealing option.But there‚Äôs a catch. Cousins‚Äô salary is hefty, he‚Äôs part of a $180 million contract that would be tough for the Browns to take on, especially with Watson‚Äôs large contract still on the books. The team would have to make some serious financial moves to fit him in, and with Berry and coach Kevin Stefanski both under pressure to deliver, the stakes couldn‚Äôt be higher.The situation is further complicated by the Falcons‚Äô reluctance to trade Cousins. His absence from recent team activities hints he‚Äôs frustrated and pushing for a move, but Atlanta hasn‚Äôt shown much interest in letting him go yet.Also Read: ‚ÄúGo somewhere and chew on bark‚Äù: Terry Bradshaw‚Äôs savage message to Aaron Rodgers amid the No. 12 Jersey debate For Cleveland, trading for Cousins is a big gamble.

Shaquille O‚ÄôNeal, one of the most dominant forces in NBA history, recently reignited conversation around the changing nature of basketball across eras. Appearing on episodes of The Big Podcast and New Heights, O'Neal reflected on his toughest battles, shared vivid memories of his legendary dunks, and sparked debate by pointing out which current players could have survived and thrived in his bruising, physical era. His comments cut through nostalgia and bravado, offering a rare window into how he views greatness then and now.Shaquille O'Neal admits not every game was a cakewalk. When Brandon Jennings asked about the toughest era he faced, Shaq replied without hesitation, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a really unfair question because nobody ever really played me straight up,‚Äù he began. But he singled out the early 2000s, when the league introduced the ‚ÄúShaq Rules‚Äù as particularly challenging. ‚ÄúWhen you can do the front and back, it got difficult for a while‚Ä¶ with a guy in front of you, I really couldn't get the ball a lot. ‚ÄùHe also revealed how rugged the game was when he entered the league: ‚ÄúIt was the end of that ‚ÄòBad Boy‚Äô era. The Knicks would f*** you up. Detroit will still f*** you up.‚Äù He even admitted, ‚ÄúRik Smits used to embarrass me‚Ä¶ Hakeem [Olajuwon] was the last one to give me work.‚Äù Though he eventually surpassed his contemporaries, saying he ‚Äúgot Robinson out of there, I got Ewing out of there, I got Hakeem out of there,‚Äù Shaq acknowledged the mental and physical demands of the era.And yet, his peak came in this very stretch, when he led the Lakers to a historic three-peat from 2000 to 2002. The irony? His dominance grew in the very era he calls the toughest.Shaq didn‚Äôt mince words when asked which current players could hang in his time: ‚ÄúLeBron, of course‚Äîwell, he did play in our era. KD also played in our era. That‚Äôs about it.‚Äù But he made a bold addition, the Timberwolves‚Äô young star Anthony Edwards . ‚ÄúAnt Edwards, big and strong,‚Äù he said, signaling that Edwards‚Äô physicality reminds him of a bygone era.No conversation with Shaq is complete without revisiting his iconic dunks. He singled out two as his favorites, including the infamous poster over Knicks center Chris Dudley. ‚ÄúHe was all over me, and I was like, ‚ÄòGet the fu** off me,‚Äô‚Äù Shaq recalled.

What the Jazz Get in This Trade

Will the Los Angeles Lakers consider this trade idea?





Theface a critical offseason if they hope to contend for the 2025-26 NBA championship. One of their biggest needs? A reliable frontcourt presence to support Luka Doncic‚Äîor even replace him if necessary. A proposed trade with the Utah Jazz could be the solution.The Los Angeles Lakers struggled with depth in the 2025 postseason, often relying too heavily on their star players. A trade for Utah Jazz center Walker Kessler could provide the balance they need.According to Svyatoslav Rovenchuk of Lake Show Life , a potential deal could send Lakers guard Austin Reaves, Gabe Vincent, Maxi Kleber, and a 2031 first-round pick to Utah in exchange for Kessler, Collin Sexton, and Jordan Clarkson.""It's about that time of the year to cook up mock trades,"" Rovenchuk wrote. ""If the Lakers were interested in building up a more balanced roster that would not be as top-heavy, the Utah Jazz are certainly the team to call."" (H/t: Sporting News)In his three NBA seasons, 7-foot-1 center Walker Kessler has steadily improved. Among his strong points are:- Elite rim protection (2.4 blocks per game in 2024-25)- Strong rebounding (12.2 per game last season)- Effective pick-and-roll execution- Solid transition playWhile not yet a superstar, Kessler‚Äôs potential makes him an ideal fit next to LeBron James and Luka Doncic Walker Kessler‚Äôs 2024-25 Stats:According to Caleb Hightower of Sporting News Austin Reaves had a career-best regular season, silencing critics who doubted his ability as a primary scorer. However, his playoff performance dipped, raising questions about his consistency in high-pressure situations.Austin Reaves‚Äô 2024-25 Regular Season vs. Playoffs:Despite his postseason struggles, Austin Reaves remains a valuable trade asset. As Rovenchuk noted: ""A career year in Utah could allow AR15 to get his pay day too.""For Utah, this deal makes sense if they‚Äôre looking to rebuild around younger talent. The trade package includes:- A proven scorer in Reaves- A future first-round pick (2031)- Expiring contracts (Vincent and Kleber)This gives the Jazz flexibility while adding a potential long-term backcourt piece in Reaves.Walker Kessler's defensive presence would help the Los Angeles Lakers with their frontcourt problems, which they need to balance their squad. Reaves, meanwhile, might flourish in a more significant position with the Jazz.As Rovenchuk put it: ""In a best-case scenario, the Lakers walk away from this deal with a new starting center, and two veteran pieces that can play strong supporting roles for this team.""Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Should the Los Angeles Lakers trade Luka Doncic for $293.4 million Milwaukee Bucks superstar to form deadly duo with LeBron James?

Controversy around the Imane Khelif‚Äôs gold medal at Paris Olympic



IOC calls findings misinformation



Response of World Boxing

Fairness and safety concerns from athletes and federations



Ongoing debate on gender and sport eligibility





A leaked medical report from the 2023 World Championships has revealed that Olympic boxing champion Imane Khelifis biologically male, according to chromosome analysis. The report, made public just days after World Boxing ordered Khelif to undergo sex testing for eligibility in future female competitions, shows she has a male XY karyotype. This revelation challenges the International Olympic Committee‚Äôs (IOC) earlier dismissal of such tests and has intensified debate over fairness and safety in women‚Äôs boxing. The findings come amid ongoing controversy surrounding Khelif‚Äôs participation in women‚Äôs events, sparking calls for stricter verification procedures in sport.The report, published on the 3 Wire Sports website, states that Khelif‚Äôs chromosome analysis is ‚Äúabnormal‚Äù and confirms a male karyotype. It was conducted by Dr Lal PathLabs in New Delhi, a lab accredited by the American College of Pathologists and certified by the International Organisation for Standardisation. This directly challenges the IOC‚Äôs spokesperson Mark Adams, who had described such test results as ‚Äúad hoc‚Äù and ‚Äúnot legitimate‚Äù during a press conference at the Paris Olympics.The controversy surrounding Imane Khelif ‚Äôs Olympic gold medal run began as early as her first bout in Paris, where she faced Italy‚Äôs Angela Carini.Carini, an experienced and respected boxer, was visibly shaken during the match. Overwhelmed by Khelif‚Äôs strength and intensity, she appeared distressed and left the ring in tears after the fight, later telling media she had feared for her safety. The unease only deepened in the final bout, where Khelif defeated Taiwan‚Äôs Lin Yu-ting in a dominant display that many felt was physically one-sided. The power difference between the fighters drew sharp criticism, with commentators and athletes calling it ‚Äúuncomfortable to watch‚Äù and likening it to watching a man beat a woman in the ring. The moment became one of the most controversial of the Paris Games, fuelling an international debate over fairness and inclusion in women‚Äôs sport.IOC president Thomas Bach dismissed the report as part of a Russian-led misinformation campaign, citing ethical and financial issues within the International Boxing Association (IBA), which conducted the tests. Despite these claims, the legitimacy of the Indian lab‚Äôs certification has increased pressure on the IOC to clarify its position and respond to questions about Khelif‚Äôs eligibility.Following the leak, World Boxing has declared that Khelif must pass mandatory chromosome testing before competing in any future female events. The 26-year-old Olympic champion, who was allowed to compete in Paris due to her female passport status, has so far not provided evidence to confirm female chromosomes. World Boxing now requires all athletes over 18 in its competitions to undergo PCR genetic testing to verify their sex, a measure introduced in response to this controversy.The case has raised serious safety and fairness concerns within the boxing community. Opponents like Italy‚Äôs Angela Carini and Mexico‚Äôs Brianda Tamara have spoken out about the physical challenges they faced competing against Khelif. Latin American federations have been particularly vocal, urging that women‚Äôs competitions be restricted to athletes assigned female at birth, in order to protect fairness and athlete safety.The Khelif controversy highlights the complex and sensitive issues surrounding transgender and intersex athletes in competitive sport. It underscores the need for clear, consistent policies that balance inclusivity with fairness and safety. As governing bodies reassess their rules, the case remains a key example of the challenges faced in maintaining the integrity of women‚Äôs sports.The ongoing debate around Imane Khelif‚Äôs case brings to light just how complex and emotionally charged the conversation about gender and eligibility in sport has become. At the heart of it are real athletes ‚Äî women who train for years and step into the ring expecting fairness. Many feel blindsided and unheard when competing against opponents whose physical attributes raise legitimate concerns about safety and equality. This isn‚Äôt about exclusion, but about protecting hard-won opportunities for women in sport. Khelif‚Äôs story reminds us that governing bodies must act transparently, thoughtfully, and with empathy for all athletes involved.",Imane khelif ‚Äôs medical report contradicts ioc‚Äôs official position.
