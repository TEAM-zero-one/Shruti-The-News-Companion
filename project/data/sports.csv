Former NBA player backs Russell Westbrook amid LeBron James ’ scapegoating rumor

Russell Westbrook last played for the Denver Nuggets, but he is currently a free agent. While the Sacramento Kings got themselves hinged with the former NBA MVP, Westbrook is now rumored to have been linked with a new offer overseas. A Chinese team is now eyeing Westbrook for a massive deal, and it’s all over social media. The still-unnamed team is willing to pay the former Nuggets star quadruple what the Sacramento Kings had offered to him. Now that is a huge advancement for Westbrook after the scapegoating rumor that had him blamed for all the wrong reasons during his time with the Los Angeles Lakers. Here’s more information about Russell Westbrook and his big moment with the Chinese team:According to Carmichael Dave of Sactown Sports 1140, an unnamed Chinese team is willing to offer Russell Westbrook a mega deal. The new agreement is willing to offer four times more than what the Sacramento Kings initially offered to Westbrook.“I heard something from someone I trust enough not to blow off what they said. He may have an offer in China for about half a season”, Carmichael Dave said on the podcast. “And it’s damn near quadruple what the Kings could offer him”, he further added.However, previously, the former NBA MVP was linked to the Xinjiang Flying Tigers, as per PlayProphetx.Now, the question is whether Westbrook will sign the deal with the unnamed Chinese team.Even if he does sign for half a season, he could return to the big league by January, and that sounds like a fair deal. Every other player has done it over the course of many years.After the failure of the Los Angeles Lakers in 2021, while Westbrook was still a part of it, the former NBA MVP had to face many criticisms about the same. According to the former ex-NBA player, Enes Kanter, Westbrook became the scapegoat of the team led by Lebron James.“If you play with someone like LeBron, it’s all about LeBron. And if the season fails, then you need some kind of scapegoat”, said Kanter. “After that, look at his career—this guy can’t even find a team right now”, Enes Kanter added further. He also added that huge scapegoating affected Westbrook mentally, and he didn’t deserve this.Also read: Enes Kanter slams LeBron James and Los Angeles Lakers for destroying Russell Westbrook’s career after 2021 disaster","A chinese team is now eyeing russell westbrook for a massive deal, and it’s all over social media.

Assessing the Winners

My Final Thoughts on this Mock Trade

Theare reportedly exploring a potential trade with the Washington Wizards centered around sharpshooter, with young forward Jonathan Kuminga expected to headline the package heading to D.C. The rumored deal has generated considerable buzz around the NBA, as Golden State looks to strengthen its championship hopes, improve roster balance, and create more financial flexibility during the final stages of Stephen Curry’s title window.According to multiple reports, the proposed trade structure would see the Golden State Warriors send Jonathan Kuminga to the Wizards in exchange for Corey Kispert and a future 2030 first-round draft pick - a selection that originally belonged to Golden State.• Golden State Warriors receive: Corey Kispert, 2030 first-round pick (originally theirs)• Washington Wizards receive: Jonathan KumingaThis swap would immediately benefit Golden State financially, as Kispert’s projected $13.9 million contract is roughly $8.6 million less than Kuminga’s $22.5 million deal, easing the team’s growing luxury tax concerns.For the Golden State Warriors, acquiring Corey Kispert would address several needs simultaneously. The 26-year-old wing is a proven 3-and-D specialist who thrives in motion offenses, making him a seamless fit next to Curry, Jimmy Butler , and Draymond Green. His career 38.2% shooting from beyond the arc adds another reliable perimeter threat to a team that thrives on spacing and quick ball movement.Another key benefit is the reacquisition of their 2030 first-round pick, which increases the team’s flexibility for future trades. Moreover, the move reduces overall salary obligations, aligning with the front office’s strategy to trim costs while keeping the roster competitive.For Washington, this trade represents a classic rebuilding move. By landing 22-year-old Jonathan Kuminga , the Wizards secure a high-upside player with star potential. Kuminga’s athleticism, defensive versatility, and ability to create off the dribble make him an exciting addition to their young core. The Wizards can offer him a larger offensive role, providing the developmental environment he needs to unlock his full potential and become a franchise cornerstone.• Immediate upgrade in floor spacing and perimeter shooting.• A better positional fit in Steve Kerr’s offensive system.• Relief from financial pressure with reduced salary commitments.• Regained control of a valuable future draft asset.• Losing a young player with genuine star potential.• Corey Kispert’s defensive limitations and lack of elite athleticism could cap his ceiling.• Reduced long-term upside, as Kuminga’s best years may still be ahead.• Acquire a former lottery pick with elite athleticism and untapped potential.• Kuminga can grow into a featured role on a team focused on development.• Ideal move for a rebuilding franchise seeking future stars.• Loss of a key floor-spacer in Kispert, potentially affecting offensive balance.• Uncertainty over whether Kuminga can develop into a consistent, franchise-level player in a losing environment.Corey Kispert’s strength lies in his efficiency as a spot-up shooter and off-ball mover. Standing at 6-foot-7, he has improved his ability to find space within offensive schemes but remains limited as a creator and defender. Kuminga, on the other hand, offers elite athleticism, defensive versatility, and a far higher developmental ceiling, though he remains inconsistent and unproven as a lead scorer.• Golden State Warriors: This is a “win-now” move that prioritizes fit, shooting, and financial relief. The front office’s focus is clearly on maximizing Curry’s championship window, even if it means parting with a potential future star.• Washington Wizards: The Wizards get the long-term win by adding a potential franchise player in Kuminga, aligning perfectly with their rebuilding vision.• Jonathan Kuminga: Gains a larger role and more on-ball opportunities in Washington, but must prove he can thrive without veteran guidance in a rebuilding setup.• Corey Kispert: Lands in an ideal environment in Golden State, where his shooting and movement can shine alongside elite playmakers.The proposed trade between Golden State and Washington encapsulates the contrasting priorities of both franchises - one aiming to capitalize on its championship core, the other looking to secure its future. For the Golden State Warriors, it’s a calculated gamble that enhances shooting, chemistry, and flexibility. For the Wizards, it’s an investment in potential that could pay off massively if Kuminga fulfills his promise.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Utah Jazz Could Part Ways With $238 Million Superstar Ahead of 2025-26 Season; Exploring Possible Better Teams Ultimately, the deal will be judged by what Kuminga becomes. If he develops into an All-Star, Washington walks away with a clear victory. But if Corey Kispert helps the Golden State Warriors capture another title, Golden State’s decision to prioritize the present will look like a masterstroke.","The golden state warriors are reportedly exploring a potential trade with the washington wizards centered around sharpshooter jonathan kuminga.

My Two Cents: Who Wins the Trade?

Theare reportedly weighing a blockbuster trade proposal that could drastically reshape their roster ahead of the 2025-26 NBA season. With LeBron James ’ health being carefully managed and uncertainty surrounding his availability for the season opener, the Lakers appear open to bold moves to stay competitive.As the regular season approaches, LeBron James ’ readiness remains in question. According to his agent, Rich Paul, the Los Angeles Lakers have been advised to take a cautious route to ensure the veteran star is fully healthy for what could be one of the final runs of his storied career.“LeBron wants to compete for a championship,” Paul told ESPN. “He knows the Lakers are building for the future. He understands that, but he values a realistic chance of winning it all. We are very appreciative of the partnership that we’ve had for eight years with Jeanie [Buss] and Rob [Pelinka] and consider the Lakers as a critical part of his career.” (H/t: Sporting News)James, now entering his 22nd season, is prioritizing longevity and success over rushing back to the court. The Los Angeles Lakers, in turn, are reportedly exploring options to add more star power to their lineup and support their aging superstar.Reports suggest the Los Angeles Lakers are keeping a close watch on the Utah Jazz, particularly regarding two of their players - Walker Kessler and Lauri Markkanen. While Kessler’s availability remains uncertain, there are whispers that Utah might entertain offers for Markkanen if the right package is presented.“It’s unclear if Utah will be reasonable in its trade demands for Kessler, but the door appears at least slightly ajar for the Lakers to bring that value back to Los Angeles given the failed extension,” wrote Lake Show Life’s Max Ogden.Bleacher Report’s Andy Bailey proposed a hypothetical trade that has since gained traction among fans and analysts. The deal would send a significant haul from Los Angeles to Utah in exchange for All-Star forward Lauri Markkanen - who is currently on a $195 million deal.The deal is designed to give the Los Angeles Lakers another elite scorer who can stretch the floor alongside Anthony Davis, potentially forming a dangerous frontcourt duo.While landing Markkanen would instantly improve the Lakers’ offensive potential, the price tag is enormous. Losing young contributors like Reaves and Hachimura would strip Los Angeles of much of its depth and chemistry, while Knecht’s departure would mean sacrificing a promising long-term asset.For Utah, the return is far more appealing. The Jazz would receive multiple first-round picks, a mix of established talent, and Knecht - who could emerge as a cornerstone for their rebuild.• Gain a proven All-Star scorer• Improve frontcourt shooting and spacing• Risk depleting bench depth and future draft assets• Acquire young and versatile contributors• Stockpile valuable draft capital• Strengthen long-term rebuild potentialThe proposed trade certainly stirs excitement, but its benefits lean more toward Utah. The Jazz would gain both present and future assets, while the Lakers would risk sacrificing depth and flexibility for a single All-Star addition.As noted by Hunter Cookston, who reported the story, “The proposed trade would certainly shake up the NBA - but for the Lakers, it’s questionable at best. In this scenario, the clear winner would be the Jazz.”Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Golden State Warriors Potentially Eyeing $54 Million Washington Wizards Forward to Bolster Squad Around Stephen Curry With LeBron James nearing the twilight of his career and Anthony Davis in his prime, the Los Angeles Lakers face a challenging balance between contending now and safeguarding their future.

Jalen Brunson admits New York Knicks are still adjusting to Mike Brown’s offense

Mike Brown calls first half performance sloppy but praises late game improvement

Mike Brown aims to transform New York Knicks offense with movement-based system

The New York Knicks are racking up wins, but there’s still an odd vibe. Jalen Brunson and the squad are adapting to Mike Brown’s fresh offense, which focuses on movement rather than isolation. This is a significant change for a team that’s been accustomed to Brunson running the show.The system has potential, but the struggles are evident. Will the Knicks be able to fully embrace this new approach before the actual season kicks off?During a post-game interview, Jalen Brunson, the point guard for the New York Knicks, openly spoke about the team's challenges in getting used to Mike Brown's offense. He shared his thoughts with the reporter, Brunson stated: ""Everything is new, so attention to detail is going to be key for us to get better faster. All the little things we pick up, and we learn, we can't just skip over that; we've got to really understand that those little things make a big difference. For us that's the most important thing.""Earlier in the preseason, after a game against the Philadelphia 76ers on October 6, 2025, Brunson told the New York Daily News: ""I’m comfortable... We’re still adjusting."" He has shown progress, scoring 14 points on 5-of-10 shooting in that matchup, prompting Brown to praise his adjustment to the ""run-run-run-run-run"" pace in a post-game comment: ""Him just getting used to ‘run-run-run-run-run,’ and still be effective, whether you’re on the ball or off the ball, it was great to see.On October 9, 2025, the New York Knicks pulled off a 100-95 overtime win against the Minnesota Timberwolves during a preseason matchup at Madison Square Garden, making their exhibition record 3-0. But the first half revealed some adaptation problems, with the Knicks only managing to score 38 points (20 in the first quarter and 18 in the second).They bounced back in the second half, racking up 52 points to push the game into overtime. Jalen Brunson had a tough night, hitting just 4-of-14 from the field for an efficiency of 28.6%, according to post-game reports.Head coach Mike Brown described the first half as ""sloppy"" in his post-game press conference, saying to reporters ""I thought first half, we were little sloppy with it (the ball). We did improve in the second half by taking better care of the basketball. We ended up with 23 assists for the game, which is pretty good. We didn’t shoot it well, but that’s okay. I thought we went through stretches.""Mike Brown, who has won NBA Coach of the Year twice, was hired to bring some energy to the New York Knicks' offense. According to ESPN on July 7, 2025, the Knicks brought Brown on board to tackle their offensive issues in the postseason, where lineups without Brunson managed to score only 100 points for every 100 possessions.Brown's philosophy prioritizes player and ball movement, as noted by Knicks guard Miles McBride during media day: ""A lot more player movement, ball movement... Last year, at times, we got stagnant and we depended on a lot of isolation shots.""On October 3, 2025, ESPN analyst Brian Windhorst pointed out this shift, mentioning that Brown is steering the team away from Jalen Brunson's isolation plays and towards a style that echoes the championship offense of the 2014 San Antonio Spurs, focusing on a shared effort among players like Karl-Anthony Towns, Mikal Bridges, and OG Anunoby.The New York Knicks' lineup, which includes talents such as Jalen Brunson, Mikal Bridges, and Karl-Anthony Towns, has the potential to create a strong offense under Mike Brown. Yet, the first signs in the preseason point to potential challenges on the horizon.At an NBC event on October 9, 2025, a seven-time NBA All-Star shared worries about Brunson's position in Brown's ball-movement strategy, stating ""The only question mark I have is Jalen Brunson has been on the ball all the time. Mike Brown comes from a pedigree of ball movement, player movement. So it’s going to be interesting... to see if he’s on the ball or off the ball, and how he reacts to that.""As the regular season gets closer, the New York Knicks' perfect preseason record hints at a positive trend, but honing Brown's system will be vital for their chances in the Eastern Conference.Also Read: “I’d really love to play those guys” — Michael Jordan admits being envious of younger NBA stars who inspired his comeback","Jalen brunson admits new york knicks are still adjusting to mike brown’s offense.

Ryan Clark says Cam Skattebo offered him candy from his pants after a game



“Hell no, what makes you think I’d eat your crotch candy?”

Fans react online with “Another apology incoming”

You know those locker room stories that sound too weird to be real? Yeah, Ryan Clark just dropped one of those and it involves candy, sweat, and Cam Skattebo. The ESPN analyst and former NFL star shared a truly bizarre tale about the Arizona State running back that has fans across social media gagging, laughing, and asking, “Did he really just say that?”The story came up when Ryan Clark was recounting locker room moments involving ASU’s standout running back. Clark said Skattebo would apparently stash candy in his pants and offer it around postgame. His reaction? Absolute disgust. Clark claims Skattebo once offered him candy… but not from a regular bag. Nope, according to Clark, the candy came straight out of his pants and yes, this was apparently after a game, before any showering happened. Cue the collective “eww” from the internet.Clark said while telling the story.Now, whether this was a joke, a slight exaggeration, or a real story from the depths of sports culture, no one knows. But it’s the kind of quote that doesn’t need context to go viral.Ryan Clark’s “crotch candy” story has added yet another eyebrow-raising moment to his long list of on-air gaffes. Fans flooded social media with reactions ranging from disgust to disbelief, questioning his professionalism and wondering how he’s still employed at ESPN.This latest bizarre anecdote only continues a pattern of Clark making wild claims or jokes that later require apologies, cementing his reputation as the analyst who can’t seem to stay off the apology train.There’s no way to confirm whether this story is fact or just friendly locker-room exaggeration. But honestly, it might not even matter. The sheer absurdity of Clark’s “crotch candy” tale has already cemented its place in sports internet history. If Clark’s track record is anything to go by, fans are already seeing an apology coming next.Whether you think it’s gross, hilarious, or just plain weird, one thing’s for sure, Ryan Clark knows how to keep people talking. “Crotch candy” might just be the most chaotic phrase in sports this week, and we’ll probably never look at postgame snacks the same way again.

A sea of fans, chaos, and one heartfelt plea — “Usko lagna nahi chahiye.” That’s what former India cricketer Abhishek Nayar was heard saying repeatedly as he shielded Rohit Sharma from an overwhelming crowd outside Mumbai’s iconic Shivaji Park on Friday evening.The viral clip, now flooding social media, captures the frenzy surrounding India’s cricketing superstar. As Rohit stepped out after a two-hour practice session, hundreds of fans surged toward the exit to catch a glimpse of the former India captain. Amid the commotion, Nayar, Rohit’s longtime friend and former Mumbai teammate, positioned himself protectively between the fans and the cricketer, urging restraint.“Koi dhakka mat dena, hum sab fans hain, lekin usko lagna nahi chahiye,” Nayar can be heard pleading as security personnel hurriedly formed a human corridor for Rohit’s safe passage to his vehicle.

Shubman Gill on ODI captaincy: Leading India with lessons from Rohit Sharma & Virat Kohli

WATCH:

Poll Do you think Jaiswal will convert his innings into a double century? Yes, definitely! Maybe, but it's uncertain

NEW DELHI: The opening day of the second India vs West Indies Test at Arun Jaitley Stadium on Friday belonged to Yashasvi Jaiswal , whose scintillating 173 not out anchored India to a commanding 318/2 at stumps. Alongside him, captain Shubman Gill remained unbeaten on 20, as the duo added 67 crucial runs for the third wicket, putting India firmly in control of the match.While Jaiswal’s batting brilliance stole the headlines, a light-hearted yet unusual incident captured the imagination of fans worldwide. Towards the end of the day, Gill suffered a nasty collision with West Indies wicketkeeper Tevin Imlach during a quick single in the 85th over. Both players looked visibly shaken, prompting medical staff to rush on for treatment.In a viral moment that has since taken social media by storm, Jaiswal was seen taking charge of Gill’s concussion check. The 23-year-old opener humorously asked the Indian captain how many fingers he was holding up, mimicking the standard concussion protocol while both players shared a laugh. Fans praised the playful gesture, showcasing Jaiswal’s awareness and camaraderie on the field.Jaiswal’s innings itself was historic. His 173 came off 253 balls and included 22 fours, marking his second instance of scoring 150+ runs on the first day of a Test in India, after a 179-run masterclass against England in Vizag in 2024. Only Virat Kohli has achieved a similar feat on the same venues. Out of his seven Test centuries, five have crossed the 150-run mark, placing him in elite company alongside Don Bradman , who had eight 150+ scores before turning 24.With India ending Day 1 on 318/2, the focus now shifts to whether Jaiswal can convert his dominance into a bigger score and help India seal a 2-0 series sweep.",Yashasvi jaiswal scores 173 not out as india reach 318-2 on day 1 of second test.

IND vs WI 1st Test: Why West Indies' decision to bat first vs India backfired?

Poll Will Yashasvi Jaiswal score a triple century in his innings? Yes, he will achieve it! No, he won't reach that milestone.

NEW DELHI: India’s legendary spinner Anil Kumble lavished high praise on opener Yashasvi Jaiswal after the young left-hander’s unbeaten 173 lit up the opening day of the second Test against West Indies at the Arun Jaitley Stadium on Friday. The former India captain went a step further — tipping Jaiswal to turn his marathon innings into a historic triple hundred on Saturday.“Jaiswal is just getting better and better day by day,” Kumble said on JioHotstar’s Amul Cricket Live. “We’ve spoken about his hunger and his attitude toward building big innings, not just for himself but for the team. Even in the previous game, he got off to a good start but was dismissed early, so he’s certainly made up for that here.”The 23-year-old southpaw, who has already amassed almost 2500 runs in just 26 Tests with seven centuries and 12 fifties, batted through the entire first day. His 173 came off 253 balls, decorated with 22 fours, and put India in command at 318/2 at stumps.Kumble, who has seen several modern greats from close quarters, lauded Jaiswal’s temperament and ability to convert starts into monumental knocks. “Throughout his short career, he has shown that he doesn’t waste opportunities like these.Once he’s in, he makes it count — and that’s wonderful to see,” he said.The veteran also pointed out Jaiswal’s rare consistency in producing big hundreds — five of his seven centuries have been scores over 150. Only Graeme Smith and Don Bradman have comparable numbers before turning 24.With the pitch flattening out and West Indies’ bowlers already looking fatigued, Kumble urged the youngster to aim even higher. “He’s still out there, and he can go on to score big runs tomorrow… Jaiswal now has a great opportunity, not just for a double hundred, but maybe even a triple hundred,” Kumble added.If Jaiswal does convert his unbeaten 173 into a triple century, he would become only the third Indian in history to do so — joining Virender Sehwag and Karun Nair.","Yashasvi jaiswal's unbeaten 173 lit up the opening day of the second test against west indies at the arun jaitley stadium.

Poll Which team's performance impressed you the most in their latest match? Germany Northern Ireland France Switzerland

Germany, four-time World Cup winners, returned to winning ways on Friday, thrashing 10-man Luxembourg 4-0 to reclaim top spot in Group A. Captain Joshua Kimmich was the star of the show, scoring a first-half penalty and tapping in a second goal shortly after the break. David Raum’s precise free-kick and Serge Gnabry’s early second-half strike sealed the emphatic win for Julian Nagelsmann’s side.Germany, who endured group-stage exits in both the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, showed a renewed poise and swagger missing from their earlier qualifiers. The victory moved them level on points with Slovakia and Northern Ireland, but ahead on goal difference. Luxembourg’s task became near-impossible after Dirk Carlson was sent off for a handball inside the box within the first 20 minutes, conceding the penalty that Kimmich converted.Northern Ireland kept alive hopes of a fourth World Cup appearance and a first since 1986, defeating Slovakia 2-0 at Windsor Park. An early own goal from Patrik Hrosovsky and a stunning late volley by Trai Hume secured the win. “It was a great night, good performance and the most important thing is the three points,” Hume said.In Paris, Kylian Mbappe continued his fine form at Parc des Princes, scoring just before halftime to mark his 10th goal in consecutive games for Real Madrid and France. Adrien Rabiot and the returning Florian Thauvin also scored as Didier Deschamps’ side eased past Azerbaijan 3-0, remaining unbeaten after three matches and leading Group D. Despite the win, Deschamps urged caution ahead of Monday’s clash in Iceland. “It’s three points more but perhaps not in the way we wanted… Monday will be another game, another context,” he said.Elsewhere, Switzerland maintained their perfect record in Group B, defeating Sweden 2-0, while Kosovo and Slovenia played out a goalless draw. Belgium, chasing a 13th World Cup appearance, were held 0-0 by North Macedonia, who currently top Group J after famously eliminating Germany from the 2022 World Cup qualifiers.With key wins and dominant performances from the likes of Germany, France, and Switzerland, the race for World Cup qualification in Europe is heating up, leaving fans eagerly anticipating Monday’s pivotal fixtures.","Germany thrash 10-man luxembourg 4-0 to reclaim top spot in group a.

Rohit Sharma removed as India ODI captain, a glorious era comes to an end

Poll Do you agree with Mohammad Kaif that Rohit Sharma will play a key role in the 2027 ODI World Cup despite losing captaincy? Yes, I completely agree No, I disagree

NEW DELHi: Former India cricketer Mohammad Kaif has made a bold statement about Rohit Sharma ’s future, asserting that the Mumbai batter will feature prominently in the 2027 ODI World Cup despite being relieved of his captaincy. Shubman Gill was recently appointed India’s new ODI captain ahead of the three-match series against Australia starting October 19, but Kaif believes Rohit’s leadership status will not affect his role as a key opener for India.“He will definitely play, boss. Look, the captaincy may have been taken away from him, but I believe that as an opener, Rohit Sharma will do his job,” Kaif said on his YouTube channel.The former cricketer highlighted the importance of experience in challenging conditions, particularly in South Africa, where the World Cup will be co-hosted alongside Zimbabwe and Namibia. “You need an experienced batter in the side. You can’t go to South Africa with an entirely young team. Sometimes in those seaming conditions, the ball moves a lot and the pitches are bouncy. If you take only new players there, they’ll get exposed.Kaif praised Rohit’s ability to handle pace and bounce, saying, “That’s why I feel you need a player who can handle the bounce, who can pull and cut the rising deliveries just like Rohit Sharma does. On those kinds of pitches, I believe Rohit Sharma will perform even better. His batting style as an opener suits such conditions perfectly. He plays the rising ball, the one that bounces from the front, extremely well. Among all the players you can name, Rohit Sharma is the only one who handles that rising delivery so effectively. ”He also emphasised the importance of combining youth with experience in crucial tournaments.“Just look at his numbers, his years of experience. On a big stage like the World Cup, you need players like Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma, players who have seen the world and experienced ups and downs. In a tournament like the World Cup, you’re going to lose a game or two in between, then you’ll need to make a comeback. You’ll face those do-or-die matches where you must win to reach the quarterfinals or top four. In such crucial situations, the roles of Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli become absolutely vital.”",Mohammad kaif believes rohit sharma will play a key role in the 2027 odi world cup despite being relieved of his captaincy.

Poll Do you think Yashasvi Jaiswal can surpass Sachin Tendulkar's Test century record? Yes, he has the talent. No, Tendulkar's record is monumental.

NEW DELHI: Test cricket can be hard, brutal business if you lack penetration as a bowling unit. Coming into this game, the West Indies had the third worst win-loss ratio in Tests since 2020, having lost 23 of 41 matches, making them marginally better than Bangladesh and bottom-placed Ireland. That lack of aptitude and imagination showed at the Ferozeshah Kotla on Friday, in spite of periods of disciplined bowling, as the once-mighty Windies bowling unit seemed cannon fodder for a strong Indian top order on a dry, batting-friendly surface.For those who missed out in Ahmedabad, it was time to rack up the numbers — Yashasvi Jaiswal reminded the world of his penchant for daddy hundreds, becoming only the second Test opener after Graeme Smith to score seven Test tons before turning 24. Among Indians, he is now second only to the peerless Sachin Tendulkar , who had scored 11. Five of his hundreds are scores of 150 or more. Giving Jaiswal company for most of the day was the under-pressure Sai Sudharsan, who fell 13 runs short of the three-figure mark but played an important role in a 193-run second-wicket stand, the fourth-highest partnership ever by a lefthanded Indian pair in Tests.Jaiswal ended the day batting on 173 off 253 balls (22x4) and passed 3,000 runs across formats. India took stumps on Day One of the second Test at 318/2 after Shubman Gill won the first toss of his short captaincy career.It was all worthy pursuit for India — they are chasing the full WTC points at home and some have reputations at stake, so there were no half-hearted measures. For the West Indies, it was ceaseless toil, with only left-arm spinner Jomel Warrican coming away with some special moments, notably the dismissals of KL Rahul and Sudharsan, with some alarming turn offering a portent of what might be to come in this Test.West Indies had seemed despondent in the days leading up to the Test and must have been world weary by the end of Day One. None of that matters, of course, to Jaiswal, who played largely within himself, mindful of the need to take the game away from the opposition on the first day itself.Jaiswal scored only 10 off his first 36 deliveries, trying to increase the control percentage of the cut shots which have been both his boon and bane, as the West Indies seamers started off with controlled lengths and disciplined lines. A yard or two of extra pace would have gone a long way, though.Even before an hour was through, Jaiswal was heard on the stump mic telling his opening partner how nothing much was happening off the pitch, a typical Kotla phenomenon, and with little seam movement on offer, it was a matter of time before the bowlers’ lengths disintegrated and India’s batting found some fluency.There will be a lot of spin to be bowled yet, but the first wicket that fell to spinners in this game was a wonderful one — an unusually aggressive Rahul was left mystified, first beaten in the air and then off the pitch by one from Warrican which turned 84 degrees, having landed either on the seam or on a crack.The dismissal only strengthened the hungry Jaiswal’s resolve to leave his imprint on the game. He decided to adapt minimalism instead of expansive, ambitious strokeplay or bold footwork, playing crisp, clean cover drives, straight drives, threading open spaces behind square when available and rotating strike efficiently. By the second session, his trademark run-scoring square of the wicket was in full view as Jayden Seales started offering width.With no innovation or attempt to disrupt proceedings by Windies captain Roston Chase, all Jaiswal needed to do was exhibit restraint and then cash in on loose offerings. The Windies bowled no extras but Jaiswal reacted by not attempting any sixes throughout the day.Sure, the seamers could have bowled fuller, especially in the middle session, while the spinners could have made more effort to change the angles. The captain could have messed up the fields a bit more to plant doubts in the batters’ minds, but maybe Chase knew the Indian batters would just raise their game.Such is most of Test cricket these days, strangely lop-sided affairs which have largely alienated the cricket-loving masses. Not counting, of course, contests between the chosen top three or four teams, most of which have had robust first-class structures with strong financial backing in place for close to a century or more. For the others, there is perhaps little incentive remaining now to invest in building such infrastructure for the red-ball game.India’s expected dominance on Day One may further deflate the Windies, meaning there might be more to come from Jaiswal. Sudharsan, meanwhile, showed he deserved a longer rope at No. 3.","Yashasvi jaiswal becomes only the second test opener after graeme smith to score seven test tons before turning 24.
