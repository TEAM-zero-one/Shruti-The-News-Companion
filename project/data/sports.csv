The expression on captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni ‚Äôs face said it all as Chennai Super Kings suffered another defeat‚Äîthis time a five-wicket loss to Sunrisers Hyderabad at the MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai on Friday. A visibly disappointed Dhoni admitted that a total of 154 was far from ‚Äújustifiable‚Äù on a Chepauk pitch that didn‚Äôt have any demons, as SRH dealt a near-fatal blow to CSK‚Äôs IPL 2025 play-off chances.Also See: DC vs RCB IPL Live Score Sunrisers chased down the modest target in just 18.4 overs. Dhoni pointed out that it's always tough when several players fail to deliver simultaneously.He also believed that SRH batted under slightly tougher conditions in the second innings, yet CSK couldn't capitalise. For the skipper, the lack of cohesion in the team's overall effort was most frustrating.""I think we kept losing wickets and another thing is in the first innings the wicket was slightly better and 157 wasn't a justifiable score,"" Dhoni said after CSK‚Äôs loss.""It wasn't turning a lot, a little two-paced but nothing out of the ordinary. Yes, second innings there was a bit of help. Our spinners, the quality was there and they were bowling in the right areas, but we were 15-20 runs short,"" he added.Commenting on Dewald Brevis‚Äô performance, Dhoni said, ""[On Brevis] I think he batted really well and we needed that in the middle order. When the spinners come in, you do it either by batsmanship or picking the right areas, but that's an area where we want to improve because middle overs are crucial.""Reflecting on the broader issues plaguing the team, Dhoni didn‚Äôt hold back.""In a tournament like this, if there are one or two areas to plug in the holes it's good, but when a majority of the players are not doing well you need to make changes. You can't just keep going. We are just not putting enough runs on the board,"" he said.With this win, SRH have moved up to eighth place on the points table, registering three wins and six losses for a total of six points.CSK, meanwhile, sit at the bottom with just two wins from nine games and only four points to show.","Chennai super kings lost by five wickets to sunrisers hyderabad on friday.

Desmond Watson signs with Buccaneers, becomes heaviest player ever to join an NFL team



After going undrafted in the 2025 NFL Draft, Desmond Watson , one of the Florida Gators ' most beloved fan favorites, has landed a spot with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers . The towering 6-foot-5, 464-pound defensive tackle inked an undrafted free agent contract with the Buccaneers just moments after the draft ended, marking him as the team's first UDFA signing. The contract includes a $20,000 signing bonus and $50,000 in guaranteed money, offering Watson a strong foundation as he embarks on his NFL journey.Desmond Watson's unique combination of size and skill makes him a standout figure in the NFL. At 464 pounds, Watson now holds the record as the heaviest player in NFL history , surpassing the previous record set by offensive tackle Aaron Gibson by an impressive 54 pounds. Watson joins a talented group of nose tackles in Tampa Bay, including Vita Vea and Greg Gaines. Over his collegiate career, Watson accumulated 63 tackles, 1.5 sacks, and a memorable forced fumble and recovery in 2022, which cemented his place in Gators history.Though Watson was not invited to the NFL Scouting Combine, his performance at Florida's Pro Day captured the attention of scouts. He clocked an impressive 5.95-second 40-yard dash, making him the third slowest runner of all time at his size but still managing to impress those in attendance. Additionally, Watson's 36 reps on the bench press would have been the highest at the Combine, demonstrating his raw strength and athleticism despite his considerable size.Tampa Bay's head coach, Billy Napier, praised Watson‚Äôs exceptional abilities. ""He's a unicorn. That stature,"" Napier said at the Pro Day. ""And then, you get to know Des. He's extremely intelligent. He's got a great sense of humor. He was a great teammate. Obviously showed up in good shape (for pro day). He'll get his shot, and I'm hoping he'll make the most of it.""What makes Watson's journey even more remarkable is his hometown connection to Tampa Bay. Born and raised in Plant City, Florida, Watson will now have the opportunity to play just hours away from where he made his mark both in high school at Armwood and in college with the Gators. This proximity adds an extra layer of excitement as he competes for a spot on the Buccaneers' roster, with the potential to play in front of a familiar Florida crowd in the NFL.While Watson's weight has been a topic of discussion throughout his career, it‚Äôs clear he has made significant strides. Prior to the draft, Watson spoke about his weight management efforts: ""There (are) times where I do basically starving and stuff like that... I didn‚Äôt feel confident that way. I didn‚Äôt feel strong, I didn‚Äôt feel fast. I feel like right now is the best I felt with the process of losing weight.""Watson‚Äôs commitment to fitness has been evident as he worked with a weight and fitness specialist leading up to the draft. His goal of losing approximately 100 pounds was achieved through a disciplined diet that cut out sugar and starches, relying on peas, beans, chili, and spinach as key components of his meals.As the Buccaneers continue to strengthen their roster, Watson's signing marks a significant opportunity for him to prove himself. The team had already bolstered their edge rushing corps with two new signings in the 2025 draft but left room for a potential interior defensive lineman. With no other interior D-linemen drafted, Watson's chance to compete for a backup role behind Pro Bowler Vita Vea is very much alive.Desmond Watson's path to the NFL may have been unconventional, but his hard work, dedication, and Florida roots have given him the chance to shine at the highest level of football. Whether or not he secures a starting position, one thing is clear‚ÄîWatson‚Äôs journey is just beginning, and fans across Florida will be cheering him on every step of the way.Also Read: ""Clueless for 50 years"": ESPN‚Äôs Mel Kiper Jr. slams NFL teams for letting Shedeur Sanders slip to fifth round","Desmond watson, a 6-foot-5, 464-pound defensive tackle, is the heaviest player ever to join an nfl team.

When George Russell was Lewis Hamilton's teammate at Mercedes

George Russell and Lewis Hamilton were teammates at Mercedes until last year. But the times have changed drastically, as Hamilton has now switched to Ferrari , where he is yet to find his footing. Meanwhile, Russell is having a fantastic season and is just one position away from clinching his first win of the season, if McLaren misses the mark by chance. The roaring Mercedes driver has now said that if it was a different era, he would have already won two championships.George Russell was reflecting on his past years at Mercedes when Lewis Hamilton was leading the World Championship. He stresses that it‚Äôs not him who has changed, but the times. Russell was two positions ahead of Hamilton in the Driver Standings when he joined Mercedes in 2022, and once again left him behind in 2024 when Hamilton started losing his winning streak.Talking about his time with Hamilton, Russell told The Athletic, ‚ÄúEverybody is in Lewis‚Äôs shadow. Being teammates with a seven-time World Champion for three years is not straightforward. There was once a time that if you finished ahead of Lewis Hamilton in a championship or in a race, you‚Äôd win the race. Or, if you finished ahead of him in the championship, you‚Äôd win the championship. If my time was five years prior, you could argue I‚Äôd have two championships to my name.‚ÄùAt present, Russell is in 4th place, while Hamilton, who now drives for Ferrari, is way behind in 7th in the Driver Standings. Opening up about the same, Russell said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just going about my business, as I have been the last couple of years. I‚Äôm working with the same group of engineers, the same group of mechanics. Obviously, Lewis was such a large presence that you know that he‚Äôs not around.‚Äù‚ÄúBut on the day-to-day running of things, it is no different. I'm sat at my desk in front of my computer. I do my warm-up in my room, I jump in my race car, I put my helmet on. I want to control my own destiny first and foremost,"" he added.Also Read: George Russell: George Russell seen in super-rare $5.4 million Mercedes AMG One with Alex Albon in Monaco Russell has claimed three podiums in five races and is currently the only one, other than Red Bull‚Äôs Max Verstappen, giving McLaren a tough competition.

Seville: Barcelona defender Jules Kounde struck deep in extra-time to decide a gripping Copa del Rey Clasico final on Saturday in Seville, earning his side a 3-2 win over rivals Real Madrid .The Catalans, aiming for a quadruple this season, won the first major trophy of Hansi Flick's reign as coach and a record-extending 32nd Spanish cup in dramatic fashion.Three Real Madrid players were sent off during and after a fiery conclusion to the game, including England international Jude Bellingham.Pedri sent Barcelona ahead at La Cartuja but two Real Madrid goals in seven second-half minutes, from Kylian Mbappe and Aurelien Tchouameni, pulled the Spanish and European champions level.However, Ferran Torres struck in the 84th minute to take the game to extra-time and Kounde drilled home to win it for the La Liga leaders.""Madrid pushed us to our limits but we showed great character and pride,"" said Kounde.Barca host Inter Milan in the Champions League semi-finals on Wednesday.""They can make a party -- for today, it's OK,"" a delighted Flick, who has won all seven finals he has coached in his career, told Movistar.Substituted Madrid defender Antonio Rudiger was sent off in the final seconds for ""throwing an object"" onto the pitch towards referee Ricardo de Burgos Bengoetxea, according to the official's report, and Lucas Vazquez, also replaced, was dismissed for further protest as Madrid unravelled.Bellingham was sent off after the final whistle for showing an ""aggressive attitude"" towards the referee, who wrote that the midfielder ""had to be restrained by his team-mates"".""I don't want to talk about the referee,"" said stone-faced Madrid coach Ancelotti.""I don't know what happened at the end."" Madrid had issued furious statements about the refereeing team on Friday after they criticised the club's television channel for attacking Spanish officials this season, casting a shadow over the game.Controversy aside, the football was enthralling.Madrid started with top scorer Mbappe on the bench after an ankle injury and lost Ferland Mendy early on with a thigh issue.Barcelona dazzling winger Lamine Yamal, 17, dyed his hair blond for the game and led the assault on Thibaut Courtois' goal.The Catalans, who also won the first two Clasicos this season in La Liga and the Spanish Super Cup, scoring nine goals in the process, controlled the ball.They took the lead after 28 minutes, Pedri placing the ball into the top corner with precision and power from the edge of the box, a sensational goal set up by Yamal.Barcelona's opener brought Madrid out of their shell -- and also Mbappe off the bench to warm up.Bellingham netted but was offside. Vinicius Junior would have won a penalty when hacked down but had also strayed off in the build-up.Barcelona could have doubled their lead, with Dani Olmo's corner hitting the post and Cubarsi unable to turn home as Dani Ceballos held him back.The referee was lenient with some heated Madrid tackles, perhaps cowed by Friday's drama as the Spanish champions seethed at his pre-match comments.Madrid sent Mbappe on for Rodrygo Goes at half-time and soon he and Vinicius began to work Barcelona goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny.Mbappe pulled Madrid level almost on his own in the 70th minute, brought down after surging forward and firing home the free-kick off the post.Seven minutes later Madrid took the lead, Tchouameni heading in Arda Guler's corner.Barcelona responded when Yamal played a delicious pass over the top for Torres, which drew both Rudiger and Courtois, but the Spaniard beat both and rolled home.Controversy unsurprisingly reared its head before the match headed to extra-time.Barcelona clamoured for a penalty when Rudiger tripped Torres, and then were awarded one deep in stoppage time as Raphinha tumbled under pressure -- but the decision was overturned after a VAR review.In extra-time Barcelona were ascendent.They found their winner when Kounde intercepted an uncharacteristically loose Luka Modric pass and beat Courtois from range, sparking wild celebrations.The trio of dismissals and Madrid's pre-match histrionics regarding the officials will ensure the repercussions run on.The teams meet again in La Liga in May in a potential title decider.",Barcelona beat real madrid 3-2 in the copa del rey final in seville.

NEW DELHI: Mumbai Indians ' pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah added another feather to his illustrious cap on Sunday, becoming the leading wicket-taker for the franchise in Indian Premier League (IPL) history. In front of a buzzing Wankhede Stadium crowd, Bumrah achieved the milestone during MI‚Äôs clash against Lucknow Super Giants.Coming on as first change in just the third over, Bumrah dismissed South African batter Aiden Markram to claim his 171st wicket for Mumbai Indians in 139 matches.

Shah Rukh Khan: The superstar who turned IPL into a blockbuster

After their commanding victory over Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) at the Wankhede Stadium, Mumbai Indians captain Hardik Pandya made a noteworthy revelation about his limited bowling contribution on Sunday, having bowled only one over on Sunday.Hardik bowled the ninth over of the match. He was greeted by LSG opener Mitchell Marsh with consecutive boundaries but recovered strongly, conceding just two singles in his subsequent four deliveries.At the post-match presentation ceremony, when questioned about bowling only one over, the Mumbai Indians skipper replied, ""I bowl when I am required.""Hardik then elaborated on his decision to hold back and provide debutant Corbin Bosch with the opportunity to complete his quota of overs. The South African all-rounder had an excellent debut, smashing a quick-fire 20 off 10 balls and delivering an economical bowling spell of 1 for 26 in his four overs.""Today was the best chance for Bosch to come in and bowl,"" he stated.It was indeed a clinical performance by the five-time champions, Mumbai Indians. Jasprit Bumrah 's exceptional figures of 4 for 22 and Trent Boult 's 3 for 20 followed attacking half-centuries from Ryan Rickelton and Suryakumar Yadav , propelling Mumbai Indians to a 54-run victory over Lucknow Super Giants for their fifth successive win.After Rickelton (58) and Suryakumar Yadav (54) helped MI post a formidable 215 for 7 after being asked to bat first, Bumrah and Boult spearheaded a brilliant bowling performance as LSG were bundled out for 161 in 20 overs.Bumrah weaved his magic in the death overs, claiming three wickets in one eventful over as Mumbai Indians defeated LSG for the first time at the Wankhede Stadium.Bumrah also achieved a significant milestone, becoming the highest wicket-taker for Mumbai Indians in IPL history with 174 wickets, surpassing Lasith Malinga's 170.Boult was equally impressive. Utilized in short spells, he struck every time he was brought into the attack, wrapping up the innings by dismissing Digvesh Rathi on the last ball of the match.This victory marks the first win for Mumbai Indians over LSG in the league phase, coming in their seventh encounter.With this win, MI climbed to the second spot in the standings, trailing Gujarat Titans and joining Delhi Capitals and Royal Challengers Bengaluru on 12 points.

NEW DELHI: Lucknow Super Giants ‚Äô fast bowler Mayank Yadav made a rousing return to competitive cricket, striking in style by dismissing Rohit Sharma in their IPL clash against Mumbai Indians at the Wankhede Stadium on Sunday.Returning after a long injury layoff, Mayank was handed the new ball by skipper Rishabh Pant and showed no signs of rust. His first over, bowled to Ryan Rickelton, featured four deliveries clocking over 140 kmph.

After Rohit Sharma smashed him for back-to-back sixes ‚Äî a deep square hit followed by a signature pull over square leg ‚Äî the young pacer responded brilliantly. Regaining his composure, Mayank delivered a slower short ball that Rohit steered straight to Prince Yadav at short third man, falling for 12 off five balls.Mayank‚Äôs comeback is significant, given his injury struggles ‚Äî including five stress fractures and a recent toe injury that delayed his return after joining LSG on April 16.
