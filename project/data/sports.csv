Aaron Rodgers may prioritize retirement over return without Super Bowl opportunity



Could Rodgers RETIRE instead of picking Steelers?

Aaron Rodgers continues to keep the NFL world in suspense as the 2025 season looms. The four-time MVP and Super Bowl XLV champion hasn’t confirmed whether he plans to lace up his cleats again—but what’s increasingly evident is that Aaron Rodgers isn’t coming back just to fill a roster spot. According to CBS Sports, the 41-year-old quarterback is more likely to retire than return to a team that doesn’t offer a realistic shot at winning it all.Aaron Rodgers' future remains one of the league’s biggest unanswered questions. After a rocky stint with the New York Jets marred by injuries and inconsistent performances, the legendary quarterback has kept fans and franchises guessing. He has visited potential suitors like the Pittsburgh Steelers, who remain the most visibly interested team, but no official decision has been made. Adding to the intrigue, Rodgers has also been linked to the New York Giants and the Seattle Seahawks—both of whom have since committed to other quarterbacks in Russell Wilson and Sam Darnold.For Aaron Rodgers, it’s no longer about adding more numbers to an already Hall of Fame-worthy résumé. CBS reporter Aditi Kinkhabwala reported that he is “intellectually stimulated by more than football” and emphasized, ""It’s extremely clear Rodgers is not going to play just for the sake of playing."" That sentiment has only intensified the sense that unless a team with a clear path to the Lombardi Trophy steps forward, Rodgers may be ready to walk away from the game.The Steelers' interest is understandable. Pittsburgh has released both Russell Wilson and Justin Fields, leaving them with Mason Rudolph as their only signed quarterback after his two-year, $8 million return deal. While Rudolph offers reliability, he is still largely viewed as a backup option, which explains why the Steelers are aggressively scouting for a starting-caliber signal-caller.Despite their strong culture and consistent winning seasons under head coach Mike Tomlin, the Steelers haven’t been past the Wild Card round since 2016. Their last Super Bowl appearance came in 2010—ironically, against Rodgers and the Packers. This offseason, they’ve made some bold moves to improve their offense, including a trade for DK Metcalf, signaling that the organization is aiming for more than just a playoff berth.But does Rodgers believe that Pittsburgh is truly built to win now? According to NFL insider Josina Anderson, someone within the Steelers organization described the vibe surrounding Rodgers as “a little weird,” suggesting that there might be more complexity to these talks than meets the eye.At 41, Rodgers is just one season removed from a serious Achilles injury. His 2024 performance with the Jets was far from inspiring—his team went 5-12, and he finished 28th in QBR, even behind rookie Aidan O’Connell. Despite having talented offensive weapons like Garrett Wilson, Davante Adams, and Breece Hall, the Jets struggled to compete, particularly in the highly competitive AFC East.Gone are the days when Rodgers’ mere presence could instantly elevate a team into Super Bowl contention. With his physical prime behind him and his legacy secured—10 Pro Bowl nods, four MVPs, one Super Bowl title, and over 4,000 passing yards in 10 seasons—Rodgers seems unwilling to endure another campaign that ends in mediocrity.Whether he ultimately joins the Steelers or retires, one thing is becoming increasingly clear: Aaron Rodgers is not interested in playing unless it’s with a team capable of winning it all. The ball is now in the NFL’s court.Also Read: Is Taylor Swift too ‘white bread’ for Coachella’s cool crowd?

Lifelong Raiders fan Ice Cube shares who he believes can save the team,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/lifelong-raiders-fan-ice-cube-shares-who-he-believes-can-save-the-team/articleshow/120379008.cms,"Ice Cube, a devoted Raiders fan, reveals his preferred pick for the team’s upcoming draft. (Credit: Getty Images)

West Coast legend Ice Cube wants Raiders to take this rising star in the draft



The connection between the Las Vegas Raiders and legendary rapper Ice Cube has always run deep. From the streets of Compton with N.W.A to the stands of the Coliseum, Ice Cube has long been a vocal ambassador of Raider Nation. And even though the franchise has since moved from Los Angeles to Las Vegas, Cube’s loyalty to the Silver and Black remains unshakable.Now, as the 2025 NFL Draft approaches, the iconic artist and BIG3 founder has made his pick clear—he wants Shedeur Sanders in Silver and Black.“Of course!” Ice Cube responded when asked if the Raiders should use their sixth overall pick on Sanders. “I think his pedigree— you can't dismiss that. He's seen how to do it on the professional level for a very long time... Has a great, amazing coach [and father] in Hall of Famer Deion Sanders. ... If he's there I think the Raiders should take him.”There’s more to Cube’s enthusiasm than celebrity excitement. Shedeur, the son of Hall of Famer Deion Sanders, brings not only impressive stats but a football IQ nurtured from childhood. With the pressure and attention that comes from being “Prime Time’s” son, Shedeur has grown into a confident, composed leader—traits that may align well with Pete Carroll’s vision for the Raiders.Still, Cube’s not blind to the team’s broader needs. “They've gotta still deal with some great quarterbacks in the AFC West, so we gotta make sure we can stop somebody,” Cube noted. “Cause scoring ain't the only thing, we've got some great quarterbacks out here.”Indeed, while the Raiders have struggled on both sides of the ball, defensive consistency has been elusive in recent seasons. Cube’s remarks underline the importance of balance—a sentiment likely shared in the Raiders’ front office.As it stands, many mock drafts suggest the Raiders may lean toward Boise State’s Ashton Jeanty at No. 6, addressing depth and explosiveness in the backfield. However, the prospect of pairing Pete Carroll with Shedeur Sanders might prove too tempting to ignore, especially with quarterback Geno Smith already on the roster.Smith, who reunited with Carroll after a trade from Seattle this offseason, is expected to start. Yet at 35 years old, he may not be the long-term solution. Sanders could step in as an heir apparent, learning under a seasoned vet while adapting to the pro game.Even if the Raiders don’t select Sanders, sources suggest a young quarterback will still be brought in to develop behind Smith and challenge Aidan O’Connell for the backup role. But if Shedeur falls out of the top three and into Vegas’ lap, Ice Cube—and perhaps the Raider faithful—might just get their wish.Also Read: When is the 2025 NFL schedule dropping?

Is Taylor Swift too mainstream for Coachella’s indie vibe?

When it comes to music festivals like Coachella, image matters just as much as the music. It’s not just about who performs—it’s about who belongs. So when Taylor Swift is rumored to make an appearance or even perform, one question keeps popping up: is Taylor Swift too “white bread” for Coachella’s trend-setting, genre-bending scene?On paper, Taylor Swift has the résumé to own any stage. With record-breaking albums, a sold-out Eras Tour, and a massive global fanbase, she’s arguably the biggest pop star on the planet. But Coachella is more than just a concert—it’s a cultural moment, curated for cool. It’s where edgy, experimental, and often underground artists get their shine. It’s where alternative fashion reigns and mainstream pop can sometimes feel… out of place.So why the “white bread” label? It stems from the perception that Taylor’s music—despite its evolution—is still rooted in polished, safe storytelling. While she’s dabbled in indie folk with Folklore and Evermore, and even worked with edgy producers like Jack Antonoff and Aaron Dessner, some still see her as the girl-next-door in a world full of rebellious misfits.Yet that assumption overlooks her savvy reinventions. Taylor has consistently pushed boundaries in her own way—whether it’s re-recording her masters to reclaim her artistry, calling out industry sexism, or subtly weaving political themes into her music. She’s clean-cut, yes, but not without edge. Maybe she’s not flipping off the crowd in a studded leather jacket—but she’s rewriting the rules in a sparkly bodysuit, and doing it on her own terms.The reality is, Coachella has changed too. The lineup now spans everything from reggaeton and K-pop to hip-hop and house. The festival has become a melting pot of genres and identities. If Blink-182, Billie Eilish, and Bad Bunny can all share the same stage, why not Taylor?Also Read: Did Taylor Swift skip Coachella 2025 to avoid being upstaged by other stars? Fans question her absence amid rising speculation Whether she ever headlines or just shows up to support friends (like boyfriend Travis Kelce or producer pals), her presence sparks conversation. And maybe that’s the point. Because if Taylor Swift isn’t Coachella enough—then maybe it’s time to ask what Coachella really stands for in 2025.After all, being too “white bread” might just be the boldest thing you can be in a world obsessed with crust.","Is taylor swift too mainstream for coachella’s indie vibe?

Tua Tagovailoa backstabbing Jalen Hurts as the Dolphins try to rip DeVonta Smith from the Eagles,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/tua-tagovailoa-backstabbing-jalen-hurts-as-the-dolphins-try-to-rip-devonta-smith-from-the-eagles/articleshow/120365095.cms,"The Miami Dolphins are reportedly negotiating a trade for DeVonta Smith, a player they are considering to acquire from the Eagles, amid ongoing controversy between Tua Tagovailoa and Jalen Hurts (Image via AP)

Dolphins sign tight end Jack Stoll, a former Jalen Hurts teammate

There’s a lot of chatter around Tua Tagovailoa and Jalen Hurts again, but this time it’s not about college drama, it's about a strategic NFL move. The Miami Dolphins recently signed tight end Jack Stoll , a former teammate of Jalen Hurts from the Philadelphia Eagles . Media outlets are framing it like Tua is ""stealing a gem"" from Hurts, fueling another round of comparisons between the two quarterbacks.Jack Stoll spent four years with the Eagles and was known more for his blocking than receiving; he only had 20 catches for 183 yards and no touchdowns in that time. Still, he was a reliable and familiar presence for Hurts, especially in two tight end sets. The Dolphins saw potential in him, especially as they continue to build depth behind their starters.This move adds to the ongoing narrative that’s followed Tua and Jalen since their Alabama days, when Tua famously replaced Hurts in the 2018 national championship game. Despite the competition, both quarterbacks have expressed mutual respect and have even stayed in touch, occasionally sharing tips and insights about opponents in the league.So, while the media’s spinning this as another Tua-vs-Hurts rivalry, it’s really more of a typical NFL roster move. Jack Stoll, the tight end in question, wasn’t a headline-maker in Philadelphia, but he brought consistency and chemistry with Hurts from their shared time on the field. Now, with the Dolphins picking him up, the narrative is being painted as if Tua is taking something valuable from Jalen.The NFL offseason heats up as reports from ESPN reveal the Miami Dolphins are looking to trade star cornerback Jalen Ramsey. Despite strong performances over two seasons, GM Chris Grier confirmed the team is exploring options to move on from the All-Pro defender.ESPN has proposed a bold trade: the Dolphins would send Jalen Ramsey, the 13th overall pick, and a 2026 second-rounder to the Eagles for star receiver DeVonta Smith and the 32nd pick. While Philly could benefit from Ramsey’s veteran presence on a rebuilding defense, parting with Smith won't be easy. Still, with A.J. Brown leading their receiving corps, the Eagles might consider the move.Also Read: “Tom Brady is like a scrub”: Tom Brady criticized for ignoring Gisele Bündchen’s dating past with DiCaprio, says Pearl Davis in fiery rant If the trade goes through, it could reshape both teams, boosting Miami’s offense with a dynamic weapon for Tua Tagovailoa and strengthening Philly’s defense with a seasoned star.

Auston Matthews, Mitch Marner and team chemistry drive results



With a dominating 4-0 win over the Buffalo Sabres , the Toronto Maple Leafs not only secured their inaugural Atlantic Division title , but also delivered a clear message: this is a different team. Guided by head coach Craig Berube and super-ace Auston Matthews , who scored his 400th goal in his NHL career, the Maple Leafs are changing gears to end years of playoff despair on a more even and defense-focused note.With one game remaining in the regular season, the Toronto Maple Leafs (51-26-4) have already set their franchise record for most road victories (25) and secured the second seed in the Eastern Conference. But it's not merely the statistics—it's the story. Under Craig Berube, Toronto is finally balancing offensive punch with defensive toughness, a combination they believe will take them deep into the Stanley Cup Playoffs .Craig Berube, who infamously led the St. Louis Blues to a Stanley Cup championship in 2019, has quickly instilled a winning culture and tactical accountability into the Toronto Maple Leafs' locker room. And that is manifesting on the ice. In their last 15 games, Toronto was 12-2-1, including an eight-game winning streak where they beat opponents 28-12. The team's defensive responsibility has been an eye-opener.The team’s buy-in has been central to Berube’s strategy. “You’re always trying to work on your identity. And that hasn’t stopped throughout the season,” he stated. “I think our guys have done a good job of it. I think we’re in a good spot, but we’ve got to keep making sure we’re pounding away at it and keep working on it and be ready to go.”“I think we’re prepared,” said Auston Matthews, the 2016 NHL Draft’s No. 1 overall pick. “Obviously, we can’t change what’s happened in the past. I think you wear that. So I feel really confident in this group. I think we put in a lot of work over the season. Obviously, earning the division [title] here is a big step for us. But we just want to continue to push forward.”Steven Lorentz, a Stanley Cup champion last year with the Florida Panthers, said, “The whole season’s a learning curve, especially with a new coach coming in, new systems. It’s different from the style of play that this team’s played with in previous seasons.”Auston Matthews is not the only one making personal history. Forward Mitch Marner recorded his first 100-point season, further establishing that the Maple Leafs have not lost offense for structure. Toronto's 263 goals place them again in the NHL's top 10 in scoring—making their ninth straight year in that group.But where this Maple Leafs team stands out is in their defensive improvement. With just 226 goals conceded, they rank 10th league-wide in goals against, a significant leap from previous seasons.Toronto now shifts attention to the first-round playoff series against the Ottawa Senators—again igniting the legendary ‘ Battle of Ontario ’.Also read: Craig Berube’s lighthearted take on the Toronto Maple Leafs’ defensive Crisis vs. the Montreal Canadiens With the playoffs on the horizon, critics and fans alike will be closely observing to determine if this revamped Toronto Maple Leafs team can once and for all put their playoff ghosts behind them.

NEW DELHI: Fresh off one of the standout performances of IPL 2025 , Punjab Kings leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal showed his cheeky side on social media, taking a playful dig at teammate Nehal Wadhera by calling him a ""mistri spinner"", which was a humorous twist on the term mystery spinner.The nickname came after Wadhera attempted his version of spin bowling in a practice session, prompting Chahal to jokingly question his technique.The banter came just a day after Chahal delivered a match-winning spell against Kolkata Knight Riders , picking up 4/28 and helping PBKS pull off a stunning 16-run win while defending just 111 runs, one of the lowest totals defended in IPL history.With this performance, Chahal equalled Sunil Narine ’s record for the most four-wicket hauls in IPL (8) and became the bowler with the most four-fors against a single team, achieving his third such haul against KKR.His wickets included key scalps like Ajinkya Rahane, Rinku Singh, and Angkrish Raghuvanshi, causing KKR to collapse from a comfortable 62/2 to 95 all out.Chahal's milestone-rich evening didn’t end there.He also moved to 370 T20 wickets, surpassing Mohammad Nabi and Mohammad Amir to claim 11th spot on the all-time T20 wicket-takers list. He’s now India’s top T20 wicket-taker.Despite PBKS’s low total, KKR couldn't capitalise, thanks largely to Chahal and Marco Jansen’s 3/17.The Punjab bowlers held their nerve, with support from Harpreet Brar and Arshdeep Singh , as KKR were bundled out in just 15.1 overs.","Punjab kings leg-spinner yuzvendra chahal took a playful dig at teammate nehal wadhera by calling him a ""mistri spinner"", which was a humorous twist on the term mystery spinner.

Poll Is it time for Rohit Sharma to retire from IPL? Maybe, it depends on his next performances. No, he deserves another chance. Yes, he should retire now.

NEW DELHI: Rohit Sharma 's scores in the ongoing Indian Premier League season read: 0, 8, 13, 17, 18, and 28. The Mumbai Indians stalwart, who has led the franchise to five IPL titles, is currently enduring a rough patch with the bat.On Thursday, skipper Hardik Pandya brought Rohit in as an Impact Player against Sunrisers Hyderabad , but the veteran batter’s struggles continued. He managed just 26 runs before being dismissed by Pat Cummins.In six innings so far, Rohit has scored only 82 runs at a disappointing average of 13.66.His lean run has drawn sharp criticism from former India opener Virender Sehwag , who didn’t mince words. Sehwag cautioned Rohit about protecting his legacy and even suggested that it might be time for him to consider stepping away from the format.“If you look at Rohit's IPL numbers in the last 10 years, he scored more than 400 runs only once. So he is not the kind of player who thinks that I need to score 500 or 700 runs. If he thinks, he might. When he became the Indian captain, he said that he wanted to be the player who wants to cash in on the powerplay and take the chances, so he wanted to make all the sacrifices alone, but he is not considering the fact that at the end of the day when he is not performing, it is your legacy that is getting hurt,"" Sehwag told Cricbuzz.""Ab uska jaane ka time aa gaya, (It's already time for him to retire), and before retiring, you would want to give fans something to remember you by, and not moments that force them to think, why are they not dropping him,” he said.“Take 10 balls extra, but at least play and give yourself a chance. He has been getting out to that pull shot many times against the back of the length deliveries. So he should decide that in one innings he will not play the pull shot at all. But who will explain it to him? There should be someone telling him to play normal cricket. When I was there, Sachin, Dravid or Ganguly used to tell me to play normal cricket,” he added.A disciplined performance from the bowling unit, spearheaded by Jasprit Bumrah and captain Hardik Pandya, powered Mumbai Indians to a four-wicket win over Sunrisers Hyderabad in a low-scoring clash at the Wankhede Stadium.Will Jacks emerged as the standout performer for Mumbai, picking up two key wickets and contributing a crucial 36 with the bat to steer the team to their second consecutive victory in IPL 2025 .This marked Mumbai Indians’ third win of the season, taking their tally to six points and lifting them to seventh place in the standings—breaking free from the congestion of teams stuck at four points near the bottom.

From gridiron greatness to emotional vulnerability



When public image collides with private battles



Even the most successful athletes face challenges that stats and accolades can’t capture—and Tom Brady is no exception. Widely regarded as the greatest quarterback in NFL history , Brady's legendary career boasts an unmatched seven Super Bowl titles, yet behind the shine of championship rings lies a more vulnerable, human side he’s beginning to share with the world.For two decades, Tom Brady maintained a laser focus on football, becoming the ultimate symbol of discipline and competitive excellence. But recently, the 46-year-old has revealed glimpses of his personal struggles, particularly in the wake of his divorce from supermodel Gisele Bündchen . Brady, who is usually tight-lipped about his private life, opened up about the emotional toll of navigating heartbreak, admitting he’s dealt with moments of “willful blindness.”This phrase—suggesting a conscious decision to ignore uncomfortable truths—points to the complexities Brady faced in his marriage’s unraveling. While he didn’t name names, the context was unmistakable, especially given recent headlines surrounding Bündchen's ongoing relationship with her jiu-jitsu trainer, who is now widely rumored to be her partner and the father figure in her children’s lives.“Willful blindness” is not just a phrase—it’s a powerful acknowledgment of emotional compromise. Brady’s reflection reveals the cost of chasing perfection on the field while personal issues simmer in the background. The quarterback, once seemingly invincible both in his career and family life, now speaks like someone reckoning with the pain of being left behind. For fans, it’s a rare and raw admission: the GOAT is still just a man.The emotional fallout of watching Bündchen move on publicly is undoubtedly difficult for someone so accustomed to control and success. Reports of her being seen with her new partner and children add emotional weight to Brady’s recent comments, suggesting a sense of betrayal or at least loss.Also Read: Fresh discussion on Tom Brady and Gisele’s Bündchen’s marriage reignites debate over missed red flags Brady’s recent openness signals a shift—not just for him but for the culture surrounding sports icons.

Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) spinner Varun Chakravarthy has raised questions over a controversial ""no-ball"" call during the Mumbai Indians vs Sunrisers Hyderabad match at the Wankhede Stadium on Thursday.In the seventh over of the match, Mumbai Indians opener Ryan Rickelton was dismissed by leg-spinner Zeeshan Ansari, with Pat Cummins taking an easy catch at cover.However, the drama unfolded when the fourth umpire stopped Rickelton near the boundary rope, and the delivery was called a no-ball.The third umpire found that wicketkeeper Heinrich Klaasen had his gloves in front of the stumps when the ball made contact with the bat. Rickelton received a free-hit, but he failed to capitalize on it.The third umpire's decision was not appreciated by Varun Chakravarthy.""If the keeper's gloves come in front of the stumps, it should be a dead ball and a warning to the keeper so that he doesn't do that again!!! Not a no-ball and a free hit!! What did the bowler do? Thinking out loud!!

has successfully defended his lightweight title against fighters like Alexander Volkanovski, Dustin Poirier, and Renato Moicano. His last bout was a submission win against Moicano, and has made no announcement since then regarding his next bout. While former featherweight championmoved up a weight class and has been constantly calling out Makhachev, there has been no positive response from the latter. While fighters from the division and Makhachev’s team explained the reason,joined the line to explain the non-responsiveness of the fighter. In a recent episode of the Jaxxon Podcast, the fighter talked about why no one is willing to fight him as well as the reason behind Makhachev ducking Topuria’s proposal.With an MMA record of 22-3-0, Arman Tsarukyan has not held a title as of yet. His last bout was a split decision win against Charles Oliveira at UFC 300 on April 14, 2024. Since then, the fighter has been away from the Octagon and has not been paired up for a bout yet. When asked why the contenders of the division have been ducking him, the fighter replied, “Right now, because it’s a dangerous fight and I don’t have a title. And so Oliveira wants to fight for the title, and Topuria wants to fight for the title. Everybody wants to fight for the title. And when they are gonna book the title fight and then I am gonna get the fight.”Tsarukyan was further asked if he was sure to get a title fight. The fighter had a rather straight answer, “Depends. If Islam is going to move to 170, they got to give me the interim title with somebody.”The reply stemmed from the rumours of current lightweight champion Islam Makhachev moving up to either the welterweight or middleweight division. Tsarukyan had a rather different take regarding this. He went on to state that a move up for Makhachev is possible only after he beats Tsarukyan in a lightweight bout.“If Islam beats me, I think he is done with this division. He beat everybody. Just he is got to beat me and people can say that.”The fighter even defended Makhachev not accepting a title bout proposal from the former featherweight champion Ilia Topuria.“Islam doesn’t wanna fight him because if he wins, people are gonna say ‘Okay you again beat 145 fighters and he is not number one contender’”Also read: Seth Rollins proposes UFC CEO Dana White for an Octagon bout with rival CM Punk - “Dana, you want to make some money, book it” Makhachev has previously fought and won against Tsarukyan at UFC Fight Night on April 20, 2019.

Aaron Rodgers keeps NFL World guessing as 2025 Season nears



Aaron Rodgers continues to make headlines — not with touchdowns this time, but with his deliberate silence. The free-agent quarterback, a four-time NFL MVP and future Hall of Famer, is keeping everyone in suspense about his future as the 2025 NFL Draft approaches. Appearing on The Pat McAfee Show for the first time since January, Rodgers offered little clarity, instead dropping cryptic but philosophical hints. “I’m open to anything,” he said, “and attached to nothing.”Now 41 and still recovering from the emotional and physical toll of the past year, Aaron Rodgers made it clear that football is no longer his sole focus. While retirement is certainly on the table, he's also left the door wide open for a potential return — possibly even with the Pittsburgh Steelers .Rodgers revealed that ""personal matters"" have taken priority in recent months. “I have a couple people in my inner, inner circle who are battling some difficult stuff,” he shared. “To make a commitment to a team is a big thing, whether you are a first-year player or 20-year vet.” The quarterback is currently in a serious relationship, which he subtly alluded to as another reason he's taking time before making any major decisions.The Steelers have emerged as the most intriguing landing spot. Rodgers quietly visited Pittsburgh’s facility on March 21 and later worked out with their newly acquired wideout DK Metcalf at UCLA. “I wanted to do due diligence with this whole process. Part of it is talking to a guy like DK,” he explained. “Let me just say this, what a great dude. What a great dude. He loves football. What a specimen this guy is.”Pittsburgh, with only Mason Rudolph and Skylar Thompson under center, could clearly benefit from a veteran presence. Yet Rodgers insists he hasn't been pressured by the organization. “This entire time I haven’t felt like I owed anybody some sort of decision at any point,” he noted, adding that he’s been transparent with head coach Mike Tomlin throughout. “I've talked to Mike many times.”Interestingly, Rodgers also mentioned conversations with other teams, including the New York Giants and Minnesota Vikings. But for him, financial demands are irrelevant. “I told every single one of the teams that I was talking to that it ain’t about the money. I’ll play for ($10 million per season). I don’t care,” he said. “I never once said I need a multi-year deal or $30 or $40 million is actual b------. I said, I’ll play for 10.”Despite criticism that he’s been ambiguous or indecisive, Rodgers rejected the idea that he misled teams. “I told them in March in the beginning, and you could ask any team that I talked to, that was the conversation,” he affirmed. His primary loyalty right now remains with those closest to him, and he made sure potential suitors understood that from the start.While he hasn’t ruled out returning to the gridiron, one thing is certain: his chapter with the New York Jets is closed. He recounted a particularly awkward meeting with new Jets leadership that left a bitter taste. “I was kind of shocked,” Rodgers said of the brief encounter. “Not shocked because I didn’t think that was a possibility... But shocked because I just flew across the country, and you could have told me this on the phone.”Throughout the conversation, Rodgers came across as someone at peace — contemplative, measured, and in no rush. Whether he suits up again or not, he seems determined to follow his own timeline and protect his inner circle. “I am trying to be open to everything and not being attached to anything,” he concluded.For now, the NFL world waits.
