Johnny Manziel defends Cam Newton with savage clapback amid Jalen Hurts media drama targeting Eagles superfan



Newton and Manziel: Heads of the underdog empire



Former Heisman Trophy winner Johnny Manziel has once again taken to social media to defend a fellow football icon—and this time, his fiery words were aimed at Philadelphia Eagles superfan King Gillie. The controversy erupted after a viral video showed Gillie taunting Cam Newton for never winning a Super Bowl, a jab that didn’t sit well with Manziel, who wasted no time clapping back.During his birthday celebration, King Gillie—known for his passionate Eagles support—was seen holding the Vince Lombardi Trophy and mocking Newton’s NFL résumé. “Cam ain’t never had one of these, and I ain’t going back and forth with you,” he said into the mic. “Thank you Jalen. Appreciate you Jalen. Love you Nick. Appreciate you Jalen. Cam Newton never had one of these.”The clip, shared by the parody “Shannon Sharpes Burner” account on X, quickly made the rounds, drawing attention not only for the statement but for its timing. Less than 24 hours later, Johnny Manziel unleashed a scathing response on the platform.“Yo King Gillie you may be the biggest f-cking loser on the planet.Talking like you’ve f-cking done anything on a football field. If I see you just know I’m going to slap the f-ck out of you, trust,” Manziel posted.Manziel’s outrage wasn’t just about football accolades—it was personal. Newton had appeared just the day before on Manziel’s new podcast Glory Daze, where both men reflected on their shared past as underdog icons in college football.In the podcast episode, Newton delved into what made their college football journeys so powerful and similar. “When you think about Texas A&M and you think about Texas, who’s the superior team? Texas. Right? When you think about Auburn and you think about Alabama, who’s the superior team? Alabama. We were the heads of the underdogs.”Both Newton and Manziel etched their names into college football history—Newton in 2010 with Auburn and Manziel in 2012 with Texas A&M. Though Newton’s NFL career included a league MVP award and a Super Bowl appearance, the mutual respect between the two remains rooted in their college dominance, not just professional achievements.Manziel’s defense of Newton wasn’t just about a friend—it was about legacy, respect, and reminding fans that greatness isn’t always measured by trophies.Also Read: Jayden Daniels does not care much what people say, he is still a 'Momma's boy': “She’s a mom first""","Former heisman trophy winner johnny manziel has taken to social media to defend a fellow football icon.

Held at the MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey, Night 2 saw quite a few celebrities attending the event alongside the fans, including NBA superstar Tyler Haliburton. Night 1 saw an audience of 53,161 and Night 2 didn't disappoint either, as an audience of 60,561 was inside the arena.Night 2 also has six matches set for the night, just like Night 1. And fans were going absolutely wild cheering for their favorite wrestlers all throughout the event. The 38th SummerSlam has been chaotic, fun, surprising, and so much more. And as we close the big summer event of WWE , let's take a look at all the winners and top performers of the night.The opening match of Night 2 was a triple-threat fight featuring Naomi vs. IYO SKY vs. Rhea Ripley . Naomi initially wanted the other two to fight it out among themselves before she came in, but Ripley and Sky made an unspoken alliance to take on their opponent first. Naomi was like a beast as she put both Mami and the Japanese superstar through the pages. And though it seemed like things were making a turn, Naomi stacks Ripley for a pin to take the win.This match was always going to be the biggest chaos of the night, and it didn't disappoint. Wyatt Sicks - the reigning tag team champions faced 5 other tag teams. #DIY, Street Profits, Fraxiom, Motor City Machine Guns, and the duo of Andrade & Rey Fenix. The TLC match started with all 5 teams attacking the Wyatt Sicks' Dexter Lumis & Joe Gacy. But before long, it was every team for themselves. And at long last, the Wyatt 6 won by retrieving the title belts and retaining their WWE Tag Team Championship.The third match-up of the night was Becky Lynch vs. Lyra Valkyria for the WWE Women's Intercontinental Championship title. Both women put on power-packed performances, and their third wheel, Bayley, also made a surprise entry. Though she wanted to help Valkyria win against Lynch, Bayley ended up becoming the reason for Lynch retaining the title, when a punch directed at Lynch ended up knocking Valkyria out.The fourth match of Night 2 was for the WWE United States Championship, featuring Solo Sikoa vs. Jacob Fatu . These two have had quite a few face-offs since Fatu decided to break away from Solo Sikoa's faction. And tonight they were on for a brutal Steel Cage fight. Jimmy Uso, who has been helping Fatu out recently also showed up tonight, as did The MFT. And finally, Tala Tonga kicked the cage door into Fatu, allowing Sikoa to fall out of it, and retaining his title belt.Dominik Mysterio vs. AJ Styles has been a long time coming, but because Mysterio was missing in action for quite a while due to his injury, it had to be postponed until now. Styles started by smacking Mysterio around, who responded in kind by raining stomps. Mysterio finally hits Styles with the boot and a Frog Splash for the pin and win. Dominik Mysterio is still the WWE Intercontinental Champion. John Cena vs. Cody Rhodes returns for a Street Fight at SummerSlam, and fans have been waiting for this for months. For the sixth time, Cena has returned to main event SummerSlam - which is also his last SummerSlam, this time facing The American Nightmare. In one of the most wholesome moments in Cena's Farewell tour, the fight ended after Rhodes saluted his hero and hit him with a Cross Rhodes to take the win.But it wouldn't be WWE if they didn't have a surprise at the end. And just when it seemed like the night would end on a good note, with the crowd cheering for John Cena, even though he lost, none other than Brock Lesnar showed up. His return has been discussed since last year, and with his return now, to confront Cena, it seems like an old rivalry is getting new flames before it comes to an end.Also Read: WWE SummerSlam 2025 (August 3, 2025) Results: Cody Rhodes defeats GOAT John Cena in brutal Street Fight to win back Undisputed Champion title","The wwe summerslam 2025 event was staged as a two-night show for the first time in its entire history.

With Cardi B hosting the big event, it started off with a bang. And now let's take a look at all the winners and top performers of the night.The opening match of the night was a tag team match between Roman Reigns and Jey Uso , who faced off against Bron Breakker and Bronson Reed. All hell broke loose from the very beginning, as the four opponents were at each other's throats as soon as the bell rang. Reigns missed a chunk of the action at the beginning, before he finally got tagged in. The match ran for over 21 minutes, with Reigns and Uso emerging as the winners.Raquel Rodriguez and Roxanne Perez vs. Charlotte Flair and Alexa Bliss was going to be an explosion of power-packed performance from the very beginning. Bliss and Flair were always the crowd favorite with their reluctant partnership act, and though the Judgment Day duo had a lot of power in them, it wasn't enough to overcome the veterans. The match ended with Charlotte Flair and Alexa Bliss becoming the new WWE Women's Tag Team champions.The first singles match of the night saw Sami Zayn and Karrion Kross come up against each other once again. The tides kept shifting from one side to another for the whole time. And of course, it wouldn't be complete without Scarlett trying to interfere for her partner, this time with a steel pipe, and then distracting the referee. But in this match-up, Zayn managed to take the win over Kross once again after a Helluva Kick to his opponent. Tiffany Stratton vs. Jade Cargill was the shortest match of the night, running for just a little over seven minutes. But both women kept the momentum of the night going with their powerful performances. The current Queen of the Ring challenged Stratton for her title belt, who has yet to lose a match this year. And Stratton showed Cargill why she is the reigning champion, as she managed to retain her belt after yet another title defense.This fight began even before the bell rang, when Logan Paul punched Jelly Roll, leading to a heated exchange between all four wrestlers. The fight was heated, with each one of them trying to gain the upper hand. Roll was almost led off the stage by officials after a splash by Paul turned way too much for the celebrity wrestler. But he came in to help his partner, Randy Orton . Unfortunately, it didn't work for long, and a Claymore Kick from Drew McIntyre and a Fall From Grace frogsplash from Paul, the match ended with Roll taking the pin.The main event of SummerSlam Night 1 saw CM Punk and GUNTHER come face to face for the third title match of the night. With the World Heavyweight Championship title on the line, GUNTHER was not going to have Punk take it away from him that easily. The match continued for more than 30 minutes before CM Punk finally emerged as the winner and the new World Heavyweight Champion of WWE.His emotions after getting the title belt and the tears spoke more than any words could. But the night is yet to end, as Seth Rollins walks in with Paul Heyman, who still has his Money in the Bank briefcase. But Rollins is injured, right? Well, not anymore, as he rushes in after throwing away his crutches and taking off his leg brace, and finally cashes in his MITB briefcase.It was too easy to pin an exhausted Punk, and ladies and gentlemen, Seth Rollins is now the newest World Heavyweight Champion of WWE. The Ruse of the Century indeed. Paul Heyman looks ecstatic, and that's curtains for Night 1 of SummerSlam 2025.Also Read: WWE SummerSlam 2025 (August 02, 2025) Results: Seth Rollins destroys CM Punk's dreams pulling huge ruse to win the World title","Night 1 of wwe summerslam 2025, held at the metlife stadium in east rutherford, new jersey saw an electric crowd.

Seth Rollins took away CM Punk's moment of glory at WWE SummerSlam 2025

The Best in the World, CM Punk returned to WWE SummerSlam for the second time since making his return to WWE in 2023. He fought against the dominant Ring General, Gunther, with the World Heavyweight Championship on the line. The epic main event showdown was a sight to witness at the first-ever two-night SummerSlam event. However, as the dust settled on SummerSlam, it was the ultimate heist pulled by his arch-rival, Seth Rollins , who arrived and took away all of Punk's dreams at the Biggest Party of the Summer.CM Punk and Gunther began with a series of lock-ups and punches to establish early dominance. As the match started to pick up pace, Gunther began to gain the upper hand on the Second City Saint. However, Punk came back with his series of moves, showcasing his veteran status on The Ring General. He came back on multiple occasions, realising the high stakes of the bout; however, Gunther himself did not back down from the former WWE Champion.The match was an amazing display of in-ring action and went outside the squared circle. Moreover, a spot at the announcer's desk saw Gunther being busted open and covered in his own blood for the first time in his career.Despite that, he tried to lock in the sleeper hold, but Punk countered it.With Gunther wobbling on his feet, CM Punk took the opportunity to connect with two GTS and cover him for the three count to win the World Heavyweight Championship for the first time in over a decade in WWE. Just as Punk was celebrating his title win, Seth Rollins' music hit, and he made his appearance on the ramp in clutches with Paul Heyman holding his Money in the Bank briefcase.He walked back, only to drop his clutches, shock the fans, and charge towards the ring. He took out Punk and cashed in his contract, connecting with a thunderous Stomp and snatching the World title from his heated rival, outsmarting everyone who thought he was injured.Also read: WWE SummerSlam 2025: Is Cody Rhodes turning Heel against John Cena?

WWE SummerSlam 2025 kicked off Saturday night at MetLife Stadium, marking the first-ever two-night edition of the event. Night 1 featured six high-stakes matches packed with drama, surprises, and chaos, setting the stage for an electric Night 2. Here’s a quick look at the results, injuries, and standout moments from Night 1.The biggest winner from the night was undoubtedly Seth Rollins, who pulled off another shocking heist of the century as he returned and cashed in his Money in the Bank contract on CM Punk to win the World Heavyweight title. After a grueling 30-minute main event where Punk defeated Gunther to win the gold, fans thought the show had reached its climax until the unthinkable happened.Rollins’ music hit, sending shockwaves through MetLife Stadium. Limping out with crutches and a knee brace, ‘The Visionary’ appeared to confirm the injury that had sidelined him for weeks. But in a stunning twist, he threw the crutches aside, ripped off the brace, and sprinted to the ring, revealing it was all a setup.Seizing the moment, Rollins cashed in his Money in the Bank briefcase on an exhausted Punk, unleashed a vicious assault, and pinned his longtime rival to steal the World Heavyweight Championship, closing Night 1 of SummerSlam with one of the most shocking swerves in recent WWE history.Saturday’s SummerSlam action kicked off with Roman Reigns and Jey Uso defeating Bronson Reed and Bron Breakker in a solid opener. The match gained added weight after Rollins’ surprise cash-in later that night. Breakker and Reed will now return as Rollins’ enforcers, possibly targeting tag or mid-card titles.Reigns, with clear unfinished business with Rollins and Paul Heyman, could reenter the title picture anytime. Notably, Reigns protected Uso during the match, hinting at either a renewed leadership role or passing the torch.Jey looks poised for another main event run on Raw, possibly building toward a future Reigns vs. Rollins showdown. The match delivered several memorable moments, with Reigns’ dive being a standout from the action-packed bout. It is safe to say that fans definitely love a 265lbs flying ‘OTC’!Drew McIntyre and Logan Paul picked up a big win on Night 1 of WWE SummerSlam, defeating country star Jelly Roll and Randy Orton in a high-energy tag match. The bout featured wild moments, including Paul diving off the top rope through the announce table onto Jelly Roll. The spot was brutal and probably the most shocking celebrity bump in recent memory.The singer fired back with clotheslines and a chokeslam, but Paul sealed the win with a second splash for the pin. Despite the loss, Triple H confirmed post-show that Jelly Roll will be back for more WWE appearances.Another highlight of SummerSlam Night 1 saw Charlotte Flair and Alexa Bliss capture the WWE Women’s Tag Team Titles from Roxanne Perez and Raquel Rodriguez. After a rocky start to her 2025 return, Flair has found her footing, thanks in large part to her alliance with Bliss. The duo has quickly become the most popular women’s tag team in WWE, and their chemistry has elevated both their characters and the division.Though their partnership may not have been the original plan, Flair and Bliss have fully embraced the storyline, turning it into a major success. With two decorated champions now holding the titles, the women’s tag division feels more important than ever.In what was a shocking result, Tiffany Stratton beat Jade Cargill to retain her WWE Women’s title. The company has largely protected Cargill since her debut, booking her as a dominant force with few clean losses. After steamrolling her way to the 2025 Queen of the Ring crown, she seemed poised to dethrone Stratton.Instead, Cargill shockingly lost clean in just seven minutes, as ‘The Buff Barbie’ continued her dominant run as the champion, looking more untouchable than ever. The loss leaves Cargill in a tough spot. She won her feud with Naomi, only to see her move to Raw and capture the Women’s World Championship, while Cargill is now left reeling on SmackDown without momentum or direction.In one of the night’s least well-received matches, Karrion Kross fell short yet again, losing to Sami Zayn in a brief and underwhelming bout. After months of claiming he could unleash the darkness within Zayn, Kross failed to deliver, both in the ring and in the story. Despite the build, the match did little to elevate either man and left Kross looking like a clear loser.Whether intentional or not, the angle felt more like a burial than a breakthrough for the former NXT Champion. While it reinforced Zayn’s image as a perennial baby face, that point had already been made far more effectively during his post-WrestleMania feud with Seth Rollins.As mentioned, the night started with Roman Reigns teaming up with Jey Uso to face the formidable duo of Bron Breakker and Bronson Reed. However, Breakker may have suffered an injury during the explosive bout.After the match, Breakker was seen limping and needed assistance backstage, sparking concern among fans. The injury reportedly occurred during a high-flying move targeting Reigns and Uso. Later in the night, during Seth Rollins' cash-in, Breakker’s right leg appeared heavily bandaged, further fueling speculation about the severity of the issue.Ahead of his WWE in-ring debut, Jelly Roll revealed in an interview with ESPN that he suffered an injury during his very first week of training. The four-time Grammy nominee shared that he broke his pinky early on, calling the experience a constant collision. Despite the setback, Roll pushed through and made an impressive outing on Night 1 of the PLE.Also read: Seth Rollins Stuns CM Punk with Another “Heist of the Century” to Capture World Heavyweight Title at SummerSlam 2025 In what was thought to be a serious knee injury, Seth Rollins fooled everyone and scripted history by plotting a master scheme to win the World Heavyweight title to close the show.","Wwe summerslam 2025 kicked off saturday night at metlife stadium, marking the first-ever two-night edition of the event.

Possible Next Steps for the Kings

Theare aggressively pursuing roster upgrades this offseason, and their latest target -forward- has once again proven elusive. According to The Athletic’s Sam Amick, the Kings made a significant trade proposal involving $77 million guard Malik Monk in a sign-and-trade deal, but the Warriors weren’t sold. Sacramento Kings reportedly offered Jonathan Kuminga a three-year, $63 million contract as part of a sign-and-trade deal. In return, the Warriors would receive:• Malik Monk• A 2030 lottery-protected first-round pickHowever, Golden State declined the deal.“The Warriors rejected this offer due to them wanting an unprotected first-round pick in a trade for Kuminga,” reported Sam Amick of The Athletic.The Golden State Warriors’ firm stance on acquiring an unprotected pick halted the deal, despite interest in Monk’s services.After falling short in the 2024 Play-In Tournament against the Dallas Mavericks, the Kings are determined to break through in the West. They are sticking with their core - Domantas Sabonis, DeMar DeRozan, and Zach LaVine - and making roster tweaks to surround them with talent.• Signed Dennis Schroder in free agency• Drafted Nique Clifford and Maxime Raynaud in the 2025 NBA Draft• Targeted multiple players in free agency• Pursued Jonathan Kuminga via sign-and-tradeThis isn’t the first time the Kings tried to land Jonathan Kuminga . Earlier this offseason, the Golden State Warriors also rejected a package centered around:• Devin Carter• Dario Saric• A protected first-round pickInstead, the Golden State Warriors were said to be more interested in:• Keegan Murray• Keon EllisTheir insistence on stronger assets - particularly unprotected draft capital - has made negotiations difficult.Malik Monk recently signed a four-year, $77 million deal with the Kings. Including him in the Jonathan Kuminga proposal shows Sacramento’s willingness to move key pieces to acquire a versatile forward who fits their system.While Golden State turned down the initial offer, the fact that they are open to acquiring Monk signals potential for future negotiations - especially if the Kings are willing to remove the protection on their 2030 first-round pick.The ball is in Sacramento’s court. If they want to pry Jonathan Kuminga away from the Golden State Warriors, they’ll likely need to return with a stronger offer - one that includes an unprotected pick or a more enticing player package.• Remove protection from the 2030 first-round pick• Include additional assets or prospects• Revisit offers involving Keegan Murray or Keon EllisAlso read: NBA Trade Rumors: San Antonio Spurs Poised for Blockbuster Trade With $52.1 Million in Movable Contracts; What’s in Store?

Why San Antonio Is a Team to Watch

Themay not have made headlines with blockbuster trades this offseason, but don’t mistake their quiet approach for inactivity. Behind the scenes, the franchise has built a uniquely flexible financial war chest - one that could unlock a staggering $52.1 million in tradable contracts this season.This opens the door for a potential mid-season splash that could dramatically reshape their roster - and possibly catapult them into playoff contention.Rather than chase high-risk deals in July, the San Antonio Spurs chose a more strategic path. Here’s what they’ve done so far:• Drafted Dylan Harper and Carter Bryant, two promising rookies who add youth and upside.• Signed free agent center Luke Kornet, adding rim protection and depth.• Traded for Kelly Olynyk, a versatile veteran big man.• Added Jordan McLaughlin and Lindy Waters III, bolstering their wing and guard rotation.None of these moves grabbed national headlines, but they were deliberate steps toward building a roster with both talent and financial mobility.While most contenders struggle to match large salaries in trades, the San Antonio Spurs are in a rare position to absorb or exchange massive contracts thanks to a collection of moveable assets:With the exception of Keldon Johnson, all of these players are on expiring deals.That’s music to the ears of front offices looking to clear cap space or reset their payroll without long-term commitments.By combining salaries, the San Antonio Spurs can match nearly any big contract in the league. That puts them in the mix for elite talent if a superstar becomes available before the trade deadline.Jonah Kubicek of FanNation explains: “The Spurs can very easily trade $52.1 million this season, allowing them to possibly add a big-name star like Giannis Antetokounmpo or LeBron James.” (H/t: Athlon Sports)While landing a player of that caliber might seem ambitious, the numbers do line up. The Spurs can build competitive offers without touching their core of young stars.If the San Antonio Spurs do pull the trigger on a major trade, they won’t be doing it from a position of desperation. Their current core is already promising, and any incoming star would be joining a solid foundation:• Victor Wembanyama• De’Aaron Fox• Devin Vassell• Stephon Castle• Jeremy Sochan• Julian Champagnie• Dylan Harper• Carter BryantThat’s a group that could contend sooner than many expected.While most of the league has finalized its rosters for the 2025–26 season, the San Antonio Spurs have left the door open. With flexibility, young talent, and draft capital, they’re in position to strike when the timing is right.Key Reasons the Spurs Can Be Deadline Buyers:• Expiring contracts totaling $52.1 million• Roster full of controllable young talent• No need to include cornerstone players in deals• Ability to add draft picks to outbid rivalsFor now, all signs suggest San Antonio is content to enter the season as constructed.

In a raw and deeply personal interview, Brown shed light on the emotional challenges he’s faced behind the scenes - even while achieving the highest honors in the NBA.Speaking on the “School of Hard Knocks” podcast, Brown didn’t hold back: “I’ve dealt with anxiety, even depression. I’ve been to some very dark places. But I feel like those dark places have allowed my light to shine.”In a world where athletes are often expected to be stoic, Brown’s honesty is both rare and powerful. He joins a growing list of NBA players - like DeMar DeRozan and Kevin Love - who’ve publicly addressed mental health, helping dismantle the stigma around vulnerability in sports.Despite winning Finals MVP honors, earning multiple All-Star selections, and signing one of the most lucrative contracts in league history, Brown still wrestles with internal pressures and outside expectations. From swirling trade rumors to the responsibilities of leadership, he acknowledges that the journey hasn’t always been easy.“Naysayers? It’s simply part of the game.

Everybody’s gonna deal with adversity at some point - even plants struggle to get sunlight.”He also highlighted how faith and resilience helped him through his darkest times: “There were nights I didn’t want to get up - but I always did. That’s where my faith came in. Anytime I’ve ever been alone, I’ve filled that space with the Most High.”Jaylen Brown’s reflections go beyond inspiration - they’re a call to stay true to oneself and never confuse borrowed confidence for genuine self-worth: “The moon borrows light from the sun. Yet, people never mistake the two… While the moon may borrow light from the sun, the sun remains the sun, shining every day.”With Jayson Tatum sidelined and veteran players moving on, Brown now shoulders more responsibility than ever before. He’s expected to be more than just a scorer or defender - he’s the emotional backbone of a reconfigured Celtics team entering a transitional phase.“I want the city to feel excited… This is not the end. Looking forward to what’s next.”This next chapter isn’t just about winning games. It’s about how Brown leads with authenticity and transparency, setting the tone both on the court and in the community.Jaylen Brown’s revelations contribute to a broader cultural shift: that mental health isn’t a weakness to hide, but a challenge to face. His message dismantles outdated ideas about toughness in professional sports and redefines what strength truly looks like.His story is a reminder that even those who appear to have it all are still human - and that speaking up, seeking help, and embracing your vulnerability can be the most courageous move of all.Also read: LeBron James' Heartfelt Nod to Luka Doncic’s $165 Million Los Angeles Lakers Contract Extension: A Bond Built for Championship Success If you or someone you know is dealing with anxiety or depression, take heart in Jaylen Brown’s words: darkness can be a beginning, not an end - and light always follows.","Boston celtics star jaylen brown has spoken out about his battle with anxiety and depression.
