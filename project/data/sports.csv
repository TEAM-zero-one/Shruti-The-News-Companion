Saros protagonist and story



Saros gameplay



The next major title from Housemarque, titled Saros, has received a new trailer, and the game is all set to be one of the finest releases of 2026. The title is said to be a spiritual successor to Returnal, a roguelike released by the Finnish studio in 2021.Saros was first revealed during a February State of Play, and it is set to evolve Returnal’s third-person roguelite formula with a new setting, characters, and a progression system. With the release date now set, it will be exciting to see how well the game performs.The following section takes a deeper look at the release date and other details of Saros.The release date for Saros is March 20, 2026, as previously confirmed by the developers at Housemarque.The game is set to be a PlayStation 5 exclusive at launch, and you will only be able to enjoy the game on the particular platform.However, given that previous PlayStation exclusives, including Returnal, have eventually been ported to PC, there is a chance that Saros will later be made available. If the same turns out to be true, Saros will likely arrive on PC in 2027/2028.The story places you in the role of Arjun Devraj, who is a Soltari Enforcer on a mission to find someone important. Devraj is essentially portrayed by the recognizable actor Rahul Kohli , who is better known for his roles in iZombie and Midnight Mass.Speaking of Saros’ setting, it is going to take place in Carcosa, which is a lost off-world colony haunted by an ominous eclipse. The world is littered with Soltari ruins and grotesque enemies, with some inspired by Hindu mythology.Saros will be maintaining the third-person action style of Returnal, but it will be introducing a key refinement to the roguelite element of the game. Essentially, Devraj will be retaining permanent upgrades and resources after dying. This will ensure that you make meaningful progress in the game, and also return stronger even after failing.In addition, the gameplay trailer showcased a variety of combat abilities, one of which is a Soltari shield. It will block enemy attacks and also absorb enemy projectiles to charge explosive bursts from Devraj's power weapon.You can also find Soltari holologs, which are the data caches across the landscape, helping you piece together the history of Carcosa. With the game's release set for March 2026, anticipation is high for the title.","Saros was first revealed during a february state of play, and it is set to evolve returnal’s third-person roguelite formula with a new setting, characters, and a progression system.

IPL 2026 Mini Auction: CSK Go Big on Uncapped Talent | Stephen Fleming & Shashwat Goenka

NEW DELHI: Kolkata Knight Riders were the biggest spenders in the IPL players’ auction on Tuesday, shelling out a record Rs 25.20 crore to sign Australian all-rounder Cameron Green and investing a further Rs 18 crore to bring in Sri Lankan fast bowler Matheesha Pathirana.Uncapped Indian talent drew massive attention, with Uttar Pradesh’s 20-year-old left-arm spinner Prashant Veer and Rajasthan’s 19-year-old wicketkeeper-batter Kartik Sharma both landing lucrative Rs 14.20 crore deals with Chennai Super Kings. Having entered the auction at a base price of Rs 30 lakh each, the pair went on to become the highest-paid uncapped players in IPL auction history.Another major gainer was Jammu and Kashmir pacer Auqib Nabi Dar, who was snapped up by Delhi Capitals for Rs 8.40 crore after starting at a base price of Rs 30 lakh.India internationals Prithvi Shaw and Sarfaraz Khan were initially left without buyers despite solid recent form. However, both found teams during the accelerated round, with Sarfaraz joining Chennai Super Kings for Rs 75 lakh and Shaw being picked up by Delhi Capitals for the same amount. Sarfaraz had earlier grabbed headlines by smashing a 22-ball 73 for Mumbai against Rajasthan in the Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy on the eve of the auction.Delhi Capitals also made a late move to sign New Zealand pacer Kyle Jamieson for Rs 2 crore.Green’s acquisition saw him overtake Mitchell Starc’s Rs 24.75 crore deal to become the most expensive overseas player in IPL auction history. His signing followed an intense bidding duel between Kolkata Knight Riders and Chennai Super Kings, with KKR ultimately prevailing. The franchise also entered the race for Venkatesh Iyer before stepping aside, allowing Royal Challengers Bengaluru to secure the all-rounder for Rs 7 crore.KKR later turned their attention to Pathirana, entering the contest after Delhi Capitals and Lucknow Super Giants pulled out. Coming in at a base price of Rs 2 crore, Pathirana became the costliest Sri Lankan player ever sold at an IPL auction.Under existing IPL rules, Green will receive Rs 18 crore for the season, with the remaining amount going towards the BCCI’s player development programme, while Pathirana will pocket his full amount as it falls within the salary cap.KKR managing director Venky Mysore expressed satisfaction with the franchise’s marquee signing. “We are very happy. Something that we were focussed on and hoping. Quite happy with price at which we got him. Would have been a concern if it had gone higher. We were keen and attached but had it affected our rest of auction, we would have let him go,” Mysore said at a press conference.“He will add lot to our team and with our new power coach Andre Russell, we know what he does, with bat and ball, couldn't be happier.“The rule the BCCI made on the Rs 18 crore, our standpoint is there is no concern, in any case it's an outflow for franchise,” he added.Green, who has previously represented Mumbai Indians and Royal Challengers Bengaluru, has featured in 29 IPL matches, scoring 707 runs and taking 16 wickets. Reacting to his move, Green said, “I'm so excited to be part of Kolkata for this year's IPL. To get down to the Eden Gardens, to get used to the atmosphere. I hope it is a great year for us. So see you soon. Ami KKR!”Elsewhere, Bangladesh left-arm pacer Mustafizur Rahman was bought by KKR for Rs 9.20 crore, while uncapped Madhya Pradesh fast bowler Mangesh Yadav joined Royal Challengers Bengaluru for Rs 5.20 crore after a bidding war with Sunrisers Hyderabad.Sunrisers Hyderabad also spent big, paying Rs 13 crore for England batter Liam Livingstone, while Lucknow Super Giants secured Australian wicketkeeper-batter Josh Inglis for Rs 8.60 crore. Punjab Kings made their first purchase of the day by signing Australia’s Cooper Connolly for Rs 3 crore, and Australian all-rounder Jack Edwards was picked up by Sunrisers Hyderabad for the same amount.In the accelerated round, New Zealand’s Tom Banton went to Gujarat Titans for Rs 2 crore, while Adam Milne was snapped up by Rajasthan Royals for Rs 2.40 crore. South African batter David Miller returned to Delhi Capitals for his base price of Rs 2 crore, though New Zealand opener Devon Conway remained unsold.Quinton de Kock rejoined Mumbai Indians at his base price of Rs 1 crore.

Jake Paul vs Anthony Joshua sparks David Haye’s boldest boxing prediction



David Haye extends his support for Jake Paul



David Haye’s latest prediction landed with some force. Ahead of Jake Paul ’s professionally sanctioned heavyweight bout with Anthony Joshua, the former world champion stunned boxing fans by backing the YouTuber-turned-fighter to pull off what he believes could become a sporting earthquake. The super hyped fight, set for a global Netflix audience, is already in the speculation phase. Haye’s extended the curiosity, turning it into a heated debate.Joshua enters with pedigree, power, and experience in his sleeves. Paul walks in with belief and a strong desire to gamble big. Haye’s argument does not rely on fantasy, especially considering Jake’s history in the sport. While the result could be far from an easy prediction, there will certainly be chaos that heavyweight boxing can unleash when least expected.Speaking on SunSport’s No Glove Lost, David Haye made his stance clear. “I think something dramatic’s gonna happen,” he said. He floated scenarios many would dismiss, yet boxing history supports. Injuries. Cuts. A clash of heads. One moment that shifts everything.“I’m going the complete opposite way. I think it’s gonna be the biggest, somehow, I don’t know how it’s gonna happen, but I think it’s gonna be the biggest upset in sporting history,” Haye said.He added, “I don’t know why, I’m going the opposite way. Something’s gonna happen.”Haye questioned Paul’s motivation, noting the American had countless safer options. “Why would Jake Paul, who could pick anybody in the world, pick, maybe he knows something,” he said. “There’s something happening that Jake Paul and his team know that the rest of the world doesn’t know, including me.”Joshua, 36, returns after a knockout loss to Daniel Dubois. Paul, 28, arrives after beating Julio Cesar Chavez Jr and stepping up again in weight. The risk is real. So is the spectacle.Haye’s respect for Paul did not begin here. It grew during Paul’s bout with Mike Tyson . “I could tell he carried him,” Haye said. “Out of respect for Mike Tyson, he wanted him to hear the final bell.”That restraint reshaped Haye’s view. Others echoed it. Viddal Riley called Paul respectful. Derek Chisora praised the attention he brings to boxing, warning Joshua must dominate early or face questions.The rules are clear. Eight rounds. Knockouts allowed. Ten-ounce gloves. Joshua capped at 245 pounds. Paul enters lighter, daring the danger.Also Read: ""I already took over...""- Jake Paul says pressure is on Anthony Joshua ahead of Miami showdown","David haye believes jake paul vs anthony joshua will be the biggest upset in sporting history.

NHL updates: Boston Bruins consider waiver claim on Detroit Red Wings forward Jonatan Berggren,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/nhl-updates-boston-bruins-consider-waiver-claim-on-detroit-red-wings-forward-jonatan-berggren/articleshow/126006928.cms,"Jonatan Berggren of the Detroit Red Wings in action during the game against the Edmonton Oilers (Credit: Getty Images)

NHL Waivers News: Berggren, Broissoit & Kolyachonok on Waivers

The Boston Bruins can now choose Jonatan Berggren as a waiver option



The NHL updates on December 15 showed a lot of movement on the waiver wire. One of the players who was put on waivers was Jonatan Berggren, a forward for the Detroit Red Wings. Berggren is only 25 years old and was once a high-upside prospect. His time in the NHL has had some good stretches, but he hasn't always been used consistently in Detroit's lineup.This news comes at a time when the Boston Bruins are still worried about their secondary scoring and winger depth. Boston has looked into making changes to its own team as the season goes on, but the waiver market is a good place to add talent without giving up future assets. This makes Berggren an interesting choice.The fact that Jonatan Berggren is on waivers has gotten a lot of attention from teams all over the league, especially those looking for cheap offensive help. This season, the Detroit Red Wings forward has played in 15 games and scored two goals and assisted on four others. Those numbers may not seem impressive, but they show that the player didn't get much ice time and had to change roles a lot, not that they weren't good.Berggren had his best NHL season in 2022–23, when he scored 28 points in 67 games. He showed good puck skills, vision, and finishing ability. Last season, he scored 12 goals while playing a depth role, which supports the idea that he can help the offense when he gets the chance. From the Bruins' point of view, Berggren fits the bill for a smart waiver claim. He is still young enough to improve, has played in the NHL before, and Boston wouldn't have to give up any draft picks or prospects to get him. Berggren has 64 points in 169 NHL games, which is a good amount for a player who is still looking for a permanent spot in the top nine.As NHL news continues to affect roster decisions across the league, the Bruins need to decide whether to act quickly or let the chance pass them by. Claiming Jonatan Berggren would show that you are taking steps to improve your depth during a tough part of the season.Also Read: Net worth of Boston Bruins star Charlie McAvoy in 2025: Details on his earnings, salary, contract details and projections","Jonatan berggren, a forward for the detroit red wings, was put on waivers on december 15.

Paris labour court rules Paris Saint-Germain has failed to pay the final months of Kylian Mbappe’s contract



Paris Saint-Germain have been ordered by a French court to pay Kylian Mbappe 60 million euros (£52.5 million) in unpaid salary and bonuses. The ruling was delivered by a Paris labour court and brings a partial end to a long and bitter legal dispute between the club and their former star forward. Mbappe, now playing for Real Madrid, had taken legal action after claiming PSG failed to pay him several contractually owed sums.The case followed months of legal arguments after Mbappe left PSG in the summer of 2024 on a free transfer. The France captain argued that the club withheld the payments for the final months of his contract. While Mbappe had initially demanded a much larger amount, the court ruled in his favour on unpaid wages and bonuses only, rejecting several other claims from both sides.The Paris labour court found that Paris Saint-Germain did not pay Mbappe three months of salary between April and June 2024. It also ruled that the club failed to pay an ethics bonus and a signing bonus written into his contract. These unpaid sums total 60 million euros.Mbappe had originally been seeking 263 million euros (£231.5 million) from PSG. That figure included 55 million euros (£46.3 million) in unpaid wages, along with damages linked to a wider contract dispute and what he described as ill-treatment by the club.The court, however, dismissed several of his additional claims, including allegations of moral harassment, concealed work, and a breach of the employer’s duty of safety.PSG had also launched a counter-claim worth 240 million euros (£211 million). The club argued they were owed compensation after a proposed 300 million euros transfer to Saudi Arabian side Al-Hilal collapsed in 2023. The court rejected PSG’s argument that Mbappe should forfeit all unpaid wages.The judges noted that the unpaid amounts had already been recognised by two decisions of the French Professional Football League in September and October 2024. They also stated that PSG failed to provide any written agreement proving Mbappe had agreed to waive the money owed to him.Mbappe’s lawyer welcomed the ruling. “We are satisfied with the ruling. This is what you could expect when salaries went unpaid. These sums were clearly due”, Frederique Cassereau said.The ruling marks a significant legal win for the French forward and a setback for the club.Also Read: Michael Phelps expresses gratitude to NBA legend LeBron James for sharing special moment with his sons",Paris saint-germain ordered to pay kylian mbappe 60 million euros (£52.5 million) in unpaid salary and bonuses.

Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce’s private call is now public, and fans are replaying every line

Travis Kelce’s ‘It’s not the time’ comment said everything after the Chargers loss

Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce are trending again, but the timing is brutal for Kansas City. A private phone call between the couple, shown in Swift’s new Disney+ docuseries, has gone viral days after the Chiefs’ 16-13 loss to the Los Angeles Chargers on Dec. 14.The clip is sweet, flirty, and very on-brand for how they talk to each other. The context is not. That Chargers loss officially eliminated Kansas City from playoff contention, and Kelce looked like a player who knew it the second the game ended.People’s Jeff Nelson reported that the first two episodes of Swift’s Disney+ docuseries, Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour | The End of an Era, began streaming Friday, Dec. 12. In footage from the first episode, Swift is shown in a car on the phone with Kelce as she heads to Wembley Stadium for a sold-out London show.Swift answers with “Baby!” and later tells him, “I love you.” She also jokes about his schedule keeping him away from her concerts, asking, “Why do you have to be in the NFL?”The conversation turns into them comparing their careers. Swift tells him, “We basically do the same job,” and Kelce answers, “You got teammates, I got teammates.” Swift keeps it moving with, “You’ve got Coach Reid, I’ve got…my mom,” and they laugh.Before the call ends, Kelce tells her, “Thanks for making my life better.” Swift responds with the line that is getting clipped everywhere: “I know, this was like, some people get a vitamin drip. I got this conversation.”Yahoo’s Shazmeen Navrange also highlighted the same exchange and noted the clip has gone viral as Swift continues rolling out footage from the docuseries.The relationship clip is the softer side of Kelce. The postgame version looked like someone who did not want to pretend everything was fine.After the Chiefs’ 16-13 loss to the Chargers on Dec. 14, Navrange reported that Kelce did not wait around for a full media session and went straight to the locker room. When reporters tried to stop him, he shut it down with one line: “It’s not the time. I’ll catch you guys during the week.”That contrast is why this moment is landing the way it is. The docuseries shows Kelce as supportive and openly affectionate. The Chargers game shows the other side, the part fans usually see first, frustration and silence when the season goes sideways.","A private phone call between the couple, shown in swift’s new disney+ docuseries, has gone viral days after the chiefs’ 16-13 loss to the los angeles chargers.

How the 2025 season reshaped Travis Kelce’s outlook

Jason Kelce weighs in on his brother’s decision

Also Read:

The Kansas City Chiefs’ stunning 2025 collapse has triggered uncomfortable conversations across the NFL, and few loom larger than Travis Kelce’s future. Once seen as a near-lock retirement candidate after this season, the veteran tight end now finds himself at the centre of renewed speculation - sparked largely by Patrick Mahomes’ season-ending ACL injury and Kansas City’s unexpected playoff exit.For the first time in over a decade, the Chiefs will miss the postseason. A 6–8 record and a Week 15 loss to the Los Angeles Chargers officially shut the door on playoff hopes, abruptly ending a dynasty run that included multiple Super Bowl appearances and championships. For Kelce, the timing could not have been worse.Kelce entered the 2025 campaign with his future undecided. After heavy retirement speculation last offseason, he chose to return and play out the final year of his contract, expecting one more title run alongside Mahomes.Instead, the season unraveled quickly: injuries mounted, performances dipped, and Kansas City found itself on the outside looking in.Mahomes’ torn ACL late against the Chargers only deepened the sense of unfinished business. For a partnership that defined the modern Chiefs era, the idea of it ending on such a note has reportedly not sat well with Kelce.Jason Kelce, who retired after the 2024 season, weighed in on his brother’s situation this week.Speaking on ESPN, the former Eagles centre stressed that retirement decisions should not be made in the immediate aftermath of a crushing season.“It’s too fresh,” Jason said, advising Travis to step away from football mentally before making any final call. His comments echoed the emotional parallels between their careers, both finishing 13 seasons, both coming off painful endings, and both facing uncertainty about what comes next.Travis himself has maintained that no decision will be made until the offseason, a stance that now appears more significant than ever.While Kelce is no longer the explosive force he was during his prime years, his 2025 production remains solid. Through 13 games, he has posted over 700 receiving yards and five touchdowns - numbers that, while not elite by his historic standards, still place him among the league’s more reliable tight ends. However, age, minor injuries and lapses in execution have become harder to ignore. Dropped passes and miscommunications have crept into his game, adding fuel to questions about how much he has left.With Mahomes expected to miss significant time in 2026 and the Chiefs facing a transitional offseason, Kelce’s decision now carries broader implications. Does he return to help steady a retooling roster, or walk away knowing the dynasty era has likely closed?For now, the answer remains unresolved. But one thing is clear: Patrick Mahomes’ injury and the Chiefs’ collapse may have changed everything about Travis Kelce’s retirement timeline.","Travis kelce entered the 2025 season with his future undecided.

Tyreek Hill’s ambiguous post after Patrick Mahomes’ ACL tear has Chiefs fans reading between the lines,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/tyreek-hills-ambiguous-post-after-patrick-mahomes-acl-tear-has-chiefs-fans-reading-between-the-lines/articleshow/126009655.cms,"Tyreek Hill reacts on X after Patrick Mahomes’ season-ending ACL tear ends the Chiefs’ decade-long playoff run.

Tyreek Hill didn’t say much, but the internet filled in the blanks

Patrick Mahomes confirmed the tear, and both teams now have to manage the fallout

The Kansas City Chiefs’ playoff streak ended Sunday with a 16-13 loss to the Los Angeles Chargers. Patrick Mahomes left late with a season-ending ACL tear, and Kansas City missed the postseason for the first time since 2014.Not long after, Miami Dolphins wide receiver Tyreek Hill posted a single 😔 on X at 6:20 a.m. on Dec. 15. Hill did not name Mahomes in that post, but the timing still lit up Chiefs fans, especially with Mahomes now done for the year.Hill’s reaction stayed short on X, and he also posted, “I hate injuries shake back 15,” referencing Mahomes. Fans immediately treated it like a signal, and the replies turned into reunion talk.One comment said, “You and Pat both coming back from major injury to another Chiefs run would be epic just saying,” while another called it a “bat signal” and wrote, “Tyreek Hill sending the bat signal to Pat Mahomes after they both got into season ending injuries but if Twitter therapist would tell you.. that Tyreek needs to heal first.. literally before he is going to look for a QB to pair up with.”That’s the part fans want to run with. The facts are simpler. Hill played for the Chiefs from 2016 to 2021 and won a Super Bowl there in 2019. He and Mahomes built one of the league’s most productive connections, and Hill has openly said the relationship still matters.In a preseason interview with Kay Adams, Hill said, “I feel like me and Pat got a good relationship, I gotta keep it that way. At the end of the day, me and him are brothers, you know what I’m saying, outside of football, like obviously we were teammates, but I feel like whenever he came into the league, our careers grew both together, so he will always be a brother to me.” He added, “Whenever I was in Kansas City, he did a tremendous job of uplifting his guys, holding his guys accountable, and making sure that guys are, you know, ‘If you’re not ready to play, then get your a* off the field’. And that’s what I love about Pat. He’ll never shy away from that.”*The Chiefs announced Mahomes tore his ACL after an MRI on Sunday. Mahomes addressed it himself on X, writing, “Don’t know why this had to happen. And not going to lie it’s hurts,” followed by, “But all we can do now is Trust in God and attack every single day over and over again. Thank you Chiefs kingdom for always supporting me and for everyone who has reached out and sent prayers. I Will be back stronger than ever.”CBS Sports injury analyst Marty Jaramillo said Mahomes is expected to make a full recovery in the offseason and should be available for Kansas City’s start to the 2026 season. At the same time, ACL recoveries often take six to 12 months, and many players need closer to nine months before they regain full strength. That makes the 2026 timeline the real storyline, not the emoji.Hill is living that reality himself. He suffered an ACL injury against the New York Jets on Sept. 29. His agent, Drew Rosenhaus, said last month, “Everything I get from Tyreek and the Dolphins is that his rehab is going extremely well,” and added, “He’s working incredibly hard. He’s made really great progress, and everything is going according to schedule.” Hill also spoke about rehab on Terron Armstead’s “The Set” on YouTube, saying, “Rehab going good, man. I’ve been attacking it every day,” and, “I gotta enjoy the small victories and just take it one day at a time, man and just count the many blessings that god has blessed me with, man.”For now, the schedule keeps moving. The Dolphins close the regular season vs. the Cincinnati Bengals (Dec. 21), at the Tampa Bay Buccaneers (Dec. 28), and vs. the New England Patriots (Jan. 4). The Chiefs finish vs. the Tennessee Titans (Dec. 21), vs. the Denver Broncos (Dec. 25), and vs. the Las Vegas Raiders (Jan. 4).Hill’s post gave fans something to talk about. Mahomes’ ACL tear gave the Chiefs a problem they can’t meme their way out of.","Miami dolphins wide receiver tyreek hill posted a single 😔 on x at 6:20 a.m. on dec. 15.

NEW DELHI: Royal Challengers Bengaluru entered the IPL 2026 auction with a relatively modest purse of Rs 16.40 crore and eight slots to fill, including two overseas positions, as the defending champions looked to reinforce an already settled squad. RCB are coming off a historic campaign, having won the IPL 2025 title — their maiden championship — after defeating Punjab Kings in the final, and the focus this time was clearly on adding depth rather than overhauling the core.The franchise has retained a strong group of players that forms the backbone of their title-winning side. The batting unit continues to revolve around Virat Kohli, supported by the likes of Phil Salt, Devdutt Padikkal, Rajat Patidar and Tim David.The presence of wicketkeeper-batter Jitesh Sharma adds flexibility in the middle order, while all-round options such as Krunal Pandya and Romario Shepherd provide balance across departments. In the bowling attack, experience and variety come through Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Josh Hazlewood, Yash Dayal and Nuwan Thushara, complemented by young Indian talent.While RCB kept their spending measured, the mini auction itself was dominated by blockbuster deals elsewhere.Australian all-rounder Cameron Green stole the headlines after being snapped up by Kolkata Knight Riders for a staggering Rs 25.20 crore, making him the third most expensive player in IPL history. Chennai Super Kings went all out for uncapped Indian talent, with Prashant Veer and Kartik Sharma becoming the highest-priced uncapped players in IPL history. KKR further made waves by securing Matheesha Pathirana for Rs 18 crore, the highest fee ever paid for a Sri Lankan player at an IPL auction.Overall, all 10 franchises managed to fill the 77 available slots, spending a combined Rs 215.45 crore in a frenetic auction that once again underlined the league’s growing financial muscle.RCB made some valuable additions, headlined by the signing of India all-rounder Venkatesh Iyer for Rs 7 crore, adding proven all-round quality to the squad. They also brought in New Zealand pacer Jacob Duffy for Rs 2 crore and uncapped left-arm fast bowler Mangesh Yadav for Rs 5.20 crore. Young Indian prospects Satvik Deswal, Kanishk Chouhan, Vihaan Malhotra and Vicky Ostwal were secured at their base prices, while England batter Jordan Cox was picked up for Rs 75 lakh.With a championship-winning core intact and smart reinforcements added, Royal Challengers Bengaluru will head into IPL 2026 aiming to defend their crown and build on the momentum of a landmark season.Virat Kohli, Phil Salt, Devdutt Padikkal, Rajat Patidar, Tim David, Krunal Pandya, Romario Shepherd, Jitesh Sharma, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Yash Dayal, Josh Hazlewood, Suyash Sharma, Abhinandan Singh, Jacob Bethell, Nuwan Thushara, Rasikh Dar, Swapnil SinghVenkatesh Iyer (Rs 7 crore), Jacob Duffy (Rs 2 crore), Mangesh Yadav (Rs 5.20 crore), Satvik Deswal (Rs 30 lakh), Kanishk Chouhan (Rs 30 lakh), Vihaan Malhotra (Rs 30 lakh), Vicky Ostwal (Rs 30 lakh), Jordan Cox (Rs 75 lakh)Rajat Patidar (c), Virat Kohli, Devdutt Padikkal, Phil Salt, Jitesh Sharma, Krunal Pandya, Swapnil Singh, Tim David, Romario Shepherd, Jacob Bethell, Josh Hazlewood, Yash Dayal, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Nuwan Thushara, Rasikh Salam, Abhinandan Singh, Suyash Sharma, Venkatesh Iyer, Jacob Duffy, Satvik Deswal, Mangesh Yadav, Jordan Cox, Vicky Ostwal, Vihaan Malhotra, Kanishk Chouhan.","Royal challengers bengaluru entered the ipl 2026 auction with a relatively modest purse of rs 16.40 crore.
