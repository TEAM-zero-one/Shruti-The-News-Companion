Asia Cup press conference: Suryakumar Yadav on playing Pakistan, Sanju Samson, India Playing XI

Poll Who was the standout performer for India against UAE? Kuldeep Yadav Jasprit Bumrah

NEW DELHI: In a rare incident during the Asia Cup 2025 clash between India and UAE at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium on Wednesday, UAE batter Junaid Siddique was initially given out after a sharp direct throw from India’s wicketkeeper Sanju Samson found him short of the crease. However, Indian skipper Suryakumar Yadav chose to withdraw the appeal when Siddique pointed out that bowler Shivam Dube’s towel had slipped from his waistband during the run-up.The unusual moment came in the 13th over when Siddique attempted a wild swing at Dube’s short-pitched delivery. Replays from the third umpire confirmed that his foot was outside the crease, and the “OUT” signal was flashed on the big screen before India opted to overturn the appeal.The gesture did not impact the match result, as UAE were bundled out for just 57 runs soon after.Kuldeep Yadav, returning to white-ball action after warming the bench during India’s five-Test tour of England, was the star with the ball. The left-arm spinner demolished the UAE batting order with sensational figures of 4 for 7 in just 2.1 overs.Jasprit Bumrah set the tone for India’s dominance, removing Kerala-born opener Alishan Sharafu with a pinpoint yorker.Sharafu had top-scored for UAE with 22 off 17 balls, including three fours and a six, before Bumrah’s lethal delivery ended his innings. Once Sharafu departed, the UAE batting line-up collapsed swiftly, with wickets tumbling in quick succession.Chasing a modest target of 58, India cruised to a 9-wicket win, starting their Asia Cup 2025 campaign in emphatic fashion.India will next face arch-rivals Pakistan on Sunday in Dubai, a contest already billed as the marquee clash of the group stage.","India beat uae by nine wickets in their asia cup 2025 opener.

Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030 Push

The Scale of Investment

Ronaldo Speaks

Changing Global Perceptions

What Travellers Can Expect Next



The Real Test Ahead

Disclaimer: Content Produced by Saudi Tourism

When Cristiano Ronaldo appears in a campaign, people look. That simple fact is the fulcrum of Saudi Tourism’s latest push: a filmic, high-octane campaign titled “I Came for Football, I Stayed for More” that positions Ronaldo not just as a sporting icon but as a living, breathing emblem of Saudi’s newly ambitious events calendar – the. The film highlights how one of the world’s most recognisable athletes invites audiences to explore Saudi beyond football, from museums and desert festivals to fashion weeks and film premieres. It delivers a clear message: come for the match, stay for the rest.Ronaldo’s involvement is more than a celebrity endorsement; it’s a strategic bridge between two narratives. On one side sits the immediate, visceral thrill of live sport, stadium roars, late penalties, rivalries renewed, on the other sits a carefully curated cultural programme that Saudi wants international travellers to discover: AlUla’s rock-cut valleys, Riyadh’s sprawling seasons and fashion weeks, film festivals on the Red Sea, and purpose-built entertainment districts. Dress the country in the unmistakable glow of a global star, and you give curious travellers an easy entry point to explore the rest.This is not spin without backing. Saudi’s leadership has been investing in travel and events as part of Vision 2030, a transformation plan that has already altered the map of global tourism. Official targets have been raised now cite an ambition of 150 million visitors by 2030, and the calendar itself is swelling with headline acts: from elite motorsport and global tennis to esports and major golf tournaments. These events will help turn seasonal travel into year-round visits.The future shines when there’s growth. Saudi has committed $800 billion towards developing its tourism sector as part of Vision 2030. The industry is projected to reach $22.4 billion in market value by 2030, contributing $16.5 billion to the Kingdom’s GDP. Events play a pivotal role in this vision, not only boosting visitor numbers but also driving infrastructure growth, creating jobs and inspiring youth participation. Investments in new stadiums, arenas and grassroots programmes are central to shaping Saudi’s legacy as a leader in global sports tourism and wider entertainment.The campaign, titled “I Came for Football, I Stayed For More,” features Cristiano Ronaldo and is presented as a journey through Saudi’s expanding calendar of cornerstone events. The Saudi Tourism Authority says the campaign will run across key markets including Europe, India and China, and will use TV, social, digital and OTA channels to showcase year-round sports, entertainment, film and fashion events held across Riyadh, Jeddah and AlUla, alongside curated visitor packages aimed at making travel easier. The release also includes remarks from Saudi tourism officials underlining the kingdom’s investment in tourism as part of Vision 2030 and Ronaldo’s own comments about the country’s blend of heritage and ambition.Cristiano Ronaldo said: “Being part of Saudi’s journey as a global sports hub has been truly special and somehow unexpected for me a few years ago. Today, the truth is that from the energy of the fans to the scale of ambition, this is where the future of sport is being written. What I admire most about Saudi is how it honours its roots while building for the future. From camels to horses, racing to esports, from the desert to the stadium, this is a place where every young athlete can dream big. ”For the traveller, and for the reader back home, the immediate takeaway is an invitation to rethink Saudi as a multi-layered destination. It is not merely a place to watch world-class football or a one-note stopover; it is positioning itself as a thriving global destination where culture, sport and entertainment meet. Featuring Ronaldo at the centre, the campaign mirrors Saudi’s spirit as a modern, forward-looking destination—open, vibrant, and ready to welcome the world. His Excellency Ahmed Al Khateeb, Minister of Tourism for Saudi Arabia, stated: ""Today, Saudi is cementing its place as a global destination that combines cultural authenticity, warm hospitality, and the thrill of world-class events. In the tourism sector, we remain steadfast in our commitment to developing a seamless landscape that inspires the world and provides visitors with unforgettable experiences.""Expect blockbuster weekends where sport sits beside concerts and curated local experiences; think Formula 1 weekends wrapped with live music, or a football fixture that dovetails with a regional food festival and guided heritage walks. Tailored packages from tour operators that stitch headline events into longer itineraries are also meant to encourage visitors to stay longer.Ultimately, Saudi’s newest campaign is more than a call to sport—it’s a welcome to a nation rich with landscapes, culture, cuisine, and unforgettable experiences. With Cristiano Ronaldo amplifying its global reach, the campaign transforms into a simple truth: come for football, stay to discover Saudi.","The campaign features cristiano ronaldo and is presented as a journey through saudi’s expanding calendar of cornerstone events.

Brooks Nader caught in a love triangle with Carlos Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner



Brooks Nader’s history of messy romances keeps her in headlines



Sports Illustrated swimsuit model and reality star Brooks Nader has turned the US Open into more than just a battle of rackets. According to reports, she found herself in a love triangle with champion Carlos Alcaraz and runner-up Jannik Sinner, dating both stars at the same time. The plotline, ripped straight from Zendaya’s movie Challengers, has quickly become one of the most talked-about off-court storylines in tennis.The speculation began when Brooks’ sister, Grace Ann, revealed on Page Six Radio that her sibling was juggling “a little roster” of athletes. She teased one name that “rhymes with winner,” leaving fans convinced Jannik Sinner was involved. Brooks, clearly flustered, threatened to “punch” her sister for spilling secrets, but by then the gossip had taken off.Soon after, late-night host Jimmy Kimmel pressed Brooks about Sinner, and her coy response only fueled rumors. “Is this, like, an interrogation? I’m so scared right now… You’re close. You’re warm,” she teased. But the real twist came when she was spotted courtside, cheering for Carlos Alcaraz during his semifinal and final matches. Days later, Grace Ann confirmed, “The rumors are true,” adding, “Dating is such a loose term.But I do know he’s the man of the hour.”While many fans labeled the situation “dramatic,” others pointed out the double standard: men in the sports world often date multiple women without scrutiny. If no commitment has been made, Nader is free to explore her options — even if those options happen to be the top two tennis players in the world.This isn’t the first time Nader’s love life has made waves. Earlier this year, she split from Dancing with the Stars pro Gleb Savchenko, who claimed he only learned of the breakup through the press. She also admitted in January that she’s “still legally married” to William Haire, despite announcing their separation in 2024.From Tom Brady dating rumors to a Hulu reality series, Brooks Nader has mastered the art of staying in the spotlight. And now, with Alcaraz and Sinner in the mix, her off-court roster is making nearly as many headlines as the athletes themselves.Also Read: Ronika Love proves she’s Jordan Love’s biggest supporter with bold game-day look before Packers vs Commanders showdown",Sports illustrated swimsuit model brooks nader is in a love triangle.

What happened to Tucker Kraft?



Tucker Kraft’s injury and fantasy football impact



The Green Bay Packers had an early scare on Thursday night when tight end Tucker Kraft exited with an apparent lower-body injury during the first quarter against the Washington Commanders. For a moment, it looked like the offense would lose one of its most reliable weapons. But by the end of the night, fans breathed easier with good news—Kraft returned to the field.The third-year tight end appeared shaken up while running a route on the Packers’ second drive. He gingerly walked off under his own power and did not immediately return, sparking concern on the sidelines. While he didn’t enter the medical tent, the momentary absence was enough to raise eyebrows given his growing importance in Green Bay’s passing game.Before the injury, Kraft was already showcasing his value. He connected with quarterback Jordan Love on a 57-yard strike that electrified the offense and later added another catch, bringing his total to 72 yards in the opening minutes. For Love, who continues to build chemistry with his receivers, Kraft has become a dependable safety valve, particularly in red zone opportunities.Compounding the tension, wide receiver Jayden Reed also suffered a shoulder injury earlier in the matchup, leaving the Packers’ offense suddenly short-handed.In such a scenario, Kraft’s potential absence could have been devastating. Fortunately for Green Bay, he was cleared to return and rejoined his teammates in the next offensive series.For fantasy football managers, the brief scare was a reminder of how pivotal Tucker Kraft has become. Entering his third season, Kraft had already proven his worth last year with 50 receptions, 707 yards, and a team-high seven touchdowns. Many expected him to build on that momentum in 2025, and his hot start against Washington suggested just that.If the injury had lingered, Luke Musgrave would likely have stepped in as the primary tight end. While Musgrave has streaming upside, Kraft’s production and consistency have cemented him as the true TE1. His quick return Thursday night signals relief for both the Packers and fantasy managers counting on his continued rise.Also Read: Vikings star Justin Jefferson drops heartfelt message to JJ McCarthy amid exciting baby news and practice absence","The green bay packers had an early scare when tight end tucker kraft exited with an apparent lower-body injury during the first quarter.

Why was Malik Beasley suspected of illegal betting?

Malik Beasley Breaks Silence On FEDS, Detroit Pistons & Interested NBA teams!

NBA Commissioner Adam Silver has finally spoken on the matter of the gambling investigation against Malik Beasley. He chose not to divulge many details and restricted his comments to confirming that the NBA is investigating the matter. Malik Beasley faced a federal investigation after his involvement in a prop bet gambling scandal was alleged.Adam Silver opened up about the scope of the investigation that the NBA intends to conduct on the matter. Malik Beasley’s role in gambling was suspected when he played as a Milwaukee Bucks guard. His possible involvement in prop bets during the 2023-2024 season raised suspicions, leading to the federal investigation. Beasley’s lawyer, Steve Haney, confirmed in August that his client was no longer facing a federal probe.An NBA board of governors’ meeting took place in New York on September 10, following which the commissioner revealed a fresh update on the Malik Beasley gambling scandal. He confirmed that the NBA has started its own probe into the case after the federal investigation. Without speaking much on the matter, he shared:“I’ll only say the investigation is ongoing. “As I understand it, there’s still a federal investigation that’s ongoing of Malik Beasley as well.”Talking about the scope of the NBA investigation, he said, “We will address whatever is presented to us in his case.”As per Adam Silver’s statement, it is evident that Malik Beasley’s difficulties have not come to an end as yet. Meanwhile, Beasley’s lawyer previously said that the investigation does not amount to levying a charge. He shared that he was ‘unsure’ if his client would be charged with any crime.Previously, a report dated August 22, 2025, published in the Los Angeles Times mentioned that Malik Beasley was no longer the target of the federal investigation, and that he remained uncharged even months after the investigation. In that light, things have become quite intriguing as regards to what the outcome of the NBA probe will be.It all started when Malik Beasley played as a guard for the Milwaukee Bucks. In January 2024, a sportsbook reported heavy betting on Beasley’s numbers, as per an ESPN report. The significant shortening of odds on Malik Beasley, who had posted only 2.5 rebounds, led to suspicions of his involvement in gambling.Further, Beasley’s financial difficulties were considered as a probable cause for his looking for ways to make quick money. As per an ESPN report by David Purdum dated August 8, 2025, Beasley was evicted from a rented house due to accumulating unpaid rent. The same report mentioned that he also owed money to a marketing agency, a dentist, and a celebrity barber.Malik Beasley had been in talks with the Detroit Pistons over a multi-year, $42 million contract, which ultimately was put on hold, as per Sports Illustrated.Also Read: Malik Beasley still under scrutiny in gambling probe despite ‘cleared’ target status",Nba commissioner adam silver breaks silence over league’s stand on malik beasley gambling probe.

Saudi League's stature extends beyond Cristiano Ronaldo's stardom

The Roshn Saudi League’s growing influence on world football was once again on full display during the recent 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifiers. From Cristiano Ronaldo making history in Europe to African stars pushing their nations closer to the global stage, RSL players left a major mark across continents.Ronaldo, the Al Nassr and Portugal captain, scored his 39th World Cup qualifying goal in a dramatic 3-2 victory over Hungary last weekend. The strike drew him level with Guatemala’s Carlos Ruiz for the most goals in the history of FIFA World Cup qualification. This was followed by a brace against Armenia a couple of days before. At 40 years old, Ronaldo continues to defy age, taking his career tally to 943 goals as he chases the remarkable 1,000-goal milestone.But Ronaldo was not the only Saudi-based star to shine. Across Europe, Africa, and beyond, several RSL players delivered decisive performances for their national teams, underlining how the league’s talent pool is shaping international football ahead of the 2026 World Cup.Cristiano Ronaldo’s penalty in the 58th minute against Hungary highlighted his consistency on the international stage. His record-equalling 39th World Cup qualifying goal added another chapter to his legendary career.The Portugal captain, who also netted twice against Armenia in the previous match, continues to be a driving force for his national team and a global ambassador for the Roshn Saudi League.Ronaldo’s national teammates from the Saudi league also made headlines. Al Hilal’s João Cancelo provided an assist and scored the winner for Portugal against Hungary, while midfielder Rúben Neves anchored the side throughout. Al Nassr’s summer signing João Félix made a late substitute appearance, fresh off his hat-trick debut in the RSL.In Africa, RSL stars were equally influential. Morocco goalkeeper Yassine Bounou kept a clean sheet in a 2-0 victory over Zambia, while Al Fayha forward Fashion Sakala battled on the opposite side. In Senegal’s crucial 3-2 win over DR Congo, Kalidou Koulibaly held firm in defense, with Al Ahli’s Edouard Mendy and Al Nassr’s Sadio Mané also playing vital roles. The win pushed Senegal to the top of Group B.Elsewhere, Franck Kessié (Al Ahli) featured for Ivory Coast in a draw with Gabon, while Riyad Mahrez (Al Ahli) and Saïd Benrahma (NEOM SC) started for Algeria in their goalless stalemate with Guinea. Al Ittihad’s Houssem Aouar came on as a late substitute.The influence of RSL talent stretched even further. In South America, Darwin Núñez, a recent Al Hilal signing, led Uruguay’s attack in a draw with Chile. His club and international teammate Nahitan Nández also featured in midfield.In North America, Al Fayha goalkeeper Orlando Mosquera played for Panama in a 1-1 draw with Guatemala, while Al Najmah striker Romell Quioto scored for Honduras in their 2-0 victory over Nicaragua.Italy’s Mateo Retegui, of Al Qadsiah, contributed two assists in a 5-4 thriller against Israel, following up on his brace for Italy earlier in the week. Meanwhile, Al Ittihad defender Mario Mitaj completed a solid 90 minutes in Albania’s win over Latvia.Cristiano Ronaldo may have stolen the spotlight with yet another record, but the wider story is the Roshn Saudi League’s global footprint. From Europe to Africa, Asia to the Americas, RSL stars are not only lifting their clubs but also shaping their nations’ World Cup dreams.

Suni Lee explores life outside gymnastics after Paris success

“I’ve just been learning to find myself and everything else that I’m passionate about because who knows if I’ll come back for the next Olympics.”

Minnesota's 22-year-old gymnast Suni Lee is uncertain on whether she will participate at the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics. She came back from an incurable renal disease in 2024 to earn three medals in Paris. The American competitor added two bronze medals and assisted Team USA get gymnastics gold. She had been kicked from competition in April 2023 after doctors diagnosed her condition from swelling and pain. Living in New York City currently, Lee claims she is concentrating on other interests apart from gymnastics.In early 2023, Suni Lee began waking up with swelling all over her body. At one point, she gained eight pounds overnight and later put on 40 pounds due to fluid retention.Initially told it may be allergies, her doctors eventually determined she had an incurable kidney illness after additional tests including a kidney biopsy. The illness caused her to resign gymnastics for six months and withdraw from Auburn University.Still, Suni Lee came back to competition and stunned the world at the Paris Olympics in July 2024. She helped the USA to win team gold.Moreover, she earned bronze in the women's all-around and bronze in unequal bars. July 2025 saw her in Los Angeles for the ESPY Awards.

What happened to Jayden Reed?



Why Jayden Reed’s injury matters for Packers’ playoff hopes



For a brief moment on Thursday night, it looked like Jayden Reed was going to set the tone for the Green Bay Packers. The second-year receiver hauled in what appeared to be a spectacular 39-yard touchdown on the opening drive against the Washington Commanders. But in a matter of seconds, the momentum—and the Packers’ optimism—came crashing down.Reed’s highlight catch didn’t stand, as a holding penalty on Anthony Belton erased the score. Far worse, Reed fell awkwardly on his right shoulder as Commanders safety Quan Martin finished the play. He remained on the ground in visible pain before heading to the locker room, his right arm dangling at his side. The Packers later announced he was questionable to return with a shoulder injury.This setback adds to Reed’s recent struggles with injuries. Coming into the season, he was already nursing a Jones fracture in his foot. Now, the talented wideout faces another obstacle just as he was emerging as Jordan Love’s most reliable target. Losing Reed, especially in a game where the Packers were already down two starting offensive linemen, could not have come at a worse time.The Packers entered this season with Super Bowl ambitions, fueled by the blockbuster addition of Micah Parsons and the rapid development of Jordan Love.But even with star power at multiple positions, the receiver room remained the biggest unknown. Reed was expected to shoulder that responsibility, quickly stepping into a WR1 role thanks to his speed, route running, and big-play ability.Without Reed, Green Bay’s offense looks significantly thinner. Christian Watson remains sidelined, and while Romeo Doubs, Dontayvion Wicks, and rookie Matthew Golden offer depth, none carry Reed’s explosive impact. Against a disciplined Commanders defense, Jordan Love will need to elevate his game, spreading the ball creatively to keep the chains moving.For now, Green Bay fans can only hope Reed’s shoulder injury isn’t severe. In a season built on high expectations, losing their brightest young receiver for an extended stretch would be a devastating blow to their championship pursuit.Also Read: Chiefs rookie Xavier Worthy hints at surprise recovery timeline with cryptic post before Super Bowl rematch","Green bay packers wideout jayden reed suffered a shoulder injury against the washington commanders.

NFL legend Rob Gronkowski is raising eyebrows with a blunt assessment of the Kansas City Chiefs. After the Philadelphia Eagles’ Super Bowl LIX victory, he warns that Patrick Mahomes ’ team may be vulnerable, pointing to both on-field strategies and troubling sideline tensions that could signal a rough 2025 season ahead for Kansas City.NFL legend Rob Gronkowski, a four-time Super Bowl champion, has sounded the alarm for the Kansas City Chiefs. After observing the Philadelphia Eagles’ dominant 40-22 Super Bowl LIX victory over the Chiefs, Gronkowski believes the Eagles have revealed a strategy that could trouble Patrick Mahomes’ squad moving forward.""The Philadelphia Eagles opened that floodgate of, ‘Hey, if you punch these guys in the face, you take it to them, you come out swinging, they’re gonna fold and they’re not gonna be the team you were seeing all last year,’"" he explained on Up & Adams.The Chiefs’ early struggles this season seem to support Gronkowski’s concerns. Following their Super Bowl defeat, Kansas City also lost their season opener to AFC West rival Los Angeles Chargers in São Paulo, Brazil, 27-21. Justin Herbert had a career-defining performance, exploiting weaknesses in the Chiefs’ defensive line.Gronkowski highlighted another worrying factor: the Chiefs’ internal dynamics. A sideline altercation between defensive stars Chris Jones and Drue Tranquill during a timeout raised red flags.""What I was surprised about is when things aren’t going their way, as you can see, when they start struggling a little bit, they start yelling at each other,"" Gronkowski said.He added, ""The blame game starts going on. You can see it on the sidelines. And that’s not a good situation. You want to come together when you’re down, when things aren’t going your way.

Xavier Worthy injury update brings optimism for Chiefs



Chiefs need Xavier Worthy healthy for long-term success



The Kansas City Chiefs received a major boost this week as wide receiver Xavier Worthy returned to practice, less than two weeks after suffering a right shoulder injury in the season opener. While the 22-year-old rookie is pushing for an early comeback, the team appears set on taking a cautious approach with its rising star.Worthy’s participation in Thursday’s practice surprised many, given the initial concerns surrounding his shoulder. He was injured during Kansas City’s Week 1 loss to the Los Angeles Chargers after colliding with teammate Travis Kelce on the first drive. Fortunately, surgery and injured reserve were avoided, with reports now suggesting he could be back as early as Week 3 against the New York Giants.Still, Worthy has made it clear he is eager to suit up. On Thursday, he posted a picture of himself in uniform to Instagram with the caption “Free 1,” a message fans interpreted as a plea to play against the Philadelphia Eagles this Sunday. The Chiefs’ medical staff, however, may have the final word.His potential absence is significant. With Rashee Rice serving a six-game suspension, Kansas City can ill afford to lose its top two receivers. Patrick Mahomes needs weapons, and Worthy’s ability to stretch defenses was evident last season when he posted 638 yards and six touchdowns as a rookie.His playoff surge, highlighted by an electric 157-yard, two-touchdown Super Bowl performance, cemented his status as a game-changer.Even if Worthy sits out this week, the Chiefs know his return will be crucial for the season’s trajectory. The franchise invested heavily when they drafted him in the first round of the 2024 NFL Draft, and his chemistry with Mahomes already shows signs of blossoming.Kansas City faces the Eagles on Sunday in a Super Bowl LIX rematch. While fans would love to see Worthy back on the field, protecting his health remains the priority. The Chiefs have a long season ahead, and rushing their star receiver could risk more than it rewards. For now, optimism remains—Worthy looks closer than anyone expected to being back in action.Also Read: “Yelling at each other”: Rob Gronkowski claims Chiefs are falling apart after Eagles expose Patrick Mahomes’ weaknesses","Xavier worthy returned to practice for the first time since suffering a shoulder injury in the season opener.

J.J. McCarthy and Katya Kuropas are having a whirlwind journey



The Minnesota Vikings couldn’t have scripted a better opening to the 2025 season. Quarterback J.J. McCarthy, making his long-awaited debut after missing all of 2024 with a meniscus injury, led a dramatic fourth-quarter comeback to beat the Chicago Bears 27-24 on Monday Night Football. But while his heroics earned him NFL Offensive Player of the Week, McCarthy’s biggest victory is happening off the field — the imminent birth of his first child.After shaking off early-game jitters that included a costly pick-six, McCarthy showed the poise that convinced the Vikings to draft him 10th overall in 2024. In the final 15 minutes, he threw two touchdown passes and added a rushing score, igniting U.S. Bank Stadium and stamping his name on the league’s radar. Head coach Kevin O’Connell called the performance “a glimpse of what’s to come,” reaffirming his long-term faith in the young quarterback.Just days later, McCarthy skipped Thursday’s practice for the best reason possible. According to Vikings insider Alec Lewis of The Athletic, the quarterback was at a local hospital with his fiancée, Katya Kuropas, as they awaited the birth of their son. O’Connell couldn’t hide his joy, saying he was “pumped to share the news” with the team.Star wideout Justin Jefferson added his own heartfelt message, but with a playful reminder of what lies ahead:“If you seeing this now, congratulations my boy, congratulations. I’m excited for him for this new chapter, this new journey. But after you get done, come on back!”For McCarthy and Kuropas, this milestone comes after years of shared highs and lows. From winning the 2024 National Championship with Michigan, to enduring a season-ending NFL injury before taking his first snap, the couple has weathered the rollercoaster together. This week, however, has brought nothing but joy — a comeback victory, national recognition, and the start of a new chapter in parenthood.The Vikings face the Atlanta Falcons on Sunday Night Football, and McCarthy is expected to return before kickoff.

Anthony Martial is set to join Monterrey as per several reports (Screengrab)

Poll Do you think Anthony Martial will be a success at Monterrey? Yes, definitely No, not at all

Anthony Martial is on the verge of a move to Liga MX side Monterrey, with reports suggesting the French forward has agreed terms and will undergo a medical in Mexico.The 29-year-old, released by Manchester United at the end of the 2023/24 season, had joined AEK Athens on a free transfer last summer. Despite being handed what was described as the biggest contract in the Greek club’s history, Martial struggled to make an impact, featuring in just 24 games across competitions. He has not been included in the squad for AEK’s last six fixtures.Transfer journalist Fabrizio Romano reported that Monterrey and Martial have reached an agreement, with the move pending medical clearance. Fellow Mexican side Pumas were also in the race but failed to finalise a deal after Martial declined to lower his wage demands.As per reports from journalist Cesar Luis Merlo, AEK were willing to loan him to Pumas free of charge (they should only pay his salary), but Martial earns a massive salary.Martial, who joined United from Monaco in 2015 for an initial £36m, went on to score 90 goals in 317 appearances for the Premier League club. His imminent switch to Monterrey comes just months after the Mexican side secured the signing of former Real Madrid defender Sergio Ramos.Should the move go through, Martial will link up with the 39-year-old veteran, who has already helped Monterrey climb to the top of the Liga MX standings with six wins from their opening seven matches.","Anthony martial is on the verge of a move to monterrey, according to reports.

Liberty Favored but Sun’s Grit Could Spark Surprises

Thehead into their September 11, 2025 matchup against thewith a clean injury report and renewed depth, offering a much-needed boost as they aim to reclaim their early-season form. After battling through mid-year absences and inconsistent performances, the team now looks poised to make a serious playoff push.• Breanna Stewart’s return is a game-changer for the Liberty. Cleared to play after recovering from a knee injury, Stewart’s presence both offensively and defensively in the paint will be key for the team’s strategy.• Sabrina Ionescu, who had missed several games earlier this month due to a toe issue, is also back in action. Her return brings stability to the Liberty’s playmaking and scoring options.• Aside from these previously injured players, the Liberty report no other players out or questionable, making them one of the healthiest teams heading into this critical matchup.Having started the season with a perfect record, the Liberty’s form dipped, going 17-17 in their last 34 games, but their restored depth gives them a fighting chance to mount a legitimate title defense.The Connecticut Sun face a stark contrast, dealing with multiple injuries that hinder their rotation and complicate their late-season surge. With veteran guards sidelined and role players pressed into larger roles, the Sun’s playoff aspirations hang by a thread.• Bria Hartley, a crucial backcourt presence, suffered a severe meniscus tear in late August and is out for the remainder of the season. Her absence leaves the Sun without one of their most dependable scorers and leaders.• Leila Lacan remains out with an undisclosed injury, further weakening the guard rotation and forcing younger players to step up.• Marina Mabrey continues her recovery from a late-season injury. Her absence affects perimeter shooting and fluid ball movement.• Aneesah Morrow, listed as day-to-day, faces ongoing concerns that limit bench depth and flexibility.Despite these setbacks, the Sun have leaned heavily on veteran Tina Charles and a strengthened frontcourt to keep hopes alive. Their three-game win streak heading into the game reflects resilience but also underscores the uphill battle they face.The injury situations dramatically impact how both teams will approach tonight’s game:• The Liberty’s full health means they can rely on Stewart’s two-way dominance and Ionescu’s aggressive playmaking to control the tempo and exploit mismatches.• The Sun’s depleted lineup forces them into unconventional rotations and relies on secondary players to step up, creating opportunities for breakout performances and strategic experimentation.This mismatch in health and depth adds a layer of unpredictability, with each team needing to adjust dynamically throughout the game.Fans should keep an eye on two major narratives that will define the contest:• Stewart’s comeback has been eagerly anticipated. Her ability to anchor both ends of the court could reignite the Liberty’s offense and defensive structure, potentially turning them back into championship contenders.• The Sun’s adversity-driven approach makes for compelling viewing.
