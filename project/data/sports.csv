Tom Brady reveals the one factor that could trouble Matthew Stafford in Chicago,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/tom-brady-reveals-the-one-factor-that-could-trouble-matthew-stafford-in-chicago/articleshow/126600446.cms,"Tom Brady reveals the one factor that could trouble Matthew Stafford in Chicago (Getty Images)

Tom Brady on Matthew Stafford’s cold-weather adjustment

The Los Angeles Rams walk into one of the toughest environments in the NFL this weekend, and the spotlight once again lands on quarterback Matthew Stafford . The Rams face the Chicago Bears on January 18, 2026, at Soldier Field, where winter conditions often shape the outcome as much as play-calling.This time, the conversation took a sharper turn after Tom Brady weighed in. The seven-time Super Bowl champion offered perspective on cold-weather football while speaking about Stafford’s situation, not as criticism but as a reminder of how quickly conditions can test even proven quarterbacks.Brady shared his thoughts during an appearance on ""The Herd with Colin Cowherd"" earlier this month. While discussing playoff football and QB preparation, Brady pointed to weather as a subtle but real factor in Chicago’s favor.“Matt did play in Detroit for a long time, and in that division he went outside to Chicago and Green Bay,” Brady said on the FOX Sports show. “It’s not like he hasn’t played in it. But I will say, when I went to Tampa after my time in New England, it didn’t take me very long to get very soft in the cold.”TB-12's comment came with context, no doubt. Stafford spent 12 seasons with the Detroit Lions and played many games in the freezing conditions of the NFC North.But since joining the Rams in 2021, most of his winters in Southern California have been mild. Chicago expects temperatures near 10 degrees on Sunday, with wind gusts close to 20 miles per hour. Wind chill could push the “feels like” temperature closer to four degrees by kickoff.Brady explained how quickly the body reacts when cold exposure becomes rare. He recalled Tampa Bay’s NFC Championship Game trip to Green Bay during the 2020 season.“That game was around 32 to 34 degrees at kickoff,” Brady said during the interview. “It wasn’t minus-nine. That’s really cold. And that’s a big advantage for Chicago.”The Bears know this well. Over the past six weeks, Chicago leaned into Soldier Field’s conditions and used them to disrupt visiting offenses. Cold tightens hands. Plus, footing changes route depth and release speed.Stafford enters the matchup healthy and confident, but this test goes beyond arm strength. It demands patience, grip control, and trust in short throws. Brady’s message focused on adjustment, not weakness. Sunday’s game will show whether Stafford’s experience, preparation, and playoff poise can meet the challenge. If he adapts early, the weather becomes just another obstacle, not the story.Also Read: “Cry for sympathy and attention”: Tom Brady accused of seeking sympathy after post tied to Gisele Bündchen wedding","Tom brady reveals the one factor that could trouble matthew stafford in chicago.

"NHL Injury Updates: William Nylander questionable, Tom Wilson near return, Leo Carlsson out weeks",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/nhl-injury-updates-william-nylander-questionable-tom-wilson-near-return-leo-carlsson-out-weeks/articleshow/126625936.cms,"William Nylander (Image Via Twitter)

What’s the status of William Nylander, Tom Wilson, and Leo Carlsson ahead of upcoming games?

NHL teams have begun to feel the squeeze as injuries start to dictate their strategies regarding games and players even more. Willy Nylander is the key man for the Maple Leafs, who left the game on Thursday night due to a lower-body injury, and now the team is uncertain about his presence for the next games.Other teams are going through similar experiences. The Washington Capitals are monitoring Tom Wilson closely after he has been absent for some time, while the Ducks are already making changes after it was confirmed that Carlsson will not play for weeks.After sustaining a lower-body injury while playing against the Vegas Golden Knights, William Nylander is now doubtful for the next game. Coach Craig Berube stated that there is no specific time fixed for Nylander's return from the injury. Nylander has been off the ice for a while now, but he continues to be the top scorer for Toronto this season.Tom Wilson in Washington had an optional skate, and he has not been ruled out for the game versus Florida. According to team officials report that Wilson has been out for five games, but he is almost there to return. Meanwhile, there is a report from the coaching staff that Pierre-Luc Dubois will be unavailable till after the Olympic break.The Anaheim Ducks announced that Leo Carlsson, after undergoing a procedure for a thigh injury, will be out for three to five weeks. The young center not only leads the Ducks in points but was also just recently selected to Sweden's Olympic roster, thus making his recovery timeline quite important.Elsewhere, the Philadelphia Flyers reported that goalie Dan Vladar is day-to-day, while the Minnesota Wild added Matt Boldy and Joel Eriksson Ek to their injured list. Moreover, the Senators' goalie situation seems to have improved as Linus Ullmark has come back to training, but there is still no schedule for his playing return.Injuries are forcing several NHL teams to balance between these competing factors. The speed of these players' returns will possibly be one of the factors influencing the results of this season's last segment.","William nylander left the game on thursday night due to a lower-body injury.

The Chiefs’ offensive identity could shift if veteran voices keep leaving

After a disappointing 2025 season, the Kansas City Chiefs require a serious evolution, and head coach Andy Reid is moving quickly to reshape essential parts of his staff. However, new uncertainty has emerged around one of his longest-tenured assistants on the team. According to Chiefs Blitz on X, veteran offensive line coach Andy Heck could reportedly be walking away in the near future, which adds another layer of pressure to an already delicate transition period for the Chiefs.Losing Andy Heck would be more than a routine coaching change, as he has been a central figure in shaping Kansas City’s offensive foundation for many years. He has been instrumental in guiding units through injuries and lineup changes. Thus, it will be an almost impossible task for someone living up to his standards with his replacement.Despite constant shuffling in 2025, the Chiefs’ offensive line finished squarely in the middle of the league and protected the quarterback at a top-ten rate. That consistency helped preserve a competitive edge during a turbulent season. Another thing that makes things more complicated is the news that offensive coordinator Matt Nagy appears poised to move on, and his departure could influence Heck’s decision.If Heck steps away, Kansas City would not just be replacing an offensive line coach, as they would also be losing their de facto run game overseer. This uncertainty comes following the firings of Todd Pinkston and Connor Embree, signalling accountability after a disappointing offensive year.Meanwhile, movement across both sides of the ball continues as assistants interview for promotions or accept college roles. The Chiefs find themselves in a rare moment of flux after missing the postseason for the first time in years. With the potential changes incoming, the Chiefs are in for some significant changes ahead.For Reid, he understands that he must refresh a staff that underperformed while preserving the institutional knowledge that helped build a dynasty. It remains to be seen how he navigates the next few months, which could shape Kansas City’s identity far beyond the 2026 season and come back with guns blazing.","Andy heck could be leaving the kansas city chiefs in the near future, according to chiefs blitz on x. heck has been a central figure in shaping kansas city's offensive foundation for many years.

Winnipeg Jets defenseman Collin Miller to remain away for several weeks due to knee surgery

Winnipeg Jets Practice Report: Colin Miller

Winnipeg Jets defenseman Colin Miller has undergone knee surgery recently and is now listed as week-to-week, as reported by head coach Scott Arniel. This update comes amid ongoing challenges for the Jets' blue line. In his statement, Arniel noted that the procedure was similar to the arthroscopic knee surgery that goaltender Connor Hellebuyck underwent earlier in the season.According to reports, Miller sustained a knee injury during a game against the New Jersey Devils on January 10. This injury forced him to exit early with a lower-body issue. He has already missed his third straight game, including a matchup against Toronto on January 17, 2025. The 33-year-old veteran had recorded one assist, 16 shots on goal, 10 blocked shots, and 25 hits in 15 games this season. Let’s take a look at how it’s going to affect the Winnipeg Jets. Winnipeg Jets defenseman Collin Miller has been sidelined due to a lower-body injury, forcing the Jets to finish Sunday's game against the New Jersey Devils with just five defensemen. Reports suggest Miller has been ruled out for the remainder of the contest with a lower-body injury, the team said.Actually, the six-foot-one defender was injured in last Sunday’s 4-3 win over the New Jersey Devils following an awkward collision with Arseny Grisyuk. Following this, he went hard into the boards in the first period and had to be helped off the ice before immediately heading down the tunnel.However, Miller came out before the second period to give it a try, but turned around quickly and limped to the locker room, as per The Winnipeg Free Press' Ken Wiebe.Meanwhile, he is undergoing a similar surgery procedure like Hellebuyck. Reports suggest that Hellebuyck was initially given a timeline of four-to-six weeks, but returned to game action for the Jets just three weeks following the surgery.Besides, Miller has one assist, 16 shots on net, 25 hits, 10 blocked shots, and a minus-8 rating. In 15 games played this season, Miller has recorded one assist while averaging 13:45 of ice time. However, it has not been decided yet when Miller will be returning to the team.Apart from Miller, defensemen like Neal Pionk and Haydn Fleury continue to recover from a frightening incident earlier this season who suffered multiple injuries. With three regular defensemen sidelined, Winnipeg has been forced to dip into its organizational depth.","Winnipeg jets defenseman colin miller has undergone knee surgery and is now listed as week-to-week.

Mina Kimes, Ryan Clark, Hannah Storm, Dan Orlovsky, and Marcus Spears, ESPN’s NFL Live crew, all picked the same team, just as they did before when the Philadelphia Eagles faced the San Francisco 49ers. Who did they pick then? Unanimously, the Eagles. And what happened? They lost to the 49ers [19-23].Is that the fate of the CJ Stroud-led Houston Texans on the Gillette Stadium gridiron against the New England Patriots? Only time will tell. For now, let’s check out cybercitizens’ reactions to Houston’s unanimous vote.“No, not with Nico Collins out. I know Houston’s D is good, but I don’t think they’re gonna beat the pats,” declared one X user. Texans wide receiver Nico Collins is out with a concussion for Sunday’s AFC Divisional Round against New England. He did not practice all week. Christian Kirk will replace him as WR1.Another commented, “It’s a bad omen when Dan Orlovsky and Ryan Clark are on the same side [crystal ball emoji].” The two analysts often have opposing perspectives and fiery debates.A third user said, “A unanimous panel pick is the ultimate bulletin board material for an opponent.”It just shows Houston is more than capable of defeating New England.A fourth user shared a screenshot of the NFL Live crew unanimously picking the Eagles, with the caption, “Remember this?”A fifth user is waiting for the crew to realize New England would win: “Can’t wait for the moment they all start pretending they knew the Patriots would win [two crying emojis].”A user said NFL MVP-candidate Drake Maye would put pressure on Houston’s defense: “31-17 Pats, Texans gonna get exposed on defense by the MVP [fire emoji].”Another user sided with the Texans, but after seeing the crew unanimously pick Houston, chose New England instead: “I was thinking Houston as well but after seeing all them pick Houston it will be the patriots winning.”A user believes that even though Bill Belichick is no longer leading the Patriots, Stefon Diggs’ “nobody believes in us” fiery pregame speeches will help beat the Texans:“The full panel sweep is the ultimate kiss of death in this league. Patriots being 3-point favorites at home and nobody taking them is wild. Bill Belichick might be gone but the “nobody believes in us” energy in Foxborough is gonna be through the roof now.”Another user supposedly made fun of the crew, saying, “And they get paid for this [laughing face emoji] Go pats.” A third user wrote, “Pats about to make ‘em pay for that love.”Mina Kimes exclaimed, ""No way! I thought when Nico Collins was out, everybody would change it but me.

Steelers Nation sends clear message after Mike Tomlin’s exit from Pittsburgh,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/steelers-nation-sends-clear-message-after-mike-tomlins-exit-from-pittsburgh/articleshow/126556595.cms,"Mike Tomlin steps down as Steelers head coach and fans gave mixed reactions(Image via: Getty Images)

Fan reaction underscores why change felt necessary for Mike Tomlin

Mike Tomlin’s exit from Pittsburgh did not spark chaos or outrage. Instead, it brought clarity. Recently, Steelers Nation responded with a steady, unified tone that revealed exactly where the fan base stood after nearly two decades under the same leadership.For years, Tomlin symbolized stability. He delivered winning seasons, maintained control inside the locker room, and kept Pittsburgh competitive in an unforgiving league. However, as time passed, postseason disappointment slowly reshaped expectations. While regular-season success continued, January failures began to define the conversation. As a result, when Tomlin stepped away, fans did not push back. Instead, they understood the timing.The clearest measure of sentiment surfaced on Jan 16, 2026, when the Essentially Sports NFL Huddle poll asked whether Tomlin stepping down was the right decision. Out of 3,289 total votes, 2,131 fans answered yes, amounting to 64.79 percent.More importantly, the margin reflected acceptance rather than anger. Fans did not dismiss Tomlin’s accomplishments. Instead, they acknowledged that results had stalled.Pittsburgh lost 7 straight playoff games between Jan 2018 and Jan 2025, and with each loss, confidence in its postseason direction eroded.Fan comments explained that shift in thinking. One fan wrote, “Time for a change; everybody knows y’all plays, you're killing the defense, keeping them on the field all day, because all the offense does is 3 and out.” That reaction pointed directly to frustration with conservative offensive strategy and the repeated burden placed on the defense. Another fan chimes in, “He is an awful coach. When is the last Super Bowl he won?”While extreme, that comment shows how distant Super Bowl XLIII now feels to fans who judge success by championships.In the midst of chaos, ESPN's Mike Greenberg on ""Get Up"" sent a bold message to Steelers fans, saying, ""I'm telling you, 'Be careful what you wish for. '"" Because I have lived the other side of this.""Meanwhile, Tomlin addressed his decision privately during a team meeting on Jan. 14, according to league reports. Although the Steelers organization has not shared details publicly, focus quickly shifted toward what comes next.The following day, NFL Network insider Ian Rapoport discussed Tomlin’s future during an NFL Network broadcast. “There have been murmurs for a long time that Mike Tomlin would step away and then do television,” Rapoport said during the segment. “That interest is real.”Consequently, many fans appear comfortable with that outcome. Veteran head coach Tomlin’s command, clarity, and presence have long stood out during press conferences, making a transition to television feel natural.Ultimately, Tomlin leaves Pittsburgh Steelers with a 193-114-2 record and a Super Bowl title won at age 36, the youngest head coach to achieve that milestone. Those achievements remain respected.Still, Steelers Nation sent a clear message. The appreciation remained. The expectations evolved. And the transition felt necessary.Also Read: Mike Tomlin leaves Steelers after 19 seasons, Art Rooney opens up on coaching search and future goals","Pittsburgh steelers head coach mike tomlin stepped down after 19 seasons.

Mike Tomlin Steelers legacy extends far beyond wins and losses



Mike Tomlin Steelers news hit the NFL like a thunderclap this week, not because of scandal or failure, but because of legacy. After nearly two decades of unbroken competitiveness, the Pittsburgh Steelers suddenly found themselves without the one constant that defined their modern era. The timing made it sting more. The setting made it louder. And the silence that followed said even more than the announcement itself.The decision came after a bruising Wild Card loss to C.J. Stroud and the Houston Texans, closing a chapter that rarely dipped and never collapsed. Nineteen seasons. Zero losing records. A Super Bowl ring earned early, followed by years of relevance in a league built to forget yesterday. In Pittsburgh, consistency is currency, and Tomlin printed it for almost two decades.Days after the news settled, the most revealing reaction did not come from analysts or former players. It came from home. Kiya Tomlin, his wife, broke her silence through a series of Instagram Stories that reframed the moment away from football results and toward personal impact.“Incredibly proud” is how she described her husband’s journey, pointing to what mattered most once the headsets came off.“Over the past few days the messages and testimonies shared by current and former players — the men who knew him best — have been deeply moving. They’ve affirmed what I’ve always known to be true about his purpose and character,” she wrote.Her words shifted the focus from trophies to people. She explained that his purpose was “to help young men become great individuals,” achieved through “Coaching and fatherhood.” That, she said, defined his real success.She described his “true legacy” as “the men who passed through his locker rooms over more than 30 years of coaching, [their] own children, and hundreds of young people across the region he personally poured into.” She called it “his coaching tree” and “the achievement we are most proud of.”Kiya also acknowledged Pittsburgh directly, closing her message with gratitude.“Thank you, Pittsburgh. Thank you for your support, your words of kindness, and the warm reception our family has received over the last 19 years.”What comes next remains open. Mike Tomlin has stepped away for now, leaving the door ajar rather than closed. Television work is possible. A return someday is not ruled out. But for the moment, the story is not about his next job. It is about a rare NFL career that ended with dignity, purpose, and respect intact.

Tyson Gay's setbacks, personal loss, and recent updates

Tyson Gay is one of the fastest sprinters the United States has ever produced. Known for his explosive speed and smooth running style, Gay made history by becoming the fastest American in the 100 meters. He dominated the world stage in the late 2000s, won major titles, and became a symbol of U.S. sprinting during an era ruled by global stars.Tyson Gay’s current net worth is estimated to be between $6 million and $15 million as of 2026. Celebrity Net Worth lists his wealth at $6 million, while some 2025 sports finance reports suggest it may have reached $12–15 million at its peak, mainly from Adidas endorsement deals, race winnings, and performance bonuses earned before his 2013 doping suspension.His income came from prize money, sponsorships, appearance fees, and bonuses during his peak years in track and field. Gay also earned from brand deals, mainly with Adidas, before his career ended.Tyson Gay was born on August 9, 1982, in Lexington, Kentucky. He grew up in a family that loved sports. His grandmother ran track in college, his mother was a sprinter, and his older sister Tiffany was also a fast runner in school.Tyson has often said his sister pushed him to run faster while growing up.He later attended the University of Arkansas, where he studied sociology and marketing. While there, he became the school’s first NCAA 100-meter champion and helped Arkansas win a national title. His college success played a big role in launching his professional career.Tyson Gay is best known for holding the American record in the 100 meters at 9.69 seconds, set in 2009. This time ties him as the second-fastest man in history, behind Usain Bolt. According to World Athletics, Gay remains the fastest American sprinter ever.His biggest moment came at the 2007 World Championships in Osaka, where he won three gold medals in the 100 m, 200 m, and 4×100 m relay. He became only the second man to win all three events at a single World Championships. He also won the IAAF World Athlete of the Year award in 2007 and multiple ESPY Awards.In 2013, Gay tested positive for a banned substance and accepted responsibility. He was suspended and later lost his 2012 Olympic silver medal. Adidas paused its sponsorship following the suspension, which affected its earnings.In the year 2016, Gay endured a heart-wrenching loss when his 15-year-old daughter, Trinity Gay, was shot dead in Kentucky. This occurrence left a profound impact on him and ultimately pushed him to become a public speaker on the issue of gun violence.In recent years, Tyson Gay has stayed away from professional racing. As of 2025, there are no reports of coaching roles or official athletics positions, according to USA Track & Field. He keeps a low public profile and remains one of the most respected names in American sprinting history.","Tyson gay’s current net worth is estimated to be between $6 million and $15 million as of 2026.

Travis Kelce reportedly causing tension with Taylor Swift as insiders hint at stress over life after football,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/travis-kelce-reportedly-causing-tension-with-taylor-swift-as-insiders-hint-at-stress-over-life-after-football/articleshow/126544575.cms,"Taylor Swift is reportedly concerned about Travis Kelce’s emotional well-being as he considers retirement from the NFL. Insiders say football has long defined Kelce’s identity, making the transition difficult. While opportunities await beyond the game, the uncertainty has created stress. Kelce has acknowledged the challenge publicly while evaluating his physical readiness and future.

Why Taylor Swift is concerned about Travis Kelce’s next chapter

The conversation around Travis Kelce has quietly shifted from wins and playoff runs to something far more personal. After years of structuring life around training camps, late-season pushes, and Super Bowl expectations, the Kansas City tight end now stands at a crossroads that extends well beyond football. Those close to him say the decision is no longer just about stats or trophies. It is about identity.At the center of that reflection is Taylor Swift , who is reportedly focused less on whether Kelce can still play and more on how he will feel once the game no longer defines his routine. Football has shaped his purpose for most of his adult life. Walking away from that can leave a silence that success outside the sport does not always fill.Sources describe Taylor Swift as deeply supportive but realistic about the emotional shift retirement can bring. One insider explained her concern clearly, saying, ""She thinks he has a huge world waiting for him outside football, but also worries how he’ll fare emotionally when he does hang up his cleats. It’s been the cornerstone of his life for so long now.""Travis Kelce has not avoided the topic. Speaking recently on the New Heights podcast, he admitted the decision weighs heavily as he evaluates his health and long-term readiness.His words showed both hesitation and passion for the grind he knows so well.""And I don't know, it's a tough thing to navigate,"" Kelce said. ""But at the same time, you know, I think if my body can heal up and rest up and I can feel confident that I can go out there and give it another 18, 20, 21-week run. I think I would do it in a heartbeat.""The discussion has reached the top of the organization. Kansas City Chiefs head coach Andy Reid acknowledged the uncertainty while defending Kelce’s ability. “We all love Travis,"" Reid said.""Trav can still play. I’m not trying questioning that part or any of it. I’m not trying to avoid your question, but I know there’s time. Last year, I was asked kind of the same thing. We’ve got a little bit of time to figure everything out, and so does Trav.”Even his brother Jason Kelce has weighed in, offering blunt opinions about the season and the road ahead. For now, Kelce is balancing recovery, reflection, and preparations for his Rhode Island wedding. Whether football remains part of that future is still unanswered, but the emotional stakes are now impossible to ignore.Also Read: Travis Kelce appears conflicted on staying in the NFL as Taylor Swift future pulls him elsewhere","Taylor swift reportedly concerned about travis kelce's emotional well-being as he considers retirement from the nfl.

The end of the NFL season can feel abrupt, especially for teams with playoff expectations. For the Los Angeles Chargers, that reality arrived quickly after their wild-card loss to the New England Patriots. While the defeat closed the book on another challenging year for Justin Herbert , the week unfolded very differently for someone close to him.As Herbert processed the disappointment of an early playoff exit, his girlfriend, Madison Beer, was celebrating a major career moment. The singer released her new album, Locket, on Friday, and the rollout came with a highly visible spotlight. An advertisement for the album appeared on a Times Square jumbotron in New York City, marking a milestone moment in her music career.Beer shared photos of the Times Square display on her Instagram story, pairing the photos with her song “For the Night.” The timing stood out. While Herbert’s season had just ended in frustration, Beer was enjoying one of the biggest promotional moments of her career. The Chargers’ playoff run ended with a loss to New England, despite the team making it back to the postseason. Herbert struggled to find consistency during the game and finished with 159 passing yards.Afterward, he addressed his performance honestly in his postgame comments. ""I didn't play weel enough and didn't make any plays,"" Herbert said. ""We let the defense down today.""The loss marked Herbert’s third career playoff appearance, but once again, the Chargers failed to reach the divisional round. It added to the growing pressure surrounding a quarterback who has delivered strong regular-season play but has yet to make a deep postseason run.Earlier in the week, Beer had another milestone moment when she appeared on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. The performance came just ahead of the album release and marked her debut on the late-night stage. She later shared photos and videos from the appearance on Instagram with a caption that captured her excitement. ""oh what a night! bad enough debut on @fallontonight""For the show, Beer wore an off-white halter-neck dress with a fitted silhouette and a high slit, drawing attention as she promoted her new music. Herbert and Beer confirmed their relationship publicly in October, when they were seen sharing a kiss on the sidelines before a Chargers game against Washington. Since then, Beer has regularly been spotted supporting Herbert at games, including a Week 17 appearance against the Houston Texans.As Herbert heads into another offseason focused on improvement and answers, Beer’s career continues to gain momentum.","Madison beer released her new album, locket, on friday.

Nicol Delago’s breakthrough and Lindsey Vonn’s experience light up Tarvisio



Italy’s alpine ski team continues its strong run with less than three weeks left before the Milan-Cortina Winter Olympics. On Saturday, Nicol Delago delivered a landmark moment by winning her first World Cup race in the downhill on home snow in Tarvisio. The result added to the growing confidence around the Italian camp as Olympic preparations enter the final stretch.The race also underlined the remarkable form of Lindsey Vonn . At 41, the American legend finished third, securing her fifth podium in five downhill races this season. With the Olympics approaching in Italy, both Delago’s breakthrough victory and Vonn’s consistency sent a strong message to the rest of the field.Nicol Delago topped the timing sheets with a winning margin of 0.20 seconds over Germany’s Kira Weidle-Winkelmann. Lindsey Vonn followed closely, just 0.26 seconds behind the Italian. Delago had shown strong signs earlier by leading the final training session on Friday. Until now, her best World Cup results had been three second-place and two third-place finishes. Her younger sister, Nadia Delago, who won Olympic bronze in downhill at the 2022 Beijing Games, finished 10th in this race.The Tarvisio downhill returned to the World Cup calendar for the first time in 15 years. Vonn was one of only two skiers in the field with prior racing experience on the course. In her earlier appearances at Tarvisio across different disciplines, she had recorded two victories and four second-place finishes. After the race, Vonn explained that while the track itself felt unfamiliar, she clearly remembered the electric atmosphere.Talking about the race, it was quite challenging due to fog hanging over the middle section of the course, reducing visibility. Delago briefly lost control when her skis split apart in the fog but recovered quickly. She then increased her lead at every split and celebrated joyfully at the finish. Vonn posted the fastest speeds at both checkpoints, reaching 136.3 kph, but a slight detour into fresh snow cost her time.In the downhill standings, Vonn extended her lead to 144 points over Emma Aicher. She also moved up to third overall with 510 points. The Olympic downhill in Cortina is set for February 8, with a super-G scheduled in Tarvisio on Sunday.","Nicol delago wins her first world cup downhill on home snow in tarvisio.

Cardi B’s post-rhinoplasty look

When Grammy-winning rapper Cardi B was spotted in a Gillette Stadium VIP suite, cheering on her boyfriend Stefon Diggs with New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft, we knew something was amiss. Something was pin pointing to their shared history. But who would go back and turn the pages of history? No worries. We’ve done that for all.The “Bodak Yellow” singer was spotted dancing with the Patriots owner at a Fanatics party during Super Bowl LIII weekend in Atlanta in 2019. Cardi was scheduled to perform at Michael Rubin’s Fanatics party at the College Football Hall of Fame.The “Am I the Drama?” creator co-headlined the event with rapper Meek Mill, who partnered with Kraft on Reform Alliance, a criminal justice reform organization supported by Jay-Z and Van Jones.In a 2019 appearance on 98.5 The Sports Hub’s “Toucher and Rich” program [now, it’s Toucher & Hardy], Kraft discussed forging relationships with the hip-hop community.“Honest to goodness, I don’t force it,” Kraft said. “We live in a world where all of us have to find ways to build bridges and connect with everybody. There’s good in every situation, and you try to understand it and relate to it.That’s how you understand how the world works, when you try to keep people together to win championships, which is not easy, guys.”The Patriots had beaten the Los Angeles Rams 13-3 and won Super Bowl LIII. It was the sixth and final Super Bowl win for Tom Brady as a Patriot. He won his seventh Super Bowl as a Buccaneer. Anyway, coming back to Kraft and Cardi B. What happened at the party?Kraft danced to Cardi B’s performance on her song “Money.” Describing the dance with Offset’s ex-wife, Kraft said, “Meek Mill kept saying, ‘You gotta go out there. You gotta go out there. They don’t think you can dance.’Once someone puts you on the defensive, they don’t expect me to follow the beat, not that I had much rhythm. I don’t think most of my colleagues expect to see me Super Bowl weekend hanging with Cardi B and trying to show her a few moves.”Dov Kleiman, an NFL aggregator, shared a wholesome picture of Kraft and Cardi taken six years after their first meeting. Notable changes: The owner has reportedly lost a few pounds, while the “I Like It” singer is sporting her post-Rhinoplasty look.Diggs’ partner underwent a nose job [rhinoplasty] in 2020. She tried non-surgical nose fillers around 2018-2019, but they made her nose look longer and wider. So, she had corrective surgery in 2020 because the fillers backfired.“I always felt like I had a big nose,” Cardi said via The Glow Memo’s Michelle Villett. “Even before I was famous, I was like, ‘Damn, I’ve got my daddy’s nose.’ I was always afraid to do my nose, and I finally took the step.”Also Read: Stefon Diggs scans the stands searching for Cardi B after New England Patriots’ big 42-10 win over New York Jets",New england patriots owner robert kraft and rapper cardi b were spotted together at super bowl liii.
