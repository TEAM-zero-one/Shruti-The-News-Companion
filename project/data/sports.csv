Virat Kohli's childhood coach makes a big statement on 2027 ODI World Cup

INSPIRED BY

AXAR PATEL

NEW DELHI: Vishal Jayswal was an unknown name until he claimed the most prized wicket of his cricketing career — Virat Kohli - a dismissal that instantly etched his name into the record books.Jayswal tempted Kohli out of the crease, spinning the ball sharply past the outside edge and the wicketkeeper made no mistake and whipped off the bails to send the well-set Delhi batter back for 77.While Gujarat narrowly lost the thriller by seven runs, the moment belonged to the young spinner, who was embraced by teammates for his unforgettable breakthrough.As the rest of the Gujarat players headed back to the dressing room, Jayswal lingered. He requested the umpire for the match ball — the one with which he had dismissed Kohli.Ball in hand, he nervously walked towards the Delhi dressing room. Spotting Kohli, he hesitated. Kohli noticed him, smiled, and said: “Aaja, aaja” (Come in).A nervous Jayswal pulled the ball out of his pocket and said: “Bhaiya, ball pe ek autograph chahiye” (Please give me an autograph).Kohli put his kit aside, asked Jayswal to sit down, and made him comfortable before signing the ball.“Achha ball daalta hai. Hard work karta rah. Opportunity aayega, wait kar and mehnat kar [You bowl really well. Keep working hard.Your opportunity will come — be patient and keep putting in the effort],” Kohli told him.Jayswal admitted the pressure of bowling to a modern day great.“I didn’t have any specific plan against him. He’s a legend of the game. Just bowling to him is a huge moment, and there’s immense pressure when he’s at the crease. I spoke to him and he gave me a lot of tips, how to remain calm under pressure, fitness etc,” Jayswal said, during an exclusive chat with TimesofIndia.com.“Of course, I’m really happy to have dismissed him. Having a wicket like that next to your name is very special,” the spin allrounder said.Like Axar Patel, Jayswal hails from Nadiad in Gujarat’s Kheda district and began his cricket journey at the same academy where Team India’s T20I vice-captain took his first steps.Jayswal lost his father when he was just eight months old.As he grew older, cricket became his passion, and he told his mother of his dream to become a professional cricketer. The road was far from easy, but his mother stood firmly by him.“The journey was extremely tough, but whatever I am today is because of my mother,” said Jayswal, who finished as the highest wicket-taker in the 2022–23 CK Nayudu Trophy.“Taking her to the awards function was one of the proudest moments of my life.”According to Jayswal, Axar has played a crucial role in shaping his career.“Axar bhai has helped me immensely — from my cricket kit to jerseys and bats. I look up to him as an inspiration and mentor,” he said.“I’ve always wanted to be a spin-bowling all-rounder like him. He teaches me how to be a game-changer — when to attack, how to control the run rate, and how to stay mentally strong.”Recalling Axar’s advice, Jayswal added with a smile: “He always tells me: ‘Batting mein dhyaan sirf ball pe rakho, aur bowling mein batsman ke pair aur wickets pe.’ Those tips have helped me a lot.”",Virat kohli's childhood coach makes a big statement on 2027 odi world cup.

Sauce Gardner latest injury update: Colts cornerback missed three games but listed questionable against Jacksonville Jaguars,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/sauce-gardner-latest-injury-update-colts-cornerback-missed-three-games-but-listed-questionable-against-jacksonville-jaguars/articleshow/126204144.cms,"(Image via Getty: Sauce Gardner and DeForest Buckner)

Sauce Gardner may return while DeForest Buckner is out for the final two games

The playoff picture for late Jim Irsay’s team, the Indianapolis Colts, looks bleak right now. They need to beat the Jacksonville Jaguars in Week 17 and the Houston Texans in Week 18. That’s not all. Another condition affects their chances: the Texans must lose to the Los Angeles Chargers in Week 17. They must also lose against the Colts in Week 18.With pressure mounting, an injured player who was given three weeks to recover from a calf strain, which fortunately did not become a season-ending Achilles tear, could make his much-terribly-much-needed comeback. This would further bolster the Philip Rivers-led Colts. Star cornerback Sauce Gardner is reportedly scheduled to return from a left calf injury for Sunday’s showdown against the Jaguars. In the Friday’s injury report, he was listed as questionable.The 25-year-old cornerback had been sidelined since Week 13, leaving the Colts vs. Texans game midway through after just two snaps. At the postgame press conference, Gardner described the injury, saying, “It felt like I got shot in the calf.”Further testing revealed it was only a calf injury, not a more serious Achilles injury. He needed “some time” to recover.James Boyd of The Athletic recently reported that Gardner was practicing for the first time in weeks. According to the latest injury report, he did not practice on Wednesday, was a limited participant on Thursday, and practiced full on Friday. He was listed questionable for Sunday’s matchup against the Jaguars.Now that he’s recovered, Colts coach Shane Steichen spoke highly about Sauce’s return on Friday: “To get him back out there with his passion and what he brings to our football team on the backend will be huge.”Gardner was traded to the Indianapolis Colts from the New York Jets in November and had played only two games for the Colts.At this crucial moment, the Colts need to strengthen their secondary, especially with star defensive tackle DeForest Buckner’s season-ending neck surgery. Buckner is headed to injured reserve for the second time due to aggravated neck injury.“Obviously an unfortunate situation,” Steichen said. “He embodies everything you want in a pro. He’s as good as it gets, as tough as it gets. [He] wants to be out there for his team, obviously, hopeful…the procedure will be good and [he’ll] get on the field for next year.”Buckner will reportedly flly to Panama for stem cell injections in his neck to help him recover from the herniated disk and nerve issue that made him feel like he “kind of lost all strength on my left side.”Four others were ruled out for Sunday’s home matchup against Jacksonville: starting center Tanor Bortolini [concussion], backup tight end Drew Ogletree [neck], rotational defensive end JT Tuimoloau [oblique], and returner Anthony Gould [foot].Also Read: Philip Rivers car collection: Inside the newest Colts QB’s lavish $200K customized Cadillac and Ford models","Sauce gardner is reportedly set to return from a calf injury for sunday's game against the jaguars.

Maxx Crosby met Rachel Washburn in Eastern Michigan University

Rachel Washburn stood by Maxx Crosby in his journey from alcohol addiction to sobriety

The 28-year-old star defensive end for the Las Vegas Raiders, Maxx Crosby , was recently ruled out of the Week 17 game against the New York Giants due to a lingering knee injury. He was unhappy with the decision.As NFL Insider Jay Glazer put it: The Raiders told Maxx Crosby they want to shut him down for the last two games. Crosby, who has played with injuries for much of the year, vehemently disagreed and has left the building, @nflonfox has learned. This could lead to questions about his future in Vegas.Crosby is going through a lot right now, but his steady support at home, his wife Rachel Washburn [now Crosby], will perhaps help calm his nerves since she understands what being a competitive player means. Let’s learn more about Rachel, the former soccer player and star athlete of the Eastern Michigan Eagles. But first, how did they meet?Maxx met Rachel while they attended Eastern Michigan University in 2016. Rachel was a star collegiate soccer player, and Maxx was building his football career. He was drafted in 2019. They started dating in college and stayed together through every change in Crosby’s career. They married in a lavish Nevada wedding in Boulder City in March 2023. They have a three-year-old daughter, Ella Rose Crosby, whom Crosby calls his “world.”The NFL WAG’s full name is Rachel Rose Washburn. She is the daughter of Mark and Trisha Washburn and has one brother, Chad, and one sister, Ashley. Rachel was a star on the soccer field. She led her Hartland High School soccer team to a district championship as team captain in her senior year.She was named Defensive Player of the Year all four years in high school and was a Hartland Eagle scholar athlete.The mom-of-one also accumulated all-district, all-county, and all-conference [Kensington Lakes Athletic Association] honors during her high school days. She later entered Eastern Michigan University, where she was named to the Loyola Invitational All-Tournament Team in 2015. She recorded career-high stats in her final year as an Eagle. She graduated from the University in 2017. She shone on the soccer gridiron as well as in the classroom. She majored in Sports Management.Five years ago, as his NFL career was beginning, Crosby reportedly became addicted to alcohol, and Rachel helped him through the darker days. “She’s my rock,” Crosby told PEOPLE in February 2025. “I wouldn’t be here without her. I was living a wild life, a fast life, and addiction is real.It’s a disease, something that was hard on me. At the end of the day, you always hear people say you can’t change, people don’t change, they are who they are. I firmly believe that’s so false. You’ve got to be able to go through hard times if you really want it.If you really want to be together, you have to go through hell and back. We’ve both been through a lot together, but it only made us stronger. I had to go to a dark place and live through it. It made me so much stronger and a better person.I love the person I am, and the person I look in the mirror and see now, and I wasn’t able to say that when I was younger, going through what I went through, and that means more than anything.”In March 2025, Crosby marked five years sober and thanked his “partner in crime,” wife Rachel, who helped him emerge victorious.Also Read: NFL legend and Las Vegas Raiders part-owner Tom Brady supposedly passed over Shedeur Sanders for being “very self-promotional”","Rachel washburn is the wife of las vegas raiders defensive end maxx crosby.

Maple Leafs face midseason challenge with consistency and leadership under pressure

Elliotte Friedman talks Connor McDavid, Kirill Kaprizov and more.

The Toronto Maple Leafs face a difficult few games beginning this week. The performance of this team has not been very consistent recently, and raises some questions as to how consistent they can remain going forward. The added importance of each game helps to make the ability for the Leafs to bounce back from poor performances over the next couple of weeks something everyone will be paying attention to.Sportsnet’s Elliotte Friedman was blunt ahead of the short break, warning that the Maple Leafs are headed towards a lot of very uncomfortable conversations if they don’t sort this out. His comment highlights the immediate need for the team to fix their inconsistencies and strengthen leadership on the ice and in the locker room.The team is now under greater scrutiny than ever, amid NHL playoff pressure, with respect to leadership, performance and accountability. Outside of a few defensive breakdowns, inconsistent goaltending, poor special team, and a lack of consistency in their top forward lines; it has been evident that many areas of concern will need immediate attention by this team. In all likelihood, coaches will need to look at making changes in their tactical strategy, line combinations and roles for their players in order to create the balance and consistency that is needed to be a successful team.Very few of the top forwards have been able to find the chemistry that is needed to build a consistent top line, and many pairs of defense have had difficulties keeping the opposing teams to a minimum in scoring chances. Every game is magnified even more than before, thus forcing the management to make some difficult decisions behind the scenes in order to maintain or prevent a downfall from occurring.The execution of plays on the ice will be very critical. Players must focus all their efforts on playing to the best of their ability, while coaches should concentrate on the tactical adjustments made to apply them correctly during each play. Leadership from within the locker room will dictate how well the players hold each other accountable and continue to build the structure of the organization as they grow together.If not addressed quickly, the Maple Leafs could face a difficult stretch. How the team performs in the coming games will determine whether they can regain stability and build momentum for the rest of the season. Elliotte Friedman has emphasized Maple leafs to act quickly to improve consistency and reinforce accountability among players if they hope to avoid a midseason slide.Also Read: Phillip Danault trade rumors: Elliotte Friedman weighs in on LA Kings center amid slow NHL season","Elliotte friedman warns maple leafs must act fast to fix inconsistency.maple leafs face midseason challenge with consistency and leadership under pressure.

Brayan Bello draws trade interest despite Red Sox extension



“We have to be ready to move players under control if it helps the roster,”

Brayan Bello is suddenly at the center of MLB trade talk as rival teams call the Boston Red Sox to ask about his availability. At the same time, the Toronto Blue Jays are pushing hard to land Kyle Tucker, with more big-name decisions possibly coming next. League chatter picked up this week as front offices across baseball looked ahead to a busy offseason.Brayan Bello’s name popping up has surprised many fans because Boston just locked him up last year. Still, league insiders say teams are watching closely. Toronto, meanwhile, is not hiding its plans. The Blue Jays want a star who can change the lineup, and Kyle Tucker sits right at the top of their wish list.According to The Athletic reporters Will Sammon and Ken Rosenthal, multiple rival teams have contacted the Boston Red Sox about Brayan Bello in recent weeks.The report made it clear the calls came from other teams, not from Boston shopping the pitcher. In March 2024, the Red Sox signed Brayan Bello to a six-year, $55 million extension.The deal also includes a $21 million club option for the 2030 season and a $1 million buyout. During the 2025 season, Bello posted a 3.35 ERA and threw a career-high 166.2 innings, making him one of Boston’s most reliable starters.Earlier this year, Red Sox chief baseball officer Craig Breslow said the team would stay open-minded if tough decisions were needed.Breslow said at the time. If Boston doubts Bello’s long-term production, they could listen more closely, especially if the return helps fill other needs.According to MLB insider Jon Heyman, the Toronto Blue Jays remain very interested in Kyle Tucker.Tucker visited the team’s facility in Dunedin, Florida, a few weeks ago, which only fueled speculation. ESPN projections suggest Tucker could command a massive 11-year, $418 million contract.Toronto is also looking at one more big bat. Reports say the Blue Jays are weighing a move for either Bo Bichette or Alex Bregman.Bo Bichette is a homegrown star who plays the middle infield, while Bregman brings steady power and defense at third base. Both offer similar offensive value, but the fit and cost could decide the final call.Also Read: MLB Trade Rumors: MLB Insiders Predicting Kazuma Okamoto Could Surpass $34 Million Murakami Deal As Orioles Eye JoJo Romero","Brayan bello is suddenly at the center of mlb trade talk as rival teams call the boston red sox to ask about his availability.

Travis Kelce has spent more than a decade taking hits on NFL fields, but lately, some of the biggest changes in his life are happening far from the stadium, inside the kitchen he now shares with Taylor Swift.During a festive episode of New Heights, the Kansas City Chiefs star offered fans an unexpectedly intimate look at how their relationship has reshaped his routines, habits, and even his health. What started as a shared love of cooking has evolved into something deeper, revealing a softer, more grounded side of the Super Bowl champion as he prepares for life beyond football.Travis Kelce revealed that one of his favorite recent moments with Taylor Swift came from a surprisingly practical Christmas gift: a bread slicer. He explained that he bought it because Swift has “been throwing together so much sourdough,” a hobby that has quickly become central to their home life.The gift wasn’t just thoughtful, it was symbolic of how much time they now spend cooking together and paying attention to what they eat.That shift, Kelce admitted, has had real benefits. He credited Swift’s cooking for helping him eat cleaner and feel better overall, joking proudly, “Gosh, I’ve got the best gut health there is.I love you, Tay.” For an elite athlete known for his durability, the comment struck a chord with fans who see it as another sign of how supportive and practical their partnership has become.Jason Kelce chimed in with his own seal of approval, noting that “slicing is a big deal,” especially when it comes to fresh bread. Meanwhile, Swift has fully embraced her new culinary fixation, admitting, “The sourdough has taken over my life in a huge way. I’m really talking about bread 60 percent of the time now.”Beyond the laughs, the exchange painted a picture of a couple building a life through shared rituals, proof that even global superstars find meaning in simple routines, warm kitchens, and freshly baked bread.Also Read: Taylor Swift reflects on a heartbreaking cancer diagnosis during the Eras Tour and how Travis Kelce became her source of happiness","Travis kelce shared how his relationship with taylor swift has transformed his routines, particularly through their shared love of cooking.

Christian Watson’s availability could impact Packers’ Week 17 game against Ravens



Christian Watson’s name on the Green Bay Packers’ final injury report raised eyebrows, but the situation isn’t quite as alarming as it first looked. The wide receiver was listed as questionable ahead of Saturday night’s matchup against the Baltimore Ravens, yet his status isn’t tied to a new injury concern. Instead, Watson has simply been dealing with an illness that kept him out of Thursday’s practice.The Packers have had a bug working its way through the locker room this week, and Watson just happened to be the latest to feel it. Because his absence came midweek, he still had time to recover before kickoff. Illness can always be unpredictable, but it’s usually easier to manage than something like a soft-tissue setback this late in the season. Green Bay will get final clarity when the inactives are released at 6:30 p.m. ET, but internally there’s far less panic than a typical injury designation might create.For Green Bay, Watson’s availability matters. He remains a reliable target when healthy and gives the offense a vertical threat they don’t easily replace. With Jordan Love already ruled out due to concussion protocol, the Packers will turn to backup quarterback Malik Willis, and surrounding him with as many playmakers as possible becomes essential against a tough Baltimore defense.Watson’s presence stretches coverage, creates spacing, and forces the Ravens to respect the deep ball, which naturally helps the run game and underneath routes.From a bigger-picture standpoint, the Packers aren’t playing with desperation. They’ve already locked in a playoff berth, which takes away some anxiety around availability decisions. Even so, these final regular-season games still matter. Green Bay can improve playoff seeding with a strong finish, and having Watson on the field gives them a better chance of doing that. It’s a balance between managing health and competing to strengthen postseason positioning.So while the headline of “questionable” might have initially sounded worrying, this is closer to routine late-season maintenance than crisis territory. If the illness clears in time, Watson should be able to suit up and contribute. If not, the decision will simply be about keeping him fresh for when the games truly count, but for now, this feels like a situation trending more toward manageable than problematic.Also Read: Is Christian Watson playing in week 16 vs the Bears?

Chris Tanev ’s return helps Toronto Maple Leafs regain defensive control



Tanev stretchered off after awkward hit - Full Incident

The Toronto Maple Leafs went into the holiday break under tension, carrying the weight of a rough few weeks and a major coaching move. Five losses in six games had turned up the pressure, and the firing of assistant coach Marc Savard only added to the noise around the team. They badly needed something to steady the room.Their 6–3 win over the Pittsburgh Penguins offered that bit of relief. More importantly, it marked the return of veteran defenseman Chris Tanev, who came back from injury and immediately gave Toronto something they had been missing: calm, predictable defending. Even with a little rust, he made the game feel manageable again for the team around him.Tanev didn’t come back trying to do too much. He simply played the kind of hockey he’s known for: strong positioning, smart first passes, and clear decisions in the defensive zone. That helped Joseph Woll settle in as well, and his 29 saves looked more comfortable than what Toronto’s goalies have faced in recent weeks. For head coach Craig Berube, it meant having a defense group that finally had structure. He could sit Simon Benoit, lean on Philippe Myers when needed, and, most importantly, trust that Tanev would handle tough minutes without turning games chaotic.The win sends Toronto into the break with a little positivity, but the bigger picture remains challenging.Their record sits at 16-15-5, last in the Atlantic Division and 15th in the Eastern Conference. They are still within reach of a playoff spot, just five points back, but progress now depends not only on their own performances but also on other teams stumbling. That’s not the most comfortable position to be in.Tanev had been out since November 1, and during his absence, Toronto went 9-10-4. There was no one in-house, and likely no one available on the trade market, who could replace what he brings: low-event hockey, stability, and a veteran’s understanding of when to slow things down. He’s 36 and not the star of the franchise, but he is important to how this team functions.The win over Pittsburgh doesn’t erase the questions around Toronto’s season. What it does show, though, is how different the Maple Leafs look when they have structure at the back. Right now, Chris Tanev is a big part of keeping that hope alive.Also Read: Chris Tanev discusses return as Toronto Maple Leafs defeat Pittsburgh Penguins in NHL action","Toronto maple leafs beat pittsburgh penguins 6-3 on sunday.

Rocky Johnson’s wrestling career and income insights

Rocky Johnson and Dwayne Johnson’s complex son and father relationship details

Rocky Johnson's wrestling journey was characterized not only by great achievements but also by huge money. He started his career in the late 1960s under the name “Soul Train” and, before the end of the decade, with just a bit of luck, he had already gotten on the map from local venues to the National Wrestling Alliance and then the World Wrestling Federation in 1973. Although the professional legacy of Rocky Johnson is admired, the personal relationship with his son was very complicated. Dwayne Johnson has told the truth about the difficulties of being a child of his father, with the strict discipline and love he called tough love.Rocky Johnson was known for his physical skills and charisma, and his collection of major titles included the NWA Georgia Heavyweight Championship and the NWA Television Championship two times. His most significant victory came in 1983 when he won the WWF Tag Team Championship, which made him part of the first Black champions in WWE history, and he was the one who got the ball rolling in professional wrestling.At first, Rocky discouraged his son from becoming a wrestler since he was afraid of the difficulties that the industry would entail. However, The Rock later became his father’s successor, one of the most successful wrestlers and entertainers in the world.The Rock stated that he and his father had a huge disagreement in late 2019, only a few weeks before Rocky died. Their arguments became one of the biggest fights that they had, and it left them estranged when Rocky passed away. This painful situation is something that The Rock has to live with and he has spoken about his regret of not having made up with his father before his father’s unexpected death.For Dwayne Johnson, his father’s death was not only the loss of a dad but also the recalling of disputes that were not dealt with. Nevertheless, he still pays tribute to his dad’s greatness, gives credit to the hardships that Rocky went through, and the trail he opened up for him.Also Read: Unveiling the Surprising Side of WWE Superstar Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson","Rocky johnson started his wrestling career in the late 1960s under the name “soul train’ his most significant victory came in 1983 when he won the wwf tag team championship, which made him part of the first black champions in wwe history.

The 2025 NBA season will be remembered not just for the great on-court games but also for some highly controversial moments. From serious legal controversies to the in-game ones, the big league found itself in some of the most unexpected moments that quickly grabbed the spotlight, for the reasons that the fans will be discussing for years to come.Some of these moments tested the league’s values. Even though a game where trash talk is going on regularly, it is a game of pride and integrity, and with the controversies going on, it really questions the morality that the league aims to hold on to. Below are 5 of the most controversial moments that the NBA witnessed in 2025.The Luka Doncic and Anthony Davis trade became the most talked-about and one of the most controversial NBA moments of 2025, because of how unexpected it was for the fans. Luka Doncic was a star player of the Dallas Mavericks, who led them to the Finals in the 2024-25 NBA regular season. And Anthony Davis, on the other hand, is a ten-time NBA All-Star who also won an NBA championship with the Los Angeles Lakers. So, the trade was quite emotional for the fans of both players to witness and came as a shock to them.Fans all over social media were raging with anger. But the heat of the moment came, and the situation became even more controversial when the fans of the Dallas Mavericks started protesting openly against the Mavericks’ general manager, Nico Harrison.“Fire Nico”, the fans chanted, as they continued protesting against this sudden decision to trade the players.Another major controversial moment in the 2025 NBA season occurred during a game between the Brooklyn Nets and the Indiana Pacers in March 2025, when a sudden on-court fight broke out between Andrew Nembhard and Trendon Watford, and quickly escalated into a physical fight, eventually involving other players like Myles Turner. This incident quickly grabbed public attention and led to fouls and fines by the big league, raising questions of growing on-court aggression.The 2025 NBA gambling scandal is one of the most controversial incidents, and it came to light with the U.S. federal authorities accusing more than 30 people connected to the big league of being involved in illegal gambling activities. It immediately tensed up the whole situation and raised questions of whether games were being played fairly. Among those accused and arrested were the Miami Heat guard, Terry Rozier, and Chauncey Billups, who is the head coach of the Portland Trail Blazers.They were mainly accused of sharing inside information and earning money through it. Following the arrests, the NBA put the two on leave and agreed to cooperate with the authorities to further investigate the matter. It became a controversial matter of discussion even among the fans as it quickly raised questions about the authenticity of the big league.Chris Paul previously played for the Los Angeles Clippers from 2011 to 2017. In 2024, Paul joined the San Antonio Spurs as a free agent for the 2024-25 NBA regular season, and he continued with the Spurs that whole season and even signed a one-year contract worth $11 million with the team. After the end of that season, Paul again became a free agent and signed a $3.6 million contract with the Los Angeles Clippers in the summer of 2025. Even though Paul is a 12-time All-Star, however, at the start of the season, he was seen struggling on court, averaging only 2.9 points.And thus came the reports of tension between him and the Clippers head coach, Tyronn Lue. In early December 2025, Paul one morning announced on his Instagram that he had just found out that the Clippers were planning on parting ways with him. Shortly after, the Clippers officially confirmed the news that they were sending Paul home. This sparked intense reactions from fans and followers over social media as they were shocked by this decision. It became a controversial matter as former teammates voiced their support for Paul openly, as they felt the entire situation was quite disappointing.In December 2025, during a Golden State Warriors game against the Orlando Magic, Draymond Green left the game midway and stormed into the locker room, which happened as he missed a ball on a turnover. This was followed by an argument between him and the Warriors coach, Steve Kerr. And following this incident, Green headed back to the locker room.As he returned to the courtside after cooling off for a bit, he was seen sitting on the bench. And even though the Warriors ended up winning that match, this incident caught public attention and became a matter of controversy even among the fans, who talked more about Green’s sudden exit from the game instead of celebrating the Warriors’ win.Also Read: 5 Best NBA Christmas games of all time",The 2025 nba season will be remembered not just for the great on-court games but also for some highly controversial moments.

In NBA, the action doesn't stop at the hardwood. While the athletes provide the high-flying dunks and clutch threes, the front row seats provide culture. Courtside seats have become the ultimate status symbol, offering an elite experience to the cream of the crop. In 2017, a buyer paid $133K, booking two floor seats for the NBA finals Game 5 between the Warriors and Cavaliers.These aren't just casual observers looking for a photo op, they are ""superfans"" who schedule filming around the playoffs, engage in psychological warfare with opposing guards, and, in some cases, hold official titles within the front office. They range from the legendary Hollywood stars, business tycoons, and musical icons. As we look at the landscape in late 2025, these six faces remain the pillars of NBA fandom.Jack Nicholson remains the undisputed celebrity superfan. ""Grandfather of Courtside."" While 2025 has seen the 88-year-old legend become more selective with his appearances, the Crypto.com Arena still feels different when Jack is in his signature seat near the visiting bench.Wearing his trademark sunglasses indoors, Nicholson has been a consistent ticket holder since the 1970s, and his love and dedication for Lakers was shown through his ""no filming during Lakers home games"" clause in his movie contracts.Spike Lee’s love for the Knicks stemmed from his younger days when his father, Bill, would take him to watch the NBA games at the third Madison Square Garden, before its demolition in 1968. He also witnessed the 1970s decider Game 7 between Lakers and Knicks, where the Knicks won by 113-99 and the NBA championship by 4-3.Lee was often seen on the courtside, decked in orange and blue with custom sneakers and sunglasses. He doesn't just watch the game, he officiates it from the sidelines, along with his legendary “trash talking” that once riled up legends like Reggie Miller and now the younger players are subjected to it.Drake took his love for the Toronto Raptors to another level when he became their Global Ambassador. He has his ""OVO"" branded on Raptors’ team gear, practice facility, and exclusive collaboration with Lakers, Celtics, Bulls, and Knicks, blending sports, music, and fashion. Whether he’s playfully lint-rolling his pants or getting a technical foul or being warned about “the use of bad language,” Drake isn’t just another super fan, he has made Toronto the NBA’s coolest northern outpost.You might not know his name, but you’ve seen the textured hat. With his signature python skin outfits and long silver hair, Goldstein is the only fan on this list who doesn't claim a team. Instead, he’s a fan of the game. Attending 100 games per season, Goldstein spends a fortune on travel and tickets to ensure he has the best view of the league's history as it happens.Standing as the loudest ""little man"" in Philly, Kevin Hart is the only person to win four straight NBA Celebrity All-Star Game MVP (2012-2015). For Hart, every Sixers game is like a stand-up special, filled with his notorious chirping at superstars like Jimmy Butler and Draymond Green, often resulting in hilarious mid-game exchanges.Hart’s role expanded even further when he became the first-ever-on-court emcee for the 2024-25 NBA All-Star Game.The 2011 Hall of Famer has become the Lakers' most high-profile protector. Since moving his Club Shay Shay brand to LA, Sharpe’s courtside presence has become a viral event in itself.

"Who is the highest paid player of the Toronto Blue Jays in 2025? Salary breakdown, bonuses, and contract details",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/mlb/news/who-is-the-highest-paid-player-of-the-toronto-blue-jays-in-2025-salary-breakdown-bonuses-and-contract-details/articleshow/126204607.cms,"Bo Bichette, Vladimir Guerrero Jr., Springer (Image Source: Getty)

Vladimir Guerrero Jr.: Swinging for the biggest salary

From base pay to bonus: Inside the contract breakdown

Within Major League Baseball, where contract durations range from several years and player pay scales well into newsworthy territory, Toronto Blue Jays management has assembled a team lineup that capitalizes on star performers and economical spending measures alike. For the year 2025, there is one player on the Blue Jays who stands apart from his fellow players not only within the lineup but on paper as well, his contract terms for 2025 and his upcoming long-term contract making him literally the income pulse of this team.While the Blue Jays are taking home wins and making playoff appearances, it is interesting to calculate their wager by examining their contracts and their bonuses. In some cases, no less than for Vladimir Guerrero Jr., who is more than just a seventh-inning stretch bat within this lineup, as it just so happens he is the team's most highly paid player for 2025.As of the 2025 season, Vladimir Guerrero Jr. currently takes home the highest salary on the Blue Jays with $28.5 million, which is the biggest individual salary for a Jays player for the year. Guerrero’s contract is based on an arbitration bypass agreement he had with the Jays, which sees him as one of the league’s highly-paid players for the season.Guerrero Jr.’s contract is quite impressive considering he is part of a lineup with other big stars such as George Springer, Kevin Gausman, and Bo Bichette, to mention just a few.This 2025 raise is more than just a number in a contract; it is part of Guerrero’s larger arc from hot prospect to franchise foundation, and of course, it is simply the setup to his massive extension. It was in April 2025 that Guerrero reached an agreement to sign a record-breaking 14-year, $500 million contract that kicks in 2026, making it one of the largest contracts ever signed in Major League Baseball. It includes an absolutely massive $325 million signing bonus with no deferred components, making his value every bit as liquid as it is speedy.Guerrero's $28.5 million salary in 2025 already makes him the highest-paid Blue Jay, but a lot more layers exist to his financial picture than just pay per annum. The long-term extension looming over his head, which will value him at more than half a billion dollars, changes his career earnings outlook dramatically. That huge contract includes a structured signing bonus paid over multiple seasons, with incentives tied to All-Star selections, MVP voting finishes, and Silver Slugger or Gold Glove awards-bonuses that could add meaningful sums if Guerrero continues performing at elite levels.Relatively speaking, other stars on the Blue Jays, including George Springer and Kevin Gausman, make large salaries - Springer in the mid-$20 million range and Gausman at just over $23 million, neither of which eclipses Guerrero's 2025 total.In a sport where money often follows success, the Blue Jays have placed their bet on Guerrero's bat and his long-term potential.
