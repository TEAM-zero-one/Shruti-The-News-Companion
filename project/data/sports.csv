Country’s first blind Army officer in active service shoots to national award,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/countrys-first-blind-army-officer-in-active-service-shoots-to-national-award/articleshow/125755670.cms,"President Droupadi Murmu presents Lt Col C Dwarakesh with the National Award for Persons with Disabilities on Wednesday





PUNE: A basketball match at a military station in 2014 was one of the last things Lt Col C Dwarakesh saw before an accident left him blind. He would spend the next eight months in hospital, healing and adjusting to life without eyesight while his mind envisioned new possibilities.On Wednesday, President Droupadi Murmu presented the 36-year-old with the National Award for Persons with Disabilities, recognising an Army career that even disability couldn’t cut short, and one that now includes a world record in para shooting.Lt Col Dwarakesh is the first officer of the Indian armed forces to continue in active service despite total blindness. It’s an achievement made possible by the derring-do of a young officer who never gave up on himself despite no precedent.“As an Army officer, I was trained to have conviction, courage, willpower and tenacity. But blindness is an impediment I couldn’t have prepared for,” Lt Col Dwarakesh told TOI from Delhi. “I overcame this hurdle through academics and technology, clearing multiple competitive exams along the way. I now research para sports, especially for people living with blindness. I converted my disability into a power and found ways to express the way those with vision do.This mindset has helped me reach new heights.”Supported by AI tools and assistive technology, Dwarakesh performs his responsibilities with the same proficiency and precision as his colleagues. In paralympic sports, he is a national champion in swimming and shooting, ranked world No. 3 in the 10m air rifle event. His most recent achievement was a world record score of 624.6 at the Shooting World Cup in the UAE this Oct. As part of the Indian para shooting team, he trains at Army Marksmanship Unit in Mahou.Dwarakesh, who joined the Army in 2009, terms the national award a “full-circle moment”. “I remember being granted commission by the President,” he said. “And to be receiving an award from the President 16 years later for something that redefined me, that’s quite something.”The officer, a native of TN, has also qualified for the UGC NET, making him one of the few visually impaired academicians in management, human resources, labour law, and sports research.","Lt col c dwarakesh is the first officer of the indian armed forces to continue in active service despite total blindness.

What a Reunion Would Mean for the Warriors

Themay be eyeing a reunion that would a fan-favorite veteran ahead of the trade deadline. With the franchise looking to sharpen its three-point firepower for the rest of the season, recent speculation suggests the team could target a familiar face: Dallas Mavericks guard Klay Thompson, a four-time NBA champion currently on a $50 million deal.The discussion gained traction after Blue Man Hoop’s Nick San Miguel suggested that Dallas, now in organizational transition, could move on from some of its higher-priced veterans. As Miguel wrote, “With the Mavericks in a state of flux after firing general manager Nico Harrison, it would not be surprising if they traded away some of their pricier players like (Klay) Thompson or Anthony Davis.”Golden State’s intentions have been clear from the moment they signed Seth Curry on Monday. A franchise built on outside shooting needs more consistency from deep, and Curry’s arrival already looks promising.In his first game with the Warriors, the 35-year-old guard delivered 14 points while shooting an impressive 85.7 percent from the field and 66.7 percent from three against the Oklahoma City Thunder. Still, the front office appears to be exploring additional depth options.The Golden State Warriors have rotated through several shooting guards this season, hoping someone would seize the role.Here’s how the current situation stands:Nick San Miguel emphasized this instability, noting, “Golden State has cycled through the shooting guard position this season.” That context opens the door to the possibility of bringing back Thompson, a move that would be both sentimental and strategic. (H/t: Sporting News)Dallas Mavericks’ front office changes have created uncertainty around the roster. Klay Thompson, now 6-foot-5 and 21 games into the season, has delivered a mix of high-ceiling performances and off nights that have raised questions about his consistency.His performances have ranged widely, with games where he “set the nets on fire” and others where he “looked washed-up in every aspect of the game.” That unpredictability makes him a gamble=, but one the Warriors may feel is worthwhile.Bringing Klay Thompson back would tap into a decade of history. The Golden State Warriors’ four championships with Stephen Curry all came with Thompson by his side. While his current form is less reliable, the franchise might view the reunion as a chance to recapture some of that magic as Curry’s career winds down.• Familiarity with Steve Kerr’s system• Deep playoff experience• Ability to stretch the floor• Potential second-unit scoring sparkEven with concerns about consistency, Thompson’s long-range resume remains elite. If he can rediscover rhythm in a familiar environment, he could become a valuable contributor for a team still chasing another title in the Curry era.If Golden State does pursue a trade, expectations would need to be tempered. Thompson is no longer the 20-point scorer he once was, but his shooting gravity and veteran presence could elevate a second unit that has lacked stability.The move would also carry emotional weight. For fans, players, and even the organization, welcoming Thompson back would feel like closing a circle—one more run with a core that defined an era of NBA basketball.Also read: NBA trade rumors: Los Angeles Lakers predicted to land $186 million Milwaukee Bucks superstar to form Big 3 with LeBron James and Luka Doncic As of now, it remains speculation, but the idea is no longer far-fetched. The Warriors want shooting, the Mavericks may be recalibrating, and Thompson sits right at the intersection of both storylines. Whether nostalgia or strategy ultimately drives the decision, Golden State could find itself revisiting one of the most iconic partnerships in franchise history.","The golden state warriors have rotated through several shooting guards this season.

Who is Gemmi Schottenheimer?





How Gemmi Schottenheimer supported Brian through NFL challenges





More coverage on NFL:

In the high-stakes world of the NFL, where coaches are constantly under pressure to deliver results, few pause to notice the steady forces that keep them grounded. For Dallas Cowboys head coach Brian Schottenheimer, that unwavering force is his wife, Gemmi Schottenheimer. Her life may unfold away from the sidelines and flashing cameras, but her presence has shaped Brian’s career and family in ways only those closest to them can truly understand. Behind every play call and every move across teams, Gemmi has been the quiet constant—strong, patient, and deeply supportive.Gemmi Schottenheimer has lived through the highs and lows of the NFL lifestyle. From team changes to unexpected firings, she has been Brian’s anchor in an unpredictable profession. Before their marriage, fate brought her close to his family in a rather unusual way. While working for the Washington Redskins, Gemmi crossed paths with legendary coach Marty Schottenheimer, who happened to be Brian’s father. She recalled in a 2024 podcast with Stacey Bell, “I had not met Brian at that point. I sort of became an assistant to him [Marty] while he was trying to find one. I was on his voicemail. I did all these things and just sort of had an opportunity to watch him lead without being in the family or dating Brian.”Ironically, when she finally met Brian, she didn’t even realize who his father was. “When I met Brian, didn’t even know that he was Marty’s son in the beginning… So it was just kind of unique for me to transition into a daughter-in-law,” Gemmi said. Over the years, their relationship only grew stronger, especially during the toughest times — like when Marty was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s in 2016. Through those painful moments, Gemmi held the family together, showing the same calm strength that defines her today.Life with an NFL coach demands patience and adaptability. For Gemmi, that meant managing home life, raising two children, and maintaining a sense of stability while Brian juggled long hours and constant team transitions. Her resilience shone through even during career shocks. Reflecting on tough times, she said, “The Seattle firing, you know, was definitely something we didn’t see coming. We had just won the division. And as you know, I mean, Marty was fired after a 14 and two season. So these firings, it can happen when you least expect it.”Beyond the sidelines, Gemmi’s support also extended to moments of celebration. When Brian was named Cowboys head coach in 2025, Gemmi learned the news directly from Jerry and Stephen Jones. “I got out of [Brian’s] truck and started saying, ‘Oh my gosh! Oh my gosh!’ I didn’t have anyone to talk to. I was by myself, but it was really special,” she recalled.Gemmi Schottenheimer may not wear a headset on game day, but she’s every bit a part of Brian’s success. Her quiet strength and enduring love have shaped his journey. Together, the Schottenheimers have shown that true partnership — built on trust, loyalty, and resilience — is the real foundation of greatness.",Gemmi schottenheimer is the wife of dallas cowboys head coach brian.

Dak Prescott drives the Cowboys toward a season-defining matchup



The intensity around Dak Prescott has reached a peak as he enters tonight’s showdown in Detroit with the season hanging in the balance. His 2025 numbers place him at the center of one of the biggest games on Thursday Night Football. The Cowboys need a spark to stay alive in the NFC race, and Prescott’s 3,261 passing yards and 25 touchdowns in 12 games give Dallas a real chance. The Lions feel the same pressure with their own playoff hopes slipping. Both teams know this is not just another week. It feels like a postseason game wrapped inside December football.Prescott arrives with the confidence of a quarterback playing his best stretch of the year. Dallas rides his hot hand because the playoff margin is shrinking fast. A win boosts their odds to 31 percent. A loss drops them to only 6 percent. The Lions are not far off, with a defeat leaving them with a ten percent elimination risk at home inside Ford Field.Dak Prescott ranks 1st in QBR at 102.4 this season with 3,261 passing yards through 12 games, and that production sets the tone for Dallas in every phase. His 25 touchdowns and only 8 interceptions show how precise he has been.Over the last three games, he has taken another huge leap with 942 passing yards, 8 touchdowns, and only 2 interceptions while completing 69.3 percent of his throws. The rise has been timely for a team fighting to stay above the playoff line.His performance against Kansas City highlighted how sharp he is right now when he delivered 320 yards and 2 touchdowns in a 31 to 28 win. Games like that explain why his efficiency sits at the highest point of the season. Tonight, that version of Prescott becomes critical because the Lions pass defense ranks 17th in the league, allowing 212.5 yards per game. It is the kind of matchup he has handled well in the past.Dak Prescott said he’s ready to light up the Lions pass defense in Detroit, just like he did in previous matchups. The rookie 17th ranked pass defense gives up 212.5 yards per game through the air. That opens the field for George Pickens and the rest of the receiving group to stretch Detroit’s shaky coverage.Every drive matters in a game with this much at stake. Both teams feel the weight of playoff pressure, but the Cowboys lean on Prescott’s elite 2025 stats to take control of their season.

Who Wins the Deal?

' front office is quietly positioning itself for a move that could reshape the late innings of the 2026 season. According to widespread reporting, including coverage from Sporting News and Seattle-based outlets, the Mariners are showing serious interest in Philadelphia Phillies left-hander Matt Strahm, one of the league’s steadiest high-leverage arms. As original writer Caleb Hightower noted, the Mariners are circling a move that would be received as a major statement around the league: “The Golden State Warriors have a chance to make a move that would stun the NBA world.” While referencing a different sport, the sentiment from Hightower reflects the magnitude insiders are attaching to a potential Strahm deal for Seattle.The Seattle Mariners, who finished 2025 with a top-10 bullpen ERA but limited left-handed depth, appear focused on Matt Strahm over other Phillies southpaws such as José Alvarado and Tanner Banks. With the Winter Meetings underway, league chatter suggests Seattle wants to solidify the final innings next to Gabe Speier, especially after falling one win shy of the 2025 World Series.No formal offer has been submitted, but analysts agree that the cleanest path involves a one-for-one swap: Matt Strahm goes to Seattle, while the Philadelphia Phillies receive top catching prospect Harry Ford.Strahm, owed $7.5 million in 2026, is entering his final year of club control.Ford, ranked No. 4 in Seattle’s system and No. 40 overall by MLB Pipeline, has long been considered one of the organization’s most dynamic young players. He hit .283 with 16 homers and an .868 OPS at Triple-A Tacoma before his late-season promotion in 2025. With Cal Raleigh entrenched as Seattle’s everyday catcher and coming off an AL MVP runner-up campaign, Ford’s long-term path is blocked.Philadelphia Phillies' interest makes sense. Ford’s 35 steals in 2024 minors showcase a rare speed-power profile for a catcher, and the Phillies are facing looming outfield needs, payroll adjustments, and succession planning behind J.T. Realmuto.Matt Strahm has quietly become one of MLB’s most reliable late-inning relievers. His .499 OPS allowed in high-leverage scenarios during 2025 underscores why Seattle Marinewrs view him as a playoff weapon. His ability to miss bats, paired with a 93rd-percentile chase rate, fits perfectly into a bullpen that ranked ninth overall but lacked left-handed strikeout juice.Seattle’s bullpen posted a collective 3.72 ERA in 2025, but with only Speier providing consistent left-handed production, the need for another late-inning southpaw grew increasingly obvious as October approached.• Immediate upgrade in high-leverage innings• A proven postseason arm with strong command• No long-term salary burden• Strahm’s profile matches T-Mobile Park’s pitcher-friendly environment• Helps address a bullpen that converted just 62.3 percent of save opportunitiesSeattle Marainers are also in an aggressive stage of its competitive cycle. Coming off a near-pennant run, the front office is attempting to maximize its window without sacrificing core pieces.• Harry Ford offers controllable years and fills both catching and outfield depth concerns• Phillies save $7.5 million for 2026, preserving flexibility for outfield or right-handed relief upgrades• Ford’s speed-power potential could address a lineup that needs athleticism and long-term planning• Allows Philadelphia to move a reliever before free agency rather than risk losing him for nothing• Strahm enhances the bullpen instantly with strikeouts and late-inning poise• Complements Seattle’s dominant starting rotation• Avoids long-term payroll commitments while keeping the roster competitive• Acquire an MLB-ready prospect with valuable versatility• Maintain roster balance amid impending outfield uncertainties• Add future cost-controlled production• Trading Ford thins catching depth behind Cal Raleigh• Strahm is 34, limiting multi-year upside• Reliever performance is naturally volatile• Losing Strahm removes their most reliable left-handed reliever• Ford’s defense still lags behind his bat and athletic toolsFrom a pure impact standpoint, the Seattle Mariners come out ahead in the short term. Their push to capitalize on a championship window makes Strahm’s role clear and immediate. His high-leverage steadiness, postseason readiness, and ability to neutralize AL West lefty-righty sluggers offer value that far outweighs the risk.Philadelphia, meanwhile, benefits from adding a high-end prospect without absorbing financial strain, but the loss of Strahm undeniably weakens their bullpen until internal arms or external signings fill the gap.Also read: MLB trade rumors: Chicago Cubs refocus on $80 million Boston Red Sox superstar to compensate for Kyle Tucker departure Both sides satisfy key organizational needs, but Seattle’s immediate return gives them the edge.","Matt strahm has quietly become one of mlb’s most reliable late-inning relievers.

The team, led by Abhimanyu Easwaran, moved to the top of the points table with 16 points and is in a good position to reach the knockouts.Easwaran, who is also trying to strengthen his case ahead of the IPL auction, scored 58 off 37 balls. Bengal chased 166 in 15.1 overs. Abhishek Porel, representing Delhi Capitals in the IPL, scored 56 off 29 balls. The pair added 93 runs for the second wicket in 8.2 overs, which set up the chase.The platform was created by Shami, who was named Player of the Match for his figures of 4/13 in 3.2 overs, and India pacer Akash Deep, who took 3/27. Services were bowled out for 165 in 18.2 overs.Shami picked two wickets in his first spell, dismissing openers Gaurav Kocchar (0) and Ravi Chauhan (26 off 9). Mukesh Kumar, on his return, gave away 53 runs in three overs. Writtick Chatterjee (2/32) and Akash Deep removed key middle-order batters before Shami ended the innings by taking the final wickets.Shami’s strong domestic performance comes when India’s pace-bowling options for the South Africa series are being discussed. Prasidh Krishna conceded 85 runs in the second ODI, even though he took two wickets, which led to debate about Shami’s absence. Harbhajan Singh also questioned the decision.""Where is Shami? I don't know why Shami is not playing. I get it, you have Prasidh, he is a good bowler, but he still has a lot to learn. You had good bowlers, and you have slowly sidelined them. With Bumrah, this is a different bowling attack, and without Bumrah, it is entirely different attack altogether. We have to learn the art of winning games without Jasprit Bumrah,"" Harbhajan said on his YouTube channel.Shami has not played for India since the 2025 ICC Champions Trophy, where he finished as India’s joint-highest wicket-taker with nine wickets.",Mohammed shami takes 4 for 13 to help bengal beat services by seven wickets.

Will Amon-Ra St. Brown play against the Dallas Cowboys today? Latest injury update on the Detroit Lions’ WR,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/will-amon-ra-st-brown-play-against-the-dallas-cowboys-today-latest-injury-update-on-the-detroit-lions-wr/articleshow/125760040.cms,"Amon-Ra St. Brown's availability for Thursday Night Football is uncertain after an ankle injury, posing a significant challenge for the Detroit Lions. His potential absence, alongside Penei Sewell's questionable status, could severely impact the offensive line against a formidable Dallas Cowboys defense, with major playoff seeding implications on the line.

Will Amon-Ra St. Brown play today?

The Detroit Lions are preparing for one of the most pivotal Thursday Night Football matchups of the season, and uncertainty around their best offensive weapon has suddenly taken center stage. Just days after exiting the Thanksgiving loss to the Green Bay Packers with an ankle injury, Amon-Ra St. Brown's status for today's match remains a huge question.The short turnaround is working against him, but the fact he’s even being evaluated to play shows how quickly he has progressed. St. Brown did not practice earlier in the week, and Detroit must balance urgency with caution in a game that has major playoff seeding implications against a surging NFC opponent.Amon-Ra St. Brown is officially listed as questionable for tonight’s clash against the Dallas Cowboys at Ford Field. St. Brown’s importance can’t be overstated. With 75 catches, 884 yards and nine touchdowns, he remains the cornerstone of Detroit’s offense, averaging an impressive 11.8 yards per reception. His absence last week was immediately felt, as the passing attack struggled to stretch the field without its most reliable route runner.The Lions know there is no true replacement for him, particularly against a Cowboys defense that thrives on pressure and forces quarterbacks into mistakes.The potential availability of Penei Sewell is just as critical. With Sewell also listed as questionable, the Detroit offensive line may be forced to battle one of the toughest defensive fronts in football at less than full strength. Dallas boasts a stacked group of trench disruptors, including Quinnen Williams, Kenny Clark, Jadeveon Clowney, Osa Odighizuwa and rookie standout DeMarvion Overshown.Their impact could snowball if the Lions are missing both their elite wideout and their All-Pro tackle. And despite allowing 28.5 points per game, the Cowboys defense remains dangerous when it consistently wins at the line of scrimmage.Detroit has already ruled out Kerby Joseph, Kalif Raymond, Brock Wright and Shane Sylstra, while safety Brian Branch and linemen Graham Glasgow and Taylor Decker are also questionable. If St. Brown suits up, Jared Goff’s job becomes significantly easier, and a high-scoring game becomes even more likely.If he doesn’t, Detroit’s playoff push may suddenly face a much tougher road. The Lions must decide whether the reward outweighs the risk, with the season’s most meaningful stretch just beginning.Also Read: Jason and Travis Kelce's New Heights dethroned podcast giants to become Spotify's number one sports show","Detroit lions wide receiver amon-ra st. brown is listed as questionable for thursday night football against the dallas cowboys.

Evander Kane trade market remains quiet for Vancouver Canucks



The NHL trade season is slowly heating up, but not every veteran name is generating buzz for the right reasons. For the Vancouver Canucks, discussions around roster flexibility have sparked renewed attention on Evander Kane. His name has surfaced more out of uncertainty. More than genuine market demand.As the NHL season moves closer to its midway point and teams begin shaping deadline strategies, Vancouver appears open to moving veteran contracts. However, league insiders suggest Kane’s situation is complicated. Along with factors such as performance, fit, and long-term value. All of these are influencing the lack of momentum around any potential deal.Despite being a recognizable NHL veteran. Evander Kane has drawn minimal interest across the league. Several NHL executives reportedly believe that Kane’s current production does not justify taking on his contract.

William Nylander breaks down the reality of Maple Leafs’ changing core



Auston Matthews and William Nylander | Blue Room Presented by Rogers

The Toronto Maple Leafs started this season with a noticeably different feel, and their early performances have only highlighted the shift. For years, the team relied on a familiar core to carry the load, but with major changes and uneven results, the group is still trying to find its balance. The chemistry that once felt automatic now needs to be rebuilt from the ground up, and every game is exposing both the progress and the gaps.William Nylander, one of the team’s most dependable forwards, has now spoken openly about how different things feel inside the room. His comments reflect a team adjusting to a new identity while trying to stay competitive and consistent on the ice. With expectations still high, his honesty adds weight to the growing sense that the Leafs are navigating one of their most important turning points in recent seasons.Nylander didn’t hesitate to acknowledge how much the team has changed. The long-standing “Core Four” of Auston Matthews, Mitch Marner, John Tavares, and William Nylander once represented Toronto’s best hope of pushing toward a championship. But with Marner traded and Tavares easing into a smaller role, that familiar dynamic has shifted. “For a long time it was the four of us,” Nylander said. “So that is a little bit different.The Maple Leafs responded to these changes by reshaping their lineup. Matthew Knies was moved into a permanent top-line role beside Matthews, signaling the team’s trust in his growing impact. Toronto also added fresh faces in Nicolas Roy, Mattias Macelli, and Dakota Joshua — players expected to bring depth, work ethic, and stability across all zones.Even with these additions, the results have been mixed. After 26 games, the Leafs sit at 12-11-3, struggling to build steady momentum. Their offensive talent remains strong, but defensive breakdowns and inconsistent stretches have held them back. With Marner’s creativity no longer in the mix and Tavares taking on less of the load, Matthews and Nylander have carried more responsibility in key moments.Nylander’s honest reflection shows a team in transition, trying to rebuild its chemistry while learning to operate with a new structure. As the season continues, the challenge for Toronto is to establish a new identity that can support its star players and create the kind of balance needed to turn potential into real progress.Also Read: Tyler Seguin injury update: Dallas coach Glen Gulutzan provides key insight on Star center’s ACL setback","William nylander opens up on leafs’ core changes.
