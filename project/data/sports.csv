NEW DELHI: ""DC ke saarein khatam ho gaye hain, sahab (Sir, the DC ones are all sold out),"" sighed an agitated jersey seller outside the Arun Jaitley Stadium .He wasn’t alone.On a crowded Jawaharlal Nehru Marg, vendors echoed the same tone as Delhi Capitals jerseys had vanished from the shelves -- a mere representation of the team’s unbeaten run in the 18th season of the Indian Premier League (IPL).With DC jerseys in short supply, neutrals, who had just arrived to enjoy a game of IPL on Sunday evening, opted for what hadn't run out of stock yet: a Mumbai Indians jersey with “Rohit” embedded on the back.Inside the stadium, when Jasprit Bumrah was teaching the iconic helicopter shot to Will Jacks, Rohit kept his warm-up light.The ex-Mumbai captain was also seen chatting with DC physio Patrick Farhart, a familiar face from his Team India days.The crowd cheered the loudest when the announcer confirmed Rohit's presence in the MI XI after Delhi won the toss and chose to field first.Opening the innings, Rohit took strike against Mitchell Starc, who operated from the Gautam Gambhir Stand end.For the first couple of overs, the 37-year-old focused on playing it with soft hands and rotating strike, facing just two balls for two runs.But it was Ryan Rickelton's explosive hitting that seemed to spark something in Rohit.In Starc’s second over, Rohit joined the party, smacking 14 runs off the 19-run over -- flashes of his vintage T20 World Cup Super 8s innings against Australia came to being.However, the fire fizzled quickly.While Mukesh Kumar’s pace troubled him in the following over, 20-year-old leggie Vipraj Nigam brought his innings to an end with a sharp delivery that caught the former skipper off guard.An LBW shout and a subsequent review drew the first blood at 47. Keeping his head down, Rohit walked off with 18 off 12.It was yet another short stay this season: 0, 8, 13, 17, and now 18.There’s a slow upward trend, and Rohit will be hoping to break free from this streak in the games ahead.A day before the match, he, however, had kept the lights on at the Arun Jaitley nets longer than anyone else.Mumbai Indians arrived first for training at around 5:30 PM, and while DC wound up early, Rohit had only just begun his session.Earlier in the evening, he was mostly observing, quietly going through fitness routines. With his knee strapped, many assumed he wouldn’t bat.But he eventually geared up, put on the pads. After some solo knocking on one side of the ground, he headed to the nets.Interestingly, Rohit, however, didn't face any bowlers: only a 30-minute round of throwdown. Thus, the training session, which was supposed to end at 8:30 PM, concluded thirty minutes later.Even then, the trademark big hits were missing. None of his big hits cleared the boundary and reached the stands. The signs of struggle were clear.Backed by strong batting displays from Rickelton (41), Suryakumar Yadav (40), Tilak Varma (59), and Naman Dhir (38 not out), MI reached 205/5. Rohit Sharma showed glimpses of agility before making way for impact sub Karn Sharma, who turned the tide with a match-defining 3/36, dismissing the dangerous Karun Nair (89) and swinging momentum MI’s way.An edge-of-the-seat finish saw three successive run-outs as Delhi were bowled out for 193 in 19 overs.What followed was the blue wave of celebration as it secured Mumbai’s second win in six games. Now, whether this sparks a turnaround in their IPL season remains to be seen.","Mumbai indians beat delhi capitals by eight wickets. Rohit sharma scored 18 runs off 12 balls.

NEW DELHI: Desperate to arrest their slide, the Chennai Super Kings (CSK) will be hoping for a change in fortunes when they face the in-form Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) in Match 30 of the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2025 at the Bharat Ratna Shri Atal Bihari Vajpayee Ekana Cricket Stadium today (April 14).CSK find themselves under mounting pressure, having suffered five consecutive defeats — a rare slump for the five-time champions. Their woes have been compounded by a lack of firepower in the middle-order and over-reliance on the top-order batters. Adding to their misery, CSK have lost three home games in a row at the MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai, marking a first in the franchise’s storied IPL history.The return of M.S. Dhoni as captain, following Ruturaj Gaikwad’s injury, failed to inspire a turnaround in their last outing against the Kolkata Knight Riders. As they head into this crucial fixture, CSK will be desperate for a complete performance with both bat and ball to snap their losing streak.In contrast, LSG are riding a wave of confidence after a commanding six-wicket win over Gujarat Titans. With four victories in six games, they sit comfortably at third in the points table. CSK, meanwhile, are languishing at the bottom, managing just one win from six matches.The two sides have faced off five times in IPL history, with LSG holding a slight edge—winning three encounters, while one ended without a result. As both teams gear up for this pivotal clash, CSK will be eyeing redemption, while LSG look to keep their winning momentum going.The surface at the Ekana Cricket Stadium in Lucknow is expected to be a balanced one, offering assistance to both pacers and spinners. Given the conditions, both teams are likely to prefer chasing at this venue.Nicholas Pooran (wk), Rishabh Pant (C), A Badoni, Himmat Singh, DA Miller, AK Markram, Abdul Samad, Shahbaz Ahmed, Ravi Bishnoi, Akash Deep, Shardul ThakurDevon Conway, MS Dhoni (C), S Dubey, Deepak Hooda, Rachin Ravindra, RA Jadeja, Vijay Shankar, Ravichandran Ashwin, Matheesha Pathirana, Noor Ahmad, KK AhmedNicholas Pooran, Ravi Bishnoi, Mayank Yadav, Ayush Badoni, Rishabh Pant, David Miller, Aiden Markram, Mitchell Marsh, Avesh Khan, Abdul Samad, Aryan Juyal, Akash Deep, Himmat Singh, Manimaran Siddharth, Digvesh Singh, Shahbaz Ahmed, Akash Singh, Shamar Joseph, Prince Yadav, Yuvraj Chaudhary, RS Hangargekar, Arshin Kulkarni, Matthew Breetzke, Mohsin KhanRuturaj Gaikwad, Shaik Rasheed, Andre Siddarth C, Rahul Tripathi, Devon Conway, MS Dhoni, Vansh Bedi, Shivam Dube, Ravindra Jadeja, Vijay Shankar, Deepak Hooda, Anshul Kamboj, Rachin Ravindra, Jamie Overton, Kamlesh Nagarkoti, Ramakrishna Ghosh, Ravichandran Ashwin, Sam Curran, Matheesha Pathirana, Shreyas Gopal, Mukesh Choudhary, Nathan Ellis, Gurjapneet Singh, Noor Ahmad, Khaleel AhmedLSG currently occupy fourth spot on the points table, having won four of their six matches.

Most runs scored off Bumrah in an over in IPL

NEW DELHI: Karun Nair announced his IPL comeback in spectacular style with a blistering 22-ball half-century, his first in seven years, powering Delhi Capitals to a flying start against Mumbai Indians at the Arun Jaitley Stadium on Sunday.The highlight of his knock was a stunning assault on Jasprit Bumrah in the final over of the powerplay that brought the crowd to its feet and left even MI skipper Hardik Pandya applauding.Chasing 206, DC were jolted early as Jake Fraser-McGurk was dismissed off the first ball by Deepak Chahar . But Nair, playing his first IPL match since 2022, joined Abishek Porel and turned the tide with fearless intent. The pair raced to a fifty-run partnership within five overs, with Nair taking charge.78 (24) - Jake Fraser McGurk vs MI, 202450 (20) - Jake Fraser McGurk vs RR, 202450 (22) - Karun Nair vs MI, 2025*Nair was on 32 when Bumrah returned for his second over in the sixth. He smashed the first ball for a six over backward square leg, followed it with a boundary, and then hammered another six over long-off. A couple off the final ball of the over brought up his milestone — a 22-ball fifty — becoming only the second DC batter after Fraser-McGurk to reach a half-century inside the powerplay.Nair was eventually dismissed by Mitchell Santner in the 12th over for 89. He smashed five sixes and 12 fours in his 40-ball whirlwind knock. He added 119 runs for the opening wicket with Porel (33 off 25 balls) to set the foundation of the run chase.Earlier, Tilak Varma’s 59 off 33, dominated by his signature mid-wicket strokes, helped MI post 205/5. Naman Dhir supported well with 38 not out. Despite Varma’s heroics, it was Nair’s comeback fireworks that stole the show, putting Delhi firmly in the hunt.26 - Pat Cummins (KKR), 202220 - DJ Bravo (CSK), 201818 - Karun Nair (DC), 2025*17 - Faf du Plessis (CSK), 2021","Karun nair scores 22-ball fifty in delhi capitals' chase against mumbai indians.

A goal for the ages: Alex Ovechkin breaks Wayne Gretzky's 26-year record



FULL Alex Ovechkin Celebration Ceremony After Record-Breaking Goal No. 895

A legacy passed down: Anastasia Shubskaya receives diamond tribute from Janet Gretzky



After Alex Ovechkin netted his 895th career goal and broke legendary Wayne Gretzky 's record, Janet Gretzky showed respect to a time-honored hockey tradition by gifting Anastasia Shubskaya , wife of Alex Ovechkin, an eight-carat diamond ring that had been estimated at $280,000. The Capitals may have lost to the New York Islanders by a score of 4-1, but the outcome was an afterthought to a night all about legacy, love, and a new chapter in hockey's history.The moment of history arrived at 7:26 of the second period. Alex Ovechkin let go of a blazing shot through fellow Russian Ilya Sorokin, making himself the NHL's all-time leading goal scorer. Fans inside UBS Arena lost their minds, and Alex Ovechkin commemorated the occasion by executing a belly flop onto the ice—celebrating his big achievement.Alex Ovechkin celebrated this achievement in a pregame ceremony against the Carolina Hurricanes on April 10, 2025. He was given a six-foot sculptural painting by TYP depicting his skates and game-used sticks, with his image on it, with “Most Goals All Time” written on the top and “895 Alex Ovechkin 895” on the bottom.While Alex Ovechkin was absorbing the enormity of his achievement, Anastasia Shubskaya was gifted a symbolic token of the historic night. Continuing a tradition started in 1994, when Colleen Howe (wife of Gordie Howe) gave Janet Gretzky a diamond ring after her husband, Wayne Gretzky, broke Colleen Howe’s husband’s record, Janet Gretzky ensured history repeated itself—this time from one hockey family to another.In an interview with the media, Wayne Gretzky said, “A month ago, my wife said, ‘You know, Colleen Howe started a tradition. I’m not sure if anyone is going to break Alex’s record, but I want to give her (Ovechkin’s wife, Anastasia Shubskaya) something really unique.’ So, we went out and she picked out an eight-diamond ring for Alex’s wife. Not only do hockey guys pass down traditions.

NEW DELHI: Virat Kohli etched his name deeper into cricketing history on Sunday by becoming the first Indian to score 100 half-centuries in T20 cricket . The Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) star achieved the milestone during his unbeaten knock of 62 off 45 balls against Rajasthan Royals at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium in Jaipur.This marked Kohli’s third fifty of the ongoing Indian Premier League (IPL) 2025 season and took his overall tally to 100 fifties and 9 hundreds in 405 T20 matches. He now sits second on the all-time list of most T20 half-centuries, behind only Australia’s David Warner , who has 108 fifties and 8 centuries from 400 games.Kohli brought up his landmark in style, launching Wanindu Hasaranga over the ropes in the 15th over of the run chase.Chasing 174, Kohli led from the front, stitching a blistering 92-run opening partnership with Phil Salt , who smashed 65 off just 33 balls. He then shared an unbeaten 83-run stand with Devdutt Padikkal (40 off 28), guiding RCB to a thumping nine-wicket win with 15 balls remaining.Earlier, Rajasthan Royals posted a competitive 173/4, built on Yashasvi Jaiswal ’s fluent 75 off 47 deliveries. However, their total proved insufficient against a relentless RCB top order.With this milestone, Kohli not only reaffirmed his status as a modern-day legend but also demonstrated his enduring class in the format. Pakistan’s Babar Azam (90 fifties), Chris Gayle (88), and Jos Buttler (86) follow Kohli on the elite T20 fifty-makers list.","Virat kohli becomes first indian to score 100 half-centuries in t20 cricket.

'I was under pressure': SRH's Abhishek Sharma after a record 141 against Punjab Kings

NEW DELHI: Chennai Super Kings head coach Stephen Fleming admitted that turning around their woeful IPL 2025 campaign would be a ""big challenge,"" emphasising that MS Dhoni’s return as captain, following Ruturaj Gaikwad’s injury, is not a magical solution.""His [Dhoni's] influence will always be prominent, but he's not a soothsayer, he hasn't got a magic wand,"" Fleming told reporters ahead of CSK’s clash with Lucknow Super Giants on Monday. ""He can't just rub it over the side otherwise he would have brought it out earlier.

""There’s certainly been a lot of internal soul-searching… but it’s not about words, it’s about players grabbing the moment, finding form, and shaking off apprehension.""Fleming also reflected on the broader nature of T20 cricket: ""I know there’s a fascination with power and six-hitting, but there’s still room for craft… I’d be very sad if it just became a baseball competition.""Looking ahead to Monday’s game against a high-flying LSG, Fleming confirmed Shivam Dube is likely to be fit and stressed the importance of containing Nicholas Pooran.

The Kentucky Derby is only a few days away; the Derby is America's most prestigious annual horse race and is scheduled to be held on May 3. The Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce was present at the iconic race last year, held at Churchill Downs and wore a sharp suit and tophat. And now fans are speculating whether Travis will make an appearance at this year’s Derby along with his famous girlfriend Taylor Swift.An insider from celebrity news platform Deuxmoi has revealed that Travis Kelce wants to rent a private box for the Derby, which holds six guests. This revelation has sparked curiosity about who might join him.Taylor was not with Travis at the Derby last year, as she was focusing on her international Eras Tour that was set to launch in Paris shortly.This year Taylor and Travis have been keeping a low profile since Travis and his team lost out on the Super Bowl. This raises questions about whether Taylor might join Travis for the festivities. It’s possible that Travis will be accompanied by his brother Jason or his teammates or members from his entourage. However, fans believe Taylor may be with him at the Derbys this year since she does not seem to have a major commitment in early May.Travis had opened up about his Derby experience during one of the episodes of his New Heights podcast.""I'm a Derby guy now, man,"" he said on the podcast. ""It was so much fun."" While Jason Kelce had been to the famous race multiple times during his college days at the University of Cincinnati, this was Travis Kelce's first time at the Derbys.“It was a once-in-a-lifetime experience that I am definitely going to try and experience again,” he said on the podcast. “It was fun just being part of the entire environment.”","Fans believe taylor swift will join travis kelce at the kentucky derby this year.

Why was Hetmyer's bat size checked by the umpire?

ACCORDING TO THE RULES:

The blade dimensions are restricted to:

PAST INCIDENT:

NEW DELHI: An unusual incident occurred when the umpire inspected Simron Hetmyer's bat dimensions upon his arrival at the crease during the Indian Premier League (IPL) match between Rajasthan Royals and Royal Challengers Bengaluru at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium in Jaipur.Following Yashasvi Jaiswal's dismissal on the final delivery of the 16th over, Hetmyer entered at the fifth position for the Royals, joining Dhruv Jurel at the crease whilst the home team sought to accelerate their scoring rate.The game experienced a momentary pause as the official utilised a bat gauge to verify whether Hetmyer's bat conformed to regulation specifications.Subsequently, the umpire conducted an identical inspection for RCB's opening batsman Phil Salt before their batting innings commenced.During an IPL match, the on-field umpire decided to inspect Shimron Hetmyer ’s bat to ensure it complied with the league’s regulations. This routine check was conducted to verify that the West Indies star's bat met the specifications outlined under Law 5.7 of the IPL playing conditions, which govern bat dimensions.Hetmyer's bat successfully passed the inspection.The IPL regulations do not specify any point penalties for such violations, and it appears that if Hetmyer's bat had failed to comply with the standards, he would have simply been instructed to use a different bat.The overall length of the bat, including the handle, must not exceed 38 inches (96.52 cm).Width: 4.25 inches (10.8 cm)Depth: 2.64 inches (6.7 cm)Edges: 1.56 inches (4.0 cm)The bat must also be able to pass through a bat gauge, as specified.The handle must not be more than 52% of the total length of the bat.Any covering material on the blade must not exceed 0.04 inches (0.1 cm) in thickness.The protective material on the toe of the bat must not be thicker than 0.12 inches (0.3 cm).In the previous season, a significant incident occurred in the English County Championship when Essex received a 12-point deduction after their batsman Feroze Khushi's bat failed to meet size regulations during a match with Nottinghamshire.The incident took place when Khushi was on 21 runs from 27 deliveries, requiring him to switch his bat.This sanction ultimately affected Essex's championship aspirations against Surrey. Without the point deduction, Essex would have secured third position instead of their eventual fourth-place finish.",Rajasthan royals batsman simron hetmyer was inspected by the umpire during an ipl match against royal challengers bengaluru in jaipur.

What happened to Yankees’ Marcus Stroman?

Yankees’ manager Aaron Boone hopes for a quick return

“Hoping it’s not long, the MRI was good, but he had some swelling in there somewhere. Trying to eliminate that, hopefully get him ramped up pretty quick and hopefully it’s something that really helps him moving forward.”

“I think that was due to the knee.”

It has been a difficult time for the New York Yankees, after their pitcher Marcus Stroman injured his left knee, and was sent to the 15-day injured list. Stroman received a cortisone shot that worked on helping in reducing the swelling, however, the tests show no serious damage. Meanwhile, Yankees’ manager Aaron Boone is hoping for Stroman to recover quickly.During his last game, Marcus Stroman might have been left injured, following which, he gave up five runs and struggled to finish his pitches properly. It was likely because of the knee issue.Well, so far in the game, Stroman has given up at least 12 runs in just over 9 innings. Stroman’s injury could hurt his chance to earn an $18 million option next year, which depends on how many innings he pitches.Media reports claimed that Clarke Schmidt will be taking Stroman’s spot. Schmidt will be coming back from the injured list. He will be making his season debut on Wednesday against the Kansas City Royals at Yankee Stadium.Due to his injuries, Schmidt faced issues with his back and shoulder, but he managed to secure 61 pitches and claims he’s doing well.The New York Yankees’ team manager, Aaron Boone shared an update with the media. He said that while Marcus Stroman has been sent to 15-day injured list due to left knee inflammation, the MRI exam has revealed swelling, but nothing beyond that.Further, Boone reacted and said he hopes that Stroman’s injury is not too bad and he’s able to recover from it quickly. Boone said:When Boone watched video back from that start, he said he could notice Stroman’s injuries as he was not finishing his delivery properly on his front (left) leg.

When and where to watch the Golden State Warriors play tonight against the Los Angeles Clippers (April 13, 2025)?

Theface a high-stakes regular-season finale against the Los Angeles Clippers, but their chances took a hit withinjury status in question. The star guard suffered a thumb injury during Friday’s game against the Portland Trail Blazers, leaving his availability uncertain for Sunday’s critical matchup.Tonight’s game carries a ""Game 7"" intensity, with both teams fighting to avoid the Play-In Tournament. The Warriors (48-33) and Clippers are battling for the sixth seed in the Western Conference, and a win would secure Golden State’s direct playoff berth.Key implications for the Warriors:- A win clinches the sixth seed.- A loss forces them to rely on other results:- Utah Jazz must beat the Minnesota Timberwolves (both teams tied at 48-33).- If Jazz lose, the Houston Rockets must defeat the Denver Nuggets (49-32). Stephen Curry is listed as questionable for today’s crucial match against the Clippers. Curry’s absence would be a major blow for the Warriors. The 37-year-old has been instrumental in their second-half surge, averaging:Since acquiring Jimmy Butler at the trade deadline, Golden State has gone 23-8, but Stephen Curry’s leadership and scoring remain irreplaceable.While the Warriors sweat over Curry’s status, the Clippers are expected to have most of their rotation available. This puts Golden State at a significant disadvantage if their star guard sits.The Warriors vs Clippers tips off at 3:30 p.m. ET, capping off a full slate of NBA games on the final day of the regular season. The outcome will shape the playoff picture, making this a must-watch for basketball fans.Stephen Curry’s status will be updated closer to game time, but one thing is certain, and that is if he’s out, the Warriors face an uphill battle to secure their playoff spot.Also read: Stephen Curry demands ""Game 7 mentality"" as the Golden State Warriors face do-or-die clash with the Los Angeles Clippers: ""I don't want to be too dramatic!""

Rory McIlroy secured his first Masters victory and completed golf's career Grand Slam on Sunday at Augusta National , defeating Justin Rose in a sudden-death playoff with a four-foot birdie putt. The world number two from Northern Ireland overcame multiple setbacks during the final round, including squandering the solo lead three times, to join the elite group of players who have won all four major championships.McIlroy's historic triumph came after 17 attempts at the Masters, making him the sixth golfer alongside Jack Nicklaus, Tiger Woods, Gary Player, Gene Sarazen, and Ben Hogan to achieve the career Grand Slam.""It feels incredible. This is my 17th time here. I was wondering if it would ever be my time. I'm thrilled and so proud to be able to call myself a Masters champion,"" McIlroy said.The victory earned McIlroy a record $4.2 million prize from the tournament's $21 million purse, along with the coveted green jacket .""The last 10 years coming here with the burden of the Grand Slam on my shoulders and trying to achieve that, I'm sort of wondering what we're all going to talk about going into next year's Masters,"" McIlroy reflected.The dramatic finale unfolded when McIlroy needed a par on the 72nd hole to win but hit his approach into a greenside bunker and missed a five-foot par putt, forcing a playoff with Rose at 11-under 277.""My battle today was with myself. How I responded to setbacks, that's what I'll take from this week,"" McIlroy stated.In the playoff, Rose's approach landed 15 feet from the hole, while McIlroy placed his shot within four feet. After Rose missed his birdie attempt, McIlroy made his putt to clinch the victory.""I've dreamed about that moment for as long as I can remember,"" McIlroy said.The emotional win triggered an outpouring of feelings as McIlroy dropped to his knees on the 18th green, crying and later embracing his caddie Harry Diamond, wife, and daughter while fans chanted his name.""There was a lot of pent up emotion that came out on that 18th green. A moment like that makes all the years and all the close calls worth it,"" McIlroy shared.The 35-year-old's journey to victory included overcoming a double-bogey start that erased his initial two-shot lead, briefly falling behind Bryson DeChambeau before reclaiming the lead through two-shot swings on consecutive holes.""I would say it was 14 years in the making, from going out with a four-shot lead in 2011 and feeling I could have done something there,"" McIlroy recalled, referencing his previous Masters disappointment.McIlroy's final round of 73 included a double-bogey at the par-five 13th and a bogey at 14, but he responded with crucial birdies at the 15th and 17th holes.""It's the best day of my golfing life. I'm very proud of myself for never giving up and always fighting back,"" McIlroy declared.Rose mounted a strong challenge with a closing round of 66, including birdies on six of the last eight holes, but ultimately fell short in the playoff.The victory marked McIlroy's third title of the year, following wins at The Players Championship and the Pebble Beach Pro-Am, bringing his career US PGA Tour victories to 29.","Rory mcilroy completed golf's career grand slam on sunday at augusta national.
