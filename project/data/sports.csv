LeBron James details first knee injury of his life, which made him miss the Met Gala

The Los Angeles Lakers ' season wrapped up with a disappointment. And the small losses aside, the biggest regret for the team's loyalists is the fact that another season just went by where LeBron James' prime has gone to waste as he had to move aside after sustaining a knee injury. LeBron suffered a Grade 2 MCL sprain in his left knee from his collision with DiVincenzo in Game 5, and during a recent appearance on a podcast, he revealed he hinted at his retirement.In fact, as per some rumours, James may become a free agent this summer, but retirement is also a possibility. The star has spoken extensively about this decision in recent offseasons, and it appears that the end of his career is approaching.This season, James averaged 24.4 points, 7.8 rebounds, and 8.2 assists, and many experts believe that the next season might even be his final. It's no secret that James' 2025 season was cut short due to a knee injury, which even made him skip the Met Gala. On the latest episode of the 'Mind the Game' podcast with Steve Nash, LeBron revealed something surprising.King James, as he's fondly known as admitted that this is the first knee injury of his life! ""In my 22-year career, this is my first knee injury. I've had regular tendonitis, patella, all that stuff, but this is the first time I have had a sustained knee injury where you gotta get off your feet. You gotta be shelved for a minute,"" he said.He further explained, ""I knew when the impact happened between me and DiVincenzo, my knee locked up. That's why I stayed on the ground. If the knee would release a little bit, but I knew right then and there with the pain that I had never felt before... My knee bent inward, and that's the MCL injury I picked up. The doc told me that it would take four to six weeks. I have four to six weeks now.""""Even if we won Game 5, I would have missed 6 and 7, and even further. I have some time now to get it right and get back to full strength,"" he added.LeBron disclosed that he was prepared to wait until Friday for an MRI after sustaining the injury on Wednesday, but the pain he experienced upon waking on Thursday made him move up the imaging appointment. LeBron also mentioned retirement during the podcast and shared that he would make this decision with his family after the Lakers' final game of the season.""I haven't had the conversation with the family yet as far as me going forward or whatever the case may be,"" the 40-year-old said during Thursday's episode of Mind the Game with Steve Nash (35:25 mark).

Will Johnson | Episode 3 | The NFL Draft

“They gon have to pay for this sh*t, I promise you. Arizona finna get a dawg,”

Will Johnson brings the attitude and edge Arizona needs



The Arizona Cardinals didn’t just draft a cornerback in the second round—they lit a fire under a young man with something to prove. While their first-round pick, Walter Nolen, satisfied the need for a disruptive force up front, it’s their next move that could shake up the league. When Arizona scooped up Michigan’s Will Johnson with pick No. 35, it wasn’t just a calculated risk.It was a potential franchise-altering moment.Will Johnson wasn’t supposed to be sitting there on Day 2. Not after the career he had at Michigan. Not after locking down top receivers and helping lead the Wolverines to a national championship. He was smart, physical, and polished by most accounts, a first-round lock.But a flagged knee at the NFL Combine changed everything.Suddenly, teams got cold feet. Some erased him from their draft boards entirely. Others just didn’t want to be the ones to take the gamble. Arizona had their eyes on him. They weren’t worried, they were prepared and so was Johnson.he told reporters shortly after being picked.That’s not just post-draft emotion talking. That’s a message one aimed squarely at every single team that passed on him. He knows where he went. He knows who overlooked him. And now, he’s got all the motivation in the world to turn that slide into a legacy.What the Cardinals are getting is more than a corner with good tape. Johnson plays angry in the best way possible. He’s aggressive at the line, doesn’t shy away from physical matchups, and has the instincts of a veteran. Arizona’s secondary needed an attitude. Johnson brings that in spades.Also Read: Kayla Nicole slams critics still calling her ‘Travis Kelce’s Ex’ — When will we stop defining women by the men they dated?

Stephen Curry prioritizes recovery amid playoff pressures

During the high-pressure NBA playoffs, the desire to ignore pain is strong. Still, Stephen Curry of the Golden State Warriors is prioritizing caution over impulse. After he got a Grade 1 left hamstring strain in Game 1 against the Minnesota Timberwolves, Curry spoke honestly about the urge to return too soon. 'I'm not rushing back,' he remarked, aware of how misleading these injuries can be.His decision reflects a dedication to his long-term health instead of short-term success, even while his team competes without him.Stephen Curry got hurt early in Game 1, scoring 13 points in just 13 minutes before leaving the game. An MRI showed he has a Grade 1 hamstring strain, which will keep him out for at least a week. This is the first muscle strain of his impressive career, making his recovery a bit more complicated. Even though the Warriors won 99-88, missing their star point guard is a big deal as the series moves on.Addressing the media, Curry expressed a measured approach to his rehabilitation. He said, “This is new and from all that or all that I'm learning about how quickly you can get back. There has to be a healing process that is just the way the body works. You can't accelerate it more than what it's telling you. So go be one of those after a week like really reevaluating every day to kind of understand when it's safe, just even think about playing, let alone like how much can you push it?”While Curry is sidelined, the Warriors are counting on their depth and experience. Jimmy Butler, who was brought in during the season, has really shined, picking up the nickname 'Playoff Jimmy' for his postseason performance. Buddy Hield continues to dazzle, adding 24 points and eight rebounds in Game 1 against Minnesota after his impressive 33-point showing in Game 7 against the Rockets. Veteran Draymond Green is making a big impact, offering leadership and versatility on both ends of the floor.Coach Steve Kerr has tweaked the lineup to cover for Curry not being around, bringing in guys like Gary Payton II for defense and giving more playing time to bench players like Pat Spencer and Quinten Post. This smart move is all about keeping the team strong while they wait for Curry to come back.Also Read: Steve Kerr's hilarious reaction to Buddy Hield's uniform mix-up during Warriors' Game 1 win over Timberwolves Even though the Warriors are struggling without their key player, their strong roster and grit provide a silver lining.

The rise of Michael Penix Jr. with a new era for the Falcons



Spending the Day with Falcons QB1 Michael Penix Jr.

Michael Penix Jr. faces his biggest test yet



The Atlanta Falcons didn’t just adjust their quarterback strategy, they blew it up. Kirk Cousins was supposed to be the answer, the veteran stabilizer. Instead, his time under center barely got off the ground before the franchise hit the reset button. In a bold and unexpected move, Atlanta has turned the spotlight to Michael Penix Jr ., a second-year QB with limited experience but unlimited expectations.Penix’s rookie season was short but promising. He started just three games and recorded 114 dropbacks, not much, statistically speaking. But what he did show has people talking. He posted an 87.6 passing grade, a 9.0% big-time throw rate, and a 1.7% turnover-worthy play rate, all ranking among the top five for QBs with 100+ dropbacks in 2024. That’s enough to get fans excited. But is it enough to hand him the keys to the entire franchise?Atlanta isn’t waiting to find out the slow way. They’re throwing Penix into the fire giving him a stacked offense with Bijan Robinson, Drake London, and Kyle Pitts, and expecting results now. The potential is there, no doubt. But can he turn potential into consistency over a full season?Off the field, Penix is already making waves with his confidence. When asked about when he takes off his durag, his response made headlines: “You gotta catch me at like a dinner with Arthur Blank .” Fans loved it.

Jayson Tatum appears in DC’s Superman commercial



But what is Jayson Tatum’s campaign actually about?



It was the worst of times, as some fans called out the timing of the Boston Celtics standout Jayson Tatum ’s Superman campaign release. Tatum’s classic appearance wearing a black suit complemented with a white shirt and a black tie with a sunglass to go with the costume, could not suppress the playoff worries that Celtics fans have. Undoubtedly, the timing of the commercial couldn’t be any weirder.Boston Celtics forward Jayson Tatum has officially entered superhero territory.As part of a collaboration with DC Studios , Tatum stars in a playful, high-energy docuseries-style campaign promoting Superman, the upcoming blockbuster film by James Gunn . The campaign blends NBA playoff buzz with big-screen anticipation, offering fans a behind-the-scenes look at how one of basketball’s biggest stars channels the Man of Steel both on and off the court.While the Celtics were reeling from a tough Game 2 loss to the New York Knicks, Tatum’s “Superman” ad hit the airwaves. In particular, the timing raised more than a few eyebrows. Boston had blown a 20-point lead for the second straight game, and Tatum struggled under pressure, scoring only 13 points while committing a costly turnover in the game’s final moments. Just a day later, the new spot dropped, drawing mixed reactions online.A day off for Superman— Enter Jayson Tatum. The docuseries-style promo centers on a question: What happens when Superman needs a break? That’s when Tatum, portrayed as a mild-mannered Midwesterner with hidden powers, steps in. The commercial highlights the similarities between the Celtics star and Clark Kent, from their shared small-town roots to their “looks great in glasses” appeal. It’s clever, charming, and surprisingly self-aware, offering a more human side of Tatum while tapping into the massive cultural pull of the Superman franchise.The ad shows a smart cross-promotional move from DC Studios with the ambition to make the highly anticipated James Gunn movie a blockbuster. By linking up with an NBA All-Star during the playoffs, the campaign lands right at the center of two of the biggest entertainment spheres— basketball and blockbuster cinema.Before the ad hit national TV, Tatum gave fans a sneak peek of his Superman connection through a bold fashion statement. For Game 1, he walked through the arena tunnel carrying a striking pair of custom Superman-themed Tatum 3 sneakers. Designed by sneaker artist Mache, the shoes featured a vibrant blue-and-red color scheme, detailed accents, and the iconic Superman logo. The artist shared his work on Instagram, writing, “Had the great opportunity to create a special pair of custom #superman themed Tatum 3s for @jaytatum0.”The sneakers made waves on social media, becoming an instant hit among fans and sneakerheads alike. Though Boston lost that game, the shoes themselves were a slam dunk in terms of branding and visibility.Not all heroes wear capes… or win every night.As the Celtics aim to regroup for Game 3 at Madison Square Garden, Tatum’s performance will be closely watched. The Superman campaign may have come at a tricky time, but its bold creativity shows that the NBA star is willing to take risks, both on the court and on the screen.Also Read: Anthony Edwards shakes off injury scare, returns to lead Minnesota Timberwolves in Game 2 vs Golden State Warriors The Superman film hits theaters July 11, 2025.
