Taylor Swift is reportedly scared of Travis Kelce's controversial past, ahead of their wedding

Taylor Swift’s boyfriend, Travis Kelce, is speculated to be retiring this season

Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce have had a pretty hard time this season as the Kansas City Chiefs have recorded a pretty average performance on the field this time.With the season coming to an end now, Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce seem to be focused on their wedding. But there is something that is reportedly bothering the billionaire pop star.A few weeks ago, Travis Kelce had confessed on his popular podcast, New Heights, about the time he was suspended when he was caught with marijuana in college.ID@undefinedCaption not available.ID@undefinedCaption not available.ID@undefinedCaption not available.ID@undefinedCaption not available.ID@undefinedCaption not available.ID@undefinedCaption not available.ID@undefinedCaption not available.ID@undefinedCaption not available.ID@undefinedCaption not available.ID@undefinedCaption not available.ID@undefinedCaption not available.ID@undefinedCaption not available.ID@undefinedCaption not available.ID@undefinedCaption not available.It seems Taylor Swift is really bothered by this confession.

Stefon Diggs and Cardi B’s nonstop drama emerges as a growing Patriots distraction ahead of the NFL playoffs despite Drake Maye’s elite MVP form,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/stefon-diggs-and-cardi-bs-nonstop-drama-emerges-as-a-growing-patriots-distraction-ahead-of-the-nfl-playoffs-despite-drake-mayes-elite-mvp-form/articleshow/126404396.cms,"Stefon Diggs, Cardi B (Getty Images)

New England Patriots face growing Stefon Diggs distraction before playoffs

The New England Patriots are winning games again, but the noise around them refuses to fade quietly. Foxborough has always known how to handle pressure. What feels new is how often football headlines now compete with celebrity drama. Inside the building, optimism runs high around a second-year quarterback who already looks like the future of the franchise. Outside it, the conversation keeps drifting toward social media clips, relationship rumors, and tabloid-style chaos that threatens to pull attention away from the field.That contrast defines this Patriots season. On one end is the wholesome image of Drake Maye’s inner circle, led by Ann Michael Maye, whose viral moments feel harmless and community driven. On the other is a constant swirl around Stefon Diggs and his superstar partner Cardi B, a storyline that never seems to cool down for long. The disconnect tests the calm culture Mike Vrabel is trying to protect.The uncomfortable truth is that the New England Patriots need Stefon Diggs, even when the attention becomes exhausting. Strip away the drama and the numbers tell a blunt story. Diggs was the engine of the passing attack, finishing with 1,013 receiving yards. No other wide receiver came close. Kayshon Boutte trailed by 462 yards, while tight end Hunter Henry ranked second overall with 768.Without Diggs’ explosiveness, Drake Maye’s ceiling drops fast.That is why patience exists where it normally would not. If Diggs carried a lower profile, the tolerance would likely be gone already. But playoff football is ruthless, and Maye needs a receiver who can flip momentum in a single snap if the Patriots want a legitimate Super Bowl push.The latest Diggs and Cardi B episode arrived at the worst possible moment, just as the postseason began. The rap icon clapped back at Diggs’ most recent accuser, extending a pattern that has followed the team all year, even after the couple welcomed their newborn son in November. It makes for viral content, not ideal preparation for chasing a Lombardi Trophy.That context made the Patriots’ timing feel deliberate when they released a mic’d up sideline exchange.""I can throw some blocks if you need,"" Diggs quips.""You need to shut the f**k up,"" Vrabel retorts.The exchange came across as playful, almost reassuring. The message was clear. Diggs is engaged. Vrabel is in control. Rookie lineman Will Campbell later praised Vrabel’s ability to connect with different personalities, reinforcing the idea of unity.Still, even the strongest coaches grow weary of constant off-field noise. As the Chargers loom in the Wild Card round, the Patriots know one thing for certain. Talent wins games, but distractions have ended more than a few championship dreams. Whether this one proves manageable will define how far New England Patriots really goes.Also Read: John Harbaugh's future: 3 possible landing spots for former Ravens' coach","New england patriots face growing stefon diggs distraction before playoffs.

Corey Perry placed on non-roster status by Los Angeles Kings



On Wednesday, the Los Angeles Kings said that forward Corey Perry had been given non-roster playing status, which means he can leave the team to deal with a family issue, and the company said that Perry is going home because someone in his family is sick, but they didn't say when he would be back or give any other details.The news comes at a very important time in the NHL season, when the Kings are trying to get into the playoffs in the Western Conference, and Perry's absence is a big change for the team because he has been a key part of the Kings' lineup as a veteran player and a competitive edge, and this news quickly made its way into the latest NHL news roundup, which got a lot of attention from fans all over the league.Corey Perry signed a one-year, $3.5 million contract with the Los Angeles Kings ahead of the 2025–26 campaign after his stint with the Edmonton Oilers. The 40-year-old forward missed the opening weeks of the season due to a preseason knee injury but returned to make a strong impact. In 35 games, Perry registered nine goals and 12 assists for 21 points, placing him among the team’s top contributors alongside Anze Kopitar.Following Perry’s departure, the Los Angeles Kings recalled forwards Andre Lee and Taylor Ward from their American Hockey League affiliate, the Ontario Reign, on an emergency basis.The call-ups are intended to provide immediate depth as the team prepares for upcoming NHL matchups during a tight schedule.Los Angeles currently sits in a Wild Card position in the Pacific Division, making every NHL match today crucial. While Perry’s time away is unrelated to on-ice performance or injury, his leadership will be missed in the dressing room. The Kings organization and fans alike have expressed support, with hopes that Perry will return once his personal situation allows.Also Read: Brad Marchand’s lifestyle: Inside Florida Panthers star’s early life, NHL career, and personal adventures",Corey perry placed on non-roster status by los angeles kings.

Hailey Summers remains Shai Gilgeous-Alexander’s steadfast supporter

In the blinding lights of an arena, people often forget to celebrate those who stood with them through thick and thin. But Oklahoma City Thunder superstar Shai Gilgeous-Alexander continues to prove otherwise. Following a 2024 season that was no less than a dream come true, Shai is riding the wave high in NBA. Even in 2025-26, he’s putting a MVP-calibre numbers.But the All-Star guard took a moment to pivot from stat lines to sentiment, offering a rare glimpse into his private life. Shai in his SI Sportsperson of the Year speech, showed that his smoothest moves aren't reserved just for the hardwood. His heartfelt tribute to his wife, Hailey Summers, quickly went viral, showcasing a side of the ""SGA"" persona that fans rarely see: the devoted family man whose grounded nature fuels his on-court brilliance.In an era of professional basketball defined by a million lights and high pressure, the foundation of Shai’s success appears to be something far away from the arena's roar: Hailey Summers. Shai and Hailey are high school sweethearts and went official in 2017. Summers is a former NCAA Division I soccer player for the University of Albany.The couple got engaged in 2023 and married in 2024. They welcomed their first child, a son named Ares, in 2025.Hailey has been constantly supporting Shai’s career and is an irreplaceable presence in his life, even long before he became a global icon in Oklahoma City.Their relationship stability provides a blueprint in an ever-changing world of professional sports. So, when Shai went up on the stage to receive the 2025 Sports Illustrated Sportsman of the Year award, he knew his support system deserved an equal recognition. “I also want to dedicate this to my beautiful wife, Hailey. She’s my rock…I never want to be between a rock and a hard place, but as long as I’m with my Rock, it will never be a hard place,"" said SGA during his acceptance speech.He added, “I figured I’d say something witty about her cause last time I got emotional, and I cried on stage for like 10 minutes. Thank you for everything that you continue to do and the sacrifices made for me and my family.”While the Thunder continue their pursuit of a championship, Shai made it clear that his priorities are firmly rooted at home. He shared a sentiment that resonated deeply with fans, highlighting the emotional safety net that allows him to play with such fearlessness.Also read: “No deal”: WNBPA VP Brenna Stewart addresses CBA negotiation impasse as extension deadline passes","Oklahoma city thunder guard shai gilgeous-alexander received the 2025 sports illustrated sportsman of the year award.

Ric Flair’s net worth in 2025 and what it reflects

Ric Flair’s wrestling career, earnings, and endorsements

Ric Flair is still one of the most famous names in the history of wrestling. Well into his post-ring prime decades later, the “Nature Boy” still draws eyes with appearances, branding agreements, and a seemingly never-ending coverage of his life and career. But as legendary as he is, Flair's net worth in 2025 paints a much more complex picture than many fans would expect.Years ago, Flair made millions when wrestling boomed, but behind the scenes, financial realities have changed his wealth. A combination of medical expenses, lifestyle spending, and failed business ventures. Combined, they tell the tale of why one of wrestling's all-time greats is often associated with a surprisingly small fortune in his name to this day.One of the finest WWE wrestlers in the world today, Ric Flair’s net worth in the year 2025 is reported close to around $500,000. That number is especially notable for a competitor who held world championships with various promotions and headlined dozens of major events. Thus, financial analysts and wrestling historians alike attribute this to a mixture of high personal expenses during his prime, numerous divorces, and huge medical expenses after a few health crises.ID@undefinedCaption not available.ID@undefinedCaption not available.Even Flair has been open about living the high life, which matched what fans saw on TV. We made this point before, that image solidified his spot in cultural history, but also boxed in his long-term wealth compared to some other big-name athletes who took a more traditional investment approach.Flashy Ric Flair character through NWA, WCW, and WWE, a 16-time world champion, and a two-time Hall of Famer. Flair made a great deal of money throughout his career from top payouts, television, merchandise, and advertising.His income increased after wrestling through endorsements and licensing deals. The guy's visage and catchphrases have graced clothing, collectibles, energy drinks, and pop culture crossovers. Of course, contracts back in the wrestling days sometimes restricted long-term royalties, so a great deal of those nostalgically iconic moments may not have earned the same continuously rolling money as fans might expect.Over the past several years, Flair has embraced brand-forward initiatives. They've ranged from restaurant concepts and cannabis partnerships to drink collaborations, all of which leverage his name for a new generation. In reality, a handful of projects picked up hype early on, while other projects deal with existential crises due to operational complexity or public outcry.Also Read: Bron Breakker and Izzy Dame combined net worth: WWE contracts, endorsements, brand deals, and more","Ric flair's net worth in the year 2025 is reported close to around $500,000.

Chloe Kim injury update ahead of Olympic qualification



Chloe Kim's Olympic hopes face test after training setback



Chloe Kim’s push toward another Olympic moment hit sudden uncertainty after a hard fall during training in Switzerland. The two-time Olympic gold medalist dislocated her shoulder while preparing for a crucial tune-up event ahead of the 2026 Winter Games in Italy. The qualification run is approaching fast, and Kim’s latest injury sparks concerns.The 25-year-old shared a video of the crash from Laax, where she lost control early in a run and slid across the halfpipe. Kim confirmed she is waiting on medical clarity, including an MRI scheduled for Friday, as she tries to stay ready for a qualification round set for February 11.Chloe Kim addressed the injury directly on social media, explaining how a routine session turned serious. “I hate that I have to make this video,” she said. “I took the silliest fall ... and that ultimately resulted in me dislocating my shoulder.”She did not specify which shoulder was affected and admitted the uncertainty remains heavy. “I don’t have much clarity now,” Kim said while stressing she is trying to stay optimistic about competing. Her update offered measured relief alongside concern.“The positive thing is, I have range, I’m not in that much pain, I just don’t want it to keep popping out, which has happened,” she said.“I’m just trying to stay really optimistic. I feel really good about where my snowboarding is at right now, so I know the minute I get cleared and I’m good to go, I should be fine.”Kim added that rest is now the priority. “The only thing I can do is rest/do everything in my power to come back as soon as possible,” she wrote, closing with a light moment, “p.s. I think I am getting old.”Kim is aiming to become the first action sports athlete to win three Olympic gold medals. Shaun White achieved three halfpipe titles across five Games, while Kim has a chance to do it consecutively. Her résumé certainly supports the ambition.She burst onto the Olympic stage in 2018 with gold in Pyeongchang and repeated the feat in Beijing in 2022. Over the years, she has reshaped the sport with historic tricks, including becoming the first woman to land a 1260 in competition and earlier setting milestones with double corks and back to back 1080s.Kim earned her place on the U.S. team by winning a major contest last year and has followed a lighter competition schedule this season. She previously withdrew from a final in Colorado after another shoulder issue that was not considered serious at the time.The Laax Open is scheduled for next weekend; however, her participation remains uncertain. Even with medical clearance, Kim may enter the Olympics without reaching a contest final this season.","U.s. snowboarder chloe kim dislocated her shoulder during training in switzerland.

Brad Marchand comments reignite Auston Matthews Toronto Maple Leafs trade rumor







Toronto Maple Leafs captain Auston Matthews has spent most of the 2025–26 NHL season under intense scrutiny, with every scoring drought or hot streak magnified. Just as Toronto appeared to steady itself and push back into playoff contention, an outside voice brought unwanted noise back into the spotlight.That voice belonged to Florida Panthers winger Brad Marchand. Known around the league for mixing humor with provocation, Marchand chose his words carefully before the NHL match today between the Maple Leafs and Panthers. What sounded like light praise quickly became fuel for fresh trade rumors involving one of the league’s biggest stars.Ahead of the NHL match preview against the Florida Panthers, Brad Marchand suggested that Auston Matthews could break even more records “if he’s still here,” referencing the Toronto Maple Leafs. The veteran winger immediately laughed and acknowledged he might have crossed a line, but the damage was done. Within minutes, the comment circulated widely across NHL updates and social media.The timing was notable. Only weeks earlier, Auston Matthews had been at the center of NHL trade rumors following a slow stretch. While most league insiders dismissed those ideas due to Matthews’ contract status and no-movement clause, speculation never fully disappeared.His recent surge, seven goals and 11 points over five games, had quieted much of the noise before Marchand’s remark brought it roaring back.Matthews has since reinforced his importance by surpassing Mats Sundin as the Toronto Maple Leafs’ all-time leading goal scorer, a milestone that underscores his status as a franchise cornerstone.Ironically, the NHL match results favored Toronto. The Maple Leafs defeated the Florida Panthers 4–2, and Brad Marchand did not return for the third period following an awkward second-period hit.In the end, a single sentence was enough to dominate the NHL news roundup, proving that in Toronto, even jokes can become headlines.Also Read: Brad Marchand’s lifestyle: Inside Florida Panthers star’s early life, NHL career, and personal adventures","Brad marchand's comments reignite auston matthews toronto maple leafs trade rumor.

Why Artemi Panarin could be on move for New York Rangers

the NEW YORK RANGERS have to TRADE Artemi Panarin...

All The Latest Trade Rumours On Andrew Mangiapane...

Artemi Panarin is once again the center of attention while the New York Rangers deal with difficulties in the Eastern Conference. The team, which has been experiencing mixed results and injuries to its key players such as Igor Shesterkin and Adam Fox, is under pressure to make a move that will affect its playoff chances. The very move that the General Manager Chris Drury is going to make is what has the fans and analysts’ eyes glued on him.On the other hand, the Edmonton Oilers have been accompanied by their own difficulties. Mangiapane and Frederic, the forwards, have not been able to get back on track and produce what is expected from them. The management is left with the dilemma of pursuing trades, buyouts, or other roster adjustments. Both players are protected from being traded, which adds to the complications in the decision-making for the Oilers.Vincent Z. Mercogliano of The Athletic reports that the injury to Shesterkin may drive the Rangers into trade deadline activity quicker than anticipated. Sources from the NHL, including James Murphy of RG.Org, suggest that Drury shall deal one of his stars if the team’s output does not get better. Among those whose trades are being talked about are Artemi Panarin, Mika Zibanejad, and Vincent Trocheck, all the while, contract stipulations and cap considerations might limit the options.Panarin, being a UFA-eligible player, has a higher appeal for the contenders who want a short-term boost, but his no-movement clause will further restrict the teams that he can go to.The Rangers have also been rumored to be looking to add forwards, and Kiefer Sherwood from the Vancouver Canucks has been mentioned as a possible target. The $1.5 million salary cap hit of Sherwood is not burdensome, and his two-way play makes him a good candidate; however, his age and Vancouver’s price tag may dictate the direction of the negotiations.At the same time in Edmonton, Gerry Moddejonge from the Edmonton Journal pointed out that Mangiapane and Frederic might be traded if their performance doesn’t improve. Frederic might even get a summer buyout, while Mangiapane’s poor scoring still makes him a trading candidate.The NHL trade deadline is indeed turning out to be the most vital one for each team due to injuries and underperformance that are a common denominator for both the Rangers and the Oilers.

Candace Parker shares why NBA players value her insights in a league dominated by men

Candace Parker once faced backlash from Josh Hart over her critical comments on Jalen Brunson

The NBA is a male-dominated league, and so are its players, one might think. Former WNBA star, Candace Parker has called for the NBA games in a recent occurrence of events. She addressed how the NBA stars might have paid their heartfelt respect for the retired WNBA star when she talks about their game. She appeared during a podcast hosted by Dwyane Wade.The Miami Heat star just wanted to know her opinion regarding the same. Parker spilled the beans just at the right moment and said how she always speaks, citing proper facts. She is considered the greatest of all time in the WNBA and has been a three-time WNBA Champion. She was also the 1st overall draft pick in 2018. Let us dive deep into the conversation between Parker and the Heat star, Dwyane Wade.Earlier in the podcast, “Wy Network,” hosted by Dwyane Wade, Candace Parker was invited to share her valuable insights about everything that has been going on both in the big leagues as well as in the WNBA. But one thing led to another, and the term “respect” came up, where Wade asked Parker if she felt that the NBA stars respected her opinion on their games. She said, “I think so, and here's the thing with respect, I think.Your opinion or you agreeing with what I see may not always be aligned”.“But the respect is what you seek because I wanna come with facts. Now, do we live in a time where everything is like black and white? No, there's a grey area as well”, Candace Parker continued. “But I hope when I come with the black and white facts, that I'm coming with tape, I'm coming with reasons, I'm coming with facts. And that's the way I always try to approach it, where I see something but I need something else to back it up”.One of the greatest players of all time in the WNBA, Candace Parker, once faced a significant downturn from the former basketball player, Josh Hart, for taking a subtle jab at Jalen Brunson. She commented on how Brunson is not an A1 player, for which she has received negative comments from Hart on X. She said, “As a number one option, last year in the playoffs, great first round, second round not so much”.Replying to this tweet, Josh Hart wrote, “Shows you some of them don't actually watch basketball”, to which even actor Ben Stiller agreed. Now, if you look at Brunson’s record, he has averaged 31 points, 6.3 assists, and 5.5 rebounds per game while playing for the Knicks in 2023, and that proves how good a player Brunson is. So the NBA stars taking a negative shot on Parker is justified to every point.Also read: ""They Let Her Get Away With It"" - WNBA Legend Candace Parker rips into the WNBA’s officiating bias after Napheesa Collier's incident","Candace parker once faced backlash from josh hart over her critical comments on jalen brunson.

Transfer portal turmoil looms over Ole Miss ahead of semifinal clash



Jimbo Fisher is tired of the Lane Kiffin Show at Ole Miss, as Kiffin, with the main reason, is no longer the Rebels' coach. Fisher, a former Florida State coach who won a national championship and taught at Texas A&M from 2018 to 2023, aimed at the former Rebels coach in a famous tirade.Fisher said Wednesday on the ACC Network, “It’s selfish, that’s what it is. It’s stupid,” One day before Ole Miss's College Football Playoff (CFP) quarterfinal matchup with Miami.“Here’s why I say that. He wanted to coach and thought he didn’t get his way. ‘So, everybody get on the plane with me, or you don’t have a job.”He makes them all go. Then, because it appears that you don't truly care about the children, he goes down there and takes a PR hit.Kiffin left Ole Miss late last year to take a position at LSU, bringing several assistant coaches with him.If all the outgoing coaches had departed at that point, the Rebels would have been left with a bare-bones coaching staff for the CFP, which would have prompted Kiffin to eventually relent and allow his assistants to remain.Despite the Rebels defeating the third-ranked Bulldogs, 39-34, Jimbo Fisher alleged that Kiffin didn’t believe his former team would advance past Georgia in the second round.“Here’s where he screwed up. He thought they’re going to lose to Georgia, and the portal thing was going to be all over with,” Fisher added.“He said, ‘Oh, I’ll look like a hero.’ Now, he’s got egg on his face because the real Lane came back out. You know what I’m saying? And if those guys were allowed to coach the first game, they should be allowed to coach. Because those kids are doing something that you get one time in your life to ever do. That team and those guys. One time. And as a coach, listen, I’ve left a job. I get that. But if you took them on and said they’re never coming back, that’s fine. You set the rules of the game. You don’t change the rules in the middle of the game.”“As a coach, it’s hurting the kids, and that pisses me off.”No 6. Due to Ole Miss's unexpected triumph over Georgia, the team's semifinal matchup with 10th-seeded Miami on Thursday falls squarely within the crucial transfer portal window. Lane Kiffin has little time to onboard his coaches at LSU and add new players because the college football transfer portal opened on Jan. 2 and closes Jan. 16.Ole Miss offensive coordinator Charlie Weis Jr. and running backs coach Kevin Smith will coach Thursday night despite being LSU-bound after the season, while tight ends coach Joe Cox and receivers coach George McDonald are not expected to be on the sideline, according to ESPN. As Kiffin seeks to rebuild the Tigers, this recruiting window is crucial.Quarterback Demond Williams Jr. signed a $4 million NIL contract with Washington in late December, but he appears to have reneged on it, and most reports imply that the LSU Tigers will be involved. Washington is so angered by the issue that the school will consider legal action against Williams Jr., claiming that the contract was legally binding and that he cannot reenter the portal.Ole Miss is a three-point underdog on Thursday, and Kiffin is unlikely to attend the game after the turmoil last week over whether he would attend the quarterfinal win.Also read: Jimbo Fisher: Who is the record-breaking head coach to get fired by Texas A&M?","Lane kiffin left ole miss late last year to take a position at lsu.

Rashee Rice under NFL investigation as league examines domestic violence claims



The NFL is currently investigating serious domestic violence allegations involving Kansas City Chiefs wide receiver Rashee Rice. The claims emerged after Dacoda Jones , who shares two children with Rice, posted on Instagram, accusing her former partner of abuse during their eight-year relationship. Jones detailed disturbing experiences, including alleged abuse while pregnant and being locked out of her home in freezing temperatures.Jones also shared images showing alleged injuries and property damage, drawing immediate attention on social media. While she did not directly name Rice in her post, the claims quickly went viral, prompting responses from both the NFL and the Chiefs organization. Rice’s grandmother publicly defended him in the comments, adding further attention to the situation.The NFL confirmed on Thursday that it is reviewing the matter under its personal conduct policy, emphasizing that it has been in contact with the Chiefs regarding the allegations. The league’s statement highlights the ongoing process, signaling a structured approach to addressing claims of this nature while maintaining due process for the player involved.The Chiefs also acknowledged awareness of the situation, though they have yet to release a detailed statement.Rice’s attorney told sources that Rice has not been charged with any crime, providing minimal comment on the allegations. This leaves the focus primarily on the league’s review and any potential internal measures the team may take in response.Domestic violence claims in professional sports have increasingly drawn scrutiny in recent years, with the NFL facing pressure to act swiftly and transparently. Previous cases have demonstrated that the league’s investigations can affect player availability, reputations, and contractual decisions, making this review significant not only for Rice but for the Chiefs organization as well.The ongoing investigation underscores the NFL’s commitment to addressing off-field conduct seriously. While Rice has not faced legal charges, the league’s internal review could have implications for his playing status and public perception.As this matter develops, both the NFL and the Chiefs are expected to monitor the situation closely, balancing procedural fairness with the need to address sensitive allegations. Updates are likely as the league continues its review, ensuring that all aspects of the claims are examined thoroughly under established policy guidelines.Also Read: Travis Kelce faces controversy again over “Free 4” support amid Rashee Rice's domestic abuse allegations","Nfl investigates rashee rice after domestic violence allegations.

Isiah Thomas thinks modern NBA is another golden era with LeBron James , Stephen Curry and KD



The Detroit Pistons legend Isiah Thomas surely knows how to put the internet on fire, and that’s what he did with his latest comments. Known for not shying away from a confrontation, Thomas has reignited the most contentious debate in sports: Who’s the greatest?During a January 8, 2026, appearance on the Run It Back show with DeMarcus Cousins and Chandler Parsons, Thomas questioned the logic behind Michael Jordan ’s ""GOAT"" status and why modern NBA is not supporting its players and continuously downplays them in comparison to the last generation. Thomas feels that the current NBA has superior athleticism and record-breaking achievements, and is nurturing the greatest of all time.Isiah Thomas joined the panel of Run It Back on FanDuel TV and dropped some truth bombs. Discussing what the golden era of NBA is, Thomas pointed out that modern NBA has some of the biggest stars, yet their obsession to time and again go back to call the 80s and 90s as the golden era of basketball isn’t fair to today’s players who are putting up numbers and leading charts.He said, “Our era is considered to be the golden era. This is what I don’t understand about your era, right? You guys are playing with arguably the greatest player that ever played, and you do not say this, but y’all treat him like he ain’t nothing.”He continued to add, “Instead of pumping your era up, y’all go back and say our era was the greatest…you know, Michael Jordan was the greatest. Nobody can ever be greater than Michael Jordan.And then you turn around in your era, LeBron James is in there, and he’s holding every single basketball record. I mean every single one of them. You looking at Kevin Durant, you looking at Steph Curry, but then when you say who’s the greatest, y’all talk about the guy who gave y’all some shoes and warmups. ”To Thomas, it is dishonest and ignorant to call someone else the greatest when LeBron James has surpassed legendary benchmarks once thought untouchable, such as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar’s scoring record and Magic Johnson’s assist totals.Also read: “Everything is TBD"": LeBron James' wilding reply after turning 41","Isiah thomas thinks modern nba is another golden era with lebron james, stephen curry and kd.

Evgeni Malkin trade rumors with Pittsburgh Penguins







Speculation is beginning to build across the league as NHL news roundup chatter links Evgeni Malkin to a possible late-season storyline. Although the Pittsburgh Penguins remain focused on staying competitive, outside interest around the veteran center has resurfaced as the trade deadline draws closer.At this stage, nothing is concrete. Malkin has been sidelined with an upper-body injury, and the Penguins are still evaluating their position in the playoff race. However, in a season where unexpected moves often shape contenders, rival teams may at least be monitoring whether an opportunity could arise.Current NHL trade rumors suggest the Minnesota Wild could be a team quietly doing its homework on Evgeni Malkin. This does not indicate active negotiations, but rather exploratory interest should the Pittsburgh Penguins’ situation shift closer to the deadline.Any scenario involving Malkin would come with significant hurdles. He is in the final year of his contract with the Pittsburgh Penguins and holds a full no-movement clause. This is meaning a trade could only happen if he personally approves it.From the Minnesota Wild’s perspective, adding a proven playoff performer could be appealing if they believe a deep run is realistic. The Wild have shown willingness to be aggressive in past deadlines, and a player of Malkin’s experience could theoretically complement their existing core.Still, this remains speculative rather than imminent.Health is another major variable. Malkin has missed several games, and his return timeline will likely influence both NHL updates and internal Penguins decisions. If Pittsburgh remains in the postseason hunt, moving a franchise cornerstone would make little sense.For now, this remains firmly in the “what if” category. Until Evgeni Malkin returns to the lineup and the standings become clearer, the idea of the Minnesota Wild pursuing him should be viewed as a possibility; not a prediction.Also Read: Brad Marchand’s lifestyle: Inside Florida Panthers star’s early life, NHL career, and personal adventures","Pittsburgh penguins center evgeni malkin has been sidelined with an upper-body injury.

Key players Adam Fox and Igor Shesterkin out, Rangers rely on Miller ahead of Sabres clash



GOTTA SEE IT: J.T. Miller's Rebound Wins Game 5 For The Canucks

The New York Rangers head into Thursday night’s matchup against the Buffalo Sabres facing a familiar test of staying competitive while key pillars are missing. Injuries to Adam Fox and Igor Shesterkin have reshaped the lineup and raised questions about how long the team can hold its ground in a tight Eastern Conference race.There is some balance, though. J.T. Miller is expected to return after missing seven games, offering an immediate boost to a roster suddenly short on stability and star power.Adam Fox and Igor Shesterkin both suffered lower-body injuries during Monday’s overtime loss to the Utah Mammoth at Madison Square Garden, leaving the Rangers without arguably their two most indispensable players. Fox was placed on long-term injured reserve and must miss at least 10 games and 24 days, making him ineligible to return before Jan. 31. Even then, coach Mike Sullivan stopped short of guaranteeing his availability. Shesterkin, injured earlier in the same game, was placed on injured reserve with no clear timetable.The absence of Fox is not new territory for New York. This marks his second LTIR stint in just over five weeks. During the previous stretch without him, the Rangers went 6-5-3, struggled offensively, and saw their power play efficiency dip sharply.The contrast was stark when Fox briefly returned, as New York scored freely and moved the puck with far more pace and precision.Vladislav Gavrikov will get the first opportunity to run the top power-play unit alongside Vincent Trocheck, Miller, Mika Zibanejad, and Artemi Panarin. It is a different look, but one the coaching staff believes can function without forcing Gavrikov to play outside his strengths. Simplicity and decision-making, rather than replication of Fox’s elite skill set, will be the focus.In goal, Jonathan Quick is set to start against Buffalo and is expected to shoulder most of the workload while Shesterkin is sidelined. Despite a modest win-loss record, Quick’s underlying numbers have been strong, and his relief appearance Monday offered reassurance inside the room. Spencer Martin has been recalled from Hartford to provide depth, while Scott Morrow steps in on defense.Miller’s return adds a much-needed offensive boost and edge. He has 22 points in 35 games and remains a central piece of New York’s forward group. The Rangers sit seventh in the Metropolitan Division, just three points out of a wild-card spot, leaving little margin for drift.Without Fox and Shesterkin, details will matter more. Structure, discipline, and collective effort will decide whether the Rangers can stay in the playoff picture until their lineup is whole again.Also Read: New York Rangers injury crisis deepens as Igor Shesterkin and Adam Fox are sidelined in upcoming games","Rangers rely on j.t.

Poll Should Magnus Carlsen be held accountable for his emotional outbursts during games? Yes, he should face consequences No, it's just part of the game It depends on the situation





NEW DELHI: Magnus Carlsen 's brilliance over the board is unquestioned, but his repeated emotional outbursts are increasingly sparking debate over the image they project — especially to the next generation of chess players. The latest flashpoint came during the World Rapid and Blitz Championships in Doha, where the world No. 1's visible frustration once again grabbed headlines, raising concerns about sportsmanship and accountability in elite chess.Carlsen's anger boiled over after defeats in Doha, most notably against India's Arjun Erigaisi, when he slammed the board in frustration. It echoed scenes from Norway Chess last year, where he thumped the table following a shock loss to D Gukesh. These were not isolated incidents. During the same event in Doha, Carlsen was involved in four separate controversial moments, including one where he scattered pieces in time trouble, leading to an illegal move and eventual concession after an argument with the arbiter.While Carlsen went on to silence critics with yet another triumph — his 20th world title and ninth Blitz crown — the manner of his conduct has divided opinion within the chess community.Former Gukesh coach and Grandmaster Srinath Narayanan acknowledged that emotion has a place in the sport but warned of its consequences. “A certain kind of expression of emotion is good for chess. We need those expressions because people generally don't see what is happening to a chess player's mind,” he told The Indian Express. “The danger… is that people perceive it to be something cool. And Magnus is very influential… kids look up to him. ”That concern was echoed by Levon Aronian, who criticised the normalisation of such behaviour. “I don't think we should be normalising tantrums like that,” Aronian wrote on X, noting that loud outbursts can disrupt other players and would attract penalties in many sports.Despite criticism, FIDE has shown little appetite to formally censure Carlsen. The governing body insisted that such moments are part of an “open and engaged” sporting ecosystem and stressed that the growing visibility and commercial success of chess remains its priority.For critics, that stance is precisely the problem. Srinath argued that financial penalties or reprimands would send a clear message. “Leaving it unaddressed… kids get the message that it is a cool thing to do,” he said.","Magnus carlsen slammed the table after losing to arjun erigaisi in doha.

NEW DELHI: For England, winning the Ashes in Australia has always felt less like a sporting challenge and more like a test of fate. Tours come and go, and captains come back home to the freezing cold with harsh lessons.The sun is unforgiving, the crowds hostile, and the margins brutal. That is why the winter of 2010–11 remains frozen in time, the last, and perhaps most complete, Ashes triumph by England on Australian soil, achieved under the calm, almost understated leadership of Andrew Strauss.It was not a victory built on bravado or bluster. There were no bold declarations of intent, no verbal duels, no chest-thumping celebrations.Instead, England’s success was rooted in something rarer on Australian tours: control.England arrived as the No.1 Test side in the world, Ashes holders after the 2009 home series, and armed with a belief that this team was different. They were organised, physically prepared and mentally hardened by years of overseas failure.This was not a side hoping Australia would falter. It was one that trusted its own process.The first Test at Brisbane set the tone for everything that followed. England batted first and refused to be hurried.At the centre of it all was Alastair Cook, then just 25, who played an innings that came to define the series. He batted for nearly two days, leaving, nudging and wearing down Australia’s bowlers with monk-like patience.Cook made 235, an epic effort of concentration that drained the life out of the home attack. Rain eventually denied England a win, but the psychological shift was unmistakable. Australia, so used to dictating tempo at the Gabba, had been forced to react.The decisive moment came in Adelaide, under lights. The pink ball was still years away, but England’s bowlers made the most of evening conditions. James Anderson, at the peak of his powers, swung the ball late and viciously, exposing Australia’s fragile batting. England dominated every session and won by an innings. It was their first Ashes Test win at Adelaide Oval in decades, and it rattled the hosts.If Adelaide gave England belief, Perth gave them authority.The WACA had long been Australia’s ultimate weapon — fast, bouncy and intimidating.

Edmonton Oilers place Adam Henrique on injured reserve, return unlikely before Feb. 25



Edmonton Oilers forward Adam Henrique is facing an extended absence after the team confirmed Wednesday that the veteran center will be sidelined until after the Olympic break due to an undisclosed injury. The update adds another layer of uncertainty for an Oilers roster navigating a demanding stretch of the NHL schedule.Henrique’s injury surfaced Tuesday night against the Nashville Predators, when he exited in the opening period and did not return. Edmonton still cruised to a 6-2 win, but the loss of a dependable two-way forward was evident. Head coach Kris Knoblauch described the situation postgame as “a little while,” a timeline that is now clearer but no less concerning.The Oilers have officially moved Henrique to injured reserve, confirming he will miss games through the Olympic break. The earliest possible return date is Feb. 25, when Edmonton resumes its season against the Anaheim Ducks. For a team pushing for consistency in the Western Conference standings, the timing is far from ideal.The veteran center logged just 2:26 of ice time before leaving the game against Nashville, taking two shifts and blocking one shot.While his stat line from that night was minimal, Henrique’s broader role extends beyond numbers. He has been a steady presence down the middle, offering defensive reliability, faceoff support, and secondary scoring when needed.Through 43 games this season, Henrique has two goals and eight assists while playing just under 14 minutes a night. He has been trusted in tough matchups, used regularly on the penalty kill, and gives the Oilers flexibility throughout the lineup when adjustments are needed. Losing that element forces the Oilers to reshuffle their bottom-six forward group, particularly during a stretch where depth often determines outcomes.Edmonton’s coaching staff will now have to adjust without Henrique in the lineup. His minutes are likely to be spread around, with a mix of internal options stepping into larger roles. The Oilers have relied on their core players for much of the season, but stretches like this often reveal how well the rest of the roster can respond when called upon.As the NHL season pauses for the Olympic break, the focus will shift to Henrique’s recovery and whether he can return at full strength. Until then, Edmonton must manage without a veteran who quietly stabilized key parts of its forward rotation, a challenge that could shape the weeks ahead.","Edmonton oilers place adam henrique on injured reserve, return unlikely before feb. 25.
