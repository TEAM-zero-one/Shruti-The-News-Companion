NEW DELHI: India’s white-ball captain Rohit Sharma has finally addressed questions surrounding his future in One Day Internationals (ODIs). In a candid conversation with senior journalist Vimal Kumar, Rohit made it clear that while he’s not done just yet, he’s very aware of when to walk away.The veteran opener emphasised his evolved approach to batting, saying, ""I used to play the way I used to, I took my time. Earlier, I would play 30 balls in the first 10 overs and be at just 10 runs. But if I play 20 balls now, why can't I score 30, 35, or even 40 runs? And on the days when I get going, hitting the accelerator, scoring 80 runs in the first 10 overs isn't bad at all. That's how I think now.""READ ALSO: 'Bekaar': Rohit Sharma makes shocking statement about naturally-gifted player ""I’ve done it; I’ve scored the runs I was meant to. Now, I want to play cricket in a different way. I’m not taking any of this for granted. Don’t assume that things will just keep going the same way, that I’ll keep scoring 20 or 30 runs and just continue playing. The day I feel like I’m not able to do what I want to do on the field, I’ll stop playing. That’s for sure. But right now, I know that what I’m doing is still helping the team,"" he added.READ ALSO: Rohit Sharma hits back at criticism: 'Defending myself is waste of time' Rohit has been a key pillar in India's ODI setup, with 11,168 runs in 273 matches at an impressive average of 48.76. Under his leadership, India clinched the T20 World Cup in 2024 and the Champions Trophy earlier this year, further cementing his legacy in white-ball cricket.While he called time on his T20 career after the Barbados final, the 37-year-old recently stepped away from Test cricket after an 11-year career, having played 67 Tests and scored 4,301 runs. His highest Test score, 212, came during a memorable series against South Africa in 2019.While he’s shut the door on red-ball cricket, just like his compatriot Virat Kohli, who hung his Test boots on Monday in an unexpected retirement call, both Kohli and Rohit remain committed to ODIs, for now. Perhaps the pair is keeping an eye on the upcoming 2027 ODI World Cup.Rohit’s message is clear: he’s still hungry, still driven, but when the moment comes to step aside, he’ll do it on his own terms.","Rohit sharma has finally addressed questions surrounding his future in one day internationals.

Finally, Dallas catches a break—after the unbearable hardship of having Luka Doncic on their roster.” Another said, “So we’re all going to pretend the NBA didn’t tell the Mavs that if they traded Luka to get paired with Bron, they’d get Flagg in return? I’m so sure.”Dragging Mavericks general manager amid the controversy surrounding the Luka Doncic trade , an X user wrote, “Nico Harrison is in sight of relief.” Another asked, “What did Nico Harrison know…” One more said, “Probably because you rigged it as a thank you for giving Luka to the biggest market. stop rigging drafts.”A tweet read: “Mavericks trade Luka to lakers and end up with number one pick?

Golden State Warriors’ playoff journey so far

Thehave officially listed superstar guardas out for Game 4 of their Western Conference Semifinals matchup against the Minnesota Timberwolves due to a grade 1 hamstring strain . The injury, sustained during their hard-fought series against the Houston Rockets, has left the Warriors without their leading scorer in a critical game. Stephen Curry’s hamstring strain is considered mild (grade 1), but the Warriors are taking a cautious approach. While he won’t suit up for Game 4, there’s optimism he could return as early as Game 6 if the series extends that far.Injury details:- Type: Grade 1 hamstring strain- Status: Officially out for Game 4- Recovery window: 7–10 days (possible Game 6 return)With Stephen Curry sidelined, the Golden State Warriors will rely heavily on their supporting cast to even the series. Draymond Green, Klay Thompson, and Jonathan Kuminga must step up offensively, while Chris Paul’s playmaking becomes even more critical.Warriors’ keys to winning without Curry:- Increased ball movement to compensate for lost scoring- Aggressive defense to force Timberwolves turnovers- Bench production from Moses Moody and Gary Payton IIAfter barely scraping into the playoffs via the play-in tournament, the Warriors defied expectations by eliminating the second-seeded Houston Rockets in a grueling seven-game series. Their underdog story continued as they stole Game 1 against the Timberwolves on the road, but a Game 3 loss at home has shifted momentum.Key points from their playoff run:- Secured 7th seed by beating Memphis in the play-in- Defeated Houston in a full seven-game series- Took Game 1 in Minnesota but dropped Game 3 at Chase CenterHow to watch Golden State Warriors vs Minnesota Timberwolves Game 4The Golden State Warriors and Minnesota Timberwolves tip off at Chase Center on Monday night at 10:00 p.m. EST.

Unmukt Chand Exclusive: Why he moved to the USA, playing in T20 leagues and ambitions

NEW DELHI: Virat Kohli ’s wife and acclaimed actress Anushka Sharma shared a deeply emotional message on social media following Kohli’s announcement of retirement from Test cricket on Monday. Kohli brought the curtains down on an illustrious 14-year-long red-ball career, having featured in 123 Tests since making his debut against West Indies in 2011. Following Sachin Tendulkar’s retirement in 2013, Kohli emerged as India’s batting mainstay in the longest format.“They’ll talk about the records and the milestones — but I’ll remember the tears you never showed, the battles no one saw, and the unwavering love you gave this format of the game. I know how much all this took from you,” Anushka wrote on Instagram, sharing a heartfelt photo with her husband.“After every Test series, you came back a little wiser, a little humbler — and watching you evolve through it all has been a privilege,” she added.“Somehow, I always imagined you’d retire international cricket in whites — But you’ve always followed your heart, and so I just want to say my love, you’ve earned every bit of this goodbye,” she wrote in her tribute.Kohli’s decision to retire came just days after Rohit Sharma also stepped away from Test cricket, leaving India without two of its most senior batters ahead of the upcoming tour of England. The five-Test series begins on June 20, and India will now need to appoint a new captain and rework its batting core.Reflecting on his journey, Kohli shared his own thoughts in an Instagram post. “As I step away from this format, it’s not easy — but it feels right,” he wrote. “It’s been 14 years since I first wore the baggy blue in Test cricket. Honestly, I never imagined the journey this format would take me on. It’s tested me, shaped me, and taught me lessons I’ll carry for life.”Over his career, the 36-year-old scored 9,230 runs, including 30 centuries and 31 fifties, at an average of 46.85. As captain, he led India in 68 Tests, securing 40 wins — the most by any Indian Test skipper.Kohli often spoke about his love for the format and the mental and emotional challenges it presented. He once described his fondness for the grind of Test cricket, saying it included “the quiet grind, the long days, the small moments that no one sees but that stay with you forever.”“I am walking away with a heart full of gratitude — for the game, for the people I shared the field with, and for every single person who made me feel seen along the way,” he wrote in his farewell message. “I will always look back at my Test career with a smile. #269, signing off.”In terms of records, Kohli ended his career as India’s fourth-highest run-scorer in Tests behind Sachin Tendulkar (15,921), Rahul Dravid (13,265), and Sunil Gavaskar (10,122). He holds the record for the most double hundreds by an Indian in Tests — seven — one more than Tendulkar.Kohli’s legacy as captain is equally significant. His 40 Test wins surpass the tallies of MS Dhoni (27 from 60 Tests) and Sourav Ganguly (21 from 49 Tests). Globally, he ranks fourth among captains with the most Test wins, behind Graeme Smith (53), Ricky Ponting (48), and Steve Waugh (41).Under Kohli’s leadership, India rose to the No. 1 ranking in Test cricket after he succeeded MS Dhoni in 2014-15. The team held on to that position for nearly five years. His crowning achievement came in 2018 when he led India to a historic first-ever Test series win on Australian soil.","Anushka sharma pays tribute to husband virat kohli on social media.

Taylor Swift emerges as a source of strength as Kelce contemplates life after football

The Kansas City Chiefs can rest easy for now Travis Kelce is returning for at least one more NFL season. While fans speculated about the tight end's potential retirement after multiple Super Bowl wins and a decorated career, recent reports suggest that Taylor Swift played a notable role in influencing his decision to stay on the field.According to sources close to the couple, Taylor Swift encouraged Travis Kelce to continue doing what he loves, highlighting how passionate he is about football and how much joy it brings him.Their relationship, which has been under the public eye since 2023, appears to be more than just romantic it's also a supportive partnership. Insiders say Taylor has been a strong emotional pillar for Kelce, especially as he weighs life beyond football.The full story behind Travis Kelce’s current condition remains unclear, but recent photos of him in New York have definitely stirred a flurry of reactions about his appearance. Dov Kleiman,the American sports media personality and NFL aggregator stated on X , “Yikes: Chiefs star TE Travis Kelce appears to have gained a serious amount of weight this offseason. Looks like the fame is finally getting to him…”Though the Kansas City Chiefs' star appeared fashionable and ready for a commercial shoot, many on social media pointed out that his current shape doesn’t match the usual build of an NFL athlete. Unsurprisingly, the photos sparked a wave of both praise and criticism online. In the pictures, Travis Kelce appears in a relaxed-fit sweater, paired with sunglasses and a sharply groomed haircut.Kelce’s new look has stirred a variety of responses online with some noting that his new hairstyle bore a resemblance to Swift’s ex, Joe Alwyn. One fan commented, “His hair is so confusing to me. It looks different every time we see him,” while another praised his style, saying, “Love the hair and glasses. Taylor looks beautiful as always.”Amid the buzz, some expressed discomfort with the constant media attention, with remarks like, “Leave them alone,” and “It’s actually really weird to post these photos.” Still, many supported the couple’s public appearances, with one user gushing, “They’re so cute together,” and another appreciating Travis Kelce’s behavior, saying, “This is the first guy who treats her like she deserves.”Following the tough loss in Super Bowl LIX, it appears Travis Kelce is making the most of his break. As a seasoned professional, he understands the effort required to excel on the field, and with May still underway, he has ample time to regain his top physical form.On the other hand, Kelce’s commitment to the Chiefs in 2025 is unwavering, as he aims to make the most of what could be his final season. He said, “I love so many people in Kansas City, both in that facility, in the community, and it's home for me now. I don't want to leave that life yet.”“I put in a lot of hard work, and I put in a lot of focus into being the best that I can for K.C. Last year, it didn't end well for us. I just feel like there's a responsibility in me to play out the contract that I initially signed, to give Kansas City and the Chiefs organization everything that I've got, and that's what I'm going to do, man.”Also Read: Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce go dark on red carpet night, sparking breakup whispers Kelce’s determination is clear, he’s ready to give his all for Kansas City and finish strong, no matter what.

India's probable Test squad for England Tour

NEW DELHI: Virat Kohli ’s sudden retirement from Test cricket on Monday has left fans stunned. With the announcement taking the world of cricket by surprise, the internet flooded with a wave of memes, tributes, and speculation about his future in the one-day internationals (ODIs).Having already stepped away from T20 internationals following India's World Cup triumph in 2024, Kohli now remains active only in the 50-over format, prompting widespread assumptions that the 2027 ICC Cricket World Cup could be his final appearance in Indian colours.Social media platforms, especially X (formerly Twitter), exploded with reactions.Fans shared nostalgic throwbacks, emotional edits, and humorous memes, grappling with the idea of a future Indian side without Kohli.Amid the buzz, Kohli’s childhood coach Rajkumar Sharma weighed in, praising the star batter’s extraordinary Test journey and expressing hope for one last hurrah in ODIs.""I salute him for his tremendous contribution to Indian Cricket, and as a coach, I am proud of him for what he has done for the country and the example he has set for the youngsters. Emotionally, it hurts that we won't be seeing him in whites again for the country. I appreciate and back his decision...Hopefully, he will be there to win the ODI World Cup (in 2027) for India, and he will be 100 per cent committed to it,"" Sharma told ANI.Kohli’s Test career, spanning over 14 years, saw highs and lows, but his legacy is unquestionable: 9,230 runs in 123 Tests, 30 centuries, and countless iconic moments.He was instrumental in redefining India’s overseas performance and was the backbone of the side during its transition phase.Yet, his form in recent years faltered, and his final Test campaign in Australia was a shadow of his prime, despite a memorable century at Perth.As fans come to terms with the end of Kohli in whites, all eyes now turn toward his ODI future.Whether the 2027 World Cup will be his swansong remains to be seen. But for now, the internet’s love for Kohli is louder than ever, even if it’s through memes.","Virat kohli's sudden retirement from test cricket has left fans stunned.

India's probable Test squad for England Tour

NEW DELHI: Virat Kohli ’s unexpected decision to retire from Test cricket has left the cricketing world stunned, and his former Delhi and Ranji coach Sarandeep Singh is no exception.In a surprising revelation, the ex-India spinner claimed that Kohli had shown no signs of stepping away from the red-ball format and was actively preparing for India’s upcoming tour of England.“Not at all,” Sarandeep said when asked if Kohli hinted at retiring. “He came to play red-ball cricket (in Ranji Trophy), so he had no thinking like that. Even at that time, he was talking about the England series with the test matches that are coming. So, he was going to play there.""And this time, he would be very much prepared. He said he was going to score maximum hundreds, which he did the last time in 2018 when he went to England. He scored a lot of runs over there. There was nothing like that when he came to play Ranji Trophy matches.""We thought that we would see him on the England tour. He is one of the most senior players. Especially, the England tour is very tough. So, without him, I don't know how the Indian team will manage now.”Kohli had rejoined Delhi’s Ranji squad earlier this year for the game against Railways, signalling his intent to get more game time ahead of the tough overseas series.According to Sarandeep, the 36-year-old was eager to score big in England once more, reminiscent of his brilliant 593-run haul during the 2018 tour.Kohli’s retirement came ahead of the crucial five-match Test series against England, which also serves as the opening leg of India’s World Test Championship 2025–27 cycle.With 123 Tests, 9,230 runs, and a captaincy record of 40 wins in 68 matches, Kohli leaves behind an extraordinary legacy.His final series, the 2024–25 Border-Gavaskar Trophy in Australia, was a mixed bag. Despite a century in the opening Test at Perth, his overall returns were modest, and his vulnerability against the moving ball showed.Still, many believed he had one final chapter left in England. His sudden exit has left a void, not just in the Indian line-up, but also among fans who hoped to see their champion sign off on his own terms.","Virat kohli retires from test cricket after 123 tests, 9,230 runs, and a captaincy record of 40 wins in 68 matches.

A sixth-round surprise puts pressure on Dolphins’ backfield

Mystery lingers over Blake Ferguson’s hidden injury saga

Tua Tagovailoa’s fragility narrative resurfaces despite comparable game time

The Miami Dolphins are heading into the 2025 NFL season surrounded by uncertainty, fueled by unexpected rookie performances and renewed concern over quarterback Tua Tagovailoa ’s long-term durability. As training camp looms, whispers inside the locker room hint at deeper issues simmering beneath the surface, from injury secrets to financial maneuvering.While all eyes were on Miami’s top draft picks, sixth-round selection Ollie Gordon II is turning heads before even taking a snap. The former Doak Walker Award winner from Oklahoma State is no ordinary late-round flyer. Scouts had pegged him as a mid-round steal, and early signs point to him potentially disrupting Miami’s depth chart much sooner than expected. His collegiate résumé suggests he’s more than capable of becoming a feature back, especially if he maintains his explosive playmaking ability.Adding intrigue to the Dolphins’ offseason is the case of long snapper Blake Ferguson, who landed on the Non-Football Injury list last October without public explanation. Known for consistency and professionalism, Ferguson’s absence remains cloaked in mystery. No detailed reports, no official updates—only silence. This has sparked speculation from fans and insiders alike, highlighting the lack of transparency that often surrounds NFL injury management.Tua Tagovailoa continues to be a lightning rod for debate. Though he has logged nearly as many games as Cincinnati Bengals star Joe Burrow, Tua’s injury history—particularly his concussions—has unfairly earned him the ""fragile"" label. Critics ignore the reality that football’s violence spares no one, and durability is often a matter of circumstance more than toughness. The discourse not only affects Tua’s public perception but could influence how the front office views his future in Miami.Beyond health and performance, financial strategy looms large. The Dolphins must weigh future contracts for key players like linebacker Jordyn Brooks and defensive end Jaelan Phillips, both entering critical phases in their careers. These decisions aren’t just about cap space—they impact team chemistry and the franchise’s trajectory.Also Read: Tyreek Hill’s trash talk fuels tension with iShowSpeed and Noah Lyles medalist as fans await the ultimate race The 2025 Dolphins are a team teetering between breakthrough and breakdown. If rookies like Gordon flourish and Tagovailoa can stay healthy, the team may defy expectations. But unresolved injury concerns , contract questions, and internal dynamics must be addressed if Miami wants to find consistency in a stacked AFC East .","The miami dolphins are heading into the 2025 nfl season surrounded by uncertainty, fueled by unexpected rookie performances and renewed concern over quarterback tua tagovailoa ’s long-term durability.

Magazine cover ignites fan backlash over media scrutiny

Calls for privacy highlight celebrity culture fatigue

Once hailed as the ultimate celebrity power couple , Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce have suddenly gone quiet, fueling speculation and fan fatigue. With no recent public appearances, many are now questioning if their high-profile romance was ever more than media hype.Ever since the whirlwind romance between Taylor Swift and NFL star Travis Kelce began making headlines, the couple's public appearances became a hot topic across entertainment and sports media. From Kelce attending Swift’s “Eras Tour” shows to Swift passionately cheering him on during the NFL season, their relationship captured public fascination throughout 2023 and early 2024.But after Swift wrapped up her international tour in December 2024 and Kelce’s Kansas City Chiefs fell short at the Super Bowl in February, the high-profile pair has noticeably stepped back from the spotlight.Their recent absence from major public events—most notably the Met Gala in May 2025—sparked fresh conversations. Although both were invited, they reportedly skipped the prestigious fashion event due to scheduling conflicts. The last time Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce were seen publicly was back in March, dining together at Del Frisco’s Grille in New York City, according to The US Sun.A recent magazine cover questioning Swift and Kelce’s absence drew backlash online, with fans taking to Reddit to voice their annoyance over the tabloid’s narrative. One user shared an image of the cover, captioning it: “It’s not that serious… Genuinely, why are people making their 'disappearance' such a big deal?”Others chimed in with sharp criticism of the media's obsession. “Did they disappear? Or did she just stop getting shoved down everyone’s throats when the tour ended?” one commenter asked. Another added, “I think it’s both. I think Taylor’s PR really overestimated how the ‘NFL princess’ thing was going to land. I think she really got her feelings hurt at the Super Bowl… that’s what caused the NFL’s stark pivot away from her and her ‘hiatus.’”The online discussion also sparked broader commentary about celebrity culture. One user noted, “God forbid if celebrities not be in everything all the time. Football season is over. Her tour is over. That’s it.” Another quipped, “I could never be that obsessed with a celebrity let alone their relationship. It’s very ick. Like stalker to the point of needing arrested.”Ultimately, while the media speculates on the reasons behind the couple's low profile, a large portion of fans appear to be echoing a common sentiment: let them live their lives in peace.

No one cares.”Also Read: Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce desperately tried to stay out of Hollywood sex scandal — but now they may have no choice",Taylor swift and travis kelce's low profile sparks mixed reactions from fans and media.
