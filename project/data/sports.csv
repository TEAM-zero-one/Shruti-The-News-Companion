Micah Parsons consoles young Cowboys fan after emotional reaction



Micah Parsons embraces pressure with Packers’ record contract



When the Dallas Cowboys stunned the NFL world by trading Micah Parsons to the Green Bay Packers, emotions ran high. Fans felt betrayed, pundits questioned Jerry Jones’ move, and a viral clip of a young supporter crying captured that heartbreak. Yet, what stood out was Parsons’ heartfelt response—FaceTiming the child, offering encouragement, and promising a Packers jersey with his iconic No. 1. In that moment, Parsons showed the human side of a blockbuster trade.The trade didn’t just impact analysts and fantasy football rosters—it hit fans on a deeply personal level. One viral TikTok video captured the raw emotion of a young Cowboys fan, filmed by his mother Lesley, breaking down in tears after learning Micah Parsons had been dealt away. What followed turned into one of the most heartwarming moments of the offseason.Parsons himself saw the clip, reached out, and later FaceTimed the devastated child. His words were both empathetic and motivational: “I saw that video, I’m sorry, bruh. I hope you know, in life, things happen that you can’t control, but you just got to keep going.”The four-time Pro Bowler didn’t stop there. He promised the boy a brand-new Packers jersey with his No.1 on it. “Even though you’re a big Cowboys fan, I hope that you still follow me and my career, because that’s what it’s all about. Passionate fans. That just meant a lot to me. I hope you know that.” He even playfully reminded the youngster to focus on school, joking that bad grades might cost him the jersey.For the fan, it was a tough lesson in the business side of sports, but also a reminder that heroes can be human too.The Cowboys received a haul—two future first-round picks and defensive tackle Kenny Clark—in exchange for Parsons. Meanwhile, Green Bay wasted no time, signing him to a four-year, $188 million extension, making him the highest-paid non-quarterback in league history.At his Green Bay introduction, Parsons admitted the reality of the deal hadn’t fully sunk in. “I didn’t think I would be traded,” he said. “But that’s the harsh reality.” Still, he embraced the pressure, noting: “I’d be a fool to not think that there isn’t expectations… But then again, that’s a blessing in itself, that means that they believe in me that much.”Parsons’ staggering $47 million annually sets a new league benchmark, surpassing the record contracts handed out earlier this offseason to Cleveland Browns standout Myles Garrett ($40 million) and Pittsburgh Steelers star T.J. Watt ($41 million).His arrival in Green Bay has energized the locker room, with teammates eager to see the impact he’ll bring to their defense. Left tackle Rasheed Walker — Parsons’ former Penn State teammate — even went as far as to say the addition could put the Packers on a Super Bowl path.Parsons’ first test comes quickly: a month from now, he’ll return to Dallas in a Packers uniform, staring down the very fans who once cheered his every sack.Also Read: Patrick Mahomes teases Travis Kelce with geography joke ahead of Chiefs’ season opener in Brazil","Micah parsons was traded by the dallas cowboys to the green bay packers.

Ravens and Lamar Jackson must overcome Buffalo hurdle



Lamar Jackson’s revenge arc fuels Ravens’ hopes



The Baltimore Ravens enter the 2025 NFL season as one of the league’s hottest title contenders, yet their first step toward a championship won’t come easy. Standing in their way are the Buffalo Bills, a team that has haunted Baltimore in recent years and one that thrives on home turf. For Lamar Jackson and the Ravens, this primetime showdown isn’t just about starting strong—it’s about rewriting an all-too-familiar narrative.Few quarterbacks are as electric as Lamar Jackson, but history has not been kind when he lines up across from Buffalo. CBS Sports analyst John Breech pointed out that Jackson has gone just 1-3 against the Bills, committing six turnovers across those contests. While he’s rushed effectively—averaging 50 yards per game—Buffalo’s defense under Sean McDermott has largely kept him contained.Josh Allen, fresh off an MVP campaign, only widens the challenge. Last postseason, Allen ended Baltimore’s Super Bowl dreams while stretching his streak of home victories to 11. That advantage, paired with Buffalo’s playoff pedigree, has experts leaning toward another Bills win, with Breech predicting a 30-23 Buffalo victory on Sunday night.Still, the Ravens are no longer the same team that fell short last January.General manager Eric DeCosta bolstered the roster with defensive depth and more reliable receiving options, giving Jackson the kind of support he’s needed to thrive. Rookie pass rusher Mike Green has already drawn buzz as a potential Defensive Rookie of the Year, adding bite to Baltimore’s defense.If there’s one quarterback who thrives on proving doubters wrong, it’s Jackson. He accounted for 45 touchdowns last season, including nine games with three or more scores. NFL analyst Douglas Fritz believes Jackson will rise to the occasion again, predicting two passing touchdowns and one rushing score against Buffalo’s defense.Jackson’s ability to spread the ball also makes Baltimore dangerous. In his last big win over the Bills, he completed passes to seven different receivers, showcasing the kind of versatility that could frustrate Buffalo’s secondary. Wideouts Rashod Bateman and Zay Flowers, both primed for breakout seasons, are players the Bills cannot afford to overlook.Ultimately, Week 1 sets the stage for more than just a season opener—it’s a clash of two heavyweight quarterbacks, two title-hungry franchises, and two fanbases desperate for early bragging rights. For the Ravens, this game is about much more than standings. It’s about Lamar Jackson rewriting his story in Buffalo and proving that Baltimore belongs at the very top of the AFC.Also Read: Patriots’ depth chart for Week 1 reveals big names, shock inclusions, and hidden gems for 2025 NFL season","Lamar jackson and the baltimore ravens face the buffalo bills in week 1.

Shaquille O’Neal roasted WNBA coach with a hilarious Charles Barkley reference

Shaquille O’Neal also roasted Nikola Jokic with his two-word reaction

NBA Veteran Shaquille O’Neal is known for his hilarious roasts throughout the league. He has made fun of many prominent players of the NBA, let alone the others. In a recent series of events, the former Los Angeles Lakers player appeared on a podcast with one of the WNBA’s Las Vegas Aces assistant coaches, Tyrone Ellis. Shaquille O’Neal appeared on Straight Game Podcast along with Mike Bibby last week. Who would have known that the Aces assistant coach could have gotten roasted by a legendary NBA player on his own show? Well, everything is possible when one has Shaquille O’Neal on board. Here’s what the former Lakers star had to say:NBA legend Shaquille O’Neal seems to be throwing shade at anyone he encounters. In a recent podcast, he spoke about the Aces assistant coach, Tyrone Ellis, who looks somewhat like the television analyst Charles Barkley, with a hilarious Ozempic joke. He compared the coach to the television analyst and said, “Why you look like if Charles Barkley overdosed on Ozempic?”Well, it is evident enough that no one can defeat Shaquille O’Neal both on and off the court, and when it comes to roasting someone with mere words, he has his ways. The uncanny resemblance made everyone laugh. He appeared on the podcast with Mike Bibby last week.Just to be clear, Ozempic is a medicine consumed by adults with type 2 diabetes, and can cause weight loss as its side effect. But in this case, Shaquille O’Neal taunted Tyrone Ellis for his heavy weight. However, he is way slimmer than Charles Barkley, and hence the comparison.Earlier in August, Shaquille O’Neal didn’t fail to roast the Denver Nuggets center Nikola Jokic.His mere two-word bombshell was enough to leave everyone utterly amused. The former Los Angeles Lakers player compared Nikola Jokic to a “Slavian Chicken”, and the brutal reference was hilarious in itself.This is a known fact that Shaquille O’Neal can roast anyone, and in this case, it was the Nuggets player Nikola Jokic. The NBA veteran often uses the term “Barbecue Chicken” to refer to his opponents, knowing well where and how to poke them.Apart from this, he has no grudges with anyone, either from inside or outside the league. Shaquille O’Neal can literally have players like Nikola Jokic for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and no one has ever questioned that.Also read: Shaquille O’Neal roasts Nikola Jokic with a two-word hilarious comment","Shaquille o’neal appeared on straight game podcast along with mike bibby last week.

The NFL has tightened up its rulebook for the 2025 season and the impact is already being felt. From new restrictions on how players celebrate to major shifts in how first downs are measured and overtime is handled, the league is making clear it wants cleaner play and better accuracy. Here's a breakdown of what’s changing this season and why it matters.One of the most noticeable rule changes this season is already making waves. In the Browns’ final preseason game, defensive end Isaiah McGuire made a big stop on Rams running back Jarquez Hunter, then celebrated with a stomp and the now-banned “nose wipe” gesture. The officials immediately flagged him for it.The “nose wipe,” popularized by Dallas Cowboys star CeeDee Lamb, is now one of several gestures specifically outlawed by the league. The rulebook lists it alongside things like throat slashes and gun gestures – moves the NFL now labels as “violent.” A 15-yard penalty applies to all of them.Another big change for 2025: overtime just got fairer. Starting this season, both teams are guaranteed at least one possession in OT — even in regular season games. It’s a shift from the old rule where a touchdown on the first drive would end the game right then and there.Now, if one team scores a touchdown, the other still gets a chance. If both get a possession and the game is still tied, it moves into sudden death. If the 10-minute overtime period ends without a winner, the game ends in a tie. It’s the same rule already used in the playoffs – and fans have been calling for it in the regular season for years.The league’s experimental “dynamic kickoff” format is here to stay. Designed to boost return rates and lower injuries, it was a hit last season – and now it’s getting some tweaks for 2025. Going forward, touchbacks will bring the ball out to the 35-yard line instead of the 30. That makes kick returns a slightly riskier choice for returners. Also, teams trailing in a game can now call for an onside kick attempt at any time, not just in the fourth quarter. The league says these changes will keep the game more exciting without compromising player safety.The NFL is now using virtual measurement technology to determine first downs. The system, powered by Sony’s Hawk-Eye tech, is already used in sports like soccer and tennis, and now it's part of NFL Sundays too. Here’s how it works: referees still spot the ball as usual, but from there, the technology takes over to measure whether the offense reached the line to gain. That verdict comes in about 30 seconds — much quicker than bringing out the chains. The chains will still be used as a backup if needed, but most calls will now be made digitally. The goal is to boost accuracy while keeping games moving.Instant replay will also play a bigger role in 2025. The league expanded replay assist to help review five types of fouls that were previously off-limits:Replay can now be used to confirm or overturn calls in these cases — but not to throw a flag that wasn’t called in real time. That still has to come from the officials on the field.For fans, players and coaches alike, the 2025 season will be all about adapting to this new version of NFL football.","The nfl has tightened up its rulebook for the 2025 season and the impact is already being felt. From new restrictions on how players celebrate to major shifts in how first downs are measured and overtime is handled, the league is making clear it wants cleaner play and better accuracy.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123656521,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-61494,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

NFL insiders back Myles Garrett as top choice for 2025 Defensive Player of the Year

Myles Garrett’s contract extension, offseason controversy, and 2025 expectations

The Cleveland Browns didn’t come close to expectations last season, stumbling to a 3–14 finish in 2024. But while the team’s struggles defined the year, Myles Garrett’s dominance never wavered. The former No. 1 overall pick remained a constant force in the trenches, piling up sacks and tackles-for-loss despite facing relentless double teams. Yet the offseason was far from smooth for the Browns’ defensive cornerstone. Garrett requested a trade, spoke publicly about wanting to win elsewhere, and even skipped voluntary workouts. Now, heading into 2025, he’s back in Cleveland with a record-breaking contract and the spotlight firmly on him.Despite the turbulence, Myles Garrett remains the favorite to reclaim the Defensive Player of the Year award. In July, The Athletic’s Jeff Howe conducted a survey among league insiders, and Garrett’s reputation carried the day.“Garrett ran away with this category for the second consecutive year, even strengthening his perch after drawing 13 of 26 votes in 2024,” Howe wrote. “What’s more, the 2023 Defensive Player of the Year slipped to third in that voting last season, but he still stood out this summer in voters’ minds.”This time, Garrett earned 17 of 30 votes, a clear sign that, across the NFL, he’s still viewed as the league’s most unstoppable defender.The Browns made headlines of their own when they refused to trade Garrett, eventually finalizing a massive extension on March 9, 2025. The four-year, $160 million deal includes $123.5 million guaranteed, a $40 million annual salary, and a no-trade clause that ties him to Cleveland through 2030.Not everyone in Northeast Ohio welcomed the offseason drama. Some fans felt frustrated by Garrett’s trade request and his absence from voluntary workouts. Others pointed to another speeding ticket, suggesting he needs to win back trust. Still, his production has never been questioned — Garrett posted 14 sacks, 47 tackles, three forced fumbles, and a league-leading 22 tackles-for-loss in 2024.Myles Garrett enters the 2025 season as both the Browns’ defensive cornerstone and the NFL’s top favorite for Defensive Player of the Year. His dominance is unquestionable, his new contract guarantees stability, and league insiders continue to back him as the standard for elite pass rushing. But in Cleveland, the challenge isn’t just about sacks and awards — it’s about proving he’s still the leader this fan base can believe in.Also Read: CeeDee Lamb responds to doubters as the Dallas Cowboys face Micah Parsons and the Green Bay Packers in the 2025 season opener","Nfl insiders back myles garrett as top choice for 2025 defensive player of the year.

Aaron Glenn keeps Aaron Rodgers in the rearview as New York Jets look ahead

Aaron Glenn charts a new course for the New York Jets beyond Aaron Rodgers



With the NFL season set to kick off, the New York Jets are gearing up for a crucial first-week showdown against the Pittsburgh Steelers. With the NFL season opener fast approaching, the New York Jets are gearing up for an important first game against the Pittsburgh Steelers.What makes this meeting even more compelling is the man under center for Pittsburgh Aaron Rodgers , the New York Jets’ former quarterback and one of the league’s most decorated players. But New York Jets head coach Aaron Glenn isn’t interested in looking backward.Rather than feeding into the buzz surrounding Aaron Rodgers, Glenn is concentrating fully on the path forward.With a new quarterback leading the huddle and a new culture taking root, Aaron Glenn has made it clear: the future is now.Taking over as head coach during a transitional year, Aaron Glenn stepped into a job already clouded by storylines.A major talking point has been Aaron Rodgers ’ departure from the Jets, whose short stint with the team generated significant media buzz. As the Jets prepare to face Rodgers in their season opener, head coach Aaron Glenn is deliberately avoiding the hype surrounding Rodgers’ comeback. His approach is deliberate. With a full season ahead and many young players to develop, Aaron Glenn is redirecting attention to the roster he’s building. The message to the team is clear as this isn’t about one individual or one game, but about sustaining momentum across a long and demanding season.Aaron Rodgers, now leading the Pittsburgh Steelers, brings one of the most storied résumés in NFL history. Rodgers holds an impressive legacy as he won Super Bowl XLV and took home the MVP award for that game, earned the NFL MVP title four times, and was named First-Team All-Pro twice. Over his career, he’s thrown for over 42,500 passing yards, achieved a career passer rating of 103.1, and set the NFL record for the lowest interception percentage in a single season. His 4.23:1 touchdown-to-interception ratio remains the best in league history, a testament to his surgical precision and decision-making under pressure.Despite Aaron Rodgers’ impressive legacy, Glenn and the Jets are concentrating on the team’s current progress and future goals rather than dwelling on past successes.The organization is focusing on internal progress, especially at the quarterback position. Justin Fields, now at the helm, represents the direction Aaron Glenn is committed to youth, leadership, and accountability. The New York Jets are building around their current core, and that includes strong voices on defense and developing depth across the offensive line.Behind the scenes, the team has been emphasizing competition, unity, and staying grounded. There's no room for distractions as they try to reshape their identity. Facing Aaron Rodgers so early in the season could have sparked a media frenzy, but Aaron Glenn’s calm, controlled leadership has kept things in perspective. This isn’t a revenge game; it’s the first of many tests.The New York Jets are beginning a new chapter, and Aaron Glenn is setting the tone.By choosing not to highlight Rodgers’ return, Glenn is clearly signaling that the team’s main focus is on internal work and performance rather than outside noise. With a young quarterback taking charge and a full season of opportunity ahead, the spotlight is no longer on what was but what’s next. For Aaron Glenn, the goal is clearly to build a team that wins not just headlines, but games.Also Read: Swifties & NFL Fans Unite: How the Engagement Bridge Two Cultures","New york jets head coach aaron glenn is deliberately avoiding the hype surrounding aaron rodgers' return to the nfl.

Toronto Maple Leafs sign Dennis Hildeby to three-year extension,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/toronto-maple-leafs-sign-dennis-hilde-by-to-three-year-extension/articleshow/123661760.cms,"Photo by Julian Avram/Getty Images

Why Dennis Hildeby could be the Toronto Maple Leafs ’ next full-time NHL goaltender

What Dennis Hildeby’s contract means for the Toronto Maple Leafs’ goalie future

The Toronto Maple Leafs finalized an important piece of business on Tuesday in Toronto, announcing a three-year contract extension for goaltender Dennis Hildeby. The deal carries an average annual value of $841,667 and removes the final restricted free agent from general manager Brad Treliving’s offseason to-do list. With this signing complete, Treliving can now turn full attention to training camp, the pre-season schedule, and the possibility of professional tryouts.The contract is structured to support Hildeby’s ongoing development. For the 2025-26 and 2026-27 seasons, the deal is two-way, allowing the Maple Leafs flexibility in moving him between the NHL and AHL. Beginning in 2027-28, it shifts to a one-way format, a move that points toward the organization’s confidence in Hildeby as a potential NHL-calibre goaltender.Drafted in the fourth round of the 2022 NHL Draft, Dennis Hildeby has steadily built a résumé in North America. His NHL action came during the 2024-25 season, when injuries pushed him into six games with the Maple Leafs. He went 3-3-0 with a .872 save percentage and a 3.33 goals-against average. While the numbers reflected his adjustment to the league, the experience offered him a firsthand look at the demands of NHL competition.At the AHL level with the Toronto Marlies , Hildeby’s results have been more consistent. In 30 games during the 2024-25 season, he recorded a 16-9-4 record with a 2.55 goals-against average, a .908 save percentage, and two shutouts. Across his AHL career, he has appeared in 73 games, posting a 37-21-11 record with a 2.53 goals-against average, a .909 save percentage, and six shutouts.“Every time he’s been called upon, he’s handled himself with professionalism,” a team official noted in Toronto earlier this summer. That assessment underlines why the Maple Leafs continue to view him as a player who could grow into a regular NHL role.The structure of Hildeby’s new deal also aligns with upcoming roster decisions. Current backup Anthony Stolarz is scheduled to become an unrestricted free agent after the 2025-26 season. If the Maple Leafs choose to re-sign Stolarz for a short term, his contract would overlap with the point at which Hildeby’s deal converts to one-way status in 2027-28. That timing reflects how the organization is planning its depth chart in goal, keeping Hildeby in position to take on a larger role in the near future.For now, Hildeby remains the top option for call-ups when injuries strike, as seen last season. His continued performance in the AHL will dictate how quickly he moves up the depth chart.By securing Hildeby on Tuesday, the Maple Leafs ensured stability in their goaltending pipeline. The combination of a two-way start and a one-way finish to his contract signals a clear progression plan. If his numbers with the Marlies translate upward, Hildeby could be positioned to make the jump to a full-time NHL role by the time his deal enters its final year.Also Read: Quinn Hughes’ future in question while Vancouver Canucks takes another look at Vitali Kravtsov","Dennis hildeby signed a three-year contract extension with the toronto maple leafs on tuesday.

Deion Sanders’ advice for Travis Hunter as a new dad



Travis Hunter embraces fatherhood and NFL dreams



Travis Hunter is stepping into fatherhood and the NFL at the same time, and one man who has been by his side throughout this journey is Deion Sanders. The Hall of Famer, who once recruited Hunter to Jackson State and later coached him at Colorado, recently shared heartfelt fatherly advice for the Jacksonville Jaguars rookie as he embraces life’s two biggest milestones — becoming a professional athlete and a dad.For Sanders, Hunter has always been more than a player. Their bond goes back to 2021 when Hunter, then the No. 1 recruit in the nation, shocked everyone by committing to Jackson State instead of a powerhouse like Florida State. He later followed Sanders to Colorado, where he won the 2024 Heisman Trophy as a two-way sensation. Through it all, Sanders played a fatherly role, especially during Hunter’s toughest moments.On the night Hunter lifted the Heisman, his biological father was absent due to legal troubles. Sanders stepped in, embracing the young star in what became one of the most emotional moments of Hunter’s career. Years later, when Sanders was quietly battling a bladder cancer scare and couldn’t attend Hunter’s wedding, the rookie showed up at his coach’s Texas ranch, standing by him as the two shared quiet moments fishing together.“Oh my god, I’m taking a deep breath because I love him to life — I love him like he’s my son,” Sanders said. “It’s funny when your son is now a father… it’s a beautiful thing.“The thing that I told him is let’s correct all the things that we think we didn’t receive as children and let’s do that in our fatherhood. No matter what happens, let’s make sure we are the best darn father that ever walked. That’s what I told him. I’m proud of him, I love him to life, and I miss him dearly.”It wasn’t coach-speak. It was a father figure speaking to someone he considers family.Hunter, just 22, is now a husband and a father. He and his longtime girlfriend, Leanna Lenee, tied the knot earlier this year before welcoming their first child, a baby boy. In a heartfelt video titled “Dear Son…”, Hunter can be heard saying to his newborn, “Gotta be better than me.”The timing couldn’t be more symbolic. On September 7, Hunter will make his NFL debut when the Jaguars face the Carolina Panthers. It marks the start of two parallel journeys: one on the field as a top draft pick, and one at home as a father. With Sanders’ wisdom and his own determination, Hunter now carries two legacies — as a rising NFL star and as a dad committed to doing things right.Also Read: Justin Jefferson injury update: Vikings may take cautious approach as hamstring issue raises long-term concerns","Deion sanders gives travis hunter fatherhood guidance.

Justin Jefferson’s hamstring remains a long-term concern



Vikings’ star faces pressure to stay healthy all season



The Minnesota Vikings are preparing to have Justin Jefferson fully available for their season opener against the Chicago Bears on Monday night. Still, lingering concerns over the star wideout’s hamstring injury are shaping the team’s strategy. Jefferson strained his hamstring during the second practice of training camp, and while he has steadily increased his workload, insiders believe this will be a season-long storyline the Vikings must carefully manage.Jefferson’s return to action has been encouraging, but Minnesota insider Ben Goessling warned fans not to mistake his progress for complete recovery. Speaking on KFAN-FM 100.3, Goessling explained, “I think this is going to be a long-term maintenance thing. He’s had enough hamstring stuff at this point that I would not be surprised — he practices hard and he does not like to miss practices — I wonder if they will mitigate any of that. ”That statement highlights the delicate balance Minnesota faces: keeping its top receiver game-ready while preventing setbacks. The Vikings are expected to limit his workload in certain practices, with close monitoring throughout the season.Jefferson may frequently be seen stretching indoors or working in the sideline tents during open practice periods.History underscores why caution is necessary. Jefferson missed seven games in 2023 due to a right hamstring strain, his first extended absence since entering the league. The latest setback in July sidelined him for about three weeks, during which he avoided preseason and joint practices. His first true test comes at Soldier Field — a stadium with a notoriously fragile grass surface. With new sod only recently installed after multiple concerts, footing could pose an additional risk in Week 1.Jefferson’s impact on the Vikings is undeniable. His explosiveness and ability to stretch defenses make him the centerpiece of Kevin O’Connell’s offense. Yet the concern lingers: can Jefferson perform at full strength across a grueling 17-game season?Goessling reiterated that Jefferson’s hamstrings have now become a “consistent enough issue” that demand constant attention. This could mean fewer practice reps, strategic rest, and constant stretching routines. For a player who prides himself on hard work and rarely missing practices, such adjustments may not come easily.The Vikings know they cannot afford another prolonged absence from Jefferson. His health will directly influence Minnesota’s playoff hopes in a tightly contested NFC. For now, the team is optimistic he’ll be ready in Chicago. But the season-long question remains: can Justin Jefferson’s hamstring hold up when the Vikings need him most?Also Read: A billion-dollar love story: Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce's fairytale proposal comes with billion-dollar stakes","Minnesota vikings star wideout justin jefferson is expected to be ready for the team's season opener against the chicago bears on monday night.
