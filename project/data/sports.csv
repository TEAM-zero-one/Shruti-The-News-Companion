"""They leave way too much space"" Cam Ward just roasted Dallas Cowboys' defense, and the Tennessee Titans are all in",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/they-leave-way-too-much-space-cam-ward-just-roasted-dallas-cowboys-defense-and-the-tennessee-titans-are-all-in/articleshow/119490339.cms,"(Image via Getty)

Cam Ward’s shots fired at Dallas Cowboys might kickstart an NFL rivalry before draft day

""Some teams in the NFL did a lot of two-high stuff, like Dallas, called a lot of Tampa, a lot of cover-two. They leave way too much space on the sideline down the seams.""

""I just think the arm strength and the confidence that I'm bringing, along with me getting my receivers better, I just think I'll be able to put the ball where I want.""

Tennessee Titans locked on Cam Ward as top pick, already planning future beyond Will Levis

""General consensus seems to be that the Titans, who recently had dinner with Ward, will take him No. 1 overall.""

""There's virtually no doubt the Titans are taking Cam Ward.""

Cam Ward hasn’t taken an NFL snap, but he's already running the show

""I've been dreaming about this since I was a kid. Whether it's NFL, MLB or NBA, I wanted to go pro in something. That's always been my destiny.""

""I got hands,""

""I'm interchangeable.""

Cam Ward isn't even in the NFL yet, but he's already throwing shade like a seasoned vet. The Miami quarterback confidently tore into NFL coverages, specifically calling out the Dallas Cowboys after his pro day. With Tennessee Titans locked in on him for the No. 1 pick, Ward isn't just talking the talk—he’s flexing some serious confidence.Ward sat down with CBS Sports after his pro day, and when asked about stepping up to NFL defenses, he casually threw shade directly at Dallas:That’s not your average pre-draft banter. Ward just casually dissected one of the league’s high-profile defenses, pointing out exactly where they mess up. The Cowboys might have to rethink their coverage, or at least circle Ward’s name for revenge when the rookie finally hits the field.Ward's confidence doesn't stop there—he fully believes he'll put the ball exactly where he wants at the pro level. As he put it himself:With talk like this, Ward isn’t waiting for Week 1—he’s already playing mind games.Multiple NFL insiders are convinced the Tennessee Titans have zero doubt about drafting Cam Ward No. 1 overall. Cleveland Browns insider Mary Kay Cabot made it clear:NFL reporter Gary Myers also echoed this, citing league sources:Even ESPN Cleveland’s Tony Grossi confirms the Titans have no intention of trading away the top pick. They're completely sold on Ward’s talent, confidence, and NFL-readiness.The Titans’ love for Ward also means Tennessee is fully prepared to move on from quarterback Will Levis, their second-round pick from 2023. NFL insider Josina Anderson confirmed Tennessee wants to transition away from Levis this offseason. Ward isn't even officially drafted yet, but he's already forcing Tennessee to shuffle the deck at quarterback.Former NFL GM Mike Tannenbaum thinks this makes perfect sense, calling Ward to the Titans ""an easy decision."" He also has Colorado quarterback Shedeur Sanders penciled in at No. 2 or 3, likely to the Browns or New York Giants. Sanders might be next-best, but right now, Ward owns the spotlight.Ward’s pre-NFL confidence and his Cowboys jab have everyone talking. The Titans clearly believe he's their franchise quarterback. Ward himself sees this as inevitable, telling former Titans GM Ran Carthon:He’s got the swagger, the arm, and apparently, the hands too—jokingly flexing about a trick-play reception during pro day:Ward said.Seattle Seahawks safety Quandre Diggs, Ward's cousin, even expressed openly that he wants to team up with him after draft day. Clearly, Ward isn't just another rookie prospect—he's already changing team plans, rivalries, and narratives before he even steps on an NFL field.","Cam ward threw shade at the dallas cowboys after his pro day.

Officials break up goalie fight as Jeremy Swayman confronts Dracy Kuemper

The Boston Bruins ’ struggles continued with a 7-1 loss to the Angeles Kings, extending their losing streak to six games. A heated moment saw Jeremy Swayman challenge Darcy Kuemper to a goalie fight , but officials intervened. Defenseman Nikita Zadorov didn’t mince words, calling the team’s performance “embarrassing.”During the second period, Bruins forward Marat Khusnutdinov got into an altercation with Kings goalie Darcy Kuemper. Kuemper responded by jabbing Khusnutdinov with his blocker before putting him in a headlock. This sparked a reaction from Bruins goalie Jeremy Swayman, who, after allowing seven goals and posting a .696 save percentage, skated to the red line to challenge Dracy Kuemper to a fight.Kuemper accepted the challenge, and Swayman took off his gloves and mask, ready to fight. However, the officials quickly intervened, preventing the two goalies from going at it.After the game, The Athletic’s Fluto Shinzawa asked Bruins defenseman Nikita Zadorov—a veteran known for his physical play—about his thoughts on Swayman stepping up. Instead of praising his goalie’s actions, Zadorov dismissed the idea, making it clear he didn’t see it the same way.“Is that what it is?” Zadorov said. “Looked like it,” Shinzawa replied. “OK,” Zadorov said. “I don’t know. No comment.” Zadorov didn't hold back his thoughts on the goaltending either. “Everything goes in,” Zadorov said. “It’s embarrassing, obviously. How many times we get beat by these teams scoring six goals, seven goals on us this year? It’s definitely unacceptable. It’s not what we’re looking for. Not much to say after this one, for sure.”Sunday’s game was another tough outing for Jeremy Swayman, marking his fourth straight start without a save percentage above .900.At the time of his challenge to Kuemper, the Bruins were down 3-2. The Kings had just taken the lead after Drew Doughty capitalized on a rebound Swayman couldn’t control. Los Angeles then extended their lead with a late second-period goal before dominating the third, scoring three more times to seal the blowout.Also Read: Jakob Chychrun injury update: Capitals fans express concern as the star player suffered a scary wrist injury Toronto hopes Laughton can turn things around as they face his former team, the Flyers, on Tuesday at Scotiabank Arena.

Has Wayne Gretzky forgotten his Canadian roots? A national icon’s choices leave fans questioning his allegiance,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/has-wayne-gretzky-forgotten-his-canadian-roots-a-national-icons-choices-leave-fans-questioning-his-allegiance/articleshow/119305633.cms,"Image via Getty Images

A missed opportunity at the 4 Nations Face-Off



Does Gretzky still consider Canada home?

Few athletes in the history of sports have been as popular in Canada as Wayne Gretzky . From his early days as a child prodigy in Brantford to being the heart and soul of the Edmonton Oilers dynasty, his path has been one of unprecedented achievement. For decades, he was not just a hockey player—he was a national symbol. But recent developments have left many Canadians asking: has Gretzky moved away from the nation that raised him?The controversy flared again when Wayne Gretzky showed up as Canada's honorary captain during the 4 Nations Face-Off Final. Rather than wearing a red-and-white jersey to symbolize the nation that turned him into a legend, he showed up in a blue suit. More importantly, he took to the ice close to the U.S. bench and gave a thumbs-up to the American players. The symbolic faux pas left many Canadians feeling snubbed. As one sports writer wrote, he was unable to ""read the room.""This is not the first time Wayne Gretzky's Canadian connections have been called into question. His public endorsement of former U.S. President Donald Trump , including trips to Mar-a-Lago, has also raised questions. While personal politics are a private affair, aligning with a divisive figure often has public repercussions. But, as many fans admit, political decisions don't always determine national identity.What hurts more for Canadians is the feeling that Wayne Gretzky has moved away from the nation that raised him. He departed for Los Angeles in 1988, a deal that made him cry and broke the heart of Edmonton. But even then, Canada still owned him. Now, though, instances like the 4 Nations final present a different tale—one in which Gretzky seems more suited to his life in America than his Canadian heritage.Also Read: Wayne Gretzky's daughter Emma Gretzky celebrates boyfriend Stone Eby’s 22nd birthday with heartfelt tribute All it would have required was a little gesture—a red-and-white jersey, a wink at the nation that built him The Great One. But instead, Wayne Gretzky's decision left Canadians asking themselves whether their greatest hockey idol still sees them as his own.","Wayne gretzky showed up as canada's honorary captain during the 4 nations face-off final.

Rhea Ripley has a WWE title opportunity before WrestleMania 41

Rhea Ripley has one last chance to make it to WrestleMania 41 following the events that went down on this week's edition of WWE RAW.Rhea Ripley was riding the wave of success and was set to compete in her third straight title match at WrestleMania this year. However, it was IYO Sky who dethroned her for the WWE Women's World title before that and got her slot. But Mami was not going to let the road to WrestleMania walk past her, and now she has one last chance to earn her place at The Show of Shows this year.Last week on RAW, Rhea Ripley interrupted the contract signing between IYO Sky and Bianca Belair for their title match at WrestleMania 41. She took out both competitors and signed her name on the contract, creating confusion in the process. However, RAW GM Adam Pearce came out on this week's edition of the show that took place at the OVO Hydro in Glasgow, Scotland.Pearce clarified the situation by saying that Rhea Ripley was not a part of the match despite signing the contract. This led to IYO Sky coming out to the ring first and making it clear it did not matter who she faced. Bianca Belair came out next and claimed that she earned her one-on-one match for the title by winning the Elimination Chamber match. Rhea Ripley joined last and shouted that she only cared about having her rematch.The situation began to boil up, much like every trio confrontation in the last few weeks, and Adam Pearce made his decision. Next week on RAW, IYO Sky will defend her WWE Women's World title against Rhea Ripley, with the winner facing Bianca Belair at WrestleMania 41.The announcement led to an all-out brawl between the trio as tensions continued to build up on the road to WrestleMania. Later in the night, Adam Pearce added another twist to the title match next week.

Dodgers doctor revealed reason for Mookie Betts' Tokyo Series exit

Mookie Betts has been struggling with bad health, which also led him to miss out on being a part of the Los Angeles Dodgers roster for the Tokyo Series. Even though the Dodgers won the series, fans definitely missed watching Betts show his magic on the field.On Sunday, Mookie Betts was interviewed by reporters in Los Angeles to talk about his health status. Betts hinted at a positive health status, claiming that his ""body feels great"" compared to how it was feeling last week. Talking about the improvements he has noticed, Betts said:""I mean, I feel great. Like, my body feels great. I've been able to work out. I've been able to do pretty much everything but eat, which is strange. So the symptoms have kind of gone away, I just have to figure out how to get my stomach to kind of calm down.""Moving forward in the interview, Mookie Betts also talked about his struggles with eating and the approach he plans on taking with his play after returning to the lineup. Opening up about his comeback plans, Betts explained:""It's just hard to fathom not eating and going to play a game. So it looks like I'm just going to be light for a little bit. Maybe I play uphill a little bit at the beginning of the season. But no, I just want to play, man. I'm tired of sitting, tired of throwing up, tired of doing all this. I really just want to play.""The LA Times interviewed Dodgers doctor Heal ElAttrache recently, during which he talked about the real reason behind Mookie Betts and Freddie Freeman's exit from the Tokyo Series. Sharing details into the exact reason, ElAttrache said:""Dehydration is one of the worst conditions you can have for muscle strains. You have Mookie come out here, tear an oblique or hamstring; you can lose him for six weeks. This time of the year is the worst time to take a chance. If you're wrong and too aggressive with it … they lose six or eight weeks.""Before talking about his injury, Mookie Betts made headlines when he reflected back on his time with the Boston Red Sox and compared it with that of the Los Angeles Dodgers.","Mookie betts has been struggling with bad health, which also led him to miss out on being a part of the los angeles dodgers roster for the tokyo series.

Is 'Heat Culture' really the key to winning? Jimmy Butler isn't convinced



The Athletic

Jimmy Butler has never been one to hold back, and his latest take on the Miami Heat ’s famed "" Heat Culture "" is no exception. After spending over five seasons with the franchise, Butler was traded to the Golden State Warriors in a major deal on February 5. Since then, he’s been thriving, helping the Warriors go on a 16-4 run and climb to the sixth seed in the Western Conference. However, in a sit-down with The Athletic ’s Anthony Slater, Butler didn’t hesitate to question just how much ""Heat Culture"" actually factors into Miami’s success.For years, ""Heat Culture"" has been Miami Heat ’s signature, built on toughness, discipline, and a relentless drive to win. The franchise pushes it hard, and the fans take pride in it. But Jimmy Butler , who helped lead the Heat to the NBA Finals in 2020 and 2023, isn’t convinced it’s the magic formula people make it out to be. To him, it’s less about a defined culture and more about having the right guys who buy into winning.“There was some foundation to it in the sense of the work and all that stuff, which is great,” Butler told. “I’m not saying it in a bad way, but I think it’s a little bit, like, overused talking about the ‘Heat Culture.’ It is a great organization. But I think a large part of that culture is you get guys that buy into a (winning mindset).”Butler sees it pretty simply—the Heat, or any team for that matter, win because of the talent they have and the players’ commitment to a common goal. Miami has built an identity around toughness and grit, but in his eyes, that’s not what makes or breaks a team. Winning comes down to having the right guys who buy in, not just a catchy mantra.“You get some guys that buy in, you get some really good players and you get the opportunity to talk about ‘Heat Culture’ a little bit more,” Butler explained. “I’m not saying it to talk down or anything, but I think whenever you have really good players you can name it whatever you want to name it.”Jimmy Butler's Golden State Warriors success shows winning is about talent, not 'Heat Culture'Butler’s departure from Miami wasn’t entirely smooth. Before his trade to the Warriors, he was indefinitely suspended by the Heat due to internal friction with the franchise. While he hasn’t spoken much about the specifics of his exit, his comments suggest he sees team success as more about player commitment than a branded culture.Since arriving in Golden State, Butler has seamlessly fit into the Warriors' system, helping the team turn their season around. The Warriors’ resurgence further supports his point—teams with elite players and the right mentality will find ways to win, regardless of the slogans attached to them.Butler’s take challenges the traditional narrative surrounding team culture in the NBA. Much like the New England Patriots’ famed “Patriot Way” in the NFL, the Heat’s culture has been celebrated as a defining characteristic. However, Butler argues that while having a guiding principle is beneficial, it’s not the secret ingredient to success.Also Read: Jimmy Butler on Draymond Green’s Defensive Masterclass Against Milwaukee Bucks: ‘You Gotta Respect the Hell Out of That’ At the end of the day, Butler believes that culture is what you make of it—and having the right players matters more than the words used to define a franchise. Now, in Golden State, he’s proving that winning isn’t about the name of the culture, but about the talent and mindset of the players who embrace it.","Jimmy butler was traded from the miami heat to the golden state warriors on february 5. In a sit-down with the athletic's anthony slater, butler questioned the value of 'heat culture' he believes winning comes down to having the right players who buy in, not just a slogan.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119481741,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-401967,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

The Punjab Kings will begin their IPL 2025 season against the Gujarat Titans today, with Shreyas Iyer making his debut as captain.After 18 years without a title, the franchise is counting on Iyer’s leadership to turn their fortunes around. Having led Kolkata Knight Riders to IPL title last season and Delhi Capitals to the final in 2020, Iyer is seen as the ideal choice to revitalise the team.Punjab Kings have struggled in recent seasons, failing to reach the top five in the last four editions. Their best IPL result came in 2014, when they were runners-up, and in 2018, when they reached the semifinals.Iyer’s appointment as captain represents a new strategy, further strengthened by his reunion with coach Ricky Ponting, with whom he has enjoyed success in the past.Both captains - Iyer and Shubman Gill - come into this match in great form, following their performances in India's recent Champions Trophy win in Dubai. Iyer led in run-scoring with 243 runs in five matches, while Gujarat Titans' skipper Gill impressed with a century against Bangladesh.The Gujarat Titans, who won the IPL title in 2022 and were runners-up in 2023, faced challenges last season under Gill's captaincy, finishing eighth.Aiming for a strong comeback, the Titans have built a formidable squad, featuring Gill and Jos Buttler as openers, along with a solid middle order including Sherfane Rutherford, Sai Sudharsan, and Masood Shahrukh Khan. The all-round capabilities of Rashid Khan, Rahul Tewatia, Glenn Phillips, Washington Sundar, and Mahipal Lomror enhance their depth and potential.Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad has hosted 25 IPL matches in its history with the side batting second winning 15 of them. If that stat alone were a reflection, the winning captain at the toss should choose to field first.With Gill suggesting a 240-260 run total in the pre-match press conference, expect one more run-fest this season.In the last match played at this venue, Rajasthan Royals beat the Royal Challengers Bengaluru. Batting first, RCB scored 172 and RR chased that down courtesy Yashasvi Jaiswal's rapid 45 runs. The highest total at this venue is 233, scored by Gujarat Titans.Shubman Gill (C), Jos Buttler, Sai Sudarshan, Shahrukh Khan, Glenn Philips, Washington Sundar, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, Kagiso Rabada, Mohammed Siraj.GT Impact Subs: Ishant Sharma/Mahipal LomrorShreyas Iyer, Prabhsimran Singh, Priyansh Arya, Marcus Stoinis, Glenn Maxwell , Shashank Singh, Nehal Wadhera/Suryansh Shedge, Marco Jansen, Harpreet Brar, Lockie Ferguson, Arshdeep SinghPBKS Impact Subs: Yuzvendra Chahal/Vishnu Vinod.Gujarat Giants: Shubman Gill (c), Anuj Rawat, Jos Buttler, Kumar Kushagra, Sherfane Rutherford, Sai Sudharsan, M Shahrukh Khan, Rashid Khan, Karim Janat, Mahipal Lomror, Glenn Phillips, Nishant Sindhu, Manav Suthar, Rahul Tewatia, Washington Sundar, Arshad Khan, Gerald Coetzee, Gurnoor Brar, Kulwant Khejroliya, Mohammed Siraj, Prasidh Krishna, Kagiso Rabada, Sai Kishore, Ishant Sharma, Jayant Yadav.Punjab Kings: Shreyas Iyer (c), Priyansh Arya, Pyla Avinash, Harnoor Singh, Josh Inglis, Prabhsimran Singh, Vishnu Vinod, Nehal Wadhera, Azmatullah Omarzai, Aaron Hardie, Marco Jansen, Glenn Maxwell, Musheer Khan, Shashank Singh, Marcus Stoinis, Suryansh Shedge, Arshdeep Singh, Xavier Bartlett, Yuzvendra Chahal, Praveen Dubey, Lockie Ferguson, Harpreet Brar, Kuldeep Sen, Vijaykumar Vyshak, Yash Thakur.Gujarat, who ventured into the IPL in 2022, have met Punjab only five times in IPL history. Out of these five games, Gujarat have won three whereas Punjab have come out victorious on the other two occasion.Expect lots of sweaty faces and tired bodies by the end of it with Ahmedabad already in the thick of the heat. The 40 degree Celsius weather prediction, as per Accuweather, in the day will receed by evening but only to 32-33 degrees as the match progresses. There is absolutely no chance of rain.","Punjab kings have struggled in recent seasons, failing to reach the top five in the last four editions.

EXCLUSIVE | Shreyas Iyer and Yuzvendra Chahal key to Punjab Kings' hunt for maiden IPL title: Shashank Singh

'It was for all the supporters': Ishan Kishan on animated celebration after scoring hundred

NEW DELHI: Shreyas Iyer may have missed out on a well-deserved century, but his innings was met with admiration and applause from all corners. He remained unbeaten on 97 as he walked back, yet the smile on his face made it clear — his focus was on contributing to his new team, Punjab Kings , who have been chasing their maiden IPL title since the tournament began in 2008.At the end of the 19th over, Iyer stood at 97*, with Shashank Singh at the other end on 22 off 10 balls.Putting the team’s needs ahead of personal milestones, Iyer prioritised Punjab Kings' total over individual glory.Before the start of the final over, Iyer walked up to Shashank, who was striking the ball cleanly, and told him not to worry about his century but instead focus on maximising runs for the team.Shashank responded to his captain’s trust by smashing five boundaries off Mohammed Siraj ’s over, propelling Punjab Kings to an imposing 243/5 in 20 overs.After the innings, when asked about denying Iyer a century, Shashank said:""Yes, it was a good cameo. But looking at Shreyas, that motivated me even more. Let me be very honest — Shreyas, from ball one, said don’t worry about my hundred! Just watching the ball and reacting to it.""""I try and make sure I get the boundaries. When you bat at that number, it's likely that you won’t always get a good hit. I know the shots I can back. I focus on my strengths rather than things I can't do,"" he added.","Shreyas iyer missed out on a well-deserved century. Iyer prioritised punjab kings' total over individual glory.

According to a statement from the basketball program, Watkins ""will undergo surgery and then begin rehabilitation shortly thereafter.""While driving to the basket on a fast break between two defenders, Watkins was fouled, causing her right knee to buckle as she planted her leg.
