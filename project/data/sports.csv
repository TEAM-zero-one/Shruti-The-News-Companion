T20 World Cup | 'Our flight is booked and we are going' - Suryakumar Yadav on Pakistan's boycott

The impasse over the India-Pakistan T20 WC match showed no signs of being resolved, after Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif weighed in on the issue, calling their boycott of the February 15 match against India in Colombo an “appropriate decision”. It was a “considered stance” to support Bangladesh, he said.“We have taken a very clear stand on the T20 World Cup that we won’t play the match against India because there should be no politics on the sports field. We have taken a very considered stance, and we should completely stand by Bangladesh, and I think this is a very appropriate decision. We are with Bangladesh,” the PM said.Meanwhile, Bangladesh Youth and Sports Advisor Asif Nazrul acknowledged Sharif’s decision. “Thank you, Pakistan,” Nazrul wrote in a social media post.As the start of this contentious World Cup nears, speaking at a pre-tournament captain’s press conferences from two different locations – Mumbai’s BCCI headquarters and from Colombo — both teams’ captains broke their silence on the issue.“We haven’t refused to play against Pakistan. They have refused. The mindset is pretty clear. We have not said no, it has come from them,” India skipper Suryakumar Yadav said.“The ICC has given a fixture, BCCI and the (Indian) govt has decided with the ICC on playing at a neutral venue. Our flight is booked for Colombo and we are going,” he added.Salman Ali Agha, his Pakistani opposite number, said, “The India game is not in our control. It’s the govt’s and PCB’s decision and we respect that. Whatever they are going to say, we will do that.”“If we have to play them again in the semifinal or final, we will have to go back to them (govt) and act on their advice,” added the Pakistan skipper. The Indian captain acknowledged that the situation is “not easy” for those involved in the issue, including the ICC.“I feel it is not an easy job. It is not my call. I am sure they (the ICC) might be working out something as well but it has come from the other govt or the nation, how can they (the ICC) help as well? Their (Pakistan’s) decision is not in my control. I wish I could take their decisions, but then it is their call,” said Suryakumar.“We have been told that we have to play a game in Colombo on Feb 15th. We played them three times in the Asia Cup, we played some good cricket. We won (all the matches) and we were very happy. Similarly, if we get an opportunity in Colombo, we will definitely play,” he added.Earlier, Inter national Cricket Council (ICC) had expressed serious concerns over the Pakistan govt’s decision.“This position of selective participation is difficult to reconcile with the fundamental premise of a global sporting event where all qualified teams are expected to compete on equal terms per the event schedule,” it had said. “This decision is not in the interest of the global game or the welfare of fans worldwide.”",Pakistan pm shehbaz sharif calls their boycott of the february 15 match against india in colombo an “appropriate decision” bangladesh youth and sports advisor asif nazrul acknowledged sharif’s decision.

Draymond Green’s Hazel Renee reacts to Savannah James' latest look



Savannah James’ public appearances often grab headlines. While the Los Angeles Lakers handled business on the road, Savannah captured the attention inside Brooklyn’s Barclays Center, where she appeared in a stunning furry outfit.The entrepreneur and philanthropist joined LeBron James and their son Bronny during the Lakers’ East Coast trip, supporting both from the stands. Savannah’s winter look became a talking point following her courtside appearance. Of course, Savannah is known for her fashion statements in her public appearances.

A neutral-toned fuzzy beanie tied the winter aesthetic together.She later shared the look on Instagram, captioning the post, “FUREVER THAT GIRL...😮‍💨❄️ @mrs_savannahrj dropped in & raised the temp in the city with this relaxed flex wearing a custom @elwoodclothing jogging suit | @danielsleather fur | @hermes himalayan croc | @paristexas_it boots (SWIPE) 🌡️🥵.”Savannah revealed the outfit after the Lakers’ 125-109 win over the Nets, a night that also featured a viral courtside moment when LeBron leaned over to share a kiss with her during the game.The post quickly drew attention across the NBA community. Hazel Renee, wife of Golden State Warriors forward Draymond Green, reacted in the comments with clear admiration, writing, “THE SLLOOOOWWW MOOOOOO WHEW 😮‍💨.”Savannah’s courtside presence has become a familiar sight throughout LeBron’s career, from playoff battles to Olympic celebrations. During last summer’s Paris Games, she was in the stands as Team USA captured gold, later celebrating with LeBron after the final buzzer. Her support continues during the current NBA season amid LeBron’s retirement buzz.The Lakers are making a statement as they attempt to climb the ladder in the Western Conference. They are currently in the 6th position with 31 wins and 19 defeats after battling the Philadelphia 76ers on Thursday.","Savannah james donned a floor-length fox fur piece.

Swiss roots and the passion for watches

Journey from a collector to the Swiss mogul

Roman Josi is known as the calm, cool captain of the Nashville Predators, well known for his consistency, leadership, and defensive play. Along with his way to become the finest captain in Nashville Predators’ history, Josi has built his reputation with his perfect timing, proper gameplay under pressure and smart decision-making as aleader.Besides his career as a sportsman, Roman Josi is also passionate about something totally different from his niche, which is watchmaking or collecting luxury watches. Though he is not a businessman, seeing his enthusiasm towards collecting watches, his fans named him ‘a Swiss watch mogul’.Switzerland is a place where watches are not just another accessory; they symbolise the country's rich cultural heritage. Swiss watchmaking is something more than a hobby, it is linked with precision, patience, and long-term thinking capacity about something. Born and brought up in Switzerland, Josi is already the root of watchmaking in his veins, adding to it his professional career as a hockey player. Josi is one of the seven men who hold shares of NORQAIN, an independent Swiss watchmaking brand.He became a significant investor in the company in 2018, from the initial phase of the brand. Founded by Ben Küffer of the Küffer family, a family with more than 40 years of experience in watchmaking, NORQAIN provides a wide range of luxury watches.Josi’s vast collection also includes some pieces from NORQAIN.He owns NORQAIN Wild ONE Skeleton in grey colour (high performing sports watch), NORQAIN Wild ONE NHLPA Limited Edition (a specialised timepiece, limited edition ), Freedom 60 Chrono (vintage styles blending classic design with sporty details). These are some of the significant watches in Josi's NORQAIN collection.Over time, the Roman Josi has been seen wearing his classic pieces, which reflect his choice of elegance over trends. Josi mostly leans towards brands with heritage, which offer classic designs, clean dials, and elegant looks. This shows his love for the craftsmanship of watchmaking and reflects his personality as a confident individual. As his career in the NHL grew, so did his collection of watches. Every piece he wears in different events is praiseworthy, be it a formal event or a family holiday; he has his watches for all occasions. The watches work as a symbol for all the milestones he achieved in his career and in his life.The passion for collecting sophisticated watch pieces is what makes Josi stand out from others. In a world where sportsmen are intent on being trendy, which eventually helps them grow through brand endorsements, Josi chose his fascination with watches, which is rare. Over the years, the way he showcases those graceful timepieces on his wrist has overwhelmed fans, who also become curious about watchmaking.The phrase Swiss watch mogul, is not just any other nickname he gets because of his game; rather, it implies his subtle, disciplined, and decent way to support a craft, a heritage with a rich history of his own country, without being loud. Josi doesn't have a brand, but he represents how classic pieces never lost their charm, and everyone should carry forward these antiquities; in this way, he became an unofficial brand ambassador of Swiss watch culture.","Roman josi is the captain of the nashville predators hockey team.

"No Chiefs, No Taylor Swift: Is Super Bowl LX About To Expose the NFL’s Ratings Myth?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/no-chiefs-no-taylor-swift-is-super-bowl-lx-about-to-expose-the-nfls-ratings-myth/articleshow/127991305.cms,"NBC chases another Super Bowl ratings high without the Chiefs or Taylor Swift, leaning on Bad Bunny, Peacock, and record ad money.

Why Super Bowl LX May Fall Short of Another Ratings Record

NBC Is Chasing a Different Kind of Win With Ads, Streaming, and Bad Bunny

Super Bowl LX hits NBC on Feb. 8 with no Kansas City Chiefs and no Taylor Swift in sight. The NFL is chasing a fourth straight ratings record after last year’s Eagles-Chiefs matchup averaged 127.7 million viewers, fueled by Travis Kelce and Swift’s weekly storyline.This time the New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks return to the big stage at Levi’s Stadium, with Bad Bunny at halftime and Peacock and Telemundo carrying the stream. It is still TV’s biggest night, but also a clean test of how much the league ever needed its most famous couple.Analysts cited by the Los Angeles Times say “record-setting seems unlikely,” noting that the Chiefs and Swift brought in casual fans who may not rush back for Patriots-Seahawks, Part II. Nielsen now counts out-of-home viewing and millions of connected TVs, and the audience is younger and more female. The structural boost is real, even if the sugar rush has cooled.Without the Chiefs’ built-in drama or Swift dropping viral moments from a suite, Sunday’s number will finally separate what came from new measurement and what came from celebrity.Even if the audience lands below 127.7 million, NBC is already winning where it matters.The network sold out Super Bowl LX ad inventory months ago at roughly $8 million per 30-second slot, with some hitting $10 million, plus separate Peacock-only buys bundled with this month’s Winter Olympics. If that package delivers record Super Bowl ad revenue while driving more people into Peacock and Telemundo, nobody will panic over a softer rating headline.The NFL has stood by Bad Bunny despite conservative backlash and a Turning Point USA “counter-show” with Kid Rock and country acts streaming elsewhere. Executives still remember the only counter-programming that really worked, Fox’s live “In Living Color” episode in 1992 that pushed them toward booking global stars.If NBC comes anywhere near last year’s viewership while cashing a bigger ad check, the night will still feel like a win in the rooms that matter. Super Bowl LX may not break the record, but it will show whether the NFL’s ratings machine runs on one superstar couple or on something bigger.","Nbc chases another super bowl ratings high without the chiefs or taylor swift, leaning on bad bunny, peacock, and record ad money.

Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs face more offseason change as the team may lose another trusted coach,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/patrick-mahomes-and-the-chiefs-face-more-offseason-change-as-the-team-may-lose-another-trusted-coach/articleshow/127993800.cms,"Patrick Mahomes and Dan Williams (via Imagn Images and Getty Images)

Dan Williams could be the next departure as Arizona targets the Chiefs’ quarterback staff

The Kansas City Chiefs are heading into a strange offseason, one that feels unfamiliar after years of stability. A 6-11 record and six straight losses to end the 2025 season knocked Kansas City out of the playoffs for the first time since 2014. Patrick Mahomes suffered a torn ACL midway through the month, ending his season early and putting his 2026 availability under real scrutiny.While some developments have happened, including the return of Eric Bieniemy as the OC, another vital member of the Chiefs may change outfits, as the Arizona Cardinals reportedly requested permission to interview Dan Williams for their open quarterbacks coach position. With Williams’ rich history with the Chiefs and the vulnerable position that the team is in currently, it will be a great loss if Williams takes up the gig.Popular NFL reporter Cameron Wolfe wrote on X, ""Arizona Cardinals have requested to interview Dan Williams for their QB coach position, per source. Williams is in Year 7 with Chiefs, the last 3 as assistant QB coach. A young rising coach and key figure for Patrick Mahomes with a chance for elevation.""Several members of Andy Reid’s staff left for new opportunities, breaking up a group that had been together through multiple deep playoff runs.The biggest move was offensive coordinator Matt Nagy leaving to take a job with the New York Giants. Regarding the latest news about Williams, it gets quite complicated if he makes the move.Williams has been with the Chiefs since 2019, starting as a coaching intern before steadily earning more responsibility. He later served as an assistant to the head coach, a role that put him close to Reid and the team’s inner workings. In 2023, Williams was promoted to assistant quarterbacks coach under quarterbacks coach David Girardi.If Williams leaves, it would be another hit to a Chiefs team that is already trying to rebuild confidence and consistency. Kansas City finished 30th in points per game and struggled to maintain rhythm once injuries piled up and execution slipped. The Chiefs were 6-5 late in the season and still alive in the playoff race before everything fell apart.","Arizona cardinals reportedly want to interview kansas city chiefs' dan williams.

Kenneth Walker and rushing attack

Protect the football and rely on defense

Sam Darnold avoids interceptions and fumbles

Seattle Seahawks’ defense against Matthew Stafford

Seattle Seahawks star quarterback Sam Darnold said at a recent press conference that staying at the team hotel feels like training camp. He enjoys spending time with his teammates, eating snacks together, and moving in and out of the practice facility and locker room. In short, the signal caller is keeping himself relaxed and rejuvenated before Sunday’s final showdown against the New England Patriots.However, the Good Morning Football [GMFB] crew, Kyle Brandt, Jamie Erdahl, Manti Te’o, Seth Rollins , and Willie Colon, are analyzing whether the Seahawks will win Super Bowl 60 and offering valuable insights. With one of them saying, they expect a mistake-free performance from Darnold.Super Bowl XLIII champion Willie Colon says Seattle can win the Big Game if it runs the ball.Kenneth Walker and his rushing attack led the league in attempts. New England’s head coach, Mike Vrabel, has been saying that if they can’t stop the run game, they’re in trouble. The Seahawks’ running back accumulated 221 rushing attempts for 1,027 rushing yards and five rushing touchdowns in the 2025 season.Former Chicago Bears linebacker Manti Te’o thinks the Patriots are not given enough credit for stopping the run.Christian Barmore [Patriots’ defensive tackle] and company will make it tough to run against them. The Seahawks will win if they avoid turnovers and protect the ball. Seattle’s strength is its defense, so rely on it.WWE superstar Seth Rollins says Atlanta Falcons running back Bijan Robinson is the truth. Robinson shares that he couldn’t get through the interior line in New England [In Nov. 2025 game, the RB accumulated just 12 carries for 46 yards against the Patriots].Rollins hopes Kenneth Walker can keep going but thinks it will all come down to Sam Darnold throwing the ball.The quarterback throws down the field, uses weapons like [veteran wide receiver] Cooper Kupp. The Seahawks can win if they avoid mistakes. If Darnold doesn’t throw an interception, fumble, or hold onto the football for long, they can win the Super Bowl game.GMFB host Kyle Brandt says if Darnold throws a couple of picks, the Seahawks will likely lose. If Darnold plays a clean game, Brandt doesn’t think this Patriots team can beat him.The Seahawks will win unless Matthew Stafford starts for the Patriots [everyone laughs]. Brandt doesn’t think that will happen because Stafford said last night at the NFL Honors 2026 that he’s coming back for the 2026 season.When the Seahawks defense faced Stafford, they got nothing. They’re not very good against him, but against everyone else, they’re incredible.","Seattle seahawks star quarterback sam darnold said at a recent press conference that staying at the team hotel feels like training camp.

What happened to Sam Darnold?

What this means for the Seahawks

As the Super Bowl LX approaches, all eyes are on the health of the Seattle Seahawks’ quarterback Sam Darnold. Seattle’s veteran signal-caller has been managing an oblique injury in recent weeks, but the latest updates are encouraging for Seahawks fans hoping to see him start in Sunday’s championship game against the New England Patriots.Darnold suffered the oblique injury on January 15, shortly before the divisional playoffs began. Despite the setback, he played through the pain in two crucial postseason victories and a dominant win over the San Francisco 49ers and a clutch performance against the Los Angeles Rams in the NFC Championship Game.Throughout Super Bowl week, his status was closely monitored. After practicing in a limited role for much of the week, he finally logged a full practice on Thursday. This was the first time since the injury that he took every rep without restriction, a milestone that strongly suggests he will be ready for Sunday’s game.HC Mike Macdonald has also provided an optimistic update, indicating that Darnold appears to be on track and “ready to go” for the Super Bowl. Such comments offer reassurance that the Seahawks feel confident in their quarterback’s condition heading into the biggest game of the season.While full participation in practice doesn’t guarantee perfect performance, it does clear up any lingering doubts about Darnold’s availability. With kickoff scheduled for 6:30 p.m. ET at Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, California, Seattle will want its leader at full strength. Darnold’s ability to throw, move in the pocket, and stay effective under pressure even with previous limitations has been a key factor in the team’s success this season.Seattle's strategy will probably depend on Darnold's experience and rhythm. He has been effective during the playoffs, and his leadership has helped the Seahawks get through tough times. He played at a high level in important games, even though he only practiced a little earlier in the week.While Darnold’s return to full practice is the most significant news, the Seahawks are also managing other minor issues. Rookie safety Nick Emmanwori sat out practice due to a low ankle sprain, but both he and the team remain optimistic about his availability for the Super Bowl.For now, the outlook is positive. With Darnold practicing fully and expressing confidence in his recovery, it looks likely that Seattle’s quarterback will take the field on Super Bowl Sunday ready to lead the Seahawks in their pursuit of the Lombardi Trophy.","Seattle seahawks quarterback sam darnold returned to full practice on thursday.

You are not missing this one.

The network airs an NFL Films “Road to the Super Bowl” special at noon ET, then a five-hour Super Bowl LX pregame show starting at 1 p.m. ET, all leading into Patriots vs. Seahawks at 6:30 p.m. ET on NBC, Peacock, Telemundo, and Universo.For most fans, this is what your setup looks like:If you are watching in the UK, kickoff is set for 11:30 p.m. GMT on Sunday night. Channel 5 carries the game free-to-air, while Sky Sports Main Event and Sky Sports NFL, along with NOW TV and DAZN’s NFL Game Pass, give you subscription options.The Super Bowl 60 halftime show is not on a separate channel.If you want Bad Bunny, you stay exactly where you are.With kickoff at 6:30 p.m. ET, halftime usually lands somewhere between roughly 8 and 8:30 p.m. ET, depending on how long the first half actually takes. That means you should plan for Bad Bunny to hit the stage in that window if you are in the United States.For UK viewers, that roughly translates to 1 to 1:30 a.m. GMT on Monday morning. If you are only staying up for the Apple Music Super Bowl LX Halftime Show, you can afford to skip the first half, then jump in a little after 1 a.m. on Channel 5 or Sky.This is the Bad Bunny show as much as it is Patriots vs. Seahawks. The Puerto Rican star is the first solo Latin male artist to headline the halftime stage and is expected to perform an entirely Spanish-language set.He has already done the Super Bowl cameo thing once, when he joined Shakira and Jennifer Lopez back in 2020. This time, the stage is his, even if he refuses to spill details. Asked about surprise guests, he shrugged it off with “You know that’s something that I not gonna tell you” and kept the guest list locked down.The choice has also lit up the political crowd. Donald Trump has already said he will not attend after Bad Bunny and Green Day, who both oppose his politics, were chosen. He called the decision “a terrible choice” and said “I’m anti-them. All it does is sow hatred.” That is the climate around this halftime show before a single snap is played.If you are the type who watches Super Bowl Sunday like an awards show, the music lineup is loaded before Bad Bunny ever walks out.Here is the core list for Levi’s Stadium on Feb. 8:On top of the TV talent, NBC’s game broadcast will feature Mike Tirico on play-by-play, Cris Collinsworth in the booth, Melissa Stark and Kaylee Hartung on the sidelines, and Terry McAulay handling rules analysis.So if your group chat is split between Drake Maye vs. Sam Darnold talk and people who only care about Bad Bunny, Charlie Puth, and Green Day, this game is built for both sides. You get a full music festival wrapped around a Super Bowl rematch, and all of it lives on the same channels and streams you already use.","Super bowl lx kicks off on sunday, feb. 8, at 6:30 p.m. Et on nbc from levi’s stadium in santa clara, california.

Travis Kelce celebrates Super Bowl week with music, style, and a Swift-inspired moment

Super Bowl week is always loud, busy, and full of late nights. Travis Kelce made sure his week followed the same vibe. Even without Taylor Swift by his side, her presence still filled the room. At a party in the Bay Area, the Kansas City Chiefs star was spotted smiling, dancing, and clearly enjoying himself as one of Swift’s most famous songs played from the DJ booth.Kelce had earlier attended the NFL Honors ceremony, where he was nominated for the Walter Payton Man of the Year award. He did not win, but that did not slow him down. A few hours later, he showed up relaxed and upbeat at the “Tight Ends and Friends” party. Phones were out. Music was loud. And Kelce looked like someone who was ready to enjoy the moment.A short video shared by the New Heights podcast X account showed Travis Kelce standing between DJs Andrew Fedyk and Joe De Pace, known together as Loud Luxury.The timing felt intentional. As soon as Kelce settled in near the booth, the DJs played a mashup that blended You Belong With Me by Taylor Swift with We Found Love, produced by Calvin Harris.The crowd reacted instantly, and Kelce leaned into the moment rather than stepping back.Kelce did not stay quiet or reserved. He clapped, moved with the beat, and helped keep the energy up around the stage.At one point, he pulled out his phone and recorded the scene himself, smiling as the music played. It felt less like a publicity moment and more like something he wanted to remember later.When the DJs switched to “The Fate of Ophelia,” Kelce stayed right there, nodding along and soaking in the atmosphere instead of heading back into the crowd.Earlier that evening, Kelce had already made headlines at the NFL Honors ceremony. He arrived wearing a bold suit paired with sunglasses, a look that quickly stood out among the more traditional outfits.That same confidence carried into the party later, where his mood stayed light and relaxed.

Phil Mickelson says Tiger Woods's rivalry elevated him



The Tiger Woods vs. Phil Mickelson rivalry has dominated golf news for years. However, there’s a positive side as well, an inspirational one about how competition creates greatness. Former LIV golfer Pat Perez revealed how Woods not only outplayed Lefty, but he also transformed him into a Hall of Famer, as we all know now.“The intimidation factor that Tiger had is like nothing; you know, you might not see it again.” On February 5th, Perez stated on the Golf Subpar Podcast. “As great as Phil is, Tiger pushed him right here. He’s got 46 wins, six majors, and won one at 50.”They have 21 major titles and 127 PGA Tour victories between them. Mickelson’s last major came in 2021 when he won the PGA Championship at 50 years, 11 months, and 7 days, becoming the oldest major winner.Tiger Woods repeatedly defeated Mickelson by slim margins in their early pairings: 71 to 73, 68 to 75, and 72 to 71. Overall, in rounds where both played in the same group and faced off against each other on the PGA Tour, the following statistics are as follows:In 2007, Mickelson recruited Butch Harmon, a swing coach who had previously worked with Woods; he improved his fitness routine and sharpened his short game. The decision paid off immediately, as Lefty won his first Players Championship that spring.Mickelson was dubbed ""Tiger Slayer"" when he shot 64 to Woods' 75 at the 2012 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am, an 11-stroke thumping victory. It wasn’t luck. It was the outcome of years spent responding to Woods’s game.“He owned me head-to-head until ’07. Over the course of my career, I believe that he pushed me to achieve a higher level of play,” Mickelson confirmed in 2015. It was more than just respect; it was recognition that the power of one rival had influenced his entire professional path.At the 2017 PGA Championship, five years later, Mickelson showed the extent of Woods's impact. “He forced everybody to work a little bit harder. He forced everybody to look at fitness as a big part of the game of golf, and I think that’s actually helped me with longevity,” Mickelson stated. “I don’t think I would have had the same level of success had he not come around.”Tiger Woods also helped Phil Mickelson extend his career by encouraging him to perform better. He even claimed that the 15x major winner pushed him to swing harder. Mickelson was not alone in feeling this. Ernie Els, who finished second to Woods multiple times in majors, echoed the sentiment.","Former liv golfer pat perez revealed how woods not only outplayed lefty, but he also transformed him into a hall of famer. “the intimidation factor that tiger had is like nothing; you know, you might not see it again.”","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127999525,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-46528,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"

Sonny Jurgensen’s estimated net worth

Broadcasting career and other sources

The NFL world is mourning the loss of Sonny Jurgensen, who is one of the greatest pure passers in NFL history. The Hall of Fame quarterback passed away at the age of 91, As fans remember his achievements, many are also curious about his financial success and overall net worth.At the time of his passing, Jurgensen’s estimated net worth was around $2 million, according to a source . That number might not seem like much compared to today's superstar quarterbacks, but it was a lot during the time he played.Jurgensen built his wealth primarily through his long NFL career and later through broadcasting roles. Player salaries in the 1950s, 60s and early 70s were nowhere near today’s massive contracts. Even star quarterbacks earned significantly less than modern-day players.Still, he made the most of his opportunities by transitioning successfully into a second career in sports media after retiring from football.The Philadelphia Eagles picked Jurgensen in the 1957 NFL Draft. He later became a franchise icon with Washington. He was a four-time All-Pro and led the league in passing yards several times during his career. He was later inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame, which solidified his status as one of the best players in the history of the game.Although exact contract figures from his playing days are not publicly available, NFL salaries during that period were relatively modest. Many players even worked second jobs in the offseason. Jurgensen’s financial growth was steady rather than explosive, built on longevity and smart career moves.After retiring in 1974, Jurgensen moved into broadcasting. He worked with CBS and later became a longtime radio voice for Washington football. His broadcasting career lasted nearly four decades, adding stability and steady income to his post-playing life.In addition to broadcasting, he made money from endorsements and public appearances. He was a well-known and respected figure in sports for many years after he retired from football.His net worth may not be as high as that of current NFL stars. He concluded his career with more than 32,000 throwing yards and 255 touchdowns, which were remarkable numbers for his period. More importantly, he helped shape passing football into what it is today and had an impact on many quarterbacks throughout the years.","Sonny jurgensen is one of the greatest pure passers in nfl history.

Boston Celtics strengthen roster with strategic Nikola Vucevic trade from Chicago Bulls

Nikola Vucevic brings experience and double-double power to Boston Celtics frontcourt

During this year's NBA trade deadline, the Boston Celtics traded a number of players, but they have also added a significant player in center. Nikola Vucevic, who will miss Wednesday's game against the Houston Rockets, has joined the team. The Bulls traded him to the Celtics, who then traded Anfernee Simons from the Celtics.The Celtics made three small trades before the 3 p.m. game after obtaining big man Nikola Vucevic and a second-round pick from the Chicago Bulls in exchange for guard Anfernee Simons. They have also sent Xavier Tillman to the Charlotte Hornets, Josh Minott to the Brooklyn Nets, and Chris Boucher to the Utah Jazz.After acquiring center Nikola Vucevic from the Chicago Bulls in exchange for guard Anfernee Simons, the Boston Celtics have added some depth to their front line for the postseason run. The Celtics acquired the talented big one day before the trade deadline, giving him a change of scenery after six seasons with the Bulls.Boston's tax burden will drop significantly as a result of the shift, from approximately $39 million to $17 million. The Celtics also have additional financial flexibility as part of the transaction, which they may use to make other deals. However, despite his Tuesday trade from Chicago to Boston, Vucevic isn't nearly ready to make his Celtics debut.Moreover, there was no mention of Vucevic in Boston's injury report that Celtics reporter Noa Dalzell issued on Friday. The omission of his name suggests that he will make his Celtics debut on Friday.The seasoned center will probably replace Neemias Queta in the starting lineup after he becomes comfortable with his new squad. Vucevic will possibly have his next opportunity to play against Miami on Friday. After this deal, Boston was a little shorthanded during Wednesday's game, but the fans could see the Celtics' newest roster in action on Friday against the Heat.Vucevic, a 35-year-old in his 15th season, is one of the most reliable double-double machines when he arrives in Boston. Vucevic has averaged 18.5 points and 10.5 rebounds a game during the past ten campaigns, officially recording double-doubles in eight of them.Vucevic is now joining his fourth franchise after playing for the Bulls, Philadelphia, and Orlando. Similar to his career averages of 17.2 points and 10.4 rebounds per game, he has averaged 16.9 points and 9.0 rebounds this season.With Xavier Tillman Sr., Luka Garza, and Neemias Queta making up Boston's center rotation, Vucevic joined a frontline that was lacking in experience. He has played in 1,020 regular-season games and 16 playoff games, including 10 with the Orlando Magic in 2018-20.Additionally, he has been with Chicago for the past five and a half seasons. He is now moving to Boston, where he will start at center right away. In 48 games this season, Vucevic has averaged 16.9 points, 9.0 rebounds, and 3.8 assists.","Nikola vucevic will miss wednesday's game against the houston rockets.

New Kids on the block opened the pop music door

Gloria Estefan changed the language of the halftime show

Prince set the gold standard in the rain

Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake changed tv forever

Kendrick Lamar and Rihanna redefined modern halftime shows

The Super Bowl halftime show has slowly turned into one of the biggest moments in global entertainment. While football remains the heart of the night, millions now watch just to see what happens during those 13 minutes on stage. As Super Bowl LX approaches with Bad Bunny set to perform, it is worth looking back at the moments that shaped how halftime shows are viewed today. These performances were not just concerts. They changed rules, broke records, and reflected culture in real time.For many years, halftime shows were led by marching bands and safe performances. That pattern broke in 1991 when New Kids on the Block became the first major pop act to headline.The show included a children’s choir and songs aimed at a family audience. It was not widely praised, but it mattered.Donnie Wahlberg later told Playboy, “I don’t know how much pride I take in the actual performance. But I take pride in the fact that we were the first ones to do it.”In 1999, Gloria Estefan made history by becoming the first Spanish-language artist to headline a Super Bowl halftime show.According to ESPN, her Miami performance blended English and Spanish and reflected the city’s culture.Years later, speaking to E! News, Estefan advised Bad Bunny ahead of his halftime moment, saying, “Enjoy every second because it really goes by so fast.”Many critics still point to Prince's 2007 as the greatest halftime show ever. Performing during heavy rain, Prince closed with “Purple Rain,” creating a moment that felt unplanned and unforgettable. The Athletic later wrote that no performer before or after has matched the impact of that night.Not every moment brought praise. In 2004, Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake were involved in a wardrobe malfunction watched by more than 140 million viewers, according to The Guardian. The incident led to stricter broadcast rules and changed how live TV was handled for years.In 2025, Kendrick Lamar delivered the most-watched halftime show ever, with 133.5 million viewers, according to Billboard.Two years earlier, Rihanna stunned fans by performing an entire set while pregnant, suspended above the field. BuzzFeed News praised the show for its calm confidence and control.","The super bowl halftime show has slowly turned into one of the biggest moments in global entertainment.

As Canada's men's hockey team navigates pre-Olympic injuries with swift replacements, GM Doug Armstrong has recently opened up about the roster tweaks in the team. He has emphasized the flexibility of the lineup adjustments ahead of the Milano Cortina Winter Olympics. As reported by TSN, Team Canada has been forced to make significant changes just days before the Winter Olympic Games began.In an unfortunate situation, just a week back, the Tampa Bay Lightning forwards Anthony Cirelli and Brayden Point were forced off the team due to injury and were reportedly replaced by Florida Panthers’ Sam Bennett and Carolina Hurricanes winger Seth Jarvis. Meanwhile, General Manager Doug Armstrong said that replacing players was difficult, but he and the management group believe Bennett and Jarvis will be a great addition to the team. Canada's Olympic GM Doug Armstrong has shared a positive overview on bolstering the men's hockey team with Sam Bennett and Seth Jarvis as injury replacements, emphasizing seamless integration and depth. As Brayden Point and Anthony Cirelli were removed from the team due to injury, they were replaced by Sam Bennet and Seth Jarvis. In his recent discussions, Armstrong has stressed building a versatile roster capable of handling in-tournament injuries through a curated reserve list.According to the NHL, Seth Jarvis had an assist and played three of four games at the 4 Nations Face-Off, recording one assist. He has 25 goals and 18 assists with the Hurricanes this season. Bennett also had a very crucial tournament-clinching victory over the United States, as he scored the tying goal late in the second period that would set the stage for Connor McDavid’s overtime winner. Reports suggest that the forward has 19 goals and 42 points in 57 games with the Panthers this season.It is to be noted that 19 of Canada's 23 players from the 4 Nations Face-Off tournament are going to the Olympics, and much of the Canadian Olympic roster is similar to the one that won the 4 Nations Face-Off last February. As it stands, 19 of the 25-player roster headed to Milano-Cortina played on the 4 Nations roster. Macklin Celebrini, Bo Horvat, Nick Suzuki, Tom Wilson, Darcy Kuemper, and Logan Thompson are the only newcomers. Meanwhile, Canada will also have the same coaching staff, led by Jon Cooper.","Gm doug armstrong has recently opened up about the roster tweaks in the team.

Why the trophy is named after Vince Lombardi

Vince Lombardi’s record explains the respect

What the Vince Lombardi Trophy is made of

What lifting the trophy means for players

Why the Super Bowl trophy still matters most

The Super Bowl does not really end when the clock hits zero. The night feels complete only when the winning team lifts the silver trophy in front of the world. That moment is what players dream about from their first day in the NFL. The Super Bowl Trophy is more than a prize. It stands for a full season of pain, pressure, and belief. Every tackle, every practice, and every risk leads to that lift. Officially called the Vince Lombardi Trophy, it carries the weight of football history. Only one team earns it each year, and no second chances exist. That is why this trophy matters more than any stat line or highlight clip. It marks the difference between a good season and a legendary one.The NFL named the trophy after Vince Lombardi because he changed how winning looked in football. Lombardi coached the Green Bay Packers to victories in the first two Super Bowls.After he passed away in 1970 following cancer, the league renamed the trophy in his honor. Since then, every champion lifts a trophy tied to his legacy.Lombardi’s success was not luck. He finished his NFL coaching career with a 96–34–6 regular-season record.In the playoffs, he lost just once.That standard still defines greatness today. His belief was simple: preparation decides everything. That idea still lives inside every Super Bowl locker room.The trophy is made completely of silver. It stands 22 inches tall and weighs about seven pounds. A football sits on top in kicking position, showing how every season begins.Each trophy costs around $50,000. According to the NFL, a brand-new trophy is created every year, and the winning team keeps it forever.For stars like Tom Brady, Patrick Mahomes, and Aaron Rodgers, lifting the trophy changed how their careers were remembered. One moment can turn a great player into a legend. That is the power of this trophy.In today’s NFL, money, fame, and records come quickly. But none of them replace the Super Bowl Trophy. It is the one thing every player wants, and most never touch. That reality keeps the trophy special every single year.","The nfl named the trophy after vince lombardi because he changed how winning looked in football.

Chemistry between young stars helped Switzerland weather the early storm in the Olympics



The opening game of Switzerland's Olympic campaign required grit, resilience, and contributions from veterans and newcomers alike. When the moment demanded excellence, two established stars delivered while a new generation announced its arrival on the sport's biggest stage.Alina Muller and Lara Stalder shifted momentum throughout the Group A thriller against Czechia on Friday. The duo consistently created offensive chances and provided the spark Switzerland needed to erase a two-goal deficit in the final period, even helping their team secure the win.With an early goal from Kristyna Kaltounkova, Team Czechia seized the game in their favor early, but the Swiss didn’t allow the lead to continue for long. Just minutes later, Laura Zimmerman slapped the puck inside the net to level the game.But the Czechs soon turned the game in their favor as goals by Natalie Mlynkova and Tereza Plosova put their team ahead 3-1 with minutes remaining on the clock. While a victory looked unachievable, Switzerland refused to concede.Muller scored a power-play goal 10 minutes into the third period, orchestrating a tic-tac-toe sequence with Stalder and Ivana Wey that cut the deficit to one.Defender Lara Christen then rifled home the tying goal with less than three minutes remaining in regulation to force overtime.The Swiss controlled possession through the three-on-three overtime period before the game went to a shootout. Both Muller and Stalder scored in the skills competition, with Wey delivering the decisive goal in the eighth round to seal the victory.Switzerland's new generation contributed significantly in their Olympic debuts. Defender Alessia Baechler, a 20-year-old rookie at Northeastern, led all Swiss players in ice time and played crucial minutes during the three-on-three overtime session.Wey, who turned 20 two days before the Olympics, was one of only three Swiss forwards, alongside Muller and Stalder, to play over 20 minutes. The young forward, who is headed to Northeastern Huskies next season, made a spectacular pass to Muller for the power-play goal before scoring twice in the shootout, including the winner.""We always believed that we could play over 60 minutes, and that's what we did,"" Zimmerman said. ""That's why we came back and won that game.""

On the other hand, Toronto is managing its own absences. With several regular contributors unavailable, this matchup is likely to depend on how each team deals with absences and rotation fillers rather than star power.The Chicago Bulls are adjusting to a roster that looks very different from earlier in the season.• Zach Collins - Right first-toe sprain• Ayo Dosunmu - Not with team (trade-related)• Noa Essengue - Recovering from left-shoulder surgery• Josh Giddey - Left hamstring strain• Tre Jones - Left hamstring strain• Julian Phillips - Not with team (trade-related)• Dalen Terry - Not with team (trade-related)• Nikola Vucevic - Not with team (trade-related)• Ousmane Dieng - Trade pending• Collin Sexton - Trade pendingProbable / Expected to Play• Jaden Ivey - ProbableChicago is expected to rely more on younger guards, and the frontcourt depth is limited.Toronto Raptors is also dealing with availability issues, particularly in the paint.• RJ Barrett - Managed right-knee sprain• Jakob Poeltl - Lower-back strain• Chucky Hepburn - G League assignment• A.J. Lawson - G League assignment• Ayo Dosunmu - Bilateral quad-tendon issue• Tre Jones - Left hamstring strainWithout Barrett and Poeltl, Toronto loses a primary scorer on the wing and its main rim protector. That places more responsibility on the backcourt.• Chicago Bulls - 4 wins• Toronto Raptors - 0 winsChicago has won each matchup by an average of about 7.5 points and has outscored Toronto by roughly 15 points per 100 possessions.• Total games: 110• Bulls wins: 61• Raptors wins: 49Chicago is 24-27, placing 10th in the East and third in the Central Division.• Points per game: ~117.2• Field-goal percentage: ~47.3%• Three-point percentage: ~36.8%• Turnovers: ~14.4Ball movement remains a strength, but the absence of Nikola Vucevic and the injury to Josh Giddey have shifted more creation to the perimeter.• Points allowed: ~120.2• Rebounds: ~45.3 (3rd in NBA)• Net rating: about -3.0The Bulls rebound well but have struggled defensively, especially around the rim and on perimeter rotations.Toronto is close to the .500 mark with results largely driven by defense.• Points per game: mid-110s• Three-point shooting: roughly 34-35%• Assists: just over 28The offense relies on pick-and-roll sets and transition scoring, but outside shooting and turnovers have limited efficiency.• Points allowed per 100 possessions: around 113-114• Net rating: slightly positiveToronto defends the perimeter effectively, though Poeltl’s absence reduces interior protection.With Giddey, Jones, and Collins out, Chicago will depend on Jaden Ivey and its remaining ball-handlers to attack the defense and create second-chance opportunities. The Bulls’ rebounding advantage could matter against a smaller Toronto lineup.Toronto is likely to push the pace and force contested shots. Defensive communication and help coverage will be important without a traditional interior anchor.Rebounding and second-chance points favor Chicago, while Toronto may attempt more three-pointers despite a lower percentage. Based on the season series and current injuries, the spread is expected to lean slightly toward the Bulls.Both teams enter the game dealing with lineup changes and missing players. Chicago has controlled the season series, but Toronto’s defense has kept games competitive. The result may come down to which team handles the rotation gaps more effectively and executes late in the game.","Chicago bulls host the toronto raptors on february 5, 2026.

Stafford’s MVP Win Defined by Heartfelt ""MVD"" Tribute from His Four Daughters

""To my four beautiful daughters... you guys are my 'why',""

The 5-Point Controversy: Was Drake Maye Robbed?

Value vs. Volume: Stafford had the ""volume"" (46 TDs), but Maye had the ""value,"" leading a rebuilding Patriots team to a 14-3 record with a significantly weaker supporting cast.

Efficiency: Maye led the league in completion percentage (72%) and passer rating (113.5).



The ""Super Bowl"" Irony: Fans were quick to point out that while Stafford was accepting a trophy, Maye was busy preparing to play in Super Bowl LX this Sunday.



Public and Celebrity Reaction: A Split Decision

The Legends: Tom Brady and Steve Young have been vocal in their support of Stafford, calling it a ""lifetime achievement"" win for a veteran who has finally earned his flowers.



The New Guard: Younger fans and analysts argue that the MVP award should go to the ""best player that year,"" not the player with the best story.

The Meme Wars: Today, February 7th, is Stafford's 38th birthday. Memes are already circulating of him ""stealing"" the trophy as a birthday gift from the voters.
