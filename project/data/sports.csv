Sidhu’s predicted India XI:

Yashasvi Jaiswal, KL Rahul, Sai Sudharsan, Shubman Gill, Rishabh Pant, Karun Nair, Ravindra Jadeja, Washington Sundar, Jasprit Bumrah, Mohammed Siraj, Anshul Kamboj.

NEW DELHI: As India gear up for a must-win fourth Test against England at Old Trafford, former cricketer Navjot Singh Sidhu has weighed in with his predicted playing XI, calling for Sai Sudharsan’s return and expressing doubts over Karun Nair’s place in the side.With India trailing 1-2 in the five-match Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy, the team’s selection decisions ahead of Wednesday’s Test have become a major talking point — particularly in light of Nitish Reddy’s injury and doubts over pacers Akash Deep and Arshdeep Singh.On his YouTube channel, Sidhu endorsed a lineup that included Sudharsan, dropped after a modest debut (0 and 30) in the first Test, and left out since.“Karun Nair is a promising cricketer, but his technical weakness has been exposed,” said Sidhu. “When you think of winning, I ask — what is the fault of Sai Sudharsan?”He hailed Sudharsan’s recent domestic and IPL form, saying, “You have one of the most promising players in India. He’s technically sound — low gravity, hand-eye coordination, and head over toe. Why shouldn’t he be in the team?”He also showered praise on Mohammed Siraj, calling him the unsung hero of India’s pace unit: “Siraj has bowled over 900 overs since 2020.He’s played 25 out of 27 overseas games. Controlled pace in England is key — and Siraj brings that in abundance.”Meanwhile, skipper Shubman Gill backed Nair, saying: “He didn’t bat at his number in the first game. We’ve had conversations with him, and he will turn it around.”With the series on the line and India’s middle order under the scanner, the final XI remains to be seen.",Former cricketer navjot singh sidhu has predicted india's playing xi for the fourth test against england at old trafford.

Bryce Harper delivered at the right time



FAQs

Q: How far did Bryce Harper’s 350th home run travel?



Q: How many active players have hit 350 or more home runs?



Q: What makes Harper’s milestone unique?



Philadelphia Phillies star Bryce Harper added another historic milestone to his already decorated career Wednesday night, becoming the youngest active MLB player to reach 350 career home runs. The blast, a jaw-dropping 439-foot rocket into the right-field stands, came in the first inning of a high-energy matchup against the Boston Red Sox at Citizens Bank Park— and had both fans and stat-watchers cheer for the star.It didn’t take long for Harper to make his mark. Facing Red Sox right-hander Lucas Giolito, the 32-year-old slugger jumped on a first-pitch fastball and launched it with authority.The ball exploded off his bat at 110.8 mph and cleared the fence with ease. Not only did the blast set a personal best for the year, but it also etched Harper into an exclusive group of just eight active players to reach the 350-homer plateau.Among those in the 350+ club: Giancarlo Stanton (434), Mike Trout (395), Paul Goldschmidt (370), Manny Machado (360), Freddie Freeman (353), Nolan Arenado (351), and Aaron Judge (351). What sets Harper apart is his age— at 32, he’s the youngest active player on the list.The home run wasn’t just a career moment. It was also a key part of the Phillies’ explosive start. Kyle Schwarber set the tone earlier in the inning with a 409-foot two-run homer that scored Trea Turner. Harper followed up with his solo shot to give Philadelphia a quick 3–0 lead and leave the Red Sox reeling.Harper’s milestone comes during a scorching hot stretch. After returning from nearly a month on the injured list due to right wrist inflammation, the former MVP has been tearing up opposing pitchers. Heading into Wednesday, he was batting .429 (15-for-35) with nine doubles, four homers, seven RBIs, and a stunning 1.529 OPS over his last nine games.The timing of Harper’s resurgence couldn’t be better for the Phillies, who are eyeing a strong second-half push. And if Schwarber continues slugging alongside him, he now has 34 homers on the season; the duo could carry serious October implications.Also Read: Minnesota Vikings legend Adrian Peterson shares training video ahead of boxing match against nemesis Baby Joe A: It went 439 feet with an exit velocity of 110.8 mph.A: Bryce Harper is now one of eight active players to reach that mark.A: At 32, he’s the youngest active MLB player to hit 350 career home runs.",Bryce harper became the youngest active mlb player to reach 350 career home runs.

What did fans have to say on Shaquille O'Neal's bitter statement?

Shaquille O'Neal recently revived his 'Shaqstradamus' persona, known for bold predictions, with his latest comments have drawn criticism from NBA fans. The basketball legend faced accusations of being a hater after sharing his thoughts on the new romance between Dallas Mavericks star Klay Thompson and Houston rapper Megan Thee Stallion On a recent episode of The Big Podcast, O'Neal reacted to the couple's relationship with skepticism. When co-host Adam Lefkoe mentioned the budding romance, O'Neal rolled his eyes and shook his head. During a DraftKings-inspired segment, Lefkoe asked Shaq to set betting odds on how long Thompson and Megan Thee Stallion's relationship would last. O'Neal quickly dismissed the idea of their romance enduring, stating he wouldn’t bet on its longevity with max limit of six weeks.The podcast moved on after less than three minutes on the topic, but fans and social media users lingered, accusing O'Neal of jealousy and bitterness. Within hours, old Instagram Live clips resurfaced, highlighting O'Neal's apparent interest in Megan Thee Stallion. In one 2023 post, O'Neal joined her IG Live, commenting, ""Merry Christmas boo boo,"" as she prepared for a performance.A clip captured him among 49,000 viewers watching Megan Thee Stallion twerk to her hit ""WAP,"" where he wrote, ""Watching that booty.""These moments fueled online backlash, with one user commenting, ""Shaq said six weeks because he couldn't even get six minutes with her."" Another added, ""Love you, big fella, but you're just mad Klay beat you to it."" The resurfaced comments sparked accusations of attention-seeking, prompting O'Neal to clarify his intentions.He explained, ""I was on the line and in the comments. Somebody asked me what I was doing, and I said, 'I’m watching the booty.' What do you mean, what am I doing? That's what twerking is for, right?"" He insisted his remarks were not meant to be disrespectful, describing Megan as ""athletic, so beautiful, and so gorgeous"" and emphasizing that his words were ""in a positive way.""He’s set to join Ernie Johnson, Kenny Smith, and Charles Barkley on ESPN’s basketball broadcasts and has hinted at appearances on other network programs. Klay Thompson and Megan Thee Stallion have not publicly addressed O'Neal’s remarks. Given the public’s interest in Megan’s dating history, especially following her legal issues with Tory Lanez, fans seem more focused on supporting the couple than engaging with O'Neal’s critique. While Shaq’s larger-than-life persona continues to stir conversation, his comments on this romance have only amplified the scrutiny he faces online.Also read:","Shaquille o'neal's comments on klay thompson and megan thee stallion got backlash from the fans.

The NFL preseason is underway, and the San Francisco 49ers still don’t seem ready to make a hot start. They are planning to start the camp this week, but without two of their crown jewels in stable health. Christian McCaffrey, the superstar running back, couldn’t showcase his prowess in more than just four games last season as he suffered from a distorted Achilles and PCL injury. But now, the situation looks to be better, but the question it begs: what kind of better? Can he really show up for the 2025 regular season and help the 49ers get rid of the 6-11 curse with ease? Well, the answer is all but promising.The disaster started with a simple pre-season calf strain, but it eventually grew into a more serious Achilles tendinitis. The 28-year-old couldn’t even think of lacing up his cleats for the first eight games of the season. However, after prolonged medical care, he made a remarkable comeback in week 9. But before the fans could even process the joy, he went down again, and this time with a season-ending PCL injury during a lackluster loss to the Buffaloes.Kyle Shanahan has high hopes of McCaffrey defying all the odds and being back to his full health before the season kicks in. He said that the RB is, and so is their most significant left tackle, Trent Williams.The other officials also suggested positive feedback on McCaffrey’s ongoing healing.

But it’s just July, and it won’t be a shell-shocking update if his two major injuries recur during September’s high-octane schedule and affect his performances in some way or other. However, for now, all signs point toward smooth sailing.McCaffrey wasn’t in the scene for so long. The 49ers RB room is typically leaned towards guns like Saquon Barkley, Derrick Henry, and emerging stars Jahmyr Gibbs and Bijan Robinson in the meantime. But don’t get it wrong, the veteran was pushing himself hard in silence when no one was watching. He never gave up on the idea of being back in his prime. He knows he is still the guy the team needs to win games, no matter what fans anticipate about rookie Ashton Jeanty or anyone else.And the star running back behaves like that. On Monday, he fueled the return anticipation with a highly positive Instagram update featuring a few snaps of his sculpted physique after an intense workout. That grit in his body, the sheer passion in the sweat is undeniable, and so is his urge to return. It seems it’s only a matter of time before the 49ers get a taste of their boy, renewed, recharged!There are no official updates yet. But the way he’s progressing, it looks so.

What is the reason behind Shemar Stewart’s absence from camp?

How is Joe Burrow reacting to the defensive absences?

Urgency grows as Bengals risk losing momentum without defensive stars

The Cincinnati Bengals are back in training camp, but not everything is going according to plan. Star quarterback Joe Burrow is already voicing concerns—and this time, it’s not about the offense. Two key defensive players, Trey Hendrickson and rookie Shemar Stewart, are missing from camp, and it’s causing real problems.A year ago, Joe Burrow delivered one of the best seasons of his career. But despite his elite performances, the Bengals failed to make the playoffs. Why? The defense simply couldn’t keep up. Cincinnati gave up too many big plays and failed to close out tight games.Now, with the 2025 season approaching, the Bengals were counting on a revamped defensive unit to fix those issues. But the absence of Hendrickson and Stewart is a major setback. Hendrickson is one of the NFL’s most reliable pass rushers, and Stewart was drafted in the first round to bring fresh energy off the edge. Without them, Cincinnati’s defense is lacking the power and speed it desperately needs.Both players are staying away from camp for different reasons. Hendrickson is seeking a contract extension that reflects his value as a top-tier defensive end.Stewart, meanwhile, is holding out until his rookie contract language is finalized. These unresolved issues have left the Bengals defense thin at a critical position.Joe Burrow didn’t hide his frustration when asked about the situation. He described it as “disappointing,” a word that sums up how fans and coaches feel too. In a competitive AFC North, the Bengals can’t afford distractions or a weakened defense.Trey Hendrickson is holding out of Bengals training camp as he seeks a contract extension. He wants a raise that reflects his status as one of the NFL’s top pass rushers.First-round rookie Shemar Stewart is sitting out due to unresolved contract language in his rookie deal. He’s asking for simplified terms before officially joining the team.Joe Burrow called the situation “disappointing” and emphasized the importance of having a full roster, especially on defense, as the Bengals prepare for the 2025 NFL season.Every day Hendrickson and Stewart miss is a lost opportunity to build chemistry on defense. The Bengals need both players in camp, learning schemes and working with teammates. While Burrow will continue to lead a powerful offense, he knows a strong defense is essential for a deep playoff run.Also Read: Good news for Buffalo Bills fans: Iconic red helmets make long-awaited comeback in Week 18 Cincinnati must act fast to get both players back on the field.

Former Chicago Bulls player Dwyane Wade recently criticized Bleacher Report's Kobe Bryant ranking. For context, the NBA star was not listed in the top 10 of Bleacher Report's June ranking of the 100 greatest NBA players of all time. There is ongoing debate among players on the proper ranking of specific players on that list. In the meantime, the Hall of Famer expressed on his podcast channels that he finds it hard to comprehend the commotion surrounding a single basketball article authored by individuals who have never participated in the NBA.Making an attempt at ranking all of the NBA players is never easy, but Bleacher Report recently gave it a go. Although there will always be people who disagree with particular rankings, the ranking of the late NBA legend Kobe Bryant of the Los Angeles Lakers was negative.The first player to criticize the report for ranking him as the 10th greatest player of all time was NBA legend Shaquille O'Neal. Now Dwyane Wade, the former player for the Miami Heat said the same.During his recent podcast episode, he said:""If you wanna ask us hoopers who played against [Kobe Bryant], all of us are going to talk top three [all time]... Like we all gonna talk top three if you played against Mamba. But, someone's opinion that's never played against Kobe, who has never played a game of basketball at the level that we play it at, having him at 11, why am I up in arms about something like that?""He continued:""They had rankings when he played in the league, and they had him low, I remember one year, and Kobe addressed it..Like, 'who is these idiots?' Like, 'why would I listen to these idiots?' And I'm not calling the person that did this an idiot, but what I'm saying is when someone does something like that, Kobe was like, 'this is idiotic to me.'""The NBA player-cum-podcaster went on to say that if someone hasn't watched him play, they aren't qualified to pass judgement. He continued:“So how can I rank somebody in an order [if] I’ve never seen a lot of these guys … it can never be fair in my opinion … I know who was great. I know who was hard to guard, and I know who was a bad m*********** when I watched them.”Dwyane Wade went on to support Kobe Bryant , saying that it is disrespectful to not include him in the top ten of the Bleacher Report's new all-time rankings. His support of Kobe Bryant ultimately serves as a reminder of the legacy that the NBA legend has left.Also read: Dwyane Wade says Gabrielle Union can’t stand being called ‘Gabby’—prefers the family nickname ‘Nickie’",Former chicago bulls player dwyane wade recently criticized bleacher report's kobe bryant ranking.

Adrian Peterson shares preparation video for his upcoming boxing match

Baby Joe is not slacking on getting prepped for the match

A few months ago, a video from a social club in Houston called JokerStars went viral. Former Minnesota Vikings star Adrian Peterson was seen getting into a fist fight with professional poker player, Joe ""Baby Joe"" Castaneda. Now, the two rivals have signed for a Celebrity Boxing match, which will be set for some time in the near future. After their near brawls, this will be the perfect opportunity for both Peterson and Castaneda to release all the pent-up tension between them.Earlier this year, Adrian Peterson and Joe ""Baby Joe"" Castaneda had a disagreement during a game of poker which led to a physical altercation between the two of them. Then again, on May 27, a game of Poker led to another altercation that went viral. Celebrity Boxing founder Damon Feldman thus got the two of them to come forth for a boxing match, while he still irons out all the kinks before the two get inside a ring.Ahead of their match, NFL legend Peterson has shared a video of his training session. Sporting a maroon tee, grey shorts, and black shoes, he gloved up for his upcoming match against his nemesis. The running back looked sharp as he practiced his moves with a training partner. TMZ shared the video, writing:""Adrian Peterson's begun training for his celebrity boxing match with his poker rival ...and while his hands could certainly use some more sharpening, it's clear he's in great shape.""While fans are yet to be informed of when and where the match will take place, both men are getting ready to gain the upper hand before they have to fight it out with each other.Joe ""Baby Joe"" Castaneda, the professional poker player who is getting ready for his first bout inside a boxing ring, is not slacking off. Similar to his opponent, he too has been preparing for the upcoming match and has hired combat sports coach Teddy Concepcion to train him. Both of them have signed with Celeb Boxing for their boxing match, and we will get to know the details soon.After their fight over a poker game dispute, Adrian Peterson had apologized, saying he ""felt really bad"" over what happened and did ""regret"" that things turned nasty. But that's not going to stop either of them from coming after each other inside the ring. Peterson already has prior experience with the matter when he faced fellow former NFL running back Le'Veon Bell back in 2022. Though he lost out on his first outing, maybe this time his luck has turned for him.Also Read: NFL legend Adrian Peterson signs Celebrity Boxing deal to fight poker rival in surprise ring battle","Nfl legend adrian peterson and professional poker player joe ""baby joe"" castaneda have signed for a celebrity boxing match.

Two-Way Deal Offers Antonio Reeves a Crucial Development Opportunity

A Smart Low-Cost Move as Hornets Continue Rebuild

Thehave officially signed guardto a two-way NBA contract, taking a calculated gamble on a promising young scorer. First reported by ESPN’s Shams Charania, the move gives Charlotte another offensive weapon as they continue reshaping their roster.Antonio Reeves, 24, was selected 47th overall in the 2024 NBA Draft by the New Orleans Pelicans . He appeared in 44 games during his rookie year, averaging 6.9 points, 1.4 rebounds, and about 15 minutes per contest. What stood out most was his shooting efficiency: 45.6% from the field, 39.5% from beyond the arc, and 80% at the free-throw line.The former Kentucky standout also lit up the G League with the Birmingham Squadron, averaging nearly 25 points per game while showcasing strong rebounding and efficient shooting splits. His performance in both leagues has solidified his reputation as a dependable perimeter scorer.Despite his upside, the Pelicans waived Antonio Reeves earlier this offseason before his 2025-26 salary became guaranteed. Sources indicate the decision came from a new front office regime that had no direct ties to drafting him. That opened the door for the Hornets to swoop in and secure his services via a two-way deal.To make room, Charlotte is expected to release either KJ Simpson or Damion Baugh, with Baugh reportedly more likely to be waived following recent roster moves.The Charlotte Hornets continue to prioritize shooting and guard depth as part of their long-term rebuild. While some observers question adding another scoring guard to an already crowded backcourt, Antonio Reeves brings something valuable: elite catch-and-shoot potential. His near-40% three-point shooting aligns with Charlotte’s emphasis on spacing and perimeter offense.Given the franchise’s recent struggles, Reeves could emerge as a cost-effective scoring option, especially compared to past two-way signees. If his development continues, he may earn a more permanent NBA role sooner rather than later.Antonio Reeves’ collegiate success at Kentucky translated smoothly into professional play, and now the Hornets are betting on that trajectory continuing. While he’ll split time between the NBA and G League, Charlotte will likely explore ways to utilize his shooting spark off the bench.For Reeves, the two-way deal offers a fresh opportunity to prove himself, and for the Charlotte Hornets, it’s a low-risk move with considerable upside. As the 2025-26 season approaches, all eyes will be on how this talented young guard makes the most of his new environment.Also read: NBA Trade News: Detroit Pistons Nab Emerging $2.2 Million Oklahoma City Thunder Wing on Two-Way Contract To Perimeter Defense This signing also underscores how fluid NBA rosters can be in the offseason—and how two-way contracts continue to serve as vital pathways for rising talent to break into the league.

Why the Detroit Pistons Made the Move

What Colby Jones Brings to the Table

Theare continuing to build around young, versatile talent by signing guard/forwardto a two-way contract, per ESPN. At just 23, Jones arrives with momentum after a breakout second-half performance last season that showcased his growing value as a reliable two-way player.A 2023 second-round pick (34th overall), the 6-foot-6 Colby Jones entered the league as a do-it-all swingman with positional flexibility. His rookie season with the Sacramento Kings was quiet—averaging just 2.1 points across 30 appearances. But a midseason trade in 2024 to the Washington Wizards became the turning point.Limited to just 1.1 points per game in brief early-season stints with the Kings, Colby Jones found his rhythm in Washington. Over a 15-game stretch with the Wizards, he impressed by putting up 8.7 points, 4.3 rebounds, 2.5 assists, and 1.3 steals per game, shooting 46.6% from the field. More importantly, he looked the part of a dependable role player—defending on the perimeter, making smart passes, and hitting timely shots.The Detroit Pistons ’ ongoing rebuild has emphasized acquiring high-IQ, positionless players who can defend and develop within a team structure. Jones fits that mold perfectly. Detroit’s decision to bring him in on a two-way contract gives them the flexibility to test his potential in both the NBA and G League without taking up a full roster spot.His combination of length, defensive instincts, and improving offensive feel makes him a valuable depth piece with upside. If he continues trending upward, the Detroit Pistons can convert his deal into a standard contract.- Defensive Versatility: Colby Jones’ lateral quickness and anticipation have made him a consistent presence on the defensive end, notching 1.3 steals per game with Washington.- Rebounding Ability: Averaging 4.3 boards per game as a wing shows his willingness to mix it up and contribute in all facets.- Playmaking Support: He’s shown flashes of facilitating offense, especially in transition and pick-and-roll scenarios, averaging 2.5 assists during his Wizards run.- Improved Efficiency: His 46.6% field-goal percentage and flashes of perimeter scoring (though his career 3PT mark remains low at .254) suggest progress.- Basketball IQ: Coaches praise his ability to read the game, stay within his role, and execute defensively.For the Detroit Pistons, Colby Jones is a low-risk, potentially high-reward addition. With limited pressure and an environment focused on player growth, Jones could carve out a bigger role than expected. He’s already shown he can adjust to different systems and contribute meaningfully.However, his inconsistency as a shooter and relatively modest offensive ceiling mean he’ll need to continue refining his game to stick long-term. His two-way status also limits his NBA availability unless the Detroit Pistons convert his contract.Also read: NBA Trade News: Phoenix Suns Reunite with $2.35 Million Los Angeles Lakers Star in Bold Waiver Steal to Bolster Championship Backcourt Still, Colby Jones brings the kind of competitive energy, intelligence, and versatility that rebuilding teams value. If he continues to build on last season’s momentum, Detroit may have landed a sneaky-good contributor for the future.","The detroit pistons signed guard/forward colby jones to a two-way contract.

Why Phoenix Jumped at the Chance

What Jordan Goodwin Brings to the Table

Thehave made a calculated move by claiming guardoff waivers, reuniting with the high-energy player they previously included in the 2023 Bradley Beal trade. It’s a savvy, low-cost acquisition that bolsters the team’s defensive depth and adds familiarity to their evolving backcourt.Jordan Goodwin, the 26-year-old guard, has bounced between multiple teams over the last two seasons:- He began his NBA career with the Washington Wizards, later joined the Memphis Grizzlies, and landed in Phoenix in 2023 as part of the Beal deal.- Goodwin appeared in 40 games for the Phoenix Suns in the 2023-24 season before being traded to Memphis. He eventually signed a two-way deal with the Lakers in early 2025, which was later converted to a standard contract.- With the Lakers, he logged 29 appearances, averaging 5.6 points, 3.9 rebounds, and 1.4 assists in just under 19 minutes per game. He also shot a respectable 43.8% from the field and 38.2% from three—solid efficiency for a role player.Jordan Goodwin’s release from Los Angeles wasn’t a reflection of his performance, but rather the cost of roster management:- After signing Marcus Smart with their bi-annual exception, the Lakers were forced to dip below the first salary cap apron, which required trimming non-guaranteed contracts.- As a result, both Goodwin and Shake Milton were waived, even though Goodwin was a reliable presence off the bench in JJ Redick’s rotation.- Attempts to restructure the roster via trade fell through, leaving Jordan Goodwin as a cap casualty.Bringing Goodwin back wasn’t just sentimental—it was strategic:- His tenacious defense and team-first mentality are exactly what the Phoenix Suns have prioritized this offseason.- With a retooled backcourt featuring Devin Booker, Jalen Green , and Dillon Brooks, Goodwin provides insurance and hard-nosed depth.- His contract is extremely team-friendly—$2.35 million with only $25,000 guaranteed until January 2026—allowing Phoenix flexibility and low-risk upside.- Elite hustle and perimeter defense, helping fill a void that’s long hampered the Phoenix Suns’ title aspirations.- Positional versatility, capable of switching between guard roles, disrupting opposing ball-handlers, and pushing the pace.- A blue-collar work ethic—diving for loose balls, fighting for rebounds, and never taking possessions off—that coaches and teammates consistently praise.Jordan Goodwin’s NBA story isn’t flashy—but it’s exactly what championship rosters need. In a league dominated by superstars, he stands out as a throwback grinder: underappreciated, undervalued, and always ready. His $25K guarantee until January adds drama: every game is a chance to earn a full-season role.Fans in Phoenix who value heart and hustle over highlights may find a new favorite in Goodwin. He won’t be the face of the franchise, but he just might be the glue.Also read: Jalen Green Breaks Silence on Houston Rockets - Phoenix Suns Trade: “I Get It, Bro” For the Phoenix Suns, this is more than a waiver wire pickup—it’s a culture play.
