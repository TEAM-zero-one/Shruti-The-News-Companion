NEW DELHI: Drama erupted in the third over of the Sunrisers Hyderabad–Mumbai Indians IPL clash when Ishan Kishan ’s dismissal triggered an unusual chain of events and a flood of online reaction.Facing Deepak Chahar , Kishan appeared to feather a leg‑side delivery to wicketkeeper Ryan Rickelton.The on‑field umpire hesitated, then raised the finger.Kishan did not consult with his partner; convinced he was out, he walked. Mumbai offered only a muted appeal, yet the umpire’s decision stood.Moments later, the replay package told a different story: Snicko registered no spike, suggesting there was no contact between bat and ball. Social media lit up.Former India batter Navjot Singh Sidhu wrote, “Buying trouble is as easy as pie, but the carrying charges are high—ever seen an umpire give one without an appeal?”Commentator Harsha Bhogle admitted the sequence left him “perplexed.”Kishan’s exit for one run left Sunrisers tottering at 9/2 after 2.1 overs, part of an early collapse that saw them slump to 35/5.Trent Boult (4/26) and Deepak Chahar (2/12) shared the damage before Heinrich Klaasen and Abhinav Manohar rescued the innings.Their 99‑run stand lifted SRH to 143 for eight, with Klaasen cracking 71 from 44 and Manohar 43 from 27. Klaasen’s dismissal gave Jasprit Bumrah his 300th wicket in senior T20 cricket.The match began with both teams wearing black armbands to honour victims of the Pahalgam terror attack.Mumbai captain Hardik Pandya chose to bowl after winning the toss, and Boult struck first by removing Travis Head for a duck. Abhishek Sharma, Nitish Kumar Reddy and Aniket Verma followed quickly.Klaasen counter‑punched, reaching fifty in 34 balls and accelerating in the final five overs, which yielded 53 runs.Boult cleaned up Pat Cummins with the last ball to close the innings.","Ishan kishan dismissed in third over of sunrisers hyderabad vs mumbai ipl clash.

Boston Bruins eye new additions and a defensive core around the rebuild

After a season full of poor form and health issues, and shocking key roster changes, the Boston Bruins made a pretty strong decision to hit reset. Jacobs, hopefully, in charge of the last-place party in the Atlantic Division, has given a future promise to this franchise, indicating a return to postseason contention by 2026. Much is expected from the coming offseason as the team executives prepare for retooling the lineup, a new head coach, and roster reinforcement. A very crucial rebuilding stage has commenced in Boston.The 2024-25 season was a disaster for the Bruins, with the lowest standings points percentage in almost two decades. In the first 20 games, the front office fired head coach Jim Montgomery before trading away franchise veterans like Brad Marchand, Charlie Coyle , and Brandon Carlo. The dust has now settled, and General Manager Don Sweeney made it clear- this was the first step in a focus on building a team meant to reclaim Boston's hard-nosed identity.Increased offensive production has become a dire need of the Bruins, especially on the wings; the team's final ranking in the number of goals scored per game placed them 28th in the league, despite David Pastrnak's remarkable performance with a total of 43 goals in the season. Defensive discipline has been a hallmark of Bruins hockey, but this, too, did not seem quite right, with goaltenders Jeremy Swayman and Joonas Korpisalo both underperforming.Health will be a major factor in this charge. Most of the rhythm of the entire team was affected throughout the season because of the injured critical defensemen, Charlie McAvoy and Hampus Lindholm. Sweeney and President Cam Neely contemplate that a healthy core combined with offseason additions could see the team return to considerable prominence very quickly.The uncertainty regarding the coaching future in Boston is almost a given. The interim coach, Joe Sacco, has a rather dismal record of 25 wins, 30 losses, and seven overtime losses; he will be one of the candidates strongly considered while a full search is being conducted for the best possible candidate to lead this transformation. All of Jacobs, Sweeney, and Neely know that most of the definition of this summer's pathway for the Bruins will be their actions.Also Read: ""We had a 15-minute talk"": Panthers’ A.J.

Vegas Golden Knights have done an excellent job of highlighting how they don’t take penalties - Elliotte Friedman calls this job genius marketing

First Weekend Of Stanley Cup Playoffs | 32 Thoughts

Vegas Golden Knights got the benefit of the doubt where other teams didn’t get, says Elliotte Friedman

Elliotte Friedman, NHL Insider, puts it out there for the world to understand on his 32 Thoughts podcast show. What did he say? Elliotte Friedman called Game 1 of the First Round of the 2025 Stanley Cup Playoffs between the Vegas Golden Knights and Minnesota Wild a mean, nasty, and Vegas game. In his exact words, “This was a mean game. It was a nasty game. It was a Vegas game. They defend really well.” Why was that? Because “On a night, where there was a lot of discussion about cross-checks - there was one in this game that went uncalled to Nic(Nicolas) Hague.”TSN shared footage on their X platform of a cross-check that went unnoticed and was not penalized. An X user commented, “As well they should be … ref looking right at the play! The difference in the standard for penalty calls between this game & the Toronto game was night & day!! Hard not to believe the fix is in for Vegas & Toronto!” Another said, “Wilds frustration is understandable.” One fan wrote, “Cross-checking seems increasingly overlooked by officials.”The NHL referees are outright biased toward the top contenders of the 2025 Stanley Cup Playoffs - Vegas Golden Knights and Toronto Maple Leafs. We’re not saying that - the viewers and the fans are noticing that! However, there’s a genius strategy behind all this. Genius marketing strategy applied by the Vegas Golden Knights. NHL Insider Elliotte Friedman noticed it and spoke about it on his 32 Thoughts podcast show.Elliotte Friedman shared on the 32 Thoughts podcast show, “Vegas has done an excellent job of highlighting how they don’t take penalties, last three years - least penalized team in the league. This year, they put it up on their social that they’ve set a record for the fewest penalties taken.Sometimes you get reputations for being a dirty team, sometimes you get reputations for being a penalized team. Sometimes you get reputations for a team that dives or players who dive.When they(the Vegas Golden Knights) didn’t get a penalty for that cross-check we were talking about, does Vegas get the benefit of the doubt because they are clean? I’m curious about that.”Elliotte Friedman continued, “Because you know, in between these series, teams lobby. They lobby. When they’re going to go to Vegas after between Games 1 and 2, they’re going to say, ‘Anything you guys wanna talk about?’They’re gonna go to Minnesota between Games 1 and 2, and they’re gonna say, ‘Anything you guys wanna talk about?’ and you know Minnesota is gonna talk about, ‘How on earth does that cross-check not get called?’I just think it might be genius marketing by the Golden Knights, just like, hey, we don’t take penalties. We’re putting up on our social(media account) how our records say - we’re not taking penalties.”Elliotte Friedman said he wondered if it(Vegas Golden Knights being the least penalized team) got into people’s heads, and they got the benefit of the doubt where other teams didn’t get. Friedman concluded the cross-check discussion by saying, “And you know what, they(Vegas Golden Knights) have earned it, and now, they’re making sure everybody knows it.”Vegas Golden Knights head coach Bruce Cassidy shared with NHL.com on April 22, ""Competitiveness is always first. The most important element of puck management is one of our most important elements of how it gets away from us. Competitiveness, winning your races and battles, is always at the top of the list for me. It won't be any different.""","Elliotte friedman, nhl insider, called game 1 of the first round of the 2025 stanley cup playoffs between the vegas golden knights and minnesota wild a mean, nasty, and vegas game.

The Boston Celtics played the Orlando Magic in Game 1 of the 2025 NBA Playoffs series. They beat the Magic 103-86. However, what caught fans’ attention was Jaylen Brown ’s idiotic statement about the Magic during a mic’d-up moment. Brown contributed satisfactorily to the team’s success, but has yet to reach last year’s NBA Finals MVP performance.Fans could not keep calm when Jaylen Brown tried to make a joke at the Orlando Magic. His joke fell flat and drew criticism as it actually made no sense. During a mic’d-up moment, he indulged in trash talk against the Orlando Magic, trying to make a nonsensical comparison. He said:“I told you. I think I will be playing with energy. They the Magic but they know who really got the magic over here, no Harry Potter.”No one could really make any sense of the statement made. When the statement was tweeted, the fans on the internet could not help but put this trash talk in the same league as Jayson Tatum’s, who is often ridiculed for his poorly crafted statements.Check a few of the interesting reactions from fans here:“Him and Jayson should never open their mouths,” - a fan suggested.“Stay in school, kids,” commented another fan.“Dumbest quote I’ve ever heard,” another fan expressed.“Magic in 5 after they read this” - was another commentJaylen Brown’s attempt at making an intended pun fellThe Boston Celtics beat the Orlando Magic 103-86 in Game 1. Payton Pritchard’s 19 points in about 25 minutes of play kept the Celtics' momentum high. His brilliant offense earned him his career playoff high numbers. Pritchard took the command, giving starters some time to rest, and that set the tone for the ensuing Celtics win as well.Derrick White broke the Magic’s defense and boosted the team’s offensive front. He scored the highest 30 points, which featured his hitting seven points off 12 three-point attempts.Jaylen Brown played for about 30 minutes, during which he contributed 16 points. His performance also featured two steals, two assists, and five rebounds. Was he at his best? Certainly not! He struggled converting shooting attempts to goals and could score only six from the 14 field goal attempts.Brown’s statement hit differently owing to his image of being an intelligent player, his educational background, and the responsible positions he holds.

Pat Cummins-led Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) will take on Hardik Pandya 's Mumbai Indians in match no 41 of the Indian Premier League (IPL) at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Hyderabad on Wednesday.With only two wins in seven outings, Pat Cummins ’ side is under immense pressure to turn things around. Their campaign has been riddled with inconsistency, especially in the batting department which, despite boasting of explosive names, has flattered to deceive. The bowling unit too has lacked bite, and the combination of both has left SRH languishing in the bottom half of the table.On the other hand, the Mumbai Indians arrive in Hyderabad riding high on momentum. After a shaky start to the season, the five-time champions have bounced back emphatically with three consecutive wins, the latest being a dominant nine-wicket victory over Chennai Super Kings. Chasing 180 on a flat surface, MI romped home with more than four overs to spare — a statement win that underlined their return to form.The pitch at Hyderabad is likely to be a belter. There have been four scores of 240-plus this season in eight innings so far, so expect a lot of runs.

Travis Kelce’s competitive nature may be keeping him out of the spotlight

Taylor Swift’s loyalty might have lead her to skip major events too

In recent weeks, fans of both Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift have noticed their conspicuous absence from high-profile events like Coachella and various award shows. While the internet buzzed with speculation, a new theory has emerged — could Kelce’s lingering guilt from the Kansas City Chiefs ’ devastating loss in Super Bowl LIX be the real reason behind their low profile?Known for his fierce competitiveness and larger-than-life personality, Travis Kelce is no stranger to pressure. But after a crushing defeat in Super Bowl LIX, where the Chiefs fell short in a heart-wrenching overtime loss, sources close to the NFL star suggest he hasn’t quite shaken off the emotional weight.Despite putting on a brave face during post-game interviews, insiders reveal that Travis Kelce has been especially withdrawn since the loss. This self-imposed hiatus from the public eye could be a result of his personal disappointment and a desire to avoid media scrutiny.As Travis Kelce grapples with the aftermath, Taylor Swift has reportedly chosen to stay by his side rather than attend solo appearances. Her absence from Coachella — a festival she’s often rumored to attend — and notable award ceremonies has only fueled speculation.Swift, is known for fiercely protecting those she loves.

Poll How important is communication between players and the cricket board? Not important at all Somewhat important Extremely important

NEW DELHI: Former fast bowler Mohammad Amir has revealed that he felt sidelined and ignored by the "" Pakistan cricket setup"" following the 2024 T20 World Cup , attributing the lack of communication from the board as the key reason behind his retirement late last year. Amir, along with Imad Wasim , had come out of retirement to participate in the 2024 T20 World Cup, where Pakistan’s disappointing campaign saw them crash out before the Super Eight stage.The duo announced their retirements on consecutive days in December.Speaking on a TV channel, Amir said, ""I felt sidelined and ignored by the Pakistan cricket setup after the T20 World Cup. After the T20 World Cup ended, no one even talked to me. No one told me if I was part of the future plans.""He added, ""A wise person understands the signs - if you're not in the plans, then you have to think about yourself. That's exactly what I did. I've made up my mind now - thank you very much, international cricket.""Amir had previously retired from international cricket in December 2020, citing issues with then-coaches Misbah-ul-Haq and Waqar Younis.He also disclosed that he had turned down a County contract after being asked by the PCB to represent Pakistan at the World Cup in the Americas.""Honestly speaking, I ended up spending more money than I made. I travelled with my trainer, and all those expenses came out of my own pocket. But that's a different matter,"" Amir said.On the game itself, Amir advocated for an aggressive mindset in cricket.""Cricket used to be fierce. Being mentally aggressive is part of the game's beauty. It's not about disrespect - it's about shifting the batter's focus. Off the field, we all hang out and joke around,"" he shared.The 33-year-old also threw his support behind Babar Azam , expressing confidence that Pakistan’s star batter will bounce back, while also pointing out technical flaws in his game.","Mohammad amir has revealed that he felt sidelined and ignored by the pakistan cricket setup.

NEW DELHI: Drama galore unfolded during the IPL 2025 clash between Sunrisers Hyderabad and Mumbai Indians at the Rajiv Gandhi International Stadium in Hyderabad — and it all happened in a single delivery. The moment came in the third over of the match, when Ishan Kishan appeared to get a faint tickle down the leg side off Deepak Chahar ’s delivery.The on-field umpire initially signaled it as a wide.However, Kishan didn’t wait for the official decision. Acknowledging what he believed to be an edge, he walked off on his own — a gesture that took everyone by surprise.Adding another twist, when Mumbai Indians players made a polite appeal for a catch, the umpire went on to raise his finger and officially gave Kishan out.But the drama didn’t end there.Replays showed no spike on the Snicko meter, casting doubt on whether there was any contact between bat and ball at all.Regardless, Kishan was dismissed for just 1 run, and Sunrisers Hyderabad suffered an early blow — in the most theatrical fashion possible.Earlier, Mumbai Indians skipper Hardik Pandya won the toss and elected to bowl against Sunrisers Hyderabad.Mumbai Indians have brought in Vignesh Puthur in place of Ashwani Kumar, while home team skipper Pat Cummins too made one change to his playing XI by bringing in Jaydev Unadkat in place of Mohammed Shami, who is among their impact substitutes.Players of both the teams will wear black armbands to pay respect to the victims of the terror attack in Pahalgam on Tuesday.""I would like to firstly pass my condolences to the victims of the terrorist attack.

Why Charles Barkley considers Stanley Cup the ultimate sports trophy



Charles Barkley on Contract Exit & Stephen A's Presidential Run

Why Stanley Cup is most respected trophy in sports



During a recent NBA on TNT broadcast, Charles Barkley didn't mince words when he spoke about the NHL ’s Stanley Cup trophy , delivering a passionate endorsement that caught the attention of fans across sports. With his signature mix of humor and respect, Barkley made a bold statement that the Stanley Cup stands as the pinnacle of sporting trophies, and he wasn't shy about making his case in front of his NBA colleagues.Barkley’s argument focused on the uniqueness of the Stanley Cup. Unlike any other major sports trophy, this iconic piece of silverware includes the names of every player, coach, and executive from winning teams dating back to 1893. It’s this element of tradition and recognition that Barkley highlighted as making the Cup special. “The greatest trophy in sports is in the house, y'all,” Barkley declared, standing beside Shaquille O'Neal, Ernie Johnson, and Kenny Smith. “Everybody’s name is on there. Whoever won the Stanley Cup… all those names on the bottom—the NBA doesn’t do that.”The idea of seeing the names of all champions engraved onto the trophy over the course of more than a century of hockey history fascinated Barkley. ""That’s amazing, that’s crazy, man,"" he said, referring to the long list of winners etched onto the Cup. It’s this growing legacy that adds weight to the Stanley Cup's mystique, making it a living piece of sports history that evolves every year.For Barkley, the physical presence of the Stanley Cup itself is enough to make it stand out from the rest. Unlike the NBA’s Larry O’Brien Trophy, the Stanley Cup is the only one of its kind, passed from champion to champion each season, adding new names to its rings. In contrast, other major sports trophies are replicated year after year, losing the personalized connection that makes the Cup so unique.What sets the Stanley Cup apart is also its grueling path to victory. NHL players face a demanding 82-game regular season followed by four rounds of intense playoff hockey. To claim the Cup, teams must endure one of the most physically taxing postseason schedules in all of sports. It's a combination of history, physicality, and tradition that has given the Stanley Cup its unmatched reputation.Also Read: “A goal is a goal”: Alex Ovechkin marks first overtime playoff goal with a reminder As Barkley has made clear, while he may not be touching the Stanley Cup anytime soon, he recognizes its place as the most revered and enduring championship trophy in all of sports. Whether you’re a hockey fan or not, Barkley’s appreciation for this iconic trophy certainly adds a new level of respect for the storied history of the Stanley Cup.","Charles barkley calls the stanley cup the greatest prize in all of sports.

Who doesn’t support women going shoulder to shoulder with men in sports? Well, there are a few exceptions—like sports columnist Jason Whitlock. He recently voiced his frustration over the presence of female commentators during NBA matches. And before critics could call him out for his conservative stance, he took matters into his own hands, branding himself as a “sexist pig” and “one of the worst people on the planet” on his show, Fearless with Jason Whitlock.On his show, Jason Whitlock vented specifically about ESPN's female commentators. He was particularly irritated during the Cleveland Cavaliers vs. Miami Heat playoff match, saying, “The Cavaliers were playing the Miami Heat and Candace Parker was squawking in my ear and I’m just like what are we doing here? Half the NBA playoffs, I got women describing the game for me.”Doubling down on his complaints, he added, “Every time I turn on ESPN there’s always a female co-host. A lot of times there’s two female co-hosts. Then I turn on the games for men and there’s women. And then when I turn on women’s sports over there, it’s just all women. The women can all do women’s sports but men have been somewhat outlawed [from] men’s sports.”“I know I’m a sexist pig, I know I’m one of the worst people on the planet but it just annoyed me,” he said, defensively labeling himself before the internet could respond with its own judgment.Candace Parker, the commentator Whitlock mentioned, is part of TNT’s NBA broadcast team. A former basketball player, Parker is widely considered one of the greatest WNBA athletes of all time. She played for the Los Angeles Sparks before retiring in 2024 and transitioning into sports commentary.Also Read: Cameron Brink picks her best dressed at the WNBA draft—and It’s not Paige Bueckers Looking ahead, the 2025 WNBA season will begin with pre-season games in May.

A swath S, 16, has taken a giant step towards becoming a GM. Playing as the 38th seed, he won the Grenke Open chess tournament in Karlsruhe, Germany, with a score of 8/9. He made his maiden GM norm and also touched a live rating of Elo 2500.It’s the same festival in which Carlsen reigned supreme in the Freestyle Open with 9/9. Aswath (Elo 2466), another prodigy from the Tamil Nadu stable, scored seven wins — the most impressive of them coming in the last round against Muradil Mohammed of Azerbaijan with black pieces in 69 moves of rook and pawns endgame. He also beat Brandon Jacobson of USA, who also tallied 8/9, along the way.Aswath won the top prize of 20,000 euros — more than Rs 17 lakh after taxes. The teenager defeated three GMs (above Elo 2500) in the meet and drew with third seed Croatian Ivan Saric (2659). There were about 10 players above Elo 2600 in the tournament. Aswath played nine different openings at Grenke and castled in each game.He won another tournament in France a few days ago as the fourth seed with 7.5/9. His coach for two years, Shyam Sundar, had played this event in 2019. Back then, there were 20 players above Elo 2600 in the field. In both editions, there were 800-plus players making it a total of nine rounds - far less than required for correct final standings in such a big field.Sundar said Aswath had made tremendous progress in past two years. The progress could be seen in the results too, as he has added about 250 Elo points in the last 24 months. “It’s a huge achievement and I am super happy for him,” said Sundar. “He is a hard-working kid and a confident person. He has the ability to bounce back and fight in any situation.”","Aswath (elo 2466) won the grenke open chess tournament in karlsruhe, germany.

Ian Machado Garry praises Islam Makhachev while analyzing current state of the welterweight division

IAN GARRY on ISLAM MAKHACHEV and 'Quitter' CARLOS PRATES!

’s talk of moving up to thedivision has created new waves of speculation amongst the welterweight top contenders of the UFC. The news came amidst the recent callout for a lightweight title bout by Ilia Topuria, following the fighter’s move up from featherweight to lightweight. Ahead of the highly anticipated bout at UFC Kansas City scheduled for April 26, 2025,Ian Machado Garry talked about La Leyenda’s possible shift from lightweight to the welterweight division.With an MMA stat of 15-1-0, Ian Machado Garry has established himself as one of the top fighters out there for a title run in the welterweight division. The fighter's first-ever career loss came from Shavkat Rakhmonov by a unanimous decision. The Future is now in a position to redeem himself and put himself back on the line for a title bout with the upcoming UFC Kansas City fight on April 26.On the contrary, the lightweight division of the promotion has witnessed the addition of Ilia Topuria after he vacated the featherweight title in February 2025. The division is on the verge of witnessing another major shakeup with Islam Makhachev dodging Topuria’s callout for a title bout and instead expressing his desire to move up to the welterweight division.In a recent interview with SHAK MMA, Garry was asked about these recent transitions and his opinion on the current state of the welterweight division, to which the fighter seemed positive about the upcoming shakeups.“It’s finally f*cking moving again. It’s finally moving. We are getting like out with old and in with the new. We are getting rid of these people who are just trying to stay relevant. Like Kamaru and Colby, who are just trying to maintain their relevancy by talking on podcasts and trying to slag of Paddy Pimblett. That’s all they are now, they don’t want to fight. They are not fighters anymore.”Garry went on to mention the names of the young fighters of the division who are willing to put up a fierce show inside the Octagon and who will be staying around for quite a while now.“You have got people like Leon and I f*cking hate to say this but Gilbert, who haven’t had the best run lately. And you have got these young hungry killers coming up in the likes of me, Prates, Morales, Sean Brady, Shavkat, Jack and you are just seeing what the welterweight division is turning into for the next decade. Because these guys are going to be around for a long time.”The fighter even, went on to express his thoughts on Makhachev’s possible move up to the division, “He can jump the queue if he wants to, he’s Islam Makhachev, he’s the pound-for-pound number one. You’ve gotta give respect when respect is due. And if that man turns up and says ‘I want to be next’, I think everyone in the welterweight division gives the ‘OK’. And I think if you try to argue that, you don’t have respect for the greatest in the world.” Garry further added, “I think he’s an absolute disaster for everyone in the division if he comes up and doesn’t have to cut weight…he’s the perfect example of the new evolution of fighters, great everywhere. You look at Khabib, and Khabib was dominant at grappling. Islam is the exact same, but probably more clean when it comes to his grappling…and when you look at Islam on the feet, he can crack. I think he makes the welterweight division even more fun, and I would love to test myself against him.”Also read: Former UFC flyweight prospect sentenced to 15 years and 5 months in jail after pleading guilty to firearms and drug trafficking accusations The UFC has kept the fans of the sport on the edge with Makhachev’s and Topuria’s respective bouts yet to be announced.
