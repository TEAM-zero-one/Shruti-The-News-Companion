Wayne Gretzky once turned down $1 million from Rangers owner James Dolan to delay retirement by just one week,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/wayne-gretzky-once-turned-down-1-million-from-rangers-owner-james-dolan-to-delay-retirement-by-just-one-week/articleshow/122280139.cms,"New York Rangers owner James Dolan made an extraordinary offer to Wayne Gretzky (Getty Images)

Dolan ’s million-dollar offer was about more than money

Wayne Gretzky: I wish I could still play

Wayne Gretzky said no, prioritizing integrity over payday

When Wayne Gretzky decided to retire in April 1999, the NHL lost more than just a player—it marked the exit of a once-in-a-lifetime icon. But what many don’t know is that just 24 hours before “The Great One” made his final decision, New York Rangers owner James Dolan made an astonishing last-minute attempt to keep him in the game—with a $1 million offer, simply to reconsider.According to Gretzky himself, Dolan approached him with an incredible proposition: $1 million just to delay his retirement announcement by one week. “There were no strings attached,” Gretzky recalled. “If Gretzky still wanted to retire after those seven days, the money was still his to keep.” The offer, unlike anything seen in pro sports before, wasn’t about performance—it was about giving a legend more time to reflect on a career-altering decision.It wasn’t a contract extension, nor a marketing ploy. Dolan's offer was purely a gesture of respect. He knew the kind of legacy Gretzky carried—not just as a player but as the face of an entire generation of hockey fans. Dolan had only recently taken control of the Rangers but understood instantly that Gretzky was no ordinary star.Despite the tempting offer, Gretzky turned Dolan down. “In good conscience, I just can’t take your money.Because I know I’m done,” he told the owner. In a 2016 interview with Graham Bensinger, Gretzky joked, “It was the dumbest thing I’ve ever done, right? But that’s just how classy their organization was.”The decision proved Gretzky’s legendary discipline wasn’t just on the ice. He wasn’t going to cash in if his heart was no longer in the game. Gretzky’s final game at Madison Square Garden became a celebration. His unmatched records—894 goals, 1,963 assists, 2,857 total points—remain sacred ground in NHL history.Also Read: Wayne Gretzky threatened to cancel daughter’s wedding over Dustin Johnson’s drug abuse scandal Even though he turned down Dolan’s $1 million, that story stands as proof of the deep respect he inspired and the class with which he exited the game.","New york rangers owner james dolan made an extraordinary offer to wayne gretzky.

Dallas Cowboys ’ $18 million bet on KaVontae Turpin faces backlash and uncertainty after All-Pro returner’s shocking holiday weekend arrest

KaVontae Turpin arrest casts doubt on Dallas Cowboys offensive plans and special teams strategy

Dallas Cowboys weigh consequences as KaVontae Turpin’s arrest threatens team stability

Just four months after the Dallas Cowboys made KaVontae Turpin the highest-paid special teams player in NFL history, their $18 million commitment is suddenly clouded by scandal. Early Sunday morning, on July 6, Turpin was arrested in Allen, Texas, for misdemeanor marijuana possession and unlawfully carrying a weapon, according to Collin County court records reviewed by CBS News Texas. The arrest has sparked a firestorm of fan backlash and raised serious questions about whether Turpin—who overcame years of setbacks to become an All-Pro—can be trusted to stay on the field. For a team desperate to break through in the playoffs, this is the kind of offseason chaos no one wanted.KaVontae Turpin’s arrest unfolded during the long holiday weekend, when NFL coaches famously brace for late-night calls. On Monday morning, Cowboys offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer confirmed what fans feared: “During the slow time, NFL coaches dread that phone call,” he said. “And now I’ve gotten exactly that.”According to court records, Turpin was booked and released on separate bonds of $500 for the marijuana charge and $1,000 for unlawfully carrying a weapon. Though marijuana violations no longer guarantee suspensions under NFL rules, they typically lead to enhanced testing and fines. The weapons charge could invite further discipline, adding to the sense of uncertainty swirling around the Cowboys’ offseason plans.As news of the arrest broke, one fan summed up the collective groan with a biting tweet:“Cowboys already takin L’s. Yes sir.”The timing couldn’t be worse. Dallas just cleared over $50 million in cap space ahead of free agency, then handed Turpin a three-year deal worth $6 million per season—an unprecedented figure for a returner. The front office hoped the contract would finally unlock a bigger offensive role for Turpin, who exploded last season with 904 kick return yards, 420 receiving yards, and three total touchdowns.KaVontae Turpin’s contract all but confirms the Cowboys will use him more on offense, multiple reports agreed when the deal was announced. The plan was to line him up alongside CeeDee Lamb, especially after Brandin Cooks missed seven games and Jalen Tolbert struggled with consistency.Some fans weren’t so forgiving of Turpin’s latest misstep. One tweet captured the frustration and expectation of consequences:“You dumb a**! No doubt will be suspended.”KaVontae Turpin’s off-field trouble isn’t new. He went undrafted in 2019 out of TCU because of prior issues, then rebuilt his career through The Spring League, the European League of Football, and the USFL—where he was named MVP. His hard-fought comeback peaked with a Pro Bowl rookie season in 2022.But for all the optimism surrounding his new deal, this arrest threatens to derail that narrative. As one cynical fan put it on social media:“Not a true Cowboys player until you’re arrested.”While no immediate roster moves have been announced, the Cowboys may now be forced to explore contingency plans. Free agent returners and depth receivers could be on the radar if league discipline sidelines Turpin.KaVontae Turpin’s story was supposed to be about redemption—a journey from undrafted outcast to Pro Bowl game-breaker. But Sunday’s arrest in Allen is a sobering reminder that talent alone doesn’t erase off-field risk. As the Cowboys weigh their next steps, fans are left wondering if this $18 million gamble will pay off—or become yet another cautionary tale.Also Read: ‘Worst RB room in the league’: Colin Cowherd rips Dallas Cowboys for passing on Saquon Barkley and Derrick Henry","Kavontae turpin was arrested for misdemeanor marijuana possession and unlawfully carrying a weapon.

Travis Kelce reportedly waiting until NFL retirement before making it official

Taylor Swift is staying quiet and laying low, focusing on recovery and personal growth

As speculation swirls around Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce’s relationship, one thing is becoming clear—wedding bells likely won’t be ringing just yet. While their connection appears strong and emotionally supportive, a new report reveals that Kelce is holding off on proposing, despite growing public interest and pressure.According to a source cited by the Daily Mail, fans hoping for a July 4th engagement were always going to be disappointed. “Travis isn't going to ask for her hand in marriage this weekend,” the insider revealed. “He is likely going to pop the question, but it is going to be when he isn't playing anymore and not getting ready for a big NFL season.”That timeline makes sense. Travis Kelce, still laser-focused on his professional football career, likely doesn’t want to juggle the demands of a wedding with training camp and game-day pressure. His devotion to Swift is undeniable, but so is his commitment to the Kansas City Chiefs.Taylor Swift has chosen a lower-profile approach following the conclusion of her Eras Tour and some challenging public moments, including being booed at the Super Bowl and her name surfacing in the legal drama involving friend Blake Lively. “Taylor has had quite the year,” the source noted.Swift is now taking time to reset—working on new music in private, spending quality time with Kelce and her family, and generally avoiding the limelight.“She is eager to celebrate and unwind, and she is going to have something go down party-wise with Travis, family and some good friends,” the insider added, speaking of her intimate July 4th plans.Their relationship may not be heading for the altar just yet, but insiders stress that Kelce remains an integral part of Swift’s life, especially during major personal victories.

What’s Next for the Boston Celtics?

Themay soon add another big man to their roster, with newly available centeremerging as a potential target. The Houston Rockets recently waived the 29-year-old Australian before his $8 million salary guarantee kicked in, making him an unrestricted free agent.With Boston’s frontcourt depth shrinking rapidly this offseason, Landale could be a low-cost, reliable option to fill the void. Boston Celtics ’ center rotation has taken multiple hits in recent weeks:- Kristaps Porzingis was traded to the Atlanta Hawks.- Luke Kornet signed a four-year deal with the San Antonio Spurs.- Al Horford is reportedly drawing interest from the Golden State Warriors and Los Angeles Lakers.That leaves the Boston Celtics with only three true centers under contract:1. Neemias Queta2. Xavier Tillman3. Newly signed Luka GarzaWhile Josh Minott adds depth, he doesn’t provide the size Boston desperately needs. As MassLive’s Brian Robb noted, ""Boston’s frontcourt is very undermanned right now,"" suggesting another veteran addition is likely.Jock Landale, a Saint Mary’s product and Olympic bronze medalist, had a limited role in Houston last season but brings valuable experience. Here’s a quick breakdown of his 2024-25 stats:While not a star, Landale offers:- Size and physicality – At 6’11”, he can provide much-needed rim presence.- Championship experience – Played a key role in Australia’s Olympic run.- Affordability – Likely available at a minimum or low-cost deal.Boston currently has 15 players under contract, including non-guaranteed deals, leaving some flexibility. If Horford departs, expect Brad Stevens to act quickly.Landale isn’t a game-changer, but he’s a steady, low-risk option for a team in need of frontcourt stability. With few proven centers left in free agency, this move could make sense for both sides.The Boston Celtics face a clear need for frontcourt depth, and Jock Landale presents a practical solution. While he won’t single-handedly transform the roster, his size, experience, and affordability make him a logical target. With Horford’s future uncertain and limited options available, Boston may not find a better low-cost backup.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Are the Los Angeles Lakers Trading LeBron James for Cooper Flagg?

While the Vegas Golden Knights made waves this offseason by acquiring Mitch Marner in a blockbuster sign-and-trade, the franchise is quietly working on another crucial piece of business—securing Jack Eichel’s future with the team.Jack Eichel, the star center who helped deliver Vegas its first Stanley Cup in 2023, officially became eligible for a contract extension on July 1. According to The Fourth Period’s David Pagnotta, negotiations are already underway. “Speaking of Vegas, the Golden Knights have started contract negotiations with Jack Eichel on an extension,” Pagnotta reported, signaling the team’s clear intention to lock down their franchise cornerstone before he hits free agency.The 28-year-old center is coming off a career-best season, notching a franchise-record 94 points in just 77 regular-season games. His elite two-way play, leadership, and postseason pedigree have made him one of the most important players on Vegas’s roster since arriving via trade from Buffalo in November 2021.Though Marner currently holds the title of highest-paid Golden Knight with a $12 million annual cap hit, Eichel’s new deal could surpass that, as noted by team insider Danny Webster.“Jack Eichel is now eligible for an 8-year contract extension to make him the highest-paid player in Golden Knights history,” Webster posted on July 1.Bringing in Marner was a major swing for Vegas, but retaining Eichel would send a message that the organization is not just chasing headlines—it’s building for long-term success. With Eichel set to become an unrestricted free agent in 2026, this extension window provides a vital opportunity for the Golden Knights to solidify their core before any uncertainty takes hold.Also Read: NHL Predictions: 3-time All-Star Ryan Suter likely to retire as market interest fades in offseason Eichel’s continued presence ensures that Vegas remains a serious Stanley Cup contender in the years to come.

A legacy with something to prove returns for a third try at DCC

Emotional fallout, a strained friendship, and a quiet comeback

Dayton Bramhall's journey with the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders has been anything but easy — and her story has become one of the most emotional arcs in Season 2 of Netflix's America’s Sweethearts: Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders. A third-time auditionee and daughter of longtime DCC associate choreographer Shelly Bramhall, Dayton came into the 2024 training camp with the weight of a legacy and the pressure to finally make the team. But after once again being cut, the young dancer made a decision that would redefine her identity beyond the DCC brand.Raised in McKinney, Texas, Dayton Bramhall has been immersed in the world of the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders her entire life. Her mother, Shelly, was part of the DCC class of 1989 and has served as a key figure on the staff for years. That connection, however, didn’t secure Dayton a spot. “None of us want you to make this team just because you have a history,” director Kelli Finglass told her bluntly. “You need to earn to make this team. ”Despite showing improvement and passion during her audition, Dayton struggled with memorizing choreography and keeping up with the precision and power expected at the elite level.“There’s one that just won’t stick in my body, but I’ll get it,” she said during training camp. Unfortunately, the veterans didn’t believe she was ready — and Finglass ultimately told her it would be a “disservice to have you make this team and the struggle be all year. ”While Dayton took the cut with grace, the decision left ripples in her personal life. Her mother Shelly admitted, “That was hard because we were friends. If anything, I wasn’t hurt by her not making it, I was way more hurt by Kelli and Judy.” Despite the tension, Dayton chose to tell her mom herself, showing maturity beyond her years.She returned in 2025 for another shot — but was cut again before training camp. In a heartfelt comment on TikTok, Dayton wrote, “I did EVERYTHING they asked of me and tried my absolute best to fit their mold. I’m not wanted there and I’m hoping this takes me to where I truly belong.”Also Read: Where is Armani Latimer now?

In the first half of the March 3 game against the Sacramento Kings, Kyrie Irving , the star guard for the Dallas Mavericks, tore his anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). On March 26, he had a successful surgery. Now, he recently addressed his recovery, tempering expectations about returning during the playoffs. He further said that he is currently solely focusing on getting recovered from the injury.Despite early reports that Kyrie Irving might return by January 2026, the Dallas Mavericks have been growing more optimistic about his development in recent weeks. Kyrie Irving, however, clarified that he is more concerned with his complete recovery than with any timetable.ESPN’s Shams Charania estimated that the icon might return somewhere in between December and after the NBA’s 2026 All-Star break in late February or early March. The general estimate for most returns from ACL tears is around a year from the initial injury, hence the March estimation.However, it wasn't until Kyrie Irving himself recently answered questions about it during a live stream. When asked about when he would return, he gave a straightforward response saying:“Don’t hold your breath on that… it doesn’t mean that I won’t be back, it’s that I don’t want to make any predictions on when I’m going to be back.I just want to be back 150,000% better. So I’m taking my time right now to really get healthy. I’m taking my time to really get my body right, get other portions of my body right, and really just enjoy the is recovery process. It’s not pretty. Yes, it’s a beautiful struggle but I go through the mental roller coaster ride every day, just wanting to be back out there. ”The 33-year-old further highlighted the mental and physical difficulties associated with recovery. He also referred to the process as a ""beautiful struggle” as he acknowledged the challenges of being sidelined while his teammates continue their playoff drive. On the other hand, the Dallas Mavericks think that their core is still competitive enough to compete in the Western Conference.Kyrie Irving, on the other hand, is only concerned with getting better for the time being. He was shooting more than 40 percent from three-point range and averaging 24.7 points, 4.8 rebounds, and 4.6 assists per game before the injury.
