Did Tom Brady just say the N-word live on air?

Tom Brady’s slip sparks reactions across social media





Tom Brady made an unfortunate mistake while calling the Dallas Cowboys vs. Philadelphia Eagles game on Sunday. It happened in the final minutes, when the tension of the NFC East clash had already gripped the stadium and viewers at home. While analyzing the sack on Jalen Hurts by Osa Odighizuwa, Brady stumbled over the name of Eagles lineman Landon Dickerson. The slip briefly created a moment of confusion before Brady immediately corrected himself and continued his commentary with calm professionalism.The seven-time Super Bowl champion is in his second season working in FOX’s lead booth with Kevin Burkhardt. In May 2022, FOX brought him in on a 10-year, 375 million dollar deal, making him the highest-paid sports commentator in history. The NFL initially placed certain limits on him due to his ownership stake with the Raiders, but this season those rules were “relaxed,” allowing him into production meetings and private player sessions that make the job more immersive.Tom Brady nearly had an unfortunate on-air slip-up while calling Sunday's game between the Dallas Cowboys and Philadelphia Eagles. As viewers replayed the moment, some wondered whether they had heard correctly. Brady was describing the sack when he said, ""Odighizuwa just blasted through Nicker,"" before swiftly adding, ""Excuse me, [Eagles guard] Landon Dickerson right there.""That instant was enough to light a match online. One viewer wrote, ""Sounds like Tom Brady said the infamous 'N' word,"" while another demanded, ""WHAT DID TOM BRADY JUST SAY?????"" Others quickly defended him, arguing it was nothing more than a verbal mix-up.One person clarified, ""He said 'Nicker-' as in Nickerson,"" and another noted how easy it is for a broadcaster to get tongue-tied during a live call, saying, ""He said nicker when going to say Landon Dickersons name he just got tongue tied yall blow everything outta proportion. ""Away from the chatter, Dallas Cowboys made a historic comeback, erasing a 21-point deficit in a dramatic 24-21 victory. Cowboys wideout George Pickens explained the turnaround, saying, ""I feel like the first half we were just a little bit sloppy, just shooting ourself in the foot."" Dak Prescott helped drive the rally, finishing with 354 passing yards and becoming the franchise’s all-time leader in fourth-quarter and overtime comebacks.For Tom Brady, the moment served as a reminder that live broadcasting demands precision. His legacy on the field is unquestioned, and that same credibility is what earned him the headset.Also Read: Nyier Daniels behind the bars as felony child cruelty and police evasion rock Georgia football program","Tom brady made an unfortunate mistake while calling the dallas cowboys vs. philadelphia eagles game on sunday.

Gisele Bündchen's shifting balance between support, career and self-fulfillment

Moving from high-stakes partnership to reinventing life on her own terms





In her March 2023 interview with Vanity Fair, supermodel Gisele Bündchen opened up about her 13-year marriage to former NFL quarterback Tom Brady, how their lives evolved, and what she discovered in the space that followed. While details of their split had played out in headlines, Bündchen offered fresh context and a more nuanced perspective.Gisele Bündchen admitted that the marriage was “like a death and a rebirth,” and described her own shift from supporting a partner’s career to rediscovering her personal dreams. Her reflections reveal not just a high-profile breakup, but a woman reclaiming her voice and defining success on her own terms.When Gisele Bündchen first met Tom Brady at age 26, she said she was, “so ready” for family and partnership. Traditionally one of the world’s highest-earning models, Bündchen gradually scaled back her runway work after 2015 to support the family life they were building..Gisele Bündchen describes relocating to Tampa without ever having lived there before, “When we moved to Tampa, I actually had never been there before.I just arrived and that was my life.” Yet despite her enormous success, much of the public narrative painted her as “against football” or overshadowed by Brady’s career, a portrayal she calls “very hurtful” and “the craziest thing I’ve ever heard.”Gisele Bündchen underscores that marriage didn’t unravel overnight. “That takes years to happen.” As she puts it, “Sometimes you grow together; sometimes you grow apart … When you love someone, you don’t put them in a jail and say, ‘You have to live this life.’ You set them free to be who they are..”Gisele Bündchen's message: supporting someone doesn’t mean losing yourself, and that truth became clearer to her as her kids grew and her dreams quietly changed..Today, Gisele Bündchen speaks of her next act in Costa Rica, building a home, raising her children, and exploring wellness and nature far from red carpets. She asserts, “I have my own dreams..”While Tom Brady continued his historic career, Bündchen’s focus shifted inward. She embraced spiritual practices, daily rituals, and the idea that success is not just professional acclaim but authenticity and fulfillment. She says the breakup felt like both a loss and a liberation, “I believed in fairy tales when I was a kid. I think it’s beautiful to believe in that.”..Gisele Bündchen's reflection on Brady is remarkably gracious. “Listen, I have always cheered for him, and I would continue forever … If there’s one person I want to be the happiest in the world, it’s him.”In doing so, Gisele Bündchen rejects reductive headlines and stereotypes, choosing instead to present a fuller picture of love, change and self-discovery. As she said, “What’s been said is one piece of a much bigger puzzle. It’s not so black and white.”In the end, this isn’t a story solely of one of fashion’s biggest icons, Gisele Bündchen stepping aside. It’s the story of a woman stepping forward, redefining when a chapter ends, a new one begins..Gisele Bündchen is back on the red carpet. The Brazilian supermodel made a rare event appearance at the Fashion Trust Arabia 2025 Awards Ceremony in Doha, Qatar, hosted over the weekend.Also Read: Gisele Bündchen’s post divorce evolution raises question: did Tom Brady underestimate what letting her go would cost him?","Supermodel gisele bündchen reflects on her marriage to tom brady, describing their split as a ""death and rebirth"" she details her shift from supporting his career to rediscovering her own dreams and personal fulfillment.

Kylie Kelce says Jason Kelce’s confidence ‘makes me mad’ after his viral podcast answer

Jason Kelce’s viral moments keep following the couple, and Kylie keeps talking about them

Kylie Kelce went viral this week after a simple question on her podcast turned into a marriage moment that fans can’t stop replaying. The former field hockey player tried a TikTok prank on her husband, retired Philadelphia Eagles center Jason Kelce, and his reaction didn’t just shut the prank down, it irritated her for a reason she didn’t bother hiding.The clip aired on the Nov. 20 episode of her podcast “Not Gonna Lie,” where Kylie tested a trend that usually puts partners on the defensive. Jason didn’t bite. And Kylie wasn’t thrilled that the confidence was completely genuine.Kylie called Jason during the taping and dropped the trend’s signature question: “Do you ever wish you were more athletic?”Jason didn’t hesitate. “Oh gosh, not really. I feel like I’m pretty athletic,” he said.Kylie kept the bit going, but Jason quickly realized he was on-air. Then he doubled down and answered again, this time even more direct.“I don’t know. I feel like sometimes I’m so athletic it’s a burden to carry. I wish that the expectation was lower, you know what I mean?”The call ended, and that’s when Kylie let the audience in on how she really felt.“He was just like, ‘No, I’m good. I’m really f**ing athletic.’* And he’s not lying, that’s the part that makes me mad,” she said on the show.“We’ve got to figure out how we’re going to knock him down a few notches. And I mean that in a loving way. Because that’s part of my job.”The frustration wasn’t real anger. It was the kind of irritation that comes from knowing the other person didn’t fall for the prank because the answer was too honest to mock.And that was the part she couldn’t get over.This prank wasn’t the first time Kylie dissected her husband’s behavior on the podcast. Earlier in the same episode, she roasted a “Smells Like Jason Kelce” candle and joked about fans needing her permission to even sniff it.She also recently reacted to Jason’s now-famous Speedo moment from his summer charity event. The former center stripped down to a patriotic swimsuit for the Eagles Autism Foundation, something Kylie admitted she did not enjoy watching online later.“I did not like that you just [were like], ‘Hey world, here’s my t-int.’ It’s mine,” she said, keeping the same deadpan delivery fans love from her.Jason had told his brother Travis Kelce on “New Heights” that he needed a wax before the Speedo reveal and described being told to “assume the butterfly position.”“I am filleted open,” he joked.Between viral stunts, parenting four kids, and two wildly successful podcasts, Jason and Kylie have become one of football’s most-watched couples, and Kylie’s honesty about all of it is why clips like this one explode instantly.","Kylie kelce says jason kelce’s confidence ‘makes me mad’ after his viral podcast answer.

Giannis' Impact on the Milwaukee Bucks’ Recent Performance

Milwaukee Bucks vs Portland Trail Blazers Game Details (November 24, 2025)

as the team prepares to face the Portland Trail Blazers. The two-time MVP continues to recover from a left adductor strain, an injury that has forced him to miss multiple games and is expected to keep him sidelined for at least one to two weeks. His absence comes at a time when the Bucks are desperate to regain momentum after a shaky run of performances.The situation has placed added pressure on Milwaukee’s supporting cast, who now face the challenge of competing without their most dominant scorer, rebounder, and playmaker. With the season still in an early but crucial phase, each missed game carries extra weight, especially when the team is already battling inconsistency.Giannis Antetokounmpo suffered a low-grade strain in his left groin, specifically involving the adductor muscle group responsible for balance, lateral movement, and driving force. The injury occurred earlier in the season and has already ruled him out of several games. The Milwaukee Bucks’ medical staff is moving cautiously, prioritizing long-term durability over a quick return, especially given how easily groin strains can worsen if not fully healed.The injury has also kept him out of recent matchups, including losses to the Detroit Pistons and the Philadelphia 76ers. Milwaukee has emphasized careful load management in hopes of avoiding setbacks, signaling that Giannis will only return once he is medically cleared and pain-free.Without their superstar, the Milwaukee Bucks have struggled on both ends of the floor. Milwaukee currently sits at 8-9, a reflection of the challenges they’ve faced adjusting without Giannis Antetokounmpo’s 31.2 points, 10.8 rebounds, and 6.8 assists per game. The absence of his interior scoring and defensive presence has been evident, especially in the 129-116 loss to Detroit and the overtime defeat against Philadelphia.Role players like Ryan Rollins and Bobby Portis have stepped up in extended minutes, but the production gap remains significant. The team continues to search for a reliable offensive rhythm, while defensive lapses have kept them from closing out tight games.Tonight’s game against the Trail Blazers, set for an 8:00 PM ET tip-off, presents another challenge. Portland is dealing with its own injury issues but still enters the matchup with momentum after edging out Golden State. For Milwaukee, this game is an opportunity to halt their losing streak and regain stability while their franchise cornerstone remains unavailable.","Giannis antetokounmpo will miss tonight's game against the portland trail blazers due to a left adductor strain.

Jake Paul has responded to the doubts that have emerged about his proposed fight with Anthony Joshua in December He insists the fight is real, and says the scepticism is just driving him on.The American content creator-turned-fighter feels such disparagement will vanish with the ringing of the bell, and insists hitting Joshua would mute the naysayers 'saying this fight could never happen.' He went on to say the skepticism surrounding the fight only helps make it interesting, and that he welcomes the pressure as he embarks on a career among the elite.Speculation hit a peak when fellow, young and brash, welterweight Ryan Garcia suggested the fight ""doesn't make sense"" because of Joshua's size and experience advantage. His response was blunt, pushing back hard against Garcia's recent credentials as a high-level judge of high-level boxing situations, and lecturing fans to consider facts only. He insisted the bout is set as a pro heavyweight fight, not an exhibition, and that he is training for it as the hardest test of his life.One of the main points of discussion is the weight cap he has to adhere to which will see Joshua capped at 245 pounds, a seldom applied restriction for a heavyweight of his kind.The regulation is meant to narrow the distance between the two fighters on foot, and has been embraced by some sections and faces backlash in others. It will be for eight three-minute rounds under traditional pro rules (including knockouts), and will be permanently recorded on the professional records of both fighters.However, observers are warning Joshua, an Olympic gold medallist and former unified world champion, could find his reputation in a heap of trouble if he has any losses. Paul is not the boxer Joshua is, but his upward trajectory has transformed a fight that many initially dismissed as a gimmick into one that people are genuinely interested in seeing. Many insiders now believe that the bout could carry far greater long-term consequences for both men than originally expected.Also Read: Saudi boxing chief makes tense Jake Paul statement moments after Anthony Joshua fight update","Jake paul and anthony joshua are set to fight in december.

Shedeur Sanders’ mother Pilar and sister Shelomi dress up as his biggest fans from the NFL crowd

More coverage on Shedeur Sanders:

In August, when Cleveland Browns quarterback Shedeur Sanders’ mother, Pilar Sanders, arrived at her son’s first NFL (preseason) game in a crop top and cargo pants, she instantly became the center of a social media storm. Critics unleashed a wave of harsh comments like, “Mom look like she in her 20s man” and “I would be embarrassed if my 60 year old mom was conducted herself like that,” as well as “Very inappropriate be a mom not a groupie” and “Looks like she’s auditioning for an X-rated movie. Not appropriate,” but what they missed was a mother whose fierce faith in her son never wavered, even as the world supposedly picked him apart for being the child of an NFL legend and for perceived entitlement. That steadfast support shone through in November, when her son surprised the world with his talent.Sanders took the field as the starting quarterback against the Las Vegas Raiders and mesmerized the crowd with a 66-yard touchdown pass to running back Dylan Sampson: his first ever in the NFL. He also threw a 52-yard deep ball in the first quarter, caught by rookie Isiah Bond, who celebrated his own first career touchdown.Even star defensive end Myles Garrett, fresh off three sacks, was left flabbergasted by the play. The Raiders never stood a chance, as the Browns claimed a thrilling 24-10 victory. Pilar Sanders was there for every moment, proudly sporting a striking, rookie-inspired portrait outfit.Pilar Sanders illuminated the stands in Cleveland’s signature orange and matte black. Her collared, buttoned orange jacket popped over a round-neck graphic crop top, which showcased a bold square full of innumerable small “12” numbers and a striking image of Shedeur Sanders in full Browns gear, football in hand, eyes scanning the field for his receiver. Another oversized “12” blazed in orange at the corner. Beneath, a hint of white spaghetti strap peeked out, paired with dark blue jeans. The jacket’s extra-long drawstrings nearly brushed her mid-thigh, adding a casual and sporty edge. Pilar’s look was finished with understated makeup, a sweep of pink gloss, dramatic kohl-lined eyes, chunky silver earrings, and a huge ring glistening on her finger. Her luscious black hair tumbled in loose curls. From the NFL stands, she cheered with pride, her joy for her son unmistakable.By Pilar’s side was her daughter, Shelomi Sanders, a college basketball player at Alabama A&M and a passionate advocate for Type 1 Diabetes awareness. Shelomi’s outfit was a tribute to her brother, practically screaming “Shedeur Sanders” with every detail. Her long black top was a collage of action shots of the Browns’ rookie quarterback in uniform, each image capturing his energy on the gridiron, with “SHEDEUR SANDERS” boldly stamped at the hem. She layered it over a fitted white long-sleeve top and paired it with pitch black jeans. Her look dazzled with massive diamond bracelets (shout out to the rookie!), two delicate silver chains, and matching rings. Shelomi’s hair was braided at the crown and cascaded in curls below. Like her mom, she kept her makeup subtle, just a touch of kohl and a glossy sheen on her lips. Together, the duo cheered from the stands, capturing their excitement in videos for their Instagram stories.","Cleveland browns quarterback shedeur sanders’ mother, pilar sanders, wore a crop top to her son’s first nfl (preseason) game in august.

Why Lukas Reichel and Brad Lambert are drawing trade attention

Breaking News: NHL Trade - Blackhawks Trade Lukas Reichel to Canucks

This week, the NHL rumor mill is heating up with the trade speculation surrounding three young forwards- Andrei Svechnikov, Lukas Reichel, and Brad Lambert. Despite being in different developmental stages, the three of them are connected by one common issue: not knowing what roles or where they will be in the future. Quiet murmurs have rapidly turned into loud discussions as teams are trying to upgrade their rosters, and insiders are referring to frustrations, delays in progress, and potential shifts.Traditionally, the biggest talk of the town goes to Andrei Svechnikov, whose disappointing start to the season made the Carolina team think twice about him. The 25-year-old, according to Sportsnet reporter Elliotte Friedman, was dissatisfied with the reduced playing time, leading to multiple teams making inquiries as soon as the rumors began. The Hurricanes still consider him a key player and would only entertain what Friedman described as a “monster offer. ” After he moved back to the first line, he managed to score 12 times in 14 matches, which made the worries surrounding him a little lighter — still, the whole thing is one to keep an eye on.Winger Lukas Reichel, who is viewed in Vancouver as one of the main trade assets, could be available once more due to his inability to act accordingly.Rick Dhaliwal of CHEK-TV says that the Canucks might be open to trade if another team expresses interest. Reichel, who is only 23 years old, has one point in 13 games and has not played in some of the recent games. Teddy Blueger and Nils Höglander are close to returning, so their spots on the team are not at all secure.At the same time, Winnipeg Jets' prospect Brad Lambert has been given a chance to talk to other teams, as per a report by the insider Frank Seravalli. The player, who was once a very promising first-round talent, now only has one goal in a limited amount of NHL games and might really need a change of scenery—particularly since a number of teams are looking for centers.It’s that time of the year again when injuries rise, and the front offices start to evaluate their teams and players, keeping all the above-mentioned players right in the middle of the trade talks. Whether or not a move is made now or later, the trade buzz around Svechnikov, Reichel, and Lambert is not going away anytime soon.Also Read: NHL trade rumors: Pavel Mintyukov buzz heats up as Canadiens Montreal explore their options","Andrei svechnikov, lukas reichel, and brad lambert are all being mentioned in nhl trade rumors.

What Kirill Marchenko's uncertain status means for Columbus Blue Jackets' lines

Kirill Marchenko (#86) All 31 Goals of the 2024-25 NHL Season

The uncertainty regarding Kirill Marchenko’s health is the major concern and the main topic of the Columbus Blue Jackets vs. Washington Capitals encounter on Monday, November 24, slated for 7 p.m. ET at Capital One Arena and streamed live on ESPN+ and Fubo. With just one point separating the Blue Jackets from the Capitals in the standings, the emphasis going into the game is not on the standings or form - it is on the availability of the top scorer of Columbus.Marchenko, the Columbus player with the most points, 22 points in 22 games, left the skating session early today, turning the spotlight on his status. His participation has a huge impact on the team’s offense, power play, and overall/team morale when they play away from home, hence the importance of this update for fans and analysts keeping with the match-up teams.The coach, Dean Evason, has said that Marchenko is “still being evaluated” after he apparently got injured halfway through the morning skate. No details have been given about the issue, so the situation is still up in the air. Evason mentioned that the team would have to evaluate him more before making a decision on whether he will play; thus, he is really a game-time decision.If he’s not in uniform, Columbus is likely to turn to Zach Aston-Reese for the spot in the lineup, while Yegor Chinakhov is going to skate on the first line with Dmitri Voronkov and Adam Fantilli.The Blue Jackets have leaned a lot on Marchenko's scoring prowess this season, and it would be a great impediment for them not to have him during the last segment of their road trip of four games.In contrast, Washington is entering the match with a severe home loss to Tampa Bay and will be seeking to bounce back. The Capitals are still relying on Tom Wilson and Alex Ovechkin for offense, while Logan Thompson, the goaltender, who was pulled out of the game early in his last start, is hoping to start over.Even as the puck drop approaches, Marchenko’s situation is still in the spotlight. His being there or not being there could alter the game’s dynamics, thus making tonight's choice a crucial narrative in this divisional battle.Also Read: NHL Trade Buzz: Ottawa Senators pursue top-six forward as Vancouver Canucks move Lukas Reichel and San Jose Sharks prepare major roster changes","Columbus blue jackets face washington capitals on monday, november 24, at 7 p.m. Et at capital one arena.

Will Campbell’s injury and its impact on the Patriots

Will Campbell’s injury has become a big worry for the New England Patriots this week. On Sunday, November 23, 2025, in Foxborough, Will Campbell went down in the third quarter during the win over the Cincinnati Bengals. His left knee twisted on a run play, and he was carted off the field. The Patriots won 26-20, but the loss of their starting left tackle quickly became the main story of the night.On Monday morning, head coach Mike Vrabel spoke on The Greg Hill Show and said he does not expect Will Campbell to play on Monday night against the New York Giants. Vrabel called it “not a great day” for injuries and shared that Campbell may need “more than a week or two” to heal. His update made it clear that the Patriots could be without Campbell for multiple games.Will Campbell was injured late in the third quarter when his knee bent awkwardly during a running play. He had a towel over his head while being carted off, which often points to a serious injury.On Monday, Mike Vrabel explained that the team is still waiting for full medical tests but warned that the injury “doesn’t look like something he can come back from quickly.”The Patriots have not placed him on injured reserve yet, but that move could happen if doctors say he will miss at least four games.Campbell was not the only offensive lineman hurt on Sunday. Starting left guard Jared Wilson also exited the game after injuring his ankle.He was later seen walking with a boot, and his status for Monday night is also uncertain. If both Will Campbell and Jared Wilson are out, the Patriots may need Vederian Lowe at left tackle and Ben Brown at left guard.While both filled in throughout the Bengals game, changing two points on the same side of the line might have an impact on protection and timing.With an AFC-best 10–2 record, the Patriots start Week 13. Steady blocking and a powerful run game have been key factors in their success, and Will Campbell has begun every game at left tackle this year.His absence compels the team to change. New England might have to utilize faster throws, add more blocking support, or move more plays to the right side.Though for the moment Will Campbell is regarded as week-to-week as the Patriots prepare to meet the New York Giants on Monday night, Mike Vrabel said he hopes the injury is not season-ending.Also Read: Is Drake London Playing In Week 13 Vs The Jets?

How are Vancouver Canucks, Calgary Flames, and Edmonton Oilers shaping NHL trade talks?

Growing Concern Around Canadian Teams | 32 Thoughts

Once more, the NHL rumor mill is giving the Canadian teams the attention they deserve. The Vancouver Canucks have become the talk of the league due to the growing uncertainty surrounding Quinn Hughes, the Calgary Flames are attempting to keep the controversy they themselves ignited at a low simmer, and the Edmonton Oilers are getting ready for a roster evaluation that could be a major factor in their trade-deadline strategy. Key players have already been linked to the three franchises, thus the upcoming period could be critical for them all.As revealed by insider Elliotte Friedman on the 32 Thoughts Podcast, Vancouver Canucks management has decided to reorganize up to the top because of Hughes’ case. It is no more about a single player.
