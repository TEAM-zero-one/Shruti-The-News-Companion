NEW DELHI: The Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) on Tuesday targeted Congress leader Rahul Gandhi after former Pakistani cricketer Shahid Afridi called the Congress scion a leader with a ""positive mindset"".Lamenting over the Indian cricket team's decision to skip the customary handshake with the Pakistani team during Sunday's Asia Cup clash, Afridi said: ""This is a despicable mindset, which will continue till the time he (PM Modi) is their head. There are also good ones like Rahul Gandhi with a positive mindset, who wants to cooperate with the World through dialogue. Isn't Israel enough that you're trying to become like Israel here?"".Reacting to Afridi's remark, Union minister Kiren Rijiju called Rahul Gandhi a ""darling of Pakistan,"" saying ""Pakistani people could even make Rahul Gandhi their leader"".""Rahul Gandhi has been the darling of Pakistan! Shahid Afridi and the Pakistani people could even make Rahul Gandhi their leader,"" Rijiju wrote on X.BJP's I-T department chief Amit Malviya also cornered Rahul Gandhi, saying: ""When enemies of Bharat start cheering for you, the people of India know exactly where your loyalties lie"".""Rabid Hindu-hater Shahid Afridi, who never misses a chance to spew venom against India and dream of Kashmir joining Pakistan, is suddenly all praise for Rahul Gandhi. Afridi says Rahul wants “dialogue” with Pakistan, while attacking PM Modi by comparing India’s policy on Pakistan to Israel’s actions in Gaza,"" Malviya wrote on X.He further wrote: ""Why is it that every India-hater finds a friend in Rahul Gandhi? When enemies of Bharat start cheering for you, the people of India know exactly where your loyalties lie.""Hitting back at Malviya, Congress's social media chairperson Supriya Shrinate posted a photo of Anurag Thakur with Shahid Afridi during an India-Pakistan match that took place in February this year.The controversy erupted after Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha and India skipper Suryakumar Yadav did not exchange the customary handshake during the toss at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium.The PCB alleged that Pycroft had specifically instructed Salman to avoid shaking hands with his Indian counterpart.The situation escalated after India’s seven-wicket win when Suryakumar shook hands only with teammate Shivam Dube and walked off without acknowledging the Pakistani players.The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) also filed a formal complaint with the International Cricket Council (ICC), accusing match referee Andy Pycroft of violating the ICC Code of Conduct and the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) Laws regarding the Spirit of Cricket.However, the International Cricket Council (ICC) formally turned down the Pakistan Cricket Board's (PCB) request to replace match referee Andy Pycroft during the ongoing Asia Cup.The PCB chairman Mohsin Naqvi threatened to withdraw from the remaining Asia Cup 2025 matches if match referee Andy Pycroft is not removed.A PCB source, however, told TOI that ""it is very unlikely that the PCB will pull out from the Asia Cup"".","Former pakistani cricketer shahid afridi called the congress scion a leader with a ""positive mindset"" union minister kiren rijiju called rahul gandhi a ""darling of pakistan"" i-t department chief amit malviya cornered rahul gandhi, saying: ""when enemies of bharat start cheering for you, the people of india know where your loyalties lie""","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123922436,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-57768,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Skip Bayless calls Tom Brady a bad look for the NFL after headset appearance

Skip Bayless disappointed after praising Tom Brady as the greatest of all time for years

Tom Brady might be done playing, but the controversies just keep coming. His recent appearance with the Raiders staff on Monday Night Football sparked a heated tirade from Skip Bayless that’s still being talked about. Skip Bayless accused Brady of 'bullying the NFL' and even said he should decide between his role at Fox Sports and team ownership.Sports analyst Skip Bayless really didn't hold back on his thoughts about Brady's two roles during a segment on his show ""The Arena,"" which you can find in a YouTube video. Bayless, famous for his bold opinions, called it a ""bad look"" for the NFL and everyone connected to it.He specifically said to his audience, “He’s bullying this league. He took a deal to work for Fox, 10-years for $375 million. Then, he turned right around on top of that, and he bought five percent of the now Las Vegas Raiders… I fell out of my chair last night when I saw him sitting in the coaches box with a head set on… He is blatantly ‘f-you’ing’ the entire league and my former network.”Bayless shared more about his reasoning, emphasizing that Brady might be able to access confidential information through his broadcasting position, which could also help the Raiders.He elaborated, “His duties as a Fox broadcaster allow him, without any connection with the Raiders, to obviously interview all of you the day before he would commentate on your game.”He later added, “In that session… the players and coaches are going to confide in you… They are going to open up to you… Now, if I’m the Bears, I am shutting up, man. I am closing down.” These comments were a direct reaction to the sighting on Monday night and Carroll's confirmation, stressing Bayless's perspective that Brady's actions hurt fairness in the league.In a related X post on September 16, 2025, Bayless tweeted, ""Wait, Raiders owner Tom Brady is sitting in the coaching box with a headset & ESPN says he talks often during the week to O.C. Chip Kelly??? How can the NFL allow Brady to even remotely interview players/coaches of other teams as part of his Fox prep? This is just wrong.""A follow-up post stated, ""I have defended Tom Brady for years as the runaway NFL GOAT. But now he wants his cake and eat it, too? He took a reported $370 mil for 10 years from Fox then bought 5% of the Raiders, which severely limits his ability to do his Fox job? Now he's advising/coaching? Big-footing.""Bayless thinks Brady is using his power to take conflicting stances, giving the Raiders an unfair edge while cashing in on his Fox deal.He pointed out that this arrangement lets Brady tap into confidential info from competitors, which he might pass on to his own squad, jeopardizing the game's fairness.Historically, Skip Bayless has regarded Brady as the all-time greatest in the NFL, yet he's voiced his discontent over what he believes is Brady focusing on personal benefits rather than league integrity, especially with the constraints that ownership puts on his broadcasting responsibilities.His statements were influenced by the visual evidence from the broadcast and Carroll's public acknowledgment of Brady's role.In conclusion, Bayless urged Brady to let go of his Fox deal so he can focus exclusively on ownership, mentioning, “He should just drop the Fox deal. He wants to be an owner and operator of the franchise? Go do that.”Also Read: Marcus Spears calls out NFL for letting Tom Brady be the Las Vegas Raiders owner and Fox analyst at the same time Given the hefty $375 million value of the decade-long contract, it's pretty unlikely that Brady will just leave. The NFL is now dealing with a PR challenge and may need to create new guidelines to manage these overlaps, keeping the league's credibility intact along with that of players like Brady.","Skip bayless accused tom brady of 'bullying the nfl' and even said he should decide between his role at fox sports and team ownership.

Jonathan Kuminga continues to act as restricted free agent ahead of 2025-2026 NBA



Jonathan Kuminga has grown into one of the most exciting young basketball players in the NBA. Drafted by the Golden State Warriors in 2021, Kuminga quickly made an impact with his energy and athletic skills. He also became one of the youngest players to become an NBA champion in 2022 at the age of 19.In this article, we take a closer look at Jonathan Kuminga’s Net Worth.

For the 2024-2025 season, he was earning $7.6 million. This is the final year of his rookie contract.Even though his salary looks smaller compared to his performance, Kuminga could soon secure a much larger deal. Experts believe he may sign a contract worth more than $30 million per year if he continues to grow as a versatile forward.Kuminga’s endorsement portfolio is still developing. Reportedly, he has secured deals with Zen Water, Drink Accelerator, and Nike.These are steady partnerships, but more opportunities are expected if he secures a major NBA contract.Off the court, Kuminga keeps a private life.

Taylor Swift has always been very concerned about her safety and has mostly missed away games of Travis Kelce’s Kansas City Chiefs due to security concerns. With yesterday’s match being the Chiefs’ first home game of the season, fans were expecting to catch a glimpse of Taylor Swift. But many were left disappointed but fans feel it is because of what might have happened to Charlie Kirk and the other gun violence incidents that happened over the last few days.According to FOX Sports, Taylor Swift did arrive at the Arrowhead Stadium to cheer on Travis Kelce but the billionaire pop star used a large movable wall to sneak into the stadium.Now, fans are very concerned about her safety. A fan by the username @wompingwillowx wrote, “anyone unable to tell this is for her safety is either really dense or mentally immature. she isn’t hiding behind a bullet proof barrier for an easter egg. like bffr. everything that happened last week, people are insane. she wanted to go watch her fiancé in peace and safety.”Another fan by the username @roadnoz wrote, “After what happened this week with all the shootings I’m sure their taking extreme measures for her safety.”A third fan by the username @yeswhaleswiftie posted, “Also not a single camera, at least from what I’ve been watching, has even TRIED to sneak a peak of her in that suite. Shows that this has been discussed by a lot of people and it’s probably for her safety.”·Another fan by the username @humcupcake wrote, “I hate to even bring this up, but do we think this could be about enhanced security due to everything that has been happening?”

Another image exhibited her staring at her nephew, captioned, ""Can't believe you're 1 already.""The next photo might be the sweetest of all, showing Ryder holding her finger, captioned, ""Besties forever."" She finished with a photo of herself with Brady, captioned, ""Happy birthday BOT ... You're the best dad and brother.""The posts captured the close-knit bond that defines the family of Tkachuk.

The debate show thrives on chemistry, energy, and timing, and choosing the right successor could define its future.Qerim, who first joined ESPN in 2006 and became the permanent host of “First Take” in 2015, became the steady hand at the center of heated debates. Her departure was acknowledged by ESPN president Burke Magnus, who praised her “poise, skill and professionalism” and credited her with helping the show become a flagship program. Qerim herself described the move as a deeply personal decision, writing, “After much reflection, I’ve decided it’s time to close this incredible chapter and step away from First Take. ”Now the conversation shifts to who can carry the torch.

What the NFL rules say about Tom Brady’s dual role

Is this a smart business decision or a conflict of interest?

Tom Brady’s unusual dual role as a Fox analyst and minority owner of the Las Vegas Raiders has ignited debate across the NFL world. After calling the Washington Commanders game in Week 1, Brady was seen sitting in the Raiders’ coaching booth during their Week 2 matchup against the Chargers. His presence raised eyebrows, with many questioning the potential conflict of interest.Despite the controversy, ESPN’s Adam Schefter clarified that Tom Brady did not break any NFL rules. “There are no policies that prohibit an owner from sitting in the coaches’ booth or wearing a headset during a game,” explained NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy. Brady, in his capacity as a limited partner and Raiders minority owner, is allowed to sit in the booth. However, the league has strictly barred him from attending team practices, production meetings, or visiting the Raiders’ facilities in a non-broadcast capacity.This unusual arrangement stems from Tom Brady’s massive 10-year, $375 million deal with Fox, along with his decision to invest in the Raiders after retiring from the quarterback position. The NFL clearly limits his interaction to broadcasting duties and prevents any involvement that could give him inside competitive advantage.Critics like Grant Paulsen of 106.7 The Fan called it “a ridiculous conflict of interest,” especially considering Brady’s close involvement with the Raiders as an owner and broadcaster. The debate intensifies ahead of Week 3 when the Raiders face Washington, where Brady previously called their game as an analyst.

The bittersweet decision to part ways

Tom Brady and Gisele Bündchen’s marriage once seemed like the perfect pairing of sports and supermodel stardom. But after 13 years together, the couple announced their divorce in 2019, revealing the hidden struggles behind their glamorous public life.Despite the picture-perfect image, Gisele Bündchen had growing worries about the toll Tom Brady’s football career was taking on their family. In interviews, Bündchen opened up about her concerns over the sport’s violence and its long-term impact on Brady’s health. “I have my children and I would like him to be more present,” she said.Their differing priorities became more evident as Brady continued to chase records rather than retiring as planned. In a Facebook Watch docuseries, Bündchen recalled, “He did tell me that he was going to play only for 10 years… now you know, now we’re going to go and live in Costa Rica.” But that plan never materialized.Brady admitted later, “She didn’t feel like I was doing my part for the family… she would take care of the house.” This imbalance strained their relationship. Gisele even wrote him a “very thought-out letter,” which Brady kept as a reminder that priorities evolve.When they publicly announced their divorce in October 2019, both emphasized co-parenting their children with care and respect. Brady called ending their marriage “painful and difficult, like it is for many people who go through the same thing every day around the world,” while Bündchen expressed gratitude for their time together: “I feel blessed to the time we had together and only wish the best for Tom always.”Also Read: Tom Brady’s struggle to move on from Gisele Bündchen – here’s why fans think he’s holding on to the past Though their separation marked the end of one chapter, it also opened space for individual growth.

The NBA is still feeling the effects of the February 2025 deal that brought Luka Doncic from the Dallas Mavericks to the Los Angeles Lakers. NBA commissioner Adam Silver has now addressed the whole situation. He referred to the super controversial Doncic trade by the Dallas Mavericks to the Los Angeles Lakers. Apparently, Silver has become the subject of a conspiracy theory that suggests that he has reportedly orchestrated the Doncic deal so that he could allegedly favor the Lakers.NBA commissioner Adam Silver recently shared his thoughts on the trade, calling it a ""blow to Doncic"" and expressing his hope that the player would take the opportunity to start over. In his comments about the trade, Silver expressed his surprise and empathy for the angry Mavericks supporters. He also gave them hope by stating that ""only time will tell whether it was a smart trade.""More than seven months after the transaction, Silver made some intriguing remarks about it in a report titled ""Welcome to the Luka Doncic Revenge Tour"" in the Wall Street Journal. During the same, he said:“Putting aside the merits of the trade, you could argue that it was a bit of a kick in the a** to Luka...""According to Silver:“Another player could have said, ‘Oh, now I’m part of the Los Angeles Lakers organization’. He didn’t try to hide his disappointment, and I think he was in a bit of a funk for a while, because it was probably the first true professional setback of his career. And I was hoping personally for him that he would ultimately see this as an opportunity to reset.”Regarding Doncic's response, he said,""He didn't try to sugarcoat this trade.""Silver further noted that it was likely the first professional setback of Luka's career, so he was in a bit of a funk for a while. The Commissioner, however, feels that the trade has evolved beyond a simple transactional shock.In a shocking and unexpected turn of events, the Utah Jazz arranged a three-team trade that saw Luka Doncic go from the Dallas Mavericks to the Los Angeles Lakers in exchange for Anthony Davis. Following this, Doncic discussed his shock at the trade, speaking with the Wall Street Journal Magazine for its Fall Men’s Issue. He said:""I didn't know how to react, how to act, what to say. It was a lot of shock. I felt Dallas was my home. I had many friends there. The fans always supported me. I didn't want to upset Dallas fans. And I didn't want to upset Laker fans.""Additionally, talking about it, he told Men’s Health Magazine:“This summer was just a little bit different, you know. It kind of motivated me to be even better.. If I stop now, it was all for nothing.”Moreover, in an interview with ESPN's Malika Andrews, Doncic disclosed that when he found out the Mavericks were trading him, he threw his phone in anger and frustration and broke the glass. He acknowledged that he was devastated, not knowing why it happened. However, that setback only made him more determined. Even though he reportedly hasn’t moved on from the Mavs, he is seemingly doing well with the Lakers.Also read: Mark Cuban admits regret over Luka Doncic trade, says he “f**ked up” after selling Mavericks","Luka doncic was traded from the dallas mavericks to the los angeles lakers in february.

Kawhi Leonard Scam with Steve Ballmer | Gucci Turban Podcast

Steve Ballmer, the owner of the Los Angeles Clippers , is currently being investigated for allegedly evading the salary cap with star forward Kawhi Leonard. However, he claimed to be innocent and apparently doesn't mind the NBA investigating him. On Tuesday, he expressed his approval of the NBA's inquiry into the matter. He also reaffirmed his remarks and hinted that the NBA's probe will turn up nothing unusual. During an interview, he further said that “this too shall pass.”Steve Ballmer reportedly invested $50 million in 2021 in Aspiration, a now-bankrupt company, according to Pablo Torre. Later, Kawhi Leonard and the company reportedly reached an endorsement agreement that allegedly required almost nothing of him.Now, Ballmer claimed that he has nothing to hide and the NBA investigating him will not find anything. He made such remarks while appearing as a guest speaker at the Sports Business Journal's Drive event. At one point, the host said:“I know that you've had a lot going on including allegations against the team about the partnership with aspiration and know if you want to address it right off. Sure, we're not, we're not, this is not a fun thing to be through. I was personally defrauded through our interactions with the company and some of the staff…”He then replied:“The fraud sort of extended broadly through that. We had many relationships with the company sponsor, activation was through carbon credits, all a bunch of complicated stuff. But the important thing is our relationship with the company and our players' relationship with the company were independent, which is important under the rules of the NBA…”Ballmer also claimed that he had been duped and that the NBA would discover that Leonard's relationship with Aspiration and the L.A.Clippers' relationship with Aspiration were ""independent.""He continued:“I feel quite confident that we abided by the rules. And so I welcome the investigation that the NBA is doing. It's a great way from our perspective to get the facts out there. And as I say, there's nothing fun about being highlighted in this way. It's a whole lot more fun to be highlighted for building a great arena. But this too shall pass… And like I said, I feel very good about what we did and we welcome the NBA, taking a look at it and hopefully agreeing with us…”For context, the Los Angeles Clippers, Steve Ballmer, and Kawhi Leonard made the news since Pablo Torre ’s claims of possible salary cap evasion. The NBA is now looking into Ballmer, the Clippers, and Leonard after it was revealed that a company Ballmer invested in paid Leonard $28 million for ""no-show jobs"" in an apparent attempt to get around the NBA's pay cap.Journalist Pablo Torre reportedly uncovered the whole thing and in his ""Kawhi Leonard Signed a Secret $28M Deal” podcast episode, he revealed everything. Torre then described how Leonard reportedly broke NBA regulations by accepting money from a now-bankrupt company in addition to his club salary.Torre made enough connections to start the NBA's investigation in the matter. Following these revelations, Ballmer and the Clippers refuted the claims, claiming that Aspiration had misled Ballmer and that he had ""no oversight"" into Leonard's independent endorsement deal with Aspiration.Also read: Smoking gun’ emerges in Kawhi Leonard and Los Angeles Clippers Aspiration payment controversy","Steve ballmer, the owner of the los angeles clippers, is currently being investigated for allegedly evading the salary cap with star forward kawhi leonard.

LeBron James’ age and physical toll spark questions about his career path

LeBron James’ future questioned as player option leaves him with no long term security in Los Angeles Lakers

Brian Windhorst recently ignited conversations about LeBron James ' future on an episode of the Hoop Collective podcast. During the chat, Windhorst mentioned that LeBron James has been associated with the idea of possibly playing in other basketball leagues outside of the NBA . This remark surfaced during wider discussions regarding James' contract and performance, leading to speculation about whether the Lakers star might explore other options if he decides to leave the league.During the conversation, Windhorst focused on LeBron James' play style and mental approach. He remarked, ""He played the last two seasons he's played 71 in 70 games. Um, he this last year averaged 24 points, eight rebounds, eight assists, shot 51% overall from the field. His three-point percentage was 37% 38% if you round up, which was down from the year before.""Windhorst pointed out that James' performance doesn't indicate he's about to retire, stating, ""What I can tell you is his play on the court is not indicating somebody who's near retirement now. No, he's still one of the 10 or 15 best players in the league. Easy.""Still, he threw out a bold assertion regarding other leagues when he was addressing co-host Tim McMahon's observation about anticipating a decline in James' output. Windhorst stated, ""I keep saying I keep hearing people like this might be the last year. This might be the last year. Look, he's been linked to potentially playing in other leagues. I don't know.Maybe. But if he stays healthy, I do not see LeBron James slowing down. ""Windhorst's remarks seem to be based on the current buzz and the changing phase of James' career. He noted that there's been a lot of talk suggesting that ""This could be James' final year"" in the NBA, influenced by his age, the physical toll, and his uncertain contract situation.The mention of other leagues was brought up as a potential scenario during these talks, with Windhorst adding, ""I don't know. Maybe,"" which shows it's more about the rumors he's picked up rather than any solid plans.This fits perfectly with Windhorst's position as someone who frequently shares insights on James' career, having followed him closely since the beginning. The remark was made after defining the steadfastness and elite position of James as a decision made by Windhorst to balance his optimistic projection of the duration James will serve in the NBA with the presence of external publicity.Windhorst shared some in-depth insights into why James' future is up in the air. He pointed out that James can't get a contract extension and has a no-trade clause, which sets him up for unrestricted free agency after the 2025-26 season. This is a first for James, as he's always had some level of security beyond the current year.Windhorst also mentioned comments from Rich Paul, James' agent. Paul told Shams Charania that James is feeling uncertain about his future after opting in for his player option. Moreover, Paul personally told Windhorst that the Lakers haven't had any serious discussions about a new deal, saying, ""They didn't have material conversations with the Lakers about a new contract.""Also Read: Mario Chalmers claims Kevin Durant avoided Miami Heat to dodge the pressure of following LeBron James’ legacy There’s a lot of instability in the Lakers' roster, with many players such as Rui Hachimura, Austin Reaves, Gabe Vincent, and others entering contract years or having options.
