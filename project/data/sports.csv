Why Davante Adams is not playing vs Seahawks today? Rams WR's return timeline revealed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/why-davante-adams-is-not-playing-vs-seahawks-today-rams-wrs-return-timeline-revealed/articleshow/126067551.cms,"Davante Adams injury report (Getty Images)

Davante Adams week-to-week status and recovery outlook



Davante Adams is not playing for the Los Angeles Rams tonight against the Seattle Seahawks, as the star wide receiver remains sidelined with knee and hamstring injuries. The 32-year-old, who was initially listed as doubtful, has officially been declared inactive. This comes as a blow for Rams fans, as Adams has been the team’s most potent offensive weapon since joining in the 2025 offseason. Leading the NFL with 14 receiving touchdowns this season, his absence reshapes the Rams’ offensive plans for tonight’s clash.Adams’ injuries, sustained in Week 15 against the Detroit Lions, are being treated cautiously. He pulled up short while running a route in the fourth quarter, clutching his hamstring. NFL insider Ian Rapoport confirmed the situation remains week-to-week, noting that Adams is not dealing with a season-ending issue. While fans may hope for a quick return, the team is taking no chances. The Rams also listed other inactives tonight, including CB Ahkello Witherspoon, QB Stetson Bennett IV, RB Jarquez Hunter, OL Beaux Limmer, and OLB Nick Hampton, signaling a lineup that will look markedly different without Adams’ presence.The focus now shifts to when Adams might return. “So, don't expect him to play tonight, but the hope is, next game, if there's enough time to recover, we could see Davante out there,” Rapoport said, emphasizing cautious optimism. Earlier in the week, he also highlighted the possibility of Adams missing the remainder of the regular season, depending on recovery progress. “There are only a couple types of injuries this time of year: there's an injury where a guy is fine, there's an injury where he's back for the playoffs, and then he's done. The hope is that this is one of those he's back for the playoffs,” Rapoport added.The Rams’ schedule offers some relief. With a mini-bye ahead of Week 17 due to the Thursday night game, Adams will have 11 days to recover, giving medical staff a crucial window to evaluate his readiness. Encouragingly, he was able to participate in some pre-game warm-ups on Thursday night, indicating progress. Fans can expect a new update at the start of next week, or by Thursday at the latest when Los Angeles releases its first weekly injury report. While tonight’s game will see Adams on the sidelines, his eventual return remains a key factor in the Rams’ push toward a playoff run.Also Read: Puka Nacua injury update: Los Angeles Rams’ star WR’s availability for tonight’s Seahawks game sparks panic after Sunday night scare",Davante adams is not playing for the los angeles rams tonight against the seattle seahawks.

Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen’s personal life has often drawn attention alongside his on-field success. While Allen is now married to actress Hailee Steinfeld, interest around his former long-term partner, Brittany Williams, has resurfaced in recent months. The two shared a deep history that stretched back to childhood, making their eventual split in 2023 a notable moment for fans. Here’s a closer look at who Brittany Williams is and her journey beyond her relationship with the NFL star.Brittany Williams and Josh Allen’s story began long before the spotlight. The pair grew up in Fresno, California, and first met as children through family connections. Though they lost touch for years, they reconnected during their late teens and officially began dating in 2017.As Allen’s football career gained momentum: first at Wyoming and then in the NFL, Williams remained a constant presence. When Allen was drafted by the Buffalo Bills in 2018, she relocated to New York with him, becoming a familiar face to Bills fans during his rise as one of the league’s elite quarterbacks.Williams attended California State University, Fresno, where she was a cheerleader and a member of the Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority.Sports were already a part of her family background; her father, Chris Williams, played college football at Fresno State in the 1990s.That athletic upbringing helped Williams easily adapt to the football-centric lifestyle that came with dating a franchise quarterback.Away from football, Brittany Williams has carved out her own professional identity. She is a certified Pilates instructor and runs an online fitness platform called Pilates by Britt, where she shares workout programs and wellness content.In addition, Williams has built a following as a fashion and lifestyle influencer. She regularly collaborates with well-known brands such as Alo, Revolve and Talentless, and maintains an active presence on social media, where she posts fitness routines, travel snapshots and fashion partnerships.Williams and Allen quietly ended their relationship in 2023 after nearly six years together. While neither publicly detailed the reasons behind the breakup, Williams later acknowledged that re-entering the dating world after a decade-long relationship was challenging but ultimately empowering.Since the split, she has focused on her career, personal growth and life in New York, while Allen has moved on to a new chapter in his personal life.Though no longer together, Brittany Williams remains more than just “Josh Allen’s ex.” From fitness entrepreneurship to influencing, she continues to build her own path - one that stands independent of her past NFL connection.","Brittany williams and josh allen split in 2023 after nearly six years together.

Fans throw objects, vandalise stadium after Messi leaves early | Hyderabad next

Former India captain Sourav Ganguly has taken legal action against Uttam Saha, the president of the Argentina Fan Club of Kolkata, by filing a defamation case seeking Rs 50 crore in damages. The move follows allegations made by Saha linking Ganguly to the controversy surrounding the chaotic Yuva Bharati Stadium event during Lionel Messi ’s visit to Kolkata on Saturday, December 13.The complaint, lodged at Lalbazar, states that Saha’s public remarks were baseless and caused serious damage to Ganguly’s reputation. Ganguly has termed the accusations “false, malicious, offensive and defamatory”, alleging that they were made with full knowledge of the harm they could cause to his public image.Currently serving as the president of the Cricket Association of Bengal, Ganguly clarified in his complaint that he had no official role in organising or managing the Messi event. He maintained that his presence at the stadium was strictly as an invited guest and that he had no involvement in the planning or execution of the programme.The legal action adds a new dimension to the fallout from Messi’s much-hyped visit to Kolkata, which descended into disorder and sparked widespread criticism.Ganguly’s complaint specifically challenges claims made by Saha that he acted as a middleman in the management of the event, which was overseen by its main organiser, Satadru Dutta.“Serious allegations are being made publicly without any factual basis,” Ganguly stated in his filing. His legal representatives have since issued a notice to Saha, demanding a retraction of the statements and compensation for the alleged damage caused.Following the chaos at the venue, event organiser Satadru Dutta was detained for questioning by authorities. West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee later issued a public apology on X, expressing regret over the mismanagement of the event and apologising to Lionel Messi as well as football fans in Kolkata who were unable to see the Argentine star properly.During the event at Yuva Bharati Stadium, Ganguly was present in a separate area of the venue. As the situation in the stands deteriorated, he was seen exiting the stadium, visibly disappointed by the turn of events.The Messi programme was widely criticised for poor planning and crowd control, leaving fans frustrated after paying hefty ticket prices in anticipation of a memorable experience. Instead, scenes of disorder dominated coverage, drawing national and international attention to shortcomings in the organisation of high-profile sporting events in India.The incident also revived debates around VIP culture at major sports functions. Reports and videos highlighted limited fan interaction with Messi, while officials and invited guests occupied the field area, further fuelling anger among supporters and adding to the backlash surrounding the event.",Former india captain sourav ganguly has filed a defamation case against uttam saha.

Maple Leafs fans on edge after reporter claims Auston Matthews trade talks may be closer than believed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/maple-leafs-fans-on-edge-after-reporter-claims-auston-matthews-trade-talks-may-be-closer-than-believed/articleshow/126059895.cms,"Auston Matthews trade rumor (Getty Images)

Auston Matthews and the pressure point Toronto cannot ignore

The mood around the Maple Leafs has shifted from confidence to caution. Toronto entered the season expecting its captain to set the pace, yet nights now pass where the scoreboard stays silent for stretches that feel unfamiliar. Auston Matthews still generates chances, still competes hard in all three zones, but goals no longer arrive with the same inevitability. In a market that measures greatness shift by shift, that absence has grown louder than any cheer.What makes this moment heavier is timing. Toronto is not rebuilding or experimenting. This is a team built to win now. When production stalls at the center of that plan, anxiety spreads quickly. Conversations that once felt unthinkable are now whispered openly, not because Matthews has fallen off, but because expectations around him remain sky high.The tension spiked when Leafs reporter Howard Berger suggested the organization will not move forward until Matthews asks for a trade, possibly by this year’s trade deadline. That idea alone rattled the fanbase. Matthews has been the franchise constant for nearly a decade.Imagining Toronto without him feels like pulling a load-bearing wall from the house.On the ice, the frustration has roots. Matthews continues to win faceoffs, backcheck, and handle defensive responsibility. Yet Toronto pays him to swing games offensively. At five-on-five, his line has not consistently owned shifts. On the power play, the dominance that once felt automatic has faded into predictability. The looks are there, but the finish has gone missing.That gap between effort and outcome feeds scrutiny. In Toronto, leadership is judged through goals when the stakes rise. When scoring dries up, every shift becomes a test of authority and legacy. Nick Kypreos tried to strike a more hopeful tone in the Toronto Star, but optimism struggles to breathe when results lag behind reputation.The coaching staff has searched for answers. Different wingers, altered looks, and tactical tweaks have come and gone. The puck still moves well, but the instinctive scoring touch that defined Matthews has not returned with consistency. There is also quiet talk of tension with coach Craig Berube, another layer that complicates an already delicate situation.Trading a captain in his prime is not standard practice. Neither is standing still while doubt grows inside a contender. Toronto management now faces a narrow path where action and inaction both carry consequences. Whether Berger’s report proves prophetic or premature, it captures how fragile this stretch feels.Matthews remains elite. Yet in this market, elite alone no longer settles the noise. The next few months will decide more than standings. They will define how this era is remembered, and whether Auston Matthews and Toronto find clarity together or part under pressure.Also Read: Are Auston Matthews and Craig Berube drifting apart as Maple Leafs struggles spark tense locker-room speculation?","The mood around the maple leafs has shifted from confidence to caution.

Joaquin Buckley explains why Islam Makhachev should walk away from UFC for good



Joaquin Buckley has shared a strong opinion about Islam Makhachev’s future in the UFC. Buckley believes Makhachev should retire if he beats Kamaru Usman in a potential welterweight title fight. Makhachev recently made history at UFC 322. He beat Jack Della Maddalena by an unanimous decision. With that win, he became the 11th two-division champion in UFC history.After the fight, the talk quickly shifted to what comes next. It is noteworthy that Kamaru Usman has been calling for a title shot for some time. A possible fight between Makhachev and Usman has lately gained momentum. Ali Abdelaziz, who manages both fighters, also supported the idea. Buckley believes that the fight should mark the end of Makhachev’s career if he wins.In an interview with Submission Radio, Joaquin Buckley explained his reasoning in detail. He believes both fighters would have little left to prove after the matchup.Buckley said, “Whoever wins that fight between Islam vs. Kamaru can get out of here, because if Usman wins, he’s one and done, because he said he’s moving to get that title against Khamzat for the rematch.If Islam wins, he said he’s gonna hold it down for a long time, but I don’t believe that. If Islam gets the fight that he wants, that means not only did you submit your name at lightweight over your brother Khabib, but then you also got the double champ status, and then you also beat a GOAT in Usman. So you just pulled the Jon Jones.”Buckley then questioned what more Makhachev could achieve.“What else is there to do? What else can he do? You’d be foolish to keep fighting, because to me, Islam is not a natural 170 [pound] fighter, and that will get exposed if he fights a person like myself, Ian Garry, or Michael Morales”, he added.Makhachev himself has also spoken about the possible fight. In an interview with Red Corner MMA, he explained why Usman would be his toughest challenge at welterweight.He said, “I said I wanted to fight Kamaru Usman next. Although the media doesn’t believe in this fight, as I can see. But in my opinion, Usman would steamroll through these up-and-comers like Morales, Prates, and the striker. Those guys haven’t been checked yet. I think Usman would be the hardest fight for me.”For now, the fight remains unconfirmed. But the debate around Makhachev’s future continues to grow in the UFC fraternity.Also Read: Islam Makhachev reveals why he almost stopped the fight for teammate Tagir Ulanbekov during UFC Qatar bout","Joaquin buckley believes islam makhachev should retire if he beats kamaru usman in a potential welterweight title fight.

5 Biggest NBA moments of 2025: Luka Doncic trade and more,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/5-biggest-nba-moments-of-2025-luka-doncic-trade-and-more/articleshow/126057014.cms,"Luka Doncic (Image via Kevin Jairaj-Imagn Images)

1. The Luka Doncic blockbuster trade



2. Jimmy Butler joins the ""Last Dance"" Warriors



4. The bitter Chris Paul-Clippers breakup



5. Dallas Mavericks fire GM Nico Harrison



If you had told an NBA fan a year ago that Luka Doncic would be seen donning a yellow jersey on the hardwood or that Tom Thibodeau would be out of a job in New York, they would have called you crazy. Yet, as we close out 2025, that is the reality of a league that has officially entered its ""chaos era."" This year wasn't just about basketball, it was about the cold, hard business of winning, where legacy and loyalty were tossed aside for immediate resets.From the dismantling of the Mavericks' core to a heartbreaking divorce in Los Angeles, here are the five seismic shifts that defined the NBA in 2025.In a move that shattered the internet on February 2, the Dallas Mavericks sent Luka Doncic to the Los Angeles Lakers in exchange for Anthony Davis, Max Christie, and a 2029 first-round pick. Facilitated by the Utah Jazz, this wasn't just a trade, it was a surrender. The Mavericks reportedly moved on due to long-standing frustrations regarding Luka’s conditioning and defensive commitment. While the Lakers now pair Luka with a 40-year-old LeBron James, the deal is already being analysed as one of the most lopsided gambles in sports history.After a toxic standoff in Miami that included three separate team suspensions, Jimmy Butler finally got his wish.He was traded to the Golden State Warriors in early February, immediately signing a two-year, $121 million extension. The move gave Stephen Curry the elite secondary star he’s lacked since 2022. While critics called Butler ""overpaid"" as the Warriors struggled late in the year, his defensive grit has provided a much-needed pulse to an aging dynasty.3. The New York Knicks fire Tom ThibodeauPerhaps the most ""New York"" moment of the year came on June 3. Just days after leading the Knicks to their first Eastern Conference Finals in 25 years, Tom Thibodeau was fired. Despite a 48-win season, President Leon Rose decided that a six-game series loss to the Pacers proved ""Thibs"" couldn't get them to a championship level. The move left stars like Jalen Brunson visibly stunned and marked a brutal end to the man who made the Knicks relevant again.The ""Point God’s"" storybook return to the Clippers ended in a nightmare. In early December, Chris Paul was effectively exiled, with the team sending him home from a road trip in Atlanta. The 40-year-old veteran had reportedly stopped speaking to head coach Tyronn Lue as the team spiralled into an 18-loss rut. What was meant to be a nostalgic final season turned into a messy, public divorce that left one of the game's greats working out at a private gym while awaiting a buyout.Parting with Luka Doncic put GM Nico Harrison under a lot of fire, both from the organisation and fans. As the ultimate conclusion of a meeting between Nico Harrison and the team governor, Patrick Dumont, on November 11, Mavericks fired General Manager Harrison. After a dismal 3-8 start to the 2025-26 season and facing a fan base that spent every home game chanting ""Fire Nico,"" the franchise finally pulled the plug. It was a swift fall for a GM who had been in the Finals just 18 months prior, proving that in today’s NBA, one bad trade can end a career.2025 was a year of unthinkable clashes, chaos, and trades, and served as a testament that in the modern NBA, everything is replaceable. These surprising exits have left the fans and players wondering what the next decision will be that might shake up the league.Also read: Luka Doncic max contract details: Total earnings, salary, duration, and more","2025 was a year of unthinkable clashes, chaos, and trades in the nba.

Why did the New York Knicks decline to raise the NBA Cup Banner?

Ja Morant misses the Memphis Grizzlies' game against the Minnesota Timberwolves

Houston Rockets head coach Ime Udoka fined for lashing out at officials

December 17, 2025, turned out to be a defining day for the league. Despite winning the NBA Cup, the New York Knicks declined to lift the banner. It created a lot of buzz within the league as well as among fans. Apart from this, the Memphis Grizzlies managed to rack up a win against the Minnesota Timberwolves without Ja Morant. The star player of the team remained sidelined due to another setback injury.Off the court, the league witnessed a few controversies and punishments. Houston Rockets head coach Ime Udoka was fined for making inappropriate comments on the officiating personnel of the game during a post-game interview. This is not the first time the coach faced punishment. Udoka was previously suspended by the Boston Celtics for violating team policies.In stunning news, the winners of the NBA Cup chose restraint over celebration. The New York Knicks defeated the San Antonio Spurs to win their first cup since 1973. However, the team decided not to lift the banner against the former winners commemorating the achievement. SNY insider Ian Begley was the first one to break the news to the fans.It was an organizational choice to do so. The team seemingly wants to focus on the championship run rather than highlighting an interim success. The Knicks have never publicly spoken against the in-season tournament. However, their recent act reflects how the regular season still is a more important goal than the NBA Cup Championship.It doesn’t look like an effective season for Ja Morant. The NBA star was sidelined due to an injury since mid-November. However, he made a comeback against the Utah Jazz on December 12. Despite the comeback, the player faced another injury in the game against the Los Angeles Clippers. He missed the fourth quarter of the game due to an ankle injury. Owing to that, the athlete missed out on the game against the Minnesota Timberwolves.Morant was initially listed as questionable to play but was later downgraded to doubtful. His status for the future games remains uncertain. Despite his absence, the team managed to rack up a win against the Timberwolves with a 6-point lead.Ime Udoka faces another major punishment due to his recent comments. During a post-game interview after the Houston Rockets’ overtime loss to the Denver Nuggets. He blamed the officials partially for the team’s loss. Udoka stated, “Just in general, I think, most poorly officiated game I've seen in a long time. [Officials Natalie Sago and Jamahl Ralls] have no business being out there, and [crew chief Zach Zarba] was acting starstruck. You're seeing all kinds of inconsistent calls, and I'm sure we should've gotten a few more techs.”Following his disrespectful comments, the coach was fined a staggering amount of $25,000. The announcement was made by James Jones, Executive Vice President, Head of Basketball Operations. In the announcement, it was clearly stated that the reason behind it was “public criticism of the officiating.” Udoka has been involved in such controversies before. One such case was when the coach was suspended by the Boston Celtics for violating team policies.These are some of the top news stories of the day.

Jack Roslovic injury details emerge for Edmonton Oilers



The Edmonton Oilers have remained tight-lipped for weeks regarding Jack Roslovic’s sudden disappearance from the lineup, fueling speculation among fans and analysts. The veteran forward was injured during a November 25 game against the Dallas Stars, when a blocked shot abruptly cut short one of his strongest stretches of the season.At the time, the Oilers classified the issue as a lower-body injury, offering few details while managing Roslovic’s recovery internally. As Edmonton navigated a demanding part of its schedule, questions persisted about the severity of the injury and why one of the team’s most reliable secondary scorers remained sidelined.Clarity finally arrived this week after details surfaced during a radio appearance, revealing that Jack Roslovic required surgery following the blocked shot against the Dallas Stars. The injury, described bluntly by insiders, involved a highly sensitive area and explained both the extended absence and the organization’s discretion.While the specifics were uncomfortable, the update confirmed that Roslovic has already undergone surgery and is progressing toward a return. Barring setbacks, the Edmonton Oilers are hopeful he could rejoin the lineup sometime before Christmas, a welcome boost as the standings tighten.Before the injury, Roslovic had been quietly effective for Edmonton, and in 23 games, he recorded 10 goals and 18 points. Thus, providing valuable depth scoring behind the Oilers’ elite stars.Injuries are an unavoidable part of the NHL. But this one stands out due to its sheer bad luck and rarity. The Oilers’ cautious handling now appears justified. Also, prioritizing long-term health over a rushed return.As Edmonton pushes through a competitive stretch of the season, the potential return of Jack Roslovic could stabilize the lineup and restore offensive balance. If he can quickly regain form, the Oilers will gladly welcome him back; fully aware of how difficult and unusual the road to recovery truly was.Also Read: Net worth of New York Islanders star Bo Horvat in 2025: Details on his earnings, salary, contract details and projections",Edmonton oilers have remained tight-lipped about the severity of jack roslovic's injury.

Tom Brady Reveals What It's Like Being The GOAT, If He Could Still Play + Shaq & Brady NFL Duo?

Why Tom Brady believes he could still play at the highest level

Teams reportedly reached out after retirement

Also Read:

Even in retirement, Tom Brady continues to dominate NFL conversations. The seven-time Super Bowl champion may be 48 and firmly removed from the weekly grind of professional football, but his belief in his own ability remains as strong as ever. Recent remarks from Brady have once again fueled speculation about whether the greatest quarterback of all time could still compete or even return in the modern NFL.Speaking on The Big Podcast with Shaquille O’Neal, Brady made headlines with a characteristically blunt assessment of his current form. “I’d whoop a - right now,” Brady said, adding that with a month of preparation, he believes he could still play at the highest level. The statement, while bold, felt entirely on-brand for a player who built a two-decade dynasty on relentless self-belief and preparation.Brady was quick to clarify that his confidence does not mean a comeback is imminent. In multiple interviews, including his work as FOX Sports’ lead NFL analyst, the former Patriots and Buccaneers star explained that physical ability is not what’s keeping him off the field. Instead, it’s the commitment required to endure a full NFL season.According to Brady, the weekly punishment, recovery demands, and mental toll of a 17-game schedule are no longer appealing. While he believes he could still step in and execute an offense effectively, especially given his reliance on timing, decision-making and football IQ rather than athleticism, the long-term grind no longer aligns with his priorities.Adding intrigue to the conversation, Brady confirmed that at least one NFL team contacted him after his second retirement in 2023 to gauge his interest in returning. He declined to name the franchise, describing the inquiry as “intriguing” but insisting he was already “done-done” at that stage.The revelation underscores Brady’s enduring value around the league. Even after 23 seasons, seven Super Bowl titles and multiple retirements, teams still view him as a potential solution, a testament to the standard he set throughout his career.Beyond personal choice, there is also a structural obstacle standing firmly in the way of any comeback. Brady is now a minority owner of the Las Vegas Raiders, a role that would legally prevent him from returning as an active NFL player unless he divested his stake. Combined with his lucrative broadcasting contract and growing business ventures, the logistics alone make a return highly unlikely.While comeback rumors may continue: especially in an era where quarterbacks are playing longer than ever, Brady has little left to prove. His comments feel less like a tease and more like a reflection of an athlete who knows exactly who he is and what he achieved.","Teams reportedly reached out after retirement to gauge tom brady's interest in returning.

“Both grown, why are people sweating”: 22 YO Eagles star Cooper DeJean is reportedly dating 42 YO WWE star Nikki Bella

Nikki Bella’s rumored dating scenario with Cooper DeJean brings up her former flame and WWE superstar John Cena



MLFootball recently dropped two photos of Philadelphia Eagles cornerback Cooper DeJean and WWE wrestler Nikki Bella , along with a caption/timeline of their reported relationship. It began when DeJean attended a WWE RAW event in Philadelphia with staffer Dom “Big Dom” DiSandro in August to see Bella, as WWE star Grayson Waller revealed.Then came NFL training camp, when the 40-year-old wrestler wore classic, custom-made Eagles attire and posed with Cooper on the gridiron. Months later, Bella posed in DeJean’s locker room. But obvious, people are beyond curious: Are Cooper DeJean and Nikki Bella dating? Maybe. Supposedly. Reportedly. There has been no official confirmation from either Cooper or Bella. Now, how is the cyberspace dealing with this circumstance? Let’s read on.“Oh wow. These young rich guys love a cougar,” reacted an X user. Nikki Bella is 42, and Cooper DeJean is 22, a 20-year age difference. Another user defended them, saying, “If they’re both grown, why are people sweating. Suddenly everyone is the age gap police.” A third user added, “Age is just a number when two adults are confident, accomplished, and living their own paths without limits or labels.” Another wanted them to be left alone: “Two grown adults.If they're dating let them live. Let them live.”Someone said people shouldn’t read too much into a photo: “It is just a photo. and if he is, he is. Both are legal adults.” One person stated, “This is none of our business.” Another speculated, “Two adults. Cooper probably grew up watching her and has now made a potential childhood fantasy a reality.” Finally, a user wrote, “They’re both adults. Age gaps always sound wild when reduced to a number, but context matters a lot more than headlines. ”On MLFootball’s recent X post about Bella and DeJean, a user mentioned Bella’s ex-fiancé, John Cena: “John Cena will not forgive you😭😭😭😭.” Nikki dated the WWE superstar from 2012 to 2018. They were engaged but reportedly called it off because they disagreed about having children. Later, Cena told TMZ he wanted to have kids.“I would love to be a dad,” Cena said. “And by the way, that’s an about-face for me, and I realize very much that I have been steadfast in saying that I don’t want children. But I’m a little bit older, a little bit wiser. At age 18, we say things different than at age 25, 35. I would love it, only because I dedicated my life to my work, and now I’m realizing that there is life and life exists, and it is beautiful. And I think part of that is being a parent. ”Cena married Shay Shariatzadeh in October 2020, and they agreed to live a child-free lifestyle as of late 2025.Bella married Artem Chigvintsev in August 2022 but filed for divorce in September 2024 after Artem’s domestic violence arrest.

David Pastrnak faces unrealistic expectations for 2026 Winter Olympics

David Pastrnak's 43 goals from the 2024-25 season

Also Read:

David Pastrnak continues proving he's the driving force behind the Boston Bruins' success. The right winger has posted 13 goals, 25 assists, and 38 points through 29 games this season, helping Boston sit second in the Atlantic Division and exceed preseason expectations.However, as the 2026 Winter Olympics approach, questions have emerged about whether Pastrnak can translate that dominance to international competition and carry Team Czechia to a medal.Czechia has shown recent success at lower-level international tournaments. The nation has finished with at least bronze in each of the three most recent World Junior Championships. At the senior World Championship, Czechia claimed first- and third-place finishes in two of the past four years.However, the Olympics represent an entirely different challenge. Expecting Czechia to reach the podium remains unrealistic despite Pastrnak's individual brilliance. The 29-year-old has been a major contributor on the international stage throughout his career.He's posted 45 points in 43 games at the World Championship and the 2016 World Cup of Hockey combined. That track record demonstrates his ability to produce against elite competition.But asking him to power the Czechs past favored Americans, Canadians, and Swedes represents a tall task.Those three nations will enter the tournament with significantly deeper rosters and more high-end talent throughout their lineups. Czechia's roster features some bright spots beyond Pastrnak. Martin Necas and Tomas Hertl should provide secondary scoring up front.Filip Hronek and Radko Gudas will anchor the defense, while Lukas Dostal brings excitement in goal as the likely starter. However, the depth falls off quickly after those core pieces. The Czechs will also rely on players currently outside the NHL, unlike Canada, the United States, and likely Sweden and Finland.That talent gap makes a medal extremely difficult to achieve. One advantage Czechia possesses is the lack of external pressure. The immense spotlight will shine on the traditional powerhouses expected to dominate. Pastrnak and his teammates can play freely without those same burdensome expectations weighing them down.Still, even if Pastrnak transformed into the second coming of Wayne Gretzky, vaulting over deeper and more talented teams ahead of them in the Olympic pecking order would remain a Herculean task. He'll face some of the planet's best defensemen and goaltenders throughout the tournament.The preliminary round includes a matchup against Canada in Group A, providing an immediate test against elite competition. By the time the Olympics conclude, Pastrnak should continue producing at a point-per-game pace on the international scene even if the medal proves elusive.If anyone can steer the dark horse to an unlikely podium finish, it will be him. That experience would prove valuable when he returns to help the Bruins rebound from last year's playoff miss.","David pastrnak has posted 13 goals, 25 assists, and 38 points through 29 games this season.

when the Milwaukee Bucks host the Toronto Raptors on December 18 at Fiserv Forum. The Bucks officially ruled him out with a right calf strain, leaving the team without its best player for another important home game.Milwaukee Bucks have struggled to stay steady without Giannis Antetokounmpo this season, and his absence again puts the pressure on a roster already dealing with several injuries. The Bucks are looking for consistency, while the Raptors arrive knowing this is a chance to take advantage of a weakened opponent.The injury happened earlier this month against the Detroit Pistons. Giannis went down just minutes into the game after a non-contact play while making a pass. He was quickly ruled out, and the Bucks have been cautious since.This calf issue is the latest in a series of lower-body problems. Earlier in the season, Giannis missed four games with a left adductor strain, and the current injury brings back memories of the calf trouble that limited him during last spring’s playoffs. When he has been available, he has played at his usual level, averaging 30.6 points, 10.7 rebounds, and 6.4 assists.Without him, the Bucks have gone 2–8, and those losses have piled up quickly.Milwaukee Bucks’ problems extend beyond Giannis, with several rotation players either out or uncertain for the game.With Giannis Antetokounmpo sidelined, the Milwaukee Bucks will rely more on role players to carry the workload. Ryan Rollins is expected to see extended minutes, and AJ Green could take on a larger role if he is cleared. Even so, the Bucks’ record without Giannis shows how difficult it has been to fill that gap.Toronto comes into the game missing RJ Barrett, who remains out with a right knee sprain and has now missed nine straight games.

New York Knicks vs Indiana Pacers Game Outlook (December 18, 2025)

The New York Knicks travel to Indianapolis on December 18, 2025, in good form and with a cleaner injury report than their opponent, though late changes are still possible. Indiana continues to deal with multiple long-term absences, while New York is monitoring a few rotation players. Health and availability could still shape the night.The New York Knicks are 18-7 and have won six straight games, building momentum after their NBA Cup title run. Indiana sits at 6-20 and has struggled to find consistency as injuries have forced constant lineup changes. New York is a small road favorite at around 3.5 points, a reflection of both recent performance and the difference in stability between the two teams.Even with the recent run, New York Knicks’ injury report is busy. Six players are listed, including Karl-Anthony Towns, OG Anunoby, and Josh Hart. Anunoby is questionable with a left knee contusion, while Hart is also questionable due to a rectus abdominal issue, two situations that matter for a team built around wing defense.The strain on depth is already showing. Miles McBride (ankle) and Landry Shamet (shoulder) have missed time, leading to heavier minutes for Jalen Brunson, Mikal Bridges, and Towns.Nothing is overwhelming on its own, but it does force the Knicks to manage minutes while trying to keep their flow.Even with the questions, New York Knicks still has clear scoring punch. Jalen Brunson is in a strong stretch, putting up about 37.5 points and six assists in recent games while hitting close to four threes a night. The offense continues to run through him, especially in the pick-and-roll.When Karl-Anthony Towns is available, he stretches the floor in ways Indiana struggles to handle, particularly with the Pacers already thin up front. Mikal Bridges ties things together, scoring within the flow, rebounding, moving the ball, and guarding the top perimeter threat. That role becomes even more important if OG Anunoby or Josh Hart can’t go at full strength.Indiana Pacers’ season changed the moment Tyrese Haliburton went down. He is out for the year after right Achilles surgery, leaving the Pacers without their primary ball handler and organizer. Since then, the offense has shifted to a shared approach built around Pascal Siakam and Bennedict Mathurin, with Andrew Nembhard taking on more creation than planned.The injuries don’t stop there. Obi Toppin is expected to miss at least three months with a right foot stress fracture. Aaron Nesmith is sidelined with a left MCL sprain, and Ben Sheppard is out with a left calf strain. The absences have taken away size, shooting, and defensive options, forcing Indiana to patch together lineups on most nights.With Haliburton sidelined and wing depth depleted, Indiana Pacers’ ability to contain Brunson is a major question. Nembhard has been dealing with left calf soreness and has carried questionable tags recently, often playing through discomfort. Behind him, Rick Carlisle is forced to juggle limited guard depth, leaning on patched-together lineups and hoping to generate enough on-ball resistance.Indiana Pacers’ injuries have changed how they play. What was once a fast, transition-heavy team is now more reliant on half-court sets built around Pascal Siakam. With several defenders out, opponents can pack the paint and dare Indiana’s secondary shooters to make shots. For New York, the possible absence of OG Anunoby and Josh Hart would soften perimeter defense and likely push the Knicks toward lineups that lean more on scoring.Overall, the matchup favors New York. Look for early actions involving Jalen Brunson and Karl-Anthony Towns, steady pressure at the rim, and kick-out threes to Mikal Bridges and others. Indiana’s chance rests on big games from Siakam and Bennedict Mathurin, Andrew Nembhard keeping the offense steady despite his limitations, and one extra player stepping up to keep the game close late.","The new york knicks are 18-7 and have won six straight games, building momentum after their nba cup title run. Indiana pacers sits at 6-20 and has struggled to find consistency as injuries have forced constant lineup changes. New york is a small road favorite at around 3.5 points, a reflection of both recent performance and the difference between the two teams.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126054420,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-114448,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"
