"Aaron Rodgers’ Steelers move confirmed after schedule drop, and he’s already staring down huge 2025 pressure",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/aaron-rodgers-steelers-move-confirmed-after-schedule-drop-and-hes-already-staring-down-huge-2025-pressure/articleshow/121236018.cms,"Aaron Rodgers has almost chosen to join the Steelers over retirement, setting up a high-stakes, challenging 2025 season opener.

Aaron Rodgers reportedly set to join Steelers: A late move that could change everything in Pittsburgh



In what could become one of the boldest moves of the 2025 NFL offseason, legendary quarterback Aaron Rodgers is reportedly set to join the Pittsburgh Steelers . After months of silence and speculation, the veteran appears ready to don the black and gold, possibly marking the final chapter of his illustrious career.NFL insider Tom Pelissero believes it’s no longer a matter of if, but when the deal will be made official.“I anticipate Aaron Rodgers is going to end up committing to play for the Pittsburgh Steelers. It’s a matter of when, not if. It has not changed.”Despite Rodgers remaining publicly quiet for weeks, Pittsburgh has continued to prepare behind the scenes as though he’s their man. Their offseason strategy left little doubt — passing on high-profile quarterback prospects like Shedeur Sanders in favor of Will Howard in the sixth round. It was a calculated move that reflected unwavering confidence in landing Rodgers. Notably, rumors suggest Rodgers had privately issued an ultimatum that may have influenced the decision to skip Sanders, who ultimately landed with the Cleveland Browns.The Steelers’ front office is reportedly comfortable waiting until the final moments before training camp to see Rodgers sign. The 40-year-old quarterback has never been a fan of early offseason workouts, and showing up in August would be nothing new for him.“We also know this about Aaron. He’s never liked offseason workouts. He’s never felt like those things were necessary here,” Pelissero added.Still, Pittsburgh would ideally prefer him to join earlier, allowing time to adapt to their offensive scheme and build chemistry with his new teammates. Among them is DK Metcalf, who trained with Rodgers earlier this offseason — a signal that both sides have been building toward this moment for some time.The quarterback room in Pittsburgh has become an intriguing battleground. Will Howard enters with hopes of earning the starting job after a standout run with Ohio State, while Mason Rudolph returns as a fan favorite following a solid stint with the Tennessee Titans. Yet, Rodgers’ arrival would likely place him atop the depth chart — a final chance to chase another ring with a team craving playoff success.Rodgers' previous campaign with the New York Jets was marked by decline, and with new head coach Aaron Glenn deciding to move on, the writing was on the wall. Ironically, his first test in a Steelers uniform will come against his former team in the 2025 season opener.While former Steelers QB Russell Wilson had aspirations of returning and reuniting with Metcalf, the team made it clear their sights were set elsewhere. Wilson is now with the New York Giants, leaving the door wide open for Rodgers to lead the franchise.A one-year deal is expected, and many believe this season will be Rodgers' final bow in the NFL. It’s a high-stakes gamble for Pittsburgh — but one rooted in faith in head coach Mike Tomlin’s leadership. Since taking over in 2007, Tomlin has never had a losing season, yet the Steelers haven’t won a playoff game since 2017.If Rodgers can spark one last postseason run, he could help restore the Steelers' glory and end his career on a powerful note. For now, all eyes are on Pittsburgh — and on when their next quarterback finally walks through the door.Also Read: Steelers-Jets Week 1 game may not be a coincidence—Aaron Rodgers possibly influenced NFL's Week 1 schedule","Nfl insider tom pelissero believes it’s no longer a matter of if, but when the deal will be made official.

Spain-Argentina blockbuster waits for security green light with World Cup looming



Spain’s newly crowned European champions and Lionel Messi’s Copa América-winning Argentina will collide in the Finalissima 2026 after FIFA penciled the intercontinental showcase into the international window of 23–31 March 2026. The decision, first revealed by Spanish daily Marca, creates a mouth-watering rematch of the 2022 spectacle in which Argentina swept aside Italy, and it places world football’s two reigning continental monarchs on a collision course barely 80 days before the expanded 48-team FIFA World Cup kicks off across North America.Federation Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) has selected the Finalissima (previously known as the European/South American Nations Cup or Artemio Franchi Cup) dates of March 23 and 31, 2026, for the match between Spain and Argentina.Although FIFA has booked the late-March date, ratification is pending confirmation in its final stages, subject to coordination with Mexico City host-country security authorities and the 2026 World Cup organizers, with the June 11 opening day for the 2026 World Cup in Mexico City. The Spanish newspaper Marca said FIFA will have to secure the nod from security authorities before playing this match, as the 2026 World Cup would be looming.Security partners' approval is the last formality before tickets, TV spots, and commercial endorsements pour onto the market, but fans can already mark late March 2026 for a heavyweight encounter. Delegates from CONMEBOL, UEFA, the Argentine Football Association (AFA), and the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) convened for the first time to plan the men's Finalissima, in which the title winners of the CONMEBOL Copa América 2024 and the UEFA EURO 2024 will face off. The meeting was held in Asunción, Paraguay, against the backdrop of the 75th FIFA Congress and saw representatives and authorities of the most powerful governing bodies of South American and European football converge. All major issues like institutional goals, organizational roles, planning logistics, competition timetables for both sides, and provisional dates for the game were addressed.Also read: Vancouver to stage 76th FIFA Congress before 2026 FIFA World Cup While Spain sharpens its master plan against the reigning world champions, Argentina's national team relies on championship memory.

VAR's decision on Dean Henderson's handball explained

Fans and experts react to the ruling

During the FA Cup final , Crystal Palace goalkeeper Dean Henderson created a lot of controversy by handling the ball outside of his penalty area while he was bringing down Manchester City's Erling Haaland , and not being given a red card. Now, an official statement gives reason to help clear things up.Dean Henderson rushed out to block a pass meant for Erling Haaland during the first half of the FA Cup final. TV replays showed he used his hand outside the penalty box, which many thought deserved a red card. Referee Stuart Attwell didn't call a foul, and VAR official Jarred Gillett agreed after checking. The VAR team said Haaland wasn't heading toward the goal, so there wasn't a clear chance of scoring.This decision upset many fans and experts who felt Henderson stopped a big moment. However, he stayed on the field and later saved a penalty kick from Omar Marmoush. The call showed how tricky it can be to decide what a goal-scoring chance is.

A pioneering voice in football journalism

A legacy of insight and integrity left by Brian Glanville

Aged 93, Brian Glanville , possibly the best ever football writer , died on 16 May 2025. In a career that lasted more than seven decades, Glanville applied intellectual rigor and forensic analysis to his coverage of football, notably during a long association with The Sunday Times .Born on 24 September 1931 in Hendon, Middlesex, Australia, Glanville was just 19 when he took his first steps into journalism, co-writing a biography of Arsenal legend Cliff Bastin. He became a prodigious journalist, novelist, and screenwriter, writing for the Sunday Times for 30 years and World Soccer magazine for more than 50. His work reached outside the United Kingdom, and his work garnered international praise, including from Sports Illustrated’s Paul Zimmerman, who hailed him as “the greatest football writer of all time.”Glanville has written several influential football books, including the definitive “The Story of the World Cup” and “The Puffin Book of Football.” He also wrote and scripted the 1967 World Cup documentary “Goal!” and even had plays and a musical put on. In his novel “The Dying of the Light,” he examined the post-retirement difficulties faced by a former football player, demonstrating an insight into the game’s effects on the lives of those who play it.Glanville, who never minced his words and had harsh words for several England managers, including Sir Alf Ramsey and Bobby Robson, still counted players from both England and other countries, including Bobby Moore, as friends. His criticism darted from a place of such deep love for the game and such a commitment to journalistic purity. He was also an early proponent of studying systems of play, such as catenaccio, and introduced British readers to modern European trends in soccer long before they were adopted as mainstream concepts.Glanville’s impact was not confined to his own writing. He was part of the jury that votes on the Ballon d’Or each year and was known for his generosity and approachability, treating young journalists and people he barely knew with warmth and respect.Also Read: Samuel Eto'o pays tribute to late Cameroonian football legend Emmanuel Kunde With the passing away of Brian Glanville, a curtain has fallen on an era of football journalism.

Poll Do you agree with Ashish Nehra's coaching approach for Siraj's out-swing deliveries? No, he should try something else Yes, it’s effective

IPL 2025: The unsung heroes of India's T20 league

NEW DELHI: Indian pacers Mohammed Siraj and Prasidh Krishna have played a key role in Gujarat Titans ' (GT) success during IPL 2025, accounting for wickets at regular intervals. While Siraj has picked 15 wickets so far this season, Krishna currently leads the wicket-taking chart, with 20 dismissals. The duo have benefitted from inputs shared by GT head coach Ashish Nehra as revealed by the team's veteran pacer Ishant Sharma.""Siraj already has experience in international cricket and understands his bowling. So, Nehra didn't try to tweak much. However, he noted that Siraj wasn't that confident about bowling out-swing deliveries and instead preferred to bowl with a wobble seam. So, Nehra told him, 'Your first ball will be an out-swinger. When the ball stops swinging, you can switch your approach to a wobble-seam delivery'. He's always urged Siraj to trust his out-swing,"" said Ishant Sharma on the 'Star Sports Press Room with Gujarat Titans around the race to the play-offs'.The veteran pacer further added that Nehra provided Prasidh feedback regarding the length at which he should be bowling.""Prasidh's natural length while bowling is 6 metres considering his height. Nehra told him, 'You have to push the length of your deliveries a little ahead. On red soil, you have to bowl four and a half metres. While bowling on black soil, it should be five to six metres',"" revealed Ishant.""Nehra further asked Prasidh to bowl a yorker once he was confident about the length of his deliveries. Our coach believes that there is nothing better than length bowling if the ball is being delivered accurately within the line of the stumps. There is only one thing which Ashu bhai wants bowlers to avoid which is unforced errors. He wants us to stick to the basics and make the batters hit the good deliveries,"" added the GT pacer.The Gujarat-based franchise was among the first few teams to resume training after the recent break in IPL 2025. Ishant shared an interesting anecdote showcasing the scenario and confusion at that point.""There was this perception that the IPL wouldn't be played with almost all international players going back. I told my manager, 'Please courier my luggage from Ahmedabad' as I had travelled back to Delhi. He responded that everyone is returning back to Ahmedabad. I also returned like the others,"" said Ishant.""As soon as we landed, everything changed. There was a 360-degree turnaround. We initially did a lot of fielding drills as a lot of catches were dropped during the practice sessions. The coach also put pressure on us,"" he added.Ishant further highlighted the work ethics of the GT setup, terming it ""insane"".""The manner in which GT practice is insane. We leave at 3 in the afternoon and return at 1 AM the next day. My wife has told me many times that we put in more effort while practicing on the ground than during the match,"" said the 36-year-old pacer.Catch Rajasthan Royals vs Punjab Kings at 3:30 PM, followed by Delhi Capitals vs Gujarat Titans at 7:30 PM tomorrow, May 18, as teams race to the TATA IPL play-offs — live and exclusive on JioHotstar and Star Sports Network","Indian pacers mohammed siraj and prasidh krishna have played a key role in gujarat titans'success during ipl 2025.

Chinnaswamy Stadium on Saturday.The toss, originally scheduled for the evening, has been delayed as heavy showers continued to sweep across Bengaluru.IPL officials took to the social media platform X to confirm the delay, stating: “Update: The toss has been delayed due to rain in Bengaluru. Stay tuned for further updates.”While fans are still holding onto hope for some cricketing action tonight, the match officials have set key timings in place.Overs will begin to be reduced if rain persists beyond 8:45 PM IST. However, there remains a reasonable window of opportunity for play; the cut-off time to begin a five-over game is 10:56 PM IST.If the rain relents before that, we could still witness a high-octane, shortened match between two playoff contenders.The stakes are particularly high for both teams. RCB, currently second on the points table with 16 points, need just one more win to secure a playoff berth and potentially finish in the top two, a crucial advantage in the knockout stages.Their recent form has been impressive, with four consecutive victories pushing them into serious title contention.For KKR, however, the situation is more desperate.

Bombay Sport Exchange Ep 5: Shane Watson on how IPL gave him a lifeline & his tribute to Phil Hughes

NEW DELHI: A teary-eyed Rohit Sharma turned into a grateful son on Friday as he thanked his parents in an emotionally charged voice before walking them onto the stage at Wankhede Stadium , where a stand bearing his name was officially unveiled. In that moment, Rohit wasn’t the cricketing superstar — he was a son acknowledging the countless sacrifices his parents had made to help him chase his dreams.""It's going to be even more special, to have my family here, parents, brother, wife. I am grateful and thankful for whatever they have sacrificed for me,"" Rohit said during the ceremony organised by the Mumbai Cricket Association .The 38-year-old then stood by, visibly moved, as his parents — Gurunath and Poornima Sharma — joined Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis to press the button that unveiled the Rohit Sharma Stand , accompanied by a burst of fireworks and a shower of confetti.Ritika Sajdeh, Rohit's wife, stood beside him, smiling proudly as she soaked in the emotional moment.Alongside Rohit, two other legends — former India captain Ajit Wadekar and former BCCI president Sharad Pawar — were also honoured with stands named after them at the stadium.For Rohit, the moment was a childhood dream come true — to be mentioned in the same breath as the greats of Indian cricket.He was clearly overwhelmed by the honour.""What is going to happen today, I have never dreamed of. As a kid growing up, I wanted to play for Mumbai, for India. For me to have my name amongst the greats of the game, I cannot express it in words.""This is also special as I am still playing. I have retired from two formats, but I am still playing one format,"" he said.Despite all that he has achieved in the sport, Rohit shared one more dream that still lingers.""It will be surreal when I play on 21st (for Mumbai Indians in IPL) and have a stand here, it will be special when I represent the country here,"" he added, hinting at his desire to play an ODI at the Wankhede.Rohit has already bid farewell to T20Is and Test cricket after a glittering international career. The Wankhede holds a special place in his heart — it’s where his cricketing aspirations began.""I had never dreamt of what was going to happen today. You try to achieve a lot of milestones, but something like this is really special, because Wankhede is an iconic stadium and so many memories have been made here,"" said Rohit.""Special thanks to Pawar Saheb and Devendra Fadnavis for making it very special, it's a very special day,"" he added.However, the India star quickly shifted gears into his usual team-first mindset, aware that the Mumbai Indians are still in the hunt for an IPL playoffs spot.""My special team MI is also here, waiting for my speech to be over and start training,"" he said with a smile.Later, Rohit's teammate and close friend Suryakumar Yadav paid a glowing tribute to the MI skipper.""Congratulations @rohitsharma45 on achieving incredible things on the cricket ground, from finisher to opener to our captain, you have been an inspiration and our pride, in every role.""Very rarely comes a leader who leads from the front, and changes the game for the better. You are that leader who has changed not just the game, but the approach, the attitude, the dressing room atmosphere, the team, and redefined the role of a captain.""Like I have said before, good things happen to good people, and you deserve it all and more. Wankhede just got even more iconic,"" Suryakumar wrote on Instagram shortly after the unveiling.Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis also lauded Rohit and extended support for future cricketing infrastructure in the city.""Our iconic batter, captain and one of my favourites, and one who mesmerizes with his batting is present here,"" the CM said.""If there is a proposal from MCA for a new stadium, we will allot space for that to accommodate more fans,"" he added.","Rohit sharma was honoured with a stand at the wankhede stadium on friday.

India’s golden boy of athletics, Neeraj Chopra , scripted history on Friday evening at the Doha Diamond League 2025 by breaching the elusive 90-metre barrier in men’s javelin throw for the first time in his career. The reigning world champion recorded a best throw of 90.23 metres, becoming only the 25th athlete in history to cross the prestigious mark. However, despite his personal milestone, Chopra had to settle for second place as Germany’s Julian Weber stole the show with a winning throw of 91.06 metres.Competing at the Qatar Sports Club Stadium , Neeraj got off to a brilliant start with a strong 88.44m throw in his very first attempt, which immediately put him in the lead. His second attempt was a foul, but he bounced back in style with his third — launching the javelin to a staggering 90.23 metres. That effort not only marked a career-best for Chopra but also made him the latest entrant in the elite 90m club, a mark considered the gold standard in javelin throwing.Julian Weber, however, had other plans. The German athlete, a consistent performer on the Diamond League circuit, saved his best for the day — unleashing a mighty 91.06m throw that edged out Chopra and earned him the top podium finish.Quiz: Who's that IPL player? The milestone comes at an exciting phase in Neeraj’s career. Now under the guidance of legendary coach Jan Zelezny a three-time Olympic champion and world record holder with a throw of 98.48m , Neeraj appears to be peaking just in time for a packed athletics season. This was Chopra’s first major competition of the year after switching coaches, and his performance in Doha will surely raise expectations ahead of the Olympics and other major events.Chopra’s feat adds him to an exclusive group of 25 javelin throwers worldwide who have thrown beyond 90 metres a club that includes greats like Zelezny himself, Johannes Vetter, Thomas Röhler, and Arshad Nadeem. The 90m throw has been achieved just 126 times in history, underlining the rarity and difficulty of the achievement.Although he didn’t win the event, Neeraj’s performance has reignited excitement among Indian sports fans and experts alike, signalling a new chapter in his illustrious journey. As one of the most decorated athletes in Indian history, Neeraj continues to push boundaries, and with the 90m milestone now conquered, his sights are firmly set on even bigger glories.This Doha meet was especially crucial as Chopra will not compete later this month due to the cancellation of the NC Classic 2025 in Bengaluru. With a statement performance in Qatar, he has laid down a strong marker for the rest of the season.A strong run from India’s Parul Chaudhary saw her set a new national record in the women’s 3000m steeplechase, clocking 9:13.39 to finish a commendable sixth in a high-quality field in Doha.With this performance, Chaudhary not only raised the national benchmark but also improved significantly on her 16th-place Diamond League debut in Eugene last year.",Neeraj chopra recorded a best throw of 90.23 metres at the doha diamond league 2025.

The IPL resumes on Saturday after a 10-day break caused by India-Pakistan border tensions, with Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) facing Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) in a crucial clash at M Chinnaswamy Stadium . RCB, second on the table with 16 points from 11 matches, need a win to secure a playoff berth, while sixth-placed KKR must win to keep their knockout hopes alive. The break disrupted both teams’ momentum — RCB were on a four-match winning streak, while KKR had won two of their last three.RCB appear better equipped to handle the restart, with skipper Rajat Patidar returning to nets after a finger injury and key overseas players like Phil Salt, Tim David, and Liam Livingstone back in the squad. However, injuries to Devdutt Padikkal and Josh Hazlewood remain concerns.The spotlight will be on Virat Kohli following his sudden Test retirement. Fans are expected to show support by wearing whites, though Kohli will rely on inner fire to deliver a strong performance.KKR's struggles lie in inconsistent batting, with only Ajinkya Rahane and Angkrish Raghuvanshi showing form. While their bowling unit has held firm, the absence of Moeen Ali due to illness adds to their challenges.The Chinnaswamy pitch has so far favoured the bowlers, offering unexpected assistance in the form of bounce for pacers and bite for spinners. However, the extended break and the onset of the monsoon may have altered its behaviour, prompting teams to reassess and adapt their strategies accordingly.Jacob Bethell, Virat Kohli, Devdutt Padikkal, Rajat Patidar (c), Jitesh Sharma (wk), Tim David, Krunal Pandya, Romario Shepherd, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Lungi Ngidi, Yash DayalImpact Sub: Suyash Sharma/Liam LivingstoneRahmanullah Gurbaz (wk), Sunil Narine, Ajinkya Rahane (c), Angkrish Raghuvanshi, Manish Pandey, Andre Russell, Rinku Singh, Ramandeep Singh, Harshit Rana, Vaibhav Arora, Varun ChakaravarthyImpact Sub: Anukul RoyThe IPL’s restart in Bengaluru may face weather disruptions, with thunderstorms and showers expected on Saturday evening.

NEW DELHI: A day after announcing his retirement from Test cricket, Indian batting legend Virat Kohli visited Vrindavan with his wife, Anushka Sharma , to seek guidance from the spiritual leader Premanand Maharaj. The couple visited Shri Hit Radha Keli Kunj Ashram in Vrindavan to receive blessings.Photos of Kohli and Anushka interacting with Premanand Maharaj in Vrindavan quickly went viral on social media.After leaving the ashram, Kohli was spotted exiting his car holding a Jaap counting machine . He waved to fans briefly before walking quietly into the airport.Kohli is set to take the field for Royal Challengers Bangalore in their IPL 2025 match against Kolkata Knight Riders on Saturday.On Monday, Kohli announced his retirement from Test cricket, marking the end of a stellar career in the longest format. He played 123 Tests for India, amassing 9,230 runs at an average of 46.85, including 30 centuries.As captain, Kohli led India to 40 wins in 68 Tests, the most by any Indian skipper to date.Former India coach Ravi Shastri described Kohli as “mentally fried and overcooked” due to constant public scrutiny. While surprised by Kohli’s decision to retire, Shastri believed the star batter still had two to three years left in Test cricket.Shastri also revealed that he had spoken to Kohli shortly before the announcement was made public.""I did speak to him about it, I think a week before that [his announcement] and his mind was very clear that he'd given us everything. There were no regrets,"" Shastri told The ICC Review.""Virat surprised me because I thought he had at least two-three years of Test match cricket left in him. But then, when you're mentally fried and overcooked, that's what tells your body. You might be physically the fittest guy in the business.""You might be fitter than half the guys in your team, but mentally you're well done, as they say, then it sends a message to the body. You know, that's it,"" he said.Opening up on their conversation, Shastri said Kohli's infectious personality and the constant spotlight he was under contributed to a burnout.""He's got accolades around the globe. He has a bigger following than any other cricketer in the last decade. Whether it's Australia, whether it's South Africa, he just got people to watch the game. There was a love-hate relationship.""They would get angry because he had the ability to get under the skin of the viewers. In the way he celebrated, you know his intensity was such that it was like a rash.""It spread very quickly, not just within the dressing room, but within living rooms as well for people watching cricket.

Ryan Chesley’s signing signals new beginning for Washington’s defense



Chesley’s experience and pro debut highlight Capitals’ defensive future



The Washington Capitals have taken a significant step toward strengthening their defensive future by signing rising star Ryan Chesley to a three-year entry-level contract. With the 2025-26 season marking the start of his NHL journey, Capitals fans and hockey analysts alike are watching closely to see if Chesley can develop into the reliable, shutdown defenseman the franchise desperately needs. This move reflects Washington’s commitment to investing in young talent as they look to balance a competitive roster with long-term potential.Selected 37th overall in the 2022 NHL Draft, Ryan Chesley has steadily built an impressive and well-rounded resume through his collegiate career at the University of Minnesota and his early professional exposure with the Hershey Bears in the American Hockey League (AHL). The 21-year-old defenseman’s newly signed three-year contract carries an average annual NHL salary of $923,333, along with a corresponding AHL salary, clearly signaling the Capitals’ strong belief in his future potential and impact on their roster.Chesley’s development at Minnesota showcased his versatile two-way ability — consistently contributing 38 points while maintaining a strong defensive presence, reflected in a remarkable plus-minus rating of +34 over 115 NCAA games. Notably, he excelled in blocked shots and took on key leadership roles, qualities that NHL teams highly value in young defensemen striving to make the leap to the professional level.Adding to his credentials, Chesley’s international experience further enhances his profile, having represented the United States twice at the prestigious IIHF World Junior Championships .

Chris Olave linked to Steelers as trade rumors heat up

Steelers are trying for Chris Olave but deal is not close yet

The Pittsburgh Steelers have already made two high-profile moves this offseason with wide receivers. They first traded for DK Metcalf from the Seattle Seahawks. They then traded George Pickens to the Dallas Cowboys. Now, it appears they may not be finished. The team is reportedly eyeing trading for another star, New Orleans Saints receiver Chris Olave .The Steelers began by acquiring a dominant wideout. They sent a second-round pick and a later pick trade to acquire DK Metcalf in March. Weeks after, they sent George Pickens to Dallas. That transaction acquired them a third-round pick in 2026 as well as a future late-round trade.With Metcalf on board as their best wide receiver, the team is a bit improved at the top, but their depth is still lacking. They do have veteran Robert Woods, who does not get much playing time but is primarily recognized for blocking and leadership. Calvin Austin had potential last year but isn't ready for an outside full-time role. Rookie Roman Wilson is still without a track record.Which means the Steelers will probably do one more thing. On his radio show, Pittsburgh radio personality Adam Crowley said the next suspect is Saints phenom Chris Olave. He tweeted out the name ""Chris Olave"" and then followed up by saying that someone close to the situation texted him the name.Kevin Adams of Barstool Sports also broke the story. He supplied more information, indicating, ""Trying. Interested. But not close."" That translates to the Steelers are making an effort, but it is not even close to being finished.If they can get Olave, it would be a big signing. Although Olave sat out time with a concussion last year, he was great in 2023. He caught 87 passes for more than 1,100 yards that season. He's the type of receiver who can do everything short passes, deep passes, and all things in between. He'd complement Metcalf, who is more suited for deep, run-after-catch plays.Adding Olave would provide the Steelers with two high-level receivers and a significant boost to their offense. It would also assist quarterback Russell Wilson or Justin Fields, whichever one wins the starting job, by providing them with more weapons.Also Read: Aaron Rodgers Leaves NFL Fans Guessing As Steelers Await Blockbuster Decision That Could Shake Up The League","Pittsburgh steelers have already made two high-profile moves this offseason with wide receivers.
