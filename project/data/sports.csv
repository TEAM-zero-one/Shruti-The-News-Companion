Trey Benson latest injury update: Could the Cardinals finally unleash their most explosive young playmaker in Week 13?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/trey-benson-latest-injury-update-could-the-cardinals-finally-unleash-their-most-explosive-young-playmaker-in-week-13/articleshow/125565992.cms,"Trey Benson (via Getty Images)

Trey Benson’s recovery progress and why Arizona needs him back on the field

Trey Benson’s 2025 campaign was supposed to be the year the Cardinals finally saw what he could do in a featured role as the starting running back. Instead, injuries have kept the backfield in constant flux. Benson stepped in as the starter after James Conner suffered a season-ending injury, only to go down with a knee hiccup in his very first start.Since then, Arizona has cycled through Emari Demercado, Bam Knight, and Michael Carter with limited success. With Benson back practising and his return window officially opened, Week 13 against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers may be the first real chance for the Cardinals to reset their rushing attack and evaluate whether Benson can be a foundational piece moving forward.Trey Benson returned as a limited participant in practice last week, a promising sign considering Arizona held him out against the Jaguars for precautionary reasons. With Emari Demercado also sidelined, the Cardinals leaned on their heavy hitters, Michael Carter and Bam Knight, but the results underscored just how thin the position group has become.No Arizona running back has surpassed an “80” in PFSN’s Impact Rankings all year, which is a reflection of both the unit’s inconsistency and the void left by Conner and Benson.Carter’s 78.5 in Week 6 remains the high-water mark. What Benson offers is a combination of burst, vision, and power that the current rotation simply lacks.His 4.6 yards per carry as a rookie is an efficient feat, and he elevated that to an impressive 5.5 yards per attempt in limited action this season. Even though his lone start ended prematurely, those numbers make a compelling case for giving him a full workload once he’s cleared. At 3-8 and effectively removed from the playoff picture, Arizona’s priority now shifts toward player development and future roster construction.Getting Benson back is not just about stabilising the offence; it’s about gathering real data on whether he can anchor the backfield beyond 2025. If healthy, he is expected to reclaim the starting job immediately, offering the Cardinals a much-needed opportunity to evaluate his ceiling over the final stretch of the season.Also read: Will Trey Benson play against the Tennessee Titans today?

Two-Time Stanley Cup Champ calls on Matthews to lead the way





Can The Maple Leafs Save This Season? | JD Bunkis Podcast

The Toronto Maple Leafs are enduring one of their roughest starts in years, sitting at the bottom of the Atlantic Division and Eastern Conference with a 9-10-3 record. Seven losses in their last eight games have turned frustration into urgency, and now the spotlight is fixed on captain Auston Matthews as the franchise looks for direction. He has been sidelined for five games with a lower-body injury, yet the conversation around him has only intensified, raising questions about leadership, responsibility, and competitive fire.Matthews returned to the ice for practice on Monday, offering hope that he may rejoin the lineup against the Columbus Blue Jackets. With only 14 points across 17 games before the injury, his season has not reflected the dominance expected from him. This is why recent public commentary from those who understand championship pressure has added greater weight to the moment.Kris Versteeg, who lifted the Stanley Cup twice with the Blackhawks, didn’t hold back when discussing Matthews on the “JD Bunkis” Podcast. Versteeg said, “Matthews coming back… if you’re Matthews, you’re a player, this is kinda a moment that you got put the team on your back and take them back.Because everyone is talking about Marner, is the guy, this is the reason this team isn’t winning, or this reason.”This isn’t a casual observation. Versteeg has lived through pressure moments and thrived in them. His challenge to Matthews goes beyond scoring goals. It speaks to attitude, accountability, and taking ownership of the team’s trajectory. With Mitch Marner no longer in Toronto after his sign-and-trade move to the Vegas Golden Knights, the dynamics have shifted. Marner was a fixture in Toronto for nine seasons, and his absence continues to be a point of debate among fans and analysts.Versteeg wants Matthews to move past that conversation and become part of the solution. “So, why not part of the success, why not be a guy that get little big pissed off, put the team on your back and take them back and get yours out of the ditch,” he said. He pushed the point further with another line of emphasis: “For him (Matthews) to come in and play his best hockey ever, put the team on his back and start to show when he is engaged, when he is top of the game, he can carry a hockey club. ”Even with Marner still on the roster, Versteeg believes the deeper problem wouldn’t vanish. The Leafs are facing an identity issue that stretches across the ice sheet. What they need now is someone to seize the moment and make players believe again.Toronto’s season is far from over. The standings can still shift. The only question now is whether star player Auston Matthews will answer the call and lead the climb back into playoff contention.Also Read: Canucks goalie Kevin Lankinen suddenly steps away from team: Why his absence could reshape Vancouver’s season","Two-time stanley cup champion urges auston matthews to carry the maple leafs through turbulent eastern conference storm.

‘ Popcorn Kid ’ becomes instant Suns arena sensation



Sterling’s dad, Christopher, reacts to his son’s unexpected fame



A three-year-old fan named Sterling has turned a pair of Phoenix Suns games into viral moments after his shy stare at the Jumbotron sparked a wave of online affection. The toddler, now known nationwide as the “Popcorn Kid,” first caught fans’ attention during the Suns-Pacers matchup on November 13, when he peeked up from a bucket of popcorn bigger than his head and smiled at the camera. That video exploded online, topping 50 million views and transforming him into an overnight favorite among NBA fans.When Sterling returned to Mortgage Matchup Center for the Suns’ game against the Minnesota Timberwolves on November 21, the arena crowd welcomed him like a returning celebrity. The team leaned into the moment, placing him on the Jumbotron again as fans roared in recognition. It marked the second time in eight days that a simple courtside moment from the toddler managed to outshine the action on the floor.During his return appearance, the arena screens flashed a message reading, “Look who’s in the house,” before cutting to Sterling in his seat. This time, he was ready. The little fan had a soda cup in one hand, a giant popcorn bucket on his lap, and a confident wink for the camera.A game announcer hyped the moment, saying, “The cutie pie who won America’s hearts with a simple smile when attending his first Suns game... 50 million views across social media, please welcome back Sterling and his entire family!” The arena then erupted as every fan in his section received free popcorn.Sterling embraced the spotlight throughout the night. The Suns gifted him a jersey and a foam finger, and he made his way courtside for an up-close look at warmups. Fans recorded clips and posted them across social platforms, giving him yet another wave of viral attention.For Sterling’s father, Christopher, the whirlwind has been surreal. “We went to the game, went on vacation. And on our way home, we started getting text messages,” he said. “I don’t have any social media. So my wife had to create a TikTok account just to watch the video.”He said the reaction stunned their entire family. “And I mean, just everyone reaching out. ‘That’s you? That’s Sterling! That’s you. What’s going on?’ And so we still didn’t know what that really meant... So exciting, I think. Scary. Everything. But he’s been a champ. He’s been doing really well with it.”Christopher added that Sterling’s charm is nothing new. “It’s just like so natural,” he said, noting that the Suns’ hospitality made the experience even more meaningful. With five children, a smooth outing isn’t easy, but the warm welcome helped ease the chaos. He laughed as he thanked fans for their patience, saying some people had even endured popcorn being tossed their way.Also Read: Who was Jaiquawn Jay? 14-year-old student tragically passed away during basketball practice","Three-year-old fan named sterling has turned a pair of phoenix suns games into viral moments.

Drake London’s Week 13 chances and what the Falcons may decide

Drake London hurt his knee on Sunday, November 17, 2025, during the Atlanta Falcons game in Atlanta against the Carolina Panthers. After the game, head coach Raheem Morris said that tests showed a PCL sprain, and he called Drake London a “week-to-week” player. This means the team must check him every few days to see how he feels.The Falcons also lost their starting quarterback Michael Penix Jr., who suffered a partially torn ACL in the same game and has been ruled out for the rest of the season. This puts even more pressure on the team as they move toward Week 13, and fans want to know if Drake London will return on time.NFL Network reporter Tom Pelissero said on Monday, November 18, 2025, that Drake London’s PCL injury can be “tricky” and needs careful rest.He also explained that if the Falcons fall further in the playoff race, the team may use a safer plan and wait longer before bringing London back.Pelissero did not say it directly, but this could even mean holding him out for more than one game if needed.Raheem Morris also shared a clear update on Drake when he said, “You never know, Drake could come back tomorrow and feel a lot better, but we will see how his knee reacts.”His comment shows that the Atlanta Falcons are not sure yet, and they will watch Drake London closely this week.His Week 13 condition will be best indicated by the Atlanta Falcons' first injury report, which will be released on Wednesday in Atlanta.This year, Drake London has been among the most crucial players for the team. He was a vital element of the passing offense and had impressive stats before his injuries.Should Drake London not be ready for Week 13, the Atlanta Falcons could depend more on Kirk Cousins, Kyle Pitts, Bijan Robinson, and Darnell Mooney now without Michael Penix Jr.Drake London is not expected to play in Week 13 based on all the reports from Tom Pelissero and Raheem Morris unless he shows remarkable development really quickly. The team will wait, watch, and pick the most secure plan for him.Also Read: Madison Beer Opens Up About The Style Glow-Up She Discovered After Dating Justin Herbert","Drake london hurt his knee on sunday, november 17, 2025, during the atlanta falcons game in atlanta against the carolina panthers.

Detroit Red Wings defenseman Ben Chiarot has landed in serious trouble, as the NHL has imposed a fine of $5K on the defenseman, the maximum allowed under the collective-bargaining agreement. It actually happened for attacking the New Jersey Devils’ young defenseman Simon Nemec with the butt-end of his hockey stick.The incident happened in Monday’s game when the Devils beat the Red Wings 4–3. The moment came late in the third period, just after a goal scored by the Red Wings’ centre Dylan Larkin. The two teams engaged in a scrum, and during that, Chiarot delivered the butt-end.Ben Chiarot’s performance this season has been good. Through 22 games, he has recorded 2 goals, 4 assists, 45 blocked shots, and 49 hits, along with a +5 rating.

Connor McDavid’s playing status in Dallas Stars at Edmonton Oilers



The Edmonton Oilers enter tonight’s matchup facing one of the Western Conference’s most structured squads in the Dallas Stars. As the Oilers try to strengthen their push for consistency, the major storyline centers around whether Connor McDavid will be available. His impact extends far beyond scoring. As his transition game, speed, and ability to dictate the pace can completely shift Edmonton’s offensive rhythm.Dallas, meanwhile, comes in with momentum of its own. Thus, relying on a disciplined system and strong defensive play. Facing an Oilers team that thrives on elite-level skill. The Stars could benefit greatly if McDavid is limited or unavailable. With both sides needing points, McDavid’s status becomes the central focal point ahead of puck drop.While Edmonton has yet to confirm McDavid’s final availability, the Oilers coaching staff has expressed optimism about his readiness. McDavid, who has been managing minor discomfort over the past week, participated in the morning skate with full contact. That participation suggests he is trending toward playing unless a last-minute setback occurs.If McDavid suits up, Edmonton gains a massive advantage in transition, power-play efficiency, and puck possession.His chemistry with Leon Draisaitl and Evan Bouchard has been a major catalyst in the Oilers’ offensive surge this season. Without him, the Oilers would need more depth contributions from Ryan Nugent-Hopkins and Zach Hyman to compensate for the loss of elite playmaking.For Dallas, preparing for two versions of the Oilers, one with McDavid and one without, creates a major tactical difference. With McDavid active, the Stars’ defensive zone coverage must tighten around the slot. Without him, Dallas can deploy more aggressive forechecking and lean on their depth to dictate pace.Also Read: NHL injury update: Charlie McAvoy ruled out as Boston Bruins face setback","Connor mcdavid's playing status in dallas stars at edmonton oilers game is a major storyline.

Former Toronto Maple Leafs defenseman Jay Rosehill criticizes the team following disappointing results

Should The Maple Leafs Make A Coaching Change? | Real Kyper & Bourne

Also read:

Frustration around the Toronto Maple Leafs is reaching a boiling point, as prominent NHL analysts are calling for the organization to part ways with head coach Craig Berube amid a slump in performance. The Toronto Maple Leafs have no shortage of talent, experience, or expectations; however, somehow, the strategy for the game is not working.Speaking about the Maple Leafs’ situation, former Toronto Maple Leafs defenseman Jay Rosehill delivered a scathing assessment of the team’s current mindset, accusing the roster of lacking pride, grit, and even the basic level of accountability he sees in youth hockey players. Let’s take a look at what the Maple Leafs defenseman had to say about his team.Former Toronto Maple Leafs defenseman Jay Rosehill has heavily criticized the Maple Leafs for displaying disappointing efforts this season. Speaking during a recent media appearance, Rosehill said the Maple Leafs have shown little resilience during their latest stretch of disappointing results.Drawing from his experience coaching young athletes, he argued that even children learning the sport demonstrate more pushback and willingness to fight through adversity than the current Leafs lineup.Expressing his frustration, Rosehill said, “They’re so mentally weak, man.” Rosehill said. “Nobody’s inspired on that team… They don’t give the bare minimum, which I just can’t handle.” He also criticized multiple players for quitting on plays, avoiding responsibilities in critical moments, and failing to respond when games begin slipping away.Again, another NHL analyst has also shared his deepest concern for the team, and asked the team to part ways with the head coach Craig Berube. On The Justin Bourne Show, Justin Bourne expressed deep concern about Toronto’s miserable situation, questioning both the team’s management and leadership under head coach Craig Berube.He stated, ""I personally do think that a different coach would move the needle. I do not think he is a bad coach. I do think a different coach for this group would be great. I think, you know, a new voice and a new strategy, this game plan is not working here for this team. And I don't care how hard you press the try harder button, it's not going to work.""Meanwhile, Craig Berube was also out of answers when his team fell 5-2 to the rival Montreal Canadiens on Saturday night, losing for the seventh time in eight games, losing their Stanley Cup aspirations gradually. With frustration intensifying among analysts, fans, and former players, the Maple Leafs face mounting pressure, and it's high time the team really needs to find solutions quickly.","Former toronto maple leafs defenseman jay rosehill has heavily criticized the team for displaying disappointing efforts this season.

By 2025, Thornton’s net worth is estimated at $60 million. This is a figure built on over two decades of NHL excellence and endorsement earnings. His enduring presence as a fan favorite both on and off the ice.Thornton entered the NHL under immense pressure after being selected first overall by the Boston Bruins in the 1997 NHL Draft. Standing 6'4"" with rare passing instincts and elite hockey IQ, Thornton quickly began to carve out his identity as one of the league’s most dynamic players. His rookie contract, along with early salary increases, led to his stability in income. These laid the foundation for earnings that would eventually accumulate to more than $111 million in NHL salary alone throughout his 24-season career.Joe's early years in Boston showcased flashes of brilliance. By the early 2000s, Thornton grew into an important part, serving as team captain. However, the defining moment of his career came in the 2005–06 season when the Bruins traded him to the San Jose Sharks in a blockbuster deal.Thornton responded with one of the most iconic seasons in NHL history. He became the first player ever to win both the Hart Memorial Trophy (league MVP) and Art Ross Trophy (scoring title) while playing for two different teams in the same season.Beyond salary and other perks, Thornton’s on-ice accomplishments further shaped his legacy. With over 1,500 career points and more than 1,100 assists, he ranks among the NHL’s all-time leaders in both categories. His distinctive style of slowing the game down, controlling play from behind the net, and threading impossible passes made him one of the most influential centers of his generation. His leadership, charisma, and trademark beard only added to his iconic status.Internationally, Thornton has been a consistent presence for Team Canada, earning gold medals at the 2010 Winter Olympics, the 2004 World Cup, and the 1997 World Junior Championships. Even as he transitioned into late-career roles with the Toronto Maple Leafs and Florida Panthers, Thornton continued to showcase his passion, experience, and mentorship abilities. His reduced salaries during these final seasons did little to diminish the tremendous financial and cultural legacy he built.By the end of the year 2025, Joe Thornton’s $60 million net worth reflects not just his earnings but also a career defined by excellence, longevity, and the respect of the hockey world. As a future Hall of Famer, his legacy continues to shine long after his final NHL shift.Also Read: Joe Thornton officially joins San Jose Sharks as Player Development Coach","By 2025, joe thornton’s net worth is estimated at $60 million.

Kevin Durant’s fatherhood rumor sparks buzz

Kevin Durant’s private life in spotlight as fans react to new rumor

Houston Rockets remain unstoppable despite star player’s break

NBA star Kevin Durant will not be playing in the next two games for the Houston Rockets, the team has confirmed. The reason given is a family matter, and no further details have been shared yet. Durant’s absence has quickly become a major talking point among fans. Many supporters were also surprised by the announcement, which immediately sparked discussions across social media.The timing of his break has created even more interest among fans. The two games he will miss are against the Phoenix Suns and the Golden State Warriors, the two teams that he played for in the past. Because of this, some fans joked online that Durant might be trying to avoid facing his former franchises. But many also believe that something more serious could be happening.A well-known Suns radio reporter, John Gambadoro, mentioned on his show that someone told him that Durant might be becoming a father. However, he clearly said this is not his report, and it has not been confirmed by any major news outlets. So far, it remains only a rumor, and there is no proof that this is the reason behind his absence.“Bros sacred to face his own team,” one user wrote.“My heart skipped a beat I thought he got injured”, another added. “You people are weird asf, just hope that everything is good with his family, they are small and close family”, another one said. Fans all over social media are also worried and sending good wishes to Durant.NBA fans on social media have reacted with mixed opinions. Many do not believe the rumor, especially since Durant has stayed single for many years. His last known relationship was with Monica Wright, with whom he was engaged in 2013. They separated in 2014, and Durant has not shared details of his private life since then. Some fans still say he may have a private relationship, because athletes often keep their personal matters private and out of the public eye, leaving room for speculation among fans.The Houston Rockets are doing well this season, with a 10-4 record and sitting in the top four of the Western Conference. Even if they lose the upcoming games, the team probably won’t fall much in the rankings. Durant will surely be missed on the court, but the Rockets are confident they can continue to compete. And until the full reason for Durant’s break becomes clear, fans and media will have to wait. Whatever he is dealing with, the team and fans can only hope it is something positive, and not something worrying.Also Read: Kevin Durant shares a heartfelt shoutout to his hometown rapper after new music release","Nba star kevin durant will not be playing in the next two games for the houston rockets.

Mikko Rantanen’s playing status in Edmonton Oilers at Dallas Stars



The Dallas Stars approach tonight’s meeting with the Edmonton Oilers looking to maintain their strong position in the conference standings. With a balanced roster and one of the league’s most effective power plays. Dallas aims to exploit any defensive gaps the Oilers present. However, much of their offensive versatility. That depends on the availability of forward; Mikko Rantanen.Rantanen, one of the NHL’s most dynamic wingers. He has been central to Dallas’ scoring production this season. Even all for opposing teams. As the Stars prepare for the Oilers’ top-heavy attack, Rantanen’s presence becomes even more crucial in countering Edmonton’s offensive firepower.Rantanen’s status has been under watch after he sustained minor soreness during the Stars’ previous outing. While he joined team activities during morning practice, his workload was limited. The Dallas coaching staff indicated that a game-time decision is likely, as they want to avoid aggravating anything ahead of a heavy schedule stretch.If Rantanen plays, he immediately boosts the Stars’ top line, especially alongside Jason Robertson and Wyatt Johnston.His ability to control the pace on power plays and create passing lanes adds significant unpredictability to Dallas’ offensive schemes. Without him, the Stars must rely more heavily on depth scoring.Dallas operates one of the league’s most efficient power-play units, and Rantanen’s presence on the half-wall is essential. His puck distribution and ability to draw defenders open shooting lanes for teammates.His absence would shift responsibilities to secondary wingers, potentially reducing overall scoring pressure.For the Edmonton Oilers, Rantanen’s potential absence shifts defensive matchups. Edmonton can allocate more resources toward containing Jason Robertson. And focus on pushing pace through transition. However, if Rantanen plays, the Oilers’ defensive structure must stay disciplined, especially around the slot and boards where Rantanen thrives.Also Read: NHL injury update: Charlie McAvoy ruled out as Boston Bruins face setback","Mikko rantanen’s status has been under watch after he sustained minor soreness during the stars’ previous outing.

Kysre Gondrezick explains why she picks Caitlin Clark over Sue Bird



Angel Reese’s former Chicago Sky teammate, Kysre Gondrezick, has sparked a new round of debate in the basketball world. She openly backed Caitlin Clark over WNBA legend Sue Bird when asked who would win a hypothetical 1v1 duel. The former Sky guard appeared on “7 PM in Brooklyn,” a podcast hosted by Carmelo Anthony. When presented with the matchup, Gondrezick did not hesitate. Her response has since gone viral among WNBA fans.Gondrezick’s support for Clark has created a buzz because few would pick the young star over a four-time champion like Bird. Clark, known for her shooting and confidence, has become one of the most exciting players in the league. Still, choosing her over Bird, who has played 19 seasons for the Seattle Storm came as a shock! Gondrezick, however, explained her reasoning clearly and praised Clark’s scoring mentality.During the podcast, co-host Kazeem Famuyide asked Kysre Gondrezick who she would take in a 1v1 between Caitlin Clark and Sue Bird. Gondrezick answered instantly, “I’m taking Caitlin,” she said.She explained why she believes Clark has the edge.“The reason why I say Caitlin is that she is a scoring point guard. Sue has mastered being a facilitator, and she makes her shots when it is important. But Caitlin’s confidence. She comes off as ‘I’m shooting first,’ I’m taking her because of her scoring mentality, it comes instinctively for her”, Gondrezick said.Her comments surprised many fans, considering Bird is one of the greatest players in WNBA history. She averaged 11.7 points, 2.5 rebounds and 5.6 assists per game during her 19-year career. Yet Gondrezick still chose Clark for a scoring-focused scenario. She did, however, pick Diana Taurasi when asked about a similar matchup between Taurasi and Clark.Meanwhile, Clark and Angel Reese are set to join forces again. Both players were selected for the Team USA training camp roster. The camp will run from December 12 to 14 at Duke University. It includes 18 players such as Juju Watkins, Paige Bueckers, Cameron Brink, Aliyah Boston and Brittney Griner.Clark has been out of the game since July due to injuries but still managed to average 16.5 points and 8.8 assists in her sophomore season.Also Read: Caitlin Clark turns heads as she cheers for her boyfriend, Connor McCaffery’s team Butler Bulldogs, against South Carolina Gamecocks",Kysre gondrezick appeared on a podcast hosted by carmelo anthony.

Hal Steinbrenner says the Los Angeles Dodgers’ spending and success are creating a gap

Hal Steinbrenner shared strong thoughts on Monday in New York after the Los Angeles Dodgers won the 2025 World Series in Toronto. The New York Yankees owner said the Dodgers look “far ahead” of other clubs because they keep winning and keep signing top players at every position. He said their roster of former MVPs, Cy Young winners, and young stars makes the talent gap very wide across Major League Baseball.Hal Steinbrenner also spoke about the Dodgers’ spending power. He said the Dodgers, valued at $6.9 billion by Forbes, spent heavily in the last two offseasons and turned that money into back-to-back championships. He said it feels like the Dodgers “are pulling away from the other 29 teams,” including his own New York Yankees.During his Monday interview in New York, Hal Steinbrenner praised the Los Angeles Dodgers for staying strong even after long injury spells during the 2025 season.He said the Dodgers “got healthy at the right time” and used their deep lineup to beat the Toronto Blue Jays in the 2025 Fall Classic held in Toronto.Hal Steinbrenner then shared why he is worried. He said, “Of course it’s a concern. They have tremendous resources, and they got the job done.”He added that the way the Dodgers keep adding major stars makes other teams feel like they cannot keep up.His comments also added to the common belief that the Dodgers are using money to keep winning championships.Even Dodgers manager Dave Roberts joked before the 2025 World Series began by saying, “Let’s ruin baseball.” His remark showed that the team knows people see them as the strongest financial force in MLB.Hal Steinbrenner was also asked on Monday why the New York Yankees plan to cut their payroll to around $300 million for the 2026 season.He said the club is barely making profits and that high spending does not always bring results. To explain this, he mentioned the New York Mets’ 2025 season, when the Mets had one of the biggest payrolls but still missed the playoffs.Hal Steinbrenner said, “There was nothing low about my payroll and the Mets’ payroll, and look where we ended up.” He said championships come when players perform well on the field, not only when teams spend more money.Also Read: Colorado Rockies Bet Big On Warren Schaeffer As Full-Time Manager After Disastrous 2025 Campaign","Dodgers face heat as hal steinbrenner warns $6.9b team is widening mlb’s talent gap.

The question that has been posed by fans, players, and the media for almost all of NBA history is that ""Who is the greatest player of all time?"" Now, recently, NBA legend Dwyane Wade, one of the greatest guards in basketball history, offered his opinion on the argument between Michael Jordan and LeBron James.The Miami Heat Hall of Famer made it obvious who his all-time favorites are, despite the fact that it is a subjective topic with no definite solution. The three-time champion listed his all-time favorite players, in no specific order, on his podcast, Time Out with Dwyane Wade. When asked to comment on the argument, he had an interesting reaction.Michael Jordan and LeBron James are two of the names most frequently brought up in the ""GOAT"" discussion. Now, D-Wade offered his thoughts on the entire discussion.However, in the recent appearance, he did it in a somewhat diplomatic manner. During the same, he said:""Michael Jordan is my basketball GOAT, mine personally, for all the reasons he should be. But I do have a new answer for how I'm gonna start answering this for when people ask me. I'm going to say Michael Jordan is the greatest player I've ever watched. He is the greatest player I've ever watched.LeBron James is the greatest player I've ever seen.""Wade had a close-up look at LeBron. With MJ, he never understood that. He has therefore chosen to categories them in a different way. He continued:“I never saw Michael Jordan.. I watched Michael Jordan. I saw and I've seen LeBron James up close. I played against and played with (James). I personally have not seen a greater basketball player, but I've watched a great basketball player.""Now, this diplomatic answer confused the fans who later took to X to express their opinion on the same.One said “pick a side ni**a.” Another user also urged him, “What? Man just pick one and call it a day bro.” Additionally, another one said, “the ultimate non-response..”Meanwhile, a fourth user said “translation: “MJ is the greatest player I’ve never played with, LBJ is the greatest player I’ve ever played with”, another one said, “Ni**a basically said LeBron is the greatest he ever PLAYED with. He won't say that though. Lol..” and a sixth user said, “translation: i didn't want to hurt Lebron's feelings by saying Jordan is the GOAT again..”Wade knows more about LeBron. Additionally, he never played with a better player. On the other hand, Wade, who was raised in Chicago, is also unable to leave Jordan. Hence, his answer left fans with more questions than answers.Also read: Dwyane Wade's wife Gabrielle Union honors Hollywood legend Diane Keaton after her shocking death, sharing powerful quotes","Nba legend dwyane wade offered his opinion on the argument between michael jordan and lebron james.

And I don't care how hard you press the try harder button, it's not going to work.""Meanwhile, Craig Berube was also out of answers when his team fell 5-2 to the rival Montreal Canadiens on Saturday night, losing for the seventh time in eight games, losing their Stanley Cup aspirations gradually.
