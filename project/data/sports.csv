Robert Irwin announces Los Angeles Rams' 2025 NFL Draft pick from Pennsylvania

Konata Mumpfield’s college career at Pitt showcased his NFL potential

In a heartwarming and unexpected moment during the 2025 NFL Draft, Australian wildlife conservationist Robert Irwin took center stage to announce a late-round draft pick — and he did it in true Aussie style. Speaking from the Australia Zoo in Queensland, Irwin, with a massive snake draped casually around his shoulders, revealed the Los Angeles Rams ’ selection at pick No. 242: Konata Mumpfield, a standout wide receiver from the University of Pittsburgh.The NFL has increasingly sought to create unique and memorable moments during its annual draft, and this year was no exception. In a video posted by the league, Robert Irwin's announcement merged wildlife conservation and football excitement in a way only he could deliver. His appearance, complete with a snake companion, was both a nod to his famous late father Steve Irwin’s legacy and a testament to the NFL’s growing international reach.This special moment not only delighted NFL fans but also introduced a broader audience to the late stages of the draft, a time when hidden gems like Mumpfield often get their start.Konata Mumpfield’s journey to the NFL wasn’t paved with flashy headlines, but his on-field performance spoke volumes. During the 2024 season with the Pittsburgh Panthers, Mumpfield compiled 52 receptions for 813 yards, averaging an impressive 15.6 yards per catch. His five touchdowns helped solidify his status as a reliable playmaker and earned him an All-ACC Honorable Mention.Statistically, Mumpfield led Pitt in receptions (tied), receiving yards, and yards per catch — clear evidence of his crucial role in the Panthers’ offense.While Mumpfield might not possess elite size or blazing speed, scouts believe his technical skills will help him thrive in the NFL. ""What Mumpfield lacks in size and speed for the position, he makes up for with outstanding route running and a professional mentality,"" noted respected NFL analyst Eric Edholm.Also Read: ""It's a quiet rebellion”: Jason Kelce slammed for ""quietly"" supporting Donald Trump’s America First movement with new fashion line Landing Mumpfield in the seventh round could prove to be a savvy move for the Rams, a franchise known for uncovering talent in unexpected places.

NEW DELHI: The expression on captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni ’s face said it all as Chennai Super Kings suffered another defeat—this time a five-wicket loss to Sunrisers Hyderabad at the MA Chidambaram Stadium in Chennai on Friday. A visibly disappointed Dhoni admitted that a total of 154 was far from “justifiable” on a Chepauk pitch that didn’t have any demons, as SRH dealt a near-fatal blow to CSK’s IPL 2025 play-off chances.Sunrisers chased down the modest target in just 18.4 overs. Dhoni pointed out that it's always tough when several players fail to deliver simultaneously.He also believed that SRH batted under slightly tougher conditions in the second innings, yet CSK couldn't capitalise. For the skipper, the lack of cohesion in the team's overall effort was most frustrating.""I think we kept losing wickets and another thing is in the first innings the wicket was slightly better and 157 wasn't a justifiable score,"" Dhoni said after CSK’s loss.""It wasn't turning a lot, a little two-paced but nothing out of the ordinary. Yes, second innings there was a bit of help. Our spinners, the quality was there and they were bowling in the right areas, but we were 15-20 runs short,"" he added.Also See: IPL Live Score, KKR vs PBKS Commenting on Dewald Brevis’ performance, Dhoni said, ""[On Brevis] I think he batted really well and we needed that in the middle order. When the spinners come in, you do it either by batsmanship or picking the right areas, but that's an area where we want to improve because middle overs are crucial.""Reflecting on the broader issues plaguing the team, Dhoni didn’t hold back.""In a tournament like this, if there are one or two areas to plug in the holes it's good, but when a majority of the players are not doing well you need to make changes. You can't just keep going. We are just not putting enough runs on the board,"" he said.With this win, SRH have moved up to eighth place on the points table, registering three wins and six losses for a total of six points.CSK, meanwhile, sit at the bottom with just two wins from nine games and only four points to show.","Chennai super kings lost to sunrisers hyderabad by five wickets on friday.

Desmond Watson signs with Buccaneers, becomes heaviest player ever to join an NFL team



After going undrafted in the 2025 NFL Draft, Desmond Watson , one of the Florida Gators ' most beloved fan favorites, has landed a spot with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers . The towering 6-foot-5, 464-pound defensive tackle inked an undrafted free agent contract with the Buccaneers just moments after the draft ended, marking him as the team's first UDFA signing. The contract includes a $20,000 signing bonus and $50,000 in guaranteed money, offering Watson a strong foundation as he embarks on his NFL journey.Desmond Watson's unique combination of size and skill makes him a standout figure in the NFL. At 464 pounds, Watson now holds the record as the heaviest player in NFL history , surpassing the previous record set by offensive tackle Aaron Gibson by an impressive 54 pounds. Watson joins a talented group of nose tackles in Tampa Bay, including Vita Vea and Greg Gaines. Over his collegiate career, Watson accumulated 63 tackles, 1.5 sacks, and a memorable forced fumble and recovery in 2022, which cemented his place in Gators history.Though Watson was not invited to the NFL Scouting Combine, his performance at Florida's Pro Day captured the attention of scouts. He clocked an impressive 5.95-second 40-yard dash, making him the third slowest runner of all time at his size but still managing to impress those in attendance. Additionally, Watson's 36 reps on the bench press would have been the highest at the Combine, demonstrating his raw strength and athleticism despite his considerable size.Tampa Bay's head coach, Billy Napier, praised Watson’s exceptional abilities. ""He's a unicorn. That stature,"" Napier said at the Pro Day. ""And then, you get to know Des. He's extremely intelligent. He's got a great sense of humor. He was a great teammate. Obviously showed up in good shape (for pro day). He'll get his shot, and I'm hoping he'll make the most of it.""What makes Watson's journey even more remarkable is his hometown connection to Tampa Bay. Born and raised in Plant City, Florida, Watson will now have the opportunity to play just hours away from where he made his mark both in high school at Armwood and in college with the Gators. This proximity adds an extra layer of excitement as he competes for a spot on the Buccaneers' roster, with the potential to play in front of a familiar Florida crowd in the NFL.While Watson's weight has been a topic of discussion throughout his career, it’s clear he has made significant strides. Prior to the draft, Watson spoke about his weight management efforts: ""There (are) times where I do basically starving and stuff like that... I didn’t feel confident that way. I didn’t feel strong, I didn’t feel fast. I feel like right now is the best I felt with the process of losing weight.""Watson’s commitment to fitness has been evident as he worked with a weight and fitness specialist leading up to the draft. His goal of losing approximately 100 pounds was achieved through a disciplined diet that cut out sugar and starches, relying on peas, beans, chili, and spinach as key components of his meals.As the Buccaneers continue to strengthen their roster, Watson's signing marks a significant opportunity for him to prove himself. The team had already bolstered their edge rushing corps with two new signings in the 2025 draft but left room for a potential interior defensive lineman. With no other interior D-linemen drafted, Watson's chance to compete for a backup role behind Pro Bowler Vita Vea is very much alive.Desmond Watson's path to the NFL may have been unconventional, but his hard work, dedication, and Florida roots have given him the chance to shine at the highest level of football. Whether or not he secures a starting position, one thing is clear—Watson’s journey is just beginning, and fans across Florida will be cheering him on every step of the way.Also Read: ""Clueless for 50 years"": ESPN’s Mel Kiper Jr. slams NFL teams for letting Shedeur Sanders slip to fifth round","Desmond watson, a 6-foot-5, 464-pound defensive tackle, is the heaviest player ever to join an nfl team.

NEW DELHI: India and Gujarat Titans batter Shubman Gill has put an end to persistent rumours about his personal life, calling the speculation around his relationships ""ridiculous."" Speaking to Hollywood Reporter India, the 25-year-old clarified that he has been single for over three years and is unfazed by the constant gossip.""I've been single for over three years, and so many speculations and rumours link me with different people. Sometimes, it's so ridiculous because I haven't even met the person in my life. It's bizarre,"" Gill said, addressing the ongoing chatter surrounding his private life.Focused solely on his career, Gill explained that his busy cricketing schedule leaves him little room for relationships. ""We're on the road for about 300 days a year. There’s hardly any time to be with someone or invest the time needed for a relationship,"" he stated.Gill also opened up about handling crowd chants linking him to various celebrities during matches. He revealed that once he steps onto the field, he is so deeply focused that he barely registers the noise from the stands.""When you're batting, you don't hear those chants. You're completely zoned in — thinking about gaps, bowlers, next shots,"" he explained. ""But while fielding, especially near the boundary, you do hear them sometimes.""Gill’s straightforward comments have once again highlighted his commitment to his craft, as he continues to be one of India's most promising young stars both in international cricket and the IPL.",India and gujarat titans batter shubman gill has put an end to persistent rumours about his personal life.

NEW DELHI: In a significant move ahead of their crucial IPL 2025 clash against Punjab Kings (PBKS), Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) dropped Moeen Ali and brought in Caribbean all-rounder Rovman Powell , who was bought for Rs 1.5 crore in the auction.Along with Powell, KKR also handed a game to left-arm pacer Chetan Sakariya, replacing Ramandeep Singh.At the toss, Punjab Kings captain Shreyas Iyer elected to bat first at Eden Gardens . PBKS made two changes as well, bringing in Glenn Maxwell and Azmatullah Omarzai for Marcus Stoinis and Xavier Bartlett.KKR skipper Ajinkya Rahane stressed the importance of positive cricket at the toss. He acknowledged the team’s struggles with the bat and called for a braver approach. ""The bowling unit has done well, but our batters need to be more fearless,"" Rahane said.This fixture carries extra emotional weight, with Shreyas Iyer returning to Eden Gardens in opposition colours.Just last season, Iyer led KKR to their first title in ten years. Released in a surprise off-season decision, Iyer has flourished at PBKS under Ricky Ponting’s guidance, taking his side into the playoff hunt. He has already scored 263 runs this season, though he arrives for this game with a slight dip in form.KKR, meanwhile, are desperate to revive their campaign after five losses in eight games. Their batting lineup has lacked consistency, with Andre Russell and Rinku Singh struggling for finishes. The inclusion of Rovman Powell is expected to inject some much-needed power in the middle order.Spin, once KKR’s strength at Eden, has not yielded the expected results this season, adding to their headaches. Varun Chakaravarthy and Sunil Narine have been among wickets but haven’t dominated matches.Punjab Kings, on the other hand, appear more settled, with young talents like Priyansh Arya and key bowlers like Arshdeep Singh and Yuzvendra Chahal offering balance.KKR must win at least five of their remaining six games to realistically stay in the playoff race.Rahmanullah Gurbaz (wk), Sunil Narine, Ajinkya Rahane (c), Venkatesh Iyer, Rinku Singh, Andre Russell, Rovman Powell, Vaibhav Arora, Chetan Sakariya, Harshit Rana, Varun Chakaravarthy.Priyansh Arya, Prabhsimran Singh, Shreyas Iyer (c), Josh Inglis (wk), Nehal Wadhera, Shashank Singh, Glenn Maxwell, Azmatullah Omarzai, Marco Jansen, Arshdeep Singh, Yuzvendra Chahal.",Kolkata knight riders (kkr) drop moeen ali and bring in rovman powell.

NEW DELHI: Former Chennai Super Kings star Suresh Raina has come down heavily on the CSK management following the team's continued struggles in IPL 2025. Raina expressed his disappointment after CSK suffered a five-wicket defeat to Sunrisers Hyderabad at Chepauk on Friday, a loss that left their playoff hopes hanging by a thread.Raina, speaking on Star Sports Network, said MS Dhoni ’s deep involvement in the team’s operations meant poor auction decisions were unlikely during his peak years.Also See: PBKS vs KKR Live Score, IPL 2025 “Kashi sir has handled the administration for 30-40 years now, and now Rupa ma'am is managing cricket affairs like player recruitment. In the past, even if MS wasn’t physically at the auction, he was involved in every discussion. But this time, MS knows it was not a good auction... (Dhoni asa auction nahi kar shakta) Dhoni would never have allowed a bad auction,” Raina said.Highlighting Dhoni’s commitment, Raina pointed out that even at 43, Dhoni is still leading from the front, keeping wickets and captaining the side with full effort.""He’s playing for the brand, the name, and the fans. But what about the others? Players bought for Rs 18–20 crores aren’t stepping up when it matters.""Raina emphasised that some of the long-serving players continue to repeat mistakes, and accountability is needed. “MS doesn’t need anyone to tell him what’s going wrong. The way he walked off after the toss and post-match, a big meeting is surely on the cards,"" Raina concluded.Meanwhile, Sunrisers Hyderabad broke their Chepauk jinx with a comfortable chase of 155, riding on Ishan Kishan’s 44 and Kamindu Mendis’s unbeaten 32.Hyderabad's bowlers, led by Harshal Patel (4-28) and Pat Cummins (2-21), restricted CSK to just 154.Chennai’s batting woes continued as Shaik Rasheed, Sam Curran, and Ayush Mahtre fell cheaply, despite Dewald Brevis’ promising 42 on debut.With their seventh defeat, CSK, currently down in the last position on the IPL points table, now face an uphill task to reach the playoffs.",Former chennai super kings star suresh raina has come down heavily on the csk management.

""If Jadeja has come up, Jadeja's strike rate is useless, but at least he should bat till the 15th-18th over so others can play around him,"" Sehwag said on Cricbuzz. ""None of the batters took responsibility. Wickets kept falling and nobody stayed long enough to anchor the innings.""Sehwag also expressed frustration over CSK's confused batting order. ""It is beyond my understanding. If you bring Brevis in, play him at No.3, Shivam Dube at 4, and Jadeja after that. Sam Curran can follow. But no one is scoring consistently.

NEW DELHI: Rain played spoilsport at Eden Gardens during the Kolkata Knight Riders versus Punjab Kings clash in IPL 2025, forcing players off the field after just one over of KKR’s innings. Kolkata were seven for no loss when the heavens opened up, accompanied by strong winds that made it tough for the groundstaff to manage the covers.As per match officials, overs would only start reducing if play couldn't resume by 10:35 PM local time.Until then, fans and players alike remained hopeful as visuals showed KKR players warming up near the sidelines once the rain eased.However, a full ground cover was in place, and the staff, struggling without sufficient weights, sat on the covers to prevent them from blowing away.Despite the tricky conditions, the night remained young with ample time for a possible restart.As per IPL playing conditions, The cut-off time for a 5-over contest is 11.44 pm IST.If the game is reduced to the minimum five overs, KKR will need to chase 61 runs.Before the interruption, Punjab Kings had posted a strong total of 201/4 thanks to brilliant half-centuries from Priyansh Arya and Prabhsimran Singh. Arya dazzled with a fluent 69 off 35 balls, while Prabhsimran overcame a slow start to hammer 83 off 49 balls. Their 120-run opening stand set the foundation for a massive score.However, Kolkata Knight Riders pulled things back in the death overs. Vaibhav Arora (2/34) and Andre Russell (1/27) were key in restricting the damage, with KKR conceding just 40 runs and grabbing two wickets in the final five overs.Arya and Prabhsimran had made merry on a true batting surface, unlike previous Eden Gardens pitches that tended to slow down. Arya’s elegant strokeplay and Prabhsimran’s late acceleration meant PBKS were initially eyeing 230-plus before KKR’s bowlers fought back.","Rain interrupts ipl 2025 clash between kolkata knight riders and punjab kings.
