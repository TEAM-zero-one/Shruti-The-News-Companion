Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce Are Likely Planning A Private Valentine’s Day Together

It’s been a chaotic February for Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce. After Taylor lost out on multiple Grammy Awards, her boyfriend Travis Kelce’s team Kansas City Chiefs lost out on their chance of bringing the Lombardy Trophy home at the Super Bowl. It’s not surprising that the couple is not exactly in a celebratory mood and is not exactly planning a big Valentine’s Day blowout with their celebrity pals.An insider who’s close to the couple has revealed that Taylor and Travis are planning to spend some quiet time together and are not likely to go out to celebrate V-Day in public.

Things seem great between them, and they’re incredibly happy together.” The source also added that the Super Bowl, which the Chiefs lost, “was upsetting for everyone.”Taylor and Travis started dating around September 2023 and both the stars have been under intense public scrutiny since they were experiencing crucial phases in their careers. While Taylor was travelling the world with her iconic Eras tour, which also became the highest-grossing tour in music history, Kelce was prepping for one of the most important seasons of his career.Also Read: Taylor Swift & Travis Kelce’s next move: Where will they relax after the Super Bowl loss?

Although, Travis reportedly spent over $16,000 on gifts for Taylor.

I need it. I'll be depressed if I don't get it. Please, Lord, right now” “, as he spoke about wanting to be with his current team, the Baltimore Ravens. While this might seem pretty aspirational and motivational, many fans have not liked his statement.A fan took to X and wrote, “All these players that want a Super Bowl so bad should take pay cuts to set their team up better lol”, while another fan wrote, “I feel like our players are so hungry for it, so consumed by that want of that elusive Lombardi trophy. That it affects their performance in the biggest moments of the season. Not saying they need to relax, but…”A third fan wrote, “I really had alot of respect for Henry before this. Hearing him talk he’s just a big idiot.”Derrick Henry, on the podcast with Micah Parsons, also spoke about how he desperately wants to be with his current team, the Baltimore Ravens.

Jalen Hurts Apartment: Jalen Hurts Has a $255M Contract—But Still Rents a $2K Apartment?! Here’s Why,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/jalen-hurts-has-a-255m-contractbut-still-rents-a-2k-apartment-heres-why/articleshow/118215918.cms,"Getty Images

Why Does Jalen Hurts Still Rent Instead of Buying a Lavish Home?

""I didn’t buy a house or anything when I got drafted because it was just me,""

""I didn’t need this big place just for myself. I just got me a little apartment. You know, something smooth that’ll last me for the time being.""

Where Does Jalen Hurts Actually Invest His Millions?

A $215,000 house in Humble, Texas, for his family.

A 3,000-square-foot home in Houston, which he bought under his mom’s name.

A $6 million mansion near Houston, where he spends most of his off-season.

The house next door for an extra $2.68 million, because why not? Privacy is key.

Super Bowl Victory & What’s Next for Hurts?

Let’s talk about Jalen Hurts—Super Bowl champ, MVP, and one of the highest-paid quarterbacks in the NFL. With a $255 million contract in his pocket, you’d think he’s living in a mega-mansion in Philly, right? Nope. This guy still rents a $2,000-per-month apartment in Cherry Hill, New Jersey, and honestly, his reasoning makes total sense.Hurts has been renting this modest apartment since 2020, back when he was just a rookie figuring things out. Even after signing his massive contract extension in 2023, he decided to stick with it. Why? Simplicity.Hurts told GQ Sports in 2021.And that “little apartment” just happens to be 20 minutes from the Eagles' training facility—so it’s practical, too.Don’t get it twisted—Hurts isn’t against buying property. He’s just smart about it. Instead of splurging on a massive home in Philly, he’s been investing in real estate back in Texas.Here’s what his $9.4 million real estate portfolio looks like:His main home in Houston is a 6,000-square-foot beast with six bedrooms, six bathrooms, a giant pool, and 10 acres of land.Oh, and did we mention? Hurts just won his first Super Bowl after leading the Eagles to a 40-22 victory over the Chiefs. He completed 17 of 22 passes for 221 yards, securing the Super Bowl MVP title.With a ring now in hand, maybe it’s time for Hurts to upgrade his Philly living situation? Then again, knowing him, he’ll probably just buy another house for his family before splurging on himself.Either way, one thing’s for sure—Hurts is playing the long game with his money, and we’ve gotta respect it.Also read - ""This fall off the cliff is two years in the making"": Andy Reid should resign as Chiefs coach, says Fox Sports host following Super Bowl loss against Eagles","Jalen hurts is one of the highest-paid quarterbacks in the nfl.

Deion Sanders demonstrates reasons for rejecting NFL offers and establishing a Hall of Fame coaching staff at Colorado,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/deion-sanders-demonstrates-reasons-for-rejecting-nfl-offers-and-establishing-a-hall-of-fame-coaching-staff-at-colorado/articleshow/118200044.cms,"Image via AP

Deion Sanders prioritizes coaching sons Shedeur Sander and Shilo Sander at Colorado

Deion Sanders prefers coaching college athletes over the NFL to mentor them beyond football. He’s built a strong Colorado staff, adding Hall of Famers Marshall Faulk and Warren Sapp to develop players on and off the field.Deion Sanders stayed committed to Colorado despite reported interest from NFL teams like the Dallas Cowboys and Las Vegas Raiders. He had stated he’d only consider the NFL if he could coach his sons, Shedeur Sanders and Shilo Sanders. Shedeur is a top QB prospect for the 2025 draft, projected as a top-five pick, while Shilo is expected to be a late-round selection.Colorado’s season ended in disappointment with a 36-14 loss to BYU in the Alamo Bowl, but their nine wins marked the program’s best season in nearly a decade. However, their bowl game victory drought extended to 21 years.Despite the loss, Colorado’s top stars,Heisman winner Travis Hunter and quarterback Shedeur Sanders remain highly regarded, with their draft stock unaffected. With both players heading to the NFL, Deion Sanders faces the challenge of maintaining momentum next season. He’s already making moves, recruiting new talent, and reportedly adding another Hall of Fame coach to his staff to keep Colorado competitive.Deion Sanders is reshaping his coaching staff, adding Hall of Famer Marshall Faulk as Colorado’s new running backs coach. Faulk, a former NFL MVP, Super Bowl champion, and seven-time Pro Bowler, joins fellow Hall of Famer Warren Sapp on Sanders’ staff.Faulk’s arrival signals a potential shift in Colorado’s offense. With Shedeur Sanders and Travis Hunter heading to the NFL, Sanders may move away from a pass-heavy attack and focus more on the running game, which has struggled under his leadership. In 2024, Colorado’s running backs combined for just 847 yards and 15 touchdowns, with four of those scores coming from Shedeur. Faulk’s experience and leadership are expected to help strengthen this weak spot and bring more balance to the offense next season.Marshall Faulk, a Hall of Famer with 12,279 rushing yards in his NFL career, is a major addition to Colorado's coaching staff. Known for his ability to both run and catch, Faulk will be a key figure in developing Colorado's running backs like Isaiah Augustave, Micah Welch, Dallan Hayden, and Drelon Miller.""Deion is an elevator,"" Faulk said before the Super Bowl. ""He's going to elevate you as a person, and he's going to force you to elevate your life. That's what it does. He lifts people up.""This move fits perfectly with Deion Sanders’ philosophy of bringing in coaches with elite playing experience. Just as Warren Sapp has helped improve the defensive line, Faulk’s presence could have a similar impact on the running back group, potentially transforming the offense and giving it more balance.Marshall Faulk will earn $400,000 in his first year as Colorado’s running backs coach, with a base salary of $300,000 and an extra $100,000 for community outreach. His salary is expected to rise in his second year, but his real value comes from his experience as both a rusher and receiver, which could bring a new dimension to Colorado’s offense.Also Read: “I think he retires”: Colin Cowherd believes Travis Kelce have played the last game of his career against the Eagles at the Super Bowl LIX With Faulk joining Warren Sapp under Deion Sanders, Colorado is setting a new standard in college football by bringing in Hall of Fame-level talent to coach. This could pave the way for other former NFL stars to follow suit, as seen with the surprising hiring of Bill Belichick at North Carolina. It could signal a shift in how college football is shaped, with more NFL legends looking to make an impact on the next generation of players.","Deion sanders adds hall of famer marshall faulk as colorado's new running backs coach.

Garcia's Slow and Steady Approach: A Southpaw's Nerve Test in Spring Training



Robert Garcia Reacts to Being Traded to Texas Rangers, Watching Texas Rangers Win 2023 World Series

Thus begins the Spring Training of Major League Baseball teams in Surprise, Arizona, as pitchers and catchers gather to signal the beginning of another great season. While Texas Rangers pitchers were busy readying their arms and throwing some gas, one lefty stayed home. And no, it wasn't because of a wayward fastball.Meet Robert Garcia, the southpaw in exchange for sending Nathaniel Lowe to the Washington system. Garcia was part of the trade discussions, right along with Chris Martin, a veteran with 14 career saves, as a possible Rangers bullpen candidate. And therein lies the catch-or may we say, the nervy situation. Garcia learns the big leagues while having some irritation in the throwing arm's nerves. Not the best welcome into spring training when edging for the last slot in the bullpen.Chris Young, president of baseball operations for the Rangers, reassured the media that there were no real concerns-just precaution to start things off. Instead of mounding like everyone else, Garcia will keep it low-key with a few catch sessions off of flat ground. The cautious approach to ramp-up allows this nerve irritation to have a chance of being a less significant issue in the future. Moreover, spring training isn't a sprint to the mound.""Nothing we're worried about,"" Young told the media. So the Rangers are putting Garcia's long-term health ahead of a hasty return to the mound, which is certainly wise because of the pressure that would come with being a potential closer.This is a new realm for Garcia. Even though for some time now he has been considered to step into that closer role, he has, in fact, never seen the opportunity of actually closing out a game in the majors. In the meantime, Chris Martin presumably has much closing experience, with 14 career saves to his name. With the Rangers changing their bullpen and changing pitching philosophies, however, Garcia surely could be in the running when he gets back healthy.Clearly, with the Rangers' offseason moves, such as letting Kirby Yates walk in free agency, a hole is present to be filled in the bullpen. Yates, who was the closer last year, has signed with the Los Angeles Dodgers, and David Robertson, another experienced closer, is still a free agent, leaving a tremendous opportunity open for someone to step up and grab that high-leverage role-whether it be Garcia, Martin, or another arm looking to make a statement.As spring goes on, we will be watching closely to see if Garcia can return fully to health and position himself in the conversation for the closing duties. But for now, he's taking it slow; being cautious is the name of the game in times like these—especially when it comes to the arm that does the throwing.","Robert garcia was traded to the texas rangers in exchange for nathaniel lowe. The left-hander has been dealing with nerve irritation in his throwing arm. The rangers are putting garcia's long-term health ahead of a hasty return to the mound. With the rangers changing their bullpen, garcia surely could be in the running.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118224430,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-24980,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Chiefs are facing an identity crisis on offense

The Kansas City Chiefs must decide whether to release Travis Kelce in 2025, as releasing him would save $17.2 million in cap space. Kelce, a valuable and important player, is too valuable and important in the locker room to make such a choice. The Chiefs must adapt their offense to achieve a fourth consecutive Super Bowl and sixth in seven years, focusing on receivers Xavier Worthy and Rashee Rice , with Kelce playing a crucial role.Kansas City has achieved significant success in the past two seasons, reaching both Super Bowls and winning one, including winning it all in 2022. This success came after trading All-Pro receiver Tyreek Hill to the Miami Dolphins, but the team's transformation from explosive to slow wasn't immediate. Patrick Mahomes, who previously ranked sixth, 10th, and 13th in average depth of target from '18 to '20, dropped to 24th in Hill's final campaign due to increased shell coverage.In 2022, Mahomes threw for 5,250 yards and earned MVP, but his ADOT was 23rd in the league. The following year, Kansas City's ADOT dropped to 30th due to poor wideouts like Valdes-Scantling, Watson, Moore, and Toney. Mahomes failed to throw for 4,000 yards for the first time in his career, ranking 41st in ADOT. Early injuries to Rice and Brown and overreliance on Kelce contributed to the issue.Kelce has been targeted 254 times in the past two years, with Rice second with 131 targets. Despite playing just four games this season, Kelce hasn't made the All-Pro team or gained 1,000 receiving yards in seven consecutive seasons before 2023. Mahomes needs to return to his former form, and the Chiefs must address left tackle issues. Jawaan Taylor is financially locked in for another year before Kansas City releases him to save $20 million by 2026.The Chiefs have $11.5 million in cap space and can potentially increase it to $60 million with an extension for Joe Thuney, a restructure of Mahomes's deal, and a void year in Kelce's pact.

Edwards believes this approach aligns with the modern NBA's emphasis on perimeter shooting. Additionally, the strategy has worked in the Timberwolves’ favor.Minnesota Timberwolves star Anthony Edwards made it clear that teams aren’t just launching threes for no reason— they’re taking the best available shots. He pointed to the evolution of the game, where towering defenders like Victor Wembanyama make scoring inside much tougher.With elite rim protectors patrolling the paint, Edwards sees the three-pointer as a necessary tool to surprise their opponent.

""You got Wemby. You got these boys. They tall. They big. They blocking shots, man. We not forcing our way to the paint every time. So, everybody can think what they want to think, but I just feel like the game changes. Guys want to shoot threes and guys are good at it. The viewership is down. I don't know what they got to do, lower the rim or something?"" he told Complex.Although the move is quite necessary in today’s NBA games, the NBA All-Star did not hesitate to urge the players to refrain from using the strategy who are not comfortable with it.

Harbhajan Singh backs India to dominate Pakistan in ICC Champions Trophy 2025

'ROHIT A GREAT LEADER'

NEW DELHI: The iconic moment of Suryakumar Yadav 's breathtaking boundary-line catch to dismiss David Miller Rohit Sharma 's intense gaze as he witnessed the match-defining moment, fans on the edge of their seats with mouths agape, and the euphoric celebrations that followed still remains etched in the hearts of Indian cricket fans. India snatched victory from the jaws of defeat, securing a thrilling seven-run win over South Africa in a pulsating final to claim their second ICC Men's T20 World Cup title.Now, with Rohit Sharma leading India into another ICC challenge - the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 - could we see another India vs South Africa showdown in the final?Former South Africa allrounder JP Duminy believes a rematch in the summit clash would be ideal. The tournament is set to take place from February 19 to March 9, 2025, across Pakistan and Dubai.India will kick off their Champions Trophy campaign in Dubai on February 20 against Bangladesh and will play all their matches at the same venue.""I think that would be ideal. Look, I know that from a white-ball point of view, particularly in one-day cricket, South Africa hasn't necessarily played its best cricket. But what encourages me about South Africa is that, in big tournaments, we seem to see the best of them-we saw that in the T20 World Cup in June,"" Duminy told TimesofIndia.com in an interview.""So, I'm pretty confident that, even with the World Test Championship final, we'll take confidence from that. And the fact that we're heading into a high-octane tournament like the Champions Trophy-where there are no so-called weaker teams, and every team has a genuine chance to win-makes it even more exciting. Starting well, building momentum, and gaining confidence will be key. But what creates confidence? Momentum creates confidence. So, if you get on a good run, the confidence levels rise. If we can do that early in the tournament, it will put us in a strong position. Along with every other team, I believe South Africa has a real chance,"" Duminy, who played 46 Tests, 199 ODIs and 82 T20Is for the Proteas, said.India are in Group A alongside Bangladesh, arch-rivals Pakistan, and New Zealand, while South Africa are placed in Group B alongside England, Australia, and Afghanistan.With match-winners like David Miller, Heinrich Klaasen , Tristan Stubbs, Kagiso Rabada, and Keshav Maharaj in their ranks, Duminy believes South Africa will once again enter the tournament as strong contenders.""Heinrich Klaasen is in a league of his own right now, particularly in white-ball cricket. We've seen that across the globe in every tournament he has played. It would be ideal if he remains in good form,"" Duminy said.""But the reality of tournaments-whether it's the World Cup or the Champions Trophy-is that you need two or three players to be consistently performing. One player can win you a game here and there, but for sustained success, you need consistency with both bat and ball. So, players like Kagiso Rabada, Keshav Maharaj-especially in those conditions-Marco Jansen, and obviously Heinrich Klaasen and David Miller will be crucial. If two or three of them can find consistency, it will give us the best chance to win,"" he said.Duminy played under Rohit's captaincy for Mumbai Indians in 2018, sharing the nets, warm-up sessions, dressing room, and crease with him.Reflecting on his experience, he described the Indian skipper as a ""great leader.""""Form is temporary, class is permanent (on Rohit). I was reminded of that a few days ago, and Rohit certainly fits that mold. I have no doubt he will come back stronger. I've had the privilege of playing alongside him, and one of his greatest attributes is his consistency in who he is-regardless of his performances. He's a great leader, and he has enjoyed tremendous success with both the Mumbai Indians and the Indian team,"" he said.""Cricket is a game of ups and downs, but how we respond to those challenges defines us as players and as people. Knowing Rohit's character, and having seen the consistency in his interviews and behavior over the last few months, I know that the players and staff trust him to come out of this stronger. I'm pretty sure we're going to see some big performances from him soon,"" Duminy said.","Icc champions trophy 2025 is set to take place in pakistan and dubai.

Theare gearing up to face the Houston Rockets on Thursday, February 13, at the Toyota Center, and while their injury report remains relatively light, all eyes are on how the team will perform without newly acquired star, who has not been officially listed on the injury report. Butler, recently traded to the Warriors, is expected to make his debut soon, but his absence from the injury report suggests he is healthy and ready to contribute when called upon.The Golden State Warriors currently have only one player listed on the injury report: Jonathan Kuminga, who remains sidelined with an ankle injury. Kuminga’s absence is a setback for the team, as his athleticism and defensive versatility have been key components of the Warriors’ rotation this season. Head coach Steve Kerr emphasized the importance of adapting, saying, “We’ve got to find a way to compete with the guys we have available. Injuries are part of the game, and we’re focused on getting everyone healthy at the right time.”With Jimmy Butler not listed on the injury report, the Warriors are optimistic about integrating him into their lineup soon. His arrival brings a wealth of experience, defensive intensity, and clutch scoring ability, which could be a game-changer for a team hovering around .500 with a 27-27 record.

In total 707 runs were scored in 99 overs at the National Stadium in Karachi on Wednesday, with bats from both sides breathing fire in the ODI tri-series match between hosts Pakistan and South Africa.Led by Heinrich Klaasen (87), Matthew Breetzke (83) and captain Temba Bavuma (82), the South African team posted a formidable total of 352 for 5. But the home side successfully chased down the big target, powered by brilliant centuries from Salman Ali Agha (134) and captain Mohammad Rizwan (122 not out) with an over to spare.The six-wicket win took Pakistan to the final of the tri-series against New Zealand at the same venue on Friday, and the matches played so far in this tournament have indicated that the ICC Champions Trophy is going to be full of runs.The two venues used for the tri-series -- Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore and the National Stadium in Karachi -- will also host the upcoming Champions Trophy , with the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium as the third venue.While India play their matches in Dubai as part of a hybrid arrangement, the big-hitting stars among the two-time ODI World Cup winners will miss playing on the flat tracks in Pakistan.Each of the three league games in the tri-series -- two in Lahore and one in Karachi -- have seen the team batting first going past the 300-run mark, while two of those were successfully chased.Batting first in Lahore, New Zealand made 330 for 6 against Pakistan, while South Africa scored 304 for 6 in the next match, which the Kiwis chased down successfully. And if the 7.14 runs per over in Karachi on Wednesday are anything to go by, then the final is likely to witness another run-fest.""Batters will certainly take a lot of heart from the performances they put in the past two games, and as a bowling unit, we are working to understand how to create more pressure and ultimately force batters to take risks,"" said SA coach Rob Walter, after Pakistan completed their highest successful ODI chase to beat the Proteas on Wednesday.He added that more totals in excess of 350 are on the cards if similar batting conditions and the flat decks become the norm at the three Champions Trophy venues, while bowlers will have to think out of the box to get wickets.""As I said, both teams struggled to take wickets; it wasn't just unique to us. So the method (of taking wickets) moving forward is going to be important to us,"" said the coach.""If the pitches are the same moving forward, then you can expect to see more scores of 350.""",Pakistan beat south africa by six wickets in odi tri-series match in karachi. Salman ali agha and mohammad rizwan score centuries to power home team's record chase. 707 runs were scored in 99 overs at the national stadium in karachi on wednesday. Pakistan will play new zealand in the final of the tri- series on friday.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118200404,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-46220,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
