Can J&K’s Ranji triumph heal old wounds?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/can-jks-ranji-triumph-heal-old-wounds/articleshow/128891217.cms,"Panacea on the Pitch? Cricket has the potential to tackle the sense of alienation that Kashmiris feel and bind them and other Indians closer together

Devajit Saikia exclusive: BCCI secretary on J&K Ranji win and future of Aquib Nabi

Jammu and Kashmir have become India’s cricketing champs by thrashing favourites Karnataka in the Ranji Trophy finals. This is a fantastic, heart-warming Cinderella tale in a small state long viewed as a no-hoper in cricket. Experts say nobody watches Ranji Trophy cricket because it is not exciting and lacks top stars. But I followed the Ranji semi-final and the final avidly and, by the end, was cheering myself hoarse for J&K. There must have been many more viewers like me.Before this season, J&K had played 334 Ranji Trophy matches over 67 years and won only 45 of them. It took 44 years to win its first match, against the Services in 1982-83. But this year, it steadily eliminated one tough opponent after another—Rajasthan, Hyderabad, Delhi, Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal, and finally seven-time champions Karnataka.Karnataka had five Test players—KL Rahul, Mayank Agrawal, Devdutt Padikkal, Karun Nair, and Prasidh Krishna . J&K had none. A year ago, you would have been hard-pressed to name a single member of its team. Yet it won in commanding style.This is more than a cricketing story. Out of the blue, it provides a non-political avenue to help alienated Kashmiris feel part of the Indian mainstream. They suddenly find themselves kings of Ranji cricket, admired and applauded across India in a manner no one could have imagined a year ago. May Kashmiri youngsters once seduced by terrorism trade Kalashnikovs for cricket bats!Kashmir’s notorious cricket audiences have been known to cheer for Pakistan against India.This has drawn accusations of anti-nationalism and taunts asking them to leave India and go to Pakistan.Kashmiris say this is a grave misunderstanding of their sentiments. My former Economic Times colleague Najeeb Mubarki says that cricketing crowds in the state have no particular love for Pakistan, but they want to express their alienation from India and outrage at violations of human rights in the state. And so, said Najeeb, Kashmir’s cricketing crowds will cheer for any opponent of India — be it Pakistan, or anyone else.In the current World Cup T-20 super-eights, South Africa thrashed India last week. News reports from Srinagar spoke of Kashmiris cheering for South Africa while watching the match on TV. With draconian laws now in place against anything that can be interpreted as anti-national, youngsters are cautious today about celebrations in public. But laws cannot transform what they feel or whom they cheer for.Can the mere winning of a cricket trophy change hearts and minds? No, that is a stretch. But all conventional means of ending Kashmiri alienation — govt jobs, subsidies for industries, encouraging tourism — have not achieved much. Cricket has promise because Kashmir, like the rest of India, is cricket crazy.Team sports are an excellent way to bind together people from different communities. Football is the biggest spectator sport globally, and Manchester United has millions of fans even in China and Africa. Cricket is not too far behind.Once you play for a cricket team, all your teammates become vital partners, regardless of religion or region. This is true, at least in part, for cricketing audiences too, which in India means almost everyone. Once, cheering against India was a Kashmiri way of expressing alienation. But now that J&K is Ranji champion, cricket has the potential to tackle that alienation and bind Kashmiris and other Indians closer together. The state is now central to Indian cricket, not an outlier.Its Ranji victory was a team effort of six Hindus and five Muslims. It scored a mammoth 584 runs in its first innings, with Shubham Pundir (ever heard of him?) scoring a century and five others scoring half-centuries. But the J&K star was unquestionably fast bowler Auqib Nabi, nicknamed the ‘Baramulla Express’. At the age of 29, he is a late developer. But his bowling in the last two Ranji seasons has been so phenomenal that it seems a crime that he is not in the Indian Test team.Nabi took 44 wickets last season and 60 this season, the most by any bowler. Despite having catches dropped he snagged 5 for 54 in Karnataka’s first innings, including the cream of its batting stars. He had earlier spearheaded J&K’s victory in the quarter final against MP (12 wickets for 110 runs) and semi-final against Bengal (9 wickets for 123 runs). His bowling average this season has been an astonishing 12.7 runs per wicket —anything below 20 is outstanding.Very few bowlers can boast of a hat-trick—three wickets in three successive balls. But in the Duleep Trophy six months ago, Nabi (playing for North Zone) got four wickets in four successive balls, a feat so extraordinary that cricket has yet to invent a word for it. Hurrah for Kashmir! Hurrah for India!","Jammu and kashmir have become india’s cricketing champs by thrashing favourites karnataka in the ranji trophy finals.

India’s T20 World Cup semifinal qualification scenario



Can India and Pakistan meet again in T20 World Cup?



Could the cricket world be set for another blockbuster India vs Pakistan showdown at the T20 World Cup 2026? The possibility is still alive — but several pieces must fall into place.So far, South Africa national cricket team and England cricket team have confirmed their semi-final berths. That leaves two spots up for grabs, with India national cricket team, West Indies cricket team, Pakistan national cricket team and New Zealand national cricket team still in contention.England booked their place in the last four after a tense four-wicket win over New Zealand at the R Premadasa Stadium in Colombo, completing the Super Eights stage unbeaten with three wins from three matches to top Group 2.New Zealand sit second with three points. Pakistan, meanwhile, remain mathematically alive — but only just.For Pakistan to qualify, they must beat Sri Lanka in their final Super Eight fixture — and by a massive margin. Their Net Run Rate of -0.461 pales in comparison to New Zealand’s +1.390. Pakistan need a thumping win over Zimbabwe on Saturday.India, the defending champions, responded in style with a dominant 72-run victory over Zimbabwe at the MA Chidambaram Stadium.After West Indies’ heavy defeat to South Africa, the equation is simple for the Suryakumar Yadav-led side: defeat West Indies in their final Super Eight clash at Eden Gardens on March 1 and they are through to the semi-finals — irrespective of the margin.However, if rain forces a washout, West Indies would move to three points and seal qualification instead.An India-Pakistan clash is possible — but only if both teams make the knockouts.If Pakistan somehow finish in the top two of Group 2 and India qualify from their group, the two sides could face off in:The semi-final — depending on final group positions.The final — if both teams win their respective semi-finals.At present, India’s route appears clear-cut. Pakistan, on the other hand, require a dominant display and favourable results elsewhere to keep alive hopes of another high-voltage encounter between cricket’s fiercest rivals.","India, the defending champions, responded in style with a dominant 72-run victory over zimbabwe at the ma chidambaram stadium.

India land in Kolkata for do-or-die WI clash | Semi-final spot on the line

The Eden Gardens pitch baked under the sun for most of the match eve as both India and West Indies held their practice sessions before the Super Eight clash, a virtual quarter-final for the two teams eyeing a semi-final berth. The playing surface invariably becomes the talking point in Kolkata and this one is on the drier side. Add ground dimensions and the possibility of heavy dew, and it's set to be a run-feast on Sunday. Both camps have similar expectations from the surface, which firmly places the spotlight on India's X-factor Varun Chakravarthy.The tournament could well be divided into two contrasting halves for the mystery spinner: he enjoyed significant control and success in the group stages but Super 8 opponents South Africa and Zimbabwe handled him comfortably. Although he has continued his streak of picking a wicket in every T20I to 19, the economy rate has nearly doubled to 10.25 in the Super 8s compared to 5.16 in the group stages. The way South African pair David Miller and Dewald Brevis took him down in the middle overs significantly impacted the game's outcome, offering enough cues for other opponents.Both Miller and Brevis were brave enough to play their shots. Since the pitch offered little turn, success depended solely on hitting the ball to the right spot. They came prepared for the challenge and succeeded with aplomb as the spinner returned with figures of 1/47, his third-most expensive figures in T20Is.""It wasn't spinning too much tonight, so you can kind of trust the line. And once we felt that, then we felt, OK, we've got to take him down, because he is a threat to every team that he does play against.So it was definitely something that we did speak about,"" Miller said after the game in Ahmedabad.The next game against Zimbabwe was another challenging outing; he picked 1/35, and has forced the Indian team management to rethink their plans for the 34-year-old. He has been used as an attacking option in the format, bowling an over in the powerplay before finishing his quota in the middle-overs. That strategy, however, could see some tweaks on Sunday because the West Indies also have a lot of fire in their batting, but have struggled against wrist-spin since the last World Cup.""It's pretty standard how we've utilised Varun so far, generally speaking he bowls one in the power play. He's our attacking option as well but we're aware that teams are now starting to play him a little bit differently. So we have some other strategies to deploy him in in different facets of the game but generally speaking he is someone we turn to for wickets. And he's been really good at that. And expect more of the same tomorrow,"" said India assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate during the pre-match press conference.When Miller and Brevis pressed on the accelerator against Varun, he tried to go wide but didn't get the execution he would have liked with the Plan B. Varun keeps the stumps in play but as teams begin to crack the code, he worked on some variations in his lines during the net session on the eve of the match. Unlike Chennai, where he worked around length markers on the stump line, Kolkata was about keeping the ball outside off. Something which he struggled in Ahmedabad and something which could be required against the dangerous West Indies line-up.Coach Gautam Gambhir was involved in a deep discussion with his trump card when the team landed in Kolkata. It continued during the team's optional session on Saturday and the possible change in strategy was visible in the way he tried under lights. Varun isn't a stranger to pressure or playing at the Eden Gardens - home to his IPL franchise, the Kolkata Knight Riders - but he is definitely stranger to leaking runs and will want to stop the flow in the do-or-die fixture. The shorter boundaries, batter-friendly surface and dew will add to the challenges and could pose a stiff challenge for Varun. West Indies are well aware of the threat but aren't focussing on any particular individual for their plans and preparations.""I think, last time I checked, I think he was the number one bowler in T20 cricket. We respect every opposition. Do we have our plans against each bowlers and vice versa, our bowlers versus their batsmen? Yes. Like I said, we go play a complete game. The team has quality. They got match winners, just like we do. And it's a battle of who executes with both bat and ball. And I add the fielding as well. I expect it to be an exciting game. But as usual, I want my team to win. And that's what we're focusing on, how we could get an advantage versus all the matchups, and play that brand that is effective enough to bring us the victory tomorrow,"" said West Indies coach Darren Sammy.The stage and occasion can't be bigger and India would hope their trump card wins them the all-important hand, and earns them the boarding pass to Mumbai for the semi-final versus England at the Wankhede. All to play for!","West indies take on india in a do-or-die clash in kolkata on sunday. The eden gardens pitch baked under the sun for most of the match eve. Both camps have similar expectations from the surface. India's x-factor varun chakravarthy will be in the spotlight.

Cap crunch, lineup squeeze and scoring upside make Patrik Laine key domino before NHL trade deadline



The Montreal Canadiens are apparently preparing to make a major decision regarding their roster ahead of the 2026 NHL Trade Deadline, with right winger Patrik Laine being given clearance to potentially be moved to another team.According to Elliotte Friedman, Patrik Laine is seen by Montreal Canadiens' management as being the best way for them to free up cap room ahead of the deadline. The Montreal Canadiens are currently sitting with around $1.3 million in cap room, which makes it difficult for them to make any major upgrades unless they shed a large contract first.From the Montreal Canadiens' perspective, it is more of a strategic move than anything else.Patrik Laine hasn’t played many games this season because of his injuries, although it seems he was nearing a comeback before the Olympics.The 27-year-old Finnish player was selected second overall by the Winnipeg Jets in the 2016 NHL Entry Draft. Patrik Laine has also played for the Columbus Blue Jackets. According to a report by dose.ca, his agent got a green signal from the team to converse with other NHL teams to find common ground to facilitate a trade.Given Patrik Laine’s potential impact on offense, it seems the Montreal Canadiens’ roster construction doesn’t offer him many opportunities, which makes him an even more tradable asset. It is still all about cap relief for Montreal. Laine is currently making $8.7 million against the cap with one year left on his contract. Being able to shed that salary will give Montreal the cap room it needs to make other deals. Montreal still has available salary retention slots, which will allow it to take on some of Laine’s salary if needed.Moreover, his ability to adapt could make him an appealing option for contenders that require a boost in offense without a long-term commitment to a player. However, it appears that Montreal’s decision to let Laine look for a new destination may also indicate that his market is softer than expected. This could mean that teams that are interested in Laine’s services are weighing his injury concerns against his ability to produce offense for their teams.For Montreal, it seems that its path forward is quite clear. As the deadline approaches, Laine’s situation has now become one of the most intriguing storylines in the league.",The montreal canadiens are reportedly preparing to make a major decision regarding their roster ahead of the 2026 nhl trade deadline. Right winger patrik laine has been given clearance to potentially be moved to another team. The 27-year-old finnish player was selected second overall by the winnipeg jets in the 2016 nhl entry draft.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128887724,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-37224,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"

Doug Kyed and Andrew Callahan report Philadelphia Eagles’ high asking price for A.J. Brown creates trade roadblock

A.J. Brown could become one of the biggest names to watch this offseason. If the Philadelphia Eagles decide to listen to offers, several teams are expected to check in quickly. The New England Patriots, Buffalo Bills, Pittsburgh Steelers and San Francisco 49ers all need help at wide receiver. But there is already a serious problem slowing things down, Philadelphia’s price. According to Doug Kyed and Andrew Callahan of the Boston Herald, the Patriots have at least explored the idea of trading for Brown.However, one source told them the Eagles’ asking price is simply too high right now. That early detail shows this will not be an easy deal for any team. Brown remains under contract and is still a key part of the Eagles’ offense.So if Philadelphia moves him, the return would need to be strong. That reality could shape the entire market.Doug Kyed wrote, “The Patriots have explored trade talks involving Eagles star wide receiver A.J. Brown, but feel the current asking price is unserious, according to one source.” The report did not list exact numbers, but league sources believe it would likely start with at least a first-round pick.Kyed also reported, “Several league sources believe Brown could nonetheless be dealt, and the return could be a step above what the Seahawks received when they traded D.K.Metcalf and a sixth-round pick to Pittsburgh last year for a second-rounder at 52nd overall and a seventh-round pick.”That comparison matters. If Brown’s value is higher than the D.K. Metcalf deal, teams would need to give up serious draft capital. Not every contender is willing to do that.The Eagles have not clearly said Brown is staying or leaving. Head coach Nick Sirianni told ESPN’s Tim McManus, “Will A.J. be here next season? I think we’re still in a spot, like, I can’t guarantee how anything is going to play out into next season. I’m thinking I’m going to be the coach next season, but you can’t guarantee anything past tomorrow.”Still, trading Brown would leave a big gap in Philadelphia’s offense. He has been a top target and a physical presence on the outside. Any team trying to land him may need to include a proven player in return, not just draft picks. For now, the interest is real. But unless the Eagles lower their demands, this A.J. Brown trade rumor may stay just a rumor.","A.j. Brown could become one of the biggest names to watch this offseason.

Playing at the same venue



Facing spin



Team news



New Zealand middle-order batter Mark Chapman looked perplexed when he was asked about the Super Eight groups, where all four table-toppers, who have done well in their respective groups, will end up facing each other. It has been done because of the pre-tournament seedings.The 31-year-old smiled and replied, “When it comes to scheduling and planning, that’s not really in my domain.”Chapman’s response sums up the way New Zealand play their cricket. No fuss, no theatrics, just straight down to business.After playing three matches in Chennai and one in Ahmedabad, all on red-soil pitches, the Kiwis had only one training session to adapt to the conditions ahead of their first Super Eight match against Pakistan at the R Premadasa Stadium.None of them rushed towards the pitch for a closer look. Once warm-ups were done, the players moved to the indoor nets. About an hour later, Daryl Mitchell came out barefoot to inspect the surface, spending a good fifteen minutes studying every inch of the 22 yards.Chapman, who did not get to see the surface, left it to the senior leadership group.“In the subcontinent, the toss always plays a factor depending on the conditions.I haven’t seen the pitch yet, so I don’t actually know what it looks like. There will be discussions behind the scenes with the senior leadership group about what we want to do,” he said.The black-soil pitches in Colombo do assist spinners, and with bigger boundaries and a slower outfield, it presents a new challenge for the 2021 T20 World Cup finalists.“We haven’t played in Sri Lanka yet. A lot of guys in our team have played a lot of cricket here, so I don’t see that playing too much of a factor. Guys understand what they need to do, and we are confident we will face whatever conditions are in front of us,” said Chapman, whose knees were heavily strapped.“In India, particularly on red-soil pitches, conditions have been favourable for batting. It has been tough for the bowlers, and the margins have been very small. We have seen scores close to 200 regularly.“Here, it is slightly different with the slower nature of the pitches. The bowlers will hopefully get a chance to show their skills, and spinners are more likely to play a part here,” he added.Although Pakistan are stationed in Sri Lanka, they played their group matches at two different venues in Colombo.New Zealand will be the only team playing all their Super Eight matches at the same venue, facing Pakistan on February 21, Sri Lanka on February 25, and England on February 27, all at the R Premadasa Stadium.“One of the challenges in tournaments like these is hopping from venue to venue and adapting. When we play three games at the same place, we learn with each game.“It is nice to turn up at the same venue with similar pitches and adjust. Tomorrow is our first game here, so we will have to adapt anyway, but we will understand the conditions better as we go,” he said.New Zealand’s first challenge will be Pakistan’s spin-heavy attack. Usman Tariq, Abrar Ahmad, Mohammad Nawaz, Saim Ayub, and Shadab Khan form a strong unit.“Pakistan have a number of very good spinners, each with their own threat. We have played them quite frequently over the last few years.“We are well aware of what they will bring. For us, it is about being really clear in how we want to play against them,” he said.Obviously, there was a Usman Tariq question: “Usman Tariq has a unique action with the way he pauses at the crease, so that is something to factor in.""Chapman, whose role is to take on spinners in the middle overs, explained why running between the wickets will be crucial.“Given the slower pitch and bigger boundaries, you have to change your game plan. Against spinners, it is about different options like the sweep or reverse sweep. In India, you can target straight boundaries more.“For me, it is about finding different areas of the ground. There are big pockets here, so it is not all about sixes. Twos, fours, and running between the wickets are very important, especially if it is not a high-scoring game,” he said.New Zealand have suffered injury setbacks. Michael Bracewell has been ruled out of the remainder of the tournament after re-injuring his left calf. Captain Mitchell Santner missed the last group match against Canada due to illness, while Lockie Ferguson returned home for the birth of his first child.“Mitchell Santner looks pretty sprightly and excited to get back on the park, barring any last-minute illness.“Lockie has just returned and is coming off a long flight. We will see how he pulls up. I cannot confirm whether he will be in the playing eleven,” Chapman said.","New zealand will be the only team playing all their super eight matches at the same venue, facing pakistan on february 21, sri lanka on february 25, and england on february 27.

Luke Humphries laughs off rare ‘kirkulator’ error



Luke Humphries shared a light-hearted moment with referee Kirk Bevins during a tense quarter-final clash at Premier League Darts in Belfast. The world No 2 was facing Stephen Bunting on night four of the competition. While the match was competitive, a small scoring error from Bevins stole the spotlight early in the contest and left players and fans amused.Humphries eventually lost the match 6-4 as Bunting advanced to the semi-finals and later won the night. But it was a rare mistake from Bevins, known for his sharp maths skills, that became one of the talking points of the evening. The funny exchange between the player and the referee quickly went viral, with fans enjoying the human side of the high-pressure tournament.The incident happened when Luke Humphries was attempting to check out on 36. The 31-year-old missed his shots at double 18 and double nine. That left him in a position where he would go bust with his next throw. He decided to aim for 14 instead.However, Bevins made an unusual mistake. He called out “31” after the throw, which confused Humphries. The player looked at him with a puzzled expression. Realising the slip, Bevins quickly corrected himself and said “no score.”Humphries then jokingly stared at the referee. Bevins laughed as he brushed off the error. The moment brought smiles all around. Even the official social media account of the PDC highlighted the clip. They captioned it, “Even the Kirkulator gets it wrong sometimes.”Fans quickly reacted online. One supporter wrote that they had to rewind the clip to watch it again and noticed that the person sitting next to Bevins also seemed confused. Another fan joked that the mistake was serious enough to cost him his job.Bevins, 39, is well known for his maths ability. Before joining darts full-time, he appeared on the BBC show Countdown in 2009. He won all eight of his heats with a record 925 points and then claimed the overall title. He is also the only contestant to achieve a perfect 15-round game on the show.He began working in darts as a voluntary scorer in 2010 and became a full PDC referee in 2013.Meanwhile, Bunting went on to beat Gian van Veen 6-2 in the final. Speaking after his win, Bunting said he had felt doubted before the tournament, with many people claiming he did not deserve his place. He added that he believes in his hard work and said these big nights are what he lives for, praising the crowd for helping him perform at his best.",Luke humphries lost 6-4 to stephen bunting in premier league darts quarter-final.

NFL Rumors: Patriots set to pair Stefon Diggs and A.J. Brown with Drake Maye,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/nfl-rumors-patriots-set-to-pair-stefon-diggs-and-a-j-brown-with-drake-maye/articleshow/128862193.cms,"Image via AP Photo

What reports say about Stefon Diggs vs. A.J. Brown pairing

What it means for Drake Maye and the Patriots’ offense

The New England Patriots might be getting ready to make big changes to their offense before the 2026 NFL season. Several rumors say that the team is looking at trading for Philadelphia Eagles wide receiver A.J. Brown so that he may play with Stefon Diggs and inexperienced quarterback Drake Maye.After falling short in the Super Bowl, New England is expected to be aggressive in reshaping its roster, particularly at wide receiver. While Diggs led the team in production last season, the Patriots’ passing attack lacked consistent firepower, prompting the front office to evaluate elite options on the trade market.According to insiders, the Patriots have internal interest in trading for Brown, who remains one of the NFL’s top wideouts. The move would likely depend on contract adjustments, particularly Diggs potentially restructuring his deal to create salary-cap flexibility.Diggs is scheduled to carry a significant cap hit for the 2026 season, but he was still New England’s most productive receiver in 2025 with over 1,000 receiving yards. Rather than moving on from him, the team reportedly sees a scenario where both receivers can coexist.The Patriots’ leadership has also pointed to existing relationships as a factor.Head coach Mike Vrabel previously worked with Brown during their time with the Tennessee Titans, and that connection could play a role if trade talks advance.For Drake Maye, the addition of another elite receiver could accelerate his growth as the team’s franchise quarterback. Young passers often benefit from experienced playmakers, and a Diggs-Brown tandem would give New England one of the most balanced receiving groups in the league.Last season, the Patriots had trouble being consistent on offense, especially in important games. A better group of receivers might help open up the field, make the red zone more effective, and take some of the load off Maye to run the offense by himself.However, several hurdles remain. Philadelphia has not signaled strong willingness to move Brown, and any deal would require significant draft capital along with financial adjustments. Eagles general manager Howie Roseman recently emphasized Brown’s importance to the team, suggesting a trade is possible but unlikely without a compelling offer.Still, the idea of Diggs and Brown lining up together continues to generate buzz around the league. If New England can pull off the trade, it may be one of the most important personnel changes of the offseason and change how people think about the Patriots going into 2026.","The new england patriots are reportedly looking at trading for philadelphia eagles wide receiver a.j.

T20 World Cup: Sri Lanka bow out of the tournament; Pakistan’s hopes dim

AHMEDABAD: South Africa have emerged as a strong contender for the World Cup title, but Aiden Markram feels the campaign has been a tiring one. “New Zealand, India and West Indies are quality team and to put in strong performances against sides like that gives you confidence,” Markram said.“But it honestly doesn’t feel easy. Every game drains you. The intensity is seriously high and you know things can change very quickly in T20 cricket. You wake up the next morning and it can all be over in a couple of days.”Markram credited the bowlers for keeping the big hitting West Indies to 176/8. He was effusive in his praise for allrounder Corbin Bosch , who nailed perfect yorkers in the final over and gave away just five runs. “He keeps it really simple, trains smartly and doesn’t give himself too many options,” Markram said.West Indies captain Shai Hope backed the aggressive batting approach even though the top order collapsed on Thursday. “There’s always some element of risk whenever you’re batting. So if you want to challenge the opposition, then you’ve got to find runs, especially on a surface like that which is so good. You still have to measure the risks in some way. If we just bat deep and only get 150-160 on a surface like that, it is always going to be tough work,” Hope said.",South africa have emerged as a strong contender for the world cup title.

Austin Reaves breaks silence with pointed three-word fix for Los Angeles Lakers slump

The Los Angeles Lakers have been making noise during the ongoing NBA season for all the wrong reasons. After a frustrating loss against the Phoenix Suns in a recent game, the Lakers are unfortunately unable to break their losing streak. Apart from witnessing one of the longest slumps in the 2025-26 NBA season, Los Angeles Lakers’ talented guard Austin Reaves shared a blunt message reflecting on the current condition of the popular NBA team.According to Austin Reaves, not everything has fallen apart for the Lakers, as the 27-year-old believes a lot can be done to improve the current situation of the team. He went on to drop a straightforward 3-word message to help the Lakers come out of the current situation.The Los Angeles Lakers are currently in one of the darkest phases during the ongoing NBA season. After losing three games back to back, the Lakers have diverted the attention of the world. After a frustrating 113-110 loss against the Phoenix Suns recently, the cracks in the team roster have become a talking point currently. However, amidst all this, Lakers’ guard Austin Reaves can still see the silver lining in the dark clouds.The dynamic NBA star recently dropped a blunt 3-word message for the Los Angeles Lakers. According to him, the team should focus on redirecting their focus on the positives instead of focusing on the negatives. During a recent postgame press conference, Austin Reaves said,“Control the controllables. There’s a handful of plays tonight. I feel like if we are better, it can swing a game. Every possession matters. I know it sounds like a cliché because there are so many of them, but it can swing the game in either direction.”He further continued,“Throughout the game, one little play, one little mistake can ignite a crowd, ignite a team, whatever it may be. So, control those controllables.”Austin Reaves’ message clearly emphasizes the current loss of the Lakers, which is related to the team’s issues with executing proper plans on the floor. Apart from the poor performance of the Lakers, Luka Doncic has become a hotbed of discussion in the NBA world due to his inconsistent performance and a whining attitude towards the referees.","The los angeles lakers are currently in one of the darkest phases during the ongoing nba season.

Drew McIntyre reflects on John Cena fight snub and future WWE goals



Life is going well for Drew McIntyre. The 40-year-old Scot is once again world champion in WWE and heading toward WrestleMania with momentum on his side. Yet one thing still lingers in his mind. McIntyre had hoped to face John Cena in a singles match during Cena’s retirement year. It looked possible after they shared the ring in a tag bout at Saturday Night’s Main Event last August.Two months later, plans were reportedly in place for McIntyre and Cena to clash at Crown Jewel in Australia. But the direction changed. Cena publicly teased a final match with AJ Styles , and fan reaction pushed WWE to pivot. That decision left McIntyre without the high-profile showdown he had envisioned.Speaking to Sun Sports , Drew McIntyre explained that he only knew what was presented to him at the time. He admitted that creative plans can shift quickly backstage depending on different circumstances. He suggested there may have been other match ideas discussed, but he chose not to go into detail. Instead, he said he focuses on what he can control rather than what happens behind the scenes.When he saw the social media reaction after John Cena’s comments, McIntyre said he was confused at first. It appeared to him as if fans believed a Drew versus Cena match had been officially announced and rejected. He later realized Cena had simply floated another idea involving AJ Styles, which understandably excited fans.McIntyre joked that it would have been nice if Cena had mentioned his name on Twitter too.Despite missing out, McIntyre said he would have loved the chance to share a ring or a promo with someone he considers one of the greatest with the mic in wrestling history. Still, he insisted there is no point dwelling on missed opportunities. In his view, things happen for a reason. Cena has now retired, and McIntyre stands as world champion, so he believes he is in a strong position.The Scot recently headlined WWE’s European tour to huge crowds. He remains hopeful that the UK will soon host one of WWE’s big four events. While major shows now take place worldwide, he believes it is only a matter of time before the UK lands one. He hopes it happens while he is still competing.","Wwe world champion drew mcintyre opens up on missed john cena fight, but says he has no regrets as he heads towards wrestlemania.

Mike Tomlin and Travis Kelce are reluctant as NBC reshapes its NFL desk

NBC is heading toward a serious makeover of its Sunday night NFL coverage. The network wants a fresh look at “Football Night in America” before the 2026 season. That push for change could end a long and steady chapter.After 17 seasons on air, Tony Dungy may be on his way out. The timing is awkward. NBC hoped to plug in bigger active names. Instead, two of its top targets have shown little desire to step into a studio chair. And surprisingly, those targets were none other than Travis Kelce and Mike Tomlin.The Athletic’s Andrew Marchand reported that Hall of Famer Tony Dungy is “likely out” as a regular on NBC’s pregame show. Marchand cited sources briefed on the move and said the network plans a revamp.“Hall of Famer Tony Dungy is likely out as a regular on ‘Football Night in America’ after 17 seasons, as NBC plans to revamp its NFL pregame show, sources briefed on the move told The Athletic,” Andrew Marchand wrote.NBC has not announced a decision. Dungy also has not been fully informed, leaving a narrow opening for a reduced role similar to past arrangements with Bob Costas and Al Michaels.Dungy joined NBC in 2009 after a Super Bowl-winning coaching run with the Indianapolis Colts.He built a reputation for calm analysis and credibility. Over the years, however, the panel expanded. Recent seasons featured Devin McCourty, Jason Garrett, Chris Simms, Rodney Harrison, Maria Taylor, Mike Florio, Matthew Berry, Jac Collinsworth and Steve Kornacki. NBC now appears ready to trim the table and reset the tone.The network first looked at headline names. Mike Tomlin remains central to talk about the next phase of his career. In January 2026, ESPN insider Peter Schrager said during NFL coverage that “there’s a chair waiting” for Tomlin on television and added that strong money would follow if he wanted it. Despite that, Tomlin seems focused on coaching again rather than shifting to broadcasting.Then comes Travis Kelce. Retirement chatter has followed him after another demanding season, yet people close to the situation expect him to return to the Kansas City Chiefs. His career still carries weight on the field. Marchand reported that if Kelce ever enters the media, he would rather call games from the booth than sit on a studio panel. That preference does not align with NBC’s current needs. Plus, reports also suggest that NBC is eyeing Aaron Rodgers and Cam Heyward. However, no official statement has been released.NBC wants a star presence and a sharper structure. Without Tomlin or Kelce stepping in, the network must decide whether to lean on fresh faces or rethink its strategy altogether. For now, Dungy’s future stands at the centre of that crossroads.","Tony dungy’s 17-year nbc run is in jeopardy as travis kelce and mike tomlin show no interest in studio roles.

Oliver Ekman-Larsson and Toronto Maple Leafs situation



The Toronto Maple Leafs are navigating a crucial stretch of their season as the NHL trade deadline draws closer, and veteran defenseman Oliver Ekman-Larsson has become part of the wider conversation. After an inconsistent run of NHL match results following the international break, pressure has mounted on management to determine whether the current roster can contend or requires adjustment.The Toronto Maple Leafs' recent play has made NHL trade rumors even stronger across the league. A lot of names have come up in rumors, but Oliver Ekman-Larsson is one of the most interesting ones because of his experience and consistent production. But now it's clear how the defenseman sees his own future with the team.The Toronto Maple Leafs have dropped key games in recent NHL updates, placing additional focus on roster decisions. According to NHL insider Nick Alberga , Oliver Ekman-Larsson has expressed a strong desire to stay in Toronto. Alberga reported that the veteran defenseman “loves Toronto” and wants to win with the Maple Leafs rather than relocate before the deadline.Ekman-Larsson does hold a 16-team trade list, which would provide flexibility if the Maple Leafs choose to move him.Still, his personal stance is clear; he hopes to remain and contribute during the playoff push. That preference could create tension if management decides a different path better serves the franchise’s long-term outlook.This season, Oliver Ekman-Larsson has scored eight goals and assisted on 27 others for a total of 35 points in 59 games. The fact that he can play a lot of minutes and help the offense from the blue line is a real plus. He also has a championship pedigree, having won the Stanley Cup with the Florida Panthers. This shows that he can handle pressure in the playoffs.As rumors about NHL trades keep going around, the Toronto Maple Leafs need to find a balance between being competitive and planning for the future. The choice they make about Oliver Ekman-Larsson will show what they plan to do for the rest of the season and beyond.","Oliver ekman-larsson wants to stay in toronto, according to nhl insider nick alberga.

Daniel Zellhuber determined to rebuild momentum at home



Daniel Zellhuber is ready for one of the biggest nights of his career. The 26-year-old lightweight will return to action at UFC Mexico inside Arena CDMX. For Zellhuber, this fight is more than just another bout. It is a homecoming. Before joining the UFC, he fought many times in Mexico City. Now, he gets to compete on the world’s biggest MMA stage in front of his people once again.Two years ago, Zellhuber earned a big win at the same venue. He defeated Francisco Prado by unanimous decision and even secured Fight of the Night honors. However, since that moment, things have not gone his way. He suffered back-to-back losses and dealt with injuries. Now, he hopes to turn things around against veteran King Green and begin 2026 on a positive note.Fighting in Mexico City means everything to Daniel Zellhuber. He said having his girlfriend, friends, and coaches around him makes the moment special. He explained that it feels like a dream come true. According to him, opportunities like this do not come often, and he feels grateful and blessed to experience it.The last time he fought in Arena CDMX, the crowd energy was unforgettable. He described the atmosphere as wild and said he enjoyed every second of it. That victory over Francisco Prado remains his last win in the Octagon. Since then, he has lost to Esteban Ribovics and veteran Michael Johnson Zellhuber admitted that 2025 was the toughest year of his professional career. He said he had only one fight and suffered a defeat. On top of that, he went through surgery and dealt with multiple injuries. He added that fans often do not see the personal struggles fighters face outside the cage. Still, he feels he has now surrounded himself with the right team and people. He is excited to show the difference on Saturday night.When asked about motivation, Zellhuber made it clear that commitment matters more. He explained that he does not wake up thinking about whether he feels motivated. Instead, he focuses on doing what needs to be done every day because his goal is to become a world champion.Now, he faces experienced lightweight King Green. Zellhuber knows Green’s style can be unusual and tricky. However, he believes his preparation and the support of the Mexican crowd will give him an edge. At 26 years old and entering his seventh UFC fight, Zellhuber wants to stay active this year. His plan is simple, win this weekend, fight again in July, and compete once more before the year ends.","Daniel zellhuber returns to action against veteran king green at ufc mexico.

Dylan Larkin powers Detroit Red Wings past Ottawa Senators



The Detroit Red Wings got a very important two points on Thursday night, thanks to another great game by captain Dylan Larkin.

When money talks louder than passion



Stefanos Tsitsipas has never been shy about speaking his mind, and his latest comments have stirred up a real conversation in the tennis world. The Greek star has finally explained why he skips the South American swing every season — the run of ATP events across Buenos Aires, Rio de Janeiro and Santiago that draws passionate crowds and some of the most electric atmospheres on tour. His answer was refreshingly direct: the money simply is not there. In a candid interview with Clay, Tsitsipas laid out his thinking without apology and it has got fans and players talking in equal measure.The timing matters because South American tennis is having a real moment right now. Local heroes are winning titles, crowds are packed and the region's players are pushing hard to attract bigger names to what they lovingly call the Golden Swing. So when a top-10 calibre player like Tsitsipas openly says he would rather head to the Middle East or Europe because the money is better, it lands differently.Tsitsipas was matter-of-fact when explaining his position. ""South America has never offered me a deal enticing enough to seriously consider it. The Middle East has always been far more lucrative. The European swing has also made me attractive financial offers.That makes all the difference. There's real passion in South America, but when the financial gap is that big, you really have no choice but to follow what best supports your career,"" the 27-year-old said.Fresh off claiming his first career ATP 250 title in Buenos Aires, World No. 19 Francisco Cerúndolo was asked to respond. The Argentine did not take the bait personally. Instead, he gave one of the more measured and confident replies ahead of his Santiago quarterfinal against Emilio Nava. Cerúndolo made it clear he has no interest in convincing anyone who is in it purely for the payday. ""If you don't want to come here, don't come. All those who want to play on clay, discover South American cities, and play a different style of tennis will be more inclined to join us. Those who don't will head to the Middle East or straight to Acapulco. The beauty of the schedule is that players can choose the tournaments they want to play. The positive is that the calendar is flexible, aside from the Masters 1000s and Grand Slams. After that, you can pick the ATP 250s and 500s you want to play — that is, go to places where you feel most comfortable,"" he said.It is a debate that will not go away anytime soon. South America has the passion. The question is whether it can ever close the financial gap to match it.",Cerúndolo hits back at tsitsipas over south america snub.
