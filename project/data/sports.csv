"19 years on, Kiran Desai has a 2nd shot at Booker",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/19-years-on-kiran-desai-has-a-2nd-shot-at-booker/articleshow/122986764.cms,"Nineteen years after winning the Man Booker, Kiran Desai, 53, has returned to the award longlist with a novel about two Indians navigating life in the US. The Indian American author, who became the prize's youngest-ever winner in 2006 with her second novel 'The Inheritance of Loss', is now among 13 writers vying for the literary trophy.Her mother Anita Desai - with whom she shares an inheritance, not of loss but of fine storytelling - has been shortlisted for the Booker thrice but never won. After her win, Kiran acknowledged the debt: ""I wrote this book so much in my mother's company that it feels almost like her book.' While the two craft very different literary landscapes, they do have many things in common, including the habit of escaping to Mexican villages to write. The 88-year-old Anita's last novella 'Rosarita', which released last year, was also set in Mexico.Kiran's longlisted 'The Loneliness of Sonia and Sunny' which will be out in Sept, has taken almost two decades to take shape. By her own admission, she writes slowly, piecing her novels together like a jigsaw puzzle. Going by the promos, the storyline seems almost filmi: a love story about two young people who first see each other on a train.But, as always, she remains conscious of her role in the wider world, exploring themes like migration, modernity, and the complicated bonds that link one generation to the next.""Intimate in its details, epic in its reach,"" is how Manasi Subramaniam, editor-in-chief at Penguin Random House India, describes it. ""While it is about the weight of familial love, the violence of class and the ache of displacement, it is sharp, funny, tragic and endlessly surprising,"" says Subramaniam.","Kiran desai, 53, is among 13 writers vying for the literary trophy.

Trade Outlook: A Deal Waiting to Happen?

With the 2025-26 NBA season approaching and theretooling for a serious title push, one key veteran could find himself on the trade block. According to a report by Devon Platana, forwardmay be the most likely Laker to be moved before opening night, as the franchise evaluates its options under the constraints of the salary cap.The Los Angeles Lakers ’ offseason moves have reshaped the team’s identity. Key acquisitions — including Deandre Ayton, Marcus Smart, and Jake LaRavia — have significantly improved head coach JJ Redick’s depth chart. But as the team eyes additional roster upgrades, especially on the wings, financial flexibility becomes a necessity.Given the Lakers’ current cap situation, further additions will likely require a trade, and Vanderbilt’s name continues to surface as a logical piece to be moved.Jarred Vanderbilt, acquired by the Lakers during the 2022-23 season, has had a turbulent tenure in Los Angeles. Known for his defensive versatility and hustle, his potential has been overshadowed by an ongoing struggle with injuries.Vanderbilt has only played in 65 regular-season contests and five playoff games since the beginning of the 2023-24 season, raising concerns about his reliability. Despite his effort on the court, availability remains a major issue. Jarred Vanderbilt is currently under contract for approximately $24 million over the next two seasons, and holds a $13.2 million player option for 2027-28. For a player who hasn’t been consistently available, this is a significant cap hit — especially for a team looking to compete at the highest level.Offloading Vanderbilt’s deal could open doors for the Lakers to pursue a more durable and productive veteran wing — a position that remains an area of need.Whether used in a straight salary dump or as part of a multi-player deal for a proven contributor, Vanderbilt’s expiring deal and defensive skill set could still be appealing to certain teams. However, his durability issues may limit the Lakers’ leverage in negotiations.As Devon Platana puts it: “He just isn’t the player L.A. needs him to be.” That statement encapsulates the shift in perception around Vanderbilt — from valuable rotation piece to trade candidate.The NBA offseason has already featured surprise trades, and Jarred Vanderbilt could be the next domino to fall. With the Lakers aggressively looking to maximize LeBron James’ and Anthony Davis’ remaining prime years, every roster spot matters. If Vanderbilt is unable to prove his durability before the season begins, his time in Los Angeles may indeed be coming to an end.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Los Angeles Lakers Potentially Eyeing Reunion With $2,291,897 Toronto Raptors Center to support LeBron James and Luka Donic As the summer progresses, expect the Lakers to explore all options — and that includes potentially saying goodbye to a familiar face in Jarred Vanderbilt.",Los angeles lakers forward jarred vanderbilt has struggled with injuries in recent seasons.

Dallas Mavericks’ Motivation: Now or Never?

Los Angeles Lakers’ Perspective: Holding the Cards

My Verdict on the Trade

Thehave emerged as a dark horse in thesweepstakes, with new reports suggesting that the team is seriously evaluating the possibility of acquiring the four-time NBA champion. Though LeBron has opted into the final year of his contract with the Los Angeles Lakers, The Athletic’s John Hollinger revealed that James showed serious interest in joining Dallas before making that decision.According to Bleacher Report’s Dan Favale, “Are we just supposed to believe he’s no longer intrigued by the prospect of reuniting with both Anthony Davis and Kyrie Irving?”—a question that points to the ongoing intrigue surrounding the potential formation of a new super team in Texas.The idea of LeBron James playing alongside Anthony Davis and Kyrie Irving is more than just fantasy. It’s grounded in both basketball chemistry and off-court relationships. James has previously expressed admiration for both stars, and his history with Irving is well documented—from their championship run in Cleveland to an up-and-down but ultimately successful on-court partnership.For Dallas, the potential acquisition of LeBron would be less about age and more about capitalizing on a small window.Even at 40, James averaged 25.7 points, 8.3 assists, and 7.3 rebounds in the 2023-24 season. His impact goes beyond numbers—his leadership, playoff experience, and basketball IQ are unmatched.Despite the appeal, Dallas faces serious logistical challenges. LeBron’s $52.7 million salary for the 2024-25 season is the first hurdle. While offseason rules allow teams to exceed the non-taxpayer mid-level exception to acquire buyout players, that doesn’t apply in this case since James is under contract.To make a deal work, the Dallas Mavericks would need to offload a significant portion of their roster. That could mean surrendering four to five players, as well as including draft capital.And even this framework may not be enough unless a third or fourth team is looped in to absorb salary or provide additional assets. The Lakers , meanwhile, are unlikely to take back long-term salary, as they are believed to be pursuing future cap space aggressively.What makes this pursuit different is Dallas’ sense of urgency. Coming off a Finals loss and looking to maximize Anthony Davis’ remaining years, the Mavericks are clearly open to high-stakes, high-reward moves. Pairing Anthony with LeBron and Kyrie could create one of the most formidable offensive trios in NBA history, if not the most experienced.Still, LeBron entering his age-41 season raises concerns. There’s no guarantee that the 20-time All-Star will maintain his elite level of play deep into the next campaign. But for a franchise that hasn’t won a title since 2011, the gamble might be worth the upside.From the Lakers’ standpoint, letting go of LeBron James isn’t as simple as it looks. Though he’s near the end of his career, James remains their most valuable asset—on the court and in marketing. Trading him for a package of role players and picks might not align with the franchise’s long-term plans unless it frees them to land a major star or opens up cap flexibility.The Mavericks’ rumored interest in LeBron James is more than just smoke—it’s a calculated, if risky, pursuit of championship relevance. As Dan Favale notes, “Bringing in LeBron is one thing if he’s coming off a buyout… It is another venture entirely when you have to account for his $52.7 million salary.”Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Los Angeles Lakers Potentially Eyeing Reunion With $2,291,897 Toronto Raptors Center to support LeBron James and Luka Donic Whether Dallas can pull off this blockbuster remains to be seen, but one thing is clear: the Mavericks are not content to stand still.

NHL insider reveals league-wide hesitation toward Carter Hart despite court ruling

NHL's decision lies with Gary Bettman , not the courts

FAQs

1. Can Carter Hart sign with any NHL team now?

2. Was Carter Hart found guilty in the Hockey Canada case?

3. Who decides Carter Hart's eligibility to return?

Despite being cleared of criminal charges in the Hockey Canada sexual assault trial, former Philadelphia Flyers goaltender Carter Hart’s NHL return is far from guaranteed. According to insider Frank Seravalli, Hart remains a “non-starter” for the Edmonton Oilers and, troublingly, for the rest of the league as well.In a revealing appearance on B/R Open Ice, Frank Seravalli explained that Hart's legal acquittal has not translated into NHL eligibility.“I was told that Carter Hart is a non-starter for the Edmonton Oilers, and beyond that, he's a non-starter for everyone right now, coming off of his acquittal in the Hockey Canada sexual assault case in court in London, Ontario, as ruled upon last week,” Seravalli said.Hart, along with four other former NHLers, was found not guilty in court. However, Seravalli clarified that the league continues to treat them as “ineligible,” with the NHL Commissioner’s office still reviewing the file.“Look, he's - him and the other four former NHL players have been labeled by the NHL as ineligible, and they're going to continue to review the file before determining next steps in the commissioner's office…” he added.Even though Hart could technically sign with any team once cleared, the power lies squarely with Commissioner Gary Bettman.The court may have dismissed criminal charges, but it did not absolve the players of actions the league deems “detrimental.”As Seravalli emphasized, “…so until they are cleared to play, it's not even really a conversation worth having, even though the NHLPA has strongly voiced their objection to how the NHL has viewed this situation.”The critical detail here is that the NHL’s collective bargaining agreement gives Bettman sweeping authority to determine a player's eligibility, irrespective of courtroom outcomes. That means unless the Commissioner changes his stance, Hart’s NHL career may remain indefinitely on pause.Also Read: Connor McDavid Trade Rumors: NHL MVP might follow Auston Matthews’ lead to control his future in Edmonton No, not until he’s officially cleared to play by the NHL.No, he was acquitted of all criminal charges in court.NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman has final say over his playing status.","Despite carter hart's acquittal in the hockey canada sexual assault case, his nhl return faces significant hurdles.

Why Kendrick Perkins Believes This Is Doncic’s MVP Year

Experts Remain Divided on Whether Fitness Equals MVP Form

How Doncic Is Reshaping the Lakers and Embracing Leadership

MVP or Not, the 2025-26 Season Is Doncic’s Defining Moment

’s dramatic offseason body transformation has become one of the NBA’s most talked-about stories—drawing praise, skepticism, and bold forecasts. Chief among them is former, who’s confidently predicting that Doncic will capture the 2025-26 MVP Award. The narrative goes far beyond aesthetics—it’s a deeper testament to work ethic, motivation, and the shifting trajectory of a superstar’s career.Now donning a Los Angeles Lakers jersey after a blockbuster trade from the Dallas Mavericks, Doncic has reshaped his image—literally. He faced widespread scrutiny during the 2024-25 season for inconsistent conditioning. But this summer, photos of a significantly leaner Doncic made headlines, particularly after his Men’s Health cover reveal. Sources confirm he committed to a strict diet and cardio-intensive routine, even stepping away from basketball drills for a month to focus solely on fitness. The result: increased stamina, improved mobility, and a renewed sense of purpose.Kendrick Perkins didn’t hold back his admiration. Speaking on ESPN, he said, “We ain’t looking at the chubby, fat Luka…We looking at skinny Luka. I saw his jawline…He is my early pick for MVP.”Perkins sees more than physical change—he sees a player stepping up to franchise expectations with real accountability.Kendrick Perkins’ prediction is rooted in a common narrative arc seen in NBA history—stars rising through adversity. He likened Luka Doncic ’s journey to those of greats like Michael Jordan, Giannis Antetokounmpo , and Nikola Jokic—players who all underwent physical and mental evolutions before reaching their peak. Doncic, already a five-time top-five MVP vote-getter, averaged 28.2 points, 8.2 rebounds, and 7.7 assists last season—even while battling late-game fatigue and defensive inconsistencies.Kendrick Perkins argues that with better conditioning and a deeper Lakers roster around him, Luka Doncic can now perform at a sustained, dominant level without the lapses that previously weakened his MVP case.Not all experts are sold on the idea that a leaner Luka automatically equals an MVP season. ESPN’s David Dennis Jr. was particularly blunt: “We’re discussing a player who should be aiming for MVP status, yet we’re applauding him for being in shape?…Being in shape doesn’t prevent you from losing focus on back screens or being left isolated during the playoffs.”Stephen A. Smith echoed similar sentiments, warning fans and analysts alike to wait and see if Doncic’s improved fitness leads to defensive consistency and postseason durability. For some, the challenge lies not in Luka’s physical readiness, but his leadership, mental focus, and ability to close out high-pressure games.Luka Doncic’s arrival in Los Angeles comes with massive expectations, especially after Dallas parted ways with him due to ongoing concerns about his conditioning. Early signs suggest he’s embracing a leadership role, helping to bring in key names like Deandre Ayton and Marcus Smart, and fully buying into the Lakers’ system.NBA insider Tim Bontemps believes Doncic’s MVP chances hinge on team success: “If the Lakers are in the 50-plus win range, and Luka is playing like he did two years ago, before he had the injuries and everything last year, Luka’s going to have a shot [at the MVP award].”Luka Doncic’s transformation goes well beyond surface-level buzz. It represents a turning point—one where he appears fully engaged, motivated, and willing to make the sacrifices necessary to lead a franchise. Whether it culminates in the MVP trophy, as Kendrick Perkins boldly suggests, depends on whether “Skinny Luka” can deliver more than just an improved physique—he’ll need wins, leadership, and postseason excellence.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Dallas Mavericks Weigh Risky but Ambitious Move for $52.6 Million Los Angeles Lakers Legend to form Big 3 with Anthony Davis and Kyrie Irving Regardless of how it unfolds, Luka Doncic’s next season promises to be his most compelling yet.","Luka doncic’s dramatic offseason body transformation has become one of the most talked-about stories in the nba.

NHL Trade Rumors: Nazem Kadri could join Montreal Canadiens after Toronto Maple Leafs blocked by Calgary Flames,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/nhl-trade-rumors-nazem-kadri-could-join-montreal-canadiens-after-toronto-maple-leafs-blocked-by-calgary-flames/articleshow/122983328.cms,"Bill Wippert/Getty

Calgary Flames shut door on Toronto Maple Leafs, Nazem Kadri eyes Montreal Canadiens as realistic trade option

Montreal Canadiens could land reliable veteran Nazem Kadri with proven scoring punch and leadership

FAQs:

1. How many Stanley Cups has Nazem Kadri won?

2. When was Nazem Kadri drafted and by which team?

Nazem Kadri may be headed back to the Eastern Conference and the Montreal Canadiens could be the front-runners. With Calgary reportedly refusing to negotiate any trades with the Toronto Maple Leafs, Kadri’s list of potential destinations has effectively narrowed to just one team. Given his consistent production and Montreal’s need for veteran help up the middle, this could be a perfect short-term fit.Nazem Kadri is reportedly open to a trade to either the Montreal Canadiens or his former team, the Toronto Maple Leafs. However, with Calgary Flames management unwilling to make a deal with Toronto, still harboring friction from Brad Treliving’s tenure as Flames GM that path appears closed.Sportsnet’s Nick Kypreos reported that Treliving has previously tried to acquire players like Chris Tanev, Nikita Zadorov, and Rasmus Andersson from Calgary, but has been shut down at every turn. That history makes it highly unlikely that the Flames would greenlight any trade that sends Kadri back to the Maple Leafs.This leaves the Canadiens as the only viable trade destination Kadri would reportedly consider. Montreal’s growing core, including top prospect Ivan Demidov and head coach Martin St. Louis’ high-skill system could make the Canadiens an appealing spot for the 34-year-old centerman.Kadri is coming off back-to-back seasons of 67 and 75 points, playing a full 82 games in both campaigns.He has tallied 710 points in 985 NHL games and once posted a 100-point pace during the 2021–22 season with Colorado. At 6-foot and 185 pounds, Kadri brings experience, physicality, and versatility to any middle-six unit.With Montreal’s top prospect Michael Hage still developing, Kadri could be a strong short-term option to stabilize the Canadiens' second line alongside Demidov. His leadership and playoff pedigree would be especially valuable to a young team looking to take the next step.If Calgary refuses to deal with Toronto, the road is clear for the Montreal Canadiens to pursue Nazem Kadri. Given his proven scoring ability and desire for a fresh start, a move to Montreal could benefit both sides, if the price is right. As trade rumors heat up, the Canadiens may quietly be positioning themselves for a bold veteran addition.Kadri won one Stanley Cup with the Colorado Avalanche during the 2021–22 NHL season.Kadri was drafted 7th overall by the Toronto Maple Leafs in the 2009 NHL Draft.Also Read: NHL Trade Rumors: Kyle Connor likely to re-sign as Winnipeg Jets pursue long-term contract extension amid NHL free agency buzz","Nazem kadri is reportedly open to a trade to either the montreal canadiens or his former team, the toronto maple leafs.

A prominent NBA analyst's list of the top ten guards in the league did not include Chris Paul, the recently acquired star of the Los Angeles Clippers. Even though ESPN's Kendrick Perkins, who played against the said player in the AAU and then the NBA, considers him to be the real ""point god,"" he places him in his Top 15 rather than the top 10. Recently, the analyst opened up about the same thing.The Los Angeles Clippers ' Chris Paul is seen by most as one of the greatest point guards ever in NBA history. The 40-year-old is now close to the end of his career as he begins his 21st season in the league. Kendrick Perkins made one comparison apparent, but he didn't provide a comprehensive list of those who rate higher than CP3. He has a higher opinion of the former Oklahoma City Thunder player Russell Westbrook.He stated during the most recent podcast episode Road Trippin’:""I don't have CP3 ranked above Russell Westbrook. Like CP3 does a lot of things, changes the franchise, win a lot of games and things? Yes, absolutely. I would never take that away from him. Since he was drafted by the Pelicans, he changed that franchise…”He continued:""He goes to the Clippers, winning organization.

The Milwaukee Bucks came back with four straight victories after CP3 led the Phoenix Suns to within two games of the 2021 NBA championship. After winning Game 1, Russell Westbrook and the Oklahoma City Thunder made it to the Finals in 2012 as well.However, it is not certain what additional accomplishments Kendrick Perkins wants for Chris Paul aside from a championship or a regular-season MVP.

Kahleah Copper leaves court after wig falls during the game

Fan was ejected from Phoenix Mercury game after mocking Kahleah Copper

FAQs

Why was the game between Phoenix Mercury and Washington Mystics stopped?

Who was the fan that got ejected from the game?

Who alerted security about the fan's behavior?

In a recent WNBA game featuring the Phoenix Mercury and the Washington Mystics, something unexpected happened that paused the game for a bit and led to a fan getting kicked out of the arena. The whole situation revolved around Phoenix Mercury's star, Kahleah Copper, whose wig came off during the game, triggering a series of events that culminated in a fan being removed for acting inappropriately.An unexpected moment happened late in the third quarter of the game on Sunday. Kahleah Copper, a four-time WNBA All-Star and Olympic gold medalist, was moving around a screen set by her teammate when her wig got caught. It was accidentally yanked off by Washington Mystics guard Jade Melbourne, landing on the court for everyone to see. According to some reports ""The player who lost her wig was Kahleah Copper, and it was accidentally pulled off by Jade Melbourne during the game"".Without delay, Mercury signaled for a timeout. Copper, looking quite embarrassed, quickly grabbed her wig and rushed off the court to the locker room to sort it out.Reports say that ""Copper rushed back to the dressing room after the wig malfunction"". The game had a short pause, and the broadcasting team Meghan McPeak and Christy Winters Scott opted to deal with the matter gently, referring to it as a ""malfunction"" without specifically mentioning the wig, likely out of respect for Copper’s privacy.Copper came back after the timeout to finish the game, which the Mercury won 88-72, thanks to a standout performance from Alyssa Thomas. However, Copper struggled, scoring only 6 points on 2-for-8 shooting, a dip from her usual form. She also contributed three assists and three rebounds. Meanwhile, Thomas dominated with 27 points, 11 rebounds, and eight assists, becoming the first WNBA player to record 150 rebounds and 175 assists in 20 games.The Mercury players noticed the fan's antics and took matters into their own hands, surrounding the officials to identify the individual. According to the user query, ""After the wig fell off, the game was delayed, and then a fan was ejected for making fun of Copper"". Mercury players saw how the fan was acting and decided to step in, gathering around the officials to highlight the person. As mentioned in the user query, ""Copper’s teammates were seen surrounding the officials, causing them to alert the arena’s security, who then removed the fan in question. ""Also Read: Stephen Curry says NBA players like him are “underpaid” despite $62 million salary The fan's ridicule obviously went too far, causing the Mercury players to take action.

Oulun Kärpät

Veteran ex-Columbus Blue Jackets defenseman Markus Nutivaara is returning at the professional level after a tumultuous injury-compelled retirement. The 31-year-old signed a one-year contract with his hometown Liiga powerhouse, Kärpät. It's the first official on-ice activity since he played one game for the Florida Panthers in October 2021, a contest that capped his long battle with nagging hip injuries.Markus Nutivaara, a reliable blue liner for the Columbus Blue Jackets, will be lacing up his skates once again in Oulu, Finland, with Kärpät. The Finnish defenseman has not appeared in professional hockey since Oct. 29, 2021, when he played roughly seven minutes for the Florida Panthers.
