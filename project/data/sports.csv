WBC welterweight champion recreates Kobe Bryant’s iconic 2001 NBA Championship pose

What was the story behind Kobe Bryant’s iconic 2001 NBA championship picture?

NBA legend Kobe Bryant receives an unexpected gesture from the newly crowned WBC welterweight champion, Ryan Garcia. Garcia paid a powerful tribute to the NBA veteran, holding his belt the same way Kobe did after winning his second championship. It was in 2001, after the Los Angeles Lakers defeated the Philadelphia 76ers. In June 2026, it will be 25 years since the iconic photograph of Kobe went viral.Every now and then, Kobe receives tribute from athletes across different sports. The NBA legend has left behind an irreplaceable legacy that inspired not only young basketball players but also aspiring athletes from other sports categories as well. Ryan Garcia’s latest tribute is the best example of it. Garcia’s photograph went viral almost immediately.On February 21, 2026, WBC got its new welterweight champion. Born in 1998, the 27-year-old athlete defeated Mario Barrios to win the championship. It was a unanimous decision. Garcia knocked down Barrios in just 23 seconds. Moments after the young boxer claimed the title, a photograph of him went viral, taking the internet by storm. Garcia decided to pay tribute to the NBA legend Kobe Bryant.The boxer copied the basketball legend’s pose from the 2001 NBA championship. Kobe could be seen holding his trophy with one hand and his chin rested on the palms of his other hand. Garcia made a slight change to the pose as he held the belt on one of his shoulders and his other hand rested across his legs. The image went viral and comparisons started pouring in between the young athlete and the NBA legend.It was Kobe Bryant’s second NBA championship. The Los Angeles Lakers defeated the Philadelphia 76ers in Philly. After the win, Kobe was spotted sitting in the shower stall holding the trophy and crying. While everyone thought it was out of joy, the legend later revealed that it was about his father. Kobe had a falling out with his father, Joe Bryant, regarding the Lakers legend’s marriage to Vanessa. Kobe’s father apparently did not approve of Vanessa, who was a Latina. Joe was uncomfortable with Kobe’s devotion towards her, as reported by the Los Angeles Times. This was the reason why Kobe’s parents did not attend the NBA championship series even though it was held in Kobe’s hometown. This is actually the story behind Kobe’s iconic 2001 NBA championship picture.","Wbc welterweight champion recreates kobe bryant’s iconic 2001 nba championship pose.

NEW DELHI: As the IPL 2026 season approaches, the big question around MS Dhoni’s future has come up once again: will the Chennai Super Kings legend play every match this season?Dhoni, who will turn 45 later this year, is set to be available for CSK, but it looks unlikely that he will feature in all games.A top CSK source confirmed his availability. “We can confirm this much that he is coming to Chennai and had confirmed his availability for the season,"" the source told PTI.However, the same source added, “Whether he will play all games or not is something we can't say at the moment.”With the arrival of Sanju Samson, CSK now have multiple wicketkeeping options, which could reduce Dhoni’s workload.Samson is expected to keep wickets in matches where Dhoni sits out, while other keepers like Urvil Patel and young recruit Kartik Sharma are also in the squad.In recent seasons, Dhoni’s role with the bat has been limited due to the Impact Player rule, and he has mostly played as a finisher in specific situations.Managing his fitness will also be important, as he has dealt with knee and back issues in recent years, and the physical demands of wicketkeeping can be tough with packed schedules.However, Dhoni is likely to play most of CSK’s home matches at Chepauk, where his presence still excites fans like no other. His bond with the Chennai crowd remains strong, and every time he walks onto the field, it sends the stadium into a frenzy.","Ms dhoni set to be available for chennai super kings in ipl 2026.

NEW DELHI: South Africa hammered India by 76 runs in their opening Super 8 match of the T20 World Cup, handing the hosts a reality check and exposing serious flaws in their batting at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad on Sunday. Chasing 188, India collapsed to 111 in 18.5 overs on a tricky surface, with the Proteas bowlers dominating throughout.Marco Jansen, Keshav Maharaj and Corbin Bosch led a collective bowling effort, while Jasprit Bumrah ’s brilliant spell earlier in the game went in vain. For South Africa, David Miller, Dewald Brevis and Tristan Stubbs played crucial roles in lifting the total to 187/7 after an early wobble.After the match, South Africa captain Aiden Markram praised his team for reading the conditions well and executing their plans.“Great performance. Very different type of wicket to what we’ve had here, so great to see the boys assess that pretty early and adapt their skills to execute their plans,” he said at the post-match presentation.Markram highlighted the importance of the Miller-Brevis partnership, adding, “I think first and foremost was the partnership. (Miller and Brevis) The guys were great, put that together for us, steadied the ship and kept us in the game.”He explained how the team adjusted its approach in the latter half of the innings, noting, “so it was about finding space where we could run hard, drop the ego and take as much as we could at the back end.”Markram also praised his bowling group, calling their performance a big boost after a slow start to the tournament.""We’re going to make mistakes, we don’t mind that as a group, so we’ll brush those aside. We feel like Lungi is a threat whenever he bowls and that he can take wickets for us in that middle phase. It depends on conditions,"" he added.Looking ahead, he warned against complacency, describing West Indies as “a dangerous T20 side” and stressing the need to stay sharp for the upcoming clash.India, meanwhile, endured a disastrous batting display. Early wickets put them on the back foot, and none of the top-order batters managed to build a meaningful innings on a surface where the ball gripped, and timing was difficult.Even Suryakumar Yadav struggled to find fluency, while the middle order could not recover from the early collapse. Hardik Pandya and Shivam Dube tried to rebuild, but South Africa’s disciplined bowling plans shut down any late fightback.","South africa beat india by 76 runs in their opening super 8 match of the t20 world cup.

NEW DELHI: The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) has taken strong action against former women’s team selector Monjurul Islam after serious misconduct allegations were raised by former women’s captain Jahanara Alam Following an investigation, the board has banned Monjurul from any cricket-related role under the BCB, either directly or indirectly. The inquiry committee looked into four allegations linked to an incident during the 2022 Women’s World Cup.While two claims could not be proven due to lack of evidence, the panel found initial proof of inappropriate behaviour in the other two cases and said his conduct fell under harassment and misconduct rules.The BCB confirmed the decision in a statement, saying, “Based on the findings of the Independent Inquiry Committee formed by the BCB to examine the complaint lodged by former Bangladesh Women's National Team Captain Jahanara Alam, the Board has decided to impose a ban on former national cricketer Monjurul Islam from all forms of direct or indirect employment and/or cricket-related activities under the jurisdiction of the Bangladesh Cricket Board.The board added that it is still reviewing the committee’s recommendations and may take further steps, stating, “The BCB is reviewing the recommendations of the Committee and will take any additional measures deemed necessary in light of the report.”Monjurul had already completed his contract with the BCB in June 2025, but the board said his behaviour did not meet professional standards.In the same meeting, the BCB announced the schedule for the first-ever Women’s Bangladesh Premier League, which will be played from April 4 to 14, 2026, in Dhaka and Chattogram. The board also gave a one-month extension to chief selector Gazi Ashraf Hossain while they search for his replacement.Explaining this, the BCB said, “In view of his intention to step down at the end of his tenure as Chairman National Selection Panel, the Board has decided to offer a one-month extension to Gazi Ashraf Hossain.

T20 World Cup: Ryan ten Doeschate press conference after India's loss against South Africa

Bumrah and the rest



Jasprit Bumrah was one bright spark for India on an otherwise poor day against South Africa in the T20 World Cup Super Eight. (AP)

Brief Scores:

South Africa: 187 for 7 in 20 overs (David Miller 63, Dewald Brevis 45, Tristan Stubbs 44; Jasprit Bumrah 3/15, Arshdeep Singh 2/28).

India: 111 all out in 18.5 overs (Shivam Dube 42; Marco Jansen 4/22, Keshav Maharaj 3/24, Corbin Bosch 2/12).

The first game of India's Super Eight campaign provided a rude reality check as they were completely outplayed by South Africa at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad. Chasing the 188-run target, the famed batting line-up never got going and succumbed to the big-game pressure in front of over 90,000 people. The run-chase lacked application, intent, and discipline. Whatever could go wrong, went wrong for Suryakumar Yadav & Co as they lost the fixture by a heavy 76-run margin.Questionable shot selection, lack of partnerships, and some fine bowling by South Africa led to the hosts' downfall, ending their unbeaten 12-match streak in T20I World Cups. For a side that had dominated the format since winning the title in the Caribbean in 2024, Sunday's showing, particularly the batting, was nothing short of an embarrassment. The team, which effortlessly posted huge scores and breezed past massive totals, managed only 57 at the half-way mark of the run-chase and had half their side cooling their heels in the dugout.Concerning signs were apparent in the group stage too, but the bowlers continued to find a way and get the job done.However, the thin cracks got exposed when they were asked to chase. The pressure of the big stage clearly overwhelmed the batting as Ishan Kishan, Abhishek Sharma and Tilak Varma played some very ordinary shots. Abhishek sighed with relief when he scored his first run of the tournament, courtesy of a boundary, but he never looked at ease during his stay in the middle. The left-hander looked very short on confidence, and so did India's designated No.3 Tilak Varma.Tilak has been scrutinised for his poor strike rate, and while he has enjoyed the backing of the selectors, coaches and team leadership, his performances aren't inspiring much confidence. India tried to shake things up by promoting Washington Sundar up the order but even that backfired, just like his overall selection for this game ahead of the experienced Axar Patel. India's vice-captain was on the bench for the second match in a row, and his absence was dearly felt with both bat and ball.Shivam Dube fought a lone battle and minimised the net run-rate damage but the writing was clearly on the wall, leaving only mere formalities before South Africa sealed the comprehensive win. Marco Jansen & Co. combined to completely dominate the hosts and their smart use of the pitch, and conditions, helped them make a statement.Earlier, Jasprit Bumrah and Arshdeep Singh combined to keep the Proteas under the 200-run mark. The innings can be divided into three phases. India dominated the powerplay, taking three wickets. South Africa rebuilt with David Miller and Dewald Brevis, but India seized control again between overs 16 and 19.In the final four overs, the Aiden Markram-led unit scored 23 runs and lost three wickets, undoing the middle-phase efforts of Miller and Brevis, who combined to put together 97 runs. They also lost the same number of wickets in the powerplay but had a plan for the spin threat that was coming their way. The left-right combination targeted Varun Chakravarthy and never allowed India's X-factor to settle down on a pitch that offered little for spin.In his first two overs, the World No.1 T20I bowler leaked 28 runs and Miller looked dangerous in front of the capacity crowd. From the moment he walked out to bat in the fourth over, the left-hander operated with calculated intent. He hit the ball where it was meant to be hit and didn't retreat after the early wickets. The presence of a busy Brevis at the other end gave the innings the much-needed impetus, and the two put on a breezy 97-run stand off just 50 deliveries.When they were batting, a total of 200+ seemed very achievable, but India did well to pull things back in the final phase. Bumrah was at his menacing best in both the powerplay and the death overs. His last two overs conceded only 8 runs and another wicket added to his match tally made him India's most successful bowler in T20I World Cup history.Arshdeep sustained pressure from the other end with just a 7-run 18th over but the 20th over, bowled by Hardik, swayed momentum in South Africa's favour. Tristan Stubbs hit back-to-back sixes off the final two deliveries to end the innings emphatically at 187/7. T20I cricket is all about riding the momentum when it is on your side. South Africa did that with the bat in the final over and then the bowlers later rode on it to outplay India in their first Super Eight clash.","South africa beat india by 76 runs in the t20 world cup super eight.

India T20 World Cup Qualification Scenario

Scenario 1 – India win both matches

Scenario 2 – India win one match

India’s hopes of reaching the T20 World Cup 2026 semi-finals have taken a serious hit after a crushing 76-run defeat to South Africa in their opening Super 8 fixture in Ahmedabad on Sunday. Led by Suryakumar Yadav , India were thoroughly outplayed as the Proteas dominated both innings.South Africa, after opting to bat first, posted a commanding 187/7. David Miller anchored the innings with a fluent 63, while Dewald Brevis provided momentum with a brisk 45. Despite Jasprit Bumrah ’s impressive spell of 3/15, India were unable to prevent South Africa from finishing strongly.The chase unravelled quickly. India never settled into any rhythm and were eventually bowled out for just 111. Marco Jansen was the chief destroyer with four wickets, sealing a comprehensive win and inflicting major damage on India’s Net Run Rate, which now stands at -3.800.The defeat leaves India in a must-win situation. They need victories in both of their remaining Super 8 matches against West Indies and Zimbabwe to ensure qualification for the Final Four. Even then, scenarios could complicate matters.If India secure wins in both fixtures, they will finish with four points.In most cases, that should be enough to qualify. However, complications arise if South Africa win only one of their remaining matches and the winner of the West Indies vs Zimbabwe clash also defeats South Africa. In that situation, three teams could end up on four points, pushing qualification to Net Run Rate calculations. Ideally for India, South Africa winning both of their remaining matches would simplify the equation and reduce reliance on NRR.If India manage just one win, they will require South Africa to win all their remaining games. Additionally, India’s sole victory must come against the winner of the West Indies vs Zimbabwe contest. That outcome would leave India, West Indies and Zimbabwe level on two points each, once again making Net Run Rate the deciding factor.India now find themselves under immense pressure. A defeat alone may not have been disastrous, but the scale of the loss and the severe blow to their Net Run Rate have left their campaign hanging by a thread.",India lost to south africa by 76 runs in their opening super 8 fixture.

Jeremiah Owusu’s NFL career seems doubtful amid the latest injury update

Jeremiah Owusu-Koramoah’s football future suddenly feels uncertain amid the latest injury update. The Cleveland Browns linebacker has not played since a frightening neck injury in 2024, and fresh reporting suggests a return is far from certain. For a 26-year-old Pro Bowler entering his prime, that reality hits hard. Now the focus has shifted from comeback timelines to a much tougher question: whether he will ever step on an NFL field again.The turning point came on October 27, 2024. During a Week 8 game against the Baltimore Ravens, Owusu-Koramoah collided violently with running back Derrick Henry. Trainers rushed onto the field, and he left on a cart before doctors transported him to a local hospital. That moment immediately raised fears beyond a routine injury.Soon after, the Cleveland Browns placed him on the reserve/physically unable to perform list. He has not played since. In the latest report of Cleveland.com, reporter Mary Kay Cabot wrote that a league source described Owusu-Koramoah as “doubtful at best” to return to the field after the serious neck trauma. The wording alone signalled how severe the situation remains.The Browns had already ruled him out for the entire 2025 season. In May 2025, general manager Andrew Berry explained the decision in a team statement announcing the PUP placement.“Jeremiah’s health is of the utmost importance to us… We will not make any predictions on Jeremiah’s football future at this time,” Berry said in the Browns’ May 2025 roster update. Also, Owusu-Koramoah later addressed fans in a public statement released through the team, saying he would focus on recovery, mindset, and faith while trusting his medical team.Amid the news, many fans shared their concern. A fan said, “Dude, seriously… man, he is a phenomenal LB. So sad 😞.”Some fans blamed Darrick Henry for the situation and said, “Darrick Henry really ended a great career ☹️.”Another folk added, “Thoughts with him, man, that’s brutal news for jok.”That uncertainty overshadows an impressive start to his career. The former Notre Dame standout entered the league as a 2021 second-round pick and quickly became one of Cleveland’s defensive engines. In 49 games, he logged 302 tackles, eight sacks, three interceptions, and multiple impact plays that earned him Pro Bowl recognition.Yet neck injuries carry a unique risk. Even steady progress does not guarantee clearance for contact. So the title question remains justified. Right now, Owusu-Koramoah’s NFL future hangs in medical hands, not coaching plans. Until doctors deliver a definitive answer, his comeback stays uncertain, and retirement remains a very real possibility.","Cleveland browns linebacker jeremiah owusu-koramoah has not played since a frightening neck injury in 2024.

Today it was much better, but my body still didn’t feel completely right.”“But I’m very, very happy because the feeling with the bike was good all morning, and I was riding well. All three crashes I had this weekend were due to a lack of concentration. Of course, when you lose concentration, you go over the limit.

One fan wrote on X.""I have another question, can somebody tell me why Washington Sundar is not bowling to David Miller , if he was selected over Axar with lefties excuse?Does anything make sense under Gambhir?""Similar sentiments among fans over the Axar Patel omission call followed.In the match, South Africa had a shaky start after opting to bat.Jasprit Bumrah and Arshdeep Singh struck early, reducing them to 20/3 in just four overs.However, David Miller and Dewald Brevis staged a strong comeback, attacking India’s bowlers and shifting the momentum.Miller took on Varun Chakravarthy and Arshdeep Singh with powerful boundaries, while Brevis joined in with aggressive shots against Washington Sundar and others.The pair added quick runs and pushed the scoring rate up, helping South Africa recover to 84/3 at the halfway stage.Nevertheless, South Africa posted a strong total of 187/7 in their 20 overs after choosing to bat against India.After losing early wickets, Miller (63 off 35) and Brevis (45 off 29) led a crucial recovery, while Stubbs (44* off 24) provided a late surge.Bumrah was the standout bowler with 3/15, supported by Arshdeep’s 2/28, but India still face a challenging chase.","India captain suryakumar yadav revealed that vice-captain axar patel was left out again, with washington sundar keeping his spot.

United WE Announces Brittany Mahomes as First Champion for Change Winner



""at the decision-making table,""

In Kansas City, the Mahomes name is synonymous with winning but while Patrick is busy leading the Chiefs and recovering from his injury, Brittany Mahomes is carving out a legacy that is arguably just as historic. On February 19, 2026, it was officially announced that Brittany has been named the inaugural recipient of the Champion for Change Award by United WE.The honor isn't just a ""thank you"" for being a local celebrity, it’s a recognition of the serious economic and cultural shift Brittany has spearheaded in Missouri and beyond.The primary reason for the award is Brittany’s visionary leadership in women’s professional sports. As a co-owner of the KC Current, she didn't just buy into a team, she invested in an entire ecosystem. She was a driving force behind the construction of CPKC Stadium, which made global headlines for being the first stadium on Earth built specifically for a women’s professional team.United WE noted that her leadership proves that when women arethe entire economy grows stronger. By treating women’s sports as a ""growing economic engine"" rather than a side project, she has changed the blueprint for sports ownership in America.Beyond the soccer pitch, the award highlights her philanthropic work. Alongside her husband, Patrick Mahomes , Brittany has channeled millions through the 15 and the Mahomies Foundation. These funds have gone directly into underserved communities, focusing on children's health, wellness, and educational opportunities.The organization emphasized that Brittany’s role as an entrepreneur, investor, and mother of three makes her the perfect face for this new award. She represents a generation of women who aren't just participating in the conversation, they are leading it.Randi Mahomes celebrated this achievement of her daughter-in-law on her Instagram story, sharing her excitement and publicly showing support for Brittany’s special milestone.The award will be presented on May 6, 2026, during a milestone event at CPKC Stadium. It’s a full-circle moment for Brittany, receiving the ""Champion for Change"" honor in the very venue she helped build to change the game for women.As she continues to expand her reach including her recent induction into the UT Tyler Athletics Hall of Fame, Brittany Mahomes is proving that her impact on Kansas City is only just beginning.And as for Patrick Mahomes, who after the most difficult season of his career is finally giving Chiefs Kingdom something to smile about. As of late February 2026, the three-time Super Bowl MVP is well into his recovery from the torn ACL and LCL that ended his 2025 campaign prematurely.","Brittany mahomes has been named the inaugural recipient of the champion for change award by united we.

Mens Hockey Olympics : Sidney Crosby ruled out as Canada faces Finland after both teams win dramatic overtime quarterfinals

Winter Olympics fans woke up early on Friday ready to watch one of the biggest games of the 2026 Milano Cortina Games. But many were shocked when they could not see the start of the Canada vs Finland men’s hockey semifinal on regular TV. The game began at 10:40 a.m. Eastern Time. Instead of airing live on cable, the opening part of the matchup was available only on Peacock. USA Network, which is owned by NBCUniversal, showed the women’s speed skating 1500m during that time. NBC later scheduled delayed coverage of the hockey game at 11:50 a.m. ET on USA Network.Fans quickly shared their anger online. Many said they felt frustrated that such a major semifinal was not shown live on television. The matchup featured top-seeded Canada and defending 2022 Olympic champion Finland, making the decision even more surprising for viewers across the United States.The semifinal was already a huge story before the broadcast issue. Canada entered the game as the No. 1 seed, while Finland came in as the defending gold medalist from the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing.Both teams fought hard in the quarterfinals earlier in the week.Finland edged Switzerland 3-2 in overtime. Canada also needed extra time to beat Czechia 4-3. Those close wins set up what many believed would be one of the best hockey games of the tournament.However, Canada had to prepare without its captain, Sidney Crosby. The veteran forward suffered a lower-body injury during Wednesday’s quarterfinal and was ruled out of the semifinal. His absence was another major talking point heading into Friday’s game.Still, much of the online reaction focused on the broadcast choice. Fans took to X to express how they felt.One fan wrote, “Not having this Canada-Finland hockey game on a dedicated tv channel is infuriating to me.”Another posted, “Absolutely wild the Canada Finland semi final game isn’t on tv right now.”A different viewer added, “Why is my USA channel playing speed skating??? All your stars yet I have to have peacock to watch???”One more comment read, “Everywhere I look, I see that USA Network is supposed to be broadcasting the CAN/FIN hockey semifinal. Yet — they aren’t.”For many hockey fans, the issue was not about streaming itself. It was about missing the first hour of a major Olympic semifinal on traditional television. With two strong teams on the ice and a place in the gold medal game at stake, viewers expected full live coverage from the opening puck drop.","The canada vs finland men’s hockey semifinal began at 10:40 a.m. eastern time.

A peaceful base away from the tour for Novak Djokovic



Tennis legend Novak Djokovic has spent years living out of suitcases, hotel rooms and player lounges. So when he goes home, he really goes home. For the tennis great, that place is Marbella, Spain — a quiet, sun-soaked corner of the Costa del Sol where he can switch off from the noise of the tour and just be with his family. His villa is located in Sierra Blanca, one of Marbella’s most private and high-end residential areas. It sits slightly above the coastline, with open views of the Mediterranean and the mountains behind it. The neighborhood is known for security and seclusion. For someone as globally recognized as Djokovic, that kind of privacy isn’t a luxury, but a necessity.The house is large but not flashy. It is reported to span close to 1,000 square metres, with open living spaces and several bedrooms. Inside, the design is simple and calm, with marble floors, soft colours and large glass doors that bring in natural light. Outside, there is a spacious swimming pool and open terraces where the family can relax. The gardens are neatly kept and offer privacy and quiet.The villa also supports his training routine. It reportedly has nine bedrooms and eight bathrooms, along with a private gym and a spa area that includes a sauna and Turkish bath.There is a cinema room, a games room and a private tennis court where he can practise away from the public eye. With sea and mountain views around the property, the home works as both a peaceful retreat and a private training base. For a player known for his strict routines and recovery work, having those facilities at home makes sense. Even in downtime, the work doesn’t completely stop.The mansion is believed to be worth around $10 million approximately, reflecting both the prime location and its size. Djokovic is said to have settled there around 2020, after spending time in the area and enjoying the climate. Marbella offers warm weather most of the year, which is ideal for training. But more importantly, it offers space that is away from cameras and constant attention.For fans, it’s nice to see this side of Djokovic. On court, he is intense and fully focused. In Marbella, life is quieter and slower for the tennis icon. His home seems not about showing off, but about comfort, privacy and balance. After everything he has achieved in tennis, that may be what matters most.","Novak djokovic's marbella mansion has stunning views of the mediterranean sea.

She performed her free skate to “MacArthur Park” at the Milano Ice Skating Arena and moved ahead of Japan’s Kaori Sakamoto, who won silver, and Ami Nakai, who took bronze.After her skate, Alysa Liu smiled, brushed off her shoulders, and waved to the crowd. The result was confirmed by official Olympic scoring shared with media on site. This was one of the biggest moments for Team USA in Italy.The hockey final came down to seconds. Team USA trailed late against Canada in the gold-medal game on Thursday. Then Hilary Knight tipped a shot from Laila Edwards with just 124 seconds left to tie the game 1-1.In overtime, Megan Keller scored 4 minutes and 7 seconds in to seal a 2-1 win for the United States. The celebration was loud and emotional.

Several candidates answered “yes” when asked if he should resign.Curling is also under the spotlight. Reports earlier this month raised concerns about possible rule violations in ski jumping and other events. While officials called some claims rumors, the World Anti-Doping Agency said it would review any credible information.

Facing spin



Team news



New Zealand middle-order batter Mark Chapman looked perplexed when he was asked about the Super Eight groups, where all four table-toppers, who have done well in their respective groups, will end up facing each other. It has been done because of the pre-tournament seedings.The 31-year-old smiled and replied, “When it comes to scheduling and planning, that’s not really in my domain.”Chapman’s response sums up the way New Zealand play their cricket. No fuss, no theatrics, just straight down to business.After playing three matches in Chennai and one in Ahmedabad, all on red-soil pitches, the Kiwis had only one training session to adapt to the conditions ahead of their first Super Eight match against Pakistan at the R Premadasa Stadium.None of them rushed towards the pitch for a closer look. Once warm-ups were done, the players moved to the indoor nets. About an hour later, Daryl Mitchell came out barefoot to inspect the surface, spending a good fifteen minutes studying every inch of the 22 yards.Chapman, who did not get to see the surface, left it to the senior leadership group.“In the subcontinent, the toss always plays a factor depending on the conditions.I haven’t seen the pitch yet, so I don’t actually know what it looks like. There will be discussions behind the scenes with the senior leadership group about what we want to do,” he said.The black-soil pitches in Colombo do assist spinners, and with bigger boundaries and a slower outfield, it presents a new challenge for the 2021 T20 World Cup finalists.“We haven’t played in Sri Lanka yet. A lot of guys in our team have played a lot of cricket here, so I don’t see that playing too much of a factor. Guys understand what they need to do, and we are confident we will face whatever conditions are in front of us,” said Chapman, whose knees were heavily strapped.“In India, particularly on red-soil pitches, conditions have been favourable for batting. It has been tough for the bowlers, and the margins have been very small. We have seen scores close to 200 regularly.“Here, it is slightly different with the slower nature of the pitches. The bowlers will hopefully get a chance to show their skills, and spinners are more likely to play a part here,” he added.Although Pakistan are stationed in Sri Lanka, they played their group matches at two different venues in Colombo.New Zealand will be the only team playing all their Super Eight matches at the same venue, facing Pakistan on February 21, Sri Lanka on February 25, and England on February 27, all at the R Premadasa Stadium.“One of the challenges in tournaments like these is hopping from venue to venue and adapting. When we play three games at the same place, we learn with each game.“It is nice to turn up at the same venue with similar pitches and adjust. Tomorrow is our first game here, so we will have to adapt anyway, but we will understand the conditions better as we go,” he said.New Zealand’s first challenge will be Pakistan’s spin-heavy attack. Usman Tariq, Abrar Ahmad, Mohammad Nawaz, Saim Ayub, and Shadab Khan form a strong unit.“Pakistan have a number of very good spinners, each with their own threat. We have played them quite frequently over the last few years.“We are well aware of what they will bring. For us, it is about being really clear in how we want to play against them,” he said.Obviously, there was a Usman Tariq question: “Usman Tariq has a unique action with the way he pauses at the crease, so that is something to factor in.""Chapman, whose role is to take on spinners in the middle overs, explained why running between the wickets will be crucial.“Given the slower pitch and bigger boundaries, you have to change your game plan. Against spinners, it is about different options like the sweep or reverse sweep. In India, you can target straight boundaries more.“For me, it is about finding different areas of the ground. There are big pockets here, so it is not all about sixes. Twos, fours, and running between the wickets are very important, especially if it is not a high-scoring game,” he said.New Zealand have suffered injury setbacks. Michael Bracewell has been ruled out of the remainder of the tournament after re-injuring his left calf. Captain Mitchell Santner missed the last group match against Canada due to illness, while Lockie Ferguson returned home for the birth of his first child.“Mitchell Santner looks pretty sprightly and excited to get back on the park, barring any last-minute illness.“Lockie has just returned and is coming off a long flight. We will see how he pulls up. I cannot confirm whether he will be in the playing eleven,” Chapman said.","New zealand will be the only team playing all their super eight matches at the same venue, facing pakistan on february 21, sri lanka on february 25, and england on february 27.

Why India are in deep trouble | T20 World Cup 2026 | India vs South Africa

MUMBAI: “The team is in a good space,” a confident West Indies coach Daren Sammy said on the eve of their Super Eights Group 1 match against Zimbabwe at the Wankhede Stadium on Monday.Sammy was in a happy mood on Sunday afternoon as his players trained in the nets for close to two-and-a-half hours. West Indies topped their group by winning all four matches, with different players contributing at key moments.The Men-in-Maroon may have found the going tough in Tests and ODIs, but their calling is T20 cricket as their players are some of the hottest properties across major franchise leagues all over the world. They have won the T20 World Cup in 2012 and 2016. But their form has dipped in the last two editions as they have managed to win only two matches in 2022 and 2024. Their build-up to the World Cup also included series defeats to New Zealand, Nepal,Afghanistan and South Africa.Back in India, where West Indies won their last title in 2016 with Sammy as captain, the team is in a happy space as their players are familiar with the conditions due to most of them playing in the IPL.The Windies have also shown the needed mental toughness to secure wins in a format where there is little to separate teams. The two-time champs have been content with the underdogs tag and have progressed smoothly through a tricky group in which every team has won at least one match.Their secret sauce has been different players putting in match-winning performances during the group stage. Shimron Hetmyer (64, 36b) and Romario Shepherd (5/20) helped them beat Scotland. Shepherd, who missed the last two games due to injury, was available for the Zimbabwe match. Sherfane Rutherford (76*, 42b) and a collective bowling effort led by Gudakesh Motie (3/33) helped them defeat England. Jason Holder (4/27) and Shai Hope (61*, 44b) starred in a win over Nepal, before Hope (74, 46b) and Shamar Joseph (4/30) helped them beat Italy.Zimbabwe also enter the Super Eights in strong form after topping their group, including wins over Australia and Sri Lanka in Sri Lanka. They missed qualification for the last edition but have arrived in India with confidence. Zimbabwe, along with the showing of the emerging nations, have been the flavour of the tournament with the neutrals warming up to their exploits. Led by inspirational captain Sikandar Raza , they have found matchwinners like the young Brian Bennett, who is yet to be dismissed in the tournament and played crucial innings in the wins over Australia and Sri Lanka. Zimbabwe’s bowling has been a key strength too, with Blessing Muzarabani leading with nine wickets so far, supported by Graeme Cremer and Brad Evans.West Indies and Zimbabwe last played against each other in the 2022 edition in Australia, with West Indies winning by 31 runs. Zimbabwe’s challenge though will be adapting quickly to conditions at the Wankhede, which has offered assistance to the bowlers.","West indies face zimbabwe at the wankhede stadium on monday.

Scores:

Sri Lanka's wait for a breakthrough against England now stretched to their 12th consecutive T20I defeat as their batting unravelled in frustrating circumstances, falling well short in their Super Eight clash of the T20 World Cup at the Pallekele Cricket Stadium on Sunday.After their bowlers laid the perfect foundation by restricting England to 146/9 on a dry, slow surface, Sri Lanka squandered the advantage with a reckless start, collapsing to 34/5 inside the Powerplay. From there, the chase meandered into oblivion, as they eventually folded up for 95, 51 runs short of the target.The pitch demanded patience and clarity, and Sri Lanka's bowlers delivered on both these counts. Left-arm spinner Dunit Wellalage led the squeeze with 3/26, removing Jos Buttler and England captain Harry Brook in the pivotal middle overs that stalled England's momentum.Maheesh Theekshana, with his offspinners and flickers, was equally incisive, conceding 21 runs and claiming two scalps, as seamers Dilshan Madushanaka and Dushmantha Chameera cleverly varied their pace to dent England any sustained acceleration.Opener Phil Salt's 62 off 40 (6x4, 2x6) was a study in controlled aggression on a surface where clean hitting was arduous. He shephered England to what proved to be a match-winning score.In response, Sri Lanka's innings dismantled almost immediately. Jofra Archer struck twice with the new ball, removing inform opener Pathum Nissanka (9) and Kamil Mishara (6).The decisive burst, however, came from Will Jacks. Introduced in the Powerplay, his offspin perfectly suited this surface. Kusal Mendis chipped one back, Pavan Rathnayake fell in the very next delivery and Wellalage soon followed, as Sri Lanka crashed from 20/1 to 22/4 in a dramatic collapse.From that point, the required rate spiralled. England's attack remained disciplined, changing the pace and forcing false shots from the Sri Lankan batters. Only their captain Dasun Shanaka 30 off 24 (1x4, 2x6) offered brief resistance.Having entered the contest burdened by 11 straight T20I defeats to England, Sri Lanka had crafted the platform to rewrite the narrative. Instead, early wickets and mounting scoreboard pressure proved decisive. It wasn’t a difficult pitch, but it demanded composure, the discipline to settle in and resist the urge to come out all guns blazing. Sri Lanka did exactly the opposite with a clutch of soft dismissals.England’s composure and adaptability on a demanding surface ultimately sealed the result, with Jacks capping an all-round display — following impactful knocks of 39* and 53* against Nepal and Italy — with figures of 3/22 to close out an error-strewn display by Sri Lanka.""This was probably not the perfect game for us, but every game is better than the last. It's not a sprint,"" Archer said after the win.England 146/ 9 (P Salt 62, D Wellalage 3/26) bt Sri Lanka 95 (W Jacks 3/22) by 51 runs.","Sri lanka's wait for a breakthrough against england now stretched to their 12th consecutive t20i defeat.

Mohammad Yousaf post

India’s Super 8 campaign began on the worst possible note as South Africa handed them a crushing 76-run defeat at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad. Entering the stage as one of the strongest favourites to defend their T20 World Cup crown, the hosts were thoroughly outclassed in every department. The heavy loss not only dented their confidence but also severely damaged their net run rate.Nothing seemed to fall into place for the defending champions. South Africa dominated with bat and ball, putting India under immediate pressure in Group 1. The equation is now simple but daunting. India must win their remaining fixtures against Zimbabwe and the West Indies to keep their semi-final hopes alive. Even consecutive victories may not guarantee qualification, given the substantial blow to their net run rate following the defeat to Aiden Markram ’s side.The result also brought renewed attention to a bold prediction made earlier by former Pakistan pacer Mohammad Amir . He had claimed that India would struggle to reach the semi-finals, arguing that both South Africa and the West Indies had displayed stronger form during the group stage. At the time, Amir faced heavy criticism from Indian fans on social media.After the Ahmedabad encounter, former Pakistan batter Mohammad Yousuf reacted on X, appearing to acknowledge Amir’s foresight while also teasing him.“Oye @iamamirofficial, you menace! You tormented #India on the field, and now you’re rattling them from the studio. Let them breathe; they’re already under fire. South Africa, the finalists, have picked up right where they left off last #T20WorldCup. A formidable side! Top order stumbled, but the lower order delivered, and the bowling discipline was exceptional,” Yousuf wrote.In the match itself, South Africa won the toss and chose to bat. Despite slipping to 20/3, they recovered brilliantly to post 187/7. David Miller led the charge with 63, while Dewald Brevis made 45 and Tristan Stubbs remained unbeaten on 44. Miller and Brevis stitched together a crucial 97-run partnership for the fourth wicket to shift momentum.India’s reply never gained traction. Marco Jansen claimed four wickets as the hosts were bowled out for 111. Shivam Dube top-scored with 42, preventing an even steeper collapse, but it was far from enough on a night that has left India’s campaign hanging in the balance.",South africa beat india by 76 runs in t20 world cup group 1 match. Defending champions bowled out for 111 in ahmedabad. David miller top-scored for south africa with 63 while dewald brevis made 45. Marco jansen took four wickets for the hosts.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128697426,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-1225846,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"
