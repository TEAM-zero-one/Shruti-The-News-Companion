As NHL free agency approaches, Winnipeg Jets winger Nikolaj Ehlers is quickly becoming one of the most sought-after names on the market. After 10 seasons in Manitoba, the Danish forward has reportedly told the Jets he intends to test free agency on July 1—news that has sparked interest from multiple franchises across the league.NHL trade rumors are swirling as Winnipeg Jets forward Nikolaj Ehlers prepares to hit free agency, drawing serious interest from contenders like the Hurricanes, Kings, and Sharks ahead of July 1.“Hearing Nikolaj Ehlers has informed the Jets he will go to free agency on July 1. Door not closed on Manitoba, but will test the market,” tweeted NHL insider Elliotte Friedman on Thursday.While the Winnipeg Jets are still hoping to retain the skilled winger, it’s clear other teams are preparing aggressive pitches. Among them, the Carolina Hurricanes—valued at $1.25 billion by Forbes—are reportedly “very serious” about signing Ehlers, according to Friedman, who spoke during Oilers Now with Bob Stauffer.“I think there are definitely some things in motion,” Friedman said. “I’ve heard Carolina is very serious about Ehlers, but I also think he could end up just about anywhere. That’s what’s going to make this a really interesting situation — there are a lot of teams poking around, and they all seem to have slightly different priorities.”Beyond Carolina, both the Los Angeles Kings and San Jose Sharks have emerged as potential suitors. The Kings are exploring multiple roster moves, while the Sharks, facing pressure to reach the salary cap floor, could view Ehlers as a strategic addition despite their ongoing rebuild.“Some teams are looking at shorter-term fits,” Friedman noted. “Then you’ve got teams like San Jose who need to hit the cap floor. So, Ehlers could have multiple types of suitors. ... I’ve also heard L.A. has a few irons in the fire.”Despite Nikolaj Ehlers' intention to explore options, Winnipeg GM Kevin Cheveldayoff hasn’t given up hope. He emphasized the team’s long-standing relationship with Ehlers, who was drafted by the Jets and has been a consistent top-six forward.“Nikolaj has been a player that has grown up in our organization,” Cheveldayoff said. “Drafted, developed him, we'll put our best foot forward with him to try to make our case to be a unique Jet-for-life-type player.”Also Read: NHL CBA overhaul: Auston Matthews sparks dress code rebellion as league expands to 84-game season With 63 points in 69 games last season, Nikolaj Ehlers’ mix of speed, offensive production, and two-way play makes him one of the most versatile forwards available this summer—guaranteeing a competitive bidding war once the free agent window opens.","Winnipeg jets winger nikolaj ehlers is set to test free agency on july 1.

Acceptance of a name that would define a legacy

Panthers Win Game 5 to Take 3-2 Lead in Stanley Cup Final | NHL on TNT

Wayne Gretzky is a name synonymous with greatness in the NHL , but the origin of his famous nickname, ""The Great One,"" has a surprising twist. During a recent segment on NHL on TNT’s Face Off, Wayne Gretzky shared that his father, Walter Gretzky, was not a fan of the moniker when it first appeared during his youth hockey days.Long before the Great One, Wayne Gretzky shattered NHL records, he was just a ten-year-old prodigy from Brantford, Ontario, netting an unbelievable 400 goals in a single season. A reporter from the London Free Press came to profile the young phenom.At the conclusion of the article, the journalist proposed a fitting nickname: “The Great One,” drawing inspiration from legends like “Mr. Hockey” and “The Golden Jet.”“They said, ‘We should just call him The Great One,’” Gretzky recalled. “Well, my dad tried to kill that right away — it just kept coming back.”Gretzky believed such a title placed unnecessary pressure on his young son. He didn’t want Wayne to bear the weight of premature hype. But despite his father's objections, the nickname gained traction and became permanently linked to the budding superstar.Over time, the family had no choice but to embrace the label.“Finally, I just was like, ‘Well, we’re going to have to live with it,’” Wayne Gretzky admitted. And live with it he did.By the time he retired in 1999, Wayne Gretzky had not only fulfilled but exceeded the expectations that came with such a grand title. With 894 goals, 2,857 career points, and 61 NHL records, “The Great One” wasn’t just a nickname—it became his rightful legacy.Switching gears to current NHL action, Gretzky also shared his thoughts on the Edmonton Oilers' Game 5 loss to the Florida Panthers. “Right from the get-go, Florida played a really smart, intelligent road game,” he said, noting that Edmonton looked “cautious” and “on their heels” early on.Also Read: No longer Canadian: Wayne Gretzky’s Canadian identity questioned after Donald Trump friendship sparks controversy Gretzky’s nickname, “The Great One,” once resisted by his father, ultimately came to represent not just early talent, but a lifetime of excellence, From a childhood nickname to a storied NHL career, Gretzky’s story remains one of humility, brilliance, and enduring greatness.","Wayne gretzky's iconic nickname, ""the great one,"" originated from a profile of his youth hockey dominance.

Rasmus Andersson trade buzz: Toronto Maple Leafs eyeing a $27 million veteran to fix defensive woes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/rasmus-andersson-trade-buzz-toronto-maple-leafs-eyeing-a-27-million-veteran-to-fix-defensive-woes/articleshow/122118034.cms,"Rasmus Andersson trade buzz: Toronto Maple Leafs eyeing a $27 million veteran to fix defensive woes (Image Via Twitter )

Rasmus Andersson could offer the Toronto Maple Leafs the right-handed defensive stability they urgently need

The Toronto Maple Leafs are at a crossroads again. Another painful playoff exit, a likely Mitch Marner departure, and a restless fanbase are heavy burdens on the accused to recalibrate. But the offseason has come with opportunities and perhaps redemption. The Leafs are now refocusing on the defensive front, and Rasmus Andersson of Calgary looks like the prime candidate for trade who would bring a new face to Toronto's blue line and a couple of seconds of stability to a team in transition.The Maple Leafs' playoff shortcomings, once again, have been their inability to stop teams that have applied high offensive pressure, like the Florida Panthers. They made the series last seven games, and yet the Game 3 collapse was a testament to how exposed they are in the right-side defense position. With Tanev and Carlo providing the gritty presence the Leafs would love to have, recent internal evaluations in Toronto further cemented the grasp that there needed to be a defenseman who has leadership qualities and a very good hockey sense, traits that Andersson has always displayed in his career.Team sources suggest that if this deal is going anywhere, it might turn into a multi-asset affair prior to the draft. The spotlight now shifts to Flames veteran Rasmus Andersson: skilled, tough, and the right-shot defenseman with nine seasons under his belt.According to Kypreos, starting from the trade deadline, there has been interest shown by Toronto in Andersson, and that interest may soon be rekindled. With three years having passed without making it to the Playoffs for Calgary since the exit of Matthew Tkachuk, the Flames are at their crossroads. With young goalie Dustin Wolf heralded as a new face of the franchise, Calgary may want to shed some valuable veterans, and Andersson, with just one year left on a deal worth $4.55 million, fits the bill perfectly.An Andersson contract could be beneficial for both teams. For Toronto, this would be a low-risk and high-reward option, therefore not interfering with any long-term cap considerations. Having a whopping $25 million plus in cap space with major decisions on John Tavares and Matthew Knies looming, the best course of action might be to acquire Andersson for prospects and picks. He brings scoring from the back end at an elite level, but he also has the grit and hockey sense the Maple Leafs would be desperate for when it comes to facing playoff competition.Also Read: Calgary Flames blueliner Rasmus Andersson appointed Captain of Team Sweden at 2025 World Championship If the Maple Leafs are serious about ending their Stanley Cup drought, acquiring Rasmus Andersson might be a savvy move.

Gambhir & Agarkar Plot at the Birmingham Nets | Key Talks Ahead of 2nd Test vs England

NEW DELHI: Former India Test captain and current ODI skipper Rohit Sharma , who recently retired from red-ball cricket at the age of 38, was seen vacationing in Milan even as Team India battles England in the ongoing Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy five-Test series. His successor, Shubman Gill , came under fire following India’s five-wicket defeat in the series opener at Headingley — his first match as Test captain.Rohit, now focused solely on One-Day Internationals, shared glimpses of his holiday in Italy on social media, including a photo of the iconic Duomo di Milano cathedral. His next cricketing assignment is scheduled for August, when India tours Bangladesh for a three-match ODI series starting on August 17.Meanwhile, India endured a frustrating loss at Headingley, where England chased down a steep target of 371 runs in the fourth innings — their second-highest successful chase in Tests and the highest ever against India.Former England captain Nasser Hussain, speaking on Sky Sports, was critical of Gill's captaincy debut.""I saw someone finding his way. He didn't quite have that on-field aura of Rohit and Kohli. I thought he followed the ball a lot and was reactive rather than proactive.When Rohit and Kohli captained, you looked down and immediately knew who was in charge. In this game, I saw two or three captains — captaincy by committee,"" Hussain said.England’s victory was anchored by Ben Duckett’s explosive 149, aided by Joe Root’s unbeaten 53 and debutant Jamie Smith’s steady 44 not out.Despite India boasting five individual centuries across both innings — with Shubman Gill, KL Rahul, Yashasvi Jaiswal, and Rishabh Pant all reaching triple figures — the team failed to convert that dominance into a win.While highlighting Gill's leadership struggles, Hussain also noted that the young captain wasn’t solely to blame for the loss.""India lost the match because of two things Gill couldn't control — dropped catches and batting collapses,"" he said, referencing India's sloppy fielding and key middle-order failures.India had England at vulnerable positions — 276/5 in the first innings and 333/4 in the second — but failed to capitalise. Crucial batting collapses saw India lose 7 wickets for 41 runs in their first innings and 6 for 31 in the second, ultimately swinging the match in England’s favour.","Former india test captain rohit sharma is vacationing in milan.

This trade marks Ball’s fourth NBA franchise and signals a strategic shift for both teams as they prepare for the upcoming season.- The Cavaliers receive Lonzo Ball , a 27-year-old guard and former No. 2 overall pick, who has struggled with injuries in recent years, missing two full seasons (2022–2024) due to persistent knee problems.- The Bulls acquire Isaac Okoro, a 24-year-old wing known for his defensive upside, who had seen his role diminish in Cleveland after the team’s midseason acquisition of De’Andre Hunter.- Ball returned to the court last season, playing 35 games and averaging 7.6 points, 3.4 rebounds, and 3.3 assists on 36.6% shooting from the field.- His contract includes $10 million for the upcoming year, with a club option for 2026–27, giving the Cavaliers valuable salary cap flexibility.- Ball is expected to serve as a quality backup point guard behind Darius Garland, addressing a key weakness exposed during the Cavs’ recent postseason run. His playmaking and perimeter defense could also allow him to share the floor with Donovan Mitchell when needed.- Okoro, a former top-5 pick, averaged 6.1 points per game last season and is set to earn $11 million this year.- The Bulls see Okoro as a young, defensive-minded wing who could still develop into a reliable 3-and-D player.- For the Cavaliers , this trade is a calculated risk: Ball’s injury history is a concern, but his upside as a facilitator and defender fits Cleveland’s needs, especially with Garland’s health uncertain and Ty Jerome’s future in doubt.- For the Bulls, moving Ball’s contract and acquiring a younger, healthy wing aligns with their ongoing roster refresh after losing other veterans like DeMar DeRozan and Zach LaVine.Also read: https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/nba-trade-news-devin-booker-close-to-historic-150-million-extension-with-the-phoenix-suns/articleshow/122122145.cms The Cavaliers hope that Ball’s addition will solidify their backcourt depth and boost their chances in an Eastern Conference that remains wide open due to injuries to other contenders.

After his record NHL season and $64 million deal, Sam Bennett and Zoe Zeleny restate their commitment to ‘Benny’s Buddies’

Big money and star power. Sam Bennett has come to a real inflection point by signing an eight-year, $64 million contract with the Florida Panthers that runs through the 2032-33 season, almost doubling his existing cap hit and marking his evolution to the franchise player. The Panthers are rejoicing since they are able to hold onto a playoff hero, but Bennett looks beyond 'hockey'. Together with fiancée Zoe Zeleny, he is already planning how to leverage this success for their off-ice cause, meaning his reach now extends way beyond the ice.This contract extension could not have been better timed. Fresh off his second straight Stanley Cup win and Conn Smythe Trophy, Bennett set pen to paper on an eight-year, $64 million contract extension. The Florida Panthers winger will now be taking home $8 million a year for his services until the 2032-33 season, vastly overshadowing his old cap hit of $4.425 million.Bennett's 2024-25 stat line was peak Bennett: 51 points; 25 goals, 26 assists, and seven power-play goals occur rarely. The playoffs, however, sealed his reputation. Performing in clutch moments, he set an NHL record by scoring 13 goals on the road and racking up 15 goals in total, earning him MVP honors.But off the ice, it was something very personal that defined what this contract was all about. On a recent Zoom call, he was wearing a ""Benny's Buddies"" cap, referring to the charitable foundation which he and his fiancée, Zoe Zeleny, started. The two started that program to help children and families in the local community, and this new deal will allow them to do so on a much bigger scale.According to Panthers TV reporter Katie Engleson, Bennett said, “That was one of the first things me and my fiance talked about. We get to continue Benny’s Buddies.” The quote not only speaks to the excitement surrounding the contract but also to the couple's commitment to turning professional success into action.Also Read: Rasmus Andersson trade buzz: Toronto Maple Leafs eyeing a $27 million veteran to fix defensive woes The $64 million contract for Bennett guarantees much more apart from just his tenure with the Panthers-the investment continues to hold a bit of the commitment Brennan and Zoe have retained for the community.

Jalen Williams on the insane female attention the NBA players get

Jalen Williams keeps focus on basketball

The Oklahoma City Thunder have won their maiden NBA championship, a victory that brings with it not only name, fame, and money — but also an increase in female attention. With million-dollar contracts and stardom reaching new heights, NBA players often find themselves vulnerable to situations that can go far beyond admiration. Some women go to extreme lengths, with a few even using the opportunity to deceive or exploit them. Jalen Williams, now a member of an NBA title-winning team, once opened up about this aspect of fame, speaking candidly about how players can be susceptible to the wrong kind of attention — and the consequences that may follow.In a 2023 appearance on the Don’t Trip We Got You podcast, Jalen Williams — popularly known as J-Dub — was asked if he had personally experienced any of those “crazy” situations involving women seeking the attention of NBA stars.“Me personally, no. I try and stay out the mix as far as… like girls… during the season,"" Williams responded.He said, ""I've seen some stuff just in general. Like I know girls be hanging out in the hallways and hotel rooms all the time and kind of do that just to see who they can get to come upstairs. They know your schedule and stuff, and you always get the random DMs like ‘fly me out.’”When the host pointed out that such attempts sometimes work, Williams explained why many young players fall into the trap.“You guys definitely see it, but like, that's the trap that I think a lot of—especially younger—guys fall into. You got girls at 2 a.m., 3 a.m., you’re already tired, you’re vulnerable. Just played a back-to-back. You might have had a good game. Then they’ll be at your hotel room like, ‘Take me upstairs, let’s go out to eat,’ blah blah blah,” he said.Williams called it “insane,” suggesting that such encounters have, at times, ended in theft or blackmail involving compromising photos. “There’s been all kinds of stuff. People get their wallets stolen, or they’ll take a picture of you while you’re asleep. So you always gotta be careful in that regard,” he added.Despite his rising popularity, Jalen Williams has kept his personal life extremely private. There have been no public confirmations of a relationship, and if he is dating someone, he's kept it well under wraps.As a result, the spotlight has remained firmly on his performance. In Game 7 of the NBA Finals, Williams scored 20 points along with four assists and four rebounds, becoming the second-highest contributor for the Oklahoma City Thunder behind Finals MVP Shai Gilgeous-Alexander. After the win, Alexander called Williams a “once-in-a-lifetime player” — and it seems he just might be right.","Jalen williams, a member of the oklahoma city thunder, opened up about female attention on a podcast.

After days of unrelenting speculation, Vanessa Bryant took to Instagram Stories on Sunday, June 1, to put the rumors to rest. Her response wasn’t a press statement or a legal warning, it was a wild meme with a big middle finger to the internet trolls. The meme featured music icon Rihanna floating in water with a snorkel mask on her head, holding a drink, and flipping her middle finger.“Me protecting my peace, not pregnant & having fun all summer,” Vanessa Bryant wrote in the caption on her response to the online trolls who spread her pregnancy rumors about five years after her husband, Kobe Bryant ’s, untimely and devastating demise.It was clear, clever, and vintage Vanessa who shut down noise without saying a word about the origin of the gossip. No press release needed when you’ve got Rihanna energy with a direct middle finger gesture.The rumors had emerged out of nowhere, with some users pointing to photos allegedly showing a ""baby bump,"" though no timestamps or context were attached to those images. Vanessa hasn't been publicly linked to anyone romantically, and there’s been zero confirmation from her side—until now.In another Instagram Story later that evening, Vanessa Bryant shared a motivational quote that hinted at how she views the entire situation and what matters to her personally.“The only way to impress me, is by being a good person,” the quote read. “I don’t care what you have, what you wear, where you live, or what you drive. I just have deep respect for people with pure hearts and good intentions.”Adding one final touch to her trilogy of clapbacks, she posted another Rihanna meme, this one stating, “I’m not mean, I’m just not the one.”With the classic Rihanna memes, Vanessa showed that she is busy being a proud mom to her daughters while being the powerhouse of her business ventures. While she does not care about the rumor mill, her reaction explicitly showed that she is urging privacy.Vanessa Bryant, who shares four daughters with Kobe— Natalia, Bianka, Capri, and the late Gianna— has remained devoted to family and philanthropy. Most recently, she shared footage of a joyful family ski trip over the holidays, showing the tight-knit bond she maintains with her children.Vanessa and Kobe Bryant tied the knot in April 2001. Tragically, in January 2020, Kobe and their 13-year-old daughter Gianna lost their lives in a helicopter crash that also killed seven others. They were headed to Kobe’s Mamba Sports Academy for a youth basketball game when the accident occurred. Kobe was 41 at the time. The loss shook the sports world and left a lasting impact on fans, friends, and loved ones across the globe. Kobe has left a huge legacy to his name as well, he is considered one the of the elite NBA superstars of all time with astounding stats, records and intense playmaking abilities. His demise created a huge void in the NBA world as fans are still mourning his untimely passing.Since their passing, she’s kept their memory alive through meaningful business ventures and charitable work. Kobe launched the Mamba Sports Foundation in 2016, aiming to support young athletes. After his death, Vanessa renamed it the Mamba & Mambacita Sports Foundation in honor of both Kobe and Gianna. Today, the foundation helps underserved boys and girls in sports, pushing forward the mission they believed in. It's her way of carrying on their legacy with purpose and heart.Vanessa Bryant’s response was indeed witty and empowering as she hinted that she deserves privacy and reminded the world that while she may be a public figure, her peace and dignity aren’t up for debate, especially not over unfounded gossip. After the viral response via memes, Vanessa has seemingly closed the chapter as she did not extend the matter any further with any other comments about it afterwards.Days after shutting down the pregnancy rumor, Vanessa Bryant made a glowing courtside appearance with her daughters at the New York Liberty vs. Chicago Sky game. The WNBA shared a sweet clip showing Vanessa alongside Natalia, 22, Bianka, 8, and Capri, 5, all smiling and waving for the camera.Later, Vanessa uploaded an image of her in a restaurant, candidly posing as she waited for the food to be arrive. Considering the dress, it appears that the photograph was shot after her recent attendance in the game.Their family moment quickly caught fans’ attention online, adding a warm highlight to the evening. It was a rare and heartwarming public outing for the Bryant family, showing their strong support for women’s basketball. It was Vanessa's first public outing since she debunked the horrendous pregnancy rumors.Recently, Vanessa honored her husband Kobe's memory with a heartfelt Instagram post on Instagram, sharing a throwback photograph of the family with the NBA legend, ""Happy Fathers Day @kobebryant 💕 You are so missed.

Poll What is your prediction for the next match of the series? India wins England wins

NEW DELHI: India’s Under-19 team began their five-match Youth ODI series against England in emphatic fashion, cruising to a six-wicket win at Hove. Chasing 175, the visitors wrapped up the game in just 24 overs, thanks to a blistering debut knock from 14-year-old sensation Vaibhav Suryavanshi Suryavanshi, who became the youngest centurion in men’s T20s during this year’s IPL for Rajasthan Royals, lit up the County Ground with a 19-ball 48, hammering five sixes and three fours. His explosive innings set the tone for India’s dominance and earned him the spotlight on his first outing in English conditions.The teenager shared a 71-run stand in just 7.3 overs with skipper Ayush Mhatre before holing out to Ralphie Albert after an electric cameo. After the match, Suryavanshi posted a photo with the team’s sports massage therapist, Mangesh Gaikwad, accompanied by the inspiring track Aashayein from the movie Iqbal.Despite a mini-collapse after Suryavanshi’s departure, wicketkeeper-batter Abhigyan Kundu anchored the chase with an unbeaten 45, ensuring India crossed the finish line with a massive 26 overs to spare.Earlier, England chose to bat but were skittled out for 174 in 42.2 overs.Debutant Isaac Mohammed shone briefly with a rapid 28-ball 42, which included four sixes and three fours, while Rocky Flintoff top-scored with a gritty 56. However, consistent breakthroughs derailed England’s innings, with little support for the pair.India’s spinners, Mohamed Enaan and Kanishk Chouhan, combined for five wickets and applied the brakes throughout the middle overs. The bowlers were backed up by sharp fielding, including a run-out and some well-judged catches.The dominant win follows India’s 231-run demolition of a Young Lions Invitational XI at Loughborough earlier in the week, extending their commanding run on the tour.",India beat england under-19s by six wickets at hove. Teenager vaibhav suryavanshi top scored with 48. Abhigyan kundu added 45 for the second wicket. England were skittled out for 174 in 42.2 overs.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122123104,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-122920,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
