Jaden Ivey’s return brings cautious optimism for the Detroit Pistons after long injury layoff,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/jaden-iveys-return-brings-cautious-optimism-for-the-detroit-pistons-after-long-injury-layoff/articleshow/126296299.cms,"Jaden Ivey is a phenomenal player (Image via NBA)

Jaden Ivey flashes pre-injury form while easing back into Detroit’s rotation

Pistons prioritize patience as Jaden Ivey’s explosive spark returns off the bench





Jaden Ivey's journey back to full health has been gradual and challenging. For the Detroit Pistons, the return of shooting guard Jaden Ivey has presented an interesting scenario. After sustaining a fibula injury in January, the former first-round draft pick made his season debut in November. During a loose-ball scuffle, former Orlando Magic guard Cole Anthony lunged into Ivey's leg, ending his 2024–25 season at 30 games.The 23-year-old broke his left fibula at the end of the 2024–25 NBA season, which ended his season and caused knee pain over a year later. After undergoing arthroscopic surgery on his right knee in October of last year, he was able to return to the court in late November.Ivey was arguably playing the best basketball of his career before the accident. In his third season, he averaged a career-high 17.6 points per game and a remarkable 40.9% 3-point shooting percentage. His style seemed to match in well with All-Star Cade Cunningham, and his development was helping Detroit win basketball.Prior to the Pistons' victory over the Sacramento Kings, Bickerstaff directly addressed the strategy for Ivey.""A plan in place for him to ramp up where he's comfortable, where he's confident, so that he can get back to playing the bulk minutes,"" he stated. Bickerstaff did not specify the plan's parameters or provide a deadline.Ivey is now coming off the bench for the Pistons after being activated for 17 games. He was only allowed to play for 15 minutes until he recovered enough to play on the court. Although his conditioning and game have improved, the return is still a work in progress.Thankfully, it appears that he is back on the court at last, albeit not entirely in the same manner that made him such a valuable contributor. In 17 games, he has averaged 8.4 points, 2.1 rebounds, and 1.8 assists per night while shooting 45.5% from the field and 39.6% from beyond the arc.Although his output isn't as high as it was during his three stints as a starter, he is still contributing to the Pistons' victories. The Pistons have only dropped six games since his return.It doesn't make much sense, at least not in the near future, even though Ivey would like to start again this season. The coaching staff does not want him to become exhausted and worsen his injury.Since returning to the squad this season, Ivey has averaged eight points per game. It's obvious that he's still trying to go back to his best and give the Pistons his all. It appears that head coach J.B. Bickerstaff is attempting to raise Ivey's workload following a cautious, slow start.Many other clubs in the league wish they could have the spark he brings off the bench. Before he returned to the court, Detroit was lacking in both speed and high-efficiency shooting. Head coach J.B. Bickerstaff said:“He looks good. You almost forget how fast and explosive he is.. His ability to explode from a stop to a start and get to full speed on his first step is remarkable.”Ivey's influence will be inconsistent due to his limited playing time, especially on nights when he plays for less than 20 minutes.Also read: Is Malik Beasley joining New York Knicks?

49ers vs Seahawks playoff picture intensifies rivalry spotlight







49ers vs Seahawks playoff picture sits at the center of the NFL’s most volatile weekend, and it defines the tension pouring into the season’s final chapter. With the margins thin and emotions loud, this rivalry arrives carrying more than records. It carries memory, noise, and consequence. Saturday night is not about comfort. It is about control, momentum, and who gets to shape January before it even begins.Pressure does not always come from the scoreboard. Sometimes it rises from the stands, the echoes of past battles, and the weight of what is at stake. As the regular season closes, San Francisco and Seattle meet with division pride and playoff positioning hanging in the balance. This is the kind of game that strips teams down to habits and nerve, where stars speak plainly because the stakes leave no room for polish.George Kittle did not soften his words when asked about Seattle’s fan culture. He embraced it. His comments reflected admiration wrapped in rivalry, the kind that fuels players rather than distracts them.“Seattle is one of my favorite stadiums because they hate us and it’s always twice as loud as any other stadium I ever play in,” Kittle said to the press Thursday afternoon.“It’s just a great atmosphere, and I love their hatred for us, and hopefully the Faithful will bring it this weekend for them.”Those words land differently because the setting has changed. The regular season finale shifts to Levi’s Stadium, but the noise will not feel local. Seattle fans travel well, and they know this game could decide the NFC West. The Seahawks arrive with a 13-3 record and a narrow lead that keeps the door closed, for now. San Francisco understands that one slip erases months of work.Their first meeting feels distant. Week 1 delivered a tight San Francisco win in Seattle, a defensive grind that hinted at how thin the margins would remain. Sixteen weeks later, everything is sharper. One game separates the 49ers from a division crown that would add another chapter to their legacy.This contest demands more than execution. It demands ownership of the moment. The 49ers must protect their home field from both a rival roster and a rival crowd. If they fail, the playoff picture shifts instantly, and control slips away just as quickly.Also Read: Micah Parsons’ first reaction to Trevon Diggs joining Packers keeps Cowboys reunion hopes alive for 2026","49ers vs seahawks playoff picture intensifies rivalry spotlight.

Fernandes, older and with a longer global profile, boasts a higher net worth and lucrative endorsements. Ødegaard, though earning less, has performance-based incentives in his deal. Both are among England's highest-paid midfielders.

Bruno Fernandes vs. Martin Ødegaard: Financial differences

Earnings hierarchy

Casemiro (Manchester United): £350,000/week (~$470,000 Bruno Fernandes (Manchester United): £300,000/week (~$400,000) Bernardo Silva (Manchester City): £300,000/week (~$400,000) Kai Havertz (Arsenal): £280,000/week (~$370,000) Martin Ødegaard / Declan Rice (Arsenal): £240,000/week (~$320,000)





Bruno Fernandes and Martin Ødegaard are two names that are ruling the Premier League midfield. They both serve as captains for their teams - Manchester United for Fernandes and Arsenal for Ødegaard. And both have a strong fanbase when it comes to their talent and charisma both on and off the field. To understand where these two sit in the hierarchy of Premier League superstars, let's compare these two defining creative forces of this era.At 31, Bruno Fernandes is in the ""prime veteran"" stage of his career, allowing him to negotiate a higher base salary during his 2024 renewal. Martin Ødegaard, being 27, is on a high-value long-term deal signed in late 2023. While Ødegaard’s earning is lower, his contract has multiple add-ons with heavier incentives related to Arsenal’s recent title charges and Champions League qualification.Bruno Fernandes holds a slight edge in net worth due to his longer career span at the top of the global game and his status as a national icon for Portugal, alongside Cristiano Ronaldo. This has granted him access to lucrative global endorsements, like Nike and Gillette, that Martin Ødegaard is only now beginning to match. With his international profile with the Norway national team growing, the latter is making up for the late entry to the game.Bruno Fernandes is known for a conservative but high-value property portfolio in Lisbon, Manchester, and the Algarve. His investments are geared toward post-career stability in mind. Ødegaard, on the other hand, has focused heavily on tech investments and sports startups in Scandinavia, reflecting a younger generation’s approach to wealth management.In the current 2025/26 landscape, Bruno Fernandes and Martin Ødegaard remain two of the highest-paid midfielders in England. Here is how the top bracket looks:Both midfielders try to bring their best game in every match, and are two of the biggest names in the current English Premier League. Fernandes's net worth at current is around £50 million (~$63.5 million), while Ødegaard has accumulated a fortune worth of £20-25 million (~$25 - $35 million).Also Read: Bruno Fernandes and Ana Pinho Combined Net Worth in 2025: Manchester United career, salary, investments and more","Premier league captains bruno fernandes and martin ødegaard are top midfielders, commanding significant salaries and fan bases.

Joseph Parker's boxing career, salary, and investments

Andy Lee’s investments, career, and net worth of the boxer-coach duo





Joseph Parker and Andy Lee represent a boxing victory that still attracts fans. Wise investments and brand deals are also factors of their financial trajectory apart from boxing careers. The former WBO heavyweight champion, Parker, still brings in millions from fights and endorsements while the retired WBO middleweight champion, Lee, maintains his fortune through coaching, commentary, and making good financial choices.Joseph Parker has made a property investment and lives a nice lifestyle in New Zealand, where he manages family life and boxing training at the same time. Lee’s living comparatively and modestly is still an ongoing process that comes from Parker’s competition with him, and that is the reason he can still mentor others.Parker’s comeback victories over Deontay Wilder and Zhilei Zhang have also increased his fight purses. The reports say that he gets $1.5 million for each fight. Parker's financial status is probably to be significantly enhanced, though, as Wardley and Dubois are going to create difficult fights, earning him more money apart from his fight purses.Apart from this, he gets a cut from the pay-per-view revenues besides his fight purses and has endorsement contracts that steadily reinforce his position as one of the richest heavyweight boxers in this era.His sponsorships and public appearances are also contributing to his financial security. It is very easy to approach him, and he also keeps it simple. Parker is sometimes overtly issues his Samoan background and connections to the community.Lee’s career highlights are winning the WBO title in 2014 against Matt Korobov plus a record of 35 wins, 24 by knockout. After retiring, he began to coach and do television commentary, training boxers like Tyson Fury and participating in the boxing world, which still earns him money. Lee focuses on the coaching and commentary side of the sport, thus making sure that the income after retirement is not so unstable.Parker and Lee together will have a combined net worth of $25-$37 million in 2025, which proves that their relevance in the boxing world as well as in other fields has been continuous and strong.Also Read: Joseph parker net worth in 2025: Boxing career, earnings, endorsements, lifestyle and more","Former wbo heavyweight champion, parker, still brings in millions from fights and endorsements.

5. Fred VanVleet injury troubles







With the NBA’s expansion, every game demands more from players on the hardwood. From fancier dunks to “swish” threes, the league’s requirement from its stars is at an all-time high. The sport of basketball is one of the world’s fastest in the world, and along with its breakneck speed, it is physically taxing on the players. The constant matches with no time to rest and reenergize have increased the risks of injuries.With 2025 ending, a lot of injuries were reported that reshaped the championship landscape in the NBA.From heartbreaking Achilles tears in the Finals to the ongoing maintenance of the league's most dominant big men, health has become the ultimate X-factor for the 2025-26 season.After leading the Indiana Pacers to a historic Game 7 in the NBA Finals, Tyrese Haliburton suffered a torn Achilles tendon in the summer of 2025 that has sidelined him for this entire season. With their star player injured, the Indiana Pacers were forced into a development and survival mode, leaning heavily on Bennedict Mathurin while their title window stays frustratingly closed for a year.Nuggets announced on 30th December 2025, that the MVP contender is out for at least four weeks after suffering a left knee hyperextension in a matchup against Miami.For the Denver Nuggets, Jokić isn't just a player, he is their core system, and his absence puts immense pressure on Jamal Murray and Aaron Gordon on the offensive side. With the Western Conference filled with heavyweights, this 4-week stretch turns the tables for the worse.The dunking star suffered an ankle sprain back in October and then another ankle sprain in December. These repetitive injuries could potentially become a stumbling block for the Grizzlies during the playoffs. Memphis remains a contender only when Morant is on the floor, and this constant uncertainty gives a shaky foundation for their championship dream.The Dallas Mavericks have spent most of 2025 trying to fill in the gap left by their superstar point guard, Kyrie Irving, who sustained a torn left ACL in early March against the Kings. Irving’s injury abruptly ended his 2024-25 campaign and forced the Mavericks into a difficult spot. Despite the arrival of Anthony Davis and the rookie sensation Cooper Flagg, the team has struggled in clutch situations without Irving’s elite shot-making.With Kevin Durant's addition to the team, Rockets are currently Houston to a top-four standing. But without their key two-way player, Fred VanVleet, who suffered an ACL injury in September, the Rockets are missing their vital component. VanVleet’s influence on the team’s culture is commendable, and his loss was a significant hit to the team. The 2019 NBA champion’s absence forces young stars like Amen Thompson into high-pressure roles.Also read: Is Nikola Jokic’s NBA MVP bid slipping away as knee injury lingers for Denver Nuggets star?","With 2025 ending, a lot of injuries were reported that reshaped the championship landscape in the nba.

There is something incredibly about documentaries as they brilliantly capture the raw emotions and do justice to the intensity behind them.

Travis Kelce’s Chiefs career defined by wins, not personal milestones







If Sunday ends up being the final game of Travis Kelce ’s career, it will close a chapter that is hard to match in NFL history. Kelce would walk away with some of the most impressive postseason numbers the league has ever seen, especially when it comes to winning when it matters most.Kelce owns 178 playoff receptions, which is 27 more than Jerry Rice, and his 35 Super Bowl catches rank first all time. Still, records have never been the thing that motivated him. Throughout his career, Kelce has made it clear that team success always came before personal milestones.That mindset showed up clearly two seasons ago. Kelce entered the final regular-season game needing just 16 receiving yards to reach his eighth straight 1,000-yard season. Only six players in NFL history have managed that kind of streak. But with the Kansas City Chiefs already locked into the playoffs, Kelce sat out to rest. The record did not happen, but Kansas City went on to win its third Super Bowl in five years.There is one achievement Kelce will finish this season with no matter what happens Sunday against the Las Vegas Raiders. He is now the winningest player in Chiefs history. His career record stands at 136 wins and 55 losses.Kelce’s journey with the Chiefs began in 2013, when he played just one special teams snap in a win. Over time, he became one of the most important players the franchise has ever had. He now sits ahead of Hall of Fame guard Will Shields, who finished his Chiefs career at 131-93. Long snapper James Winchester follows with 129 wins, while former punter Dustin Colquitt recorded 125.Several things helped shape this era. The NFL moved to a 17-game schedule in 2021, but the bigger reason is the consistent success Kansas City has had since head coach Andy Reid and Kelce arrived in 2013. Kelce’s 11 Pro Bowl seasons line up closely with the team’s most dominant stretch.The playoff numbers tell the same story. In postseason games where Kelce and Winchester played, the Chiefs went 18-7. Only four players in NFL history have appeared in more playoff wins: Tom Brady, Adam Vinatieri, Stephen Gostkowski, and Bill Romanowski.Sunday’s game also brings other storylines. Cornerback Nohl Williams has taken on a bigger role late in the season. Raiders rookie running back Ashton Jeanty is chasing a franchise record. And on special teams, punter Matt Araiza has had a strong year.Also read: Travis Kelce won't be back with the Kansas City Chiefs?

Why Cam Newton believes defensive dominance still defines true value

MYLES GARRETT FOR NFL MVP?! 😯 Cam Newton SPARKS DEBATE by making the case 🗣️ | First Take





The NFL MVP conversation is reaching its loudest point as the final week of the regular season approaches. Most years, the award felt decided before ballots are cast, with certain quarterbacks dominating both the discussion and the voting. This season has followed a similar path, with Matthew Stafford and Drake Maye taking turns as the favorite.Their performances, wins, and highlight moments have fueled the buzz among fans and voters. Still, former league MVP Cam Newton believes the race is being framed too narrowly. In his view, a player’s value is not only about touchdowns or team records but about how one player can bend an entire game plan without ever touching the ball. Newton is putting his bets on Myles Garrett for the prestige title.Appearing on First Take, Newton made it clear that Myles Garrett’s impact goes far beyond the box score. He said, “You don't see people game-planning Drake Maye, respectfully, not even Matthew Stafford as much as they game-plan against Myles Garrett…If we're talking about most valuable player, (Garrett) has shown that he is the most valuable player.”Garrett’s numbers back up Newton’s solid argument. The Browns star has piled up 22 sacks and sits just half a sack away from tying the single-season record shared by Michael Strahan and T.J. Watt. At age 30, and on a massive $160 million contract, Garrett is delivering elite production while anchoring a defense that keeps Cleveland competitive every week.Newton also drew a historical parallel to reinforce his case, saying, “Who does Myles Garrett remind us of? (New York Giants legend) Lawrence Taylor. Taylor won the MVP in 1986 with 20.5 sacks.” Still, the reality of modern MVP voting favors quarterbacks. Stafford briefly held the inside track, but Drake Maye’s five-touchdown performance against the Jets shifted momentum.The Patriots sit at 13-3, have secured the AFC East, and Maye now leads betting odds at minus 400, giving him an estimated 80 percent chance to win the award. Even if Garrett falls short in MVP voting, his season remains historic.Also read: Cam Newton says he gets “no Brady deal” while discussing racial pay gaps in NFL media","The nfl mvp conversation is reaching its loudest point as the final week of the regular season approaches.

A season of lessons shapes the decision

Steve Sarkisian on Arch Manning

NIL value holds firm amid NFL delay

Also Read:





Arch Manning has made a defining call early in his college career, opting to pass on the 2026 NFL Draft and return to the Texas Longhorns for another season in Austin. The decision signals a long-term bet on development over draft-day hype for one of college football’s most scrutinised young quarterbacks.Manning entered the 2025 season surrounded by enormous expectations. Many projected him as a future No. 1 overall pick, while Texas was tipped as a national title contender. Reality proved more complex. Early inconsistencies and pressure behind a leaky offensive line stalled momentum, and his draft stock cooled as the season progressed.Still, the redshirt sophomore closed the year strongly, showing poise, sharper footwork and improved decision-making down the stretch.“I felt like I developed a lot this year, especially towards the back half, and I want to keep it going,” Manning said. “There is no reason to leave. I’ve got a lot more football left to play.”Head coach Steve Sarkisian has publicly backed the move, calling it a mature step that could pay dividends long-term. Sarkisian believes Manning’s development has gone beyond the stat sheet, pointing to improved command at the line of scrimmage and greater comfort handling in-game adversity.From a numbers perspective, Manning’s season was solid if not spectacular. He threw for nearly 3,000 yards, accounted for over 30 total touchdowns, and led Texas to a double-digit win campaign capped by a bowl victory. However, seven interceptions and early-season struggles highlighted why another collegiate year could be valuable before taking on the NFL spotlight.The decision also carries financial and branding implications. Manning remains one of college football’s most valuable NIL athletes, even after his valuation dipped slightly during the season. With endorsement deals spanning national brands and his surname still carrying weight, another year in college does little to hurt his earning power and may enhance it if his on-field play takes a leap.From an NFL perspective, scouts remain intrigued. Several evaluators have noted that Manning still possesses franchise-quarterback traits size, arm strength, and composure even if refinement is needed. Early projections already place him firmly in the conversation for the 2027 NFL Draft, provided his upward trajectory continues.For now, Arch Manning’s message is clear. This is not a retreat from the NFL dream, but a recalibration. By betting on another year in burnt orange, he is betting on growth, patience, and the belief that the best version of his game is still to come.",Arch manning will return to the texas longhorns for another season in austin.

(Image via Getty)

Bruce Arians says stay the course, even after a third straight playoff miss

Carlie Irsay-Gordon has not discussed job security yet, but history is working against Steichen





The Indianapolis Colts are officially out of the playoffs, and the fallout has already begun. After starting the season 8-2, Indianapolis became the first team since 1995 to miss the postseason following such a start. That collapse has put head coach Shane Steichen under real pressure as the franchise enters its first offseason under principal owner Carlie Irsay-Gordon.Steichen has now missed the playoffs in three straight seasons. Injuries explain part of the story, but not all of it. With the Colts eliminated and no job-security talks happening yet, Irsay-Gordon is facing her first defining football decision. Keep the coach and trust the process, or decide that close is no longer good enough.Former Colts offensive coordinator and interim head coach Bruce Arians does not believe Indianapolis should make a coaching change. Appearing on the Dec. 31 episode of “The Pat McAfee Show,” Arians urged patience from ownership.“I hope the Colts don’t make a change, because I think they’re close…be patient, you’re very, very close. Don’t let one or two injuries run you out of the whole damn thing,” Arians said.The argument starts with how the season opened. Indianapolis entered its bye week at 8-2 and looked like a legitimate AFC contender.ESPN’s Football Power Index once gave the Colts a 93.9% chance to make the playoffs and a 79.4% chance to win the AFC South. At that point, the franchise acted like a team chasing a Super Bowl, trading two first-round picks and a second-round receiver to acquire Sauce Gardner from the New York Jets.Then everything unraveled. Quarterback Daniel Jones suffered a ruptured Achilles in Week 14 against the Jacksonville Jaguars. Anthony Richardson Sr. was already on injured reserve with an eye injury. The Colts turned to a retired Philip Rivers, who lost all three of his starts. DeForest Buckner reinjured his neck. Gardner went down with a calf injury. Charvarius Ward suffered another concussion that ended his season.The Colts lost six straight games. Their season ended without a playoff berth for the fifth consecutive year.Steichen acknowledged the pattern after a Week 17 loss to the San Francisco 49ers.“It’s something I’ve got to look at,” he said. “We’ve got to find ways to win, especially in November and December. That’s where you win games and that’s where you make the playoffs.”Steichen confirmed in Week 18 that he has not spoken with Irsay-Gordon about his future.“I have not had those conversations with Carlie,” Steichen said. “But I do meet with Carlie every week. We do a game debrief, go through the process of every game.”That working relationship is close. Irsay-Gordon is regularly present at practices, position meetings, and game debriefs. She meets weekly with Steichen and general manager Chris Ballard and was directly involved in major decisions, including the Gardner trade. She has also made it clear in the past that injuries matter when evaluating a season.“Do you have a crystal ball?” Irsay-Gordon said earlier this year. “Of course, things happen and some of it is we all have to look at all these factors.”Still, the results are hard to ignore. Steichen is now 25-25 across three seasons. Indianapolis has entered must-win games late in each of those seasons and failed every time. The Colts also hold a piece of unwanted history as the first team in 30 years to start 8-2 and miss the playoffs.This offseason is different. It is Irsay-Gordon’s first as principal owner following the death of her father, Jim Irsay, in May. Along with her sisters, she must decide whether to stay patient with a coach who has shown offensive upside but no postseason results, and a general manager who has one playoff win in nine seasons.The Colts are expected to consider re-signing Jones despite his injury. That plan, according to team sources, signals continuity. But continuity only works if the late-season failures stop.","The indianapolis colts are officially out of the playoffs, and the fallout has already begun.

A familiar matchup with high stakes

Also Read:





As the NFL heads into a decisive Week 18, one individual milestone has quietly taken center stage alongside playoff scenarios. Cleveland Browns pass rusher Myles Garrett stands on the brink of history, just one sack away from breaking the NFL’s single-season sack record. Standing in his path is Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow , who addressed the situation with a calm, matter-of-fact response ahead of the divisional matchup.Garrett enters the final week of the regular season with 22 sacks, tying the mark set by Michael Strahan in 2001 and T.J. Watt in 2021. While records often bring added tension, Burrow made it clear that he is not planning to approach the game any differently because of the historic chase.Speaking to reporters this week, Burrow acknowledged Garrett’s dominance but dismissed any notion of overthinking the moment. “I’m not going to go out of my way to stop him from getting the record, and I’m not going to go out of my way to let him get it either,” Burrow said. “I’m just going to play football.”Burrow is no stranger to Garrett’s disruptive presence. In fact, Garrett has sacked Burrow more than any other quarterback during his NFL career, a testament to the Browns defender’s impact within the AFC North.Cincinnati’s offensive line has struggled with consistency in recent seasons, making this matchup particularly challenging as Garrett lines up for what could be a defining moment in his career.Despite that history, Burrow framed the situation as part of the natural flow of the game. He noted that there are moments where taking a sack is simply the lesser of two evils, especially when weighed against the risk of a turnover or forced throw.“It’s such a situational game,” Burrow explained. “Sometimes a sack is the best bad outcome. Other times, you get rid of the ball. You can’t go into it thinking about records.”Garrett’s pursuit of the sack record has been one of the few bright spots in a difficult season for the Cleveland Browns, who enter Week 18 out of playoff contention. Even so, the edge rusher’s consistency and explosiveness have drawn praise from across the league, regardless of team success.For Burrow and the Cincinnati Bengals, the priority remains finishing the season on a strong note. While Garrett’s milestone looms large, Burrow’s comments underline a broader NFL reality: respect for greatness does not override competitive integrity.","Cleveland browns pass rusher myles garrett is just one sack away from breaking the nfl’s single-season sack record.

Caitlin Clark’s most-awaited recovery and return







With the Super Bowl almost a month away, everyone has their favorites, and so does WNBA’s biggest star, Caitlin Clark. On the recent episode of the “New Heights” podcast hosted by the Kelce brothers, Jason and Travis, the 2024 ROTY winner appeared and sparked a cross-sport debate after naming her favorites for Super Bowl 2026.Though Clark hails from Iowa, she admitted her admiration for the New England Patriots, which is largely influenced by her liking for Patriots star QB Drake Maye. This seemed like a classic case where greatness recognizes and appreciates greatness.The last episode of New Heights for 2025 was anything but not dramatic. In a conversation with Jason and Travis over who is Clark’s favorite to win the next Super Bowl, Caitlin revealed, “I may not be cheering for anybody…but honestly, I am a Drake Maye fan. He’s been incredible.Continuing, she said, “I will probably be pulling for the Patriots, but the Rams are really good too. Sam Darnold seems like a good guy…I could root for him.”Drake Maye and Caitlin Clark began their professional career in 2024 and have been proving to be a cornerstone for their teams. Draye Maye registered a completion rate of 66.6% completing 225-of-338 passes in 2024, over 2,276 yards, and 15 touchdowns.Clark also entered the 2025 season after a historic rookie campaign where she averaged 19.2 points and a league-leading 8.4 assists per game. Though her 2025 season ended early, just after 13 games, due to an injury, the snippets from the USA camp show Clark is healthier and ready to enter the 2026 season with a bang.While the Super Bowl occupies the current headline from who’ll play to who’ll perform at halftime, the Indy fever fans are more concerned with Clark’s physical longevity.Reports suggest her 100% recovery and her focus on strength training to return by the WNBA’s 2026 tip-off. Clark’s return is just not crucial for the Fever, whose offensive strength revolves around her, but also for the league as she’s a walking viewership magnet.
