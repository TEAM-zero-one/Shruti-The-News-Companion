Tom Kohler-Cadmore: ‘If I Middle It, It’s probably a six!’ | Power-Hitting Mindset Explained

NEW DELHI: Smriti Mandhana ’s old motivational words have resurfaced online after she and music composer Palash Muchhal announced that their wedding has been called off. The resurfaced clip, from an interview with Humans of Bombay, shows the India vice-captain speaking about how she deals with difficult phases in life, something fans feel resonates strongly with her current situation.In the interview recorded three years ago, Mandhana opened up about her journey in cricket, navigating expectations and criticism, and building resilience. She revealed that her coping mechanism is rooted in simplicity and routine rather than overthinking setbacks.She explained, “It's pretty easy for me. I have short-term goals. Say if I feel low today, I will just start writing what I have to work on for the next six days or for the next seven days, in my batting or in my fitness. So once I start doing that, I just forget what's happening. I just focus on what I have to do.”Mandhana added that shifting her focus to what lies ahead helps her regain motivation.“So when I change my headspace into what I have to do in the next 6-7 days, I don't know, I just feel like there's so much to look forward to,” she said.Reflecting on her evolution from a young aspiring cricketer to one of the most recognised faces in women’s cricket, Mandhana said the sport has shaped her personality and approach to life.“You have to always start your day as a new day because you start your innings on zero, even if you score a hundred,” she shared.She added, “So that's the biggest takeaway from what I have learnt. Whatever happens in your life the next day is a fresh day.”On Sunday, Mandhana finally addressed the speculation around her personal life, confirming that the wedding with Palash Muchhal had been ""called off."" In her statement, she wrote, ""I need to clarify that the wedding is called off. I would like to close this matter here and implore all of you to do the same.""Calling herself a “very private person,” Mandhana urged fans and the media to ""respect the privacy of both families"" and allow them the space to move on.Looking ahead, Mandhana emphasised her commitment to the sport, saying, ""I believe there is a higher purpose driving us all and for me that has always been representing my country at the highest level. I hope to continue to play and win trophies for India for as long as possible.""She ended her note with gratitude and closure: ""Thank you for all your support. It's time to move forward.""","Smriti mandhana's old motivational words have resurfaced online. The india vice-captain spoke about how she deals with difficult phases in life.

Brittany Mahomes abruptly goes silent after Mahomes and Kelce’s meltdown shakes Chiefs’ season,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/brittany-mahomes-abruptly-goes-silent-after-mahomes-and-kelces-meltdown-shakes-chiefs-season/articleshow/125838189.cms,"Kansas City Chiefs faced a tough loss against the Houston Texans. Quarterback Patrick Mahomes and player Travis Kelce struggled on the field. Brittany Mahomes, wife of Patrick Mahomes, remained silent on social media after the game. This quiet response mirrored the disappointment felt by many fans. The team's playoff hopes are now uncertain.

Kelce struggles, Mahomes takes heat, and Brittany distances herself from the chaos

Brittany Mahomes has never been shy about showing love for the Kansas City Chiefs, especially when her husband Patrick Mahomes takes the field at Arrowhead Stadium. From stadium arrivals to postgame celebrations, her Instagram is often filled with glam snapshots, family moments, and behind-the-scenes excitement. But Sunday’s matchup against the Houston Texans brought a different kind of energy and this time Britney chose not to post at all.After the Chiefs’ 20–10 defeat, the atmosphere among fans turned tense, and the blame quickly fell on both Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce for their lackluster performance. Instead of sharing her usual reactions, Brittany went silent, leaving fans to interpret her disappointment without a word.Before kickoff, Brittany Mahomes seemed poised for another enthusiastic game day, sharing Instagram stories of the stadium buzz. Yet as the game unfolded, Kansas City faltered early and never recovered. Kelce dropped late-game opportunities and the offense struggled to find rhythm, a shock to a fan base accustomed to polished comebacks. Once the loss was sealed, Brittany’s social feed suddenly stopped. No postgame thoughts. No family shots. Just silence.This isn’t the first time her online presence has mirrored the team’s emotional highs and lows.When the Chiefs win, Brittany often floods social media with celebration. But when they lose, fans get nothing at all, a silent statement that speaks louder than her usual hype. Making the night even more unusual, she also wasn’t seen alongside Taylor Swift and Selena Gomez, who attended separately in support of Travis Kelce.With this defeat, Kansas City Chiefs suffers more than a bruised ego. Their playoff hopes are now hanging by a thread, and for the first time in nine seasons, they’ve lost the AFC West crown, a title now held by the Denver Broncos. Their next game against the Chargers could determine whether their season lives or dies.As frustration among supporters rises, Brittany’s silence reflects what many Chiefs fans are feeling: uncertainty. The once-unstoppable dynasty suddenly looks fragile, and if Mahomes and Kelce don’t turn things around fast, the quiet moment on Brittany’s Instagram may be the least of Kansas City’s worries.Also Read: Brittany Mahomes sends a clear message to fans as they question Patrick Mahomes’ legacy during tough season","Brittany mahomes has never been shy about showing love for the kansas city chiefs.

Tee Higgins Week 15 status: Concussion protocol updates and team outlook



‘Uncomfortable’ to watch Bengals’ Tee Higgins after head injury | Pro Football Talk | NFL on NBC

Cincinnati Bengals wide receiver Tee Higgins is back in the concussion protocol as the team heads into Week 15. After recently returning from a prior concussion, Higgins’ availability remains uncertain. While he played through Sunday’s high-scoring matchup against the Buffalo Bills, lingering health concerns have prompted the team to proceed cautiously.During the game, Higgins endured multiple hard hits to the head but cleared on-field concussion tests and was able to finish the contest. Post-game, however, he reported symptoms consistent with a concussion, leading to his return to the league’s concussion protocol. Updates on his condition are expected to emerge throughout the week as the team monitors his recovery.Head coach Zac Taylor confirmed that Higgins has re-entered the concussion protocol but did not provide a definitive update on his Week 15 availability. The Bengals will continue evaluating him closely, following strict NFL concussion guidelines that prioritize player health and full recovery. The first detailed update on Higgins’ status is expected Wednesday when Cincinnati releases its initial injury report for the week.Participation in limited practice would indicate progress, but nothing is guaranteed at this stage. The team has emphasized caution after Higgins’ recent concussion history, ensuring no risk is taken with his long-term health. How the Bengals adjust their offensive game plan may also depend on Higgins’ participation later in the week.This marks Higgins’ second concussion in recent weeks, which increases the likelihood that he could miss the upcoming matchup. His uncertain status could significantly impact the Bengals’ passing game, as other receivers may need to take on a larger role if Higgins is unable to play. Analysts and teams will be monitoring developments closely throughout the week to understand how Cincinnati may adjust its offensive strategy in his absence.For now, the Bengals are managing Higgins’ recovery carefully, ensuring he is fully cleared before returning to the field. Weekly updates will provide clarity on whether he can participate in practice or suit up for Sunday’s game, offering a clearer picture of the team’s offensive outlook without one of its key wide receivers.Also Read: Marvin Harrison Jr. injury update: Heel issue leaves Cardinals wide receiver’s week 15 return in doubt","Cincinnati bengals wide receiver tee higgins is back in the concussion protocol.

RaKai reacts to QTCinderella’s embarrassing joke and The Streamer Awards 2025 snub







The Twitch community is once again buzzing after popular streamer RaKai reacted strongly to a joke made about him by Blaire “QTCinderella” during The Streamer Awards 2025. The moment, which was meant to be lighthearted, quickly turned into a major online controversy after RaKai addressed it during a livestream.QTCinderella had teased several creators during a live segment at the awards. Her question to RaKai stood out and sparked mixed reactions online. Now, RaKai’s response and his claim that the awards were “rigged” have taken the drama even further.During The Streamer Awards 2025, QTCinderella asked RaKai a pointed question in front of a live audience. She said,“RaKai, a question - what’s the coolest thing you’ve ever stolen? Don’t answer! It’s a test! It’s a test, RaKai! Have you learned nothing?! Don’t answer. Don’t answer it! Take his mic. Take his mic. Yeah, no, he’s learned his lesson. He’s not allowed to answer that.”RaKai spoke about the moment during his livestream.

Drake London’s Week 15 status looks nothing like a player who is close to returning

What Drake London’s injury means for the Falcons’ offense and fantasy playoffs

Drake London has not played a snap since he crumpled to the turf in overtime of the Atlanta Falcons’ Week 11 loss to the Carolina Panthers with a knee injury. The team keeps calling him “day-to-day,” but the calendar, the injury report, and the standings are all saying something very different.With a short week before “Thursday Night Football” against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, every update on London has pointed in one direction. Another DNP, and a real chance that the franchise wideout is effectively done for 2025.The timeline on London’s knee has been messy from the start. He hurt it in overtime in Week 11 against Carolina after posting seven catches for 119 yards. He left that game and has not played since.Early on, the outlook was optimistic. ESPN’s Adam Schefter reported that the injury was not believed to be serious and that London might not miss time. NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport echoed that early read, noting that the Falcons’ WR had avoided major structural damage. Both reports came before the full picture was clear.Rapoport later reported that London had a sprained PCL and would miss at least Week 12. That diagnosis changed everything.PCL sprains usually come with recovery windows in the four-to-six-week range, and they tend to get worse when players try to rush back.Since that update, the pattern has been the same. London has missed three straight games. He has yet to log a single practice rep. He keeps landing on Atlanta’s injury reports as a non-participant.Jack McKessy of USA TODAY noted that London was listed as a DNP on the Falcons’ first Week 15 report, which was estimated because the team did not hold a full practice on Monday, Dec. 8. That was the fourth time in a row he appeared on the report with that same status since the injury.Head coach Raheem Morris has tried to keep the language positive. Ahead of Week 14, he told reporters that London had been upgraded to day-to-day and that he was feeling better and moving around more. On Monday of Week 15, Morris stuck to the same line, telling reporters, “Drake is still day-to-day.”The problem is that the tape on the week does not match the quote. London still has no real practice work. The team is on a short week. And Atlanta is already out of the playoff race.Tori McElhaney of AtlantaFalcons.com laid it out bluntly. In her Monday injury report breakdown, she wrote that she does not expect London to suit up this week, adding, “If London can get some practice reps, maybe he will be a true game-time decision. However, I think it is more likely the Falcons continue to shut him down this week and hope to get him back to 100% after the mini-bye.”Mike Moraitis also pointed out that the Falcons did not put London on injured reserve, which means they originally expected him to miss fewer than four games. That bet has already lost. He has missed three straight, is tracking toward a fourth, and nothing about his current workload suggests he is close.When you add in the context PFSN’s earlier fantasy breakdown highlighted, a PCL sprain, no practice at all, and a team with “dead playoff hopes”, the reality is simple. The “day-to-day” label is technical. The actual status is “unlikely to play,” and the conversation is quietly shifting from Week 15 to whether it makes any sense to risk him again before 2026.The reason this story will not go away is because London is not just any wideout on this depth chart. He is the passing game.Even after missing three games, London still leads the Falcons in almost every receiving category: targets, receiving yards, touchdowns, 20-plus-yard receptions, and first downs. Before the injury, he went over 100 yards in three straight outings and has 810 receiving yards and six touchdowns in nine games. That is 13.5 yards per catch and exactly 90 yards per game, which puts him on pace for back-to-back 1,000-yard seasons if he were healthy enough to finish.Without him, the receivers room looks thin. Darnell Mooney has slid into the WR1 role by default, but none of the reporting suggests the Falcons suddenly see him as a true replacement for London. Kyle Pitts and David Sills have seen more work as well, yet the offense has clearly lost its top mismatch on the outside.PFSN’s fantasy analysis has already treated this like a long-term problem, not a one-week blip. That breakdown pointed out that London stacked 651 yards and six touchdowns in his last six full games, cementing himself as a WR1 for fantasy managers. Losing that level of consistency in November and December is brutal in any format.The same piece also made the hard call most fantasy managers do not want to hear. With a PCL sprain, zero practice participation since the injury, and Atlanta’s season “an absolute wash,” there is no logical incentive for the team to put London back on the field for what are essentially meaningless December games. The conclusion there was direct: if you need the roster spot for the fantasy playoffs, you can drop him.That stance lines up with the beat reporting coming out of Atlanta. McElhaney does not believe he plays in Week 15. Morris keeps saying day-to-day, but that has yet to translate into actual work on the field. The team itself has every reason to protect its franchise receiver, get him fully right for 2026, and avoid turning a PCL sprain into something worse.Barring a surprise spike in practice participation on Tuesday or Wednesday, London is trending toward another inactive. The Falcons will file two more injury reports before kickoff, but at this point, any practice designation short of “limited” or “full” would only confirm what the last month has already told us.For Atlanta, that means another game without the player who best stretches the field and bails out the quarterback in tight windows. For fantasy managers, it probably means facing the most important weeks of the season without the player they drafted to carry their WR room.Week 15 may give us the final word on London’s status for the rest of the year. Right now, all the evidence says the same thing. The tag might be “day-to-day,” but the situation is much closer to “see you in 2026.”",Drake london remains day-to-day with a pcl sprain as the falcons enter week 15 on a short week.

Rudy Gobert’s costly ejection leaves Timberwolves reeling in narrow loss to Suns,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/rudy-goberts-costly-ejection-leaves-timberwolves-reeling-in-narrow-loss-to-suns/articleshow/125872596.cms,"Stephen Maturen (Image via Getty Images)

Rudy Gobert was ejected for a flagrant 2 foul



With Rudy Gobert off the court, Minnesota fought tooth and nail



A game that was supposed to extend Minnesota Timberwolves’ winning streak to 6, instead it served the Wolves with chaos and frustration involving their defensive anchor, Rudy Gobert. His third-quarter ejection became the defining moment of Minnesota’s 105–108 loss to the Phoenix Suns, who were missing Devin Booker, on Monday at the Target Center. This loss, having the home advantage, raised fresh questions about discipline, decision-making, and depth.The turning point arrived in the third quarter with 8:00 left on the game clock, when Phoenix big man Mark Williams attacked the rim while being defended by Rudy Gobert and Julius Randle. Rudy Gobert, late to the play, met him at the basket with a foul that went far beyond a routine contest. He elbowed Williams mid-air, sending the Suns center crashing to the floor, stopping the game as officials and players rushed towards the scene.Rudy Gobert’s decision to foul in that moment, while Mark Williams was already in the air and driving, just wasn’t a smart call. It was a dangerous situation that could’ve ended badly, and the officials clearly saw it the same way.They reviewed the play and swiftly determined that it satisfied the criteria for a flagrant 2. Gobert was ejected, overwriting what had been one of his strongest starts in recent weeks: 15 points, eight rebounds, and the kind of interior presence Minnesota leans on heavily.Tyler Ford, the match official, while announcing the decision said, ""There is wind-up and significant impact to the ribs of Williams, who is airborne and a vulnerable player with a high potential for injury. That contact is both unnecessary and excessive.""For the Suns, Williams bounced back with poise, shaking off the fall and turning in one of the most impressive performances of his young career, including his first-ever made three-pointer on the way to 22 points.But for all the individual brilliance, the Wolves couldn’t overcome the absence of their defensive anchor. Anthony Edwards , when asked how the Wolves can make up for Rudy Gobert’s absence, said, “You can’t make up for Rudy’s absence, when he’s in the game it’s like they don’t want to go down there and finish. So of course he’s truly missed when he’s not on the court.”Even with Gobert gone, Minnesota fought hard to keep its streak alive. Anthony Edwards delivered an electrifying 40-point outing, cruising through defenders with confidence and keeping the Wolves within reach until the final minutes. Julius Randle added 21 points and eight assists, showcasing a strong all-around performance.The Minnesota Timberwolves (15-9) need to buckle up as they are traveling to San Francisco next to meet the Golden State Warriors (13-12) before heading home for a five-game stand that stretches toward late December.

Why did Khamzat Chimaev criticize Alex Pereira after UFC title win

Khamzat Chimaev has once again spoken openly about a possible fight with Alex Pereira. The undefeated UFC contender believes the fight is not happening because neither Pereira nor the UFC truly want it. Chimaev shared his views during a recent interview with ESPN MMA, where he questioned Pereira’s intentions and the promotion’s decision-making.Alex Pereira, the current UFC light heavyweight champion, reclaimed his title in October at UFC 320 with a first-round knockout win over Magomed Ankalaev. Soon after that win, Khamzat Chimaev called him out for a high-profile fight. While fans showed interest, the matchup has not moved forward.After UFC 320, held in October 2024, Khamzat Chimaev publicly challenged Alex Pereira. Pereira knocked Magomed Ankalaev out in the opening round to reclaim the UFC light heavyweight title.Chimaev went on social media and challenged Pereira to a match after the fight, even advocating a heavyweight fight.Later, Alex Pereira set requirements for the match, which Chimaev claimed he agreed to. Still, no deal followed.Speaking to ESPN MMA in a recent interview released this week, Chimaev claimed the UFC does not want to make the fight happen.“Good fight for me. Everyone knows that,” Khamzat Chimaev said. “UFC knows that, but UFC doesn’t want to give this guy to me.”He also pushed back on Pereira’s comments about fame and popularity. Chimaev said his social media reach proves fans want to see him fight, not talk.Chimaev added that he feels Pereira is avoiding him. “I don’t think he wants that fight,” Chimaev said. “He knows about it, and UFC knows about it.”Chimaev has previously mentioned wanting to fight Alex Pereira. Chimaev expressed his candid perspective on the battle during an interview last year with ex-UFC middleweight champion Michael Bisping.In 2024, Chimaev was interviewed while still competing at the highest level across disciplines. Because of styles, Chimaev stated the battle would be simpler for him than others.However, he did not dismiss Pereira’s power.“I know the guy can knock me out,” Chimaev said. “He is one of the best strikers and hardest punchers.” Chimaev explained that his advantage would come from wrestling and grappling.He believes his ground skills set him apart. At the same time, he admitted respect for Pereira’s striking ability, calling it elite.For now, the fight remains uncertain. Alex Pereira continues his reign at light heavyweight, while Khamzat Chimaev waits for clarity.Fans continue to discuss the matchup online, but according to Chimaev, the final call rests with the UFC.Also Read: “That’s A Heavy Punchy Man”: Conor McGregor Raises Safety Concerns For Jake Paul Before Facing Dangerous Anthony Joshua In Boxing",Khamzat chimaev has spoken openly about a possible fight with alex pereira.

While some viewers find the content warm and cozy, critics argue the lifestyle inspiration falls flat, despite the show generating significant discussion.

Critics question purpose, execution, and Meghan Markle’s presence on her own show

Zack Peter DRAGS Meghan Markle’s Christmas Special: “She’s Just… Not That Bright” | DLIS





Meghan Markle’s latest Netflix project, With Love, Meghan: Holiday Celebration, arrived with cozy intentions; festive recipes, warm conversation, and a dose of lifestyle inspiration from the Duchess of Sussex. But instead of being greeted with holiday cheer, the special has become a new target for online commentators who question whether the series has any meaningful value.While Markle’s cooking-and-chat format aims to show a more relatable side of her life, critics argue the execution feels confused and uninspired. One of the loudest voices in the backlash is blogger and podcaster Zack Peter, who didn’t hold back during an appearance on Don’t Let It Stu, hosted by Chef Stuart O’Keeffe.Peter slammed the show for lacking purpose, delivering one of the harshest critiques yet. “Like I just, I don't understand the value of this show. I don't get it. Who is watching it? Why are you watching it?” he said before moving into a fiery assessment of Markle herself.“It's not like you're watching it because she's pretty. It's not like you're watching it because she's talented. It's not like you're watching it because you're really learning anything.It's like, why are we watching this show? What are you selling me? A jam?” He went on to call Markle “a f**king loser,” a comment that has since circulated heavily online.Peter and O’Keeffe then mocked moments from the episode, especially Meghan reacting to her own ingredients as though she was reading them for the first time. O’Keeffe joked, “And then she’s like, and so there’s 2 cups of powdered sugar. Wow. That's a lot of sugar.” Peter responded with equal sarcasm: “You don't even know what we're f**king making. Why am I here?”Not all reactions have been hostile. Italian chef Francesco Mazzei recently weighed in on Talking Royals, suggesting Meghan’s recipes might still produce great food, even if her technique is questionable. He admitted, “I don't think so,” when asked if he enjoyed her show, but added, “maybe she did an amazing dish.”Despite the backlash, some viewers say the special feels “warm and cosy,” proving that Meghan’s lifestyle approach may appeal more as comfort content than culinary instruction. Whether critics like it or not, Markle’s holiday show has clearly achieved one goal, everyone is talking about it.Also Read: ""A MAGA"": Perez Hilton calls out Sydney Sweeney’s 'new stance' as she finally addresses American Eagle ad outrage","Meghan markle's new netflix holiday special, ""with love, meghan: holiday celebration,"" has drawn criticism for its perceived lack of purpose and uninspired execution.

Shedeur Sanders ends the “thonggate” talk



The Cleveland Browns found themselves at the center of one of the strangest viral moments of the week, and it had nothing to do with playbooks or game plans. Instead, rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders became the focus of an unexpected debate that spread across social media faster than any highlight. Viewers paused their screens, zoomed in and argued over one simple question: was he wearing a thong under his uniform? The clip dominated timelines, leaving fans confused and amused in equal measure.While the noise grew louder online, Shedeur was shaking off none of it. He had just delivered his strongest performance so far, throwing for 364 yards and three touchdowns in a tough loss to the Titans. His play was so sharp that head coach Kevin Stefanski immediately named him the Browns’ starter for the final four games. Yet even on a night filled with promise, the internet turned its attention to a mystery that only one person could clear up.The answer came straight from a family conversation when his brother, Shilo Sanders, decided to address the topic head-on. Shilo didn’t waste time and asked, “Let's cut to the business, bruh. Did you wear a thong or not?”Shedeur couldn’t help but laugh. He explained, “Come on, bruh… You forgot I had a little back injury, right? So I get my back taped.But that is crazy that it did look like that. That's funny, though.” For anyone still unsure, he added one final line: “Yes, bro. There's not no thong, bruh. That’s just weird.”With that, the mystery turned out to be nothing more than medical tape. The rookie later posted “Yall trippin” on Instagram, a short message that captured his disbelief at how quickly the story blew up.Still, the moment offered a glimpse into how fast a sideline clip can become a cultural topic. Fans joked about rookie hazing, theories piled up and memes flooded feeds. Through it all, Shedeur stayed focused on football, not fashion.Now that “thonggate” is settled, Sanders and his taped-up back head into their next challenge against the Chicago Bears, hoping the conversation shifts back to the one thing he controls: his performance on the field.Also Read: Drake Maye’s wife Ann trades “Bakemas” videos for unforgettable glam moment at Patriots’ big holiday gathering","Cleveland browns quarterback shedeur sanders was the focus of an unexpected debate.

Why A’ja Wilson chose the Infinity Gauntlet look



A new level of championship energy from A’ja Wilson



A’ja Wilson arrived at the Las Vegas Aces championship parade carrying more than a trophy haul. She walked into Toshiba Plaza with a gold Infinity Gauntlet on her left hand, turning the moment into a bold visual summary of a season that rewrote record books.The accessory captured the scale of her dominance and offered a snapshot of an athlete finally willing to embrace the noise that followed her unmatched run. Every stone represented a milestone, and each one told the league exactly where she now stands.Her celebration quickly became one of the most replayed images from the Aces’ third title run. It stood out because it distilled her year into something fans could instantly understand. A’ja Wilson ruled the moment, collected her achievements at historic speed, and wanted the world to see the truth of her rise. TIME later named her its 2025 Athlete of the Year, and she explainedthe real reason behind wearing the Marvel comic’s villain Thanos’ Gauntlet.Wilson labeled each stone with an honor earned across an unprecedented stretch, starting with her second scoring title, becoming the fastest player in WNBA history to hit 5,000 points, her third Defensive Player of the Year award, a fourth MVP, her second Finals MVP, and a third championship.No player in WNBA or NBA history ever pulled off that full slate in a single season. Even her father, Roscoe, joked about it, saying, “I’m waiting on them to call for the Academy Award and the Emmy. ”The image mattered because Wilson wanted the symbolism to match the reality. Speaking about the choice, she explained, “When you’ve collected everything, that’s Thanos. And this year, I collected everything.” She admitted she rarely leans into self-promotion, preferring her play to take the lead.
