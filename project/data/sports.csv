Ruturaj Gaikwad press conference: Reveals Gautam Gambhir message, No.4 and more

Poll Do you believe Kohli can maintain this form for the upcoming matches? Yes, he can No, it's temporary I'm not sure

NEW DELHI: Virat Kohli hasn’t just returned to form — he has set off a nationwide frenzy strong enough to sell out an entire stadium. Back-to-back centuries in Ranchi and Raipur have turned what was shaping up to be a low-interest ODI in Visakhapatnam into the hottest cricket ticket in India this week. According to officials at the Andhra Cricket Association (ACA), Kohli’s stunning run-scoring spree single-handedly reversed sluggish online bookings for the third ODI against South Africa at the Dr. Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy ACA-VDCA Stadium.When tickets first went on sale digitally on November 28, the association braced for a disappointing turnout. The lack of buzz even pushed the ACA towards the rare option of setting up offline ticket counters despite committing to a fully digital system this time. But everything changed the moment Kohli unfurled a spectacular century in Ranchi on November 30. Suddenly, Phase 2 and 3 of ticket sales disappeared in minutes.“The first phase response wasn’t good,” confirmed Y. Venkatesh from ACA’s Media and Operations department to The Indian Express. “After Kohli’s hundred at Ranchi, the second and third phases vanished in minutes. Nothing was left unsold.”It wasn’t just victory that fans chased — it was the chance to witness a phenomenon.Kohli’s numbers in Vizag fuelled the madness: an average of 97.83 in seven ODIs, featuring three centuries and a 99. Even ticket prices ranging from Rs 1,200 to Rs 18,000 couldn’t slow demand.The frenzy spilled into real life, too. Hours before Team India landed in Vizag, hundreds gathered at the airport, waiting through repeated flight delays from Raipur. Security guards were bombarded with one question in multiple languages: “When are they landing?” The answer mattered because Kohli was on board.After his 53rd ODI century in Raipur, cricket legends poured in praise. But the loudest came from Mohammad Kaif, who summed up a nation’s emotion in eight simple words: “Without Kohli cricket is nothing… pure vintage!”","Back-to-back centuries in ranchi and raipur have turned what was shaping up to be a low-interest odi in visakhapatnam into the hottest cricket ticket in india this week.

Who Wins This Trade?

has emerged as one of the most realistic trade pathways of the offseason, a move that would instantly upgrade the team’s lineup while giving the Dodgers financial flexibility and roster breathing room. The framework aligns with current trade chatter, where one MLB-ready Braves arm plus 1–2 mid-tier prospects could be enough to bring the veteran slugger to Atlanta.Below is a complete analysis of how the deal works, why both teams would consider it, what Hernández brings on and off the field, and which side would ultimately win the trade.Teoscar Hernández is not a free agent. He is under contract with the Dodgers on a three-year, 66 million dollar deal running through 2027, a structure that includes significant deferred money and a buyout on a 2028 club option. With roughly 33 million owed over the final two years, any transaction is a straight MLB trade.• Los Angeles Dodgers send: Teoscar Hernández (2 years of control, age 33–34 seasons)• Atlanta Braves send: One MLB-ready young starter/swingman; Plus 1–2 mid-tier prospects. Dodgers may include salary relief or take back a small contractThe Braves would use Hernández mainly as a full-time DH and occasional corner outfielder to minimize defensive pressure.The Dodgers, meanwhile, would gain arms, prospect depth, and valuable payroll flexibility as they pursue other outfield targets.Atlanta Braves have spent recent offseasons searching for one specific piece: a middle-of-the-order bat who deepens the lineup behind Ronald Acuña Jr. and Austin Riley. With DH and a rotating corner-outfield spot available, they have room for a true power presence capable of impacting postseason matchups.Teoscar Hernández fits that mold cleanly.• Produced 33 homers, 99 RBI and an .840 OPS in 2024 for the Dodgers• Delivered a .350 average during their 2024 World Series run• Maintains elite hard-hit rate, barrel rate, and power metrics• Hit .284 with an .830 OPS with runners in scoring position in 2025, including .318 and .893 with two outs• Option for immediate lineup protection behind Acuña, Riley, and OlsonEven in his “down” 2025 season, Hernández still hit 25 home runs with 89 RBI in 134 games - easily above-average DH production.For most clubs, trading a 30-plus homer bat makes little sense. For the Dodgers, it aligns with how they manage the long-term roster.• His remaining 33 million dollar obligation affects future payroll planning• They want room for younger, cheaper internal options or a bigger-name outfield acquisition• They aim to preserve payroll space for the rotation and future mega-extensions• Trading him returns controllable pitching and prospects, which their development system thrives onBy moving Hernández now, Los Angeles can redistribute money into pitching, reinforce their depth chart, and maintain flexibility while still competing.Even with fluctuations, his power remains constant, a critical trait for a contender like Atlanta. The 2024 ceiling is the version the Braves believe they can unlock in a hitter-friendly environment.• Age: 33 (entering age-34 and 35 seasons of his contract)• Profile: Right-handed hitter/thrower• Contract: Three years, 66 million; 33 million remaining; includes deferred money and a club option buyoutFor a club firmly in its competitive window, the financial commitment aligns well with Atlanta’s cost-controlled core.• Adds a proven 30-homer bat with postseason success• Ideal DH/corner-outfield fit• Contract size aligns with Atlanta’s win-now approach• Strikeout-prone and streaky at times• Prospect and financial cost reduce flexibility• Defensive limitations require careful handling• Clears a meaningful salary slot• Opens outfield/DH lanes for cheaper or star-level additions• Gains controllable pitching and prospects• Enhances long-term payroll positioning• Loses a power bat instrumental in their 2024 title• Replacement bats must step up immediately• Risk of public backlash if Hernández thrives in AtlantaShort-term, the Braves likely win if Hernández delivers anywhere near his 2024 level. One season of top-tier production during a championship chase is often worth far more than a mid-rotation arm or mid-tier prospects.Long-term, the Dodgers could easily come out ahead if the acquired arms produce value or are flipped into a bigger star. Their front office excels at maximizing these types of deals.Also read: MLB trade rumors: Los Angeles Dodgers predicted to chase $80 Million Chicago Bulls MVP as Michael Conforto filler Either way, the move creates a rare win-now versus long-view dynamic between two contending organizations, the kind of trade rumblings that make December baseball interesting.","Teoscar hernández is not a free agent.

What a Reunion Would Mean for the Warriors

Themay be eyeing a reunion that would a fan-favorite veteran ahead of the trade deadline. With the franchise looking to sharpen its three-point firepower for the rest of the season, recent speculation suggests the team could target a familiar face: Dallas Mavericks guard Klay Thompson, a four-time NBA champion currently on a $50 million deal.The discussion gained traction after Blue Man Hoop’s Nick San Miguel suggested that Dallas, now in organizational transition, could move on from some of its higher-priced veterans. As Miguel wrote, “With the Mavericks in a state of flux after firing general manager Nico Harrison, it would not be surprising if they traded away some of their pricier players like (Klay) Thompson or Anthony Davis.”Golden State’s intentions have been clear from the moment they signed Seth Curry on Monday. A franchise built on outside shooting needs more consistency from deep, and Curry’s arrival already looks promising.In his first game with the Warriors, the 35-year-old guard delivered 14 points while shooting an impressive 85.7 percent from the field and 66.7 percent from three against the Oklahoma City Thunder. Still, the front office appears to be exploring additional depth options.The Golden State Warriors have rotated through several shooting guards this season, hoping someone would seize the role.Here’s how the current situation stands:Nick San Miguel emphasized this instability, noting, “Golden State has cycled through the shooting guard position this season.” That context opens the door to the possibility of bringing back Thompson, a move that would be both sentimental and strategic. (H/t: Sporting News)Dallas Mavericks’ front office changes have created uncertainty around the roster. Klay Thompson, now 6-foot-5 and 21 games into the season, has delivered a mix of high-ceiling performances and off nights that have raised questions about his consistency.His performances have ranged widely, with games where he “set the nets on fire” and others where he “looked washed-up in every aspect of the game.” That unpredictability makes him a gamble=, but one the Warriors may feel is worthwhile.Bringing Klay Thompson back would tap into a decade of history. The Golden State Warriors’ four championships with Stephen Curry all came with Thompson by his side. While his current form is less reliable, the franchise might view the reunion as a chance to recapture some of that magic as Curry’s career winds down.• Familiarity with Steve Kerr’s system• Deep playoff experience• Ability to stretch the floor• Potential second-unit scoring sparkEven with concerns about consistency, Thompson’s long-range resume remains elite. If he can rediscover rhythm in a familiar environment, he could become a valuable contributor for a team still chasing another title in the Curry era.If Golden State does pursue a trade, expectations would need to be tempered. Thompson is no longer the 20-point scorer he once was, but his shooting gravity and veteran presence could elevate a second unit that has lacked stability.The move would also carry emotional weight. For fans, players, and even the organization, welcoming Thompson back would feel like closing a circle—one more run with a core that defined an era of NBA basketball.Also read: NBA trade rumors: Los Angeles Lakers predicted to land $186 million Milwaukee Bucks superstar to form Big 3 with LeBron James and Luka Doncic As of now, it remains speculation, but the idea is no longer far-fetched. The Warriors want shooting, the Mavericks may be recalibrating, and Thompson sits right at the intersection of both storylines. Whether nostalgia or strategy ultimately drives the decision, Golden State could find itself revisiting one of the most iconic partnerships in franchise history.","The golden state warriors have rotated through several shooting guards this season, hoping someone would seize the role.

The wife of LA Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford has found her own way to rebound from Sunday’s exhausting Week 13 loss. Kelly Stafford skipped the gloomy weather and the sting of the Rams’ 31–28 defeat and headed straight to Mexico, where sunshine, warm water and good friends offered the perfect escape. She shared on Instagram that she has been in Cabo celebrating the 40th birthday of her close friend Jess Clausen, the wife of former NFL quarterback Jimmy Clausen. The trip has turned into a cheerful break filled with laughter, ocean views and a reminder that life moves forward.Kelly posted a carousel of photos showing the group relaxing on a boat, taking fishing trips, enjoying long beachside meals and even squeezing in a friendly tennis match. The podcaster looked confident and carefree in a bikini, soaking in the moment far from the rain-soaked stadium in Charlotte, where she had watched the Rams fall short after Matthew Stafford’s late fourth-quarter fumble. She had also been busy that night searching for the football from her husband’s record-breaking pass, which teammate Davante Adams had unknowingly given away.Matthew Stafford’s wife, Kelly, uploaded a series of sunny photos from the celebration in Los Cabos.She wore a green bikini as the centerpiece of her look, pairing it with soft layers and warm colors that highlighted the playful feel of the trip. The top carried a bright geometric print with emerald, lime and turquoise woven together. The matching bottoms had slim side ties resting high on her hips. She added a moss green wrap loosely knotted at her waist that showed off her toned midriff.Her accessories stayed simple. Kelly wore sleek black oval sunglasses, and in some photos, she added a silk bandana in warm oranges and pinks. The relaxed styling matched the tone of her caption, where she wrote, “Celebrating you is easy @jessclausen,” and added, “Happy birthday to one of my best friends, may this be the best decade yet ❤️❤️❤️.”Matthew Stafford, meanwhile, has already shifted gears. He said getting over losses “just feels like it comes easy to me” and reminded reporters that another game always waits. The Rams head next to State Farm Stadium for a division showdown with the Cardinals, and Kelly seems to be carrying that same forward-looking spirit.Also Read: Kylie Kelce reveals how Jason’s endless patience keeps their home calm amid four daughters’ nonstop “why” questions","The wife of la rams quarterback matthew stafford has found her own way to rebound from sunday’s exhausting week 13 loss.

Stefanos Tsitsipas and Paula Badosa’s journey from power couple to breakup

Former tennis couple Stefanos Tsitsipas and Paula Badosa were once seen as a bright, happy pair in the sport. But now, Tsitsipas’s mother, Julia Tsitsipas, has shared a very open view of why their romance did not last. She told Telegraf that the relationship was “complicated from beginning to end” and said both players entered it while already “traumatised” by injuries. Julia explained that their love was never simple. She said, “Their relationship was not ordinary, everyday,” and added that the breakup shook her son even though he never thought about ending his tennis career because of it.Julia also shared that the long-distance nature of the relationship made things even harder. She said Badosa did distract Tsitsipas at times, but the emotional pain after the breakup was stronger. As a former tennis player herself, she believed players should stay calm during such moments, but she still understood how difficult it was for him.Stefanos Tsitsipas and Paula Badosa became one of tennis’s most loved pairs when they went public in 2023. Fans called them “Tsitsidosa,” and their photos and videos quickly spread online.But behind the attention, the two were dealing with their own struggles.When they started dating, Badosa was still recovering from injuries, and Tsitsipas was moving from event to event around the world. The distance made it tough. They first broke up in May 2023, saying it was friendly, but within three weeks they were back together. Their bond looked strong again, and fans were excited.However, by July 2024, things changed. Both players lost in the first round at Wimbledon, and soon after, they split again. A source told ¡Hola! magazine that the breakup “just happened” and said their injuries and rough period in tennis affected their emotions. The source also said there were no fights, no family issues, and no third person involved. It was simply two adults trying hard but unable to make it work.After their breakup, both unfollowed each other on social media and removed past posts. And in November 2024, Badosa quietly confirmed she was single by wearing a sash that read “Sexy and single” at her 28th birthday celebration in Dubai.Their story showed how even famous players face real feelings and real challenges, just like anyone else.Also Read: Andre Agassi shows rare soft side in Maryland as his sweet surprise for Steffi Graf turns into a cherished moment","Former tennis couple stefanos tsitsipas and paula badosa broke up in 2024.

Kobe Bryant childhood friend claims NBA star didn’t help family or friends





A new claim is stirring conversation about Kobe Bryant ’s personal life. An alleged childhood friend of the late NBA legend has said that Kobe “wasn’t a good person” and “didn’t help his own family and friends.” While these allegations are gaining attention online, it’s important to look at the full picture. Kobe Bryant was a complex individual; fiercely driven, sometimes distant, but also known for acts of generosity and mentorship throughout his life.According to the report, the alleged friend says he asked Kobe for help during a difficult period, hoping for support or opportunities. The friend claims Kobe promised to assist but never followed through, leaving him disappointed. The person also alleged that Kobe didn’t support members of his family financially or personally, despite his reported $500 million fortune. These statements are entirely the friend’s perspective and have not been independently verified.Kobe himself admitted in interviews that he was not always a great friend, explaining that his relentless focus on basketball and career left him little time for personal relationships.He had strained ties with some family members and was known to be selective about where he invested his personal energy. At the same time, Kobe had a reputation for helping others outside of his immediate circle. He participated in numerous charity projects, mentored young athletes, and even helped strangers in unexpected situations, showing a more generous side of his personality.The news has sparked a mix of reactions online. Some fans expressed sympathy for the childhood friend, acknowledging that public figures can sometimes neglect personal relationships. Others defended Kobe, citing his generosity, mentorship, and larger contributions to the basketball community. Social media is buzzing with debates, highlighting how complex and multifaceted Kobe’s legacy remains.Kobe Bryant was an intensely driven athlete and a global icon. Public figures often have conflicting personal and public personas, one person’s negative experience doesn’t define the entirety of a life or legacy. While the alleged friend’s claims suggest disappointment and a sense of betrayal, there are numerous verified stories of Kobe’s generosity and mentorship. His legacy continues to inspire millions, even as these new allegations spark discussion.The allegations from Kobe Bryant’s alleged childhood friend highlight one perspective of the basketball star’s personal relationships, but they do not define his full story. Kobe’s life included both challenges in personal connections and countless acts of generosity, mentorship, and inspiration that impacted people around the world.

The speculation began when the two were photographed in the same setting at Hockey Canada’s Olympic preparation events, instantly giving rise to questions about whether there was more than a professional connection between them.As one of the NHL’s brightest young stars, Bedard has been under constant public scrutiny on and off the ice. Even casual sightings tend to go viral. And this interaction with Primerano was no exception. Social media quickly filled with theories, jokes, and fan hopefulness. Thus, turning a simple moment into a trending NHL storyline.Despite the excitement, no confirmed information supports the idea that Bedard and Primerano are dating. Sources close to Bedard have emphasized that he continues to keep his private life out of the spotlight. This aligns with his earlier dismissal of dating rumors. That is involving TikTok creator Emma Loken in 2023. The moment when he made it clear such speculation was baseless.On the other hand, Chloe Primerano, a rising figure in Canadian women’s hockey, has been preparing for future national team opportunities.Her presence at Hockey Canada’s camp appears tied to her development and Olympic evaluation; not any personal involvement with Bedard. She previously shined with the Minnesota Golden Gophers, posting 31 points in 35 games.The fan reactions ranged widely. Some supporters expressed excitement at the idea of two elite young athletes connecting, while others joked that Bedard should “focus on hockey” as he heads into the 2025–26 NHL season after a strong 67-point campaign. The situation also highlights how quickly parasocial narratives form around modern athletes, especially those in the spotlight as intensely as Bedard.For now, Connor Bedard remains officially single, and the Chloe Primerano rumors fall squarely into the category of fan-driven speculation. Unless either player chooses to address the story directly, the buzz remains just that; another chapter in the ongoing fascination with one of hockey’s most followed young stars.Also Read: NHL Update: Brad Marchand and his family hosts Thanksgiving to comfort teammates missing home","Chicago blackhawks' connor bedard was linked to team canada women's defenseman chloe primerano.

Who Wins the Deal?

' front office is quietly positioning itself for a move that could reshape the late innings of the 2026 season. According to widespread reporting, including coverage from Sporting News and Seattle-based outlets, the Mariners are showing serious interest in Philadelphia Phillies left-hander Matt Strahm, one of the league’s steadiest high-leverage arms. As original writer Caleb Hightower noted, the Mariners are circling a move that would be received as a major statement around the league: “The Golden State Warriors have a chance to make a move that would stun the NBA world.” While referencing a different sport, the sentiment from Hightower reflects the magnitude insiders are attaching to a potential Strahm deal for Seattle.The Seattle Mariners, who finished 2025 with a top-10 bullpen ERA but limited left-handed depth, appear focused on Matt Strahm over other Phillies southpaws such as José Alvarado and Tanner Banks. With the Winter Meetings underway, league chatter suggests Seattle wants to solidify the final innings next to Gabe Speier, especially after falling one win shy of the 2025 World Series.No formal offer has been submitted, but analysts agree that the cleanest path involves a one-for-one swap: Matt Strahm goes to Seattle, while the Philadelphia Phillies receive top catching prospect Harry Ford.Strahm, owed $7.5 million in 2026, is entering his final year of club control.Ford, ranked No. 4 in Seattle’s system and No. 40 overall by MLB Pipeline, has long been considered one of the organization’s most dynamic young players. He hit .283 with 16 homers and an .868 OPS at Triple-A Tacoma before his late-season promotion in 2025. With Cal Raleigh entrenched as Seattle’s everyday catcher and coming off an AL MVP runner-up campaign, Ford’s long-term path is blocked.Philadelphia Phillies' interest makes sense. Ford’s 35 steals in 2024 minors showcase a rare speed-power profile for a catcher, and the Phillies are facing looming outfield needs, payroll adjustments, and succession planning behind J.T. Realmuto.Matt Strahm has quietly become one of MLB’s most reliable late-inning relievers. His .499 OPS allowed in high-leverage scenarios during 2025 underscores why Seattle Marinewrs view him as a playoff weapon. His ability to miss bats, paired with a 93rd-percentile chase rate, fits perfectly into a bullpen that ranked ninth overall but lacked left-handed strikeout juice.Seattle’s bullpen posted a collective 3.72 ERA in 2025, but with only Speier providing consistent left-handed production, the need for another late-inning southpaw grew increasingly obvious as October approached.• Immediate upgrade in high-leverage innings• A proven postseason arm with strong command• No long-term salary burden• Strahm’s profile matches T-Mobile Park’s pitcher-friendly environment• Helps address a bullpen that converted just 62.3 percent of save opportunitiesSeattle Marainers are also in an aggressive stage of its competitive cycle. Coming off a near-pennant run, the front office is attempting to maximize its window without sacrificing core pieces.• Harry Ford offers controllable years and fills both catching and outfield depth concerns• Phillies save $7.5 million for 2026, preserving flexibility for outfield or right-handed relief upgrades• Ford’s speed-power potential could address a lineup that needs athleticism and long-term planning• Allows Philadelphia to move a reliever before free agency rather than risk losing him for nothing• Strahm enhances the bullpen instantly with strikeouts and late-inning poise• Complements Seattle’s dominant starting rotation• Avoids long-term payroll commitments while keeping the roster competitive• Acquire an MLB-ready prospect with valuable versatility• Maintain roster balance amid impending outfield uncertainties• Add future cost-controlled production• Trading Ford thins catching depth behind Cal Raleigh• Strahm is 34, limiting multi-year upside• Reliever performance is naturally volatile• Losing Strahm removes their most reliable left-handed reliever• Ford’s defense still lags behind his bat and athletic toolsFrom a pure impact standpoint, the Seattle Mariners come out ahead in the short term. Their push to capitalize on a championship window makes Strahm’s role clear and immediate. His high-leverage steadiness, postseason readiness, and ability to neutralize AL West lefty-righty sluggers offer value that far outweighs the risk.Philadelphia, meanwhile, benefits from adding a high-end prospect without absorbing financial strain, but the loss of Strahm undeniably weakens their bullpen until internal arms or external signings fill the gap.Also read: MLB trade rumors: Chicago Cubs refocus on $80 million Boston Red Sox superstar to compensate for Kyle Tucker departure Both sides satisfy key organizational needs, but Seattle’s immediate return gives them the edge.","Matt strahm has quietly become one of mlb’s most reliable late-inning relievers.

Connor McDavid talks Oilers’ offensive bounce-back against Kraken



POST-RAW | Connor McDavid 12.04.25

Edmonton Oilers’ star Connor McDavid expressed relief and optimism after the team displayed a potent offensive performance against the Seattle Kraken, scoring nine goals in a dominant display. After a challenging start to the season, this game offered a glimpse of the scoring rhythm that helped the Oilers reach back-to-back Western Conference finals. McDavid’s comments highlight both individual and team confidence returning at a crucial stage of the campaign.The Oilers improved to a 12-11-5 record with the victory, sitting just outside the Western Conference wild card playoff spots. For a team that has struggled to consistently replicate its playoff form, Thursday’s win provides a much-needed morale boost and underscores the offensive potential McDavid has consistently delivered throughout his career.During his media session, McDavid acknowledged the team’s offensive struggles this season but praised the collective performance against the Kraken. “Yeah, I feel like we haven’t really had that all year,” he said. “Feels good to get a couple as a group, and hopefully guys are feeling good about themselves and we can build on it.”Edmonton’s ability to score in bunches was on full display, with McDavid himself noting the uniqueness of the performance.He compared the moment to his first career hat trick in Dallas, emphasizing both the excitement and rarity of such an offensive surge. “You guys might think I’m crazy, but the only one I can remember like that would have been my first hattrick goal in Dallas. Definitely a unique one,” McDavid explained.Consistency will be key for the Oilers as they aim to climb the standings and secure a playoff berth. With McDavid leading the charge, Edmonton has the offensive firepower to challenge any Western Conference team. Analysts and fans alike will be watching closely to see if the Oilers can sustain this momentum and return to the form that made them one of the league’s top contenders in recent seasons.Thursday’s 9-goal performance not only boosts confidence but also sends a message to opponents that when the Oilers’ offense is clicking, they remain a formidable force. For Edmonton, the focus now shifts to maintaining this level of play as the season progresses, with McDavid at the center of their scoring efforts.Also Read: Connor Bedard extends goal streak as Blackhawks secure 2-1 win over Kings: Coach Jeff Blashill praises rookie’s “big step” forward",Edmonton oilers scored nine goals in a 9-0 win over the seattle kraken.

Is New Jersey Devils aiming for Predators’ Steven Stamkos as trade rumors swirl?

Also read:

Rumors are currently doing the rounds as the Nashville Predators’ center, Steven Stamkos, has once again emerged as a potential trade candidate amid growing speculation around his long-term fit with the team. For a long time, Stamkos hasn’t had a great relationship since he signed a four-year deal in the 2024 offseason.According to reports, several Eastern Conference contenders have quietly begun exploring the possibility of acquiring Stamkos. While no formal trade negotiations have been publicly confirmed yet. It has also come to light recently that, despite reports claiming the Predators haven't approached the 35-year-old right winger about his future, but his name continues to surface as a trade candidate.As per the NHL, Stamkos is signed through 2027-28 with an average annual value of $8 million and a full no-movement clause. The two-time Richard Trophy winner and Stanley Cup champion has seen a deterioration in his performance since tallying 40 goals in 2023-24 with his former club, the Tampa Bay Lightning.The Nashville Predators' disappointing season has put Steven Stamkos at the center of growing trade speculation. Reports suggest that several teams have approached the player to acquire him, and one of them is the New Jersey Devils.Meanwhile, Sportsnet’s Ryan Dixon suggested five potential destinations for Stamkos, provided he agrees to waive his no-movement clause. The teams he identified were the Montreal Canadiens, Winnipeg Jets, Seattle Kraken, Carolina Hurricanes, and Detroit Red Wings.Reports suggest that the Canadiens were reportedly looking into his availability in early November, but none of the others is believed to have made calls yet. However, NHL insiders and analysts are pointing towards New Jersey’s huge potential to acquire him.In fact, Pierre LeBrun, in his most recent article for The Athletic, stated, “My understanding is that the New Jersey Devils have discussed his name internally, among many other trade targets, of course.” He further added, “The Devils were also among the suitors for Stamkos when he was a free agent in 2024. So there’s a bit of history there. It’s something to keep an eye on as we get closer to the March 6 trade deadline.”But, it won’t be as easy as it seems to acquire him, as Stamkos has a full no-move clause on his contract, which makes it tricky for any team looking to acquire him.As for his current performance, Steven Stamkos has scored almost 53 points in 82 games last season, a 28-point drop-off from the previous year’s total. Despite recording six points in his last five games, he is currently on track for 33 points in 82 games this season.","Rumors swirl as predators’ steven stamkos linked to eastern conference.

Dak Prescott sounds off after offensive pass interference call against Cowboys



Cowboys’ defensive lapses and controversial call prove too much to overcome



The Detroit Lions halted the Dallas Cowboys’ three-game winning run with a 44-30 victory on Thursday night, but the outcome quickly shifted from football to officiating. A fourth-quarter penalty on tight end Jake Ferguson became the focal point, sparking immediate backlash and putting the NFL’s officiating standards back under the microscope.For the Cowboys, the defeat wasn’t just about missed tackles or stalled drives, it was about a moment that flipped the momentum of a tight game. And Dak Prescott made it clear that he wasn’t buying the explanation behind the flag that derailed a crucial scoring opportunity.On a pivotal 3rd-and-3 from the Detroit 11-yard line, officials flagged Ferguson for offensive pass interference, wiping out a promising chance for Dallas to close the gap. The call stunned the Cowboys’ sideline and triggered immediate reaction across the league. While Pat McAfee took a playful jab at the officiating crew on his show, Prescott didn’t hold back when asked about the decision.“Do I get fined for talking about this? I’m sorry, that was bad,” Prescott said, choosing his words carefully before criticizing the ruling. “I got to look at the film, maybe I can see it from their vantage point.I talked to the ref after, he said [Ferguson] aggressively pulled through. I’ve never seen a call like that.”Prescott finished the night with 376 passing yards on 31-of-47 attempts, throwing one touchdown and two interceptions. His strong yardage output wasn’t enough to overcome Dallas’ defensive struggles, as the unit allowed 17 points on three consecutive Detroit drives in the second half. Those lapses, combined with the questionable penalty, created a deficit the Cowboys couldn’t erase.Detroit, meanwhile, executed with poise, capitalizing on Dallas’ mistakes and controlling key moments. Their balanced offense kept the Cowboys off rhythm, and the controversial call only widened the gap late.As debate over the penalty grows, the loss leaves Dallas with more questions than clarity. For Prescott, the frustration comes from seeing a crucial moment taken out of the Cowboys’ hands, and the impact of that call is sure to remain a major talking point in the days ahead.Also Read: NFL injury update: Baker Mayfield hopeful as Mike Evans and Jalen McMillan inch closer to Tampa Bay comeback","Detroit lions halted dallas cowboys' three-game winning run with 44-30 victory on thursday night.

Sal Licata reacts to Edwin Díaz, Devin Williams and why the Yankees’ stance feels odd

Edwin Díaz is one of baseball’s best closers and he is a free agent after opting out of his Mets contract at the end of the season. The New York Mets and other teams are talking about bringing him back, but reports say the New York Yankees are not seen as a serious threat to sign Díaz right now. That surprised many voices in baseball this week.Edwin Díaz closed big games for the Mets for years and he still throws hard and shuts down lineups. The Mets moved quickly this week by signing Devin Williams to a three-year deal, a move that could change Díaz’s market but teams, writers and radio hosts are asking why the Yankees would not at least try to chase him. The question came up on New York radio and on MLB coverage as free agency unfolded in early December 2025.Radio host and MLB commentator Sal Licata told listeners on WFAN that the Yankees should always be in the running for top players like Edwin Díaz.Licata asked why the Yankees “wouldn’t be a threat” to sign a top closer and made the simple point that big teams should pursue elite talent whenever they can.His comments aired after news broke that the Mets had agreed to terms with Devin Williams. The New York Mets signed reliever Devin Williams to a reported three-year, $51 million deal on December 2, 2025.That deal was reported by multiple outlets and confirmed by MLB sources. The move gives the Mets bullpen depth but does not remove Edwin Díaz from the team’s radar; MLB.com reported that the Mets remain interested in Diaz even after the Williams signing.Still, some insiders say Williams’ arrival lowers the Mets’ urgency to offer a long, costly extension to Díaz. Edwin Díaz is a three-time All-Star and one of the best closers available this winter.If the Yankees truly step away, it shifts the market and narrows Díaz’s choices. Licata and others see the Yankees’ reported posture as strange because New York has payroll room and a history of chasing top free agents.The radio reaction shows how quickly one signing Williams to the Mets can change roster plans across the league.Also Read: Bo Bichette Contract Talks Hit Another Pause After Analysts Explain Major Risks Facing The Toronto Blue Jays","Mlb analyst calls out yankees after surprising move to pass on 3-time all-star edwin díaz.

Los Angeles Lakers’ bold Austin Reaves trade dream hits a harsh reality in Giannis Antetokounmpo chase

Giannis’ uncertain future takes a dramatic turn with injury amides trading issues

The NBA trade deadline of February 5 is quickly approaching, and conjecture surrounds Giannis Antetokounmpo's future. As the Milwaukee Bucks' star player, his status is a heated topic among both fans and analysts. According to recent projections, there are several prospective trading partners for him.As Giannis Antetokounmpo trade rumors heat up, the Los Angeles Lakers have emerged as a potential dark horse option to snag the Milwaukee Bucks superstar. In fact, multiple teams are emerging as strong competitors to sign Antetokounmpo. According to reports, the New York Knicks are the favorites, with a 28% probability of acquiring the two-time MVP via trade.The Los Angeles Lakers' decision to trade Austin Reaves for Antetokounmpo, Luka Doncic, and LeBron James has generated significant attention. However, NBA expert Jake Fischer believes it may not be enough to close the deal.According to NBA insider Jake Fischer of The Stein Line, Milwaukee Bucks superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo told at least one teammate this summer that he believed a trade with the New York Knicks was virtually complete.Additionally, according to Shams Charania of ESPN, Antetokounmpo and his agent, Alex Saratsis, are ""having conversations with Milwaukee"" about ""whether his best fit is staying or [pursuing] a move elsewhere."" Naturally, the rumor mill has been in full swing ever since, with ""several teams"" allegedly considering trade packages for the two-time MVP.Furthermore, Fischer shed light on the growing Antetokounmpo trade environment, defining the Bucks' greatest odds for recouping value if they part with their long-time franchise cornerstone.While Fischer identified the Atlanta Hawks and San Antonio Spurs as potential trade partners, he was less optimistic about the Lakers' chances of pulling off a major deal. The league insider emphasized the organization's few trade assets outside Reaves, as well as the uncertainty of how Milwaukee will build around the fifth-year player.He wrote:“The Lakers simply don’t appear to have anything close to the draft capital — or the young talent — to truly make a competitive offer to tempt the Bucks … unless Milwaukee sees Austin Reaves as a [Trae] Young-esque talent who will emerge as a perennial All-Star to build around moving forward.”Nonetheless, Kalshi's market estimates indicate that Antetokounmpo will remain with the Bucks after the trade deadline by 29%. Despite trade rumours, Milwaukee is presently the top contender for his services.Antetokounmpo recently suffered a calf injury, prompting questions about his future with the organization. According to ESPN's Shams Charania, he is in talks with the Bucks about whether to stay or move on to another organization.The San Antonio Spurs also have a 15% probability of acquiring Antetokounmpo. Pairing him alongside rookie sensation Victor Wembanyama could result in a deadly tandem in the league.When healthy, Antetokounmpo has shown MVP-level skill this season, averaging 30.6 points, 10.7 rebounds, and 6.4 assists while shooting at an incredible 64%. However, he has already missed six games this season and is set to be out for another two to four weeks owing to a calf problem.Also read: Is Giannis Antetokounmpo playing tonight?

Kyler Murray’s foot injury forces Cardinals to evaluate QB future, contract, and trade options



The Arizona Cardinals’ 2025 season has taken a major blow, as star quarterback Kyler Murray will not play again this year. Murray, sidelined since Week 5 with a foot injury sustained against the Tennessee Titans, recently underwent additional testing and sought a second medical opinion. With recovery not progressing as expected, the former No. 1 overall pick’s season is officially over, leaving the Cardinals to reassess their quarterback situation.Head coach Jonathan Gannon provided clarity on Murray’s status during a Friday press conference. “Kyler underwent more tests this week and even went out of state for another opinion,” Gannon said. “Unfortunately, his foot isn’t improving enough for him to return, so he’ll be done for the year.” Gannon expressed disappointment but emphasized that the team’s focus remains on finishing the season strong while evaluating next steps for the franchise.Kyler Murray, the 2019 Heisman Trophy winner and NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year, has delivered standout moments despite battling injuries. He earned Pro Bowl selections in 2020 and 2021 and led the Cardinals to a playoff appearance in 2021. However, consistency has been a challenge, and this latest injury raises questions about his long-term role in Arizona.From a financial perspective, Murray’s contract complicates the Cardinals’ decision-making. He is guaranteed $36.8 million for the 2026 season, with $19.5 million of his 2027 base salary guaranteed if he remains on the roster five days after the new NFL league year begins. Releasing him before June 1 would result in a $57.7 million dead cap hit, while a post-June 1 release lowers the 2026 impact to $50.5 million and adds $7.2 million in 2027. A potential trade could free $35.3 million in salary cap space while only costing $17.9 million in dead money, according to ESPN’s Adam Schefter.With Murray sidelined for the remainder of the season, the Cardinals must make strategic decisions regarding their franchise quarterback. The team will need to weigh options between retaining him long-term or pursuing a trade, with salary cap implications and roster planning playing a critical role in shaping Arizona’s direction for the 2026 season.Also Read: Jayden Daniels injury update: NFL insider Adam Schefter reveals Commanders QB status for Week 14 against Vikings","Kyler murray has been sidelined since week 5 with a foot injury sustained against the tennessee titans.

Magic Johnson backs Austin Reaves after breakout night



Austin Reaves strengthens his All-Star case



The Los Angeles Lakers walked out of Toronto with a tense 123-120 win, yet the biggest story came from one of their most reliable young guards. Austin Reaves delivered the type of performance that shifts a season, lifting a short-handed Lakers squad while also drawing strong support from franchise icon Magic Johnson. The victory mattered, but the night also placed a fresh spotlight on Reaves’ rise as a central figure in the team’s push through the Western Conference standings.The Lakers entered the matchup missing Luka Doncic and saw LeBron James struggle with his shot, ending his long streak of double-digit scoring games. Reaves responded by taking control of the offense and attacking every possession with purpose. His calm playmaking, steady scoring bursts, and late-game poise helped the Lakers survive a Raptors team that had been nearly unbeatable at home.Magic Johnson made his stance clear after watching Reaves dominate the game. The Hall of Famer praised the guard’s leadership in a tough environment and highlighted the impact of his stat line. “Austin Reaves continued his dominant play this season scoring 44 points with 11 assists to lead the Lakers to a 123-120 victory over the Toronto Raptors!” he wrote on X. “Reaves should definitely be playing in the NBA All-Star game this year!”Reaves’ night was built on steady control of the offense, especially in the second half.He scored 30 of his 44 points after the break and attacked Toronto’s defense with a mix of drives, pull-up jumpers and confident threes. The Raptors entered the game with an 8-2 home record and leaned on Scottie Barnes and Brandon Ingram, yet Reaves carried the Lakers in every key stretch.Reaves’ performance adds to a season that already stands out across the league. He is averaging 28.9 points, 6.8 assists and 5.7 rebounds while ranking among the league’s top scorers and most efficient guards. His production without Luka Doncic has been even stronger, with averages of 41.0 points and 10.0 assists in four games.National voices are also taking note. ESPN’s Zach Kram placed Reaves in his “On the Bubble” tier but still projected him to make the final Western Conference group. “If I had to pick the 12 West All-Stars today,” he said, listing Reaves among his selections.Reaves’ role becomes even more valuable when the Lakers face nights like Thursday. James scored eight points and said he focused on “playing the game the right way” after finding Rui Hachimura for the decisive three. The win improved the Lakers to their 16th victory of the season, keeping them near the top of the West.Also Read: LeBron James sacrifices his 1,297-game double-digit streak to deliver the winning assist and lift Lakers past Raptors","Magic johnson says austin reaves should be in the nba all-star game.
