First Indian among world’s top 10 richest women



In 2025, women were no longer the footnote to the big story — they were the story. Across crises and celebrations, ballots and battlefields, podiums and boardrooms, women emerged as the decisive force shaping outcomes and narratives.This year ender traces how women became the X factor of 2025: from the symbolism and steel of Operation Sindoor , to the women voters who once again decided Bihar’s fate; from new women heads of state reshaping global politics, to athletes who carried India’s sporting year; and finally, to a woman who climbed into the world’s richest ranks, redefining economic power.These were not isolated moments. Together, they marked a year when women didn’t just influence events — they changed the balance.A newlywed wife, sitting silently beside her husband’s body — the image that came to define the Pahalgam attack.A terrorist strike. Twenty-six dead. All men.“Go, tell Modi,” a terrorist told a woman after shooting her husband.Operation Sindoor was the response. Its imagery was stark and deliberate — red and black, vermillion smeared like a warning. A symbol of vengeance, resolve, and the state’s answer to terror.""Terrorists dared to wipe 'sindoor' from the foreheads of our sisters; that is why India destroyed the very headquarters of terror,"" PM Modi had said in his first address to the nation after the launch of the operation.The symbolism did not stop at words or posters. It took shape on the world stage when two women officers stepped forward to brief the global media on Operation Sindoor.Their presence was widely seen as intentional messaging — women not just as victims or symbols, but as the face and force of India’s response to terror.Operation Sindoor also saw women in direct combat. In the Akhnoor sector along the IB, a six-member women’s BSF team led by Assistant Commandant Neha Bhandari defended forward posts under sustained Pakistani fire for three days and nights, forcing enemy positions across Sialkot to retreat. For several of the young recruits, it was their first combat test — marking a decisive shift from symbolism to frontline action.Women decided Bihar’s verdict once again, delivering Nitish Kumar a victory that numbers make hard to dispute. While their support for the JD(U)-BJP government’s pro-women agenda has been steady since 2005, this election saw a decisive surge.The turnout told its own story. As many as 71.6% women voted, nearly nine percentage points higher than men, and a sharp rise from 59.7% in 2020.A Rs 10,000 cash transfer to over 1.5 crore women in the run-up to polls acted as a turbo-boost. Like Rakhi after Diwali, the ‘das-hazariya’ payout — along with the mobilisation of Jeevika Didis — became the catalyst for the NDA’s sweeping win.For many women, this loyalty has been shaped over two decades — beginning with schemes like free bicycles for schoolgirls in Nitish Kumar’s first term.In 2010, smiling girls cycling to school became the defining image of his landslide victory, much like women voters have shaped this one.Even contentious policies have found unlikely champions. Prohibition, despite widespread criticism from men, continues to draw strong backing from women, particularly the poor, who often credit it with tangible household benefits.Add to this structural reforms — 35% reservation for women in government jobs, 50% in local bodies, and the expansive Jeevika self-help group network — and the pattern is clear.In Bihar, elections may be fought by parties, but they are increasingly won by women.Across continents in 2025, the ascent of women to the highest political office began to look less like an exception and more like a long-delayed correction. In March, Namibia’s Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah was sworn in as the country’s first woman president. In a region where power has long been shaped by patriarchal traditions, her presidency carries the promise of something deeper: a recalibration of institutional culture, with greater emphasis on accountability, environmental stewardship, and gender-balanced governance.That same shift echoed months later in South America. In July, Suriname elected Jennifer Geerlings-Simons as its first woman president at a moment of economic uncertainty and cautious optimism, driven by newly discovered offshore oil reserves. A physician by training and a respected parliamentary leader, Geerlings-Simons embodies a quieter, steadier form of authority — one rooted in consensus-building and institutional continuity. Her victory underscored an important truth: the gender wave in politics is no longer confined to large economies or global power centres. It is reaching smaller, diverse nations where leadership had remained stubbornly homogeneous for decades.By October, the tremor reached East Asia. Sanae Takaichi’s elevation as Japan’s first female prime minister shattered one of the country’s most enduring political glass ceilings. In a system long dominated by men, her rise signalled a shift not only within party hierarchies but also in public expectations. For Japan, where women’s political representation has historically lagged, Takaichi’s appointment was as much a cultural moment as a political one — a sign that the contours of leadership are slowly expanding, allowing future generations of women to imagine themselves not at the margins of power, but at its very centre.Harmanpreet Kaur, Jemimah Rodrigues, Divya Deshmukh, Sheetal Devi, Nikhat Zareen , Stanzin Dolkar, Anahat Singh and India’s women footballers defined Indian sport in 2025, delivering results that cut across disciplines.The landmark moment came when the Indian women’s cricket team won its first-ever ODI World Cup, that too in front of a home crowd, with Jemimah’s match-winning knock in a pressure semi-final and a controlled final performance sealing a long-awaited title.Beyond cricket, Indian women asserted themselves with authority. Divya Deshmukh became the youngest Women’s World Cup champion in chess, while archer Sheetal Devi added a para-world title and earned selection to the able-bodied compound team purely on scores. In squash, Anahat Singh claimed the national spotlight by winning the SRFI Squash Indian Open, and in boxing, India’s women powered the country to seven of nine gold medals at the World Boxing Cup Finals, led by Nikhat Zareen.Some of the year’s most powerful moments came from inclusive and emerging sport. The Indian Blind Women’s Cricket Team won the inaugural Women’s T20 World Cup for the Blind, while Stanzin Dolkar’s decisive goals earned India its first international bronze in women’s ice hockey. Football completed the surge, with the women’s national team qualifying outright for the AFC Asian Cup for the first time in over two decades, and the U-20 and U-17 sides also sealing continental berths. In 2025, Indian women didn’t just shine — they set the standard.Roshni Nadar scripted history in 2025 by becoming the first Indian woman to break into the world’s top 10 richest women, ranking fifth on the Hurun Global Rich List with a net worth of Rs 3.5 lakh crore ($40 billion).The milestone followed the transfer of a 47% stake in HCL Technologies from her father, Shiv Nadar, firmly establishing her as India’s richest woman and the country’s third-richest individual this year.","In 2025, women were no longer the footnote to the big story — they were the story.

Why would Hall of Fame recognition feel hollow to Alex Rodriguez?

Alex Rodriguez reflects on life changes at age 50 after retiring

Alex Rodriguez built a Hall of Fame level resume with the Seattle Mariners, Texas Rangers, and New York Yankees

Alex Rodriguez is one of those names that still makes baseball fans pause. Not because of what he did on the field, but because of how complicated his legacy became. On paper, his resume screams Hall of Fame. The numbers, the awards, the championships, they all line up perfectly. Yet when Rodriguez talks about Cooperstown now, something surprising comes out. He does not sound bitter. He sounds relieved.In a candid conversation with, Rodriguez admitted that a Hall of Fame plaque might actually leave him feeling empty. That is not something you expect from a player who spent decades chasing greatness. Therapy changed the way he looks at success, validation, and his own past decisions. Instead of viewing the Hall as closure, Rodriguez sees it as something that would not fix the emotional weight he carried for years. This story is not really about baseball anymore. It is about what happens when achievement stops being enough.Rodriguez's thoughts come from some serious self-reflection, thanks to therapy that changed how he sees things. He mentioned feeling like he got ""divorced"" from his Hall of Fame aspirations, saying that the sessions helped him understand his past actions better.In the same interview, Rodriguez elaborated on his therapy experience to Jones, “I’m like, ‘Whoa, what the hell am I doing here? This doesn’t make any sense,’” he recalled initially. But persistence paid off. “But the more I stayed with it, the more it started to really affect me in a positive way. Seeing things in a different way and then looking at my past, definitely not as a victim but understanding some of my behavior and making sure that I’m learning from those behaviors and it never happens again,” Rodriguez added.This growth sheds light on the ""hollow"" feeling he expects from induction. For Rodriguez, getting a plaque in Cooperstown won't wipe away the unresolved inner struggles from his past, including the pressures and decisions that shaped his career. Therapy has helped him focus on emotional healing rather than seeking outside approval, making the Hall seem inadequate in comparison.Rodriguez opened up during a chat with Jason Jones from The Athletic, which came out on December 28, 2025. Now at 50, he looked back on how much his life has changed since he hung up his boots in 2016.""I have a life today that I didn't have for the first 40 years,"" Rodriguez told Jones. He continued, explaining his stance on a potential Hall of Fame plaque: ""If I went to the Hall of Fame, in a weird way, I would be hollow inside. I would still be in a lot of pain.""Rodriguez pointed out his preference for his current state of being. ""I would rather have what I have today, because it really helped me unlock a lot of the work that I needed to do,"" he told Jones. This chat happened during the ongoing talks about his Hall of Fame eligibility, which started back in 2022.Before the scandals, Rodriguez's on-field prowess was unmistakable. He started his career with the Seattle Mariners in 1994 and played through 2016, also donning the jerseys of the Texas Rangers and Yankees.He has a bunch of achievements, like winning the World Series with New York in 2009, snagging three American League MVP awards in 2003, 2005, and 2007, and earning a batting title in 1996 with a .358 average.He also picked up two Gold Glove Awards for shortstop in 2002 and 2003, 10 Silver Slugger Awards, and made it to the All-Star game 14 times. Statistically, he sits at fifth place all-time with 696 home runs and fourth with 2,086 RBIs, plus he has a .295 career batting average.These stats put Rodriguez in a solid spot for first-ballot induction in a PED-free environment, showing his power, defense, and reliability with three different teams.Rodriguez was first considered for the Hall of Fame on the BBWAA ballot in 2022. While his backing has increased a bit, it still falls short of the 75% needed for induction.The 2025 results were revealed on January 21, 2025, showing that he earned 146 votes, or 37.1%, a 2.3 percentage point bump from the previous year, landing him fourth among the returnees. His ballot eligibility will end after 2030. Voters mention PED associations as the key hurdle, based on analyses from Baseball-Reference and MLB.com.Also Read: Ricky Tiedemann injury update: Toronto Blue Jays left-handed pitcher expected to be fully healthy for spring training","Alex rodriguez is one of those names that still makes baseball fans pause.

Myles Garrett earns Chloe Kim’s respect beyond the spotlight

Tired of too many ads? go ad free now

Myles Garrett and Chloe Kim's relationship grew quietly, without attention or hype, built on respect and simply being there for one another. As Kim prepares for another Olympic season, the way she speaks about Garrett shows how much his presence matters in her life.With the 2026 Winter Olympics approaching, Kim is entering one of the most demanding stretches of her career. The offseason, she admits, is the hardest part mentally. Anxiety creeps in before competition begins. Amid that pressure, she finds grounding in people who truly see her. That includes Garrett, whose work ethic and character have left a deep impression on her.Chloe Kim spoke candidly about how little she knew of Garrett before they met. “I grew up in a very Korean household, so we didn’t really watch American sports, or sports in general,” she said. Her sports knowledge was limited. “Like I know Tom Brady and LeBron James. That’s my extent, that’s all I know.” What started without expectations has grown into genuine admiration..What stands out to Chloe Kim is not Garrett’s accolades, but who he is away from cameras. “Honestly, Myles is such an incredible athlete,” she said. “I’m constantly inspired and in awe of him and how hard he works and how incredibly kind he is.” That balance matters to her. Kindness, she emphasized, is not performative. “He genuinely is one of the kindest people I think I’ve ever met.”For Kim, who has openly discussed years of mental health struggles, that steadiness carries weight. She described how pressure built over time, eventually forcing her to confront her limits through intensive therapy after the 2022 Olympics. The support systems around her now feel clearer.Her appreciation for Garrett reflects that shift. “I’m really lucky to be part of his life and lucky that he’s part of mine,” Kim said. “Yeah, we’re happy.” The words are simple, but they land with honesty.As Kim returns to competition, she carries lessons learned the hard way. Confidence does not mean fear disappears. It means knowing who stands beside you when it shows up. For Chloe Kim, Myles Garrett represents that presence that is quiet, supportive and steady.Also Read: Who is Myles Garrett’s girlfriend Chloe Kim?

Can Virat Kohli chase down Sachin Tendulkar's hundred hundreds?

India vice-captain Smriti Mandhana joined an elite club on Sunday, becoming only the second Indian woman after Mithali Raj and the fastest ever to surpass 10,000 international runs.Smriti, who made her India debut against Bangladesh in April 2013, needed 27 runs to reach the milestone in the fourth T20I against Sri Lanka at the Greenfield International Stadium in Thiruvananthapuram. She achieved it in just 20 balls and went on to score a brilliant 80 off 48 deliveries, hitting 11 fours and three sixes at a strike rate of 170.2, marking her 32nd fifty in international cricket.With this achievement, Smriti joins New Zealand’s Suzie Bates and former England captain Charlotte Edwards as the only other women to cross 10,000 international runs.Her career statistics are equally impressive: 629 runs in seven Tests, 5,322 runs in 117 ODIs, and the chance to surpass Mithali Raj’s all-time record of 10,868 international runs. Smriti had already etched her name in T20I history, becoming the first Indian and second overall after Suzie Bates to reach 4,000 runs in Women’s T20Is during the series opener against Sri Lanka in Visakhapatnam.The left-handed opener was also a key figure in India’s victorious Women’s ODI World Cup campaign, scoring 434 runs in nine innings at an average of 54.25. She finished 2025 as the highest run-scorer in ODIs, amassing 1,362 runs across 23 innings, including five fifties and five centuries.Smriti also became the first Indian woman to score a century in all three formats of the game.After the five-match T20I series concludes on December 30, Smriti will lead Royal Challengers Bengaluru in the 2026 Women’s Premier League, which kicks off on January 9. RCB will face Harmanpreet Kaur’s Mumbai Indians in the opening match at DY Patil Stadium, Navi Mumbai.","Smriti mandhana becomes only the second indian woman after mithali raj and the fastest ever to surpass 10,000 international runs.

Tyler O’Neill's record-setting opening day blast

Cameron Meisner's walk-off first career homer

Eugenio Suárez's four-homer onslaught

Cal Raleigh 's record-shattering 60th homer

Shohei Ohtani 's franchise-record 55th home run

The‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌ 2025 MLB season is likely to be recalled more as a collection of moments where one player's swing changed the whole narrative. Certain home runs didn't just win the games; they shifted the momentum, gave trust to the decisions of the line-ups, and even upended the traditional views about the players' capacities.O’Neill’s home run on the opening day set a tone that, at the highest level, consistent performance is rarely a matter of luck. Meisner’s walk-off illustrated that sometimes, a player who is only a benchwarmer can have the moment of their life. Suárez’s four home run game was a testament to how little changes in one's style can result in peak-level performance extremely ‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌fast.The 2025 baseball season kicked off with a memorable event. Boston Red Sox outfielder Tyler O’Neill smashed a home run on Opening Day for the sixth consecutive year. This time, he achieved it in his home country of Canada, playing in Toronto against the Blue Jays. The opposite-field blast to right field left the local fans in shock and excited Red Sox supporters all around.ESPN announcer Joe Buck really nailed the excitement during the broadcast, yelling that O’Neill had once again come through on Opening Day.His streak, which kicked off in 2020, is one of a kind in Major League Baseball history. No other player has ever hit a home run in six consecutive season openers.The home run was off a hanging slider and showcased O’Neill’s knack for clutch hitting. He wrapped up the 2024 season with a .285 batting average and 28 home runs, and this shot gave Boston a strong start in a season where they made a deep playoff run.On April 5, 2025, rookie Cameron Meisner gave Tampa Bay Rays fans a moment to cherish. With the team down 3–2 against the Baltimore Orioles in the ninth inning, the 23-year-old took his turn and smashed the very first pitch he faced into right field. That walk-off home run turned the score to 3–2 in favor of the Rays, igniting a wild celebration among the 18,000 fans at Tropicana Field.It was Meisner's first career home run, which made the moment even more intense. Broadcaster Dewayne Staats exclaimed that the rookie had ""wrapped this one up in dramatic style,"" perfectly capturing the crowd's shock and excitement.Meisner had just made his debut, coming off a pretty average spring training, but this swing immediately put him in the spotlight. He ended up hitting 12 home runs and driving in 48 runs that season, although this walk-off was the only one he had all year. The win also ignited a hot streak for Tampa, who went on to win seven out of their next 10 games.On May 18, 2025, Eugenio Suárez playing against the Colorado Rockies at Chase Field, the 33-year-old tied the game several times and led Arizona to a thrilling 12–8 comeback victory.Suárez hit three consecutive home runs early in the game and then added a fourth in the seventh inning. All of his homers came from poorly thrown pitches, showcasing his knack for capitalizing on mistakes.This was a historic moment only the 19th instance in Major League Baseball history where a player has hit four homers in one game, and just the second time for a Diamondback, the first being J.D. Martinez in 2017.Broadcasters were all about the excitement as the home runs kept coming, with Greg Schulte expressing his shock after Suárez hit his third and fourth homers. Fans at Chase Field got to see a record-tying show of strength that quickly became a part of Diamondbacks history.Suárez attributed his success to some changes he made to his swing during the offseason. By the middle of the season, he was leading the National League with 34 home runs, just trailing his teammate Corbin Carroll in the hunt for the league's top spot.His impressive performance contributed to Arizona's 92 wins and a Wild Card playoff berth, while also earning Suárez his third All-Star nod.On‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌ September 15, 2025, Cal Raleigh, the catcher for the Seattle Mariners, made baseball history. He hit his 60th home run of the season, a three-run shot off of the Kansas City Royals' pitcher, going beyond Johnny Bench's record for catchers. This moment went down during a 7-4 win and crowned Raleigh the AL MVP.Cal Raleigh's show in baseball was gorgeous from start to finish. Before the All-Star break, he had already hammered 38 home runs; in addition, he had 8 games where he went deep twice. Furthermore, he proved to be very consistent as he caught more than 1,200 innings. Witnessing his power was something that not only players but fans got to relish at the same time.The announcers couldn't contain their excitement as they called his 60th homer ""an MVP moment."" His 50th and 55th home runs had already left the records for catchers and switch-hitters shattered, so with his latest one, he became an indelible part of baseball history.Raleigh, who was first drafted in the fourth round in 2018, sees this milestone as the culmination of years of steady growth. Besides changing the record books, his sparkling performance injected enthusiasm among the Mariners in their run to the AL West division title.Raleigh was just simply amazing in having brought the power in the catcher position unheard of before. It takes tremendous strength, stamina, and perfect timing to be able to do what Raleigh has sadly setting the new floor of expectations in the ‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌field.On October 29, 2025, Shohei Ohtani created one of the most unforgettable moments in baseball history. In Game 7 of the World Series at Dodger Stadium, he hit his 55th home run of the season during the 11th inning, leading the Los Angeles Dodgers to a 5–4 walk-off victory against the Houston Astros and securing their eighth championship.This homer not only broke his own single-season home run record for the team but also capped off a year where he struck out 200 batters as a pitcher.Earlier in the series, Ohtani had already hit three home runs, including two in Game 3, showcasing his dominance on the grandest stage. Broadcasters referred to his 55th homer as “a record-breaking moment,” while analysts were in awe of his knack for hitting tough pitches with impeccable timing.The postseason was packed with highlights for Ohtani: a leadoff homer in Game 1, a three-homer game in another matchup, and numerous clutch hits that kept the Dodgers in the hunt. His blend of power hitting and top-notch pitching earned him the National League MVP award unanimously.For fans, Ohtani’s season was about more than just stats. His 55 home runs and 25 pitching wins demonstrated that he is a once-in-a-generation talent, changing the way we view a single player’s impact on a team.Also Read: Alex Rodriguez says baseball Hall of Fame recognition would feel hollow despite 696 home runs for surprising reason","The 2025 baseball season kicked off with a memorable event.

Pelicans- Suns fight fallout shapes aftermath of New Orleans loss



The NBA finally addressed the heated moment that crossed the line during Saturday night’s Pelicans-Suns matchup in New Orleans. It started as a tense, physical game turned chaotic in the third quarter, forcing officials to eject two players and shift the spotlight away from the score. The league’s response arrived later, confirming discipline for both sides involved in the altercation.The incident occurred during Phoenix’s 123–114 win at the Smoothie King Center. It was a game that completed a back-to-back set between the teams. Amid the intense game, a routine defensive sequence spiraled into an ugly exchange that demanded league intervention. But not without consequences.ESPN’s Shams Charania shared that the NBA is taking strict action against Jose Alvarado and Mark Williams. “The NBA is suspending New Orleans Pelicans guard Jose Alvarado for two games and Phoenix Suns center Mark Williams for one game after their fight Saturday night, sources tell ESPN,” senior NBA insider Charania shared on X.The fight occurred late in the third quarter near midcourt. As Suns guard Collin Gillespie moved off the ball, Williams stepped in to set a screen. Alvarado fought aggressively through the contact and was called for a foul.Moments later, Williams shoved Alvarado from behind, triggering a face-to-face confrontation. The exchange escalated quickly as both players threw right hands before teammates and officials rushed in. Referees ejected both players immediately.Neither Alvarado nor Williams spoke to the media after the game. Suns head coach Jordan Ott acknowledged the moment without assigning blame, pointing to the strain of the schedule.“I saw it start, and then all of a sudden everyone jumped in,” Ott said. “Second night of a back-to-back, lack of sleep — something always tends to happen. They got tangled up, and obviously, they both got thrown out.”Despite the disruption, Phoenix maintained control on the floor. Williams finished with 10 points and eight rebounds in only 11 minutes before his ejection. Devin Booker led the Suns with 20 points, while Royce O’Neale highlighted the collective effort required to close out the win.“Yesterday was a dog fight, and today was a dog fight,” O’Neale said. “It took everybody to get this win.”For New Orleans, the loss dropped the Pelicans to 8–25. Alvarado ended his night with seven points and two steals, while Trey Murphy III paced the team with 24 points, including six three-pointers.The suspensions now remove two rotation players from upcoming games as both teams press forward. Phoenix continues its road trip against Washington, while New Orleans prepares for a home matchup with New York.Also Read: “It’s disrespectful”: Giannis Antetokounmpo snaps at reporter after blunt question about his future in Milwaukee",Phoenix suns center mark williams and new orleans pelicans guard jose alvarado were ejected in the third quarter of saturday's game.

In NBA, the action doesn't stop at the hardwood. While the athletes provide the high-flying dunks and clutch threes, the front row seats provide culture. Courtside seats have become the ultimate status symbol, offering an elite experience to the cream of the crop. In 2017, a buyer paid $133K, booking two floor seats for the NBA finals Game 5 between the Warriors and Cavaliers.These aren't just casual observers looking for a photo op, they are ""superfans"" who schedule filming around the playoffs, engage in psychological warfare with opposing guards, and, in some cases, hold official titles within the front office. They range from the legendary Hollywood stars, business tycoons, and musical icons. As we look at the landscape in late 2025, these six faces remain the pillars of NBA fandom.Jack Nicholson remains the undisputed celebrity superfan. ""Grandfather of Courtside."" While 2025 has seen the 88-year-old legend become more selective with his appearances, the Crypto.com Arena still feels different when Jack is in his signature seat near the visiting bench.Wearing his trademark sunglasses indoors, Nicholson has been a consistent ticket holder since the 1970s, and his love and dedication for Lakers was shown through his ""no filming during Lakers home games"" clause in his movie contracts.Spike Lee’s love for the Knicks stemmed from his younger days when his father, Bill, would take him to watch the NBA games at the third Madison Square Garden, before its demolition in 1968. He also witnessed the 1970s decider Game 7 between Lakers and Knicks, where the Knicks won by 113-99 and the NBA championship by 4-3.Lee was often seen on the courtside, decked in orange and blue with custom sneakers and sunglasses. He doesn't just watch the game, he officiates it from the sidelines, along with his legendary “trash talking” that once riled up legends like Reggie Miller and now the younger players are subjected to it.Drake took his love for the Toronto Raptors to another level when he became their Global Ambassador. He has his ""OVO"" branded on Raptors’ team gear, practice facility, and exclusive collaboration with Lakers, Celtics, Bulls, and Knicks, blending sports, music, and fashion. Whether he’s playfully lint-rolling his pants or getting a technical foul or being warned about “the use of bad language,” Drake isn’t just another super fan, he has made Toronto the NBA’s coolest northern outpost.You might not know his name, but you’ve seen the textured hat. With his signature python skin outfits and long silver hair, Goldstein is the only fan on this list who doesn't claim a team. Instead, he’s a fan of the game. Attending 100 games per season, Goldstein spends a fortune on travel and tickets to ensure he has the best view of the league's history as it happens.Standing as the loudest ""little man"" in Philly, Kevin Hart is the only person to win four straight NBA Celebrity All-Star Game MVP (2012-2015). For Hart, every Sixers game is like a stand-up special, filled with his notorious chirping at superstars like Jimmy Butler and Draymond Green, often resulting in hilarious mid-game exchanges.Hart’s role expanded even further when he became the first-ever-on-court emcee for the 2024-25 NBA All-Star Game.The 2011 Hall of Famer has become the Lakers' most high-profile protector. Since moving his Club Shay Shay brand to LA, Sharpe’s courtside presence has become a viral event in itself. Whether he’s getting into heated debates with the Memphis Grizzlies' bench or dapping up Anthony Davis, Sharpe brings a former athlete’s intensity to the front row that few other celebrities can match.Also read: 5 headline grabbing and most talked about controversial moments in NBA in 2025","Jack nicholson remains the undisputed celebrity superfan.

(With inputs from AFP)

NEW DELHI: A total of 20 wickets tumbled on the opening day of the fourth Test between Australia and England at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) on Friday, with Australia bowled out for 152 before dismissing England for just 110.The dramatic collapse on both sides sparked concern within Cricket Australia, with chief executive Todd Greenberg warning that shortened Tests were bad for business, even as several of the biggest names in the game criticised the condition of the MCG pitch.It was the highest number of wickets to fall on the first day of an Ashes Test since 1909, following the 19 wickets that fell on day one of the series opener in Perth.That match ended inside two days, costing Cricket Australia millions of dollars in lost revenue, and the Melbourne Test is also shaping up as a potential financial blow for the governing body.""I didn't sleep well last night, put it that way,"" Greenberg said on SEN radio after more than 94,000 packed into the MCG for Friday's first day.""It was an amazing day of Test cricket, so for that record number of people who were here, boy, they've had an experience.""But our challenge is to make sure we can continue those experiences day after day. That's the challenge for all of us.""The Melbourne pitch was prepared with 10 millimetres of grass on the wicket, making it heavily favourable for the bowlers with plenty of movement and bounce under overcast skies.Greenberg said a trend towards shorter Test matches was not in Cricket Australia's interest.""A simple phrase I'd use is short Tests are bad for business. I can't be much more blunt than that,"" he said.""So I would like to see a slightly broader balance between the bat and the ball.""A host of former greats have been critical of the Melbourne pitch with former England captain Michael Vaughan on Saturday calling it ""a joke"".""This is selling the game short,"" he added, while another ex-England skipper Alastair Cook branded it ""an unfair contest"".Curators in Australia are traditionally independent when it comes to preparing pitches, both from captains and Cricket Australia.Greenberg suggested a more interventionist approach might be needed.""It's hard not to get more involved when you see the impact on the sport, especially commercially, he said.""I'm not suggesting I'll go around talking to ground staff, but we do have to have a careful eye on what our expectations are over the course of a summer.""",A total of 20 wickets tumbled on the opening day of the fourth test between australia and england at the melbourne cricket ground (mcg) on friday.

Brief scores

BENGALURU: Age, they say, is merely a number. For proof, look no further than Virat Kohli The former India captain, who turned 37 last month, continues to defy the passage of time. With the bat, he still makes prolific youngsters look ordinary. In the field, his energy and intensity can outdo even the quickest. On Friday, at the BCCI Centre of Excellence here, it was vintage Kohli once again — only the opposition had changed.Less than 48 hours after opening Delhi’s Vijay Hazare Trophy campaign with a century against Andhra, Kohli returned to the middle, this time against Gujarat. Though he fell short of another three-figure score, stumped on 77 (61b; 13x4;1x6), his 81-minute stay at the crease was unmistakably Kohli — authoritative and brimming with control.His innings, combined with a mature knock from Rishabh Pant (70), laid the foundation for Delhi’s thrilling seven-run win. Fittingly, Kohli — who was scheduled to feature in only two matches — signed off from the tournament by pouching the winning catch, dismissing Ravi Bishnoi as Delhi sealed the contest. He was also named the man of the match.Asked to bat, Delhi posted a competitive 254/9 on a testing surface before bowling out Gujarat for 247 in 47.4 overs.At 213/6 in the 42nd over, Gujarat appeared to be in control, but a dramatic 47th over, which yielded two quick wickets, swung the momentum. As the chase tightened, Prince Yadav (3/37) delivered the final blow to close out the game.Earlier, Kohli was forced into action early after Chintan Gaja sent Priyansh Arya back in the second over. From then on, Kohli assumed command, dealing largely in boundaries. He looked in sublime touch, and a trademark on-drive off Arzan Nagwaswalla in the seventh over stood out as one of the shots of the day. The introduction of leg-spinner Bishnoi coincided with Kohli’s half-century, which he brought up in just 29 balls by slashing through the covers for four.Imperious and seemingly unstoppable, Kohli’s stay ended when he went down the track to left-arm spinner Vishal Jayswal (4/42) and missed, allowing wicketkeeper Urvil Patel to whip off the bails in a flash.At the other end, Pant, who last played an ODI in Aug last year, shelved his usual aggression for caution. Walking in with Delhi at 98/3, Pant focused on rebuilding. His half-century off 62 balls was highlighted by a clean strike off Bishnoi over long-on. His resistance ended on 70 (79 balls; 8 fours, 2 sixes) when he dropped to one knee to work Jayswal on the leg side, only to miss and see his stumps disturbed.Delhi: 254/9 in 50 overs (Virat Kohli 77, Rishabh Pant 70, Harsh Tyagi 40; Ravi Bishnoi 2-50, Vishal Jayswal 4-42)beats Gujarat: 247 in 47.4 overs (Aarya Desai 57, Urvil Patel 31, Abhishek Desai 26, Saurav Chauhan 49, Jayswal 26; Ishant Sharma 2-28, Prince Yadav 3-37, Arpit Rana 2-39)",Virat kohli scores 77 as delhi beat gujarat by seven runs in vijay hazare trophy.

Kylie Jenner and Jordyn Woods' relationship from scandal to sisterhood

The beef between celebrities often gets stretched for decades, but not for the makeup mogul, Kylie Jenner . The young billionaire just showed that mistakes made in the past should remain there, and one should move forward with the years.When Jordyn Woods announced her engagement to New York Knicks’ Karl-Anthony Towns, the first thing the internet did was scan the comments for a reaction from her former bestie. And guess what? Kylie Jenner didn’t disappoint. Her comment painted over all the buzz around her and Wood’s relations since the scandal on Keeping Up with the Kardashians.KAT has been Wood’s rock in one of her toughest times when the internet collectively went against her over the scandal, and seeing them finally locking each other for life seems earned.Jordyn Woods, via her Instagram on Christmas Day, dropped a series of images showing KAT’s proposal, and captioned it as “Merry Christmas.”The proposal looked straight out of a romance movie as the NBA star, Karl-Anthony Towns, seemed to pull out all the stops from selecting the historic Chateau de Vaux-le-Vicomte as the proposal venue to surprising Jordyn with a massive diamond. A setting truly fit for royalty.The duo has known each each for a long time but didn’t begin dating until May 2020.That September, Jordyn told Extra, “The right person will bring a lot out of you. We have been friends for a long time. Naturally, we both connected about losing a parent at a very young age … so it was a very organic relationship that we’d been best friends for a while.”From Bella Hadid to the Olympic gold medalist, Simone Biles, multiple celebrities reacted to this post with heartfelt congratulatory messages and blessings. But what grabbed the netizens’ eyes was Kylie Jenner’s name amongst these.Jenner commented, “jordyyyyyyy” followed by a series of ""crying"" emojis. It was a moment that officially signaled the end of any lingering tension between the friends. Jordyn’s sister, Jodie, also commented, “The most deserving woman, so proud of both of you this is EVERYTHING.”Kylie Jenner’s comment might seem to some as a friend being happy for their friend, but the history behind these two makes this moment much more special. After a decade of friendship, the duo hit a rocky road in 2019 when Woods and Tristan Thompson’s were caught in a scandal during the filming of KUWTK, while the latter was dating Kylie’s sister Khloe Kardashian Following the nature of the reality show, the fallout was messy and heartbreaking while it got broadcast across the globe. It headlined the entertainment tabloids for years. However, it seems like time is truly a healing medicine. In 2023, Kylie and Jordyn were seen grabbing sushi, signaling the reconciliation. By celebrating Jordyn’s engagement today, Kylie is proving that they’ve traded the old drama for a supportive and mature friendship as it turns out that even the most complicated histories can have a happy ending.Also Read: “I’m ready to get home” — Stephen Curry shares heartfelt message for wife Ayesha Curry following Christma","Jordyn woods announced her engagement to new york knicks’ karl-anthony towns.

If I get the opportunity, I’m going to prepare the same way and give it my best.”The Cowboys enter Week 18 with a 7-8-1 record, officially eliminated from postseason contention. Expectations were far higher at the start of the year, but inconsistency on both sides of the ball - combined with injuries and defensive lapses, derailed Dallas’ playoff push.Despite the bigger picture, Prescott views the regular-season finale as more than a formality. Finishing strong, especially in a divisional matchup, still carries meaning for a locker room searching for momentum heading into the offseason.“There’s pride in that,” Prescott added. “I want to win. I want to be out there with my guys.”The Christmas Day victory came at a physical cost. Prescott was sacked six times by Washington and absorbed repeated hits behind an offensive line that struggled in the second half.Even so, he finished with 307 passing yards, two touchdowns, and no interceptions, a performance that reinforced his value to the offense.Teammates were quick to rally around their quarterback, praising his toughness and leadership. Running back Javonte Williams publicly called out protection issues while commending Prescott for playing through the punishment.Head coach Brian Schottenheimer has so far echoed Prescott’s mindset, indicating that the plan remains to start the franchise quarterback in the finale. Still, with the offseason looming, the Cowboys must weigh long-term health against short-term morale.A late injury would be catastrophic for a team already facing hard questions about roster construction, coaching continuity, and overall direction.Dallas will close its season on the road against the New York Giants, offering Prescott a final chance to set a tone before months of uncertainty. Whether the Cowboys finish strong won’t change their playoff fate, but it could influence how the offseason conversation begins.For Prescott, the message is simple: seasons don’t end quietly, even when the playoffs are out of reach. As the Cowboys limp toward January, their quarterback has drawn his line, and he intends to cross it on the field.",Dak prescott intends to play in the dallas cowboys' season finale. The cowboys are out of the playoffs and face the new york giants on sunday. Head coach brian schottenheimer has so far indicated that the plan remains to start prescott in the finale.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126192836,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1419003,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

Tampa Bay Lightning forward Scott Sabourin ruled out after taking Arber Xhekaj in fist fight,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/tampa-bay-lightning-forward-scott-sabourin-ruled-out-after-taking-arber-xhekaj-in-fist-fight/articleshow/126223622.cms,"(Image Source - Getty Images)

How Scott Sabourin initiated the fight by challenging Montreal Canadiens defenseman

The brawl between Scott Sabourin and Arber Xhekaj wasn’t something that just happened out of nowhere. It was a consequence of a game that quickly went out of Tampa Bay’s control. Playing on the second night of a back-to-back, the Lightning were slow to start, while the Montreal Canadiens were on the attack, outshooting Tampa Bay 11-3 and setting the physical tone. Sabourin, coming off a game filled with penalties against the Florida Panthers less than a day earlier, stepped in to try and turn things around.Later footage from the broadcast showed that Sabourin kicked off the exchange by verbally challenging Xhekaj while Montreal kept the pressure on. This was the second time these teams faced off this season, and the Canadiens were keen to bounce back after losing the first game. Given that Tampa Bay was still feeling the impact of a night with 136 penalty minutes, the fight was a strategic move to shift momentum rather than a moment of emotional weakness.The fight broke out at 16:46 in the first period, leading to both players getting five-minute major penalties for fighting. Sabourin, a 33-year-old tough guy famous for his aggressive style, kicked things off by dropping his gloves and calling out Xhekaj, the 6-foot-4 defenseman from the Canadiens known for his fighting skills.In the video, we can see Xhekaj taking a few early hits from Sabourin before he lands a powerful right hook to the chin. That punch knocked Sabourin down face-first onto the ice, and he stayed there for a bit without moving. The officials quickly came to help the Lightning player as he wobbled his way to the tunnel, clearly shaken up by the hit.Sabourin, who had only played 2:20 of ice time before the fight, didn't come back for the second period and was officially declared out by the Lightning soon after the third period started. The Tampa Bay team shared his status in an update on X, just saying that Sabourin wouldn't be returning because of the incident.As Sabourin went down, Xhekaj showed some real sportsmanship by quickly waving to the Lightning bench and calling for medical help. Habs beat reporter Anthony Martineau, who was covering the game for All Habs, shared his thoughts on the moment, ""A crushing right hand from Xhekaj.Sabourin collapses. Xhekaj immediately signals to the Lightning's medical staff. The players respect each other. Great to see. This is truly not an easy job."" Xhekaj's call for help underscored the mutual respect between combatants, even in the heat of battle.Also Read: “Don’t even start”: John Tortorella shuts down NHL comeback rumors linked to Buffalo Sabres",Tampa bay lightning's scott sabourin and montreal canadiens' arber xhekaj got into a fight in the first period.
