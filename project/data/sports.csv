Bill Belichick returns to TV as ESPN adds him to national title broadcast

Bill Belichick is back on television. Just weeks after finishing a difficult first college football season at the University of North Carolina, the 73-year-old coaching legend has landed a new role with ESPN. The network confirmed that Bill Belichick will appear on the ACC Network’s broadcast of the College Football Playoff national championship game, set to be played in South Florida at Hard Rock Stadium.The game will feature the Indiana Hoosiers against the University of Miami Hurricanes and is scheduled for a 7:30 p.m. kickoff. ESPN announced that Belichick will be part of the on-air team, marking his return to TV while he continues working as head coach of the Tar Heels in Chapel Hill.ESPN said Bill Belichick will be paired with former Miami and Georgia head coach Mark Richt for the ACC Network’s coverage.The move comes only weeks after North Carolina ended a rough season with a 4–8 record, missing both a bowl game and the expanded College Football Playoff.Belichick became North Carolina’s head coach in 2025, taking his first job at the college level after leaving the New England Patriots following the 2024 NFL season.Before going to Chapel Hill, he spent months on television. He appeared on “Monday Night Football’s ManningCast” with Peyton Manning and Eli Manning and also made regular appearances on The Pat McAfee Show.Now, Bill Belichick is mixing both worlds. He is still leading North Carolina’s rebuild, but he is also stepping back into the media spotlight.ESPN’s announcement said the move brings “one of football’s greatest minds” back to the broadcast booth.Bill Belichick is the only head coach in NFL history to win six Super Bowls with one team. He also won two more Super Bowls as a defensive coordinator with the New York Giants.While returning to television, Bill Belichick has stayed busy on the recruiting trail. One of his biggest recent moves was bringing in quarterback Billy Edwards Jr. to Chapel Hill.ESPN’s Pete Thamel reported that Edwards chose North Carolina after being granted a medical redshirt, giving him one more year of college eligibility.Billy Edwards Jr., a Virginia native, transferred to Wisconsin in August 2025 after playing at Maryland.He later suffered a knee injury and missed the rest of the season. Now, he will compete with Gio Lopez for the Tar Heels’ starting job.He will also work under Belichick and new offensive coordinator Bobby Petrino, another longtime NFL coach.The addition matters for a North Carolina team that struggled badly. The Tar Heels beat only two Power Four teams, Syracuse and Stanford, during the 2025 season.Off the field, Belichick has also faced attention around his personal life, including heavy media focus on his relationship with Jordon Hudson.Despite the noise, sources around the program say Belichick has stayed locked in on recruiting and player development.North Carolina will next hold its spring game on April 12 at Kenan Stadium, where fans will get their first look at the new roster.","Bill belichick will appear on the acc network’s broadcast of the college football playoff national championship game.

The Miami Heat visit the Golden State Warriors on January 19, 2026, for a matchup that carries weight for both teams as the season moves deeper. The game will be played at Chase Center, where Golden State has been steady, while Miami continues a challenging road stretch.Both teams are dealing with injuries that affect rotation decisions and game planning. Several key players are either out or not fully cleared, which puts more responsibility on the healthy core and forces adjustments on both sides.Miami Heat’s backcourt is short-handed. Tyler Herro is out with a rib injury and did not travel with the team. His absence removes one of Miami’s main scoring options and limits spacing on offense.Jaime Jaquez Jr. is questionable with a left knee sprain. When available, he has averaged 15.9 points and provided balance on both ends of the floor. Davion Mitchell is also questionable due to a left shoulder contusion, leaving Miami thin at guard.With those concerns, Miami is expected to rely heavily on Bam Adebayo and Norman Powell. Adebayo continues to be a steady presence inside, averaging 17 points and nine rebounds.Powell has been the team’s most consistent scorer at 23.8 points per game and will likely see extended usage.Golden State Warriors is also missing rotation pieces. De’Anthony Melton remains out as he manages his left knee following ACL surgery. Gui Santos will miss his second straight game with a left ankle sprain. Seth Curry is still sidelined due to left sciatic nerve irritation.Draymond Green is listed as probable with a right ankle sprain. His status matters, as his defense and decision-making affect how Golden State controls the game. Stephen Curry is available and expected to lead the offense as usual.Without Herro, Miami’s offense will depend more on Butler and Powell creating shots against pressure defense. Ball movement and defensive stops will be key if the Heat want to stay close.Golden State, sitting at 24–19, will lean on home court and shooting. The Warriors are favored by 5.5 points, with the total set at 239.5. If Green plays, Golden State gains an edge defensively. If not, the game could stay tight.Also read: Is Stephen Curry playing tonight vs the Miami Heat? Latest update on the Golden State Warriors star's injury report (January 19, 2026) With injuries shaping both rotations, the game is likely decided by execution and depth rather than lineup strength alone.

Global heavyweights chasing the crown

When the debate over the Greatest of All Time erupts in day-to-day conversation and on social media, it usually revolves around rings, MVPs, and clutch shots. However, the financial rankings from Celebrity Net Worth have settled a different kind of GOAT debate: the one happening in the bank. NBA legend Michael Jordan has officially topped the list of the world's richest athletes with a net worth surging past $3 billion, cementing his status as a global sports giant. Other international icons have also made an appearance in the top 10, but the NBA's presence is a testament to how basketball has transcended the rectangle and has become one of the most lucrative businesses.As per Celebrity Net Worth, Michael Jordan currently sits at an estimated net worth of $3.5 billion, making him the richest sportsman in the world. But this staggering wealth didn’t just come from his legendary NBA career but is the result of a masterclass in marketing and brand building. From his multi-billion-dollar Jordan Brand under Nike to selling the Charlotte Hornets for approximately $3 billion, Michael Jordan has set a blueprint that would be tough to replicate.But he isn't alone in the Top 10, though. LeBron James also sits comfortably at 8th as the only active NBA player in the top tier with a net worth of $1.2 billion.His off-court ventures include the SpringHill Company and strategic stakes in sports teams like Liverpool FC. Also joining this list at 9 is Magic Johnson, whose Magic Johnson Enterprises has turned him into a $1 billion mogul. When you look at the Top 10, the NBA’s trio, Jordan, LeBron, and Magic, highlights a specific trend: basketball stars are evolving into venture capitalists faster than they can hit a step-back three.While the NBA royalty holds the crown, the rest of the Top 10 is a battlefield of global icons. Names like Cristiano Ronaldo (5th) and Lionel Messi (7th) represent the massive football (soccer) economy, both hovering around the $1.2 billion to $850 million mark. Ending the top 10 is Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson with a staggering $800 million net worth.The disparity at the very top is what’s truly shocking. Jordan’s $3.5 billion valuation puts him in a level of his own, showcasing how brand power can help you reach the billionaire’s club long after you have bid goodbye to the hardwood.","Nba legend michael jordan has officially topped the list of the world's richest athletes with a net worth surging past $3 billion.

What happened to Patrick Mahomes?

Why experts want the Chiefs to slow down

Patrick Mahomes needs to 'temper expectations' with injury comeback | Pro Football Talk | NFL on NBC

Patrick Mahomes’ recovery from a serious knee injury has become one of the biggest stories of the NFL right now. The Kansas City Chiefs quarterback tore both his ACL and LCL late in the 2025 season and had surgery in December. While Mahomes hopes to return for Week 1 of the 2026 season, many experts believe the team should not rush his comeback.With the Chiefs entering a crucial rebuilding phase after missing the playoffs, the decision around Mahomes’ recovery timeline could shape their entire season.Mahomes suffered the injury in Week 15 against the Los Angeles Chargers. While trying to extend a play, he was hit and his left knee bent awkwardly. He needed help leaving the field, and later scans confirmed torn ACL and LCL ligaments.The injury ended his season and marked the first major long-term injury of his NFL career. Kansas City finished the year with a disappointing record and failed to make the playoffs for the first time since 2014.Mahomes underwent surgery in mid-December and has been rehabbing under the supervision of the team’s medical staff. Despite the seriousness of the injury, Mahomes remains confident.In a recent update, he said doctors believe he could be ready for the season opener.“I want to be ready for Week 1,” Mahomes said during a Zoom call. “That’s the goal to play with no restrictions.”He added that he hopes to take part in offseason workouts and training camp if his recovery continues to go well.Not everyone agrees with Mahomes’ timeline. Pro Football Talk’s Mike Florio has urged caution, saying that returning quickly from a late-season ACL tear is very difficult.Florio explained that Mahomes’ playing style makes the situation even riskier. Unlike many quarterbacks, Mahomes relies heavily on movement, scrambling, quick cuts, and throwing on the run. All of this puts extra pressure on the knee.“You want to be very sure that knee is fully healthy before he starts doing all those special things again,” Florio said.Michael Holley also warned that Mahomes is the kind of player who will try to push himself back early, even if he is not fully ready. Because of this, he believes the Chiefs must protect their star quarterback.For the Chiefs, the bigger concern is not just getting Mahomes back on the field, but making sure he is fully fit for the long term. Kansas City missed the playoffs for the first time since 2014, and the 2026 season is seen as a reset year for the team. Rushing Mahomes back too soon could risk another injury and hurt their future plans.For now, Mahomes remains positive and focused on rehab. But the message from experts is clear: patience may be the smartest move. The Chiefs’ success depends not just on Mahomes returning quickly, but on him returning healthy.","Patrick mahomes tore his acl and lcl late in the 2025 season.

According to league watchers and the news circulating, the management is now in the process of determining which players belong in the long-term vision of the organization. There are two players, especially, whose on-ice production and increasing significance within the team make them stand out.Viktor Arvidsson is the name that comes up often when people talk about the potential players to be traded from the Boston Bruins. The 30-year-old winger has made his way into the top six quietly and has been nothing but a dependable asset. So far, in 37 games this season, he has scored 11 goals and made 25 points and has a plus-10.Besides, he is currently enjoying a terrific stint with a point streak stretched to seven games, which consists of four goals and four assists. This period marks an offensive flow and good cooperation with the team’s main strikers. People in the league think that the veteran's support and regularity will be a good reason for the Bruins to keep him if the conditions are right.The player with the most potential among the impenetrable options is Alex Steeves. Initially, he was considered only as a minor addition to the roster, but soon the perception changed dramatically. So far, in 32 matches with the Boston team, the left winger has scored eight goals and made 14 points, besides being the source of the team’s physical play. His number of hits - 112 - speaks for the energy and toughness Steeves brings with him on the court during every game, and this is the very quality that the Bruins would like to have in their team during the playoffs when the games are so tight that they have no choice but to pull the trigger. Observers even suggest that his ability to play in different positions and his hard work could be the reasons behind his getting a longer stay with the team.The Bruins are planning to keep more of their important players after securing Jonathan Aspirot already. If the trend of getting good production and consistency continues, then the duo of Viktor Arvidsson and Alex Steeves might be the next ones to get contract extensions.","The bruins are planning to keep more of their important players after securing jonathan aspirot already.

Andrei Vasilevsky’s achievement tops Tampa Bay’s sensational season with more records

Andrei Vasilevskiy added another prestigious accomplishment to his already impressive resume on Sunday afternoon. The Tampa Bay Lightning goaltender became just the sixth netminder in NHL history to record 10 consecutive 20-win seasons.Vasilevskiy achieved the milestone during Tampa Bay's 4-1 victory over the Dallas Stars at American Airlines Center. The win extended the Lightning's point streak to 13 games while improving their record to 30-13-4 on the season.The 31-year-old Russian joined an exclusive club that includes only Hockey Hall of Famers and future inductees. Henrik Lundqvist, Martin Brodeur, Tony Esposito, Chris Osgood, and Jacques Plante represent the only other goaltenders to accomplish the feat.The company Vasilevskiy now keeps speaks volumes about his sustained excellence since becoming Tampa Bay's starting goaltender. He's posted at least 20 wins in every season since taking over the starting role before the 2016-17 campaign.Vasilevskiy made 19 saves against Dallas to earn his 20th victory of the 2025-26 season. The performance represented another workmanlike effort from the two-time Stanley Cup champion who has been a model of consistency throughout his career.Lightning head coach Jon Cooper praised his team's effort following the victory. ""This is game five of a five-game trip. Basically, we played nine games in nine different cities,"" Cooper said. ""For the guys to take all but an overtime loss in one, I've got to tip my cap to them. It's been a pretty good effort by them.""Tampa Bay has been one of the NHL's hottest teams throughout the past month. The Lightning have collected points in 13 consecutive games, with Vasilevskiy providing the steady presence in goal that has become his trademark.The victory over Dallas represented a crucial two points against one of the Western Conference's top teams. Dallas grabbed an early 1-0 lead before Tampa Bay rallied with goals from Brandon Hagel and others to secure the win.Forward Darren Raddysh appreciated his team's response after falling behind. ""I liked our response,"" Raddysh said. ""We went down one, but we stuck to our game plan and wanted to make them defend. I thought we did pretty well in the first period there and continued in the second and third.""Vasilevskiy's consistent excellence has been the foundation of Tampa Bay's success throughout his tenure. Since joining the franchise in 2012, the Russian netminder has slowly cemented himself as one of the league’s elite goaltenders with two Stanley Cups, one Conn Smythe trophy, and a Vezina Trophy to his name.Even now at 31, he remains as lethal between the pipes as he was during the Lightning’s back-to-back championship wins back in 2020 and 2021.",Andrei vasilevskiy became the sixth goaltender in nhl history to record 10 consecutive 20-win seasons.

Lindsey Vonn Podiums in Italy🇮🇹Just Weeks Before Italian Olympics | Tarvisio Downhill

Emma Aicher wins as challengers rise and risks unfold



Lindsey Vonn, the four-time overall World Cup champion and Olympic gold medalist, delivered another strong performance on Sunday by finishing second in the women’s World Cup super-G in Tarvisio, Italy. The 41-year-old American earned her seventh podium finish in eight speed races this season, showing a level of consistency no other speed skier has matched as the Winter Olympics draw closer.Lindsey Vonn, the most decorated American alpine skier of all time, missed the win by just 0.27 seconds as Germany’s Emma Aicher took first place. The race was held on the Prampero course, where fog and poor visibility made conditions difficult, especially on the upper section. With the Milan Cortina Winter Olympics starting in less than three weeks, the result strengthens Vonn’s position as a top medal contender in downhill and super-G.Lindsey Vonn, known for her experience and control in speed events, led Emma Aicher at every checkpoint before losing time in the final gates. Even with the narrow loss, her worst result this season is still only fourth place. No other skier in the speed events has more than three podium finishes, highlighting how steady and reliable Vonn has been during this high-pressure Olympic season.Emma Aicher, a rising German alpine skier, claimed the super-G victory for her second win of the season and the fourth of her World Cup career. Born in Sweden to a Swedish mother and a German father, Aicher is one of the few athletes who competes in all four alpine skiing disciplines, showing rare versatility at a young age.Emma Aicher, the youngest skier on the podium, finished ahead of a strong and experienced field. Ester Ledecka, the Olympic champion famous for winning gold medals in both skiing and snowboarding, finished third to earn her first podium of the season. France’s Romane Miradoli placed fourth, while American Keely Cashman achieved the best result of her career by finishing fifth.Alice Robinson, the New Zealand skier who has won multiple races this season, added drama late in the event after crashing into the final gate and hitting the snow hard. Robinson stood up quickly and appeared to avoid serious injury, though she looked shaken after the fall.The women’s World Cup circuit now moves to Kronplatz in Italy for a giant slalom before one final speed race weekend in Crans-Montana, Switzerland. Italy is also watching closely as Federica Brignone, the defending overall World Cup champion, considers a return after recovering from a serious leg injury.Also Read: Lindsey Vonn stuns fans with shocking body transformation ahead of Winter Olympics 2026 return","Lindsey vonn finished second in the women’s world cup super-g in tarvisio, italy.

Patrick Reed remains ineligible but continues with the worldwide golf plan

Patrick Reed, the 2018 Masters champion and LIV Golf player, said he would consider returning to the PGA Tour if given the chance, calling it the best tour in the world. Reed made the comments in Dubai, where he is starting his 2026 season by playing three DP World Tour events before the LIV Golf season begins next month.Patrick Reed is in the Middle East as part of his goal to compete around the world, a commitment to the DP World Tour and Asian Tour that has helped him remain ranked No. 41 in the Official World Golf Ranking despite LIV Golf events not offering ranking points. Earlier this month, after completing a demanding 32-event season in 2025, Reed was resting when news broke that Brooks Koepka was returning to the PGA Tour through the newly created Returning Member Program, which only Koepka, Cameron Smith, Bryson DeChambeau, and Jon Rahm were eligible for, with the latter three choosing to remain on LIV Golf.Patrick Reed is not eligible for the Returning Member Program because his Masters victory came in 2018, before LIV Golf began. Reed has played on LIV since its first season in 2022 and has one individual victory in 45 starts. Asked at the Dubai Invitational on Saturday if he would return to the PGA Tour if allowed, Reed said he would play everywhere and joked that he is already competing on three tours.Patrick Reed played a full global schedule in 2025, including 14 LIV Golf events, four major championships, 10 DP World Tour tournaments, and four Asian Tour events.Since winning the Masters, Reed has remained competitive in majors, finishing fourth at the 2018 U.S. Open at Shinnecock, 10th at the 2019 Open Championship, top-10 at Augusta in 2020 and 2021, T-4 at the Masters in 2023, and T-3 last year after contending late on Sunday.Patrick Reed is a nine-time PGA Tour winner and received an honorary life membership on the DP World Tour in 2019. Starting in 2026, Reed may need to pay fines for LIV events that clash with DP World Tour tournaments. The fine amounts are unknown, and according to The Telegraph, LIV will no longer pay them. Reed said he is willing to pay and hopes the issue is resolved because he has always wanted to be a worldwide player.","Patrick reed opens up about possible pga tour return as he begins 2026 season in dubai.

Jorge Mateo joins Atlanta Braves after Ha-Seong Kim ruled out for months

Jorge Mateo is officially headed to Atlanta. On Monday, January 19, 2026, the Atlanta Braves agreed to a one-year, $1 million contract with the free-agent infielder and outfielder, the team announced in Atlanta, Georgia. The move comes at a critical time for the Braves, just one day after the team confirmed that shortstop Ha-Seong Kim will miss several months after finger surgery.Ha-Seong Kim suffered a torn tendon in the middle finger of his right hand and is expected to be out for four to five months. With the season approaching and a major gap in the infield, the Braves acted quickly. Signing Jorge Mateo gives Atlanta a flexible player who can cover both the infield and outfield while Kim recovers.The Braves shared on Sunday, January 18, that Ha-Seong Kim underwent surgery to repair a torn tendon in his right middle finger. Doctors expect him to miss most of the first half of the season.Losing their starting shortstop forced the front office to look for fast help, and Jorge Mateo became their answer. Jorge Mateo, 30, brings speed, experience, and defensive range.Six seasons in the big leagues under his belt, he has suited up for both the San Diego Padres and the Baltimore Orioles.Atlanta values his capacity to cover shortstop, second base, or the outfield depending on daily needs by allowing him to move throughout the field.The Braves did not release contract bonuses, but the deal is confirmed as a one-year agreement worth $1 million. The signing allows Atlanta to stay flexible while waiting for Ha-Seong Kim’s return later in the year.Jorge Mateo’s 2025 season with the Baltimore Orioles was limited. He appeared in 42 games and recorded 83 plate appearances. He hit .177 with one home run and three runs batted in.His season was interrupted between June 6 and September 5 because of left elbow inflammation, which kept him off the field for nearly three months.Even with those struggles, the Braves see value in Mateo’s speed and glove. Over his career, Jorge Mateo owns a .221 batting average with 30 home runs and 121 RBIs across stints with the San Diego Padres from 2020 to 2021 and the Baltimore Orioles afterward.His defensive flexibility and baserunning also set him apart, characteristics Atlanta has usually prized. This is a low-risk signing with potential upside for the Braves.Should Mateo settle into his stride, he could become a consistent fill-in as Ha-Seong Kim heals. Otherwise, the short-term agreement lets Atlanta keep investigating possibilities.With spring training nearing, the Braves now turn their focus to reshaping the infield. Jorge Mateo arrives not as a star replacement, but as a needed piece in a moment where depth matters most.","Jorge mateo has agreed to a one-year, $1 million contract with the atlanta braves.

A single play overshadows a strong season and raises questions about accountability

The Chicago Bears’ promising postseason run came to a sudden and tragic end Sunday night, and the final moments left a lot to be desired for the team due to crucial mistakes. A 20-17 overtime loss to the Los Angeles Rams in the divisional round shifted the focus from what the Bears accomplished this season to how it ended.Much focus was given to wide receiver DJ Moore, whose role in a crucial overtime miscue infamously drew attention across the league. Adding to the tension, Moore was reportedly not present in the locker room when media interviews began. For a team that leaned heavily on accountability and chemistry throughout its NFC North title run, it was a moment that Bears fans want to forget.The decisive play came on second and eight in overtime, with Caleb Williams releasing a pass that was picked off by Rams safety Kam Curl, setting up the drive that sealed Chicago’s elimination. The issue appeared to stem from a big miscommunication as Moore ran a vertical route, while Williams expected him to flatten underneath the safety.After the game, Williams addressed the moment directly. He said, “I’ve got to go back and watch it, obviously haven’t seen it. ... Had D.J. going over the top over all of it. Just a miscommunication between him and I. Tried to flatten him off under the safety, and he kept it vertical, from what I saw in the moment.”Still, Moore’s absence from the locker room did not go unnoticed. Reports quickly spread that he was unavailable when reporters entered, which fueled criticism from former players and analysts. Terrell Owens was among those who believed Moore should have faced the media and addressed the play.On the field, Moore delivered a solid performance, catching five passes for 52 yards and a touchdown on eight targets, while also adding eight rushing yards. Williams finished 23 of 42 for 257 yards, two touchdowns, and three interceptions, while also contributing 40 rushing yards. Neither player had a ‘great’ night per se, but both were instrumental in Chicago’s rise this season.",The chicago bears lost 20-17 to the los angeles rams in the divisional round.

After T20 World Cup Move, Bangladesh Now Bans IPL 2026 Broadcast Amid Mustafizur Rahman Row

The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has stopped preparations for the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2026 amid uncertainty over Bangladesh’s participation in the tournament, scheduled to be held next month in India and Sri Lanka. The move follows Pakistan’s support for Bangladesh’s demand that its matches be shifted out of India.According to a report by Pakistani news outlet Geo News, the PCB halted preparations after Pakistan backed Bangladesh’s decision not to travel to India for its World Cup matches. Pakistan has indicated that it could reconsider its own participation if the issue remains unresolved.The development followed talks between officials from Dhaka and Islamabad on Saturday, during which Pakistan expressed full support for Bangladesh’s stance, citing security concerns. PCB chairman Mohsin Naqvi, who is also Pakistan’s interior minister and a Senator, was involved in the discussions.Geo News reported, quoting sources, that Pakistan would review its participation in the tournament if Bangladesh’s concerns are not addressed.The crisis began after Bangladesh pacer Mustafizur Rahman was withdrawn from the 2026 Indian Premier League on the BCCI’s instructions, citing unspecified ""developments all around.""Since then, discussions between the ICC and the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) have failed to produce a resolution.The BCB has stated that Bangladesh will not travel to India for its group matches in Kolkata and Mumbai, citing ""security concerns"".With the tournament schedule already finalised, the ICC has shown reluctance to move Bangladesh’s matches to Sri Lanka, the co-host nation, where the India-Pakistan match is scheduled to be held under the existing agreement for ICC events until 2027.If Bangladesh does not take part in the tournament, Scotland is likely to be named as the replacement team based on current rankings. Bangladesh are scheduled to play three league matches in Kolkata and one in Mumbai.The BCB has insisted on either a venue change or a group change so that its matches can be played in Sri Lanka. Bangladesh are currently placed in Group C along with West Indies, Italy, England and Nepal.In its last meeting with ICC officials in Dhaka, the BCB proposed swapping places with Ireland in Group B, which includes Sri Lanka, Australia, Oman and Zimbabwe.

Shubman Gill on missed chances, fielding lapses & World Cup preparation after ODI series loss

NEW DELHI: Virat Kohli ’s bat once again became the loudest response after India lost the three-match ODI series against New Zealand 1-2, with the former captain’s elder brother Vikas Kohli taking a pointed swipe at critics questioning the great’s choices late in his career.India went down by 41 runs in the series decider in Indore, but Kohli stood tall amid the collapse, producing a sublime 124 while chasing a daunting 338. Across the three matches, the 37-year-old amassed 240 runs at an average of 80, with scores of 93, 23 and 124, underlining his enduring dominance in the format.The knock came days after former India batter and commentator Sanjay Manjrekar questioned Kohli’s decision to retire from Test cricket and continue in what he described as the “easy” format of ODIs. The remark, made during the fifth Ashes Test in Sydney where Joe Root and Steve Smith struck centuries, drew widespread criticism from fans.Vikas Kohli joined the chorus on Sunday, soon after Virat registered his 54th ODI hundred and 85th international ton. In a post on Threads that has since gone viral, he aimed a sharp barb at Manjrekar. “I wonder if Mr Expert of cricket has some suggestions for the easiest form of cricket.You need to be there to do that. Anyways, as I said, Easier said than done,” he wrote.The numbers back the sentiment. In Kohli’s last six ODIs, he has scored three centuries and two half-centuries. He also struck a hundred and a fifty for Delhi in the Vijay Hazare Trophy, silencing doubts about his motivation after stepping away from Tests.Kohli will next feature in India colours in July 2026 during the England ODI tour. Before that, he will turn his focus to IPL 2026, aiming to help Royal Challengers Bengaluru defend their title.","India lost the three-match odi series against new zealand 1-2.
