Will Raquel Rodriguez and Liv Morgan face Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion in a WrestleMania WWE celebrity tag team match ?



Raquel Rodriguez is not waiting for WrestleMania to make noise. The WWE star has now openly challenged Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion to step inside a WWE ring. She shared this during a recent appearance on TMZ’s Inside The Ring podcast. And she was clear, she wants this to happen. Raquel Rodriguez said she and her tag team partner Liv Morgan have talked about this match for years. In fact, the idea goes back to 2023 when both women said facing the two rap stars would be their dream match. Now, with WrestleMania coming close, Raquel Rodriguez brought it up again and said it would be “iconic.”Cardi B already has a history with WWE. She hosted SummerSlam in 2021 and has often spoken about possibly wrestling one day. WWE has also worked with big names from music and social media in recent years, so this idea is not as wild as it sounds. Raquel Rodriguez did not hold back, she said she and Liv Morgan are ready. She even joked about how Cardi B might use her strength inside the ring. Still, behind the humor, the message was serious, they wanted the match.Speaking on TMZ’s Inside The Ring, Raquel Rodriguez said, “I think Liv and I versus Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion would just be iconic.”She smiled while saying it, but she made it clear this has been on her mind for a long time.She also said, “We’re the greatest tag team of all time. We’re in the history books.” That confidence shows how strongly she believes in her team with Liv Morgan.WWE has brought celebrities into matches before. Bad Bunny competed in multiple matches, including a street fight against Damian Priest in 2023. Logan Paul has also wrestled in major events. These appearances have shown that celebrities can train and perform at a high level inside WWE.Cardi B has teased wrestling before. She once spoke about training and getting physical in the ring. Megan Thee Stallion has not wrestled, but she has shown strong athletic ability during performances.Right now, there is no official match announced for WrestleMania between these four women. But Raquel Rodriguez’s comments have started the conversation again. Fans are already reacting online, wondering if WWE could turn this dream into reality.For Raquel Rodriguez and Liv Morgan, this is more than just talk. They see it as a big moment for women’s wrestling.

Jordan Cowan, figure skating cameraman, transforms Milano-Cortina Winter Olympics coverage experience



At the Milano-Cortina Winter Olympics, figure skating fans are seeing moments never shown before on television. As skaters finish their routines and emotions take over, a camera now follows them across the rink. The person behind this new view is former American competitive ice dancer Jordan Cowan. Skating alongside athletes with a special camera rig he designed, Cowan records reactions immediately after performances, showing relief, tears, and celebration in real time.Broadcasts traditionally cut away once the music ends, but Cowan calls that period an unexplored part of the sport. Olympic Broadcasting Services introduced the experiment to make coverage more personal. Viewers now see athletes leaving the ice before they reach coaches in the kiss-and-cry area. Cowan’s work has quickly gained attention because it reveals emotions usually hidden from audiences and gives fans a closer connection to the skaters’ experience.Jordan Cowan grew up in Los Angeles and began skating as a child. Speaking to Reuters , he joked that the rink felt special because it had air conditioning while his home did not.His curiosity about the sport led him to train seriously in Michigan, where he competed in ice dance before retiring from competition.After stepping away from skating, he struggled to choose between film and science. He eventually combined both interests. While filming an ice show in Sun Valley for a PBS production, he recorded behind-the-scenes footage using a phone and small stabilizer. Producers later used the shots, impressed by the camera appearing to float across the ice.Since then, Cowan has upgraded his equipment from a phone to cinema-style cameras. He uses manual focus and zoom, believing a skater can anticipate motion better than autofocus systems. His skating skills allow him to follow athletes smoothly without interrupting their performance environment.Cowan says his presence can also comfort competitors during difficult moments. Some athletes told him having another skater nearby makes the experience feel less lonely. He keeps distance so they can process emotions while still capturing the crowd’s reaction.He worked closely with Olympic Broadcasting Services, which also introduced drones and overhead cameras at these Games. For Cowan, the role is meaningful even though he never competed in the Olympics. He hopes his footage becomes part of a long-lasting record of the sport and remains meaningful decades from now.","Jordan cowan, figure skating cameraman, transforms milano-cortina winter olympics coverage experience.

Where will Sidney Crosby’s absence be felt most if he can’t play Friday?

Sidney Crosby Team Canada injury update for Team Canada semifinal against Finland at Milano Cortina Olympics



Without Crosby, the team would not only have less scoring depth, but also less leadership on the ice. Jon Cooper, the head coach, has been careful with what he says, telling people to be careful and not saying whether or not his captain will play. Team Canada has to wait nervously for the NHL game in Milan today because they want to win a spot in the gold medal game.The worry comes from a hard hit Crosby took during the quarterfinal win on Wednesday. He left in the second period and didn't come back, which made people wonder how bad the injury was right away. There has been no confirmation of structural damage, but the quick turnaround between games makes it hard for him to be available. Canada's medical staff checks on the players every day, and Cooper said again that no player will be put in danger. There is still a chance that a decision will be made at game time. Both fans and opponents may not know until after a pregame skate what the final call will be.The most recent updates on Sidney Crosby's injury in the NHL say that he is still doubtful but not officially out. Reports say that Crosby might be able to test the injury during a morning skate before the coaches send in their final lineup.Nick Suzuki of the Montreal Canadiens is expected to take over Crosby's even-strength role if he can't play. Connor McDavid of the Edmonton Oilers could take on more leadership roles. He has already worn an alternate captain's ""A"" during the tournament.Finland's well-organized defense will be a challenge for Canada, no matter what Crosby's condition is. Canada's depth gives them some flexibility, but it's almost impossible to replace his two-way impact. The semifinal will define Canada's Olympic campaign, whether or not Crosby plays.","Sidney crosby took a hard hit during team canada's quarterfinal win on wednesday.

Viktor Arvidsson: NHL trade rumours: Boston Bruins consider Viktor Arvidsson trade as NHL freeze thaws and playoff race begins,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/nhl-trade-rumours-boston-bruins-consider-viktor-arvidsson-trade-as-nhl-freeze-thaws-and-playoff-race-begins/articleshow/128611448.cms,"Viktor Arvidsson (via Getty Images)

Viktor Arvidsson’s breakout season presents tough decision between trade asset and team catalyst



The clock is officially ticking for the Boston Bruins as the roster freeze expires this Sunday night. General manager Don Sweeney has less than a week to determine whether the Boston Bruins need to buy, sell, or strike a balance as the March 6 trade deadline approaches.Preliminary reports have the Boston Bruins targeting an addition of talent, likely in the form of a top-four defenseman or a first-line center. However, the Boston Bruins’ next four games may end up determining their trade deadline course, and one surprising name that has popped up in trade rumors is that of Swedish ice hockey right wing Viktor Arvidsson.Viktor Arvidsson has quietly emerged as one of the most potent secondary scorers on the Boston Bruins roster, chipping in 14 goals and 28 points in 45 games while showing great chemistry with Casey Mittelstadt and Pavel Zacha. He is also the only Boston Bruins forward who is not yet signed for next season, making him both a potential rental player and a problem on the horizon.The 32-year-old player was selected by the Nashville Predators in the fourth round, 112th overall, at the 2014 NHL entry draft. He is well known for winning the Swedish Championship twice with Skellefteå AIK in the Swedish Hockey League (SHL). His trade value has increased, as it is believed that he could now bring in a much higher return in terms of draft picks or other assets from a contender looking to add to their scoring depth.This small investment could be turned into a high draft pick or other assets, which would be phenomenal asset management.Trading him off as part of a bigger deal for a premium upgrade is theoretically enticing, but it is most unlikely to happen. The teams letting go of their elite centers or best defenders usually ask for young talent, prospects, or long-term assets.An extension is another option. Arvidsson has surprised and been useful in developing young players. However, with most of Boston’s roster already committed to next season, even a short-term extension may not align with the team’s financial or organizational goals.If Boston retains him past the trade deadline, they may lose him for free in the offseason. However, if they trade him away, they might sabotage their own playoff chances.In a highly competitive Eastern Conference, Sweeney’s Arvidsson move might just show whether the Bruins are committed to this season as a contender or as a rebuilding phase for what’s to come.","Viktor arvidsson has quietly emerged as one of the most potent secondary scorers on the boston bruins roster.

The 18-year-old figure skater Isabeau Levito competed at the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milan-Cortina, and a podium finish by her teammate Alysa Liu ended a 20-year medal drought for the United States in women’s singles. The last American woman to win an Olympic medal was Sasha Cohen, who captured silver in 2006.Levito’s programs have already drawn attention. In the short program, she performs to “Zoo Be Zoo Be Zoo” as a tribute to Italian cinema icon Sophia Loren. Her free skate uses music from the 1988 Academy Award-winning film Cinema Paradiso. The themes match her strong Italian family background.

Tom Brady’s Olympic Hockey Cameo Has Fans and Analysts Questioning His ‘Neutral’ Take on the Patriots,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/dog-in-the-fight-tom-bradys-olympic-hockey-cameo-has-fans-and-analysts-side-eyeing-his-neutral-patriots-talk/articleshow/128612482.cms,"Tom Brady watches the USA vs. Canada women’s hockey gold-medal game at the Winter Olympics after previously saying he “didn’t have a dog in the fight” for Super Bowl LX.

Mike Kadlick calls out Tom Brady’s ‘no dog in the fight’ line after Team USA’s overtime win

Tom Brady’s $150 million bunker and Livvy Dunne partnership keep his post-retirement profile loud

Tom Brady tried to play neutral before Super Bowl LX, telling everyone he “didn't have a dog in the fight” when the New England Patriots faced the Seattle Seahawks at Levi’s Stadium earlier this month.A week later, he was in the stands at the Santa Giulia Arena, all in on Team USA in the women’s gold-medal game against Canada, and an NFL analyst immediately called him on it.In the buildup to Patriots vs. Seahawks in Super Bowl LX, the six-time Super Bowl winner tried to stay above the fray.“I don't have a dog in the fight in this one. May the best team win,” Brady said. “And in terms of the Patriots, this is a new chapter in New England, and I'm glad everyone's embraced the Mike Vrabel regime, all the amazing players that have worked so hard to get their club to this position.”That distance didn’t sit perfectly with everyone in New England, but it at least sounded like he was staying out of it. Then came Thursday’s women’s hockey final at the Winter Olympics. Megan Keller scored just over four minutes into overtime to give the United States a 2-1 win over Canada in the gold-medal game, and Brady was right there for the moment.He shared a picture of his son, Benjamin, celebrating the win with a friend on his Instagram story, adding the line: “Most Dominant Team in the world.”NFL analyst Mike Kadlick spotted the shift and went straight to X with a sharp question: “Does he have a dog in the fight?”It was a clean little jab. Brady wanted to be neutral when the Patriots were playing for a Lombardi, but he had no issue declaring the U.S. women the best in the world from his Olympic seat. Nobody is mad he backed Team USA. The point is simple: when you tell fans you’re out of the rivalry business, they’re going to notice every time you pick a side.While everyone was dissecting his “dog in the fight” stance, Brady’s off-field life kept getting bigger. Earlier this week, Mary K. Jacob of the New York Post reported that his 25,000-square-foot mansion on Indian Creek Island in Miami is effectively finished, years after he and Gisele Bündchen bought the two-acre waterfront lot for about $17 million in 2020 and tore down the old home.The new build sits on one of the most tightly guarded pieces of land in the country, with a pale stone-and-glass façade facing Biscayne Bay, deep balconies, and a long run of private dockage. Behind the house, photos show his reported $6.5 million speedboat and two Yamaha WaveRunners, each around $20,000, parked on lifts. Records cited in the report note that Brady transferred the property into a new trust in December and took out a $35 million loan, with documents stating the beneficiary intends to make it his Florida homestead.That same week, his business side added another headline name. As Jake Fenner reported, Brady’s NoBull brand brought in social media star and former LSU gymnast Livvy Dunne as an athlete, investor, and partner. Dunne announced it with an Instagram shoot and the caption: “sooo excited to join the nobull team alongside @tombrady as an athlete, investor, and partner... LFG!”Brady dropped into the comments with his trademark response, simply adding “LFG” and three raised-hand emojis. Dunne, who has shifted from college gymnastics into a mix of real estate and sponsorship deals, is also often seen backing Pittsburgh Pirates ace Paul Skenes. At the Super Bowl, she told the Daily Mail, “I'll try to make all of his starts, that's my goal this year,” and added, “We both travel so much, it's so important to put your phone down and just be with one another and be there for each other. ”Put it all together and the picture is clear. Brady might say he doesn’t have a dog in certain fights, but between picking sides for Team USA on Olympic ice, building a $150 million bunker in Miami, and signing one of the biggest names in college sports to his brand, he’s not exactly living a quiet, neutral retirement.","Tom brady tried to play neutral before super bowl lx, telling everyone he “didn’t have a dog in the fight” when the new england patriots faced the seattle seahawks.

The Los Angeles Clippers have surfaced in fresh league chatter involving Giannis Antetokounmpo , with insiders revealing that teams pursuing the Milwaukee Bucks star recently contacted Los Angeles about Kawhi Leonard’s availability. According to ClutchPoints reporter Brett Siegel, two Giannis suitors checked in with the Clippers ahead of the deadline to gauge interest in Leonard. The calls did not lead to movement, yet they signal how interconnected both superstars have become in trade discussions.The Clippers sit 26-28 and 10th in the Western Conference after recovering from a 6-21 start. Milwaukee, meanwhile, is 23-30 and 12th in the East. As both teams navigate uncertain playoff paths, league executives are evaluating long-term direction, contracts, and draft capital that could reshape the summer market.The NBA trade rumor linking the Clippers and Giannis Antetokounmpo stems from roster flexibility and new draft assets. On Clutch Scoops, Tomer Azarly said, “The Clippers could enter the Giannis sweepstakes if he’s available. They would have four very, very good draft picks, including the two Pacers ones that teams could be interested in.The Bucks could be interested in a couple of young players. So, could you pair Giannis and Kawhi together? That could be an interesting combo if you’re able to. ”Los Angeles strengthened its asset base by acquiring Bennedict Mathurin, Isaiah Jackson, a protected 2026 first-round pick, an unprotected 2029 first-round pick and a future second-round selection from Indiana. Those selections create credible leverage if a franchise player becomes attainable.Antetokounmpo is averaging 28 points, 10 rebounds, and 5.6 assists while shooting 64.5 percent from the field. Leonard has also been highly productive at 27.9 points per game on 49.1 percent shooting. From a basketball standpoint, pairing both would immediately elevate championship projections. The scenario now depends on Milwaukee’s willingness to engage.Any NBA trade rumor involving Giannis Antetokounmpo must account for his contract. He signed a three-year, $175,369,698 fully guaranteed deal with Milwaukee, carrying an average annual salary of $58,456,566. In 2025-26, he will earn $54,126,450 with a matching cap hit, per Spotrac.Antetokounmpo addressed his long-term outlook during an interview with COSMOTE TV. “As Americans say, opinions are cheap; that’s why everyone has one. Right now, at this moment, I’m in Milwaukee… I don’t know if I’ll leave, it’s not up to me. If it was up to me, maybe I already would have left. In a year and a half, when I become a free agent at 32, it will be up to me,” Antetokounmpo said.“No one can dare come and tell me not to play. I never gave anyone that right, as long as my legs allow me, I’ll be out there.”His salary would require significant matching contracts and draft equity. So there is also a financial weight that might influence the discussion.If this NBA trade rumor advances to reality, Milwaukee’s asking price would be substantial. Franchise-level talent rarely moves without multiple unprotected first-round picks, young rotation players, and cap flexibility.At least two to four unprotected first-round picks to secure long-term draft control and rebuild flexibility.Future first-round pick swaps to maintain leverage in upcoming drafts.Proven young talent who can contribute immediately while still fitting a long-term timeline.Contracts that provide financial breathing room or allow Milwaukee to reshape the roster quickly.The Clippers’ newly acquired Pacers picks provide value, though Milwaukee could seek additional compensation to justify parting with a former MVP. League insiders have already connected Leonard’s situation to past blockbuster decisions. Siegel said, “There were two teams in particular that were pursuing Giannis that had made calls to the Clippers about Kawhi Leonard, checking in on his availability.”He added, “From the front office stand point and if you’re looking at this through the lens of the Clippers future, it probably makes a lot more sense to just trade him the off-season.”At this stage, discussions are exploratory. Still, with both franchises balancing performance and long-term planning, the possibility of a surprising summer cannot be dismissed.",The los angeles clippers have surfaced in fresh league chatter involving giannis antetokounmpo.

Mitch Marner is one of the most promising players of all time who has carved a niche in the field of ice hockey with his skills, playing techniques, and high-scoring abilities. In a very brief period of time, he has solidified his place and quickly established himself as a dynamic force on the ice. The player has recently grabbed eyeballs with his performance at the Milano Cortina Winter Olympics 2026, where his timely overtime goal led Team Canada to the semifinals against Finland.As per reports, it was Mitch Marner's overtime winning goal at just 1:22 into overtime that led the Canadiens to book a spot at the semifinal. Canada trailed late in regulation, with Czechia taking a 3–2 lead less than eight minutes from the end, but Marner’s goal at the end stole the show.Besides this, the Vegas Golden Knights right winger has reached several milestones, including his 500 career points in just 467 games, and a career-high 99 points in 2022-23, which earned him a Selke Trophy nomination for his defensive play.

Kylie Kelce lost in her phone while attending Winter Olympics

Going in the opposite direction, the fierce tigress said! “Not Gonna Lie” podcast host Kylie Kelce does not want to be known as “Kylie Kelce and her husband.” She recently spoke on her podcast and shared a CBC Olympics post that used that phrase. She said, “Cut that out. We’ve leaned too far in the opposite direction. You know what’s great? Jason and Kylie Kelce.”Is she trying to keep her retired NFL star husband relevant? Or is she too old-fashioned to be known by her name? Unlike modern women, who often keep their maiden surname after marriage and sometimes attach their husband’s surname as initials, like “N.” or “S” to their names. Maybe Kylie just wanted her husband to be known and named as well. Could be anything. Anyway, let’s talk about her Winter Olympics snippets now.The main event at Milan for the mom-of-four was the Women’s Ice Hockey semi-finals. She admitted they had not planned to attend, but when they heard women were playing, they decided to go. Kylie is a former field hockey player.Afterward, CBC Olympics shared a picture of the couple in the spectator stands. They captioned it: “Kylie Kelce and her husband supporting @TeamUSA women’s hockey.”The retired Philadelphia Eagles center brought the post to Kylie’s attention at breakfast.She said on the podcast, “This is ridiculous. Cut that out. We’ve leaned too far in the opposite direction.” We’ve already established what’s great for Jason’s wife. She quickly shifted the podcast to a different topic and expressed displeasure for the photo the CBC Olympics shared.The photo posted by CBC Olympics showed her lost in her phone. She said, “I’m a little sad about this because I’m barely ever on my phone. Last night, I was busy watching [women’s hockey semi-finals], and then you caught me on my phone. So, you caught me. You got me.”Then the 33-year-old NFL WAG pointed out that “people were enjoying the caption though,” and later quietly admitted, “Maybe we should say both names. But [pause], you know, [tilts her head to one side], sure [chuckles].” She seems confused. Again, like most modern women.The ardent Philadelphia Eagles fan shared that it was the first competition they attended at the Winter Olympics. The women’s ice hockey team dominated in a way she couldn’t explain.Her favorite story from the global event was Cory and Korey [Cory Thiesse and Korey Dropkin] winning a silver medal in mixed doubles curling at the 2026 Milano Cortina Winter Olympics on Feb 10.",Not gonna lie podcast host rejects cbc olympics’ description and wants to be known as “jason and kylie kelce” jason kelce brought the post to kylie’s attention at breakfast.

Alex Ovechkin addresses his NHL future with the Washington Capitals and beyond, amid playoff push

Alex Ovechkin is three-time Hart Trophy winner

Washington Capitals captain Alex Ovechkin has recently delivered a candid assessment regarding his future in the NHL , addressing his long-running speculation about retirement and what comes next after the 2025-26 season. Ovechkin, who is in the final year of his current contract with the Capitals, clarified that he has yet to decide his playing future beyond this season.Despite intense media and fan interest, the 39-year-old said he isn't in a rush to announce retirement and has no final decision about his future beyond his current contract, and he won’t likely make a hasty decision by the end of the season.

The Russian star emphasized that he has not taken any final decision about his future beyond his current contract, which is supposed to expire after this season.Speaking to NHL beat writer Tom Gulitti, Ovechkin stated, “No, I don’t know yet. We have to make a decision. We have to talk with the family, with (Capitals owner) Ted (Leonsis), [general manager Chris Patrick], and then we’ll see.”Ovechkin stated he needs to consult with his family, Capitals team owner Ted Leonsis, and general manager Chris Patrick before committing further. On the other hand, speculation has swirled due to his age and the team's position, but he dismissed retirement talk for now.The three-time Hart Trophy winner further stated, “We have ups and downs. It’s not about me. You see, everybody was maybe a little struggling because last year, we scored like five, six goals in a game, and it was easy.” This clearly states that he won’t be deciding anything about his future by the end of the season.As for his performance, Ovechkin has 22 goals and 48 points in 59 games, trailing teammate Tom Wilson. However, reports suggest that last season he scored 44 goals in 65 games, including breaking Wayne Gretzky's record, setting high expectations despite a fibula injury.It is to be noted that Ovechkin is also currently on a break, as Russia has not been invited to the 2026 Winter Olympics.

How Jakub Menšík built his rising tennis fortune



One big night can change how a career feels. For Jakub Menšík, Doha was that night. At the 2026 Qatar Open in Doha on February 19, the 19-year-old Czech delivered the biggest result of his career by defeating the world No. 2, Jannik Sinner, in the quarterfinals. He came through a tight three-set match, winning 7-6(3), 2-6, 6-3 after more than two hours on court. It was a composed and confident performance against one of the most consistent players in men’s tennis, and it sent Menšík into the semifinals with some serious momentum. He served boldly, swung freely and trusted his power when the pressure tightened.A win like that changes things. It gives a young player a lot of confidence. Opponents start taking him seriously. Fans stop calling him “one for the future.” And whenever a teenager breaks through like that, curiosity naturally turns to the bigger picture, which includes what it means financially. Let's take a look at his net worth.According to his official ATP Tour profile, Menšík has earned approximately $5.28 million in career prize money so far. For someone who is still only 19, that’s a whopping number.It reflects steady progression, consistent tour-level results and the ability to compete deep into events. But prize money figures can be misleading. The $5.28 million listed on the ATP site is gross income. Professional tennis players pay their own way. Coaches, physios and fitness trainers are not optional at this level but essential. Travel is constant and international. Hotels, flights and tournament expenses stack up quickly. Add management commissions and taxes across multiple countries, and the headline figure shrinks fast.Once those deductions are factored in, industry estimates suggest Menšík’s 2026 net worth likely falls somewhere between $1.5 million and $3.5 million. That range is typical for a rising ATP player who is earning well but still investing heavily in building a long-term career.Commercially, he’s still early in his journey. He doesn’t yet have the blockbuster endorsement deals that established top-10 stars command. However, statement wins dramatically increase visibility. Brands are drawn to youth, momentum and upside and a fearless teenager who just beat one of the sport’s most consistent players checks all three boxes.Right now, Menšík’s finances reflect a player climbing rather than one who has fully arrived. If performances like Doha become regular instead of rare, both his ranking and his earning power could rise very quickly.","Jakub menšík beat world no. 2 jannik sinner 7-6(3), 2-6, 6-3 in the quarterfinals of the 2026 qatar open in doha on february 19.

Tommaso Giacomel looked ready for a medal. Then, in a shocking turn, he was sitting in the snow. The 22-year-old Italian biathlon star shocked fans after collapsing during the men’s 15km mass start at the 2026 Winter Olympics. The worrying moment happened in Anterselva during the Milan-Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics. Tommaso Giacomel was in strong form and even led the race at the halfway mark. He had hit all his targets in two shooting stages without a single miss. The home crowd believed a medal was coming. But things changed quickly. Giacomel began to slow down on the snowy track. Other athletes passed him. Soon after, television cameras showed him sitting on the ground in the woods section of the course. His ski poles were beside him. Officials rushed to check on him.According to Eurosport, commentators described it as a “Cursed Olympics” for Giacomel and reported that he appeared to struggle with his breathing. He did not finish the race. In fact, he was the only one among the 30 competitors who did not cross the finish line. More than an hour later, Italy coach Fabio Cianciana gave an update. He said, “Health comes before the races.If Tommy felt some pain in the ribs, it is right that he has stopped. ” He added, “After one minute, he already felt better. He went on his legs for the first medical check. Now he is doing other treatments and he is fine.”Cianciana also spoke about how well Giacomel was performing before the incident. He said, “The race was going very well. Once he passed unharmed from the prone shooting, we knew that Tommaso would have been very dangerous on the standing shooting.”While Giacomel’s race ended in pain, the competition continued. Johannes Dale-Skjevdal of Norway won gold with a perfect performance. He hit all 20 of his shots. His teammate Sturla Holm Laegreid took silver and finished the Games with a medal in each of the five races he entered.For Giacomel, this was his sixth event of the Olympics. He had already raced in the individual, sprint, pursuit, mass start, and team relay. He also won a silver medal in the mixed relay, which means he will not leave the Games without success.Still, the scene in Anterselva left fans concerned.

United WE Announces Brittany Mahomes as First Champion for Change Winner



""at the decision-making table,""

In Kansas City, the Mahomes name is synonymous with winning but while Patrick is busy leading the Chiefs and recovering from his injury, Brittany Mahomes is carving out a legacy that is arguably just as historic. On February 19, 2026, it was officially announced that Brittany has been named the inaugural recipient of the Champion for Change Award by United WE.The honor isn't just a ""thank you"" for being a local celebrity, it’s a recognition of the serious economic and cultural shift Brittany has spearheaded in Missouri and beyond.The primary reason for the award is Brittany’s visionary leadership in women’s professional sports. As a co-owner of the KC Current, she didn't just buy into a team, she invested in an entire ecosystem. She was a driving force behind the construction of CPKC Stadium, which made global headlines for being the first stadium on Earth built specifically for a women’s professional team.United WE noted that her leadership proves that when women arethe entire economy grows stronger. By treating women’s sports as a ""growing economic engine"" rather than a side project, she has changed the blueprint for sports ownership in America.Beyond the soccer pitch, the award highlights her philanthropic work. Alongside her husband, Patrick Mahomes , Brittany has channeled millions through the 15 and the Mahomies Foundation. These funds have gone directly into underserved communities, focusing on children's health, wellness, and educational opportunities.The organization emphasized that Brittany’s role as an entrepreneur, investor, and mother of three makes her the perfect face for this new award. She represents a generation of women who aren't just participating in the conversation, they are leading it.Randi Mahomes celebrated this achievement of her daughter-in-law on her Instagram story, sharing her excitement and publicly showing support for Brittany’s special milestone.The award will be presented on May 6, 2026, during a milestone event at CPKC Stadium. It’s a full-circle moment for Brittany, receiving the ""Champion for Change"" honor in the very venue she helped build to change the game for women.As she continues to expand her reach including her recent induction into the UT Tyler Athletics Hall of Fame, Brittany Mahomes is proving that her impact on Kansas City is only just beginning.And as for Patrick Mahomes, who after the most difficult season of his career is finally giving Chiefs Kingdom something to smile about. As of late February 2026, the three-time Super Bowl MVP is well into his recovery from the torn ACL and LCL that ended his 2025 campaign prematurely.","Brittany mahomes has been named the inaugural recipient of the champion for change award by united we.

Instead of airing live on cable, the opening part of the matchup was available only on Peacock. USA Network, which is owned by NBCUniversal, showed the women’s speed skating 1500m during that time. NBC later scheduled delayed coverage of the hockey game at 11:50 a.m. ET on USA Network.Fans quickly shared their anger online. Many said they felt frustrated that such a major semifinal was not shown live on television. The matchup featured top-seeded Canada and defending 2022 Olympic champion Finland, making the decision even more surprising for viewers across the United States.The semifinal was already a huge story before the broadcast issue. Canada entered the game as the No. 1 seed, while Finland came in as the defending gold medalist from the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing.Both teams fought hard in the quarterfinals earlier in the week.Finland edged Switzerland 3-2 in overtime. Canada also needed extra time to beat Czechia 4-3. Those close wins set up what many believed would be one of the best hockey games of the tournament.However, Canada had to prepare without its captain, Sidney Crosby. The veteran forward suffered a lower-body injury during Wednesday’s quarterfinal and was ruled out of the semifinal. His absence was another major talking point heading into Friday’s game.Still, much of the online reaction focused on the broadcast choice. Fans took to X to express how they felt.One fan wrote, “Not having this Canada-Finland hockey game on a dedicated tv channel is infuriating to me.”Another posted, “Absolutely wild the Canada Finland semi final game isn’t on tv right now.”A different viewer added, “Why is my USA channel playing speed skating??? All your stars yet I have to have peacock to watch???”One more comment read, “Everywhere I look, I see that USA Network is supposed to be broadcasting the CAN/FIN hockey semifinal. Yet — they aren’t.”For many hockey fans, the issue was not about streaming itself. It was about missing the first hour of a major Olympic semifinal on traditional television. With two strong teams on the ice and a place in the gold medal game at stake, viewers expected full live coverage from the opening puck drop.","The canada vs finland men’s hockey semifinal began at 10:40 a.m. eastern time.

A peaceful base away from the tour for Novak Djokovic



Tennis legend Novak Djokovic has spent years living out of suitcases, hotel rooms and player lounges. So when he goes home, he really goes home. For the tennis great, that place is Marbella, Spain — a quiet, sun-soaked corner of the Costa del Sol where he can switch off from the noise of the tour and just be with his family. His villa is located in Sierra Blanca, one of Marbella’s most private and high-end residential areas. It sits slightly above the coastline, with open views of the Mediterranean and the mountains behind it. The neighborhood is known for security and seclusion. For someone as globally recognized as Djokovic, that kind of privacy isn’t a luxury, but a necessity.The house is large but not flashy. It is reported to span close to 1,000 square metres, with open living spaces and several bedrooms. Inside, the design is simple and calm, with marble floors, soft colours and large glass doors that bring in natural light. Outside, there is a spacious swimming pool and open terraces where the family can relax. The gardens are neatly kept and offer privacy and quiet.The villa also supports his training routine. It reportedly has nine bedrooms and eight bathrooms, along with a private gym and a spa area that includes a sauna and Turkish bath.There is a cinema room, a games room and a private tennis court where he can practise away from the public eye. With sea and mountain views around the property, the home works as both a peaceful retreat and a private training base. For a player known for his strict routines and recovery work, having those facilities at home makes sense. Even in downtime, the work doesn’t completely stop.The mansion is believed to be worth around $10 million approximately, reflecting both the prime location and its size. Djokovic is said to have settled there around 2020, after spending time in the area and enjoying the climate. Marbella offers warm weather most of the year, which is ideal for training. But more importantly, it offers space that is away from cameras and constant attention.For fans, it’s nice to see this side of Djokovic. On court, he is intense and fully focused. In Marbella, life is quieter and slower for the tennis icon. His home seems not about showing off, but about comfort, privacy and balance. After everything he has achieved in tennis, that may be what matters most.","Novak djokovic's marbella mansion has stunning views of the mediterranean sea.
