ILT20: Always nice to be in a winning position, says Tim Seifert

Former cricket star and commentator Virender Sehwag anticipates an exciting Qualifier 2 match between Sharjah Warriorz and Desert Vipers at the Sharjah Cricket Stadium. The victorious team will face Dubai Capitals in the final on February 9 at Dubai International Stadium. Sehwag also shared his thoughts on the UAE cricket venues and their batting conditions.""UAE stadiums have some of the best batting tracks. Though I didn't have the opportunity to play a lot here, I did play a couple of games for India and during the Indian Premier League (IPL) and I absolutely enjoyed batting here in Dubai, Sharjah and Abu Dhabi,"" Sehwag said.He expressed his expectations for the upcoming matches, saying, ""Hopefully the next two games (Qualifier 2 and Final) will be a cracker. The match between Dubai Capitals and Desert Vipers went down to the last ball and I am sure the next two games will be thrilling contest too.""Sehwag, who has been commentating since ILT20's beginning, discussed the league's development and its distinctive features.Also See: ICC Champions Trophy 2025 ""I think the ILT20 is one of the best leagues. Like IPL is good for the development of Indian cricket, similarly, ILT20 is good for UAE players and the Middle East. But the good part is that you can't see nine international players playing in one team in any other league,"" Sehwag remarked.He continued to share his observations about the league's progress, adding, ""This is the third year for me in ILT20 as a commentator. And I'm seeing that a lot of good international players are coming and playing this league, which is benefitting UAE's youngsters. They're getting good experience with international players. And this year, if you look at all the matches, they have been very close and very interesting and there were a lot of games that saw 200-plus runs being scored too.""Also See: Champions Trophy Fixtures 2025 When asked about potential batting partnerships, Sehwag mentioned David Warner , who recently scored 93 not out against Abu Dhabi Knight Riders, helping Dubai Capitals reach the playoffs. Regarding Indian players' participation in the league, Sehwag expressed his desire to see more Indian cricketers involved.""I would love to see Indian players here. If any Indian player who has just retired from International cricket or IPL and if they want to play, like Dinesh Karthik is playing right now, it would be great, I would love to see Indian cricketers play here and if there was one player I would have particularly liked to watch here is the sixer-man Yuvraj Singh,"" he said.",Virender sehwag has been commentating since the start of the ilt20 league.

NEW DELHI: FIFA has suspended the Pakistan Football Federation (PFF) after it failed to implement constitutional amendments deemed essential by the global governing body for the fair and efficient administration of the sport in the country. FIFA stated that the suspension would remain in place until the PFF Congress adopts the required amendments.Pakistan football has been under the control of a FIFA-appointed Normalisation Committee since June 2019. The committee was tasked with conducting elections and resolving internal conflicts within the federation, but it has struggled to fulfill its mandate.Despite multiple changes in leadership over the past five years, the fundamental issues within Pakistan's football structure persist. The Normalisation Committee has also been at odds with the state-run Pakistan Sports Board, further delaying the constitutional amendments.Earlier this week, PFF Normalisation Committee chairman Haroon Malik cautioned a parliamentary panel that his tenure would end on February 15 and that Pakistan risked suspension if the amendments were not implemented. He clarified that making these amendments did not mean he would be a candidate in the upcoming PFF elections.Malik also revealed that the PFF Congress was unwilling to comply with FIFA’s directives, resulting in the ongoing standoff.This marks the third time Pakistan's football federation has been suspended since 2017.",Fifa has suspended the pakistan football federation.

Jos Buttler (52) and Jack Bethell (51) scored fifties, but England struggled to rebuild after losing early wickets.Chasing a modest target, Gill anchored the innings, adapting to the match situation and forging vital partnerships. Iyer's counter-attacking knock, laced with sizzling shots, provided the initial impetus before Gill took charge after his dismissal.Axar's promotion up the order paid dividends as he supported Gill in the middle overs.Despite a late wobble, India overhauled the target with 68 balls to spare, thanks to Gill's composed knock and valuable contributions from Iyer and Axar.Earlier, England's openers Phil Salt (43) and Ben Duckett (32) got off to a flying start, but India's disciplined bowling and sharp fielding triggered a collapse.

SA20 showcasing perfect balance between bat and ball: Vernon Philander

'Not taking anything for granted': Kagiso Rabada as MI Cape Town storm into first SA20 final

(

is the commissioner of SA20. He is a former South African cricketer and captain)

Cricket in South Africa has been a tale of our country’s unyielding spirit, and we have always been proud of the resilience, character and tenacity that has been a hallmark of our players. As someone who had the privilege of leading the Proteas during what many consider our ‘golden era,’ I have witnessed first-hand the highs and lows of this great game in our nation. The years following the retirements of legends like Jacques Kallis , AB de Villiers, and Dale Steyn, among others, ushered in a period of challenges that tested our collective cricketing calibre, both on and off the field.We struggled to fill the void, and the results showed it. Nevertheless, today, I stand proud to say that South African cricket isn’t just back—it’s thriving, it’s electrifying, and the energy is palpable. Moreover, I can proudly say that SA20 has played a key role in this resurgence.When I was offered the role of League Commissioner for the SA20, launched in January 2023, it was to be part of the mission with Cricket South Africa to reignite the spirit that South Africa is renowned for. Another objective was to create a platform for young talent to shine, and to bring the world’s attention back to our shores – all these piqued my interest. I knew right then, that this was exactly what South Africa needed to bring back its rich cricket heritage.Now, as the league approaches its 100th game, in Season 3, it is clear that this vision is slowly fructifying into a reality. The SA20, has not only unearthed gems, but has also played a major role in revitalizing our national teams across all formats.One of the most exciting aspects has been its ability to give young talent a platform to showcase their skills. . Players like Lhuan-dre Pretorius, Dewald Brevis, Tristan Stubbs, these players have become household names in South Africa thanks to their performances in the competition. But it’s not just the batters who have shone. The SA20 has also provided a platform for bowlers like Gerald Coetzee , Marco Jansen, Lutho Sipamla and 18-year-old Kwena Maphaka to showcase their skills on a global stage. Coetzee’s raw pace and Jansen’s all-round abilities have been key in South Africa’s recent successes, whereas young Kwena Maphaka has not only impressed in the SA20, but has even gone on to represent the Proteas on the international stage across all three formats.The SA20 has not only captured the imagination of South African fans, but has also been warmly received globally. In India, the league has found a massive audience, with fans tuning in to watch their favourite stars and emerging talents. Having Dinesh Karthik, the first Indian player to feature in the league, justifies that this league is second only to the IPL in terms of competition and quality highlights the remarkable progress made over the past three years. Adding to that, the presence of IPL franchises as owners of SA20 teams has further strengthened the connection between the two cricketing powerhouses.In UK and Australia, the league has been praised for its high-quality cricket and competitive spirit. The involvement of international stars and world-class players like Joe Root, Rashid Khan, Kane Williamson, among others, has added to the league’s appeal, making it truly a major cricket event in the sporting calendar.As we celebrate the milestone of 100 SA20 games, it’s impossible not to feel a sense of pride and optimism for the future. The league has not only brought back the buzz to South African cricket but has also laid the foundation for sustained success. The pipeline of talent is stronger than ever, and the lessons learned from the SA20 are being carried forward into international cricket. The journey hasn’t been easy, but the resilience and determination that define South African cricket have once again come to the fore.To the fans who have stood by us through thick and thin, to the players who have embraced the challenge, and to everyone who has contributed to this success —thank you. As we celebrate 100 games of the SA20, it is a moment to reflect on the journey we have had. Much like the vibrant colours of South Africa, the energy and passion of this league will always shine bright, uniting us in positivity and spirit for many more seasons to come. I could not be more excited to see where this journey takes us!",Graeme smith is the commissioner of the sa20 cricket league. The league is celebrating its 100th game this season.

'Nothing new': Rohit Sharma on his struggles ahead of England ODIs

NEW DELHI Cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar shared an amusing anecdote about former teammate Virender Sehwag during an event at Rashtrapati Bhavan . Tendulkar revealed that to bring out the best in Sehwag, he often had to say the opposite of what he actually wanted.Tendulkar graced the Rashtrapati Bhavan Vimarsh Shrinkhala event on Thursday, where esteemed personalities share their life experiences. He was a personal guest of President Droupadi Murmu and presented her with a signed Indian Test jersey. Accompanied by his wife Anjali and daughter Sara, Tendulkar spoke about the invaluable lessons sport teaches.""Sport treats everyone equally. You may be in good form while someone else isn’t, and vice versa. As a team, you must stick together through good and bad times, trusting your partner,"" he remarked.Tendulkar captivated the audience with anecdotes from his playing days, illustrating how understanding teammates was crucial.With Sehwag, he revealed an amusing strategy: ""Viru would always do the opposite of what I wanted. So, if I wanted him to defend, I’d tell him to go smash the bowlers. He’d then say, ‘No paaji, I should defend for four overs first,’ and I would smile, knowing I got what I wanted.""He also recalled a conversation with Yuvraj Singh before the 2011 World Cup , when the left-hander seemed low on energy.""Yuvi told me he wasn’t timing the ball well. I advised him to forget about batting and focus on fielding, setting small goals. I told him, ‘Yuvi, you will matter when it matters.’ That brought the spark back in his strides.""Tendulkar recounted a pivotal Test match against New Zealand when Chris Cairns was reversing the ball dangerously.""In some conditions, it’s tough to spot the shiny side. Cairns was beating us, and the match was critical. I told Rahul Dravid, ‘I’ll hold the bat in one hand — you gauge the swing.’ When Cairns bowled cross-seam, I adjusted accordingly. That trust helped us survive.""While Tendulkar has visited Rashtrapati Bhavan multiple times to receive honours, this was his first as a guest of the President.""We spoke about the Hockey World Cup in Bhubaneswar, which I watched with my friend Dilip Tirkey. We also discussed Odisha’s cuisine. Walking through the corridors of Rashtrapati Bhavan and seeing portraits of our freedom fighters gave me goosebumps,"" he said.Widely regarded as one of cricket’s greatest players, Tendulkar holds the record for the most runs in both Tests (15,921) and ODIs (18,426), along with 100 international centuries. Honoured with the Bharat Ratna in 2014, his legacy continues to inspire generations.",Sachin tendulkar was a guest of president droupadi murmu at an event at rashtrapati bhavan.

Will Rohit Sharma win another ICC trophy? Here's what the horoscope says

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
NEW DELHI: Former Australia captain Ricky Ponting believes the focus now shifts to Mohammed Shami as he returns from injury in India's ongoing limited-overs series against England. Shami, who last played for India, before the England series, in the ICC Men's Cricket World Cup final in November 2023, is seen as a crucial asset for the team ahead of the upcoming ICC Men's Champions Trophy ""My biggest concern about India when they came for Australia in the Test series was [Jasprit] Bumrah not having Shami there as a backup and him having to burden most of the load,"" Ponting said on The ICC Review.""And that's probably what happened, and might even have something to do with why he [Bumrah] got hurt. He probably ended up having to bowl a bit more in that series with Shami not being there.""So look, if Shami's fit, that's a positive.""Shami made his return in the third and fourth T20Is against England, putting up an impressive performance with figures of 3/25 in his latest outing.Former India head coach and cricketer Ravi Shastri emphasised the importance of managing Shami's workload in the upcoming ODI series against England.""It will be interesting to see if India play him out in all three, or they give him the first one and the third one, and then ease him into the Champions Trophy ,"" Shastri said.""But he'll be watched very closely because 10 overs is totally different to four overs, and then you're going to see how he pulls up in the field as well having bowled those 10 overs.""Shami's form and fitness will be crucial for India as they begin their ICC Men's Champions Trophy campaign against Bangladesh on February 20 in Dubai. With Bumrah already handling a significant workload, the return of a fully fit Shami could provide India with much-needed bowling depth and balance ahead of a crucial tournament.","Former australia captain ricky ponting believes the focus now shifts to mohammed shami as he returns from injury.

NEW DELHI: India's star all-rounder Hardik Pandya is brimming with confidence. He is eager to step onto the field, send the ball soaring into the stands, and rattle the stumps with his fiery bowling. Known for turning games on their head, Hardik Pandya is all set for the highly anticipated ICC Champions Trophy in Pakistan and Dubai, starting from February 19.India will play all their ICC Champions Trophy matches at the Dubai International Stadium, beginning their campaign against Bangladesh on February 20.The much-awaited clash against arch-rivals Pakistan is set for February 23, followed by their final league-stage encounter against New Zealand on March 2.In an interview shared by the International Cricket Council (ICC) on Wednesday, Pandya reminisced about the electrifying 2022 T20 World Cup showdown between India and Pakistan in Melbourne - a match India won by four wickets.Having claimed three wickets in that game, the allrounder reflected on how he handled the immense pressure of the high-stakes encounter against Pakistan.""It is just about who handles pressure better. I don't play for Hardik Pandya; I play for the team. I play for India—that's the goal. Whether that means playing just two balls at the end or batting for 60 balls, the focus is on taking the game ball by ball and getting closer to victory. Let’s see who cracks under pressure,"" Pandya told in an interview posted by ICC.India began their T20 World Cup campaign against Pakistan, winning the toss and electing to field in front of a packed crowd at the iconic Melbourne Cricket Ground.""When I entered the field and saw the atmosphere—the kind of energy the fans and spectators were bringing—it was just amazing. I had to take a moment to absorb it. Even though I have played many games, it was overwhelming in a way that made me both excited and happy. The atmosphere for this match, especially since it was India vs. Pakistan, just took everything up a notch. This rivalry has existed for years. While we have intense competition on the field, there are also so many emotions involved. The engagement, the excitement—it's a clash that people remember and eagerly wait for.""My plan was very simple: to back my strengths and be smart about it. In the first two balls I bowled, I got a little too excited by the Australian bounce and the wicket. As a result, I bowled a couple of deliveries that turned out to be boundary balls in those conditions. When I came in for my second spell, we obviously needed wickets. I was aware that they were going to put the accelerator on and try to score boundaries to reach a decent total. That’s when I realized that sticking to good balls would be the key.""I have always been someone who relies on good length and lines—that is my strength. I definitely don’t have the variations or skill set of Jasprit Bumrah , but I do possess Hardik Pandya’s skill set. For me, bowling back-of-a-length deliveries has always been a strength. It's more about gamesmanship, awareness, and using my skills effectively.""I was aggressive—I wanted to take wickets. My mindset was: ‘If you want to hit me, hit me off a good ball.’ That approach helped me take those two wickets. Just before that, I had kept the mid-on and mid-wicket fielders up, but for that particular ball, I sent one fielder back because I sensed he was going to go after me. I knew where my deliveries were landing and where the most likely scoring areas were—especially mid-wicket. Taking those wickets was quite satisfying,"" Pandya, who dismissed Shadab Khan, Haider Ali and Mohammad Nawaz, said.India secured a thrilling four-wicket victory, driven by Virat Kohli 's masterful unbeaten 82 off 53 balls.","India's star all-rounder hardik pandya is brimming with confidence.

NAGPUR: For 1,130 days, Virat Kohli had been immune to the wear and tear which sidelines even the toughest athletes. Until Thursday. At Jamtha, as India geared up for the first ODI against England, Kohli walked in with his right knee heavily strapped.He moved with a slightly lower intensity, hobbled a bit with physio Kamlesh Jain keeping a close watch on his movements. But it didn't seem the injury will keep him out.Which is why even when Yashasvi Jaiswal was handed the India cap, along with Harshit Rana, no one thought it would come at the expense of an injured Kohli. It did though.It wasn't until Rohit Sharma confirmed Kohli's absence at the toss that the reality sank in - India's batting mainstay had been rested. The injury may not have seemed serious at first, but with the Champions Trophy on the horizon, his fitness is now a concern.According to sources in the team's support staff, the decision to rest Kohli was taken late on Wednesday night. ""His right knee was fine during practice, but once we got back to the hotel, it swelled up,"" a team insider told TOI. ""It doesn't seem that bad though. He will play the Cuttack ODI in all likelihood,"" he added.The 36-year-old hasn't yet been taken for scans. It will be interesting to see whether Kohli will leave for Bengaluru for a quick check-up at the National Cricket Academy (NCA) or accompany the team to Cuttack for the next game.It was a rare moment of vulnerability for a cricketer whose supreme fitness has been his armour for 17 years.The last time Kohli missed a game due to injury was in 2022, when an upper back spasm kept him out of a Test against South Africa. Before that, in 2021, a stiff back saw him sidelined for a warm-up match against Select County XI. And in 2017, he sat out the fourth Test against Australia after a valiant attempt to stop a boundary in Ranchi left him nursing a right shoulder injury.India are already sweating over the fitness of pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah who suffered back spasms during the final Test of India's Australia tour last month. He has since been out of action with captain Rohit Sharma revealing the team is awaiting the result of a scan following which a call will be taken whether the pacer will feature in the third ODI of the England series.","Star batter misses first odi with sore knee.

'It’s a slightly two-paced pitch': Harshit Rana after claiming three-wicket haul on ODI debut

England have confirmed they will face Afghanistan in the Champions Trophy match scheduled for February 26 in Lahore, despite British politicians urging for a boycott.The England and Wales Cricket Board made this decision after discussions with the UK government, ICC, and England players, despite over 160 British politicians calling for the match to be cancelled.The boycott calls stemmed from the Taliban regime's ban on female sports participation since their return to power in 2021, which violates ICC regulations. However, the men's team is still permitted to compete.ECB chairman Richard Thompson said: ""We remain of the view that a coordinated international response by the cricketing community is the appropriate way forward, and will achieve more than any unilateral action by the ECB in boycotting this match.""He further added: ""We have also heard that for many ordinary Afghans, watching their cricket team is one of the few remaining sources of enjoyment. As such, we can confirm that we will play this fixture.""Afghanistan have shown significant improvement in limited-overs cricket, currently ranked eighth in ODI rankings, just below England who are seventh.The tournament will take place from February 19 to March 9 across Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates. Both teams are placed in Group B alongside Australia and South Africa in this 50-over competition.","England will play afghanistan in the champions trophy on february 26.

'We didn't play well, performance was below par': Robin Singh on MI Emirates' loss

NEW DELHI: Tim Seifert 's explosive cameo powered Sharjah Warriorz to a stunning six-wicket victory over defending champions MI Emirates in the high-stakes ILT20 Season 3 Eliminator at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium on Thursday. Seifert’s unbeaten 40 off 20 balls, combined with Tim Southee’s crucial two-wicket haul, propelled Sharjah a step closer to the title.

This marks a historic milestone for Sharjah Warriorz, as they have reached this stage of the tournament for the first time.Seifert, who bagged the Player of the Match award, said the team is now focussing on the Qualifier 2 where they will face Desert Vipers on Friday.""Always nice to get to that winning position. Our bowlers though did very well to get them to just 150. We did very well to pull him (Pooran) back and then the momentum shifted for us. The bowlers have been superb all tournament, the way they use the new ball has been outstanding. (On Southee) He has done a great job for the Black Caps, always nice to play with your teammates. Just tried to be positive and putting pressure on them, they bowled very well and made things tough. Big semi-final coming, hopefully we can make it to the final,"" Seifert said after the match.Following MI Emirates’ exit, head coach Robin Singh admitted that the team’s performance was below par in the crucial match, adding that the players lost their wickets too easily.""Of course, we didn't play well. We were below par. I think the par score on this wicket was probably around 175. I thought we lost the game in the middle. I mean, we can't be 105 for 6 in 14 overs, you know. Most of the guys got out pretty softly, to be honest. I think we needed a bit more common sense in our batting, but that didn't happen,"" Robin said after the match.""Look, we have good players, but at the end of the day, everyone needs to perform. We had some really good performances—Tom (Banton) was exceptional, Farooqi bowled well, and the two UAE boys did well. Nicholas also played well. But to win a tournament, you need a team effort. You need eight to ten players consistently delivering strong performances,"" he said.",Sharjah warriorz beat defending champions mi emirates by six wickets.

Season 2 of the Indian Street Premier League ( ISPL ), India’s pioneering tennis-ball T10 cricket tournament held inside a stadium, continues to captivate fans with its remarkable blend of cricket and entertainment. The opening week received plenty of plaudits not just from aficionados of the game, but also from the cricket fraternity along with the almost-packed Dadoji Kondadev Stadium in Thane.Former India stars Rudra Pratap Singh and Mohammad Kaif , who have been closely following the action from the commentary box, have been particularly surprised by the reception that the ISPL has received. Kaif, known for his heroics in the 2002 NatWest Series triumph, lavished praise on the competition for providing hidden talent national exposure and financial security through a well-structured professional platform.“Tennis-ball cricket is in our genes. You take Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Virender Sehwag, and even Sachin Tendulkar – all played tennis-ball cricket growing up. Sachin Tendulkar once practiced with a wet tennis ball before matches. It’s heartening to see the growing recognition of tennis-ball cricket, and leagues like ISPL providing players with the exposure and financial support they deserve,” Kaif said.“The ISPL is a great platform for young cricketers. Not only does it give them exposure, but it also helps prepare them for larger platforms like first-class cricket and even the IPL. The league’s unique format and fresh rules make it a great spectacle for fans and players alike,” he added.Meanwhile, RP Singh, who played a crucial role in India’s 2007 T20 World Cup triumph, termed ISPL as the game-changer for tennis-ball cricketers across the country.“Those who aspire to be a pace bowler starting from a young age, usually start with a tennis ball. Majority of the cricketers’ transition from playing gully cricket, but to organize that in a format like this is commendable,” he said.“The journey from trials, selection to auction [in the ISPL] is smooth and I think the players are blessed to be playing in such a well-structured tournament. The financial stability and recognition the league is bringing to the players are praiseworthy. Earlier they were restricted to their localities only and there was no such financial stability, but it is certainly changing with the league,” he explained.Reminiscing about their early days, Kaif and RP Singh shared fond memories of playing tennis-ball cricket.“I used to play tennis-ball cricket in my early days in Allahabad. Of course it was not in a large stadium like this, we played on the street. Whenever it’d rain, you wouldn’t find us in home. We’d all come out on the street and play our hearts out. We all know there are different rules in tennis-ball cricket and they vary from place to place. I think those limitations shape your cricket skills,” Kaif said.“My journey from Rae Bareilly to international cricket was long but I also had fair bit of experiences playing tennis ball. You learn many things like team bonding, and for being in smaller teams, the excitement level is always high. The very first taste of joy any cricketer gets is from playing tennis-ball cricket,” RP Singh recalled.With a structured format, intense competition and national-level recognition, ISPL has been revolutionising tennis-ball cricket in India. Season 2 witnessed a mammoth 30-lakh registrations and the league is set to conduct trials in 101 cities for the third edition. The final is set to take place on February 15.",Season 2 of the indian street premier league ( ispl) has begun. The tennis-ball t10 cricket tournament is held inside a stadium.
