Bangladesh seek T20 WC match shift from India after Mustafizur Rahman's IPL exit

A senior Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) official’s comment calling former captain Tamim Iqbal ""an Indian agent"" has drawn criticism from players in the country. Tamim, one of Bangladesh’s leading openers, had advised the BCB not to be driven by emotion while deciding on the national team’s participation in the T20 World Cup in India.Nazmul, chairman of the BCB finance committee, made the remark in a Facebook post.""This time, the people of Bangladesh witnessed, with their own eyes, the emergence of yet another proven Indian agent,"" he wrote.The post received immediate backlash from former and current cricketers, including Taskin Ahmed, Mominul Haque, and Taijul Islam.The Cricketers’ Welfare Association of Bangladesh (CWAB) also expressed concern.""A comment made by BCB director M Nazmul Islam regarding former national captain Tamim Iqbal has come to the attention of the Cricketers' Welfare Association of Bangladesh. We are stunned, shocked, and outraged by it. Such a remark by a board official about the most successful opener in Bangladesh's history, who represented the country for 16 years, is utterly condemnable.""""Not only because it concerns a player like Tamim, but such comments about any cricketer of the country are unacceptable and insulting to the entire cricketing community,"" the players’ body said in a statement.The 36-year-old Tamim played 70 Tests, 243 ODIs, and 78 T20 Internationals for Bangladesh.""We strongly protest against this comment. When a responsible board director makes such remarks on a public platform, it also raises serious questions about the code of conduct of board officials,"" CWAB said.""We have already submitted a protest letter to the BCB president, demanding a public apology from the concerned board director and that he be brought under accountability. We hope the BCB president will take appropriate action as soon as possible,"" the statement added.Bangladesh had written to the International Cricket Council requesting their T20 World Cup games be moved out of India after the BCCI asked IPL franchise Kolkata Knight Riders to release Mustafizur Rahman ahead of the 2026 edition.""Cricket is the life of Bangladesh. A recent comment surrounding a former national captain who has made a major contribution to the game has caused many to reflect,"" said pacer Taskin.""I believe that such remarks directed at a former cricketer of the country are not helpful in the interest of Bangladesh cricket. I hope the concerned authorities will consider the matter seriously and adopt a more responsible stance in the future,"" he added.In 2007, Tamim’s half-century had helped Bangladesh eliminate India from the ODI World Cup in the Caribbean.Former Bangladesh captain Mominul said Nazmul’s remarks were unacceptable.""The comment made by BCB director M Nazmul Islam regarding former national captain Tamim Iqbal is completely unacceptable and insulting to the country's cricketing community. Such behaviour towards a cricketer is in direct conflict with the board's responsibility and ethics,"" Mominul said.""A senior cricketer was not given even the minimum respect; instead, he was deliberately humiliated in public. Such remarks show a lack of even basic decorum regarding where and how to speak while holding such a high responsibility.""I strongly condemn this comment and firmly demand a public apology from the concerned director and that he be brought under accountability. I call upon the BCB to take swift and strict action,"" he added.","Bangladesh cricket board (bcb) official m nazmul islam called former captain tamim iqbal ""an indian agent"" in a facebook post.

“Don’t get mad”: Travis Kelce’s mom Donna reveals how her future daughter-in-law Taylor Swift shaped her mindset,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/dont-get-mad-travis-kelces-mom-donna-reveals-how-her-future-daughter-in-law-taylor-swift-shaped-her-mindset/articleshow/126464844.cms,"Donna Kelce revealed that music by her future daughter-in-law Taylor Swift helped shape her strategy on The Traitors. Drawing inspiration from Swift’s song “Vigilante S**t,” Donna embraced a confident mindset while competing on the reality show, calling the experience a meaningful chance to reinvent herself later in life.

Donna Kelce finds reality TV inspiration in Taylor Swift’s music

Donna Kelce has spent years cheering from NFL suites, but her latest spotlight came far from a football field. The mother of Travis Kelce stepped into a different kind of pressure cooker with her appearance on The Traitors, and she credits an unexpected source for helping her survive the mind games.As alliances formed and suspicion filled the Scottish castle, Donna leaned on the music of Taylor Swift . What started as casual listening turned into a mindset shift, one that helped her navigate deception, strategy, and social tension on reality television.During the Season 4 premiere, Donna revealed that Swift’s 2022 track “Vigilante S**t” played a role in shaping her approach. She summed up her game plan with a sharp line, “Don’t get mad, get even.” The phrase mirrors Swift’s lyric, “Don’t get sad, get even,” and Donna admitted it helped her stay focused rather than emotional as the competition intensified.Donna joined the show after encouragement from her sons, including Jason Kelce, both longtime fans of the series. “They’re so excited,” she said, describing their reaction when she told them she was in.Filmed inside a castle in Scotland and hosted by Alan Cumming, The Traitors challenges contestants to lie, build alliances, and outlast one another for a prize of up to $250,000.For Donna, the experience represented more than a TV appearance. It marked a personal turning point.“I never thought in a million years I would get this chance,” Donna said. “When you get to a certain part in your life, and your kids are starting their own families, it’s so important to reinvent yourself. Do the things you’ve always dreamt of and that’s how I ended up in Scotland.”She also joked about potential awkward encounters, including running into rivals connected to her sons. Yet the nerves did not outweigh the excitement.Donna is also connected to Swift since October 2023, when the singer appeared on stage the first time in a collaboration with her at Arrowhead Stadium. Their worlds have since that time remained in unanticipated ways of intersecting.Pointed neither at the field chocolate barricades nor atop the Scottish castle, the path of Donna Kelce demonstrates that having confidence, breaking molds, and a carefully crafted soundtrack will open the door at any age.Also Read: “I don't want to”: Travis Kelce’s wedding rule for Taylor Swift is already raising eyebrows","Donna kelce revealed that music by her future daughter-in-law taylor swift helped shape her strategy on the traitors.

Dennis Schroder faces a three-game suspension without pay. The athlete was involved in a post-game feud with the Los Angeles Lakers’ star Luka Doncic. Following the suspension, several NBA personalities have reflected on the decision. The Lakers’ coach, JJ Redick, also cleverly weighed in with his opinion on the matter. He refused to make an explicit statement and tagged the entire incident “a league matter.”On December 28, Dennis and Luka had a back-and-forth against each other during the second half of the game. Post the game, Dennis went towards Luka and tried to confront him on the issue. It was 40 minutes after the game had ended. However, the officials intervened and later they concluded that the Sacramento Kings star had attempted to strike Doncic.The Los Angeles Lakers coach, JJ Redick, has always been careful with his statements. Even if it involved players from his own team. Recently, a controversy involved the star player Luka Doncic and the Sacramento Kings' athlete Dennis Schroder. The latter player even had to face a three-game suspension following the incident on December 28. While comments from within the NBA are coming in on the incident, JJ Redick had a totally different approach to it.When asked about Schroder’s suspension, he simply stated, “I mean, look, it’s just a league matter. So I don’t really have a comment on it. They made the decision. It’s up to them.” With this statement, the Lakers’ coach steered away from getting involved in the controversy.Dennis Schroder’s reaction to his three-game suspension was rather amusing. The player did not showcase any signs of worry. Rather, his response to the entire incident seemed like the athlete was not very worried about the suspension. ESPN’s Shams Charania posted on Instagram, providing fans with an update on the action taken against the athlete. Reacting to the post, Dennis simply wrote, “Attempting,” followed by a laughing emoji.ESPN’s Anthony Slater stated that the incident was not just a post-game issue. Both Dennis and Luka were seen involved in verbal exchanges during the second half of the game. Luka reportedly brought up the topic of contracts with Dennis. The Lakers’ star believed that Dennis should have signed the 4-year, $82 million contract offered to him from the Los Angeles team.",Dennis schroder faces a three-game suspension without pay.

New England Patriots playoff return reflects Drake Maye’s steady rise



Drake Maye’s Wife Ann Michael (Instagram)

New England Patriots football feels different again in Foxborough, and that change is impossible to ignore the moment you step near Gillette Stadium. For the first time since the Tom Brady era, the Patriots are hosting a playoff game with a new face leading the huddle. Drake Maye’s rise has been fast, confident, and quietly dominant. As the Wild Card spotlight sharpens, the energy around this team is not frantic or loud. It is measured. Focused. The kind of mood that usually surrounds contenders who believe they belong here.That confidence spilled beyond the field before kickoff. Long before the first snap against the Los Angeles Chargers, Ann Michael Maye caught attention with a polished, playoff-ready look that felt symbolic. Calm on the surface. Sharp underneath. In a building built on legacy, the message was subtle but clear. This era is comfortable owning its moment.Drake Maye did not drag the Patriots back into January football with noise or bravado. He did it with control. The second-year quarterback put together a season that demanded national respect, throwing for 4,394 yards with 31 touchdowns against just eight interceptions.Those numbers mattered, but his command mattered more. The offense rarely looked rushed. Mistakes were limited. Situations stayed manageable.That poise showed again in the regular-season finale against Miami, when Maye threw only 18 passes while the Patriots ran for 243 yards. It was a quiet flex. A team confident enough to win without forcing anything. That balance is why New England secured the No. 2 seed and why belief inside the locker room feels earned, not manufactured.Off the field, Ann Michael Maye has built her own presence. Her baking videos became a hit, her Patriots-themed cookies turning into game-week rituals for fans. On Saturday, January 10, she announced her new project, the “Beyond Bakemas” show, reinforcing that her growing profile stands on its own. Then came a simple Instagram post hours before kickoff. “Happy Gameday”. Two words that matched the team’s mindset perfectly.Sunday night brings pressure. This is Maye’s first playoff start. The Chargers bring a defense that thrives on collapsing pockets and speeding up decisions. But their offense enters banged up, while New England stayed sharp. If the Patriots control the line early and Maye stays patient, the path forward opens.Win and the season continues at home. Lose and it ends. The calm tone around this team suggests they understand exactly what is at stake and feel ready for it.Also Read: What happened between A.J.

Dave Roberts’ career, contracts, and estimated net worth

Tricia Roberts' contribution beyond baseball to the household’s financial balance

Dave Roberts is one of the most esteemed figures in Major League Baseball today. Not only because of his intuitive leadership qualities on the field, but more specifically because he has managed to leverage his existence in the realm of baseball into long-term financial prosperity. As the Dodgers’ manager in Los Angeles, he has led his side to take home World Series Championships on more than one occasion. In doing so, he has not only earned championships; he has earned hefty financial rewards reflective of his own future earnings in the game.Outside the realm of professional sports and especially baseball, the renowned name in baseball, Dave Roberts, has diversified his business enterprise through the appointment of his wife, Tricia Roberts. In 2025, the total net worth of the Roberts family is evidence that career successes and marriage-related financial ventures can mix to form financial prosperity balanced equally to that of the lineup formulated during the Dodgers’ games.The career path of Dave Roberts, from an MLB player to a championship-winning manager, has also been a steep financial upward climb. As of 2025, his current net worth is approximately $15 million, which includes income from his playing career, managerial income, commercial deals, and investments.Roberts recently extended his contract with the Dodgers in March 2025 for a term of four years and $32.4 million, which not only recognizes the innovative manager’s achievement but also ranks Roberts among the best-paid managers in baseball, with an average annual income of approximately $8.1 million.ID@undefinedCaption not available.ID@undefinedCaption not available.The Dodgers’ faith in Roberts is not a small change-up. Roberts-led Dodgers have charged into several World Series championships, including the ones in 2020 and 2024, and sport one of the highest winning percentages for a manager in the history of Major League Baseball. These championships not only adorn the trophy shelf but are also laced with performance bonuses, long-term job security in contract agreements, as well as opportunities for endorsement tours, all of which contribute significantly toward their off-the-field wealth.While Dave Roberts manages the pitching rotation, Dave's wife, Tricia Roberts, has found another niche altogether, away from baseball. Tricia and Dave dated in high school, married in 1997, and Tricia's expertise today is that of an interior designer with her own design company. But this isn’t all, since Tricia is also certified in wine, being a certified wine specialist, and also owns her own company, 'Red Stitch Wine,' along with her husband Dave and friends.As for Tricia’s individual net worth, it does not appear in the open literature; however, her ventures as a creative professional and as a shareholder of Red Stitch Wine add quite a bit to the Davies’ financial well-being. The overall 2025 net worth of Dave Davies’s wife, Tricia Davies, represents a combination of the Davies’ great wealth as a result of their excellent baseball performance, as well as their astuteness in their side ventures, along with the synergy displayed in their professional as well as their marital lives.Also Read: Kevin McGonigle contract details in 2025: What the Tigers prospect is earning in MLB today","Dave roberts is one of the most esteemed figures in major league baseball today.

George Kittle injury sparks panic in San Francisco as tight end leaves Eagles game on a cart,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/george-kittle-injury-sparks-panic-in-san-francisco-as-tight-end-leaves-eagles-game-on-a-cart/articleshow/126473216.cms,"George Kittle Achilles Injury vs Eagles (Getty Images)

George Kittle injury sparks concern and questions across San Francisco



George Kittle stood at the center of a moment that instantly shifted the mood of a high-stakes playoff afternoon. The San Francisco 49ers tight end went down in Philadelphia, and the energy inside Lincoln Financial Field changed from ruthless noise to uneasy silence. In a season already defined by attrition, the sight of one of San Francisco’s emotional leaders being carted off felt heavy, personal, and unsettling for both sidelines.The play itself looked ordinary until it was not. One cut. One push. One sudden collapse. What followed was a reminder of how quickly football strips control from even its toughest stars. As Kittle clapped and saluted the crowd, the focus moved beyond the scoreboard and toward what his absence could mean for the game, the locker room, and a fan base already worn thin by injuries.George Kittle suffered the injury on his only catch of the day, a short completion from Brock Purdy that ended with Eagles safety Marcus Epps dragging him down. When Kittle tried to drive off his right leg, it gave way. He stayed on the turf, grabbing at his leg while trainers rushed out. Minutes later, the cart arrived, and the 49ers ruled him out for the rest of the game with an Achilles injury.Even in pain, Kittle stayed himself. He clapped. He saluted.The Philadelphia crowd, known for its hostility, responded with applause. That atmosphere is something Kittle has spoken about openly, once saying, “The one thing that’s really unique about Philly is that … any road team that goes in there, they hate all of us equally, and I just appreciate that,” before adding, “It’s incredibly loud, they flip you off, they moon you on the bus ride in, but they do that to anybody. … They just give you that no matter what, and I appreciate that because you can tell how much they love their team.”The injury cuts deeper because of Kittle’s season-long battle to stay on the field. He played just 11 games, missed time with ankle issues, and still produced 628 yards and seven touchdowns on 57 catches, earning his seventh Pro Bowl selection. That resilience is why the reaction has been so sharp.On social media, frustration quickly turned toward the organization’s training and medical operations. Fans are not just grieving a loss. They are questioning patterns. While injuries are part of football, losing cornerstone players week after week has left supporters searching for accountability.Now, everything hinges on medical evaluations and recovery timelines. An Achilles injury carries uncertainty, especially for a 32-year-old tight end who plays with relentless physicality. For the 49ers, the challenge is larger than replacing a stat line.

Epic Battle! Judd Trump vs Barry Hawkins The Masters 2025

Masters snooker 2026 prize money and how Judd Trump and Shaun Murphy can win big

The Masters Snooker 2026 event is returning to Alexandra Palace with a heavy emphasis on prizes and prestige. Defending champion Shaun Murphy will be returning to defend his title, whilst World Number 1 Judd Trump will be looking to put an end to his latest trophy drought. With a combined prize fund of over £1m and no presence from Ronnie O'Sullivan this year either, all eyes will be on the strongest contenders at Apolly's Palace for this year's tournament.Judd Trump is heading to the Masters in 2026 and gives urgency to his campaign for the title. As the current World Number 1, Trump has continued his unprecedented 2021 season with great expectations for a strong performance on one of snooker's biggest stages, given that he has not won anything over the past 12 months. If Trump can make a deep run in North London, it will help him regain momentum and reinforce his position as the best snooker player.Shaun Murphy is coming to the Masters as the defending champion. Murphy won the title in January of last year and has confidence and expectations after winning that trophy with his composed 10-7 final victory. As he attempts to defend his title at the Masters, Murphy faces the unique challenge of balancing composure with aggression as he works through each round.Murphy's sitting on the fence while waiting for each round will be a difficult balance to maintain.The fact that Ronnie O'Sullivan won't be participating has also changed the dynamic of the tournament. O'Sullivan withdrew from the tournament for medical reasons for a second year in a row, and this has affected the tournament by making Judd Trump and Shaun Murphy the only ""established"" contenders left in the field.The Masters Snooker in 2026 offers a considerable amount of prize money, which has put Judd Trump and Shaun Murphy firmly in the spotlight. The total prize fund is £1,015,000, with the winning player receiving £350,000 and the runner-up receiving £140,000. Semi-finalists will earn £75,000, and quarter-finalists will receive £40,000.Players who reach the first round will receive £25,000, and an extra £15,000 will be awarded for the highest break achieved in the tournament.

Injury setbacks rock Bears’ playoff hopes



Bears turn to depth as pressure mounts

Also Read:

The Chicago Bears’ dramatic Wild Card win over the Green Bay Packers came at a heavy cost, with the franchise suffering a brutal injury setback that could define its playoff run. Linebacker T.J. Edwards and offensive tackle Ozzy Trapilo have both been ruled out for the remainder of the postseason.The Bears pulled off an emotional comeback at Soldier Field, keeping their Super Bowl hopes alive. However, the celebrations were short-lived once head coach Ben Johnson confirmed that both starters suffered season-ending injuries during the game.Edwards, a key leader in the middle of Chicago’s defense, went down in the third quarter. Medical evaluations later revealed a fractured fibula, an injury that immediately ended his postseason availability. Edwards had been one of the Bears’ most consistent performers all season, providing stability, communication, and physicality at linebacker.Trapilo’s injury followed late in the fourth quarter, delivering another tough blow. The young offensive tackle exited with a patellar tendon injury, which Johnson described as serious enough to rule him out for the rest of the playoffs.Trapilo had taken over the left tackle role late in the regular season and quickly became a crucial part of the offensive line rotation.With Edwards sidelined, the responsibility now shifts to D’Marco Jackson, who stepped in after the injury against Green Bay. Jackson has shown flashes when given extended snaps and even earned NFC Defensive Player of the Week honors earlier in the season. Still, replacing Edwards’ experience and on-field leadership will be a major challenge in a high-stakes playoff environment.On offense, Chicago must reshuffle its line to protect the quarterback against elite postseason defenses. Theo Benedet is expected to be the next man up at left tackle. The Bears also have Braxton Jones available after his return from injured reserve, but he has yet to see game action following a long absence, making his usage uncertain.Chicago’s playoff run has been built on resilience, physical defense, and timely execution. Losing two starters one on defense and one on offense tests that formula at the worst possible moment. While the Bears remain confident in their depth, there is no denying that Edwards and Trapilo leave significant gaps.As the Bears prepare for the divisional round, the focus now shifts from celebration to survival. January football rarely forgives injuries, and Chicago will need contributions from every corner of its roster to keep its postseason dream alive.","T.j. edwards and ozzy trapilo have been ruled out for the remainder of the postseason.

India have begun their three-match series against New Zealand at the Kotambi Stadium in Vadodara.As the first match got underway, fans noticed that all-rounder Hardik Pandya was missing from the Indian playing XI.New Zealand won the toss and decided to bat first. As both teams took the field, the absence of Hardik Pandya became a major talking point.The main reason Hardik Pandya is not playing is that he was not selected in India’s ODI squad for this series.The decision was taken by the BCCI and the Centre of Excellence (CoE). Pandya was not cleared by the CoE to bowl a full spell of 10 overs in an ODI match. This raised concerns about his workload and fitness.Although Hardik Pandya did bowl 10 overs recently in the Vijay Hazare Trophy 2025-26, the team management does not want to take any risks.With the T20 World Cup 2026 getting closer, BCCI wants to make sure that Pandya remains fully fit for the big tournament.He is considered a key player for India in T20 cricket. And managing his fitness now appears to be a top priority.Instead of rushing him back into ODIs, the selectors have decided to rest him and focus on long-term goals.At the toss, Indian captain Shubman Gill spoke about the team’s plans and the playing combination.Gill said, “We will bowl first.Try different combinations, try to see which suits us best, a challenge to bowl under dew. Looks like it will be a bit easier to bat under lights with the dew coming in. Playing a bit of VH matches, everyone looks in good form. The environment is good in the team. We'[re going with 6 bowlers.Sundar, Jadeja and Kuldeep the spinner. Siraj, Prasidh and Harshit the pacers.”India have gone with a strong XI that includes a mix of experienced players and young talent.

NEW DELHI: India’s premier all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja was seen putting in additional work during a specialised training session ahead of the first ODI against New Zealand at the Kotambi Stadium.In a video shared by the BCCI on Sunday, Jadeja was seen engaging in an innovative bowling drill. The all-rounder repeatedly landed the ball between different coloured cones placed on the pitch, following instructions from bowling coach Morne Morkel, who closely supervised and guided the session.""Coach gave me a task: by the trigger, when I am going to pitch the ball, he will name the colour blue, green and red. He will pick from all three, and I have to pitch the ball closer to that colour with accuracy, like a normal match pitch.""And in between, he also kept two blue coloured balls for the full ball. So, at the same time, he will tell me where to pitch the ball at the last moment,"" Jadeja said while explaining the practice.Jadeja heads into the series with form, fitness and confidence firmly on his side. The experienced all-rounder has looked sharp in domestic cricket this month, scoring an unbeaten 52 against Gujarat before following it up with a knock of 36 and figures of 1 for 48 against Services in the Vijay Hazare Trophy.The left-hander also boasts an impressive ODI record against New Zealand, built over a span of 15 years. Jadeja has amassed 386 runs in 16 matches against the Black Caps at an average of 48.25, while also claiming 10 wickets in those outings.After missing the ODI series against Australia, Jadeja made a return to the format during the home series against South Africa, producing a strong all-round performance.Following the series opener in Kotambi, the second ODI will be played at the Niranjan Shah Stadium in Rajkot on January 14, while the third and final match will take place at the Holkar Stadium in Indore on January 18.",Ravindra jadeja was seen putting in extra work during a specialised training session ahead of the first odi against new zealand.
