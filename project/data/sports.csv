Ruturaj Gaikwad press conference: Reveals Gautam Gambhir message, No.4 and more

Poll Do you believe Kohli can maintain this form for the upcoming matches? Yes, he can No, it's temporary I'm not sure

NEW DELHI: Virat Kohli hasn’t just returned to form — he has set off a nationwide frenzy strong enough to sell out an entire stadium. Back-to-back centuries in Ranchi and Raipur have turned what was shaping up to be a low-interest ODI in Visakhapatnam into the hottest cricket ticket in India this week. According to officials at the Andhra Cricket Association (ACA), Kohli’s stunning run-scoring spree single-handedly reversed sluggish online bookings for the third ODI against South Africa at the Dr. Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy ACA-VDCA Stadium.When tickets first went on sale digitally on November 28, the association braced for a disappointing turnout. The lack of buzz even pushed the ACA towards the rare option of setting up offline ticket counters despite committing to a fully digital system this time. But everything changed the moment Kohli unfurled a spectacular century in Ranchi on November 30. Suddenly, Phase 2 and 3 of ticket sales disappeared in minutes.“The first phase response wasn’t good,” confirmed Y. Venkatesh from ACA’s Media and Operations department to The Indian Express. “After Kohli’s hundred at Ranchi, the second and third phases vanished in minutes. Nothing was left unsold.”It wasn’t just victory that fans chased — it was the chance to witness a phenomenon.Kohli’s numbers in Vizag fuelled the madness: an average of 97.83 in seven ODIs, featuring three centuries and a 99. Even ticket prices ranging from Rs 1,200 to Rs 18,000 couldn’t slow demand.The frenzy spilled into real life, too. Hours before Team India landed in Vizag, hundreds gathered at the airport, waiting through repeated flight delays from Raipur. Security guards were bombarded with one question in multiple languages: “When are they landing?” The answer mattered because Kohli was on board.After his 53rd ODI century in Raipur, cricket legends poured in praise. But the loudest came from Mohammad Kaif, who summed up a nation’s emotion in eight simple words: “Without Kohli cricket is nothing… pure vintage!”","Back-to-back centuries in ranchi and raipur have turned what was shaping up to be a low-interest odi in visakhapatnam into the hottest cricket ticket in india this week.

Cardi B’s gift choices and jewelry twist add drama to Diggs’ big week

Nothing about Stefon Diggs’ birthday weekend was ordinary, and Cardi B made sure of it. After twerking on the New England Patriots receiver during his celebration in Miami, the rapper doubled down with another headline-grabbing moment just a day later. She posted Instagram stories flashing stacks of cash, dancing with friends, and rapping along to her song “Magnet,” turning Sunday into a continuation of the on-going celebration.With the Patriots on a bye week, the Miami nightlife became their temporary stadium, and Cardi wasn’t just a guest, she was the entertainment. From leather-clad looks to neon hair and unapologetically flashy style, the rapper’s energy matched the momentum of Diggs’ high-profile life on and off the field.Cardi’s highlights didn’t stop with Miami clubs, custom chains, and viral dance moves. Diggs received a $10,000 Chanel bag from executives Lori Hirshleifer and Marci Penn, and while the luxury gesture seemed fitting for a star wide receiver, Diggs jokingly hinted at a more practical use as a father.Posting the bag on Instagram, he wrote, “Diaper bag perhaps?

Gautam Gambhir Press Conference: Team India head coach heaves fire after 2-1 ODI series win over SA

NEW DELHI: Virat Kohli has been in exceptional form, scoring 376 runs in his last four ODIs with two centuries and being dismissed only twice. After winning the Player of the Series award for his 302 runs in the three-match series against South Africa, Kohli said he felt liberated and in his best rhythm in years, contributing to India securing their 10th ODI series win out of the last 11 at home.His resurgence follows criticism after recording consecutive ducks in Australia. In the final ODI against South Africa, Kohli scored an unbeaten 65 off 45 balls as India chased down 271 in 39.5 overs.""Honestly, playing the way I have in the series is the most satisfying thing for me. I feel really free in my mind. I haven't played like this in 2-3 years. The whole game is coming together nicely. I've tried to maintain my own standards and make an impact. I know when I can bat like that in the middle, it helps the team a long way. Makes me confident, any situation in the middle, I can handle that and bring it in favour of the team,"" Kohli said.Reflecting on his long journey, the former India captain admitted there were moments of doubt.""When you play for that long - 15-16 years, you do doubt yourself. Especially as a batter when one mistake can get you out. It's a whole journey of self-improvement and personal growth along the way.It improves you as a person, and it improves your temperament as well. I'm just glad that I'm still able to contribute to the team,"" he shared.One standout feature of his recent form has been his six-hitting, with 12 sixes across the three matches and a strike rate above 100 in each outing.""When I play freely, I know I can hit sixes. There are always levels you can always unlock,"" Kohli said about his approach.Kohli, who holds the world record with 53 ODI centuries, rated his 135 in Ranchi as his best knock of the series.""The first one at Ranchi - because I hadn't played a game since Australia. Just how your energy is on the day, Ranchi is very special for me, and I'm very grateful for how these three games have gone,"" he said.Speaking about India stepping up in the deciding match, Kohli highlighted the team’s hunger in pressure moments.""It's always brought the best of us - that's what we want to play for.

How Parker Washington’s absence impacts Jacksonville’s offense?

Jaguars make roster adjustments ahead of Week 14

Also Read:

Jacksonville Jaguars wide receiver Parker Washington will not play in today’s Week 14 matchup against the Indianapolis Colts. The announcement comes after Washington was listed as questionable earlier in the week due to a hip injury suffered during Jacksonville’s win over the Tennessee Titans. Reports from NFL Network's Ian Rapoport on December 7 confirmed that the Jaguars are choosing caution, ruling him out.Washington exited last week’s game early and followed a DNP/limited/limited practice pattern heading into Sunday. Despite progress, the team determined he was not ready to return to full-speed action.Washington has played an important role this season as Jacksonville’s No. 3 wide receiver, contributing both as a pass-catcher and a return specialist. In 12 games so far, he has recorded 36 receptions for 447 yards and three touchdowns, with 23 receptions resulting in first downs. His special teams value has also been notable, adding two punt return touchdowns this year.Without him, the Jaguars will rely on a rotation to fill his role. Tim Patrick, Dyami Brown, and recently elevated receiver Austin Trammell are expected to split snaps behind starters Brian Thomas Jr.and Jakobi Meyers. Trammell is also expected to take over punt return duties.In preparation for Washington’s absence, the Jaguars made several roster moves on December 6. Safety Eric Murray was activated from injured reserve, and wide receiver Austin Trammell and defensive back Cam’Ron Silmon-Craig were elevated from the practice squad.Trammell’s elevation comes only days after he moved back to the practice squad, highlighting the coaching staff’s confidence in him as a depth option.

Lando Norris’ net worth



Lando Norris’ family joins in the celebrations in Abu Dhabi

McLaren star Lando Norris clinched the 2025 F1 World Championship by winning the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix on Sunday. He managed to keep four-time title winner Max Verstappen behind in the Drivers’ Standings, while also dashing teammate Oscar Piastri’s title hopes. Throughout the year, he kept his focus firmly on racing, even keeping his blooming relationship with Margarida “Magui” Corceiro out of the spotlight. Now, as he celebrates his maiden title with his family, here are some off-track details about Norris, including his net worth.Norris moved from the UK to Monaco to stay close to the motorsport hub and his fellow racers. At just 26, the fastest Briton on the current grid had a slow start to the season as his teammate Oscar Piastri registered one win after another. But he eventually picked up momentum in the second half, rising to the top of the Drivers’ Standings. His determination paid off as he went on to win the F1 World Championship just a year after securing his maiden Formula 1 victory in Miami.In 2024, Norris received a contract extension with McLaren and is confirmed to stay with the team until the end of the 2027 season. With McLaren boasting the fastest car on the grid this year, there is little doubt that the new champion would look anywhere else.According to multiple reports, including The Mirror US, he earns approximately $21.35 million annually.Last year, Forbes ranked him third on the 2024 list of Highest Paid F1 Drivers, with total earnings of $35 million, while Max Verstappen topped the list with $74 million.Norris was also named in the 30 Under 30 Europe – Sports category in 2024, the year he finished runner-up in the F1 Championship as Verstappen claimed his fourth title.After the race, Lando Norris’ mother, dressed in an orange kurta and matching hairbands, rushed to him and wrapped him in a celebratory hug. The wholesome moment was shared by F1 as part of the podium celebrations in Abu Dhabi. He also shared a long hug with his Portuguese model Margarida Corceiro, who was dressed in black.A happy Norris said after the race, “It is incredible. It is pretty surreal. I dreamed of this for along, long time - I mean everyone does. A lot goes into a second like this, a lot of ups, a lot of downs. But none of that matters if you come out on top. But I did it with an incredible team. And it is not just this year, the last seven, eight years with McLaren, the last 16, 17 years of my life trying to chase my dream. My best performances this year came when I needed them the most - the second half of the season when I was on the back foot, and I managed to show the best of me. ”Norris also congratulated thanked Verstappen and Piastri for giving him a tough competition.Also Read: Abu Dhabi Grand Prix: Kelly Piquet kisses Max Verstappen as he bags pole; Lando Norris says, “It is tough”","Mclaren star lando norris clinched the 2025 f1 world championship by winning the abu dhabi grand prix on sunday.

Abu Dhabi Grand Prix 2025 final

What were the odds of Lando Norris winning the F1 title?

It was a day for the books at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix as Max Verstappen won the race but Lando Norris won the Formula 1 2025 championship amid a down-to-the-wire fight. Oscar Piastri finished second and Lando Norris finished third in the Sunday race but was enough for the latter to bring in the title. Norris has shown one of the most exemplary examples of consistent performance by winning his first F1 race in Miami last year and winning the championship a year later.Lando Norris was the overall champion even after finishing third at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. He said soon after the race, “I didn't think I would cry but I did. It is a long journey. I want to say a big thanks to my guys, everyone at McLaren, my parents. I now know what Max feels like a little bit! I want to congratulate Max and Oscar as well, it has been a pleasure to race against both of them, and to learn from both of them. But we did it, we did it!”Max Verstappen, 28, won the pole and was followed by Lando Norris, 26, in second and Oscar Piastri, 26, in third. This was one of the most enthralling F1 Championship finals in a decade, with as many as three drivers in contention for the title. While Piastri was at 392 points, Verstappen was at 396 and Norris at 408 in the Drivers’ Standings. But things went smoothly for Norris, bringing him his first F1 World Championship title.Pole-sitter Verstappen was aware of McLaren’s capabilities of overtaking him and had rightly said ahead of the final, “Slept good.Ready to go. The plan is to win the race, and rely on a bit of luck from behind.”McLaren CEO Zak Brown had made it clear they wouldn’t compromise on their chances of winning the Drivers’ Championship if it came to asking one of the drivers to sacrifice and support the other to win the title. Piastri’s fans even doubted whether the sacrifice had already been made on his part, as the driver was replaced by a rookie in FP1 and had terrible FP2 and FP3 sessions. But he made a comeback in Qualifying by finishing third. “Until Lando or Max cross the line in front of me, I’ve still got a chance of winning the title,” Piastri said ahead of the final.Lando Norris would have easily won the F1 title had he finished anywhere in the top four, with Verstappen finishing 2nd or lower at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. On the other hand, Verstappen would have won the title only if he had won the Sunday final and Norris hadn’t finished in the top three. Piastri could win the championship only if he won the Abu Dhabi race, with Norris finishing below 6th position and Verstappen ranking second or lower.The Abu Dhabi Grand Prix was a star-studded affair, with several sports and Hollywood celebrities in attendance. Among them were Italian tennis star Jannik Sinner and actor Ana de Armas as well.Also Read: Abu Dhabi Grand Prix: Kelly Piquet kisses Max Verstappen as he bags pole; Lando Norris says, “It is tough”",Max verstappen won the abu dhabi grand prix and lando norris finished third.

Alix Earle stepped into Miami’s brightest spotlight this weekend, and the timing could not have been more striking. Hours after news surfaced that she and NFL wide receiver Braxton Berrios had ended their two-year relationship, the “Dancing With The Stars” finalist arrived at NYLON House looking radiant in a white mini dress. Her smile stayed steady through the night, suggesting she is choosing joy even as her personal life shifts.The split, confirmed by multiple outlets, came after months of long-distance strain. A source close to Earle told the Daily Mail: “Alix has not been happy with the direction their relationship is going in. They spend a lot of time apart and just spent Thanksgiving apart. She's happy in Los Angeles and is preparing for the DWTS Tour. Braxton is in Texas for football and he doesn't have much downtime.”Earle’s weekend in Miami aligned with Art Basel, a scene tailor-made for her social presence. She stopped by a SipMARGS event, waving to fans and posing with friends. Witnesses said she looked relaxed, enjoying the music and energy as if she were reclaiming some breathing room. Dressed in a sheer white mini dress with a garter belt and stockings, she carried herself with confidence and ease.The outing marked her first major appearance since Berrios missed the “DWTS” finale. She had already clarified that his absence was because of football, not relationship trouble, yet the chatter intensified until Page Six confirmed their split. The two had once navigated bi-coastal schedules, with Earle often in Los Angeles or Miami while Berrios trained in Texas under a one-year, $2 million Texans contract. They managed brief reunions, including a lavish birthday celebration in October when Berrios said: “I hope everybody gets to feel as loved as I felt this weekend. There’s nothing better than being surrounded by the people you love that traveled across the country to be there for you. Alix I don't know how you pulled this surprise off but I'm so thankful you did. What a way to start 30!”Despite that affection, long distance eventually caught up with them. While Earle danced her way through Miami’s busiest art week, Berrios prepared for a crucial Texans game against the Kansas City Chiefs.Surrounded by celebrities and friends, Earle looked every bit like someone settling into the next chapter on her own terms.Also Read: Tom Brady can’t contain himself after Caleb Williams unleashes jaw-dropping laser touchdown against Packers","Alix earle and nfl wide receiver braxton berrios have ended their two-year relationship.

Caleb Williams ’ surgical touchdown pass sparks the Bears



The Chicago Bears walked into the afternoon matchup against the Green Bay Packers with hopes of finding rhythm, but the first half offered very little to build on. The offense struggled to move the ball, finishing the opening two quarters with fewer than 100 yards. Every snap looked forced. Every drive looked slower than the last. The Packers controlled the line of scrimmage, and the Bears looked like they were searching for any spark that could lift them back into the game. Nothing seemed to work, and the three points on the scoreboard felt like a generous outcome.Things shifted the moment the second half began. Chicago’s defense opened with a strong stand and forced a quick punt, handing the ball back to the offense with a chance to answer. What followed was the type of response the Bears had been waiting for all day. It unfolded on live television as Tom Brady lit up in real time over the play that changed the tone of the afternoon. His reaction was full of excitement, highlighted by his call: ""I like the idea of getting caleb outside of the pocket. . drops it down, barely through the arms of Nixon in coverage... and finds Zaccheaus. What a catch! What a great camera angle, side-arm delivery, through Nixon's arms and then finds Zaccheaus ... from the pylon cam, what a drive, KB!""Caleb Williams took control of the moment with a crisp and confident 10-play drive that reminded everyone why he is so highly regarded.He executed the play-action fake, rolled right, and delivered a perfect ball to Olamide Zaccheaus. The pass arrived inches before Zaccheaus reached the boundary, placed exactly where only he could secure it. The alternate end-zone angle Brady mentioned made the throw look even more impressive. It captured the precision, the timing and the trust between quarterback and receiver.For a team that had stumbled through two frustrating quarters, this touchdown felt like oxygen. Williams had been off the mark earlier, and the defense had already surrendered two explosive scores. Yet this single throw cut through all of it. No defender had a chance at it, and Zaccheaus’ grip sealed the play.If the Bears hope to build momentum in the weeks ahead, more moments like this from Williams will be essential.Also Read: Shedeur Sanders’ mom Pilar steals the show with explosive tirade at Browns coaches in middle of Titans matchup","Caleb williams’ surgical touchdown pass sparks the bears back into the game.

Shedeur Sanders’ mom goes after Browns coaches



The Cleveland Browns watched their playoff hopes slip away long before the final whistle in Tennessee. Their loss to the two-win Titans sealed their elimination from the AFC race, a moment many fans expected weeks ago. What stings more is how close the team was to keeping the season alive. Right after their win over the Las Vegas Raiders, there was a tiny window where Cleveland held an 8 percent playoff chance if they managed to run the table and finish 9-8. That window shut fast.Cleveland now sits at 3-10, and even with flashes of strong play from rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders, the reality settled in quickly. The shock is not that they are out. What surprises many is that the Browns could still finish tied for first in the AFC North at 7-10 when Week 18 ends. That twist adds another strange layer to a season full of conflicting storylines, including a sideline moment that turned into a viral storm.Shedeur Sanders was on the sideline when another Sanders stole the spotlight. His mom, Pilar, made sure her voice rang louder than the cheers in Cleveland’s section.While Coach Prime hugged his son before kickoff, Pilar focused on something entirely different. She hated how head coach Kevin Stefanski and the offensive staff kept taking the ball out of Shedeur’s hands.During the game, Pilar filmed herself in Instagram Reels, wrapped in a furry winter coat yet looking composed and confident. Her message, though, was fiery. She stared into the camera and said, ""You know, this fking wildcat, is bullst."" An hour later, after Shedeur threw a touchdown, she returned with proof for everyone watching. ""Whew. See what happens when you don't do the wildcat."" She captioned the clip, ""LET SHEDEUR COOK!!!!!""For fans unfamiliar with football tactics, the wildcat removes the quarterback from the play and places the snap in the hands of a running back. Pilar has long pushed back against anyone who limits her son, even calling out Rex Ryan earlier this season. She shows up at almost all of Shedeur’s games, even when he sat third on the depth chart. Deion has said he would only attend when Shedeur is QB1.Through highs and lows, one thing remains constant.

Wilt Chamberlain calls Kareem Abdul-Jabbar the weak link on the Showtime Los Angeles Lakers

The NBA in the 1980s was defined by intensity, pride, and rivalries that felt larger than life, with the Los Angeles Lakers at the center of it all. Showtime transformed into a full-blown Hollywood spectacle, a flurry of fast-paced plays and bright lights spearheaded by Magic Johnson. Yet, underneath all that glamour was a rising tension that only a legend like Wilt Chamberlain had the courage to speak out about.Back in 1986, during a heated debate, Chamberlain locked eyes with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar , his former rival and the steady backbone of the Lakers dynasty, and unleashed a critique that left everyone stunned. He pointed out Abdul-Jabbar’s transition game, saying that the veteran star was throwing off the rhythm that had made the Lakers a powerhouse. It was a tense moment, charged with years of rivalry, personal pride, and the legacy of two Hall of Fame careers. The Lakers were on a roll at 35-9, dominating the league, but Wilt sensed there was more going on beneath the surface of the Showtime sparkle. With the Celtics coming up, the pace quickening, and the pressure rising, his words landed like a challenge.Wilt Chamberlain, the towering 7-foot-1 scoring powerhouse who ruled the 1960s with his 100-point games and four MVP awards, had a legendary rivalry with Abdul-Jabbar.They went head-to-head 94 times, with Chamberlain leading 52-42. By the 1980s, although Chamberlain was retired, he stayed an active commentator, frequently showing up on TV to analyze the game.During a TV debate in January 1986 about the Lakers' dynasty, which included both Chamberlain and Abdul-Jabbar, Chamberlain didn't hold back on his criticism. Addressing the panel and the audience, he stated, ""I like to be blunt. I think that the weak link surprisingly enough on this fantastic Laker team is Kareem. Why? Well, because his transition game is the worst I've ever seen, but remarkably so at the end of the game, he is the best out there. ""The remark came during the Lakers' pursuit of the championship; they had a record of 35-9 at that moment. Chamberlain recognized Abdul-Jabbar's ability to perform under pressure but pointed out that the center's slow approach didn't mesh well with the fast-paced Showtime style.Abdul-Jabbar was there for the conversation but chose not to reply on air. Their shared background added tension: both were raised in Philadelphia and had been part of the same draft class in 1960, but a sense of rivalry remained.This wasn't just small talk. In his 1991 autobiography A View from Above, Chamberlain reflected on the same ideas regarding the evolution of great players, commending Abdul-Jabbar's fundamentals while also pointing out the shift towards athleticism in that era.Also Read: Why the NBA fined Philadelphia 76ers 100K for an incorrect injury report?","Wilt chamberlain called kareem abdul-jabbar the weak link on the showtime los angeles lakers in 1986.
