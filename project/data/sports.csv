Nick Cassidy on his much-awaited win in Shanghai







Nick Cassidy had secured third place on the podium in Monaco earlier this year, but he was still hungry for a win. The Jaguar TCS Racing driver finally got his moment of relief and joy as he clinched his first victory of the season in Race 2 of the Shanghai E-Prix. Starting from pole after an impressive performance in the rain-soaked qualifying session, Cassidy went on to win the rain-hit Round 11 race on Sunday.It was a much-awaited victory for Cassidy, who triumphed in the second race of the Shanghai double-header.

It’s been tough.” The New Zealander was seen laughing his heart out as he stepped onto the podium to celebrate the win.Speaking after the race, Nick Cassidy said, “This weekend is a massive highlight. Really proud of all our guys. Qualifying from yesterday was huge for us, we were in the game, and I’m just proud that we’ve come back today and our pace was absolutely unbelievable — what a race. I feel like there have been so many wins that probably should have been ours at the end of last season that never happened, and it feels like we’ve been waiting a long time.That’s certainly on your mind when you go through the last couple of laps, and now to get that monkey off the back is awesome.”Jaguar TCS Racing referred to Cassidy’s win as a “wet weather master-Cass” in an Instagram post.

Saquon Barkley is the cover of Madden 26 — Should the Eagles star worry about falling prey to the Madden curse?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/saquon-barkley-is-the-cover-of-madden-26-should-the-eagles-star-worry-about-falling-prey-to-the-madden-curse/articleshow/121576414.cms,"Eagles superstar RB Saquon Barkley is officially on the cover of Madden 26! (Getty Images)

Will the Madden curse strike again with Saquon Barkley gracing the cover this year?







When Saquon Barkley pulled off his jaw-dropping reverse hurdle last season, it didn’t just electrify fans — it etched his name into football history. That kind of play doesn’t just dominate highlight reels; it earns the ultimate pop culture nod in the NFL universe: a Madden cover. And for the 2026 edition of EA Sports’ iconic video game, it's Barkley's moment in the spotlight.The Philadelphia Eagles' star running back has officially been announced as the cover athlete for Madden NFL 26, a recognition that puts him in elite company. Not only that, Barkley has been named to the prestigious Madden 99 Club — becoming the first Eagles offensive player to receive the honor. “Starring on the cover of Madden NFL 26 and being named to the Madden NFL '99 Club' are both dreams come true,” Barkley said. “I'm grateful to my teammates, coaches and Eagles fans for their support, and I can't wait to hit the field again to give Madden players more highlight-reel moments in Madden NFL 26.”After a season where he shattered records with 2,504 rushing yards — the highest single-season total in league history — Barkley’s spot on the cover seems more than justified. He also walked away with the AP Offensive Player of the Year award, further cementing his status as one of the league’s most dominant forces.But with this honor comes a shadowy question — is Barkley destined to be the next victim of the infamous “Madden Curse”?The so-called Madden Curse has been a part of NFL lore since the franchise began featuring players on its cover in 1999. The theory? That a featured athlete’s following season is marked by injury, underperformance, or sheer bad luck. Over the years, it’s claimed some of the biggest names in football — Marshall Faulk, Michael Vick, and even reigning stars like Odell Beckham Jr. and Christian McCaffrey.Of the 27 athletes who’ve graced the cover since 1999, 16 have ended up injured the following season. Others saw steep declines in performance. The curse may not come for everyone, but it has shown up often enough to spark superstition among fans and players alike.However, recent trends suggest the Madden Curse might be losing steam. Only 2.5 of the last 10 cover stars from 2014–2024 have suffered what could be called a “cursed” season. Even in cases like Josh Allen (Madden 24), while his interceptions spiked, he still produced a strong season overall. Patrick Mahomes and Tom Brady, co-cover stars for Madden 22, delivered top-tier performances even if they fell short of Super Bowl glory. So while the curse has certainly touched careers, its grip seems to be loosening in the modern era.Saquon Barkley isn’t stepping into this spotlight blind. He’s coming off a historic campaign with the confidence of someone who already conquered the physical and mental hurdles that come with elite-level football. His addition to the 99 Club puts him in a rare tier — joining Eagles legends like Brian Dawkins (Madden 04) and David Akers (Madden 06) — and reaffirms that he’s not just making plays; he’s redefining the running back position.EA Sports VP Evan Dexter summed it up perfectly: “Saquon's reverse hurdle was one of the rare, defining moments in NFL history that would have once been described as 'something out of a video game.'” Now, it’s literally in one.The real question is whether the so-called curse will interrupt Barkley’s momentum. Given his physical condition, surrounding offensive talent in Philadelphia, and the calculated way he trains and manages his body, he might be one of the most prepared cover athletes to date.Let’s not forget — superstition doesn’t score touchdowns, and curses don’t chase down safeties. Preparation, grit, and a powerful offensive line do.Also Read: Chiefs’ 2025 comeback mission begins with Super Bowl heartbreak and Patrick Mahomes’ hunger for revenge",Saquon barkley has been named the cover athlete for madden nfl 26.

Pat Riley didn’t feel confident about Dwyane Wade at first

Dwyane Wade changed the Miami Heat’s story





Pat Riley, the president of the Miami Heat, is one of the greatest minds in NBA history, a Hall of Famer, a championship coach, and a master architect of winning teams. But even legends have their moments of hesitation. In a shocking reveal, Riley admitted he nearly didn’t draft Dwyane Wade in 2003. Yes, the very player who would go on to redefine the Miami Heat.

What followed turned into one of basketball’s most unforgettable success stories.In a recent interview with ESPN on May 31, 2024, Pat Riley spoke about the 2003 NBA Draft. That year, the Miami Heat had the fifth pick. Riley had just stepped down as head coach in April 2003 and was now the team’s president.He said, “I’ve always liked coaching older guys. I thought we’d never be bad enough to get a top pick.” Riley explained he was mostly looking at point guards and centers that year.He said names like Kirk Hinrich, T.J. Ford, and Chris Kaman were high on the list. “Dwyane Wade was there too, but I wasn’t sure about him in the beginning,” he added.On June 26, 2003, the Miami Heat picked Dwyane Wade during the NBA Draft in New York City. It became one of the best choices the team ever made. Wade quickly became a star. In his second season, in 2005, he helped take the Heat to the Eastern Conference Finals.In 2006, Pat Riley came back as head coach. That same year, with help from Shaquille O’Neal, Wade led the team to win the NBA title. He was named the Finals MVP.Later in 2010, Riley helped sign LeBron James and Chris Bosh. They joined Dwyane Wade to form the famous Big Three. Some fans didn’t like how it looked. But Wade said it didn’t need to look perfect. It was about the meaning.Dwyane Wade is now known as the greatest player in Heat history. It’s hard to believe Pat Riley almost passed on him.

Why was Tampa Bay Rays' shortstop Taylor Walls ejected amid play for tapping on his helmet?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/mlb/news/why-was-tampa-bay-rays-shortstop-taylor-walls-ejected-amid-play-for-tapping-on-his-helmet/articleshow/121565962.cms,"(Image via Getty: Taylor Walls)

Home plate umpire Nic Lentz asked Taylor Walls to stop playing because he tapped on his helmet amid play



Taylor Walls says tapping on his helmet was totally unintentional and he was not consciously aware of that

Also Read:





What does tapping on the helmet mean? That one question is creating a ruckus all over the globe right now. Tampa Bay Rays’ shortstop Taylor Walls tapped on his helmet after a play. The home plate umpire, Nic Lentz, took it as an automated ball-strike challenge system. In simple terms? Players can tap their helmets to challenge a call. But Walls did not mean that. He shared with MLB.com, “It looks like I tapped my helmet. But it was totally unintentional, something I was not consciously aware of at all.”On Sunday afternoon, in the ninth inning of Tampa Bay Rays vs Houston Astros, when Rays’ shortstop Taylor Walls was in-bat against Astros closer Josh Hader, he took a first-pitch slider. According to the official website of MLB, the first-pitch slider appeared to be just below the strike zone. But the home plate umpire, Nic Lentz, called it a strike.After that, Walls communicated with Lentz twice and said that the pitch was too low to be called a strike. He adjusted his helmet, moved two steps ahead, then looked at Nic Lentz and tapped on his helmet thrice.Nic Lentz walks up to Taylor Walls and says, “You are not going to do that.You are not going to tap your helmet.”Walls said, “I watched the video, and I could see where he may have that thought. But I think, like, the context clues around it - I’m looking at him, and my body language is saying, like, ‘Dude, I didn’t hear what you’re saying.’I didn’t say anything to him leading up to this. If I’m gonna tap my helmet, I’m not gonna do it while I’m looking at you, asking you a question, trying to understand what you’re telling me. I just remember going to get into the box, kind of adjusting my helmet, and then hearing him mouthing something.I was like, I think I said, ‘Huh, what did you say? I can’t hear you.’ And at that point - I have no recollection of it, but after seeing the video, it looks like I tapped my helmet. But it was totally unintentional, something I was not consciously aware of at all.”The 28-year-old second baseman lost his cool when Nic Lentz asked him to leave amid play. He removes his helmet, throws it to the ground, tries to threaten, comes at him, points fingers, tries to jump on him(to punch him maybe?), comes back, and screams at him angrily - but luckily, he was handled by the rest of the MLB crew on the ground.Fans reacted to FOX Sports: MLB's X post: Taylor Walls was ejected from the game after tapping his helmet. One fan wrote, ""To be fair, he didn’t get ejected for tapping his helmet, it was for what came out of his mouth. These headlines are never honest about what actually happened.""Another fan commented, ""If I recall correctly, nearly half of all batters, who get up to bat. Tap their helmet down to make sure it’s secure. If it became some other gesture. That’s just weak."" A third fan said, ""Referees are ruining sports.""","Tampa bay rays’ shortstop taylor walls tapped on his helmet after a play.

Frank Ragnow’s retirement raises questions beyond health







The NFL is full of surprises, but this one hits hard. Just as the Detroit Lions were gearing up for a big season, star center Frank Ragnow suddenly announced his retirement. Known as one of the best at his position, Ragnow’s decision to step away from the game comes at a tough time for a team that was finally hitting its stride. And while he cited health reasons, his unexpected exit leaves fans and analysts wondering if there’s more to the story.Frank Ragnow’s announcement, delivered via Instagram, paints a picture of physical exhaustion and emotional turmoil. ""I’ve tried to convince myself that I’m feeling good, but I’m not,"" he wrote, citing an ongoing battle with an ""inoperable"" toe injury. While his words are heartfelt, many around the league are left wondering why he chose to retire at this moment.The 29-year-old All-Pro had just completed a strong 2024 season, even hinting at longevity in the league just months ago. His absence from OTAs sparked speculation about contract issues, but those rumors were quickly buried under the official narrative of health concerns. Still, it’s hard to ignore the suddenness of his departure and how it contrasts with his previous optimism.What makes this more controversial is the ripple effect it has on the Lions' season trajectory.This isn't just any player walking away, Ragnow was the foundational piece of Detroit's offensive line. A four-time Pro Bowler, a locker room leader, and arguably one of the most cerebral centers in football, his exit creates a void that can’t simply be patched up with a next-man-up mentality.Currently, the Lions are looking to veteran Graham Glasgow or rookie Tate Ratledge to fill the role. While Glasgow brings experience, especially at center, there’s no replacing Ragnow’s consistency, chemistry with the quarterback, or command at the line of scrimmage.Also Read: Mike Tomlin liked Shedeur Sanders in the draft but hesitated after past struggles with Russell Wilson and Justin Fields The Lions’ resurgence has been one of the NFL’s feel-good stories but this retirement could be a turning point.

I picked Tampa Bay in the East. Part of my pick then was Matthew Tkachuk, who was hurt.”The NHL legend added, “He was such a big part of the success of the Panthers, and I wasn't sure he was coming back.”Apart from this, Wayne Gretzky has mostly maintained a low profile in the last few months.Also Read: “We are going to the finals baby”: Connor McDavid's wife Lauren Kyle reacts to Oilers' Game 5 win as she posts a wholesome life update","Paulina gretzky has been married to pro golfer dustin johnson for a couple of years.

'I don't want to be a one-season wonder': Punjab Kings' Shashank Singh

The shot of the tournament





TimesofIndia.com in Ahmedabad: In the past few weeks, a podcast featuring Punjab Kings' (PBKS) Shreyas Iyer has gone viral, where he is humorously promised titles, a house, an entire colony, and even a Canadian bride if he wins the IPL trophy for Punjab Kings.In the podcast, ""The Boundary Boys,"" the host says: ""Veer ji Punjab nu IPL jitata na saari zindagi li sarpanch sadda pakka...Mohali vich Iyer naam di colony assi kat ke devange. Shreyas Iyer diyaan sadkein bana denge. 100 kille road te enu zameen de diyange, daah kille vich Kothi pa devange hor teh hod Canada de kudi de naal rishta karwa deveange.(If he wins the IPL for Punjab Kings, he will be our chief for the rest of his life. We will build a new colony in his name. We will build roads under his name. We will give him 100 acre land near the road. We will give him 10 acres to build his mansion. On top of it, we will get him married to a Canadian girl).""This sums up the mood of the PBKS fanbase.On the day of Qualifier 1, a PBKS fan outside the New PCA Stadium told TimesofIndia.com: ""MLA banwa devange"" (We'll make him an MLA).Around an hour past midnight on Monday, Shreyas Iyer furthered PBKS' foundation towards maiden IPL title. He not only finished the game, hitting four sixes in the 19th over against Ashwani Kumar of Mumbai Indians (MI) to help PBKS chase down an uphill 204-run target, with an over to spare, but he also took them one stage closer to their first IPL title.Punjab’s captain fantastic didn’t even celebrate once he hit the winning six. It was cold at every level. He just hugged his partner Marcus Stoinis, removed his helmet, put his gloves in it, and shook hands with MI players. The only time he showed a bit of emotion was while hugging PBKS coach Ricky Ponting. The duo have forged an unforgettable partnership and built a team from scratch. And now they are in the final.He has not only been ice cold on the field but even in his interviews, one can feel his calmness. After being on the losing side of a one-sided match against RCB, he had said: ""We have lost the battle, not the war.""After beating MI, he said: ""I love such big occasions. I always say to myself and also to my colleagues in the team that the bigger the occasion, the calmer you are, you get the big results.""If one can take a cue from Shreyas' two post-match interviews, the key takeaway is that the job is just half done for him, and he is gunning for the silverware.On Sunday-turned-Monday, Shreyas became the first IPL captain to take three different teams to the IPL finals.But this time, it was more special. It was against all odds. A year after guiding Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) to their third title, the franchise decided not to retain their captain. Ponting and Punjab trusted him, and the duo — who guided Delhi Capitals to their first final in 2020 — have unwound their magic spell once again for the perennial wooden spooners.What makes Shreyas Iyer’s leadership even more remarkable is that he has built the team’s core around six uncapped Indian players — Priyansh Arya, Prabhsimran Singh, Nehal Wadhera, Shashank Singh , Vijaykumar Vyshak, and Harpreet Brar.The opening duo of Priyansh and Prabhsimran have formed one of the most explosive partnerships in this year’s IPL, consistently providing blistering starts. In the middle order, Nehal Wadhera has emerged as a dependable anchor — notably forging an 84-run stand off just 47 balls with Iyer for the fourth wicket against MI. Shashank Singh has developed a reputation as a finisher, delivering crucial cameos in tight chases.On the bowling front, Vijaykumar Vyshak has been a reliable force, especially in challenging conditions — as he demonstrated with his knuckle balls on a rainy evening in Ahmedabad, dismissing Jonny Bairstow with one such delivery. Meanwhile, left-arm spinner Harpreet Brar has quietly delivered match-winning performances, picking up 10 wickets in eight matches, including a Player of the Match effort against Rajasthan Royals in the league stage.PBKS batter Shashank Singh, in an interview with TimesofIndia.com, opened up about various facets of captain Shreyas Iyer and why he is so successful.""He is a captain who always gives freedom to his players. He is someone who treats everyone — and when I say everyone, I mean everyone in the team, the 100-120 staff members we have — he treats them equally,"" said Shashank.""He spends time with everyone. He is someone who is extremely positive. He will always back you. If you tell him, ‘I want to go first and hit everyone,’ he will say, ‘Go and hit — and hit in the next match also, hit after that too.’ He is someone who will give you that extra freedom as well.""As a captain, he is someone who backs his instinct — that is his best trait. He will listen to everyone, because I’ve seen a few captains who just say no to everything. He is someone who will say, ‘Give me your ideas, and I will surely listen to them. Obviously, if I like it, I’ll go ahead with it.’""He makes sure that the players should speak, rather than him or the support staff. So, that is the best part — he listens. He is a very good listener.""""I mean, he has his own swag, he has his own aura, and the way he handles everyone. I mean, people from the outside think he is arrogant, but he is just the cool guy,"" he added.Only time will tell whether Shreyas will be able to do the unthinkable on June 3, but against MI, he did something beyond everyone’s wildest imagination. He played one of the shots of the tournament — and no, it wasn’t a six, but a four.On the second ball of Bumrah’s last over, Iyer carved out a boundary from a pinpoint yorker, which even left someone like AB de Villiers, who has hit some of the most astounding shots the world has seen, gasping for breath.""Shot of the IPL for me. It is hitting the middle stump. It is the perfect yorker & you can’t get it away. That is breaking the bottom of the bat, that is breaking my stumps as well if I am facing that, and Shreyas put it away for four,"" De Villiers said on JioHotstar after the match.In the 18th season of the IPL, Iyer was PBKS' 17th captain. The frequent change in captaincy tells you a lot about the kind of franchise Punjab is. And now, after all these years, they’ve finally found a 'Sarpanch' — someone their fans adore. If he manages to lift the trophy on Tuesday, his name will be etched in the folklores of Punjab and PBKS fans forever.","Shreyas iyer hit four sixes in the 19th over against ashwani kumar of mumbai indians (mi) to help pbks chase down an uphill 204-run target, with an over to spare. He became the first ipl captain to take three different teams to the ipl finals. He has not only been ice cold on the field but even in his interviews, one can feel his calmness.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121562447,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-49548,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

An incident for Matt Chapman's fitness

No official injury report filed

Anticipated role of Matt Chapman in tonight's game





As the San Francisco Giants and San Diego Padres were set for a clash on June 2, 2025, anything Matt Chapman-related was bound to pique the curiosity of the fans, for he is their premier third baseman. After undergoing a collision during a game that could have endangered his physical condition, the question arose as to whether or not the 31-year-old infielder would be able to show up for the all-important division clash tonight.In a battle for division placement in the National League West, the presence of Chapman could sway the outcome. So, is he taking the field? Here's what we know about his state and potential availability for the game.San Francisco Giants third baseman Matt Chapman was involved in a collision with Miami Marlins' Liam Hicks during the fifth inning of Sunday's game. Both were converging on the base path when the incident happened, resulting in a short pause in play. Chapman remained in the game after the collision, indicating that any injury was not immediately severe.Any official report on Matt Chapman's injury by the San Francisco Giants has not yet come to light as of June 2, 2025.He has not been put on any injury list; in addition, nothing has been announced about his availability for tonight's game against the San Diego Padres.With his participation in recent games, Chapman would seem fit for play, but without an official statement, his status remains unconfirmed.The Giants are scheduled to play the Padres at 10:00 pm ET on Oracle Park. Since it is such a pivotal contributor to the lineup, and given that there isn't any official injury designation on Chapman, it is pretty much white-listed for the decision: he should be available for selection.Also Read: Matt Chapman net worth 2025: Everything on Giants’ money from MLB and other sources It is, however, important to point out that the final decision regarding player participation is usually made right before the game; hence, its fans are advised to keep looking out for the official lineup announcement.To wrap this up, there is a good chance that despite Chapman's recent collision causing some concerns, all implications because of no official injury listing and his demonstrated physical involvement in games suggest his participation tonight.

Shai Gilgeous-Alexander is the heart of Oklahoma City’s title run

Tyrese Haliburton is Indiana’s engine and emotional leader

Pascal Siakam brings championship experience to the Pacers

Jalen Williams is Oklahoma City’s rising two-way star

Myles Turner is Indiana’s rim protector and defensive anchor





The 2025 NBA Finals are taking place and this time it’s a different experience. On June 5 at the Paycom Center, the Indiana Pacers will fight the top-seeded Oklahoma City Thunder in Game 1. The attention is at its peak since Oklahoma City has yet to win the championship since relocating and Indiana is looking for their very first win. Some players might take over from early in the series and here are five to look out for from the opening tip.Shai Gilgeous-Alexander leads his team into this first game as the league’s MVP and honestly, he fully deserves the title. In leading the Thunder, he helped the team to a stunning 68-14 season and averaged 32.7 points, 6.4 assists and 5.0 rebounds each game.In addition, in the postseason, he has consistently delivered with 29.8 points, 6.9 assists and 5.7 rebounds. Because of his ability to get a good shot, dribble around teammates and control the game, Young is a major concern to Indiana’s guards.The revival of the Indiana Pacers depends on Tyrese Haliburton. The All-Star guard has taken over, contributing 9.8 assists, 18.8 points and 5.7 rebounds each game so far in the postseason.In the Eastern Conference Finals, he improved his numbers, scoring 21.0 points and assisting on 10.5 every game against the Knicks. If Indiana is to win, it will rely on Kyrie Irving's great vision, quick decisions and ability to take shots.Pascal Siakam’s case shows why it matters. Chosen to help the young Indiana team in the playoffs, Siakam has played well when it matters most. Frequency of scoring inside, guarding different spots and spacing the floor means he can harm opponents in multiple ways. The presence of Siakam with experience from winning a title in Toronto could make all the difference in this young team.Shai Gilgeous-Alexander is coming into Game 1 as the league's MVP, and honestly, he really earned it. He led the Thunder to an impressive 68–14 regular season, scoring an average of 32.7 points, 6.4 assists, and 5.0 rebounds each game. And it doesn’t stop there—he’s been just as effective in the postseason, averaging 29.8 points, 6.9 assists, and 5.7 rebounds across 16 playoff games. His talent for creating his own shot, cutting through defenses, and managing the pace makes him a serious threat against Indiana’s backcourt.Myles Turner’s ability to block shots is a major factor in why Indiana has been solid defensively during the playoffs. He changes the trajectory of shots, dominates the boards, and stretches the floor with his three-point shooting. Facing an OKC offense that’s quick and unyielding, Turner’s defense in the paint will be crucial for Indiana’s chances in Game 1.Also Read: NBA trade rumors point to a bold Toronto Raptors offseason with Giannis Antetokounmpo emerging as a potential target Game 1 of the 2025 NBA Finals is going to be explosive.

Stephen A.

Stephen A. Smith Highlights the Rise of Depth-Driven Teams in the NBA Finals

THE PAUL GEORGE EFFECT 💥 Stephen A. on why teams SHOULDN’T stack stars in today’s NBA | First Take





The 2025 NBA Finals showcase a significant transformation in basketball strategy. The time when having three superstars ensured victory is behind us. Stephen A. Smith points out this change, referencing the Indiana Pacers and Oklahoma City Thunder—teams that have chosen to emphasize depth and youth instead of star power—as models of a new, successful method for building championship teams. Their experiences challenge the old norms and indicate a rethinking of what it means to win in the current NBA.Stephen A. Smith has openly discussed how forming superteams isn't yielding the results people hoped for. He points out that even with star-studded groups like Kevin Durant, Bradley Beal, and Devin Booker in Phoenix, or LeBron James, Anthony Davis, and Russell Westbrook in Los Angeles, these teams haven't met the hype. On the flip side, the Indiana Pacers and Oklahoma City Thunder have succeeded by building well-rounded teams with up-and-coming players and adaptable role players.The Thunder's rise is definitely impressive. Wrapping up the regular season with an outstanding 68–14 record, they were spearheaded by MVP Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, who put up an average of 32.7 points per game. With All-Star Jalen Williams by his side and key additions like Isaiah Hartenstein and Alex Caruso, Oklahoma City shows how teamwork can beat a bunch of solo stars.The Pacers' trek to their first NBA Finals in 25 years emphasizes the importance of depth and resilience. After dealing with some early-season hiccups, Indiana charged through the playoffs, beating strong opponents such as the Milwaukee Bucks and Cleveland Cavaliers. Their triumph is due to a solid roster featuring Tyrese Haliburton, Pascal Siakam, and Myles Turner, all playing key roles without any one player overshadowing the others.Both of these stories back up Smith's point that a well rounded, flexible team can be better than pouring everything into only the very best 2 people that you have. Adaptability, teamwork and having a good game plan is what is key towards making a championship worthy team in the current NBA scene exhibited by the Pacers and the Thunder.Also Read: Tom Thibodeau’s future with New York Knicks safe despite ECF loss to Indiana Pacers and fan criticism The NBA Finals of 2025 point to changes in how teams are created in professional basketball. In Stephen A. Smith’s view, there’s increasingly acknowledgement that strong teamwork and a range of players are more important than just having a couple of outstanding individuals.

Elijah Moore praises Buffalo’s support and Josh Allen’s leadership amid Bills’ receiver overhaul,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/elijah-moore-praises-buffalos-support-and-josh-allens-leadership-amid-bills-receiver-overhaul/articleshow/121580178.cms,"Moore grateful for Buffalo’s warm welcome (Image via: Getty Images)

Elijah Moore ’s fresh start in a changing Buffalo receiving lineup







The Buffalo Bills are once again shaking up their wide receiver lineup, leaving fans wondering how Josh Allen will adapt without his top targets. Amid these changes, new arrival Elijah Moore is already praising the team’s passionate fanbase and supportive environment. With proven stars gone, Buffalo is putting its faith in fresh talent and a new chapter.For the second consecutive offseason, the Bills have made major moves in their wide receiver room. After trading Stefon Diggs and letting Gabe Davis walk in 2024, Buffalo watched Mack Hollins sign with the Patriots this year. Meanwhile, Amari Cooper’s future with the team remains uncertain. These departures have left a void for Josh Allen, who led the league with MVP-level play last season despite losing his top two weapons.Into this gap steps Elijah Moore, a reliable target in Cleveland with over 60 catches each of the past two seasons. Moore is optimistic about his new opportunity, sharing on social media, “Buffalo already has been nothing but great to me already. This place really takes care of they people.” His excitement reflects a player ready to embrace the challenge of stepping up in a high-powered offense undergoing transition.Moore also expressed admiration for Allen after observing him up close in practice. While Moore acknowledged the challenge of adjusting to a new team, he’s encouraged by Allen’s focus and precision. With Keon Coleman and Josh Palmer expected to start as boundary receivers, Moore could quickly emerge as a key weapon in Buffalo’s revamped offense.The Bills’ gamble on youth and new faces is bold, especially in a competitive AFC where reliable targets are crucial. But if Moore and the other newcomers can gel quickly with Allen, Buffalo’s offense may remain explosive despite the roster turnover.Also Read: ‘Gotta stay focused’: Stefon Diggs speaks out after controversial boat video surfaces As the season quickly approaches, all eyes will be on how these fresh pieces fit together and if Josh Allen can once again carry the Bills’ title hopes with a brand-new, untested receiving corps behind him.","Elijah moore is the latest wide receiver to join the buffalo bills.

Controversy around the Imane Khelif’s gold medal at Paris Olympic



IOC calls findings misinformation



Response of World Boxing Federation

Fairness and safety concerns from athletes and federations



Ongoing debate on gender and sport eligibility





A leaked medical report from the 2023 World Championships has revealed that Olympic boxing champion Imane Khelif is biologically male, according to chromosome analysis. The report, made public just days after World Boxing ordered Khelif to undergo sex testing for eligibility in future female competitions, shows she has a male XY karyotype. This revelation challenges the International Olympic Committee’s (IOC) earlier dismissal of such tests and has intensified debate over fairness and safety in women’s boxing. The findings come amid ongoing controversy surrounding Khelif’s participation in women’s events, sparking calls for stricter verification procedures in sport.The report, published on the 3 Wire Sports website, states that Khelif’s chromosome analysis is “abnormal” and confirms a male karyotype. It was conducted by Dr Lal PathLabs in New Delhi, a lab accredited by the American College of Pathologists and certified by the International Organisation for Standardisation. This directly challenges the IOC’s spokesperson Mark Adams, who had described such test results as “ad hoc” and “not legitimate” during a press conference at the Paris Olympics.The controversy surrounding Imane Khelif’s Olympic gold medal run began as early as her first bout in Paris, where she faced Italy’s Angela Carini.Carini, an experienced and respected boxer, was visibly shaken during the match. Overwhelmed by Khelif’s strength and intensity, she appeared distressed and left the ring in tears after the fight, later telling media she had feared for her safety. The unease only deepened in the final bout, where Khelif defeated Taiwan’s Lin Yu-ting in a dominant display that many felt was physically one-sided. The power difference between the fighters drew sharp criticism, with commentators and athletes calling it “uncomfortable to watch” and likening it to watching a man beat a woman in the ring. The moment became one of the most controversial of the Paris Games, fuelling an international debate over fairness and inclusion in women’s sport.IOC president Thomas Bach dismissed the report as part of a Russian-led misinformation campaign, citing ethical and financial issues within the International Boxing Association (IBA), which conducted the tests. Despite these claims, the legitimacy of the Indian lab’s certification has increased pressure on the IOC to clarify its position and respond to questions about Khelif’s eligibility.Following the leak, World Boxing has declared that Khelif must pass mandatory chromosome testing before competing in any future female events. The 26-year-old Olympic champion, who was allowed to compete in Paris due to her female passport status, has so far not provided evidence to confirm female chromosomes. World Boxing now requires all athletes over 18 in its competitions to undergo PCR genetic testing to verify their sex, a measure introduced in response to this controversy.The case has raised serious safety and fairness concerns within the boxing community. Opponents like Italy’s Angela Carini and Mexico’s Brianda Tamara have spoken out about the physical challenges they faced competing against Khelif. Latin American federations have been particularly vocal, urging that women’s competitions be restricted to athletes assigned female at birth, in order to protect fairness and athlete safety.The Khelif controversy highlights the complex and sensitive issues surrounding transgender and intersex athletes in competitive sport. It underscores the need for clear, consistent policies that balance inclusivity with fairness and safety. As governing bodies reassess their rules, the case remains a key example of the challenges faced in maintaining the integrity of women’s sports.The ongoing debate around Imane Khelif’s case brings to light just how complex and emotionally charged the conversation about gender and eligibility in sport has become. At the heart of it are real athletes — women who train for years and step into the ring expecting fairness. Many feel blindsided and unheard when competing against opponents whose physical attributes raise legitimate concerns about safety and equality. This isn’t about exclusion, but about protecting hard-won opportunities for women in sport. Khelif’s story reminds us that governing bodies must act transparently, thoughtfully, and with empathy for all athletes involved.",Imane khelif ’s medical report contradicts ioc’s official position.

Punjab Kings bowling coach James Hopes on where it went wrong - after the first over





NEW DELHI: Punjab Kings, powered by an inspirational 41-ball 87 not out from skipper Shreyas Iyer , knocked out five-time champions Mumbai Indians by five wickets in Qualifier 2 to storm into the final. As the Indian Premier League enters its 18th season, it is now guaranteed to crown a new champion.Punjab Kings, who last reached the final in 2014, will face four-time finalists Royal Challengers Bengaluru on Tuesday, June 3.It was a majestic innings from captain Iyer, who tore into the Mumbai bowling attack, launching aggressive sixes to seal a title clash with RCB.""I couldn’t sleep. I hardly had four hours of sleep and I am here,"" Iyer told reporters ahead of the IPL 2025 final.""I went to my room.
