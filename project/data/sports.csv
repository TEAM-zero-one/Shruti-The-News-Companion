Tom Brady on Matthew Stafford’s cold-weather adjustment

The Los Angeles Rams walk into one of the toughest environments in the NFL this weekend, and the spotlight once again lands on quarterback Matthew Stafford . The Rams face the Chicago Bears on January 18, 2026, at Soldier Field, where winter conditions often shape the outcome as much as play-calling.This time, the conversation took a sharper turn after Tom Brady weighed in. The seven-time Super Bowl champion offered perspective on cold-weather football while speaking about Stafford’s situation, not as criticism but as a reminder of how quickly conditions can test even proven quarterbacks.Brady shared his thoughts during an appearance on ""The Herd with Colin Cowherd"" earlier this month. While discussing playoff football and QB preparation, Brady pointed to weather as a subtle but real factor in Chicago’s favor.“Matt did play in Detroit for a long time, and in that division he went outside to Chicago and Green Bay,” Brady said on the FOX Sports show. “It’s not like he hasn’t played in it. But I will say, when I went to Tampa after my time in New England, it didn’t take me very long to get very soft in the cold.”TB-12's comment came with context, no doubt. Stafford spent 12 seasons with the Detroit Lions and played many games in the freezing conditions of the NFC North.But since joining the Rams in 2021, most of his winters in Southern California have been mild. Chicago expects temperatures near 10 degrees on Sunday, with wind gusts close to 20 miles per hour. Wind chill could push the “feels like” temperature closer to four degrees by kickoff.Brady explained how quickly the body reacts when cold exposure becomes rare. He recalled Tampa Bay’s NFC Championship Game trip to Green Bay during the 2020 season.“That game was around 32 to 34 degrees at kickoff,” Brady said during the interview. “It wasn’t minus-nine. That’s really cold. And that’s a big advantage for Chicago.”The Bears know this well. Over the past six weeks, Chicago leaned into Soldier Field’s conditions and used them to disrupt visiting offenses. Cold tightens hands. Plus, footing changes route depth and release speed.Stafford enters the matchup healthy and confident, but this test goes beyond arm strength. It demands patience, grip control, and trust in short throws. Brady’s message focused on adjustment, not weakness. Sunday’s game will show whether Stafford’s experience, preparation, and playoff poise can meet the challenge. If he adapts early, the weather becomes just another obstacle, not the story.Also Read: “Cry for sympathy and attention”: Tom Brady accused of seeking sympathy after post tied to Gisele Bündchen wedding","Tom brady reveals the one factor that could trouble matthew stafford in chicago.

NBA trade rumors: Toronto Raptors weigh major deadline calls as RJ Barrett and Immanuel Quickley surface in trade talks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/nba-trade-rumors-toronto-raptors-weigh-major-deadline-calls-as-rj-barrett-and-immanuel-quickley-surface-in-trade-talks/articleshow/126585202.cms,"Toronto Raptors might trade RJ Barrett (Image via NBA)

Raptors explore RJ Barrett–Immanuel Quickley packages as Domantas Sabonis talks stall

RJ Barrett’s fantasy outlook surges as potential multi-team trade scenario takes shape

Tension is always present throughout the trade season, particularly for teams that must choose between contending and rebuilding. As the NBA trade deadline on February 5th draws near, the Toronto Raptors are in that precise position. The Raptors are in a particularly strong position on the trade market this year.It is now more difficult for teams to move players on very modest or very large salaries due to the league's new CBA regulations, especially the limitations around the second apron. The new regulations have also caused the value of draft picks to soar. One of the few teams in the Eastern Conference that has control over all of its upcoming first-round selections is Toronto.For weeks, the Sacramento Kings star has been connected to Toronto; NBA insider Jake Fischer has revealed that there is genuine interest. A deal isn't closed yet. Sacramento's emphasis on financial adaptability has made negotiations extremely difficult.Fischer said:“Domantas Sabonis has interest from Toronto. We’ve continued to report that, but it’ll be tricky to find an agreement there, being that the Raptors, to my understanding, are really just trying to look at what they can get for a combination of Immanuel Quickley, RJ Barrett, and Jakob Poeltl and the Kings do not want long-term salary on their books right now.”Discussions continue to go slowly because of this disparity. Sacramento wants to avoid long-term contracts, while Toronto is investigating various player combinations. League insiders feel that any Sabonis transfer would necessitate the involvement of at least one extra team due to this disparity.There is a sense of urgency in Toronto following three consecutive postseason losses, and with new governor Edward Rogers poised to assume complete ownership of the team later this year. According to multiple sources who spoke to ESPN, the Raptors have been on the phone in recent weeks assessing the trade value of some of its players, such as RJ Barrett and Immanuel Quickley.The Raptors, who have been linked to each of those players, would be in a better position to do so because their offers would include multiyear contracts of their own, whereas other teams might be hesitant to take on long-term salary for potential trade candidates like Morant, Domantas Sabonis, or Anthony Davis. RJ Barret would be acquired by Detroit, according to insiders.RJ Barrett's fantasy worth would increase the most in this transaction. Barrett would take on a key scoring position and have plenty of opportunity to amass stats if he were to move from the Raptors, a team with many scoring alternatives and shared ball distribution, to the Nets, a team that is probably going to be losing players at the trade deadline.The Raptors still lack a true offensive center of gravity in their frontcourt, despite coach Darko Rajakovic's embrace of flexible formations. A proposed four-team structure provides a solution to several problems. Under this deal, Sabonis would go to Toronto. In 2026, Toronto and Detroit would give Sacramento Jonathan Kuminga, Tobias Harris, and two first-round selections.Also read: Atlanta Hawks Vs Toronto Raptors (01-06-2026) game preview: When and where to watch, expected lineup, injury report, prediction, and more","The toronto raptors are in a strong position on the trade market this year.

Victor Wembanyama delivered rare stat lines that NBA has never measured before

Victor Wembanyama continues to play at full potential despite multiple injuries

The modern NBA’s history is being reshaped completely as Victor Wembanyama is making records and headlines every now and then. Yes, that’s correct; the San Antonio Spurs’ star has achieved yet another milestone, and this time the entire league has been shaken. Earlier on Thursday, Wembanyama pulled out an incredible move, which led them to a 110-110 victory against the Milwaukee Bucks, thereby entering the second position in the Western Conference.Wembanyama is an NBA All-Star, and he deserves all the fame. His career high has been at 50 points, which was scored while playing against the Washington Wizards back in 2024. Here's why the Spurs star has made it to the top of every news site on Thursday’s matchup against the Bucks.The San Antonio Spurs star Victor Wembanyama has achieved yet another dominant milestone, thereby putting his team in a rare historical territory. He has delivered 22 points and a 10-rebound double-double while playing for just 22 minutes against the Milwaukee Bucks. He even hit five 3-pointers and blocked two shots. The entire league was completely awestruck by the performance delivered by Wembanyama.The incredible scores delivered by Wembanyama on Thursday’s matchup were nothing new, as he has recorded even more in previous games. However, the rate at which the Spurs star is getting better has never been seen in the big league’s history. His skills have been unmatched by other players on the team. While the Bucks, having Giannis Antetokounmpo , delivered quite the performance, they lost in Thursday’s matchup.In the 2025-2026 season, the San Antonio Spurs star, Victor Wembanyama, has averaged 23.9 points, 10.9 rebounds, and 3.2 assists per game, and that looms large. However, injuries lingered around the NBA star, and in Thursday’s matchup, Wembanyama developed one on the court.In a postgame interview, Wembanyama said, “I did not think it was serious because it was just knee to knee, and I’ve had this dozens of times, but never against a guy like Giannis. That was a little more than usual, but thankfully, it’s a very benign thing. Even after an outstanding performance, he had to exit to the locker room following a knee injury.Also read: Is Victor Wembanyama alright?

The Edmonton Oilers entered last night as the clear favorites, but the NY Islanders surprised, as they defeated the home team 1-0. But head coach Kris Knoblauch wasn’t too stressed about the loss, and he was all praise for former AHL goalie Connor Ingram.Ingram stopped 17 shots in the defeat, turning in another solid performance even though he was outdueled by Ilya Sorokin, who made 35 saves for his NHL-leading fifth shutout of the season. The Oilers dominated possession and generated quality chances throughout the night, outshooting the Islanders by nearly a two-to-one margin.""I feel like the team did everything but score tonight,"" Knoblauch said. ""I'm pleased with our team's effort and execution. Ingram played really well and made some big saves, especially early in the game. We had a lot of good scoring chances five-on-five, on the power play, and six-on-five. We did pretty much everything but put the puck in the net.""When asked about Ingram's ability to come up from Bakersfield and deliver quality starts, Knoblauch explained why some goaltenders find more success at the NHL level than in the minors. ""Very impressive.Down in Bakersfield, he wasn't playing his best,"" Knoblauch said.""He comes here, and the game's a lot easier for some players to play, whether they're forwards, defensemen, or especially goaltenders. The NHL is easier, ironically for goaltenders, simply because there's a lot more structure and predictability,” Knoblauch said.The head coach believes that this makes the position a lot easier for a goaltender, and Ingram has so far been doing great for the Oilers. Ingram has now made seven starts for Edmonton since his recall, establishing himself as a reliable option in the crease.Knoblauch noted that the goaltender's last two performances have been particularly impressive despite the loss. ""That's seven pretty solid starts from him, and tonight, his last two were probably his best,"" Knoblauch said. ""I'm pleased with him.""The loss dropped the Oilers to 23-17-8 on the season and ended Connor McDavid 's career-high 20-game point streak. Anthony Duclair scored the game's only goal on the power play with 6:18 remaining in the third period after Leon Draisaitl took a tripping penalty.Despite the disappointing outcome, Knoblauch's focus remained on the positives. His team controlled play, generated chances, and received strong goaltending. On most nights, that formula produces victories.

iVisit Boxing and Ed Pereira target Tyson Fury and Ryan Garcia for record-breaking San Francisco card

Tyson Fury is once again at the center of boxing’s biggest dream. This time, it is not about belts or rivalries, but about history. Stunning plans are now in place to stage a never-before-seen boxing event that could smash the world record for the largest crowd ever to attend a fight. Promoters want Tyson Fury, 37, to be the main attraction on a card that aims to draw up to 150,000 fans in one place. The current record stands at 135,132 fans, set back in 1941 at Juneau Park in Milwaukee, when Tony Zale defeated Billy Pryor, according to boxing history records. Now, more than 85 years later, a new group believes that record can finally fall.The event is planned for July 11 at San Francisco’s Civic Center Plaza, turning the open space into a massive outdoor boxing arena. The fight card will be streamed live on YouTube, with thousands of tickets expected to be given away for free, all in a bold push to make boxing history.The driving force behind this ambitious plan is iVisit Boxing, a fast-rising promotional company led by Ed Pereira. Pereira comes from a strong background in sports marketing and logistics, with experience across the Premier League, rugby union, and professional boxing.Before this San Francisco idea, Pereira helped organize the May 2025 boxing card in Times Square, New York, featuring Ryan Garcia, Devin Haney, and Teofimo Lopez. That event made global headlines but also faced criticism for having no live crowd present.Speaking to SunSport, Pereira explained why this San Francisco plan is different and much bigger. He said,“When you are asking 150,000 to 180,000 people to turn up to an event, I think by telling them it is a world record event is the key thing. For them, they are going to be part of history. They are going to be record breaking themselves and then making it enjoyable.”Pereira added that the goal is to create more than just a boxing show. He said,“So the boxing is central, but also we are making this a fun festival atmosphere that goes around that. Instead of just one act, we are talking about multiple acts, a fan village, and a full experience for people coming out.”When it comes to star power, Pereira made it clear that Tyson Fury is at the top of the wish list.“For me, I think the big name at the moment is Tyson Fury. He is back and I think it is for the big events. It is something that would suit him down to the ground,” Pereira said.Fury retired in January 2025 after back-to-back losses to Oleksandr Usyk in 2024 but later confirmed he plans to return to the ring in 2026. That timeline fits perfectly with iVisit Boxing’s future plans.Pereira also stressed the importance of a strong Hispanic presence on the card, especially in California.“Being in California, we have got to look at a strong Hispanic card. A strong Mexican card is critical,” he said.That is where Ryan Garcia, 27, comes in. Garcia headlined the Times Square card in a loss to Rolly Romero, 30, but remains one of the most popular fighters in the United States. Garcia is set to return on February 21 in a WBC welterweight world title bout, according to official boxing schedules.Pereira explained Garcia’s wide appeal by saying,“It is about bringing it to the guy in the pub who likes to go for a pint and making them engage with it. What Ryan Garcia does here in the US is bring in a broader fan base as well.”Learning from the New York event, Pereira promised that fans in San Francisco will be closer than ever to the action.“What we are going to create in San Francisco is an event where there are no fences up between the crowd and the ring and the boxers,” he said.“My guiding light is to bring boxing back to the people, with clear line of sight for all those turning up to see the boxing.”The San Francisco show will be the first event in iVisit Boxing’s new “Iconic” series, with more than 12 events planned in 2026, each in a different city.Also Read: Anthony Joshua Resumes Workouts After Tragic Nigeria Crash That Killed Teammates As Uncertainty Surrounds His Boxing Future","Ivisit boxing and ed pereira target tyson fury and ryan garcia for record-breaking san francisco card.

Gardner Minshew could be Chiefs’ safest option amid Patrick Mahomes’ ACL recovery; NFL insider reveals,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/gardner-minshew-could-be-chiefs-safest-option-amid-patrick-mahomes-acl-recovery-nfl-insider-reveals/articleshow/126584750.cms,"Gardner Minshew emerges as short-term option for Kansas City (Image via: Getty Images)

Why Gardner Minshew makes sense as a temporary solution for Kansas City



Uncle Rico and the legend of Gardner Minshew | NFL Countdown

The Kansas City Chiefs are navigating an offseason defined by uncertainty at quarterback, a position that has rarely raised concern during the Patrick Mahomes era. Mahomes’ torn ACL has left the organization without a firm return timeline, and while optimism remains, there is a realistic possibility he may not be ready for the opening weeks of the 2026 NFL season.That uncertainty has forced the Chiefs to think pragmatically about their short-term options. Rather than focusing on long-term upside or dramatic roster moves, the priority is maintaining offensive structure early in the season while allowing Mahomes the time needed to fully recover. The discussion now centers on finding a quarterback capable of steady execution without disrupting the broader identity of the team.NFL insider Nick Shook believes the simplest option may also be the most effective, pointing to Gardner Minshew as a logical short-term answer for Kansas City. Minshew served as Patrick Mahomes’ primary backup during the 2025 season before suffering a late-year knee injury of his own, one that was not ACL-related and is expected to heal ahead of Mahomes’ recovery timeline. That difference alone places him in position to be available earlier, should the Chiefs need coverage at the start of 2026.“Minshew suffered a season-ending knee injury of his own, but it wasn’t an ACL tear,” Shook wrote. “He should be ready to play sooner than Mahomes, bringing veteran backup experience to a Kansas City team that suddenly needs it more than ever.”Beyond health, Minshew’s familiarity with Andy Reid’s system carries added weight. He understands the playbook, the weekly preparation demands, and the expectations inside the locker room, reducing the adjustment period that often comes with outside additions. For a team coming off a surprising 6–11 season, minimizing early disruption will be a priority.Shook also pointed to Minshew’s performance in 2023, when he stepped in for Anthony Richardson in Indianapolis and kept the Colts in postseason contention. That stretch reinforced his ability to manage games, protect the football, and keep an offense operational under pressure, traits that align with what Kansas City would require in Mahomes’ absence.Though Minshew’s personality and play style can sometimes overshadow other aspects, the value here is consistency over spectacle. If Mahomes misses some time, the goal is less to match elite production and more to maintain competitive functionality until he returns. Viewed through that angle, re-signing Minshew reflects a practical decision grounded in stability and realistic expectations.Also Read: Patrick and Brittany Mahomes join Randi for surprise birthday celebration at 1587 Prime",Gardner minshew emerges as short-term option for kansas city.

Why Marcus Mariota still matters for the Washington Commanders’ long-term plans



Heisman Trivia with 2014 Winner Marcus Mariota & 2023 Winner Jayden Daniels | Washington Commanders

The Washington Commanders entered the 2025 season with big expectations after a solid 2024. But the season didn’t go as planned. Injuries and ups and downs, especially with rookie quarterback Jayden Daniels missing games, meant the team had to lean on their backups more than they expected.That reality pushed Marcus Mariota into a role few backups truly prepare for. While the Commanders struggled overall, Mariota’s presence quietly stabilized a fragile situation. He wasn’t spectacular, nor was he expected to be. What he offered was competence, experience, and an understanding of how to manage games when circumstances unravel.Washington’s struggles were not the result of Mariota stepping in. In fact, his play highlighted why a reliable backup quarterback remains one of the most undervalued assets in the NFL. A former No. 2 overall pick, Mariota started eight games and appeared in 11, his heaviest workload since 2022. His numbers were respectable, and his performances rarely put the Commanders in deeper trouble.NFL backup Marcus Mariota proved his value during the 2025 season, stepping in whenever Jayden Daniels was sidelined. His steady play helped stabilize the Commanders’ offense during a turbulent year.""The Commanders would have been exponentially worse if Mariota hadn't been available in relief,"" NFL insider Nick Shook revealed.Mariota’s contract situation now puts Washington in a tough spot. He’s been on consecutive one-year deals and got a small raise last offseason. Letting him go would be risky, especially for a team hoping to get back into playoff contention. Experienced backup quarterbacks like Mariota, who know the system and have locker-room credibility, aren’t easy to replace.Beyond the numbers, Mariota brings experience. His career path is somewhat similar to what Daniels is going through, and having once been considered a star in the making himself, he's aware of both the pressure and difficulties of playing in the NFL. That makes him a great mentor for a young quarterback facing his first challenges.Keeping Mariota around makes sense for the Commanders. He’s more than just a backup with his stabilizing presence, a mentor for Daniels, and a proven NFL quarterback who can step in when needed. Retaining him could make the difference between another shaky season and a team ready to compete.","Washington commanders might keep marcus mariota as jayden daniels’ backup.

The Philadelphia Phillies quickly locked up the man they admired for a long time: catcher J.T. Realmuto, with a three-year, $45 million contract. This deal comes at a critical juncture in the offseason, when the Phillies just lost out on one of their top free-agent targets, Bo Bichette, to the New York Mets. Philadelphia clearly values continuity and leadership as it recalibrates its roster plans around the All-Star catcher.Bichette changed the Phillies' offseason template with his absence, but Realmuto's return keeps one of the toughest positions on the field in place. Despite being 39 years old, the veteran catcher is still a steady contributor in the lineup and provides a steady hand behind the plate for the pitching staff. Philadelphia opted for stability by avoiding frenzies and quick changes, and they paid for a player who has been at the heart of its recent success.As for Realmuto, he has been one of baseball's most complete catchers since joining the Philadelphia Phillies in 2019. He has been named an All-Star and has won Gold Gloves over the years, establishing a reputation for plus defense, game-calling, and durability. The $45 million agreement runs through the 2028 season but has triggers that could raise the deal's maximum value.Realmuto keeps churning out solid performances on the field. He provided double-digit home runs, respectable on-base figures, and decent defensive metrics behind the plate last year. But, most importantly for the Phillies, his internal knowledge of the rotation and bullpen is considered irreplaceable. Keeping Realmuto means the organization keeps chemistry intact while younger pitchers continue to develop.Earlier this week, the Mets made waves by signing Bo Bichette to a 3-year, $126 million contract. The shortstop had been heavily linked to Philadelphia, and the announcement of his destination in New York meant the Phillies had to change course swiftly. Rather than overreacting in an emotional response, the club went with a known commodity in the clubhouse.Hitting Bichette in New York and adding a high-impact bat to an already difficult division make life far more difficult for any National League East contender. Having acquired the player, the Phillies now turn their attention to complementary moves that will deepen the roster and address holes. While the disappointment of missing out on Bichette lingers, the re-signing of Realmuto signals a commitment to stability and a belief that their existing core can continue to contend.Also Read: Nico Hoerner vs Nick Castellanos net worth comparison: A closer look at earnings, contracts, and who wins","Philadelphia phillies sign j.t.

The Cleveland Cavaliers visit the Philadelphia 76ers on January 16, 2026, in a game that matters for both teams. Each is sitting close to .500, and the Eastern Conference standings leave little room for long losing streaks. This matchup offers a clear test of depth, health, and late-game execution.Donovan Mitchell and Tyrese Maxey will be at the center of everything. With key teammates out on both sides, the ball will be in their hands more than usual. Philadelphia gets the benefit of playing at Xfinity Mobile Arena, but the recent results between these teams show this is far from a one-sided matchup.Philadelphia is favored by a small margin at home. The 76ers are priced around -1.5, while Cleveland sits near +106 on the moneyline. The total is mostly set at 235.5 points, with a few books closer to 232.5. The line suggests a quick-paced game led by guard scoring, with Philadelphia holding a slight edge on its home floor.Cleveland comes in with a 23-19 record. The Cavaliers have had issues covering the spread overall, but they have been reliable as road underdogs against Eastern Conference opponents, covering 11 of their last 12 in that role.Philadelphia is 22-17 and has been sharp in January with a 5-2 record.During that stretch, the 76ers have ranked near the top of the league on both ends of the floor and have consistently covered at home, particularly following a loss.The Philadelphia 76ers have averaged just over 114 points across their last five games, including a comfortable win over Washington. Cleveland, however, has had the upper hand in this matchup recently. The Cavaliers beat Philadelphia 133-106 earlier this week and have won five of the last six meetings. One of those wins came in November, when Mitchell scored 46 in a 132-121 result. That said, Cleveland has dropped four straight road games following wins, a trend that has raised concerns.Tyrese Maxey over 26.5 points stands out given how often he has been scoring at that level. Donovan Mitchell over 6.5 assists is worth a look with Cleveland short-handed and relying more on him to create. Evan Mobley under 0.5 made threes fits his recent shooting pattern, while VJ Edgecombe over 1.5 steals has hit consistently.Philadelphia holds a small advantage due to home court and healthier star availability. The expectation is a close game, with the 76ers edging out a 118-114 win. The lean is toward Philadelphia -1.5, with the total slightly favoring the under if the pace slows late.","The cleveland cavaliers visit the philadelphia 76ers on january 16, 2026.

Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson have always supported each other, despite the latter’s move to Dallas Mavericks

Klay Thompson surpassed Damian Lillard to become the fourth all-time leader in 3-point field goals made, cementing his place in NBA history with an incredible display of skill. This noteworthy accomplishment occurred on Thursday night during a thrilling game that showcased Thompson's accuracy from beyond the arc. He is currently at 2,805 and counting.Following this remarkable achievement, Stephen Curry shared a message of encouragement for the fellow NBA great. To put things in perspective, Curry and Thompson formed one of the greatest backcourts in NBA history for 13 years, but their collaboration came to a stop when Thompson moved to Dallas in the 2024 offseason.In the NBA's three-point record books, Klay Thompson adds another chapter. In the NBA's all-time record for three-pointers made, the veteran Dallas Mavericks player overtook Damian Lillard. With 1:17 remaining in the second quarter, Thompson moved past the Portland Trail Blazers star thanks to a trifecta.The news made Golden State Warriors legend Stephen Curry extremely happy. His reaction tells it all as Thompson now has 2,805 three-pointers. He took to his Instagram Stories, shared the scores and wrote:“Yeahhh Killa!”With 4,201 triples and counting, his Splash Brother and former Golden State teammate Steph Curry continues to retain the top spot.Because of their near-perfect three-point shooting mechanics and exceptional efficiency, the two backcourt stars were a nightmare to defend in the half-court and during transition.Thompson, on the other hand, is shooting close to 37% from the field and averaging 11.3 points in 38 games thus far. Despite missing two entire seasons in 2019–20 and 2020–21 due to ACL and Achilles injuries, Thompson accomplished the feat. In any case, he will always be regarded as one of the best shooters in the game.Before Thompson signed a sign-and-trade with the Dallas Mavericks in 2024, Curry and Thompson shared four titles in the Bay. He has consistently expressed interest in Klay. He even discussed the possibility of Thompson returning to the Bay this season under Mike Dunleavy Jr.He wrote Thompson a four-word message about it in December 2025. Curry told Tim MacMahon and Anthony Slater of ESPN:“It would be unbelievable.. If that time comes and that conversation is had, of course, I'm calling him and saying, 'We want you back.' And hopefully, that would be a welcome message to him. But as we stand right now, that does seem like a far-distant reality. But so did him leaving.""Additionally, they have helped one another. During the Golden State Warriors' Christmas Day game against the Dallas Mavericks last year, Curry paid tribute to his buddy and former teammate by donning Thompson's sneakers.Following the Mavs' 126-116 defeat, Thompson talked on witnessing Curry wear his iconic shoes. Thompson stated to reporters:""It was great. It was really cool.. Wish he didn't get a win in 'em, but it was awesome. A lot of respect.""After the game, Curry joked that he didn't have any intention behind his choice of sneakers, attributing it to a coincidence that Thompson's sneaker shoes were in his size.Also read: Heartwarming family moments steal the spotlight as Stephen Curry and Ayesha Curry ring in 2026 with love, gratitude, and courtside joy","Klay thompson surpassed damian lillard to become the fourth all-time leader in 3-point field goals made.

Bears hold a clear weather edge

Also Read:

The Los Angeles Rams are heading into one of the toughest environments in football, and Tom Brady believes the weather alone could tilt the balance. Ahead of the Rams’ divisional-round clash against the Chicago Bears, Brady offered a clear warning about how extreme cold can quietly work against quarterbacks who are used to warmer conditions.The game at Soldier Field is expected to be played in freezing temperatures, with strong winds making conditions even harsher. For Brady, who built much of his playoff legacy in New England winters, this is not just small talk. He knows exactly how unforgiving January football in Chicago can be.Speaking on FOX Sports, Brady admitted that even experienced quarterbacks can be “softened” by time spent in warmer climates. While he acknowledged that Matthew Stafford has played in cold-weather cities before, Brady stressed that habits change quickly.He pointed to his own move from New England to Tampa Bay as an example. After years of playing in freezing conditions, he said it did not take long to adjust to warmth and lose that edge in the cold. According to him, the difference between 30 degrees and sub-zero wind chills can be massive, especially when grip, muscle movement, and timing come into play.Stafford spent years with the Detroit Lions, but many of those games were played indoors.Since joining the Los Angeles Rams, he has been based in California, where cold-weather preparation is not part of daily life. That matters because cold air can stiffen fingers, slow reactions, and affect ball control all critical for a quarterback who relies on timing and precision.Reports suggest Stafford may even use extra gear, such as thermal layers, to cope with the cold. But Brady warned that too much protection can also limit movement. Finding the right balance is a challenge in itself.Brady believes the Bears have a strong advantage simply because of familiarity. Chicago has already played multiple games in freezing conditions this season, and their players are used to adjusting routines, equipment, and mindset accordingly.The Rams, by contrast, are coming off a warm-weather playoff win and now face a sudden shift. For an offense that thrives on rhythm and passing efficiency, swirling winds and icy air could disrupt their flow.Brady didn't count the Rams out, even though he warned them.
