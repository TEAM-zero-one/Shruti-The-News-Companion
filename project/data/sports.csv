Anna Kournikova, 44, reveals pregnancy with Enrique Iglesias after health scare

Anna Kournikova and Enrique Iglesias’ family life in Miami

“It was just meant to be sweet in the moment. I honestly didn’t mean to confuse people.

I thought it’d be easier for the audience to understand than if I said ‘my girl.’”

“I’ve never really thought marriage would make a difference. Maybe it’s because I come from divorced parents, but I don’t think you love someone more because of a piece of paper.”

Former tennis star Anna Kournikova, 44, is pregnant with her fourth child with long-time partner, singer Enrique Iglesias, 50. The news was reported on Thursday by Spanish magazine Hola, which said that the Russian athlete is already halfway through her pregnancy and “everything is going well. ” This comes only months after she was spotted in a wheelchair in Miami, wearing a protective boot, sparking concern about her health.The couple, who have been together since 2001, already share three children- twins Lucy and Nicholas, both 7, and their younger daughter Mary, who is 5.Anna Kournikova was last photographed in early August in Miami, where she was seen taking her children to martial arts classes, a rare public outing that reassured fans after earlier health concerns.Anna Kournikova retired from professional tennis in 2003 at just 21 after repeated injuries to her back and feet. Her health history made the sight of her in a wheelchair in January this year especially worrying for fans. She was seen at Bal Harbour Mall in Miami, wearing an orthopedic boot, but later appeared to recover well.Anna Kournikova and Iglesias have built a private family life in Miami, where the Spanish singer has lived since the late 1990s. The couple first met in 2001 when Kournikova appeared in Enrique Iglesias’s music video for his hit single Escape. Although they have been together for over two decades, they have never confirmed if they are married. Iglesias once explained in 2012:He also shared his views on marriage, saying:The couple recently expanded their property portfolio in Miami by purchasing a five-bedroom home in Bay Point for $6.5 million, according to the Miami Herald.Also Read: “No Room For Emotions”: Novak Djokovic Reveals How Athlete Stereotypes Hurt His Relationship With Wife Jelena While Enrique Iglesias continues touring worldwide, Kournikova has kept a very low profile.

Danger Pro Wrestling books Raja Jackson for upcoming San Diego appearance,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/international-sports/danger-pro-wrestling-books-raja-jackson-for-upcoming-san-diego-appearance/articleshow/123591188.cms,"Raja Jackson (Image Source: musingswithmorales_podcsst/Instagram)

A stunt or a serious booking by Danger Pro?

Fallout from the KnokX Pro incident

Danger Pro Wrestling, a San Diego–based independent wrestling promotion, has recently generated interest and scorn alike by announcing that it will be using Raja Jackson, son of former UFC champion Quinton “Rampage” Jackson, at one of its upcoming shows.This is Jackson's first scheduled appearance since the August KnokX Pro Wrestling event, where he attacked wrestler Syko Stu, who was left with critical facial injuries requiring a stay in the hospital. The promotion has not yet confirmed the date or opponent for Jackson's appearance, although social media accounts suggest an announcement is forthcoming.Now, skepticism abounds from wrestling fans and insiders alike, with many asking if this booking is real or merely the latest effort to turn Jackson's drama into a money-making venture. If Danger Pro makes the move sound brash, some fan observers are labeling it as opportunistic and highlighting discrepancies. For example, Danger Pro's supposed prior WWE ID, a designation that they apparently have never really held.Shades of it reverberate among wrestling's community, too, fans deeming it ""reprehensible"" that Jackson's being afforded such a platform in the wake of the violent incident so recently.Some have said the choice diminishes the gravity of what took place and could lead to more backlash from viewers and veteran members of the industry.The context for this booking is very troubling. Raja Jackson slammed Syko Stu to the mat and rained down in excess of 20 punches to his head, most whilst unresponsive, when he entered the ring during the KnokX Pro Wrestling event on August 23. Has since touched off an LAPD probe, stoked considerable fury, and sparked questions about the operations of KnokX Wrestling and its connections.Also Read: Who is Raja Jackson?

Support from the wrestling community has poured in since then in the form of general donations and public support statements, but so has outrage against Jackson.","Raja jackson, son of former ufc champion quinton ""rampage"" jackson, has been booked by independent wrestling promotion danger pro.

From football talk to a life-changing revelation

A fan's tribute that left Jayden Daniels speechless

Beyond the gridiron: Daniels wants to be remembered right

A rookie already cementing his place in Washington hearts

Washington Commanders quarterback Jayden Daniels has grown accustomed to headlines about his dazzling play on the field, but nothing prepared him for the news he heard after Thursday’s practice — a local fan revealed she had named her newborn after him. What began as a routine media session about the return of star receiver Terry McLaurin turned into a deeply human moment, showing just how quickly the rookie sensation has made his mark on Washington.Daniels stood at the podium at Commanders Park, fielding questions about McLaurin’s much-awaited return and Washington’s looming Week 1 clash with the New York Giants. The discussion centered around preparation, chemistry, and how the offense was beginning to click under his leadership.Then came a curveball. A reporter shared a fan’s story from outside the stadium — that after watching Daniels play, she had chosen to name her baby after him. The young quarterback, usually calm and measured, broke into a grin and paused in disbelief.Asked if he could have ever imagined inspiring something so personal, Daniels laughed before shaking his head. “Nah, I can’t even lie. Nah, I did not,” he said, still smiling at the thought.For him, it wasn’t about fame or numbers.“I would say it’s cool, but just the impact I want to leave for sure. I want people to just talk good about me when I’m not around, in the room. Outside of just me being a football player, as a role model and somebody in the community, that’s kind of the biggest thing, but to have somebody name a baby after me is kind of crazy.”The moment captured more than just a quarterback’s surprise — it underlined Daniels’ desire to be remembered for more than touchdowns and highlight reels. Still only 23, he already carries himself with a maturity that resonates with fans across Washington.He emphasized that legacies are built as much off the field as they are on it. Respect in the locker room, admiration in the community, and being a figure kids can look up to matter just as much to him as stats on a scoreboard. For one fan, his story was powerful enough to shape her child’s identity.Few quarterbacks in the NFL ’s modern era have experienced such immediate impact, both in performance and in emotional connection with a city. Daniels’ arrival has injected fresh hope into a franchise eager for revival. Stories like Thursday’s show that his influence is already stretching beyond wins and losses.For the Commanders, the narrative heading into Week 1 is about football. But for the fan who named her baby after Daniels, and for the quarterback himself, it’s also about something larger — the ability of sports to inspire, to connect, and to leave lasting marks on people’s lives in ways no playbook can script.Also read: Chicago Bears fifth-round rookie Zah Frazier will sit out 2025 season after personal issue emerges",Fan names baby after jayden daniels is a tribute he calls 'kind of crazy'washington commanders quarterback jayden daniel has grown accustomed to headlines about his dazzling play on the field.

Connor McDavid prioritizes patience and perspective

Edmonton’s confidence in their captain’s future

The future of Connor McDavid , widely considered the best player in hockey today, has been a constant source of speculation in Edmonton and across the NHL. With just one season left on his current eight-year, $100 million contract, fans and analysts alike have wondered if the Oilers captain is prepared to lock in his long-term future or test the waters of free agency. This week, McDavid addressed those questions directly, offering insight into why he isn’t in a hurry to make a decision.Speaking to reporters, Connor McDavid emphasized that his approach hasn’t changed since the summer. “I said at the end of June, I had every intention to take my time with it, and I still feel the same way,” he explained. “I’ll take my time and go through everything with my family, my agent, and everybody involved.”While his next deal will likely reshape the league financially, McDavid stressed that his focus remains on winning. “I have every intention to win in Edmonton,” he said. “That’s my only focus, maybe next to winning a gold medal with Canada. But that is my intention: to win there.”Despite the uncertainty, Oilers leadership remains optimistic. Jeff Jackson, the team’s CEO of hockey operations and McDavid’s former agent, downplayed concerns of a prolonged saga.“He has another year. He loves playing in Edmonton… It’s not going to be a long negotiation,” Jackson said on The Sheet with Jeff Marek Podcast.With training camp set to open on September 17 and the season beginning October 8 against rival Calgary, McDavid is determined to keep the focus on hockey. “All options are on the table, really,” he said. “We’re going through it slowly.”Also Read: Amid contract deadline Connor McDavid and Lauren Kyle spark buzz as they take a private jet back to Edmonton","The future of connor mcdavid has been a constant source of speculation in edmonton and across the nhl.

Deion Sanders and Shilo’s future after Buccaneers exit

“We’re praying that he gets another opportunity to go with a team. But if he doesn’t, the plans have already been put forward to what he’s going to do next.”

Shilo Sanders’ first shot at the NFL ended suddenly when the Tampa Bay Buccaneers released him just one day after he was ejected in a preseason game. The 24-year-old defensive back, son of Hall of Famer Deion Sanders, was tossed out of the Bucs vs. Bills game on Saturday, August 24, 2025, in Tampa, Florida, for throwing a punch. Hours later, the Buccaneers announced they had waived him, closing the door on his rookie season before it even began. His father stayed calm, but his mother, Pilar Sanders, spoke out sharply against the decision.The turning point came late in the preseason finale between the Buccaneers and the Buffalo Bills. Tight end Zach Davidson of Buffalo locked onto Shilo Sanders and dragged him 15 yards downfield, with his hand inside Shilo’s helmet.The referees let the play continue without a flag. At the end of the run, Sanders snapped, swung his fist, and hit Davidson’s helmet right in front of an official. That moment led to an immediate penalty and ejection.Head coach Todd Bowles was clear after the game:By the very next afternoon, Tampa Bay made it official—they cut Sanders from the roster.Shilo Sander’s mother, Pilar Sanders, did not hold back. On Sunday, August 25, she posted a TikTok video on Instagram questioning the league’s handling of the play. The video was labeled,and pointed out that referees ignored Davidson dragging Shilo for 15 yards but only punished Sanders after he defended himself.Pilar Sanders argued that the officials failed to act until it was too late and then placed all the blame on her son. For her, this was not just about one penalty, it was about her son’s chance to play in his rookie year being cut short.Deion Sanders, head coach of the Colorado Buffaloes, spoke more calmly after the incident. “I prepared my kids for any and everything that could possibly happen in life and in sports,” he said, adding, “Shilo’s a man of many talents, and he’s going to be straight. All of the Sanders are going to be straight, with or without football. You better believe that.”Also Read: DJ Lagway signs NIL deal with Jordan Brand ahead of Florida Gators 2025 season opener Shilo Sanders, who signed with Tampa Bay after going undrafted in April 2025, had agreed to a three-year deal worth nearly $3 million.

“I can’t get mad at God for making me look like him.”

“I’m trying to be my own guy,”

When Dylan Raiola showed up at Arrowhead Stadium for Nebraska’s Friday night showdown, you’d think the Kansas City Chiefs were about to play. The reason?

Michael Jordan wins $8.9 million lawsuit against Dominick’s in 2015

Michael Jordan donates the proceeds and supports Chicago children

Also Read:

Even after retiring from the NBA, Michael Jordan has remained a strong and determined figure. Off the court, he is just as careful about his rights as he was about his game. One story from 2015 shows how seriously he protects his personal identity. Jordan’s actions sent a clear message about defending personal rights and giving back to the community at the same time.The case began in Chicago, Illinois, where Michael Jordan, the Hall of Famer and six-time NBA champion, noticed his name was used without permission. The Chicago-based supermarket chain Dominick’s, a subsidiary of Safeway that later closed in 2013, ran an advertisement in 2011 featuring Jordan’s name to promote a meat sale in a Sports Illustrated special issue. Jordan’s legal team said the chain had no right to use his name.The supermarket first offered a settlement of about $126,900, but Michael Jordan’s lawyers argued that the sum should match the real advertising value of his name. After the court reviewed the case, Jordan won $8.9 million. ESPN reported his comments after the verdict, saying,“No one, whether or not they’re a public figure, should have to worry about their identity being used without their permission.”Jordan added, “I hope this case sends a clear message…that I will continue to be vigilant about protecting my name and identity.”He further added:""The case was not about the money, as I plan to donate the proceeds to charity. It was about honesty and integrity.... I also hope the size of the monetary reward will deter others from using someone else's identity and believing they will only pay a small penalty.""Michael Jordan made it clear that the lawsuit was not about money. Instead, it was about integrity, honesty, and defending his personal rights. He pledged to donate the full $8.9 million to 23 charities in Chicago that support children’s health, education, and well-being. In a news release shared with ABA Journal, Jordan said, “Chicago has given me so much, and I want to give back to its kids, the city’s future.”At 62, Michael Jordan stands as more than a basketball legend—he is a cultural icon. The Dominick’s case highlights how he fiercely defends his rights and turns his victories into ways to help others.His careful attention to personal identity also comes amid other legal challenges, such as his 2015 lawsuit in China against Qiaodan Sports, which uses his name and number 23 without permission. This story originally appeared on ESPN and ABA Journal and highlights Michael Jordan’s commitment to personal rights, community support, and integrity both on and off the courtWith a $10 million contribution to Novant, Michael Jordan helped open his fourth ""Michael Jordan Family Medical Clinic"" in Wilmington, his hometown, in February 2025. The facility, which is 7,300-sq-ft and open to patients from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., offers primary care services in twelve patient rooms for underinsured and uninsured patients across five operating days each weekday. Building on earlier Charlotte and Wilmington clinics, Jordan's sincere comments stressed the importance of providing premium healthcare access to the neighborhood that molded him.","""i want to give back to kids"" - michael jordan proudly donated $8.9 million after winning supermarket lawsuit in 2015.

EuroBasket 2025 is in full swing, with European teams featuring major NBA stars. The likes of Luka Doncic, Nikola Jokic, and Giannis Antetokounmpo are representing their nations. Greece, led by Giannis, opened its campaign with a victory over Italy, observed by Milwaukee Bucks assistant coach Darvin Ham. During the game, Ham commented on the differences in Giannis Antetokounmpo’s role between the Greek national team and the Bucks He noted that in the NBA, Giannis has a significantly higher usage rate, constantly handling the ball and playing a central, high-energy role, likened to being “Superman.” In contrast, Greece’s style is more team-oriented, relying on structured plays and a slower pace compared to the fast-paced NBA. Ham also commended the two-time NBA MVP for his ability to involve teammates effectively in Greece’s system.Ham, who won the inaugural NBA In-Season Tournament as head coach of the Los Angeles Lakers and later saw the Bucks claim the NBA Cup last season, remains undefeated in the tournament. Ham joined Doc Rivers’ staff last season for his second stint with Milwaukee, and saw Giannis finish third in MVP voting. Despite his regular-season dominance, the Bucks fell short in the playoffs, suffering a disappointing first-round exit against Tyrese Haliburton and the Indiana Pacers.EuroBasket 2025 began on Thursday, with all teams starting their campaigns.

Jake Paul lines up fights before possible clash with Anthony Joshua

Anthony Joshua is back in the gym just three months after having elbow surgery in May 2025. Looking fit in a fresh social media video where he observed shadow boxing and perspiring it out, the 35-year-old former two-time heavyweight boxing champion. Since September 2024, when he was knocked out by another British Daniel Dubois in London, Joshua has not been in the ring.

Ever since his defeat to Daniel Dubois at the O2 Arena on September 21, 2024, the former Olympic gold medalist is aware that admirers have been looking for his comeback.That loss was among the most challenging of his career; the surgery soon after sidelined him from sports for months.On the other side, YouTuber-turned-boxer Jake Paul continues to chase big names.

What Luka Doncic said and how it was communicated

Report: Luka Doncic Wants LeBron James To Retire With Lakers, What It Would Mean For Future

LeBron James personally welcomed Luka Doncic

With the 2025-26 season coming closer, the Los Angeles Lakers are making a critical choice, and trade speculation surrounding their legendary forward, LeBron James is rife. At the heart of this mess, though, is the new star of the team Luka Doncic, who has apparently told the Lakers management he wants James to remain in the purple and gold.Doncic, the 26-year-old Slovenian prodigy who joined the Los Angeles Lakers in a major trade this year, has communicated his views directly to the team's front office, highlighting his wish for James to continue as a Laker.Details of the message sent by Doncic were revealed with the help of information given by trusted NBA sources. Anthony Irwin of ClutchPoints was one of the first ones to draw attention to the issue, writing that Luka Doncic had told Lakers GM Rob Pelinka and other key players about his stance.Irwin noted, ""For his part, league sources also indicated Doncic did not want James traded, but also understood James needing to figure out what was best for him the last couple seasons of his career."".Another point to consider is that a YouTube report from late July 2025 cited sources claiming Doncic specifically hopes James will ""retire with the Lakers,"" as he views him as a mentor and a crucial element for immediate success.In a clip from an interview that Newsweek shared, Doncic complimented James, stating, ""It was an amazing experience. I always looked up to him, the way he approaches the game, his professionalism.""To really grasp Doncic's role, we need to look back at the major changes in the Lakers' lineup. In February 2025, the Lakers executed one of the most surprising trades in NBA history, bringing Doncic over from the Dallas Mavericks in a multi-team deal that sent Anthony Davis, a bunch of young talents, and several first-round picks in return. The trade was revealed during the All-Star break, and Doncic mentioned in a February press conference that ""LeBron called me right away to welcome me to LA. ""The Los Angeles Lakers made this move because they want to lock in a long-term key player as James, now 40, approaches the end of his amazing career. James, who inked a two-year extension in 2024 with a player option for 2025-26, has a no-trade clause that allows him to block any trades. Still, the team's showing in the 2024-25 season where they got knocked out in the first round of the playoffs, raised doubts about whether the Lakers can compete with an aging James as their main guy.Around mid-2025, there was growing speculation that the Lakers might think about trading James to a contender such as the Golden State Warriors or Miami Heat, likely in exchange for assets to enhance the roster surrounding Doncic. ESPN's NBA insiders took a closer look at this, highlighting that the team had locked in Doncic with a three-year, $165 million extension and was now considering strategies to optimize his prime years.Also Read: Throwback to Stephen Curry’s early explosions that left legends embarrassed and fans obsessed Luka Doncic's message about keeping James shows his maturity and focus on the team, but in the end, it's up to James and Pelinka to decide.

For now, the speculation continues, but Doncic's perspective makes a strong case for stability in Los Angeles.","Luka doncic has told the los angeles lakers management he wants lebron james to remain in the purple and gold.

Jason Whitlock did not hold back in calling ESPN’s decision to replace Doris Burke a mistake

""They may have just put Tim Legler in a losing position because Legler and Richard Jefferson, that's not gonna be as good as Jeff Van Gundy and Mark Jackson.

It doesn't sound like a number one team to me.""

The REAL Reason ESPN DUMPED Doris Burke from NBA Broadcasting Team

Jason Whitlock expressed disappointment with Doris Burke’s previous work

""Everybody, including me, loved Doris Burke. As a change of pace on lower-tier NBA games, everybody loved her. They [ESPN] being filled up on DEI, promoted her to the number one job where expectations elevate, and she got exposed”, said Whitlock.

The longtime NBA analyst, Doris Burke, faced a setback recently when she was replaced by her colleague Tim Legler as part of the lead NBA Finals broadcast team. However, the decision seemingly did not sit well with sports commentator Jason Whitlock, who believed that ESPN made a wrong decision.In the recent edition of his Fearless with Jason Whitlock, the analyst claimed that ESPN might have made a mistake in replacing Doris Burke. He stated that it would now be an uphill battle for Tim Legler, who would have some big shoes to fill, citing the work done by top names before him, like Mark Jackson and Jeff Van Gundy.He said,In 2023, ESPN laid off the impeccable duo of Jeff Van Gundy and Mark Jackson. Both men, alongside play-by-play commentator Mike Breen, called the action for 15 NBA Finals. Following their send-off, Doris Burke was given the role of a color commentator, joining Richard Jefferson.While Jason Whitlock advocated for Doris Burke’s two-year tenure as part of the lead NBA Finals broadcast team, he also brought up her previous work.The sports commentator did not hold back in admitting that her performances did not live up to the expectations and “she got exposed.”Furthermore, ESPN's decision has received a mixed reaction from NBA fans online. The sports outlet and ABC have retained rights to top games, while new partners like Amazon Prime and NBC are back for regular-season and playoff coverage.On the other hand, Doris Burke will be calling some NBA games alongside Dave Pasch, while Tim Legler gears up to assume duties for the NBA Finals broadcasting team.
