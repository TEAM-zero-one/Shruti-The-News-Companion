Why Virat Kohli in India XI for World Cup 2027 will be bad news | Greenstone Lobo predicts

NEW DELHI: Opener Rohit Sharma struck an unbeaten century, Virat Kohli made a fighting half-century, and pacer Harshit Rana grabbed four wickets as India defeated Australia by nine wickets in the third and final ODI on Saturday, though they lost the series 1-2.Rana’s brilliant spell of 4/39 helped bowl Australia out for 236 in 46.4 overs, setting the stage for a dominant Indian chase. Rohit then led the way with an unbeaten 121 off 125 balls. He first shared a crucial 69-run opening partnership with Shubman Gill (24) before joining forces with Kohli (74* off 81 balls) for an unbroken 168-run stand, guiding India to the target in 38.3 overs.After reaching his half-century, Kohli initially forgot to acknowledge the crowd or celebrate, until Rohit signaled him to mark the milestone.Watch the video here During the innings, Kohli also broke another record, becoming the second-highest run-getter in ODI cricket. The No.3 batter, famously known as the 'Chase Master,' overcame subdued form in the first two ODIs to register his 75th ODI fifty and surpass 2,500 runs against Australia in the format.Kohli also surpassed Sri Lankan great Kumar Sangakkara’s tally of 14,234 runs (in 404 ODIs) in his 293rd ODI innings. The former India captain now sits just behind legendary Sachin Tendulkar , who leads with 18,426 runs. Impressively, Kohli maintains a superior average of 57.69 across 305 ODIs, compared to Tendulkar’s 44.83 in 463 matches.With his career nearing its end in ODIs, Kohli is set to finish as the second-highest run-getter behind his idol, Tendulkar.In the match, Kohli’s unbeaten 74, including seven fours, and Rohit’s 33rd ODI ton — which was also his 50th international century — powered India to a nine-wicket victory at the Sydney Cricket Ground, even as Australia secured the series 2-1. Rohit was named both Player of the Match and Player of the Series for scoring 202 runs across three games.The two sides will now clash in a five-match T20I series, beginning October 29.","Opener rohit sharma struck an unbeaten century, virat kohli made a fighting half-century as india defeated australia by nine wickets in the third and final odi on saturday.

A love story built on patience and a dream proposal in Italy



Green Bay Packers quarterback Jordan Love made big headlines when he took over as the leader of Titletown. But behind the rising NFL star is someone just as driven and spotlight-worthy: his wife, Ronika Stone. The pair exchanged vows in June 2025, capping off a romance that has endured long-distance challenges, viral fame, and a shared love of sports at the highest level.Stone was born on June 7, 1998, in the San Jose area, where sports weren’t just a hobby but the family foundation. Her father is former NFL offensive lineman Ron Stone, a two-time Super Bowl champion with the Dallas Cowboys who also played for the Giants, 49ers, and Raiders. Her siblings also chose athletic paths, creating what she once described as a childhood full of contests and friendly rivalry.""It's really cool because we're all super competitive,"" she said of the Stone household, where jump-rope challenges and push-up races became training tools for life.Ronika didn’t just inherit athleticism, she carved her own lane as a standout middle blocker at the University of Oregon.She set program records in hitting percentage and block assists, becoming one of the most decorated players in Ducks volleyball history. After college, her career turned global with professional stints in France, Puerto Rico, Athletes Unlimited, and most recently, San Diego Pro Volleyball.NFL fans may also remember when she became a viral sensation in 2021 after being photographed with Love’s mom in the very last row at Arrowhead Stadium. Rather than bristle at the attention, she joked, ""The view was better than it seemed I swear!"" Her wit won over fans almost instantly.Stone and Love went Instagram-official back in 2020 and later endured months apart during the pandemic. A joyful reunion shared on TikTok proved their bond was built to last. In June 2024, surrounded by the magic of a Tuscan castle, Love proposed and captioned the moment, ""First step to forever.""Now officially Mr. and Mrs. Love, the power couple continues to shine: he commands the field, and she brings the energy from the court to every stadium she steps into.Also Read: Jordan Love vs Aaron Rodgers stats: How the Packers’ new franchise QB is stacking up against the Steelers veteran since 2024","Ronika stone is the wife of green bay packers quarterback jordan love.

Anthony Edwards exits after just three minutes and eight seconds in Timberwolves ’ home opener

Minnesota Timberwolves confirms Anthony Edwards’ hamstring tightness

Immediate impact of Anthony Edward's injury on Minnesota Timberwolves' game plan

The Minnesota Timberwolves started their home opener with great expectations, but it quickly turned into a moment of concern. Anthony Edwards , the team’s promising star, went out early after what appeared to be a standard play. His unexpected exit quieted the audience and shifted the focus from the game’s score to the uncertain future of their main player.In an unexpected turn of events at the Minnesota Timberwolves' home opener at Target Center, superstar guard Anthony Edwards had to leave the game against the Indiana Pacers just three minutes and eight seconds into the first quarter on Sunday, October 26, 2025.The 24-year-old All-NBA player Edwards had to leave the game after experiencing tightness in his right hamstring while finishing a layup. At the point he exited, with 8:53 still on the clock in the quarter, the Timberwolves were leading the Pacers 13-5.After the play, Edwards didn't appear to be in distress right away. He added an extra deceleration step on the layup that looked a little awkward, but he didn't grab his leg or show any visible reaction immediately.Instead, he walked off the court in a relaxed way during the following timeout and made his way straight to the locker room for evaluation.In his limited time on the floor, Edwards put up five points, featuring an early three-pointer and the layup that came right before the injury, along with one rebound.Bones Hyland, the seasoned guard who joined Minnesota in the offseason, promptly checked into the game to fill in for Edwards, helping the Timberwolves sustain their early momentum.The Timberwolves' PR team swiftly shared an update on their official X account, @Twolves_PR, saying, ""Anthony Edwards (Right Hamstring Tightness) will NOT return to tonight’s game."" This update came right after Edwards' departure, at about 8:05 p.m. ET during the live airing on NBA TV and Bally Sports North. The team referred to the problem as ""hamstring tightness,"" a usual soft-tissue issue that often requires caution to steer clear of more severe strains.Timberwolves head coach Chris Finch and the medical staff had no immediate comments during the game, as the focus was on evaluating Edwards in the locker room. ESPN's broadcast mentioned that the team quickly decided to rule him out for the rest of the game, underlining the importance of looking after their franchise star early in the season.With Edwards out, the Minnesota Timberwolves relied on their depth to get through the rest of the game against the Indiana Pacers. Hyland, making his first significant appearance with Minnesota, brought some scoring energy off the bench, while key players like Julius Randle and Rudy Gobert held down the frontcourt.This setback hits Minnesota at a tricky moment, as they currently lead the Western Conference with a 2-1 record following a solid start. If Edwards is out for a while, it could throw off the chemistry they've developed with his exciting playmaking, especially as they bring in new players like Randle and Hyland.Anthony Edwards leaving felt like a quick halt to Minnesota’s initial flow. His vibe usually sets the pace for the Timberwolves, and losing that energy so soon really challenges their stability. Now, the team has a chance to show how much they’ve developed beyond just one star player. Whether they find their footing or trip up will show just how prepared they are to compete.Also Read: Ausar Thompson dominates with tenacity and scoring as Pistons outlast physical Rockets squad","Minnesota timberwolves star anthony edwards left the game after just three minutes and eight seconds.

LSU quarterback Garrett Nussmeier is showing a lot of toughness as he navigates through visible pain while leading the Tigers’ offense against Texas A&M. The junior signal-caller took a hard hit in the first half that aggravated an existing abdominal injury, leaving him clutching his midsection and clearly writhing in discomfort. Despite the setback, Nussmeier returned to the field after halftime, determined to stay in the game and give his team a chance to compete. His presence under center is critical for LSU, but the injury has made it difficult for the offense to gain momentum, and Texas A&M quickly capitalized on the Tigers’ struggles.ABC sideline reporter Holly Rowe provided an update early in the second half, confirming that Nussmeier’s injury is being closely managed by LSU’s medical staff. “Garrett Nussmeier, we saw him get a little bit more injured in the first half, that left ab injury just below his belly button,” Rowe reported. “They are able to do some things at halftime to help him, some topical numbing cream, put some more padding on, massage. ”Despite the discomfort, Nussmeier remained in the game to start the second half. LSU’s offense, however, failed to find rhythm on its first drive after halftime, allowing Texas A&M to seize momentum with a quick touchdown and a 79-yard punt return to stretch its lead to 28-18.LSU head coach Brian Kelly made it clear that Nussmeier won’t be coming out unless absolutely necessary. According to Rowe, Kelly praised his quarterback’s resilience during her in-game report. “Coach (Brian) Kelly said, ‘He’s our guy. We can put him together with glue or tape we’re going to do it, because he wants to be out there. He’s so tough,’” Rowe said. By midway through the third quarter, Nussmeier had completed 16 of 26 passes for 139 yards and one touchdown but had been sacked three times for a loss of 22 yards.Nussmeier has been the leader of LSU’s offense all season, staying calm and making plays in tough situations. Before facing Texas A&M, he had completed 154 of 232 passes for 1,638 yards, with 11 touchdowns and five interceptions, and added a rushing score. A former four-star recruit from the 2021 class, he was ranked as the No. 11 quarterback in the nation and the No. 88 overall player. Now in his fourth year at LSU, he’s showing real toughness by continuing to lead the Tigers even while clearly dealing with pain. His effort against the Aggies may be one of the few positives in an otherwise frustrating stretch for LSU football.","Lsu quarterback garrett nussmeier is playing through significant pain due to an aggravated abdominal injury.

Lakers’ Injury Status vs Sacramento Kings (October 26, 2025)

What’s at Stake Against Sacramento

What Fans Can Expect from Tonight’s Los Angeles Lakers vs Sacramento Kings Game

remains uncertain as of October 26, 2025. The Lakers superstar guard is currently listed as questionable after suffering a sprained left finger during his 49-point explosion in Friday’s win over the Minnesota Timberwolves. Doncic appeared to jam the finger while taking a midrange jumper against Donte DiVincenzo, finishing the game with the finger splinted and heavily taped.Even with the injury concern, Luka Doncic has been in remarkable form to begin his first full season with the Los Angeles Lakers. Across two games, the 26-year-old has averaged an astounding 46.0 points, 11.5 rebounds, and 8.5 assists, setting a new franchise record for the most points scored by a Laker through the first two games of a season. He opened the campaign with 43 points against Golden State, followed by a 49-point performance versus Minnesota - narrowly missing triple-doubles on both occasions.Head coach JJ Redick has praised Doncic’s conditioning and leadership early in the season, highlighting his growth as both a scorer and a defender. Redick emphasized that Luka Doncic’s focus and efficiency have set the tone for the rest of the roster, which has looked rejuvenated under the new coaching regime.The Lakers continue to battle several health setbacks beyond Doncic. LeBron James is still sidelined with a right sciatica issue, and the team does not expect him to make his 2025–26 season debut until mid-November. Jaxson Hayes is also questionable with left knee soreness, while Maxi Kleber remains out due to an abdominal strain. Rookie Adou Thiero continues to recover from knee surgery and will also miss the game.These absences leave Los Angeles with a thin rotation, forcing greater reliance on Austin Reaves and Gabe Vincent in the backcourt. New additions Deandre Ayton and Rui Hachimura are expected to play larger roles in maintaining frontcourt stability, especially if Luka Doncic cannot go.Tonight’s clash in Sacramento could influence early momentum in the Pacific Division race. The Kings enter the matchup coming off a narrow victory over the Utah Jazz, led by the trio of Domantas Sabonis, DeMar DeRozan, and Zach LaVine. LaVine is dealing with minor discomfort but is likely to be available, giving Sacramento an extra scoring punch.If Doncic is ruled out, the Los Angeles Lakers’ offense will likely run through Reaves, who’s averaging 25.5 points and 10 assists in LeBron’s absence. Reaves’ ability to handle the ball and create plays will be key against a fast-paced Kings team that thrives on transition opportunities.If Luka Doncic plays, this matchup could turn into a showcase of two explosive offenses. His presence elevates the Los Angeles Lakers’ overall rhythm, giving them a dynamic edge few teams can match. However, if the medical team decides to rest him, Los Angeles may adopt a slower, more methodical approach centered on Reaves’ playmaking and Ayton’s inside presence.Sacramento, meanwhile, will likely try to exploit the Lakers’ limited depth by pushing the tempo and forcing mismatches in transition.Also read: Los Angeles Lkers vs Sacramento Kings injury report (October 26, 2025): Who's playing, who's out, and more As of now, Luka Doncic remains questionable for the Los Angeles Lakers’ matchup against the Kings with a left finger sprain.

Falcons face challenges in Week 8 without star receiver

Atlanta Falcons wide receiver Drake London will not play in Sunday’s Week 8 game against the Miami Dolphins at Mercedes-Benz Stadium, leaving Atlanta without one of its top offensive weapons. London, who has been managing a hip injury, was listed as questionable on Saturday but was ultimately ruled inactive ahead of the matchup. The 24-year-old has struggled with injuries this season, including a shoulder issue earlier in the year, making his absence another challenge for a Falcons offense already navigating multiple setbacks. London’s presence on the field had been critical for quarterback Michael Penix Jr., and his absence changes the dynamic for Atlanta’s passing game.The team had planned to evaluate London on Sunday morning to determine if he could play. “Falcons will check in this morning at the stadium with WR Drake London — who was added to the injury report Saturday as questionable with a hip injury — to determine whether he can play vs. the Dolphins,” ESPN’s Adam Schefter reported on X, formerly Twitter. Later, Schefter confirmed that London had been officially listed as inactive, ending any hope of seeing the star receiver take the field against Miami.Fans and analysts had speculated about London’s potential return, but the decision ensures the Falcons will have to rely on other options to stretch the field and make plays downfield.London isn’t the only key player sidelined for the Falcons. Quarterback Michael Penix Jr. is also out, and Kirk Cousins is expected to start in his place. Additional injuries have taken Storm Norton (foot), Divine Deablo (forearm), Jalon Walker (groin), and Billy Bowman Jr. (hamstring) out of action. With so many starters missing, Atlanta will have to adjust both offensively and defensively, putting extra responsibility on backups and remaining playmakers. The coaching staff will need to be creative with formations and play calls to compensate for the missing talent.The Falcons enter the game at 3-3, trying to maintain a competitive edge in the NFC South, while the Dolphins sit at 1-6.

Cam Skattebo’s breakout season takes a devastating turn

Giants facing another offensive blow amid tough season

What’s next: awaiting scans and official diagnosis

New York Giants rookie running back Cam Skattebo went from rising star to a heartbreaking scene on Sunday afternoon. During the Giants’ Week 8 clash with the Philadelphia Eagles, the 23-year-old suffered a gruesome-looking leg injury that left fans stunned and teammates surrounding him in silence. The cart, the air cast, and the emotion on Skattebo’s face said it all, this wasn’t just another knock. Here’s everything that went down, what’s known so far, and what it means for both the Giants and their promising rookie.Until today, Skattebo had been one of the brightest spots in an otherwise up-and-down season for the New York Giants. Drafted in the fourth round out of Arizona State, he’d quickly earned a role in the Giants’ offense with his burst, balance, and pass-catching versatility. Many saw him as the kind of underdog who could reshape New York’s run game.But midway through the second quarter against the Eagles, things went south fast. Skattebo caught a short pass, tried to cut upfield, and his right leg twisted awkwardly as he was tackled. He immediately grabbed his ankle in pain and the reaction from players nearby told you it was bad.Trainers rushed in as Skattebo stayed down, clearly unable to put weight on his leg.Within moments, they brought out an air cast, one of those dreaded sights that usually signals a serious injury. Fans at Lincoln Financial Field stood in respectful silence as Skattebo was loaded onto the cart, surrounded by concerned teammates.According to reports, Skattebo was officially ruled out for the remainder of the game, and the Giants later confirmed it was a right leg injury. Early visuals suggest potential ankle or lower-leg damage, though no official diagnosis has been shared yet.For the Giants, this couldn’t come at a worse time. The team has already been battling inconsistency and injuries, and Skattebo had been one of the few reliable spark plugs in their offense. His ability to run, block, and make plays after contact made him a dual-threat weapon in a system still searching for rhythm.With Skattebo sidelined, the Giants will likely turn to Devin Singletary and Tyrone Tracy Jr. to fill the gap but replacing the rookie’s energy and explosiveness won’t be easy.As of Sunday night, the Giants haven’t released full details about the nature or severity of Skattebo’s injury. Given the air cast and how his ankle appeared to bend unnaturally, early speculation points toward a fracture or major sprain either way, a potentially extended absence.Fans and analysts alike are anxiously awaiting updates from head coach Brian Daboll and the team’s medical staff. If the injury requires surgery, Skattebo’s promising rookie season could be over before November even begins.Also read - Madison Beer dethrones Taylor Swift as Spotify’s fastest-growing female artist — gains 430K listeners in one day","New york giants rookie running back cam skattebo suffered a gruesome leg injury during sunday's game against the philadelphia eagles.

tonight, October 26, 2025, as theface off against the Cleveland Cavaliers at Rocket Arena. The two-time MVP remains listed as probable with a left great toe sprain, an issue that has lingered since last week. However, the “Greek Freak” already played through the same injury in the Bucks’ previous outing, proving once again that pain is no obstacle when he’s locked in and leading his team.According to the official NBA injury report, Giannis Antetokounmpo continues to deal with the toe sprain that limited his practice sessions over the weekend. Still, he looked every bit like his dominant self in Friday’s victory over the Toronto Raptors, where he recorded 31 points, 20 rebounds, and seven assists - marking his seventh career game with that remarkable stat line or better.Head coach Doc Rivers and the Bucks’ medical team are reportedly keeping a close eye on Giannis Antetokounmpo’s workload, particularly this early in the season. Even so, all signs indicate that Milwaukee’s franchise cornerstone will take the court tonight unless an unexpected setback occurs during warmups. His availability gives the Bucks a significant boost as they aim to remain unbeaten.The Milwaukee Bucks ’ injury concerns don’t end with their superstar forward. Kyle Kuzma, who twisted his left ankle late in Friday’s contest, has been downgraded to doubtful after early optimism that he might play.Kevin Porter Jr. continues to sit out due to the same ankle issue that’s kept him sidelined since opening night, while Cole Anthony has been listed as questionable because of a non-COVID illness.Should Kuzma and Porter remain inactive, Milwaukee may turn to depth players like Myles Turner, Ryan Rollins, and Malik Beasley to carry more of the offensive load. That could also mean more responsibility for the bench unit if Giannis Antetokounmpo’s minutes are carefully managed. The Bucks are currently 2-0 and have looked impressive on both ends of the floor, but their rotation depth will be tested in this matchup.The Cavaliers, entering the game with a 1-1 record, will look to build on their recent win over the Brooklyn Nets after dropping their season opener against the New York Knicks. Donovan Mitchell and Evan Mobley have been the focal points of the team’s attack, but the absence of Darius Garland and Max Strus could impact their rhythm and shot creation against a disciplined Milwaukee defense.With the Cavs trying to find their footing early in the season and the Bucks chasing their third consecutive win, tonight’s game presents an intriguing early test for both squads. It’s a matchup that pits Milwaukee’s established chemistry and championship experience against Cleveland’s youthful energy and home-court advantage.Also read: Milwaukee Bucks vs Cleveland Cavaliers regular season game injury report: Who's playing, who's out, and more (October 26, 2025) Everything points to Giannis Antetokounmpo taking the floor tonight against the Cleveland Cavaliers, continuing his stellar start to the 2025-26 campaign despite dealing with a nagging toe injury. The Bucks are expected to handle his minutes carefully, but as long as Giannis is active, Milwaukee’s chances of extending their undefeated run remain strong.

Uncertainty grows in Boston as their star player’s comeback remains unclear

Exploring Jayson Tatum’s slow and steady road to recovery

Jayson Tatum is still recovering (Image via Instagram / @jaytatum0)

The 2025–26 NBA season officially began on Tuesday. Like many other matches, fans were eager for the Bolton Celtics vs. Detroit Pistons game. On October 26 at 3:30 p.m. ET, the Pistons will host the Celtics at the Little Caesars Arena in Detroit. The main concern now is whether Jayson Tatum, a star for the Boston Celtics, will be playing tonight. The short answer is no. Tatum's Achilles injury is still not fully healed.Without several key players, the Boston Celtics might be hoping for their first victory of the year. However, ESPN's Shams Charania stated on the Pat McAfee Show that Jayson Tatum had been declared out for the 2025–2026 season. This is due to his Achilles' recovery. He tore his Achilles tendon during the playoffs last spring.Hence, Boston may be without Jaylen Brown and new reserve centre Luka Garza in addition to Jayson Tatum . Tatum, meanwhile, is eager to participate in the game as soon as possible. Only five months after rupturing his right Achilles tendon, he hasn't put a lot of pressure on himself.Tatum said at Boston Celtics' media day on September 30:""No pressure. No pressure to return back any sooner than when I'm 100 percent healthy.No pressure from [Celtics president of basketball operations] Brad [Stevens], [coach] Joe [Mazzulla], the team, the organization. The most important thing is that I'm 100 percent recovered and healthy whenever I come back.""The All-Star appeared game-ready as he took the dais to answer questions from the media. He further said:""Today is cool.. I think tomorrow will be tough with practice starting out. I won't be able to be out there.""For a club that underwent an offseason revamp, expectations are far lower this season. Hence, for a really long time, Jaylen Brown , led the club without Tatum. However, Brown didn’t think that Tatum's absence required him to change his style of play all that much. He said during the same media day:""I'm going to approach it the same way I've always approached it.. Obviously, I'm going to have more responsibility with Jayson not being here. But also gives a chance for other guys to step up. Empowering other guys. Trusting your teammates more. Trying to accelerate guys' learning curves. And play some good basketball. I think that's what people want to see.""In May 2025, while playing the New York Knicks in a playoff game, Jayson Tatum tore his right Achilles tendon. He is currently undergoing a strict rehabilitation procedure after having surgery to fix the injuries.He is anticipated to miss a large amount of the upcoming 2025–26 season, but there is hope that he could return in February or March 2026. The Celtics initially did not specify a schedule for his comeback. Nevertheless, Tatum has resumed light basketball workouts as part of his six-day-per-week rehab program, though he would not disclose his precise recovery status.Along with fellow NBA players Tyrese Haliburton , Damian Lillard, and Dejounte Murray, who are all recovering from Achilles tendon operations, Tatum stated that he has also received help in preserving his mental health through the ""Achilles group chat"" he participates in.It has helped Tatum put his recovery into perspective and in acknowledging both minor and major accomplishments, such as getting off one crutch, then another, and then walking for the first time.Also read: ""Career flashed before my eyes’: Jayson Tatum opens up on Achilles tear as Boston Celtics await his return",The 2025–26 nba season officially began on tuesday.

What to Expect from the Matchup

will suit up and play tonight as thetake on the Milwaukee Bucks on October 26, 2025, at Rocket Arena. The Cavaliers’ All-Star guard continues to be the focal point of the team’s offense, especially as Cleveland navigates through multiple absences to key players like Darius Garland and Max Strus. Donovan Mitchell comes into tonight’s contest in peak form, showing no signs of slowing down after two explosive outings to open the 2025–26 NBA season. Following a 31-point performance in the opener against the New York Knicks, he delivered another standout showing with 35 points in Friday’s 131–124 victory over the Brooklyn Nets. With Garland still sidelined, the Cleveland Cavaliers have leaned heavily on Mitchell’s scoring and playmaking abilities - and he has responded with remarkable consistency.The team’s official report from October 26 confirmed that Mitchell is fully healthy and without any injury designation. The 28-year-old guard has averaged over 33 points per game through Cleveland’s first two matchups, demonstrating elite shooting efficiency and a renewed focus on quick offensive execution. Donovan Mitchell’s confidence and rhythm make him one of the league’s most dangerous offensive threats heading into this marquee matchup against Giannis Antetokounmpo and the Bucks.Cleveland Cavaliers continues to be short-handed as several rotation players remain sidelined.• Darius Garland (left toe injury) – Out• Max Strus (left foot fracture) – Out• De’Andre Hunter (knee soreness) – Questionable but nearing a returnDespite those setbacks, the Cavaliers have found steady production from their frontcourt. Jarrett Allen posted a 22-point, 11-rebound double-double against Brooklyn, while Evan Mobley continues to anchor the defense and rebound effectively. Through two games, Cleveland sits at 1–1 on the season, averaging just over 120 points per game. However, their defense remains a concern, allowing opponents to score 121.5 points on average.The Bucks enter the game dealing with injuries of their own but expect their MVP to be on the court. Giannis Antetokounmpo (left great toe sprain) – Probable and expected to play• Kevin Porter Jr. (ankle sprain) – Out• Kyle Kuzma (ankle sprain) – Doubtful• Cole Anthony (non-COVID illness) – QuestionableMilwaukee remains one of the league’s most potent offenses, averaging an impressive 127.5 points per game. Giannis continues to dominate on both ends, recently notching a 31-point, 20-rebound performance against the Toronto Raptors. Even with some players sidelined, the Bucks’ offensive depth and transition game keep them a constant threat.With Donovan Mitchell in top form, the Cleveland Cavaliers are expected to capitalize on Milwaukee’s weakened backcourt depth. His ability to create shots under pressure and control the game’s tempo could be the key to Cleveland’s success. The absence of Garland means Mitchell will shoulder much of the offensive initiation once again, likely attacking early to exploit mismatches.On the other end, Giannis will look to apply his trademark pressure inside the paint, forcing the Cavaliers’ big men - Allen and Mobley - into constant defensive adjustments. This dynamic could set the stage for a high-scoring, fast-paced contest between two of the Eastern Conference’s elite stars.Cleveland Cavaliers fans have reason to be optimistic: Donovan Mitchell is fully active and ready to play. After back-to-back 30-plus point performances, he has shown no lingering effects from the minor cramping issue he experienced in the season opener. Cleveland will rely heavily on his offensive spark to keep pace with Milwaukee’s relentless attack.Also read: Milwaukee Bucks vs Cleveland Cavaliers regular season game injury report: Who's playing, who's out, and more (October 26, 2025) With the Bucks entering the game undefeated at 2–0 and the Cavaliers sitting at 1–1, tonight’s clash promises intensity, star power, and early-season excitement as both teams look to make a statement in the East.","Cleveland cavaliers take on milwaukee bucks on october 26, 2025, at rocket arena.

Joe Milton takes over as Dak Prescott rests late in blowout loss



Prescott’s struggles and Cowboys’ next steps after Denver defeat



The Dallas Cowboys’ Week 8 matchup against the Denver Broncos didn’t end the way fans expected. As the game wound down, starting quarterback Dak Prescott was nowhere to be seen on the field. Instead, Joe Milton III stepped in, making his regular-season debut under center. The change sparked plenty of curiosity—but not controversy—as Dallas aimed to protect its starter in a tough loss.Dak Prescott wasn’t injured or benched out of frustration. The Cowboys simply decided to pull him with about seven minutes left in the game, trailing 44-17. Head coach Brian Schottenheimer made the call to protect his quarterback from further hits against Denver’s aggressive defense. Prescott had been under heavy pressure all afternoon, completing 19 of 31 passes for 188 yards with no touchdowns and two interceptions.In contrast, Joe Milton brought a spark in limited action. The rookie, who joined Dallas in the offseason via a trade from the New England Patriots, replaced Cooper Rush as the team’s backup quarterback. On his first drive, Milton showed off his trademark arm strength, delivering a perfect 35-yard touchdown strike to Jalen Tolbert. It was a small glimpse of what the young quarterback can offer. Milton finished the day completing three of four passes for 58 yards and a touchdown, even leading one more drive before the clock ran out.“There has never been a question about Milton’s arm strength,” analysts have said. “If he ever starts, his consistency will be more in question.” But on Sunday, Milton certainly made an impression.The loss dropped Dallas to 3-4-1 on the season, while Denver improved to 6-2, remaining perfect at home. Broncos quarterback Bo Nix outshined Prescott, going 19-for-29 for 247 yards and four touchdowns. Despite Prescott’s efforts to connect with receivers George Pickens and CeeDee Lamb—who combined for 14 receptions—Dallas couldn’t find the end zone through the air.Looking ahead, the Cowboys will host the Arizona Cardinals next week at AT&T Stadium. For Dallas to bounce back, Prescott must find better rhythm, and the offensive line has to do a stronger job of keeping him upright. The Cowboys still believe in their playoff chances, but it’s clear Prescott and company have some serious regrouping to do before then.Also Read: Jake Ferguson’s fiancée Haley Cavinder delights fans with perfect touchdown celebration reenactments for National Tight End Day","Dak prescott wasn't injured or benched out of frustration.

First-year head coach Kellen Moore benched struggling quarterback Spencer Rattler for Tyler Shough, but the offensive woes persisted. Despite a strong defensive effort, the offense failed to capitalize on opportunities, leaving the Saints' season in jeopardy.

Spencer Rattler ’s rocky outing pushes Moore to a long-awaited decision

Tyler Shough enters to cheers, but execution still falters



The New Orleans Saints stepped into Week 8 hoping for relief, redemption, or at least a first down without the chorus of boos. Instead, the Caesars Superdome crowd watched a season already wobbling on thin legs nearly collapse. Spencer Rattler’s early struggles pushed first-year head coach Kellen Moore to make a move many fans had been begging for: a quarterback change. But even that couldn’t save a 23-3 defeat to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers that dropped New Orleans to 1-7.After backing the former Oklahoma and South Carolina standout through weeks of inconsistency and turnovers, Moore finally reached his breaking point. Roughly 15 minutes before the switch, fans roared their disapproval as the offense trudged off the field empty-handed once again.That frustration only intensified after Rattler fumbled on the opening drive and later threw a costly pick-six inside his own 10-yard line, as Buccaneers linebacker Anthony Nelson snatched the ball “to the house for an easy score.”Though Rattler completed 15 of 21 passes for 136 yards, the efficiency was cosmetic. The Saints crossed midfield four times with him under center and scored just once. A penalty-filled, time-wasting three-and-out early in the second half sealed his fate.When Louisville product Tyler Shough’s face flashed on the video board, fans finally had a reason to raise their voices. It was the loudest the Dome had sounded all afternoon. Yet hope soon gave way to a familiar reality. Shough finished 17-of-30 for 128 yards with an interception that slipped through Chris Olave’s grasp. The offense still couldn’t finish drives, still couldn’t capitalize on opportunities, and still couldn’t match even a modest Tampa Bay attack led by Baker Mayfield.The Saints defense deserved a different ending. Chase Young and company delivered four straight goal-line stops, three sacks on Mayfield, and a forced fumble inside Tampa territory. They gave the team life; the offense simply refused to accept it.As New Orleans looks ahead to the Los Angeles Rams, Moore now faces a defining choice. If he sticks with Shough, fans will see whether change can finally bring a spark. Because this season, now teetering dangerously, is rapidly running out of second chances.Also Read: Bo Nix at the center of Denver’s trade strategy as Denver Broncos hunt for proven receivers","New orleans saints coach kellen moore benched quarterback spencer rattler for tyler shough.
