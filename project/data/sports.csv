Ruturaj Gaikwad press conference: Reveals Gautam Gambhir message, No.4 and more

Poll Do you believe Kohli can maintain this form for the upcoming matches? Yes, he can No, it's temporary I'm not sure

NEW DELHI: Virat Kohli hasn’t just returned to form — he has set off a nationwide frenzy strong enough to sell out an entire stadium. Back-to-back centuries in Ranchi and Raipur have turned what was shaping up to be a low-interest ODI in Visakhapatnam into the hottest cricket ticket in India this week. According to officials at the Andhra Cricket Association (ACA), Kohli’s stunning run-scoring spree single-handedly reversed sluggish online bookings for the third ODI against South Africa at the Dr. Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy ACA-VDCA Stadium.When tickets first went on sale digitally on November 28, the association braced for a disappointing turnout. The lack of buzz even pushed the ACA towards the rare option of setting up offline ticket counters despite committing to a fully digital system this time. But everything changed the moment Kohli unfurled a spectacular century in Ranchi on November 30. Suddenly, Phase 2 and 3 of ticket sales disappeared in minutes.“The first phase response wasn’t good,” confirmed Y. Venkatesh from ACA’s Media and Operations department to The Indian Express. “After Kohli’s hundred at Ranchi, the second and third phases vanished in minutes. Nothing was left unsold.”It wasn’t just victory that fans chased — it was the chance to witness a phenomenon.Kohli’s numbers in Vizag fuelled the madness: an average of 97.83 in seven ODIs, featuring three centuries and a 99. Even ticket prices ranging from Rs 1,200 to Rs 18,000 couldn’t slow demand.The frenzy spilled into real life, too. Hours before Team India landed in Vizag, hundreds gathered at the airport, waiting through repeated flight delays from Raipur. Security guards were bombarded with one question in multiple languages: “When are they landing?” The answer mattered because Kohli was on board.After his 53rd ODI century in Raipur, cricket legends poured in praise. But the loudest came from Mohammad Kaif, who summed up a nation’s emotion in eight simple words: “Without Kohli cricket is nothing… pure vintage!”","Back-to-back centuries in ranchi and raipur have turned what was shaping up to be a low-interest odi in visakhapatnam into the hottest cricket ticket in india this week.

Gautam Gambhir Press Conference: Team India head coach heaves fire after 2-1 ODI series win over SA

India's head coach Gautam Gambhir has strongly dismissed social media discussions about split coaching during a Saturday press conference. He expressed surprise at these theories and advised commentators to maintain their boundaries.The debate emerged following India's recent 0-2 Test series loss to South Africa. Several cricket personalities, including an IPL team owner, suggested to BCCI about having separate coaches for red-ball and white-ball formats.""Look, there were a lot of talks because the results didn't go in our favour. But the most surprising thing is that not once did any media or journalist wrote that our first Test match was played without the captain, who didn't bat in both innings,"" Gambhir said during the post-match press meet after India clinched the ODI series against SA 2-1.Gambhir emphasised that certain individuals were making comments unrelated to on-field cricket matters.""Some people also said things that have nothing to do with cricket. An IPL team owner also wrote about split coaching. So this is surprising. It's very important for people to stay in their domain. Because if we don't go into someone's domain, then they also don't have the right to come into our domain,"" Gambhir added.During the post-match conference in Guwahati, Gambhir addressed his achievements as the red-ball coach following the home series defeat.""I don't give excuses in press conferences. It doesn't mean that you don't show the facts in front of the world or the country. When you go through a transition and when you lose your captain, who is also your main batter in red-ball cricket against such a team.""""Then obviously the results are difficult because you don't have that much experience in red ball cricket. And the surprising thing is that no one even talked about it. All the discussions about wickets, I don't know what all things were said,"" he noted.He highlighted that captain Shubman Gill's absence due to a neck injury during both innings of the first Test in Kolkata was largely overlooked in media discussions.","India's head coach gautam gambhir has strongly dismissed social media discussions about split coaching.

NEW DELHI: Virat Kohli has been in exceptional form, scoring 376 runs in his last four ODIs with two centuries and being dismissed only twice. After winning the Player of the Series award for his 302 runs in the three-match series against South Africa, Kohli said he felt liberated and in his best rhythm in years, contributing to India securing their 10th ODI series win out of the last 11 at home.His resurgence follows criticism after recording consecutive ducks in Australia. In the final ODI against South Africa, Kohli scored an unbeaten 65 off 45 balls as India chased down 271 in 39.5 overs.""Honestly, playing the way I have in the series is the most satisfying thing for me. I feel really free in my mind. I haven't played like this in 2-3 years. The whole game is coming together nicely. I've tried to maintain my own standards and make an impact. I know when I can bat like that in the middle, it helps the team a long way. Makes me confident, any situation in the middle, I can handle that and bring it in favour of the team,"" Kohli said.Reflecting on his long journey, the former India captain admitted there were moments of doubt.""When you play for that long - 15-16 years, you do doubt yourself. Especially as a batter when one mistake can get you out. It's a whole journey of self-improvement and personal growth along the way.It improves you as a person, and it improves your temperament as well. I'm just glad that I'm still able to contribute to the team,"" he shared.One standout feature of his recent form has been his six-hitting, with 12 sixes across the three matches and a strike rate above 100 in each outing.""When I play freely, I know I can hit sixes. There are always levels you can always unlock,"" Kohli said about his approach.Kohli, who holds the world record with 53 ODI centuries, rated his 135 in Ranchi as his best knock of the series.""The first one at Ranchi - because I hadn't played a game since Australia. Just how your energy is on the day, Ranchi is very special for me, and I'm very grateful for how these three games have gone,"" he said.Speaking about India stepping up in the deciding match, Kohli highlighted the team’s hunger in pressure moments.""It's always brought the best of us - that's what we want to play for. When it's 1-1, we want to do something special for the team. That's why we have played for the team for so long.

India had lost the toss 20 times in a row before today’s match, and luck finally swung back their way when KL Rahul walked out and won it. The last time India had won the toss in an ODI was during the CWC 2023 semi-final against New Zealand at Wankhede.After the toss, KL Rahul was seen exclaiming “yess” and making a fist pump.""We'll bowl,"" KL Rahul said.""We trained here last night and the feedback from the coaches was that there was dew, but it didn't come in as early as Ranchi and Raipur. We were obviously planning to bowl second, keeping our track record in mind. I don't think it's going to play such a big part like Raipur and Ranchi. But, we just want to change the total and see how we can bowl first.It looks like a good wicket. For me and from the leadership group, we're really happy with the way we played in the last two games. I know from the outside, 360 being chased down looks like a lot is going wrong. But considering the conditions and considering the way our teams are lined up, I think we did really well.There's a lot of positives to take and I'm really happy with the way we bowled and batted. The chat obviously has been to keep doing the same thing and stay consistent with what we're doing and stay consistent with that process. We know that the results will follow. Not many things that we're looking to change. Just trying to sharpen a couple of things in the field and the results will go our way,"" he added.""One change. Washington Sundar misses out and Tilak Varma comes in,"" the Indian skipper confirmed.On the other hand, South Africa captain Temba Bavuma made two changes to his side.Watch the video here ""We would have bowled first. A good start upfront will set it up for the middle order, we'll try and put a competitive score on the board and then hopefully defend it. It's been entertaining, hasn't it?

Today is another important one and like always, we'll do our best to make sure we're on the right side of the result,"" Bavuma said.""We've got two changes. Rickelton and Baartman come in.

Chiefs’ third-down woes exposed as Bolton calls for accountability

'Attack December & Earn It' - Chiefs vs. Texans Preview w/ Nick Bolton | Defending the Kingdom

The Kansas City Chiefs are discovering the hard way that even the league’s most explosive offenses can’t outrun a defensive leak that keeps widening by the week. As the playoff race tightens, linebacker Nick Bolton has stepped into a leadership role, fueled by urgency. The Chiefs are to have their Week 14 showdown with the surging Houston Texans.Bolton recently sat down with Mitch Holthus and Matt McMullen, using the moment to send a clear message to defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo. He warned that third-down failures are dragging the team out of contention. His push for immediate correction comes at a time when Kansas City’s postseason hopes have never looked more fragile in the Patrick Mahomes era.Bolton didn’t hold back when assessing the defense’s most pressing flaw. He said, “I think they (Texans) were seven for nine on third down. So we got to find a way to get that number down. We want around 30% or less,” emphasizing the need for coordinated rush-and-coverage execution and more disruptive early-down play.Kansas City’s Thanksgiving loss to the Dallas Cowboys painted the reality in brutal detail. The Cowboys converted 9 of 16 third downs, extending drives that bled momentum and exposed a defense struggling to finish.Meanwhile, the Chiefs managed only 5 of 13 third-down conversions, a stagger that undercut even Mahomes’ late-game magic.Bolton’s sense of urgency resonates because Houston thrives precisely where Kansas City falters. The Texans hit 6 of 13 third downs against the Colts and shut Indianapolis down to just 30%, a formula that fuels their four-game win streak and keeps them in striking distance of the AFC South lead.With 100 tackles in 12 games, Bolton has become the Chiefs’ most reliable defender, but he can’t fix the problem alone. Chris Jones’ uneven season, along with inconsistencies from Leo Chenal and Jaylen Watson, has stretched Spagnuolo’s unit thin at the worst possible time.At 37% playoff odds and trailing a dominant Denver squad, the Chiefs are entering must-win territory. Anything less than a defensive turnaround risks ending the Mahomes postseason streak and shattering the expectations of Chiefs Kingdom.Also read: Tyreek Hill reignites Super Bowl chemistry with Willie Gay Jr. after Chiefs snub LB for Nick Bolton deal","Kansas city chiefs linebacker nick bolton has stepped into a leadership role, fueled by urgency.

NHL Highlights | Blackhawks vs. Kings - December 4, 2025

Blackhawks’ team effort shines against Kings’ continued offensive struggles



Connor Bedard’s remarkable rise continued under the bright lights of Los Angeles, as the rookie phenom found the back of the net for the third straight game in the Chicago Blackhawks’ 2-1 win over the Kings on Thursday night. With Chicago striving to build consistency on the road, Bedard once again delivered the momentum-shifting play that set the tone early.His presence has transformed the Blackhawks’ offensive rhythm, and each outing seems to strengthen his claim as one of the NHL’s fastest-emerging stars. The 20-year-old is not just scoring, but he’s driving the pace, dictating chances, and elevating those around him, turning every shift into a threat for opposing defenses.Bedard opened the scoring at 6:17 of the second period, crashing the crease and sweeping home Tyler Bertuzzi’s centering pass just nine seconds into a power play. The goal extended his red-hot stretch to four goals and six points across his last three games. Over his past 19 outings, Bedard now has 32 points, a level of production that underscores his growing command of the NHL stage.Blackhawks coach Jeff Blashill didn’t shy away from acknowledging the significance of Bedard’s climb, emphasizing that this surge is more than a promising stretch.“I think he’s obviously taken that big, big step this year to that next level,” Blashill said. “This isn’t a good start to me. It is kind of what he is. We see it on a nightly basis. He does it different ways, gets opportunities different ways, and sets up a lot of guys too. ”Wyatt Kaiser added Chicago’s second goal, while rookie forward Frank Nazar chipped in two assists in another strong supporting effort. Spencer Knight delivered a composed performance in net, making 26 saves, including crucial stops during a tense final stretch when the Kings pushed with a 6-on-4 advantage after Bedard was called for hooking.For Los Angeles, Trevor Moore scored the lone goal and Darcy Kuemper stood tall with 34 saves, but the offensive issues persisted. The Kings have now scored two or fewer goals in six of their past eight contests, a slump that forward Warren Foegele admitted has weighed on the group.The teams will meet again on Saturday in Los Angeles, giving the Kings a quick chance to respond and giving Bedard another opportunity to extend a streak that’s rapidly shaping his rookie campaign into something special.Also Read: Capitals’ Alex Ovechkin and Ryan Leonard makes NHL history with age-defying multi-goal performance","Chicago blackhawks beat los angeles kings 2-1 on thursday night.

Joseph Woll’s injury's impact on Maple Leafs at Hurricanes game



The Toronto Maple Leafs faced another difficult night as goaltender Joseph Woll exited their NHL match today against the Carolina Hurricanes after two periods due to a lower-body injury. The timing could not be worse for the team, especially considering their struggles in the NHL standings and the ongoing pressure to regain stability in the Atlantic Division.Woll’s departure came without much warning, and head coach Craig Berube offered no detailed update postgame. By stating only that the team is still evaluating the extent of the injury. Fans are worried because of this lack of clarity. Especially given Woll’s importance in recent games. Also, in his role in keeping the Maple Leafs competitive. Despite defensive inconsistencies.Backup goaltender Dennis Hildeby was thrust into action for the third period, stepping in admirably to help secure a hard-fought performance against the Hurricanes. While Hildeby managed the situation well, the reality remains that the Maple Leafs are now without both Joseph Woll and Anthony Stolarz, who has already been sidelined due to injury.With two key netminders out, Toronto’s depth will be tested heavily as they attempt to stay afloat.This situation also raises questions about potential NHL trade rumors. As the Maple Leafs may be forced to explore emergency backup options or short-term moves. All depending on how long Woll and Stolarz remain unavailable.The injury concerns overshadow what was otherwise an important outing for the Maple Leafs, who continue searching for consistency. With their goaltending core depleted, every upcoming NHL match preview will revolve around who gets the nod in net and whether the team can remain competitive under the circumstances.For now, Toronto can only hope that Woll’s injury is not long-term; because without him and Stolarz, the road ahead becomes significantly more challenging.Also Read: NHL Update: Brad Marchand and his family hosts Thanksgiving to comfort teammates missing home","Goaltender joseph woll left the game after two periods due to a lower-body injury.

Connor McDavid talks Oilers’ offensive bounce-back against Kraken





POST-RAW | Connor McDavid 12.04.25

Edmonton Oilers’ star Connor McDavid expressed relief and optimism after the team displayed a potent offensive performance against the Seattle Kraken, scoring nine goals in a dominant display. After a challenging start to the season, this game offered a glimpse of the scoring rhythm that helped the Oilers reach back-to-back Western Conference finals. McDavid’s comments highlight both individual and team confidence returning at a crucial stage of the campaign.The Oilers improved to a 12-11-5 record with the victory, sitting just outside the Western Conference wild card playoff spots. For a team that has struggled to consistently replicate its playoff form, Thursday’s win provides a much-needed morale boost and underscores the offensive potential McDavid has consistently delivered throughout his career.During his media session, McDavid acknowledged the team’s offensive struggles this season but praised the collective performance against the Kraken. “Yeah, I feel like we haven’t really had that all year,” he said. “Feels good to get a couple as a group, and hopefully guys are feeling good about themselves and we can build on it.”Edmonton’s ability to score in bunches was on full display, with McDavid himself noting the uniqueness of the performance.He compared the moment to his first career hat trick in Dallas, emphasizing both the excitement and rarity of such an offensive surge. “You guys might think I’m crazy, but the only one I can remember like that would have been my first hattrick goal in Dallas. Definitely a unique one,” McDavid explained.Consistency will be key for the Oilers as they aim to climb the standings and secure a playoff berth. With McDavid leading the charge, Edmonton has the offensive firepower to challenge any Western Conference team. Analysts and fans alike will be watching closely to see if the Oilers can sustain this momentum and return to the form that made them one of the league’s top contenders in recent seasons.Thursday’s 9-goal performance not only boosts confidence but also sends a message to opponents that when the Oilers’ offense is clicking, they remain a formidable force. For Edmonton, the focus now shifts to maintaining this level of play as the season progresses, with Connor McDavid at the center of their scoring efforts.Also Read: Connor Bedard extends goal streak as Blackhawks secure 2-1 win over Kings: Coach Jeff Blashill praises rookie’s “big step” forward","Edmonton oilers scored nine goals against the seattle kraken on thursday.

Pete Alonso and Kyle Schwarber seen as Boston’s strongest chance to upgrade the offense

Pete Alonso and Kyle Schwarber are now the two main power hitters the Boston Red Sox are looking at for this offseason. This comes after the Red Sox were knocked out by the New York Yankees in the postseason last month in New York. The team wants strong bats, and these two names are seen as the best way to fix the middle of the order, according to The Athletic reporter Jen McCaffrey, who wrote this in a detailed report published in late November 2025.Boston already added Sonny Gray and Johan Oviedo to help the pitching staff, but the club still needs a hitter who can bring steady power every day. The Red Sox lost Rafael Devers before last season in a trade, and Alex Bregman chose free agency this month. Because of that, the front office believes a strong hitter in the heart of the lineup is now the top need.Jen McCaffrey wrote that Pete Alonso and Kyle Schwarber “represent the best opportunity to upgrade the offense,” and the Red Sox front office agrees with that view.Alonso, who played first base for the New York Mets last season, is known for long home runs and steady run production.He becomes one of the top power bats on the market this winter.Published during the last week of November 2025, just before the start of the winter meetings, the report was made public.Having played for the Philadelphia Phillies in 2025, Kyle Schwarber hit 56 home runs last year. He is free to sign a long-term contract having earlier this month rejected the Phillies' qualifying offer in Philadelphia.Many MLB insiders predict he will sign a roughly five-year, $145 million deal.Having played in Boston in years past as well, Schwarber knows Fenway Park and how hitters adapt to the wall in left field.At the GM meetings this month, Red Sox chief baseball officer Craig Breslow told journalists and verified that the team is striving for a potent middle-order bat.Breslow said, “Someone who is a threat who can hit in the middle of the order and can lengthen our lineup is something we want to pursue.”His comments came during his on-record session with reporters, held at the annual meetings in Arizona earlier this month.These moves matter because Boston needs instant power. Both Alonso and Schwarber can change a game with one swing.If the Red Sox land even one of them, the lineup becomes much harder to pitch to, especially in tight games or late innings.Also Read: MLB Trade Rumors: Toronto Blue Jays Eying Kyle Tucker This Week As Pete Alonso Becomes A Key Red Sox Move","Mlb insider points red sox toward pete alonso and kyle schwarber as game-changing power targets.

Jayden Daniels ’ QB status remains key focus for Commanders ahead of Week 14 against Vikings



The Washington Commanders have faced a challenging 2025 season, struggling with injuries and inconsistent play as they sit at 3-9. Last week, backup quarterback Marcus Mariota stepped in during a narrow 27-26 overtime loss to the Denver Broncos, delivering a solid performance against a top-tier defense. Despite Mariota’s efforts, the team’s offense has lacked stability and consistent leadership throughout the season.Washington’s quarterback situation has been a key storyline, with injuries impacting performance and game planning. The team has struggled to maintain consistency and rhythm without a healthy starter under center. Jayden Daniels ’ health is critical for the Commanders’ offensive cohesion and execution moving forward.Commanders head coach Dan Quinn confirmed that Jayden Daniels will start Sunday’s Week 14 matchup against the Minnesota Vikings, according to NFL insider Adam Schefter. Daniels had been sidelined due to an elbow injury suffered in Week 9 against the Seattle Seahawks and also missed games earlier in the season after a tough Week 2 loss to the Green Bay Packers. His return marks a key moment for Washington as the team looks to regain stability at the quarterback position.Daniels returned briefly on October 5 in a 27-10 win over the Los Angeles Chargers, but recurring injuries have limited his playing time this season. His return is expected to strengthen Washington’s passing attack and improve communication with the offensive line and receivers. His presence under center is expected to bring stability to Washington’s offense, improving timing, reads, and overall execution in the passing game.Despite the team’s 3-9 record, Daniels’ leadership and ability to manage high-pressure situations remain crucial to the Commanders’ offensive strategy. Maintaining a healthy and consistent presence at quarterback will be crucial for the team’s offensive development and game planning. Reestablishing a consistent quarterback presence is critical as Washington looks to optimize its offensive efficiency in the final stretch of the season.Sunday’s matchup against the Minnesota Vikings provides Daniels an opportunity to reassert himself as the team’s primary quarterback and lead the Commanders’ offense effectively through the remaining games of the 2025 season.Also Read: Omarion Hampton injury update: NFL insider Matt Zenitz shares key insight on Chargers RB for Week 14",Washington commanders head coach dan quinn confirmed that jayden daniels will start sunday’s week 14 matchup against the minnesota vikings.
