Projected lineup against the San Antonio Spurs

Can the Cleveland Cavaliers sustain their dominance?

Thecontinue their dominant season with the league‚Äôs fewest losses, but injuries to key players could disrupt their momentum. Whileis back for tonight‚Äôs game against the San Antonio Spurs, four other players remain sidelined or questionable. Donovan Mitchell missed the Cavs‚Äô previous game against the Portland Trail Blazers due to a groin injury, but the team secured a comfortable win without him. Fortunately for Cleveland, their star guard has been removed from the injury report and will be available against the Spurs. His return provides a major boost as the Cavs aim to solidify their top seed in the Eastern Conference.The Cleveland Cavaliers will be without forward Evan Mobley, as head coach Kenny Atkinson has opted to rest him. Meanwhile, rookie Jaylon Tyson is also out with a bone bruise in his left knee, marking his fifth consecutive missed game. His absence could extend to Friday‚Äôs matchup against the Detroit Pistons, depending on his recovery progress.Backup guard Ty Jerome is a game-time decision due to left knee soreness. His availability will be determined closer to tip-off, leaving Atkinson to adjust rotations if needed. Additionally, G-League players Bates Emoni, Nae‚ÄôQwan Tomlin, and Luke Travers are all out as they fulfill assignments with the Charge, Cleveland‚Äôs affiliate team.With the top seed nearly secured, the Cleveland Cavaliers can afford to manage minutes carefully. However, Atkinson is unlikely to rest too many starters against a Spurs team that, despite missing De‚ÄôAaron Fox and Victor Wembanyama , remains competitive. Here‚Äôs the expected rotation:- PG: Darius Garland | Donovan Mitchell | Craig Porter Jr.- SG: Donovan Mitchell | Sam Merrill | Max Strus- SF: Max Strus | De‚ÄôAndre Hunter | Issac Okoro- PF: Dean Wade | De‚ÄôAndre Hunter | Javonte Green- C: Jarrett Allen | Tristan Thompson | Dean WadeAfter a brief four-game skid earlier this month, Cleveland has rebounded with strong performances against the Jazz and Trail Blazers.

The Kansas City Chiefs have Travis Kelce back for the 2025-26 season, but his days as the team's top tight end might be numbered.Kelce returns to the Chiefs at age 35, clearly past his prime years. He's a franchise legend, racking up 12,151 receiving yards over 174 regular season games. But his numbers have steadily declined since 2022, the last season he crossed 1,000 receiving yards.Last season, Kelce caught 97 passes on 133 targets, but managed just three touchdowns‚Äîhis career-low. It's reassuring to see Kelce on the field again, but the Chiefs should strongly consider increasing Noah Gray 's snaps.Noah Gray, drafted in the fifth round by the Chiefs in 2021, keeps improving. Last season was Gray's best yet, posting career-highs with 437 receiving yards and five touchdowns from 40 catches on 49 targets.At age 26, Gray is entering his prime years. Keeping him limited behind a declining Kelce could be a serious mistake. Kansas City recognized Gray‚Äôs potential with a contract extension, clearly seeing his value beyond a typical fifth-round pick.Pro Football Focus graded Gray at 74.2 last season, placing him eighth among all tight ends. Kelce's grade was 70.9, ranking him 15th. Gray objectively outperformed Kelce, suggesting it's time for Kansas City to prioritize youth over legacy.Taylor Swift dominated the recent iHeartRadio Music Awards , earning nine awards, including Artist of the Year, Pop Artist of the Year, and a special honor for her global ""Eras Tour,"" plus six fan-voted categories.Though Swift missed the event at the Dolby Theater in LA, she sent a recorded acceptance speech.

Alex Anzalone‚Äôs defensive impact: A key piece in Detroit‚Äôs success



Alex Anzalone - 2022 Season Highlights [Detroit Lions LB] üêäüî®

Alex Anzalone's contract dilemma: Will Lions re-sign their defensive leader?



Few players embody the heart and hustle of the Detroit Lions quite like Alex Anzalone . A relentless competitor and vocal leader, he has cemented himself as a cornerstone of the team‚Äôs defense. As Detroit aims for a Super Bowl run, Anzalone‚Äôs leadership and playmaking ability remain vital. But with his contract nearing its end, will the Lions extend their defensive anchor?The 2024 season was shaping up to be another strong campaign for Anzalone until a broken forearm sidelined him for several games. His absence was immediately felt, as the Lions‚Äô defense struggled to maintain the same level of intensity without him. However, when he made his return before the postseason, it became crystal clear just how essential he is to Detroit‚Äôs defensive success.One stat that highlights his impact is his dominance in man coverage. According to Pride of Detroit‚Äôs Al Karsten, Anzalone led all linebackers (minimum 150 snaps) in man coverage snaps last season. The veteran linebacker himself acknowledged this rare skill set, boldly stating on X, ""No other LB asked to do what I do.""Pro Football Focus further supports his case, grading Anzalone with a 73.7 in coverage, ranking him 17th out of 189 linebackers. His ability to lock down opposing players in coverage is a rare asset at his position, making him one of the most versatile defenders on the team.As Anzalone enters the final year of his three-year, $18 million deal, Detroit faces a tough decision. At 30 years old, he‚Äôs still playing at a high level, but the Lions must weigh the financial implications of keeping him long-term. With rising stars like Aidan Hutchinson due for massive extensions and the team looking to manage cap space efficiently, Anzalone‚Äôs future in Detroit is uncertain.The ideal scenario for the Lions would be finding a way to retain their defensive leader while balancing their financial commitments. If they decide to part ways, Anzalone won‚Äôt be short on suitors. His ability to cover, lead, and adapt to various defensive schemes makes him a valuable asset for any contender looking to bolster their linebacker corps.Also Read: Could Donald Trump own an NFL team?

A story beyond the ice: Themes of resilience, friendship, and dreams

Animation that brings the ice to life with breathtaking visuals

A magical twist: Spirit guardians, folklore, and the soul of the game

Studio Ghibli , known for its breathtaking animation and deeply emotional storytelling, has never tackled hockey‚Äîbut imagine if they did. A Hayao Miyazaki-directed NHL film would be more than just a sports movie; it would be a poetic journey blending the raw intensity of the game with the beauty of nature, the depth of human emotion, and a touch of whimsical magic.Hayao Miyazaki‚Äôs films are never just about their settings; they are about the characters' inner worlds. His NHL movie wouldn‚Äôt focus solely on winning championships but on the spirit of the game. It might follow a young, underdog player struggling with self-doubt, mirroring themes from Kiki‚Äôs Delivery Service or Spirited Away. Perhaps an aging veteran, reminiscent of Porco Rosso, battles past failures while guiding a new generation.Expect themes of resilience, friendship, and dreams‚Äîwhere hockey isn‚Äôt just a game, but a path to personal growth. ""The world isn't simple enough to explain in words,"" Miyazaki once said. His hockey film would likely capture the deeper struggles players face, on and off the ice.Studio Ghibli‚Äôs animation would make every moment on the rink a work of art. The way Miyazaki animates flying‚Äîfluid, free, and exhilarating‚Äîsuggests his depiction of skating would be mesmerizing. Imagine crisp ice shimmering under arena lights, trails of frost curling behind players‚Äô skates, and snowflakes dancing through the air in slow-motion sequences.Nature would play a key role, as it does in all Ghibli films. Perhaps the changing seasons symbolize the players' growth, with autumn leaves falling as training begins and cherry blossoms drifting in the wind when a crucial game arrives.Would Miyazaki‚Äôs NHL movie include supernatural elements? Almost certainly. Maybe the rink is haunted by benevolent spirits who guide players in moments of doubt, much like My Neighbor Totoro‚Äôs forest guardians. A legendary hockey stick imbued with the spirit of past champions could be a central motif, whispering lessons from the past.No Ghibli film is complete without Joe Hisaishi‚Äôs music. His sweeping orchestral pieces would transform every goal, every moment of struggle, into something deeply emotional. Picture a quiet piano melody accompanying a lone skater practicing at dawn, then swelling into a triumphant symphony as the team scores a game-winning goal.Also Read: Former NHL goaltender Wade Flaherty reflects on being the last goalie to be scored on by Wayne Gretzky A Studio Ghibli NHL movie wouldn‚Äôt just be about hockey‚Äîit would be about life, perseverance, and the beauty of human connection.

Bruce Boudreau isn‚Äôt here for Sheldon Keefe‚Äôs blunt style. After Keefe publicly criticized New Jersey Devils defenseman Jonathan Kovacevic, Boudreau called him out directly. Kovacevic was urging a playoff mindset from his team‚Äîfair point‚Äîbut Keefe just wasn‚Äôt feeling it.Following the Devils' 3-2 loss to the Ottawa Senators, Kovacevic stressed the importance of making Prudential Center a challenging arena for opponents down the stretch.

But usually, Keefe walked those statements back the next day. Boudreau doubts that‚Äôll happen this time around.Boudreau added.Keefe‚Äôs frustration is understandable‚Äîthe Devils are inconsistent lately, 4-6-1 in their last 11 games. But Boudreau‚Äôs got a point: publicly putting your own player on blast probably isn‚Äôt the move.Jonathan Kovacevic isn‚Äôt sulking. Days after Keefe‚Äôs blunt criticism, Kovacevic delivered a key defensive play during Monday‚Äôs matchup against the Vancouver Canucks at Prudential Center. That response matters‚Äîespecially considering Kovacevic recently inked a five-year, $20 million extension with the Devils. He's put up 17 points (1 goal, 16 assists) through 71 games this season.The Devils still sit third in the Metropolitan Division with 81 points, playoff-bound but shaky.

Are Kelce brother becoming bigger than the NFL? The rise of New Heights and the Kelce Brand



How The Kelce Brothers Became Social Media Superstars | Athlete Influencers & Brand Lessons

The Kelce brothers, Travis and Jason, have become two of the most recognizable names in football‚Äînot just for their on-field dominance but for their growing influence beyond the sport. While Travis continues to shine as one of the NFL‚Äôs top tight ends for the Kansas City Chiefs , Jason‚Äôs legacy as a former Philadelphia Eagles center remains deeply respected. However, their transition from football stars to media personalities has been nothing short of remarkable. With their hit podcast New Heights, commercial deals, and cultural relevance extending into mainstream entertainment, a question arises‚Äîare the Kelce brothers becoming bigger than the NFL itself?One of the key reasons behind the Kelce brothers‚Äô media success is their widely popular podcast, New Heights. Launched in 2022, the show quickly gained traction, giving fans an unfiltered look into the lives of two of the league‚Äôs most charismatic players. Their chemistry, humor, and candid storytelling have set them apart from other sports-focused podcasts. Unlike traditional NFL coverage, New Heights provides an insider‚Äôs perspective with a mix of personal anecdotes, football insights, and lighthearted banter.The podcast‚Äôs rapid rise has also been fueled by major NFL storylines involving the brothers themselves. From their historic Super Bowl LVII matchup‚Äîwhere they became the first brothers to play against each other in a Super Bowl‚Äîto Travis Kelce ‚Äôs high-profile relationship with pop superstar Taylor Swift, their personal and professional lives have kept fans engaged. These factors have helped New Heights dominate digital platforms, frequently topping podcast charts and racking up millions of views on YouTube.Beyond the podcast, both Travis and Jason have expanded their brand in different ways. Travis, with his magnetic personality, has secured major endorsement deals, made guest appearances on Saturday Night Live, and even ventured into music festivals and entertainment circles. Jason, on the other hand, has leveraged his leadership reputation into storytelling, charitable efforts, and a strong presence in Philadelphia‚Äôs local culture. These ventures have allowed them to transcend football and tap into a broader audience.While the Kelce brothers remain closely tied to the NFL, their media success is beginning to take on a life of its own. The NFL thrives on its star power, but few players in recent history have managed to create a platform as impactful as what Travis and Jason have built. Their appeal now stretches far beyond football, reaching audiences who might not even follow the sport.Travis Kelce‚Äôs involvement with Taylor Swift has only accelerated his cultural status. With Swift‚Äôs massive fan base‚Äîmany of whom had little prior interest in the NFL‚Äîhis presence has contributed to increased viewership and heightened media coverage. His commercials, red-carpet appearances, and off-field activities have positioned him as a crossover star, similar to how figures like Peyton Manning and Tom Brady transitioned into entertainment post-retirement.Jason Kelce , meanwhile, is carving his own path in the media world. Since retiring from football in early 2024, he has already become one of the most sought-after voices in sports media. Whether it‚Äôs analyzing games, delivering heartfelt speeches, or engaging in off-field projects, his ability to connect with fans has made him a respected public figure. Given his storytelling skills and natural charisma, a long-term career in broadcasting or entertainment seems inevitable.While the Kelce brothers‚Äô media empire is undeniably growing, it would be a stretch to say they are ""bigger"" than the NFL itself. The league remains a global powerhouse with a brand value that far surpasses any individual players. However, what Travis and Jason have accomplished is rare‚Äîthey have created personal brands that hold weight both within and outside of football.Their ability to shape narratives, entertain audiences, and stay relevant even beyond the game is what sets them apart. With their influence continuing to expand, they could very well be among the first modern NFL stars to redefine what a post-football career looks like. Whether it‚Äôs through media, entertainment, or business ventures, the Kelce brothers have positioned themselves as long-term cultural figures, ensuring their legacy will extend far beyond their playing days.Also Read: Jason Kelce opens up about his ‚Äòembarrassing‚Äô weight loss struggle after stepping away from football Travis and Jason Kelce are no longer just elite athletes‚Äîthey are media moguls, entertainers, and cultural influencers. Their podcast New Heights, combined with their individual ventures, has elevated them to a status that few NFL players ever achieve. While they may not be ""bigger"" than the NFL, they have certainly expanded their reach beyond the sport in a way that is rare for football players. As they continue to grow their media presence, the Kelce brothers are proving that their impact on sports and entertainment is just beginning.","The kelce brothers, travis and jason, have become two of the most recognizable names in football.

Jayson Tatum reacted to his nickname ‚ÄòThe Anomaly‚Äô while speaking with Travis Kelce and Jason Kelce



Where did Jayson Tatum‚Äôs nickname come from?



Boston Celtics star Jayson Tatum ‚Äôs reaction to a particular nickname has sparked plenty of discussion among fans and media alike. Tatum, who has been a star player for the Celtics, recently addressed the growing trend of people calling him ‚Äò The Anomaly ‚Äô during his chat with NFL star siblings Travis Kelce and Jason Kelce in a new episode a their New Heights podcast .During a guest appearance on the New Heights podcast hosted by NFL stars Travis and Jason Kelce, Jayson Tatum was asked about the nickname that has been making rounds on social media. Travis Kelce, referring to Tatum‚Äôs Wikipedia page, brought up the moniker and asked, ‚ÄúHas anybody that is close to you ever actually called you, ‚ÄòThe Anomaly‚Äô?‚ÄùTatum was amused. He responded with a candid answer that sent the Kelce brothers into fits of laughter. ‚ÄúTwitter is not a real place, I‚Äôll say that,‚Äù Tatum hared. His reaction made it clear that he wasn‚Äôt exactly embracing the nickname, despite its growing popularity.Jason Kelce, however, had a different take. ‚ÄúI would run with that one. I like it. ‚ÄòThe Anomaly‚Äô is a good one. I don‚Äôt know who came up with that.‚Äù To which Travis Kelce agreed, saying, ‚ÄúIt is a banger.‚ÄùThe origins of ‚ÄòThe Anomaly‚Äô trace back to social media, where an X user first suggested it, pointing out Tatum‚Äôs unique skill set. ‚ÄúHandles like someone 6 inches shorter, shoots pull-ups like a guard, finishes at the rim like a center, and consistently defends 1-5.‚ÄùThe nickname got wide attention, and soon, even official team accounts like the Portland Trail Blazers started using it in their game promotions. Basketball Reference has even added it to Tatum‚Äôs list of nicknames.Previously, when asked directly if he liked the name, he hesitated before admitting, ‚ÄúAhhh, I don‚Äôt know.‚Äù He went on to mention that friends and teammates call him by other names, such as ‚ÄòBig Deuce‚Äô and ‚ÄòTaco.‚ÄôAlso Read: Jayson Tatum's injury report (March 26, 2025): Is the Boston Celtics star fit to play against the Phoenix Suns tonight?

IPL 2025: How will KKR, MI, CSK, SRH, RCB fare this season?

After being outclassed in their previous matches, title holders Kolkata Knight Riders and Rajasthan Royals are looking for a quick turnaround when they meet in an IPL match today (March 26).The Knight Riders lost to Royal Challengers Bengaluru by seven wickets in their opener, while the Royals suffered a 44-run defeat against Sunrisers Hyderabad.Both teams share a common issue: their once-impressive batting and bowling units have failed to perform. While the Royals might attribute their bowling struggles to playing at a difficult Hyderabad venue, the Knight Riders lack such an excuse.Except for Sunil Narine, none of the KKR bowlers managed to restrain the aggressive RCB lineup, raising concerns about the effectiveness of mystery spinner Varun Chakravarthy, who struggled significantly. Even on Eden Gardens' pitch, which had some grip, Chakravarthy was hit hard by Phil Salt and Virat Kohli.The KKR camp is hopeful that Chakravarthy will regain his form on a Guwahati pitch that typically offers more assistance to bowlers.The Barsapara Cricket Stadium in Guwahati has hosted four matches in IPL history - two in 2023 and two in 2024. The highest total at this ground came courtesy Rajasthan Royals who scored 199 against Delhi Capitals.

Why the Los Angeles Lakers make sense

Theare expected to target a young, versatile big man in free agency this summer, and Brooklyn Nets ‚Äô backup centerhas emerged as a potential option.

His efficiency and athleticism make him an appealing target for a Los Angeles Lakers team that needs frontcourt depth behind Luka Doncic and LeBron James The Nets already have a significant investment in starting center Nicolas Claxton ($25.4 million next season), which may limit their willingness to match aggressive offers for Sharpe.As Eric Pincus of Bleacher Report noted,- Financial commitment to Claxton- Sharpe‚Äôs rising market value- Potential for a bigger role elsewhereDrafted 29th overall in 2021 out of North Carolina, Sharpe was a McDonald‚Äôs All-American at Montverde Academy, a program known for producing NBA talent like Cooper Flagg and Derik Queen. His development over four seasons with the Nets has showcased his potential as a reliable rotation player with room to grow.- Need for a young, athletic big to complement Davis- Cap flexibility to outbid Brooklyn- Opportunity for Sharpe to play a larger roleAlso read: NBA Offseason Rumors: Los Angeles Lakers could sign 7-foot-1 Boston Celtics star forward to bolster squad around Luka-LeBron duo With multiple teams expected to pursue Sharpe, the Los Angeles Lakers will need to act quickly in free agency.

Pune: Ritul Duhan's day starts at 5am as she and her fellow cadets assemble at the National Defence Academy 's squadron parade ground to recite the NDA prayer and honour code. Their day, which ends at 10.15pm and consists of physical training, academics and some games, is similar to that of any other NDA cadet.But the women, who are the first female cadets of the academy, feel a bigger sense of responsibility to pave the path for those who follow them in the military.""We are obliged and privileged to be a part of the historic moment of the academy. But at the same time, I feel it is a big responsibility for us. Being the first female cadets of the academy, juniors look up to us. They will follow our path. So it is a big privilege and a proud moment for us ,"" said Duhan, a BTech cadet of the final term.With her appointment as Battalion Cadet Captain, Duhan recognises the significant responsibility she carries. ""We are not just completing our training, we are paving the way for future leadership and inspiring younger cadets who will follow our path,"" she said at the ‚ÄòYugantar' event organised by Southern Command's Zonal Recruiting Office in Pune on Tuesday. About 3,000 aspiring students, including girls NCC cadets, attended the event.Duhan is a national-level basketball player and the daughter of a private contractor. Supported by her parents and driven by determination, she said the three-year NDA experience develops not just military skills, but also provides comprehensive personal growth.The first batch of 17 female cadets is set to pass out from the academy in the upcoming passing-out parade in May. After completing three years of training, these cadets will join the respective forces' academies to complete one year of advanced military training before being commissioned into their respective arms and services of the armed forces.Her resolute mindset that never entertained the thought of surrendering has helped her, she added. ""When challenges emerged, I always reminded myself of my initial motivation‚Ä¶ If 40,000 cadets before me could complete this training successfully, there was no reason I couldn't.""The academy's adaptation to integrate female cadets has been noteworthy, Duhan pointed out while acknowledging that there were some uncertainties initially. ""The atmosphere has become increasingly conducive,"" she said, and praised the NDA's progressive approach. ""I encourage girls to join with a broader purpose, understanding that this training develops every aspect of your personality.""Her advice to aspiring female cadets is pragmatic and encouraging: ""Any initial reservations will dissolve once you join. The NDA transforms you beyond your expectations, pushing your limits daily through a comprehensive programme of morning drills, academic lectures, sports, and multiple activities.""","The first batch of 17 female cadets is set to pass out from the academy in the upcoming passing-out parade in may.
