Joe Kelly steps away from baseball, says he’s done playing but won’t call it retirement

Joe Kelly has reportedly decided to step away from professional baseball. The veteran pitcher shared that he is done playing, but stopped short of calling it a formal retirement. His words were brief and honest, reflecting a decision that came without drama or ceremony.Beyond the stats and seasons, Kelly will always remembered by fans for that one face he made to the Houston Astros hitter, a memory that will remain vividly, even after his playing days.The three-time World Series champion said, “Retiring is like, something my grandmother did. I’m sorry all you people out there watching this that work a real job. You guys deserve to retire. It’s used for people who served in the military, it’s used for people who worked until 65.”The 37 year old veteran steps aside the mound with 839 career innings, a 3.98 ERA, three World Series rings. Kelly arrived in Los Angeles after helping the Boston Red Sox win against Dodgers. He is a third round pick by the Cardinals in 2009 and was successful in his three Fall Classic appearances posting 2.03 ERA with 19 strikeouts over 13.1 innings.He won rings with the Red Sox in 2018 and twice with the Dodgers in 2020 and 2024.Joe Kelly is married to Ashley Nicole Kelly whom he met at the University of California, Riverside (UCR). They tied the knot in November 2013. The couple has three sons and a daughter.Over the years Kelly has built a reputation as a competitor who thrived in high pressure moments. Teammates often spoke about his confidence, the personality that he carries on-field. Kelly’s career also reflected adaptability as he adjusted to different teams, and found ways to contribute even as his role evolved later in his career.Off the field, Kelly maintained a relatively private life, balancing baseball and responsibility with the family. The balance appeared to shape his decision to step away quietly, without framing it as a dramatic farewell.With his playing days are now behind him, his career will be remembered for its intensity, big moments, and a personality that stood out on the mound.","Joe kelly has announced his retirement from professional baseball.

Vancouver Canucks continue to struggle from disappointing season

The Seattle Kraken welcomed the Vancouver Canucks to Climate Pledge Arena on Monday night. The matchup marks the first meeting of the season between the two Pacific Division rivals. While the Kraken have been slowly rising up the standings looking for that wildcard spot, the Canucks are still adjusting from the trade of former captain Quinn Hughes.Seattle enters the contest riding a four-game winning streak that has vaulted them back into playoff contention. Vancouver arrives in the opposite direction after a disappointing start to the campaign has left them near the bottom of the division standings.Seattle sits at 16-14-6 with 38 points, positioning itself in the middle of a tight Pacific Division race. The Kraken have been particularly effective within the division, posting an impressive 8-4-0 record against Pacific opponents.However, the team still carries a negative scoring differential of -12 with 93 goals scored and 105 allowed through 36 games. Those numbers suggest that Seattle has been winning close contests during its recent surge, rather than dominating opponents.Over their last 10 games, the Kraken have gone 5-5-0 while averaging 2.7 goals per game. The team has averaged four penalties and nine penalty minutes while giving up just 2.2 goals per game during that stretch. The improved defensive play has been a key factor in their four-game winning streak.Jordan Eberle leads Seattle with 14 goals and 10 assists through 36 games. Chandler Stephenson has provided recent production with five goals and six assists over the past 10 contests, giving the Kraken secondary scoring behind their top line.While the Canucks wanted to show a different side to the fans this season, so far, the franchise has been unable to live up to its reputation. With a record of 15-19-3 and just 33 points, the franchise sits near the bottom of the Pacific Division, and its playoff hopes seem to have fizzled out.The team has been particularly ineffective within the division, posting a disappointing 3-4-1 record in Pacific matchups. That lack of success against divisional opponents has made climbing back into the playoff race extremely difficult.However, Vancouver has still gone just 5-5-0 during that span while averaging only 2.5 goals per game. The Canucks rank eighth in the NHL with 149 total penalties, averaging four per game. That undisciplined play has contributed to their struggles throughout the season.Both teams enter Monday's contest healthy with no injuries listed. Puck drop is scheduled for 10 p.m. EST at Climate Pledge Arena as Seattle looks to extend their winning streak to five games while Vancouver desperately needs points to keep their fading playoff hopes alive.",The seattle kraken welcome the vancouver canucks to climate pledge arena on monday night.

when the Milwaukee Bucks face the Charlotte Hornets on December 29, 2025. There is nothing on the injury report suggesting the Bucks plan to hold him out after his recent return from a calf strain.Milwaukee arrives in Charlotte looking steadier than it has in weeks. Antetokounmpo’s return has given the team its structure back on both ends of the floor, and this game offers another chance to stack wins after a rough stretch without him.The Milwaukee Bucks’ injury report lists Gary Trent Jr. and Taurean Prince, but Giannis Antetokounmpo is not included. Game previews and team notes consistently describe Milwaukee as playing with its star back in the lineup, which points clearly toward him being available for this matchup.Giannis Antetokounmpo injured his right calf on December 3 against the Detroit Pistons. The strain occurred on a non-contact play, and he exited the game early. Early timelines suggested he could miss two to four weeks. The team, led by head coach Doc Rivers, took a careful approach, mindful of the risks that come with calf injuries.After missing eight games, Antetokounmpo returned over the weekend and looked comfortable quickly.He scored 29 points in a 112–103 win over the Chicago Bulls and played with his usual pace and force. After the game, he said he felt some rust and discomfort, which he expected, but made it clear that being back on the court was the priority.With Antetokounmpo in the lineup, Milwaukee looks like a different team. During one stretch without him, the Bucks went 3–11 and struggled to score inside or control games defensively. His return stabilizes both areas.Charlotte is short-handed in the frontcourt, with Mason Plumlee, Ryan Kalkbrenner, and Grant Williams all out. That puts added pressure on the Hornets to deal with Antetokounmpo’s size and strength near the basket.For Milwaukee Bucks, Taurean Prince remains out with a neck issue. Gary Trent Jr. is dealing with a calf problem and has been listed around this period as questionable or a game-time decision. Charlotte Hornets’ injury list includes Kon Knueppel (ankle), Ryan Kalkbrenner (elbow), Mason Plumlee (groin), and Grant Williams (knee), leaving LaMelo Ball, Miles Bridges, and Brandon Miller to carry most of the load.Also read: Milwaukee Bucks vs Charlotte Hornets regular season game: Full injury report, who's out, where to watch and more (December 29, 2025) If Antetokounmpo plays as expected, the Bucks will have another clear chance to keep their season moving in the right direction.",Giannis antetokounmpo is expected to play for the milwaukee bucks against the charlotte hornets on monday night.

‘Not so much talking anymore’: Nick Sirianni’s off-camera tunnel unfiltered message after Eagles’ ugly win is pure Philadelphia,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/not-so-much-talking-anymore-nick-siriannis-off-camera-tunnel-unfiltered-message-after-eagles-ugly-win-is-pure-philadelphia/articleshow/126235044.cms,"Nick Sirianni was caught on camera with an unfiltered message after the Eagles survived Buffalo. Ugly win. Loud statement. (Image via Getty)

Nick Sirianni’s locker-room moment captured the Eagles’ road-tested identity

The Eagles won ugly, and Sirianni knows exactly why that still matters

The Philadelphia Eagles did not dominate the Buffalo Bills on the stat sheet Sunday. They still walked out of Highmark Stadium with a 13–12 win that mattered.As Eagles head coach Nick Sirianni headed toward the locker room, cameras caught him delivering a blunt off-camera message that quickly made the rounds. It was short. It was profane. And it reflected exactly how Philadelphia feels heading into January.“Not so much (talking) anymore! Love this s**.”*The comment came moments after the Eagles survived a late Buffalo push that ended with a failed game-winning two-point attempt. Philadelphia scored all 13 of its points in the first half, then leaned on its defense to close it out. The win moved the Eagles to 11–5 in 2025 and reinforced their control of the NFC East.Sirianni’s words were not part of his postgame press conference. They came in the tunnel, unfiltered, as his team walked off the field after quieting a crowd that expected a statement win from Buffalo.That context matters. Philadelphia entered the game having already clinched a playoff spot. Buffalo needed the win more. The Bills pushed late, cutting a 13–0 halftime deficit to one point in the fourth quarter. They never took the lead.The Eagles’ offense managed little after halftime, totaling just 16 yards over 18 second-half plays. That opened the door for criticism. Sirianni did not deny it later. In public, he shifted the focus to the result and the environment.“You got to give yourself points when you win football games,” Sirianni said. “There’s always things to clean up when you come out of a football game.”He emphasized the difficulty of winning on the road, especially in Buffalo.“But if you come out of a football game where you win on the road, again, in a hostile environment, man, they got really good fans. Against a really good football team that’s had the sustained success that we have.”Philadelphia’s offense stalled after halftime. That is not new in 2025. Jalen Hurts acknowledged the imperfections while crediting the defense for closing the game.“It’s a big-time win,” Hurts said. “A competitive game, hell of a performance by the defense and how they played and how they were able to find a way to gut that out and make plays when we needed it the most.”Hurts added that the Eagles’ mindset did not change despite having already clinched.“This game wasn’t about anything more than just going out here and playing with mentality. So glad to find a win.”That mentality showed up on defense. Philadelphia shut out Buffalo for three and a half quarters and sacked Josh Allen five times. The unit carried the team when the offense could not. Sirianni did not ignore that imbalance.“A really good first half by the offense, not a great second half,” he said. “Winning’s hard in this league, and I’m always going to enjoy a win. And then I’m going to be really hypercritical on myself first and foremost, and then the rest of the guys after that, and the coaches.”The Eagles won the NFC East weeks ago. Dallas entered the weekend at 7–8. Washington and New York are already out of contention. Philadelphia did not need style points in Buffalo. It needed proof it could survive.","Nick sirianni was caught on camera with an unfiltered message after the eagles survived buffalo.

Edmonton Oilers make NHL trade waiver moves of David Tomasek and Noah Philp



The Edmonton Oilers have also been proactive in shaping their roster before the start of the new year, which may influence the depth and strategy of the team. On Sunday, the team formally put forward David Tomasek and Noah Philp on waivers, and left them vulnerable to other NHL teams.Although these kinds of roster moves are usual in the NHL, the choice of the Oilers has raised some eyebrows, as the future of the two players was polar opposites. Tomasek is destined to be permanently separated from the franchise, but it is not clear how Philp will be, and it may depend on whether any other team will show interest.David Tomasek, who has had a one-day contract with the Edmonton Oilers, is likely to have his contract terminated after waiver placement. Tomasek had 5 points, including three goals and two assists, in more than 22 professional NHL games. The termination will render him a free agent, where he will have the opportunity to pursue other organizations.Noah Philp, however, is a low-risk alternative to other NHL teams. The 27-year-old centerman is currently under a one-year, league-minimum deal with a cap hit of $775,000 and has played 15 games this year, scoring two goals and one assist.Philp has still not been claimed, and his destiny will probably be resolved within the next 24 hours.These roster changes underscore the current strategy of the Oilers to have balance on the lineup without compromising the flexibility in making trade or waiver deals in the NHL. Any suggestion of a claim on Philp will be observed by fans and analysts, and the possible effect of the termination of the contract of Tomasek on the depth of the forwards at Edmonton.Also Read: Net worth of Auston Matthews in 2025: Details on Toronto Maple Leafs captain's earnings, salary, and contracts","Edmonton oilers waive david tomasek and noah philp in roster shuffle.

A proud standard collides with modern NFL pressure and unmet expectations

Mike Tomlin and the Pittsburgh Steelers are now feeling the wrath of fans following a frustrating 13-6 loss to the Cleveland. For the first time in years, a large portion of the fan base is openly questioning whether Mike Tomlin is still the right man to lead the franchise. What once felt like another steady season has unraveled into a mediocre and disappointing outing for the team.With playoff hopes hanging by a thread and sky-high expectations, fans feel the Steelers failed when it mattered the most, and a change in leadership is the need of the hour. It doesn't help that the Steelers lost crucial matches despite consistent performances from their star players, leading the blame to fall on Tomlin.This frustration did not come from the recent disappointing Sunday, as their losing stats have been building up as the season went. The breaking point for many came during the lopsided 26-7 home loss to the Buffalo Bills, when chants calling for Tomlin’s dismissal echoed through Acrisure Stadium. It was a rather unexpected yet understandable moment, echoing the downgrading performance on the field.Fans point to the dynamic roster as proof that more should have been achieved than With star power like Aaron Rodgers and defensive leader T.J. Watt, expectations were high. A strong 4-1 start suggested momentum, yet the Steelers stumbled down the stretch and now sit at 9-7 entering the final week. It is still notable that Pittsburgh has not won a playoff game in eight yearsTomlin, for his part, has not avoided accountability. After hearing the boos, he addressed the situation directly.He said, “Man, I share their frustration tonight. We didn't do enough, and that's just the reality of it. I never want people to apologize for caring.” Despite the honesty, calls for change in leadership are now in full effect on social media.Tomlin is the NFL’s longest-tenured head coach and has never posted a losing season in 19 years. It is indeed a slump for the head coach, who once demanded a lot of respect and admiration from fans. As Pittsburgh prepares for its next game against Baltimore, the results will determine whether fans double down on their current demand.Also read: ‘I could see Tomlin taking a breather’: Could Mike Tomlin really walk away from Steelers and take a year off?",Pittsburgh steelers lost 13-6 to the cleveland browns on sunday.

Oliver Bearman’s 2025 contract: Hitting the F1 money lap

Beyond the chequered flag: Wealth and personal life

Oliver Bearman’s year 2025, however, was the year he took a giant leap in his young racing career, moving from being a junior sensation to becoming the first full-timer at the tender age of 19 with the Haas F1 Team in Formula 1 racing. Off the podium, there’s a new love story brewing in the F1 paddock between not-so-new star Oliver Bearman and Alicia Torriani, who has been spotted several times with the young racing sensation at his races and at the paddock, which helps add another dimension to his story because, apart from the racing action in F1, the purse strings involved in an F1 racing star’s services have their own story to tell.Oliver Bearman's first big contract in Haas F1 Team in 2025 is one of the biggest turning points in his personal as well as professional life. After performing well as a member of the reserve team and earning points in his first races, Oliver signed a multi-year contract. His base salary for the year 2025 has been estimated to be around $1 million, which may be relatively modest in the context of Formula 1 but represents a substantial improvement over what one might find in lower-tier series. It may be noted here that the given figure is much lower than what stars take home but represents Haas’ faith in Daniel Ricciardo’s potential and not stardom per se.Also, performance bonuses could increase his earnings further. Although figures are not revealed, rookies have incentives related to scoring, racing, and team scoring. Therefore, better performance could increase his earnings further.As of 2025, Oliver Bearman has an estimated net worth of approximately $1.3 million, attributed primarily to his income, earnings from his early racing career, and budding success in F1 racing circles. Alicia Torriani, on the other hand, maintains a much more discreet life, and although sparingly observed accompanying Bearman to grands prix events and sharing their experiences, her estimated personal net worth remains unknown.Taken together, their combined wealth offers a glimpse into what it means to be a young driver starting his engine and ready to hit the roads of bigger prospects down the line.Although Bearman’s income now may be small compared to that of a seasoned professional, his inclusion in F1’s rich streets puts him in line for higher incomes down the line as a mature professional in his own right. All in all, he has a bright future because in a world filled with enthusiasts and friends like Torriani backing him up, anything is possible.Also Read: Isack Hadjar net worth in 2025: Salary breakdown, Racing Bulls career, bonuses, and contract details","Oliver bearman's first big contract in haas f1 team in 2025 is one of the biggest turning points in his personal as well as professional life.

Dell and Stephen Curry

Mychal and Klay Thompson

Joe and Kobe Bryant

Rick and Brent Barry

The NBA is already aware of some of the very famous father-son duos, including LeBron James and Bronny James, Dell Curry and Stephen Curry. However, other duos also require special mention. While these duos are helping shape the future of the big league in a significant manner, they are also paving the way for a potentially brighter future. LeBron and Bronny James are playing a season together, and that too for the same team. While this has to be a number one duo, Dell and Stephen Curry are no less.Moments like these are what make the big league a stage where the greatest of all time can truly be witnessed. However, apart from the James and Curry duos, there are others such as Mychal and Klay Thompson, Rick and Brent Barry, and Joe and Kobe Bryant . From their greatest moments to knowing what makes them iconic, here is everything you need to know about the top 5 best father-son duos in the history of the big league.LeBron James and his eldest son, Bronny James, are already one of the topmost iconic duos of all time. While they lead the combined scoring list, this duo has even played together in the 2025-2026 season, and that too on the same team, namely the Los Angeles Lakers. Father LeBron James is an All-Time scorer, and son Bronny James is a promising rookie, and together, they remain unstoppable.The Curry father-son duo is absolute gold, and one thing they have in common is their shared ability for deep shooting, which defines their relationship.While Dell Curry is one of the finest 3-point shooters of his time, Stephen Curry is a 4x NBA champion and a 2x MVP, running parallel with LeBron James.The first 1978 draft pick, Mychal Thompson, is a 2x NBA Champion and was the number one rookie player of his time. He played closer to the rim and has made exactly one 3-pointer in his career. However, things were different for his son Klay Thompson, and while he mastered his shooting skills, he is the type who can take 11 dribbles and score up to 60 points.The Bryant family has always been evergreen throughout. Considering the golden duo of Joe and Kobe Bryant, this pair has achieved it all, since they are the highest-rated combo. Father Joe Bryant has played 8 seasons with the league, and then he went on to France and Italy to raise a legend. Yes, that’s right, Kobe Bryant was an iconic basketball player and has been a 5x NBA Champion and a 2x NBA MVP.Rick Barry has played for over three decades (1960s, 70s, and 80s) and two leagues (NBA and ABA), and that says it all. He has also averaged 36.3 points in 10 NBA Finals games. The former Houston Rockets player and the son of Rick Barry, Brent Barry, is now the assistant coach of the Phoenix Suns. He is a 2x NBA Champion and has played for several teams, like the Chicago Bulls and the San Antonio Spurs.Also read: Dell Curry and Stephen Curry's combined net worth: Exploring NBA’s iconic father-son duo's career earnings, endorsements and more","The nba is already aware of some of the very famous father-son duos, including lebron james and bronny james, dell curry and stephen curry.

Chicago Bears linebacker Noah Sewell could miss rest of 2025 Season after suspected Achilles Tear



The Chicago Bears lost to the San Francisco 49ers in a thriller Week 17 battle. Although the Bears have already clinched the NFC North title, they might have some changes in the seeding order ahead of Week 18. While the team navigates postseason positioning, the bigger concern now revolves around injuries sustained in this high-stakes contest.Two key players went down during the game. Wide receiver Luther Burden appeared shaken after the final play, but thankfully, his injury is not severe. The situation is far more concerning for linebacker Noah Sewell, whose status now clouds the Bears’ defensive outlook.According to NFL Network insider Ian Rapoport, Sewell suffered a suspected Achilles tear, a devastating blow for Chicago. “Bears LB Noah Sewell, who has been a key part of the defense, especially with all the injuries to the position, is believed to have torn his Achilles, sources say,” Rapoport reported, adding that an MRI will confirm the full extent of the injury.Sewell’s loss comes at a crucial time, just a week before the Bears face the Detroit Lions in Week 18, a matchup made even more personal as he goes up against his brother, Penei Sewell.A torn Achilles will end his 2025 regular season along with sidelining him for the playoffs and impact the start of the 2026 season.At only 23 years old, he has become a staple in Chicago’s defense in a short span of time. This season alone has seen 54 tackles and three tackles for a loss from him. His departure means that Tremaine Edmunds, T.J. Edwards, and the rest of their team have one more defensive player to worry about replacing.Now the Bears will have to adjust their defensive plans without one of the rising players from within their team. Sewell’s recovery will not be an easy feat as it will depend on how well the linebackers adjust to the changes needed without Sewell. Although the Bears have already locked up the division title, the playoffs will prove to be more intense with critical defensive plays being more significant.","Chicago bears linebacker noah sewell could miss rest of 2025 season after suspected achilles tear.

LeBron James at $581 million

Stephen Curry at $532 million

Devin Booker at $520 million

Paul George at $516 million

Anthony Davis at $511 million

The NBA has always rewarded greatness, but this era has taken player earnings to a completely different level. Careers are no longer judged only by rings and highlights, but by how well stars play the long game with contracts, extensions, and leverage. Some legends built their fortune brick by brick over two decades, while others exploded into record territory before turning 30. This is not just about being talented.It is about staying relevant, staying healthy, and knowing exactly when to push for more. From dynasty builders to franchise cornerstones, these players have mastered both basketball and business. Their stories reveal how the league’s rising salary cap changed everything. Stick around, because once you see who tops the list and how they got there, the modern NBA looks very different.LeBron‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌ James has become the NBA player with the highest career earnings record. His total income of $581,322,455 over 22 seasons is primarily from the Cleveland Cavaliers, Miami Heat, and Los Angeles Lakers. His path to this record started with his 4-year rookie contract worth $18.8 million in 2003, but really blossomed with max contracts when he moved to Miami in ‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌2010.By 2016, when he returned to Cleveland, he signed a two-year extension for $209 million, making him the highest-paid player in NBA history at that point.ESPN reported in August 2016, that ""In the first year of James' contract, he will earn $31 million, making him the highest-paid player in the NBA for the 2016-17 season,"". This deal was directly negotiated between James and the Cavaliers' management, coinciding with his quest for a championship in his hometown, which he achieved in the 2016 Finals.LeBron James had earned approximately $297.49 million in salary during his time with the Los Angeles Lakers thanks to a four-year contract worth $153.3 million signed in 2018, which was extended in 2020 for an additional two years at $85.6 million.Stephen Curry is in second place with $532,728,665, all accumulated over 17 seasons with the Golden State Warriors. Early on, he signed a team-friendly four-year, $44 million extension in 2012 due to ankle injury worries, which turned out to be a steal after his MVP season in 2015 and the 73-win record.This low-key deal, worked out between Curry's agent Jeff Bzdelik and Myers while Curry was recovering, enabled Golden State to create a dynasty around him without straining their salary cap. It paid off big time; by 2017, Curry signed a five-year, $201 million extension, followed by a four-year, $215 million supermax in 2021, which was the richest eight-year deal at the time of signing.Spotrac ranks Curry third overall but expects him to rise with his 2025-26 salary of $59,606,817. ""Spotrac released its updated list of the NBA's highest career earners, and Curry currently sits third, behind Kevin Durant and LeBron James,"" Curry's shooting revolution made the back-loaded pay worthwhile, transforming a potential injury risk into a $500 million-plus asset.Tied for third place with $520,282,015, Devin Booker's earnings boost comes from his 10-year stint with the Suns, especially after a groundbreaking extension in 2025. At just 28, he inked a two-year, $145 million addition to his existing four-year, $220 million contract, raising his yearly average to a record-setting $72.5 million per season until 2030.""Booker, 28, will receive the highest annual salary in an extension in league history,"" ESPN reported on July 9, 2025, referencing sources involved in the talks between Suns owner Mat Ishbia and Booker's team. The backdrop: Phoenix's 2021 Finals journey, where Booker was the key player, gave him leverage after the 2024 playoffs, during which he averaged 28.7 points.This contract, which became available after Booker's 2024 All-NBA selection, features a player option for the 2030-31 season, setting him up to possibly exceed $600 million by the time he retires. His swift rise from a 2015 lottery pick to a maximum salary player showcases the NBA's focus on youth in this era of increasing salary caps.Tied for third place with $516,917,026, Paul George's earnings cover 15 seasons with the Indiana Pacers, Oklahoma City Thunder, Philadelphia 76ers, and Los Angeles Clippers. His highest earnings came in 2018 when he signed a four-year, $137 million max deal with OKC, which was later renegotiated to a four-year, $190 million extension with the Clippers in 2020 as they aimed for a championship run.This was followed by his 2023 trade to Philadelphia 76ers where he secured a four-year, $211 million contract that added $52.9 million per year, all negotiated during the free agency excitement.The backdrop of his moves: Injuries in 2019 limited his playtime, but his All-Defensive accolades kept the max offers coming. By 2025, at the age of 35, George's experience continues to keep him in the top five, with $51.7 million expected for the 2025-26 season.Angthny Davis is sitting at $511,281,453 rounds out the top five in earnings, showing a mix of dominance and durability challenges during his time with the New Orleans Pelicans and the Lakers. His five-year, $190 million extension with New Orleans in 2017 was outshined by a five-year, $190 million max deal with the Lakers in 2019, after the trade demand.In December 2025, ESPN's trade guide stated ""with AD trade discussions heating up, our experts suggest five trades that could change the league's balance of power,"" quoting insiders on Dallas' investment in Davis' health alongside Doncic. The context: the Lakers' 2020 championship masked injury issues; the 2024-25 trade, as per league sources, had Davis waiving a no-trade clause for a fresh start, locking in his $54.1 million salary for the 2025-26 season.According to Spotrac, Davis has earned $198.17 million from the Lakers, with the Mavericks extension adding two years at rising rates. His Defensive Player of the Year honors (2018, 2020) back up the pay, even as trades highlight health risks.Also Read: LeBron James and Kevin Durant renew a two-decade rivalry as the Los Angeles Lakers face the Houston Rockets on Christmas Day","Lebron james has become the nba player with the highest career earnings record.

The game between the New York Islanders and the Columbus Blue Jackets took a shocking turn when Islanders forward Mathew Barzal was kicked out for a violent incident on the ice, what started as a close NHL game today turned into a fight when both teams got angry.As the fights got worse, officials had to step in and make a strong decision. Not only did Barzal's ejection affect the Islanders' bench. But it also started a lot of talk on NHL updates and news roundups about discipline and intent.The decisive moment came midway through play when Mathew Barzal delivered a forceful slash to the lower leg of Columbus Blue Jackets forward Mason Marchment. The officials assessed the play and issued a major penalty along with a game misconduct, resulting in Barzal’s ejection from the match.Video review showed Barzal swinging his stick with clear force, making contact near Marchment’s skate; an area offering minimal protection. Based on NHL rule standards, officials determined the action carried a risk of injury, justifying the severe penalty.The slash followed a sequence in which Mason Marchment had engaged New York Islanders rookie defenseman Matthew Schaefer in multiple physical plays. One exchange appeared to involve a trip on Schaefer shortly before Barzal’s response, adding context to the retaliation.There were mixed reactions across the league. Some people said Barzal crossed a clear line. Mason Marchment stayed in the game, and there were no immediate updates on injuries in the NHL after the slash.This episode shows how quickly emotions can change the outcome of an NHL game and change the momentum, especially in physical games where split-second choices can have big effects.Also Read: Net worth of Auston Matthews in 2025: Details on Toronto Maple Leafs captain's earnings, salary, and contracts","Islanders' mathew barzal ejected following a slash on jackets' mason marchment.

Making line changes can help the Buffalo Sabres in playoffs

Also Read:

The Buffalo Sabres continue rolling through the NHL with eight consecutive victories. With this the franchise has continued to climb their way up the standings. Head coach Lindy Ruff now faces a welcome but complicated problem as Jason Zucker prepares to return from injury.Ruff confirmed after Sunday's practice that Zucker would travel with the team on their three-game road trip. The announcement indicates the forward could make his season debut as early as this week, creating a difficult lineup decision for the coaching staff.Zucker has appeared in 21 games this season, recording nine goals and nine assists before suffering an injury against Calgary on December 8. The timing of his absence proved fortuitous for Buffalo in one unexpected way.The Sabres haven't lost a single game since he went on injured reserve, embarking on their current eight-game winning streak. The coincidence creates an awkward situation for Ruff. Zucker provides a huge offensive weapon when healthy, and Buffalo clearly plays better with him in the lineup.However, altering the camaraderie that has driven the winning streak bears obvious risks. The coaching staff must identify which player gets bumped from the lineup to facilitate Zucker's comeback.Three forwards stand out as the most logical contenders for substitution.Buffalo's first line currently features Peyton Krebs centering Tage Thompson and Josh Doan. On the surface, replacing Krebs with Zucker makes the most sense. The team could simply move Krebs back to the fourth line, where he's spent most of the season.However, this line has been producing at a high level recently. Krebs scored goals in two of the past three games after recording zero through the first 34 contests. Thompson has exploded with 11 points over the past eight games.Making changes to a line firing on all cylinders would be counterproductive. As long as this trio continues delivering results, Ruff should keep them intact.The second line featuring Ostlund has posted the third-best expected goals percentage of any line with at least 50 minutes of ice time at 55.1 percent. That production makes disrupting this unit equally problematic.The third line of Zach Benson, Ryan McLeod, and Jack Quinn presents the most logical spot for Zucker. This group hasn't matched the production of the other lines. According to MoneyPuck, they own the lowest expected goals percentage by far at 25.4 percent, over 20 percentage points below the next line.That scenario forces Ruff to find a new spot for Benson, likely moving him to the top line and dropping Krebs to the fourth line. The ripple effects of Zucker's return could reshape multiple lines rather than just one.","Jason zucker could make his season debut as early as this week.

How Bryce Dunlap’s liver donation became the centerpiece of Cleveland’s final home game

Bernie Kosar’s message and why this tribute went beyond a typical game-day honor

The Cleveland Browns’ Week 17 matchup against the Pittsburgh Steelers came with a pregame moment that pulled attention away from the standings and straight to the heart of Huntington Bank Field.Kimberly Dunlap Kane, the mother of Bryce Dunlap, served as the Browns’ Dawg Pound Captain for the final home game of the 2025 season. The tribute carried real weight. Bryce Dunlap was the organ donor who saved the life of Browns legend Bernie Kosar, and his family was honored in front of a full stadium before kickoff.Before Kane walked onto the field, the Browns played a recorded message from Kosar on the stadium video board. The timing mattered. This was Cleveland’s last home game of the season and the team chose to center it on gratitude, not football.“I can’t even begin to share how appreciative I am for the gift I received from Bryce Dunlap,” Kosar said. “Everyone please get on your feet, and make some noise and show some support for my hero, Bryce.”Kane then stepped onto the field and smashed a black-and-yellow, Steelers-themed guitar to start the game.It was symbolic, but not theatrical. The moment was about Bryce, not the rivalry.Bryce Dunlap passed away on Nov. 16 at age 21 after complications from an anoxic brain injury. His family selected Kosar as the recipient of Bryce’s liver through a directed donation. Kosar received the transplant on Nov. 17 and was discharged from the hospital on Nov. 24.According to the Browns, the organization and Kosar have remained in contact with the Dunlap family since the transplant. The team confirmed Kane’s Dawg Pound Captain role ahead of kickoff and shared the moment publicly, crediting Bryce directly for Kosar’s recovery.Kosar was not in attendance for the game, but he shared his support again through social media. His message stayed consistent. This was about honoring Bryce and his family, not celebrating his own recovery.“Hi, Browns fans,” Kosar said in the video posted by the team. “I can’t even begin to share how appreciative I am for the gift I received from Bryce Dunlap. Everyone, please get on your feet and make some noise to show your support for my hero, Bryce. And here to represent Bryce is his mother, Kimberly Dunlap Kane, who’ll be today’s Dawg Pound Captain. You matter, Go Browns.”Kosar has dealt with cirrhosis of the liver and Parkinson’s disease since 2024, making the transplant necessary. The donation was processed through LifeBanc, a nonprofit organ procurement organization. Kosar shared a recovery update after surgery and has remained publicly thankful to the Dunlap family.The Browns’ decision to center their final home pregame ceremony around Kane reframed the day. It was not about playoff implications or season results. It was about acknowledging the cost of Bryce Dunlap’s gift and the family behind it.Cleveland has hosted many Dawg Pound Captains over the years. This one stood apart. Not because of spectacle, but because it reminded everyone in the building that some moments in the NFL have nothing to do with football and everything to do with life.","Cleveland browns used their final home game to honor bryce dunlap’s life-saving organ donation and his mother, kimberly dunlap kane.
