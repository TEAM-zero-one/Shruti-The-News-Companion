Dwight Freeney explains why winning may push Maxx Crosby toward change

For a long time, Maxx Crosby was the last player anyone expected to question his future with the Las Vegas Raiders. He played hurt, spoke about loyalty, and made it clear he wanted to be part of the franchise’s turnaround. That is why the current situation feels different. As the offseason approaches, Crosby’s name is suddenly at the center of trade talk.The reason is simple. Winning has not followed him. Crosby has done his part year after year, but the Raiders have not taken the next step. Tensions inside the locker room have grown, and recent events around his health only added fuel to the conversation. Former players are now openly wondering if staying in Las Vegas still makes sense for him.Former NFL star Dwight Freeney shared his thoughts on Up & Adams, focusing on what Crosby is missing most in his career. “The feeling of winning; there’s no feeling like that,” Freeney said. “When you win in the playoffs, and when you go to the playoffs, win a Super Bowl, those are the moments that stay with you forever.”The Raiders last made the playoffs in 2021. Since then, Crosby has collected Pro Bowl selections and signed a massive three-year, $106.5 million extension with $91.5 million guaranteed.His effort has never been questioned. His frustration, however, is becoming harder to ignore.Crosby injured his knee during the Raiders’ 31-0 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs in Week 7 but kept playing. In Week 17, Las Vegas finally shut him down against the New York Giants, placing him on injured reserve even though he wanted to stay on the field. Head coach Pete Carroll later said Crosby could also miss the season finale. Reports followed that Crosby wanted to leave the facility after hearing the decision.The timing matters. Crosby’s contract looks huge, but it is flexible. If the Raiders move him early in the 2026 league year, the dead-cap hit is small and the cap savings are large. After March 17, trading him becomes far more difficult. He also has no guaranteed money after 2026, which puts pressure on both sides to act soon.Trade ideas are already forming. Kay Adams has openly backed the Chicago Bears. “I’m rooting for him to be a Bear,” she said. “He’s a Michigan kid. He’s going to thrive in the cold, wherever that stadium is built.”Teams like the Baltimore Ravens, Dallas Cowboys, Los Angeles Chargers, Detroit Lions, and Cincinnati Bengals could also make sense. But, nothing is decided yet.","Dwight freeney explains why winning may push maxx crosby toward change.

Anime has come a long way from getting fully Americanized and rewritten to upholding its authenticity. It transcended the niche fandom and language barriers and showed people the world above the subtitles. In the era of global connectivity, the bridge between world-class athleticism and anime has never been shorter. And the NBA is not untouched by this wave.It is no longer surprising to see world-class athletes rocking a Naruto cloak on the hardwood or discussing the nuances of Jujutsu Kaisen during a post-game presser. Zion Williamson once famously estimated that 80% of the league watches anime, and today, that passion is visible in custom sneakers, tattoos, and pre-game rituals. Here are five NBA stars who truly live the ""otaku"" life.Zion isn't just a casual viewer, he is essentially the league's anime ambassador, especially after tattooing Naruto’s Eight Trigrams seal on his stomach. His obsession with Naruto is so deep that he has collaborated with Jordan Brand on several Naruto-inspired colorways like Rasengan. To Zion, the show is a blueprint for his career, dealing with massive expectations and internal power.He famously wore a Hokage-style outfit to Comic-Con and views the protagonist, Naruto’s way of the Ninja, as a direct parallel to his own journey through injury and scrutiny.The Kings’ explosive guard is a lifelong Dragon Ball Z fanatic. Fox has often credited the high energy of the series for his style of play. He identifies most with Vegeta, the Prince of Saiyans, admiring the character's relentless passion and drive to surpass his rivals. Fox’s love for the anime can be seen through his special Dragon Ball edition sneakers with a custom ""Vegeta"" logo featured. He has been frequently spotted at conventions, proving his fandom goes far beyond just watching the show on the team plane.Mavericks’ Daniel Gafford is an avid anime fan, especially of Dragon Ball Z and recently of Demon Slayer. He has a prominent tattoo of Goku, Vegeta, and Gohan on his left knee, representing his admiration for his childhood heroes. Recently, Gafford also added a fresh tattoo on his hand of Rengoku from Demon Slayer. Gafford doesn't just watch for the action, he uses it as a mental reset to never give up.Celtics star guard Jaylen Brown is a known anime fan and is drawn to the creative storytelling, along with the psychological and philosophical plots. He has praised Death Note for its complex morality and Demon Slayer for its stunning animation. The 2024 Finals MVPviews anime as something that challenges the brain and often shares his recommendations with younger teammates to help them expand their creative horizons beyond the court.The NBA’s strongest man and Rockets star center is a big One Piece fan. The anime’s pirate-like personality fits Adams perfectly. In an interview, Adams admitted that he spent much of his downtime during injury rehab catching up on the 1,000+ episodes of One Piece. In 2019, Crunchyroll tweeted promoting Steven Adams for the All-Star Game. Other anime that Adams has shown interest in are: One Punch Man, Naruto, and Hunter X Hunter.The stigma around being an anime-head in professional sports is slowly evaporating, and these players prove that you can be a ruthless competitor on the hardwood while still finding inspiration in the vibrant, emotional worlds of Japanese animation. Whether it’s a Kamehameha celebration or a custom pair of kicks, the Anime NBA era is officially here to stay.Also read: 6 heartwarming Klay Thompson and Megan Thee Stallion moments fans couldn’t stop smiling about in 2025","Anime has come a long way from getting fully americanized and rewritten to upholding its authenticity.

Nikola Jokic suffered a knee hyperextension vs Heat, MRI Tuesday, return timeline unclear

Nikola Jokic has faced multiple injuries over his career, with a fresh left knee setback in 2025 now under review

Fans of the Denver Nuggets are eagerly awaiting word on the condition of three-time MVP Nikola Jokic, who suffered a left knee injury against the Miami Heat on Monday night. With just six seconds remaining in the second quarter, Jokic sustained the injury. Despite being listed as questionable to return, he never played again.The Denver Nuggets may soon be put to the test after spending the offseason assembling a team that could at least survive without Nikola Jokic. Fans of the Nuggets and the NBA as a whole who like seeing an all-time great player fill the stat sheet were alarmed when Jokic left Monday night's game against the Miami Heat due to a knee injury and did not return.During Monday's game against the Heat, Jokic seemed to hyperextend his knee after teammate Spencer Jones stepped on him beneath the basket. A hyperextension is defined by the Cleveland Clinic as ""an injury that happens when your knee is bent backward beyond its usual limit.""Usually, a hyperextension is an occurrence that can result in knee ligament damage rather than a diagnosis in and of itself. Jokic must thus have an MRI on Tuesday to ascertain the precise nature of his knee injury.As they assess how long the former MVP will be sidelined, the Nuggets hope that Jokic largely avoided ligament injury, with the ACL being the most important of the group. Jokic, meanwhile, left with a noticeable limp after collapsing to the ground in agony and never came back.David Adelman, the coach of the Nuggets, claimed that Jokic realized the injury right away. On Thursday, January 1, 2026, the team will play the Raptors. Nuggets coach David Adelman said after the game:“Immediately, he knew something was wrong… This is part of the NBA. Anyone who gets hurt, it’s gut-wrenching, especially somebody as special as he is.”Apart from announcing that Jokic would get an MRI on Tuesday, Nuggets coach David Adelman was unable to provide much of an update following the defeat. Adelman stated that the Nuggets ""will go through the process properly"" and that he is ""hoping for the best.""It is anticipated that Jokic's timetable won't be known until after Tuesday's MRI.Jokic might still miss a lot of time even if he doesn't get a serious injury. That would be an uncommon development for the three-time MVP, who hasn't missed more than five straight games since 2017. During his rise to MVP status, Jokic established himself as one of the NBA's most resilient players.Throughout his career, Nikola sustained several serious injuries. This prevented him from appearing in court for a considerable amount of time. But each time he went back to the court, he made sure to make an impression.The athlete's most recent injury occurred during the Miami Heat game. Due to a serious knee injury, he was unable to play in the second half of the match. Let's examine all of the significant ailments the Nuggets player has suffered over his career while supporters wait for an update on his setback.Jokic's most recent injury was a left knee injury in 2025. It happened in the closing minutes of the Miami Heat game's first half. Jokic unintentionally tread on Spencer Jones' toes. Jokic did not return for the second half of the game after hobbling off the court. We are awaiting the team's comprehensive report.In terms of injuries, the athlete's year does not appear to be going well. Both Jokic and Jamal Murray had to miss a few games in the first half of the season owing to injuries. Jokic has a bruise to his right shooting elbow in addition to an ankle impingement that limited his range of motion. The sportsman was given a severe instruction to rest by Denver Nuggets coach Michael Malone. Jokic's ankle ailment kept him out of several games.Also read: ""He wasn't the superstar he is now""- Michael Porter Jr. opens up on doubting Nikola Jokic’s greatness in Denver Nuggets training camp","Nikola jokic suffered a left knee injury against the miami heat on monday night.

Nikita Kucherov finishes the year on good note as Tampa Bay Lightning star named NHL’s First Star of the Week,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/nikita-kucherov-finishes-the-year-on-good-note-as-tampa-bay-lightning-star-named-nhls-first-star-of-the-week/articleshow/126252253.cms,"Nikita Kucherov named NHL First Star of the Week (Image via: Getty Images)

Nikita Kucherov named NHL’s First Star of the Week, Lightning get their game back on track



Ending the year on a good note, Nikita Kucherov has stepped up once again for the Tampa Bay Lightning at exactly the right time. The star forward has delivered a strong stretch of hockey, scoring four goals and putting up six points in his last three games while helping Tampa Bay win all three matchups during an important part of their season.This run has earned him the NHL’s First Star of the Week, and it feels fitting. Kucherov didn’t just pile up numbers in easy situations. He produced when games were physical, tense, and could have slipped away, showing the kind of control and composure that separates elite players from everyone else.The Lightning needed leadership and finishing, and Kucherov provided both. After a heated, demanding rivalry game against the Florida Panthers, Tampa Bay nearly let a comfortable 4–1 lead vanish against the Montreal Canadiens before pulling through in a shootout. Even with momentum swings and pressure moments, Kucherov stayed sharp, continued creating offense, and played with the calm presence his team relies on.His overall season numbers back up the recognition. With 17 goals and 49 points in 34 games, Kucherov remains one of the league’s top offensive producers and sits firmly in the NHL’s scoring race alongside names like Connor McDavid Nathan MacKinnon , Macklin Celebrini, and a handful of other elite forwards.His pace may be slightly behind last season’s extraordinary production, but that does not take away from the impact he is still having.There is also plenty of time ahead. With more than half the schedule still remaining, Kucherov has room to push his totals even higher and possibly work his way back toward the 120-point range once again.

It reassures the team that their star forward is still driving the attack and capable of lifting them when games get difficult.

Memphis Matchup and Game Outlook

ahead of the Philadelphia 76ers’ game against the Memphis Grizzlies on December 30, 2025. The Sixers listed their star center as questionable, leaving his availability unresolved just hours before tip-off.Philadelphia enters the game at 16-14 and riding a three-game losing streak. Injuries have played a role in that slide, and Embiid’s absence has been especially noticeable. Memphis, sitting at 15-17, is dealing with its own inconsistencies, but the matchup carries weight for both teams as the season reaches its midpoint.Joel Embiid missed Philadelphia’s last game, a 129-104 loss to Oklahoma City, due to a right ankle sprain along with ongoing right knee injury management. The ankle issue is new, while the knee has been a recurring problem throughout the season.He has since been upgraded from out to questionable. Head coach Nick Nurse is expected to make a final decision after his pregame evaluation. At 31, Embiid has already missed enough games to put award eligibility at risk, making every lineup decision more significant.Before sitting out against the Thunder, Joel Embiid showed he can still control games when available.He scored 31 points against Chicago, shooting 10-of-19 from the field in 32 minutes.On the season, he is averaging 21.8 points, 6.5 rebounds, and 2.8 assists while shooting 44.3 percent. Those numbers are lower than his MVP season, but his presence still changes how defenses play Philadelphia.The Philadelphia 76ers remain thin in other areas. Kelly Oubre Jr. is out with a left knee sprain, and Trendon Watford continues to miss time due to a left adductor strain. Two-way players MarJon Beauchamp and Johni Broome are listed as doubtful.Tyrese Maxey and Paul George are expected to play. Maxey has carried the offense at 30.7 points per game. If Embiid cannot go, Quentin Grimes and Andre Drummond take on larger roles, with Drummond anchoring the paint.The Memphis Grizzlies are ninth in the West and rely heavily on Jaren Jackson Jr. for interior defense. If Embiid plays, that matchup will be central to the game.Also read: Philadelphia 76ers vs Memphis Grizzlies regular season game: Full injury report, who's out, where to watch, and more (December 30, 2025) Philadelphia opened as a 1.5-point favorite with a total of 233.5, but Embiid’s status keeps the outlook uncertain.

What happened to Kyren Williams in Week 17?

What this means for the Rams

Also Read:

The Los Angeles Rams took a breath of relief after Week 17, as concerns around Kyren Williams’ health ultimately proved to be a scare rather than a setback. The Rams’ lead running back was evaluated late during the game against the Atlanta Falcons, but all signs now point toward him being available moving forward.Williams, who has been central to Sean McVay’s offensive plans this season, briefly raised alarm bells when he appeared to be dealing with ankle discomfort during the fourth quarter. Television cameras caught the 25-year-old wincing on the sideline, prompting speculation about another potential injury at a critical stage of the year.Williams admitted postgame that he was checked for an ankle issue late in the loss to Atlanta. The concern stemmed from multiple awkward tackles around his lower leg and ankle area, including one at the end of a key 22-yard run in the closing stages.However, Williams revealed that recent medical history worked in his favor. He credited a previous tightrope procedure designed to stabilize the ankle joint for preventing what could have been a far more serious injury. The running back did not miss any snaps and finished the game strongly despite the brief evaluation.As of now, the Rams have not placed Williams on the injury report with any major designation. There is no indication that he suffered a high-ankle sprain or structural damage, and team officials remain optimistic about his availability.The situation is especially significant given the Rams’ thin backfield depth at the moment. Blake Corum exited the game earlier with injury and did not return after halftime, while Ronnie Rivers was forced into a larger role behind Williams. Had Williams gone down as well, Los Angeles would have been left dangerously short-handed.Williams’ importance to the Rams cannot be overstated. Against the Falcons, he finished with 92 rushing yards on 13 carries and added 38 receiving yards, with most of his production coming in the second half. His ability to push through discomfort and remain effective highlighted his value as both a runner and a pass-catching option.With the postseason picture already settled for Los Angeles, maintaining Williams’ health is now a priority rather than pushing him unnecessarily. Head coach Sean McVay is expected to take a cautious approach if there is any lingering soreness, especially with Corum’s status still uncertain.Barring any setbacks in practice, Kyren Williams is expected to remain available for the Rams in the season finale and beyond. While the ankle scare drew attention, the outcome appears favorable, with no long-term concerns at this stage.",Los angeles rams running back kyren williams was evaluated for an ankle injury late in the game against the atlanta falcons.

Chiefs enter final game with growing questions over Travis Kelce ’s retirement and playing status



Taylor Swift’s Christmas Day appearance at Arrowhead Stadium wasn’t the only time she was around the Kansas City Chiefs during the holiday season. While she was seen supporting fiancé Travis Kelce during the game, another moment from her time with the team quietly surfaced later and offered a calmer, more personal glimpse into the festive week.A year-end Instagram Reel shared by Ana Demmer, partner of Chiefs center Creed Humphrey, included a photo from a Chiefs holiday gathering. The image showed several players’ partners posing together, and Swift appeared casually in the back-left corner. Brittany Mahomes stood on the opposite side in a blue dress, while Swift’s familiar red lipstick stood out even though her full look wasn’t visible. It was a simple snapshot, but it highlighted how she has become naturally present around the team and the people connected to it.With off-field moments noted, attention turns directly back to football. The Kansas City Chiefs have just one regular-season game remaining on January 4 against the Las Vegas Raiders on the road. Their loss to the Los Angeles Chargers on December 14 confirmed that the Chiefs are out of postseason contention, meaning this final matchup will officially close their 2025–26 campaign.That situation has intensified discussion around Kelce at a professional level.Two straightforward questions surround him at this stage: Will he play in the final game, and is this going to be his last NFL season? His workload, age, and long career have already fueled conversations about whether retirement may come sooner rather than later. Missing the playoffs adds another layer to that conversation, simply because it marks the end of competitive football for the team this season, and decisions often take shape around moments like this.Kelce remains a central figure in Kansas City, and any decision he makes carries real importance for the organization. Whether he suits up against the Raiders or not, the final game becomes significant because of what it could represent for both the veteran tight end and the Chiefs moving forward.As the regular season winds down, the Chiefs finish a challenging year, and clarity on Kelce’s future becomes the key storyline. For now, all attention stays on January 4.Also Read: ""Time will tell if..."": Jason Kelce's subtle reveal hints at an unconventional wedding for Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce",Taylor swift was spotted at the kansas city chiefs' christmas celebration.

Defenseman of the Carolina Hurricanes, K'Andre Miller, returned to the ice following his absence as a result of a lower-body injury sustained on December 23 in a game against the Florida Panthers. The introduction of Miller is a big boost to the Hurricanes, who have been dealing with injuries throughout their roster over the last few weeks. His comeback offers insight into the blue line as the club gears up to play NHL games.Miller had had a short-term sidelining, including missing the team on Saturday, but he was at full practice on Sunday. Rod Brind'Amour, who is the head coach, said that he was sure that Miller is ready, as the defenseman could solidify the defense of the Hurricanes and the morale of the team as well.K-Andre has passed the test of playing and has looked solid in training, Brind-Amour said. The Hurricanes have been going through a difficult period, and their goaltender, Pyotr Kochetkov, will not be available for all of the season after he chose to undergo surgery due to his long-standing lower-body problem.The substitution of a more seasoned defensive presence enables Brind’Amour to reposition pairings when Miller comes back.In the recent games, Carolina has changed its defense, and Shayne Gostisbehere has to manage some minor injuries, besides Gavin Bayreuther shifting between the AHL and NHL.Having Miller back, the Hurricanes are optimistic about continuing their good performance in the Eastern Conference and coping with the effects of other absences.

Shedeur Sanders Postgame Press Conference | Week 17 vs. Pittsburgh Steelers

Also Read:

The Cleveland Browns’ 13-6 upset win over the Pittsburgh Steelers in Week 17 delivered more than just a shake-up in the AFC playoff picture. It also produced a rare postgame moment that resonated well beyond the final score, as veteran quarterback Aaron Rodgers shared a message of encouragement with Browns rookie Shedeur Sanders.With Pittsburgh needing a victory to clinch the AFC North, the pressure was squarely on Rodgers and the Steelers offense. Instead, Cleveland’s defense controlled the tempo, and Sanders did just enough to guide the Browns to a gritty divisional win. But it was what happened after the final whistle that lingered longest.As cameras rolled on the field at Huntington Bank Field, Rodgers was spotted approaching Sanders with a smile. Despite the disappointment of a loss that complicated Pittsburgh’s postseason path, the 42-year-old quarterback took time to acknowledge the rookie’s effort.“Good job, man. Rooting for you. I’m proud of you,” Rodgers was heard telling Sanders, a brief exchange that quickly made the rounds on social media.For Sanders, still navigating the steep learning curve of his first NFL season, the words carried weight. Praise from a future Hall of Famer, especially one known for his competitive edge, offered validation during a year filled with scrutiny and adjustment.On the field, Sanders’ performance reflected progress rather than polish. He finished the game with controlled decision-making, avoided major mistakes, and leaned on the Browns’ defense to secure the win. The result moved him to 2-4 as a starter, a modest record that nonetheless highlights incremental growth.Facing a Steelers defense built on pressure and physicality, Sanders showed composure in key moments. While Cleveland’s offense scored just 13 points, it was enough on a day when defense ruled.After the game, Sanders downplayed the significance of sharing the field with Rodgers, sticking to the grounded tone that has defined his rookie season. At just 23, he has repeatedly emphasized learning and enjoyment over legacy moments.Sanders also received encouragement from Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin, who embraced the rookie and offered his own words of support. The exchange underscored a broader theme from Sunday: respect across generations, even in defeat.The moment carried an added historical layer. Nearly two decades ago, Sanders’ father, Deion Sanders, faced Rodgers when the latter was a rookie in Green Bay. This time, the roles were reversed: Rodgers the veteran, Sanders the newcomer with Cleveland emerging on top.For the Cleveland Browns, the win offered reassurance amid a rebuilding season. For the Pittsburgh Steelers, it meant a delayed celebration and a tense Week 18 ahead.And for Shedeur Sanders, the quiet exchange with Aaron Rodgers became a reminder that even in a learning season, respect from the league’s elite can mark meaningful progress.","Cleveland browns rookie shedeur sanders received a rare moment of respect from aaron rodgers.

From overwhelming love in Angola to a personal DNA reveal planned for the tour finale

irl stream in Angola 🇦🇴





Darren Watkins, aka “IShowSpeed,” has been teasing his Africa tour for quite some time, and the popular streamer kept his word. The 20-year-old YouTube and Twitch star officially kicked off his highly anticipated Speed Does Africa tour on December 29, 2025, starting in Angola. He was immediately struck by the ambiance and the welcome he received during his stream.Watkins was also pretty much swept up by all the love and lively atmosphere during the tour while also reflecting on his Angolan roots. The streamer also promised fans that he would reveal proper detailed information about his ethnicity by the end of the tour. Safe to say, this journey has been his most personal and introspective so far among his travels around the world.Midway through his Angola broadcast, IShowSpeed paused to take in his environment and to reflect on what he was feeling in the moment. Surrounded by locals and the constant attention, the streamer could not hide his excitement. He told viewers, ""Bro, I'm not going to lie, bro, I love the love in Africa, bro. The energy here is crazy. The energy and love, bro. I really do love the love and energy here, bro. Oh, I keep speaking Portuguese.That same stream also showed a rather quirky moment between Speed and a local individual. A man on a motorcycle approached Speed asking for money, leading to an awkward but calm exchange. Speed addressed it directly on stream, where he told the individual asking for $100 to wait, as he does not have cash at hand.Further on, Speed confirmed that his African tour will end with a long-awaited reveal of his ethnicity and DNA test results. He has teased this for months, telling fans he is 80% African and 20% European. During the Angola stream, he hinted strongly at Angolan roots, responding to a viewer’s question by saying, ""'How much Angola DNA you have?' It's a lot. It's a lot of percent.

Veteran NHL goalie Marc-Andre Fleury set to make a comeback to the league soon

Rumors around the NHL are intensifying around goaltender Marc-Andre Fleury, as speculation mounts that the three-time Stanley Cup champion could make a comeback, owing to the critical goaltending situation going on across the league, particularly with the Edmonton Oilers and other teams struggling to find a perfect goalie to address their goaltending situation.Fleury officially wrapped up his impressive 21-year NHL career after the 2024–25 season, leaving behind a remarkable legacy of around 1,050 games played, along with several Stanley Cup wins, and a well-earned reputation as one of the most respected goalies of his time.Despite that, the goalie recently made a short preseason appearance for the Pittsburgh Penguins, the team that selected him first overall in 2003, marking a beautiful full-circle moment of his professional journey. But his stint with the NHL does not end here. According to Bleacher Report's Frank Seravalli, he stated that it feels Fleury is done, but feels it would take a special circumstance for him to return to NHL action. Veteran NHL goalie Marc-Andre Fleury set to make a comeback to the league soon. According to reports, the last time hockey fans saw goaltender Marc-Andre Fleury in an NHL uniform was in September, when he returned to the Pittsburgh Penguins to play a period of a preseason game.The contest was supposed to bring his 21-year career full circle before he headed off to a well-deserved retirement. However, the lack of quality goaltending depth in the NHL trade market has sparked speculation that Fleury might be persuaded to return to action.TSN's Pierre LeBrun reported that some teams had checked in with Fleury. ESPN's Greg Wyshynski claimed he'd heard that the future Hall of Famer was open to a comeback. He suggested the three-time Stanley Cup champion might be a fit with the Edmonton Oilers.Meanwhile, speaking about the same, NHL Insider PierreVLeBrun stated, “Probably not surprising but hearing that some teams have checked in on Marc-Andre Fleury to see if there’s any chance at all he would consider playing again. Again, not surprised teams with goalie needs would want to check on it.”Despite all the excitement, Fleury hasn't confirmed yet about making a comeback to the NHL. His retirement seems genuine, and lately, he's only been in several ceremonial events and special appearances, not a full-on return to competition.Analysts point out that while the thought of Fleury rejoining the league is fun to speculate about, there are some real challenges to consider, like contract negotiations, finding the right team fit, his physical condition, and most importantly, what Fleury himself really wants.","Veteran nhl goalie marc-andre fleury set to make a comeback to the league soon.
