Stephen A. Smith fires back at LeBron James, again



What did LeBron James say about his feud with Stephen A. Smith?



Just when it seemed that the highly discussed feud between Los Angeles Lakers legend LeBron James and Stephen A. Smith was over, it took a new turn. After James’s response to the confrontation with Smith in his recent chat with Pat McAfee, Smith did not hold back, as he gave a fiery remark to threaten James’ legacy. The incident has been the talk of the town, and it appears that both parties are not ready to move on just yet.ESPN’s Stephen A. Smith has been one of the vocal critics of Bronny James , and now his attention has shifted to Bronny’s father, LeBron James. After James’ discussion of his courtside confrontation with Smith with F-words, the NBA analyst fueled the fire with more gasoline as he did not hesitate to respond with a bold remark.“But don’t the truth matter?” Smith asked his audience during the latest episode of the show on Wednesday's Stephen A. Smith Show . “Because there’s one person in this ordeal that’s telling the truth and it’s me... And there’s a lot of shady stuff that he does and one of the things is passive aggressiveness and the two facedness,” Smith continued. “I happened to know that about him which is why I don’t like him and he don’t like me but it doesn't stop me from being fair and calling it like I see it.”Smith asked James why his son and family were in the Crypto.com arena if he couldn’t handle the criticism. He further slammed the Lakers veteran for his response to Smith on the Pat McAfee show .""It was fresh out of a timeout. It was him walking to the basketball court. It was on national television. The cameras were rolling. And had I done something, what do y'all want me to do? You want me to act new? You want this to be a reincarnation of Chris Rock and Will Smith?"" the NBA analyst recalled the incident.But Smith was all armed up for a fight if the altercation turned into a physical brawl. ""And let me state for the record that while we bring up that, let me assure you it wouldn't have gone down like that. I would have gotten my a** kicked because had that man put his hands on me, I would have immediately swung on him. Immediately. That I'm not going to tolerate,"" he said.He continued, ""I knew he wasn't going to do something like that. There was no fear in my mind about it. It was shock because as I have repeatedly stated, I was not talking about his son. I was talking about him.""Smith also asserted that James’ legacy in the league does not matter much. ""When you retire let's see how much I talk about you then. You won't matter much. I promise you. I won't be talking about you much when you stop playing, but as long as you're playing, I'm going to talk about you because that's my job, and I'm going to be very objective about it. You deserve praise. I'm gonna give it to you. You deserve criticism. I'm gonna give that to, but at least I'm going to tell the truth instead of lying.""James recently had a chat with McAfee on the Pat McAfee show, and he gave his reaction to the whole ordeal. ""Motherf*****, if there's one person who could not wait to address it,"" James said.""What I do know is that he completely missed the whole point. Missed the whole point. Never would I ever not allow to talk about the sport, criticize players what they do on the court. it is your job. It's part of the game. But when you take it and you get personal with it, it is my job to protect my damn household, but protect the players. I think a lot of the media, including him.""Also Read: ""We don't talk, because I'm still playing"": LeBron James opens up on his relationship with Michael Jordan and what the future might hold The Lakers star further mocked Smith, saying that he “is on a Taylor Swift tour run right now.”","Espn's stephen a. smith has been one of the vocal critics of bronny james.

Erin Andrews on managing a hectic career while adjusting to the realities of motherhood

Episode 312: CAN YOU GIVE ME A MINUTE?! | Calm Down Podcast

Erin Andrews on juggling a successful broadcasting career, a growing business, and motherhood

Renowned sports broadcaster Erin Andrews is no stranger to navigating a demanding career while balancing personal responsibilities. However, during a recent episode of the Calm Down podcast, Andrews got emotional as she reflected on what she described as an incredibly difficult year juggling work, motherhood, and her personal life.As a veteran Fox Sports reporter, Erin Andrews has spent years covering the NFL with relentless dedication. But now, as a mother to nearly 2-year-old Mack—whom she shares with husband and former NHL player Jarret Stoll—she’s finding that the demands of her career and family life are harder to balance than ever.“It’s really hard, it really is,” Erin Andrews admitted during a live taping of her podcast with co-host Charissa Thompson. “My better half [Stoll] works in the hockey world, and so his season is going on at the same time. This was a really, really hard year. I’m going to get emotional about it.”Erin Andrews recalled that during Mack’s first year as a newborn, it was easier to leave for work. But now, as he grows older and more aware of her departures, the emotional toll has increased. “I had this attitude like, ‘I have this career and this is how it’s going to be.’ And then he starts talking and realizing you’re leaving, and it was just really, really hard.”Beyond her broadcasting career, Andrews is also deeply involved in her clothing line, WEAR by Erin Andrews, making her schedule even more demanding. She shared how she often felt like she wasn’t giving enough to any aspect of her life.“I would just have multiple meltdowns with Charissa saying, ‘I feel like I’m not giving 100 percent of myself to my son, or my job, or my clothing line, and I feel like I am barely above water,’” Andrews revealed. “And then your relationships start to suffer.”She admitted that the intensity of the football season kept her from seeing friends and maintaining personal connections. Once the season ended, she looked back and thought, “I don’t know… excuse me, how the f–k I did that.”Reflecting on the past year, Andrews recognized the need to be kinder to herself. “I need to go easier on myself, and I’ve realized that. I was so worried I wasn’t giving all of myself to both things that I was doing the best I could, and everybody’s fine. I just need to give myself a little grace.”Her openness about the struggles of working motherhood resonates with many, especially those juggling high-pressure careers with raising children. As she moves into the next NFL season, Andrews hopes to apply the lessons she’s learned, prioritizing balance and self-compassion.Also Read: Taylor Swift’s iHeartRadio speech hides a secret—Fans think they’ve uncovered it Her journey, marked by resilience and honesty, continues to inspire, proving that even the most accomplished women face the challenge of finding harmony between career and family.","Erin andrews is a veteran fox sports reporter and mother to nearly 2-year-old mack.

Edmonton Oilers’ offseason mistake: The fallout of letting key players walk



Paul Bissonnette on the Four Nations Face-Off & Hockey’s Future | Games With Names

Holloway and Broberg making Edmonton regret their decision



Could this mistake cost Edmonton a shot at Stanley Cup?



The Edmonton Oilers made what seemed like a smart financial decision last offseason, choosing not to match the St. Louis Blues ’ offer sheets for Philip Broberg and Dylan Holloway . But now, as both players thrive in St. Louis, Oilers fans and analysts are left questioning whether this was a disastrous misstep. Could letting go of these rising stars come back to haunt Edmonton in the playoffs?The Oilers opted not to match the offer sheets extended to Broberg and Holloway by the St. Louis Blues. Broberg, a 23-year-old defenseman, signed a two-year, $9.16 million deal, while Holloway inked a two-year, $4.59 million contract. With the Oilers already balancing hefty contracts for superstars like Connor McDavid and Leon Draisaitl, they chose to let both players go rather than stretch their cap space.At first glance, it appeared to be a pragmatic decision. But as the current season unfolds, it’s clear that the Oilers may have underestimated the value of these young talents. Broberg has emerged as a standout defenseman in St. Louis, even outperforming some of Edmonton’s key blueliners in pivotal moments. Holloway, on the other hand, has taken his offensive game to another level, proving to be a dynamic force in the Blues' lineup.Holloway and Broberg have silenced any doubts about their potential. The former first-round picks have played a crucial role in the Blues’ playoff push, with Holloway amassing 58 points (23 goals, 35 assists) in 72 games and Broberg contributing 23 points (seven goals, 16 assists) in 59 games. Their stellar performances have propelled St. Louis into the final wildcard spot in the Western Conference, positioning them as a dangerous team heading into the postseason.Former NHLer Paul Bissonnette recently weighed in on the decision, questioning why Edmonton would willingly part ways with young, physically dominant players after a deep playoff run. His concerns resonate with Oilers fans who now watch Broberg and Holloway excel elsewhere while their team struggles to find the same spark as last season.The Oilers are still a formidable team and remain on track for a playoff berth, but their current roster lacks the depth and youthful energy that Broberg and Holloway provided. Could this move ultimately cost them a Stanley Cup run? If St. Louis continues their surge, Edmonton’s front office may have to answer some tough questions about why they let two rising stars slip away.Also Read: Quinn Hughes: The Canucks’ captain who leads with heart and game-changing plays For now, all eyes will be on St. Louis as they put their six-game winning streak on the line.

The grind of the AHL and the transition to the NHL



Seattle Kraken's Jessica Campbell chats with Julie & Cat | Episode 10

When Jessica Campbell received the life-changing call that she had been named assistant coach of the Seattle Kraken , she immediately broke down in tears of joy. The former player has loved hockey her whole life. She started as a player in Canada before pivoting to coaching. Her hiring in July made history, as she became the first female full-time assistant coach behind an NHL bench. The moment was deeply emotional for Campbell, who had spent years working toward this opportunity.Campbell's milestone moment wasn’t lost on her—or the fans. She received a loud ovation when she was introduced at Climate Pledge Arena during the Kraken’s season opener against the St. Louis Blues.“It was a surreal moment because I had been working toward this for so long,” she shared her feelings. “But when I called home, I just immediately started crying—happy tears. My parents thought something was wrong and instantly went into parent-protect mode, asking, ‘Are you okay?’ Of course, I was okay, and pretty quickly, we were all crying.”Before leaping to the NHL, Campbell worked in the AHL, where the demands of the job took a toll on her. “In this league, that’s a good thing, but it’s also taxing—physically, emotionally, and mentally,” Campbell said. “I never had much time to go home and see my family. Those windows were really small, and you learn to cherish the moments you do get.”Her transition from the AHL to the NHL happened almost overnight. “When I got the news, I was in Seattle at development camp, fully in my AHL role. Then, overnight, I went from being an AHL coach to an NHL coach,” she added.Also read: “Have to go the longer route”: First and only female NHL coach Jessica Campbell talks about her journey The journey hasn’t been easy, but Campbell’s historic rise is a testament to her dedication, resilience, and passion for the game.

IPL 2025: How will KKR, MI, CSK, SRH, RCB fare this season?

After being outclassed in their previous matches, title holders Kolkata Knight Riders and Rajasthan Royals are looking for a quick turnaround when they meet in an IPL match today (March 26).The Knight Riders lost to Royal Challengers Bengaluru by seven wickets in their opener, while the Royals suffered a 44-run defeat against Sunrisers Hyderabad.Both teams share a common issue: their once-impressive batting and bowling units have failed to perform. While the Royals might attribute their bowling struggles to playing at a difficult Hyderabad venue, the Knight Riders lack such an excuse.Except for Sunil Narine, none of the KKR bowlers managed to restrain the aggressive RCB lineup, raising concerns about the effectiveness of mystery spinner Varun Chakravarthy, who struggled significantly. Even on Eden Gardens' pitch, which had some grip, Chakravarthy was hit hard by Phil Salt and Virat Kohli.The KKR camp is hopeful that Chakravarthy will regain his form on a Guwahati pitch that typically offers more assistance to bowlers.The Barsapara Cricket Stadium in Guwahati has hosted four matches in IPL history - two in 2023 and two in 2024. The highest total at this ground came courtesy Rajasthan Royals who scored 199 against Delhi Capitals.

Take a bow @ShreyasIyer15 for showing class, leadership & aggression.” She also lauded other key contributors to PBKS' victory, including Shashank Singh, Marco Jansen, Arshdeep Singh , Vijaykumar Vyshak, and Priyansh Arya.Despite missing out on a century, Iyer’s knock earned him the Player of the Match award and the admiration of cricketing legends and fans alike. With PBKS off to a winning start, the team will look to build on this momentum as the IPL 2025 season progresses.Meanwhile, Preity Zinta, who has been associated with Punjab’s IPL franchise since 2008, is gearing up for her Bollywood comeback with Lahore 1947 after a seven-year hiatus.ALSO READ: Why Virat Kohli, MS Dhoni are facing criticism after Shreyas Iyer's selfless act in IPL 2025",Punjab kings captain shreyas iyer missed out on his maiden ipl century.

Outfielder Mickey Moniak makes a surprise exit from the Los Angeles Angels

“As we improve as an organization, which is obviously the goal, the decisions become tougher. I think that’s something we want every year.”

“We want difficult decisions every single year. That means your 40-man’s better, your depth’s better, that means you’re drafting the right players. From an international standpoint, you’re signing the right players.”

“He’s a good guy; he meant a lot to us, but again, there’s always competition, and there’s always the possibility of someone coming. This spring, it was Kyren Paris. We just feel like he deserves to be here and get an opportunity to run around in centerfield.”

Outfielder Mickey Moniak was shown the exit door by the Los Angeles Angels prior to the 2025 MLB season. The Angels former no. 1 overall pick diverted media attention after his unexpected exit paved the way for the left fielder Jo Adell to the center position on the roster lineup. With almost a day to the official opening day for the 2025 MLB season, the sudden exit of Moniak has even led to a significant reduction in his expected salary from the Angels.With the official opening day of the 2025 MLB season just around the corner, the shocking exit of talented outfielder Mickey Moniak from the Los Angeles Angels has created waves in the world of baseball. Reportedly, the Angels owe him only $484,000 from his signing amount of $2 million as he enters into free agency. During a recent interview with the MLB Network, the Los Angeles Angels manager, Perry Minasian , addressed the frequent roster changes in the team. He said-Minasian further explained-Manager Ron Washington even reacted to Moniak’s exit from the team. After their loss against the Los Angeles Dodgers, Washington reacted to his exit. He said-Kyren Paris is a multitalented athlete as he has appeared at multiple positions on the lineup, including base, center fielding, designated hitter, as well as a shortstop too. Reportedly, Paris would be assisting Jo Adell with respect to the center field for the 2025 MLB season after the exit of Mickey Moniak.",Outfielder mickey moniak was shown the exit door by the los angeles angels prior to the 2025 mlb season.

A fan breached security at the Barsapara Cricket Stadium in Guwahati during the IPL 2025 match between Rajasthan Royals and Kolkata Knight Riders on Tuesday. The young supporter ran onto the field to touch stand-in captain Riyan Parag 's feet while he was bowling.The incident occurred in the second innings as KKR were chasing 152 runs. The fan managed to reach Parag, touched his feet, and hugged him before security personnel intervened and removed him from the field.This match marked Parag's first appearance as IPL captain in his home state of Assam. He is leading RR for the initial three matches due to regular captain Sanju Samson's finger injury.Samson played in both this match and RR's season opener against Sunrisers Hyderabad, but only as a batter. The BCCI's Centre of Excellence cleared him for batting but advised against wicketkeeping, leading to his role as an Impact Player.This was the season's second pitch invasion incident. The first occurred at Eden Gardens during the KKR-Royal Challengers Bengaluru opener when a fan entered the field to meet Virat Kohli. That individual was arrested and banned from the stadium for the remainder of the season.The incident highlighted Parag's popularity in Assam, as he is the state's first IPL cricketer. Rajasthan Royals' decision to schedule two matches in Guwahati appears strategic, suggesting they view him as a potential successor to Samson.Parag's performance in the match was mixed. He scored a quick 25 runs off 15 balls batting at number three but fell to Varun Chakaravarthy at a crucial moment. His bowling figures were 25 runs from four overs without any wickets.Rajasthan Royals remain without a win in IPL 2025. Their next match is against Chennai Super Kings in Guwahati on March 30.",Rajasthan royals and kolkata knight riders played in guwahati on tuesday.
