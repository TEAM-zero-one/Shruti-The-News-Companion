Poll Will the experience of winning the T20 World Cup in 2024 impact Rohit's approach in the 2027 ODI World Cup? Yes, it will positively influence him No, past experiences do not matter It depends on the team's dynamics

NEW DELHI: In a stunning and deeply personal revelation, former India captain Rohit Sharma has admitted that he contemplated walking away from cricket altogether after India's crushing loss to Australia in the final of the 2023 ODI World Cup in Ahmedabad.Speaking at a Masters' Union event on Sunday, Rohit laid bare the emotional toll of the defeat, describing a period when the sport he loved felt like it had “taken everything” out of him.“After the 2023 World Cup final, I was completely distraught and felt like I didn't want to play this sport anymore because it had taken everything out of me and I felt I had nothing left,” Rohit said.India, under Rohit's leadership, had enjoyed a near-perfect campaign at home, storming into the final with ten straight wins. But in the match that mattered most, Australia executed their plans to perfection. After India were restricted to 240, Travis Head's match-winning century guided the Pat Cummins-led side to a six-wicket victory, leaving a stunned Narendra Modi Stadium in silence.Rohit said the pain was amplified by the sheer emotional investment he had made since taking over the captaincy in 2022.“Everybody was extremely disappointed, and we just couldn't believe what had happened. It was a very tough time for me personally because I had put everything into that World Cup — not just two or three months before it, but ever since I became captain.”The 38-year-old admitted it took months to recover mentally. “There was no energy left in my body. It took me a couple of months to recover and bring myself back,” he said, adding that self-reflection and a reminder of his love for the game helped him find his way back.That resilience would soon define the next chapter. Less than a year after the Ahmedabad heartbreak, Rohit led India to the T20 World Cup title in the USA and West Indies, a triumph he described as a lesson in resetting after disappointment.“I knew life doesn't end there. It was a big lesson — how to deal with disappointment, reset, and start fresh,” Rohit said. “It's very easy to say this now, but at that moment, it was extremely difficult.”Though he has since retired from Tests and T20Is and no longer captains the ODI side, Rohit continues in the 50-over format, with one final dream still driving him — a last shot at World Cup glory in 2027.",Former india captain rohit sharma admits he contemplated walking away from cricket after the 2023 odi world cup final defeat to australia. The 38-year-old led india to the t20 world cup title in the usa and west indies less than a year later.

Chiefs heiress Gracie Hunt says the 15-pound gain came from muscle, recovery, and long-term planning

Chiefs heiress Gracie Hunt shares structured workouts, consistency advice, and public appearance at AmericaFest 2025

Chiefs heiress Gracie Hunt is not playing into the optics game. She is controlling the message herself.Chiefs heiress Gracie Hunt shared a candid breakdown of her 2025 fitness journey on social media this week, openly revealing that she gained about 15 pounds over the past year. The admission was not framed as a setback. It was framed as progress. Hunt said the change came from intentional training, metabolic reset, and a shift away from appearance-driven goals.Chiefs heiress Gracie Hunt positioned the transformation as a long-term commitment to strength and sustainability. Her post focused on how her body performed, how her energy stabilized, and how patience replaced pressure.“My 2025 fitness goal was simple: become the strongest version of myself, inside and out,” she wrote.Chiefs heiress Gracie Hunt made it clear that the year was not about restarting or chasing fast results. She said her approach changed once she prioritized training with intention and respecting recovery.“This year wasn’t about starting over. It was about getting smarter. Training with intention, thinking long-term, and learning that strength, balance, and longevity matter more than chasing quick results. I learned that recovery isn’t optional, it’s part of the work.”Chiefs heiress Gracie Hunt later addressed the weight change directly and explained how it happened.ID@undefinedCaption not available.ID@undefinedCaption not available.ID@undefinedCaption not available.“I reset my metabolism, fueled my body on purpose, and slowly recomposed, adding about 15 lbs of muscle since I began this journey.”She added that she stopped centering progress around appearance. Instead, she focused on how her body felt day to day, when to push, and when to pause. Hunt said the result was steadier energy and sharper focus as the year progressed.The post was paired with workout clips and set to music by The Weeknd, reinforcing the message without changing its tone. Chiefs heiress Gracie Hunt closed the post by stating she ended the year stronger than she began it.Kansas City Chiefs owner Clark Hunt’s daughter, Gracie Hunt, shared moments from Turning Point USA’s AmericaFest 2025, held Thursday through Saturday at the Phoenix Convention Center in Phoenix. Dressed in a light beige jacket and flared pants with her hair worn down, Hunt reflected on the experience in an Instagram post, calling it a meaningful few days centered on faith, freedom, and gratitude for the country. WNBA player Sophie Cunningham reacted with fire emojis, prompting a warm exchange between the two in the comments.Earlier in the week, Chiefs heiress Gracie Hunt shared a separate post labeled “Training Tuesday,” showing an upper-body workout performed outdoors with dumbbells and a mat.“Upper body strength doesn’t have to be complicated. All you need is a set of dumbbells, a mat, and a commitment to show up,” she wrote.“Focus on controlled reps, strong posture, and breathing with intention,quality always beats quantity.”Chiefs heiress Gracie Hunt also advised followers to keep workouts simple and repeatable, especially on busy days. She encouraged starting small rather than skipping sessions entirely.Later that week, Chiefs heiress Gracie Hunt attended Turning Point USA’s AmericaFest in Phoenix. The event runs Dec. 18–21 at the Phoenix Convention Center and honors the legacy of Charlie Kirk, with programming led by his widow Erika Kirk. Hunt shared brief glimpses of the event on social media.While the Kansas City Chiefs continue to navigate an uneven close to the season under owner Clark Hunt, Chiefs heiress Gracie Hunt ended 2025 on her own terms. She defined success by strength gained, habits built, and consistency maintained.“Finishing the year stronger than I started, and remembering that growth never really ends.”In other news, with injuries sidelining early picks, the spotlight shifts to rookie cornerback Nohl Williams as the Kansas City Chiefs face the Tennessee Titans. The third-round pick out of California has played in 14 games, handled a steady workload, and shown reliability as a tackler, even as his coverage remains a work in progress. With Trent McDuffie ruled out and Jaylen Watson nearing free agency, this matchup gives Williams a real chance to log heavy snaps and prove he can handle a bigger role when the stakes are low but the evaluation is very real.","Chiefs heiress gracie hunt shared a candid breakdown of her 2025 fitness journey on social media.

Becky Lynch returns as faction tensions rise on RAW

How to watch WWE RAW live on December 22, 2025

December 22, 2025: Grand Rapids, Michigan, Van Andel Arena: WWE Monday Night RAW (Taped Holiday-week edition). As one of the final RAWs of the year, the show also helps WWE build towards Royal Rumble 2026. While championship alliances, faction rivalries, and surprise appearances have all helped shape the red brand in recent weeks, this episode is meant to serve as the bridge between premium live events in late 2022 and the turn of the new year.While taped earlier because of WWE's tour schedule, RAW will still broadcast in its standard Monday night timeslot, and there are plenty of storyline developments expected to take place. Fans can expect a well-balanced card, the freshest of top stars, and established rivalries that have a permanent wave of momentum through January.One of the highlight matches for the December 22 show is a big-time singles battle between two top women in WWE, Rhea Ripley vs. Asuka, which we could see having an impact on title and tag team angles moving forward. This is a match set to headline with Ripley continuing to cement herself as a top star on RAW, and Asuka's experience and unpredictability put her up against anyone.Also on the card, Bayley vs. Roxanne Perez, which is a great chance for Bayley to get her groove back and an even better way to test Perez against true top of the main roster competition. It will also feature Je’Von Evans vs. Rayo Americano, also part of WWE's pushing newer talent, along with the stars they already have.It is expected that the headline match will be a tag team contest with World Heavyweight Champion CM Punk and Rey Mysterio facing off against The Vision's Austin Theory and Bronson Reed. This match-up keeps Punk's unease with new generations of talent going while further establishing Theory's place as a major player on RAW.There is expected to be a heavy emphasis on storyline progression throughout the night. Close out the night with a segment that sees Becky Lynch return and confront a feud to add even more depth to the 2026 women's division. At the same time, the smoldering friction in Judgment Day and The Vision remains high, as both backstage promos and in-ring interactions are laying the seeds for future conflicts.Another angle to keep an eye on in WWE, of course, is whether or not the company is subtly switching allegiances and power players as Paul Heyman becomes involved with Austin Theory. The rise of Bron Breakker and Bronson Reed also means shakeups to the faction scene on RAW.WWE RAW airs live on Monday night via Netflix, continuing the platform’s role as RAW’s global streaming home. Broadcast times vary by region, with international viewers able to watch live or on demand depending on local availability.The final WWE RAW 2025 must end with a bang as compelling matches, returning superstars, and the progression of storylines will bring this year to a finish and lay the groundwork for the road to Royal Rumble.Also Read: Are Cooper DeJean and Nikki Bella dating?

Ravens brace for critical week as Jackson awaits MRI results

The Baltimore Ravens walked off the field Sunday night facing far more than a disappointing loss. Their 24–23 collapse against the New England Patriots was overshadowed by the early exit of quarterback Lamar Jackson, whose injury has put Baltimore’s fading playoff hopes in serious danger. Jackson left the game late in the second quarter after receiving a knee to his lower back on a short run.Jackson had been in top form before the injury, showing great efficiency and command in the game. His departure forced the Ravens to lean on backup Tyler Huntley. Baltimore briefly appeared to steady itself, even building a double-digit lead in the fourth quarter. That momentum, however, slipped away as the Patriots mounted a late comeback, leaving the Ravens stunned and sitting at 7–8.Head coach John Harbaugh offered limited clarity regarding Jackson’s condition after the game, saying, “It’s a bruise of some kind, I think. I don’t know how serious it will be. We’ll have to find out in the next couple of days. He got kneed in the back.” Jackson echoed the uncertainty, admitting he was in too much pain to return but hopes to play next week.The timing could not be worse, as Jackson is scheduled for an MRI on Monday, and the results will shape the Ravens’ entire approach heading into a must-win Week 17 matchup against the Green Bay Packers.At 9–5–1, Green Bay presents a tough challenge even with a healthy roster. Without Jackson, it will be a herculean task to secure a tight win.This injury adds to a long list of physical setbacks for Jackson this season, including missed games due to a hamstring issue and lingering problems with his ankle, toe, and knee. Despite those challenges, he has remained central to Baltimore’s identity and playoff hopes.Now, the Ravens must wait and prepare for what is next, critically assessing their strategy. Whether Jackson comes back or not, Baltimore’s postseason fate mostly hinges on the next few days. As the reputed team is in a tight spot and needs a big win, the QB’s return could be their only hope.Also read: ""John Harbaugh needs to be fired and Lamar Jackson traded"": Joe Burrow's ex-teammate tears into Ravens, calls for ruthless decisions","Lamar jackson suffered a knee to his lower back in the second quarter of sunday's game against the new england patriots.

Stephen Curry and Seth Curry followed different paths to the NBA spotlight. One became the face of a basketball revolution. The other built value through persistence and precision. Together, the Curry brothers represent two versions of success in the modern league. Their fortune extended over the years with contracts, endorsements, and long-term planning.Their combined net worth reflects more than family legacy. Of course, Stephen’s earnings dominate the total, but Seth’s steady climb also deserves attention. Here is the complete breakdown of the Curry brother’s combined net worth and more.Stephen Curry’s net worth is estimated at around $240 million (per Celebrity Net Worth). He built his fortune largely through record-setting NBA contracts and endorsement partnerships. Steph was drafted seventh overall by the Golden State Warriors in 2009.

He also claimed a gold medal at the 2024 Paris Olympics.Curry’s NBA salary alone has crossed $305 million across his first 15 seasons.In August 2024, he signed a one-year, $62.6 million deal. The deal made him the first NBA player to earn more than $60 million in a single season. He previously broke the $40 million and $50 million thresholds, setting financial benchmarks across the league.Off the court, Curry earns an estimated $30 to $40 million annually through endorsements. He had partnership with several brands including Under Armour, Nike, and TCL’s Palm brand. Over several peak years, his combined annual income reached as high as $95 million.Seth Curry’s net worth stands at roughly $18 million (per Celebrity Net Worth).

Taylor Swift was not seen at Nissan Stadium, and reports point to security planning

Kansas City’s Mahomes-less day got worse, but Travis Kelce hit a Jerry Rice milestone

Taylor Swift was not seen at Nissan Stadium for the Kansas City Chiefs’ Dec. 21 road game against the Tennessee Titans, a 26-9 loss that came without quarterback Patrick Mahomes, who is recovering from a torn ACL, per Yahoo.Her absence also fit the pattern that Elle reported this weekend: Swift has stuck to Chiefs home games this season, with multiple outlets citing security planning and venue familiarity as a major reason.Yahoo reported Swift “seemingly gave the Chiefs vs. Titans match a miss,” after attending Kansas City’s Dec. 14 home loss to the Los Angeles Chargers at Arrowhead Stadium. Yahoo also noted Swift “mainly attends Chiefs’ home games at Arrowhead Stadium,” and added there is “a possibility” she attends the Chiefs’ home game vs. the Denver Broncos on Christmas Day, citing USA Today.Elle went further on the away-game pattern and pointed to security concerns as the driving factor. It cited a Page Six source from October 2024: “She’s not going anywhere unless she knows the venue intimately, and it has been thoroughly scouted and secured in advance.” Elle also noted Swift has “been keeping a lower profile” even at home games, writing that she has not been photographed arriving and is rarely shown on broadcasts.Yahoo included another Page Six quote that framed the same idea around logistical comfort and advance scouting: “She has worked with Arrowhead so many times, they feel at ease and comfortable. Going to all kinds of different stadiums, you need to send a team in advance.” Yahoo also referenced concerns tied to Swift’s stalker, Brian Jason Wagner, as part of why she appears to prefer home games.Kelce, meanwhile, addressed effort and standards even with Kansas City eliminated from playoff contention, per Elle’s recap of “New Heights.” He said: “If we’re gonna go out there and play some football, we’re gonna do it the right way and, keep trying to get these things fixed and end on the highest note that we can.” He added: “All I’d know is to go out there and play my ass off and to show up and, you know, give my guys the best chance to win,” and, “I think that’s the mentality, man. There’s an integrity thing here.”Athlon Sports laid out how quickly the Chiefs’ situation shifted. Mahomes suffered a season-ending knee injury in the fourth quarter of a 16-13 loss to the Chargers, tearing his ACL and LCL, which ended Kansas City’s playoff hopes before the Titans game, per Athlon.Without Mahomes, Gardner Minshew started against Tennessee, then left after suffering an injury in the second quarter, per Athlon. That forced Chris Oladokun into action, and Athlon reported Oladokun’s first NFL completion went to Kelce on a 6-yard catch with 8:28 left in the second quarter.That one catch mattered. Athlon reported it pushed Kelce past 800 receiving yards for the season, giving him 12 straight seasons with 800-plus yards. Athlon also cited Chiefs on SI’s Zak Gilbert saying Kelce became the second player in NFL history to hit that 12-season streak, joining Jerry Rice.Kelce has already made it clear he does not want to coast to the finish line. Earlier this season, he said: “In terms of the historical stuff, I’m still looking at the next game and the next catch and trying to get better,” and, “I’m just the old, lucky dog still able to do this thing, man. I’m putting on the pads like I’m 15 years old again. I’m loving every single bit of it.” (Athlon)What comes next is simple. The Chiefs have two games left, starting with the Broncos at home on Christmas Day, followed by a Week 18 road game against the Las Vegas Raiders, per Athlon and Elle. If Swift shows up again, history says it will be Arrowhead, not a road tunnel. And if she doesn’t, the security question is still going to be the headline.","Taylor swift was not seen at nissan stadium during the chiefs’ dec. 21 loss to the titans.

NBA and FIBA plan a new pan-European league that supports domestic leagues and player development

The NBA and FIBA aim to launch a new European league that grows the game locally while expanding the NBA’s global reach

Today, the International Basketball Federation (FIBA) and the National Basketball Association ( NBA ) announced that they will continue their joint investigation of a new professional, pan-European men's basketball league in January by inviting potential teams and ownership groups to participate in the league's application process.In addition to permanent franchises, the proposed league ""would offer all teams from FIBA-affiliated national leagues in Europe a merit-based pathway to qualify each year,"" either through an end-of-season qualifying competition or FIBA's Basketball Champions League (BCL).In order to start interacting with and identifying European clubs and ownership groups for the establishment of a new pan-European professional basketball league, the NBA and FIBA have set a crucial deadline.In addition to permanent slots, the new league would provide every team in a domestic league in Europe connected with FIBA with a merit-based road to qualify annually through either an end-of-season qualifying event or FIBA's BCL. In order to enable players to represent their club and national team all year round, the league would also synchronize its timetable with those of domestic leagues and national teams.Additionally, both organizations stress that as part of the new league, they intend to provide resources and financial support to the ongoing growth of the European basketball ecosystem, which includes national leagues, club academies, and current NBA and FIBA programs that aim to develop aspiring players, coaches, and referees at all levels of the game.The proposed concept would incorporate the new league within the existing European basketball scene, with clubs competing in their own national leagues. The league would provide clubs with a merit-based route to qualification via the European basketball ecosystem in addition to permanent teams.FIBA Secretary General Andreas Zagklis said:“The progress of this joint NBA–FIBA project is very good news for the European basketball community.. T he format of the league respects European sport model principles by offering any ambitious club in the continent a fair pathway to the top. The project is conceived in a way that will improve the sustainability of the entire European basketball ecosystem, including players, clubs, leagues and national federations, by generating a knock-on effect that will strongly benefit basketball fans throughout Europe. ”In order to enable players to represent both their clubs and national teams, the season would also coincide with the current domestic league and national team calendars. Domestic leagues, club team academies, and initiatives to train players, coaches, and referees would all be covered by this cash.As part of the new league, the NBA and FIBA would also intend to devote funds and resources to the ongoing growth of Europe's basketball ecosystem, which includes club team academies, domestic leagues, and the NBA and FIBA's current initiatives to train future players, coaches, and referees at all levels of the sport.An NBA Europe league is NBA Commissioner Adam Silver's largest attempt to date to expand the NBA's global presence. The problem in Europe will be competing against the well-established EuroLeague, a league that has a long history and is very important to supporters.Talking about it, Silver said:“Our conversations with various stakeholders in Europe have reinforced our belief that an enormous opportunity exists around the creation of a new league on the continent.. Together with FIBA, we look forward to engaging prospective clubs and ownership groups that share our vision for the game’s potential in Europe.”In the upcoming months, the NBA and FIBA will release further information.Also read: Is Elden Campbell a Hall of Fame?

Why Darren Dreger believes Craig Berube is not on the hot seat yet

The Toronto Maple Leafs, Craig Berube, and potential coaching change rumors have turned into daily discussions as the frustration of the fans keeps escalating. The Maple Leafs' fall to last place in the Atlantic Division has drawn more attention to the team, not just through post-game reactions but a complete debate about the leadership, direction, and accountability as the season goes further off track.That tension has, of course, raised one uneasy question in the league: could Craig Berube be gone by Christmas? While the atmosphere in Toronto is heated, insider discussions imply that the situation might not be moving at the same pace as some fans are wishing for.Darren Dreger, NHL insider, while talking on TSN’s First Up, said that even though the team’s frustration is growing, the idea of a coaching change in Toronto being the immediate future is being overblown. Dreger, who is very much in the know of things going on, said that there is indeed some level of discontent within the organization, but he also made it clear that there was no indication during the early part of this week that the management was ready to make an abrupt or major decision concerning Craig Berube's future.Dreger also went on to comment on the rumors regarding a rift between Berube and Auston Matthews, labeling it as a case of exaggeration.He mentioned that there is a source who is close to Matthews, and according to that particular individual, the captain of the Leafs is respectful towards Berube and the rest of the staff. Dreger continued by saying that Berube's involvement in the most recent playoff run, which was the longest for the Leafs, still counts when judging whether a coaching change would actually help the problem.At this moment, Berube seems to be safe, but the patience in Toronto is notorious for its shortness. If the situation does not get better quickly, even the most thoughtful opinions may start to express doubts about his future in a much louder way.Also Read: Inside Connor McDavid’s luxury car collection: supercars, favorites, and what makes it unique",Nhl insider darren dreger believes craig berube is not on the hot seat yet.

Tristan Jarry's lower‑body injury sidelines Edmonton Oilers starter

The Edmonton Oilers received a tough blow as Tristan Jarry, their newly acquired starting goaltender, suffered a lower-body injury and will miss several weeks. Jarry, who was acquired from the Pittsburgh Penguins along with forward Samuel Poulin in a major trade, was expected to stabilize Edmonton’s net this season. His absence now forces the team to adjust quickly.The injury occurred during a recent NHL game when Jarry slid awkwardly across the crease and had to leave the ice. Head coach Kris Knoblauch confirmed that Jarry has been placed on injured reserve and will be sidelined until fully cleared. The decision ensures Jarry’s proper recovery but leaves the Oilers relying heavily on backup goaltenders in upcoming matches.The Oilers will have to rely on their backup goalies to handle the net in the next few NHL games since Jarry is out. Without their starting goalie, the team's defense and overall performance are under more pressure. Especially in important mid-season games. Both fans and analysts are keeping a close eye on how the team changes without Jarry.Since joining Edmonton, Jarry has had some good games and some bad ones. He needs to be more consistent overall. The team thought Jarry would immediately make their goaltending better, but the injury has put those hopes on hold.The Oilers are still hopeful that Jarry will get better, but they stress that he needs to do the right rehab to make sure he comes back at full strength. In the meantime, backup goalies will have to do the work, and the team's coaches will have to be careful about how they rotate players. As Jarry gets closer to a full return, the Oilers' official channels will keep fans up to date.Also Read: Net worth of Auston Matthews in 2025: Details on Toronto Maple Leafs captain's earnings, salary, and contracts",Tristan jarry suffered a lower-body injury during a recent nhl game.

Vegas Golden Knights know how to build a Stanley Cup-winning roster



Also Read:

Jack Eichel entered the 2025-26 season as one of the biggest names potentially heading to unrestricted free agency. He didn't stay on the market long. The Vegas Golden Knights soon re-signed their star center on an eight-year, $108 million contract extension.The contract also includes a full no-movement clause to make sure their best player remains in Vegas. Meanwhile, for Eichel, this wasn’t a tough decision to make. He had already lifted the Stanley Cup with Vegas, and their acquisition of Mitch Marner back in the summer proves that the franchise is just as serious as him when it comes to their championship dreams.Vegas pulled off arguably its greatest coup when it executed a sign-and-trade for Marner, removing the league's top free agent from the market before he could field any other offers. Eichel was effusive with his praise for the move and what it meant for his future.""He's a world-class hockey player. He's one of the smartest players in our league,” Eichel explained. The Marner deal wasn't just about adding talent. However, for Eichel, getting Marner wasn’t just about acquiring another big name. It was also proof of the Golden Knights’ commitment to win another Stanley CupThat was something that connected with Eichel, as he stated, ""Beyond the term, dollars, or specific clauses in my contract, it's the franchise's bold moves like landing Marner that made signing an easy decision.”For a player of his caliber, it is reassuring when the team he plays with is just as serious as him about winning the title.They've added players like Tomas Hertl and Noah Hanifin, and now Marner. That willingness to do whatever it takes to compete for championships is exactly what Eichel wants. He continued, ""It's an organization that wants to win the Stanley Cup every year. As a player, that's all you can ask for. “Eichel also knows that Vegas is giving their all to win the title once again. He continued, “ We know they're going to do what's necessary to give us a chance to win, and it's what I want to do. Continue to push to win another Stanley Cup here in Vegas. It was a huge part of my decision.""Eichel, meanwhile, continues to spearhead Vegas’ offense. Since his debut as a Golden Knight on February 16, 2022, he's been among the NHL 's leading scorers with 100 goals and 253 points. He helped Vegas win a Stanley Cup and posted a playoff-best 26 points during that championship run.Last season, Eichel posted a career-best 94 points and finished eighth in NHL scoring while earning top-five finishes for the Hart, Selke, and Lady Byng trophies. When asked about signing the extension, Eichel made his feelings clear.""I said all along I wanted to be here, playing for the Vegas Golden Knights. Really happy to get it done. So happy to continue my career here in Vegas,"" Eichel said. The Golden Knights get to keep one of the NHL's elite centers locked up through his mid-30s, and Eichel gets to play for an organization that will do whatever it takes to win.","Jack eichel re-signed with the vegas golden knights on an eight-year, $108 million contract extension.

Will Ricky Pearsall play against the Indianapolis Colts tonight?

How and when to watch the 49ers vs. Colts Monday Night Football game

The San Francisco 49ers are rolling at the right time. A Week 15 win over the Tennessee Titans pushed them to 10-4 and kept the NFC West race alive heading into Monday Night Football. But as San Francisco prepares to face the Indianapolis Colts on the road, attention has shifted away from playoff math and toward availability.Ricky Pearsall was one of the biggest reasons the 49ers offense looked sharp last week. Now, just days later, his status has become a central question as Kyle Shanahan’s team looks to extend its winning streak without disrupting offensive rhythm.No, Ricky Pearsall will not play against the Colts. The 49ers ruled the wide receiver out after he missed the entire practice week with knee and ankle injuries suffered during Sunday’s win over Tennessee.Head coach Kyle Shanahan confirmed the decision Saturday, saying Pearsall got “close, but not close enough” to being cleared. Because he was unable to practice at all, the team opted to hold him out and keep him in San Francisco to continue rehabbing rather than traveling to Indianapolis.The timing stings. Pearsall is coming off his most productive game of the season, catching six passes for a game-high 96 yards from Brock Purdy in the 37-24 victory over the Titans.Through eight games this season, the former first-round pick has totaled 31 receptions for 443 yards and is still searching for his first touchdown.With Pearsall sidelined, Kendrick Bourne and Demarcus Robinson are expected to see expanded roles in the receiving rotation. San Francisco will lean on its depth as it takes the field at Lucas Oil Stadium for an 8:15 p.m. ET kickoff, knowing it will have to adjust on the fly without one of its most efficient targets from a week ago.The San Francisco 49ers and Indianapolis Colts will face off on Monday, Dec. 22, at Lucas Oil Stadium in Indianapolis. Kickoff is scheduled for 8:15 p.m. ET.The game will air nationally on ESPN and ABC as part of Monday Night Football.

Why limited cap space remains biggest obstacle to Hughes brothers' reunion at New Jersey Devils,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/why-limited-cap-space-remains-biggest-obstacle-to-hughes-brothers-reunion-at-new-jersey-devils/articleshow/126123735.cms,"New Jersey Devils in the latest season

New Jersey Devils don’t have the cap space to acquire Quinn Hughes

NHL Highlights | Sabres vs. Devils - December 21, 2025

The New Jersey Devils have Jack and Luke Hughes. That's already a luxury most teams can't afford. Adding Quinn Hughes to complete the set would be a dream scenario for fans and a nightmare for the front office trying to build a championship roster under the salary cap.The math simply doesn't work. Jack Hughes carries an $8 million cap hit through the 2029-30 season. Luke just signed a seven-year extension worth $9 million per season. That's $17 million committed to two players before you even start thinking about adding their older brother.For context, that's already more than 20 percent of the salary cap tied up in two forwards who play the same position. Building a contender means spreading money across four lines, three defensive pairs, two goaltenders, and enough depth to survive injuries. The Devils are already working with reduced flexibility.When Quinn signs his next contract, whether it's with Minnesota or another team, he'll be looking at annual compensation in the $15 million to $18 million range. He's one of the best defensemen in the NHL and will be paid accordingly.Add that to the $17 million already committed to Jack and Luke, and the Devils would have over $30 million tied up in three players.That's more than a third of the salary cap devoted to the Hughes family. For New Jersey to even consider adding Quinn, they'd need to move a significant salary elsewhere.That means trading quality players with value, not just dumping bad contracts. To make the cap work, the Devils would have to give up roster depth and possibly mortgage their future. Even yet, you are left with a squad that is dominated by the best players and lacks the supporting cast necessary to contend for a Stanley Cup.Championship teams are built on depth, not star power alone. There's another complication beyond the cap. Luke Hughes is developing into the Devils' number one defenseman and power-play quarterback. Adding Quinn would disrupt that development and force one of them into a reduced role.Quinn reportedly doesn't want to interfere with Luke's growth, which makes sense from a family perspective, even if it disappoints fans hoping for a reunion. The idea of all three Hughes brothers playing together in New Jersey is appealing on an emotional level.But the salary cap is designed specifically to prevent teams from stockpiling elite talent, and $30-plus million for three players violates every principle of smart roster construction. Limited cap space isn't just an obstacle. It's the wall that makes a Hughes family reunion in New Jersey nearly impossible.",New jersey devils don't have the cap space to acquire quinn hughes.

Auston Matthews and the pressure point Toronto cannot ignore

The mood around the Maple Leafs has shifted from confidence to caution. Toronto entered the season expecting its captain to set the pace, yet nights now pass where the scoreboard stays silent for stretches that feel unfamiliar. Auston Matthews still generates chances, still competes hard in all three zones, but goals no longer arrive with the same inevitability. In a market that measures greatness shift by shift, that absence has grown louder than any cheer.What makes this moment heavier is timing. Toronto is not rebuilding or experimenting. This is a team built to win now. When production stalls at the center of that plan, anxiety spreads quickly. Conversations that once felt unthinkable are now whispered openly, not because Matthews has fallen off, but because expectations around him remain sky high.The tension spiked when Maple Leafs reporter Howard Berger suggested the organization will not move forward until Auston Matthews asks for a trade, possibly by this year’s trade deadline. That idea alone rattled the fanbase. Matthews has been the franchise constant for nearly a decade.Imagining Toronto without him feels like pulling a load-bearing wall from the house.On the ice, the frustration has roots. Auston Matthews continues to win faceoffs, backcheck, and handle defensive responsibility. Yet Toronto pays him to swing games offensively. At five-on-five, his line has not consistently owned shifts. On the power play, the dominance that once felt automatic has faded into predictability. The looks are there, but the finish has gone missing.That gap between effort and outcome feeds scrutiny. In Toronto, leadership is judged through goals when the stakes rise. When scoring dries up, every shift becomes a test of authority and legacy. Nick Kypreos tried to strike a more hopeful tone in the Toronto Star, but optimism struggles to breathe when results lag behind reputation.The coaching staff has searched for answers. Different wingers, altered looks, and tactical tweaks have come and gone. The puck still moves well, but the instinctive scoring touch that defined Matthews has not returned with consistency. There is also quiet talk of tension with coach Craig Berube, another layer that complicates an already delicate situation.Trading a captain in his prime is not standard practice. Neither is standing still while doubt grows inside a contender. Toronto management now faces a narrow path where action and inaction both carry consequences. Whether Berger’s report proves prophetic or premature, it captures how fragile this stretch feels.Matthews remains elite. Yet in this market, elite alone no longer settles the noise. The next few months will decide more than standings. They will define how this era is remembered, and whether Auston Matthews and Toronto find clarity together or part under pressure. Maple Lead's season has not been up to their mark and there will be few shake-up in near future.Also Read: Are Auston Matthews and Craig Berube drifting apart as Maple Leafs struggles spark tense locker-room speculation?","The mood around the maple leafs has shifted from confidence to caution.

Toronto Maple Leafs slump raises questions beyond effort

The Toronto Maple Leafs walked out of Nashville with another loss on Saturday, and this one felt heavier than the scoreline. A 5–3 defeat to the Predators pushed Toronto deeper into a troubling slide and left the standings offering little comfort. The Leafs showed life early, played with more order, and even held two separate leads. Yet when the game demanded resolve, the answers did not come.Losses pile up quickly in this league, but context matters. Toronto needed points, not moral victories. Instead, the night ended with empty hands, lingering frustration, and a schedule that offers no mercy. Sitting last in the Atlantic Division, the Leafs now face a Dallas team rolling through the league, less than a day after another gut punch.Amid the noise, captain Auston Matthews chose calm over panic. He spoke openly about the group’s mindset and insisted the foundation remains intact.""I think mentally we're fine. I thought tonight, as shitty as it is losing, I thought the process was better. I thought we had good energy all night. And even though you're leaving the rink upset, not getting out [with] any points in tonight's game, I think just the process that we had throughout is something that we can take and move forward.""Matthews pointed to sharper communication, quicker puck movement, and a stronger commitment to defensive structure as signs the team is inching forward.“Even though you are leaving the rink upset about not getting any points from the game,” Matthews said, “the process we had throughout is something we can take and move forward with, knowing some of the good things we did and trying to channel that throughout a full 60 [minutes].”That optimism clashes with the numbers. Nashville outshot Toronto 34–22, and the Leafs managed just 14 shots through two periods. When Steven Stamkos sealed it with an empty-net goal, the margin felt wider than the scoreboard suggested. Bobby McMann’s late tally offered brief hope, but the response came too late.Matthews also faced his own struggles head-on, acknowledging a scoreless road trip and a difficult minus rating.“It’s never easy, it’s never fun,” Matthews said. “You just got to mentally grind through it.

Bryan Rust admits he has no answers as Penguins losing streak deepens

The Pittsburgh Penguins are stuck in a spiral that feels heavier with each passing night. What once looked like an early-season surprise has quickly turned into a grinding reality. Losses have piled up, confidence has slipped, and the margin for error has disappeared. The Penguins are not just losing games. They are searching for traction in a season that has suddenly tilted against them.Saturday’s 4-0 defeat to the Montreal Canadiens only deepened the unease. Eight straight losses have erased the optimism built during a stronger-than-expected start. The standings now tell a harsher story, with Pittsburgh sitting second from last in the Metropolitan Division. Inside the room, frustration is no longer hidden, and even the most experienced voices are struggling to make sense of what is happening.Veteran forward Bryan Rust did not try to soften the moment after the shutout loss. His words reflected the mood of a team searching for clarity but finding none.""I don't have any explanation. As far as tonight goes, obviously we'd like our special teams to be better. We had a lot of chances five on five that we didn't score on.""Rust’s honesty matters because he has lived through winning seasons and difficult stretches in Pittsburgh. This time feels different. The Penguins are creating chances at even strength, yet results refuse to follow. Power plays fail to spark momentum. Small mistakes snowball. Games slip away before they ever feel within reach.Still, Rust pointed to effort as something the team can build on, even if patience is wearing thin.""It's never going to be easy. We have to work our way out of it. Today was a lot better than in Ottawa. But obviously we need to get wins here.""Those wins have become urgent, not just for the standings but for the direction of the season. As losses mount, familiar questions return. Rust’s name, once again, is quietly circulating in trade chatter. Over the summer, Pittsburgh explored moving him and Rickard Rakell, but no deal materialized. Both stayed, and expectations followed.If the slide continues, that conversation may grow louder. Bryan Rust remains a respected presence, a proven playoff performer, and a player contenders value. For now, though, he is focused on stopping the bleeding. The Penguins need answers soon. Even their veterans admit they are still searching for them.Also Read: Maple Leafs fans on edge as insiders question whether the Auston Matthews window is finally closing",Pittsburgh penguins lost 4-0 to montreal canadiens on saturday.
