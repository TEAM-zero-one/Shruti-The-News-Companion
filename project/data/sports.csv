Fernandes, older and with a longer global profile, boasts a higher net worth and lucrative endorsements. Ødegaard, though earning less, has performance-based incentives in his deal. Both are among England's highest-paid midfielders.

Bruno Fernandes vs. Martin Ødegaard: Financial differences

Earnings hierarchy

Casemiro (Manchester United): £350,000/week (~$470,000 Bruno Fernandes (Manchester United): £300,000/week (~$400,000) Bernardo Silva (Manchester City): £300,000/week (~$400,000) Kai Havertz (Arsenal): £280,000/week (~$370,000) Martin Ødegaard / Declan Rice (Arsenal): £240,000/week (~$320,000)





Bruno Fernandes and Martin Ødegaard are two names that are ruling the Premier League midfield. They both serve as captains for their teams - Manchester United for Fernandes and Arsenal for Ødegaard. And both have a strong fanbase when it comes to their talent and charisma both on and off the field. To understand where these two sit in the hierarchy of Premier League superstars, let's compare these two defining creative forces of this era.At 31, Bruno Fernandes is in the ""prime veteran"" stage of his career, allowing him to negotiate a higher base salary during his 2024 renewal. Martin Ødegaard, being 27, is on a high-value long-term deal signed in late 2023. While Ødegaard’s earning is lower, his contract has multiple add-ons with heavier incentives related to Arsenal’s recent title charges and Champions League qualification.Bruno Fernandes holds a slight edge in net worth due to his longer career span at the top of the global game and his status as a national icon for Portugal, alongside Cristiano Ronaldo. This has granted him access to lucrative global endorsements, like Nike and Gillette, that Martin Ødegaard is only now beginning to match. With his international profile with the Norway national team growing, the latter is making up for the late entry to the game.Bruno Fernandes is known for a conservative but high-value property portfolio in Lisbon, Manchester, and the Algarve. His investments are geared toward post-career stability in mind. Ødegaard, on the other hand, has focused heavily on tech investments and sports startups in Scandinavia, reflecting a younger generation’s approach to wealth management.In the current 2025/26 landscape, Bruno Fernandes and Martin Ødegaard remain two of the highest-paid midfielders in England. Here is how the top bracket looks:Both midfielders try to bring their best game in every match, and are two of the biggest names in the current English Premier League. Fernandes's net worth at current is around £50 million (~$63.5 million), while Ødegaard has accumulated a fortune worth of £20-25 million (~$25 - $35 million).Also Read: Bruno Fernandes and Ana Pinho Combined Net Worth in 2025: Manchester United career, salary, investments and more","Premier league captains bruno fernandes and martin ødegaard are top midfielders, commanding significant salaries and fan bases.

Andy Lee’s investments, career, and net worth of the boxer-coach duo





Joseph Parker and Andy Lee represent a boxing victory that still attracts fans. Wise investments and brand deals are also factors of their financial trajectory apart from boxing careers. The former WBO heavyweight champion, Parker, still brings in millions from fights and endorsements while the retired WBO middleweight champion, Lee, maintains his fortune through coaching, commentary, and making good financial choices.Joseph Parker has made a property investment and lives a nice lifestyle in New Zealand, where he manages family life and boxing training at the same time. Lee’s living comparatively and modestly is still an ongoing process that comes from Parker’s competition with him, and that is the reason he can still mentor others.Parker’s comeback victories over Deontay Wilder and Zhilei Zhang have also increased his fight purses. The reports say that he gets $1.5 million for each fight. Parker's financial status is probably to be significantly enhanced, though, as Wardley and Dubois are going to create difficult fights, earning him more money apart from his fight purses.Apart from this, he gets a cut from the pay-per-view revenues besides his fight purses and has endorsement contracts that steadily reinforce his position as one of the richest heavyweight boxers in this era.His sponsorships and public appearances are also contributing to his financial security. It is very easy to approach him, and he also keeps it simple. Parker is sometimes overtly issues his Samoan background and connections to the community.Lee’s career highlights are winning the WBO title in 2014 against Matt Korobov plus a record of 35 wins, 24 by knockout. After retiring, he began to coach and do television commentary, training boxers like Tyson Fury and participating in the boxing world, which still earns him money. Lee focuses on the coaching and commentary side of the sport, thus making sure that the income after retirement is not so unstable.Parker and Lee together will have a combined net worth of $25-$37 million in 2025, which proves that their relevance in the boxing world as well as in other fields has been continuous and strong.Also Read: Joseph parker net worth in 2025: Boxing career, earnings, endorsements, lifestyle and more","Former wbo heavyweight champion, parker, still brings in millions from fights and endorsements.

5. Fred VanVleet injury troubles







With the NBA’s expansion, every game demands more from players on the hardwood. From fancier dunks to “swish” threes, the league’s requirement from its stars is at an all-time high. The sport of basketball is one of the world’s fastest in the world, and along with its breakneck speed, it is physically taxing on the players. The constant matches with no time to rest and reenergize have increased the risks of injuries.With 2025 ending, a lot of injuries were reported that reshaped the championship landscape in the NBA.From heartbreaking Achilles tears in the Finals to the ongoing maintenance of the league's most dominant big men, health has become the ultimate X-factor for the 2025-26 season.After leading the Indiana Pacers to a historic Game 7 in the NBA Finals, Tyrese Haliburton suffered a torn Achilles tendon in the summer of 2025 that has sidelined him for this entire season. With their star player injured, the Indiana Pacers were forced into a development and survival mode, leaning heavily on Bennedict Mathurin while their title window stays frustratingly closed for a year.Nuggets announced on 30th December 2025, that the MVP contender is out for at least four weeks after suffering a left knee hyperextension in a matchup against Miami.For the Denver Nuggets, Jokić isn't just a player, he is their core system, and his absence puts immense pressure on Jamal Murray and Aaron Gordon on the offensive side. With the Western Conference filled with heavyweights, this 4-week stretch turns the tables for the worse.The dunking star suffered an ankle sprain back in October and then another ankle sprain in December. These repetitive injuries could potentially become a stumbling block for the Grizzlies during the playoffs. Memphis remains a contender only when Morant is on the floor, and this constant uncertainty gives a shaky foundation for their championship dream.The Dallas Mavericks have spent most of 2025 trying to fill in the gap left by their superstar point guard, Kyrie Irving, who sustained a torn left ACL in early March against the Kings. Irving’s injury abruptly ended his 2024-25 campaign and forced the Mavericks into a difficult spot. Despite the arrival of Anthony Davis and the rookie sensation Cooper Flagg, the team has struggled in clutch situations without Irving’s elite shot-making.With Kevin Durant's addition to the team, Rockets are currently Houston to a top-four standing. But without their key two-way player, Fred VanVleet, who suffered an ACL injury in September, the Rockets are missing their vital component. VanVleet’s influence on the team’s culture is commendable, and his loss was a significant hit to the team. The 2019 NBA champion’s absence forces young stars like Amen Thompson into high-pressure roles.Also read: Is Nikola Jokic’s NBA MVP bid slipping away as knee injury lingers for Denver Nuggets star?","With 2025 ending, a lot of injuries were reported that reshaped the championship landscape in the nba.

Why Victor Wembanyama’s Availability Matters for the San Antonio Spurs (December 31, 2025)





on Tuesday night. He is not listed on the injury report for the Spurs’ December 31 game against the New York Knicks, confirming his availability for the New Year’s Eve matchup.The timing matters. This game is a rematch of the NBA Cup Final, and San Antonio enters it dealing with injuries elsewhere on the roster. With key teammates sidelined or uncertain, Wembanyama’s presence carries added importance for a Spurs team trying to finish the year on a strong note.Victor Wembanyama comes into the game healthy after playing heavy minutes in a recent loss to Cleveland. In that outing, he scored 26 points, grabbed 14 rebounds, and added three assists. There were no issues afterward, and the Spurs cleared him without restriction.Through the season, Wembanyama is averaging 24.0 points, 11.7 rebounds, and 3.0 blocks per game. His production places him among the league’s top performers, often mentioned in the same conversations as Nikola Jokić. Against New York, much of the focus will be on his work on the glass, where he has consistently cleared double-digit rebounds.San Antonio will be short-handed. Devin Vassell remains out with a right adductor strain and is not expected to return until early January.His absence removes a reliable scorer and perimeter defender from the lineup.Stephon Castle is listed as questionable due to a left thumb sprain. The former Rookie of the Year has played a key role this season, and his status will likely be decided closer to tip-off. Aside from those two, no other major Spurs players are dealing with confirmed injuries.Tuesday’s game revisits the NBA Cup Final, a result the Spurs have not moved past. Wembanyama has already said the team “owes” the Knicks one after that loss, making this matchup more than just another regular-season game.From a basketball standpoint, analysts expect San Antonio to lean heavily on Wembanyama at both ends. His size and reach present problems for New York, while the Knicks will look for contributions from role players such as Miles McBride to counter his impact.When Wembanyama is on the floor, defenses adjust. He draws attention in the paint, creates space for teammates, and protects the rim. In the earlier meeting with New York, he delivered several momentum-shifting plays, including a powerful finish inside.Also read: Is Josh Hart playing tonight vs the San Antonio Spurs?

Jarred Kelenic joins Chicago White Sox on minor league deal





Jarred Kelenic is getting another chance to stay in Major League Baseball. On Monday, in early 2026, the 26-year-old outfielder signed a minor league contract with the Chicago White Sox, according to ESPN. The deal includes an invitation to major league spring training in Arizona. For Jarred Kelenic, this move is about one thing, finding a way back to regular MLB playing time.Once seen as a future star, Jarred Kelenic has spent the last few seasons fighting inconsistency. The White Sox offer him a new place, a new staff, and a clear chance to compete. With Chicago still reshaping its roster, this signing gives both sides something to gain.Jarred Kelenic was drafted sixth overall in the 2018 MLB Draft by the New York Mets. At that time, he was one of the most talked-about young players in baseball.By December 2018, the Mets traded him to the Seattle Mariners in a major deal that brought Robinson Canó and Edwin Díaz to New York.Jarred Kelenic made his MLB debut in May 2021 with Seattle, playing as a left-handed hitting outfielder known for speed and defense.However, his bat never stayed hot for long. Across five MLB seasons, he posted a .211 batting average, with a high strikeout rate of over 30 percent, according to MLB.com data.His best stretch came in 2023, when he hit .253 with 11 home runs and 49 RBIs in 105 games for Seattle.That season took a sharp turn in July 2023, when he broke his left foot after kicking a water cooler in frustration.Speaking to reporters in Seattle after the injury, Jarred Kelenic said, “I let emotions get the best of me. I take full responsibility. It can’t happen.”Seattle traded Jarred Kelenic to the Atlanta Braves before the 2024 season. He became Atlanta’s everyday center fielder and hit a career-high 15 home runs, but strikeouts remained an issue.In 2025, his season unraveled fast. He hit .167 in 24 games and was publicly criticized by Ronald Acuña Jr. for lack of hustle during a game in Atlanta.Now in Chicago, Jarred Kelenic joins a White Sox team that has stayed active this offseason. The club recently added Anthony Kay and Japanese slugger Munetaka Murakami.With the White Sox reportedly listening to trade offers for Luis Robert Jr., there may be a path for outfield playing time if Jarred Kelenic performs well in spring training.For now, this deal is small on paper. But for Jarred Kelenic, it is a critical step to keep his MLB career alive.Also Read: MLB Trade Rumors: Detroit Tigers Eye Alex Bregman Cautiously As Pittsburgh Pirates Predict Strong Push For Kazuma Okamoto","Jarred kelenic signed a minor league contract with the chicago white sox on monday.

as he recovers from a right Achilles tendon rupture suffered during the 2025 playoffs. As December 2025 ends, the team has not set a return date. Boston is focused on getting him fully healthy rather than pushing for an early comeback.The Celtics have stayed consistent in their approach. Even with the team holding its ground in the standings, Tatum continues to be listed as out on injury reports. Clearance will only come once the medical staff is fully satisfied with his recovery.Tatum tore his Achilles in Game 4 of the Eastern Conference Semifinals against the New York Knicks last spring. The injury ended his postseason immediately and changed the direction of the series. Boston went on to lose in six games, closing the season earlier than expected.He underwent surgery on May 13, 2025. For players at his level, Achilles recovery usually takes nine to twelve months, which made it clear early on that his return would likely come deep into the 2025-26 season, if at all.Jayson Tatum’s rehab has moved forward without setbacks. He returned to on-court workouts by late September and was dunking again by October.By December, people around the team said he wants to play this season and has been fully committed to the process.That progress has not changed Boston’s stance. The Celtics reportedly sought opinions from multiple doctors and have continued to rule him out for games, including late-December matchups. The message has been steady: no shortcuts.Head coach Joe Mazzulla and team president Brad Stevens have both stressed patience. With Boston Celtics posting a strong record without Tatum, there is no urgency to take risks. Some around the league expect a possible late-season return if conditions are right, while others believe he may sit out the entire year.Tatum has echoed that thinking, saying he feels no pressure to rush and wants to return only when he is fully ready.Jaylen Brown has taken on a larger scoring role and led the offense with consistency. Derrick White and the rest of the rotation have filled gaps on both ends, keeping Boston near the top of the Eastern Conference.The team has stayed competitive without its star.

What is going on with Auston Matthews?

Auston Matthews' injury update for Maple Leafs' next games







Toronto Maple Leafs captain Auston Matthews is hospitalized and deemed day-to-day due to a lower-body injury that he got in the overtime defeat against the Detroit Red Wings on Sunday. Matthews, who blocked a shot in the second period, spent only a minute off the ice before coming back to complete the game. Nevertheless, there was an effort, and the team confirmed that he will not be playing on Tuesday in the home game against the New Jersey Devils.The Maple Leafs have already suffered a trail of injuries. Defenseman Chris Tanev is still out with a lower-body problem, and it is his second absence of the season of at least 23 games since he was out with an upper-body injury previously. Centre Dakota Joshua is also out as he undergoes treatment for a kidney trauma against the Red Wings.Toronto had Matt Benning and Jacob Quillan from the Toronto Marlies of the AHL to fill the gaps in the lineup. Quillan has been among the best performers of the Marlies this season, as he has been the leading scorer of the team, besides demonstrating consistent defensive performance. Benning is a veteran who has played in more than 460 NHL games and will be a good depth player on the blue line.This season, Matthews, 27, has been credited with 15 goals and 12 assists in 33 games, and is second in the Maple Leafs in goals and faceoff wins and fourth in points with 27. His absence is a big blow to the Toronto team, who are still in last position in the Atlantic Division but only four points behind a playoff position as they face off a difficult run of games.Also Read: Net worth of Auston Matthews in 2025: Details on Vegas Golden Knights captain's earnings, salary, and contracts","Toronto maple leafs captain auston matthews is hospitalized and deemed day-to-day due to a lower-body injury that he got in the overtime defeat against the detroit red wings on sunday.

Chris Tanev out for Toronto Maple Leafs' next game and what it means for the team







The hopes of the Toronto Maple Leafs to have a healthy roster have been struck again. Another setback to Toronto will be the absence of defenceman Chris Tanev in the next game because of a lower-body injury, which will further hurt their quest to rise up the Atlantic Division ladder. Tanev is one of the most important shutdown defenders. Hence, his absence is especially frightening since he had missed an earlier 23 games of the current season due to an upper-body problem.Tanev is infectious on the ice, as the teammates and even the analysts of the team refer to his presence on the ice due to his leadership, positioning, and dependability during critical situations.Chris Tanev, the central shutdown defenceman of the Toronto Maple Leafs, is injured with a lower-body injury and is a game-time decision, which leaves a major defensive void. Auston Matthews, the team captain, is also a game-time decision, having suffered a lower-body injury in the overtime defeat to the Detroit Red Wings on Sunday.

He has been a promising prospect in the AHL this season, scoring 23 points in 26 games.The estimated team of Toronto will consist of both more experienced and younger players, where Tanev will most likely be missed on defence.

Rumors of a Tyreek Hill trade

After his close friend and former teammate Tyreek Hill was hurt badly, Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes spoke out. This shocking event sent shockwaves through the NFL on Monday night.During their Week 17 game against the New York Jets, Hill, who now plays for the Miami Dolphins, was taken off the field on a cart after what seemed like a serious injury to his lower leg. In the third quarter, Hill caught a ball and then put his foot down in a weird fashion. Replays indicated that his leg was bending in a weird way, which made teammates, fans, and doctors all worry straight away.Mahomes quickly turned to social media to show his support. ""Prayers up man 🙏🙏,"" the Chiefs quarterback posted on X. It was a short but heartfelt statement that instantly went viral.During their tenure with the Kansas City Chiefs, Mahomes and Hill had some of the best seasons of their careers together. They were one of the league's most explosive quarterback-receiver pairs. The two were key players in Kansas City's Super Bowl-winning season in 2019. Hill's quickness and Mahomes' arm changed the way modern NFL offenses work.In 2022, Hill left Kansas City in a big deal, but the two stars have stayed close. Hill has called Mahomes a ""brother"" many times, saying that he pushes his teammates and sets high standards in the locker room.That history made Mahomes' reaction even more important as Hill lay hurt on the field.It hasn't been officially confirmed how bad Hill's injury is, but early signs point to it being a serious setback that could finish his season. There had already been rumors about Hill's future in Miami, with reports saying he was frustrated with the Dolphins' problems and there were worries about the direction of the roster.It looks like any notion of a reunion with Kansas City is on wait for now. Hill, who will be 31 next year, has a big cap cost for the 2026 season, and a long rehab process might make things much harder for Miami's front management to decide what to do.Before leaving the game, Hill caught six passes for 67 yards, which was one of his better games in a season that has been tough for the Dolphins.It's still not known when Mahomes will be back, but his message to Hill showed how deeply personal events can break through professional rivalries and club loyalties.","Kansas city chiefs quarterback patrick mahomes posted a heartfelt message to former teammate tyreek hill.

Lamar Jackson’s injury status ahead of Week 18

How Lamar Jackson's return affects the Ravens vs. Steelers game

Also Read:





The Baltimore Ravens’ heading into Week 18 a major question arises: will Lamar Jackson be available for the final clash against the Pittsburgh Steelers? With the AFC North title on the line, Jackson’s status has become the defining storyline of the final week of the regular season.Jackson missed Baltimore’s Week 17 game against the Green Bay Packers after suffering a painful back injury in Week 16. While the Ravens managed to win without him, the absence of their franchise quarterback raised immediate concerns about his availability for the most important game of the season.According to Ian Rapoport of NFL Network, there is renewed optimism. Rapoport reported that Jackson is expected to practice midweek, a significant step forward after he was unable to participate at all last week. If confirmed, it would mark Jackson’s first on-field work since the injury occurred.Jackson's involvement in practice doesn't mean he'll be available, but it does strongly suggest that he's going in the right direction.John Harbaugh, the head coach of the Ravens, has said that the team will not rush Jackson back until he is completely ready. Internally, the injury has been called ""painful,"" and Baltimore is putting long-term health ahead of short-term goals.If Jackson is cleared, it would make things a lot easier for Baltimore. The two-time MVP has a level of explosiveness and playmaking that no backup can match, especially when playing against a division foe on the road.The Ravens have played it safe on offense since Jackson left. That method works well sometimes, but it might not be enough against a Steelers defense that does well when there is pressure and turnovers. In a close, low-scoring game, Jackson's ability to move around and make plays could be the difference.Jackson's possible comeback makes things harder for the Steelers. Not only would defensive game plans have to change because of his arm, but also because of his legs. This would force Pittsburgh to cover the whole width of the field.At this point, Jackson is officially day-to-day, and we should know more about his Week 18 status before the end of the week. Before coming to any conclusions, Ravens supporters should keep a close eye on injury reports and who is practicing.","Lamar jackson is expected to practice for the first time since suffering a back injury in week 16.

Where the Los Angeles Lakers Stand Now





The night was supposed to mark another milestone for LeBron James. Instead, it ended with a flat loss that left the building quiet. On December 30, 2025, the Los Angeles Lakers were beaten 128–106 by the Detroit Pistons at Crypto.com Arena, spoiling James’ 41st birthday.The result dropped the Lakers to 20-11 and extended a rough stretch in which they have lost four of their last five games. The concern wasn’t just the loss, but how it happened. The same issues showed up again: poor defense, careless turnovers, and little help beyond the top players.Detroit Pistons took charge from the opening quarter and never let the Los Angeles Lakers settle. The Pistons shot 63 percent from the field and 46 percent from three. They scored 74 points in the paint and added 31 on fast breaks, repeatedly beating Los Angeles down the floor.Turnovers made things worse. The Lakers gave the ball away 20 times, and Detroit turned those mistakes into 30 points. After Los Angeles briefly tied the game at 79-79 late in the third quarter, the Pistons answered with a 16-6 run to start the fourth and pulled away for good. Even after Tobias Harris left early with a hip sprain, Detroit’s bench stayed productive and steady.James struggled to find rhythm. He finished with 17 points on 6-of-17 shooting, along with four rebounds, four assists, five turnovers, and a minus-16 plus-minus in his 1,577th regular-season game.Luka Dončić led the Lakers with 30 points, 11 assists, and five rebounds, but he also committed eight turnovers, which added to the team’s problems.Detroit’s guards set the tone. Cade Cunningham scored 27 points and handed out 11 assists, consistently breaking down the defense. Marcus Sasser added 19 points off the bench. The Pistons improved to 25-8 and continued to look like one of the league’s most reliable teams.Reaction online focused on the same themes seen in recent losses. Fans questioned the Lakers’ defense, the lack of bench production, and the pattern of close wins followed by heavy defeats. Some criticism was aimed at Dončić’s defense, while others focused on the roster as a whole.Head coach JJ Redick also drew attention, with fans asking for clearer direction as injuries to Austin Reaves and Gabe Vincent continue to affect rotations.Redick said turnovers changed the game and pointed to unstable lineups due to injuries. James said Detroit’s speed and physical play made the difference and accepted the result without blaming officials.The Lakers still have elite talent at the top, but repeated blowout losses have raised questions about depth and defense. Detroit, meanwhile, showed again that its young roster can overwhelm teams that fail to keep up.","The los angeles lakers were beaten 128–106 by the detroit pistons on december 30, 2025.
