Poll Do you believe Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma should continue playing ODIs until the 2027 World Cup? Yes, they should play. No, it's time to retire. Only if they are performing well.

The Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) is in no rush to make decisions about the ODI futures of cricket stars Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma , despite ongoing speculation. The matter has gained attention as India's next ODI series against Australia approaches in October, with questions arising about whether the duo, who have collectively scored 83 ODI hundreds and over 25,000 runs, can continue playing until the 2027 ODI World Cup.India's scheduled ODI series against Bangladesh in August has been canceled, making the Australia series from October 19-25 their next one-day international commitment.The age factor has become a significant talking point, as Kohli and Rohit would be 39 and 40 years old respectively by the 2027 ODI World Cup.""Obviously, if they (Rohit and Kohli) have something in mind, they would tell the BCCI brass like they did before the England Test tour. But from an Indian team's perspective, the next big assignment is the T20 World Cup in February and preparations before that. The immediate focus will be on sending the best team for the Asia Cup T20 tournament, hoping all players are fit and available,"" a BCCI source told PTI on conditions of anonymity.The BCCI is known for its measured approach to sensitive decisions, particularly considering the massive fan following of both players.The last tournament featuring both players was the Champions Trophy in Dubai, where Kohli scored a century against Pakistan in a group stage match, and Rohit contributed with a crucial half-century in the final.Neither player has participated in competitive cricket since the Indian Premier League concluded.Kohli, now residing in London, has shown signs of returning to training, posting an Instagram story of an indoor nets session.Rohit, who was also in the UK post-IPL, has returned to Mumbai and is expected to begin training soon.While some media outlets have reported about BCCI potentially offering the duo a farewell game in Sydney on October 25, the BCCI source indicated no such discussions have taken place yet.""Even if they play Vijay Hazare, before that there would already be six ODIs that will be played. In between the Australia ODIs and the South Africa ODIs, there is an India A series against South Africa A where three List A games (50 overs) will be held at Rajkot on November 13, 16 and 19 respectively.""""Now, will the duo want to play those three A games, or possibly two, before the South Africa series is the question. Even more important is whether Ajit Agarkar and his colleagues would want that,"" the source added.The national One-Day Championship, Vijay Hazare Trophy, is scheduled to begin on December 24, 2025, preceded by a three-match ODI series against South Africa starting November 30.""Overlapping the Vijay Hazare Trophy (December 24, 2025 - January 18, 2025) will be the three ODIs between India and New Zealand (January 11, 14, 18). So even if they play the Vijay Hazare Trophy, it can't be for more than two to three games,"" the source concluded.","Virat kohli and rohit sharma have scored 83 odi hundreds and over 25,000 runs. The duo would be 39 and 40 years old respectively by the 2027 odi world cup. India's scheduled odi series against bangladesh in august has been canceled.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123218480,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-148776,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

How the rumours started and what outlets reported at the time

Why the episode mattered — team chemistry, media and perspective years later

The 2018 Ryder Cup in Paris is remembered for many things — Europe’s strong comeback, heated competition, and, behind the scenes, a story that swirled through corridors and tabloids. One of the most persistent rumours that autumn involved Paulina Gretzky and an alleged falling-out between teammates Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka. Although never proven, the saga became part of the event’s off-ice narrative and offered a glimpse into how gossip can shape perceptions during high-pressure team events.Reports from Golf Digest and L’Equipe carried whispers of a “heated” squabble aboard the flight to Paris, with an unnamed insider telling L’Equipe the mood on the plane was “horrible.” That kind of detail — sourced, but anonymous — is exactly the sort of fuel that turns a private spat into a public story.For fans and media, the idea of inter-player tension made the Ryder Cup drama feel larger than the scores. Ultimately, the American side fell to a cohesive European outfit, 17.5-10.5, a result commentators linked to on- and off-ice dynamics.Brooks Koepka pushed back against the gossip when questioned after the tournament, dismissing the claims of a fight and insisting the relationship with Johnson was intact.He said: ""This Dustin thing, I don't get. There was no fight, no argument. He is one of my best friends.""We talked on the phone on Monday and yesterday so tell me how we fought? I don't know. People like to make a story and run with it and it is not the first time a story has come out that is not true.""From a throwback viewpoint, the episode highlights how fragile team chemistry can seem under media pressure. Johnson publicly sought to extinguish breakup chatter, writing: ""Every relationship goes through its ups and downs, but most importantly, we love each other very much and are committed to being a family. Thank you for your love and support."" Whether the rumours affected results is impossible to quantify, but they show how off-ice narratives can overshadow performance.Also Read: Wayne Gretzky’s silence on Donald Trump’s anti-Canada rhetoric still sparks debate years later Looking back, the 2018 Ryder Cup reminder is simple: big events amplify small stories, and athletes often must manage both competition and the headlines that follow.",The 2018 ryder cup saw rumours of a falling-out between dustin johnson and brooks koepka.

Nazem Kadri's initial highs, lows, and headlines



The Controversial Career of Nazem Kadri

Nazem Kadri is one of those contemporary NHL players who went through his own set of ups and downs—from his early years as a polarizing forward with the Toronto Maple Leafs to his Stanley Cup-winning triumph with the Colorado Avalanche. Today he is an experienced face in the Calgary Flames. His existence has been marked by pressure moments, scandal, and redemption.Born in 1990 in London, Ontario, Nazem Kadri left his mark early with a sparkling career for the London Knights and Kitchener Rangers of the Ontario Hockey League. He immediately impressed NHL scouts with his play and was taken seventh overall by the Toronto Maple Leafs in 2009.Nazem Kadri’s decade with the Toronto Maple Leafs was anything but quiet. He became the emotional heartbeat of the team, delivering consecutive 30-goal seasons and frequently adding stimulation with his tough brand of hockey. But under playoff bright lights, surprise suspensions and discipline were worthy of criticism.As much as the Maple Leafs enjoyed his zest, they did go in another direction and sent him to the Colorado Avalanche in 2019 after trade negotiations had earlier fallen through—one of which involved a potential trade to Calgary—when he possessed a no-trade clause.In the Colorado Avalanche, Nazem Kadri thrived. Woven into a fabric of other top performers in Nathan MacKinnon and Cale Makar, he developed his two-way game and tallied career bests, including 87 points in the 2021–22 season. His postseason performances were nothing short of spectacular, battling through sickness to help Colorado win its first Stanley Cup in over two decades. Holding the Stanley Cup aloft was an iconic moment, proving himself to be more thana talented agitator.Also read: NHL Trade Rumors: Five potential destinations for Nazem Kadri if the Flames deal him From his name, Kadri signed a seven-year, $49 million contract with the Calgary Flames. He also brought production and leadership, having posted 56- and 75-point seasons before a 2024–25 season in which he posted 35 goals and 67 points. Kadri, now 35 years old, is still a difference-maker—still feisty battling for the puck, still a goal-scorer in clutch situations, and still playing with the desperation that made him hard to overlook at first.","Nazem kadri is an experienced face in the calgary flames.

Anaheim Ducks set high asking price for Mason McTavish, targeting Canadiens prospect David Reinbacher

Why Mason McTavish could be the perfect addition to the Montreal Canadiens’ roster

Trade chatter is swirling around Anaheim Ducks center Mason McTavish, with the Montreal Canadiens emerging as a frequent link. While Ducks general manager Pat Verbeek has made it clear he wants to keep the 22-year-old, reports indicate he’s open to moving McTavish if the return is right. That return, however, comes with a high price tag, one that could force Montreal into a tough decision.According to multiple reports, including Jimmy Murphy’s, Verbeek would only consider parting with McTavish for a young, right-handed defenseman capable of playing in a top-four role immediately, with the potential to grow into a first-pairing cornerstone.Within the Canadiens’ system, that description points directly to David Reinbacher, the fifth overall pick in the 2023 NHL Draft. The 20-year-old is widely viewed as Montreal’s top defense prospect and a key part of their future blue line.The Ducks’ reported request is straightforward, Reinbacher for McTavish — but it’s a steep cost for the Habs, who have been cautious about moving their top young assets.McTavish, 22, stands 6-foot-2, weighs 220 pounds, and plays a strong two-way game. Selected third overall by Anaheim in 2021, he has already compiled 140 points in 229 NHL games, including 60 goals.Last season, he tallied 52 points in 76 games, often in a third-line role and with limited power play time, suggesting even more offensive upside.For Montreal, McTavish would slot perfectly as a second-line center behind Nick Suzuki, giving the team a reliable scoring threat and added size down the middle. His combination of skill, strength, and playoff-style play makes him an appealing target, but surrendering Reinbacher could leave a long-term hole on the right side of their defense.The McTavish-to-Montreal speculation highlights a classic NHL trade dilemma, balancing the allure of an NHL-ready young star against the value of a blue-chip prospect. While McTavish could address an immediate need for the Canadiens, Anaheim’s high asking price ensures this deal, if it ever happens, will require serious consideration from both sides. Until then, the trade rumors are likely to remain a hot topic.Also Read: Rasmus Andersson breaks silence on Calgary Flames trade rumors, contract status, and offseason speculation","Anaheim ducks set high asking price for mason mctavish, targeting canadiens prospect david reinbacher.

Themay not be done making moves this offseason. While some believe their roster is set, others think another trade could be in the works to push them closer to championship contention.SB Nation’s Jacob Rude recently laid out three potential trade scenarios that could boost the Los Angeles Lakers ’ chances, including one involving Dillon Brooks.As Rude explained: “From a fan favorite to a villain of the fans. Dillon Brooks immediately became the target of the fans during the Lakers’ series against the Grizzlies, one that went terribly for him. He antagonized LeBron before the playoffs, then spent the series ducking reporters and getting ejected from games.”Dillon Brooks has built a reputation as one of the league’s most polarizing figures. His antics during the Lakers-Grizzlies playoff series turned him into a target for fans. However, Lakers history shows that villains can become allies - Ron Artest, Matt Barnes, and Dwight Howard all managed to redeem themselves after joining the team.• Elite Wing Defense: Brooks is widely regarded as one of the best wing defenders in the NBA.• Capable Scorer: While streaky, he can deliver big offensive performances.• Controlled Role: Likely to come off the bench for the Lakers, giving the team a quick hook if his on-court antics resurface.At present, the move appears unlikely. The Phoenix Suns , who landed Brooks in the Kevin Durant trade, have expressed no desire to move him. In addition, the proposed offer of Gabe Vincent and Maxi Kleber is unlikely to be enough to convince them.If the Los Angeles Lakers were willing to include one or two first-round picks, the Suns might reconsider - especially if they decide to pivot toward a rebuild. In that scenario, Dillon Brooks could be pried away from Phoenix.Also read: NBA Trade News: Los Angeles Clippers Sign $11.4 Million Golden State Warriors Star Forward in Pre-Season Roster Shakeup Pairing Brooks with both Luka Doncic and LeBron James could create a formidable combination of defensive grit and offensive potential.

Ben Simmons’ Fit and Performance Concerns

Strategic Priorities for Los Angeles

The’ rumored pursuit ofremains nothing more than speculation, with multiple financial, roster, and strategic roadblocks making a deal highly improbable.Ben Simmons’ $33 million-plus salary is the biggest stumbling block. Under NBA trade rules, the Los Angeles Lakers - already a luxury tax team - must send out comparable salaries to acquire him. With LeBron James, Anthony Davis, and Russell Westbrook on massive contracts, matching Simmons’ deal would require trading away multiple key role players and minimum-salary pieces, effectively gutting the roster. Moving a core star to make the numbers work is unrealistic, and Philadelphia is unlikely to settle for lesser assets.Even if the finances lined up, the Los Angeles Lakers face another roadblock: roster capacity. With 15 players under contract, they can’t add anyone until at least January 18 unless they waive or trade a player. This leaves no immediate pathway to bring Simmons on board.Beyond logistics, Simmons’ recent track record raises doubts. While he’s still an elite defender and strong playmaker, his scoring limitations and lack of shooting could worsen the Lakers’ existing floor-spacing issues.Injuries and inconsistent performances in recent seasons further diminish his appeal.T he Lakers have reportedly explored more attainable targets, such as Jerami Grant, who comes with a smaller contract and fewer health concerns. Maintaining roster balance, preserving cap flexibility, and avoiding high-risk moves remain the front office’s focus - factors that push a Simmons deal far down the priority list.A Los Angeles Lakers-Simmons pairing faces too many obstacles: an unworkable salary match, no open roster spots, fit concerns, and competing priorities. While the idea may spark fan debates, the practical reality is that Simmons is unlikely to wear purple and gold anytime soon.In the end, the Lakers’ connection to Ben Simmons feels more like a headline than a realistic plan. With financial hurdles, roster limits, and on-court fit concerns all stacked against the move, Los Angeles seems destined to keep exploring safer, more practical options rather than chasing an improbable blockbuster.Also read: NBA Trade News: Los Angeles Clippers Sign $11.4 Million Golden State Warriors Star Forward in Pre-Season Roster Shakeup Let us know in the comments if you think Simmons would have been a good addition to the Lakers roster.","Philadelphia 76ers forward ben simmons has been linked to the los angeles lakers.

Tyreek Hill’s injury absence magnifies Dolphins’ offensive weaknesses

NFL teams circling as Dolphins’ situation grows tense

As the Miami Dolphins gear up for the upcoming NFL season, the future of star wide receiver Tyreek Hill remains one of the league’s hottest talking points. While the Dolphins maintain they have “no intention” of trading the All-Pro receiver, persistent injuries and recent on-field struggles are keeping trade speculation alive — and NFL teams are watching closely.During joint practices with the Chicago Bears, Miami’s offense, led by quarterback Tua Tagovailoa, looked disjointed without Hill on the field. Known for his unmatched speed and ability to stretch defenses, Hill’s absence due to an oblique injury was felt immediately.Offensive line captain Terron Armstead admitted the void was significant, explaining that Hill’s ability to pull defenders and create openings is a cornerstone of Miami’s playbook. Without him, the offense lacked rhythm, and Chicago’s defense exploited those gaps with ease.The impact of Hill’s absence was most visible in Tua’s performance. After a steady camp with only one interception, Tagovailoa threw three picks against the Bears in a single session. Chicago’s defensive tactic of crowding the middle exposed Miami’s lack of explosiveness on the perimeter — a role Hill normally dominates.Despite Miami’s firm public stance, multiple NFL teams are reportedly monitoring the situation, ready to pounce if the Dolphins reconsider. Hill’s unique ability to change a game with a single play makes him a highly coveted asset, and his trade value could soar if Miami’s offense continues to sputter.If Hill’s injury lingers or if the Dolphins’ offense stalls early in the season, front office pressure could mount to explore offers.

Dolphins face backfield challenge and offensive balance test without Alexander Mattison



Miami Dolphins running back Alexander Mattison will miss the entire 2025 NFL season after undergoing season-ending neck surgery in Chicago. The injury, sustained during a preseason matchup against the Chicago Bears, is a major blow to Miami’s backfield depth heading into the regular season.According to ESPN’s Adam Schefter, Mattison was hurt during Sunday’s preseason game and immediately taken to a nearby hospital for evaluation. What initially appeared to be minor neck and shoulder soreness quickly escalated in severity, leading to emergency surgery later that evening. The procedure effectively rules him out for the remainder of the year.The news comes as a surprise given Dolphins head coach Mike McDaniel’s post-game comments. Speaking to reporters, McDaniel noted that Mattison was “doing well” and mentioned only experiencing some neck and shoulder soreness, suggesting that further updates would follow in the coming days. Unfortunately for Miami, the follow-up update confirmed the worst-case scenario.Mattison, who joined the Dolphins to add veteran stability and power running to the offense, was expected to play a key role in short-yardage and red-zone situations.His absence now forces the team to reconfigure its running back rotation before the season opener.With Mattison sidelined, the Dolphins will lean heavily on De’Von Achane, whose speed and versatility make him a dangerous weapon in space. Rookie Jaylen Wright and first-year back Ollie Gordon will also see increased opportunities to prove themselves in training camp and preseason action.In addition, the Dolphins are bringing in veteran Jamaal Williams for a workout, signaling the team’s intent to bolster depth with experienced talent. Williams, known for his physical running style and reliable goal-line production, could be a strong fit to replace Mattison’s role.For Miami, the loss of Mattison is not just about depth; it’s about maintaining offensive balance. The Dolphins’ high-powered passing attack led by Tua Tagovailoa and Tyreek Hill thrives when complemented by a consistent ground game. Finding a replacement capable of handling the physical demands of the position will be crucial for sustaining their offensive rhythm.Also Read: Cam Miller’s stunning Raiders debut triggers calls to move on from Aidan O’Connell While Mattison begins his recovery journey, the Dolphins’ coaching staff faces the challenge of reshaping the backfield and ensuring the team remains competitive in a tough AFC East.","Miami dolphins running back alexander mattison will miss the entire 2025 nfl season after undergoing season-ending neck surgery.
