NEW DELHI: The ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) in poll-bound West Bengal mocked Union sports minister Mansukh Mandaviya after he mispronounced the name of Kolkata-based football club Mohun Bagan during a press conference.In the clip, Mandaviya was seen struggling to pronounce “Mohun Bagan” correctly, eventually uttering a word that sounded like “baigan”, the Hindi term for eggplant. The mispronunciation quickly became the subject of online trolling.West Bengal’s ruling party, the Trinamool Congress (TMC), on Wednesday also reacted to the clip, using it to mock the Union minister and point out the error in his pronunciation.""The Union Sports Minister has, once again, revealed the deep-seated contempt the BJP harbours towards Bengal. He mangled the names of our most revered football institutions, referring to the legendary Mohun Bagan as ""Mohan baigan"" and the iconic East Bengal as ""East baigan"".The party further wrote: ""For Bengalis, Mohun Bagan and East Bengal are symbols of identity and pride. We have lived and breathed this beautiful game for over a century, celebrating victories with the same fervor as festivals and mourning defeats as personal loss.""Accusing the rival BJP of viewing Bengal through the ""lens of Bangla-Birodhi arrogance"", the TMC claimed that for the saffron party, anything associated with Bengal ""merits only mockery and dismissal.""""Yet, those who view Bengal through the lens of Bangla-Birodhi arrogance cannot even extend the basic courtesy of pronouncing these sacred names correctly. Why would they? In their eyes, anything associated with Bengal merits only mockery and dismissal,"" the TMC wrote on X.Mansukh Mandaviya on Tuesday said that the Indian Super League (ISL) will start from February 14. The minister also noted that all 14 clubs have agreed to play the ISL this season.""We have decided that the ISL will start on February 14, Saturday, and all of our clubs will participate in it,"" Mansukh Mandaviya told the reporters.""In the country, football has progressed. In football, the country performs well. Through the League, the country gets good players. With this aim, the ISL league will be held,"" he added.","Mansukh mandaviya mispronounced the name of kolkata-based football club mohun bagan during a press conference.

Kevin Love showers praise for LeBron James' basketball IQ



Kevin Love Talks LeBron & Kyrie, the Importance of NBA Vets, and More

Kevin Love on LeBron James as a lifelong student of the game







Kevin Love spent four defining seasons alongside LeBron James in Cleveland, sharing locker rooms, practices, playoff pressure, and, of course, wins. Those years gave Love a front-row seat to habits few teammates ever see. Long after their championship run, Love still speaks about what separated James from everyone else he played with.Love revisited his experiences during a recent appearance on The Old Man and the Three podcast. When he was asked to name the smartest player of his career, he answered LeBron’s name without hesitation.Kevin Love explained that James treated every moment as a learning window. “In shootaround or even out there on the floor, he could do every team’s scout. He knew every team’s play, he knew every guy’s tendency. He watched endless amounts of basketball… It’s a true gift,” Love said at the 23:50 mark. “In terms of basketball, he does have a photographic type memory. That’s not normal… It’s a hack when the best player in the world, a 6’9” 260 LB freight train, is setting the tone in that way. ”James’ basketball strategies helped Cleveland’s run to four straight NBA Finals from 2015 to 2018.Love and James helped deliver the franchise’s first championship in 2016, a title built on trust and execution. Love averaged 15.7 points and 9.2 rebounds across 489 games with the Cavaliers, earning two All-Star selections during that span.James’ awareness often extended beyond his own team. Opponents have recalled moments when he called out their sets before plays unfolded. Love pointed to press conferences where James could recount long sequences with precision, down to positioning and game context, reinforcing how deeply he processed the sport.Their partnership was not without strain. A 2015 tweet from James addressed team accountability and later became a public talking point. Love has since acknowledged the moment stung. The bond between the duo also shines till date. James attended Love’s wedding in 2022, and they often share moments off the court.Today, both players are with different teams. James still performs at a high level with the Los Angeles Lakers at age 41. Love contributes veteran leadership and shooting with the Utah Jazz. However, Love’s view of his former teammate is still the same.Also Read: Los Angeles Lakers head coach JJ Redick comments on coaching LeBron James: ""Sometimes he tells me to F off...and he's right""","Kevin love spent four seasons with lebron james in cleveland.

Kara Bieber ’s reaction brings added attention to Taylor Gausman’s offseason post





The offseason in baseball usually offers the chance to see things that are less refined and more personal and that was what happened when the wife of Kevin Gausman, Taylor Gausman, posted a sequence of casual vacation photos on Instagram. The photos showed the couple taking a relaxing time off without the crowded stadiums and demanding schedules with the sun, sand and relaxed feeling of being together.Even though the post immediately attracted appreciations among fans, this increased its reach when a voice of the baseball community entered the discussion. The most straightforward response in the comments provided some human element and made the response to a post of an offseason a dialogue between the whole MLB community.With thousands of likes and comments, one of the most prominent ones was received by Kara Bieber, the wife of Blue Jays pitcher Shane Bieber who made a response that was somewhat sarcastic and playful. In response to the photos of Taylor, Kara wrote, “does it gets better looking idk.” The line was friendly, admiring, and instantly the one notices it, as there is the sense of easy camaraderie that usually prevails among the families of players.What was appealing in the exchange was its authenticity. It was not about promotion or performance but simply a natural response to a moment which seemed to be authentic. Taylor gave a peaceful visual of what life was like without the hectic pace of baseball, and Kara’s comment was an easily identifiable lighthearted commentary that all fans love to watch during off-season.In the case of Kevin Gausman, a steady presence in the Toronto Blue Jays rotation, the moment was characterized by balance and not attention. It was a reminder to the followers that even during the off season, little and genuine interactions can go a long way. Even one post and an honest comment are sometimes enough to make a conversation across the baseball world, especially during the offseason when fans crave authentic moments beyond the game and and feel closer to players’ personal lives.","Taylor gausman posted a series of casual vacation photos on instagram.

Chelsea's defeat to Fulham sparks backlash toward Pedro Neto



Liam Rosenior’s Chelsea era begins with a devastating loss







Chelsea’s turbulent season took another huge blow at Craven Cottage as a 2–1 defeat to Fulham triggered fury among travelling supporters. Fans shared their frustrations as the match was marred by ill discipline, defensive lapses, and missed chances, which ended with chants aimed at the club’s hierarchy and growing anger toward individual performances.The loss came on a night when Chelsea again struggled to keep control. Marc Cucurella’s first-half red card left the visitors chasing the game. Fulham made their numerical advantage count. While Liam Delap briefly restored hope with his first Premier League goal for the club, the evening ended in frustration. One player, however, became the main focus of fan backlash, and it was none other than Pedro Neto.Pedro Neto found himself at the center of supporters’ anger following another difficult game. The Portuguese winger has endured a challenging run of form. Social media reaction was swift and unforgiving as fans questioned his role in the starting lineup.“Neto is so useless bro,” one supporter wrote on X.Another added, “Garnacho and Estavao should start instead of Neto and Palmer.” The criticism continued to mount as frustrations spilled across timelines. “I don’t understand how Pedro Neto has 0 skill moves, like not one time have I ever seen him skill past a player.I pray Rosenior moves on from him,” another post read.Others took an even harsher tone. “You’re embarrassing. Get Tosin and Neto out of my club,” a fan wrote.Another summed up the mood with, “It’s always gonna be defeat as far as Neto plays in Chelsea. Never seen a winger that can’t beat 1 defender.”On the pitch, Chelsea showed brief resolve. Raul Jimenez had given Fulham the lead early in the second half before Neto’s corner caused chaos in the box, leading to Delap’s equalizer. Harry Wilson’s late winner ensured the frustration lingered long after full-time.The match also served as an unwanted introduction for new head coach Liam Rosenior, who watched from the stands. He inherits a side with one win in nine league matches and a discipline problem that continues to define Chelsea’s campaign.Despite the anger, there remains a sense of transition around the club. Former Chelsea winger Paul Canoville urged unity following Rosenior’s appointment. “Liam Rosenior is a quality coach who knows the game inside out, and that's what matters most,” Canoville said. “So yes, it is a massive moment for the club, for London, for every young person dreaming big. But right now? Let's back Liam, give him what he needs, and let the man do his work. ”Now, Chelsea’s problems feel big and unresolved. The team must show brilliance with Rosenior in a new dawn.Also Read: Freddie Freeman and Chelsea Freeman combined net worth: MLB star earnings, business work, and their life together",Chelsea's defeat to fulham sparks backlash toward pedro neto.

Bangladesh seek T20 WC match shift from India after Mustafizur Rahman's IPL exit

Willow by Cricbuzz





West Indies all-rounder Jason Holder has weighed in on the India–Pakistan rivalry following the Asia Cup 2025, calling out what he described as excessive on-field theatrics and expressing disappointment over how events unfolded.The Asia Cup once again showcased why clashes between India and Pakistan remain cricket’s most intense rivalry. While the contest has always been charged with emotion and history, the 2025 edition went beyond the 22 yards, with off-field drama capturing almost as much attention as the cricket itself.India lifted the Asia Cup after defeating Pakistan by five wickets in the final, extending their dominance over their arch-rivals in multi-team tournaments. Yet, the post-match scenes drew widespread debate when Indian players chose not to collect the trophy from PCB chairman Mohsin Naqvi, amid the backdrop of the Pahalgam attack and Operation Sindoor . Naqvi eventually took the trophy back, resulting in India returning home without the trophy despite their victory.Speaking on thepodcast, Holder was candid about his discomfort with the situation. “I don’t like the India–Pakistan beef. I saw India win the Asia Cup and they didn’t go to accept the trophy. It’s just too much, man,” he said.Holder then broadened the discussion, offering his perspective on how politics and ownership dynamics have influenced franchise cricket. He noted the limited opportunities for Pakistani players in T20 leagues, especially those owned by Indian stakeholders.“Certain Pakistanis can’t be involved in certain teams because they’re owned by Indian owners. It’s just sad, man,” he added.The former West Indies captain stressed the influence top cricketers wield beyond results. “If you’re inspiring a generation and inspiring the world, then we have to find a way to come together,” Holder said. While acknowledging the long political history between the two nations, he believes cricket can still be a starting point for change. “I understand how big this rivalry is off the field,” he noted. “But if change is going to happen, it can start on the cricket field. A way to soften things is by India and Pakistan coming together through sport.”Holder sees potential for sport to influence life beyond cricket. “If it’s possible at a sporting level, maybe it becomes possible in everyday life too,” he said. “Stopping the fighting and tension would be huge.” He also spoke about the cultural impact of athletes as role models: “There’s always a trickle-down effect. When people see their heroes behaving a certain way, it influences them. That’s why it’s sad to see this play out. ”Despite the tensions, Holder emphasised his respect for both nations. “They’re beautiful countries with incredible people and cultures,” he said. “That’s why moments like this hurt everyone who loves cricket.” He concluded with a call to uphold the spirit of the game: “We talk about unity and growing the game. So let’s practise what we preach — bring cricket together and build healthier relationships.”India and Pakistan have not played a bilateral series for several years, making ICC and ACC events the only stages where the rivalry now unfolds. Asia Cup 2025 saw the two sides clash three times, including the final, keeping the spotlight firmly on the rivalry throughout the tournament.",Jason holder criticises on-field theatrics at asia cup 2025.

His career was played under the spotlight of the stage yet the basis of his success was constant and discreet. Hanley and his wife, Sanoe (Elisabeth) Ramirez constructed a family-first world that was neither too famous nor too normal.The couple has been drifting into a more muted phase since abandoning the game, defined by the long-term thinking, common interests, and a calculated lack of the never-ending focus.

The seasons of breakthrough and high performance with Miami Marlins made him one of the most complete hitters in the league, which resulted in major long-term contracts. Subsequent seasons with the Boston Red Sox, Los Angeles Dodgers and the Cleveland Indians brought on board veteran contracts that fortified his overall incomes.Appearances and after season exposure also added to his economic position.Sanoe Ramirez has avoided the limelight so much that she has not revealed her finances, unlike many other wives of professional athletes. No confirmed or publicly accessible information is given on her personal net worth. She has always kept a low profile option, including family life and staying stable in the face of the high profile sports career and its aftermath.Since the personal finances of Sanoe Ramirez are confidential, the joint net worth of the couple is usually pegged on the estimated fortune of Hanley Ramirez, which is around $50 million. They all share assets, long term planning and family approach to life off the field. The marriage has three kids and being brought up in an environment that is not under constant observation has influenced most of the post-retirement decisions.

Ric Flair’s net worth in 2025 and what it reflects

Ric Flair’s wrestling career, earnings, and endorsements





Ric Flair is still one of the most famous names in the history of wrestling. Well into his post-ring prime decades later, the “Nature Boy” still draws eyes with appearances, branding agreements, and a seemingly never-ending coverage of his life and career. But as legendary as he is, Flair's net worth in 2025 paints a much more complex picture than many fans would expect.Years ago, Flair made millions when wrestling boomed, but behind the scenes, financial realities have changed his wealth. A combination of medical expenses, lifestyle spending, and failed business ventures. Combined, they tell the tale of why one of wrestling's all-time greats is often associated with a surprisingly small fortune in his name to this day.Ric Flair’s net worth in 2025 is reported at $500,000. That number is especially notable for a competitor who held world championships with various promotions and headlined dozens of major events. Thus, financial analysts and wrestling historians alike attribute this to a mixture of high personal expenses during his prime, numerous divorces, and huge medical expenses after a few health crises.Even Flair has been open about living the high life, which matched what fans saw on TV.We made this point before, that image solidified his spot in cultural history, but also boxed in his long-term wealth compared to some other big-name athletes who took a more traditional investment approach.Flashy Ric Flair character through NWA, WCW, and WWE, a 16-time world champion, and a two-time Hall of Famer. Flair made a great deal of money throughout his career from top payouts, television, merchandise, and advertising.His income increased after wrestling through endorsements and licensing deals. The guy's visage and catchphrases have graced clothing, collectibles, energy drinks, and pop culture crossovers. Of course, contracts back in the wrestling days sometimes restricted long-term royalties, so a great deal of those nostalgically iconic moments may not have earned the same continuously rolling money as fans might expect.Over the past several years, Flair has embraced brand-forward initiatives. They've ranged from restaurant concepts and cannabis partnerships to drink collaborations, all of which leverage his name for a new generation. In reality, a handful of projects picked up hype early on, while other projects deal with existential crises due to operational complexity or public outcry.Also Read: Bron Breakker and Izzy Dame combined net worth: WWE contracts, endorsements, brand deals, and more","Ric flair’s net worth in 2025 is reported at $500,000.

Connor Bedard speaks out after missing Team Canada Olympic roster spot







When Team Canada officially unveiled its roster for the Milano Cortina Olympics on December 31, the biggest shock came with one notable exclusion: Connor Bedard of the Chicago Blackhawks. The 20-year-old center has been a standout in the NHL , tallying 44 points this season, but a lingering shoulder injury and the depth of Canadian talent kept him off the 25-man roster.Bedard’s omission has sparked conversations across hockey circles, particularly given his consistent scoring ability and status as a former No. 1 overall draft pick. Despite missing out, the young forward remains focused on recovery and is using this setback as motivation to sharpen his game for the remainder of the season.Canada’s initial roster announcement over the summer had already included six big names: Sidney Crosby, Nathan MacKinnon Connor McDavid , Sam Reinhart, Brayden Point, and defenseman Cale Maker. The finalized roster added 19 more players, including rising star Macklin Celebrini and established forwards Mitch Marner and Brad Marchand. Celebrini, at 19, is the youngest player on the team, highlighting the blend of youth and experience on the roster.Bedard, hailing from British Columbia, was seriously considered for inclusion but was still navigating the recovery process from a shoulder injury. Before the setback, he had recorded 19 goals and 25 assists in 31 games this season. His most recent appearance on December 12 against the St. Louis Blues saw him contribute two assists, signaling a positive step toward full health.Team Canada general manager Doug Armstrong explained that the decision ultimately came down to roster constraints. “There are so many good players, and we just had difficult decisions to make,” Armstrong said. Bedard’s name remained under consideration until the final moments, reflecting the team’s recognition of his talent.Bedard himself addressed the exclusion with professionalism, noting the opportunity to evaluate his game and improve. “When you don’t meet an expectation or meet one of your goals, the only thing to do is look in the mirror and see where you can get better,” he said. While disappointed, he remains on standby as a potential injury replacement, demonstrating a mature and constructive approach to his situation.Also Read: Connor Bedard skates for the Blackhawks after a shoulder injury in a December loss against Blues","Connor bedard was left off team canada's 25-man roster for the milano cortina olympics.

Travis Kelce keeps the door open for a return

Chiefs remain patient and supportive

Also Read:





The future of Travis Kelce remains uncertain after the veteran tight end spoke openly about his career plans. During a recent episode of the New Heights podcast with his brother Jason Kelce, Kelce made it clear that retirement is not a final call yet. Instead, his next step depends entirely on how his body feels in the coming months.Kelce said he would consider playing another season with the Kansas City Chiefs, but only if he feels physically ready to handle the grind.“If my body can heal up and rest up, and I feel confident I can give another 18 to 21-week run, I’d do it in a heartbeat,” Kelce said.At 36, the tight end admitted that the physical toll of the NFL is real. Years of deep playoff runs, short off-seasons, and constant hits have started to add up. This makes the decision far more complicated than in previous years.The 2025 season was a tough one for Kansas City. The Chiefs finished 6-11 and missed the playoffs, something that hasn’t happened in years. Despite the team’s struggles, Kelce continued to be one of the offense’s most dependable players and a leader in the locker room.During the podcast, Kelce also joked that he is currently “unemployed,” a comment that quickly grabbed attention.While said lightly, it highlighted the reality that he has not yet committed to playing in 2026.Inside the program, there is no pressure being placed on Kelce. Head coach Andy Reid has made it clear that the decision belongs entirely to the veteran tight end.Several teammates, including defensive star Chris Jones, believe Kelce still has plenty left to give if he chooses to return. His leadership and experience remain valuable, especially for a team heading into a transition phase.While the Chiefs would welcome Kelce back, the team’s salary cap situation adds another layer of complexity. Kansas City needs clarity before free agency and the draft. If Kelce takes too long to decide, the franchise may be forced to plan for a future without him.For now, Kelce is focused on rest, recovery, and spending time with family. He has also been open about opportunities outside football, including media and broadcasting roles, which gives him flexibility if he chooses to retire.Ultimately, this is no longer about love for the game. It is about health. If his body responds, the Chiefs could see No. 87 for one more season. If not, Kelce seems ready to walk away on his own terms, with his legacy firmly intact.","Travis kelce said he would consider playing another season with the kansas city chiefs, but only if he feels physically ready to handle the grind.

Kobe Bryant welcomes Stephen Curry to the league

Stephen Curry proved his “scout’s reports” incorrect







Every NBA legend has a ""Welcome to the League"" moment, but few are as cinematic as the one Stephen Curry experienced during his rookie year. Long before he was a four-time champion and the greatest shooter to ever live, Curry was just a skinny kid from Davidson trying to find his footing against the giants of the game. In his latest book and documentary project, Shot Ready, Curry recounts a specific encounter with the late, great Kobe Bryant that perfectly encapsulated the ""Mamba Mentality."" It wasn't a moment of mentorship or a friendly conversation, it was a raw, unfiltered reaction from a competitor who realized, perhaps for the first time, that the kid in front of him was built differently.Stephen Curry remembers his welcome to the NBA moment against Lakers when Kobe Bryant made sure to give the rookie a taste of the game. Curry was “switched on to him” and had to continuously bear the “infamous body bumps.”Curry shared another instance from his rookie year against the Lakers.“There was that moment in my rookie year when we were playing the Lakers, and I hit a shot off the glass… they zoomed in on Kobe, and he said a word I can’t repeat,” said Curry with a smile while watching the clip. While the exact words remain a mystery to the public, the sentiment was clear.The Mamba officially acknowledged your talent.The baby-faced assassin also recounted another Lakers vs Warriors moment from a preseason game in 2014, when Bryant had Curry on full-court defensive lockdown. Despite the continuous body contact and a minor slip, Curry shot a 3 over him, and what followed was a staredown. From Curry, it was a statement that “you can’t push me around,” and for Kobe Bryant, it was a moment where he knew the league was in good hands.Ultimately, this moment served as a bridge between two eras of basketball. Kobe Bryant didn't give out compliments easily, and he certainly didn't give them to rookies who hadn’t proved themselves. He not only acknowledged Curry’s talent but also his calmness and his presence that screams even without doing anything.For Curry, that interaction wasn't just about a made basket, it was the validation he needed to know he belonged on the same floor as his idols. It was also the moment to prove that the Scout’s report was wrong, which labelled him as “far below the NBA standard.” It reminds everyone that greatness recognizes greatness, often in the most unexpected and unfiltered moments. Years later, we see that Kobe was right, that kid with the bank shot was indeed a ""serious, serious problem"" for the rest of the NBA.Also read: “He controlled the market”: Rich Paul breaks downs how Michael Jordan built an empire without social media","Stephen curry recalls kobe bryant's ""welcome to the league"" moment during his rookie year.

Anthony Duclair’s quick hat trick becomes a key reason for Islanders’ dominance against Devils







Anthony Duclair also had an impressive night for the Islanders on Tuesday, scoring three goals to help the team beat the New Jersey Devils 4-0. Entering the game with just four goals in 39 appearances this season, Duclair’s three-goal effort was both unexpected and decisive, giving the Islanders a commanding lead early in the contest.Duclair had not played in the team’s previous two games and entered Tuesday night averaging only 12:58 of ice time per game. His scoring pace this season, roughly one goal every ten games, made his impact against the Devils particularly striking. Despite limited minutes and a modest role on the roster, he found the back of the net three times in just over 23 minutes of ice time.The first goal came 4:01 into the first period, marking Duclair’s first score since December 2 and his 12th goal in 84 games with the Islanders. Less than ten minutes later, he scored again, recording his first multi-goal game since March 2024. Duclair completed the hat trick 3:29 into the second period, finishing three goals in a combined game time of 23:29.Measured against his season averages, Duclair’s scoring efficiency against the Devils was extraordinary. He normally scores a goal every 126.4 minutes on ice, but Tuesday’s performance significantly exceeded that rate.Each goal came in quick succession, demonstrating his ability to convert scoring opportunities during limited ice time.The hat trick also contributed to the Islanders’ overall control of the game. With a 4-0 lead established early, the team maintained dominance through all three periods. Duclair’s goals were critical in extending the lead and keeping the Devils off the scoreboard throughout the contest.Duclair’s performance underscores the potential impact of players in depth roles who can contribute when given opportunities. The hat trick not only improved his personal statistics but also strengthened the Islanders’ position in the standings. As the 2025-26 NHL season progresses, contributions like these may play a significant role in determining team outcomes in tight matchups.Anthony Duclair’s hat trick against New Jersey stands out as one of the most improbable scoring efforts of the season, achieved in limited ice time and against a divisional opponent.

Usman Khawaja's retirement speech: 'I want the journey for the next Usman Khawaja to be easier'





Former England cricketer David Gower lavished praise on 22-year-old Jacob Bethell after the England batter struck his maiden First-Class century on Day 4 of the ongoing fifth Ashes Test against Australia at the Sydney Cricket Ground on Wednesday. Bethell produced a superb unbeaten 142 off 232 balls, laced with 15 fours, to help England build a crucial 119-run lead in their second innings in reply to Australia’s imposing first-innings total of 567.""Bethell. Brilliant. Delighted. Nuff said!"" Gower wrote on X.Former England captain Michael Vaughan also took to X to applaud Bethell’s technique, adding that the youngster’s innings should serve as a template for England’s Test batters going forward.""A star has been born here at the SCG .. The tempo / Technique and class of Jacob Bethell today is the blueprint for England's future Test batters,"" Vaughan reposted.Bethell then backed up that praise with a flawless maiden Test century, anchoring England’s response as the visitors clawed their way back into the contest and edged into a slender 119-run lead, leaving the fifth and final Ashes Test finely poised. At stumps on Day 4 at the SCG, England were 302 for 8, with Bethell unbeaten on 142 and Matthew Potts yet to score.The left-hander’s knock proved vital after England suffered early setbacks, losing Zak Crawley cheaply and Joe Root soon after. Showing maturity beyond his years, Bethell brought up his hundred in style from 162 deliveries, remaining unfazed as wickets fell around him.Just two overs after Bethell reached three figures, Beau Webster swung the momentum Australia’s way with two wickets in three balls, removing Harry Brook for 42 and dismissing Will Jacks for a duck. England’s woes deepened further when Jamie Smith was run out for 24 following a costly mix-up.Ben Stokes, who had earlier limped off while bowling with what appeared to be a groin issue, came in at No. 7 but lasted only five balls before falling to Webster. England are chasing another morale-boosting victory after their Melbourne triumph, although Australia have already retained the Ashes with a 3-1 series lead.Remarkably, the hundred was Bethell’s first in both Test cricket and red-ball cricket overall, eclipsing his previous best of 96 against New Zealand. Recalled for the Melbourne Test in place of the struggling Ollie Pope, Bethell has further strengthened his hold on the No. 3 spot after also scoring a gritty 40 in difficult conditions.Earlier, Australia were bowled out for 567 before lunch, built around Travis Head’s 163 and a commanding 138 from captain Steve Smith, leaving England to overhaul a daunting first-innings deficit of 183 after being dismissed for 384.England’s reply began on a shaky note as Mitchell Starc struck in the first over, trapping Crawley lbw for one. Ben Duckett, dropped on 38, failed to make the most of the reprieve and was bowled by Michael Neser for 42. Root then endured a torrid stay before falling lbw to Scott Boland for six.Bethell, however, stood firm, taking England past Australia’s lead shortly after tea with a single off Neser and celebrating his hundred with a crisp boundary through midwicket. Webster’s late strikes tilted the momentum back in Australia’s favour, but Bethell’s resolve ensured the contest heads into the final day delicately balanced.",Jacob bethell hits maiden test century for england against australia. 22-year-old's unbeaten 142 helps england to 119-run lead at stumps on day 4.
