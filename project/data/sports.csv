Reports suggest Miami Heat are emerging as a realistic landing spot for Giannis Antetokounmpo

Growing belief around the NBA suggests the Miami Heat now hold the edge in a potential Giannis Antetokounmpo pursuit

The Miami Heat have surged to the top of Giannis Antetokounmpo's list of potential destinations if he ever asks the Milwaukee Bucks for a trade, according to many league sources. The league's glamorous markets are forming Giannis Antetokounmpo's wish list, with Miami and New York emerging as top choices.Throughout the year, reports have connected him to both the Knicks and the Nets, portraying New York as ""Plan A"" for a superstar seeking a larger platform and a team willing to mortgage the future for an MVP. Miami is the contender that is just behind New York if it is at the top of the queue. Giannis would ""really love"" going to the Heat if the New York path is blocked, according to Howard Beck's recent remarks on The Zach Lowe Show, confirming previous reports that Miami is definitely on his short list.Since Milwaukee's heartbreaking first-round playoff loss to the Indiana Pacers last season and the team's rocky start to the 2025–26 season, trade rumors around Giannis have increased. The Bucks' inability to duplicate the supporting cast from their 2021 championship team has fueled ongoing rumors, despite their continued commitment to developing around their hero.According to Sam Amick of The Athletic, NBA executives are beginning to see Miami as the most attractive and practical destination for the two-time MVP.Giannis Antetokounmpo may be open to go to Miami, according to league insiders, if a package containing Tyler Herro, Kel'el Ware, and Jaime Jaquez Jr. is sent out.Amick said:“The Miami Heat, for example, are often handicapped by league insiders as a place that Antetokounmpo might be willing to call his new basketball home. Pat Riley and company could offer the Bucks a yacht full of draft assets, all their best young players and salary filler to make the numbers work.”The Nets have long considered Giannis a priority target should he become available, and the Knicks have previously been identified as a team that has exploratory conversations with the Bucks. New York provides what he has expressed a desire for in previous seasons: a sizable market, a fan base eager for competition, and the asset base necessary to make a blockbuster deal feasible.If talks with New York don't work out, Antetokounmpo might be interested in joining the Miami Heat, according to journalist Howard Beck of The Ringer. During a recent visit on The Zach Lowe Show, Beck revealed:“While writing Giannis's story and talking to people around the league, after New York, I was told Miami is the place Giannis would love to go if it's not New York.”From a basketball standpoint, the fit is clear. With Giannis as the focal point, Miami has a history of constructing stars, a defensive anchor in Bam Adebayo, and the organizational confidence to pursue another championship-level core.There is a growing perception throughout the league that the Heat will aggressively present themselves as the alternative if the Knicks are unable to complete a transaction. Insiders believe that Miami has surpassed the other teams who were previously mentioned as bidders. The 31-year-old Antetokounmpo is in his 13th season with the Bucks and has a 2026–2027 contract with a 2027–2028 player option.Although Giannis hasn't publicly stated that he wants to leave Milwaukee as of yet, the NBA is in agreement that South Beach is presently the favorite to win.Also read: Milwaukee Bucks re-sign Thanasis Antetokounmpo as Giannis Antetokounmpo locks in for 13th season","Miami heat are emerging as a realistic landing spot for giannis antetokounmpo.

He’s accompanied by Diana, an android who resembles a young child and often sits on Hugh’s back during combat sequences.","New resident evil 9 trailer features iconic hero leon s. kennedy.

What to expect from John Cena vs GUNTHER and other key storylines

WWE includes John Cena's farewell this weekend as we lead into Saturday Night's Main Event on Saturday, December 13, 2025, where Cena will have what WWE is promoting as his final in-ring match. The match with GUNTHER, which emerged from a build with GUNTHER via the booking of the ""Last Time Is Now"" tournament, is set to be a hard-hitting, technical exhibition aimed at giving Cena a big send-off while also pushing the opponent forward at the same time.The entire event is packed with multibrand showdowns and title ramifications, including Undisputed WWE Champion Cody Rhodes vs. NXT Champion Oba Femi, AJ Styles & Dragon Lee defending the World Tag Team Titles, and Bayley vs. Sol Ruca in a premier women’s division bout. WWE has carded the show as streaming live on Peacock in the US and regional broadcasts outside of the US.Saturday Night’s Main Event is scheduled to begin at 8:00 p.m. ET / 5:00 p.m. PT on December 13 in the U.S., exclusively on Peacock for American audiences. International fans can watch via WWE’s global distribution partners, including Sony Sports Network and SonyLIV in India, as well as WWE’s own channels in select regions.The 8:00 p.m. ET start converts to 1:00 a.m. GMT (UK, Dec. 14), 6:30 a.m. IST (India, Dec. 14), 11:00 a.m. AEST (Australia, Dec. 14), and 10:00 a.m. JST (Japan, Dec. 14). Viewers should check local listings for possible pre show programming or minor scheduling adjustments as WWE often updates timing for kickoff segments.Get ready for an evening with a nostalgic feel with a competitive edge. Cena can say farewell to the company where he spent the majority of his two-decade career, and GUNTHER's character has made it clear that he plans to ruin the moment by putting Cena through a long technical loss instead of the emotional moment we would all like to see. That dynamic creates the environment for either a heroic send-off for Cena, or a conclusive changing of the guard from one of WWE's most successful 21st century stars.In the meantime, on that same card, Cody Rhodes takes on Oba Femi in a hypothetical champion versus champion match-up that could alter the course of two titles as we head into 2026. AJ Styles and Dragon Lee roll on as World Tag Team Champions, Bayley’s match with Sol Ruca highlights WWE Putting Bright New Talent Up Against Established Stars, and why veterans like Kevin Owens have a way of spelling it out on WWE Raw.With Cena’s final bell looming, Saturday Night’s Main Event is positioned to deliver both emotional weight and competitive drama across a packed card.Also Read: WWE pays heartfelt tribute to John Cena ahead of last match at Saturday Night Main Event","Saturday night's main event is scheduled to begin at 8:00 p.m. Et on december 13 in the u.s. exclusively on peacock for american audiences.

Edwards also added nine rebounds.On the other hand, the Golden State Warriors are coming back to their arena after a break of four days. They are all set to prepare for the match against the Minnesota Timberwolves at the Chase Centre. Although Stephen Curry was present at the full practice on Wednesday, his coming back from his quadriceps injury still makes him doubtful.

They have won 6 out of their last 10 games. Additionally, they are positioned at the 13th spot in the defense ranking with an average of 113.4 defensive rating and the 8th spot in the offense rating with an average of 117.9 offensive rating. On the other hand, the Warriors' attack is significantly influenced by the non-availability of their leading scorer.Although Golden State anticipates a number of reinforcements in the near future, some key players are still doubtful based on the injury report for this game. The Timberwolves, on the other hand, have a more assured roster because they haven't announced any significant confirmed absences.The Wolves have taken advantage of the few days between games following their most recent game on Monday to regroup and tighten things up, something Rudy Gobert thinks will be beneficial.Also read: Jonathan Kuminga moving to Sacramento Kings?

Pacers’ Injury Problems Mount

What’s at Stake for Both Teams

The Philadelphia 76ers enter their December 12, 2025 matchup against the Indiana Pacers with renewed optimism as Joel Embiid inches closer to full strength. After an extended absence earlier in the season, the reigning MVP is trending upward, and his return has immediately shifted the tone in Philadelphia. Fans are hoping this is the night where “The Process” fully reasserts himself.This matchup also carries weight for a Sixers team trying to build momentum in a crowded Eastern Conference race. At 13-10, Philadelphia has shown flashes but has struggled to stay healthy. A healthier Embiid, paired with Tyrese Maxey’s probable return, positions the Sixers to capitalize against a severely depleted Pacers squad limping into Wells Fargo Center at 6-18.Joel Embiid is listed as probable due to left knee injury recovery, signaling a positive trend after logging 31 points and 12 rebounds in his return against the Chicago Bulls on December 8. Despite missing 14 games earlier this season for bilateral knee management, he completed 33 minutes in that outing without complications. A five-day rest period since then has helped his conditioning, giving him a chance to play back-to-back games for the first time this year.Beyond Joel Embiid, Philadelphia 76ers' depth continues to be tested. Tyrese Maxey, battling an illness, is also probable. Kelly Oubre Jr. remains sidelined with a left knee sprain, marking his twelfth straight missed game. Trendon Watford is still recovering from a left adductor strain, and Hunter Sallis remains out with a right shoulder sprain. Jared McCain, meanwhile, is available after recovering from thumb surgery.Indiana faces an even more daunting situation. Tyrese Haliburton is out with an Achilles issue, while Obi Toppin, Ben Sheppard, and Aaron Nesmith all remain unavailable due to their respective injuries. Quenton Jackson is questionable, further shrinking Indiana’s rotation as they attempt to compete on the road.Also read: Indiana Pacers vs Philadelphia 76ers regular season game: Full injury report, who's out, and more (December 12, 2025) With Philadelphia coming off a loss to the Lakers, Embiid’s expected availability could spark a needed response. A weakened Pacers frontcourt creates the possibility of a dominant Embiid performance, perhaps even a highlight-reel moment over Myles Turner that would electrify the home crowd. Tip-off arrives with uncertainty surrounding final injury statuses, but the Sixers hold a clear opportunity to seize control and keep climbing the standings.","Joel embiid is listed as probable due to left knee injury recovery.

NHL Trade Buzz: Edmonton Oilers acquire Tristan Jarry in major swap with Pittsburgh Penguins,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/nhl-trade-buzz-edmonton-oilers-acquire-tristan-jarry-in-major-swap-with-pittsburgh-penguins/articleshow/125937171.cms,"Tristan Jarry (Image Via Twitter)

How Tristan Jarry, Spencer Stastney, and Sam Poulin impact the Oilers-Penguins trade and roster depth

The NHL trades are getting hotter, now even more so with the Edmonton Oilers and Pittsburgh Penguins changing their lineups through a big goaltending switch. The whole ice hockey universe is really talking about and speculating about the futures of the two teams; in fact, some of the best players and draft picks are even taking part. Goaltender, roster strength, and playoff chances are the factors that determine if Edmonton will have solid goaltending or if Pittsburgh will reshape its tactics.The Oilers reportedly exchanged goaltender Stuart Skinner, defenseman Brett Kulak, and their second-round pick in 2029 for goaltender Tristan Jarry and forward Sam Poulin, as per Sportsnet's Elliotte Friedman and AP News. Moreover, the Oilers also obtained defender Spencer Stastney from the Predators in exchange for a third-round pick in 2027. Jarry, a two-time All-Star, has recorded 9 wins, 3 losses, and 1 shoot-out loss, with a 2.66 GAA and a .909 SV percentage this season, whereas Skinner has had a hard time with an .891 SV percentage in 23 games. Kulak was a key player in the defense of Edmonton, while Poulin was almost the entire season in the AHL, but as a former first-round pick is definitely a player to be noticed. The trades show how serious Edmonton's situation with the goalies was and how Pittsburgh is interested in young players and draft picks more than ever.Jarry’s impressive comeback this season with Pittsburgh’s Dan Muse as his coach gives Edmonton a well-experienced goaltender who can help stabilize their net right away. Even though he has shown some inconsistencies in the postseason in the past, his numbers for the current season (2.66 GAA and .909 save percentage) prove he can take the pressure. Stastney adds depth to the Oilers' blue line after Kulak’s exit, and Poulin offers minor league support for Pittsburgh. The trade not only alters the goaltending situation in favor of Edmonton but also opens up room for the young goalies of Pittsburgh, thus making it evident that both teams are trying to meet short-term needs while planning for the long term.The swap points out the fact that Edmonton is in a hurry to upgrade its goaltending, while Pittsburgh is leaning towards drafts and prospects; both teams, however, are hoping that these changes will have a positive impact on their playoff success and the future of their development.Also Read: NHL Injury Update: Mats Zuccarello and Jake Middleton placed on injured reserve; Aube-Kubel and Matt Kiersted called up by Minnesota Wild","The edmonton oilers and pittsburgh penguins have traded their goalies.

Utah’s Situation and Game Stakes

Ja Morant’s potential return has become the dominant focus as the Memphis Grizzlies prepare for a crucial home contest against the Utah Jazz on December 12, 2025. With Memphis fighting to climb out of an early-season hole and the Jazz continuing to struggle, the superstar guard’s status injects rare midseason suspense into a matchup carrying both standings weight and emotional energy at FedExForum.The Memphis Grizzlies have rediscovered their rhythm during Morant’s absence, winning seven of their last ten games while showcasing unexpected depth from rookies and role players. Still, the possibility of the franchise face stepping back onto the court has turned local buzz into full-blown anticipation, especially with the team sitting at 11-13 and eyeing a potential surge.Ja Morant remains officially listed as questionable due to a right calf strain that has kept him out of the past 10 games. He last appeared on November 15 against the Cleveland Cavaliers before the lingering issue shut him down, limiting him to just 12 outings so far. Encouragingly, he completed a full practice without restrictions on Thursday, prompting head coach Tuomas Iisalo to label his progress as promising while emphasizing that the final decision hinges on how Morant’s body responds closer to tip-off.Both the 9:30 AM and 11:30 AM ET league injury reports maintained his questionable designation, with no upgrade issued by late evening IST.Despite the uncertainty, the momentum toward a return has built steady optimism among fans.Before the injury pause, ja Morant averaged 17.9 points, 3.5 rebounds, and 7.6 assists. His efficiency, however, lagged at 35.9 percent from the field and 16.7 percent from three, numbers expected to normalize as he re-establishes rhythm. In his absence, rookies Cam Spencer (11.1 points, 3.9 assists) and Jaylen Wells have taken on larger roles, helping Memphis improve an offense that still ranks just 25th in overall rating.The Memphis Grizzlies continue to battle a lengthy injury list beyond Morant:Jaren Jackson Jr. remains available despite recent scoring struggles.Utah enters the contest undermanned as well, missing Walker Kessler (season-ending left shoulder surgery), Georges Niang (left foot stress reaction), and several players on G League assignments. The Jazz hold an 8-15 record and continue searching for stability.Also read: Is LaMelo Ball playing tonigh vs the Chicago Bulls?

Ex-NFL QB Robert Griffin III claims Chiefs’ biggest problem is “predictability” as Kansas City fights to stay in playoff race,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/ex-nfl-qb-robert-griffin-iii-claims-chiefs-biggest-problem-is-predictability-as-kansas-city-fights-to-stay-in-playoff-race/articleshow/125931944.cms,"Chiefs’ season on the brink.Image via: Getty

Ex-NFL star Robert Griffin III believes the Chiefs’ offense has become too easy to read

Also read

The Kansas City Chiefs are entering the final stretch of the regular season in a place almost no one expected. At 6-7, they are staring at the possibility of missing the playoffs for the first time in the Patrick Mahomes era. To stay alive, they likely need to win out and hope several teams ahead of them slip. For a franchise used to controlling the AFC, every remaining game now feels like a test of whether they can steady themselves in time.Fans have noticed the same thing analysts have: this Chiefs offense does not look like the group that once scared every defense in the league. Mahomes still gives Kansas City a chance, but the rhythm, big plays and confidence that defined their peak years have been harder to find. With frustration rising, attention has turned to what exactly is going wrong and what can be fixed fast.Former NFL quarterback Robert Griffin III has watched Kansas City closely all season, and when asked what he sees as their biggest issue, he had one word ready. ""Predictability,"" Griffin said while helping USAA gift two military veterans with new vehicles before the Army Navy game. ""I’m pretty tapped in with Kansas City, and I think there’s a predictability element right now.""Griffin explained that even though Andy Reid and Matt Nagy are known for their creativity, defenses now have an easier time understanding what Kansas City wants to do.Without the constant deep threat that Tyreek Hill once provided, Griffin thinks the offense has lost some of its unpredictability. ""The offense really hasn’t been super explosive consistently since Tyreek Hill left, but they’ve been able to dink and dunk, run really good concepts, utilize Rashee Rice, and Travis Kelce, and Xavier Worthy, and Juju Smith-Schuster, and Tyquan Thornton in various ways to make it hard to cover because you have to be prepared for everything,"" he said. ""But you know when Tyquan Thornton comes into the game, it’s going to be this. You know when Xavier Worthy comes into the game, it’s going to be this.""Griffin also shared what he thinks Kansas City should try moving forward, and it revolves around giving Mahomes even more control. ""This is just a suggestion from a guy who’s played a ton of football, who’s watched a ton of football and has been studying them all year, I think the Kansas City Chiefs need to transition their offense into a two-minute offense,"" he said. ""Allow Patrick Mahomes to do what he does best, run up-tempo, call what he is seeing. ""He believes the faster pace would help both Mahomes and the offensive line while tiring out defenses. As he put it, ""No team wants to be in a close with the Chiefs with two minutes left in the game.""Time is running out for Kansas City. If they want their season to continue past Week 18, they need answers quickly.","Ex-nfl star robert griffin iii believes the chiefs’ offense has become too easy to read.

Coach Tim Kelly puts responsibility on Jaxson Dart

Also Read:

Rookie quarterback Jaxson Dart has quickly become the brightest part of an otherwise difficult season for the New York Giants. But after a dangerous sideline collision against the New England Patriots, the message from the coaching staff this week was unmistakable: Dart’s competitiveness cannot come at the cost of his health, or the team’s discipline. Offensive coordinator Tim Kelly did not mince words when reviewing the hit that triggered a brief sideline scuffle in Foxborough. Speaking on December 11, he placed the accountability squarely on Dart’s decision-making.“He’s got to get everything he can and then make sure he’s clearly out of bounds so he’s not exposing himself,” Kelly said. “Our guys went to protect him, which you love to see. Obviously, it hurt the team because of the penalty. Again, it comes down to awareness.”On the second-and-13 play in question, Dart scrambled toward the right sideline after failing to find an open receiver. Patriots linebacker Christian Elliss delivered a powerful hit as Dart approached the boundary, sparking an immediate response from Giants tight end Theo Johnson and several teammates. While some fans called it unnecessary, the league determined the hit was legal - and the onus, Kelly stressed, was on Dart to avoid contact sooner.Dart’s aggressive playing style has energized the Giants but also put him in harm’s way multiple times this season. He previously missed two games due to a concussion suffered on a scramble in Chicago. Yet his athleticism and willingness to extend plays remain central to what makes him a promising long-term starter. Kelly acknowledged that balance is still a work in progress.“With a young quarterback, the ability to be aggressive without being reckless is key,” Kelly said. “He’s got to learn when the journey is over. You’re already on the sideline, the defender has you dead to rights - duck out six inches earlier and we’re not talking about this.”The coordinator also revealed ongoing conversations with Dart about personal safety and situational awareness, insisting the message is “becoming clearer.” Despite the Giants sitting at 2-11 and eliminated from playoff contention, the final four games are viewed as essential developmental reps. Dart leads all rookie quarterbacks with 11 touchdown passes and has shown rare poise for a first-year starter. It's clear that Giants see Dart as its future. The priority now is keeping that future intact.","Jaxson dart's competitiveness cannot come at the cost of his health, or the team's discipline.

NEW DELHI: The queen was not always the strongest piece in chess. From the inception of ""Chaturanga"" in India in the 6th century, and through its long journey across the Middle East before reaching Europe in the 15th century, the piece we now call the queen served only as a minister or counsellor.Limited to a single diagonal step, it played a modest role on the board.It took centuries of the game’s evolution before that restrained figure became the commanding piece we know today, one with unmatched mobility and game-changing ability.That journey of the queen is enough to light up the eyes of eight-year-old Aenam, a fourth-standard student at Satpuda Valley Public School in Betul, Madhya Pradesh.For Aenam, who picked up chess only a few months ago, learning the game is not just restricted to moves and openings, but it is now her way of making new friends.“I was very excited to learn chess for the first time,” she said in a chat with TimesofIndia.com. “I enjoy it the most because we get to learn new things and also make new friends. I didn’t know anything about chess before.”Thirteen-year-old Bhanuja, a seventh-standard student from Madhya Pradesh, says chess has taught her how to stay steady under pressure. “I felt excited but a little confused at first,"" she shared.""Yes, sometimes chess is hard and confusing. But it has helped me focus better and stay calm.”For 14-year-old Aditi from Bhadohi, Uttar Pradesh , the benefit of playing chess is noticeable. “I gained confidence in playing chess and started doing it with a clear mind. I have self-confidence because I play chess,” she said.And 18-year-old Shreya, who just cleared her higher-secondary exams topping her class, feels that the game has expanded her attention span.“There are many new things I have learned from chess: how to make decisions in stressful situations, time management, how to be calm, and how to plan ahead,” she revealed. “Sometimes I get stuck in difficult positions, but instead of giving up, I practice more. Slowly, everything becomes clear.”“For me, it has become a new skill. At home, everyone appreciates that I’m learning and encourages me,” she added.For these girls, the world of chess might have remained far away, if not for a new grassroots programme that began earlier this year in July.The initiative, called ""Checkmate Betul"", was the brainchild of Avika Shukla, a US-based high-school student raised in Gurgaon with family roots in Madhya Pradesh.The idea sparked during one of Avika’s summer visits to India.“I was playing chess with our housekeeper’s kids,” she recalled. “They asked me how I learned, and I said I used to play with my grandparents and later took some classes. Then they asked me, ‘Can you teach us?’”Avika was about to fly back to the United States. “But I realised I could teach them, virtually. With all the technology we have today, a chess lesson is just a click away,” she told this website.That one moment set off a chain reaction.Avika reached out to young female chess players, arbiters, and enthusiasts she knew and admired from across the world.Joining hands with Avika were six young women from across the world: WCM Zara Majid (Cayman Islands), WIM Iris Mou (New York City), FIDE Arbiter Christina Aziz (Gambia), Eesha Gorantla (New Jersey), Claire Cheng (New Jersey), and Audrey Smith (California).Within weeks, a seven-member team formed, united by one conviction: girls in rural areas deserved the same access to chess education that many urban or privileged students enjoy.And that became the foundation: for girls, and led entirely by girls.“Chess offers some of the highest cognitive benefits of any sport,” Avika explained. “It builds discipline like any physical sport, but also critical thinking and educational skills. There are studies showing how chess improves math.”For rural girls, many of whom ask why they should learn chess in the first place, this becomes an important motivational tool.“Our program is tied with schools, so the schools also understand how it is helping the girls,” she said.The team began by tying up with schools in Betul, Madhya Pradesh. They chose rural pockets intentionally, places where structured chess training did not exist at all.“Where we started, there was no such thing as a chess class,” Avika said. “We wanted to bring chess to a group of girls who would never have gotten the chance otherwise.”The team started in Madhya Pradesh but has now expanded to Uttar Pradesh and plans to enter Haryana next. But bringing chess into rural India wasn’t easy.“The biggest challenge was convincing the girls that this is an exciting opportunity,” Avika revealed. “At first, it felt like just another activity. But slowly, when they started enjoying it, it became something they looked forward to.”She remembered Diwali: “We didn’t have class that day. And many girls asked us why class was cancelled. Seeing that enthusiasm was beautiful.”Classes are about 75 minutes.“For 65 minutes we teach chess,” Avika explained. “But for the remaining 10 minutes, we bring in guest speakers or show recorded messages from female players. It inspires the girls and shows them the opportunities available.”The curriculum is taught online, using bold visuals, arrows, patterns and interactive methods that surpass language barriers.“Chess is simple to teach visually,” Avika explained. “And if, for example, Christina from Gambia is teaching, we also try to have a Hindi-speaking mentor in the class to assist if needed.""Despite the programme being free for girls, the logistics in rural India are rarely simple.“In the beginning, most girls used their parents’ phones,” Avika added. “Infrastructure is a huge challenge: physical boards, projectors, training material, stable internet.”Their solution came with tuition centres. The team secured sponsorship from ChessKid, which donated full premium access, worth around Rs 2 lakh, to every participating girl, while a collaboration with The Gift of Chess helped them provide physical boards to the girls.“In places like Bhadohi, we now partner with local tuition centres where girls can sit across from each other with real boards,” she remarked. “We teach them online while they get hands-on practice offline.”The programme has already begun to show results.“One girl has improved so much she’s now playing district-level tournaments,” Avika stated proudly. “We just gave her the resources, she discovered a whole new passion.”Another girl has seen a surprising side benefit: “Her English has improved a lot. Her parents told us she went to class to learn chess but ended up improving her language skills too.”The team doesn’t limit enrolment strictly to rural areas, but rural India remains their focus. “If someone from a city wants to join, we never say no,” Avika clarified. “But our mission is to introduce chess to girls who would not have received the chance otherwise.”Looking forward, financial sustainability remains the biggest concern.“Chess can become expensive,” Avika said. “Even top grandmasters say this. If some of these girls become serious players, we don’t want money to hold them back.”They are exploring grants, writing to organisations, and even looking for private donors. But despite the hurdles, Avika’s voice holds excitement more than worry.“The girls motivate us,” she said. “Their excitement, their confidence, their growth.

Clint Frazier says Yankees of the past now look like today’s Dodgers

“The Yankees of the past are the modern-day Dodgers now.”

“You can’t let certain players go back to a team that is already winning so much. You have to be a speed bump.”

“They have superstar players, but the players around them are not always difference-makers.”

Clint Frazier spoke on Thursday about the New York Yankees after they lost free agent pitcher Edwin Diaz to the Los Angeles Dodgers.

He said the New York Yankees used to act like the modern Los Angeles Dodgers, but now the Dodgers play that role better.He pointed at the way the Dodgers spend money and go after top players without fear. Clint Frazier said,He added that the Dodgers are brave with their spending and pick the best players before anyone else.He used Edwin Diaz as an example and said the Yankees should never let a top player go to a team that already has so much success.He also said teams must block the Dodgers from getting stronger, but the Yankees failed to do that. Clint Frazier said,He believes the Dodgers keep stacking wins while the Yankees watch from behind. Clint Frazier also spoke about the roster the Yankees put around their stars.He said the team pays big names well, but the support pieces do not always help them win. He explained that the Yankees have great players but need more impact talent beside them.Clint Frazier said,He believes the Yankees must add players who change games, not just fill space.Clint Frazier also said the Yankees must spend better in the offseason so they do not lose key players to the Los Angeles Dodgers again.He believes the Yankees can challenge any team, but only if they return to bold moves like the old days.Also Read: Kyle Tucker Leaves Big Impression At Blue Jays Tampa PDC As John Schneider Reveals What Stood Out","Clint frazier spoke on thursday about the new york yankees after they lost free agent pitcher edwin diaz to the los angeles dodgers.

In a season where forwards from every team have given season-worthy performances, and both veterans and rookies alike have been impressive on the ice, the race for the Hart Trophy gets even more intense. But there are some clear standouts even among them.While some have been impressive with their point production, like Macklin Celebrini, others have helped their team maintain a dominant spot atop the points table, as Nathan MacKinnon has done. The Professional Hockey Writers Association met recently to decide which names from November fell off and which remain favorites.While many players have been impressive this season, one of the most impressive is Logan Thompson of the Washington Capitals. With a GAA of 1.96 and a save percentage of .926, the netminder has had one of the best numbers across the league.Only the Minnesota Wild’s Jesper Wallstedt has better numbers among all goalies with more than 10 appearances across the season. But while Wallstedt has been impressive, Thompson has entered the sixth gear over the past few games.Over a span of six starts, Thompson has averaged an SV% of .955 while boasting a GAA of 1.32.With this range of numbers, the PHWA was forced to include him at the No. 5 spot on the Hart Trophy favorites. But while the inclusion of a goalie is rare, the man in the fourth spot isn’t a surprise to anyone.Connor McDavid, despite a slow start to the season by his numbers, has been impressive overall with 48 points in 31 games. Despite the Edmonton Oilers struggling through the Pacific Division, McDavid himself has continued to be terrific.While at one point the franchise looked nearly out of the playoff race, recent efforts from McDavid have pushed them back to the wild-card spot. With a 1.55 PPG, he was ranked fourth on the list of the MVP favorites.But the next two names on the list are the ones who have surprised the hockey faithful the most this season. Connor Bedard from the Chicago Blackhawks and Macklin Celebrini from the San Jose Sharks continue to occupy the third and second spots in the MVP race, respectively.While Bedard was already impressive last season, this season he has kicked his play into overdrive with 42 points across 30 games. Leading the Blackhawks across points, goals (19), and assists (23), he has been responsible for nearly 47 percent of all Chicago goals.Celebrini, meanwhile, has been equally impressive with 44 points (15 goals, 29 assists) across 31 contests. Not to mention, his 29 assists have him tied second for the league lead behind McDavid.But while everyone on the list had been impressive, one player takes the undisputed lead in the rankings. MacKinnon with 53 points (25 goals, 28 assists). The Avalanche Center has been the only player so far who has reached the 50-point mark and has been a big reason behind Colorado’s 22-2-7 record.While his current pace suggests that Colorado might be looking at the first 100-point season from MacKinnon, one thing is clear: Nathan MacKinnon is ready for the Hart Trophy.",The professional hockey writers association met recently to decide which names from november fell off and which remain favorites.
