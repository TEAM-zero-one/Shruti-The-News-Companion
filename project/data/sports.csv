Trade discussions around the Los Angeles Lakers are picking up, and one name keeps coming up: Dillon Brooks. With the deadline approaching, the Lakers are exploring ways to improve a roster that still leans heavily on its stars.The idea is simple. Pair LeBron James and Luka Dončić with a wing who defends hard, takes tough assignments, and doesn’t need the ball. Brooks, currently with the Phoenix Suns, fits that description and may be available as Phoenix adjusts its roster.The Los Angels Lakers’ biggest issue this season has been defense on the perimeter. Dillon Brooks is known for guarding top scorers and staying physical for full games. That matters for a team where LeBron is 41 and Luka carries a heavy offensive load.Brooks doesn’t need plays called for him. He shoots well enough from three to keep defenses honest and focuses most of his energy on defense. That role fits cleanly next to two ball-dominant stars.One proposed idea involves a three-team deal. The Los Angeles Lakers would send out Gabe Vincent, Max Christie, and a protected first-round pick. Dillon Brooks’ $23 million salary would be moved to Los Angeles, while Phoenix takes back a veteran minimum deal to help with cap flexibility.A third team, such as Utah, could be included to balance salaries and receive young players like Jalen Hood-Schifino along with draft value. This setup allows the Lakers to add Brooks without emptying their rotation.Los Angeles Lakers add a proven defender who can take pressure off LeBron James and Luka Doncic on the other end of the floor. Phoenix clears money and reduces a crowded wing group as it reshapes around Devin Booker. The third team turns contracts into picks and young depth.Dillon Brooks’ defensive rating and steady steal numbers stand out on a Lakers team that ranks near the bottom of the league defensively.Also read: NBA trade rumors: Boston Celtics could chase $107 million Milwaukee Bucks superstar to form stellar duo with Jayson Tatum The Risks InvolvedBrooks has dealt with minor injuries in recent seasons, and his outspoken style may not suit every locker room. His offense is limited, and he depends on stars to create shots. Still, if the Lakers want to make the most of the LeBron–Luka pairing right now, adding Dillon Brooks is a direct and practical move that addresses a clear weakness.","The los angeles lakers are exploring ways to improve a roster that still leans heavily on its stars.

Taylor Swift is reportedly scared of Travis Kelce's controversial past, ahead of their wedding

Taylor Swift’s boyfriend, Travis Kelce, is speculated to be retiring this season

Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce have had a pretty hard time this season as the Kansas City Chiefs have recorded a pretty average performance on the field this time.With the season coming to an end now, Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce seem to be focused on their wedding. But there is something that is reportedly bothering the billionaire pop star.A few weeks ago, Travis Kelce had confessed on his popular podcast, New Heights, about the time he was suspended when he was caught with marijuana in college.It seems Taylor Swift is really bothered by this confession. As per Radar Online, a source has revealed that, ""Taylor hates that this has become a talking point again. She's spent years crafting a clean, family-friendly image, and she's terrified that something from Travis's past could smear that.""A second source added, ""She's incredibly proud of how hard he's worked to turn his life around – but this story coming back up makes her feel exposed.”The source continued, “Taylor's brand thrives on control and positivity, and this just isn't part of that narrative.""However, neither Taylor Swift nor Travis Kelce has responded to these speculations as they continue to be tight lipped about their wedding.Travis Kelce has confessed that he had to go to a therapist after the marijuana incident in college.The popular tight end said, ""I had to sit down with a shrink for an hour a week…”Travis Kelce added, ""He got me to look at my life way more strategically. He got me to understand that you go through these emotions, and your reaction can either help you or hurt you or be indifferent.""Despite the obstacles that Travis Kelce faced in his life, he has proven his worth on the field and is easily one of the highest paid players in the league today and enjoys a massive popularity among fans.However, this season was a bit difficult for Travis Kelce as he got brutally trolled for his performance on the field, while Taylor Swift also looked upset as she cheered him on from her private suite along with her family and close friends.Travis Kelce is also speculated to opt for retirement at the end of this season but nothing has been confirmed yet as he is all set to take a decision in March after his contract ends with the team, the Kansas City Chiefs, after being with them for the last few years.Also Read: Taylor Swift reportedly focused on ""protecting"" her relationship with Travis Kelce as she stepped back from spotlight during the season","Taylor swift is reportedly scared of travis kelce's controversial past, ahead of their wedding.

Luke Rockhold questions Bo Nickal’s fighting credentials



Luke Rockhold GOES OFF on Bo Nickal: 'He hasn't done anything' | RAF 5

Luke Rockhold reacts to Bo Nickal’s RAF 5 comments



Luke Rockhold just shared his unfiltered opinion when asked about Bo Nickal ahead of RAF 5 in Sunrise, Florida. With a wrestling main event against Colby Covington approaching, the former UFC middleweight champion shifted attention to a rising prospect he believes has spoken far beyond his resume.The comments followed Nickal’s recent rebound win and his public belief that he deserved a larger spotlight at the event. Rockhold believes that Nickal’s confidence crossed a line. Still, his message was brutal and certainly bone-piercing.Luke Rockhold’s criticism centered on Nickal’s mindset and past performance. Speaking to MMA Junkie, he contrasted Nickal with veterans who have carried championship pressure. “Colby's been on top for a long time; he has a character, and he does what he does, but you know he's not a bad guy,” Rockhold said, adding that he is also not weak.He then turned his attention to Nickal. “There's guys like Bo Nickel out there talking too much. You quit. You don't have that fight in you. You're a competitor. You're not a fighter. I respect fighters, not competitors.”Rockhold pointed directly to Nickal’s loss against Reinier de Ridder at UFC on ESPN 67.“He quit against RDR,” Rockhold said. “Before the knee even hit him, you can see the breaking in his mind.” He added that Nickal’s habit of talking without high-level wins stood out. “You haven't done anything, you haven't beat anybody.”Tensions increased after Nickal suggested he deserved the RAF 5 main event over Rockhold and Covington. Rockhold addressed that directly, pointing to championships and years spent at the top. “The whole reason this sport is here, is on this stage, is because of us, and you haven't touched anything,” he said. “You're talking about two guys that have gotten gold. I've gotten a lot of gold in my life. And you've done nothing. ”Rockhold dismissed comparisons between collegiate wrestling success and elite MMA careers. “You're out here asking me when I've won. What have you won? Anything other than college?” he said. “Nothing matters until you're on a world stage.”He closed his remarks with a blunt message aimed at Nickal’s approach to the sport. “Just shut up, bite the bullet and get to work, and become a man.”As RAF 5 approaches, Rockhold faces Covington in the main event, while Nickal competes against Yoel Romero.Also Read: Floyd Mayweather's daughter Yaya Mayweather raises eyebrows with cryptic post seemingly aimed at NBA YoungBoy following their son’s birthday",Luke rockhold questioned bo nickal's fighting credentials ahead of raf 5.

Stefon Diggs and Cardi B’s nonstop drama emerges as a growing Patriots distraction ahead of the NFL playoffs despite Drake Maye’s elite MVP form,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/stefon-diggs-and-cardi-bs-nonstop-drama-emerges-as-a-growing-patriots-distraction-ahead-of-the-nfl-playoffs-despite-drake-mayes-elite-mvp-form/articleshow/126404396.cms,"Stefon Diggs, Cardi B (Getty Images)

New England Patriots face growing Stefon Diggs distraction before playoffs

Update:

The New England Patriots are winning games again, but the noise around them refuses to fade quietly. Foxborough has always known how to handle pressure. What feels new is how often football headlines now compete with celebrity drama. Inside the building, optimism runs high around a second-year quarterback who already looks like the future of the franchise. Outside it, the conversation keeps drifting toward social media clips, relationship rumors, and tabloid-style chaos that threatens to pull attention away from the field.That contrast defines this Patriots season. On one end is the wholesome image of Drake Maye’s inner circle, led by Ann Michael Maye, whose viral moments feel harmless and community driven. On the other is a constant swirl around Stefon Diggs and his superstar partner Cardi B, a storyline that never seems to cool down for long. The disconnect tests the calm culture Mike Vrabel is trying to protect.The uncomfortable truth is that the New England Patriots need Stefon Diggs, even when the attention becomes exhausting. Strip away the drama and the numbers tell a blunt story. Diggs was the engine of the passing attack, finishing with 1,013 receiving yards. No other wide receiver came close. Kayshon Boutte trailed by 462 yards, while tight end Hunter Henry ranked second overall with 768.Without Diggs’ explosiveness, Drake Maye’s ceiling drops fast.That is why patience exists where it normally would not. If Stefon Diggs carried a lower profile, the tolerance would likely be gone already. But playoff football is ruthless, and Maye needs a receiver who can flip momentum in a single snap if the Patriots want a legitimate Super Bowl push.The latest Stefon Diggs and Cardi B episode arrived at the worst possible moment, just as the postseason began. The rap icon clapped back at Diggs’ most recent accuser, extending a pattern that has followed the team all year, even after the couple welcomed their newborn son in November. It makes for viral content, not ideal preparation for chasing a Lombardi Trophy.That context made the Patriots’ timing feel deliberate when they released a mic’d up sideline exchange.""I can throw some blocks if you need,"" Diggs quips.""You need to shut the f**k up,"" Vrabel retorts.The exchange came across as playful, almost reassuring. The message was clear. Diggs is engaged. Vrabel is in control. Rookie lineman Will Campbell later praised Vrabel’s ability to connect with different personalities, reinforcing the idea of unity.Still, even the strongest coaches grow weary of constant off-field noise. As the Chargers loom in the Wild Card round, the Patriots know one thing for certain. Talent wins games, but distractions have ended more than a few championship dreams. Whether this one proves manageable will define how far New England Patriots really goes.Stefon Diggs has received an updated court date ahead of the playoffs. According to court documents, his arraignment has been postponed to February 13. The original date for his strangulation and assault charges was scheduled for January 23.Also Read: John Harbaugh's future: 3 possible landing spots for former Ravens' coach","New england patriots face growing stefon diggs distraction before playoffs.

Corey Perry placed on non-roster status by Los Angeles Kings

On Wednesday, the Los Angeles Kings said that forward Corey Perry had been given non-roster playing status, which means he can leave the team to deal with a family issue, and the company said that Perry is going home because someone in his family is sick, but they didn't say when he would be back or give any other details.The news comes at a very important time in the NHL season, when the Kings are trying to get into the playoffs in the Western Conference, and Perry's absence is a big change for the team because he has been a key part of the Kings' lineup as a veteran player and a competitive edge, and this news quickly made its way into the latest NHL news roundup, which got a lot of attention from fans all over the league.Corey Perry signed a one-year, $3.5 million contract with the Los Angeles Kings ahead of the 2025–26 campaign after his stint with the Edmonton Oilers. The 40-year-old forward missed the opening weeks of the season due to a preseason knee injury but returned to make a strong impact. In 35 games, Perry registered nine goals and 12 assists for 21 points, placing him among the team’s top contributors alongside Anze Kopitar.Following Perry’s departure, the Los Angeles Kings recalled forwards Andre Lee and Taylor Ward from their American Hockey League affiliate, the Ontario Reign, on an emergency basis.The call-ups are intended to provide immediate depth as the team prepares for upcoming NHL matchups during a tight schedule.Los Angeles currently sits in a Wild Card position in the Pacific Division, making every NHL match today crucial. While Perry’s time away is unrelated to on-ice performance or injury, his leadership will be missed in the dressing room. The Kings organization and fans alike have expressed support, with hopes that Perry will return once his personal situation allows.The organization emphasized privacy and support, asking fans to respect Perry and his family during this time.

Al Michaels addresses retirement talk as fan criticism grows



Al Michaels has heard the noise, but he is not backing away from the microphone. At 81, the legendary broadcaster remains the lead voice for Prime Video’s NFL coverage, even as social media scrutiny grows louder with every missed name or subdued reaction during key moments.Despite the criticism, Michaels insists he still belongs in the booth. With Prime Video drawing massive audiences and playoff games on the horizon, the veteran announcer maintains that his passion for calling NFL games has not faded.For decades, Al Michaels has been one of the most recognizable voices in sports broadcasting. From Super Bowls to weekly NFL matchups, his career has spanned generations. Now in his eighth decade, Michaels continues to call high-profile NFL games for Amazon Prime Video, a role that has kept him firmly in the national spotlight.That visibility has also brought increased criticism. Fans have pointed to recent on-air mistakes, including misidentifying Falcons running back Bijan Robinson during a December broadcast. In other instances, viewers have questioned his enthusiasm, particularly during high-leverage moments, fueling recurring calls for Michaels to retire.Michaels, however, made it clear in a recent conversation with Christopher “Mad Dog” Russo that he is not ready to step aside.“I always felt, ‘I’ll go as long as I can or I’m wanted,’ but I have to be able to know that I can do the game at the level that satisfies me,” Michaels said. “If I feel not what I have been or the way I perceive myself to have been, that’ll be time to step away. I don’t feel that way right now.”He also pointed to Prime Video’s strong viewership numbers, including a Christmas night NFL broadcast that drew roughly 21 million viewers, as proof that the coverage continues to resonate. Michaels emphasized that he still enjoys the work and believes his performance meets his own expectations.His stance mirrors comments he made earlier in the 2025 season to Sports Illustrated, where he said he felt “really good” and would be open to returning if Prime Video wanted him back. Michaels acknowledged the decision is a two-way process, but stressed that his desire to continue remains firm.While fan backlash has not disappeared, Prime Video has shown no public indication that a change is imminent. For now, Al Michaels remains behind the mic, confident in his ability and unwilling to let outside pressure define the end of his storied NFL broadcasting career.","Al michaels says he’s not ready to retire.

Trae Young’s bids an emotional farewell



Trae Young’s high-stakes move to the Capital



Trae Young’s move from Atlanta to Washington marks the end of an era, and the 27-year-old shared an emotional message before leaving. The 4-time All-Star is ready and geared up to start anew with Washington Wizards after being traded by the Atlanta Hawks. As per ESPN’s Sham Charania, this blockbuster deal sends Young to Wizards in exchange for CJ McCollum and Corey Kispert. The confirmation for this deal broke during the Hawks vs Pelicans on Wednesday when Trae Young was seen sitting on the bench in casual clothes after sustaining an injury last month against Trail Blazers.While Young departs as Atlanta’s all-time leader in assists and three-pointers, the trade follows months of speculation regarding his fit in Quin Snyder’s system and the Hawks' recent success during his injury-related absences.Trae was drafted as the 5th pick by Dallas Mavericks in 2018, but was traded to the Hawks on the same day and has been with with them since then. After spending seven seasons with Hawks, Trae surely had a lot to say before packing his bags.He started with quoting Jeremiah 29:11, “For I know the plans I have for you- declares the Lord.”“The last few years weren't how I wanted them to be. Expectations that we created for ourselves, reaching heights that Atlanta has never reached before.”said Young. “Bringing a championship to Atlanta was always my goal. However, between the injuries, the setbacks and situations that didn’t make sense, we never truly got to see our full potential.”Trae, appreciating the city of Atlanta wrote, “The city that raised me and taught me so much will always be a chapter in this story.” Ending the post Trae talked about his expectations towards the unseen future, “I’m walking to the next chapter ecstatic, with my head high and my eyes forward. It’s time to see what’s possible when the support is real and the vision is clear. We Move.”When the news of Trae’s trade broke out, the match between Hawks and Pelicans was reaching its climax, it seemed like it was also his career’s final point. Young was on the bench after getting sidelined with a quad contusion, and when he heard the news, he just walked towards the tunnel while sharing emotional goodbyes with training staff and fans. The last time fans saw him walking towards Hawks' locker room.For Wizards, this trade is an aggressive ""buy low"" strategy as by moving McCollum’s expiring contract, they gain a dynamic centerpiece who led the league in assists just a season ago. Despite Wizards' current 10-26 record, the front office views Young as the creative engine that will help them unlock the potential of their picks like Alex Sarr and Bilal Coulibaly. However, the move is not without its hurdles as Young is currently managing a quad injury with no expected return date. But with Trae’s ability and talents, easing in the Wizards’ roster will not be a big deal.Also read: “Too delicate”: Fans react to Anthony Davis’s hand injury in Mavs' close loss to Jazz",Trae young traded to washington wizards in exchange for cj mccollum and corey kispert.

Ric Flair’s net worth in 2025 and what it reflects

Ric Flair’s wrestling career, earnings, and endorsements

Ric Flair is still one of the most famous names in the history of wrestling. Well into his post-ring prime decades later, the “Nature Boy” still draws eyes with appearances, branding agreements, and a seemingly never-ending coverage of his life and career. But as legendary as he is, Flair's net worth in 2025 paints a much more complex picture than many fans would expect.Years ago, Flair made millions when wrestling boomed, but behind the scenes, financial realities have changed his wealth. A combination of medical expenses, lifestyle spending, and failed business ventures. Combined, they tell the tale of why one of wrestling's all-time greats is often associated with a surprisingly small fortune in his name to this day.One of the finest WWE wrestlers in the world today, Ric Flair’s net worth in the year 2025 is reported close to around $500,000. That number is especially notable for a competitor who held world championships with various promotions and headlined dozens of major events. Thus, financial analysts and wrestling historians alike attribute this to a mixture of high personal expenses during his prime, numerous divorces, and huge medical expenses after a few health crises.ID@undefinedCaption not available.ID@undefinedCaption not available.Even Flair has been open about living the high life, which matched what fans saw on TV. We made this point before, that image solidified his spot in cultural history, but also boxed in his long-term wealth compared to some other big-name athletes who took a more traditional investment approach.Flashy Ric Flair character through NWA, WCW, and WWE, a 16-time world champion, and a two-time Hall of Famer. Flair made a great deal of money throughout his career from top payouts, television, merchandise, and advertising.His income increased after wrestling through endorsements and licensing deals. The guy's visage and catchphrases have graced clothing, collectibles, energy drinks, and pop culture crossovers. Of course, contracts back in the wrestling days sometimes restricted long-term royalties, so a great deal of those nostalgically iconic moments may not have earned the same continuously rolling money as fans might expect.Over the past several years, Flair has embraced brand-forward initiatives. They've ranged from restaurant concepts and cannabis partnerships to drink collaborations, all of which leverage his name for a new generation. In reality, a handful of projects picked up hype early on, while other projects deal with existential crises due to operational complexity or public outcry.Also Read: Bron Breakker and Izzy Dame combined net worth: WWE contracts, endorsements, brand deals, and more","Ric flair's net worth in the year 2025 is reported close to around $500,000.

What’s next for Anthony Davis and Mavericks?



In the last few minutes of Dallas Mavericks vs. Utah Jazz at Delta Center, things went from bad to worse for the Mavs. They faced a double blow as they not only dropped a close-contested game to Jazz but also had their star center, Anthony Davis, headline another injury report.With just three minutes left on the clock in the fourth quarter, Davis, while defending Jazz’s #23 Markkanen, suffered a left hand injury. Though he tried to remain on the court for another minute, the pain seemed too much, and he had to exit the hardwood. His absence from Mavs' defense in the last few moments was definitely something that the fans didn't anticipate, but his injury was within their scope.The Mavericks’ 114-116 loss to Jazz marks their 24th loss of this season, and it was definitely not a sight they wanted to see after their last two consecutive wins against Rockets and Kings. With three minutes left in the fourth quarter, Mavs’ rising rookie, Cooper Flagg, went for a jump shot but missed it, giving the opposition possession of the ball.Jazz were 2 points down, and when Anderson got the defensive rebound, he sent it straight to Sensabaugh, and then Markkanen, who went for a drive in with Davis on defense and converted it. But Davis was seen clutching his left hand. Bad news for the Mavs front office, but the internet got its fodder.One fan commented, “Every season, the same fear.” The second fan wrote, “He needs a new trainer - too delicate.” “Bro there is no way. He's never get a max,” the third fan said.Understanding, Davis might be sidelined due to this, a fan commented, “Hate to see this… prayers up.” While another fan went on and called AD, “Bro be so fragile…” A fan, in frustration, even went on to say, “He needs to retire I said this last year.”Davis and injury have been a combo that no one likes in this league, especially the teams’ front offices. He finished the night with 21 points, 11 rebounds, and 4 assists, with 10 shots made from the field. But his exit from the game brought back the Day-to-Davis narrative as fans voiced their frustration over his untimely injuries and inconsistency.The NBA trade deadline is nearing, and rumors about Davis’ trade have been swirling around. The front office of the Dallas Mavericks will be open if any potential offers approach them. Although Davis remains a player with game-changing potential, his inconsistency and constant battles with injuries add a layer of anxiety. He has only played in 20 games this season. Having him on the court is like either a hit or a miss, and that is something the Mavs would love to avoid as they want to build an NBA championship team around their rising rookie superstar, Cooper Flagg.Also read: “She’s my rock”: Thunder superstar Shai Gilgeous-Alexander’s heartfelt tribute to wife, Hailey Summers, leaves fans emotional","Anthony davis suffered a left hand injury in dallas mavericks' 114-116 loss to utah jazz.

Tarik Skubal trade buzz grows as New York Yankees search for ace help

Tarik Skubal is back in the middle of MLB trade rumors, and this time the New York Yankees are one of the teams being talked about. In early January 2026, reports out of the United States said the Yankees are actively looking for a starting pitcher because Gerrit Cole is not expected to be ready for the start of the season after Tommy John surgery.The Yankees need help fast. Their front office has been speaking with teams across baseball. With Edward Cabrera already traded to the Chicago Cubs on January 7, the Yankees are now being linked to Tarik Skubal, Freddy Peralta, and MacKenzie Gore as they try to fix their rotation before spring training.Tarik Skubal, the Detroit Tigers’ left-hander and two-time Cy Young Award winner, is entering the final year of his contract.Earlier this week, U.S. media reported that Skubal and the Tigers failed to agree on a new deal and went to arbitration. That move quickly sparked trade talk around the league.MLB insider Jon Heyman said this week that any team wanting Skubal would need to give up “half their team.”That comment made it clear how highly Detroit values its ace. Skubal has been one of baseball’s best pitchers over the past two seasons, and the Tigers are in no rush to move him unless the return is massive.The New York Yankees are watching closely. With Gerrit Cole still rehabbing and not expected back in April, New York is exploring every possible top-level arm.While Skubal fits the need, league insiders believe the price may be too steep, even for a team known for bold moves.With Skubal likely costing a huge package, the Yankees have also shifted strong focus to Freddy Peralta and MacKenzie Gore.Freddy Peralta, the Milwaukee Brewers’ All-Star right-hander, is also in the final year of his deal. He is coming off a big season where he went 17–6 with a career-best 2.70 ERA and led the National League in wins.MacKenzie Gore, the Washington Nationals’ left-hander, is another name in talks.Unlike Peralta and Skubal, Gore has three years left on his contract, which gives Washington leverage but also makes him a long-term option for any team that trades for him.The Yankees were previously linked to Edward Cabrera, but that path closed when Miami traded him to Chicago.Now, New York is weighing whether to pay big in prospects for a star like Skubal or make a cleaner move for Peralta or Gore.If no deal happens soon, the Yankees are expected to open the season with Max Fried, Luis Gil, Will Warren, and Cam Schlittler while waiting for Gerrit Cole, Carlos Rodón, and Clarke Schmidt to return from surgery.Also Read: MLB Trade Rumors: Ketel Marte Trade Buzz Grows As New York Yankees, Chicago Cubs, And Los Angeles Dodgers Watch Arizona Diamondbacks","Tarik skubal, the detroit tigers’ left-hander and two-time cy young award winner, is entering the final year of his contract.

Jake Savicki says Aaron Judge does not show true leadership traits

Aaron Judge is once again in the middle of a big baseball debate. This time, it is not about home runs or contracts. It is about leadership. On Wednesday, in the United States, MLB content creator and coach Jake Savicki said he does not believe Aaron Judge is a true leader, even though Judge has been the New York Yankees captain since the end of the 2022 season.Jake Savicki shared his thoughts on the latest episode of his “Hold My Ball” podcast. His comments quickly spread across social media. With Aaron Judge also set to lead Team USA at the 2026 World Baseball Classic, the timing of the statement made even more people stop and listen.Speaking on Wednesday’s podcast episode, Jake Savicki made his view very clear. “I don’t think Aaron Judge is a leader,” Savicki said.“I think there’s very little emotion he shows. You can’t just make a leader out of a guy. If he’s not a natural leader, then you’re not going to get a leader out of him.”Savicki explained that, for him, leadership is not only about numbers on the field. He said there is a big difference between being a great player and being a vocal, emotional presence in the clubhouse.To explain his point, he brought up Los Angeles Dodgers infielder Miguel Rojas. Savicki said players like Rojas give something extra that does not always show in stats.“There’s leaders that produce, and then there’s leaders like a Miguel Rojas,” Savicki added. “There’s a reason he was even in that game.”Savicki was talking about the 2025 World Series. Miguel Rojas did not play in the first five games. Dodgers manager Dave Roberts put him in Game 6 mainly for defense.But in Game 7, Rojas changed everything. He hit a game-tying solo home run off Toronto Blue Jays closer Jeff Hoffman in the ninth inning.Later, he made a game-saving defensive play. The Dodgers went on to win the game in 11 innings.Savicki said moments like that show leadership in action. In the same episode, Jake Savicki also questioned how the New York Yankees are building around Aaron Judge.“Why haven’t they signed Tucker already? Why haven’t they signed Belly already?” Savicki asked, referring to Kyle Tucker and Cody Bellinger.“Why haven’t they signed Bo Bichette? Why haven’t they signed Alex Bregman? What are they doing?” Savicki said the Yankees are wasting Aaron Judge’s best years.He also criticized the team’s handling of top prospect Spencer Jones, saying the young outfielder has played well in the minors but has not been given real chances.“They’re called the Evil Empire for a reason,” Savicki said. “People are enjoying the fall of the Yankees.But I like baseball, and I want to see Aaron Judge get what he deserves.” Aaron Judge has won major personal awards and broken records.But he has reached the World Series only once. That came in 2024, when the Yankees lost to the Los Angeles Dodgers in five games.Also Read: MLB Trade Rumors: Ketel Marte Trade Buzz Grows As New York Yankees, Chicago Cubs, And Los Angeles Dodgers Watch Arizona Diamondbacks",Jake savicki says aaron judge does not show true leadership traits.

Why Dalton Kincaid’s availability matters for Buffalo

Also Read:

The Buffalo Bills have received a major boost ahead of their AFC Wild Card playoff clash against the Jacksonville Jaguars. Tight end Dalton Kincaid, who has been dealing with a knee injury, is expected to be available for Sunday’s crucial game.Kincaid’s fitness has been closely monitored all week after he was listed as a limited participant in practice on Wednesday and Thursday. The tight end missed Week 17 due to the knee issue but returned in Week 18 against the New York Jets, easing concerns about a long-term setback.On Friday, Bills head coach Sean McDermott provided encouraging news. According to reports, Kincaid is expected to be removed from the injury report entirely, meaning he will not carry any game-day designation. This strongly suggests that the Bills are confident in his health heading into the playoffs.Kincaid has been one of the most reliable targets in the Bills’ offense when healthy. He caught 39 passes for 571 yards and five touchdowns in 12 games this season, making him a critical safety valve for quarterback Josh Allen.The figures make it plain how much he affected things. Buffalo scored more than 30 points a game when Kincaid was on the field, but only 23 points per game when he wasn't.It's important to note that all of Allen's interceptions this season happened when Kincaid wasn't on the field. This shows how important the tight end is to keeping the offense consistent.Kincaid also posted one of the best efficiency numbers among NFL tight ends, recording a passer rating of over 149 when targeted. That kind of production is difficult to replace, especially in a playoff environment.The Jaguars’ defense has struggled against tight ends throughout the season, ranking near the bottom of the league in yards allowed to the position. This could work in Buffalo’s favor, especially if the Jaguars succeed in slowing down the Bills’ strong rushing attack.With Jacksonville expected to focus heavily on stopping the run, Kincaid could be used frequently on short and intermediate routes. Along with fellow tight end Dawson Knox, he gives the Bills flexibility in both blocking and passing situations.All signs point toward Dalton Kincaid playing on Sunday. While the Bills will still monitor his knee closely, the expectation is that he will be fully available and involved in the game plan.As Buffalo looks to break through in the postseason, having one of its most dependable offensive weapons healthy could make a significant difference in a tightly contested playoff matchup against Jacksonville.","Dalton kincaid is expected to be removed from the injury report entirely, meaning he will not carry any game-day designation.

Dinah Mattingly’s net worth, investments, and more

NBA Hall of Famer Larry Bird is one such player who is well known for his excellent psychological play. The Boston Celtics drafted Bird in the 1978 NBA Draft, and he played with the Celtics for 13 seasons, winning three NBA championships with the team. Bird is the only player to have been named Rookie of the Year, MVP, Finals MVP, All-Star MVP, Coach of the Year, and Executive of the Year, and still to this day holds that position. Bird started playing basketball young during his college days, as he was attending Indiana State University, where he played three years for the Sycamores, before being selected in 1978 by the Boston Celtics.

Bird spent most of his NBA career playing for the Boston Celtics for 13 seasons, where he led the team to the NBA Finals five times and won three Championships with them. Ever since entering the NBA, Bird began a rivalry with yet another NBA legend, Magic Johnson.

Bryson DeChambeau won’t quit golf for YouTube thinks Michael Kim



Bryson DeChambeau looks for ways to challenge himself



There has been much discussion about Bryson DeChambeau's future, particularly since Brooks Koepka left LIV. The 5x major champion’s contract with LIV ran through 2026, but he left earlier. Notably, with DeChambeau’s contract coming to an end in 2026, many wonder what he will do next. Many anticipate he will take up content creation on a full-time basis. Michael Kim, a pro on the PGA Tour, isn't entirely persuaded.Kim commented under an X post, hinting that the LIV golfer might be a full-time YouTube golfer who only performs in major events.“Idk Bryson well, but he is a golf competitive psycho. YouTube has been great for him, but I have a very hard time believing that just YouTube will fulfill that competitiveness. They both need each other, and I would be shocked if they don’t get a deal done.”There are more than 2.56 million subscribers on Bryson DeChambeau's YouTube channel, with over 244 videos, and his videos have gained more than 500 million views. Each video receives 2 million per video. The LIV golfer's fame as a YouTube sensation has only increased over time.He enjoys a variety of challenges, such as the Break 50, Random Club Challenge, and Shot Cup Challenges, to make his content engaging and enjoyable.However, DeChambeau invites fellow golfers, YouTubers, athletes from other sports, and celebrities. Among the celebrities that have made appearances in his videos are Kevin Hart, Adam Sandler, Donald Trump, Jason Kidd, Phil Mickelson, and John Daly.This gave some fans and observers the impression that he could abandon professional golf in favor of a full-time career in entertainment. Michael Kim, however, disagrees. He feels it's improbable that DeChambeau will quit LIV and concentrate only on YouTube because of how competitive he is.DeChambeau is known for being a fiercely competitive professional golfer. He even took a unique physics-based approach to become one of the biggest drivers in golf. In 2021, the American professional declared that he would keep improving his skills in a ""relentless pursuit of excellence.” Therefore, he might not give up on competitive golf that easily. But the conclusion of the contract discussions will also have an impact.“Because I could just do YouTube golf and be totally fine as well,” is what DeChambeau said in an interview with Flushing It Golf.“I mean, look, it’s confidential. I’m not going to share too much, but the conversations are in process. We have to get to a place where both parties have a good understanding of one another. It is getting to a place that makes sense for both sides,” he claimed.Bryson DeChambeau discussed a mental quality that, in his opinion, keeps him concentrated under duress. In a Bryan Bros Golf video uploaded on December 29, 2025, the 2x US Open winner said that he tries to create a competitive atmosphere even when creating YouTube content.DeChambeau said, “That’s why I do YouTube challenges in content creation because it keeps me locked in.” That’s his way of getting comfortable in the most uncomfortable situations.A clean divorce from LIV Golf seems improbable for someone like Bryson DeChambeau, as Michael Kim's analysis highlights. While YouTube continues to grow its influence, the need for real competition may keep it tied to the Saudi-backed league.Also read: Bryson DeChambeau and Lilia Schneider combined net worth: LIV Golf earnings, endorsements, and relationship buzz","Bryson dechambeau's contract with liv golf runs out in 2026.
