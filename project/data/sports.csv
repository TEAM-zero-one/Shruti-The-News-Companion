John Tavares' uncertain future with Maple Leafs as free agency looms and changes mount,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/john-tavares-uncertain-future-with-maple-leafs-as-free-agency-looms-and-changes-mount/articleshow/121500451.cms,"The Toronto Maple Leafs face a defining offseason, with John Tavares' future uncertain (Image via AP)

Maple Leafs leave the door open for John Tavares, but change may be inevitable

A major pay cut may be the only path to staying in blue and white







As the Toronto Maple Leafs enter one of their most defining offseasons in recent memory, the focus is shifting squarely onto the status of captain John Tavares. With several key players heading into free agency, the franchise faces a crucial crossroads, and decisions made this summer could reshape the team for years to come.General manager Brad Treliving has confirmed that the team is still considering bringing back the veteran forward. However, he remained tight-lipped when pressed about the specifics of potential contract offers, saying only that “the door is open” regarding John Tavares’ return.The 34-year-old Tavares has expressed a strong desire to stay in Toronto, a city where he’s served as captain since 2019. But in the world of NHL free agency, loyalty often takes a backseat to business — and there are legitimate questions about whether the Leafs are ready to keep that door open long-term.Tavares' performance declined this past season, particularly in the playoffs, where his production lagged when it mattered most. After another early postseason exit — this time in Game 7 of the second round against the Florida Panthers — frustration from both fans and front office staff has reached a boiling point.Tavares is coming off a massive $11 million annual salary, a contract that once symbolized the Maple Leafs' championship aspirations.If he is to stay, a pay cut will likely be necessary. With other stars like Mitch Marner also in contract limbo, every dollar counts.Treliving’s comment leaves the possibility open, but Toronto may decide that a new direction is necessary. “The door is open,” he said — but it's clear that both the organization and the player must compromise for that door to remain open.With a roster packed with talent but no deep playoff runs to show for it, the Leafs are staring down the reality that this group may have peaked. Whether John Tavares is part of the solution or a symbol of what needs to change is the looming question.","The toronto maple leafs face a defining offseason, with john tavares' future uncertain.

"""Typical man"": Josh Allen sparks curiosity among fans with bizarre golf bag ahead of wedding to Hailee Steinfeld",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/typical-man-josh-allen-sparks-curiosity-among-fans-with-bizarre-golf-bag-ahead-of-wedding-to-hailee-steinfeld/articleshow/121501572.cms,"Josh Allen's mysterious bag in wedding week photo with Hailee Steinfeld fuels wild fan theories (Getty Images)

What’s in the bag? Josh Allen’s odd accessory steals spotlight in Hailee Steinfeld wedding buzz







The buzz around the NFL this weekend isn’t about training camps, trades, or touchdowns. Instead, all eyes are on what many are calling the NFL wedding of 2025 — as Buffalo Bills quarterback and reigning NFL MVP Josh Allen prepares to marry actress and fashion icon Hailee Steinfeld . The pair, often spotted hand-in-hand in Hollywood hotspots and front-row at major fashion events, have officially transformed into one of the league’s most high-profile power couples. Now, their whirlwind romance is culminating in a lavish California wedding, drawing media attention from coast to coast.Fresh off throwing “pretty balls” to wide receiver Elijah Moore at the Bills’ offseason OTAs, Allen made a swift exit from practice to fly west — and the paparazzi were hot on his trail. He was seen arriving at the airport, dressed in casual travel gear, hauling an eye-catching Malbon golf bag and a matching nonchalance. The twist? His bag didn’t seem to hold a full set of clubs — just a single, possibly treasured putter.For most folks, that would raise eyebrows. But in Allen’s world, it might just be another day of living the dream. Considering his $330 million NFL status and his growing reputation as a passionate amateur golfer, it’s likely that he already has a full set of clubs waiting at his California estate — the very home where he and Steinfeld got engaged and reportedly spend a good portion of their time.""Typical man"" behavior, some might say — squeezing in one final round before exchanging vows. After all, Allen’s bachelor party reportedly featured exclusive golfing experiences, including a VIP appearance at Tiger Woods’ TGL event in Florida. That lone putter could either be a sentimental favorite or a fresh addition to his gear, but it definitely hints at some pre-wedding swings — possibly his own version of calming nerves before the big day.As for Steinfeld, the Sinners star and rising fashion mogul has seamlessly blended red carpet glam with Allen’s laid-back athletic charm, and together, they’ve become a tabloid favorite. Their relationship has been defined by understated elegance, with neither shying away from the spotlight, yet both guarding their private moments with class.This weekend, however, privacy might be hard to come by. The ceremony is expected to draw an A-list guest list from both the NFL and Hollywood, as the couple celebrates their union under the California sun. It’s a collision of cleats and couture, touchdown passes and timeless romance.Whether or not Allen sneaks in one last putt before “I do,” one thing’s for sure — his next biggest highlight won’t be on a football field, but at the altar with Hailee Steinfeld.Also Read: With the NFL's deepest QB room, is it wise for the Browns to target another experienced quarterback in a trade?","Buffalo bills quarterback josh allen and hailee steinfeld are getting married this weekend.

Patrick Mahomes says Travis Kelce is working harder than ever heading into 2025 season

Travis Kelce’s unfinished business after Super Bowl loss is fueling his fire





Despite whispers that the 2025-26 season might be “the last ride” for Travis Kelce , Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes isn’t buying it — and he has good reason not to.As Kelce nears his 36th birthday, fans and analysts alike have speculated whether this season could be his swan song. After all, in NFL years, that age often signals the beginning of the end. But according to Mahomes, the future Hall of Famer isn’t showing any signs of slowing down — mentally or physically.Speaking to reporters during a recent media session, Patrick Mahomes was asked whether this year feels like Travis Kelce’s final season. His answer left little room for doubt.“If it's the last ride, you would never know,” Mahomes said. “I mean, the way he's talking about football, the way he's talking about working and trying to be even better this year than he was last year. He doesn't seem like a guy that it's his last ride, like he's tired of the job.”Mahomes added that Kelce is approaching this offseason with renewed energy, emphasizing that his body feels “better than even last year.” The tight end’s motivation, he explained, appears stronger than ever — not just for personal records, but for team success.Kelce’s own words also echo that sentiment. On the New Heights podcast he co-hosts with his brother Jason, Travis admitted that the Chiefs’ recent Super Bowl loss played a big role in his decision to return.“I think I would have thought about it more if we would have won,” Kelce said. “I feel like I owe the guys that I come into the building with a whole lot more effort and focus.”While he admitted he wasn’t at his best during the big game, that disappointment has seemingly turned into fuel for another championship run.Also Read: Did Travis Kelce nearly quit the NFL over mom Donna’s health?

NEW DELHI: India’s batting mainstays Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma, along with ace spinner Ravichandran Ashwin, have retired from Test cricket, while star pacer Mohammed Shami will miss the crucial five-match series in England due to fitness issues. All eyes are now on the Shubman Gill-led Indian side, widely regarded as one of the most inexperienced teams to tour England in recent memory.Without the presence of Kohli and Rohit, India's batting line-up appears notably depleted. Could the selectors have considered recalling experienced campaigners like Cheteshwar Pujara or Ajinkya Rahane to strengthen the top order?During a recent interview, Pujara was asked whether Gautam Gambhir had reached out to him regarding the England tour.""No, not yet,"" Pujara told Lallantop when asked, ""Have you received a phone call from Gambhir yet?""Also See: PBKS vs RCB IPL Qualifier 1 Live Score The 103-Test veteran expressed his readiness to return if given the opportunity.""I am ready.

The first Test against England is scheduled to begin on June 20 in Leeds.""Last year or so we have looked at Shubman (for leadership).

Brandin Podziemski had successful surgery on his left wrist

The Golden State Warriors have recently confirmed that Stephen Curry’s teammate, Brandin Podziemski, underwent successful surgery on his left wrist. The team announced that the 22-year-old had a debridement procedure in Los Angeles this week. He is expected to fully recover and return in time for training camp. The surgery, done on Podziemski’s shooting hand, may offer clarity on his post-season shooting slump with the Warriors.Brandin Podziemski quietly played through significant discomfort during the Golden State Warriors' postseason run. According to the Warriors' official release, the young guard had successful left wrist debridement surgery and is on track to be ready for the 2025-26 season.“Brandin Podziemski underwent successful left wrist debridement surgery yesterday in Los Angeles. He is expected to make a full recovery and be ready for the start of training camp,” the Warriors wrote on X.Orthopedic specialist Dr. Nirav Pandya explained on social media that wrist debridement involves the removal of inflamed or scar tissue within the joint, helping to improve mobility and healing.The timing of this surgery now raises questions about Podziemski’s playoff performance.After shooting a solid 44.5% from the field and 37.2% from three during the regular season, his postseason numbers dropped to 36.4% overall and 32.8% from deep. The shooting dip became more noticeable in the Western Conference Semifinals against Minnesota, where he converted just 9 of 40 shots (22.5%) through the first four games.Despite the struggles, Podziemski still had moments of brilliance, most notably a 28-point performance against Houston in Game 4 of the first round and another 28-point effort in the season-ending loss to the Timberwolves. But the pain may have affected his consistency. In his own words, after his Game 4 outburst, Podziemski reflected on his mindset:""First, you got to tell yourself you belong in the moment. Good and great players want to be in the moment, thrive in the moment, don't back down from it.""""Everything I do, I'm never going to have a regretful decision. I'm just going to go out there and know and tell myself I belong, because I do.""The Warriors rode a strong finish into the playoffs, with Podziemski part of a revamped starting lineup that included Stephen Curry, Draymond Green, Moses Moody, and Jimmy Butler. That unit helped the team finish 48-34, eventually defeating the Rockets in seven games before bowing out to Minnesota.Also Read: Tyrese Haliburton earns massive praise from Los Angeles Lakers legend Magic Johnson after creating history in Indiana Pacers’ Game 4 win against New York Knicks Now entering his third season, Podziemski remains under contract through 2027.

Tom Brady thrives post-Gisele Bündchen divorce with Italian flair





Even in retirement, Tom Brady refuses to stay off the scoreboard—on or off the field. Two years after his high-profile divorce from Gisele Bündchen, the NFL legend is rewriting his own playbook, turning heads from Venice, Italy to Las Vegas, Nevada.Tom Brady, who was recently spotted throwing footballs in the narrow streets of Venice, surrounded by a group of admiring Italian women, the NFL legend looked every bit the icon he’s always been. The seven-time Super Bowl champion seemed relaxed and energized—no pads, no stadium, just the streets of Italy and a perfect spiral. The moment felt like a metaphor for his post-NFL life: unconventional, enviable, and still centered around football.While his former partner Gisele Bündchen is forging her own path, Brady’s journey since their 2023 split has been all about reinvention. Beyond becoming the most decorated quarterback in league history, he’s now a powerful media figure and NFL investor.Brady's record-breaking $375 million contract with Fox Sports made waves, solidifying him as the highest-paid sports analyst ever. His debut as a broadcaster was on the grandest stage possible—the Super Bowl—surpassing household names like Greg Olsen and Tony Romo.But Brady’s influence isn’t limited to television. As a minority owner of the Las Vegas Raiders, he’s reportedly taken an active role in shaping the team’s future. The franchise’s recent decisions—including hiring veteran coach Pete Carroll and drafting standout running back Ashton Jeanty—have Brady’s fingerprints all over them.“Tom Brady has already hit a home run with Ashton Jeanty before he takes an NFL snap,” one source noted, hinting at the quarterback's eye for talent and leadership.Also Read: Gisele Bündchen’s $400M empire: How the supermodel rebuilt her life after divorce with Tom Brady and welcomed baby no. 3 Away from the gridiron, Tom Brady’s life has taken on a new rhythm.

Will Howard over Aaron Rodgers — the Steelers’ most polarizing decision yet







The Pittsburgh Steelers, long known for their consistency and playoff presence, are entering a critical turning point. With the 2025 NFL season approaching, the franchise has made a stunning shift at the most important position. Rather than pursue proven veteran Aaron Rodgers, the Steelers appear ready to roll with rookie Will Howard, a sixth-round pick who’s never taken a snap in the NFL.Bleacher Report recently ranked the best quarterback options for Pittsburgh, and the verdict raised eyebrows across the NFL. Will Howard topped the list ahead of Rodgers with analyst Brent Sobleski calling the rookie a “win-win” choice. According to the logic, either Howard shines unexpectedly, or the team’s struggles result in a high 2026 draft pick. For a franchise like Pittsburgh, that thinking is borderline heresy.This isn’t just a coaching decision, it’s a philosophical shift. The Steelers, once allergic to losing, now seem open to the idea if it means solving their long-term quarterback dilemma. It’s a gamble that flirts with tanking, whether the team admits it or not.Aaron Rodgers, though aging, remains one of the few quarterbacks who can elevate a roster overnight. Overlooking him in favor of an untested rookie not only risks on-field failure but could also create tension in the locker room and among the fanbase. Players want to win now. Fans expect it. Is the front office prepared for the fallout?Pittsburgh’s identity has always been about fighting, not folding.But this QB decision suggests the organization might prefer a controlled collapse over continued mediocrity.

One thing’s for sure: the Steelers aren’t just betting on a quarterback. They’re betting their legacy on him.

Parris Campbell's future in doubt after George Pickens trade



Steelers trade WR George Pickens to the Cowboys | NFL Insider breaks down what led to the move

Cowboys face tough roster decisions ahead of 2025 NFL season







The Dallas Cowboys made a big move by trading for wide receiver George Pickens this offseason. This could make their offense much stronger. But with Pickens joining the team, some players might lose their spot. One player who could be affected is Parris Campbell. Fans are wondering if Campbell will stay on the team or if the new addition means changes are coming.T he Cowboys’ trade for George Pickens isn’t just a flashy headline, it’s a decision that may force the team to restructure their wide receiver room. According to Mike Fisher of Athlon Sports, Campbell could be the odd man out when the team finalizes its 53-man roster.“Many in Cowboys Nation were desperate for a more reliable and 'explosive' second-option receiver to CeeDee,” Fisher noted. “You got your wish in the massively important - and risky - trade for George Pickens.”Campbell has quietly built a solid NFL résumé. His best year came in 2022 with the Indianapolis Colts, where he notched 63 receptions for 623 yards and three touchdowns. Overall, he’s recorded 1,117 receiving yards and six career touchdowns, a respectable output considering injury setbacks and limited roles.But in Dallas, opportunity comes with competition. With George Pickens now slotted as a top-tier option alongside CeeDee Lamb and Brandin Cooks, there may not be much room left for Campbell in the Cowboys’ offensive scheme.The Dallas Cowboys' roster is shaping up to be one of the most dynamic in the league but it could come at the cost of losing experienced contributors. Whether Campbell gets released, traded, or somehow manages to fight his way into a backup role, the impact of the George Pickens trade is undeniable.Also Read: Miami Dolphins reluctant to trade Jalen Ramsey due to his expensive contract and trade market challenges As the Cowboys push for a title, these tough calls are part of the game. But if Pickens doesn’t deliver, cutting Campbell could be a decision Dallas regrets.

Dallas Mavericks considering multiple guard options

What this means for the Mavericks’ future





Theface a critical offseason decision after Kyrie Irving’s ACL injury left their backcourt in disarray. With Irving sidelined until at least January 2026, the team is exploring veteran options, withemerging as a top target.Kyrie Irving’s season-ending ACL injury has forced the Mavericks to reassess their guard rotation. Before the injury, Irving was a key contributor with averages of:- 24.7 points per game- 4.8 rebounds per game- 4.6 assists per gameMedical experts suggest a potential January 2026 return, but no guarantees have been made. This leaves Dallas in a tough spot, especially with Irving’s contract negotiations pending. The team must decide whether to rely on his long-term recovery or seek immediate reinforcements.The Dallas Mavericks have been linked to Chris Paul, who just completed a surprisingly durable season with the San Antonio Spurs. At 40 years old, Paul played all 82 games for the first time in his career, posting solid numbers:NBA insider Marc Stein reports that Dallas sees Chris Paul as an ideal stopgap. His leadership, playmaking, and ability to mentor younger guards make him a strong fit. Additionally, his willingness to accept a veteran minimum deal would help the Mavericks manage their salary cap.While Paul is a leading candidate, the Dallas Mavericks are also exploring other options:- Jrue Holiday (Trade Target) – A proven two-way guard who could bolster Dallas’ defense.- Lonzo Ball (Health-Dependent) – A high-risk, high-reward option if he recovers fully from his knee issues.However, Chris Paul’s durability and experience give him an edge in Dallas’ search for stability.Irving’s injury has forced the Mavericks into a contingency plan. If they sign Paul, they gain a proven floor general who can keep them competitive in the West while Irving recovers. His presence would also ease the pressure on Luka Dončić, allowing the Mavericks to remain playoff contenders.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Golden State Warriors predicted to sign $46,500,000 Dallas Mavericks big man to boost Stephen Curry's title odds The coming weeks will be crucial as Dallas weighs its options.

Strong defenses and smart offenses help Chiefs and Broncos stay in fight

The 2025 NFL season is almost here, and every fan is excited. Some teams look strong. Others still have work to do. This list is about the best all-around teams, the ones with the strongest rosters. Each team was graded by position: quarterback, defense, line, and more. The rankings also looked at injuries and off-season changes. Some good teams like the Commanders and Bengals didn’t make the list. But these ten teams stood out from top to bottom.The Philadelphia Eagles are at number one. They lost some players in free agency, but their core is still strong. Jalen Hurts is protected by a great offensive line. He also has Saquon Barkley and top receivers like A.J. Brown. Even if their defense lost names, they have enough young talent to stay strong. Their roster is deep and well-built.At number two are the Baltimore Ravens. Lamar Jackson leads an offense that added Derrick Henry. Their defense had ups and downs last season but got better at the end. Safety Kyle Hamilton is a star. The rookies they drafted on defense could play big roles. The Ravens don’t have many weak spots. If injuries stay away, they’ll be tough to beat.Third are the Detroit Lions. Talent is in abundance, even besides the new coordinators. Jared Goff had a nice season, and he still has elite weapons in Amon-Ra St. Brown and Jahmyr Gibbs. Their defense should improve as injured players return. Rookie DT Tyleik Williams adds depth. This team could take the next step if the pass rush improves.Also Read: Tom Brady And Patrick Mahomes Could Face Off In LA2028 Olympic Flag Football As NFL Legends Target Gold The Kansas City Chiefs might have lost big in the Super Bowl, but they still rank fourth. Patrick Mahomes leads a new-look offense with fresh receivers. Travis Kelce and Chris Jones still play at a high level. The defense added talent through the draft. If the new players step up, the Chiefs will stay contenders.Buffalo comes next. The Bills didn’t make this list last year, but now they do. Josh Allen is in his prime. The offense has talent at every spot. The defense took some hits, but it’s still good enough to keep games close. Special teams are a concern, but overall, this roster is loaded.The final team on this list is the Denver Broncos. Their defense is elite maybe the best in the league. Bo Nix looked good in his rookie year. Courtland Sutton and Evan Engram help him on offense. There are questions about their running backs, but the O-line is strong. If Nix grows in Year 2, the Broncos could surprise people.The 2025 NFL season has many strong teams, but only a few have the full package. From top to bottom, these 10 teams look ready. Great quarterbacks, deep defenses, and smart front offices make all the difference. Some good teams missed out, but this list shows who’s built to win now.","The 2025 nfl season has many strong teams, but only a few have the full package.

Michael Jordan’s reported $40 million NBC salary debunked,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/michael-jordans-reported-40-million-nbc-salary-debunked/articleshow/121346918.cms,"(Image Source - Getty Images)

Michael Jordan’s new NBC role and What’s has been confirmed so far

When Michael Jordan declared his return to the NBA scene —not as a player, but as a special contributor for NBC’s upcoming NBA coverage — rumors began to swirl. The most outrageous? That NBC had enticed the Chicago Bulls legend back with an unbelievable $40 million per year deal, making him the highest-paid sports analyst ever. But is that figure correct? Let’s distinguish fact from fiction.NBC revealed on May 12, 2025, that Michael Jordan will be part of its NBA broadcast team as a special contributor when the network gets back the NBA broadcasting rights for the 2025–26 season through an 11-year, $76 billion agreement. Jordan shared his enthusiasm, saying, “I am so excited to see the NBA back on NBC.”Another thing to note is that the specifics of Jordan's position are not entirely clear. Reports suggest that his main contributions will be pre-recorded segments shown during pregame and halftime, rather than live commentary. This limited role has sparked questions about the legitimacy of the reported $40 million annual pay.If the $40 million number is right, it would beat Tom Brady’s $37.5 million yearly deal with Fox Sports, making Jordan the highest-paid sports analyst ever. But, neither NBC nor Jordan’s team has verified this figure.Considering Jordan’s small role and his lack of experience in broadcasting, experts in the industry are doubtful about how accurate this number really is.Additionally, with Jordan's impressive net worth—around $3.5 billion, thanks to his thriving partnership with Nike's Air Jordan brand and various other business endeavors—the financial aspect might not be the main reason he's coming back to the NBA limelight.It looks like NBC is using Jordan to attract old fans and grow their audience for NBA games. Since he spent a large part of his playing career with NBC, watching the network replay all six of his Chicago Bulls titles feels nostalgic for fans who have followed him closely.Even though the precise information regarding Jordan's role and salary is not public, his engagement is likely to improve NBC's NBA coverage, which will also showcase notable figures like Mike Tirico, Noah Eagle, Jamal Crawford, Reggie Miller, and Carmelo Anthony.Michael Jordan's return to the NBA as a special contributor for NBC has created a lot of excitement. However, the claim that he's making $40 million a year hasn't been verified and seems a bit off considering his expected role.Also Read: LeBron James and Luka Doncic could get the center they desperately need and Celtics fans won’t like it While fans are eager to see his contributions to the broadcasts, the actual details of his contract are still a bit of a mystery.

NEW DELHI: Preity Zinta ’s cheerful smile quickly faded into visible concern as the Punjab Kings suffered a nightmarish start in their IPL 2025 Qualifier 1 clash against Royal Challengers Bengaluru.

Trump threatens to revoke federal funding from California over transgender high school athlete

'Totally ridiculous situation!!!' Trump threatens California's funding over transgender athlete

In a pivotal moment for high school athletics, 16-year-old AB Hernandez, a transgender athlete from Jurupa Valley High School, has become the center of a nationwide debate on gender identity and sports fairness. Her qualification for California's state track and field championships in events like the triple jump, long jump, and high jump has ignited discussions that extend far beyond the track.Hernandez's participation, permitted under California's 2013 law allowing students to compete according to their gender identity, has faced criticism from various quarters. President Donald Trump publicly condemned her inclusion, labeling it ""totally demeaning to women and girls,"" and threatened to withhold federal funding from California unless the state barred her from competing. This stance aligns with his Executive Order 14201, signed in February 2025, which seeks to ban transgender women from participating in women's sports teams across educational institutions.In response to the escalating controversy, the California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) introduced a ""pilot entry process"" for the state championships. This initiative allows an additional cisgender female athlete, who narrowly missed qualification, to compete in events where a transgender athlete has qualified.The CIF emphasized that this measure aims to balance inclusivity with fairness, ensuring that no athlete is displaced.Governor Gavin Newsom supported the CIF's approach, describing it as a thoughtful resolution to a complex issue. He highlighted the importance of inclusivity and fairness in competition, especially amid rising anti-trans sentiments nationwide. However, critics argue that the policy creates a dual standard and may be discriminatory, while supporters believe it addresses concerns without compromising the rights of transgender athletes.The U.S. Department of Justice has also entered the fray, launching a Title IX investigation into California's policies on transgender athletes. The probe examines whether allowing transgender athletes in girls' sports constitutes sex-based discrimination, focusing on the CIF and specific school districts involved.As the state championships approach, Hernandez remains focused on her performance, stating, ""All I can do is go out there and compete and just do my best."" Her resilience amid the controversy underscores the broader societal challenges at the intersection of sports, identity, and policy.This unfolding situation in California reflects a microcosm of the national debate on transgender rights and sports, highlighting the need for nuanced discussions and policies that respect both inclusivity and fairness.","16-year-old ab hernandez, a transgender athlete from jurupa valley high school, has become the center of a nationwide debate on gender identity and sports fairness.

'I don't want to be a one-season wonder': Punjab Kings' Shashank Singh

RCB vs PBKS, IPL 2025, Qualifier 1: Quick singles from Mullanpur





NEW DELHI: Punjab Kings’ all-out attacking strategy spectacularly misfired on Thursday as they were bundled out for a paltry 101 by Royal Challengers Bengaluru in Qualifier 1 of IPL 2025 at the Maharaja Yadavindra Singh International Stadium in Mullanpur.On a pitch where hitting through the line was far from easy, Punjab’s gamble to go hard from ball one proved costly. Their innings lasted just 14.1 overs.RCB’s pace trio of Josh Hazlewood (3/21), Bhuvneshwar Kumar (1/17), and Yash Dayal (2/26) set the tone early, before leg-spinner Suyash Sharma (3/17) ran through the middle and lower order with his deceptive googlies.Notably, this was Punjab Kings’ first playoff appearance since 2014 — but it turned into a forgettable one.RCB star Virat Kohli celebrated every wicket with wild energy, and wife Anushka Sharma , watching from the stands, was seen smiling at both Punjab’s sloppy show and Kohli’s animated reactions.The collapse began with in-form opener Priyansh Arya miscuing a cover drive off Dayal. Prabhsimran Singh (18 off 10) followed next over, edging Bhuvneshwar after two cracking boundaries.Skipper Shreyas Iyer — key to PBKS’ success this season — threw his wicket away with an ill-timed slog off Hazlewood, and fellow Aussie Josh Inglis soon fell to a short ball from the same bowler.The middle order panicked, continuing to play risky shots. Marcus Stoinis (26 off 17), Shashank Singh, and debutant Musheer Khan all fell attempting slog sweeps against Suyash’s turning deliveries.While Punjab’s batting failed miserably, they might find some hope in their league-stage win over KKR at the same venue, where they defended 111 on a similarly challenging pitch.","Punjab kings were bowled out for 101 by royal challengers bengaluru in qualifier 1 of ipl 2025 at the maharaja yadavindra singh international stadium in mullanpur.
