NEW DELHI: Former India all-rounder Yuvraj Singh has spoken openly about the reasons that led to his retirement from cricket in June 2019. Yuvraj stepped away from international cricket and the Indian Premier League after being left out of India’s squad for the ODI World Cup that year.The decision marked the end of a long and emotional journey in the sport he had played since childhood.Yuvraj, now 44, said he no longer felt happy playing the game. He explained that the lack of respect and support around him played a major role in his decision.""I was not enjoying my game. I had a feeling that why am I playing cricket when I'm not enjoying it? I was not feeling supported. I was not feeling respected. And I felt, why do I need to do this when I don't have this? Why am I lingering on to something that I'm not enjoying? Why do I need to play? To prove what? I can't do more than this, mentally or physically, and it was hurting me. And the day I stopped, I was myself again,"" Yuvraj shared during a recent podcast with former Indian tennis star Sania Mirza Yuvraj also looked back at an earlier phase of his life when doubts were raised about his talent.""Now, when I look back at it, I just think he didn't have the time to have a proper look at me. He was just like being nice to my dad. Then obviously, he was playing for India at that time, so he probably would have said that. I was 13-14 at that time, just figuring out a sport. I don't take it personally, but my father took it personally,"" he said.",Yuvraj singh will retire from international cricket in june 2019.

Sanju Samson headache for Team India | Is Ishan Kishan the right choice?

Poll Do you think Sanju Samson should be dropped from the playing XI? Yes, he needs to be replaced. No, he deserves more chances.

NEW DELHI: Sanju Samson’s frustrating run with the bat continued in the ongoing T20I series against New Zealand, with another start going unconverted — and this time, batting legend Sunil Gavaskar did not hold back. The former India captain delivered a stinging on-air assessment after Samson was bowled for 24 off 15 balls in the fourth T20I, calling out glaring technical flaws that, in his view, summed up the wicketkeeper-batter’s struggles.Chasing a daunting 216 at the ACA-VDCA Cricket Stadium, India were under early pressure after losing Abhishek Sharma and captain Suryakumar Yadav cheaply. Samson initially looked promising, striking three crisp boundaries and a six to briefly steady the innings. However, just as he appeared to be finding his rhythm, New Zealand skipper Mitchell Santner struck, sneaking one through to rattle Samson’s stumps.Gavaskar, on commentary, immediately zeroed in on what he felt was the root cause of the dismissal — Samson’s footwork, or lack of it.“My first impression is that there was no footwork at all. Not very sure whether there was any turn.First impression was he was just standing there making room and playing through the offside,” Gavaskar said, offering a blunt initial diagnosis.After reviewing the replay, Gavaskar doubled down, expanding on the technical lapse that has repeatedly hurt Samson against spin.“Like I said, hardly any movement of the feet. Going outside leg-stump, once again exposing all three stumps and when you miss, the bowler's gonna hit, and that's what happened to Sanju Samson the second time around,” he added.The 24-run knock was Samson’s highest score in the series so far, following earlier failures of 10, 6 and 0, but it did little to ease the scrutiny. With Ishan Kishan impressing at No. 3 earlier in the series and the T20 World Cup at home drawing closer, pressure is mounting rapidly on Samson to justify his place in the XI.","Sanju samson was bowled for 24 off 15 balls in the fourth t20i in visakhapatnam.

Back story:



NBC Sports ’ Mike Florio reportedly calls Bill Polian top suspect

Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy reportedly calls Bill Polian liar and coward

NFL Insider Ari Meirov posted on X: “From the ESPN report: Bill Polian was a vocal figure in the Hall of Fame deliberations involving Bill Belichick, with Spygate and Deflategate coming up among voters during discussions.Per a voter who spoke anonymously, Polian — the former [Buffalo] Bills and [Indianapolis] Colts GM and longtime Patriots rival — told some voters he believed Belichick should “wait a year” as penance for Spygate.”An hour later, Sports Illustrated’s Matt Verderame posted on X: “I just spoke on the phone with Bill Polian and asked whether he was an influence on Bill Belichick being snubbed by the Hall of Fame. His quote: “That’s totally and categorically untrue. I voted for him.”NFL Insider Adam Schefter reported on X that the eight-time Super Bowl-winning head coach is not a first ballot Hall of Famer. He fell short of the 40 out of 50 votes [80% necessary] needed for induction to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility.Now that the North Carolina Tar Heels coach did not make the ballot; despite possessing one of the most successful coaching careers in NFL history, people may have started to look for loopholes or for who did not vote for the New England Patriots legendary coach.NBC Sports’ Mike Florio said, “There are some tangible theories as to what happened. I’m gonna put a pin in that to focus on the Bill Polian angle. It was prominently mentioned in the story from ESPN.com: Reportedly, Polian was leading the charge and would be the one most likely to do so. He’s the top suspect if you’re looking at the 50-vote.Who’s the one with the biggest axe to grind against Bill Belichick? It’s the guy who did battle with Belichick most often throughout the decade of the 2000s. It’s the guy who tried to get the rules changed, new point of emphasis for illegal contact with receivers and the Peyton Manning offense…”Dave Portnoy calls Belichick’s snub absurd and says, “This is what happens when you create a society of losers, of people who refuse to acknowledge greatness, who complain, make excuses, [---], and [---].Bill Polian is certainly a leader amongst those. He’s a liar and a coward. He’s somebody who could never beat the [New England] Patriots; they changed the rules of football because of Bill Polian. They couldn’t beat the Patriots. They whine, they complain, much like after the Patriots beat the [Denver] Broncos in bad weather.”Portnoy shared that when great teams win, everybody looks at them and feels they cheated or did something wrong. The Patriots “kicked our [---] for two decades. It wasn’t Spygate, it wasn’t Deflategate, it’s none of that. You got to look in the mirror.”The founder says there are people who won’t look themselves in the mirror and say, ‘I can’t beat that guy. I have to get better. I have to be the best I can be. Hats off to that team.’","Nbc sports’ mike florio said, “there are some tangible theories as to what happened. I’m gonna put a pin in that to focus on the bill polian angle.

Todd Monken named Browns head coach: What it means for the team



After weeks of searching, the Cleveland Browns have finally found their new head coach. The Browns went with experience over youth, hiring a coach who has a solid track record. The team decided to go with experience instead of youth by hiring a coach who has a proven record of success. The Browns chose to hire a coach with experience rather than a younger, less proven candidate. For fans who have seen many changes over the years, Todd Monken’s hiring gives hope for some stability and a clear plan for the team.At 59, Monken is older than most first-time NFL head coaches. But his long experience in both college football and the NFL makes him a strong choice to lead the Browns. However, his long experience in both college football and the NFL makes him a strong and reliable choice for the team. His work as Baltimore’s offensive coordinator shows he can lead high-powered offenses, a skill the Browns hope will help turn their team around.Todd Monken was officially announced as Cleveland’s head coach on Wednesday, according to ESPN’s Adam Schefter. He spent the last three seasons as the Ravens’ offensive coordinator, helping Baltimore rank fourth, third, and 11th in scoring during that time. Monken’s offense used Lamar Jackson’s versatility and Derrick Henry’s power to create one of the league’s most effective attacks.Cleveland’s coaching search had included younger candidates like Grant Udinski, Chris Shula, Nick Scheelhase, and Mike McDaniel. When those options fell through, Monken became the best available choice. His combination of experience and readiness made him an attractive option for a team looking for immediate stability.The Browns aren’t starting from scratch. Defensive coordinator Jim Schwartz has helped the Browns build one of the NFL’s top defenses. Since 2023, the team has allowed the fewest yards per game (298.6) and made it hardest for opponents to get a first down on third down (33.8%). With such a strong defense, Monken can focus on improving the offense without changing much on defense.Monken’s main challenge will be balancing the strong defense with a modern, flexible offense. If he gets it right, the Browns could finally become a team that wins consistently. The hire also impacts Baltimore, as the Ravens now need to fill the gap Monken leaves behind, and it changes the dynamic of the coaching carousel in the NFL.For a team with only three playoff appearances since 2000, Monken’s hiring is a step toward stability and growth. Browns fans will be waiting to see if his experience can turn promise into results.","Todd monken was officially announced as cleveland’s head coach on wednesday.

Cincinnati Bengals facing inevitable decision on Trey Hendrickson



Ocho PHONE CALLS Bengals Front Office to find a TRADE for Trey Hendrickson! Unc OVER IT! | Nightcap

The Cincinnati Bengals enter the offseason at a turning point after a frustrating previous year’s campaign that failed to meet expectations. While Joe Burrow and the offense remain the foundation of the franchise, the defense has become the raising concern. Nowhere is that more evident than in the pass rush, where uncertainty surrounds one of the most productive defenders in team history.Trey Hendrickson’s future in Cincinnati appears increasingly bleak, and all signs suggest the Bengals are preparing for life without him. With free agency approaching and younger edge rushers still developing, the situation places added pressure on the front office to reshape a unit that once anchored the defense.ESPN’s Ben Baby framed the situation as increasingly decisive. “Once again, the Bengals will have to make a decision on Hendrickson’s contract,” Baby wrote. “But unlike in previous years, this one is much clearer. The odds are very slim that Cincinnati and Hendrickson, who is arguably the best free-agent signing in franchise history, will find a path forward.”Cincinnati tried to delay this outcome a year ago by placing the franchise tag on Hendrickson before agreeing to a one-year, $29 million deal for the 2025 season.The move bought time but did little to resolve the larger question of long-term value versus age and durability. Hendrickson’s 2025 season, cut short by injury amid the team’s overall struggles, only complicated matters further.Even at 31, Hendrickson is still one of the league’s most reliable pass rushers. What he did in Cincinnati doesn’t need much explanation. He posted back-to-back 17.5-sack seasons and wrapped up his time with the Bengals with 61 total sacks. Over five seasons, he made four Pro Bowls and earned first-team All-Pro recognition, making him one of the most successful free-agent additions in franchise history.Still, the Bengals appear ready to turn the page. Myles Murphy and Shemar Stewart represent the next wave on the edge, even if neither is yet a finished product. Financial flexibility and long-term planning seem to outweigh the appeal of retaining a veteran star, especially as Cincinnati looks to rebalance its roster after a disappointing year.Hendrickson is expected to draw strong interest on the open market and should land a sizable deal elsewhere. For the Bengals, his departure would likely result in a compensatory pick in the 2027 NFL Draft. It is a small return for a player who defined their pass rush for years, but one that reflects where the franchise stands.After five seasons and a long list of achievements, Trey Hendrickson’s run in Cincinnati is likely coming to a close, marking the end of a highly productive chapter and the beginning of a risky but necessary transition for the Bengals’ defense.","Trey hendrickson’s future in cincinnati appears increasingly bleak.

Ben Roethlisberger wants Mike McCarthy to be given a chance

Big Ben & Charlie Batch talk Mike McCarthy as Head Coach, Future of the Steelers and more! Ep 119



Mike McCarthy background and connection with Aaron Rodgers

Former Dallas Cowboys head coach Mike McCarthy has big shoes to fill in Pittsburgh after Mike Tomlin’s departure following 19 years. Steelers Nation holds deep love and boundless respect for Tomlin. He has an impeccable 19-year streak of non-losing seasons with 193 wins, 114 losses, and two ties.Imagining someone capable of filling those shoes and representing Steelers Nation seems almost impossible. If someone from the Pittsburgh team vouched for the new head coach, maybe then Steelers Nation would consider it. That is where two-time Super Bowl champion Ben Roethlisberger steps in.“Do you think that was the biggest issue with McCarthy? Is that his age? Like from the fans’ perspective.” Roethlisberger said on his Footbahlin podcast. “There’s Pittsburgh ties there, that should trump a lot of things. I know people want this overhaul, and this new guy...He [McCarthy] is a new breath in the sense that his message is gonna be completely different. He bled black and gold as a kid. Isn’t that all you want for a head coach? A guy that went to that school. To me, that trumps so much! I might take a guy, as a head coach of this team, that has a heart and bleeds for this team more than a guy that is just this offensive-minded genius…There’s something about that that people are not getting. They just want this whole new shakeup… I think people are nuts.Give this guy a chance. He’s got a proven track record… I’m mad that people don’t give this guy a chance because he wants this job. I want everyone to call in and tell me how wrong they were in three years.”McCarthy was born and grew up in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. His mother was a secretary and worked in restaurants. His father was a firefighter. He attended Bishop Boyle High School and went to Baker University, where he was a two-time all-conference tight end for the Baker Wildcats. In 1987, after going undrafted, he earned a bachelor’s degree in business administration.McCarthy’s football coaching journey began at Fort Hays State in 1987 as a graduate assistant. He then served as a graduate assistant for the Pittsburgh Panthers college football team, where he also served as a wide receivers coach.The 62-year-old coach entered the NFL as an offensive quality control coach for the Kansas City Chiefs in 1993. He was the Chiefs’ quarterbacks coach for three years, until 1998. Then, the same position for the Green Bay Packers in 1999. He became the New Orleans Saints’ offensive coordinator in 2000 and served for four years.He was the Saints’ offensive coordinator for a year, then in 2006, he was promoted to head coach of the Green Bay Packers. There, he met Pittsburgh Steelers former quarterback Aaron Rodgers [now a free agent]. Reportedly, McCarthy expressed a strong desire for Rodgers to return as his quarterback.McCarthy coached the Packers until 2018. He took a coaching break in the 2019 NFL season. Then for four years, he served as head coach of the Jerry Jones’ Dallas Cowboys, led by signal-caller Dak Prescott.The Super Bowl XLV champion spent the 2025 season away from coaching, which was when Rodgers joined Pittsburgh. On Jan. 24, 2026, he was hired as the Steelers’ 17th head coach. His record as head coach is 174-112-2.","Mike mccarthy has big shoes to fill in pittsburgh after mike tomlin’s departure.

The move signals the Steelers’ intent to bring in experienced coaching to support their receiving group and help develop emerging talent.Henry’s prior connection to Steelers head coach Mike McCarthy, from their time together with the Dallas Cowboys, provides a degree of familiarity that could support a smooth transition into Pittsburgh’s system. The Steelers’ wide receiver group has depth considerations beyond DK Metcalf, and the team will look to strengthen the position through free agency and the draft.Among Henry’s immediate priorities is working with 2024 third-round pick Roman Wilson. The Michigan product has shown some potential, and with the right guidance, the coaching staff hopes he can improve and contribute more regularly to the offense.Although there are challenges, Henry’s experience in developing players should help him work well with both veteran and younger receivers. He will also focus on helping the group gel, improve timing with the quarterback, and become more dependable targets in the passing game. How the Steelers’ leadership and coaching staff collaborate will also influence how the receiving group performs.Henry’s coaching, combined with the Steelers’ roster moves, will play a key role in strengthening the wide receiver group. With a mix of experienced players and young talent, the team will work to get the best out of everyone while filling any gaps in the lineup. Over time, his guidance could help the team build a more consistent and productive passing attack in Pittsburgh.","The pittsburgh steelers are expected to hire adam henry as their wide receivers coach, according to nfl network’s cameron wolfe.

Jason Gregor believes that Toronto Maple Leafs are done with their season with no playoff hope

The Maple Leafs' playoff window appears to have slammed shut. Following a devastating 7-4 loss to the Buffalo Sabres on Tuesday night, Toronto finds itself eight points adrift of the Eastern Conference wild card positions. This loss marked the end of a devastating five-game run at the ScotiaBank Arena.Despite being the home side, Toronto could only get one point off an OT loss against the Red Wings last week. But while the losses have surely hurt the Maple Leafs’ pride, with just 57 points across 53 games, an even bleaker future remains for the franchise as they stand seventh in the Atlantic Division.The Maple Leafs have had a tough run since the season began. But their performance since the winter break ended has been horrible. Hockey analyst Jason Gregor even believes that with just 29 games remaining, Toronto might be missing the postseason this year.He didn't mince words about Toronto's situation. ""Leafs unofficially eliminated from playoffs last night?"" Gregor wrote. ""They are 8 pts back of MTL, BUF, and BOS now. With Florida also ahead of them. Will be interesting to see how they approach the deadline and the off-season.""The Leafs trail Montreal, Buffalo, and Boston, all sitting at 65 points, for the final playoff spots as the Panthers add another obstacle ahead of them in the standings.The Leafs had already failed to get a win in their last four games as they entered yesterday’s game as the obvious underdogs.But while everyone knew the Sabres were in red-hot form, Rasmus Dahlin’s first career hat trick made sure that Buffalo got their 19th win in their last 23 games. But while the away team got to extend their unbeaten run, Joseph Woll emerged as the victim last night.The netminder was only able to make 24 saves out of the 28 shots he faced, while the Leafs’ offense was unable to stand up to Dahlin’s scoring. With playoff hopes effectively extinguished, general manager Brad Treliving faces a critical decision at the March 6 trade deadline.Does Toronto embrace a seller's role and capitalize on expiring contracts, or attempt a retool around its core? The Maple Leafs have multiple players who turn UFA at the end of the season, so it will be smart for Toronto to offload some of their biggest contracts before March 6.Deeper roster decisions loom around players like Oliver Ekman-Larsson, Conor Timmins, and Dakota Joshua. The Leafs embark on a six-game road trip beginning Thursday in Seattle, where they'll attempt to salvage pride from a season that's spiraled into disaster.","Toronto lost 7-4 to the buffalo sabres on tuesday night.

James Reimer STANDS TALL As Ottawa Senators HANDLE The Columbus Blue Jackets, Extend Point Streak!

As James Reimer was traded to save the goaltending situation of the Ottawa Senators, the goalie will start in net for the Senators in their matchup against the Colorado Avalanche on Wednesday night. However, Linus Ullmark will also join, but only as a backup, as he is still working on following his return from a personal leave of absence.Head coach Travis Green told reporters on Tuesday that Ullmark was ready to play on Sunday if needed and that the goaltender would let the organization know when he’s ready to start.Earlier, the Ottawa Senators signed James Reimer to a one-year contract to help strengthen the club’s goaltending situation in the absence of starter Linus Ullmark. The club announced on January 11, 2026, that Reimer had signed a one-way contract for the remainder of the season, with an average salary of $850,000. Ottawa Senators’ goaltender James Reimer is set to feature against the Colorado Avalanche with Linus Ullmark in backup. As per reports, Reimer, 37, was signed for the remainder of this season on Jan. 12. He has a 1-2-1 record since joining the Senators with an .871 save percentage and 3.32 GAA, and has a 14-8-5 record this season with an .881 save percentage and 2.95 goals against average.The 37-year-old goalie played for the Buffalo Sabres and the Anaheim Ducks last season. Reimer went 10-8-2 with a 2.90 goals-against average and .901 save percentage in 22 games (19 starts) with Buffalo, and 0-2-0 with a 4.50 GAA and .864 save percentage in two starts with Anaheim.According to the NHL, Reimer was selected in the fourth round in the 2006 NHL Draft.

How LIV Golf landed Rolex: $12B PGA Tour sponsor signs deal but avoids full branding rights,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/international-sports/how-liv-golf-landed-rolex-12b-pga-tour-sponsor-signs-deal-but-avoids-full-branding-rights/articleshow/127727695.cms,"How LIV Golf landed Rolex $12B PGA Tour sponsor signs deal but avoids full branding rights (Image via Getty)

What the Rolex agreement means for LIV Golf’s future

LIV Golf has secured a surprising partnership with luxury watch brand Rolex. The deal links one of the PGA Tour’s biggest sponsors with LIV Golf, but with clear limits. Rolex will not appear as a full on-course sponsor at LIV Golf events. Instead, the agreement focuses only on premium hospitality access. The move signals growing acceptance of LIV Golf while also showing that major brands remain cautious. According to reports shared by golf industry insiders, Rolex will not place its iconic clocks on LIV Golf courses.This is a major shift from its long-standing role on the PGA Tour, where Rolex branding is highly visible. The agreement allows Rolex customers to attend LIV Golf events through exclusive hospitality experiences. It does not include broadcast branding, on-course signage, or title sponsorship rights. This structure protects Rolex’s global image while still testing a relationship with LIV Golf. For LIV Golf, even a limited association with a $12 billion brand is seen as a major step forward. The league has recently retained top players and continues to push for Official World Golf Ranking status.The Rolex deal shows that LIV Golf is attracting interest from elite sponsors, even if cautiously.By focusing on hospitality rather than branding, Rolex avoids public alignment with the league’s ongoing disputes with traditional golf bodies. At the same time, LIV Golf gains validation by partnering with a luxury brand trusted across professional sports. Industry analysts note that this type of deal could open the door to similar partnerships. Other sponsors may follow with low-risk agreements before committing fully. For LIV Golf, this approach builds credibility without forcing brands into controversial exposure. It also strengthens LIV Golf’s appeal to high-end fans who value premium experiences.LIV Golf's contract with Rolex solidifies the assumption that LIV is on solid ground. This contract backs many LIV players like Rahm and DeChambeau to remain committed to LIV Golf for the long term. Other players, like Koepka, went back to how they played before LIV Golf. As this loyalty has been essential in keeping LIV Golf moving forward at such a crucial time, we know that if LIV Golf earns an Official World Golf Ranking, the commercial value of LIV Golf will skyrocket, and this may lead Rolex and others to increase their future sponsorship involvement. For now, Rolex and LIV Golf have a selective relationship regarding this partnership that is a good sign for LIV Golf's future. The Rolex limited partnership, combined with some of the professional golf world's previous reluctance to partner with LIV Golf, demonstrates how much progress LIV Golf is making in the professional game of golf. There is a lot of cautious optimism about how the major brands perceive LIV Golf in their respective sponsorship strategies.","Liv golf has secured a surprising partnership with luxury watch brand rolex.

Sharing of life and joint wealth perspective of Annie Verret

One of the most recognized couples in the golf arena is Jordan Spieth and his wife Annie Verret Spieth, who balances in-course wins with a more normal personal life and good work off course. Jordan is one of the wealthiest golfers worldwide with his three majors and regular competition on the PGA Tour, and in the family affairs and charity, Annie, his long-term partner and supporter, is behind the scenes. The cumulative net worth of both shows their combined excellence in the field of athletics as well as their common interest in other causes outside the links.By 2026, Jordan Spieth's net worth is estimated to reach approximately $120 million, earned from tournament winnings and other sources of income, such as endorsement deals and business ventures. He has won 13 PGA Tour and three major championships (Masters and the U.S Open) in his successful career on the PGA tour and this is one of the major earnings in his career.Besides the prize money in the course, Spieth also makes more than enough by making high-profile endorsements with international companies like Under Armour, Titleist, Rolex, AT&T, NetJets, SuperStroke, and more. These collaborations have been claimed to make tens of millions of dollars over the decades and are a significant portion of his yearly earnings.In addition to playing and sponsorship, Spieth has also diversified his wealth by investing in and launching strategic ventures, such as an interest in sports media and technology businesses.Although Jordan is the breadwinner, Annie Verret Spieth plays a major role in the publicity of the couple and the common financial portrait.

LeBron James’ strong return fuels belief that his NBA journey is far from over amidst his sciatica injury

LeBron James’ leadership and production continue to define his greatness even at 41

LeBron James has emphasized his intense dedication to longevity once more. James continues to modify his lifestyle in an effort to achieve high performance at a time when other athletes have long since retired. While recuperating from an early-season sciatica ailment, he also made a big dietary adjustment.In an effort to relieve pressure on his back and joints, LeBron has drastically reduced his weight and quit consuming alcohol throughout his rehabilitation, according to ESPN's Dave McMenamin. The decision was made during a difficult period earlier in the season when he was momentarily hindered by injury and had to take some time off from the court to ponder. Instead of slowing down, James intensified his efforts.LeBron James missed the first game of the season for the first time in his 23-year career due to sciatica, which kept him out of action for the first 14 games. Since James's demise is unavoidably near, JJ Redick had the chance to observe what would happen in the future, and he soon received his response.The Los Angeles Lakers had a lot of issues at the beginning of the season, but Luka Doncic and Austin Reaves performed admirably and led the team to victories that kept them close to the top of the Western Conference.Even though many questioned James due to his advanced age, he was actively practicing for his return to the court during that time.After the summer vacation, the injury, and the years that are unquestionably there, LBJ's poor start to the season was to be expected. However, he has demonstrated remarkable form in recent weeks, persuading many that this cannot be his last season.Even a return to the Cleveland Cavaliers would be a feasible option, according to ESPN's Dave McMenamin. He added that if James decided to return to Cleveland for his 24th NBA season and third stint with the organization, the Cavaliers would be happy to welcome him back this summer, according to numerous team and league sources who spoke with ESPN.McMenamin added:“There's no telling the ride the Lakers could still go on this spring, especially if James can find that cape to put back on. While James is eight years older, he has shown a similar commitment to this season's Lakers team, sources said…”He continued:“He missed the first 14 games because of sciatica. But James stopped drinking alcohol during his rehab, and he has slimmed down considerably, hoping to take pressure off his back and joints and to ""keep up with the young guys..”As the season went on, the choice was a part of a larger physical reset meant to enhance recuperation, conditioning, and durability. It also demonstrated how carefully James maintains every aspect of his body at this late stage of his career.Talking about James, star forward Kevin Love said of those 2017-18 Cavs:""We weren't supposed to make it that far… I mean, you look at the makeup of that team and the inexperience, even more so. It wasn't a team that really had enough of a supporting cast to make it to that level.. But because LeBron took us there and put us on his shoulders, we were able to get to that point.""James has continued to be a key player for the Lakers on both ends of the court despite turning 41 during the season. He has continued to put in a lot of work, be the team's emotional leader, and contribute often as a scorer and playmaker.LeBron James, 41, is still one of the NBA's best players in his 23rd season, averaging 22.4 points, 6 rebounds, and 6.7 assists per game.","Lebron james missed the first 14 games of the nba season due to sciatica.

The Cup Series’ Daytona 500 is the most anticipated NASCAR race of the year. But with drivers like Tony Stewart stepping in, the Truck Series seems to be leaving a bigger impression. A lot of viewers are actually more eager for the 250-mile event. Not because of the brutal and intense races happening in the series, but because of the legendary and seasoned Cup Series drivers that will be back. Tony Stewart's first appearance in the series in more than 20 years is the focus of all the excitement.Although his experience was thought to be a dominating factor in the race, new drivers have just been revealed, and one of Jimmie Johnson's LMC drivers will also compete.John Hunter Nemechek, who has recorded a few top-10 finishes with Legacy Motor Club over the past two years, will make a unique appearance in the Truck Series at Daytona with Halmar Friesen Racing. He will be driving the #62 Toyota for the event, and DriveValue.com is sponsoring his limited entry with the squad. It would be an understatement to say that he is eager for the race.“I’m really excited to get back behind the wheel in the Truck Series, especially at a place like Daytona,” Nemechek stated.“I’m extremely grateful to Halmar Friesen Racing and Stewart [Friesen] for the opportunity to drive the No. 62 Toyota. Daytona is such a special track, and any time you get the chance to compete there, it means a lot. I’m looking forward to making the most of this opportunity and having a strong run with the support of HFR and DriveValue.com.”This will be Nemechek’s 150th race start in the Truck Series. It’s safe to say he has a lot of experience, as in the past decade, he has won 13 races in the series. While Tony Stewart is well-known for having an extended career in the Cup Series, his Truck Series numbers are fewer than Nemechek's.Stewart’s Cup Series experience was the only thing that set him apart in the Truck Series field this year at Daytona. Nevertheless, the participants’ list seems to be getting updated every few days. Henderson Motorsports announced Corey LaJoie, their unique competitor, before John Hunter Nemechek made his announcement. The veteran has raced 276 Cup Series races over the past decade, making him one of the most seasoned drivers on the Truck Series field at Daytona. Furthermore, in the nine Truck races he ran in 2025, LaJoie finished 7th in the top 10. Truly a legendary run.His more recent experience in the series will prove to be helpful, particularly when racing against Tony Stewart. Both of them, along with John Hunter Nemechek, will make the Truck Series race at Daytona an interesting run this year.","Tony stewart's first appearance in the series in more than 20 years is the focus of all the excitement.

Vancouver Canucks continue to have one of their worst seasons ever

The Vancouver Canucks' nightmare season reached a new low on Tuesday night. A 5-2 defeat to the San Jose Sharks extended Vancouver's misery to three consecutive losses and dropped their record to a dismal 17-31-5.The loss capped another forgettable night at Rogers Arena, where the Canucks have managed just one victory through the first six games of their eight-game homestand. Elias Pettersson, who registered two assists in the losing effort, offered a brutally honest assessment of his team's struggles.""I think there are a lot of things that need to be better,"" Pettersson said. ""I think our structure can be better. I think when there's time to make a play, we need to make a play, and then that leads to the next play and the next play."" When asked to specify what needs improvement, Pettersson's answer was telling: ""Pretty well everything.""The Canucks' problems were evident from the opening minutes. After Tom Willander gave Vancouver an early lead just 1:15 into the game, San Jose responded with three goals in a devastating 4:04 span.Kevin Lankinen surrendered three goals on six shots before coach Adam Foote mercifully pulled him at the 5:55 mark of the first period.Nikita Tolopilo allowed two goals on 27 shots in relief as the Sharks extended their lead to 5-1 before Filip Hronek's third-period power play goal provided a consolation marker.The goaltending disaster came hours after Vancouver announced that Thatcher Demko will miss the remainder of the season following hip surgery, leaving an already depleted roster scrambling for answers between the pipes. Pettersson acknowledged the team's repeated failures without making excuses.""Every time we lose, it sucks,"" he said. ""We've been on that side a lot this year. We've just got to find a way or it's going to be... it's hard to put into words,"" he said. “I mean, obviously we're trying. Coach is trying; we're all trying. We're not going out to just give up. But we have to be better.""The numbers paint a grim picture.
