Poll What are your thoughts on Yuzvendra Chahal's choice of attire at the divorce hearing? Inappropriate and disrespectful A bold statement Completely fine, it's his choice I have no opinion on it

Yuzvendra Chahal's estranged wife, Dhanashree Verma, has finally spoken about her divorce and slammed the Indian cricketer for his attire at the divorce hearing.Chahal appeared wearing a black t-shirt with the words “Be your own sugar daddy”. The move triggered a storm on social media, with many interpreting it as a subtle dig at Dhanashree.“Divorce is not something to celebrate. It’s not a celebration; it’s something very sad and deeply emotional. People must not forget that it’s not just about the two individuals, but also about the families involved—those who genuinely love and care about you,” she said on the podcast Spill The Tea.“I also believe true grief and chaos in a marriage have to be understood and acknowledged by both parties. Marriage begins with love, but when it ends, it often ends in distrust. The day it actually happened was very emotional for me, my family, and I’m sure for everyone around us. Even though we were mentally prepared for it, when the verdict was about to be given, I broke down completely. I started howling in front of everyone,” she recalled.Dhanashree strongly criticised Chahal’s choice of t-shirt on the divorce hearing.“He walked out first, and that whole t-shirt episode unfolded. I wasn’t even aware of it at the time because I was still inside. I left through the back door because I didn’t want to face the media. I was just wearing a simple t-shirt and jeans.“I sat in my car, still trying to catch my breath. Before I even realised what had happened, people began speculating about me because of that stunt. Sitting there, I felt like, ‘It’s done. It’s dusted.’“Somewhere, I did feel bad. Why was I even crying about this? Then I thought, forget it—let’s just end this. That moment gave me the motivation to laugh and move on. It’s over,” she added.","Yuzvendra chahal appeared wearing a black t-shirt with the words ""be your own sugar daddy"" the move triggered a storm on social media, with many interpreting it as a subtle dig at dhanashree. “divorce is not something to celebrate; it’s something very sad and deeply emotional.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123398560,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-53994,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Poll Do you think Vanessa Bryant handled the pregnancy rumors well? Yes, very cleverly No, she should have addressed them directly

Met Gala Surprise: Rihanna Stuns With Baby Bump Reveal, A$AP Rocky Confirms It’s Baby No 3

After days of unrelenting speculation, Vanessa Bryant took to Instagram Stories on Sunday, June 1, to put the rumors to rest. Her response wasn’t a press statement or a legal warning, it was a wild meme with a big middle finger to the internet trolls. The meme featured music icon Rihanna floating in water with a snorkel mask on her head, holding a drink, and flipping her middle finger.“Me protecting my peace, not pregnant & having fun all summer,” Vanessa Bryant wrote in the caption on her response to the online trolls who spread her pregnancy rumors about five years after her husband, Kobe Bryant ’s, untimely and devastating demise.It was clear, clever, and vintage Vanessa who shut down noise without saying a word about the origin of the gossip. No press release needed when you’ve got Rihanna energy with a direct middle finger gesture.The rumors had emerged out of nowhere, with some users pointing to photos allegedly showing a ""baby bump,"" though no timestamps or context were attached to those images. Vanessa hasn't been publicly linked to anyone romantically, and there’s been zero confirmation from her side—until now.In another Instagram Story later that evening, Vanessa shared a motivational quote that hinted at how she views the entire situation and what matters to her personally.“The only way to impress me, is by being a good person,” the quote read. “I don’t care what you have, what you wear, where you live, or what you drive. I just have deep respect for people with pure hearts and good intentions.”Adding one final touch to her trilogy of clapbacks, she posted another Rihanna meme, this one stating, “I’m not mean, I’m just not the one.”With the classic Rihanna memes, Vanessa showed that she is busy being a proud mom to her daughters while being the powerhouse of her business ventures. While she does not care about the rumor mill, her reaction explicitly showed that she is urging privacy.Recently, Renaldo Wilson, the brother of WNBA star A’ja Wilson, has spoken out after a fake photo involving (who appears to be) Celtics forward Jaylen Brown and Vanessa Bryant started spreading online.Vanessa Bryant, who shares four daughters with Kobe— Natalia, Bianka, Capri, and the late Gianna— has remained devoted to family and philanthropy. Most recently, she shared footage of a joyful family ski trip over the holidays, showing the tight-knit bond she maintains with her children.Natalia Bryant stepped into the fashion world just like her mother, officially joining IMG Models in 2021 at the age of 18. “Ever since I can remember, I wanted to model,” she shared in a statement posted by IMG on Instagram. “There is a lot to learn, but I feel this is a great opportunity for me to learn and express myself creatively.”Vanessa and Kobe Bryant tied the knot in April 2001. Tragically, in January 2020, Kobe and their 13-year-old daughter Gianna lost their lives in a helicopter crash that also killed seven others. They were headed to Kobe’s Mamba Sports Academy for a youth basketball game when the accident occurred. Kobe was 41 at the time. The loss shook the sports world and left a lasting impact on fans, friends, and loved ones across the globe. Kobe has left a huge legacy to his name as well, he is considered one the of the elite NBA superstars of all time with astounding stats, records and intense playmaking abilities. His demise created a huge void in the NBA world as fans are still mourning his untimely passing.Since their passing, she’s kept their memory alive through meaningful business ventures and charitable work. Kobe launched the Mamba Sports Foundation in 2016, aiming to support young athletes. After his death, Vanessa renamed it the Mamba & Mambacita Sports Foundation in honor of both Kobe and Gianna. Today, the foundation helps underserved boys and girls in sports, pushing forward the mission they believed in. It's her way of carrying on their legacy with purpose and heart.Vanessa Bryant’s response was indeed witty and empowering as she hinted that she deserves privacy and reminded the world that while she may be a public figure, her peace and dignity aren’t up for debate, especially not over unfounded gossip. After the viral response via memes, Vanessa has seemingly closed the chapter as she did not extend the matter any further with any other comments about it afterwards.Days after shutting down the pregnancy rumor, Vanessa Bryant made a glowing courtside appearance with her daughters at the New York Liberty vs. Chicago Sky game. The WNBA shared a sweet clip showing Vanessa alongside Natalia, 22, Bianka, 8, and Capri, 5, all smiling and waving for the camera.Later, Vanessa uploaded an image of her in a restaurant, candidly posing as she waited for the food to be arrive. Considering the dress, it appears that the photograph was shot after her recent attendance in the game.Their family moment quickly caught fans’ attention online, adding a warm highlight to the evening. It was a rare and heartwarming public outing for the Bryant family, showing their strong support for women’s basketball. It was Vanessa's first public outing since she debunked the horrendous pregnancy rumors.Recently, Vanessa honored her husband Kobe's memory with a heartfelt Instagram post on Instagram, sharing a throwback photograph of the family with the NBA legend, ""Happy Fathers Day @kobebryant 💕 You are so missed. We love you so much. #GirlDad 💕💕""Earlier this July, Vanessa Bryant added another heartfelt moment to her social media with a birthday post for her sister, Sophie. The sweet throwback photo featured Vanessa, her late husband Kobe Bryant, and Sophie together, smiling during happier times. It comes after several touching family updates, including daughter Natalia’s recent USC graduation and emotional tribute to her dad.As for her fortune, Vanessa's net worth has seen major growth over the years. While Kobe Bryant’s NBA success helped build their fortune, Vanessa carved her own path, too. She’s earned recognition as a model, businesswoman, and philanthropist, adding to her wealth through years of steady work.As of 2025, her estimated net worth is $600 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth. A large portion of that came from Kobe’s estate, after his tragic passing in 2020. At the time, Forbes valued the Lakers legend’s net worth at $600 million.Vanessa Bryant just shared a sweet throwback-inspired moment that melted hearts online. Her youngest daughter, Capri, recreated one of Kobe Bryant’s most iconic photos from 1999—wearing a cast and pajamas just like her dad did after a wrist injury. Vanessa captioned the photo, “Like father, like daughter. 💜 Capri Kobe Bryant 💜 #BabyMamba #KokoBean 💜💛🐍,” reminding fans how Kobe’s spirit lives on through their kids. From raising her children to keeping Kobe's memory alive, Vanessa has been an example of love and a remarkable parent. Also, there is no report of her seeing anyone as she remains loyal to her beloved husband Kobe, cherishing his legacy with their kids.Vanessa Bryant’s newest tribute arrives just months after she shared memories from a snowy holiday getaway with her daughters. Last December, she posted sweet moments on Instagram— showing the girls toasting marshmallows and skiing through the snow. Little Capri even shared a carousel ride with Vanessa, making the winter trip extra special.Additionally, Vanessa Bryant also grabs headlines for her friendship with several celebrities including Ciara, she often comments and likes the posts of her friends on social media. As of now, Vanessa is keeping a low profile about her personal life like always.Recently, Vanessa Bryant touched hearts with a heartfelt tribute to Kobe Bryant, joined by daughters Natalia, Bianka, and Capri during the Dodgers’ Bobblehead Night. She shared sweet photos from the emotional occasion, and her Instagram post celebrating Kobe Bryant’s legacy quickly drew an outpouring of love from fans. Certainly, Vanessa has been a proud mother with strong bonding with her kids.Recently, They partnered with @baby2baby and their Angel, @vanessabryant, to take part in a special Back-to-School Celebration for the incredible students of Ninth Street Elementary in Los Angeles. Each student received Mamba & Mambacita Sports Foundation gear along with Kobe sneakers — a perfect way to kick off the new school year and fall sports season.Also Read: Is Vanessa Bryant pregnant with her 5th child?

What Brady Martin brings to the Nashville Predators

In the second step of his career, Brady Martin, the young forward taken fifth overall in the 2025 NHL Draft, has decided to sign a three-year entry-level contract with Nashville. At 18 years old, this Canadian center had already made a name for himself with scintillating performances in the Ontario Hockey League (OHL) and on the international circuit. Martin is probably among the most exciting prospects in Nashville's future because of his solid two-way game, will to win, and sheer aptitude for scoring.Brady Martin is a skilled and hard-working player. He is 6-foot and 185 pounds, athletic enough to fend for himself in physical play and internally gifted with sharp hockey instincts. The 199-centimeter-tall forward recorded 72 points last season, with 33 goals and 39 assists, appearing in 57 games with the Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds in the OHL. Martin demonstrated his ability to clutch performances during the 2025 IIHF World Under-18 Championship, securing 11 points while leading Canada to gold.Beyond the statistics, Martin is known sportswide for his relentless drive. He was voted ""Hardest Worker"" by the Western Conference of the OHL, a commendation that can only applaud his efforts on and off the ice. Whether he's battling in the corners, leading forechecks, or jumping into transitions to send passes across the ice, Martin manifests the characteristics of a player ready to flourish at the professional level.The Predators see Martin as a versatile forward they envision playing all over the lineup. According to team officials, he is a long-term asset because of his great hockey sense to read the game, ability to control the puck, and propensity to generate offense. Nashville's assistant general manager Scott Nichol had high praise for Martin, talking about his ""pro habits"" and alternate vision, stating that Martin will fit very well into the Predators' system.Raised on the dairy farm of Elora, Ontario, Martin considers the background to have a lot to do with the formation of discipline and resilience in him. These attributes, combined with his natural talent, make for a solid platform on which to build an NHL future. For Nashville, locking up Martin's signature is a significant investment in the future.Also Read: Casey Mittelstadt trade rumors stir Boston Bruins off-season buzz Signing Brady Martin is more than a mere formality; it's indeed the birth of a promising NHL career.

Quenton Nelson expresses frustration with constant quarterback changes



“I think I’d be lying if I said it wasn’t frustrating. You watch other teams like the Kansas City Chiefs and see the same quarterback year after year, and they build chemistry. That makes a big difference for the offensive line.”

The NBA superstar’s off-court phase makes him nervous and puts second thoughts into his mind. He once said, “I was stressed out, bro. I ain’t going to lie. I’m sitting here like, ‘Yo, I don’t know what I’mma do’”.The unexpected involvement of Russell Wilson and Ciara has helped him a lot when things didn’t turn out the way he wanted them to.The couple prepped him up to deal with off-court situations. “They prepped me with all that, and then they gave me their people like, ‘Hey, this is who you should use.

Rashee Rice suspension twist as ESPN analyst Adam Schefter reveals why the ban may be shorter than fans feared,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/rashee-rice-suspension-twist-as-espn-analyst-adam-schefter-reveals-why-the-ban-may-be-shorter-than-fans-feared/articleshow/123412067.cms,"Rashee Rice suspension nears as NFL and NFLPA finalize the ban (Image via Getty)

Adam Schefter breaks down the NFL’s first move

CBA sets the ceiling for suspensions

NFLPA slows the process, not the league

Resolution is closer than fans think

What Rice’s suspension means for Kansas City

Rashee Rice’s name has lingered in the NFL’s disciplinary pipeline ever since his off-field crash in 2024 thrust him into a legal storm. Now, with the new season approaching, the Kansas City Chiefs wideout finds himself at the center of an intense back-and-forth between the league and the players’ union. ESPN analyst Adam Schefter has provided key updates that hint the suspension may be shorter than fans feared, shifting the spotlight from touchdowns to how many games Rice may miss when the final verdict arrives.Adam Schefter revealed that the NFL initially leaned toward an eight-game suspension for Rice, a number that quickly circulated online as speculation grew. Whispers of a harsher 10-game ban began dominating fan chatter, but Schefter pushed back, signaling that the league was already considering a lighter penalty. His update gave the first real sense of scale to the case, providing clarity after months of rumor.Central to the debate is the league’s own rulebook. Under the current Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA), suspensions in situations like Rice’s typically do not exceed six games. That precedent has become the measuring stick for both sides, creating a narrow window for negotiation. Schefter emphasized that while the NFL floated an eight-game figure, history shows that six has often been the ceiling, reshaping expectations for Chiefs fans holding their breath.Another key revelation from Schefter was the source of the delay. Contrary to popular belief, he clarified that the holdup was not from league offices dragging their feet. Instead, it was the NFL Players Association pushing for due process and carefully scrutinizing the case. “The wait isn’t on Park Avenue,” Schefter noted, referencing NFL headquarters, “it’s on the union’s side as they fight for terms within the CBA framework. ” His statement flipped the narrative, highlighting how labor rights remain deeply tied to player discipline.The timeline remains critical. With kickoff looming, both parties know a decision cannot spill too far into September. Schefter suggested that the case is “closer to the finish line than people think,” hinting that Rice will likely have clarity on his availability before the Chiefs begin defending their title push. The looming outcome is expected to be “closer to six than to three,” pointing to a middle-ground punishment — most likely five games.For the Chiefs, Rice’s fate carries both symbolic and strategic weight. His emergence in 2024 gave Patrick Mahomes another reliable weapon, and losing him for nearly half the season could bruise Kansas City’s offensive rhythm. At the same time, a shorter suspension would allow Rice to return early enough to keep the Super Bowl champions’ ambitions intact. Fans, already split between forgiveness and frustration, now wait on an announcement that could arrive any day.Rice’s case is more than a disciplinary footnote — it underscores how the NFL continues to wrestle with accountability, image, and fairness under its disciplinary code. For Schefter, the responsibility was to strip away rumor and lay out the mechanics of the process. For Rice, it is about rebuilding trust under the heaviest of spotlights. Whether five or six games, the suspension will be a reminder that the consequences of off-field choices linger long after the headlines fade.Also read: Travis Kelce’s locker room stunned and electrified as Taylor Swift turns up for Kansas City Chiefs’ Week 3 clash against Chicago Bears","Rashee rice’s suspension is “closer to the finish line than people think,’ espn analyst adam schefter said.

Minnesota relies on McCarthy-Jefferson duo to lead offensive charge



The Minnesota Vikings are entering the 2025 NFL season with a bold move, officially naming second-year quarterback J.J. McCarthy as their starter. With Sam Darnold departing in free agency, McCarthy now carries the weight of leading a team built to win immediately. The Vikings’ offensive roster is stacked with prime talent, including wide receiver Justin Jefferson, tight end T.J. Hockenson, and running back Jordan Mason, giving McCarthy a strong arsenal to launch a high-powered attack.As the Vikings focus on building chemistry, McCarthy has been working closely with Jefferson throughout training camp and preseason practices. Speaking to SiriusXM NFL Radio, the Michigan product praised Jefferson’s unique skill set and leadership on and off the field.“It’s a quarterback’s dream to have a receiver like that,” McCarthy said. “We got a lot of great guys in the room, too, but Justin’s one of one… His desire to work, his desire to be out there. He doesn’t have a cool guy personality; he’s just one of the boys. The way he moves is extremely freaky, just how he cuts in and out of routes.”McCarthy highlighted Jefferson’s speed, agility, and sideline awareness, saying his body control and stride length make him stand out from other receivers.Beyond physical ability, Jefferson’s mentality and confidence set him apart. “He has all those attributes all into one. What makes him great is just his mentality and his doglike mentality to show up every day, be the best in the world, and his confidence is through the roof,” McCarthy added.With Jefferson at 26, Hockenson at 29, and Mason at 26, the Vikings are in a position to maximize their prime offensive window.

The all-rounder has been picked in the squad but no longer holds the vice-captaincy—a role he last occupied during the 2024 World Cup.“Sometimes you feel surprised that a player like Yashasvi Jaiswal is not in the team...I don't know why Hardik Pandya has been removed,” said the 1983 World Cup winner.He further added, “But Gill is a good choice as he is performing well.
