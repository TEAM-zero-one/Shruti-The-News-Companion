NEW DELHI: Supreme Court has ruled that candidates belonging to Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, Other Backward Classes and Economically Weaker Sections are entitled to general category posts if they secure the cutoff marks stipulated for general category.The ruling by a bench of Justices Dipankar Datta and Augustine G Masih was inspired by SC's landmark verdict in the Indra Sawhney case of 1992 which had granted 27% reservation to OBCs in govt jobs. The bench dismissed a petition by Rajasthan HC which, while recruiting candidates for certain posts, had barred reserved category candidates from getting appointed against general category posts despite securing more marks than the cutoff fixed for general category.When an HC division bench ruled in favour of reserved category candidates who wanted to be considered for general category posts, HC moved SC, arguing that considering reserved category candidates for general category posts would amount to their being granted double benefit. Writing the judgment, Justice Datta said, ""We hold that the word 'open' connotes nothing but 'open', meaning thereby that vacant posts which are sought to be filled by earmarking it as 'open' do not fall in any category.Upholding the HC division bench's decision, SC said, ""The availability of reservation doesn't operate as a bar for a reserved category candidate from being considered on merit against the unreserved category.""The HC recruitment process was based on a written test followed by an interview. SC said if a reserved category candidate gets more marks more than the cutoff prescribed for general category, they should be considered to be in general category while appearing for interview. If the cumulative marks fall short of the cutoff for general category, they would be considered under the reserved category to which they belonged.","The ruling was inspired by sc's landmark verdict in the indra sawhney case of 1992.

Traffic to Sonprayag, P 10

NEW DELHI: In a bid to improve connectivity to Kedarnath, reduce travel time by road and enhance pilgrims' safety, the govt has zeroed in on the construction of a 7-km tunnel connecting Chaumasi in Kalimath Valley near Guptkashi to Sonprayag, the starting point of the ropeway project which will take pilgrims to the shrine.The twin tube tunnel will not just be an alternative but also serve as an escape route in case of emergency and bad weather. The govt will also carry out a feasibility study for a walkway and pedestrian tunnel from Chaumasi side for better connectivity to Kedarnath shrine.At present, all vehicles heading to Sonprayag and Gauri Kund take NH-107.As per the plan, the existing one-lane road in Kalimath Valley, which is under the Uttarakhand govt, will be expanded to two lanes to cater to increased traffic once the tunnel becomes operational.TOI has learnt the road transport ministry held a detailed discussion last week with Uttarakhand govt on the proposal. It took note of the increased number of pilgrims and tourists in Kedarnath, which stood at 17.7 lakh last year and is estimated to rise to 25 lakh in 2030 and 40 lakh in 2040.Taking lessons from the Sylkiyara tunnel episode, detailed geological and hydrological investigations will be carried out. The govt has awarded to Adani Enterprises the 12.9-km Sonprayag-Kedarnath ropeway project, which is likely to be operational in 2031-32.It will have the capacity to carry 1,800 pilgrims per hour, and pilgrims will be able to complete a one-way trip in just 40 minutes.",The twin tube tunnel will not just be an alternative but also serve as an escape route in case of emergency and bad weather.

KOLKATA: Sunday marked two months of the SIR rollout in Bengal as people struggle to get back something as basic as their voting right amid confusion among officials over which documents are kosher, multiple orders from Election Commission, flip-flops, and innumerable goof-ups.The chaotic drive led CM Mamata Banerjee to write on Saturday to chief election commissioner (CEC) Gyanesh Kumar to either ""rectify glitches"" or halt the ""unplanned, arbitrary and ad-hoc"" SIR of electoral rolls.Banerjee asked the CEC why Bengal was being ""singled out"" for ""arbitrary and illegal"" voter deletions. This was her fourth letter to Kumar since SIR began.Jayanti Devi (80) was one face of the confusion. Laden with a bag of medicines and documents, she stood clueless outside an SIR hearing camp at Chetla Boys' High School in Kolkata Sunday. She was asked to come for a second hearing with an old ration card or her parents' documents. ""I cannot hear or see properly. I can hardly walk... I don't have many documents, but I have a voter card. I have always cast my vote. Now they are saying there is a problem,"" she said.Jayanti's son said they had not been told of the EC order that voters aged 85 or more, as well as those who are sick or disabled, will not be called to such hearings.""They (EC officials) did come, but only to inform us about the hearing date. My parents moved to Chetla in 1967. She has been voting here since,"" he said.At Kalighat High School, Sister John Paul of the Missionaries of Charity had to appear for a hearing for putting Sister Nirmala in the column for her ""parent's name"" - the standard practice among all such orders and one acknowledged by EC.A Goan, Sister Paul came to Bengal in 2002 - the reference year for SIR in Bengal. In 2006, she had her voter and Aadhaar cards made and Sister Nirmala, then superior general of missionaries of charity, was named her guardian in the documents. ""I did not have my birth certificate with me. My sister sent it to me. It's absolute chaos,"" the 46-year-old said. Around 10 nuns of the order have received hearing notices.Roma Samanta, a voter in Kolkata's Rashbehari, got a hearing notice as her name was mixed up with a namesake from Kaliaganj in North Dinajpur district, over 400km away. ""We have been living here for 30 years... Our BLO told us to write a letter to the CEO. We have come to submit that,"" Samanta's husband said.In her letter to the CEC, the CM highlighted some of these hassles. ""Family register, extensively accepted as valid proof of identity during the SIR exercise in Bihar, is now reportedly being denied... such selective and unexplained exclusion of a previously accepted document raises serious concerns of discrimination and arbitrariness,"" Banerjee wrote.The CM claimed residence/domicile certificates issued by state authorities were also being rejected. Calling EC insensitive, CM said even the ""elderly, infirm, and seriously ill citizens are not being spared"". ""Many electors are being compelled to travel 20-25km to attend hearings, which have inexplicably been centralised rather than decentralised,"" she wrote.Amid the outcry, the poll panel announced 160 more SIR hearing centres, mostly in north Bengal. The new centres will be set up keeping in mind geographical constraints and distance for voters, EC officials said.","Sunday marked two months of the sir rollout in bengal.

In a video posted on social media, she claimed that neither of them was involved in ragging nor had witnessed any such harassment occurring in the college.""We were all classmates in BA first year. How is it possible that we ragged our own classmate? Also, we all belong to the Scheduled Caste community and can't possibly harass someone who belongs to the same caste as we do.

(AI image for representative purpose)

NEW DELHI: In a first, India will get a twin-tube underwater tunnel that will have provision for movement of both vehicle and trains, boosting faster movement of forces and ammunition in case of any exigency, reports Dipak Dash.An inter-ministerial panel, headed by the expenditure secretary has given green signal for construction of a 15.8km twin tube tunnel across Brahmaputra river in Assam connecting Gohpur and Numaligarh. One of the tubes will have provision for a single rail track.As per design, there will be no vehicular movement when trains run through this tube. It will have ballistic track and the trains will run on electricity. The total project of 33.7km, including the tunnel, approach roads and railway track will cost around Rs 18,600 crore. Once the project is complete, travel time between Gohpur and Numaligarh will reduce from current six-and-half hours to just 30 minutes, shortening the distance from 240km to 34km. This will enhance connectivity to Arunachal, Manipur, and other northeastern states.The project cost will be borne by road transport, railways and defence ministry.Designed as two unidirectional tunnels with two lanes each, these will be built 32m below Brahmaputra's deepest bed level. The project is expected to be completed in five years after the award of work.Officials said the projects will be placed before Union cabinet for approval and this may happen before Assam assembly polls. Last year, finance ministry had green signalled a road tunnel costing around Rs 14,900 crore with provision of 80:20 funding by road transport ministry and defence ministry. But following a decision to build road-cum-railway tunnels where it's feasible, govt had identified three such tunnels for North-East chicken neck corridor, across Brahmaputra in Assam and on Maranahally-Addahole (Shiradi Ghat) stretch in Karnataka, which TOI first reported on Oct 6, 2025.Officials said because of provision of railway track in one tunnel the cost has gone up.","An inter-ministerial panel has given green signal for construction of a 15.8km twin tube tunnel across brahmaputra river in assam.

NEW DELHI: A day after Congress announced that the nationwide 'MGNREGA Bachao Sangram' will be conducted from Jan 8 to Feb 25, rural development minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan called the opposition party's campaign a 'Bhrashtachaar Bachao Sangram' and accused Congress of spreading misinformation and falsehoods on Viksit Bharat- Guarantee for Rozgar and Ajeevika Mission (Gramin) Act.Addressing a press conference in the capital, Chouhan alleged that corruption was rampant in MGNREGA and claimed that 'VB-G RAM G' scheme is better and several steps ahead of MGNREGA. ""MGNREGA had ceased to be a symbol of honest employment. More than 1.091 million complaints were registered through social audits conducted in gram sabhas,"" he pointed out.The minister highlighted that contractors were carrying out work in the name of labourers, wages were withdrawn by showing machine-based work and the same roads were shown as 'new' year-after-year. He also highlighted that around 30% of workers were above 60; instances of 80-year-old ""labourers"" and fake attendance records were also found.""Over Rs 8.48 lakh crore has been spent on rural development so far under Modi govt, compared to only Rs 2 lakh crore during UPA regime,"" Chouhan said. He also questioned if permanent assets were created in villages and the lives of villagers and workers truly improved because of money spent by the earlier regime.Chouhan said 'VB-G RAM G' is a ""corruption-free, technology-driven and worker-centric reform"". The focus now will be on concrete development works such as water conservation, roads, schools, hospitals and natural disaster management. He said this is not the time for agitation but for cooperation and ""Congress should stop misleading the nation and spreading falsehoods"".Meanwhile, Congress on Sunday announced the setting up of a coordination committee to ""oversee, guide and monitor implementation of 'MGNREGA Bachao Sangram', with senior party functionary Ajay Maken as its convenor. The nationwide campaign will demand withdrawal of VB G RAM G Act, restoration of MGNREGA as a rights-based law, and right to work and empowerment of panchayats.

"With MGNREGA agitation, Cong eyes long-term drive",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/with-mgnrega-agitation-cong-eyes-long-term-drive/articleshow/126339988.cms,"'MGNREGA Bachao Abhiyan': Congress Announces Nationwide Protest Against VB-G RAM G Act

NEW DELHI: As it takes a determined step to agitate for MGNREGA with the successful farm laws stir as motivation, Congress views the agitation as a long-term sensitisation programme than the one which can radically change the status of the scheme disbanded by Modi govt. The reason is that the nature of the stakeholder in the rural job scheme is the poor working class in contrast to the big farmers involved in the campaign against farm laws.As MGNREGA workers are fighting for daily survival, it is conceded they cannot be mobilised for a long struggle over a future concern. This is in stark contrast to farm laws agitation which witnessed farmers from across the north gather for a prolonged dharna, which finally forced Centre to roll back three Acts. The marked difference in social clout of the two groups is what seems to complicate the struggle which otherwise, many feel, was a straight battle.Interestingly, the other agitation, which forced Modi govt to backtrack in its early days in power, was against ""weakening"" of land acquisition law, led by Rahul Gandhi. But that too involved farmers who were concerned about easing of acquisition norms.In contrast, MGNREGA changes may actually put farmers against labourers, and the protest, because of the policy of pausing G RAM G Act for two months during the agricultural season.Thus, it is felt, the agitation for MGNREGA is more a long-term campaign, which would seek to sensitise the poor workers and prepare them for the time when ""they feel the pinch"" of the new G RAM G Act.The difference between past successful agitations and proposed MGNREGA campaign was discussed in Congress Working Committee (CWC) meeting last week that considered the issue.Sources said CWC acknowledged the battle will be prolonged, as wage earners cannot be called away from work to join a struggle. Instead, political activists will have to visit work sites and villages to sensitise the groups that, according to Congress, will be hurt by the changes from the job guarantee scheme brought in the new law - like budget, pause during agriculture season, panchayat-level planning. This will also require coordination with voluntary organisations involved in the job guarantee scheme.",Congress views the agitation as a long-term sensitisation programme than the one which can radically change the status of the scheme.

NEW DELHI: West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Saturday wrote to Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Gyanesh Kumar, criticising the ""procedural violations"" and ""administrative lapses"" in the Special Intensive Revision (SIR), which is currently under way in the poll-bound state.Mamata Banerjee called the exercise ""unplanned, arbitrary and adhoc"" and urged the poll body chief to stop the SIR if glitches remain unattainted.""I am once again constrained to write to you in order to place on record my grave concern regarding the serious irregularities, procedural violations, and administrative lapses being witnessed during the ongoing Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of the electoral rolls in West Bengal,"" she wrote in a letter.She also expressed apprehension about the large-scale disenfranchisement of eligible voters, which she said would be a ""direct assault on the foundational principles of democratic governance"".""I strongly urge you to immediately address and rectify the glitches, address the flaws and make the necessary corrections, failing which this unplanned, arbitrary and adhoc exercise must be halted. If allowed to continúe in its present form, it will result in irreparable damage, large-scale disenfranchisement of eligible voters, and a direct assault on the foundational principles of democratic governance, "" she further wrote.In November last year, describing the ongoing SIR in West Bengal as “unplanned, chaotic, and dangerous,” Mamata Banerjee said that the situation had reached an “alarming stage” following the deaths of multiple booth-level officers (BLOs), including an anganwadi worker in Jalpaiguri.In a letter addressed to Gyanesh Kumar, Banerjee said she had “time and again flagged my serious concerns” but had now been “compelled to write” as the situation had deteriorated sharply.She wrote that the manner in which the EC had pushed the SIR onto officials and residents was “not only unplanned and chaotic, but also dangerous”, alleging the absence of basic preparedness, clear communication, or adequate planning.According to her, the process has been “crippled from day one” by poor training, confusion over mandatory documentation, and the near impossibility of meeting voters during their work hours.She warned that the credibility of the voter roll itself was at risk, saying BLOs were being forced to work “far beyond human limits” while balancing their principal duties as teachers and frontline workers.Banerjee said most BLOs were struggling with online submissions because of server failures and repeated data mismatches, making it “almost certain” that accurate voter data could not be uploaded by the 4 December deadline. She added that many BLOs, under fear of punitive action, were being pushed to submit incorrect entries, “risking disenfranchisement of genuine voters”.","Mamata banerjee criticises ""procedural violations"" and ""administrative lapses"" in the special intensive revision (sir) of the electoral rolls in west bengal.

The report flagged systemic lapses in monitoring and testing of drinking water by urban local bodies while putting out the tally of 5.45 lakh diseases in the two cities.The report cautioned that ""the possibility of contaminated water being supplied by the MCs (municipal corporations) during the period could not be ruled out"". Such CAG reports are part of its assessments of the civic bodies' finances.To assess ground realities, CAG's audit conducted joint sampling in Aug-Sept 2018 with officials of Bhopal Municipal Corporation (BMC) and Indore Municipal Corporation (IMC). A total of 54 samples were collected from water sources, filter plants, overhead tanks and consumer taps, and independently tested at the State Research Laboratory, Bhopal.In BMC areas, turbidity in some samples exceeded BIS norms, while faecal coliform, which should be 0, was detected in multiple samples. In Indore, faecal coliform counts ranged from 40 to 140, far above permissible limits.The auditor noted that 8.95 lakh residents -- 3.62 lakh in Bhopal and 5.33 lakh in Indore -- were likely to be affected due to the supply of contaminated water containing faecal coliform, pointing to a ""lack of monitoring of filter plants at the operational level as well as at the distribution level"".CAG raised concerns again in the audit report on local bodies for the year ended March 31, 2022, which found that seven of the 14 urban local bodies randomly audited did not have water testing laboratories.CAG observed that tests were not conducted regularly and that civic bodies failed to follow minimum sampling frequencies prescribed in the CPHEEO manual, warning that ""adverse effects on the health of the population due to supply of water without regular testing cannot be ruled out"". CPHEEO is short for Central Public Health and Environmental Engineering Organisation, a technical wing of the Union ministry of housing and urban affairs.After the recent Indore deaths, NGO Jan Swastha Abhiyan has written to the MP chief secretary and the Union Jal Shakti ministry, citing the repeated audit findings, demanding urgent action and stressing that warnings sounded years ago were never translated into sustained corrective measures.",Official audits had warned for years that contaminated drinking water posed serious public health risks in madhya pradesh. 5.45 lakh cases of water-borne diseases were recorded in bhopal and indore civic areas between 2013 and 2018.
