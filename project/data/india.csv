"Infections from medicine tubes in Indian hospitals high, shows study",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/infections-from-medicine-tubes-in-indian-hospitals-high-shows-study/articleshow/123609718.cms,"MUMBAI: A seven-year study at 54 private and public hospitals and 200 ICUs in India has found over 8,600 cases of severe bloodstream infections linked to mismanagement of tubes inserted into large veins to deliver medicines and fluids. These are called central lines, with newborns most at risk.About 40% of patients with central line infections died within two weeks. The rate: 8.83 central line infections per 1,000 central line-days, meaning nine infections for every 1,000 days that central lines were used. The study, just out in Lancet, recorded 9,77,052 central line-days. The figures are much higher than reported in the US, where the rate even in 2020 (Covid year) was 0.87 per 1,000.Doctors said newborns are vulnerable to most infections, and when they need central lines in ICUs, the risk increases. The study, titled 'Profile of CLABSI (Central-Line Associated Bloodstream Infection) Infections in Adults', said 87% of Acinetobacter and 78% of Klebsiella infections - the two most common culprits in such cases - were resistant to carbapenems, a class of antibiotics considered a last resort.One more culprit, Candida auris - a fungal infection known for its drug resistance - was also a frequent cause. These reach central lines through contaminated hands, equipment or medicines, and enter the bloodstream.""There is a haphazard use of third-line antibiotics like carbapenems because they are the most effective to a point that now they are being rendered useless. We have allowed this resistance to develop because of a lack of monitoring mechanism and guidelines,"" said Dr Hemalata Arora, infectious disease expert at Mumbai's Nanavati Hospital. Microbiologist Dr Rajesh Karyakarte, from Pune's BJ Medical College, said most anti-fungals fail before Candida auris and it is most difficult to wipe out of hospital settings: ""Resistance rates to bacterial infections are alarming. Carbapenems have proven to be the safest ones. Eventually, doctors may have to switch to alternative antibiotics for certain infections which could be more toxic.""Conducted between 2017 and 2024, the research was led by Healthcare Associated Infection Surveillance Network and coordinated by AIIMS, New Delhi, with funding from US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The authors, all microbiologists from across India, wrote that infection rates peaked in 2020-21, coinciding with Covid, when overwhelmed ICUs, staff shortages and strained infection-control practices likely played a role. Rates fell the following year but rebounded, leading them to conclude that the issue is persistent.Dr Arora said transmission of central line infections are bound to occur but the point is to reduce incidence. ""The rate of infection differs from hospital to hospital. In bigger hospitals, it is 1 or 2 per 1,000 central line days. Smaller hospitals could have 15 to 20, even 30 to 40 per 1,000,"" she said.A paediatrician and infectious disease specialist from Mumbai said, ""In most govt and semi-govt setups, doctors as well as allied staff are overworked due to staff shortage. Very sick patients often require prolonged use of central lines, and for paediatric patients, repeated needle pricks are difficult, so central lines are kept for longer durations. But these central lines are often not managed properly because of inadequate training and understaffing. ""","Over 8,600 cases of severe bloodstream infections linked to mismanagement of tubes inserted into large veins to deliver medicines and fluids.

NEW DELHI: A 35-year-old sewadar was on Friday brutally beaten to death with sticks by a group of men inside the premises of southeast Delhi's Kalkaji Temple following a dispute over the distribution of chunni prasad.Police have arrested five people so far, including the father of one of the men for harbouring him.The victim, Yogendra Singh , hailed from Fattepur in Uttar Pradesh's Hardoi district, where he used to work as a farmer. He visited Delhi every few months, serving at the temple for the past 15 years.Investigation revealed the group had an argument with temple staff, including Singh, over the same issue just days earlier. On Friday, police received a PCR call around 9.30pm about a quarrel at the temple.To support his family and fund the treatment of his six-year-old differently-abled daughter, Yogendra Singh balanced two jobs, working as a farmer in his native village in Uttar Pradesh's Hardoi district and as a sewadar at Kalkaji Temple in Delhi.Every few months, he would travel to the city to serve at the temple and earn some money before returning home to tend to his wheat and bajra crops.On Saturday morning, Singh's elder brother, Kaushal Singh, stood tearfully outside the AIIMS Trauma Centre, waiting to collect the body. He recalled how Yogendra worked relentlessly and without complaining driven by the single goal of securing a better future for his children. His daughter, who has problems performing basic tasks with her arm and leg, has been undergoing treatment for over a year, costing the family over Rs 1.5 lakh.Yogendra, the youngest of three brothers, last met his wife, mother and two children when he left home two months ago.

""I was going to Puri in Odisha for work and he asked me to travel safely and take care of myself. He was such a simple man, who never hurt anyone and only ever cared for others,"" he said.Eyewitnesses to the horrible attack on Yogendra at the temple described the scene as ""complete chaos"", with the attackers using sticks to brutally assault the victim while cursing at him. Brijesh Kumar Singh, 87, said, ""It was around the usual aarti timing and it was raining a little. I remember running away in fear when I saw a large group barge in and beat up a man that I have been seeing around for years.""Speaking to the media, Raju, another sewadar at the temple, said, ""Yogendra was pulled out from the temple dharmshala around 9pm. The mob had iron rods and sticks in their hands and beat him to death."" Another 21-year-old sewadar, who was a close friend of Yogendra for over a decade, was filled with fear and anxiety: ""We get into minor arguments with devotees all the time but such issues can be resolved with conversation.

NEW DELHI: A man killed his wife and mother-in-law with a pair of scissors in northwest Delhi's KN Katju Marg area following a heated argument over a birthday gift for their son.The accused, Yogesh Sehgal, was later arrested in Rohini, where he was detected roaming around with his two sons.On Saturday, around 3.50 pm, police received a PCR call reporting the murder of the caller's mother, Kusum Sinha, 63, and sister, Priya Sehgal, 34, both residents of Rohini.A police team rushed to the third floor house in Rohini Sector 17, where they found two female bodies lying in a pool of blood. The crime team and forensic experts were summoned to the scene.According to Sinha's son, Megh Sinha, his mother visited Priya's house on Aug 28 to celebrate the birthday of Priya's son, Chirag. Megh alleged that Yogesh killed his mother and sister and fled with the children. Sehgal was arrested and the cops seized his blood-stained clothes and a pair of scissors, the alleged weapon of offence.

Belgian court rejects Choksi bail petition,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/belgian-court-rejects-choksi-bail-petition/articleshow/123608183.cms,"Mehul Choksi

NEW DELHI: A Belgian court is learnt to have rejected the bail plea of fugitive diamantaire Mehul Choksi ahead of his extradition hearing there. Choksi, who was arrested in Belgium in April this year, had applied for bail on medical grounds last month.Indian law enforcement agencies argued that Choksi was a habitual absconder and was likely to flee to another country if granted bail. The court accepted the argument and denied bond.Choksi is wanted in bank fraud cases worth over Rs 13,900 crore. He has been in a Belgian jail for over four months now. Ahead of his extradition hearing scheduled in mid-Sept, the CBI has provided Belgian prosecutors voluminous evidence of his involvement in economic offences in India and details of his escape from US and Antigua in the past, besides the two open warrants against him. The Global Operations Centre of CBI is monitoring the developments in the case in direct coordination with foreign law enforcement agencies and Interpol channels. It has also hired the services of a local law firm to bolster the case.In Jan 2018, Choksi had fled to the US and then to Antigua, whose citizenship he had obtained a year before. The CBI filed an FIR on complaint of bank fraud and started a probe. In 2021, he vanished from Antigua and surfaced in Dominica while trying to escape to Cuba on a boat. In 2022, five more cases were registered against him. He relocated to Belgium, for the second time, thereafter with his wife Preeti Choksi, who is a Belgian citizen, after securing an 'F Residency Card' there. Granted a residency in Belgium in Nov 2023, Choksi was arrested there on April 11 this year.","Mehul choksi is wanted in bank fraud cases worth over rs 13,900 crore.

Mahua Moitra Under Fire: TMC MP’s ‘Cut Amit Shah’s Head’ Jibe Draws Sharp BJP Backlash

NEW DELHI: TMC MP Mahua Moitra has lit a political powder keg with her explosive remark targeting Union home minister Amit Shah , allegedly saying his ""head should be cut off"". The BJP condemned the statement as a ""distasteful and hate remark,"" with the party lodging a complaint at Krishnanagar's Kotwali police station.While speaking on the issue of illegal immigration along India’s eastern border, Moitra, addressing in Bengali, reportedly said, ""Amit Shah’s head should be cut off and placed on the table.""However, there is no independent confirmation of the statement.Meanwhile, the BJP hit back at TMC MP over her statement, calling it ""distasteful and hate remarks"" and asking whether it represented the TMC's official position.Moitra, speaking to reporters in Nadia district during an event, accused the Union government of neglecting its responsibility on border security. ""They are repeatedly talking about infiltrators; but the border of India is protected by five forces, and that is directly the home ministry's responsibility,"" she said.She also referred to PM Narendra Modi’s Independence Day speech. ""Standing at Red Fort, the PM himself said infiltrators are causing demographic changes.But even as he was saying this, his Home Minister was standing in the front row, smiling and clapping,"" she added.The BJP's West Bengal unit later amplified her comments on X, sharing Moitra's picture with the statement as its caption, while intensifying its attack on the TMC leader.Later in the day, TMC MP Moitra hit back at the BJP over the row surrounding her alleged remark on Union home minister Shah.In a post on X, she wrote, ""Modus operandi of BJP troll cell – pick one issue, give it to all resident twits (and an ‘a’ instead of an ‘i’ would be just as well) and make it ‘viral’ on social media. Today’s theme is Mahua Moitra’s Off With His Head metaphor. Long live my infamy, guys. Love it.""Defending Moitra, her TMC colleague Kunal Ghosh told PTI that the remark was symbolic. ""Mahua Moitra's comment has no physical implications, nor did she intend to attack Union home minister Amit Shah. She was trying to make a symbolic statement, which did not translate well,"" he said.Reflecting on TMC MP's comment, BJP's Pradeep Bhandari called it a language of ""urban naxals"", saying, ""This is the language of political urban naxals. Mahua Moitra, Rahul Gandhi and all Opposition leaders are trying to provoke violence in the minds of people through their words. This is their culture that they abuse the late mother of the Prime Minister...All of this makes it clear that their 'niti' and 'niyat' are not in the interest of the nation or the public. ""On TMC MP's remark, BJP spokesperson RP Singh said, ""Be it Mahua Moitra or Congress party - one party abuses PM's mother and the other party's leader says that Amit Shah should be beheaded. It shows their frustration. They know that they are going to lose Bihar and Bengal is next. So, such language is being used out of frustration.""","Tmc mp mahua moitra reportedly said, ""amit shah’s head should be cut off and placed on the table"" the bjp condemned the statement as a ""distasteful and hate remark,"" with the party lodging a complaint at krishnanagar's kotwali police station.

India’s Languages Must Not Divide: Vice President Dhankhar | Strong Message Amid Rising Polarisation

,

NEW DELHI: Senior lawyer Abhishek Manu Singhvi, while making his arguments on the scope of a governor’s powers in assenting to bills, read out a passage from one of Justice Krishna Iyer’s judgments and compared the judge’s prowess in English with that of Congress MP Shashi Tharoor , incidentally both hailing from Kerala.Singhvi said unlike Justice Iyer’s English, which was lyrical and not difficult to understand, to fathom Tharoor’s English one would require a dictionary, a prowess which the MP uses to flummox many while responding to tricky or difficult questions. CJI B R Gavai said a Kerala HC judge is attempting to emulate Justice Iyer these days.After lunch break, Singhvi issued a clarification about his comments“I mentioned Tharoor in admiration and not in derogation.” The CJI in a lighter vein said, “Neither can we adjudicate that nor can we stop what will be said (about Singhvi’s remarks) on social media.”The bench, headed by CJI Gavai and comprising Justices Surya Kant, Vikram Nath, PS Narsimha, and AS Chandurkar, focused on questions surrounding gubernatorial discretion. The bench noted that the Constituent Assembly had replaced the six-week timeline for a governor to act on a bill with the phrase “as soon as possible.”Solicitor general Tushar Mehta, representing the Centre, argued that a state government cannot invoke Article 32 to seek a writ against a governor.Singhvi countered that a governor has no discretionary power to negate a bill passed by the assembly. He cautioned, “If a governor’s decisions are made non-justiciable, he could, rather than the people’s elected representatives, become the supreme law-making authority by merely consigning a bill to his cupboard. ”Singhvi explained that withholding a bill must be followed by returning it to the House for reconsideration. “If the House does not repass the bill, it falls through. This is the intended meaning of Article 200 regarding a governor’s power to withhold assent. Otherwise, the democratic will of the people could be subverted,” he said.The bench further asked whether a governor could reserve a bill for the President if it conflicted with central law. Singhvi replied that a governor may reserve a bill for the President when first presented. “If the House approves it again, with or without amendments, the governor has no option but to give assent,” he clarified.Concluding, Singhvi emphasised that a governor is merely an 'ornamental head' of the state.Arguments from states opposing presidential references are expected to continue on Tuesday.","Senior lawyer abhishek manu singhvi compared the judge's prowess in english with that of congress mp shashi tharoor.

‘Who are you to object?': Jharkhand HC judge slams IAS officer over compensation by state govt; video goes viral,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/who-are-you-to-object-jharkhand-hc-judge-slams-ias-officer-over-compensation-by-state-govt-video-goes-viral/articleshow/123577011.cms,"Image: X@/kumarmanish9

This is a property of the state government, right?

Do you want commission?

Social media reacts



A video from the Jharkhand high court surfaced online showing a judge sternly reprimanding an IAS officer during a hearing. In the clip, which is now going viral on social media, the judge can be seen calling out the officer over alleged discrepancies and irregularities.The IAS officer’s name and posting remain unverified, but the judge is heard warning that an FIR will be filed to initiate an investigation.The incident reportedly took place when the judge was hearing a case related to land acquisition and compensation, but the IAS officer had objected to the compensation being offered to the petitioner.“Who are you to object? Ye state ka property hai na? () the judge can be heard saying in the video.""If the state has recognised any person as a ryot, who are you to say that person is not a ryot. You are an alien to the dispute,"" the judge further added.The judge also accused the officer of taking commissions while questioning his authority to object, saying he was preventing rightful awards from being given.“Commission chahiye aapko? () You want commission in each and every case? Under what authority you have objected? The award has been prepared.You are depriving the person of getting the award” the judge said.“You have to take contempt or I will lodge an FIR against you” he said.“Don’t raise a dispute if you are an outsider. In a property dispute, will you come in like a monkey to claim a share?” the judge can be heard saying.The video has drawn appreciation from the public for how the judge handled the situation.“Wow!! Simply awesome. So satisfying to watch this episode. The bureaucrat thought he was above law for a moment. Hats off to you, the judiciary, and judge,” a user commented.“If all Judges take the right approach and ask all IAS officers, EC, and ED to apply law as per the Constitution, 50 percent cases will go away from court,” commented another.“Judicial accountability in action! The judge's sharp questioning demonstrates that courts are taking corruption seriously. This direct approach could deter future misconduct if consistently applied across all levels of bureaucracy,” read another comment.","A video from the jharkhand high court surfaced online showing a judge sternly reprimanding an ias officer during a hearing.

Around 30,000 Maratha protesters converged in the city in a show of strength. Govt did not send a delegation to meet Jarange. However, earlier in the day, Fadnavis said, ""We are supportive of the agitation because such agitations are a part of democracy. We are following court orders... A path has to emerge through talks."" The agitation will pit the Maratha community, said to number around 30% of the state's population, against OBCs who are much larger in number.While NCP, Congress and NCP (SP) have a large Maratha following, OBCs are mainly with BJP.

'Let's together fight larger battle': Why Kapil Sibal's advice may not stop Arvind Kejriwal from targeting Congress,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/lets-together-fight-larger-battle-why-kapil-sibals-advice-may-not-stop-arvind-kejriwal-from-targeting-congress/articleshow/123588172.cms,"Arvind Kejriwal, Kapil Sibal (C), Rahul Gandhi (R)

NEW DELHI: ""Stop the bickering. Let's together fight the larger battle!"" - Kapil Sibal 's advice to Arvind Kejriwal after the AAP convener's latest offensive against the Congress is unlikely to impress the former Delhi chief minister.Sibal, who served as Union minister in the UPA governments and is currently an Independent Rajya Sabha member, counselled Kejriwal after the AAP convener alleged a nexus between the BJP and the Congress and questioned why no ""big leader"" of the grand old party had been arrested in the National Herald case ""We keep on getting offers for a compromise. Now, even people are seeing that Congress has reached a compromise with the BJP. The National Herald case is an open and shut case. But no big leader of the Congress has gone to jail. Five of our big leaders were sent to jail in a fake case,"" Kejriwal said at a meeting of AAP MLAs and councillors in the national capital.Citing examples from Goa, the AAP supremo emphasised, ""People ask why the BJP has sent five of AAP's top leaders to jail but not a single Congress leader. They shout endlessly about the National Herald case, which I myself read about online.As per facts, it looks like an open-and-shut case. Yet despite serious allegations, no one from the Gandhi family has gone to jail, while we are jailed in completely fabricated cases. ""Kejriwal also made a mention of the land scam cases of Haryana and named Robert Vadra to highlight his point. ""In 2014 the BJP built its campaign around 'jija ji' (brother-in-law) and corruption, shouting about Vadra, 2G and coal scams. Yet today, all those cases have quietly been shut. The people are not fools. They can see the reality--that Congress and BJP are in a hidden alliance,"" he said.Kejriwal and several other AAP leaders were booked and arrested in the alleged liquor scam case and other cases. All the AAP leaders were eventually granted bail. However, Kejriwal resigned ahead of the assembly elections and made Atishi the chief minister of Delhi.Sibal, who has been associated with the grand old party for a long time, was quick to remind Kejriwal about the consequences of his baseless allegations against political rivals in the past.""Kejriwal ji: When you made allegations against several politicians and others and was dragged to court you apologised! Today you made baseless allegations against the Gandhi family (National Herald case). Stop the bickering. Let's together fight the larger battle!"" Sibal said in a post on X.But the question is: Will Kejriwal heed Sibal's advice? Well, it seems unlikely as the ties between the two parties nosedived during the last Delhi elections when Congress played a key role in the defeat of AAP at the hands of the BJP.While both Congress and AAP are part of the opposition's INDIA bloc, the two parties have all along shared uneasy ties - characterised by threats, warnings and blackmails. When INDIA bloc was formed, Kejriwal made AAP's participation conditional to Congress's support against the Centre's Delhi ordinance. The two parties did join hands in Delhi for the 2024 Lok Sabha elections after a lot of back and forth, but the experiment failed to stop the BJP from winning all the 7 Lok Sabha seats in the national capital for the third time in a row.In the assembly elections, the two allies turned into bitter rivals and went all out to discredit each other. With the Congress putting all its might against AAP, the BJP gained and managed to return to power in the national capital after a long gap of 27 years.In Haryana assembly elections, the two parties tried to stich an alliance but could not reach a common ground. In several other states like Gujarat, Goa, the AAP has successfully contested on its own and managed to spread its reach. Till they lost elections in Delhi, AAP was the only party besides BJP and Congress to have government in two states.The Congress, on the other hand, despite all its electoral reverses in the last 11 years, remains the only opposition party with pan-India presence and hence takes the position of principal challenger to the BJP.Any attempt to broker peace between AAP and Congress is unlikely to succeed as the two parties remain rivals in Punjab where assembly elections are due early in 2027. Both the parties have huge stakes in the state. In the last assembly elections in 2022, AAP had decimated the Congress and stormed to power winning 92 of the 117 assembly seats in the state.For AAP, Punjab remains the only state where it has government and hence led by Kejriwal the party will go out to retain the state. On the other hand, the Congress which has considerable presence in the state, will do everything possible to return to power.In the given scenario, it will be difficult for AAP and Congress to come together for the larger fight - the 2029 Lok Sabha elections, when the INDIA bloc will once again try to challenge the dominance of BJP-led NDA.","Sibal counselled kejriwal after the aap convener alleged a nexus between the bjp and the congress.
