NEW DELHI: Absence of Rahul Gandhi and Mallikarjun Kharge , leaders of opposition in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, respectively, from the Independence Day event at Red Fort on Friday drew a sharp reaction from BJP which alleged that the main opposition party, Congress, has hit a ""new low"" with its top functionaries ""insulting"" the country by ""boycotting"" the event.Rahul had attended the programme last year but was absent this time. Kharge was absent last year as well. The Congress leadership steered clear of making a statement on the issue but sources said party heads have chosen to distance themselves from such events as they feel the governing dispensation discriminates against opposition members in terms of seating arrangements and protocol.""Even those holding constitutional positions are not shown due respect - instead of being seated in the front row, they are placed in the third row,"" a source said.BJP sources refuted the charge as a ""lame alibi"". ""We are following the same protocol that they had put in place,"" a source said. ""From opposing a party to insulting the nation - every time you think Congress can't fall further, they hit a new low,"" BJP said.""Only a handful of chairs were empty at Red Fort, and no points for guessing who missed the event again,"" BJP said, posting a media report on X about Rahul and Kharge skipping the official event.The stalemate over seats and protocol is not new and has seen BJP and Congress engage in a war of words with BJP members alleging in the past that during UPA era, its members were not given seats in VIP areas.","Rahul gandhi and mallikarjun kharge, leaders of opposition in lok sabha and rajya sabha, respectively, from the independence day event at red fort on friday.

She was in court to tell the judges whether she wanted to live with her divorced father or mother.Minutes after a division bench of Justices M S Ramesh and V Lakshminarayanan pronounced the order, the girl tried to escape by jumping off the first-floor corridor of Court No 5, clutching a wire. The girl, who suffered injuries due to the fall, was rescued by police and rushed to the Rajiv Gandhi Govt General Hospital (RGGGH) in an ambulance stationed in the court.The issue pertains to a complaint made by M K Nair with the Neelankarai police alleging that his daughter was missing. Since considerable time had lapsed and the girl could not be secured, he moved a habeas corpus plea in high court. During the pendency of the petition, the girl was traced and produced before the court.The bench was informed that the girl had gone to her grandmother's house in the Andamans and was residing with her since she did not want to live with either her father or mother, who are divorced and living separately.In view of the wish expressed by the minor girl, the court subjected her to counselling before the Tamil Nadu Mediation and Conciliation Centre on the HC campus.However, the mediation talks failed, and the special counsellor's confidential report submitted to the court recorded that the child may require specialised counselling from a psychiatrist.When the judges interacted with the girl, she said she wanted to live with her mother in the Andamans. ""However, from the confidential report, we are of the view that there would not be a conducive atmosphere for the minor girl to safely reside in the Andamans. Since the girl said that she does not want to live with her father, the only alternative left to us is to direct her to be put in a safety home,"" the court said.The court then directed police to ensure that the girl is safely admitted to Govt Children's Home for Girls, Kellys, Chennai, by Aug 12.

NEW DELHI: Nearly half a century after New Okhla Industrial Development Authority (Noida) came into existence, Supreme Court on Wednesday asked UP government to consider replacing it with a metropolitan council for people-centric governance.The direction was based on findings of an SC-constituted SIT, which gave a stinging report into the functioning of Noida Authority, finding, among other things, decision-making centralised in the hands of a few officers.Accepting SIT's recommendations, a bench of justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi ordered: ""In order to infuse transparency and fairness as well as a citizen-centric approach in the day-to-day functioning of Noida, we direct UP chief secretary to place the recommendation... before the council of ministers for an appropriate decision.""Till that decision is taken, the bench directed the chief secretary to post a chief vigilance officer, who should be an IPS officer or an officer on deputation from CAG, in Noida for a financial audit.According to SIT, Noida officers were involved in 20 cases of excess payment of compensation to landowners. Led by IPS officer SB Shiradkar, SIT also concluded that Noida's land allotment policies favour builders, and there was a lack of transparency and fairness in the development authority's overall functioning.It sought an inquiry into assets of officers and their relatives for a proper look at who benefited from excess compensation that Noida paid out.Commenting on the functioning of Noida, SIT said discretionary powers exercised by its officers in allotment of land is such that very soon, there will be no land available in Delhi's neighbouring city for future development purposes. It also flagged the lack of process to garner public view and conduct environment impact assessments for projects in Noida. SIT said residents often complain of delay and inadequate resolution of grievances, as Noida Authority acts reactively rather than proactively.The Justice Kant-led bench directed the chief secretary to set up a citizen advisory board for Noida in four weeks and banned giving effect to any project in Noida without environmental impact assessment and clearance from SC's green bench.In the 20 cases where excess compensation was paid to landowners because of alleged collusion of Noida officials who were identified by SIT, the bench constituted another SIT to conduct a probe into each of these officers and register FIRs on detection of a cognisable offence. It asked the authority to grant sanction for prosecution against delinquent officials within four weeks of SIT seeking it.""The SIT headed by a police officer not below the rank of commissioner of police will register preliminary enquiries (PEs) and proceed to inquire into the illustratively highlighted points (in the previous SIT report) and involve experts from forensic account department as well as economic offences wing.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday used the pulpit of Red Fort to lavish praise on RSS, saying that the Sangh's contribution to the nation marks a ""proud and golden chapter"".Speaking about the contributions of individuals and organisations to nation-building in his Independence Day address, he said: ""Today, with great pride, I wish to mention one such institution. One hundred years ago, RSS was founded. These 100 years of service to the nation constitute a proud and golden chapter. With the resolve of nation-building through character-building, with the aim of serving Maa Bharati, the swayamsevaks have, for a century, dedicated their lives to the welfare of the motherland. ""The remarks of the PM, himself a swayamsevak, eulogising the Sangh when it is seen as enjoying unprecedented influence, can only add zing to its ongoing centenary celebrations.PM also praised Shyama Prasad Mookerjee, the founder of Bhartiya Jan Sangh, as BJP was known in its original incarnation, who died in jail after being imprisoned for campaigning against Special Status for J&K.""The removal of the wall of Article 370 and the realisation of the mantra of 'One Nation, One Constitution' have been our true tribute to him,"" said Modi.Although Sangh was invited to be a part of the Republic Day parade in 1963, this was, perhaps, the first instance of praise for the organisation which has defied bans, controversies and intense opposition from influential political and academic quarters to become one of the country's major influences and a challenge to the Nehruvian/ ""liberal"" version of nationalism and secularism.Interestingly, the high praise comes amid persisting speculation about a strain in Sangh's equations with BJP.Modi went the full distance in expressing his veneration for the organisation. ""Today, from the ramparts of Red Fort, I salute all the swayamsevaks who have contributed to this century-long journey of national service, and the nation takes pride in the grand and dedicated journey of RSS, which will continue to inspire us,"" he said.","Pm narendra modi used the pulpit of red fort to lavish praise on rss.

"Illegal immigration orchestrated drive to change demography, says PM, announces counter-move",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/illegal-immigration-orchestrated-drive-to-change-demography-says-pm-announces-counter-move/articleshow/123326810.cms,"NEW DELHI: Airing concerns over infiltration and illegal immigration and their impact on national security and demographic character of border areas, PM Narendra Modi Friday announced the setting up of a 'high-powered demographic mission' to address these challenges.Elaborating on the decades-old problem of illegal immigration from across the international border, Modi said it is part of an orchestrated campaign to alter the nation's demography. ""Illegal immigrants are snatching the livelihoods of young citizens. They are targeting our mothers and sisters and capturing lands of innocent tribals. This will not be tolerated,"" he said.""When there is a demographic change in border areas, it threatens national security. It compromises national integrity, sovereignty and progress and creates social tension. No country hands over its territory to illegal immigrants. It is our duty towards our forefathers, whose sacrifices brought us Independence, not to tolerate such acts,"" Modi said. He went on to announce the mission to address illegal immigration in a planned manner and within a time frame.Modi, during his Independence Day speech, also hailed the successful counter-operations against Left-wing extremists (LWE), saying tribal youths are now no longer misguided into picking up the gun.Stating that the number of districts under LWE influence is down to 20 from 125, the PM described the reclaiming of large tracts of tribal land from Maoists and saving of tribal youths from losing their lives to violent extremism, as a fitting tribute to tribal icon Birsa Munda on his 150th birth anniversary.The first-ever govt initiative to address illegal immigration, which has over the decades seen alleged Bangladeshi settlers alter the demography of border areas in Assam, West Bengal and even Bihar and Jharkhand, with an exponential rise in Muslims as share of the population, comes even as opposition parties are up in arms against the ongoing special intensive revision (SIR) of Bihar's electoral rolls, which requires electors registered after 2003 to submit proof of citizenship. The exercise has seen the exclusion of 65 lakh electors from the draft roll, including around 1.2 lakh who could not be traced. EC suspects these may be illegal immigrants.Dealing with illegal immigrants is a complex matter as the powers to detect and deport foreigners are delegated to states, and political and votebank considerations often keep those governed by opposition parties from taking any action. The demography mission may suggest ways to get around these challenges.On the Naxal front, Modi said there was a time when Bastar was identified with Naxalism, guns and bombs. ""Today the same Bastar is seeing its youth participate with enthusiasm in the Bastar Olympics. The areas once known as 'Red Corridor' are now becoming 'green corridors' of development. Areas once marked by 'Red' terror on India's map now have the tricolour of the Constitution, law and development flying high,"" he said.",Pm narendra modi announces setting up of a 'high-powered demographic mission' to address these challenges.

NEW DELHI: RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat has said the stray dog issue in Delhi-NCR should be addressed through measures to regulate their population, rather than confining them to shelters - an approach that echoes the Animal Birth Control (ABC) rules mandated under law. Bhagwat's comments come amid renewed debate over the Supreme Court's Aug 11 order directing Delhi-NCR authorities to permanently relocate all strays to shelters.""All animals have the right to live. The problem can be solved only by regulating the population of street dogs, but it cannot be resolved by putting them in shelters,"" said Bhagwat, a veterinary science graduate, while addressing a religious congregation at Jawaharlal Nehru Indoor Stadium in Cuttack Thursday. He added, ""Sheltering all street dogs is not a practical solution. The only effective way is to implement sterilisation and vaccination, as already prescribed in law. ""He referred to a cultural practice involving cattle rearing, saying that while milking a cow, some milk is taken for human use and the rest is left for the calf. ""This is the art of striking a balance between man and nature. Nature should be conserved by maintaining a balance between development and the environment,"" he said.SC's Aug 11 order has been criticised by politicians, animal rights groups and scientists, who argue it contradicts the ABC (Dogs) Rules, 2023.

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Friday announced plans for a grand celebration of the second birth centenary of renowned 19th century social reformer Jyotiba Phule, in what can be seen as an important gesture to OBCs who revere the anti-caste activist, who also championed women's education.""In the near future, we will be marking the 200th birth anniversary of the great social reformer Jyotiba Phule. We are going to begin the celebrations for this anniversary. Phule's principles and the mantra ""priority to the backward"" are an inspiration for us,"" said Modi. The proposed celebrations mark the elevation of Phule, who was born into Mali caste, to the national pantheon. BJP included Phule and his wife Savitribai, known for her 'passionate and tireless' advocacy for women's education, among its gallery of icons long ago. But Modi's plans for his bicentenary turn the embrace into a warm hug.Modi said his govt is working to implement Phule's mantra. ""By giving priority to the backward, we want to reach the heights of transformation. We want to put in our utmost effort for this. Through transparent policies, we wish to make ""priority to backward"" a reality on the ground, bringing it into the lives of every backward person"".The remarks were seen from multiple prisms, including the impending decision on vice president, choice of the new BJP chief, and Bihar polls where OBCs will play the decisive role.Phule, for long, has been a major influence on the OBCs in Bihar, with many among the intermediate castes of Kushwahas and Koeris, who, like Malis, are engaged in horticulture, regarding him as one of their own.The PM also spoke about Dalits and other deprived sections while stressing the need for govt to be proactive about improving lives. ""Whether they are Dalits, the oppressed, the exploited, or the deprived, govt should be proactively positive for them, govt should be pro-people,"" he said.Modi said some people suffer from the misperception that his govt was implementing schemes for welfare of the deprived sections the same way as its predecessors. ""We are implementing schemes on the ground. We emphasise saturation because if there is any true execution of social justice, it is in saturation where no eligible person is left out.""Phule's bicentenary celebrations would mark the co-option by BJP of a second legendary social reformer from Maharashtra, after B R Ambedkar was formally inducted into its 'Hall of Inspirations'. The practice of adopting even those who had once seemed incompatible with the party's original ethos has gone hand-in-hand with the expansion of its base beyond the core. It gathered momentum under Modi who, as PM, moved vigorously to identify the party with Ambedkar's legacy.","Pm narendra modi announced plans for a grand celebration of the second birth centenary of 19th century social reformer jyotiba phule.

NEW DELHI: Chief Justice Bhushan Gavai, only the second from the Dalit community to head the judiciary, on Friday said the journey for building a just, equal and inclusive India is not yet complete though appointment of Droupadi Murmu , daughter of a poor tribal family, as President, illustrates the distance the country has covered towards achieving the goal.In his Independence Day speech in Supreme Court, the CJI said, ""It is the destiny of India that the Santhal community, which was among the first to rise against the British in 1855, now has its daughter, President Droupadi Murmu, holding the highest constitutional office in the land."" ""Her journey from a small village in Odisha to Rashtrapati Bhavan is a testament to how far we have travelled. And yet, we must remember that the work of building a just, equal, and inclusive India is far from complete,"" he said after hoisting the tricolour at SC.He said judges of the constitutional courts have the responsibility to promote, protect, imbibe, and defend the ideals of liberty, equality, and fraternity. He reiterated the judges of constitutional courts, HCs and SC, are co-equals and must bear the responsibility of giving ""a broader, more purposive interpretation to the values of the Constitution"". Only when the rights of the marginalised are protected will Mahatma Gandhi's Swaraj be real and Ambedkar's idea of democracy be complete, the CJI said.Hours after PM mentioned the contributions of Jyotirao and Savitribai Phule, CJI Gavai said, ""From the hills of today's Jharkhand, where the Santhals lit the first flames of rebellion, to the forests of Chota Nagpur where Birsa Munda dreamed of dignity, from the humble school in Pune where Jyotirao and Savitribai Phule opened the doors of learning to the excluded, to the renunciation of a knighthood by Tagore in protest against injustice, from crafting of our Constitution by Babasaheb Ambedkar, to the moral compass of Mahatma Gandhi, our freedom was forged not in one place, nor by one people, but by courage of many, united by one dream of equal India.

SRINAGAR: Chief minister Omar Abdullah decried Friday the practice of tying terror attacks to J&K’s political fate and asserted that Pakistan should not be allowed to influence it through terrorism, a day after Supreme Court observed that “incidents like Pahalgam” must be considered when deciding on statehood.“Will the killers of Pahalgam and their masters in the neighbouring country decide whether we will be a state?” Omar said in his Independence Day speech, his first since taking office last Oct and the first by a CM since Article 370’s abrogation and J&K’s conversion into a Union territory Aug 2019.Speaking at Srinagar’s Bakshi Stadium, Omar termed SC’s reference to Pahalgam “unfortunate” and asked: “What kind of justice is it? Every time we are close to statehood, they will do something to sabotage it. Is this fair? Why are we being punished for a crime in which we had no role?” He pointed out that “J&K’s residents from Kathua to Kupwara” had protested the Pahalgam massacre of April 22 in which 26 people, mostly tourists, were gunned down.The CM announced a signature campaign across all 90 constituencies of J&K in the next eight weeks with the aim of submitting signatures to Supreme Court in support of restoring statehood and to take “people’s voice directly to Delhi”.The top court on Thursday gave Centre eight weeks to respond to petitions seeking statehood. “Me and my colleagues will use these eight weeks to go to each constituency,” Omar said.In his speech steeped in lament, the CM cited reports in various quarters about an “announcement this Independence Day from Delhi” -- an allusion to restoration of statehood. “I had hoped that in some corner of today’s (PM Narendra Modi’s) speech, there would be an announcement for J&K. We were told the papers are ready and it’s only a matter of time. But nothing happened.”Expressing his anguish further, Omar said he wished no one became the CM of a Union Territory with an assembly -- like J&K --comparing the National Conference (NC) govt he leads to “a horse asked to run with two front legs tied”. “It has nothing except pain and anxieties. I have been chief minister of the state and now of the UT. The system of dual governance is not for success but for instilling defeat.”The Omar-led govt does not control key departments such as home, which is vested with Centre-appointed lieutenant-governor (LG) Manoj Sinha.Omar said he had never imagined before taking office that his cabinet’s decisions “could be altered or thrown into the dustbin”, remarks seen as an allusion to the LG’s overriding powers. “I am accountable to the assembly and assembly members to the people. But the bureaucracy in the present system is not answerable to the elected representatives.”","Chief minister omar abdullah decries practice of tying terror attacks to j&k's political fate.

KISHTWAR: The death toll in the cloudburst-triggered flash flood that devastated Chishoti in J&K's Kishtwar district rose to at least 60 on Friday as rescue workers dug out more bodies from the debris of a pilgrim campsite along the Machail Mata trail that bore the brunt of the calamity. Dozens are still reported missing, raising the possibility of casualties spiking as the hours tick by.Uprooted trees, boulders the size of houses and mounds of sludge sat where rows of tents and food stalls had been set up to cater to pilgrims either making their way to the ancient Machail Mata temple – 8.5km from the site – or making a stopover on their way back.Remnants of a wooden bridge, a rucksack, shoes entangled in the branches of uprooted pines and cars half buried under the rubble spoke of the gale force with which the sudden flooding occurred. Many of the victims were pilgrims having lunch at the langar (community kitchen) there.CM Omar Abdullah, who cancelled his ""At Home"" tea party scheduled for Independence Day after the disaster, reached Kishtwar on Friday to take stock. He told reporters that besides the confirmed deaths and those still missing, over 100 people were injured in the disaster.Officials said 167 survivors had been rescued till late Friday, while 69 other people believed to have been there at the time of the cloudburst were still to be found.Witnesses said they heard what sounded like a blast, followed by a ferocious burst of water and boulders and logs tearing through the pilgrims' campsite and the vicinity.""Within two minutes of the cloudburst, we were trapped in water up to our knees,"" said Suresh Mehra, who was on the Machail Mata pilgrimage with five relatives. ""We hurried to what appeared to be the safer side of the village. When he turned around to look, the site behind us was ravaged.""An injured pilgrim receiving treatment at Kishtwar district hospital said everything happened in a flash. ""We had just finished tea in a restaurant when we heard security personnel asking us to run. My sister and nephew are still missing. It was over in seconds,"" he said.Braving intermittent rains, rescuers continued their search for survivors for the second consecutive day. They used excavators to remove the rubble in a desperate attempt to find the bodies.The annual 40-day pilgrimage, which attracts over 3 lakh pilgrims, was scheduled to end on September 5, but has been suspended.""People should share the photos of their missing relatives. We retrieved 46 bodies yesterday and hope to retrieve more bodies from the rubble,"" BJP legislator Sunil Sharma said.""I have received countless phone calls from relatives of the missing,"" said Pooja Thakur, chairperson of the Kishtwar District Development Council. We have no idea how many are dead. Some of the bodies we found were unrecognisable.""The administration has set up a control room-cum-help desk in Padder, about 15km from Chashoti, to assist people looking for missing people.There are two villages ahead of the cloudburst-hit belt – Machail and Hamori – where hundreds of people are stranded, officials said.","Death toll in cloudburst-triggered flash flood in j&k's kishtwar district rises to at least 60.
