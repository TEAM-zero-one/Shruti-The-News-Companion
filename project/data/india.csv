Indian NGO Highlights Dalits, Minorities Rights In India At UNHRC Side Event

NEW DELHI: Unveiling details of his brain child ‘Unified Judicial Policy’ (UJP), CJI Surya Kant on Saturday said courts will give top priority to cases relating to personal liberty, ensure predictability in decisions relating to commercial and economic matters to foster investor confidence, and deal empathetically with disputes relating to family, consumers and social justice.Speaking at the Regional Judicial Conference at Jaisalmer, the CJI said citizens approach courts not only to seek remedies but with the hope that the law will be applied consistently, liberties will be guarded, rights will be clarified and govts will be held accountable.He said predictability of the justice delivery system, pruned of legal jargon, is important to further public understanding and maintain faith in the system. Predictability is rooted in consistency, reason, precedent and timely disposal, he said, adding, “investors look for it, accused persons rely on it, families hope for it and society depends on it.”“A justice system that operates unpredictably or without clear guiding principles inevitably weakens public confidence because litigants cannot anticipate how similar cases will be treated or when their matters will be resolved,” CJI Kant said.“When judicial outcomes reflect principled reasoning, consistent application of law and transparent evolution of doctrine, confidence in the courts is strengthened, as people come to understand justice is not dependent on chance but guided by established norms. ”Technology has evolved into a constitutional instrument that strengthens equality before the law, expands access to justice and enhances institutional efficiency. It allows the judiciary to transcend physical barriers and bureaucratic rigidities to deliver outcomes that are timely, transparent and principled.Justice systems, one headed by HCs in the states and the other operated nationally by SC, are not operating in parallel, he said while underscoring the need for UJP, under which technology will be the engine to ensure convergence of the two systems by harmonising procedural norms, prioritising cases, removing delays and formatting coherently judgments across jurisdictions. “But technology alone cannot sustain the Rule of Law; it must operate alongside the deeper constitutional traditions that anchor judicial behaviour and preserve institutional coherence,” he said.CJI Kant said uniformity in judgment and reasoning is a must in cases of similar nature. “A Unified Judicial Policy is not merely an administrative doctrine; it is the architecture of constitutional confidence. It strengthens the idea that our courts are not isolated entities but parts of one Republic, driven by common values, delivering coherent justice,” he said.“Ultimately, the measure of innovation is not the complexity of the software we deploy, but the simplicity with which a citizen understands the outcome of their case and believes that justice has been served,” he stressed.",Chief justice of india surya kant unveils details of his brain child ‘unified judicial policy’ (ujp) he says courts will give top priority to cases relating to personal liberty.

Heart disease leading cause of sudden deaths under 45: Study,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/heart-disease-leading-cause-of-sudden-deaths-under-45-study/articleshow/125954017.cms,"Keep your heart young post-30s with these 4 simple ways

.

NEW DELHI: Sudden deaths are no longer confined to old age. An AIIMS study has found that more than half of all sudden deaths examined over a year occurred in people under 45 — many of them apparently healthy, who collapsed without warning at home or while travelling.Published this month in Indian Journal of Medical Research as part of an ongoing Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) project, the cross-sectional study was conducted between May 2023 and April 2024 at the departments of pathology and forensic medicine at AIIMS New Delhi. Of the 2,214 autopsies analysed, 180 cases — 8.1% — met the criteria for sudden death. Young adults aged 18–45 accounted for 103 of these cases, or 57.2%, with an average age of 33.6 years and a strong male predominance.Heart disease emerged as the leading cause. Dr Sudhir Gupta, from AIIMS’s department of forensic medicine and an author of the study, said cardiovascular conditions accounted for 42.6% of sudden deaths in the young. Most had advanced coronary artery disease with severe blockages, often without any prior diagnosis, indicating that fatal heart disease had progressed silently. Respiratory causes — such as pneumonia, tuberculosis and asphyxia — accounted for a little over one in five deaths.More than one-fifth of deaths in young adults remained unexplained despite detailed imaging, full autopsy and microscopic examination. These “negative autopsy” cases point to hidden electrical or genetic heart disorders that routine investigations may miss.Most deaths occurred at home or during travel, frequently at night or early morning. Sudden loss of consciousness was the most common symptom reported by families, followed by chest pain and breathlessness. Only a small number of young adults had known conditions such as diabetes or hypertension.Lifestyle risks were common across the cases examined. Over half of those who died young were smokers or consumed alcohol — rates similar to those for older adults. The study found no significant link between sudden deaths and Covid infection or vaccination — vaccination coverage was high across age groups.Among adults aged 46–65, coronary artery disease was even more predominant, accounting for over 70% of sudden deaths.Commenting on the findings, Dr K K Talwar, chairman, PSRI Heart Institute, said the study highlights a disturbing rise in premature coronary artery disease. He noted that many unexplained deaths occur likely due to inherited electrical disorders of the heart, which routine autopsies cannot detect, underscoring the need for genetic testing and family screening. He stressed early preventive check-ups, strict avoidance of tobacco and alcohol, and routine heart evaluations in younger people, while reiterating there is no evidence linking Covid vaccination to sudden cardiac deaths.Researchers warn that sudden death in the young often stems from underlying disease, making early detection critical. With fatal events striking earlier in life, the study flags an urgent public health challenge: identifying silent heart disease before it turns deadly.","More than half of all sudden deaths examined over a year occurred in people under 45.

NEW DELHI: With air quality worsening sharply across the Delhi-NCR, authorities on Saturday invoked the strictest restrictions under Stage IV of the Graded Response Action Plan, triggering emergency curbs across the region. This comes hours after implementation of GRAP stage III measured in the national capital region.The Commission for Air Quality Management said its GRAP sub-committee had decided to enforce all measures under Stage IV or ‘Severe+’ air quality with immediate effect after pollution levels crossed critical thresholds. In an official statement, the panel said, “Keeping in view the prevailing trend of air quality and in an effort to prevent further deterioration of air quality in the region, the CAQM Sub-Committee on GRAP decides to invoke all actions as envisaged under Stage-IV of the extant GRAP ‘Severe+’ Air Quality (DELHI AQI > 450), with immediate effect, in the entire NCR. ” It added that these steps would be in addition to restrictions already in force under Stages I, II and III.In an official order, the government directed that all administrative secretaries and heads of departments shall attend office regularly, with no more than 50 per cent staff strength physically present.""The remaining 50 per cent staff shall work from home, provided that the Administrative Secretaries and Heads of Departments can call officers/officials to the office, as required to ensure uninterrupted delivery of essential and emergency public services,"" the order read.Likewise, the order stipulated that all private offices operating within Delhi shall function with no more than 50 per cent staff physically attending the workplace.""The remaining staff shall mandatorily work from home,"" it added. The order also urged all private entities to implement staggered working hours where feasible. Furthermore, private offices have been instructed to ensure strict compliance with work-from-home norms and minimise vehicular movement related to office commutes.""Hospitals and other public/private health establishments, Fire Services, Prisons, Public Transport, Electricity, Water, Sanitation and related municipal services, disaster management and related services, forest and environment departments/agencies engaged in air pollution control, monitoring, and enforcement activities (like teams deployed to curb biomass burning, dust control, GRAP measures, etc. ), and other essential/emergency services shall be exempted from these directions,"" the order said.The decision came hours after Delhi slipped back into the ‘severe’ category, prompting the reimposition of Stage III curbs earlier in the day. According to official data, the city’s Air Quality Index, which stood at 349 on Friday evening, surged overnight and was recorded at 401 by Saturday morning due to slow wind speeds, a stable atmosphere and unfavourable meteorological conditions that hampered the dispersion of pollutants.According to news agency ANI, As of 7.00 PM, AQI readings were 488 in Anand Vihar, 434 in Ashok Vihar, 496 in Bawana, 457 in Burari, 479 in Chandini Chowk, 394 in IGI Airport, and 445 in Okhla Phase-2.Also read: Delhi AQI turns 'severe': GRAP Stage III reimposed across NCR; what's allowed & what's not A dense layer of smog enveloped the capital on Saturday morning, reducing visibility and intensifying health concerns. Wazirpur recorded the worst air quality with an AQI of 445, followed by Vivek Vihar at 444, Jahangirpuri at 442 and Anand Vihar at 439. Several other areas, including Rohini, Ashok Vihar, Narela, Mundka and Bawana, also remained in the ‘severe’ range.Poor air quality conditions extended beyond Delhi, with parts of Uttar Pradesh also reporting dense smog. Noida sectors recorded AQI levels of 448, while visibility dropped in cities such as Bulandshahr, Ayodhya and Mainpuri amid fog and haze.Under CPCB norms, an AQI between 401 and 500 is classified as ‘severe’ and poses serious health risks, particularly for children, the elderly and those with respiratory ailments.

The governor has given written permission to the UP government to go ahead in its wholly illegal and unjust attempt to subvert the processes of justice and to withdraw the entire case even though the main witness has already given evidence,” she said in letter.Karat highlighted that the victim’s daughter had already testified in court, naming and identifying all accused, with two other direct witnesses yet to give statements.She alleged that the UP government cited minor grounds such as use of lathis instead of guns, lack of personal animosity, and potential communal tension to justify withdrawing the case. “This is motivated not to meet the ends of justice but to subvert the entire judicial process,” Karat wrote.She also questioned whether the governor had a duty to counsel the state government against such a move.“Should the governor not counsel the government against such a step? Is it not the duty of the governor to uphold the Constitution and the rule of law?” she asked.Karat urged the President to intervene and direct the governor to revoke the permission given to the state to withdraw the case. She noted the urgency, as the government affidavit, approved by the governor, was scheduled to be discussed in court on December 12 but was postponed at the prosecution’s request.The Dadri lynching, which sparked nationwide outrage, occurred after a mob attacked Akhlaq and his son following an alleged temple announcement claiming he had slaughtered a cow.

NEW DELHI: Central Bureau of Investigation ( CBI ) on Saturday opposed former Bihar Chief Minister Rabri Devi’s request to transfer criminal cases from the court of Special Judge Vishal Gogne, arguing before a Delhi court that the plea amounted to “forum-shopping” and was meant to “demean the judge” and interfere with the justice system.Appearing before Principal District and Sessions Judge Dinesh Bhatt, Senior Advocate DP Singh, representing the CBI, said the transfer application made unfounded allegations against the judiciary and was an attempt to pressure the trial court. He maintained that an accused has no right to seek a change of forum merely because the case is not proceeding in their favour.“You cannot bulldoze a court. You cannot go forum shopping. You cannot demean a judge,” Singh told the court, stressing that such conduct strikes at the independence and dignity of the judicial process.The CBI counsel submitted that Special Judge Gogne had acted strictly in accordance with procedures laid down by higher courts and established judicial practice. He argued that the transfer plea was filed with the intention of stalling the trial at a critical stage.Addressing Rabri Devi’s allegation that Judge Gogne had intentionally delayed the order on framing of charges in the IRCTC corruption case to align with the enforcement of the Model Code of Conduct for the Bihar elections, Singh rejected the claim as baseless.He explained that the court had merely sought clarifications from the investigating agency, which was part of its judicial duty.“These clarifications were sought for the court’s clarity and conscience. It is the duty of the judge to ask questions,” Singh submitted.Judge Bhatt heard the submissions in detail and scheduled the matter for further hearing on December 15, 2025.In her application, Rabri Devi sought the transfer of four cases pending before Judge Gogne, in which she and several members of her family are named as accused. The cases include the IRCTC scam, the alleged land-for-jobs case, and related money-laundering proceedings.Earlier, on October 13, Judge Gogne framed criminal charges against RJD chief Lalu Prasad Yadav , Rabri Devi, Tejashwi Yadav, and others in the IRCTC case.Rabri Devi alleged in her plea that the special judge is biased and conducting the trials with a premeditated mindset. She has claimed that he is “unduly inclined” towards the prosecution, creating a reasonable apprehension of bias. The CBI has rejected these allegations, describing them as an effort to scandalise the court and delay the trial.","Rabri devi seeks transfer of four cases pending before special judge vishal gogne.

Enough is enough !""Listing his demands, Adhikari said, ""FULL 100% REFUND for every gallery ticket holder, return every paisa you stole,"" called for the ""IMMEDIATE ARREST of Sports Minister Arup Biswas, Fire Minister Sujit Bose, and sham organizer Shatadru Dutta,"" and asserted that ""MAMATA BANERJEE MUST RESIGN for dragging West Bengal's name through the mud on the global stage.""The BJP leader’s remarks came hours after chaos erupted at the stadium, where thousands of fans protested after failing to get a clear view of Messi during the much-publicised event. Messi, accompanied by Luis Suárez and Rodrigo De Paul, arrived at the venue around 11.30 am but remained tightly cordoned off by security and VIPs. His brief appearance and early exit sparked anger among spectators, leading to vandalism, slogan-shouting and a police baton charge to control the crowd.Meanwhile, BJP MP and spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi in a press conference said, ""The kind of mismanagement and sophistry took place, ashamed every Indian... Mamata Banerjee tweeted that she is 'deeply disturbed by this event', but I want to clear that it is West Bengal which is deeply devastated under your rule... This is the evidence of the tragic situation the state has reached... Similar situation happened in Bengaluru after IPL and in Tamil Nadu as well. .. This shows that the leadership in these states consider itself above the law... This shows the character of all the leaders of INDI alliance...""Following the incident, Banerjee expressed shock over the mismanagement and ordered a high-level enquiry. In a post on X, she apologised to Messi and football fans, saying, “I am deeply disturbed and shocked by the mismanagement witnessed today at Salt Lake stadium.” She announced that a committee headed by retired Calcutta High Court judge Justice Ashim Kumar Ray would investigate the episode, fix responsibility and recommend corrective measures.The disorder also drew criticism from Bengal governor C V Ananda Bose, who termed it a dark day for Kolkata’s sports culture and called for action against the organisers. Ticket prices for the event ranged from Rs 4,500 to Rs 10,000, and many fans said they had spent large sums only to leave disappointed.The episode has since escalated into a political flashpoint, with the BJP accusing the Trinamool Congress of turning a marquee sporting event into what Adhikari described as a ""corrupt circus,"" while the state government has promised accountability through a formal probe.","Messi’s kolkata visit turns chaotic as angry fans vandalise banners at salt lake stadium.

‘Dhurandar in rebranding’: Congress slams BJP for renaming MGNREGA; questions hatred for Gandhi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/dhurandar-in-rebranding-congress-slams-bjp-for-renaming-mgnrega-questions-hatred-for-gandhi/articleshow/125948666.cms,"Congress Questions BJP’s Renaming Of MGNREGA, Hits Out At Gandhi Hatred

NEW DELHI: The Congress on Saturday criticised the Central government after the Union cabinet approved a bill to rename the Mahatma Gandhi national rural employment guarantee act ( MGNREGA ), questioning why Mahatma Gandhi’s name needed to be dropped and accusing the Centre of focusing on rebranding rather than reform.Reacting to the Cabinet decision, Congress general secretary in-charge communications Jairam Ramesh said the government was a “dhurandhar” at renaming schemes and laws. “They renamed the Nirmal Bharat Abhiyan to Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, and the rural LPG distribution programme to Ujjwala. They are experts in re-packaging and branding,” he told PTI.Ramesh questioned the rationale behind the move, saying, “They hate Pandit Nehru but it seems they also hate Mahatma Gandhi. What’s wrong with the name Mahatma Gandhi, why rename the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act to Pujya Bapu Employment Guarantee Scheme?”PTI citing Sources said the Cabinet on Friday cleared a Bill to rename the scheme as ‘Pujya Bapu Grameen Rozgar Yojna’ and increase the guaranteed number of workdays from the current 100 to 125 days.Congress general secretary in-charge organisation K C Venugopal said Prime Minister Narendra Modi , who had earlier described MGNREGA as a “monument of failure”, was now renaming the scheme to claim credit for it.“It’s yet another way of erasing Mahatma Gandhi from our national psyche, especially from the villages, where, he said, India’s soul resides,” he alleged in a post on X.Venugopal also accused the government of neglecting the scheme, saying the renaming was a “cosmetic change”.“MGNREGA workers have been demanding higher wages, but the Centre has been reducing allocated funds for the scheme year after year,” he said, alleging that mounting arrears reflected a “carefully planned strategy to engineer a slow death for the scheme”.“But Mr Modi, rename it all you want, the people know it was Dr Manmohan Singh ji and Smt Sonia Gandhi ji who brought this transformative scheme to every village of India,” Venugopal added.Enacted in 2005, MGNREGA is a flagship rural employment programme that guarantees at least 100 days of wage employment in a financial year to rural households whose adult members undertake unskilled manual work.","Congress questions bjp’s renaming of mgnrega, hits out at gandhi hatred.

NEW DELHI: The storm over the chief ministerial post resurfaced again after Congress MLA H A Iqbal Hussain on Saturday claimed that D K Shivakumar will take over the top job on January 6.Hussain said that DKS should be made the chief minister and that CM Siddaramaiah should vacate the post for him. He predicted that “there is a 99 per cent chance” that DKS will become CM on January 6.When asked about the significance of the date, he said, “I don’t know. It’s just a random number. Everybody is saying this. It can either be January 6 or 9. These are the two dates.”Hussain has been demanding that Shivakumar be made the chief minister. On Friday, he had made his wish public.This comes a day after DKS met over 30 Congress legislators and ministers for a dinner meeting late Thursday night in Belagavi, amid ongoing speculation about potential leadership changes in the state government.According to news agency PTI sources, the dinner gathering included prominent ministers K H Muniyappa, Mankal Vaidya and Dr M C Sudhakar, and several MLAs, including N A Haris, Ramesh Bandisiddegowda, H C Balakrishna, Ganesh Hukkeri, Darshan Dhruvanarayana, Ashok Kumar Rai and K Y Nanjegowda.As the Congress government reached the halfway mark in the state, reports quoting Congress sources suggested that MLAs and MLCs from Shivakumar’s faction had camped in Delhi to push the party high command to make him the next chief minister.DK Shivakumar further fuelled speculation after claiming that there had indeed been “a confidential understanding on leadership transition among five-six leaders” soon after the Congress won a landslide victory in the 2023 elections.The deputy chief minister made the first reference to the power pact but stopped short of divulging more details. “This is confidential. I don’t want to speak publicly on this,” he said.Amid the ongoing speculation, the party high command had recently instructed both Siddaramaiah and Shivakumar to meet over breakfast at each other’s residences. This move was seen as an attempt to pause the leadership tussle between the two leaders.These breakfast meetings were also interpreted as a signal of Siddaramaiah’s continuation as chief minister for the immediate future, particularly ahead of the Belagavi legislature session.","Siddaramaiah, dk shivakumar project unity after high-stakes karnataka meet amid rumours of cong rift.

'Watershed moment'

Tharoor congratulates NDA

'A detailed review will be conducted at all levels'

NEW DELHI: Bharatiya Janata Party-led NDA on Saturday made massive gains in Kerala after clinching a majority in the Thiruvananthapuram civic body elections -- held by Left parties for 45 years.Out of 101 wards in the Thiruvananthapuram Corporation, the BJP won 50, the LDF 29, the UDF 19, while two went to independent candidates.Additionally, the NDA retained the Palakkad municipality after a close battle with the Congress-led UDF and wrested the Thrippunithura Municipality from the grand old party.In Thrissur, the BJP won 18 out of the 46 wards in Kodungallur Municipality, eight in Thrissur Corporation, two each in Guruvayoor and Vadakkancherry municipalities, seven in Kunnamkulam Municipality, six in Irinjalakuda Municipality and one in Chalakudy Municipality. It also won four wards in block panchayats and 167 in grama panchayats, but none in the district panchayat in Thrissur district.According to the State Election Commission, the NDA has won 1,402 grama panchayat wards and 53 block panchayat wards across Kerala.These also include 11 wards in the Kollam Corporation, 13 in the Kozhikode Corporation, four in the Kannur Corporation and six in the Kochi Corporation, where it finished third in these local bodies.This comes as the Kerala Assembly election is scheduled for April next year. In the 2021 polls, the BJP had drawn a blank, while the Left Democratic Front retained power with 99 seats. Meanwhile, the United Democratic Front won the remaining 41 seats in the 140-member assembly.Prime Minister Narendra Modi termed the mandate received by the BJP-led NDA in the Thiruvananthapuram Corporation a “watershed moment” in Kerala politics and expressed gratitude to BJP workers for the “spectacular results”.“Thank you Thiruvananthapuram! The mandate the BJP-NDA got in the Thiruvananthapuram Corporation is a watershed moment in Kerala’s politics,” he wrote on X.PM Modi said people were certain that the development aspirations of Kerala could only be addressed by the BJP. “Our party will work towards this vibrant city’s growth and boost ‘Ease of Living’ for the people,” he said, using the hashtag #VikasitaThiruvananthapuram.BJP leader Shaun George expressed confidence that the NDA would make gains in central and south Kerala, claiming a shift of traditional UDF and Kerala Congress voters towards the BJP.“We are very confident that the BJP will secure a good margin in the central Kerala belt, and we will also achieve a strong victory this time in south Kerala. People who have traditionally depended on the UDF and Kerala Congress will shift their support to the BJP this time,” he told news agency ANI.Meanwhile, Congress MP Shashi Tharoor congratulated the BJP on its historic performance in Kerala, saying the results show a notable shift in the capital’s political landscape.“What a day of amazing results in the Kerala local self-government elections! The mandate is clear, and the democratic spirit of the state shines through,” Tharoor said on X.“A huge congratulations to @UDFKerala for a truly impressive win across various local bodies! This is a massive endorsement and a powerful signal ahead of the state legislative elections. Hard work, a strong message and anti-incumbency have all clearly paid off to achieve a much better result than in 2020,” the Congress MP said.“I also want to acknowledge the historic performance of the BJP in Thiruvananthapuram, and offer humble congratulations on their significant victory in the city Corporation — a strong showing that marks a notable shift in the capital’s political landscape. I campaigned for a change from 45 years of LDF misrule, but the voters have ultimately rewarded another party that also sought a clear change in governance,” he added.CPM state secretary MV Govindan expressed shock over the result and said a detailed review will be conducted at all levels and necessary corrections will be made.""The LDF has suffered an unexpected setback. A detailed review will be conducted at all levels and necessary corrections will be made. The LDF in Kerala has a history of moving forward by making timely course corrections, and it had effectively overcome the defeat of 2010,"" He said.""There has been no fundamental erosion in the base of the Left Democratic Front. The UDF contested the elections by aligning with communal forces. There were instances where UDF votes went to the BJP and BJP votes were transferred to defeat the LDF,"" he added.""Despite claims of a BJP victory in the Thiruvananthapuram Corporation, the party failed to make significant gains elsewhere. The LDF has won the Pandalam Municipality, which includes key centres linked to Sabarimala. In the previous local body elections, the LDF had secured a massive victory, and the state government has delivered unparalleled achievements to Kerala. Why these achievements did not translate into electoral gains needs to be examined. Possible organisational shortcomings will also be reviewed in detail. The party will reach out more to the people and move forward. By analysing the setbacks in the elections and making necessary corrections, the LDF will overcome this phase. If there was strong anti-LDF sentiment, how could the front have won seven district panchayats?” he further said.","The bjp won 50 out of 101 wards in the thiruvananthapuram corporation.

Duo purchased flight tickets on Dec 7, lookout circular issued within 24 hrs

Saurabh and Gaurav Luthra, co-owners of 'Birch by Romeo Lane' nightclub in Goa, were detained by Thai police early on Thursday on the request of Indian law enforcement agencies. As their passports were suspended, they became persona non grata in Thailand, prompting the local police to take them into custody, sources said.Sources said that a team of Thai police located them at Hotel Indigo in Patong, Phuket, based on their travel and passport details and seized their belongings and luggage. Their pictures in Phuket police's custody were released on Thursday and showed the duo handcuffed. They were subsequently shifted to the immigration detention centre where they are likely to be lodged till their deportation. The cops are hopeful of the brothers' return to India by the end of this week with formal channels in communication with each other. India and Thailand had signed a formal extradition treaty in 2013, which came into force in 2015.A team has been sent to Phuket to coordinate the deportation, sources said. The brothers have turned 'wanted' after fleeing the country following last week's blaze at their club in Goa that claimed 25 lives. They had fled to Phuket, Thailand and were staying at a hotel.Goa police had requested Interpol, through MEA and CBI, for their apprehension. A blue corner notice was subsequently issued against them by Interpol.The regional passport office in Delhi had issued a notice to the brothers seeking an explanation from both as to why action should not be initiated to impound their passports within seven days. Their passports were subsequently declared invalid, easing the execution of Indian request for their detention.According to Goa police, the brothers purchased seats on a Phuket-bound flight at 1.17 am on Dec 7, even as firefighting operations were under way. By 5.30 am, they were airborne on IndiGo flight 6E-1073.By morning, a Goa police team had reached Delhi with an arrest warrant for the Luthra brothers and searched their residential and office premises, but they were not found. ""Since they were unavailable, a notice under the appropriate sections of law was pasted at their residence. By the evening of Dec 7, a lookout circular was issued against both by the Bureau of Immigration at the request of Goa police,"" a police officer said.The blaze broke out around 11.45pm Saturday (Dec 6) during an event attended by more than 150 tourists. A preliminary investigation by Goa police and Directorate of Fire Services found it was triggered when electric firecrackers struck the wooden ceiling. As flames coursed through the roof, guests and performers bolted. While most of them were able to step out of the club, many were trapped in the basement after the exit caught fire.Besides a partner named Ajay Gupta, five staff members of Birch, chief general manager Rajiv Modak, gate manager Priyanshu Thakur, bar manager Rajveer Singhania, general manager Vivek Singh, and operations manager Bharat Kohli have been arrested till now.","Goa club owners saurabh & gaurav luthra arrested in phuket after deadly fire.duo purchased flight tickets on dec 7, lookout circular issued within 24 hrs.

Her mother, unable to cope with the emotional and financial stress caused by loss of the family's sole breadwinner, remarried. Pakeeza was taken in by her grandparents who raised her despite their advancing age. On Saturday, Pakeeza's fortunes finally turned, thanks to J&K administration's decision to rehabilitate her with a govt job.Fozy Jan suffered similarly at the hands of terrorists when they forcibly entered her home in Qazigund, Anantnag in the year 2000 and took away her father and grandfather, only to kill them mercilessly shortly after. The loss of the two primary earning members pushed the family into a financial crisis. Twenty-five years later, she got closure with a govt job offer.Pakeeza and Fozy are two among the 39 next of kin of terror victims from Kashmir division of J&K, to be handed over appointment letters by J&K LG Manoj Sinha, ending their families' wait of more than two decades to be recognised and rehabilitated.Sinha said the move is part of the J&K administration's resolve to deliver justice, jobs and dignity to families torn apart as terrorists tortured and killed their loved ones.The families had to undergo years of hardship and emotional trauma, given that they were left to fend for themselves even as overground workers who aided terrorists were given govt jobs by the previous regimes.""For these families, the long wait for justice has ended today. With concrete steps for rehabilitation, we have restored their dignity and faith in the system,” LG Sinha said after distributing the appointment letters to the next-of-kin of terror victims.Both Shaista of Hyderpora, Srinagar, whose father Abdul Rashid Ganai was murdered in 2000, and Ishtiyaq Ahmad, the son of BSF braveheart Altaf Hussain who was martyred in a terrorist encounter 19 years ago, were handed appointment letters, ending their long battle for justice and bringing them economic stability.Justice was granted thirty years later to the family of Abdul Aziz Dar, a resident of Srinagar who was murdered by terrorists. The family of Late Abdul Rehman Lone, a special police officer (SPO) who was killed in 1999 inside his house, also had balm applied to their 26-year wound. Abdul's brother Md Ashraf Lone, who was forced to abandon studies and work as a labourer to sustain the family, will now lead a life of dignity as a govt employee.Irshad Ahmad Sofi, also an SPO, was killed by terrorists in 1999 at his residence in Bijbehara. He was ""punished"" by them for doing his duty by joining counter-terrorism operations. On Saturday, his sibling Irshad, who had to do odd jobs to make ends meet, was handed over an appointment letter.LG Sinha said that after the Abrogation of Article 370, the terror victim families have found new courage and self-confidence, and now they are speaking out against the terror ecosystem without fear.“For generations, the system had failed these victims by not giving their cases the priority they deserved. We are empowering victim's voices and ensuring they get their dues and rights they deserve. We are also committed for swift and fair justice to perpetrators,” he said.Sinha said that the Narendra Modi govt follows a zero-tolerance policy against terrorism in all its forms. ""Every available resource and means will be used to make J&K terrorism-free and those who are giving sanctuary, safe-haven or any other support to terrorists will have to pay a very heavy price,” he underlined.Appointment letters were handed over on Saturday to 39 other beneficiaries under the compassionate appointment rules and rehabilitation assistance scheme (RAS).As many as 156 family members of terror victims have been provided self-employment opportunities under various schemes, including Mission Yuva, Holistic Agriculture Development Program (HADP) and Prime Minister's Employment Generation Programme (PMEGP). Furthermore, 17 encroachments were removed from the properties belonging to terror victim families.Also, 36 terror victim families have been identified for house reconstruction. More families will be identified and included as the process continues. The reconstruction work for the houses of the families whose homes were destroyed due to Pakistani shelling in Uri and Karnah will commence in April.","Pakeeza riyaz was still a minor when her father riyaz ahmad was abducted by terrorists in anantnag and tortured to death in 1999.

NEW DELHI: Congress MP Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Saturday questioned the Centre’s reported decision to rename the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act MGNREGA ), arguing that the exercise would lead to unnecessary expenditure of government resources without delivering any clear benefit.Her remarks came a day after the Union cabinet approved a Bill to rename the scheme and increase the number of guaranteed workdays. According to these sources, MGNREGA will be renamed the ‘Poojya Bapu Grameen Rozgar Yojna’, with the annual work guarantee raised from 100 days to 125 days.Speaking to reporters, Priyanka Gandhi said she could not understand the rationale behind changing the name of a flagship rural employment programme enacted in 2005. “I can't understand what mentality is behind this. First, this is Mahatma Gandhi's name, and when it is changed, the government's resources are spent on it again. From offices to stationery, everything has to be renamed, so this is a big, costly process. So what's the benefit of doing this unnecessarily? I can't understand,” she said, as quoted by ANI.MGNREGA, also known as NREGA, is one of India’s largest social welfare schemes, aimed at enhancing livelihood security in rural areas.It guarantees at least 100 days of wage employment each financial year to rural households whose adult members volunteer for unskilled manual work. Any Indian citizen aged 18 or above and residing in a rural area can apply, with employment to be provided within 15 days. Wages are deposited directly into bank or post office accounts, with equal pay for men and women, and the scheme covers the entire country except fully urban districts.The proposed renaming has also drawn criticism from other opposition leaders. Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Priyanka Chaturvedi described the move as a “distraction” and accused the Centre of trying to divert public attention. “Because of the frustration, such decisions are being made. This is another way to distract attention,” she said, adding that those who know history “will always respect the Gandhi family for their contributions”.Chaturvedi also welcomed Lok Sabha Leader of the Opposition Rahul Gandhi’s call for a parliamentary discussion on air pollution, arguing that urgent issues affecting public health were being sidelined. Rahul Gandhi earlier urged all parties to work together to address what he described as a crisis destroying children’s futures, saying, “Most of our major cities are living under a blanket of poisonous air… This is not an ideological issue. ”",Congress mp priyanka gandhi vadra questioned the centre’s reported decision to rename the mahatma gandhi national rural employment guarantee act mgnrega. She argued that the exercise would lead to unnecessary expenditure of government resources without delivering any clear benefit.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125946348,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-35156,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"
