'Too harsh': Supreme Court modifies order on Delhi stray dogs - top quotes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/too-harsh-supreme-court-modifies-order-on-delhi-stray-dogs-top-quotes/articleshow/123451643.cms,"""The provision in Rule 11(19) that the dogs, upon sterilisation and immunisation, should be relocated to the same locality from which they have been picked up, is scientifically carved out inasmuch as it serves two purposes. Firstly, the same prevents the scope of overcrowding in the dog shelters/pounds, and secondly, the picked-up stray dogs after immunisation and sterilisation are relocated to the same environment where they were living earlier, which is a compassionate treatment,"" the court said.

""The aggressive sterilisation would definitely put a curb on the rapid growth of the stray dog population, ultimately leading to its reduction. However, this is possible only in an idealistic situation, which seems unlikely in the present scenario,"" the court said.

The court said, ""It was argued by some of the counsels appearing for the animal lovers that the process of sterilisation and inoculation has worked wonders in many towns across the country and has significantly brought down the population of stray dogs. To be specific, it was pointed out that towns like Dehradun and Lucknow, which have taken aggressive measures for sterilisation, etc., as per the ABC Rules, have seen a steady decline in the population of stray dogs. A suggestion has also been received that chemical castration is a safe, painless, and effective mode of sterilisation.""

""A blanket direction to pick up all the strays and place them in dog shelters/pounds without evaluating the existing infrastructure may lead to a catch-22 situation because such directions may be impossible to comply with. We, therefore, feel that a holistic approach requires mollification of the directions issued vide order dated 11th August, 2025,"" the court said.

Municipal authorities must continue complying with previous directions, but the bar on releasing picked-up strays has been kept in abeyance. Stray dogs are to be sterilised, dewormed, vaccinated, and then released in the same area, except in cases of rabies or aggressive behaviour. Such dogs must be kept in shelters after treatment.





Each municipal ward must establish designated feeding zones for stray dogs. Feeding on streets is prohibited, with violators facing legal action. Helplines are to be set up for reporting violations.





No individual or organisation may obstruct officials implementing these directions; obstruction will invite prosecution.





NGOs involved in the case must deposit Rs 2 lakh each, while individual dog lovers must deposit Rs 25,000 each, within seven days. These funds will be used for stray-dog infrastructure.





Citizens may formally adopt stray dogs through municipal bodies, ensuring adopted dogs do not return to the streets.





Municipalities must file compliance affidavits, detailing available facilities such as dog pounds, vets, capture staff, and vehicles.

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday reversed the August 11 order on the relocation of stray dogs in Delhi-NCR, saying that the animals that are not rabid or aggressive will not be shifted to shelters but instead sterilised, immunised, and released back to their original locations.The court said that the ""direction given in the order dated 11th August, 2025, prohibiting the release of the treated and vaccinated dogs seems to be too harsh.""It referenced Rule 11(9) of the ABC Rules, which mandates that once stray dogs have been sterilised, inoculated, and dewormed, they must be released back into the same locality from which they were picked up.A three-judge bench comprising Justice Vikram Nath, Justice Sandeep Mehta, and Justice NV Anjaria clarified that stray dogs must be released to their original areas after sterilisation, deworming, and immunisation, except for those infected with rabies, suspected of rabies infection, or exhibiting aggressive behaviour.Here are top quotes:The court also ordered a ban on public feeding of stray dogs and directed the establishment of dedicated feeding spaces. The Bench reiterated the August 11 order that no individual or organisation should obstruct municipal authorities from picking up dogs in accordance with the ABC Rules.The scope of the matter was extended beyond Delhi-NCR to a pan-India level, involving all States and Union Territories, Secretaries of Animal Husbandry departments, Secretaries of local bodies, and Municipal corporations for compliance with ABC Rules. The court also stated that it would transfer similar petitions pending in high courts to itself to formulate a national policy on the issue.The Supreme Court has supplemented and modified earlier directions on stray dog management, laying down fresh guidelines for municipal bodies:","The court also ordered a ban on public feeding of stray dogs and directed the establishment of dedicated feeding spaces.

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday expressed surprise at the lack of political parties’ involvement in correcting names of voters deleted during the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls in Bihar. The top court also said that claim forms can be submitted along with Aadhaar card or any other 11 acceptable documents.""We will allow online submission of claims of deleted voters with Aadhaar card or any other acceptable documents for Bihar SIR,"" the bench said, as quoted by PTI.""All the political parties shall file the status report by the next date of hearing on the claim form they had facilitated in filing by excluded voters,"" the bench added.The matter has been posted for hearing on September 8.During the hearing, the Election Commission informed the court that while 85,000 new voters had been added in the ongoing revision, only two objections had been filed by booth-level agents of political parties.A bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi resumed hearing a batch of petitions challenging the SIR exercise. The petitions were filed by RJD MP Manoj Jha, the Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR), PUCL, activist Yogendra Yadav, Trinamool Congress MP Mahua Moitra and former Bihar MLA Mujahid Alam.The petitioners have sought to quash the ECI’s June 24 directive, which requires large numbers of voters in Bihar to submit proof of citizenship to stay on the rolls.On August 14, Election Commission uploaded details of 65 lakh deleted voters from Bihar’s draft electoral rolls on district magistrates’ websites, following a Supreme Court order.Chief election commissioner Gyanesh Kumar said the move was made “within 56 hours of the top court directive” to ensure transparency. He explained that Electoral Registration Officers and Booth Level Officers bear responsibility for the accuracy of rolls, which are shared digitally and physically with parties and the public. Draft rolls in Bihar, published on August 1, remain open for claims and objections until September 1.Defending the exercise, Kumar said it was a “matter of grave concern” that some parties were spreading “misinformation”, stressing that India’s election system is a “multi-layered, decentralised construct as envisaged by law.”During the previous hearing, the Supreme Court said it could set aside the results of the special intensive revision if illegality was proven.Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, for RJD MP Manoj Jha, argued the exclusion of 65 lakh voters was unlawful, while Prashant Bhushan accused the EC of making the rolls non-searchable. The court countered claims about lack of documents, saying “everybody possesses some certificate.” The hearing will continue, with the final rolls due on September 30.",The supreme court expressed surprise at the lack of political parties' involvement in correcting names of voters deleted during the special intensive revision (sir) of electoral rolls in bihar.

"'TMC jaabe, poribortan hobe': In Kolkata, PM Modi's big charge and a promise - top quotes",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tmc-jaabe-hobe-poribortan-in-kolkata-pm-modis-big-charge-and-a-promise-top-quotes/articleshow/123456096.cms,"Here

are the top quotes from PM Modi's speech

I have arrived in Kolkata at a time when preparations for Durga Puja have begun. Kolkata is being adorned with new colours and fresh vibrancy. When the festival of faith and joy is combined with the festival of development, the happiness doubles. Just a short distance from here, I had the opportunity to lay the foundation stone and inaugurate major projects related to the Kolkata Metro and highways.

West Bengal is one of the largest states in the country in terms of population. Therefore, until the strength of West Bengal is enhanced, the journey towards a developed India cannot succeed. Because the BJP believes, the BJP's conviction is - only when Bengal rises will a developed India be formed.

Over the past 11 years, the BJP government at the Centre has consistently provided every kind of support for the development of West Bengal. The amount of money that the Congress-led UPA government provided in its 10 years for the construction of National Highways in Bengal, our Indian government has given Bengal more than three times that amount. The budget for railways in Bengal has also been increased threefold compared to before.

However, there is a significant challenge facing development work in Bengal. The challenge is that most of the money we send directly to the state government for Bengal... is looted here. That money is spent on TMC cadres. As a result, Bengal lags behind other states in the country in many schemes for the welfare of the poor.

A few years ago, the situation in the neighbouring states of Assam and Tripura was much the same. But ever since the BJP government came to power in Assam and Tripura, the benefits of welfare schemes for the poor have started reaching the people there. Today, the work of providing water to every household in these states is progressing rapidly. Under the Ayushman scheme, free treatment up to 5 lakh rupees is being provided to every poor person. Permanent houses are being built for the poor.

As long as the TMC government remains in Bengal... the development of Bengal will remain obstructed, stalled. That’s why today, every person in Bengal is saying... only when TMC goes will real change come.

The BJP fulfills every resolution it makes. We have recently witnessed proof of this during Operation Sindoor. Our army turned the hideouts of terrorists and their masters across the border into ruins. Our forces taught the terrorists such a lesson that Pakistan is still reeling from it.

Those who have come here to snatch the livelihoods of our people, who have stayed by forging documents... they will have to leave. And for this task to be completed honestly... the TMC government will also have to leave from here.

West Bengal is a border state. The way the demography is being altered in border areas is also creating a social crisis in West Bengal. In particular, farmers are being deceived and their land is being seized, and tribals are being misled to take over their land. The country cannot tolerate this; it must be stopped. Therefore, this time from the Red Fort, I have announced a special demography mission against infiltration.

The BJP believes that until West Bengal develops, the 'yatra' of 'Viksit Bharat' will not be successful...In the past 11 years, the central government has extended every possible help for the development of West Bengal...The money that the central government sends for the development of the state is being looted and is spent on the TMC cadre.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday launched a full-blown attack against West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee and pledged a ""poribortan"" from the Trinamool Congress government.While addressing a rally in Kolkata, the prime minister accused the West Bengal government of diverting money sent by the Centre towards TMC cadres.","Prime minister narendra modi spoke at a rally in kolkata on friday.

NEW DELHI: If the Congress-led India bloc's Vice President candidate, B Sudershan Reddy, had not delivered the Salwa Judum judgment, the extremist Left movement in the country would have ended before 2020, Union home minister and senior BJP leader Amit Shah on Friday accused his of ""supporting"" Naxalism.Speaking after inaugurating the Manorama News conclave organised by the Malayala Manorama group in Delhi, Shah remarked that the Congress party’s chances of winning in Kerala had further diminished due to its choice of candidate for the Vice-President post.""Sudershan Reddy is the person who helped Naxalism. He gave Salwa Judum judgment. If the Salwa Judum judgment had not been given, the Naxal terrorism would have ended by 2020. He is the person who was inspired by the ideology that gave Salwa Judum judgment,"" PTI quoted Shah said during a question-and-answer session at the conclave.The statement refers to the December 2011 Supreme Court judgment by Justice Reddy, which ruled that using tribal youths as Special Police Officers—whether called 'Koya Commandos', Salwa Judum, or by any other name—in the fight against Maoist insurgents was illegal and unconstitutional, ordering their immediate disarmament.Shah added that Kerala had borne the brunt of Naxalism.""People of Kerala will certainly see that the Congress party, under the pressure of Left parties, is fielding a candidate who supported Naxalism and used a pious forum like the Supreme Court,"" he asserted.The ruling NDA had selected Maharashtra Governor C P Radhakrishnan, a seasoned BJP leader from Tamil Nadu with an RSS background, as its vice-presidential candidate.In 2011, Reddy gave a landmark judgment which declared the controversial Salwa Judum militia in Chhattisgarh as unconstitutional.The Salwa Judum, which was accused of human rights abuses, was a state-sponsored militia raised in 2005 to counter Maoist insurgency. It comprised largely tribal youth armed with basic training and firearms.The militia was later disbanded. His ruling, rooted in the protection of fundamental rights, underscored that state-sponsored vigilantism could not replace constitutional policing. In Nandini Sundar versus state of Chhattisgarh, the bench led by Justice Reddy held that arming tribal youth as special police officers under Salwa Judum was illegal and unconstitutional.","Bjp leader amit shah accuses congress-led india bloc's vice president candidate, b sudershan reddy, of ""supporting"" naxalism.

NEW DELHI: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Friday mounted a scathing attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP-led NDA government, accusing them of attempting 'vote theft' in Bihar and betraying the country’s youth with policies that 'destroy employment opportunities.'""The entire country now knows that Narendra Modi steals votes,"" Gandhi alleged.Addressing a massive public rally in Bhagalpur during the ongoing ‘Voter Adhikar Yatra’, Gandhi alleged that the Modi government and the Election Commission were working together to snatch away citizens’ constitutional right to vote.“The SIR is an attempt by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the BJP and the EC to steal your votes. They are trying their best to snatch your voting rights. The ‘vote chor’ came to Gayaji, but he did not say even a word on his government's attempt to steal votes with the help of the EC,” Gandhi said.He alleged that though PM Modi visited Bihar earlier in the day, he remained silent on alleged irregularities in the Maharashtra and Karnataka elections as well as the crisis in Manipur.He attacked Modi for maintaining “silence” on irregularities in elections.“The SIR is an attempt by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the BJP and the EC to steal your votes.They are trying their best to snatch your voting rights. The ‘vote chor’ came to Gayaji, but he did not say even a word on his government's attempt to steal votes with the help of the EC,” the Congress leader said.Invoking the Constitution, Gandhi said all citizens are equal and every person has one vote, but alleged that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Election Commission are attacking it by canceling votes. He cited the case of a voter who told him his vote was canceled by the EC after he had voted for Congress in the Lok Sabha elections.""Constitution guarantees equal rights to everyone; but PM and EC are snatching people's right to vote,"" he alleged.The leader of opposition also accused the Modi government of pushing the youth into despair. “Young people study for months to get a job, then take exams. But... on the day of the exam, the paper gets leaked. The situation is such that the youth cannot find employment in this state”.Lashing out at the Agniveer scheme, Gandhi said the government had ended secure jobs in the armed forces. “Earlier, millions of our youth used to join the army. They protected the country, received pensions, and were taken care of. Today, an Agniveer has lost his hand, but no help is being provided to him. He has been removed from his job and sent back home.”Gandhi also recalled demonetisation, GST and the now-repealed farm laws, alleging that every measure of this government is anti-poor.During the rally, Gandhi said that even attempts to suppress the yatra by cutting electricity would fail. ""Here, they have cut off the electricity, thinking that cutting the power will silence the voice, but the voice does not stop in the darkness; it is heard.” he remarked.The Bhagalpur event marked the sixth day of the 1,300-km, 16-day yatra launched on August 17, which will pass through more than 20 districts of Bihar before concluding with a rally at Patna’s Gandhi Maidan on September 1.Congress leaders from Karnataka will also be joining the yatra.

Article 311(2)(c) of the Constitution was invoked to terminate their services after investigations by security and intelligence agencies established their involvement, PTI quoted officials saying.Both are currently lodged in the Kupwara district jail. According to officials, Rather is accused of working as an overground worker (OGW) for Lashkar-e-Taiba . A probe revealed that Rather, who was appointed under the Rehbar-e-Taleem scheme in 2003 and confirmed in 2008, allegedly procured and distributed arms and narcotics for Pakistan-based handlers. He was arrested earlier this year after arms were seized in Kupwara.He was tasked by Pakistan-based handlers to procure and distribute arms, ammunition and narcotics among active terrorists in the Valley.He reportedly received several consignments through the LoC in Karnah. The weapons were supplied to terrorists, while proceeds from narcotics sales were used to fund operations, officials said.His role surfaced after intelligence inputs on January 25-2024 indicated that two Pakistani terrorists, with the help of four associates, including Rather, were smuggling arms in Kupwara. Khan, appointed in 2004, was caught with an AK-47 and is accused of sheltering and infiltrating terrorists and smuggling arms.Investigators revealed that he was in touch with a Pakistan-based handler, who used him for smuggling arms and narcotics across the LoC for further distribution to active LeT terrorists. Officials described their actions as ""betrayal of national trust"", underscoring the administration's zero-tolerance policy against terror support networks within government ranks.They said the Lieutenant Governor was satisfied after considering the facts and circumstances of the cases and noted that, on the basis of the information available, the activities of the two are such as to warrant their dismissal from service.

The investigators found Khurshid had received several consignments containing weapons and narcotics sent across the LoC into Karnah, Kupwara.""Khurshid's role was exposed after the law enforcement agencies received an input on Jan 25, 2024 that two Pakistani terrorists were involved in smuggling of arms with the help of four associates in Kupwara - Khurshid himself, Zahoor Ahmed, Ghulam Sarwar and Qazi Fazal.An FIR was registered and Zahoor Ahmed picked for interrogation. Zahoor spilled the beans on his network and his associates, leading to the arrest of Khurshid and his aides. Sustained interrogation of Khurshid and his associates led to the recovery of a huge cache of arms and ammunition. Siyad was appointed as an assistant stockman in the sheep husbandry department in 2004. He started working for LeT and was tasked to receive infiltrating groups of terrorists, shelter them and transport their arms and ammunition.According to investigators, Siyad also started smuggling narcotics to sustain terror activities. ""He was intercepted and arrested on Jan 12, 2024 at Peer Baba Shrine, Keran, Kupwara... An AK-47 was recovered from his possession,"" a J&K police source told TOI.

Gujarat's pride to remain MP's envy? Plan to bring lions to Kuno likely shelved,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/gujarats-pride-to-remain-mps-envy-plan-to-bring-lions-to-kuno-likely-shelved/articleshow/123462376.cms,"Rumble in the jungle

A three-decade wait

Cheetahs take centre stage

BHOPAL: Has the curtain finally and quietly come down on a three-decade saga - the elusive plan to bring Asiatic lions from Gujarat's Gir sanctuary to Kuno in Sheopur district of Madhya Pradesh? Likely. Lions may sit at the top of the food chain, but the rumble in the jungle suggests cheetahs have outmanoeuvred them in the Kuno conservation stakes.A July 30 forest department notification announcing renaming of the 'Lion Project' in MP's Kuno National Park to 'Cheetah Project', and redesignation of its director to ""field director, Cheetah Project, Shivpuri"", has led many to suspect that Asiatic lions won't roar in what was supposed to be their second home in India after Gir.However, while Kuno effectively becomes the preserve of the ambitious cheetah reintroduction programme launched by PM Narendra Modi in 2022, official word on it is that the Lion Project hasn't been scrapped.""This is procedural restructuring. No post has been abolished. Positions have been renamed for better conservation targeting,"" additional chief secretary (forest) Ashok Barnwal told TOI.Another senior official who didn't want to be named said this had been done to ""ease international communication"" since Kuno was now globally identified with Project Cheetah.The idea of creating a home for the Asiatic lion beyond Gujarat dates back to the 1980s, when wildlife scientists warned that Gir alone couldn't safeguard the species. Field studies by the Dehradun-based Wildlife Institute of India over a decade had identified Kuno as the most suitable site for relocation of lions.The Asiatic Lion Reintroduction Project was then formally launched after the Supreme Court directed Gujarat in April 2013 to give away some Gir lions. The court specifically asked the Centre to establish Kuno as the endangered Asiatic lion's other home in India.Successive state govts in Gujarat refused to allow lions to be relocated from Gir, insisting that they were safe in their original habitat and alleging that Kuno's topography wasn't conducive to their survival. Officials in Gujarat described Gir lions as the state's ""pride"" and filed review and curative petitions, both of which were dismissed by the apex court.The reluctance, couched in ecological concerns, was widely seen as a mix of politics and prestige. The Centre maintained a stoic silence, and the project remained trapped in a maze of bureaucratic files, expert committee recommendations, and reports of periodic field visits.Since the first batch of African cheetahs landed in Kuno from Namibia and South Africa in Sept 2022, the only mention of the pending plan to relocate lions to Gir was in a state govt audit last year.""Cheetahs were not part of the Kuno management plan,"" states the audit report, also flagging alleged violations and incomplete documentation of Project Cheetah expenditure.According to the official management plan for the period 2020-21 to 2029-30, Kuno was to be designated a secondary habitat for Asiatic lions. ""No efforts had been made towards reintroduction of lions, as of Nov 2023,"" the audit report says.The audit also talks about missing reports from a three-member team appointed by SC on Jan 28, 2020. The team was required to submit four-monthly surveys and recommendations on sites for African cheetahs.""These reports were not found in the forest division's records, preventing verification of the facts presented to the Supreme Court,"" the report states.",The idea of creating a home for the asiatic lion beyond gujarat dates back to the 1980s.

NEW DELHI: After the united outrage by opposition against the Constitution amendment bill that provides for automatic sacking of ministers and CMs jailed for 30 days, INDIA bloc is forced to wait to nominate MPs to the parliamentary panel to scrutinise the legislation in view of Trinamool Congress 's reluctance to join it.Sources said TMC was pushing for boycott of the JPC, but the rest of the opposition wanted to be on the panel to ensure that Modi government did not get a free run on ""the weapon to target the opposition-ruled states"".Congress, which is sure to get 4-5 seats on the panel, and allies are waiting for TMC to convey a final decision, sources said, adding that DMK and SP, too, have conveyed their willingness.The issue flared up at an INDIA bloc meeting Wednesday, when the three bills tabled by home minister Amit Shah triggered a fracas in Lok Sabha. A senior TMC neta advocated that the opposition should stay away from the JPC. But the argument was countered by a smaller party member who said that JPC was the only platform where the opposition could make an alternative case and even register dissent. The Trinamool member underlined that govt ultimately has its way, like in the JPC on Waqf bill. However, in response, it was pointed out that the JPC proceedings served a big purpose as Supreme Court mentioned them in its hearings on the challenge to the Waqf (Amendment) Act.While the opposition managed to stay united in the monsoon session, the three bills presented on the penultimate day created some fissures. INDIA decided to join the discussion at the ""introduction stage"" to oppose its tabling by painting it as a BJP weapon against rivals, but TMC said upfront that it was under directions to protest from the word go.","India bloc is forced to wait to nominate mps to the parliamentary panel to scrutinise the legislation.

Intermittent fasting may come with risks: Study,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/intermittent-fasting-may-come-with-risks-study/articleshow/123462333.cms,"Getty images

New Delhi: Intermittent fasting may help shed some extra kilos in the short term, but such regimens may not be without their risks, a new study, published in Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome: Clinical Research and Reviews, has suggested.Intermittent fasting involves limiting the hours for eating to a specific number of hours each day, which may range from a 4- to 12-hour time window in 24 hours.In the study, researchers who analysed long-term health outcomes for close to 19,000 US nationals with varying daily eating durations found that participants who ate for less than eight hours per day had a 135% higher risk of cardiovascular mortality (death due to heart and blood vessel diseases) compared to those with a typical 12-14-hour eating period.Further research is required to understand whether the risk of cardiovascular mortality is attributable to the short eating duration itself or residual confounding resulting from its contributing factors, the study says.Dr Anoop Misra, chairman Fortis C-doc and the editorial head of Diabetes and Metabolic Syndrome: Clinical Research and Reviews journal, said people who follow intermittent fasting tend to eat whatever they want in the non-fasting period, including junk food.""Some studies have shown increased low-density cholesterol (LDL) in such cases is a known risk factor for cardiovascular mortality,"" he said.The enthusiasm for intermittent fasting must be tempered with careful risk assessment. ""Until more long-term data are available, especially on hard outcomes like cardiovascular events (e.g. heart attacks), intermittent fasting should be individualised and ideally supervised, particularly for people with pre-existing health conditions, and applied for short term only,"" the doctor said.Nutritionists say extreme dieting can lead to long-term nutritional deficiencies, including proteins, vitamins, minerals & electrolytes. ""In some cases, sudden death due to arrhythmias (irregular heartbeat) and chronic inflammation are also possible. Magnesium deficiency can lead to serious cardiac events,"" Dr Ishi Khosla, a clinical nutritionist, said.","Intermittent fasting involves limiting the hours for eating to a specific number of hours each day.

KOLKATA: In another life, Sunali Khatun could have been a version of Manto's Toba Tek Singh, a man with no country to call his own. Pushed into Bangladesh by police in India who labelled her an illegal immigrant, police in Bangladesh have now done the same thing to her - called her an illegal immigrant and jailed her. She is eight months pregnant.Birbhum resident Sunali, expecting a child any time now, was escorted into a Bangladesh jail on Friday not knowing to which country her unborn baby would belong.The 26-year-old's Aadhaar and voter identity card hadn't saved her from being branded an ""illegal immigrant"" in Delhi, where she was working until recently. On Thursday, cops in Chapai Nawabganj arrested her based on those very identity documents.Sunali, her ragpicker husband Danish Sheikh and the couple's toddler son Sabir are now among six ""nowhere people"" with roots in West Bengal but disowned by their country and incarcerated in Bangladesh. The others are Sweety Biwi and her sons Qurban Sheikh (16) and Imam Dewan (6).The befuddled bunch had been living and working in Delhi's Rohini - earning just enough to keep afloat - when they were arrested during an ""identity verification drive"" and sent to Bangladesh through Assam on June 26.""The group of six was arrested after they were found loitering in Chapai Nawabganj. They told us they were Indians who entered Bangladesh through the Kurigram border (in Assam), roamed the streets of Dhaka for some days, and then reached here. They didn't have a lawyer during Friday's court hearing,"" Chapai Nawabganj police superintendent Md Rezaul Karim told TOI on Friday.Unless someone takes up cudgels for them, Sunali, her family and the rest of the group will remain in prison till the next hearing scheduled in September. Karim said all six had been charged under the Control of Entry Act, 1952.Sunali's father Bhodu Sk, who has filed a habeas corpus in Calcutta high court, said it was shocking to even think that his heavily pregnant daughter might give birth in jail. ""We are poor. We have moved the high court, what else can be done?"" he said.Arif Sk, a neighbour of the family in Bengal's Birbhum, said everyone has pooled in to try and arrange a lawyer in Bangladesh to bail out the group from their village.Bhodu and co-petitioner Amir Khan, who is Sweety Khatun's cousin, said in their petition that what happened was a ""betrayal of law"". The high court is scheduled to hear the case on Sept 10.A PIL has been filed in Supreme Court on the alleged harassment of Bengali-speaking migrants in India, including Sunali's ""illegal deportation"". The PIL has been listed for hearing on Aug 29.Bengal migrant welfare board chairperson and Rajya Sabha MP Samirul Islam said, ""We are making every effort to bring back Sunali and the others. We are also providing the family legal help.""Meanwhile, on Aug 13, 22-year-old Malda migrant labourer Amir Sheikh, who was pushed into Bangladesh on June 25, returned to India, his reappearance as mysterious as his disappearance from the country of his birth. Amir had been stuck in Bangladesh since June 25, prompting his father - Jiyem Sheikh - to file a habeas corpus in the HC. He said Rajasthan Police had arrested him for being a ""Bangladeshi living in India illegally"".BSF told the court a couple of hours after Amir's return through the Basirhat border that he had crossed over to Bangladesh ""inadvertently"".","Sunali khatun, 26, was arrested in chapai nawabganj, bangladesh, on thursday.

NEW DELHI: A parliamentary panel on fertiliser, in its report on disinvestment of fertiliser PSUs, has found the finance ministry's decision to classify the sector as “non-strategic” as “incongruent” with the government’s agenda to be self-reliance (Atma Nirbhar).The panel headed by Congress MP Kirti Azad in its report submitted to Parliament this week has mentioned that despite multiple submissions by the fertiliser department to the finance ministry to classify the sector as strategic considering its critical role in ensuring food security, sustaining rural livelihoods, and advancing national self-reliance, the latter did not accept this.The report mentioned that disinvestment department (DIPAM) turned down these requests, arguing that Central Public Sector Enterprises (CPSEs) contribute only 25% and 11% of the country’s urea and non-urea fertiliser production respectively; that many operate at a loss; and that their continued existence is inconsistent with fiscal prudence and the criteria for strategic classification, as approved by the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) under the New PSE Policy.“The committee finds this reasoning incongruent with the govt’s Atmanirbhar Bharat agenda. Contrary to DIPAM’s claim, several fertiliser PSUs have shown remarkable turnaround, notably FACT, which has transitioned from a loss-making entity to a consistently profitable enterprise,” the report said. It also highlighted that the revival of closed units at Gorakhpur, Sindri, Barauni and Ramagundam through CPSE-led joint ventures, has added over 76.2 lakh tonnes to India’s annual urea production capacity.The panel said that this clearly demonstrates the strategic value of leveraging PSU assets to meet national goals. “In light of rising global fertiliser prices and India’s continued reliance on imports for over 90% of its potash and phosphate needs (procured under the Open General License), the sustained operation and strengthening of fertilizer PSUs is crucial not only for domestic production but also for price stabilisation, disaster resilience, and long term food sovereignty,” it said.Under the framework of the new public sector enterprise policy for Atmanirbhar Bharat in 2021, fertiliser sector was categorised as a non-strategic sector, making it eligible for privatisation or closure. But there has been no progress so far as disinvestments of seven PSUs manufacturing fertilisers is concerned.As per fertiliser department, in FY25, out of the total 38.8 million tonne (MT) of urea consumption, 5.6 MT was met through imports. In case of non-urea fertilisers such as diammonium phosphate (DAP), NPK (nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium) and muriate of potash (MOP DAP), imports were 10.4 MT against the consumption of 21.1 MT.According to the committee, the country's dependency on import at present is to the extent of 25% of the requirement of urea, 90% in case of phosphates - as raw material or finished fertilizers and 100% in case of potash.It has recommended that there is a strong need to ensure that the existing fertiliser manufacturing units function profitably. It has also stressed on the need to revive the closed units so as to bridge the gap between the demand and availability of fertilisers in the country.","A parliamentary panel on fertiliser has found the finance ministry's decision to classify the sector as ‘non-strategic’ as “incongruent’ with the government’s agenda to be self-reliance (atma nirbhar) the panel headed by congress mp kirti azad in its report submitted to parliament this week has mentioned that despite multiple submissions by the fertiliser department, the ministry did not accept this.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123462296,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1303592,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
