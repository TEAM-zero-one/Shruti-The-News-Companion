Kural 68

It is a matter of joy for the entire humanity to find oneself outdone in

Intelligence by one’s children.

I was part of that journey.

Kural

A casual visit to a friend’s home can sometimes offer more than hospitality. On a recent work trip, an evening spent with an old colleague and his family brought unexpected joy. Laughter echoed through their home, the dining table buzzed with conversation, and the energy of their two young daughters brought the household alive with their constant chorus of “Amma, where’s my clip?” or “Can we please order dessert? I’ve stopped coughing!” Their world revolved around each other and was filled with warmth and unfiltered affection.After I returned to my hotel, I felt a whisper of sorrow in my heart—not for what was missing, but for what had quietly faded. At one point in my life, my home too was filled with endless demands from my daughters. And then things slowly quietened. I can’t remember when I stopped plaiting their hair or when it changed from: “Can I please go?” to “I will be late today”.Many parents will identify with this feeling. The realization doesn’t come as a blow, but as a slow unveiling; one day they reach for your hand, and the next, they gently let go. Not out of rejection, but out of readiness.This shift is not failure. It is fulfilment. But it still aches.We often speak of parenting as a journey of nurturing, protecting, and teaching. Rarely do we prepare ourselves for its most spiritual act: stepping back. The early years are intense. And then, slowly, the distance grows. The bond remains, but its texture changes. Less visible, more inward.There is deep emotional fatigue in parenting—not just from the effort of raising children, but from accepting that the most beautiful chapters are often fleeting. The days of packing lunch boxes, helping with homework, and being the axis on which your child ’s world revolves, pass quietly.In such times, it helps to look for wisdom beyond our own. Kahlil Gibran writes:But long before Gibran,offered clarity on this inThis is not just a compliment to a child’s intelligence—it is a directive to the parent to release the old model of authority and pride, and cultivate humility and joy in witnessing growth that surpasses our own. It invites us to evolve from participants to spectators, from teachers to admirers. When a child becomes wiser, more capable, more independent—that is not an ending, but an apex.The mountain raises the river in its lap, lets it gather force, and watches it surge ahead, cutting valleys and nourishing lands it will never see. The mountain does not mourn. It stands tall, steady in its knowing:That is how humanity moves forward. What remains with us is not the noise of their childhood, but its echo. A soft, lingering hum that stays long after the room has fallen silent.Thereminds us that parenting is not possession—it is a privilege. One that asks us not just to shape lives, but to celebrate when those lives begin shaping themselves.","Thirukkural with the times explores real-world lessons from the classic tamil text.

Alarm ringing in Himalayas: Environment minister Bhupender Yadav,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/alarm-ringing-in-himalayas-environment-minister-bhupender-yadav/articleshow/121222005.cms,"Bhupender Yadav (File photo)

‘Need regional synergy to protect fragile ecosystems’

(With agency inputs)

DEHRADUN: Union environment minister Bhupender Yadav flagged the growing ecological vulnerability of the Himalayas, which is marked by accelerated glacier melt, while addressing ‘ Sagarmatha Sambaad ’ — a global dialogue on climate change and its impact on mountainous regions — in Kathmandu on Friday.“The science is clear. The Himalayas are sounding the alarm,” Yadav said, warning that climate change is hastening glacier retreat and endangering water security for downstream populations.Union environment minister Bhupender Yadav added that the Himalayan communities are under threat despite contributing little to the climate crisis, and called for regional cooperation to share knowledge and protect these fragile ecosystems.The Union minister’s call for action comes on the heels of a study published in ‘Journal of Glaciology’ by Cambridge University Press which revealed a troubling trend at Himachal Pradesh’s Gepang Gath glacier: rapid glacial retreat coupled with the dramatic expansion of its proglacial lake — a water body that forms at the front or side of a glacier and is typically dammed by moraine, glacial ice, or debris. Over the past six decades, this lake has grown nearly sixfold, from 0.2 sq km in 1962 to 1.2 sq km in 2023.Led by scientists from National Centre for Polar and Ocean Research under ministry of earth sciences, the study links this expansion directly to the glacier’s retreat, further accelerated by calving (the breaking off of ice chunks from the glacier’s terminus). Between 2014 and 2023, Gepang Gath retreated 480m, resulting in substantial surface area loss and volume loss (21.7 million cubic metres of ice). The glacier’s mass balance has shown a consistently negative trend, indicating it is losing more mass than it gains.The study highlights a dangerous feedback loop: as the lake grows, its relatively warm water accelerates melting at the glacier’s edge, triggering further calving.To prevent disasters, the study calls for urgent measures, including the establishment of early warning systems for the proglacial lake and enhanced monitoring of glacier-lake dynamics.",Union environment minister bhupender yadav flagged the growing ecological vulnerability of the himalayas. Yadav warned that climate change is hastening glacier retreat and endangering water security for downstream populations.

Operation Sindoor: BJP defends MP deputy CM as a row erupts over his remarks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/operation-sindoor-bjp-defends-mp-deputy-cm-as-a-row-erupts-over-his-remarks/articleshow/121221667.cms,"MP deputy CM Jagdish Devda

Sack Devda & Vijay Shah, demands Congress

BHOPAL: Even as BJP is battling the crisis triggered by Madhya Pradesh minister Vijay Shah’s comments on Colonel Sofiya Qureshi, a fresh controversy erupted Friday over a statement by deputy CM Jagdish Devda.Thanking PM Narendra Modi while lauding the military’s courage in Op Sindoor, Devda said at a training programme for civil defence volunteers in Jabalpur Friday: “Yashaswi Pradhan Mantriji ko hum dhanyawad dena chahenge. Aur poora desh, desh ki woh sena, woh sainik, unke charno mein natmastak hain. Unke charno mein poora desh natmastak hain. Unhone jo jawab diya hai, uski jitni sarahna ki jaye, jitni kaha jaye utna kam hai.” The dispute is over Devda using the words ‘unke charno mein’. While Congress claimed Devda meant the ‘PM’s feet’, BJP said he meant the Army’s feet.BJP, which is on a defensive after Shah’s remark, stoutly defended Devda, with IT cell chief Amit Malviya alleging that Congress is targeting the deputy CM because he is a Dalit. “Congress is unable to accept that a Dalit leader holds such a prominent position,” he said.“Deliberately distorting Devda ji’s statement is an attempt to create sensation and an atmosphere of lies,” Malviya tweeted. Devda warned of legal action, saying: “My speech is being presented in a wrong and distorted manner, which is absolutely improper. I said that the courage shown by the Army in conducting Operation Sindoor against terrorists cannot be praised enough. The entire country and the people of the country bow at their feet and salute them. I too salute them.” Devda defended himself by saying: “What I meant was people of the country salute brave soldiers of the Army. My statement is being circulated in the wrong manner. I have not given any such statement for which an apology is required nor have I hurt anyone’s feelings.”Slamming MP deputy CM Jagdish Devda for allegedly saying that defence forces and its soldiers are at PM Modi’s feet and state minister Vijay Shah for his comments about Colonel Qureshi, Congress Friday said the BJP netas should be sacked from state govt without delay, else their utterances would be seen as having the approval of Modi and the BJP brass.Congress spokesperson Supriya Shrinate said comments from BJP politicians are tantamount to sedition but BJP is going all out to protect them, and the MP CM has already ruled out action against Shah. She asked how could Devda say “defence forces are at the PM’s feet” when they are responsible for maintaining peace, and when the country is full of respect for the way they stunned Pakistan in the recent face-off.“These words are like committing a sin and BJP is doing it time and again,” Shrinate told reporters. “An apology or regret will not work this time. Devda has to be sacked. BJP cannot be a bystander this time.”","Mp deputy cm jagdish devda slammed by congress for allegedly saying that defence forces and its soldiers are at pm modi’s feet.

NEW DELHI: The Congress is once again under BJP fire. And once again, the ammunition for this all-out attack has been provided by a party leader. P Chidambaram 's reality check on the future of INDIA bloc has left the Congress scurrying for cover.""The future (of INDIA bloc) is not so bright, as Mritunjay Singh Yadav said. He seems to feel that the alliance is still intact, but I am not sure. It is only Salman (Khurshid) who can answer because he was part of the negotiating team for the INDIA bloc. If the alliance is totally intact, I will be very happy. But it shows at the seams that it is frayed,"" Chidambaram said at a book launch in the national capital on Thursday.He also hoped that the alliance can ""still be put together, there's still time"".The BJP, as expected, latched on to Chidambaram's remarks and unleashed a fierce offensive against the Congress. And why not? After all, the leadership of opposition's INDIA bloc is with the grand-old-party and Mallikarjun Kharge is its chairperson. So, Chidambaram's assessment points to failure of the Congress leadership to lead the opposition coalition effectively.Ironically, his remarks come at a time when the Congress was already struggling over statements made by Shashi Tharoor in support of PM Modi's policies during the India-Pakistan standoff. Several BJP leaders cited Tharoor's remarks praising several government's policies, including the ceasefire decision, to slam and school the Congress leadership.It was only yesterday that Congress leader Jairam Ramesh officially announced that Tharoor's remarks were his personal views. ""When Mr. Tharoor speaks, it is his view and it is not the stand of the party,"" Jairam Ramesh had said yesterday. Some reports citing Congress sources had suggested that the party had expressed displeasure with Tharoor's statements and was of the view that the Thiruvananthapuram MP had crossed the Lakshman Rekha this time around. However, Tharoor had dismissed these reports and called them ""media creation without any evidence.""Chidambaram's statement coming in this backdrop put the party once again on the backfoot.Citing Chidambaram's reality check, the BJP and its allies have been relentless in targeting the Congress and the INDIA bloc calling it a ""greed-driven coalition"", ""Maha-thagbandhan"", ""opportunistic alliance"", ""kushti-dosti model"", ""company of looters"", ""group of corrupt leaders"", ""ghamandiya alliance"". Some even raised questions on Congress's leadership role and claimed that the grand-old-party is fading and has no future.INDIA bloc, which was launched with a lot of fanfare, is actually gasping for breath today and to that extent Chidambaram is spot on in his assessment. But to announce that from a public platform definetely helps party's political rivals - the BJP in this case.It will be interesting to see how the Congress reacts to this new challenge. Party leader Udit Raj, who had slammed Tharoor for 'becoming BJP's spokesperson', had a word of advice for Chidambaram. ""Party has given him a lot. He and his son are MPs. Since the party is not in power, Chidambaram ji should go around the country and conduct a dialogue,"" he said.Tharoor has been at loggerheads with the party for some time now, but Chidambaram's remarks may have come as a surprise. Interestingly, last week when BJP national general secretary Radha Mohan Das Agrawal had slammed the Congress over demand to sack Madhya Pradesh minister Vijay Shah for his controversial statement on Col Sofia Qureshi, he had cited both Tharoor and Chidambaram to prove his point.""If people start giving resignation for statements, then no one would be left in the Congress except for P Chidambaram and Shashi Tharoor. We should first demand Rahul Gandhi's resignation,"" the BJP general secretary had said. The fact that both these leaders have put Congress in a spot of bother may be a matter of coincidence. Perhaps.",Congress leader p chidambaram says the future of india bloc is not so bright. Bjp has latched on to the remarks and unleashed a fierce offensive against the congress.

Celebi moves Delhi HC against revocation of security clearance,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/celebi-moves-delhi-hc-against-revocation-of-security-clearance/articleshow/121220617.cms,"File photo

NEW DELHI: Turkish-origin firm Celebi Airport Services India , which handled ground handling operations at various airports in India, including in the capital, approached the Delhi high court on Friday challenging the decision of aviation watchdog BCAS to revoke its security clearance in the “interest of national security”.The plea questions the move to act against the firm on “vague” national security concerns , a decision taken by govt days after Türkiye backed Pakistan and condemned India's strikes on terror camps in the neighbouring country. It is likely to be taken up for hearing next week. Celebi, operating in the Indian aviation sector for over 15 years and employing over 10,000 people, offers its services at nine airports.According to sources, it argued that the Indian govt’s decision to revoke its security clearance, which provides airport ground handling services across India, will jeopardise thousands of jobs and threaten investor confidence.Celebi maintains that its operations in India are independent and professionally governed, distancing itself from any political affiliations. It is likely to seek an urgent stay, arguing that mere rhetoric of national security can’t be a ground to take such action as govt’s move fails to reveal grounds or reasons why such an action is called for and gives no justification.Following the revocation of Celebi NAS Airport Services’ security clearance, Union civil aviation minister Ram Mohan Naidu assured that efforts are underway to retain employees. A press release from the civil aviation ministry stated that BCAS revoked Celebi's security clearance on grounds related to national security. Govt reaffirmed its commitment to national security, passenger convenience, and uninterrupted cargo operations while managing the fallout from the decision.The firm handles around 58,000 flights and 540,000 tonnes of cargo annually in India, according to its website. It is present at Mumbai, Delhi, Cochin, Kannur, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Goa, Ahmedabad, and Chennai airports.In a statement issued earlier, Celebi Aviation India said it remains in full compliance with Indian aviation, national security, and tax regulations, and operates with complete transparency.It rejected all allegations regarding the company's ownership and operations in India and reaffirmed its long-standing commitment to the country's aviation sector.",Celebi airport services india approached the delhi high court on friday challenging the decision of aviation watchdog bcas to revoke its security clearance.

NEW DELHI: Congress veteran P Chidambaram has expressed concern that opposition INDIA bloc was no longer intact while stressing that an alliance was required to take on the ‘formidable’ BJP machinery that “controls from Election Commission to the lowest police station” — echoing concerns among many players in the anti-BJP grouping amid growing dissonance and lack of active coordination.“If INDIA bloc is totally intact, I am very, very happy. But it shows at the seams that it is frayed. It can be put together, there is still time,” Chidambaram said at a function to release a book on 2024 elections , ‘Contesting Democratic Deficit’, by Congress’ Salman Khurshid and Mrityunjay Yadav.A gleeful BJP latched on to the comments to state that successive defeats had left Congress scarred. “Chidambaram used the word ‘formidable’ six times to describe BJP and its election machinery in a speech that lasted less than three minutes. Successive defeats have left Congress scarred, much like Pakistan after its bases were destroyed by the IAF,” BJP’s IT cell head Amit Malviya posted on X.Chidambaram’s remarks struck a chord with many politicians who have raised alarm that INDIA bloc has stopped having meetings and players like NCP of Sharad Pawar are seen to be toying with options outside. But the widespread lament in the bloc may not yield much result as electoral compulsions of partners are, in any case, likely to keep them away for many months. Four key allies — TMC, Congress, AAP and the Left parties — will be taking on each other in West Bengal, Kerala and Punjab in 2025 and 2026, and party leaders are loath to be seen together.That is the reason, sources said, the alliance partners have joined hands for coordination in Parliament but have not held meetings outside in recent months. In the most recent instance, Pawar has expressed disagreement with Congress’s demand for a special session of Parliament to discuss Operation Sindoor. TMC has not supported it either. However, Congress argues that alliances in key states are intact, citing examples of Bihar, Jharkhand, Kerala, UP, J&K, Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra, which retains the INDIA flavour to a large extent.But Chidambaram’s alarm appeared to emphasise that the parties could not just cobble an alliance during LS polls and needed to strengthen it during the interim period. “In my reading of history, there has been no political party that has been so formidably organised as BJP. In every department, it is formidable. It’s not another political party. It’s a machine behind which is another machine. And, the two machines control all of the machinery of India — from ECI to the lowest police station in India. They are able to control and sometimes capture these institutions,” he said. “We are still an electoral democracy. We are not a full-fledged democracy no more, we are an electoral democracy ,” he added.",Congress veteran p chidambaram has expressed concern that opposition india bloc was no longer intact.

NEW DELHI: Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah and former CM Mehbooba Mufti on Friday engaged in war of words over reinstating the Tulbul Navigation Project after the suspension of Indus Waters Treaty The argument started after Abdullah suggested on Thursday a possible resumption of construction at the Tulbul Navigation Barrage on Wullar Lake, considering the suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty. ""The Wular lake in North Kashmir. The civil works you see in the video is the Tulbul Navigation Barrage. It was started in the early 1980s but had to be abandoned under pressure from Pakistan citing the Indus Water Treaty . Now that the IWT has been 'temporarily suspended' I wonder if we will be able to resume the project,"" Abdullah posted on his personal X handle.He indicated that completing the Tulbul project would facilitate Jhelum's use for navigation. ""It will give us the advantage of allowing us to use the Jhelum for navigation. It will also improve the power generation of downstream power projects, especially in winter,"" he elaborated.Taking to X, Mufti shared Abdullah's post and reacted, ""At a time when both nations have just stepped back from the brink of war—with Jammu and Kashmir once again paying the highest price through loss of innocent lives, destruction, and suffering—such provocative statements are deeply irresponsible.""Also read: Water wars? How India is planning to divert water from Indus river system, leave Pakistan high and dry She stressed that J&K residents need tranquillity and constancy, rather than political actions that could heighten tensions. ""Weaponizing water—a source of life—is not only inhumane, but it also threatens to internationalize an issue that must remain strictly bilateral,"" she noted.Replying to Mufti's remarks, Abdullah wrote, ""Actually what is unfortunate is that with your blind lust to try to score cheap publicity points & please some people sitting across the border, you refuse to acknowledge that the IWT has been one of the biggest historic betrayals of the interests of the people of J&K. I have always opposed this treaty & I will continue to do so. Opposing a blatantly unfair treaty is in no way, shape, size or form warmongering, it’s about correcting a historic injustice that denied the people of J&K the right to use our water for ourselves.""Continuing the argument, Mufti replied, ""Time will reveal who seeks to appease whom. However, it’s worth recalling that your esteemed grandfather Sheikh Sahab once advocated for accession to Pakistan for over two decades after losing power. But post being reinstated as Chief Minister he suddenly reversed his stance by aligning with India. In contrast the PDP has consistently upheld its convictions & commitments & unlike your party whose loyalties have shifted dramatically according to political expediency . We don’t need to stoke tensions or adopt warmongering rhetoric to validate our dedication. Our actions speak for themselves.""""Is that really the best you can do? Taking cheap shots at a person you yourself have called Kashmir’s tallest leader. I’ll rise above the gutter you want to take this conversation to by keeping the late Mufti Sahib and “North Pole South Pole” out of this. You keep advocating the interests of anyone you want to & I’ll keep advocating for the interests of the people of J&K to use our own rivers for our own benefit. I’m not going to stop the water, just use more of it for ourselves. Now I think I’ll do some real work & you can keep posting,"" replied Abdullah.Following the Pahalgam terror incident last month, the Centre suspended the Indus Waters Treaty, which previously governed water-sharing between India and Pakistan.","Jammu and kashmir chief minister omar abdullah and former cm mehbooba mufti engaged in war of words.

(it) provides no reasons or justification,"" it added.The government on Thursday had revoked the security clearance of Celebi and its associated companies, citing concerns ""in the interest of national security."" The move directly impacts Celebi's ground handling operations , considered sensitive from a security standpoint, at nine major Indian airports: Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Chennai, Ahmedabad, Goa, Cochin, and Kannur.Celebi Airport Services India Pvt Ltd (CASIPL), along with two other group companies, manages ground handling operations at these locations.“The Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS) has revoked Celebi’s security clearance on grounds related to national security. Nothing is above the security of our nation and our fellow citizens. National interest and public safety are paramount and non-negotiable,” Union civil aviation minister Ram Mohan Naidu said in a statement. He added that efforts are underway to retain employees of Celebi and ensure continued handling of passenger and cargo services at the affected airports.The order, which takes immediate effect, is widely seen as a message from Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s administration that countries perceived to support Pakistan will face economic consequences. During Operation Sindoor, Pakistan reportedly used Turkish-origin drones in attacks on Indian cities, triggering diplomatic fallout.Amid growing public backlash, Turkish businesses are also feeling the heat in India. Tour operators have reported widespread cancellations of travel to Turkey, while protests have emerged against Turkish products such as marbles and apples.Celebi, meanwhile, has denied any links to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s daughter, Sümeyye Erdoğan, who was reported to have a stake in the company. Sümeyye is married to Selçuk Bayraktar, the chairman of BAYKAR, the manufacturer of the drones allegedly used by Pakistan.Concerns about potential disruption at Indian airports were eased after Delhi airport authorities announced the termination of their contract with CASIPL and assured continued smooth operations and employee retention. Most major airports in India work with multiple ground handling service providers. In Delhi, Bird Flight Services (BFS) and Air India SATS Airport Services (AISATS) are active. Bengaluru is served by AISATS and GlobeGround India, while Kochi has BFS, AI Airport Services Ltd (AIASL), and Agile (run by IndiGo).Ground handling companies are responsible for a range of critical airport services, including baggage and cargo loading, passenger check-in and boarding, fueling, maintenance support, cleaning, and guiding aircraft safely on the tarmac.","Celebi airport services india, in a may 16 filing seen by reuters, asked the delhi high court to set aside that decision.

NEW DELHI: Pulling the curtain down on a 25-year-old legal battle between the two factions of Iskcon over control of Hare Krishna temple and other assets in Bengaluru, Supreme Court on Friday ruled that Iskcon Bangalore will have control over it and quashed the Karnataka high court order in favour of Iskcon Mumbai .Noting that Iskcon was established with a laudable object and had initiated the Hare Krishna movement, a bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and Augustine George Masih said the dispute between Iskcon Mumbai and Iskcon Bangalore ought not to have been brought to court. The dispute between the two organisations, which are working to spread devotion and spirituality , began in 2001 when Iskcon Bangalore filed a civil suit for control of the temple and other material assets.Examining all the documentary records and statement of witnesses, the court said that the application for allotment of land was made by Iskcon Bangalore and the sale deed was also executed in its favour, and Iskcon Mumbai cannot lay claim over it.“Therefore, the high court’s finding that Iskcon Mumbai, through its branch in Bangalore, was the owner of the Schedule ‘A’ property is completely erroneous and deserves to be set aside. It is completely contrary to the documentary evidence. Even assuming that Iskcon Bangalore did not possess funds, and even if money came from Iskcon Mumbai, it cannot claim ownership. Only because the existence of the Bangalore branch of Iskcon Mumbai was proved, one cannot jump to the conclusion that allotment of Schedule ‘A’ property was to Iskcon Mumbai through the Bangalore branch,” the court said.Karnataka HC had on May 23, 2011 passed an order in favour of the Mumbai unit by setting aside the decree passed by the trial court, and Iskcon Bangalore thereafter moved the apex court which passed an interim order to maintain status quo.","The dispute between the two organisations, which are working to spread devotion and spirituality, began in 2001.

No chaos at major airports as other ground handlers step in,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-chaos-at-major-airports-as-other-ground-handlers-step-in/articleshow/121220710.cms,"A recent government rule impacted operations of Turkiye's Celebi at nine Indian airports. Existing ground handling agencies stepped in to manage the workload. GMR Group made alternate arrangements at Goa's Mopa airport. Over 10,000 Celebi employees were absorbed by other handlers like Bird Group and AISATS. Operations have stabilized with no major disruptions.

NEW DELHI: The govt rule mandating that airports handling over a crore passengers annually have at least three ground handling agencies (GHA) meant that flights and passengers at majority of the nine airports from where Turkiye’s Celebi was barred on Thursday were not affected.Other ground handlers equally handled their share of the job Celebi was doing. This is an interim arrangement and airport operators will now issue tenders inviting bids for a third GHA.The exceptions included Goa (Mopa), where the Turkish company was the only JV and where the GMR Group has made alternate arrangements for now. The other eight airports — Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Chennai, Ahmedabad and Cochin — asked the other GHAs to chip in.Among the leading GHAs in India are Air India Airport Services Ltd (AIASL), Air India SATS Airport Services (AISATS), Bird Group’s Bird Flight Services (BFS) and Agile Airport Services (of IndiGo). “Air India and IndiGo mostly do their own self-handling through these companies. Other GHAs cater to smaller domestic and international airlines. In Delhi, for instance, non-airline GHAs may be handling 1-1.5 crore passengers annually. This keeps reducing for other airports. When the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security (BCAS) order of Thursday revoked security clearance to Celebi and its associated companies, airport operators reached out to us and asked us to do Celebi’s job for some time,” said a leading non-airline GHA.The handover from Celebe was completed within 24 hours, say people in the know. “The over 10,000 employees of Çelebi have been absorbed across interim handlers. About 35-40% of them have joined Bird Group, while the rest have been placed with AISATS and AIASL. There have been no job losses,” said another ground handler.Barring a few hiccups — mostly administrative and linked to communicating now with people who overnight came onto their rolls — GHAs say “operations have stabilised and there are no reported flight delays or passenger disruption”.“Till a third GHA is appointed, existing handlers will operate in a non profit, support-only capacity to ensure service continuity and regulatory compliance. We are stretched but in national interest will do the job as long as it is required to be done...,” they said.","Turkiye's celebi was barred on thursday from nine indian airports.

NEW DELHI: Home minister Amit Shah on Friday said ‘ Operation Sindoor ’ was a unique culmination of the “firm political will of PM Narendra Modi, pinpointed information generated by our intelligence agencies and the infallible strike capability of the three armed forces”.“India is proud of its three armed forces, BSF and all the security agencies ,” Shah said while unveiling the upgraded Multi-Agency Centre (MAC), the country’s foremost intelligence fusion centre — that connects all the intelligence, security, law enforcement and investigative agencies, at the North Block here.He underlined the new MAC will provide a seamless and integrated platform for agencies to coordinate their efforts towards addressing complex and interconnected national security challenges like terrorism, extremism, organised crime and cyber attacks.Referring to the 21-day anti-Naxal operation conducted recently by security forces at the Karreguttalu Hills on the Chhattisgarh-Telangana border, Shah said this displayed exemplary coordination between intelligence agencies and security forces. “There is very good coordination in the process and thinking of our intelligence agencies and the three armed forces,” he noted.The home minister lauded the new MAC network, which has undergone a hardware and software upgrade in record time to acquire futuristic capabilities such as embedded artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques. This will help to harness the potential of the vast database with MAC and geographic information system (GIS) services.Unveiling the future roadmap for the security establishment, Shah emphasised upon the need to integrate other significant databases housed with different central agencies in different silos, onto one platform, for leveraging advanced data analytics. The system, Shah said, will elevate the quality of data analytics generated on the MAC network, enabling accurate trend analysis, hotspot mapping and timeline analysis to give predictive and operational outcomes. “The new MAC will go a long way in combating the terror ecosystem having intricate linkages with organised crime,” he said.Shah has been actively guiding the technological upgradation of MAC, which was set up in 2001. Housed with the Intelligence Bureau, the new MAC follows qualitative and quantitative transformation at a cost of over Rs 500 crore.It has weaved in the country’s island territories, insurgency-affected areas and high-altitude terrain, while ensuring last-mile connectivity down to the district level, with a fast and standalone secure network.","Home minister amit shah on friday said ‘ operation sindoor ’ was a unique culmination of the ‘firm political will of pm narendra modi’ he was unveiling the upgraded multi-agency centre (mac), the country’s foremost intelligence fusion centre.

Govt to send all-party teams to brief nations on Pak-sponsored terrorism,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/govt-to-send-all-party-teams-to-brief-nations-on-pak-sponsored-terrorism/articleshow/121220536.cms,"Congress’s Kharge and Rahul Gandhi speak to the media after the meet

NEW DELHI: Stepping up its diplomatic offensive on Operation Sindoor , govt has decided to send five all-party delegations of MPs to different parts of the world starting next week to highlight Pakistan-sponsored terrorism. Each team will have eight members.MPs belonging to BJP, Congress, TMC, DMK, NCP (SP), JDU, BJD, Shiv Sena (UBT), CPM and some other parties will be part of the delegations which are meant to signal national unity.Sources said some former ministers would lead the delegations scheduled to visit various countries over a period period of 10 days. MEA will brief the MPs before they depart.Though all parties appeared to be on board, Congress sources were angry that govt had reached out to its MPs and others directly instead of approaching the leadership first. Sources said while party members would join the delegations in “supreme national interest”, it was for the leadership to decide who from its ranks would go. They particularly appeared to be unhappy about the likelihood of Shashi Tharoor being the choice to head one of the delegations, possibly the one to the US. “He, being chairman of the standing committee on external affairs, should have been the logical choice, but his remarks have lately been out of line with the party’s stand,” said a source.Congress sources also indicated that they would push for the inclusion of deputy leader in Lok Sabha Gaurav Gogoi in one of the teams.Govt expressed surprise at Congress’s response. “Members of delegations are supposed to pursue national interest and not work as representatives of political parties. They are going there as Indians,” a source said. “The practice has always been that govt chooses the members. So far nobody has objected,” he added.A leader of a party that has been sounded out for the exercise said they were asked to be ready to leave by May 22-23 for a period of 10 days and that MEA would be in touch with them to provide details, including the itinerary.Former Union ministers Ravi Shankar Prasad, Rajiv Pratap Rudy, Anurag Thakur, Aparajita Sarangi, Samik Bhattacharya and Brij Lal are among the BJP members to be part of the teams, sources said.At least four MPs from Congress, besides members of other parties, have been tapped by govt for the exercise. They include Tharoor, Manish Tewari, Salman Khurshid and Amar Singh. However, Congress sources said at least three leaders told govt that it should contact their party leadership for the names.TMC’s Sudip Bandyopadhyay, JDU’s Sanjay Jha, BJD’s Sasmit Patra, CPM’s John Brittas, UBT’s Priyanka Chaturvedi, NCP (SP)’s Supriya Sule, DMK’s K Kanimozhi, AIMIM’s Asaduddin Owaisi and AAP’s Vikramjit Sawhney are also being tapped to be part of the delegations, sources said.While Khurshid, a former external affairs minister, has been asked to lead a delegation of seven MPs to south and south-east Asia, covering countries such as South Korea, Japan and Singapore, Baramati MP Sule is likely to lead a team to West Asia and Africa, including the likes of Oman, Egypt, Kenya and South Africa, sources said.Tewari is likely to lead a delegation to Europe or West Asia and has been asked about his availability while Tharoor could lead a team to the US, they said, adding that former Union minister Ghulam Nabi Azad was likely to be part of one delegation.While there was no official word from govt on the delegations, Congress’s Jairam Ramesh said Union minister Kiren Rijiju had spoken to party president Mallikarjun Kharge.",Five all-party delegations of mps will be sent to different parts of the world starting next week.

AHMEDABAD: A day after his arrest by Enforcement Directorate on money laundering charges in a 2023 complaint, Bahubali Shah , 73, director of Gujarat Samachar Ltd and Lok Prakashan Ltd, was granted interim bail until May 31 by a special PMLA court on Friday on health grounds .After ED sleuths brought Shah to VS Hospital for a medical examination after his arrest on Thursday evening, his health condition deteriorated. Shah was immediately admitted to the ICU of a private hospital on SG Highway where he remains under treatment.Shah’s arrest by ED was preceded by an extensive search and survey carried out on 40-odd residential and business premises in Ahmedabad associated with Gujarat Samachar daily and other business entities mainly in the real estate sector .Appearing on behalf of Shah, senior counsel Devang Vyas filed a regular bail application before the court mainly on health grounds. He assured the court of Shah’s full cooperation in the investigation once his health improved. The ED did not object to the grant of bail for a brief period considering his health condition. However, the agency reserved its right to reply to the regular bail plea later. Special PMLA judge K S Sojitra granted interim bail to Shah on furnishing surety and a personal bond of Rs 10,000.The court has ordered the accused to update the IO about his health condition every alternate day. The court has directed that he should not attempt to hamper or tamper with the case. Shah has also been ordered to extend full cooperation to the investigating agency subject to his health condition. The court has posted further hearing on the regular bail plea on May 31.Opposition Congress on Friday flayed the ED’s action against Shah. Rahul Gandhi said in a post on X that the attempt to silence Gujarat Samachar “is another conspiracy to suppress the voice not just of one newspaper but of the entire democracy”. He added, “The country will neither be run by sticks nor by fear — India will be run by truth and the Constitution.”","Bahubali shah, 73, director of gujarat samachar ltd and lok prakashan ltd, was granted interim bail until may 31 by a special pmla court on friday on health grounds.

CHENNAI: Enforcement Directorate took Tasmac managing director S Visakan, an IAS officer, to their office in Nungambakkam on Friday for interrogation in connection with its investigation of suspected financial discrepancies in Tamil Nadu State Marketing Corporation . His Manapakkam residence was searched earlier in the day.The searches began at 6am in various locations on Friday.

NEW DELHI: PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti may have slammed Jammu and Kashmir CM Omar Abdullah over his call for reviving the Tulbul Navigation Project , but he has echoed India’s long-term interests, with experts flagging how its implementation will yield socio-economic benefits for the entire UT.The project, also known as the Wular Barrage , is a navigation lock-cum-control structure located at the outlet of the country’s largest freshwater lake, Wular, in J&K. It was designed to facilitate navigation on the Jhelum river during lean winter months (Oct-Feb) but was stalled by Pakistan citing the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT).As the treaty is in abeyance following the last month Pahalgam terror attack, experts, who have tracked the project’s development ever since it was stalled by Pakistan in 1987, believe that its implementation can be the most immediate step for the benefit of J&K.“It is time for India to finally break ground on the long-stalled Tulbul Navigation Project,” said Uttam Sinha, a senior fellow at the Manohar Parrikar Institute of Defence Studies and Analyses. He rues that for nearly four decades, the “developmental aspirations” of the people of Kashmir were “sacrificed at the altar of diplomatic caution” even as its implementation falls well within the treaty.“It is a matter of interpretation. India has long held the view that regulating depletion of naturally stored water for use of navigation, which is non-consumptive, is permissible under the IWT,” said Sinha.Kushvinder Vohra, former Central Water Commission chairperson, echoed similar views and explained how the project will help in better flood and water management through the Wular lake, and also help in tackling drainage congestion downstream.“It shall help in maintaining requisite water depth in the Jhelum below the Wular lake during the lean period so that navigation can be maintained throughout the year,” said Vohra, noting that it will also have an “incidental benefit” of increase in power production through hydro-electric projects .But why was the project stalled when it falls well within the treaty? After all, non-consumptive use is permitted to India under the IWT which includes control or use of water for navigation, provided these do not prejudice downstream uses of waters by Pakistan. Islamabad could never establish any prejudice to their downstream uses by the construction of the structure.Pakistan during multiple secretary-level talks in the past flagged that the project structure is a barrage with a storage capacity of around 0.3 million acre feet (0.369 billion cubic metre) and that India is not permitted to construct any storage facility on the main stem of the Jhelum river.Sinha said, “It’s a matter of interpretation...Now, the suspension (of the IWT) paves the way for a more assertive water strategy...Implementation of the Tulbul project is the most immediate step that can be taken.”","The project, also known as the wular barrage, is a navigation lock-cum-control structure located at the outlet of the country’s largest freshwater lake, wular.
