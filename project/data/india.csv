NEW DELHI: Odisha 's Cuttack witnessed fresh communal tensions and violent clashes on Sunday after police denied permission for a bike rally organised by a group.The confrontation escalated, leading to stone pelting, arson, and a police crackdown that left at least 25 people, including eight police personnel, injured. Authorities have imposed a 36-hour curfew and suspended internet services to prevent further unrest.As the atmosphere in Cuttack remains highly tense, demonstrators occupied major streets on Sunday, culminating in a call for a Cuttack Bandh on Monday. During the rally, protesters were heard raising provocative slogans demanding an “exclusive Hindu-only identity” for the city.Chief minister Mohan Charan Majhi expressed sorrow over the group clash and urged all citizens to maintain peace and order.""Cuttack, with its rich thousand-year history, stands as a testament to unity and brotherhood. However, in recent days, the peace in the city was disrupted by some miscreants, affecting the daily lives of ordinary people. The govt is keeping an eye on these miscreants and will take strict action against them,"" the CM's statement read.The violent confrontation in Cuttack stemmed from a series of incidents that began during the Durga idol immersion procession late Friday night and escalated further on Sunday.Tension first broke out around 2 am on the intervening night of Friday-Saturday when the Jhanjirimangala Bhagabat Puja Committee’s procession was heading to Debigada for the immersion of Goddess Durga.Local residents reportedly objected to the loud music accompanying the procession, sparking a heated argument between the two groups. The situation quickly spiralled out of control as stones and glass bottles were hurled near Dargah Bazar Jail Road, turning the area into a conflict zone.Police were forced to resort to a lathi-charge to disperse the mob. Several people were injured in the melee, including Deputy Commissioner of Police Rishikesh Khilari, who sustained a forehead injury after being hit by a stone.After this incident, police heightened security across the city amid fears of communal tension. On Sunday, an organisation sought permission to conduct a bike rally, but authorities denied it, citing the fragile situation after the earlier clash. Despite the denial, some members of the group attempted to go ahead with the rally, resulting in a fresh confrontation with the police.As the rally participants clashed with security forces, stone pelting resumed, injuring several police personnel. The unrest spread to nearby areas, with reports of fires being set at multiple locations. Authorities eventually used force to disperse the mob, imposed a 36-hour curfew, and suspended internet services to restore order in the city.""Today, an organisation in Cuttack requested permission to hold a bike rally, but it was denied. This led to a clash with the police. When the police enforced that they would not be allowed to pass through the road, as it could lead to communal tensions. Eight policemen were injured in the stone pelting. These individuals were later dispersed using force,"" Police Commissioner Suresh Debadutta Singh told news agency ANI.After the clashes, authorities imposed a 36-hour curfew in affected areas and suspended internet services for 24 hours.Cuttack District Magistrate Dattatraya Bhausaheb Shinde confirmed the measures, said: ""Right now, the situation is under control. Unfortunately, some issues arose during the evening. Unfortunately, the crowd went out of control, and there were some injuries on the police side, so we have immediately stopped internet services for 24 hours in the city. The curfew will be imposed immediately. Additional forces have been requisitioned, and we already have around ten companies in place. But we will also be getting around three platoons of force from the Central Armed Forces.""He appealed for peace, emphasising the city’s communal harmony.""We request everybody, and we appeal to everybody that Cuttack has always been the city of brotherhood, and let us continue that way. We have also been engaging with the community leaders of various communities over the last two to three days. We have been engaging with them, and we are continuing this engagement, and they have all assured us that this will not happen again,"" Shinde said.He assured that within the next 24 hours the situation will be under control.""DGP has already ensured that whoever has tried to breach this peace in this peaceful city will not be spared. The internet has been banned for 24 hours, and we think that within 24 hours, we will be able to bring that under control. If not, we are ready to ban it for the next 24 hours also,"" the Cuttack DM said.Police officials dismissed rumours circulating on social media about a death linked to a prior incident during Durga idol immersion.""We have also learned that rumours were being spread that one of the four individuals who were injured in the stone-pelting incident during Durga idol immersion has died. Those who spread these rumours will be arrested. Of the four injured that day, all had minor injuries. Three were discharged the same day. One is being treated. A curfew will be imposed to maintain peace,"" Commissioner Singh clarified to news agency ANI.The state government suspended internet and social media services in the Cuttack Municipal Corporation, Cuttack Development Authority (CDA), and the 42 Mauza Region until 7 PM on Monday.According to a government circular, a prohibition has been imposed ""on the use and access of social media platforms, including WhatsApp, Facebook, and X, until 7 PM on Monday in the Cuttack Municipal Corporation, Cuttack Development Authority (CDA), and the 42 Mauza Region.”The order was issued under Section 5(2) of the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885, and Rule 2(1) of the Temporary Suspension of Telecom Services (Public Emergency/Public Safety) Rules, 2017.Even as security forces conducted flag marches to maintain order, rioters set fire to multiple locations in the Gouri Shankar Park area.Assistant Fire Officer Sanjeeb Kumar Behera said: ""We received information that near the Gouri Shankar Park, rioters have set fire to 8-10 places. We have extinguished the fire. The rioters are pelting stones at us. Police have been deployed to control the situation.""According to reports, stone pelting continued in parts of the city as police reinforcements were deployed.Odisha Director-General of Police Yogesh Bahadur Khurania assured that the situation was under control.""The police are closely monitoring the situation. Action will be taken against all anti-social elements involved in the violence. I would like to inform all residents of Cuttack not to trust any rumour. They should immediately check the police website, the Commissionerate's website, and their Twitter handle.""Former Odisha chief minister and leader of opposition Naveen Patnaik appealed for calm and harmony, expressing deep concern over the deteriorating law and order situation in the city.Local leaders have condemned the incident. MLA Sofia Firdous and former MLA Md. Moquim described the situation as ""very unfortunate"" and urged citizens to work towards restoring peace. Both leaders emphasised the importance of maintaining Cuttack's long-standing tradition of unity and cooperation among communities.""We must remain patient and committed to making everything normal again. The city has always been a symbol of unity, and it is crucial that we all work together to ensure this doesn't divide us,"" said MLA Sofia Firdous.Echoing similar sentiments, former MLA Md. Moquim emphasised that the authorities would ensure the accused would face strict punishment. ""Justice will be served, and the rule of law will prevail,"" he assured.","Cuttack witnessed fresh communal tensions and violent clashes on sunday after police denied permission for a bike rally organised by a group.

Poll Should hospitals be required to improve safety regulations for ICU facilities? Yes, it's essential for patient safety. No, existing regulations are sufficient.

Relatives allege negligence



NEW DELHI: Six patients died and five remain critical after a fire broke out at the trauma ICU of Jaipur’s Sawai Man Singh (SMS) Hospital late on Sunday night.Police said the exact cause of the fire is yet to be determined, though a short circuit is suspected. ""At first glance, it appears to be a short circuit, but the final cause will only be determined after the FSL investigation,"" Jaipur Police Commissioner Biju George Joseph said.SMS Hospital Trauma Centre In-charge Anurag Dhakad told ANI that the fire started in the trauma ICU on the second floor and spread quickly, releasing toxic gases. “Our trauma centre has two ICUs on the second floor: a trauma ICU and a semi-ICU. We had 24 patients there; 11 in the trauma ICU and 13 in the semi-ICU. A short circuit occurred in the trauma ICU, and the fire spread rapidly, releasing toxic gases,” he said.Dhakad added that most of the patients in the ICU were comatose. “Our trauma centre team, our nursing officers, and ward boys, immediately rescued them on trolleys and brought as many patients as we could out of the ICU and shifted them to another location.Six of those patients were very critical; we tried very hard to revive them with CPR, but they couldn't be saved,” he said.According to Dhakad, two of the deceased were women and four were men. Five patients are still critical. “There were 24 that we evacuated: 11 in the trauma ICU and 13 in the adjacent ICU,” he said.Authorities are investigating the cause of the short circuit and assessing damage to the facility. Rescue operations were completed shortly after the blaze was brought under control.Meanwhile, relatives of the patients recounted distressing scenes as smoke engulfed the ward, alleging lapses in safety measures and delayed response from hospital staff.Puran Singh, a relative of a patient, said, as quoted by news agency ANI, ""When there was a spark, there was a cylinder beside it. The smoke spread throughout the ICU, causing everyone to flee in panic. Some managed to rescue their own patients, but mine was left alone in the room. As the gas spread further, they shut the gates.""Narendra Singh, another relative, was quoted by ANI as saying, ""There was a fire in the ICU, and I didn't even know. I had come downstairs to have dinner at the time. There wasn't even any equipment to douse the fire — no facilities were available. My mother was admitted there.""Om Prakash, whose 25-year-old maternal aunt’s son was admitted, recounted, ""Smoke started spreading around 11:20pm, and I warned the doctors that it could cause discomfort to patients. By the time the smoke intensified, the doctors and compounders had already fled. Only 4 to 5 patients were evacuated. Tragically, my maternal aunt's son lost his life due to the incident. He was about to recover and was scheduled to be discharged in two-three days. ""Jogendra Singh alleged negligence by hospital staff. ""My mother was admitted to the ICU. When the spark occurred, I alerted the doctors four to five times that it was coming from there, but they dismissed it as normal. Suddenly, smoke engulfed the area, and all the staff ran out, leaving no one to help or save my mother. I was outside when I asked the police, and they said everyone had been evacuated. However, my mother and brother were still trapped inside the hospital. Somehow, I managed to rescue my brother, but he is now in critical condition,"" he said.Ranjit Singh Rathore, whose brother was admitted, said he received a call at 11:30pm. ""I had just arrived this evening. I rushed to the hospital, but initially, they wouldn't let me inside. After some time, I managed to enter. When I went in, I found my brother dead,"" he was quoted as saying by the news agency ANI.","A fire broke out at the trauma icu of jaipur’s sawai man singh (sms) hospital late on sunday night.

LUCKNOW/BAHRAICH: Uttar Pradesh's forest department issued Sunday ""shoot on sight"" orders for wolves following a spate of attacks in Bahraich district that have left six people, including four children, dead in the past two months. The order coincided with fresh attacks that left three villagers injured.""Given the repeated attacks by wolves on villagers, state government has authorised our teams to take strict action to neutralise any aggressive wolves posing a direct threat to human life,"" district forest officer (DFO) Ram Singh Yadav said.Officials emphasised that the measure was intended as a last-resort safety step, targeting only wolves that exhibit violent behaviour towards humans, while regular wildlife in the forest remains protected under state laws. Authorities said Bahraich's Kaiserganj and Mahsi areas were the worst affected.The latest attacks on Sunday left two villagers in Tediya Kotia in Ramganj area and one in Bahorwa Naubasta seriously wounded. Following this, enraged villagers reportedly cornered and killed the animal. DFO Yadav directed a team to visit the spot. ""We examined the animal and found it to be a jackal. The attacks were carried out by the jackal,"" he said.According to reports, Sushila (21) was attacked when she stepped out of home for routine chores. The animal, hiding in the bushes, leapt on her. Hearing her screams, villagers rushed to the scene. During the commotion, it entered the house of Ram Kumar (40) and attacked him. Both were rushed to hospital, where their condition was said to be stable.In Bahorwa Naubasta village, Barsati Lal Shukla, 62, was attacked by a wolf on his farm. He suffered leg injuries but fended off the animal by charging at it with a sickle.State minister Arun Kumar, meanwhile, conducted a survey of Kaiserganj along with DM Akshay Tripathi and other senior officials. He met the families of some of the villagers who died or were injured in wolf attacks and pledged aid. Officials briefed him on efforts to contain the menace. tnn","U.s. forest department issues ""shoot on sight"" orders for wolves following spate of attacks in bahraich district that have left six people, including four children, dead in the past two months.

Bengal floods: Trajectory change of low-pressure system led to havoc,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bengal-floods-trajectory-change-of-low-pressure-system-led-to-havoc/articleshow/124328070.cms,"A portion of a road connecting Siliguri and Darjeeling, damaged after landslide on Sunday

KOLKATA: Devastating rain that flooded the plains and hills of north Bengal was brought by an unexpected change in the trajectory of a low-pressure system triggered by the retreating monsoon, meteorologists have said.The system, which formed over the Bay of Bengal on Sept 30, made landfall in Odisha as a depression and was moving north-northwest towards Chhattisgarh when it suddenly recurved towards north Bihar, coming dangerously close to north Bengal.“Even though not very intense, such systems cover a wide region. North Bengal fell within the periphery of this one, which explains the heavy rain. In fact, Kolkata, too, continues to be impacted by the same system,” a meteorologist said.Sourish Bandopadhyay, a scientist at the regional meteorological centre, said, “Clouds kept floating into the hills and over Dooars. Extremely heavy rain, over 200mm in around 24 hours, occurred in some parts of Darjeeling, Alipurduar, Kalimpong, and Jalpaiguri on Friday and Saturday. Its intensity reduced Sunday.”Darjeeling recorded 261mm of rain in 24 hours till 8 am on Sunday, followed by Cooch Behar (192mm), Jalpaiguri (172mm), and Bagdogra-Siliguri (134mm).Excess water flowing through rivers entering Bengal from Sikkim and Bhutan only worsened the devastation.“Since monsoon is now retreating from north India, strong westerly winds diverted the system towards north Bihar, bringing it closer to north Bengal. It was prevented from advancing into central India, which is the usual path for such systems... The ‘recurve’ was unexpected but not unusual,” said a meteorologist. In its current state as a cyclonic circulation, the system still covers a wide area — across north Bihar, hills of Bengal, and eastern Nepal.“Rain will continue in these areas. The system is likely to move towards Bangladesh, though it may lose steam over the next 48 hours,” the meteorologist added.","The system, which formed over the bay of bengal on sept 30, made landfall in odisha as a depression.

NAGPUR: At least 14 more children from Madhya Pradesh's Chhindwara district who had been administered the now-banned cough syrup Coldrif are battling for life in government and private hospitals in Nagpur after suffering renal failure.Lab reports confirmed the six children who died at GMCH-Nagpur had suffered renal failure due to diethylene glycol (DEG) toxicity. Syrup samples were found to be contaminated with 48.6% DEG, a toxic substance used as antifreeze and in brake fluids. Initially, these deaths were assumed to be cases of acute encephalitis syndrome (AES), but zero urine output in patients with a history of cough and fever raised alarm among govt doctors.Nagpur municipal corporation is set to issue guidelines to all medical practitioners, advising them not to prescribe cough syrups, especially to children below five years.On Sunday, Maharashtra government banned Coldrif, manufactured by Sresan Pharma in Tamil Nadu's Kancheepuram. Head of GMCH's paediatrics department, Dr Manish Tiwari, said three children remain on ventilator support while two are in critical condition.Deputy director of health services Dr Shashikant Shambharkar said 14 children are currently admitted to govt and private hospitals in Nagpur. ""We have instructed all public health hospitals in Nagpur, spanning six districts, not to prescribe this syrup. However, none of our hospitals had any supply or stock of Coldrif. No renal failure cases among children from Nagpur or Vidarbha districts have been reported. We only have sporadic AES cases from some Vidarbha districts, but they are not related to cough syrup,"" he said.Paediatric intensivist Dr Anupam Bahe, who treated six children from MP for renal failure at Nelson Hospital, said besides Coldrif, their patients were also given two other cough syrups. ""Two children were administered cough syrups of different local brands. Both were later shifted to other hospitals and remain critical,"" he said.NMC officials said surveillance and monitoring are still underway.",At least 14 more children from madhya pradesh's chhindwara district are battling for life in government and private hospitals in nagpur after suffering renal failure.

With 13 dead, tourist town of Mirik badly hit, direct link to Siliguri cut off

Relentless overnight rain lashed north Bengal's hills and plains Saturday night and early Sunday, unleashing landslides, washing away bridges and flooding towns from Darjeeling to Cooch Behar.At least 28 people died - most of them in the hill station of Mirik - and dozens remained missing as rescue teams struggled to reach remote areas cut off by the deluge.Darjeeling recorded 261 mm in 24 hours from 8 am Saturday, classified as 'extremely heavy rainfall', while Cooch Behar logged 192mm and Jalpaiguri 172mm. Gajoldoba (Jalpaiguri) reported 300mm of rain.The worst devastation was reported from Mirik, Jorebunglow, Maneybhanjang, Sukhiapokhri and Falakata.Thirteen bodies were found in Mirik, known for its Sumendu lake and views of Kanchenjunga. Ten others, including tourist Himadri Purkayet from Kolkata, were missing till Sunday evening. Officials warned that the toll may rise once teams reach the upper hills.PM Narendra Modi expressed grief on social media: “Deeply pained by the loss of lives due to a bridge mishap in Darjeeling... The situation is being closely monitored in the wake of heavy rain and landslides.We are committed to providing all possible assistance.”The downpour destroyed critical links: an iron bridge on Balasan river at Dudhia — the only direct route between Siliguri & Mirik — collapsed, isolating nearby communities. Another bridge at Pulbazar was badly damaged, cutting off Thanaline and parts of Bijanbari. Rohini Road, a major connector between Darjeeling and the plains, also caved in. NH10, the lifeline to Sikkim, was shut at Chitrey after landslides. Darjeeling Himalayan Railway suspended service indefinitely.Flash floods and landslides turned post-Durga Puja holidays in north Bengal into a desperate fight for survival. Hundreds of tourists across Dooars, Kalimpong, and Darjeeling are stuck in hill resorts and wildlife zones. They reported power outages, poor connectivity, and washed-out roads. Some clung to ziplines or ropes to cross torrents. “Water currents were so strong we had to form a human chain,” said Kolkata resident Priya Banerjee, who walked four hours before finding a vehicle.In Sisamara, businessman Saurav Palit and his family slogged 6km through mud and floodwater, and later paid Rs 4,000 for a 30-minute drive to Falakata. In Jaldapara, some waded waist-deep through rising waters before being rescued — a few even ferried out on elephant back. “We were stranded all day before forest officials brought elephants used for safaris to take us through flooded rivers to safer ground,” said Senjuti Ghosh from Kolkata, now staying in an Alipurduar hotel until her train home Tuesday night. Authorities shut all tourist spots and appealed to visitors to stay put until help arrived. Darjeeling SP Praween Prakash urged travellers to follow official police updates on social media. “Check advisories before venturing out,” he said.Travel chaos rippled across the region. Tourists trying to reach New Jalpaiguri station and Bagdogra airport missed trains and flights.CM Mamata Banerjee held an emergency virtual meeting with top officials and regional leaders, including Siliguri mayor Gautam Deb and GTA chief Anit Thapa, and announced she would visit the disaster zone Monday. “Several areas in both north and south Bengal have been flooded due to sudden huge rain and excessive river waters from Bhutan and Sikkim,” Banerjee posted on X. “Rainfall exceeded 300mm in 12 hours last night. I convey my heartfelt condolences to the families of the deceased and have ordered immediate assistance.”She directed closure of all tourist sites in affected areas & released emergency helpline numbers from the Nabanna control room, assuring tourists that rescue costs would be borne by the state.By Sunday afternoon, Army units and NDRF teams joined state agencies in rescue and restoration. With Mahananda, Jaldhaka and Teesta rivers running above danger levels, elephants, rhinos, deer, and bison were seen fleeing submerged forests.(With inputs from Suman Chakraborti, Debashis Konar, Basabdatta Sarkar, Nisha Chhetri & Srishti Lakhotia)","At least 28 people died - most of them in the hill station of mirik - and dozens remained missing as rescue teams struggled to reach remote areas cut off by the deluge.

SRINAGAR/JAIPUR: Jailed climate activist Sonam Wangchuk has demanded an independent judicial inquiry into the September 24 firing in Leh, which left four people dead and over 70 wounded, and said he was prepared to remain in prison until the probe is conducted.In his first message from Jodhpur central jail, Wangchuk appealed to the people of Ladakh to maintain peace and unity while continuing their fight for statehood and Sixth Schedule status “in the true Gandhian way of non-violence”.“I stand firmly with Apex Body Leh, Kargil Democratic Alliance, and the people of Ladakh in our genuine constitutional demand for Sixth Schedule and statehood,” Wangchuk said in the message relayed by Mustafa Haji, legal advisor to the apex body. “Whatever actions Apex Body Leh takes in the interest of Ladakh, I am with them wholeheartedly.”Haji and Wangchuk’s elder brother Ka Tsetan Dorjey Ley met him at Jodhpur jail Saturday. Haji posted Sunday the activist’s message on X and Facebook, quoting Wangchuk as saying he was “doing well, both physically and mentally” and thanking supporters for their concern and prayers. He expressed condolences to the families of those killed and said his “prayers are with those wounded and arrested”.Wangchuk was taken into custody on September 26 under NSA, two days after protests in Leh turned violent. Police and paramilitary forces fired at demonstrators demanding Ladakh’s inclusion under Sixth Schedule and restoration of statehood. Supreme Court is scheduled to hear Monday a petition filed by Wangchuk’s wife Gitanjali J Angmo challenging his arrest under NSA and seeking his immediate release.The unrest came amid Wangchuk’s hunger strike, launched on Sept 10 to press for those demands. The clashes and fatal firing on Sept 24 prompted Wangchuk to call off his fast.Union home ministry had earlier announced that the next round of talks with Ladakh representatives would be held on October 6, but both ABL and Kargil Democratic Alliance (KDA) withdrew after the killings, insisting that dialogue could resume only after a judicial probe into the firing and the release of those arrested, including Wangchuk.While the UT administration in Ladakh has ordered a magisterial inquiry into the Leh violence, ABL and KDA have rejected it, reiterating their demand for a judicial probe by a retired Supreme Court judge before returning to talks.",Jailed climate activist sonam wangchuk has demanded an independent judicial inquiry into the september 24 firing in leh.

Air India Dreamliner RAM deploys in final approach to UK; lands safely & grounded for checks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/air-india-dreamliner-ram-deploys-in-final-approach-to-uk-lands-safely-grounded-for-checks/articleshow/124316424.cms,"AI 787 RAT deployed

Poll Do you think the safety measures on flights are adequate? Yes No

NEW DELHI: The ram air turbine (RAT) of an Air India Dreamliner deployed on its final approach, seconds before landing at 400 feet, to Birmingham on Saturday. The aircraft landed safely and has been grounded for checks. The RAT - a last-resort emergency power system - was deployed seconds after the ill-fated Air India Boeing 787 Dreamliner lifted off from Ahmedabad on June 12.While the Boeing 787 was released for service by Sunday evening (India time), the directorate general of civil aviation (DGCA) says “requires detailed investigation” which has been assigned to a senior air safety official. At the time of filing this story, AI was evaluating whether to operate the about 12-year-old VT-ANO back to India as a scheduled or a ferry (without passengers) flight.RAT - a last-resort emergency power system - was deployed seconds after the ill-fated Air India Boeing 787 Dreamliner lifted off from Ahmedabad on June 12. Hence its deployment created a flutter on Saturday when the deployment happened on yet another AI B787-8 Dreamliner.In a statement, AI said: “The operating crew of flight AI117 from Amritsar to Birmingham on Oct 4, 2025, detected deployment of the Ram Air Turbine (RAT) of the aircraft during its final approach.All electrical and hydraulic parameters were found normal, and the aircraft performed a safe landing at Birmingham. The aircraft has been grounded for further checks and consequently, AI114 from Birmingham to Delhi has been cancelled and alternative arrangements are being made to accommodate the guests. At Air India, the safety of passengers and crew remains top priority.”AI 117 had taken off from Amritsar at 12.52 pm on Oct 4. “During landing at 400 feet, RAT unlock message came and RAT got deployed. Pilots did not report any related abnormality. The aircraft landed safely (at Birmingham 7.07 pm, all local timings),” said a senior official, adding, “Boeing has issued a ‘fleet team digest’ containing brief of previous such cases.”According to aviation website Skybrary: “RAT is a small turbine that is installed in an aircraft and used as an alternate or emergency hydraulic or electrical power source. (It) generates power from the airstream based on the speed of the aircraft and is connected to an electrical generator or to a hydraulic pump.”“In general, modern aircraft only utilise RAT in emergency: either in the event of loss of hydraulic systems or following the loss of primary electrical generation. In these cases the RAT will power vital systems such as flight controls or flight-critical instrumentation, navigation and communication equipment. Some RATs produce only hydraulic power which in turn is used to power an electrical generator,” Skybrary adds.","The ram air turbine (rat) of an air india dreamliner deployed on its final approach, seconds before landing at 400 feet.

BENGALURU: Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah said on Sunday that Lingayat is a separate religion, a statement that is likely to reignite the opposition’s allegations made during 2013-18 that he was trying to divide Veerashaiva-Lingayat community.Speaking at the closing ceremony of Basava cultural campaign 2025, which was organised by Lingayat Seers’ Association, the CM said, “Caste system is rooted in our society. To uproot this caste system, Basavanna launched a separate religion.”The statement comes amid the confusion within Lingayat community, which has been divided over whether to register themselves in the ongoing socio-educational survey as a separate religion or as a caste under Hindu religion.While opposition BJP has been urging Veerashaiva-Lingayats to identify themselves as a caste and strengthen Hindu community in the state, the Congress leadership has been seeking to project the community as a separate religion.In fact, at the beginning of his speech, he said he did not want to dwell upon a lot of matters at the Lingayat convention as whatever he says will soon turn into a controversy. Attacking the caste system in his speech, Siddaramaiah said, “I’m a Shudra under the Chaturvarna system.Just because I’m Shudra (doesn’t mean) I can be denied opportunity for education and equality. Caste does not make anyone big or famous ... Knowledge is nobody’s property and cannot be denied. ”Siddaramaiah urged the lower castes and all those who follow the principles of Basavanna to consolidate towards ensuring a casteless society in the country.“(Ram Manohar) Lohia once said rallies by forward castes is a caste consolidation effort. But rallies by backward castes and the downtrodden is not consolidation, but a rally towards seeking equality. If we want an equal and humane society then we must consolidate to achieve this goal,” he said.",Karnataka chief minister siddaramaiah said on sunday that lingayat is a separate religion.

NEW DELHI: Those who violate traffic and other motor vehicle (MV) rules will soon be required to either accept and pay challans or contest them with supporting evidence within 45 days, says a draft notification proposing amendments to the MV Rules related to the issuance and payment of challans.As per the proposed changes notified by the road transport ministry, regional transport offices (RTOs) won’t process any applications related to the licence or vehicle registration of such offenders until the dues are cleared. Such vehicles and driving licence holders will also be flagged as “not to be transacted” on Vahan and Sarathi portal.Sources said these changes have been proposed to nudge violators to clear their dues.However, experts cautioned that, before implementing the changes, the govt must ensure that systems are in place for driving licence (DL) and registration certificate (RC) holders to raise objections against challans, and for their names to be promptly removed from the pending payment list once the dues are cleared.“The draft rules specify that anyone receiving a challan may contest it on the portal with supporting documentary evidence before an authority designated by the respective state govt.There is a need to clearly define the responsibilities of this authority, and there should be a penalty provision in place if the authority fails to remove a vehicle or individual from the defaulter list after dues have been cleared,” said a veteran from the transport industry.The ministry has proposed that police officers in uniform or any other official authorised by state govts be allowed to issue challan physically. They could also auto-generate challans. These challans must be delivered either in person within 15 days or electronically within three days.If a person does not contest a challan before the designated authority, it will be deemed accepted 45 days after issuance.According to the draft rules, if a challan is contested and the authority fails to resolve it within 30 days, or if it decides to quash the challan with recorded reasons, the penalty will no longer be enforceable.The petitioner may either accept the order and pay the fine within 30 days of it being uploaded on the portal or file an application before a court after depositing 50 per cent of the penalty amount. If the individual neither pays the fine nor contests the challan in court within 30 days of receiving the order, the challan will be deemed accepted.",Road transport ministry proposes changes to mv rules related to the issuance and payment of challans.

‘Truth Will Come Out’: Vijay Releases First Video Message After Karur Stampede Tragedy

KARUR: Tamil Nadu police charged the driver of actor-politician Vijay's bus with negligent driving, a day after Madras high court questioned why no FIR was filed over two alleged hit-and-run accidents involving the convoy of the TVK chief's campaign during the September 27 Karur stampede that killed 41 people.Inspector RS Om Prakash said a case was registered against the campaign bus driver under Section 281 of BNS, which deals with rash driving or riding on a public way that endangers life. Asked why no separate case was filed under provisions specific to hit-and-run, he said Section 281 ""also covers that aspect"", but declined to elaborate.HC had earlier said: ""Media footage shows the bus carrying Vijay was involved in an accident where two motorcycles were hit. The driver, after seeing the accident, fled the scene. A similar collision at the rear of the bus is also visible. In both cases, FIRs have not been registered.""A police SIT formed to probe the stampede began its work Sunday. Headed by IG Asra Garg, the team inspected the Velusamypuram rally site. ""Probe has just begun. Nothing more can be said at this stage,"" Garg said.The team will probe alleged overcrowding, security lapses, crowd control failures, and claims that Vijay's delayed arrival triggered the fatal crowd crush. The stampede has since sparked a fierce political row - Vijay's TVK hinting at a conspiracy, while the AIADMK and BJP blamed the DMK-led state government. CM MK Stalin's govt has claimed that the crowd surge followed Vijay's delayed appearance.","Madras high court questioned why no fir was filed over two alleged hit-and-run accidents involving the convoy of the tvk chief's campaign during the karur stampede that killed 41 people.

NEW DELHI: Cuttack remained tense on Sunday following new incidents of violence linked to a group clash during a Durga idol immersion procession two days ago.Due to the tense law and order situation, the state government suspended internet services from 7 pm on Sunday to 7 pm on Monday in areas under Cuttack Municipal Corporation, Cuttack Development Authority (CDA), and the nearby 42 Mauza region to curb the spread of misinformation.The Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) had organised a motorcycle rally on Sunday evening despite orders from the district administration. Officials said CCTV cameras along the route were damaged and shops in the Gourishankar Park area were set on fire after police tried to stop the procession.According to PTI, the rally began at Bidyadharpur on the city’s eastern outskirts and moved through key areas, including the Dargah Bazar locality where the previous violence occurred, before ending at Sector 11 of CDA. Participants were heard chanting “Jai Shri Ram” as they moved through the city.Odisha's CM Mohan Charan Majhi, in a statement issued by the chief minister’s office, expressed sorrow over the disturbances. “Cuttack is a thousand-year-old city known for its brotherhood. Due to the actions of some miscreants, the peace of the city has been disturbed in recent days,” he said. He added that the government was monitoring troublemakers closely and strict action would be taken against them as per the law.BJD chief Naveen Patnaik also expressed concern over the situation, saying Odisha has a reputation as a peace-loving state.Meanwhile, the VHP has announced a 12-hour bandh in Cuttack on Monday to protest the clash during the Durga immersion procession.The original clashes broke out around 1.30 am to 2 am on Saturday near Haathi Pokhari in Dargah Bazar as the immersion procession moved towards Debigara on the Kathajodi river banks. Officials said the violence started after locals objected to high-decibel music. The confrontation escalated when a mob began pelting stones and glass bottles from rooftops, injuring several revellers, including Cuttack DCP Khilari Rishikesh Dnyandeo. Police said six people were arrested.",The vishwa hindu parishad (vhp) organised a motorcycle rally on sunday evening despite orders from the district administration.

NEW DELHI: Amid the controversy over deaths of children in parts of Madhya Pradesh, allegedly due to consumption of sub-standard cough syrup, Union health secretary Punya Salila Srivastava on Sunday asked states/UTs to ensure strict compliance with Revised Schedule M – updated Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) — by all drug manufacturers.Srivastava, at a meeting with top health officials from all states/UTs, which was also attended by the chief of Indian Council for Medical Research and Drug Controller General of India (DCGI), directed rational use of cough syrups, particularly for children, as most coughs are self-limiting and do not require pharmacological treatment.Health ministry sources said the matter had been earlier reviewed by Union health minister J P Nadda, who had directed that the matter be discussed with states/UTs to ensure necessary action.Metropolitan Surveillance Unit (MSU), Nagpur, established under Pradhan Mantri-Ayushman Bharat Health Infrastructure Mission (PM-ABHIM), had reported a cluster of cases and related deaths from a block in Chhindwara district of Madhya Pradesh a few days ago.The samples of 19 medicines which had been consumed by the children were collected from treating private practitioners and nearby retail stores. Health ministry said chemical analysis so far indicates that nine out of 10 samples meet quality standards.However, one of them, viz cough syrup ‘Coldrif’, contained Diethylene Glycol — contaminant known to cause serious kidney injury if used in higher proportions — beyond the permissible limit.“Cancellation of manufacturing licence of the unit that supplied the specific batch of the drug has been recommended by CDSCO based on inspection findings. Criminal proceedings have also been initiated,” the ministry said.DCGI Dr Rajeev Raghuvanshi reiterated the need for drug manufacturing units to strictly comply with Revised Schedule M for Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP).He noted that certain firms which had applied for the government’s infrastructure upgrade have been given an extension till December.","Health ministry sources said the matter had been earlier reviewed by union health minister j p nadda.

An iron bridge connecting Siliguri with the Mirik-Darjeeling route was damaged, further isolating the region.The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued a red alert for sub-Himalayan West Bengal, including Darjeeling and Kalimpong, warning of further landslides and road disruptions due to saturated soils.Continuous rain and slippery slopes are hampering rescue operations. Disaster teams are finding it difficult to reach affected areas, while local NGOs and district administration work to provide relief to displaced families.","At least 20 people, including children, killed and scores injured as relentless downpours triggered massive landslides across the mirik and darjeeling hills. Homes were swept away, roads severed, and hundreds of tourists stranded. The national disaster response force (ndrf) and district authorities are coordinating rescue operations in the worst-hit areas.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124322641,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-4562178,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
