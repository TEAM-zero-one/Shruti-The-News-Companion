NEW DELHI: The Centre has tasked a high-powered committee with reviewing and restructuring Association of Indian Universities (AIU) to align its mandate with National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 and the proposed reforms under the Higher Education Commission of India (HECI).The move comes amid efforts to streamline governance of higher education, enhance institutional autonomy, and establish a globally competitive ecosystem for Indian universities, reports Manash Gohain.The committee will submit its report within six months, during which AIU has been advised to maintain status quo.The committee, chaired by Anil Sahasrabudhe, head of National Educational Technology Forum, is expected to examine AIU's role in the evolving regulatory landscape and suggest how it can support universities as they transition to HECI's unified framework. Its members include V Kamakoti, director, IIT-Madras; Nageshwar Rao, former VC, IGNOU; Shashikala Wanjari, VC, NIEPA; S Vidhyasubramaniam, VC, Sastra; and Pankaj Mittal, secretary general, AIU.AIU, founded in 1925, has for long coordinated functioning of universities, evaluated foreign degrees, and promoted sports and cultural initiatives.However, with NE envisioning a single regulator for higher education through HECI, AIU's operational structure and functions are being reassessed.""The committee will examine operational issues and AIU's future role, including whether it should come under HECI,"" a member told TOI. ""AIU's robust institutional network could be leveraged for global engagement and recognition of qualifications under the new system.""The restructuring also follows University Grants Commission 's notification of the Recognition and Grant of Equivalence to Qualifications Obtained from Foreign Educational Institutions Regulations, 2025. The framework seeks to establish a standardised and transparent process for recognising foreign academic degrees in India, bolstering the government's ""Study in India"" initiative.","The centre has tasked a high-powered committee with reviewing and restructuring association of indian universities.

Radhika Yadav, the 25-year-old former state-level tennis player who was allegedly shot dead by her father in Gurugram, did not run a formal academy, rather trained aspiring players by booking tennis courts across the city.“Radhika did not have her own academy. She used to train aspirants by booking tennis courts at different places. Deepak had asked her several times to stop the training sessions, but she refused. That was the main tussle between the father and daughter,” said an investigating officer, quoted by PTI.Police had earlier claimed that Radhika ran a tennis academy, a source of tension between her and Deepak, who was reportedly taunted for relying on his daughter’s income.According to police, Deepak, who had steady rental income and was financially secure, felt uncomfortable being perceived as reliant on his daughter's earnings. This had reportedly left him depressed in the weeks leading up to the shooting.Initial speculation tied Radhika’s social media activity and a 2023 music video appearance to her murder. Allegations surfaced that Deepak was displeased with her rising online presence and ambitions of becoming an influencer, with some suggesting the video featuring her alongside an independent artist may have been the cause behind the murder.However, these claims were later dismissed by the police.“The video was uploaded in 2023, it has no connection with the murder. The accused has repeatedly said that he did not want his daughter to earn through training,” inspector Vinod Kumar of Sector 56 police station told PTI.Radhika, was killed at point-blank range on Thursday by her father Deepak Yadav, 49, at their double-storey residence in sector 57. He was arrested and produced before a city court, which sent him to judicial custody on Saturday.Deepak also confessed to shooting his daughter dead, police said.On Friday, the court had sent Deepak to one-day police custody. During the remand period, officers recovered five bullets and a live cartridge from the family's sector 57 residence. He was also taken to a village in Pataudi as part of the investigation.A relative told police that Deepak had supported Radhika's tennis ambitions from a young age, but had grown increasingly upset with her continued coaching work despite his objections.Radhika suffered four gunshot wounds, three to the back and one to the shoulder, according to the post-mortem. Her funeral was held on Friday in the family’s native village of Wazirabad.","Radhika yadav, 25, was allegedly shot dead by her father in gurugram on thursday.

KOLKATA: A 24-year-old woman psychologist accused a student of one of India's top management institutes in Kolkata of raping her in his hostel room Friday, prompting police action and his arrest. But the case took a turn less than 12 hours later, when her father publicly denied that any crime had occurred and alleged police coercion.Paramanand Toppannawar, a second-year student and Karnataka native, was picked up from his hostel on Saturday. He was produced in court and remanded in seven-day police custody under BNS sections related to rape, wrongful confinement, & use of harmful substances with intent to harm.The woman first connected with Toppannawar online. He invited her to the campus for a 'personal counselling session'. She claimed she was not permitted to enter her name in the visitors' log - a claim that institute officials dispute. Toppannawar allegedly took her to his hostel room, citing privacy. There, he offered her pizza and a drink.""I began feeling dizzy right after,"" she wrote in the complaint, quoted by police.""...I can recall him touching me inappropriately. He sexually assaulted me. I found myself on his bed when I regained my senses,"" the survivor wrote in her complaint.However, by Saturday morning, her father gave interviews to multiple TV channels, contradicting the allegation. ""My daughter had called me and said she had fallen off an autorickshaw. Cops said she was abused and arrested someone, but my daughter said nothing happened.""Police now face a wall of silence from the family.

NEW DELHI: A Russian woman, whose visa expired in 2017, was found and rescued from a secluded cave in the Ramatirtha hills of Kumta taluk, Uttara Kannada district in Karnataka , with her two young children.The 40-year-old Russian national, Nina Kutina, also known as Mohi, who came to India on a business visa and found her way to the sacred coastal town of Gokarna via Goa, was deeply drawn to Hinduism and Indian spiritual traditions, PTI reported.She had been residing in the cave for approximately two weeks with her children, Preya (6) and Ama (4), completely isolated from civilisation.The family had established a basic living space within a natural cave, situated amidst dense forest and challenging terrain.Inside the cave, Mohi maintained a Rudra idol and devoted her time to 'Puja' and meditation, while caring for her children in their isolated dwelling.On Friday, during a standard patrol following a landslide incident, Circle Police Inspector Sridhar's team noticed clothing displayed outside the cave entrance.The officers navigated through the dense vegetation of Ramatirtha Hill to discover Mohi and her children inhabiting the cave.Uttara Kannada Superintendent of Police M Narayana told PTI on Saturday, ""Our patrolling team spotted saree and other clothes being hung for drying outside the cave in Ramatirtha Hill. When they went there, they spotted Mohi along with her children Preya and Ama.""He noted, ""It was quite surprising how she and her children survived in the woods and what they ate. Thankfully, nothing untoward happened to her or the children during their time in the forest.""Officials believe she reached the cave location from Goa.Investigations revealed her visa had lapsed in 2017, with uncertainty surrounding her total duration of stay in India.Narayana stated, ""We have arranged her stay in an ashram, run by a Sadhvi. We have initiated the process to take her to Bengaluru from Gokarna and begin the deportation process.""The authorities have contacted the Russian Embassy through a local NGO to commence deportation procedures.","Nina kutina, also known as mohi, rescued from cave in uttara kannada district.

NEW DELHI: Moments after allegedly shooting his daughter four times, Deepak Yadav called his elder brother and said something that would shake their family forever. “Bhai, maine kanya vadh kar diya hai. Mujhe maar do (),” Vijay Yadav recalled. “He said the same thing at the police station too – hang me. He didn’t reveal a reason. He said he had lost his mind.”Radhika Yadav, a 25-year-old former tennis player from Gurugram, was shot dead at point-blank range by her father on July 11 at their Sector 57 residence. Her post-mortem confirmed four bullet wounds – three in the back and one in the shoulder. The crime stemmed from disagreements over her tennis coaching sessions and a growing desire to pursue a career outside sports, including in advertising and modelling, her uncle told ANI.Vijay Yadav described Deepak as a devoted father who had invested years of effort and money into Radhika’s tennis career. “He used to take her for training at 5 in the morning and bring her back in the evening. She had stopped going anywhere else.He had worked hard. When everyone in the village had kutcha houses, they had a pucca one,” he told ANI. “There is no bigger punishment than realisation when a person himself is guilty. ”The family has denied reports that Radhika owned a tennis academy. According to the Gurugram police, she used to book tennis courts at various locations to train others, something her father objected to. An investigating officer said Deepak was worried about societal judgement and did not want his daughter to earn money by coaching others.A friend of the accused also told police that Deepak had been deeply disturbed by comments people made about him living off his daughter’s earnings. He claimed Deepak told him he had “committed a sin” and couldn’t take the taunts any longer.WhatsApp chats between Radhika and her coach suggest she had been planning to leave home and move abroad, ANI reported. However, police say this angle is not being probed. Inspector Vinod Kumar confirmed there was no link between a music video Radhika had appeared in and the murder. “The accused has repeatedly said that he did not want his daughter to earn through training other players,” he said.The accused has been sent to 14 days’ judicial custody.","Radhika yadav, a 25-year-old former tennis player from gurugram, was shot dead at point-blank range.

CHENNAI: There's no age limit for learning - some senior citizens in Tamil Nadu seem to have discovered this mantra. Three people aged 68, 67 and 60, including two lawyers, have cleared NEET this year and applied for MBBS admissions in Tamil Nadu. But, their sudden passion for a tough and demanding branch of study like medicine has left TN officials in a fix.State selection committee officials said there are at least 25 people, above the age of 35 years, competing for UG medical and dental courses. There's no upper age limit to appear for NEET as NMC had removed the bar on age or number of attempts for the qualifying examination.""This year, there are many graduates and professionals aspiring for a medical or dental seat. This is the highest number of middle-age and older applicants we have seen since 2017,"" said an official.Some candidates have obtained enough marks that could secure them a seat under the 69% reservation category and permit them to study medicine at a subsidised cost at a government college or free of cost at a private college.All three senior citizens applied for admission under a special quota, where 7.5% of seats are reserved for students from government schools to pursue medicine in government or private colleges free of cost.While the older candidates have the qualifying marks, officials are seeing technical problems - in many cases, documents are not matching the requirements mentioned in the prospectus, an official said.The core debate among officials is whether this special quota should extend to all graduates, regardless of age.","Three people aged 68, 67 and 60 have cleared neet and applied for mbbs admissions in tamil nadu.

Judge seeks 'reasonable care' while invoking BNS' stringent Sec 152

PRAYAGRAJ: Allahabad high court has observed that merely expressing support for Pakistan without referencing any specific incident or mentioning India does not prima facie constitute an offence under Section 152 (act endangering sovereignty or unity and integrity of India) of Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS).Allowing the bail plea of Riyaz, accused of pledging support to Pakistan in an Instagram post, Justice Arun Kumar Singh Deshwal said a perusal of record showed ""the applicant has not mentioned anything which shows disrespect towards our country"".""Merely posting a message to...show support for any country may create anger or disharmony among citizens of India"", and may be punishable under Sec 196 of BNS (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language etc), but ""definitively will not attract"" Sec 152, the HC said in its July 10 order.Sec 196 of BNS provides for up to seven years in jail, while an offence under Sec 152 is non-bailable and carries a life sentence or imprisonment up to seven years and fine. The judge called for exercising ""reasonable care"" while invoking Sec 152 of BNS, saying it was a new provision stipulating stringent punishment, which had no equivalence in IPC.""For attracting ingredients of Sec 152, there must be purpose by spoken or written words, signs, visible representations, electronic communication to promote secession, armed rebellion, subversive activities or encourages feeling of separating activities or endangers the sovereignty, unity and integrity of India,"" HC said.""Merely posting a message to show support for any country may create anger or disharmony among citizens of India"", and may be punishable under Sec 196 of BNS (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language etc), which provides for up to seven years jail, but ""definitively will not attract ingredients of Sec 152, BNS"", HC said in its order July 10.Justice Deshwal said spoken words or posts on social media are also covered under the right to freedom of speech and expression, and should not be narrowly interpreted, unless they are of such nature which threaten the country's sovereignty and integrity or encourages separatism.During the hearing, the applicant submitted through his counsel that his social media post did not lower the dignity and sovereignty of the country. Neither was India named, nor the Indian flag or any photo was posted which showed disrespect to the country, he argued. ""Merely supporting a country, even if that country is an enemy to India, does not attract the ingredients of BNS Sec 152,"" the applicant's counsel said.State opposed the bail plea, submitting that such posts encourages separatism. HC, granting bail, directed applicant not to post any material on social media which could create disharmony among people.","Allahabad high court observed that merely expressing support for pakistan does not prima facie constitute an offence.

SRINAGAR: Bengal BJP leader of opposition Suvendu Adhikari’s comments advising Bengal’s people not to travel to Kashmir have drawn fire in J&K, with his own party repudiating the statement and the governing National Conference (NC) equating it with “terrorism”.“Kashmir is the crown of India, an integral part of our motherland. Every Indian holds Kashmir close to his heart,” former J&K BJP chief Ravinder Raina said in a video message where she asked Adhikari to visit the Valley and witness firsthand the “patriotism of Kashmiris”.Adhikari had advised Bengal’s people against going to places “where Muslims are in a majority”. “If you want to visit Kashmir, visit Jammu.” Referring to the Pahalgam terror attack, Adhikari said tourists were “selectively killed” and advised people to visit Himachal Pradesh or Uttarakhand instead.Raina contested Adhikari’s version of events. “After the Pahalgam terror attack, it was local Kashmiris who rescued the wounded and later sheltered tourists to ensure their safety. Thousands of Kashmiris have laid down their lives for the nation’s unity and security. Many of our own BJP workers from Kashmir were killed by terrorists. Countless Kashmiri policemen and security personnel have been martyred defending the country.If the Tricolour flies proudly in Kashmir today, it is because of the sacrifices and patriotism of Kashmiris,” Raina said.Adhikari’s comments came after a meeting between J&K CM Omar Abdullah and Bengal’s Mamata Banerjee in Kolkata on Thursday. After the talks, Mamata had appealed to the people of her state to travel to Kashmir and support its tourism. She also accepted Omar’s invitation to visit the Valley, promising to do so after Durga Puja in Sept.Mamata’s TMC has slammed Adhikari’s comments, accusing him of indulging in a “disgraceful, calculated act of communal provocation” and “pushing the message of terrorists at home”.On Saturday, Omar’s NC echoed the condemnation. NC spokesperson Tanvir Sadiq said he did not find “any difference between him (Suvendu) and terrorists” and pointed out that the statement was contrary to efforts by the Centre and J&K govt to revive tourism. “Terrorists also wanted that no one should visit Kashmir and this person (Adhikari) is saying the same. If you want to condemn the Pahalgam terror attack, you must visit Kashmir,” Sadiq added.",Bengal bjp leader of opposition suvendu adhikari advised bengal’s people not to travel to kashmir.

SRINAGAR: J&K police has announced that no one will be allowed to visit the graveyard of “July 13 Martyrs” in Srinagar on Sunday, extending curbs that have been in place since the 2019 abrogation of Article 370. The date is significant in Kashmir’s history as 22 people were killed during an uprising against Dogra ruler Maharaja Hari Singh in 1931.Chief minister Omar Abdullah , his father and governing National Conference (NC) president Farooq Abdullah, and former CM Mehbooba Mufti were expected to visit Mazar-e-Shuhada, the martyrs’ resting place in Srinagar’s Naqshband Sahib and pay floral tributes. Authorities have already placed Hurriyat Conference chairman Mirwaiz Umar Farooq under house arrest.The Omar-led govt does not control police or security, whose reins are in the hands of the Centre-appointed lieutenant governor (LG) Manoj Sinha.“District administration Srinagar has denied permission to all applicants intending to proceed towards Nowhatta on 13th July, 2025 (Sunday). The general public is advised to strictly comply with these instructions. Any violation shall invite strict legal action,” J&K police said in a statement late Saturday evening.NC reacted sharply to the curbs, with spokesperson Tanvir Sadiq calling them “deeply unfortunate and fundamentally unjust” on a day of profound historical and emotional significance for people of J&K. “We urge the administration to reflect on the gravity of this decision. No order can suppress memory. No restriction can erase the truth. The people of Kashmir will continue to honour their martyrs peacefully, with dignity, and with unwavering resolve,” Sadiq said.NC had written to Srinagar’s deputy commissioner on Thursday, seeking permission for Farooq’s intended visit to the site. Apni Party had made a similar request.Fearing they would be restricted from leaving home on Sunday, PDP functionary and ex-CM Mehbooba’s daughter Iltija Mufti visited the graveyard on Saturday. “I paid tributes to our martyrs who laid down their lives for democracy. Their memory is being wilfully erased. Yet their voices echo in every Kashmiri’s heart,” Iltija said.In January 2020, nearly six months after the abrogation of Article 370, UT authorities had dropped July 13 and December 5 from the list of public holidays in J&K. December 5 was observed as the birth anniversary of NC founder Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah.Since then, the authorities have barred official functions on July 13 at Mazar-e-Shuhada, detaining politicians, including former chief ministers, if necessary, to keep them away. Earlier, it was tradition for CMs and top officials to pay tributes and offer a guard of honour at the graveyard.While such restrictions had been clamped in the past few years, many had believed this year might be different as it was the first time since the revocation of J&K’s special status under Article 370 that an elected government was in place in the Union territory.

Chirag vows to contest all 243 seats in Bihar

NEW DELHI: Union minister and Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) chief Chirag Paswan on Saturday lashed out at Bihar’s law and order situation, calling it “beyond understanding”. Chirag’s comments are the latest in a series of messages directed at the Nitish government since he announced his decision to contest the Bihar polls scheduled for later this year.“How many Biharis will be murdered? It is beyond understanding what is the responsibility of Bihar Police?” the Hajipur MP wrote on X, hours after the killing of Sushila Devi, a 60-year-old hospital worker shot dead in Nalanda on Saturday morning.Police said she was ambushed while returning from her farm, shot in the head, and declared dead at a local hospital. Officers suspect a property dispute but are still investigating.The incident is the latest in a string of high-profile killings across Bihar. A 50-year-old sand mining businessman was shot dead in Patna on Thursday, just days after top industrialist Gopal Khemka was murdered near his home despite earlier appeals for police protection. On Friday, another businessman, Vikram Jha, was gunned down outside his shop in Patna. “There seems to be no evidence of robbery,” Patna East SP Parichay Kumar said, adding that the motive remains unclear.Deputy CM Vijay Kumar Sinha had blamed “sand, liquor and land mafias” linked to the opposition RJD for the violence in the state. RJD’s Tejashwi Yadav, however, held the Nitish government accountable. “Why is the unconscious Chief Minister silent?” he posted on X.This is the second time in a week that Chirag has criticised the law and order situation in Bihar, with the LJP MP on Monday describing it as “completely collapsed.”“In Biharsharif, Nalanda, criminals brutally murdered 16-year-old Himanshu Paswan and 20-year-old Anu Kumar by shooting them. This incident is extremely unfortunate and condemnable. This heinous event not only shakes humanity but also shows that law and order in Bihar have completely collapsed,” Chirag had said.“Crime in the state is at its peak, and the fact that such an incident was carried out by criminals in the home district of the Honourable Chief Minister clearly indicates that the morale of criminals is at its highest,” he added.Chirag has declared that his party, the Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas), will contest all 243 assembly seats in Bihar, reaffirming his ‘Bihar First, Bihari First’ vision. Speaking at a rally in Chhapra, the Union minister said he would fight the polls with “full intensity.”His announcement has unsettled allies in the NDA, with JD(U) leaders accusing him of violating coalition dharma.""If Chirag wants to contest the elections on his own, he should declare it publicly. It is not right to say one thing on stage and another off stage. This should not happen. He is a Union minister in the NDA govt and should follow coalition dharma,"" said senior JD(U) leader and state IPRD minister Maheshwar Hazar on Friday.Also read: 'Chirag should clarify stand on fighting polls,' says JD(U) minister","Union minister and lok janshakti party (ram vilas) chief chirag paswan lashed out at bihar’s law and order situation, calling it “beyond understanding” his comments are the latest in a series of messages directed at the nitish government since he announced his decision to contest the bihar polls scheduled for later this year.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122409153,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1228771,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
