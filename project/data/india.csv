Why solar-powered prosperity in Thar desert is a mixed blessing,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/why-solar-powered-prosperity-in-thar-desert-is-a-mixed-blessing/articleshow/124731664.cms,"Rajasthan’s Thar desert is glowing with solar panels, powering India’s clean energy dreams. But behind the boom lies a quieter story that goes unsaid — of vanishing camels, felled khejri trees, and fading pastoral life

Solar rush, sore communities

Fight for land and beyond

Economy’s leap, ecology’s slide

Oil, cement, solar, rising incomes

Balancing sun and sand

The Thar desert is dancing, but not to the tune it once knew. Ever since Barmer struck oil in 2004, the desert was catapulted from obscurity to the frontline of India’s energy story. Solar fields — in neat military lines — sprawl where flocks once grazed, and a Rs 80,000-crore crude refinery waits in the wings. Jaisalmer, once a sepiatinted tourist postcard of camels and its famous fort, is adding cement to its desert identity. Prosperity has found a new postcode, dragging people from the margins to the mainstream.Yet, beneath the sheen of progress, another story simmers: of cultural identity of its people and centuries-old pastoral traditions fading, camels and sheep disappearing, vital khejri trees falling to the axe, and the fragile biodiversity fraying. The region is at a crossroads, caught between progress and preservation, megawatts and memories.In Jodhpur’s Bhadla panchayat, Sadar Khan recalls when the 25,000 acres of govt land around his village were still pasturelands — grazing grounds for sheep, goats and cows. That changed in 2014, when the govt carved out 14,000 acres for a mega solar park. “I had 250 animals once. With no pastures left, I had to sell. The few I keep now are only to remember who we were,” he says, pointing out to the blue sea of solar panels that occupy the horizon.But the development has been lopsided, says Khan. “The park brought in investment of about Rs 10,000 crore, but we do not have a doctor, nor a school offering classes beyond class 8,” he says.Solar plants have also mushroomed across Jaisalmer, Bikaner and Barmer. For investors, it’s a dream run: secure a power purchase agreement (PPA) for 25 years, instal panels, and enjoy stable returns without much operational hassle. For villagers, it has meant leasing out one-crop or unproductive land for Rs 30,000 an acre, annually. But there are hidden costs. Lakhs of khejri trees were felled, ponds and sacred groves levelled, and grazing lands erased.For men like Sumer Singh Bhati and his community of herders and farmers, this is not just land, it is also identity. Supported by thousands from Jaisalmer, Barmer, and Bikaner, Bhati has rallied against the large-scale diversion of pastureland and sacred groves — “orans”, in local parlance. “We are not against development, but against the erasure of our ecosystem and culture,” Bhati says. On Sept 26, nearly 15,000 villagers marched in protest, with a sit-in at the Jaisalmer collectorate. The struggle is about ‘ jeevika ’ (livelihood) and ‘ pehchaan ’ (identity), Bhati says. The protest was called off on Oct 19 after the govt assured the protesters that 8,000 acres of community forest land would be notified and safeguarded from destruction, with no allocation for solar or cement projects. However, Bhati said they had also submitted a separate proposal seeking protection for an additional 80,000 acres of community forests, which remains pending at the collectorate level. “We will resume our protest if the 8,000 acres are not formally declared as a protected area,” he said.The desert economy once revolved around livestock — camels, cattle and sheep. But their numbers are dwindling rapidly. The 2019 livestock census showed a 13% fall in sheep and a 35% decline in camels. Professor Anil Kumar Chhangani of Bikaner’s Maharaja Ganga Singh University warned the numbers today would be far worse. “If the census were to be conducted today, the numbers could be appalling. Besides the rapidly falling animal population, about 25 lakh khejri, ker, kumta, jal and rohida trees — central to the Thar desert’s biodiversity — have been felled,” Chhangani claims.The last known census of khejri trees ( Prosopis cineraria ), Rajasthan’s state tree, was conducted by the Central Arid Zone Research Institute in 2015. This study across 12 dry districts, such as Jodhpur and Nagaur, found the density had fallen to fewer than 35 trees per hectare from about 90 in the 1950s and 60s. The institute attributed the decline to groundwater overuse, fungal attacks, and land development.Recently, Bikaner’s master plan has proposed to convert 27,000 bighas (625 acres) of pastureland into commercial and residential use. “Pastures are oxygen for animals, birds, reptiles, and people. Sacrificing them is ecological suicide,” Chhangani cautions.Barmer was once dreaded as a ‘Kala Pani’ posting for officials. Today, oil and thermal power have turned it into an emerging economic frontier.Its per capita income — Rs 1.5 lakh per annum in 2023-24 — doubled in the past five years, nearing the state average of Rs 1.7 lakh. Jaisalmer, Bikaner and Jodhpur, too, boast incomes above the state average. Besides being home to large-scale solar and wind farms, Jaisalmer has recently attracted investment of Rs 18,000 crore in the cement sector, spanning seven plants. In Pachpadra, a Rs 80,000-crore refinery is set to start commercial operation, promising to change the region’s future forever. With 40GW (1 gigawatt = 1,000MW) of solar plants already installed and another 50GW planned, much of it in the desert region, Thar’s development is reaching for the skies, promising more prosperity.Rajasthan accounts for India’s largest solar power capacity, at 20%. It is critical to the country’s global climate commitments, and the target of 500GW by 2030. But the question is not whether solar is important, it is about saving the desert’s soul: its trees, animals, and the pastoral life it is proud of.Chief minister Bhajan Lal Sharma promises to plant 10 saplings for every khejri tree that is felled. But people like Bhati and Khan dismiss it as tokenism. Replanting cannot replace centuries-old groves or restore lost pastures, they say.","Rajasthan's thar desert is glowing with solar panels, powering india's clean energy dreams.

"‘Harappan site’s trade infrastructure predates Silk Route by 2,000 years’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/harappan-sites-trade-infrastructure-predates-silk-route-by-2000-yrs/articleshow/124731242.cms,"PUNE: Bronze Age traders crossing Gujarat stopped at well-organised roadside facilities that offered shelter, food, security and stables for their pack animals.A new multidisciplinary study by Pune-based Deccan College Post-Graduate and Research Institute, Symbiosis School for Liberal Arts, and Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), New Delhi, published in L’Anthropologie (Elsevier, 2025), has identified a 4,000-year-old Harappan settlement at Kotada Bhadli in Kutch as the earliest known caravanserai — a fortified rural stopover that supported long-distance trade between 2300 and 1900 BCE. The findings now push back the origins of organised trade infrastructure in the subcontinent by over 2,000 years.Lead researcher Prabodh Shirvalkar from Deccan College told TOI: “This is the first confirmed archaeological evidence of a caravanserai in the Harappan world — a type of infrastructure previously known only from later historical periods.”Excavated between 2010 and 2013 in collaboration with Gujarat State Archaeology Department, the site has now been reinterpreted using advanced techniques— including ground penetrating radar, magnetic and satellite surveys, isotopic and lipid analyses, and three forms of dating, Shirvalkar added.Researchers, including Esha Prasad and Yadubirsingh Rawat, said the finding bridges a key missing link in the trade mechanism of the Indus Valley Civilization, revealing how long-distance overland trade was supported by an organised system of rest stops and logistical hubs — a structure previously thought to have emerged only in the early historic or medieval periods.While the existence of Harappan trade with Mesopotamia and inland India is well-established, the mechanism of how merchants, animals and goods actually moved across land remained unclear.The new study proposes that Harappan commerce depended on a network of small fortified stopovers, strategically placed along trade routes between urban centres like Dholavira, Lothal and Shikarpur in Gujarat.Earlier excavations revealed a multi-roomed central building, fortified walls with bastions, and large open spaces that were likely used to hold animals and goods — all consistent with a caravanserai’s layout.Shirvalkar added that the site was small, strategically placed and fortified, but non-urban — designed for short halts rather than permanent residence. By identifying caravanserai-like traits — fortification, animal pens, open spaces, food waste and imported goods — the paper said that Harappans maintained an organised trade infrastructure two millennia before the Silk Route “The Harappan economy was not just about city markets and ports like Dholavira or Lothal. It had a logistical backbone. Caravanserais that sustained traders on long inland routes,” Shirvalkar said.","Bronze age traders stopped at well-organised roadside facilities that offered shelter, food, security and stables for their pack animals.

Poll Do you think using green firecrackers will help reduce air pollution during Diwali? Yes, absolutely No, it's ineffective

(With agency inputs)

NEW DELHI: As residents across the national capital celebrated Diwali with fireworks on Monday night, Delhi's air quality took a sharp hit, with the majority of monitoring stations entering the 'red zone'.Although the Supreme Court had permitted the use of green firecrackers between 8 pm and 10 pm on the festival day, celebrations continued well beyond the allotted hours.Data showed that 36 out of 38 monitoring stations recorded pollution levels in the 'red zone', indicating 'very poor' to 'severe' air quality across the city.Morning visuals on Tuesday reveal Akshardham, partially obscured by haze. Stage II (GRAP-2) measures are in effect across Delhi-NCR.By 10 pm, Delhi’s overall air quality index (AQI) was classified as 'very poor' at 344, with four stations reporting 'severe' levels above 400. According to the SAMEER app developed by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the worst-hit areas were Dwarka (417), Ashok Vihar (404), Wazirpur (423), and Anand Vihar (404).The city’s 24-hour average AQI, reported daily at 4 pm, also remained in the 'very poor' category at 345, higher than Sunday’s 326, according to official data.In the afternoon, 31 stations recorded 'very poor' air quality, while three fell under the 'severe' zone.Authorities warned that air quality is likely to deteriorate further, slipping into the 'severe' category more broadly on Tuesday and Wednesday.The CPCB categorises AQI between 0 and 50 as 'good', 51 and 100 as 'satisfactory', 101 to 200 as 'moderate', 201 to 300 as 'poor', 301 to 400 as 'very poor', and 401 to 500 as 'severe.'Transport emissions contributed 15.6 per cent to Delhi's pollution on Monday, while other sources, including industries, accounted for 23.3 per cent, data from the Decision Support System (DSS) showed.On Sunday, the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) invoked Stage II of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) across Delhi-NCR. The decision followed a review by the GRAP sub-committee on Saturday and forecasts from the India Meteorological Department (IMD) and the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM).Earlier, on October 15, the Supreme Court had allowed the sale and bursting of green firecrackers in Delhi-NCR between 6 am and 7 pm, and again from 8 pm to 10 pm on Diwali eve and the day of the festival.Residents of Delhi reported breathing difficulties and eye irritation following a surge in air pollution after Diwali celebrations.Speaking to media, Sagar, a resident of the national capital, held people accountable for the dip in air quality.He said, ""Pollution hasn't just been increasing today; it's been increasing for years. Everyone blames politicians, but the people themselves are like this. People aren't improving themselves. You'll get firecrackers, but it's up to you whether to burst them or not. Then they'll complain that the government isn't doing anything. There are problems in breathing, irritation in eyes.""Ashish Ranjan, a local who came to Kartavya Path for running, also complained about the breathing difficulties. He said, ""There are difficulties in breathing during running time. I cannot breather properly.""","Delhi’s air quality deteriorates sharply to ‘red zone’ as diwali fireworks trigger severe pollution. 36 out of 38 monitoring stations recorded pollution levels in the'red zone', indicating'very poor' to'severe' air quality across the city.

"Delhi air pollution: At peak hours, data goes blank at many stations; experts raise alarm",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/as-pollution-peaks-many-stns-go-blank/articleshow/124727657.cms,"Air pollution in Delhi

NEW DELHI: When the air quality station at RK Puram reached peak PM2.5 levels of 1,476 micrograms per cubic metre around midnight, its real-time hourly data went missing from Delhi Pollution Control Committee's website for five hours. The data was available again from 6am, showing a downward trend at 1,187ug/m3, followed by 1,064ug/m3 at 7am.Experts alleged that several stations of DPCC, Central Pollution Control Board and India Meteorological Department stopped showing hourly data after PM10 and PM2.5 levels were close to crossing the 1,000 mark around midnight. They claimed that due to the data gaps, the 24-hour average readings of some stations were skewed. Most stations saw a spike in pollution levels around midnight.At Nehru Nagar, the most polluted station on the Diwali night, the highest hourly PM2.5 concentration was 1,763ug/m3 at 10pm. However, the hourly data for 11pm is unavailable. The station also recorded data gaps from 1am to 5am.Similarly, CPCB's ITO station recorded hourly PM2.5 levels of 923ug/m3 at 1am on Tuesday and 967 at 7am. However, the data is missing for six hours in between.At NSIT Dwarka station of CPCB, PM10 readings were unavailable from 12am to 5am. At 6am, PM10 levels touched 817ug/m3, but data was again unavailable for three hours during the day.Things were no different at IMD's Ayanagar, where hourly PM10 data was missing for five hours while PM2.5 levels were unavailable from 2am to 4am.Sunil Dahiya, founder and lead analyst of think tank EnviroCatalysts, said many stations blanked out on Monday night. This is not an issue with stations run by one monitoring agency; all four agencies, IITM, IMD, DPCC and CPCB, faced this issue, he pointed out.""The observed pattern shows that most stations stopped providing data when they approached 1,000ug/m3 while there were stations such as Anand Vihar, Nehru Nagar, Mundka, etc. that recorded values above 1,000ug/m3, indicating that the technology of monitoring isn't an issue, at least in terms of being available. This is not the first time that the stations have stopped providing data; we have observed this over the past years too,"" said Dahiya.He added that if some stations couldn't monitor beyond a certain limit, these stations should be upgraded to the similar technology as Anand Vihar and Nehru Nagar. If the issue was manual, it should be investigated and shouldn't be repeated in the future. ""Such missing data hampers data-driven insights, understanding the contribution of certain activities, their impact on health as well as skews the daily pollution level recordings, giving a false sense of lower air pollution levels,"" Dahiya emphasised.Activist Bhavreen Kandhari said data gaps during high pollution hours meant ""we are losing sight exactly when it matters most"". She pointed out, ""Transparency in air quality monitoring must be treated as a public health imperative, not an option.""Environment minister Manjinder Singh Sirsa, however, claimed, ""All data is available on CPCB and DPCC, there is no missing data. You have to check."" Hinting at AAP, which also raised the issue, he said, ""Those who are saying there is missing data, you know what their intentions are.""CPCB, DPCC, Commission for Air Quality Management and IMD did not reply to TOI's queries on missing data.","Air quality station at rk puram reached peak pm2.5 levels of 1,476 micrograms per cubic metre around midnight.

Poll Do you think the political situation in Bihar will improve before the elections? Yes, there's potential for improvement No, it will likely worsen

Dissent rules, both in INDIA bloc and NDA



PATNA: Just a fortnight before the first phase of polling in Bihar, partners in the INDIA bloc, which seemed to be in a disarray till Sunday, appeared going into the damage-control mode on Monday with some withdrawing candidates against each other on certain seats. RJD announced its list of 143 candidates, leaving the remaining 100 for its allies. It dropped 31 MLAs and nominated new candidates. Congress has fielded candidates for 61 seats, while the Left comprising the CPI-ML, CPI and CPM announced its list of 30. On the other hand, the VIP led by former minister Mukesh Sahani has come up with its list of 15 candidates, which means the INDIA bloc partners still have some friendly contests on at least six seats.Opposition bloc leaders said they were hoping the clouds of uncertainty would clear by Oct 23, the last date of withdrawal of candidature for the second phase.Significantly, JMM withdrew from the Bihar contest after a stalemate over their seat-sharing deal with INDIA bloc. “Unfortunately, JMM won’t be part of the Bihar polls despite my intentions and plans. This is only because of RJD’s ‘political’ immaturity. Congress should have mediated to accommodate JMM, but we are sorry to say that it too did nothing,” said senior JMM legislator and state urban development minister Sudivya Kumar.There was consensus in INDIA bloc over the CM face till Monday night. Despite RJD being the largest bloc with 143 seats to its share, Congress has so far refrained from announcing Tejashwi Yadav as the CM face although he is the coordination committee chairman. Also, INDIA bloc members have not come together in a show of unity for a long time and have been speaking through the media only, adding to confusion in the opposition bloc.In seat-sharing, things looked moving in some direction when RJD didn’t announce its candidate from Kutumba seat against Congress candidate and party’s state chief Rajesh Kumar. RJD had earlier announced it would field its candidate from this seat after the conflict intensified between the two partners, in alliance for the past 35 years.On the other hand, Congress candidate Aditya Kumar withdrew his nomination from Lalganj seat on Monday, in a relief to RJD nominee. RJD had fielded Shivani Shukla, daughter of jailed strongman Munna Shukla, from this seat.In another development, VIP candidate Sakaldeo Bind withdrew his candidature from Tarapur seat in favour of RJD candidate. A visibly annoyed Bind soon resigned from the party and lent his support to BJP candidate and deputy CM Samrat Choudhary, a VIP spokesperson said.“Things are moving in the right direction and the situation will be more clear by Oct 23, the last date for withdrawal of candidature,” Congress legislature party leader Shakeel Ahmad Khan said on Monday. However, another bloc partner CPI haven’t withdrawn candidates against Congress in three seats.Initially, JMM announced to go solo after seat talks failed but suddenly on Monday urban development minister Sudivya Kumar said, “JMM won’t be part of the Bihar polls.” Kumar said, “Hemant Sorenji and JMM has always been following coalition dharma. Even when RJD had one MLA in 2019, we gave them seat in cabinet. Again now, we accommodated them. But what we got is deceit,” he said.Purnia MP Pappu Yadav, who earlier merged his party with Congress, asked the latter to break alliance with RJD on Monday, blaming the latter for not following “coalition dharma”.Things don’t look good in the rival NDA as well as former Union minister and BJP leader Raj Kumar Singh launched sharp attacks on his party for giving tickets to persons with criminal antecedents. He appealed to the people not to vote for opposition candidates such as Osama Shahab, son of RJD politician late Mohammad Anant Singh and RJD candidate from Mokama Veena Devi.","Rjd announced its list of 143 candidates, leaving the remaining 100 for its allies.

Poll Do you believe the construction of the Ram Temple has a significant impact on the celebration of Deepavali this year? Yes, it's very impactful No, it doesn’t change much

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday penned a letter to citizens on the occasion of Deepavali , highlighting the festival as a time of energy, enthusiasm, and reflection on the nation’s achievements. In his message, he noted that this is the second Deepavali after the construction of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya and emphasised Lord Shri Ram’s teachings on righteousness and courage in fighting injustice.PM Modi referred to “Operation Sindoor” as a recent example of upholding justice, adding that the festival is particularly special this year as lamps will be lit in many districts, including remote areas, where Naxalism and Maoist terrorism have been eradicated. He praised citizens who have abandoned violence and embraced development, viewing it as a major achievement for the nation.""I extend my heartfelt greetings to all of you on the auspicious occasion of Deepavali, a festival filled with energy and enthusiasm. This is the second Deepavali after the grand construction of the Ram Temple in Ayodhya. Lord Shri Ram teaches us to uphold righteousness and also gives us the courage to fight injustice. We have seen a living example of this a few months ago during Operation Sindoor . During Operation Sindoor, Bharat not only upheld righteousness but also avenged injustice,"" he said.""This Deepavali is particularly special because, for the first time, lamps will be lit in many districts across the country, including remote areas. These are the districts where Naxalism and Maoist terrorism have been eradicated from the root. In recent times, we have seen many individuals abandoning the path of violence and joining the mainstream of development, expressing faith in the Constitution of our country.This is a major achievement for the nation,"" he added.Highlighting recent economic reforms, the Prime Minister mentioned the implementation of lower GST rates during the “GST Bachat Utsav” (Savings Festival), which has helped citizens save thousands of crores of rupees. PM Modi also underlined India’s growing global stature, describing the country as a symbol of stability and sensitivity and projecting it to soon become the world’s third-largest economy.As he highlighted India's reforms, achievements and policies, he added, ""In a world going through multiple crises, Bharat has emerged as a symbol of both stability and sensitivity. We are also on track to become the third-largest economy in the world in the near future.""Calling for collective responsibility, PM Modi urged citizens to adopt Swadeshi products, promote “Ek Bharat, Shreshtha Bharat”, respect all languages, maintain cleanliness, prioritise health, reduce oil consumption, and embrace Yoga. He drew inspiration from Deepavali’s symbolism, saying, “when one lamp lights another, its light doesn’t diminish, but it grows further,” and encouraged spreading harmony, cooperation, and positivity.

Bihar Assembly polls: Congress rushes Ashok Gehlot to Bihar to break seat deadlock with RJD,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/congress-rushes-gehlot-to-bihar-to-break-seat-deadlock-with-rjd/articleshow/124729074.cms,"NEW DELHI: Congress is rushing senior politician Ashok Gehlot to Patna for a meeting with RJD scion Tejashwi Yadav to resolve Bihar assembly election-related issues, ranging from “friendly fights” to manifesto release and campaign plan. Opposition sources said Congress general secretary KC Venugopal held a discussion with Tejashwi, following which Gehlot, state in-charge Krishna Allavaru and RJD will hold talks on Wednesday.The state netas of ‘Mahagathbandhan’ alliance partners are likely to hold a press conference on Thursday to show a picture of unity ahead of launching the poll campaign. The urgency comes amid the disappointment over delayed finalisation of seat sharing in a difficult challenge of Bihar elections against the BJP-JDU combination.The Congress brass is learnt to be frustrated with RJD over the protracted seat-sharing process, with sources claiming that even Congress could not finalise its tickets till late because it did not know the seats that were coming its way. ‘“The process started two months ago,” a senior politician said. Also, Congress insiders are miffed at the way allies have been “treated“ by RJD. There is a regret that JMM has not been accommodated, “which should have been”, with sources pointing out that even VIP of Mukesh Sahani got its share after the intervention by the Congress brass.“The elder partner should have been accommodative of all allies to ensure a better chemistry and optics,” an opposition neta said.The “unaccommodative attitude” is being blamed for allies having fielded candidates against each other in around 10 seats, with Congress and RJD facing off against each other in four seats. However, sources said keen attempts are underway to completely remove or minimise the “friendly fights”.What is seen to have hurt the optics is the absence of a joint release of seat sharing and candidates, which has “undercut” the atmosphere created by a united statewide “Voter Adhikar Yatra” of allies headed by Rahul Gandhi and Tejashwi.Now, the alliance is trying to reinvigorate the partnership by first holding a joint show of state leaders, followed by a joint campaign which will involve Rahul and other senior netas. The issue of announcing a CM candidate is another challenge. Congress netas said only one party, RJD, has a CM candidate, which is good enough as projection.They argue that leaving it unsaid would have fulfilled some “political objectives” but RJD’s insistence has created complications — hinting that the alliance may oblige RJD. “There should be a joint press conference soon by state netas, let’s see what happens there,” a senior neta said.Most minor allies have indicated that they have no reservations about an upfront projection of a chief ministerial candidate in the state.",Ashok gehlot to meet rjd scion tejashwi yadav to resolve bihar election-related issues.

NEW DELHI: RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav once again questioned chief minister Nitish Kumar ’s health and fitness to continue leading the state, sharing a video of him from a recent rally.Posting the clip on X, Tejashwi wrote, “If the chief minister is healthy, then why is he acting like this while reading a written speech?”The footage showed Nitish Kumar attempting to garland BJP candidate Rama Nishad during a rally, only to be stopped by JD(U) MP Sanjay Jha. The chief minister then handed the garland to Nishad, and as she accepted it, he placed it around her neck himself. Turning to Jha in apparent irritation, Nitish remarked, “.”In the same rally, Nitish Kumar had launched a pointed attack on his rival Lalu Prasad Yadav, accusing him of doing “nothing for women” during his tenure and installing his wife, Rabri Devi, as chief minister when he was forced to step down over the fodder scam. “Some people only cared about their own wives or their own families, but we work for the benefit of all people,” Nitish said, while highlighting the state government’s work for women’s empowerment over the past seven years.Also read: From ‘topi’ to tokenism: How Nitish Kumar’s coalition math redefined minority space Tejashwi, meanwhile, used the opportunity to renew his criticism of Nitish’s mental state, a line of attack he has pursued for months.

Does the honourable chief minister appear mentally healthy to you while engaging in such bizarre antics?” He went on to allege that Nitish’s party, which he called the “special pawn of the BJP,” may have “deliberately put him in this state by feeding him prasad or other food items under some pretext. ”With Assembly elections approaching later this year, the RJD leader has sharpened his attacks, suggesting that Nitish’s behaviour raises serious questions about his ability to govern.","Rjd leader tejashwi yadav shares video of nitish kumar at rally.

NEW DELHI: Congress MP Pappu Yadav on Tuesday alleged that the BJP-led NDA is sidelining Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar and not giving him due respect. He added that only the Congress party would stand by Kumar.Speaking to reporters, Pappu commented on the political dynamics within the alliance, claiming that Nitish Kumar would not remain with the NDA after the upcoming elections.“The way BJP and Chirag Paswan have isolated Nitish Kumar to maintain their strike rate, I don't think Nitish Kumar will remain in the NDA after the elections.

Bihar Assembly polls: Fewer Yadav candidates fielded by NDA as it looks to consolidate its core base,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bihar-assembly-polls-fewer-yadav-candidates-fielded-by-nda-as-it-looks-to-consolidate-its-core-base/articleshow/124728763.cms,"Nitish has fielded only 4 Muslims as against 11 in 2020



NEW DELHI: A push for social engineering in search of additional votes appears to have given way to the governing NDA focusing on consolidation of its traditional support base for the Bihar assembly polls. This turn is most telling in the significant cut in the number of Yadav candidates fielded by its two biggest constituents, BJP and JD(U).BJP has fielded only six Yadavs this time, as against 16 in 2020, while chief minister Nitish Kumar-led JD(U) has chosen eight candidates, as against 18 the last time. The choice of BJP’s replacements for some of its sitting Yadav MLAs points to its new gameplan: it has gone for a Kushwaha, the most populous OBC community after Yadavs; a Nishad, an increasingly assertive extremely backward classes group; and a Vaishya, the party's traditional supporter, for the Patna Sahib, Aurai and Munger seats, respectively.Since it was elected to office at the Centre in 2014 and emerged as the largest party in Bihar, ahead of RJD and JDU, BJP has tried to expand its support base. Overtures to Yadavs were part of the plan to broaden the tent.In both 2015 and 2020, it disregarded Yadavs’ staunch support for RJD to give them a sizeable number of tickets. The community has a population share of 14.2%; that is three times the number of Kushwahas (4.2%).However, the community, which along with Muslims forms the mainstay of Lalu Prasad-headed RJD, refused to leave his side. If anything, it rallied even more vigorously behind INDIA in the 2024 Lok Sabha polls.RJD, the principal member of the opposition alliance, is trying to expand its formidable social coalition of Yadavs and Muslims by giving more tickets to candidates from other communities: something that represents a recognition that the powerful M-Y bloc is not adequate to end RJD’s two-decade-long exile from office. In contrast, BJP has decided to focus on preserving and rallying its more diverse and bigger core bloc of upper castes and a large section of non-Yadav OBCs, EBCs and Scheduled Castes. Ram Surat Rai, the sitting BJP MLA from Aurai who has been dropped this time, said Yadav lawmakers like him have borne the brunt of his party’s focus on its core votes as they were never seen as part of its social coalition.Rai was replaced by Rama Nishad, wife of former MP Ajay Nishad who had contested from Muzaffarpur on a Congress ticket after BJP denied him a Lok Sabha ticket in 2024. Nishads are seen as a swing bloc and wooed by RJD and its ally Mukesh Sahani of VIP. The party also dropped its seasoned lawmaker Nand Kishore Yadav, a seven-time winner and speaker in the outgoing assembly, in favour of Ratnesh Kushwaha from Patna Sahib.JDU, too, has followed a similar playbook. Seen as more vulnerable than BJP, it has fielded 25 candidates from Kurmi-Koeri (Kushwaha) castes and 22 each from upper castes and extremely backward classes.Nitish has this time fielded only four Muslims, as against 11 in 2020, in what is being seen as belated recognition that the community would prefer Lalu to him. A JDU functionary noted that all its Muslim candidates had lost last time, and the community has been vocal in its criticism of the party for siding with BJP in supporting amendments to the waqf law.BJP has named 49 candidates from upper castes and 52 from OBCs, EBCs and Dalits.A BJP functionary noted that both his party and JDU were contesting fewer seats (101 each) than the 110 and 115, respectively, they contested last time. “We had to drop many candidates. And members of some communities were easy choices as these groups are not much inclined to support our alliance,” the BJP neta added.","Bjp has fielded only six yadavs this time, as against 16 in 2020. Chief minister nitish kumar-led jd(u) has chosen eight candidates. Nitish has this time fielded only four muslims, as compared to 11 last time.

"Lokpal floats tender for Rs 5 crore BMW fleet for 7 members, draws flak",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/lokpal-floats-tender-for-rs-5-crore-bmw-fleet-for-7-members-draws-flak/articleshow/124729417.cms,"NEW DELHI: The seven-member Lokpal has drawn attention by floating a tender to procure seven BMW 3 series cars for its members at a cost of Rs 5 crore. The development drew comments on social media but judicial circles pointed out that the proposed purchase of cars for the ombudsman — headed by retired Justice A M Khanwilkar of the Supreme Court — is in accord with the perks that judges of SC and high courts enjoy.While the chairman of the Lokpal is selected from a pool of retired chief justices of India or SC judges, the judicial members are from among retired SC judges or chief justices of HCs. The types of cars for SC and HC judges depends on the decision of a committee of judges in courts.In case of SC judges, they have been allotted BMW 3 series, while the CJI has been sanctioned a BMW 5 series car, sources said. Different HCs have different kinds of cars allotted to their judges.For instance, Delhi HC judges have been allotted Toyota Camry, while their counterparts in Andhra Pradesh HC have been sanctioned Kia Carnival. For judges of several other HCs, Toyota Innova Hycross is the preferred vehicle.However, Congress spokesperson Saral Patel said the Lokpal, which is now looking to buy seven luxury cars worth Rs 5 crore, has not acted on a single case since Narendra Modi became PM.“This is the institution that Modi delivered after massive and continuous protests against UPA govt during India Against Corruption movement,” he jibed, recapping Congress’s allegation that Lokpal agitation by Anna Hazare was an RSS ploy to defame the the UPA.

Both husband and wife must compromise and adjust to maintain a normal marital relationship... (But) the petitioner sought an obedient and sincere maid rather than a wife. His unwillingness to adjust led to the breakdown of the marital relationship,” the court ruled.The appellant, employed in the US, had married a Singapore-based woman in 2015. The couple cohabited for only 25 days, including a ten-day stay in India.In 2016, the man filed a petition seeking divorce on grounds of cruelty. The family court dismissed the petition in 2020, observing that the wife had demonstrated that the husband and his mother were frustrated at not having received any significant dowry amount or property from her.The husband subsequently approached the HC.“According to Hindu customs and religion, marriage is regarded as a sacred union, not merely a cohabitation between a man and a woman. This union cannot be dissolved simply by filing a petition in court and making allegations against one another,” observed a division bench comprising Justices Jayant Banerji and Umesh M Adiga.It further held: “This case exemplifies a situation where the husband has sought divorce for trivial reasons.”",Karnataka high court dismisses man's appeal against a bengaluru family court verdict.

This has a reasonable nexus with the object sought to be achieved: the sufficiency of qualified and experienced MBBS doctors with better pay scales and longer service, both,” it said.“We are of the opinion that there should be an authoritative pronouncement on the issue, and hence we refer the matter to a larger bench.
