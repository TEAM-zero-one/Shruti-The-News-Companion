"After vehicle breakdown, guide abandons Ranthambore tourists",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/after-vehicle-breakdown-guide-abandons-ranthambore-tourists/articleshow/123376707.cms,"Jaipur: The open-top safari truck coughed, rattled, stopped. Twenty tourists sat trapped in Ranthambore's Zone-6 - a 25sqkm territory locals call ""three-tiger country"". Time: 6pm. Darkness set in and the forest closed in. Panic spread. Parents whispered words of comfort to shush their crying children.For an hour and 45 minutes Saturday evening, the group remained stranded. Among those stuck was a seven-month-old child. Their guide allegedly deserted them, taking a lift out with another vehicle. By 7pm, no relief had come.With no mobile network to summon help, tourist Mohit hailed another vehicle returning from a trip. There's room for only one. He reached the main gate and begged for help. At the chowki, staff told him it wasn't their responsibility.A Canter driver allegedly demanded full payment before agreeing to assist.Rescue finally arrived around 7.45pm. The replacement Canter had no working headlights. The driver steered through the jungle with a torch. Children cried as the forest went pitch black. An audio recording of a woman tourist's call, made after she reached safety, recounted the ordeal.""Fortunately, no wild animal appeared,"" she said. Ranthambore is home to 70 tigers and about 130 leopards.The broken Canter may have spared its passengers a brush with the wild - but it left the national park's safari system fully exposed.A senior official said Sunday the truck broke down during the evening safari. Another Canter, meant to be on standby at the chowki, was absent. A third Canter, which had already returned, was instructed to bring the marooned group but failed to follow orders. Forest department banned all three Canter drivers and the accompanying guide until further orders. An inquiry has been ordered, with the assistant conservator of forests (tourism) directed to submit a report in three days.The department also reviewed the age and condition of safari vehicles. Ranthambore currently has 556 registered vehicles for tourism: 269 Gypsies and 287 Canters. Authorised vehicles are either locally owned and registered with the forest department or department-owned, with private operators managing bookings.Hoteliers and conservation stakeholders warned that many Canters are in rundown condition.""Some owners avoid spending on maintenance... expecting the vehicles will be phased out,"" a tour operator said Monday. ""A dedicated rescue vehicle must always be stationed.""Tourists came to see the wild, but none of Ranthambore's tigers showed up. Instead, they saw the cracks in the system - in full, frightening darkness.","Twenty tourists sat trapped in ranthambore's zone-6 - a 25sqkm territory locals call ""three-tiger country"" for an hour and 45 minutes saturday evening, the group remained stranded.

KOLKATA: The Centre Monday moved Supreme Court challenging a Calcutta high court order directing it to resume the MGNREGA scheme in West Bengal from Aug 1. The apex court is likely to hear the plea this week.In June, the HC had directed the Centre to resume the rural employment programme in the state from Aug 1, saying the scheme could not be ""put in cold storage for eternity"". The scheme has been suspended in Bengal for nearly three years, with the Centre blocking the funds due to alleged irregularities and non-compliance with its directives.Refusing to buy the Centre's argument on fake job card holders, Chief Justice T S Sivagnanam had said, ""A person who obtained wages illegally or under fictitious names could not go free and had to be dealt with firmly. But what about those who did the work genuinely? A line should be drawn and a cut-off date announced.""TMC, however, used govt's own data to question its argument. Citing figures placed in the Lok Sabha, it alleged that 11,07,814 fake MGNREGS job cards were deleted across India between 2022 and 2025.","The centre monday moved supreme court challenging a calcutta high court order directing it to resume the mgnrega scheme in west bengal from aug 1.

Transparency and voter-friendliness: ""If fair elections are truly the aim of the ECI, why can’t it be more transparent and voter-friendly?""

NEW DELHI: Tamil Nadu chief minister and DMK president MK Stalin on Monday joined the chorus against the Election Commission of India (ECI) over concerns of voter deletions and irregularities in electoral roll preparation.He said the press conference held by Chief Election Commissioner Gyanesh Kumar on Sunday “raised more questions than it answered” regarding issues highlighted by the opposition INDIA bloc.Posting on X, Stalin wrote, “The interview by the #CEC is raising more questions than providing answers to the issues highlighted by the #INDIA bloc.”Earlier in the day, Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah said the ECI failed to address concerns of “electoral manipulation” raised by Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, which he claimed only strengthens suspicions about the poll body’s conduct.In a post on X, Siddaramaiah said, “The Election Commission of India (ECI) finally spoke, not out of duty, but because the Congress, the INDIA Alliance, the civil society, and even the Supreme Court forced it to. And when it did, the mask slipped.”He added that the ECI’s press conference “was shrouded in arrogance,” accusing the poll body of appearing to read from the BJP’s script rather than acting as an impartial referee.“Yesterday's press conference didn’t answer questions raised by LoP Shri @RahulGandhi—it only confirmed suspicions,” he said.Siddaramaiah highlighted discrepancies identified by Rahul Gandhi in Bengaluru Central, using the ECI’s own data. “From that one example, it is obvious that such anomalies exist in many other constituencies too. Instead of answering, the ECI tried to threaten the Opposition,” he said.The CM criticized the ECI’s insistence on affidavits and oaths for validating electoral data, calling it “absurd,” and said the commission’s dismissal of concerns about fake and duplicate voters was “nothing but an excuse to escape responsibility.”“The truth is, it took time for @INCIndia to expose these irregularities because the ECI itself made the data inaccessible. We had to dig through thousands of pages in just one assembly segment of Bengaluru Central to uncover the mismatches. If this is the situation in one seat, imagine the scale across the country,” he added.Chief Election Commissioner Gyanesh Kumar, meanwhile, refuted all allegations of “vote theft” made by Rahul Gandhi in a press conference on Sunday in New Delhi. He called claims of bias an “insult” to the Constitution and asked Gandhi to either submit a signed affidavit or apologise to the nation within seven days, stating that no third option existed.Siddaramaiah concluded that no press conference or “grand speech” would cover up the truth and urged the ECI to protect the interests of citizens.","Tn cm mk stalin highlighted seven key concerns: voter deletions, low new voter enrolment, procedural issues.

"Rajya Sabha clears Indian Ports Bill, 2025: New law replaces 1908 Act; aims to make India maritime leader by 2047",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rajya-sabha-clears-indian-ports-bill-2025-new-law-replaces-1908-act-aims-to-make-india-maritime-leader-by-2047/articleshow/123368331.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Rajya Sabha on Monday passed the Indian Ports Bill, 2025 — which seeks to replace the colonial-era Indian Ports Act, 1908 and provides for regulating of port operations with quality effort, sustainability and cooperative federalism, so as to make India a global maritime leader by the year 2047— but only after the Opposition parties had staged a walkout on the issue of special intensive revision (SIR) in Bihar.The Bill was passed by Lok Sabha last week.Ports, shipping and waterways Sarbananda Sonowal described the Bill as “a milestone reform that unlocks India’s maritime potential.” “Ports are not just gateways for goods, they are engines of growth, employment and sustainable development. With the Indian Ports Bill, 2025, India is not just playing catch-up but laying the foundation to become a global maritime leader by 2047,” he said before the Bill was passed by a voice vote.Prior to the discussion on the Bill, the Oppn’s demand for a debate on SIR was rejected by Chair Sasmit Patra, on the grounds that the matter was sub-judice and not related to the listed business. Leader of the House J P Nadda accused the Opposition of having no interest in discussion and wasting over 69 hours of House’s time with its irresponsible behaviour.“The Opposition only believes in anarchism and obstruction,” said Nadda.Once the Opposition benches were empty, it was smooth sailing for the Indian Ports Bill. Almost all speakers — Mokaria Ram Bhai, Rekha Sharma, M Thambidurai, Sunetra Ajit Pawar, Praful Patel, B P Baishya, etc — emphasised the need to replace the archaic 1908 law with a modern piece of legislation that promotes port connectivity, environment-friendly port operations and adherence to international maritime norms.When Thambi Durai alleged movement of contraband through state govt-managed ports in Tamil Nadu, DMK MPs led by Tiruchi Siva, who had walked out earlier, stormed back into the House to counter him. This led BJP MP Ram Chander Jangra to cite violation of the rule that an MP should pay respect to the chair while entering and leaving the House. “This is not a saraay (guest house),” he complained.Sonowal, while replying to the debate, said that unlike the Congress regime that had no policy relating to ports and shipping, the Narendra Modi govt had in the past 11 years passed 11 laws in this sector.“In 2013-14, during the UPA regime, our cargo handling capacity was 5 million metric tonnes (MMT). In the last 10 years, it has gone up to 855 MMT,” he said.","The rajya sabha on monday passed the indian ports bill, 2025. The bill seeks to replace the colonial-era indian ports act, 1908.

SC skeptical about involving HC CJ in state DGP selection,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-skeptical-about-involving-hc-cj-in-state-dgp-selection/articleshow/123375914.cms,"Supreme Court

NEW DELHI: Former DGP of UP and Assam Prakash Singh, on whose petition the Supreme Court had 19 years ago laid down the process for selection of state police chiefs by involving the Union Public Service Commission and ordered a fixed two-year tenure for them, on Monday suggested dramatic changes to its ruling, which, he said, had not been upheld by states.Amicus curiae and senior advocate Raju Ramachandran told a bench of CJI Bhushan R Gavai and Justices K Vinod Chandran and N V Anjaria that many states have framed rules for DGP selection which are very different from the procedure laid down by an SC bench led by then CJI Y K Sabharwal in a judgment on police reforms in 2006.Ramachandran said Singh has suggested that since the earlier guidelines for selection of DGPs were more honoured in the breach by states, the SC should direct each state to form a panel comprising the chief minister, leader of opposition and chief justice of high court, which would select the DGP from among eligible senior IPS officers. To this, CJI Gavai asked, ""To what extent does the SC have the competence to go beyond legislation enacted by states for selection of DGPs? If the HC CJ is made part of the selection process, which is part of the executive's function, would it not breach constitutionally mandated separation of powers between legislature, executive and judiciary?""The SC rejected contempt pleas against Jharkhand for appointing Anurag Gupta as DGP.",Supreme court had 19 years ago laid down the process for selection of state police chiefs.

GUWAHATI: A contentious mining lease granted to a private cement company for 3,000 bighas (4.01 sq km) in Assam's Dima Hasao district led an incredulous Gauhati high court judge to question on camera if it was ""some kind of joke or what"" that ""public interest"" had been sacrificed at the altar of business.""The entire district? What is going on? 3,000 bighas allotted to a private company? What kind of decision is this?"" Justice Sanjay Kumar Medhi is heard saying in courtroom footage, seemingly taken aback by a counsel's submission on the parcel of land at stake. When the lawyer representing Mahabal Cement Ltd argues that the disputed area near Umrangso ""is barren land"", Justice Medhi interjects, ""We know how barren is NC Hills (Dima Hasao's erstwhile name). "" Seconds later, the judge is seen rebuking the lawyer again just as she picks up a sheaf of documents in preparation for further arguments.""No, no, your lordship, we need it (the land). It's because of..."" the counsel says before Justice Medhi interrupts her.""Your need is not the issue, madam. Public interest is the issue,"" the judge says.The high court was hearing two petitions - one filed by Dima Hasao resident Sonesh Hojai and 21 others against the state govt and Mahabal Cement Ltd, and another by the company against the state govt and 10 others.Dima Hasao, one among six tribal-dominant districts of the state, is a biodiverse region famous for its hot springs, forests, migratory bird habitats and wildlife.As mandated by the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution, an elected autonomous council administers the district.Justice Medhi has directed the North Cachar Hills Autonomous Council's standing counsel, C Sarma, to ""obtain records containing the policy to allot such a huge chunk of land to a factory"" and submit these to the court at the next hearing. ""The direction has been given by taking into account that the district is a 6th Scheduled district under the Constitution of India, where the priority has to be given to the rights and interest of the tribal people residing there,"" stated the order.A video of the judge's exchange with the company's lawyer has been widely shared on social media.","Gauhati hc judge questions mining lease granted to a private cement company in assam.

Husband taking part in selection of AMU's 1st woman VC not proper: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/husband-taking-part-in-selection-of-amus-1st-woman-vc-not-proper-sc/articleshow/123375855.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday made adverse comments on the selection process that led to the appointment of Naima Khatoon as the first woman vice-chancellor of Aligarh Muslim University (AMU), saying the participation of her husband Mohd Gulrez, the officiating vice-chancellor, in the process was not proper.A bench of CJI Bhushan R Gavai and Justices K Vinod Chandran and N V Anjaria said, ""Certainly, the husband's participation in the selection process is not proper when his wife is a candidate. He should have recused and made his deputy participate in it. The selection process should not only be fair but also appear to be fair"".The remarks came on appeals filed against a judgment of Allahabad HC, which too had disapproved of the participation of Khatoon's husband in the selection process, but upheld her selection by the President, who is the visitor of the university, as the vice-chancellor of AMU.Appearing for the petitioners, senior advocate Kapil Sibal explained how voting in the executive council was tailored to insert Khatoon's name into the panel of five names - Faizan Mustafa, Qayyum Husain, Muzaffar Uruj Rabbani and Furqan Qamar were the other candidates - for the purpose. When these names were placed before the AMU Court (Senate), Rabbani got 61 votes, Mustafa, 50 votes, and Khatoon, 50 votes. These three names were sent to the President of India, who chose Khatoon as VC, and she was appointed to the post in Apr last year.Despite the CJI's adverse comments, the court adjourned the hearing as Justice Chandran recused himself, on the ground that as chancellor he had recommended the appointment of Faizan Mustafa as the VC of Chanakya National Law University, Patna.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta said Justice Chandran need not recuse himself as the parties had full faith in him. He held that Gulrez's participation in the selection process did not affect the sanctity of Prof Khatoon's appointment as AMU VC as her name was included in the panel of three names by the AMU Court.Additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati told the bench that the selection process had followed the rules and regulations scrupulously and that the high court, after examining the allegations, had upheld her appointment as the AMU vice-chancellor.Sibal said he had no issues with the Visitor's choice, but if the allegations of manipulation were examined and found true, then Khatoon's name would not have figured on the list of five names forwarded to the AMU court by the executive council.","Naima khatoon is the first woman vice-chancellor of aligarh muslim university. The supreme court made adverse comments on the selection process that led to her appointment. The court said the participation of her husband mohd gulrez, the officiating vice- chancellor, in the process was not proper.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123375887,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-34252,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
