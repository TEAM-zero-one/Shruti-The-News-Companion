I can’t accept payment by UPI anymore,” Shankar, a shopkeeper in Horamavu told ET.According to vendors, lawyers and accountants, thousands of unregistered small businesses, including street food stalls, push carts and corner shops, have received GST notices. Some face demands running into lakhs of rupees.Advocate Vinay K Sreenivasa, joint secretary of the Federation of Bengaluru Street Vendors Associations, said many vendors fear harassment by GST officers and possible eviction by civic authorities, prompting them to switch to cash.Under the current GST framework, businesses supplying goods must register and pay GST if their annual turnover exceeds Rs 40 lakh. For service providers, the threshold is Rs 20 lakh.The commercial taxes department stated that notices were issued only in cases where UPI transaction data since 2021-22 indicated turnover levels that require GST registration. It said such businesses must register, disclose their taxable turnover, and pay the applicable tax.However, HD Arun Kumar, former additional commissioner of commercial taxes in Karnataka, said GST authorities cannot simply quote random figures as turnover. “Under the GST laws, the burden of proof is on officers. They must establish it before arriving at a tax demand, unlike in money laundering cases,” he said.Opposition BJP MLA S Suresh Kumar said he plans to write to Chief Minister Siddaramaiah seeking his intervention.A former GST field official pointed out that not all UPI credits reflect business income. “Some of it would be informal loans or transfers from family and friends,” he said.“Bengaluru may emerge as a test case. If the GST authorities can net a good chunk of revenue by tapping unregistered vendors, other states too will take the cue as every state is desperate for funds,” said chartered accountant Sreenivasan Ramakrishnan of Sreeni & Associates.“Officials have zeroed in on chat vendors with high business in Mumbai. It's only a matter of time considering the huge potential tax base,” he told ET.Karnataka’s tax officials are under pressure to meet a collection target of Rs 1.20 lakh crore for 2025-26.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Wednesday turned the tables on a married woman, who sought cancellation of anticipatory bail to a man accused of raping her on promise of marriage, by warning her she might be liable for prosecution for having a physical relationship with a man other than her husband during subsistence of her marriage.When the woman's counsel argued that the man had continued to engage in a sexual relationship with his client on the false promise of marriage, a bench of Justices M M Sundresh and N Kotiswar Singh said, ""You are a married woman with two children. You are a mature person, and you understand the relationship you were getting into outside the marriage.""When the advocate said that she was called many times to hotels and rest houses by the man for sex on the pretext of marriage, the bench asked, ""Why did you go to the hotels repeatedly at his beckoning?

Allegations have been made that people are being illegally deported to Bangladesh just because they speak Bengali,"" it said.HC also sought affidavits from the Bengal government and Delhi Police over the deportation of a family of three from Birbhum to Bangladesh.State's senior counsel Kalyan Bandyopadhyay said speaking Bengali couldn't be grounds for suspicion that the person is an illegal immigrant. ""You can't detain and deport anyone for speaking Bengali. There is a procedure,"" he said, seeking to know how many such people had been held or deported.Delhi Police's counsel Dhiraj Trivedi said nobody had been deported for speaking Bengali. ""Around 165 people in Kashmir, including some who spoke Bengali, had been arrested after the terrorist strike on tourists in Pahalgam, but everyone was released.""The Centre's counsel, Asoke Chakraborty, wondered whether a writ of habeas corpus could be filed after a deportation order had been issued. There was also an argument over identical habeas corpus petitions being filed in both Delhi and Kolkata. Petitioners' counsel Raghunath Chakraborty said the kin of those deported had no knowledge of the case pending in Delhi HC.""Don't try to play tricks. Was it not your duty to ascertain whether they had earlier moved any other court? Do you think our orders are just scraps of paper? What sort of conduct is this?""

SRINAGAR: Leader of opposition in Lok Sabha, Rahul Gandhi , and Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday, demanding the restoration of statehood to Jammu & Kashmir by bringing a bill in the monsoon session of Parliament.They also urged the Centre to grant constitutional safeguards under the Sixth Schedule to the Union territory of Ladakh to “address the cultural, developmental, and political aspirations of the people of Ladakh, while safeguarding their rights, land, and identity”.J&K CM Omar Abdullah welcomed the development. “We had been waiting for the day when the opposition would raise our voice in Parliament,” he said.Abdullah said the restoration of statehood is not an unusual demand, reminding that the Centre has repeatedly promised, inside and outside Parliament, in Supreme Court, and at public platforms, to restore J&K’s statehood “at an appropriate time.”However, PDP functionary and former minister Naeem Akhtar opined that there is not much reason for optimism, given the sharp divide between the Centre and the opposition on every issue. But he added, “The return of statehood would bring some relief.”National conference chief Farooq Abdullah said he would react only after the government introduces such a bill in Parliament.Ladakh MP Haji Hanifa Jan also welcomed the Congress move. He told TOI that jobs are a major concern in Ladakh. “But more than that we want the restoration of democracy, and safeguards for our culture and identity. We want them to be protected,” he said.",Rahul gandhi and mallikarjun kharge wrote to prime minister narendra modi on wednesday.

NEW DELHI: The Unique Identity Authority of India has so far deactivated nearly 1.2 crore Aadhaar of deceased persons to prevent misuse of the 12-digit identity proof.The UIDAI has done this by sourcing records of nearly 1.6 crore deaths from the Civil Registration System (CRS) of 24 states and UTs through the Registrar General of India.""Following thorough validation, approximately 1.17 crore Aadhaar numbers have been deactivated. A similar exercise is ongoing in non-CRS states/UTs, with 6.7 lakh death records received and deactivation in progress,"" an official release said.It added that UIDAI has started a new service 'Reporting of Death of a Family Member' on the myAadhaar portal for the 24 CRS states and UTs. ""The family member, after authenticating himself/ herself, is required to provide Aadhaar number and death registration number along with other demographic details of the deceased person on the portal. After due process of validation of the information submitted by the family member, further action is taken for the deactivation, or otherwise, of the Aadhaar number of the deceased person,"" the statement said.UIDAI is also exploring the possibility of sourcing death records from banks and other Aadhaar ecosystem entities maintaining such information.It is taking the support of state governments in identifying deceased Aadhaar number holders. As a pilot, demographic details of Aadhaar number holders aged over 100 years are being shared with state governments to verify whether the Aadhaar number holder is alive. Upon receipt of such verification report, necessary validation will be carried out before deactivating such Aadhaar number, electronics and IT ministry said.",The unique identity authority of india has so far deactivated nearly 1.2 crore aadhaar of deceased persons.

NEW DELHI: Congress is likely to settle for a lower share of seats in Bihar than it contested in 2020, with sources saying that negotiations are on with a constituency-wise analysis among partners, including RJD and Left parties.According to a Congress manager, the party is likely to get a tally between 50 and 60 seats to contest, which would be below the 70 seats it contested in the last election to the 243-member assembly. But Congress, sources said, is focusing more on the ""winnability"" factor than numbers, and is keen to ensure that the alliance does not face dissonance which a race among allies for a greater share creates.While talks are ongoing, Congress's willingness to settle for a lower tally appears to be a bitter lesson learnt from the humbling experience of 2020. Congress had secured a high tally of 70 seats after intense bargaining, but could win only 19, and ended up taking the blame for the RJD-led alliance falling just short of the magic number against the JDU-BJP combination, which scraped home.Other parties in the alliance were CPM, CPI, CPI (ML), which had performed much better than Congress, compounding the criticism directed at the grand old party. The Patna failure seriously curbed Congress's bargaining power in the elections that followed in Tamil Nadu and other states where the party was a junior member of the alliance.While the better-than-expected results in the 2024 parliamentary polls raised Congress stock, the Haryana and Maharashtra debacles have marked a setback to the party in the eyes of its allies. At the same time, sources said Congress too is aware of the need for unity among partners and does not want to come across as putting itself above the alliance's interests.In Bihar, according to Congress members, the party is working to ensure coherence in the alliance and seeking to add value to the grand anti-NDA combine by amplifying Rahul Gandhi's messaging among backward classes. The attempt to secure seats for the JMM in Bihar is also seen as a step in that direction.","Congress likely to settle for a lower share of seats in bihar than it contested in 2020.

NEW DELHI: In the politically significant AgustaWestland VVIP chopper scam case, Delhi HC on Wednesday rejected a plea from fugitive Shravan Gupta, promoter of Emaar-MGF who fled to London in 2019, seeking further adjournment of his case relating to non-bailable warrant against him and that he be allowed to appear before ED through video conferencing in view of his inability to return to India.Pulling up his counsel for misleading the court repeatedly, the court refused to grant any further adjournment while reserving its order on the plea of quashing the non-bailable warrant.ED argued before Justice Neena Bansal that Gupta had failed to appear for questioning despite nine summonses issued to him since 2019. Two days after he wrote to ED (on Nov 24, 2019) seeking ""some time to join the investigation"" on grounds of ill health, with a doctor's prescription advising six days rest to him, Gupta had fled to London and not returned since then, sources said.Rejecting Gupta's adjournment request, Justice Bansal said the matter had already been argued by both sides on two previous occasions, and on each date after the arguments, senior counsel (for Gupta) Vikas Pahwa had sought time to get instructions from his client regarding his return to India to join the investigation. Such conduct is ""unbecoming of a senior advocate"", the judge said while pointing out that the counsel had been seeking repeated adjournments.Gupta is accused of receiving kickbacks from AgustaWestland intermediaries for influencing the VVIP chopper deal worth Rs 3,600 crore, sealed during the UPA regime. ""Shravan Gupta received proceeds of crime in Natille Overseas Inc, Switzerland; Timekeeper Ltd, British Virgin Islands; Hall Park Holdings Ltd, UK, etc which are beneficially owned by him,"" the ED had said earlier, and has filed 12 chargesheets in the case, including against Gupta in 2022.Probe found that a Mauritius-based shell firm received bribes in the deal signed with Agusta SPA, Italy. Bribes were laundered to India allegedly through Gupta's shell entities and shared with IAF officials, bureaucrats and politically exposed persons through a complex web of transactions.","Gupta is accused of receiving kickbacks from agustawestland intermediaries for influencing the vvip chopper deal worth rs 3,600 crore, sealed during the upa regime.

NEW DELHI: Days after granting an extension to Ravi and Beas Waters Tribunal, the country's oldest water disputes tribunal, the Centre has extended the tenure of Krishna Water Disputes Tribunal as well. Constituted in April 2004 to adjudicate the river water-sharing dispute among Maharashtra, Karnataka and erstwhile Andhra Pradesh, Krishna tribunal has got an extension of another year, with effect from August 1.Krishna tribunal is one of the four active river-water tribunals in India, which have got extensions year after year, as they haven't managed to come up with an acceptable decision despite their extended tenures.""The said tribunals were constituted to adjudicate disputes between two or more states and therefore need to work towards early resolution, particularly since such disputes involve public interest and public welfare.

HYDERABAD: The latest instance of toddy adulteration in Telangana, which has left seven people dead and dozens in hospital, has exposed another dark and sinister side of the business driving the sale of this alcoholic beverage that is otherwise considered less potent.Doctors report that an increasing number of children are getting addicted to toddy that has been spiked with sedatives like alprazolam (Xanax), diazepam (Valium) and chlordiazepoxide (Librium). Some of these children are as young as two years old and have barely learnt to stand on their feet. They are brought to doctors with withdrawal symptoms such as seizures, fever and sleeplessness.Psychiatrists TOI spoke to said it is common practice in parts of rural Telangana for parents and grandparents to give their children toddy to calm them and put them to sleep. What the elders don't realise is that much of the toddy sold now is often laced with sedatives. Doctors say they are seeing a substantial increase in such cases since pandemic, with four to five cases being reported every month.""In rural Telangana, it's very common for the whole family, including children, to consume toddy as it is considered a traditional drink. In poor families, children are made to consume it so that they sleep when both parents are out working. So, by the time a child is seven or eight, he or she is addicted to adulterated toddy, causing irreparable damage to their young bodies,"" said Dr Srinivas SRRY, head of the psychiatry department and nodal officer, addiction treatment facility, Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Hospital, Warangal. He has treated several children under 10 with withdrawal symptoms.","Doctors report that an increasing number of children are getting addicted to toddy spiked with sedatives.
