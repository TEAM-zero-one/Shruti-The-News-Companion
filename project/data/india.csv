NEW DELHI: A five-judge constitution bench of the SC led by CJI B R Gavai on Tuesday fixed a nine-day schedule to deliberate on a Presidential Reference that has questioned the SC’s power to fix timelines for the President and Governors on granting, refusing and withholding assent to Bills passed by Assemblies.The bench of CJI Gavai, and Justices Surya Kant, Vikram Nath, P S Narasimha and A S Chandurkar said the hearing would commence from Aug 19, when it will first hear senior advocates K K Venugopal and A M Singhvi on behalf of Kerala and Tamil Nadu, respectively, on the states’ preliminary objections to maintainability of the Reference.It said those opposing the reference, represented by Kapil Sibal, Rakesh Dwivedi, Gopal Subramaniam, would be given four days – Aug 19, 20, 21 and 26 - to complete their arguments. Those supporting the Reference – attorney general R Venkataramani and solicitor general Tushar Mehta – would place their response to maintainability plea as well as the constitutional issues warranting the Reference on Aug 28, Sep 2, 3 and 9.It reserved Sep 10 for rejoinders by parties and clarified that under no circumstance would the schedule be breached and told lawyers to arrange time-schedule for their arguments through prior consultation.It appointed advocate Aman Mehta as the nodal counsel for those supporting Reference and Misha Rohatgi as one for opposers.“The nodal counsel in consultation with lawyers shall arrange the timetable for the arguing counsel so that the hearing could be completed on Sep 10. The timetable will be followed scrupulously,” the CJI-led bench forewarned.TOI was first to report on May 15 about the President sending a Reference to the SC for its opinion on the contentious issue of judiciary stepping into the domain of the executive, especially when the Constitution gave no power to the SC to grant deemed assent on behalf of the Governor to Bills.Critical of the SC’s Apr 8 judgment and use of its Article 142 powers to rule that the 10 Bills pending with the TN governor to be deemed to have been assented to, the President had said, “The concept of a deemed assent of the President and the Governor is alien to the constitutional scheme and fundamentally circumscribes the powers of the President and the Governor”.The Reference had said Articles 200 and 201, applicable to Governors and the President respectively, “does not stipulate any time frame or procedure” to be followed by them while considering grant or refusal of assent to a Bill passed by an Assembly. The Reference has sought the SC’s opinion on 14 questions.Without any express provision in the Constitution, A bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and R Mahadevan on Apr 8 had set a three-month deadline for the Governor to either grant or return the Bill to the House. If the Bill is re-passed by the House and resent to him, then the governor must grant assent within a month, the SC had ruled. It had also fixed a three-month deadline for the President to decide whether to grant or refuse assent to a Bill.","A five-judge constitution bench of the sc led by cji b r gavai on tuesday fixed a nine-day schedule to deliberate on a presidential reference.

A woman collapsed beside the twin graves of Panakkadan Shajahan and his daughter Faiza as the cleric ended their death anniversary prayers. ""Poovi has fainted... It was too much for her,"" said an elderly relative as others rushed to help.Nearby lies the scattered grave of Shajahan's mother Panakkadan Jameela - buried across six different plots after her body was found in fragments. ""How can one find closure when she lies scattered like that?"" asked Mohammed Koya, kin to the Panakkadan family.One year has passed since a rain-triggered landslide on July 30 turned Chooralmala and Mundakkai into ghost villages in Kerala's Wayanad. Of the 298 confirmed dead or missing, 57 families were wiped out entirely, leaving no heirs to even claim the Rs 8 lakh ex gratia.Over 56 unidentified bodies and 213 body parts were interred at Puthumala burial ground - now a grim monument to nature's violence.At the epicentre, 5km away, crushed homes and debris line Punnapuzha's watery path.

Govt extended monthly support - Rs 6,000 in rent aid and Rs 9,000 in livelihood aid for up to two family members.

""Meppadi panchayat submitted a list of 545. The final list was cut to 402."" Despite Rs 772 crore collected in public contributions, only Rs 100 crore has been spent so far, he said.The ex gratia list revealed oversights. In Chooralmala, Vipin lost the house he had rented out. His name was excluded, while his tenants received compensation.The psychological toll remains immense. A post-disaster needs assessment of 1,231 people found over 35% reported trauma-related symptoms. Survivor Usman Bappu Koikkal suffers panic attacks during heavy rain. ""Even a motorcycle ignition makes my heart race,"" he said. ""I take three tablets a day just to stay stable.""Shopkeepers and small business owners have been left especially vulnerable.

He owned 11 rental shop units and plantation land, including a 2-acre cardamom plot. All of it now lies buried or abandoned. With dialysis thrice a week and Rs 14 lakh in unpaid loans, Aboobacker said: ""Now I depend on others to survive.""The fight is not against rubble - it's against time, fatigue and fading attention.

Now you have clubbed all cases together to include those accused of giving bribes, the poor parents who wanted a job for their children. This indicates that the state does not want the trial to ever come to an end against the minister.

""Two days after he was granted bail by the SC, he was reinstated as a minister in the present govt. He stepped down only after the SC intervention.

"India's ambassador to Cuba ends up with 2 wives, SC seeks solution",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indias-ambassador-to-cuba-ends-up-with-2-wives-sc-seeks-solution/articleshow/122941591.cms,"SC says it has no sympathy for Cuba envoy

He manipulatively estranged her from daughter, says 1st wife

NEW DELHI: Can a marriage solemnised between a man and a woman belonging to the Kuki tribe in a church be dissolved by the Songpijan village committee and 'gaonburas (village elders)' in Assam's Dima Hasao district on proceedings initiated by the husband relying on customary law?The Gauhati HC had said once a marriage takes place in a church in terms with the Christian Marriage Act, 1872, it cannot be annulled by customary law practices involving village elders. Such a marriage can only be dissolved through proceedings initiated before the HC or the district judge as per section 10 of the Divorce Act, 1869, it had said.This HC ruling landed the Indian ambassador to Cuba, Thongkomang Armstrong Changsan, in a piquant matrimonial situation as he ended up with two wives. Prior to the HC declaring in 2022 that his 1994 church marriage with Neikhol Changsan subsisted, he had married another woman after the customary divorce. From both marriages, he has a daughter each.After failure of the mediation ordered by the Supreme Court, during pendency of Changsan's appeal, a bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi on Friday orally observed that the HC judgment is legally sound. Finding that the Indian Foreign Service officer is now married for nearly a decade and half, it decided to find a solution to this legal-matrimonial complexity and help the first wife start a new life.The ambassador said he has been paying a monthly maintenance of Rs 20,000 to Neikhol and has given her a house in Delhi.Neikhol argued the case herself and told the court that she had single handedly brought up her daughter without any participation from her husband.Neikhol, the first wife, alleged that he has now manipulatively estranged her daughter (29) from her. For the ambassador, senior advocate Menaka Guruswamy said the father had been meeting the expenses of his daughter, who is pursuing a career in Bengaluru.Neikhol appealed to SC to ""protect her honour and dignity"" while describing how surreptitiously Changsan dissolved the marriage using tribal community elders, and remarried. The Justice Kant-led bench said, ""We have absolutely no sympathy for the man. The HC judgment is in your favour, and you have suffered socially and mentally. But can you think of a way to start life afresh?""Interestingly, 'Kuki Inpi' of Assam, the highest governing body of the Kuki tribe in the state, has said Kuki customary law can neither dissolve a Christian marriage performed in church nor can it force any couple to reunite against the will of the couple.SC said it could be profitable for Neikhol to meet her daughter and discuss future course of action, and asked the ambassador to arrange for her flight tickets to Bengaluru, a place of stay near her daughter's place, and pay her an ad hoc amount of Rs 3 lakh to enable her to meet her daughter.""If at all there is a possibility of settlement, the daughter could have a significant role to play,"" Justice Kant said, adding that the IFS officer must advise his daughter to re-establish contact with her mother.","Sc says it has no sympathy for cuba envoy thongkomang armstrong changsan.

Government throws open IITs for students from gurukuls,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/government-throws-open-iits-for-students-from-gurukuls/articleshow/122961118.cms,"NEW DELHI: Students who have studied in traditional gurukuls, even without formal academic degrees, will now have the opportunity to earn recognised qualifications and receive generous scholarships for research at premier IITs. The move marks a major shift in India's education policy, opening up elite research pathways for scholars from non-formal backgrounds rooted in classical learning.The initiative, titled 'Setubandha Vidwan Yojana', aims to bridge India's age-old gurukul tradition with modern scientific and academic inquiry. Backed by the ministry of education and implemented by the Indian Knowledge System (IKS) division of the Central Sanskrit University (CSU), the scheme offers fellowships of up to Rs 65,000 per month across 18 interdisciplinary fields - from ayurveda to cognitive science, and architecture to political theory, grammar to strategic studies, performing arts to mathematics, physics, and health sciences.""Setubandha is the first national-level programme to formally integrate traditional scholars into the research ecosystem of IITs, without insisting on conventional degrees. Instead, eligibility is based on a minimum of five years of rigorous study in a recognised gurukul and demonstrable excellence in Shastras or traditional knowledge,"" said a senior MoE official. The maximum age to apply is 32 years.Scholars selected under Category 1 (equivalent to postgraduate level) will receive a monthly fellowship of Rs 40,000 and an annual research grant of Rs 1 lakh.Those under Category 2 (equivalent to PhD level) will be awarded Rs 65,000 monthly and an annual grant of Rs 2 lakh. Some of the recognised research areas include Anvikshiki Vidya (philosophy and cognitive science), Ganit-Bhaut-Jyotish Vidya (mathematics, physics, astronomy), and Bhaishajya and Arogya Vidya (Ayurveda and health sciences).The scheme marks a significant institutional recognition of traditional knowledge systems, which for decades have operated outside formal academic structures. The NE explicitly calls for the integration of Indian Knowledge Systems (IKS) into mainstream curricula and research, encouraging cross-disciplinary studies rooted in the country's intellectual heritage. With increasing global interest in ayurveda, yoga, Sanskrit linguistics, and indigenous governance systems, the govt sees this initiative as a way to empower traditional scholars and harness centuries-old wisdom for modern applications in science, technology, and social policy.In 2020, India more than just released a policy - it rekindled an ancient ideal. National Education Policy (NEP) placed learning at the heart of nation building, drawing from civilisational wisdom. Framed through one of the most participatory policy-making processes in history under late K Kasturirangan's guidance, NE was a visionary roadmap rooted in cultural values. It reimagined learning as a process free from confines of rote memorisation, rigid structures, and linguistic hierarchies. It set the stage for a holistic, inclusive and future-ready education system.Five years on, NEP's impact is visible in policy corridors and classrooms. In early childhood classrooms, play-based learning is displacing rote memorisation; children read fluently in their mother tongue; Class 6 students explore hands-on skills in vocational labs. Its imprint is visible in research hubs where India's knowledge systems engage in dialogue with cutting-edge science. NEP's vision is reflected in the rise of women in STEM fields and in the growing global presence of Indian institutions.Nipun Bharat Mission has improved learning outcomes, ensuring foundational literacy and numeracy by Class 2. Nipun Bharat's success, reflected in Aser 2024 and Parakh Rashtriya Sarvekshan 2024, has made classrooms spaces of curiosity and comprehension. Initiatives like Vidya Pravesh and institutionalisation of Balvatikas will help integrate early childhood care and education. Add to this new-age textbooks and introduction of Jaadui Pitara and e-Jaadui Pitara in 22 Indian languages. Over 14L teachers have completed Nishtha training, and platforms like Diksha have expanded access to teaching resources.NEP recognised language is not a hurdle but a powerful medium of empowerment. With 117 language primers developed and Indian Sign Language introduced as a subject, vision of multilingual, inclusive education is being realised at scale. Bhartiya Bhasha Pustak Yojana and National Digital Depository for Indian Knowledge Systems will democratise access to linguistic and civilisational learning.National Curriculum Framework for School Education and new textbooks for Classes 1 to 8 are in place. Prerna is a bridge programme to help curriculum transition and ensure students aren't overwhelmed but supported at each stage of their learning journey.Centrally sponsored schemes like Samagra Shiksha and PM Poshan have helped achieve near-universal enrolment. NEP's reach has extended to underserved populations. More than 7.12L girls from disadvantaged groups are enrolled in over 5,138 Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalayas. Over 490 hostels have been sanctioned for PVTG learners and 692 hostels under Dharti Aaba Janjatiya Gram Utkarsh Abhiyan. Prashast, a programme that screens for disability, helps the schooling system become more resilient and inclusive.A key driver of the transformation under NE are 14,500 PM Shri schools. These modern, inclusive and green institutions are being developed as exemplary schools aligned with NEP's vision, redefining both infra and pedagogy. The Vidyanjali platform has connected over 8.2L schools with more than 5.3L volunteers and 2,000 CSR partners, directly benefitting 1.7cr students. In higher education, total enrolment has risen from 3.42cr to 4.46cr, a 30.5% increase. Women now comprise nearly 48% of all students, and female PhD enrolment has more than doubled from 0.48L to 1.12L. This expansion in enrolment, especially for SC, ST, OBC, and minority students, marks a historic achievement for inclusivity in higher education. Female GER has surpassed male GER for six consecutive years.Introducing Multiple Entry and Exit, Academic Bank of Credits with over 21.12cr APAAR IDs issued, and National Credit Framework have together provided flexibility and mobility. With 153 universities offering multiple entry and 74 multiple exit options, learning is not linear but modular and student-driven.NEP's emphasis on research and innovation has improved India's Global Innovation Index rank from 81st to 39th. Over 18,000 startups have been incubated across 400 HEIs. Anusandhan NRF, revamped PMRF 2.0, and the ₹6k cr One Nation One Subscription initiative show a commitment to decentralise access to research.Tech platforms like Swayam and Swayam Plus have recorded over 5.3cr enrolments. Support of Diksha and PM e-Vidya with over 200 DTH Channels ensures high-quality content is available countrywide. Digital learning ecosystem's success, including biannual admissions and dual degree regulations, has made higher education more inclusive, interdisciplinary, and industry-relevant. In QS World University Rankings 2026, 54 Indian institutions made the list, up from just 11 in 2014. Global universities Deakin, Wollongong, and Southampton have set up campuses in India.The journey of transformation is being celebrated through Akhil Bharatiya Shiksha Samagam, but is being measured in the quiet confidence of learners, teachers, and parents. We must continue to green our campuses, expand critical research infra, and deepen learning outcomes. Under PM's leadership, education is not just policy but the greatest national investment. Where there is learning, there is progress. A billion minds unshackled and empowered aren't just a demographic dividend, but New India's supernova.","The initiative, titled 'setubandha vidwan yojana', aims to bridge india's age-old gurukul tradition with modern scientific and academic inquiry.

Solicitor general Tushar Mehta said he agrees with everyone in the courtroom that lawyers must not be summoned for their professional work.Mehta said it would not be prudent for the court to lay down guidelines based on a singular infraction and cautioned that it could prove counterproductive. ""The agencies also cannot ignore a lawyer, who is a director of a company under investigation for fraudulent transactions, giving an opinion for commission of an illegality. Merely because he is a lawyer, he would not be immune from prosecution for the acts he did as director of the company,"" the SG said.Giving another example, he also said a fugitive, who fled the country, told the agency that the documents demanded from him are available with a law firm and that the officers could take it from the law firm. ""Should the agency not go to the law firm to collect the documents? Will that impinge upon the lawyer's privilege?"" SC asked and told the AG and the SG to give their response to the suggestions given by SCBA, SCAORA and other lawyers by Aug 12.",The privilege of immunity from prosecution is available to a lawyer as long as he or she acts as a legal practitioner for a client. The enforcement directorate issued summons to two senior advocates and later withdrew it.

SC questions age restriction for surrogacy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-questions-age-restriction-for-surrogacy/articleshow/122985706.cms,"If couple in their 50s, 60s can adopt, why can't they have surrogate child, asks SC

NEW DELHI: Questioning the restrictions under surrogacy laws, including age limit on intended parents and surrogate mothers, Supreme Court Tuesday said laws shouldn't frustrate the wish of childless couples, widows and divorcees to become parents through surrogacy. Instead, the laws should frustrate commercial surrogacy.A bench of Justices B V Nagarathna and K V Viswanathan said present laws seem ""harsh"" to those wanting to take the surrogacy route to parenthood. The bench is examining provisions of Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021 and the Assisted Reproductive Technology (Regulation) Act, 2021.The laws set age limits for intended parents and surrogate mothers. An intended mother must be aged between 23 and 50, and the intended father between 26 and 55 years. Further, a surrogate mother must be married and between 25 and 35 years of age, have a biological child, and only act as a surrogate once in her lifetime.Laws allow single women (widowed or divorced) between ages 35 and 45 to pursue surrogacy. Appearing for the govt, additional solicitor general (ASG) Aishwarya Bhati defended the provisions, saying the age bar was needed to ensure a child's welfare and to prevent commercial surrogacy.She said the limits were also set keeping in mind the genetic quality of gametes and urged the court to refrain from passing an interim order.The bench, however, said rationality was lacking in the provision and asked why a single woman could not go for surrogacy. ""If she is a widow or a divorcee then she needs it more. Look at the void in her life... Rationality and object are absent. Look how harsh it is,"" the bench observed. It said if a couple in their 50s and 60s can adopt, then why can't they have a surrogate child.SC reserved its order on a plea of three petitioners, seeking its approval to go for surrogacy as they are age barred. They submitted that the laws came into force in 2022 but they started the process much earlier as they froze their embryo in 2012 and 2016, and that they should be allowed to pursue. Bhati argued that there were multiple reasons for freezing embryos, and it might not just be for surrogacy.""Crystallisation of rights happens on implantation of the embryo in the uterus and not just on freezing of embryos,"" the ASG submitted. She said there are a large number of embryos that might have been frozen earlier but they cannot claim exemption from the law. The court, thereafter, reserved its order on the plea but hinted that it would protect only those who initiated the process before the laws came into force.In one of the cases, the wife is 58 years old and the husband is 64.In the second case, the wife is 53 and the husband 56. Multiple petitions have been filed challenging various provisions of the Acts. One of the petitioners submitted that the laws were discriminatory as it barred a single woman from surrogacy.""The restrictions are wholly discriminatory and without any rational or reason behind it inasmuch as the said restriction is not only infringing fundamental rights of the petitioner, but also violative of the basic human rights of an individual to found a family as recognised by the UN and reproductive rights, which have been recognised as an aspect of personal liberty under Article 21,"" the plea said.","If couple in their 50s, 60s can adopt, why can't they have surrogate child, asks sc.

NEW DELHI: In a dramatic development, a junior woman judicial officer has resigned, protesting the appointment of a district judge as an HC judge despite her serious allegations of misconduct against him. In her resignation letter, she lamented that the constitutional courts rewarded a judge who had severely harassed and tormented her.The judicial officer, reinstated by the SC's stinging judgment of Feb 28 that termed her termination ""arbitrary and illegal"", said the district judge, who had orchestrated her sufferings, was rewarded with a high court judgeship.The man I accused, not anonymously but with documented facts and the raw courage only a wounded woman can summon, was not even asked to explain.

The same institution that teaches equality before law, handpicked power over truth. He, who orchestrated my suffering was not even questioned but rewarded,"" she further said.

Election Commission has given a timeline for those not figuring in it to take steps for inclusion of their names or corrections if any.""When Sibal and others protested the procedure and claimed it was an exercise to exclude certain categories of people, the bench further said, ""It is not a question of document. Show 15 people who are alive, yet their names have been deleted on the ground that they have passed away.

Suspecting the role of some outsider and not lawyers, the bar associations sought a police inquiry and forensic examination of documents to catch the culprit which the apex court agreed to consider.In this murky case, a litigant managed to get a favourable order from SC after he propped up a 'ghost' opponent who told the court that he had compromised with the petitioner in a land dispute, which became the basis for the top court to quash orders passed by a Muzaffarpur trial court and Patna HC against the litigant. Five months later, the real opponent appeared and told the court that he had neither compromised with the petitioner nor engaged any lawyer to represent him before SC.The names of four lawyers were mentioned in the order out of which three are known names in the field of litigation but no one had heard of the fourth advocate.
