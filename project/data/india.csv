Lack of expertise and coordination with the revenue department has further slowed registration. Misuse: Some state Waqf boards have misused their powers, creating community tensions.

NEW DELHI: Uttarakhand Waqf Board chairman Shadab Shams on Wednesday criticized the opposition for opposing the Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2024. He said that poor Muslims have expectations from Prime Minister Narendra Modi and described the situation as ""70 saal vs Modi Karyakal"" (PM Modi’s term versus the past 70 years).Shams said that the Central government, under PM Modi, has decided to bring poor Muslims into the mainstream.""Poor Muslims have hopes from PM Modi, and that is why we have named this amendment bill as 'Ummeed'.

They looted the rights of the poor. They are scaring the Muslims by saying that mosques will be taken away. Those who are opposing are not Muslims. They are political Muslims of Congress, Samajwadi Party, AAP, and Janata Dal.

He requested the court to consider release of his passport, which had been surrendered to the Maharashtra Police, and permission to travel abroad as his work involved interviewing famous personalities both in India and overseas.Asked by the court on how much time police would take to complete the investigations into the incident, solicitor general Tushar Mehta said it should be over in two weeks.

Why BJP pitch for Waqf reforms may find support among a section of Muslims,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/why-bjp-pitch-for-waqf-reforms-may-find-support-among-a-section-of-muslims/articleshow/119875363.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Waqf Amendment Bill is all set for Parliament nod with the BJP managing to convince its allies about the benefits of backing the legislation. This even as the INDIA bloc of opposition parties have been very vocal and united in their opposition to the Bill claiming that it harms the interests of the Muslims.If the government succeeds in getting the Bill passed - in both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, it will be the second big change that the BJP would have pushed to implement in the minority community after making the practice of triple talaq illegal in 2019.However, there is one major difference between then and now. In 2019, the BJP had absolute majority in Lok Sabha while it is now dependent on support of key allies for the survival of its government.So, how did the BJP managed to convince its key allies, especially Chandrababu Naidu and Nitish Kumar , who have enjoyed considerable support of the minorities over the years?Both Chandrababu Naidu's TDP and Nitish Kumar's JD(U) have announced to support the Bill and have issued a whip to their MPs to vote for the legislation. Earlier in the day, the JD(U) had announced that it was against retrospective implementation of the law and had hoped that the government would consider its demand.Interestingly, there are a lot of similarities in the way the BJP has pitched for these legislations then and now.The Triple Talaq Bill found support of many parties as it favoured the women of the community by protecting them from arbitrary divorce by men - which was a common practice over the years.Similarly, the BJP now pitched the Waqf Amendment Bill as a reform measure that would help the poor among the Muslims, who, the party claimed, had no say in the affairs of the community.Jagdambika Pal, chairman of the Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) on the Waqf Amendment Bill, summed up how the legislation would benefit the poor members of the community. ""We’ve now prepared a 400-page amendment, which addresses the needs of the country’s minorities. This law aims to support vulnerable groups, including the poor, women, orphans, widows, and economically backward Muslims,"" he said.Union parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju asserted that those opposing the Bill are ""powerful people"" who have encroached upon the Waqf properties.The Union minister asserted that the amendment bill was in interest of poor Muslims, children and women and would ensure accountability and transparency when it comes to managing properties under the Waqf board.BJP MP Dinesh Sharma claimed that the Waqf Bill was like a ""dream come true"" for the underprivileged Muslims.""Waqf is like a dream come true for poor Muslims. This is going to fix their plight. This bill is going to end the corruption prevailing in Waqf and the nexus of real estate and builders. This bill will be the roadmap for the underprivileged education, employment, house, and basic needs,"" Sharma said.""Government of India has made it very clear and even the committee chairman that they are not renewing the Waqf Board itself but they are only amending certain clauses and issues, which will enable the poor Muslims to have representation in the Waqf Board and women and other genders in Muslim community ,"" he added.Already, some BJP leaders have claimed that the opposition parties and some leading Muslim organisations are opposing the Waqf Bill as they fear a section of the Muslims would start voting for the saffron party.Perhaps, the BJP hopes to once again create a divide between the rich and the poor within the community by pushing through the ""reform"" legislation and eventually make some electoral gains.",Both chandrababu naidu's tdp and nitish kumar's jd(u) have announced to support the bill.

Giving the background of RSS's support for the movement started by ""sadhus and sants"" for construction of Ram Mandir in Ayodhya and saying the Sangh would not stop its members from supporting the efforts of VHP and others for taking possession of sites of Kashi Vishwanath Mandir in Varanasi and Krishna Janmabhoomi in Mathura, Hosabale suggested that the push for mass re-conversion of mosques allegedly built on temple sites fell into a different category.""But if we talk about all the other mosques and structures, should we start digging up 30,000 mosques and attempt to reverse history? Would that not create more hostility and resentment in society? Should we move forward as a society or stay stuck in the past? How far do we go in history?"" Hosabale said in an interview with Kannada weekly, Vikrama.Delineating the stand which was first articulated by RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat, the Sangh general secretary said the demand for control of allegedly disputed mosque sites could only be pursued at a huge cost to society's other priorities like eradication and untouchability. ""If we keep doing this, when will we focus on other vital societal transformations? What about eliminating untouchability? How do we instil values in youth?"" he said.Hosabale, who is next only to Bhagwat in hierarchy, also seemed to caution that single-minded pursuit of the reclamation agenda could be at the expense of other issues which have been of equal concern for those pushing for it - preservation of culture and languages, conversions, cow slaughter, love jihad. ""The Sangh has never said anybody should ignore or not work on these issues,"" he said.Hosabale further said the movement for re-conversion of disputed sites was not in keeping with the conception of a temple. ""Consider the concept of a temple. Is a former temple that has been turned into a mosque still a divine space? Should we focus on finding Hindutva in remains of a stone structure, or should we awaken Hindutva within those who have distanced themselves from it? Instead of searching for traces of Hindu heritage in stone buildings, if we revive the Hindu roots within them and their communities, the mosque issue will resolve on its own,"" he told Vikrama.","Rss general secretary dattatreya hosabale has made it clear that sangh was against the idea.

The court emphasized that the right to shelter is a fundamental right and must be protected under the rule of law.

'These cases shock our conscience': SC on illegal Prayagraj demolitions

NEW DELHI: Noting that a message has to be sent to ""make govt authorities remember"" that right to shelter is a fundamental right and rule of law is part of the basic structure of the Constitution, Supreme Court Tuesday directed Prayagraj Development Authority to pay compensation of Rs 10 lakh each to five people whose houses were illegally razed in 2021, setting a benchmark for the fine to be paid for resorting to what has come to be known as "" bulldozer justice "".A bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and Ujjal Bhuyan rejected the state govt's plea to refrain from awarding compensation as the aggrieved people were not poor and owned multiple houses. Attorney General R Venkataramani, appearing for the state, said the constructions were illegal and illegality should not be compensated.The court said there was a procedure prescribed before demolition and the facts of the case were shocking as houses were razed within 24 hours of proper notices being served. The demolition was done on March 7, 2021, in which the houses of a lawyer, a professor and others were razed. Notice was served to them on March 6.Authorities, especially the development authority, must remember that the right to shelter is a fundamental right and an integral part of Article 21 of the Constitution. They should also know that there is something called rule of law which is a basic feature of the Constitution, the SC bench said.As stated earlier, no effort was made to serve them notices in person or by registered post. Only communication dated March 1 was sent by registry which was received on March 6 and demolition was carried out on March 7. The applicant was deprived to avail the appeal against the decision. Therefore, demolition is illegal, the bench added.""Considering the inhuman and illegal manner in which demolition was carried out, we quantify the compensation of Rs 10 lakh each to the appellants and direct the Prayagraj Development Authority to pay compensation to the appellants,"" court said.It added that the practice of affixing notice on the house had to stop which could be done as a last resort after notice could not be served in person.The bench said ""these cases shock our conscience and this should never happen"". Justifying its harsh order against Prayagraj Development Authority, the bench said this would discourage the authority from carrying out such exercises without following due procedure.The petitioners in the case are advocate Zulfiqar Haider, professor Ali Ahmed and three other individuals. They moved the apex court after Allahabad HC dismissed their plea against the demolition.

The Sena filed an FIR against Kamra the same day.The banker got a call from the police on March 28 and then a notice on his WhatsApp on March 29 under Section 179 of CrPC, requesting his presence the following day. He said, ""I had left Mumbai on March 21 for the trip and was supposed to return on April 6. But I returned midway after repeated calls from the police while I was in Tamil Nadu. The officer who called me was sceptical about my out-of-town status and threatened to visit my Kharghar residence. This prompted me to cut short my trip and return early.""The notice sought his witness statement under CrPC. The banker told TOI, ""Despite me saying that I had booked a ticket for the show online and that I had proof of booking, the cops said I might have edited the video Kamra has recorded. Why will the comedian hand over his shows video to me (for editing)?""Cops have started recording the statement of the cameraperson who recorded the video and statements of other staffers who were present when the video was shot Feb 2. Police said they will give adequate security to Kamra when he arrives in the city after Shiv Sena workers said the party would welcome him to Mumbai in 'Sena style.'Nearly 70 people had attended Kamra's show when it was recorded on Feb 2. However, police withheld information on the total number of audience members who had been served notices under Section 179 of the CrPC during investigation.Responding to TOI's report Tuesday about audience members being summoned, Kamra posted on X, ""How to kill an Artist: a step-by-step guide - outrage (just enough for brands to stop commissioning their work), outrage more (until private and corporate gigs dry up), outrage louder (so big venues won't take risk), outrage violently (until even smallest spaces shut their doors), summon their audience for questioning (turning art into a crime scene).

Searches intensified in the Ramkote area with drones and sniffer dogs. Several villagers are suspected of aiding the infiltrators.

JAMMU: A brief gunfight was reported as security forces pursued Pakistani terrorists in new areas of J&K’s Kathua district, following last Thursday’s gunfight in Sufain forests that left four policemen dead. Two terrorists were also killed, but at least three of them managed to escape.In Poonch district, a series of landmine blasts occurred in Krishna Ghati sector Tuesday. “No loss of life or injury reported so far,” an official said. The area has an anti-infiltration obstacle system, with landmines that sometimes get washed away by rain and triggered by cattle or human movement.The forces intensified search operations and laid a cordon in the forested Panjtirthi area of Ramkote in Kathua after gunfire erupted Monday night, officials said Tuesday. Police received intelligence about the presence of three armed men in the area.“The firing has stopped. A cordon was put up to stop the terrorists from escaping,” an official said.They are believed to be the same men spotted in combat clothing in Ghati-Juthana forest Monday, just a few km from the site in Sufain. According to officials, the fugitives are constantly on the move, taking advantage of the mountainous terrain’s natural hiding spots, including caves and dense forests.The forces have deployed drones for aerial surveillance, while sniffer dogs are assisting joint teams from Army, police, NSG, CRPF, and BSF in the search.Police have detained six members of a jailed “overground” worker of terrorists on suspicion of aiding the armed Pakistani infiltrators in hiding and navigating the area undetected.According to sources, many people from remote villages may be coerced or financially incentivised to assist the terrorists — such as knowledge of the terrain and resources, enabling the intruders to evade security forces and carry out attacks in the challenging landscape.","Security forces in jammu and kashmir's kathua district engaged in a gunfight while pursuing pakistani terrorists.

BJP allies shift stance, back Bill

Govt defends Bill as reform measure



Oppn, Muslim groups strongly oppose Bill



NEW DELHI: The Lok Sabha is set to deliberate on the long-debated Waqf Amendment Bill on Wednesday, with the ruling BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) pushing for its passage and the opposition strongly condemning it as ""unconstitutional.""""This Bill is unconstitutional. This Bill is a grave violation of Article 14, Articles 25, 26 and 29. This is not Waqf Bill rather it's a Waqf Barbaad Bill,"" said AIMIM 's Asaduddin Owaisi However, the ruling coalition holds the advantage in both Houses of Parliament, making the Bill's eventual passage likely possible despite the opposition's strong resistance.Minorities and parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju said that the Lok Sabha’s Business Advisory Committee (BAC), chaired by Speaker Om Birla has agreed to an eight-hour debate.The session could be extended based on the House’s consensus.Tensions flared as Congress and several opposition INDIA bloc members staged a walkout from the BAC meeting, accusing the government of suppressing their voices. Congress deputy leader Gaurav Gogoi criticised the limited debate time and demanded discussions on additional issues, including the situation in Manipur and concerns over electors’ photo identity cards.Despite opposition resistance, the NDA is well-positioned to pass the Bill, holding 293 MPs in the 542-member House. Key allies include the Telugu Desam Party ( TDP ) with 16 MPs, Janata Dal (United) with 12, Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas) with 5, and the Eknath Shinde-led Shiv Sena with 7 MPs.In the Rajya Sabha, the NDA holds a total of 125 MPs representation, including BJP’s 98, JD(U)’s 4, Ajit Pawar’s Nationalist Congress Party (NCP)’s 3, and TDP’s 2. The Bill will be taken up by the Upper House following its passage in the Lok Sabha.The Congress has criticised JD(U) and TDP for supporting the Bill, calling it an ""attack on the Constitution."" The grand old party's Jairam Ramesh said, ""Every opposition party opposes it, but what is the stand of so-called secular parties JD(U) and TDP?""Initially, some NDA allies, including JD(U), TDP, and LJP (Ram Vilas), had reservations about the Bill.However, they later extended their support after a parliamentary joint committee incorporated their recommendations. JD(U) MP Sanjay Jha reiterated that his party opposed any retrospective implementation of the Bill but expressed hope that the government would address this concern.""Nitish Kumar has been working in Bihar for the last 19 years. During this time, the work he has done for the Muslim community is also visible. Our party had said that it should not be implemented with retrospective effect, and we hope that the government will consider it... As long as Nitish Kumar is in politics, the interests of the people will be protected,"" JD(U) MP Sanjay Jha said.Ending days of speculation, Chandrababu Naidu’s TDP has officially backed the Bill, despite opposition criticism and protests from various Muslim organisations.""The whole Muslim community is waiting for the Waqf Amendment Bill to be tabled. Our party will support it. Chandrababu Naidu has already mentioned that we will work in the interests of the Muslim community. Tomorrow, the Bill will be tabled, only then we will make any comments on it. I assure you that Chandrababu Naidu is in favour of Muslims,"" TDP national spokesperson Prem Kumar Jain said.Meanwhile, TDP & JD(U) have issued a whip to all its MPs, directing them for their presence in Lok Sabha on Wednesday.The Church of Bharat and the Catholic Bishops Conference of India have extended support to the Bill, strengthening the government’s defense against allegations of an anti-minority agenda.The government maintains that the Bill seeks to improve transparency and efficiency in managing Waqf properties. Initially referred to a joint parliamentary committee, the Bill underwent revisions before receiving cabinet approval.Opposition parties and prominent Muslim organizations continue to oppose the Bill, calling it unconstitutional and harmful to the Muslim community. AIMIM leader Asaduddin Owaisi has labeled it an attack on religious freedoms and warned that BJP allies like TDP and JD(U) will face repercussions for their support.","The lok sabha is set to deliberate on the long-debated waqf amendment bill on wednesday.

NEW DELHI: Stand-up comic Kunal Kamra on Tuesday once again hit back at critics amid the row over his ""gaddar"" (traitor) remark targeting Maharashtra deputy CM Eknath Shinde . Kamra shared a satirical post on X titled ""How to kill an artist 'democratically'"", in which he condemned what he described as a systematic effort to silence artists.The post, structured as a step-by-step guide, outlined how outrage can be used to restrict artistic expression :""Now the artist is left with only two choices: Sell their soul and become a dollar puppet - or wither in silence. This isn't just a playbook, it's a political weapon. A silencing machine.""The controversy began after Kamra's performance at the Habitat Comedy Club in Khar, where he referred to Shinde as a ""traitor"" without directly naming him and performed a parody song aimed at him. The remarks triggered a strong backlash, leading to calls for action against the comedian.On Monday, Mumbai Police reportedly visited Kamra's ""residence"" in connection with the matter. In response, Kamra dismissed the visit as futile, posting on X: ""Going to an address where I haven’t lived for the last 10 years is a waste of your time & public resources…""Meanwhile, Shiv Sena's Yuva Sena general secretary Rahool Kanal issued a strong statement towards stand-up comedian Kunal Kamra.

The lawyers also threatened to stay away from Justice Sharma's court if he was allocated cases.Protesting the move to transfer Justice Sharma, the three lawyers' bodies had written to Chief Justice of India Sanjiv Khanna last Saturday that Calcutta HC cannot be a 'dumping ground' for judges with 'questionable image or short stints', just days after lawyers of Allahabad HC had protested the transfer of Justice Yashwant Varma using the same term. Justice Varma is currently embroiled in a cash-recovery row and lawyers of Allahabad HC have been protesting his transfer from Delhi HC saying their HC can't be used as a 'dumping ground'.With Calcutta HC lawyers staying away, very few cases were heard during the day as judges made it clear they would not hear matters unless both sides were present during the hearing.Three lawyers' bodies wrote to CJI, appending whistleblower emails from Oct 28 and Nov 4, 2024, alleging Justice Sharma retained certain civil disputes as ""part heard"" despite a roster change.
