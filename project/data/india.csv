NEW DELHI: An undertrial's prolonged incarceration cannot be a ground to grant bail in terror cases, where the intent is to destabilise the country's unity, Delhi high court recently held.A bench of justices Navin Chawla and Shalinder Kaur made the observation while denying bail to separatist Nayeem Ahmad Khan in a terror funding case involving Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and 26/11 Mumbai attack mastermind Hafiz Saeed.Khan, who had challenged a trial court order of Dec 2022 rejecting his bail plea, argued the trial was not likely to conclude in the near future, and he ought to be granted bail to balance the period of custody he had undergone with his fundamental right to liberty.Rejecting the contention, the bench said: ""While we are aware that the right of an undertrial to a speedy trial is of paramount consideration, in cases involving terrorist activities ,which have nationwide implications and where there is an intention to destabilise the unity of the Union of India and to disrupt its law and order, more so, to create terror in the minds of the public, which are also factors that weigh in, the long period of incarceration would not, in itself, be ground enough to enlarge an accused on bail.""Khan, a member of Hurriyat Conference and chairman of J&K National Front, was arrested on July 24, 2017, under Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, and is currently in judicial custody.",A bench of justices navin chawla and shalinder kaur made the observation.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Tuesday agreed that some men and their relatives may have been harassed by fake dowry harassment cases filed in misuse of Section 498A of IPC (equivalent Sec 85 of Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita) by women but said that cannot be a ground to alter the law protecting women from cruelty in matrimonial homes.""Just because of certain instances of misuse of Section 498A of IPC and Section 85 of BNS, can a sweeping statement be made that women are harassing their husbands and in-laws? Nothing can be further from truth. In a vast majority of cases, it is the women who face harassment at matrimonial homes. Hence, the law and the courts will deal with each case according to the facts therein,"" said a bench of Justices Surya Kant and N Kotiswar Singh.Petitioner NGO 'Janshruti' said it was approaching SC for judicial intervention to address ""critical concerns surrounding matrimonial laws, particularly the misuse and application of provisions relating to maintenance, domestic violence and cruelty.""The NGO's counsel said SC must make Section 498A of IPC and Section 85 of BNS gender neutral to ensure protection of the victim of cruelty, be it women or men, in matrimonial homes and insertion of safeguards to prevent misuse of matrimonial laws, including mandatory preliminary investigation and mediation prior to arrest. Giving instances of extreme cruelty by husbands towards wives, Justice Kant-led bench said, ""The allegations that the provisions have been misused cannot be a ground for forming an opinion by the court while exercising writ jurisdiction. Such allegations can be examined by court on a case-to-case basis.""On amendments to Section 498A of IPC and 85 of BNS, the bench said, ""This exclusively falls in the domain of the legislature.

As constitutional courts, we can step in only when we discover certain vacuums in the legal framework.""On the petitioner's suggestion of enforcing the mandatory 60-day time limit for deciding maintenance cases, Justice Kant asked, ""Do you understand how many more civil courts and magistrates would be required for this? Who will create the infrastructure, recruit judicial officers and staff? Dismissing the PIL, SC said, ""It all depends on the financial health of the states.

However, these minor clashes soon turned into full-blown communal violence as the Bangladeshi elements went out of control; instead of restricting themselves to engineering minor incidents as ""asked by TMC members"", they decided to escalate things on their own and resorted to clashes that claimed three lives, central govt sources told TOI, citing inputs from intelligence agencies and other sources, reports Bharti Jain.The violence specifically targeted Hindus, said sources.

NEW DELHI: Survivors of the violent clashes in West Bengal’s Murshidabad district have recounted harrowing tales of destruction and fear following protests against the Waqf (Amendment) Act that spiralled out of control on April 11-12.Displaced families now sheltering in relief camps in neighbouring Malda say they were forced to flee after mobs attacked homes and businesses, leaving at least three dead and hundreds homeless.“We came here on Saturday. Everything in our house was set on fire,” Lalchand Mandal told ANI, speaking from a camp in Par Lalpur. “We came here for shelter. If this violence happens again, how will we be able to go back to our homes? We want peace, we request the government to bring back peace there.”His sentiments were echoed by Rupa Mandal, who described the moment chaos erupted during a family meal. “Our entire house was set on fire. We were having lunch and suddenly, some people entered inside and started looting and attacking us. BSF personnel took us here to the relief camp. We want compensation for our house” she said.Shopkeepers have also suffered enormous losses. One trader revealed how his entire building was destroyed and his shop looted. “They broke through that and entered inside. They caused complete destruction and even looted some of our belongings. Opposite my building, I have a shop. They broke the shutter of that shop too. Monday was a bank holiday, so I received all the payments on Tuesday. I had around Rs13.5 lakh in cash with me. The cash was meant to be deposited at the bank, but it was all stolen. Apart from that, my shop had furniture and equipment worth Rs7-8 lakh, including chairs, tables, CPUs, computers, and laptops. Altogether, I had nearly Rs20-25 lakh in losses.”Adhir Ravi Das, another shopkeeper, said nothing remained of his business. “My shop has been completely damaged. Materials worth Rs 6-7 lakhs were in the shop; everything has been burnt. We want peace. Since BSF is here, the situation is normal. We want a BSF camp here.”Hyder Ali, whose nephew Izaz Ahmed was killed in the violence, had earlier told TOI that the threat of clashes still remain in the region : “There is a group which is inciting youths here. They will try to do it again. For them, it's political gains, but we will have to pay with the blood of our kin. Today it was Izaz; I do not know whom death will claim next.”The deployment of BSF and CRPF has brought some measure of calm to affected areas such as Samserganj, Dhulian, Suti and Jangipur. Shopkeeper Habib-ur-Rehman confirmed, “The situation in Samserganj is normal now. The administration is asking us to open our shops and stay disciplined. The situation has changed after BSF and CRPF have been deployed.”In response to the unrest, the Calcutta high court has ordered the deployment of central forces in Murshidabad. The BSF’s Additional Director General (East), Ravi Gandhi, toured the worst-hit areas, assuring residents that restoring peace was the top priority. “We spoke to people and assured them of their safety. The situation is slowly returning to normal,” he said.So far, around 210 people have been arrested. Meanwhile, two petitions have been filed in the Supreme Court seeking a judicial investigation into the violence and demanding better protection for affected citizens.",Displaced families now sheltering in relief camps in neighbouring malda say they were forced to flee after mobs attacked homes and businesses.

Maharashtra Reduces Ladki Bahin Yojana Stipend for 8 Lakh Women Citing Dual Benefits,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/maharashtra-stipend-for-8l-ladki-beneficiaries-cut/articleshow/120290515.cms,"Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis

Poll Do you agree with the decision to reduce the stipend for beneficiaries of the Mukhya Mantri Majhi Ladki Bahin Yojana? No, it negatively impacts the beneficiaries. Yes, it's necessary to ensure eligibility.

MUMBAI: The state govt has reduced the stipend of eight lakh beneficiaries of its flagship Mukhya Mantri Majhi Ladki Bahin Yojana because they were also receiving benefits under another govt scheme, the Namo Shetkari Mahasanman Nidhi (NSMN).The eight lakh women will receive a payout of Rs 500 instead of Rs 1,500 per month because they already receive Rs 1,000 under Namo Shetkari programme. The Ladki Bahin scheme stipulates that its beneficiaries can avail of other govt schemes only if the benefit is capped at Rs 1,500 per month.This is part of state's move to scrutinise beneficiaries of the Ladki Bahin scheme and to restrict the stipend only to those who fit the eligibility criteria.In Oct, state had around 2.63 crore applicants for the scheme. The scrutiny process reduced that figure by 11 lakh to 2.52 crore beneficiaries by Feb. The final stipend went to 2.46 lakh in Feb & March.""There has been an ongoing scrutiny. First to scan the applications that were sent by the districts to the state headquarters. And then to re-scrutinise the eligible cases,"" an official said.CM Devendra Fadnavis earlier said he expects the number of beneficiaries to reduce by 10-15 lakh after the scrutiny process. ""We're not changing criteria or funding, just ensuring only eligible ones get the stipend,"" he said.The state govt is scrutinising Ladki Bahin beneficiaries on the basis of five key criteria. The beneficiaries have to be within the age limit of 18-65 years, and they must be domiciled in the state. Their family income limit has to be within Rs 2.5 lakh per year. Those with a four-wheel vehicle and a member of the family in a govt job are excluded from the scheme. Those who receive benefits from other govt schemes can do so as long as the combined benefit is within Rs 1,500 per month.The state is under pressure to control its purse strings while keeping its key programmes going. The state's debt projection is 9.3 lakh crore for 2025-26. The outlay for the Ladki Bahin scheme was reduced from 46,000 crore to 36,000 crore in the 2025-26 budget.","The eight lakh women will receive a payout of rs 500 instead of rs 1,500 per month. The ladki bahin scheme stipulates that its beneficiaries can avail of other govt schemes only if the benefit is capped at £1,500.

NEW DELHI: The conspicuous absence of affirmation from the BJP top brass on ally Nitish Kumar's chief ministership ahead of the upcoming Bihar assembly polls has led to out-of-sync statements from both the BJP and the JD(U).While Nitish's party has dug its heels on the CM post, Haryana counterpart Nayab Singh Saini's remark that NDA would win the Bihar poll under BJP's Samrat Choudhary raised eyebrows on Monday.As Saini's statement triggered flutter in the poll-bound Bihar, the JD(U) leaders rolled up their sleeves on Tuesday to assert Nitish as CM for the next five years.Blunting the opposition's charge of the BJP outsmarting the Nitish, national spokesperson Rajeev Ranjan Prasad dismissed the Haryana CM's comment and asserted that the ruling alliance faces no crisis over its chief ministerial face in Bihar.Prasad said, ""The Bihar assembly elections will be held under the leadership of Nitish Kumar, and he will be the face of the National Democratic Alliance. Chief minister Nitish Kumar will head the NDA government, which is certain to be formed after the elections for a full term till 2030.""Nitish Kumar's son Nishant Kumar also appealed to Bihar voters ""to give a majority (to JDU) more than what they gave in 2010...

""How? How can she say she will not implement it? She is sitting in a constitutional position and the law is passed by a constitutional body, then how can she say that she will not follow something that is constitutional,"" he said.He added that such a stance undermines the constitutional framework and the rule of law.In response to queries about the Waqf Act related violence in that state, Rijiju blamed Banerjee.

It is also crucial for the replenishing of reservoirs critical for drinking water, apart from power generation across the country.However, normal cumulative rainfall does not guarantee uniform temporal and spatial distribution of rain across the country, with climate change further increasing the variability of the rain-bearing system.Climate scientists say the number of rainy days is declining while heavy rain events (more rain over a short period) are increasing, leading to frequent droughts and floods.Monsoon in India usually arrives over the southern tip of Kerala around June 1 and retreats in mid-September.The India Meteorological Department defines average or normal rainfall as ranging between 96% and 104% of a 50-year average of 87 cm (35 inches) for the four-month season.","Imd chief mrutyunjay mohapatra also ruled out the possibility of el nino conditions during the entire season.
