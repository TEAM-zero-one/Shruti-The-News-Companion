"India logged 19.7L excess deaths in 2021, 6x official Covid toll: Government data",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-logged-19-7l-excess-deaths-in-2021-6x-official-covid-toll-government-data/articleshow/121013243.cms,"India registered around 25.8 lakh more deaths in Covid year 2021 compared to 2019, the last pre-Covid year, as per official data based on the civil registration system (CRS) that was released on Wednesday. After accounting for a natural increase in population over the two-year period, the spike in deaths in 2021 is about 20 lakh, nearly six times the official Covid death tally of 3.3 lakh in that year.The highest undercounting of deaths was in Gujarat, which saw nearly 2 lakh excess fatalities, more than 33 times the state's official count of just over 5,800 Covid deaths in 2021, the data revealed.Excess deaths were 18 times higher than the official Covid toll in Madhya Pradesh and 15 times higher in West Bengal. In Bihar, Rajasthan, Jharkhand and Andhra Pradesh too, excess deaths were more than 10 times higher than the official Covid toll.The lowest discrepancy between official Covid tolls and the calculated excess deaths for that year were in Kerala, Uttarakhand, Assam, Maharashtra and Delhi, the data reveals. The report on vital statistics of India based on the civil registration system (CRS) released on Wednesday shows that India registered around 25.8 lakh more deaths in the Covid year of 2021 compared to 2019, the last pre-Covid year. Not all of the excess deaths are attributable to Covid, but even accounting for a natural increase in population over the two-year period, the spike is about 20 lakh, nearly six times the official Covid death tally of 3.3 lakh in that year.Gujarat saw the highest undercounting of deaths with nearly 2 lakh excess deaths, more than 33 times the official count of just over 5,800 Covid deaths in 2021. Other states where the excess deaths were several times the official Covid toll were Madhya Pradesh (18x) and West Bengal (15x). In Bihar, Rajasthan, Jharkhand and Andhra Pradesh too, the excess deaths were over ten times the official Covid toll.How do we get to these numbers? Even with the death rate remaining unchanged, the number of deaths would increase as the population does. Hence, we applied the 2019 death rates, as revealed in the sample registration system (SRS), to the 2021 population projected by the Census office to arrive at what the number of deaths should have been in 2021 in the normal course. In fact, death rates had been falling steadily till 2019, so these estimates actually somewhat overestimate what the numbers would have been. We then compared this estimate to the actual number for 2021 reported by the CRS. The difference is 'excess deaths'.In Madya Pradesh, the government's Covid death tally for 2021 was about 6,900 deaths. However, total deaths registered in 2021 exceeded the number projected using 2019 death rates by about 1.3 lakh. West Bengal reported a little over 10,000 Covid deaths in 2021, while excess deaths were over 1.5 lakh.Among larger states, Kerala, Uttarakhand, Assam, Maharashtra and Delhi showed the least discrepancy between the Covid death tally given by the respective governments for 2021 and the calculated excess deaths for that year. In these, excess deaths varied from 1.5 to 3.1 times the official Covid toll.Another report, on medical certification of cause of deaths in 2021, also released on Wednesday, shows that Covid was the second leading cause of death that year accounting for 17.3% of deaths, behind diseases of the circulatory system, which accounted for 29.8% of total medically certified deaths. This meant that despite medically certified deaths accounting for less than a quarter (23.4%) of total registered deaths, the number of certified Covid deaths in the report was 4.1 lakh, higher than India's official tally of 3.3 lakh Covid deaths.","India registered around 25.8 lakh more deaths in covid year 2021 compared to 2019, the last pre-covid year.

CJI Sanjiv Khanna urges Centre to initiate steps to oust Justice Yashwant Varma,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cji-sanjiv-khanna-urges-centre-to-initiate-steps-to-oust-justice-varma/articleshow/121009534.cms,"Chief Justice Sanjiv Khanna

Justice Varma has been without judicial work since March 2

NEW DELHI: Chief Justice Sanjiv Khanna is understood to have recommended to the Centre to initiate a motion in Parliament for removal of Allahabad high court 's Justice Yashwant Varma , who refused to resign despite a judicial inquiry corroborating discovery of huge amount of cash at his official residence in Delhi on March 14.The SC officially said on Thursday that the CJI, in line with the in-house procedure, has written to President Droupadi Murmu and PM Modi ""enclosing therewith copy of the three-member committee report dated May 3 along with the letter/response dated May 6 received from Justice Varma"".Under the in-house procedure, if an inquiry report indicts the judge for corruption or misdemeanour, the CJI would ask the judge concerned to either resign or seek voluntary retirement. If the judge refuses, the CJI is to write to the President and the PM to initiate removal proceedings under the Judges Inquiry Act .On the recommendation of the CJI, the govt will have to initiate a motion for removal of Justice Varma in either Lok Sabha (minimum 150 MPs to sign) or Rajya Sabha (50 MPs to sign). It would then be open for the LS speaker or the RS chairman to decide whether the motion is to be admitted.Once the motion is admitted, the speaker or chairman would constitute a three-member committee comprising an SC judge and an HC chief justice and a distinguished jurist. The committee will frame charges against the judge for investigation and the judge concerned will have an opportunity to refute the evidence.After a formal trial, the committee will give a report to the House concerned, which, if it finds the judge guilty, will debate the matter in the two Houses. The judge can be removed only after each House with two-thirds of members present and voting support the motion. Earlier, Parliament had debated removal motions against SC judge V Ramaswami, which fell through in Lok Sabha in 1991, and Calcutta HC's Justice Soumitra Sen, who resigned midway through the debate in Parliament.In its May 3 report, the inquiry panel comprising Punjab and Haryana HC Chief Justice Sheel Nagu, Himachal Pradesh CJ G S Sandhawalia and Karnataka HC's Justice Anu Sivaraman corroborated the finding that a huge amount of cash was found at Justice Varma's residence by first responders to a fire incident at his official Tughlaq Crescent bungalow in Delhi.The inquiry panel had also detailed the mysterious disappearance of bundles of cash that had not caught fire on the night of March 14-15 after the first responders and police left the scene. The CJI had sent the adverse report to Justice Varma seeking his response.The CJI had also suggested to Justice Varma to tender his resignation given the virtual indictment by the informal inquiry panel constituted by the CJI on March 22. His refusal to do so and readiness to prove his innocence before a formal inquiry committee, which will be set up following admission of a motion in either House of Parliament, forced the CJI's hand to write to the President and the PM.Justice Varma has been without judicial work since March 20. He was repatriated to Allahabad HC later in the month and the CJ concerned was advised not to assign him any judicial work. He will continue to be without judicial work till the formal inquiry, set up after admission of the motion for his removal in one of the Houses in Parliament, is completed and Parliament debates it.",Chief justice sanjiv khanna is understood to have recommended to the centre to initiate a motion in parliament for removal of justice yashwant varma.

NEW DELHI: The central government on Thursday opened two gates at the Baglihar Hydroelectric Power Project in Ramban and three gates at the Salal Dam in Reasi.This reportedly aimed at managing rising water levels triggered by heavy rainfall in the region and also to manage dam pressure.The development comes just days after the Chenab's water levels had dropped sharply, following the government's decision to restrict the river’s flow, an unprecedented action that led to stretches of the riverbed becoming walkable for the first time in recent memory in some downstream areas.The regulation of the Chenab’s flow is being widely viewed as a strategic signal of India’s ability to control water releases, especially in the context of mounting tensions with Pakistan.The decision to restrict the river’s flow followed the Centre’s suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) with Pakistan, announced in the aftermath of the April 22 Pahalgam terror attack that killed 26 civilians, including several tourists.Under the IWT, India is obligated to notify Pakistan before making any significant interventions in the flow of western rivers like the Chenab.However, with the treaty now suspended, India has acted unilaterally to manage the river's waters, both in terms of withholding and releasing them as per domestic needs.",Central government opens two gates at the baglihar hydroelectric power project in ramban.

NEW DELHI: Banking on the forecast of a good monsoon rainfall in most parts of the country this year, govt on Thursday set a target of record foodgrain output of 354 million tonne (MT) for the 2025-26 crop year (July-June), which is nearly 4% higher than the target of 2024-25 and over 6.5% more than the actual production of 2023-24.The foodgrains basket comprises of paddy, wheat, coarse cereals and pulses.The target, set after taking inputs from all states, was discussed during a national conference on Kharif campaign where policy makers and farm scientists brainstormed over preparedness and availability of adequate inputs (quality seeds, fertilisers, etc.) ahead of the sowing season.IMD had last month predicted 'above normal' rainfall for most parts of the country, including the 'monsoon core zone', where farmers depend on seasonal rainfall. Good monsoon rains (June-Sept) invariably help farmers in having bumper output.Addressing the conference, agriculture minister Shivraj Chouhan announced a pan-India 15-day campaign (May 29-June 12) to create awareness among 1-1.5 crore farmers, across 700 districts, about climate-resilient seed varieties, availability of fertilisers, monsoon forecast and benefits of govt programmes.""Farm scientists and officials will be among farmers during the campaign. There are 16,000 farm scientists in India and there is a need that farmers and scientists should work together,"" said Chouhan.He said that the Centre will consider making amendments in the Seeds Act, 1966 to curb sales of spurious seeds, ensure seeds traceability and protect farmers interest. Under pan-India awareness campaign, Centre in association with states will form 2,000 teams comprising farm scientists and progressive farmers.","Imd had last month predicted 'above normal' rainfall for most parts of the country.

Following the Kansas City Chiefs ’ Super Bowl loss to the Philadelphia Eagles in February and the conclusion of Taylor’s monumental “The Eras Tour,” the couple took a step back from the spotlight to relax and reconnect in private.As Swift renovates her Rhode Island mansion into a potential family home, Kelce is back to training for what could be his final NFL season while also upgrading his lifestyle to match their evolving relationship.Taylor Swift is already focused on her next musical chapter, with a new album in development and plans reportedly underway for a 2026 tour, according to sources. Meanwhile, she’s also making moves in real estate, listing her former Cape Cod mansion owned briefly between 2012 and 2013 for sale.The most notable step is Taylor Swift’s decision to renovate her $17.75 million mansion in Watch Hill, Rhode Island. This historic 12,000-square-foot estate, perched on a scenic coastal cliff, is undergoing a $1.7 million transformation to become a primary residence. The upgrades include expanding the bedroom suite and lounge by 400 square feet, redesigning the kitchen, and adding a new bedroom.The living room is also being remodeled, and the front portico will be reconstructed. Permits were quietly filed in late 2024, with construction expected to finish by the end of 2025. Sources suggest Taylor Swift envisions this property as a future family retreat with Kelce.Now, as the off-season winds down, Travis Kelce is back at the Chiefs’ training facility, gearing up for what many believe could be his final NFL season. With a decorated career behind him, this upcoming chapter is set to be both meaningful and emotional.Alongside his return to football, Travis Kelce is also continuing his popular podcast, New Heights, which he co-hosts with his older brother and former Philadelphia Eagle, Jason Kelce. The podcast has become a fan favorite, offering a candid and often humorous glimpse into their lives both on and off the field.Parallel to Taylor Swift’s efforts, Travis Kelce is also making big changes to accommodate their shared future. In response to safety concerns following a high-profile burglary at his Kansas City mansion where over $100,000 in valuables were stolen Kelce has significantly enhanced the security of his home. He installed a $40,000 alarm system, multiple CCTV cameras, motion detectors, and floodlights.Additionally, Travis Kelce built a fortified safe room and an underground man cave. Two guard dogs, costing $9,000, and 24/7 private security at $6,000 per month have also been added. These improvements are largely aimed at ensuring Taylor Swift feels safe during visits, especially given the intense public and media attention surrounding their relationship.Beyond these two main properties, Taylor Swift is reportedly eyeing new real estate in Nashville and Kansas City. Nashville, her long-time base, offers proximity to family and friends, while Kansas City would place her closer to Kelce during the NFL season. Sources indicate that the couple may even be considering purchasing a home together in Kansas City, a move that strongly suggests they are planning for a more settled, domestic life.Also Read: “External forces trying to unbalance them”: Living Nostradamus claims cosmic fate ties Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift, warns of looming challenges ahead All these developments point to a serious turn in their relationship.

Ahmedabad-US airfares drop as visa rush slows,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/ahmedabad-us-airfares-drop-as-visa-rush-slows/articleshow/121015898.cms,"Image used is for representational purposes only





AHMEDABAD: If you have ever dreamt of flying to the United States but were grounded by sky-high airfare, this summer might just be your moment, provided you have a valid visa to the American land.A sharp dip in travel demand, especially among students, coupled with visa woes for tourists and foreign education aspirants, has led to a dramatic fall in airfare prices from Ahmedabad to the US, offering a golden window for globetrotters, according to industry players.For travel booked on May 8 for a round trip between June 8 and 21, the cost of a one-stop, 19-hour flight between Ahmedabad and the US is now pegged at approximately Rs 85,000.That breaks down to just Rs 42,500 one-way — nearly or less than half of what flyers paid last year. Compare that with the jaw-dropping summer 2024 fares that reached up to Rs 2.2 lakh for a round trip. “This is a steep decline as compared to last year. It will benefit tourists who plan to visit the US this year.However, there is a marked 35-40% decline in group tour bookings to the US, thanks to visa issues and unavailability of slots for visitor visas.Moreover, the uncertainty around policies of the new govt, more people are refraining from making travel plans to the US,” said Manish Sharma, owner of a travel company from Ahmedabad.Visa woes have deterred many visitors from going to the US. An overall reduced intake has impacted airfares.Virendra Shah, a travel expert, said, “A combination of factors including changing visa policies amidst geopolitical shifts have caused fewer flyers to visit the US. With the US govt’s stricter immigration stance tightening the pipeline for students and tourists, the once-bursting outbound traffic from India has notably thinned. Fewer visa approvals mean fewer fliers, and airlines are responding by slashing prices to fill up seats. Due to stricter policies, people are rethinking their travel plans.”According to travel industry players, flights to the US from not just Ahmedabad, but also Mumbai and Delhi, are seeing a similar trend. “Due to visa issues, fewer students are going this time around as compared to last year. Moreover, student visits will begin from July-end onwards for the fall intake and therefore, the current airfares will certainly be less,” said Bhavin Thaker, foreign education consultant.Additionally, improved air connectivity between India and the US has played a key role in the reduction of fares. With more one-stop options and streamlined connections through international hubs, flyers now enjoy better schedules and competitive pricing.This fare drop comes as an unexpected relief for leisure travellers, business professionals and even Indian Americans planning to visit family back home.","The cost of a one-stop, 19-hour flight between ahmedabad and the us is now pegged at approximately rs 85,000.

"Air raid sirens activated amid attack threat: Chandigarh, Mohali, Panchkula ups its defences, orders blackout",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/air-raid-sirens-activated-amid-attack-threat-tricity-ups-its-defences-orders-blackout/articleshow/121014960.cms,"Chandigarh, Mohali, and Panchkula experienced a blackout following air raid sirens and potential threats





CHANDIGARH/MOHALI/ PANCHKULA: The air raid sirens were activated in the city, and a blackout was declared at around 9.30 pm. In a message circulated to different resident and market associations, the Chandigarh DC said, “Keeping in view the ongoing emergency situation, all the residents are requested to immediately respond to the sound of the siren and switch off all the lights. They are also advised not to venture outside or onto the rooftops.”While the residents switched off the lights, in several locations, there was a long delay in switching off the streetlights. Additionally, the solar lights remained switched on even as the sirens blared. Vehicles could be seen on the street with their lights on.Earlier in the day, the Chandigarh administration started strengthening the civil defence system in the city.“Satellite phones will be used in case of communication breakdown. Strengthening the Control Room of Civil Defence will be done. Air raid warning systems will be increased from 20 to 50. Uniforms will be given to civil defence personnel,” said a UT spokesperson.Power supply from the grid was restrored after midnight. However, the DC urged citizens to observe voluntary blackout.In view of a potential threat of attack from Pakistan, a two-hour blackout was enforced in Mohali around 9.30pm, Mohali DC Komal Mittal said.All residents were requested to turn off lights, including street and outdoor lighting; minimise movement outside unless absolutely necessary; and stay indoors and remain calm. This is a precautionary measure to ensure the safety of all citizens, so please cooperate fully with local authorities, the DC said.A brief period of confusion gripped Panchkula on Thursday night as a blackout was imposed across the city.The sudden shutdown led to uncertainty among residents, many of whom were unaware of the directive and had not turned off their lights. The confusion was partly attributed to the lack of a robust air siren system in the city. This led to a delayed response, with many homes remaining lit for several minutes after the blackout began.Streetlights too remained on for a considerable time before being eventually turned off. Later, as information spread through word of mouth and digital messages, more residents complied and switched off their lights.The blackout will remain in force throughout the night, added the Panchkula DC.","Chandigarh, mohali, and panchkula experienced a blackout following air raid sirens and potential threats from pakistan.

The Bell 407, operated by Aero Trans Service, crashed shortly after taking off from Kharsali.





DEHRADUN: The aircraft accident investigation bureau, under directions from DGCA, has launched an inquiry into what caused the fatal crash of a helicopter ferrying six passengers to Gangotri shrine on Thursday.Whether it was mechanical failure, human error, or a sudden change in weather will be central to the probe.Five passengers and the pilot were killed.Among the six victims were Dr Kala Soni, 61, and Ruchi Agarwal, 56, both residents of Powai; and Ruchi’s mother, Radha Agarwal, 79, originally from Bareilly, who had been staying with her daughter in Powai.The aircraft was piloted by Captain Robin Singh, 60, a seasoned flyer from Gujarat.The helicopter, a Bell 407 operated by Ahmedabad-based Aero Trans Service Pvt Ltd, began its journey at Sahastradhara helipad in Dehradun early on Thursday morning. It dropped off a group of pilgrims at Kharsali near Yamunotri. After refuelling and preparing for the next phase, it lifted off from Kharsali with its second batch of passengers — bound for Harsil, from where pilgrims are taken to the Gangotri shrine.The crash happened at a time when the India Meteorological Department had issued a weather alert for May 7 and 8 in Uttarkashi district.However, what happened between take-off and the crash is still unclear. Initial accounts suggest the aircraft, nearing Harsil, veered off course and lost altitude suddenly. It struck the hillside near the Gangnani Nagraja temple and tumbled down an almost 250-metre gorge.Within minutes of the crash, villagers, many of whom had seen or heard the impact, alerted authorities. Personnel from the Army, Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP), State Disaster Response Force (SDRF), National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), and Uttarkashi police soon reached the site for a rescue operation.Two helicopters stood by at Bhatwari helipad, which had been activated immediately for emergency use.Vinod Kumar Suman, secretary of disaster management and rehabilitation, said that the state’s emergency operations centre used geolocation data to pinpoint the crash site.Aero Trans Service Pvt Ltd, which owns the chopper, operates two Bell helicopters and one Cessna aircraft as per its website. The company has not released a statement.CM Pushkar Singh Dhami issued a message of condolence and instructed district officials to extend full support to the victims’ families.But beyond official reactions, the crash has raised fresh alarm over the risks of chopper travel in the Himalayas, particularly during the highpressure Char Dham season, when demand surges and there are virtually back-to-back sorties throughout the day.","Bell 407, operated by aero trans service, crashed shortly after taking off from kharsali.
