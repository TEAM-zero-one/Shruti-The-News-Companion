"Doctor practices while suspended, Punjab Medical Council complains to cops but revokes suspension",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/doctor-practices-while-suspended-punjab-medical-council-complains-to-cops-but-revokes-suspension/articleshow/121092921.cms,"Representative image

The Punjab Medical Council (PMC) restored the licence of a surgeon who continued to practice while under suspension. This, despite having urged the police to act against the doctor on the grounds that doing so was illegal. Yet, the National Medical Commission refuses to take up the patient's complaint against this decision of the PMC.The PMC declined to reveal if the suspended surgeon fulfilled the conditions its ethics committee had recommended for him to be allowed to resume practice - a root cause analysis of the death of two patients who he operated on, and a certificate showing that he had got himself trained in laparoscopic hysterectomy .TOI asked PMC why its Dec 2024 order restoring the licence of Dr Praveen Devgan cited the high court order of Nov 20, 2024 when the court had not ordered restoration of licence. In response, it produced yet another council order dated April 25, 2025, which claimed that the decision to restore the licence was taken in the general body meeting on Sept 25, 2024 after receiving an application from Dr Devgan at the end of the six-month suspension period. PMC was mum on Dr Devgan continuing to practice during the period of suspension.""The case filed by Dr Devgan in July 2024 against his suspension was still pending on Sept 25. How did PMC take a decision to restore his licence before the court had decided the case?"" asked the complainant, Gokul Aneja, who has alleged medical negligence in the death of his wife Sunita Aneja. She was diagnosed with multiple fibroids and underwent laparoscopic hysterectomy by Dr Parveen Devgan on Oct 1, 2018.Dr Devgan's petition in HC was ""disposed of as withdrawn"" on Nov 20 last year because he had moved an application seeking to withdraw the petition. The court had neither stayed his suspension nor examined its merits.In PMC's general body meeting held on July 21, 2023 ""all the council members unanimously decided that Dr Parveen Devgan failed to demonstrate due skill and care towards patients"". PMC's final order on Dec 21, 2023, suspended his registration for six months and debarred him from practice. The order cited the ethics committee' recommendations. These included that he be restrained from performing any laproscopic procedure in his own hospital or in any other hospital till he submitted a root cause analysis of the deaths, done by a higher institute like PGI Chandigarh doing and imparting training in laparoscopic hysterectomy, and that he get trained in laparoscopic hysterectomy from a recognised institute and submit the certificate to PMC. The committee stated that Dr Devgan should be initially restrained for a minimum of six months that could be extended further till he complied with the two conditions of root cause analysis and certificate of training.When Dr Devgan applied to Fortis Hospital, Noida for training in laparoscopic hysterectomy along with other procedures in laparoscopy, the hospital informed him that he could not be trained in laparoscopic gynae procedures ""as by NMC guidelines you do not possess required qualification of post-graduation in Obs & Gynae"". ""It is unethical and unlawful for a general surgeon to do gynaecological training or procedures as he/she does not have the required qualification to do so,"" stated the hospital letter in May 2024.On receiving information that Dr Devgan was practicing despite suspension of licence, civil surgeon of Amritsar inspected the hospital on April 5, 2024, and found that he was performing operations. She informed the PMC and the police in Amritsar. The PMC urged the commissioner of police in Amritsar to take action as practising while his licence was suspended was illegal, and against the Punjab Medical Registration Act and the National Commission Act.","The punjab medical council (pmc) restored the licence of a surgeon who continued to practice while under suspension.

"'Census a step towards principle of social justice, not politics': Dharmendra Pradhan",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/census-a-step-towards-principle-of-social-justice-not-politics-dharmendra-pradhan/articleshow/121092801.cms,"Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan (File photo)

In conversation with TOI ’s Manash Gohain , Union education minister

defended

’s late but landmark endorsement of a

caste census

, calling it a ‘historic correction’ rather than a political U-turn. Rejecting Congress’s claim of a moral victory, he branded Rahul Gandhi’s celebration as ‘the peak of arrogance and bankruptcy of imagination’

Why did the PM suddenly back a caste census after years of silence - was it a strategic move or a reaction to Congress gaining

OBC

traction?

Doesn't the timing of caste census show BJP is anxious about Bihar, especially after Nitish Kumar's successful state-level survey?

Was the caste census timed to deflect attention from Pahalgam terror attack & national security lapses?

Isn't this a political U-turn to counter Congress-led INDIA bloc's growing OBC appeal ahead of 2025 state polls?

This is not sudden.BJP has always had a philosophical commitment to social harmony, social justice and affirmative action. From Jan Sangh era to Atalji and Advaniji's leadership during Mandal Commission, to today's govt under Modiji - our stance has been consistent. When VP Singh's National Front govt implemented Mandal Commission in the 1990s, BJP supported it unequivocally, standing by the principle of social justice. The PM himself belongs to an OBC community. This isn't a political response to Congress, it's a continuation of a long-standing vision.Let me remind you, in 2024 itself, the home minister said caste enumeration would be considered at the right time. That time is now. We are not reacting to Congress; we are fulfilling a national commitment. Unlike Congress, which used reservations opportunistically, we have converted our ideology into sustained policy action.That survey was part of NDA when we were in it, and we consider it an achievement. But there's a fundamental difference - that was a survey, this will be a census. A census is a constitutionally empowered exercise. Rahul Gandhi and the Congress seem unable to grasp that distinction. Our decision is not driven by electoral anxiety but by institutional process.We are creating a national framework for social justice. If anything, this reinforces BJP's seriousness about structural reforms, rather than merely responding to regional pressures.That's a completely separate issue. The Indian Army has full operational freedom, and the PM has made that clear. Security matters are being handled with utmost seriousness. Linking this with the caste census is not just disrespectful - it reveals how hollow the opposition's arguments are. We are not using social justice as a distraction. For us, it is a conviction, not a convenience.That accusation is laughable. Those who suppressed Kaka Kalelkar Commission, shelved Mandal Commission - Congress under Nehru, Indira, and Rajiv - they now want to claim credit? Rahul Gandhi should reflect on the hypocrisy of patting himself on the back for something his own party obstructed for decades. His celebration is not a moral victory; it is, frankly, the peak of arrogance and bankruptcy of imagination. This isn't a U-turn. This is BJP institutionalising what others only politicised.As education minister from a backward community, do you believe today's education system reflects caste realities - or is updated data from a census essential?n To make informed and equitable policy today, we need credible data. Social equality is a fundamental right - and that includes access to education. The caste census will provide a much-needed empirical base to understand educational disparities. You cannot address inequality without first recognising its extent. This is not just about data; it's about dignity.","Union education minister dharmendra pradhan rejects congress’s claim of a moral victory.

NEW DELHI: A high-level judicial panel, inquiring into the discovery of a huge amount of cash at the official residence of HC judge Yashwant Varma on March 14 night, in its report to CJI Sanjiv Khanna has suspected the judge’s personal staff for the mysterious disappearance of the cash.The inquiry panel comprising Punjab and Haryana chief justice Sheel Nagu, Himachal Pradesh CJ G S Sandhawalia and Karnataka HC’s Justice Anu Sivaraman recorded the statements of the judge’s private secretary and staff, security personnel posted at his residence as well as fire and police personnel on the fire incident at the Tughlaq Crescent bungalow, the official residence of then Delhi HC judge Varma.All personnel among the first responders were unequivocal that they made videos of burning cash as well as sacks of cash untouched by the leaping flames of the fire that broke out at the storeroom within the judge’s residential premises and left the place without seizing any of the cash, either burnt or unburnt.Delhi HC Chief Justice D K Upadhyay, on being informed about the incident by the Delhi Police commissioner at 4.50pm on March 15, had instructed his registrar-cum-secretary to visit Justice Varma’s residence and inspect the place of fire. On reaching the residence, he was taken to Justice Varma by the latter’s private secretary.Justice Varma took the CJ’s secretary to the room, which was adjacent to the judge’s official residence. He found that though burnt articles and debris were in the room, there was no sign of any cash, burnt or unburnt.The inquiry panel recorded that the fire service was alerted by police, who got the first call about the incident at the judge’s residence at 11.35pm on March 14.They reached the spot at 11.43pm, doused the fire and left the scene at 1.56am on March 15. The panel also found that shortly thereafter police personnel, who videographed the incident, also left the house, leaving behind the cash as it were in the room. Security personnel posted at the judge’s residence informed the panel that Justice Varma’s private secretary and personal staff stayed back. The panel said it is prima facie of the opinion that the cash disappeared from the room in the early hours of March 15 and that the fire scene was cleared of all burnt and unburnt notes, which could not have been done without the knowledge and involvement of the judge’s private secretary and personal staff.However, the panel said it would require a formal investigation to summon witnesses and record their statements, which cannot be done by the informal inquiry panel as it had not been conferred with powers to probe as per the criminal procedure code. It is to be seen whether Delhi HC initiates any disciplinary proceedings against the judge’s private secretary based on the inquiry panel’s prima facie findings.CJI Khanna had forwarded the inquiry report to Justice Varma seeking his response and with a suggestion that he should quit judgeship. Justice Varma refused to quit, forcing the CJI to send the inquiry report along with the judge’s response to the President and the PM for formal initiation of a removal motion against him.Justice Varma was repatriated from Delhi HC to Allahabad HC, his parent high court, immediately after the constitution of the inquiry panel and has been stripped of judicial work.","A high-level judicial panel, inquiring into the discovery of a huge amount of cash at the official residence of hc judge yashwant varma on march 14 night, has suspected the judge’s personal staff for the mysterious disappearance of the cash.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121092433,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-375862,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

SRINAGAR: J&K police’s State Investigation Agency (SIA) announced Sunday searches and detention of several suspects across 20 locations in all districts of south Kashmir for allegedly propagating “anti-India narrative” and engaging in “terrorist conspiracy”.SIA claimed to have busted a sleeper cell whose operatives were in direct contact with handlers in Pakistan, conveying sensitive and strategic information about security forces and vital installations.The crackdown came a day after Islamabad and New Delhi declared a pause in conflict.“Substantial incriminating materials have been seized,” the SIA said, adding the raids were carried out under UAPA Act.According to an SIA statement, preliminary investigations “clearly brought out that these entities are actively engaged in terrorist conspiracy , propagating and furthering narratives aimed not only at challenging sovereignty and territorial integrity of India but also at inciting disaffection, public disorder, and communal hatred”.Surveillance has stepped up on terror associates and over ground workers (OGWs) in Kashmir. “Technical intelligence indicated that a host of sleeper cells in Kashmir were in direct contact with their handlers in Pakistan and were involved in conveying sensitive information via messaging apps including, but not limited, to WhatsApp, Telegram, Signal and so on,” SIA’s statement read.These terror associates were also involved in spreading online radical propaganda at the behest of Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Muhammad commanders, the agency said. “SIA is steadfast in its commitment to safeguard national security and uphold public order.

SRINAGAR: A pause in military action between India and Pakistan took hold Saturday evening along LoC in Kashmir’s Uri sub-division, following days of heavy Pakistani shelling, drone attacks, and cross-border firing. However, hundreds displaced from border villages remained in shelters as security forces cleared unexploded ordnance Sunday.J&K police urged evacuees not to return home, citing ongoing bomb disposal operations.Specialised teams are sweeping villages for unexploded shells, warning that remnants from attacks pose a serious threat.“These dangerous devices can remain active for extended periods and may detonate with minimal disturbance, posing extreme danger to untrained people,” police said in a public safety notice. “All citizens evacuated from frontline villages are advised to refrain from returning until official clearance is provided.”Operations are expected to take several days depending on weather and contamination levels. “Your safety remains our highest priority,” police added, stressing that unauthorised returns to restricted areas could lead to legal consequences.District authorities have set up temporary shelters with food, medical supplies, and essential aid. Around 15,000 people fled villages such as Salamabad, Razarwani, Gingal, Lagama, and Banday in Uri sub-division in north Kashmir’s Baramulla district. According to 2011 census, Uri’s population stands at 74,867.In Uri town, life began to stir Sunday morning. A few shops reopened and residents returned. By afternoon, authorities again instructed people to vacate. “I came early morning from Baramulla. I opened my restaurant and hoped the situation would stabilise. But in the afternoon, we were told to return,” said Abdul Rashid, a restaurant owner who spent the night back in Baramulla.Residents expressed cautious hope. “We are happy there is an agreement. We are hopeful we will return home soon,” said a Uri resident at a relief centre in Baramulla.Former CM and PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti visited shelter homes Sunday, meeting displaced residents. “We don’t know how our family was saved,” said a woman from Salamabad. “We didn’t sleep a minute Thursday night and moved to Baramulla after shells landed in our village.”Mehbooba assured families she would urge govt to provide alternative housing and compensation. “War, bullets, and shelling have stolen homes and shattered childhoods,” she said. “In tin-roofed shelters, Kashmir’s children wait — not for revenge, but for peace.”","J&k police urged evacuees not to return home, citing ongoing bomb disposal operations.

Tom Brady shares touching Mother's Day message for Gisele Bündchen and other influential women



When it comes to honoring motherhood, Tom Brady continues to set an example of grace, gratitude, and maturity. On Mother’s Day, the NFL icon opened his heart to all the women who have played pivotal roles in his personal journey — from his own mother and sisters to the mothers of his children, Bridget Moynahan and Gisele Bündchen.Tom Brady took to Instagram Stories with a touching collage that brought together key figures from different chapters of his life.Among them were his sisters, Maureen, Nancy, and Julie, all of whom have been part of his support system since his early days. But it was the inclusion of both his ex-girlfriend Bridget Moynahan and his ex-wife Gisele Bündchen that truly reflected his growth and character.With Moynahan, Brady shares his first child, Jack, born in August 2007. Despite the couple parting ways while she was pregnant, Brady has always maintained a respectful and supportive relationship with her. Similarly, his bond with Bündchen has transitioned into one of effective co-parenting. The two share two children — Benjamin, born in 2009, and Vivian, born in 2012. Although their marriage ended in 2022, their commitment to family has endured.In his tribute, Brady posted, ""Happy Mother's Day to all the incredible moms I'm so lucky to have in my life."" The slideshow he shared wasn’t just about photographs — it was about unity, shared responsibility, and an acknowledgment of the love that continues to shape their children.But the most heartfelt tribute was reserved for the woman who raised him — his mother, Galynn Brady. He honored her with powerful words on his Facebook post: ""Happy Mother’s Day to the strongest and most inspiring woman I know. Your love is the foundation of our family! You’ve faced life’s toughest challenges with grace and determination, still always putting us first. Thank you for being our rock and an example for your kids and grandkids. We’re endlessly grateful for everything you’ve done and everything you continue to be. We love you more than words can say.""While Brady was reflecting on the women in his life, Bündchen had a special celebration of her own. This marked her first Mother's Day since welcoming her newborn son with boyfriend Joaquim Valente. Her post featured a photo cradling her baby, alongside tender moments with Benjamin and Vivian. She wrote, ""To all the mothers out there, your love shapes the world in ways words can’t describe. I see you, I honor you. Happy Mother’s Day! Sending so much love your way!""In a separate post, she added, ""Sometimes, the most beautiful moments aren’t shared — they’re simply lived."" With that, she emphasized her embrace of slower, more meaningful experiences, choosing presence over publicity.In a world where family dynamics often become tabloid fodder, Brady and Bündchen have quietly led with respect and love — celebrating motherhood not just with words, but with intention. Their Mother’s Day messages this year weren’t just about celebration; they were about legacy, love, and the strength of blended families.Also Read: Why the next big F1 superstar might be American — and how James Vowles sees it happening",Tom brady shared emotional mother's day tributes.

"‘Lucknow unit will play key role in design, development of BrahMos NG’: Former CEO & MD Sudhir Kumar Mishra",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/lucknow-unit-will-play-key-role-in-design-development-of-brahmos-ng-former-brahmos-aerospace-ceo-md-sudhir-kumar-mishra/articleshow/121093591.cms,"Distinguished scientist, former director general (BrahMos), DRDO, and former CEO and MD of BrahMos Aerospace, Sudhir Kumar Mishra, in an interview with Arvind Chauhan, shared details about the BrahMos manufacturing unit in Lucknow.

Excerpts:

Why BrahMos manufacturing unit in Lucknow?

What can we expect from BrahMos manufacturing unit? Will it also produce NG version?

Will the Lucknow unit also participate in the design and development of BrahMos NG before starting its mass production?

What’s the scope of employment generation at BrahMos manufacturing facility in Lucknow?

BrahMos Aerospace already has units in Hyderabad, Nagpur and Pilani, with its headquarters in Delhi. The new Lucknow unit has been established to meet the increasing requirements of the Indian armed forces, as capacity at existing sites is already saturated.Three years ago, I met chief minister Yogi Adityanath to request land for the new unit. He asked me to survey available land and assured me that if I didn’t like it, another location would be considered.The then additional chief secretary Awanish Kumar Awasthi, who was also head of UPIEDA, showed the land and promised swift allotment.Over 200 acres were allotted within two weeks. Present leadership of Uttar Pradesh is very progressive and proactive. If you go to other states, you will realize that there are problems of land, manpower and a quick response from the administration.Initially, the Lucknow facility will roll out existing BrahMos missile to meet increased demand, but its specific purpose is to manufacture BrahMos NG (next generation) missile.The BrahMos NG will have a range of 300km, equal to the current missile, but will be significantly lighter, at 1.2 tonnes (1,200 kg) compared to the existing model’s 2,900kg.BrahMos NG would be integrated on Sukhoi 30. Currently, Su-30 can integrate only one missile, but with NG version, five missiles can be integrated: four on Light Combat Aircraft.On land and ship versions, instead of three missiles, six or eight can be packed, thanks to the reduced size. This approach maintains effectiveness while increasing numbers and reducing costs, ensuring steady supply to the armed forces.The Lucknow facility will be central to producing BrahMos NG. The missile system is under development, with the Lucknow unit participating in design, development and manufacturing. The Lucknow facility will become a major integration centre for the missile and will require a robust supply chain.Tier 1, 2 & 3 suppliers are expected to move operations to Lucknow and join the defence corridor. Industries such as the PTC industry, and many more are expected to join. These industries are spread over Noida, Greater Noida, Kanpur and other places.The facility will require mechanical, electrical, civil and software engineers, both directly and for vendors. For every 100 jobs created at the facility, about 1,000 jobs are expected to be generated through vendors, due to the supply chain ripple effect.Each engineering job in manufacturing can create up to 20 downstream jobs in transport, communication, food and support services. We projected around 400 direct jobs at the facility, which could create employment for at least 25,000 people over five years, with an expanded impact on families.The credit goes to defence minister and Lucknow MP Rajnath Singh for his support and belief in the city’s capabilities. We appreciate Lucknow’s culture which is soft and decent.","Brahmos aerospace already has units in hyderabad, nagpur and pilani, with its headquarters in delhi.

What has happened in Newark?





Newark mayor Ras Baraka was taken into custody by the federal police at an ICE detention center in New Jersey which he and his team went to visit. Alina Habba , the interim U.S. attorney for the district of New Jersey, said Baraka ""committed trespass and ignored multiple warnings from Homeland Security Investigations to remove himself from the ICE detention center. """"He has willingly chosen to disregard the law. That will not stand in this state. He has been taken into custody,"" a post on X read.Baraka wanted to close down the detention center as he claimed the ICE prison in Newark opened without permission from the city. Representatives LaMonica McIver, Rob Menendez, and Bonnie Watson Coleman were scheduled to visit the facility on Friday afternoon as part of what they called an oversight visit. ""We’re at Delaney Hall , an ICE prison in Newark that opened without permission from the city & in violation of local ordinances,"" Rep.Coleman wrote in a post on X.Ras J Baraka, a Democrat running to replace term-limited Governor Phil Murphy, has taken a strong stand against the Trump administration’s immigration policies. He has fiercely opposed the construction and operation of a 1,000-bed ICE detention center at Delaney Hall, citing missing city permits as grounds for blocking its opening. The two-story facility, located beside an Essex County jail, previously served as a halfway house until February 2025, when ICE and the GEO Group announced a 15-year, $1 billion contract to convert it into a detention center. Baraka promptly filed a lawsuit against GEO Group following the announcement.","Ras j baraka, a democrat running to replace term-limited governor phil murphy, has taken a strong stand against the trump administration’s immigration policies.
