New Delhi :

TOI

With the Supreme Court hearing a pivotal case over whether to lower the statutory age of consent for sexual activity from 18 to 16 years, activists and experts working with children or dealing with cases that fall in the domain of “consensual romantic relationships” bring into focus the various complexities and challenges the situation presents in courts and beyond for “adolescents”.At one end is a strong view that highlights the plight of boys and girls caught in such cases — putting their dignity, liberty and right to protection as teenagers at stake. On the other end are activists, who caution that attempts to change the age of consent could present a situation that could lead to misuse and enable child marriage in the garb of “romantic relationships”.In the case before SC, for instance, senior advocate and amicus curiae Indira Jaising has urged the court to read down the current legal threshold of 18, arguing that the existing provisions criminalise consensual adolescent relationships and infringe on constitutional rights.On the other hand, the Union govt has insisted that the age must remain 18 to safeguard minors from exploitation, warning that bringing down the age could undermine the country’s child protection framework.An attempt to address the complexities was also made by the Law Commission in its report on the issue in 2023. It had advised against lowering the age of consent from 18 years. It also suggested amendments in the Pocso Act to introduce guided judicial discretion by the special court in the matter of deciding on sentencing in cases involving “tacit approval” of minors between 16 and 18 years old.Swagata Raha, the founder of Enfold, a child rights NGO, has repeated her demand to decriminalise sexual relationships deemed “consensual” — by creating an exception in Pocso for those aged between 16 and 18. “We are not saying that the age of consent needs to be brought down to 16,” she told. “The current provision under Pocso, which sets the age of consent at 18, presents a situation where a romantic consensual relationship between adolescents is treated as a criminal act, on a par with sexual exploitation and rape. This is clearly damaging, and has long-term impact on the life and dignity of young people. To restore balance in law, this needs to change through the introduction of exceptions recognising consent of those above 16 years. ” At least one in four cases criminalised under Pocso is “romantic” in nature, she said, citing empirical studies based on judgments.On the other hand, Bhuwan Ribhu, founder of Just Rights for Children, warned that lowering consent will open a Pandora’s box, legitimising various forms of child rape as well as trafficking and child marriage. “The law is being misunderstood and misinterpreted in the so-called consent debate,” he said, adding, “No amendment to Pocso should be made until the current law is implemented in letter and spirit. With less than 10% conviction rate and compensation awarded in fewer than 1% of cases, the need of the hour is to implement the law before we amend it. ”Ribhu suggested that in “genuine cases” of romantic consensual relationships, with appropriate checks and balances, it was possible to ensure protection without tinkering with consent. He felt Pocso could be amended to decriminalise situations, say, where there is a history of a romantic relationship between a boy and a girl and where the latter has been consistent in her statements before child protection agencies and courts, and where there is no gang rape or prior criminal history.However, child justice and criminal lawyer Anant Asthana feels that the issue can be addressed through amendments to Pocso — to create room for judges to exercise discretion with necessary checks to protect genuine cases of romantic relationships. Drawing attention to the lack of child-friendly policing, he highlighted the need to first equip police with a protocol to deal with such cases to protect the identity of the boy and girl.Advocate and founder of Independent Thought, Vikram Srivastava, said any attempt to alter the age of consent would open the doors to misuse and increase the risk of child marriage in the garb of consent, by the parents themselves, as seen in many states. “Among socalled consensual relationships, in most cases we find they are entangled in a series of illegalities leading to elopement. Even for ‘genuine consensual relationships’, checks and procedural safeguards must be provided to filter genuine cases,” he said.Putting across the perspective of adolescents affected by such cases, Sonal Kapoor from Protsahan, which works with child survivors of abuse, said that blanket criminalisation of consensual adolescent relationships under Pocso, even when non-exploitative and rooted in mutual consent, stripped young people of voice, choice and agency.“Lowering the age of consent risks weakening protections against coercion. But keeping it rigid results in young couples being dragged through criminal trials, humiliated and dehumanised by the same laws that are meant to protect them,” she said. “The law must evolve. It must hold space for both protection of children and autonomy of young people.”","With the supreme court weighing in, a growing chorus of experts is calling for decriminalising consensual relationships even if the age of consent is not lowered.

NEW DELHI: The Election Commission in Bihar announced Friday that 99.8 per cent of voters in the state have been covered under the ongoing special intensive revision (SIR) exercise.According to the chief electoral officer (CEO), forms of more than 7.23 crores voters have been received and digitised. Their names will be published on August 1, 2025. The remaining forms and reports from Booth Level Officers (BLOs) are also expected to be completed by that date.As part of the clean-up of voter lists, 22 lakh names have been marked as deceased, 7 lakh voters were found registered in more than one place, and around 35 lakh people were either untraceable or had permanently moved away. About 1.2 lakh forms are still awaited.On July 20, a list of voters who are dead, have migrated, or didn’t submit forms was shared with 12 political parties including BJP, Congress, RJD, JD(U), AAP, CPM, and others so that they could check and raise any objections before the Draft Roll is finalised.This large-scale revision is being carried out with the help of over 77,000 BLOs, nearly 3,000 assistant officers, and more than 1.6 lakh Booth Level Agents (BLAs) representing all major parties.However, the process has faced criticism from opposition parties. Congress leader and MP Rahul Gandhi alleged that irregularities were taking place in the revision exercise in poll-bound Bihar. He said, ""the Election Commission is not functioning as the Election Commission of India. Today they made some statement. This is complete nonsense.""Chief election commissioner (CEC) Gyanesh Kumar responded strongly to the criticism. He said, ""Should we be swayed by these attacks and allow bogus votes to be cast in the name of deceased, permanently shifted, enrolled at two or more places or illegal foreign immigrants?

Friday, July 25

NEW DELHI: A stormy start marked the opening week of Parliament’s Monsoon Session, with frequent adjournments, high-pitched political confrontations, and rare bipartisan moves dominating proceedings. From the swearing-in of new members to heated clashes over national security and electoral roll revisions, both the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha remained mired in disruptions.Even as debates struggled to gain momentum, the week saw a dramatic resignation, an impeachment motion against a sitting judge, and the consensus on a special debate on Operation Sindoor from Monday.As the House convened for the day, Birendra Prasad Baishya (AGP) and Kanad Purkayastha (BJP) took oath as members of the Rajya Sabha. While this marks Baishya’s third consecutive term, it is the first for Purkayastha.Three nominated members, Meenakshi Jain, C Sadanandan Master, and Harsh Vardhan Shringla, were also sworn in. All three are serving their first term in the Upper House.The Monsoon Session commenced, with both Houses starting at 11 am, but the Lok Sabha was adjourned within 20 minutes due to opposition sloganeering. MPs demanded that Prime Minister Modi respond to US President Donald Trump’s claim about brokering a peace deal with Pakistan.Over 200 MPs (145 in Lok Sabha, 63 in Rajya Sabha) submitted a draft notice to impeach Justice Yashwant Varma in connection with a cash‑recovery controversy, marking a rare cross-party judicial accountability move. Former Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar accepted the Opposition's notice to impeach Justice Varma.In the Rajya Sabha, leader of opposition Mallikarjun Kharge clashed with Leader of the House JP Nadda over the Pahalgam terror attack and Operation Sindoor. The debate quickly escalated.Later, in an unexpected development, Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar resigned as ex‑officio Chairman of the Rajya Sabha, citing health concerns, creating a leadership vacuum in the Upper House. Rahul Gandhi (LoP, Lok Sabha) claimed he was “never allowed to speak” in the House; BJP pushed back on his allegations.Both Houses were repeatedly disrupted, with the Opposition demanding urgent debate on the Pahalgam attack, causing procedural stalemate and rendering the first few days largely unproductive.Rajya Sabha briefly considered the Carriage of Goods by Sea Bill, 2025, aimed to replace the colonial-era 1925 Act, before disruptions forced adjournment on Day 3.Protests over Bihar's Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls escalated, paralysing both Houses. Lok Sabha was adjourned till 2 pm, and Rajya Sabha till 12 noon before full-day suspension.Opposition MPs staged protests inside Parliament and at the Makar Dwar; Sonia Gandhi and others vocally criticised the roll‑revision exercise as an ""attack on democracy"".Deputy chairman Harivansh, acting in the absence of a Vice President/Chairman due to Dhankhar’s resignation, rejected around 30 adjournment notices from the Opposition.Kamal Haasan took oath as a Rajya Sabha member; six retiring MPs from Tamil Nadu were felicitated.Lok Sabha began discussions on key legislation—the Goa ST reservation bill and the Merchant Shipping Bill, 2024.Both Houses were adjourned for the day amid the continuation of the Bihar SIR uproar. Lok Sabha first recessed till 2 pm, but then suspended for the day, and Rajya Sabha was also adjourned till Monday.Opposition and government representatives reached consensus in an all‑party meeting called by Speaker Om Birla. From next Monday (starting July 28), a 16‑hour special debate on Operation Sindoor is scheduled.""We shouldn't remain in any doubt, proceedings to remove Justice Yashwant Varma will begin in Lok Sabha,"" Union parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju said on Friday.""Today, Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla called the Business Advisory Committee (BAC), and it was reiterated that we are ready for a discussion on Operation Sindoor.

As govt and opposition trade volleys over a whole range of issues, with the usual routine of ""disruptions"" in Parliament proceedings thrown in, few seem to be lamenting the absence of the loquacious former Rajya Sabha chairman.The anger in the governing quarters with him for accepting opposition-sponsored motions for removal of Justice Yashwant Varma has given way to preoccupation with who gets to succeed him as VP. Opposition, even as it leverages the dramatic episode to seek to embarrass the government, is not mourning his abrupt exit, leaving the former VP marooned in a political no man's land.At an informal meeting of INDIA bloc parties, Rahul Gandhi and other participants are known to have argued with Dhankhar, who allegedly ""tormented"" them during his three year-tenure by his ""partisanship"".As they agitate over revision of electoral rolls in Bihar, the former VP hardly seems to be a hot priority for Parliament's monsoon session, relegating the resignation saga to the bottom of their list of priorities with a handful of opposition members being sympathetic to him.NDA parties have maintained, barring PM Narendra Modi's curt post on X, a ""radio silence"" over Dhankhar's impending departure from the Vice President's Enclave. They did not even share PM Modi's "" Dhankhar ji has got many opportunities to serve the country in various capacities, including as vice president of India. Wishing him good health"", X post.While govt officials are exploring a Type-VIII bungalow to shift Dhankhar, the developments preceding his resignation suggest that he was left with no choice but to quit as BJP and its allies were preparing to bring a no-confidence motion against him a day after he accepted the notice against Justice Varma signed by 63 opposition MPs.Sources said that the way Dhankhar accepted opposition's notice against Justice Varma even after govt had decided to bring the motion in LS with the signature of members from all parties, top members of the governing alliance were perturbed and angry and responded to the ""betrayal"" by rushing to collect signatures of MPs in the Parliament office of defence minister Rajnath Singh to bring a no-confidence motion against Dhankhar in Rajya Sabha the next day. no confidence motion against the VP can be passed with a simple majority and NDA has more than the required numbers.Sources suggested a message was conveyed to Dhankhar by an RS secretariat functionary Monday that ""either quit immediately, else face no confidence motion next day."" Instead of confronting, Dhankhar reached the Rashtrapati Bhawan, handed over his resignation letter to President Droupadi Murmu and made it public through a post on X.After accepting opposition MPs' signed letter against Justice Varma and passing a ruling from the chair, Dhankhar had become ""inaccessible"" to the senior government functionaries who tried to reach him, leading them to to skip the evening BAC meeting.Sources said the notice of LS MPs seeking removal of Justice Varma was given to speaker Om Birla by a delegation of MPs led by senior BJP functionary Ravi Shankar Prasad, who scrambled after getting to know that Dhankhar had opened channels with the opposition MPs seeking a notice in the case from them.","It's 'business-as-usual' for parties, dhankhar now marooned in a political no man's land. Opposition, even as it leverages the dramatic episode to seek to embarrass the government, is not mourning his abrupt exit. Nda parties have maintained, barring pm narendra modi's curt post on x, a ""radio silence"" over dhankhar's impending departure.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122890813,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-969442,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Yes, it ensures fair representation No, it may create more division

NEW DELHI: Leader of opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi on Friday expressed regret over his inability to understand the plight of oppressed classes, saying that he ""made a mistake"" and ""didn't protect the OBCs"" like he ""should have"".Speaking at Congress' 'Bhagidari Nyay Sammelan' in the national capital, he said, ""I have been in politics since 2004...When I look back, I can see that I made a mistake. I didn't protect the OBCs like I should have...It was because I could not understand your issues in depth at that time.""""My regret is that if I had known about your (OBC) history, about your issues, even a little more, I would have conducted a Caste Census right at that time. It is a mistake I made. It is not Congress party's mistake, it is my mistake. I am going to rectify that mistake,"" he added.Gandhi's politics has centered around raising voice for the oppressed classes, especially SCs, STs and the OBCs, including a call for caste-based census.Earlier in the day, he targeted the PM Modi government of ""deliberately"" marginalizing Bahujans (SC, ST, and OBC communities) in higher education by keeping a large percentage of reserved faculty positions vacant in central universities.""The figures presented by the Modi government in Parliament are clear evidence of the marginalisation of Bahujans and institutional Manuvad. In central universities, professor posts for - ST: 83% - OBC: 80% - SC: 64% have been deliberately kept vacant. Similarly, associate professor posts for - ST: 65% - OBC: 69% - SC: 51% have also been left unfilled,"" he said in a post on X.""This is not mere negligence but a calculated conspiracy to exclude Bahujans from education, research, and policy-making.The lack of adequate participation of Bahujans in universities ensures that the issues faced by marginalised communities are deliberately excluded from research and discourse.Under the guise of NFS (Not Found Suitable), thousands of qualified SC, ST, and OBC candidates are being declared unfit due to Manuvadi ideology, and the government refuses to take any accountability.This is utterly unacceptable. All vacant posts must be filled immediately—Bahujans deserve their rights, not Manuvadi exclusion,"" he added.","Gandhi's politics has centered around raising voice for the oppressed classes, especially scs, sts and the obcs.

Reviewing terror financing mechanisms, agencies were directed to unearth terror modules by analysing inputs pertaining to financial irregularities.

You both must make an effort to restore ties: SC to couple

NEW DELHI: In a joint family, a man giving more importance to his mother than his wife is often a trigger for discord. But for amicable resolution of disputes, the apex court Friday advised one such man to hear out his wife's view and respect her sentiments too.Though the couple in question, now living separately, hinted that there was no possibility of their living together, a bench of Justices B V Nagarathna and K V Viswanathan asked them to sort out their differences through mediation and give a fresh try to their relationship for the sake of their two children - a minor son living with his mother and an elder daughter living with her grandmother as the father is in the US.""Take back your wife and children. Be a responsible father. Both of you must make an effort to restore your relationship,"" the bench told the couple, both of whom were present in court through video conferencing.As the woman and her husband kept blaming each other - the man alleging that a false criminal case was lodged against him and the woman claiming that she was not being taken care of - the bench said they should focus on the interests of the children instead of fighting it out.When the man kept referring to his mother during the hearing, Justice Nagarathna hinted that many family disputes arose when the wife is not given her due importance.""Mother's words are considered weightier than wife's and that creates a problem. Grow up. We are not telling you to keep your mother aside but talk to your wife also,"" the bench told the manAs the husband submitted that he had not seen his son even once since the child was living with his mom, the court immediately asked her to bring the child in front of the camera but she said that he had gone to school. The court then directed her to show the child to his father during mediation. ""Imagine a child who had not seen his father and sister. Do not do this.

While the prevailing view is that BJP will pick one from its ranks, perhaps an OBC like, say, Harivansh, a JDU MP is also being talked about as a probable for the trust he has built with the govt in his nearly seven-year term as Rajya Sabha deputy chairman.The vice president is the ex-officio Chairman of the Upper House, a key position in shaping Parliament's proceedings and thus guiding the govt's agenda. With assembly polls set to be held in Bihar in Oct-Nov and in key states like West Bengal, Tamil Nadu and Kerala besides Assam next year, electoral considerations are expected to play a role in the choice of the candidate as well.Meanwhile, Election Commission on Friday appointed the secretary general of Rajya Sabha as the returning officer for election to the office of vice-president.","The election commission has formally set in motion the process of electing the next vice president by appointing a returning officer for the purpose.
