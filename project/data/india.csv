"Punjab couple made Rs 3,500 crore selling cloud space; remanded in ED custody",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/punjab-couple-made-rs-3500-crore-selling-cloud-space-remanded-in-ed-custody/articleshow/118668964.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: A couple arrested by ED from Punjab on Friday, who had masterminded a multi-level marketing fraud by duping investors with promises of handsome rental value on purchase of cloud space & leasing it back, has been remanded in ED custody.On Saturday, a special PMLA court in Jalandhar remanded Sukhvinder Singh Kharour to 10 days and Dimple Kharour to five days in ED custody. They allegedly collected over Rs 3,500 crore in past 2-3 years and siphoned off the ""proceeds of crime"".Look out notices were issued after they went underground. At least 26 luxury cars worth Rs 80 crore (belonging to the couple) were seized by ED last month. ED also attached other assets in Punjab, totalling Rs 178 crore.""The cloud sale and lease back model was found non-existent to cheat the investors. The proceeds of crime of Rs 3,558 crore (ascertained so far) generated out of criminal activities were diverted by VMSL (Vuenow Marketing Services Ltd) and group companies in giving commission to channel partners, purchase of various luxurious vehicles, gold and diamonds, routing of hundreds of crores through shell entities and further investment in properties,"" ED said.The accused created multiple shell entities to siphon off proceeds of crime. Huge funds were also diverted into bank accounts of Dimple and to film production units controlled by her, such as Kharour Films LLP, Fruitchaat Entertainment Pvt and Avni ITInfra Ventures Ltd, in which she is a director. However, these companies do not have any relation with the cloud particle business VMSL that collected huge funds from investors, the agency said.ED was on the lookout for the influential couple who had evaded arrest in Punjab for a long time despite several complaints of cheating and fraud. The central agency finally registered an FIR in Noida and with the help of UP Police issued a look out notice. Officials coordinated with international enforcement agencies that helped in tracing the accused in Nepal from where they were sent to India. ""Sukhvinder, CEO and founder of Vuenow Group is 'mastermind' of the scam who in connivance with his close aides orchestrated the 'Cloud Particle Scam',"" ED said.","A court in jalandhar remanded sukhvinder singh kharour to 10 days in ed custody.

CBI summons 11 cops in RG Kar rape-murder case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cbi-summons-11-cops-in-rg-kar-rape-murder-case/articleshow/118668413.cms,"KOLKATA: CBI has summoned 11 Kolkata cops for questioning on Monday and Tuesday in connection with its probe into criminal conspiracy and destruction of evidence in the RG Kar rape-and-murder case.This comes two days after the slain 32-year-old PGT intern's parents took their complaint of ""a slow-paced and ineffective probe"" to CBI director Praveen Sood.On Jan 20, a sessions court in the city had sentenced civic volunteer Sanjay Roy to life imprisonment for the crime. A city court is hearing a related case in which former RG Kar principal Sandip Ghosh and former local Tala OC Abhijit Mandal had been arrested, but were later granted bail because CBI filed no chargesheets against them within the statutory 90-day period.Sources said the cops summoned now were mostly manning RG Kar's police outpost, while some were at the local Tala police station on Aug 9 and Aug 10 last year. The trainee doctor was raped and killed on Aug 9, following which massives protests by doctors and citizens erupted in the city.CBI has questioned several Kolkata cops earlier, including senior officers who were part of an SIT that probed the crime before the central agency was handed the case by the high court. Several of these officers had deposed in court in the just-concluded trial.The victim's parents have, however, been vocal about alleged CBI lapses, from lack of cooperation to shoddy probe.","Cbi has summoned 11 kolkata cops for questioning in the rg kar rape-and-murder case.

For 21 days, voices of Kerala's ASHA workers have echoed outside state secretariat -26,140 women demanding three months' unpaid wages and a raise from their paltry Rs 7,000 monthly honorarium. ""Every payment comes after a strike,"" said S Mini, vice president of Kerala ASHA Health Workers' Association.

"State polls set to pit INDIA allies against each other, hit unity",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/state-polls-set-to-pit-india-allies-against-each-other-hit-unity/articleshow/118668358.cms,"Congress sources said while there is no view against an INDIA bloc meeting, there is no agenda at hand to hold one either

NEW DELHI: Amid growing concerns over unity of opposition INDIA bloc in the wake of BJP's political victories, a push from a section that it should revive its sense of purpose as during 2024 Lok Sabha elections is meeting with strong roadblocks. The main hurdle in getting the alliance together to convey a joint resolve is said to be the coming elections which will see INDIA bloc parties take on each other as rivals. Congress sources said while there is no view against an INDIA bloc meeting, there is no agenda at hand to hold one either, while coordination between the allies in Parliament is going well, as witnessed during the last two sessions. ""If any immediate agenda crops up, there can be a get together, but presently there is none,"" sources said.However, sources in non-Congress alliance parties said three elections lined up in 2026 and 2027, for which preparations have started, are creating complications, and political dissonance among allies will only get shriller with time. ""They have made the situation complex for greater show of unity and purpose,"" an INDIA bloc member said.Assembly elections in Bengal are scheduled for early 2026, followed by those in Kerala in mid-2026, and in Punjab in early 2027. If an alliance does not fructify between TMC and Congress in Bengal, the state battle will have three allies, including Left, fighting against each other. It was Congress and Left which contested as a marginal bloc against TMC in 2021, while TMC and BJP slugged it out as the main players.Besides, Congress and AAP will be main opponents in AAP-governed Punjab, continuing the face-off between the two in the Delhi elections in Feb, which BJP won. Then, Congress and Left will be the main rivals in Left-ruled Kerala.While Congress, CPM-led Left and TMC faced-off against each other in Lok Sabha polls too, AAP had tied up with Congress. Many believe holding a joint political show at this moment will undercut their posturing as fierce rivals on their home turfs. ""It is the reason why I feel it would be difficult to hold an INDIA meeting,"" an opposition member said.The opposition platform, cobbled ahead of Lok Sabha polls, came together seamlessly and ensured a state-wise seat-sharing formula that helped the allies challenge BJP and perform better than expected in the polarisation-propelled contest.But the bloc has since lost its unity, with allies sparring politically, and also fighting against each other in elections, as was the case in Haryana and Maharashtra polls. Renewed BJP upsurge has led to many opposition parties emphasising the need to bring about fresh cohesion in INDIA bloc.",There are growing concerns over unity of opposition india bloc in the wake of bjp's political victories.

NEW DELHI: In a significant blow to international drug cartels , Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) secured convictions in a dozen cases across country in first two months of the year.The convictions have resulted in 29 hardcore drug traffickers being found guilty, Union home minister Amit Shah said Sunday.In a post on X, Shah said, ""Modi government is unsparing in punishing drug traffickers who drag our youth into the dark abyss of addiction for the greed of money. As a result of a foolproof investigation with a bottom-to-top and top-to-bottom strategy, 29 drug traffickers have been convicted by the court in 12 different cases across India. We pledge to continue combating the drug menace with ruthless and meticulous investigations to build a drug-free Bharat.""The convictions happened in Ahmedabad, Bhopal, Dehradun, Delhi, Hyderabad, Indore, Kolkata and Lucknow between Jan and Feb.Convictions under Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act are challenging to secure due to stringent requirements of proof and need to establish culpability beyond reasonable doubt. "" NDPS Act mandates that prosecution prove the accused's guilt through credible search and seizures besides clear links, which can be difficult to obtain, especially in cases where the accused may have taken steps to conceal their involvement,"" an officer said. Further, the Act's emphasis on need for corroborative evidence, such as witness testimony or forensic analysis, makes it harder to secure convictions.The cases where convictions happened involved seizure of narcotics, including charas, ganja, heroin and opium. The convicted individuals were sentenced to rigorous imprisonment ranging from one to 15 years, along with fines.According to NCB, in Ahmedabad, three individuals were convicted and sentenced to 14 years of rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs 1 lakh each for possessing 23.8kg charas. In Bhopal, four individuals were convicted and sentenced to 12 years of rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs 2 lakh each for trafficking 123kg ganja.In Chandigarh, two individuals were convicted and sentenced to three years of rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs 10,000 each for attempting to transport 438g opium to Canada. A Zimbabwean national was convicted and sentenced to 11 years of rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs 3 lakh for possessing 2.9kg heroin in Kochi.","Convictions have resulted in 29 hardcore drug traffickers being found guilty.

BHOPAL: Madhya Pradesh minister Prahlad Patel has sparked a controversy by equating public demands and petitions to govt with ""begging"". At a function in Rajgarh district on Saturday, panchayat and rural development minister Patel said this ""army of beggars"" is weakening society.""People have developed a habit of begging from govt. Politicians come, they get a basketful of papers. They are garlanded on stage and a letter is put in their hands. This is not a good habit. Instead of taking, develop the mindset of giving. You will be happy and will build a cultured society. Gathering an army of beggars does not strengthen society, but weakens it. The attraction towards free things is not a mark of respect for these brave women,"" Patel, a former Union minister, said after unveiling a statue of Rani Avantibai Lodhi at Suthaliya town.""Can you name any martyr who has ever begged? Despite this, we continue to organise programmes, make speeches, and move on,"" Patel said, adding that as a ""Narmada Parikrama pilgrim"", he has asked for alms, but never for himself. Videos of his speech were shared on social media, triggering sharp criticism from opposition Congress.PCC president Jitu Patwari posted on X: ""Residents of the state, arrogant BJP is now calling the public beggars! This is an insult to the hopes and tears of those in sorrow! They make false promises during elections and then backtrack. When people remind them of their promises, they call them beggars. Remember them well, many such faces of BJP will come to your doorstep again in some time, begging for votes.""In another post he wrote, ""... If BJP calls a demand for rights begging, then the public must consider how those who beg for votes dare to openly call them beggars. If those who beg for votes and remain in power as traders of authority can call the public beggars, it would be a historic insult to public opinion! If those who pretend to be the 'chief servant' remain silent this time, then the public will have to prepare their own bitter pill for their pain.""Leader of opposition Umang Singhar said, ""It is duty of government and its ministers to serve the public.

Mumbai Special Court: Mumbai special court orders FIR against former Sebi chief and officials over listing irregularities and 'regulatory oversight',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mumbai-special-court-orders-fir-against-former-sebi-chief-and-officials-over-listing-irregularities-and-regulatory-oversight/articleshow/118663697.cms,"Representative image (Picture credit: ANI, IANS)

MUMBAI: A special Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) court in Mumbai on Saturday directed the agency to file a first information report (FIR) against former Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) chief Madhabi Puri Buch and five other public service officials, including three current whole time members of Sebi and two officials of the BSE.The order is for a probe into alleged irregularities in granting listing permission to a company on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) in 1994 and alleged failure to exercise regulatory oversight . The complainant invoked various IPC offences and the Prevention of Corruption Act for suspected offences of criminal misconduct by public servants and illegal gratification.The February 1 order by Special Judge S E Bangar said, “There is prima facie evidence of regulatory lapses and collusion, requiring a fair and impartial probe.”Sebi, in a statement on Sunday, said it would be initiating appropriate legal steps to challenge this order and remains committed to ensuring due regulatory compliance in all matters.The court order was in response to a private complaint filed by one Sapan Shrivastava . He said he is a media person and was seeking directions for the registration of an FIR and probe against Buch, 60, and others. The others include Ashwani Bhatia, Ananth Narayan, Kamlesh Varshney—all three whole time members of Sebi, and Pramd Agarwal, Chairman and Public Interest Director (BSE), and Sundararaman Ramamurthy, MD and CEO, BSE.The court said it would monitor the investigation.On Sunday, Sebi also stated, “Even though these officials were not holding their respective positions at the relevant point of time, the court allowed the application without issuing any notice or granting any opportunity to Sebi to place the facts on record.”The application before the court sought probe into “alleged offences committed by the proposed accused involving large-scale financial fraud, regulatory violations, and corruption.” The court noted that the allegations pertain to the fraudulent listing of a company on the stock exchange with the active connivance of regulatory authorities, particularly Sebi, without compliance under the Sebi Act, 1992, and rules and regulations thereunder.The complainant alleged that Sebi officials failed in their statutory duty, facilitated market manipulation, and enabled corporate fraud by allowing the listing of a company that did not meet the prescribed norms.Shrivastava, a Dombivali resident, arguing in person, said despite approaching the police station and regulatory bodies “on multiple occasions no action has been taken, necessitating judicial intervention under Section 156(3) CrPC (criminal procedure code).” The section empowers the court to direct police to take action if a cognizable offence is made out.The order noted that the “allegations disclose a cognizable offence, necessitating an investigation.”The court said the complaint alleged “procedural lapses and noncompliance in the IPO process, leading to an irregular listing of the company” and cited documents, also “placed on record,” “Regulatory filings and stock market reports indicating artificial inflation of share prices and market manipulation.”The special court analysed the law and referred to the Supreme Court ruling of 2015, which set out that a private application must be supported by an affidavit ensuring due diligence and the “Magistrate must be satisfied that a prima facie case exists before directing an investigation.” The court, on reviewing the material before it, also observed that the “inaction by law enforcement and Sebi necessitates judicial intervention.”The Judge said, “Considering the gravity of allegations, applicable laws, and settled legal precedents, this court deems it appropriate to direct an investigation under Section 156(3) CrPC.”The court said thus, “The concerned Anti Corruption Bureau, Worli, Mumbai Region, Mumbai is directed to register an FIR under the relevant provisions of IPC, Prevention of Corruption Act, Sebi Act, and other applicable laws.”The BSE in a statement on Sunday evening said it is initiating necessary and appropriate legal steps after seeing the special court order.The statement issued by BSE said the company mentioned in the order is ""Cals Refineries Ltd.'' listed in 1994 when officials named in the plea were ""not in their respective positions...and were not connected with the company at all.'' BSE said, ""The application is frivolous and vexatious.''Like Sebi, BSE too said no notice was issued to it nor was it given an opportunity to place facts on record.It said, ""BSE is initiating necessary and appropriate legal steps in this regard. As a responsible market institution, BSE remains committed to upholding regulatory compliance and ensuring transparency''",The order is for a probe into alleged irregularities in granting listing permission to a company in 1994. The complainant invoked various ipc offences and the prevention of corruption act. The court order was in response to a private complaint filed by one sapan shrivastava.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118663756,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-775875,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
Karnataka to see 'rotational CM'? MLA claims Shivakumar will take over in December,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/karnataka-to-see-rotational-cm-mla-claims-shivakumar-will-take-over-in-december/articleshow/118665774.cms,"NEW DELHI: Congress MLA Basavaraju V Shivaganga on Sunday claimed that deputy chief minister D K Shivakumar will ascend to the position of chief minister by December. He predicted that Shivakumar would continue as chief minister for 7.5 years from December, anticipating the party's success in forthcoming Assembly elections.""Write it down, it will happen by December. I can also write and give it to you in blood if you want, that he (Shivakumar) will become CM by December. If he takes charge in December, he will run the administration, including the next five-year term too, so by and large, he will be CM for 7.5 years,"" Shivaganga said.When questioned about a potential power-sharing agreement, the Channagiri MLA highlighted Shivakumar's party contributions, noting his role in improving the party's performance in both Lok Sabha and Assembly elections.""He (Shivakumar) has made history. He has organised the party, invested his resources, and sacrificed a lot for it. His silence or composure should not be mistaken for weakness. The high command is aware of everything, and I am a hundred per cent sure he will be CM by December,"" he said.Discussions within Karnataka's political circles, particularly in the ruling Congress, suggest a possible leadership transition later this year under a ""rotational chief minister"" arrangement.Shivakumar, currently serving as Karnataka Congress president, has openly expressed his aspirations for the chief minister's position.Shivaganga declared his steadfast support for Shivakumar, committing to back any decision the leader makes.""If he (Shivakumar) doesn't get justice, then being in the Congress party is pointless. It is because of his organisational efforts that 75-80 of us were newly elected. He is essential for the party, and we are confident that the high command will make him CM,"" he added.The MLA assured that Shivakumar's elevation to CM would occur through Congress' own strength. ""It is our right. We will demand it, and the high command will recognise his efforts,"" he maintained.After Congress' victory in May 2023 Assembly elections, Siddaramaiah secured the CM position while Shivakumar accepted the deputy chief minister role, following intense competition between them.Although reports indicated a ""rotational chief minister"" arrangement where Shivakumar would take over after two-and-a-half years, the party has not officially confirmed this agreement.Shivaganga requested the high command to control cooperation minister K N Rajanna's public criticism of Shivakumar. ""He is causing embarrassment to the party and the government. I urge the high command to take action against Rajanna,"" he remarked.Rajanna, aligned with Siddaramaiah's faction, maintains that the current CM will complete the full five-year term.","Congress mla basavaraju v shivaganga claims d k shivakumar will ascend to the position of chief minister by december.

Only we ( Devendra Fadnavis and I) have changed roles. But yes, Ajit Dada's role is constant...We have started many projects which were stopped by the MVA government.

Private medical colleges are saving crores of rupees by either not paying stipends to MBBS interns and resident doctors or paying them a fraction of what government medical colleges pay. According to the National Medical Commission (NMC), the data on stipend payment submitted by colleges showed that 60 (33 govt colleges and 27 private ones) were not paying MBBS interns any stipend.Most private colleges have not even submitted the information on how much stipend is being paid. After initially threatening to take action, in the face of colleges not even submitting data sought from them, the apex regulator, the NMC, has passed the buck to state authorities.Thousands of MBBS students doing clinical duties during the final year internship are being paid less than the national floor minimum wage of Rs 5,300 per month according to the data submitted to Supreme Court by NMC. Data from 20 private colleges shows that they pay Rs 5,000 or less. Many colleges have admitted that they do not pay any stipend. Though this information was available to NMC in July last year, no action has been taken against any college.The NMC’s PG Medical Education Regulation 2023 stipulate that private colleges have to pay a stipend equivalent to what government colleges of the state pay resident doctors. However, the NMC (Compulsory Rotating Medical Internship) Regulations, 2021 are vague about how much MBBS interns should be paid. They state that ""all interns shall be paid stipend as fixed by the appropriate authority applicable to the institution/University or State"". Taking advantage of this, many private colleges pay MBBS interns a pittance.“I had alerted the health ministry to the vague wording in the clause regarding stipend for MBBS interns in 2022, when the draft was put up for comments from the public, and later raised objections when the suggestion was not incorporated. I had requested them to amend the clause to make it mandatory for all colleges to pay stipend at par with government medical colleges of the particular state. Neither the health ministry nor the NMC has done anything about it,” said Dr KV Babu, an RTI activist who has been pursuing the issue over five years.The stipend paid by some private colleges is as low as Rs 2,000 per month though they take several lakhs as fees per year. For instance, in Andhra Pradesh, government colleges pay MBBS interns Rs 22,500 per month. However, many private colleges are paying just Rs 2,000-5,000 as stipend per month. The tuition fee alone for the MBBS course in these private colleges is Rs 65 lakh for management quota students and over Rs 1.2 crore for NRI quota students. Most of these colleges with about 150 seats each would have had to spend roughly Rs 4 crore per year if they paid stipend equal to what government colleges are paying. By paying the interns a pittance, a college could save over Rs 2 crore or more each year, even as they collect around Rs 50 crore just from tuition fees.Similarly, in Karnataka, MBBS interns in state government colleges are paid a stipend of Rs 30,000 per month. But many private colleges are paying just Rs 10,000-12,000, while their annual tuition fees for management and NRI seats could be as much as Rs 25 lakh to Rs 45 lakh per year. In Pondicherry, while government colleges pay Rs 20,000 as stipend, a deemed university medical college with 250 seats, where annual tuition fees are Rs 25 lakh, pays just Rs 5,000. The college earns over 1.2 crore from each MBBS student, but spends less than one lakh rupees on stipend for each student.There is wide variation even in the stipend paid in government colleges from about Rs 35,000 in Assam to just Rs 12,000 in Uttar Pradesh. This is despite a long-standing demand of MBBS students for the amount to be centrally fixed and made mandatory for all colleges whether government or private. NMC was not even acting on the issue of non-payment of stipend till the Supreme Court categorically stated that paying stipend was mandatory. The case drags on as NMC claims to be struggling to get data from medical colleges. Instead of asking colleges, which are under its direct control, the NMC has been writing innumerable letters to the directorate of medical education of various states asking them to submit the data from all colleges on payment of stipend.NA- not applicable since the state may not have a private college, or a govt college in the case of SikkimNo info- the information has not been submitted by the state/college*only one college has given data and the amount is wrong since Haryana revised the stipend to Rs 17,000 in 2018 and last year it was revised again to Rs 24,310.States which had not submitted any information included Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Manipur, Nagaland, and the union territories of Chandigarh and Andaman and Nicobar Islands. The stipend in govt colleges in Rajasthan is Rs 14,000, in Jharkhand it is Rs 17,000, Rs 15,900 in Chhattisgarh and almost Rs 14,000 in Madhya Pradesh.Source: Affidavit filed by the NMC in court in July 2024","Data from 20 private colleges shows that they pay rs 5,000 or less.

MUMBAI: A special court here has directed the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) to register an FIR against former Sebi chairperson Madhabi Puri Buch and five other officials in connection with alleged stock market fraud and regulatory violations . ""There is prima facie evidence of regulatory lapses and collusion, requiring a fair and impartial probe,"" the special ACB court judge, Shashikant Eknathrao Bangar, said in the order passed on Saturday.The court said it will monitor the probe, and sought a status report (of the case) within 30 days.The court order also noted that the allegations disclose a cognisable offence, necessitating an investigation.The inaction by law enforcement (agencies) and the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) necessitates judicial intervention under the provisions of the CrPC (Criminal Procedure Code), it added.The complainant, a media reporter, had sought an investigation into the alleged offences committed by the proposed accused, involving largescale financial fraud , regulatory violations and corruption.The allegations pertain to the fraudulent listing of a company on the stock exchange with the active connivance of regulatory authorities, particularly the Sebi, without compliance under the SEBI Act, 1992 and rules and regulations thereunder.The complainant claimed that the SEBI officials failed in their statutory duty, facilitated market manipulation, and enabled corporate fraud by allowing the listing of a company that did not meet the prescribed norms.Despite approaching the police station and regulatory bodies concerned on multiple occasions, no action has been taken by them, the complainant said.The court, after considering the material on record, directed the ACB Worli, Mumbai Region, to register an FIR under relevant provisions of the IPC, Prevention of Corruption Act, SEBI Act, and other applicable laws.India's first woman Sebi chief Buch, who faced conflict of interest allegations by the US-based short-seller Hindenburg and also political heat thereafter, completed her three-year tenure on Friday.Although, Buch in her tenure made significant strides in areas like faster settlements in equities, enhanced FPI disclosures and increasing mutual fund penetration through Rs 250 SIP, the last year of her tenure saw heightened controversy, when she battled a series of allegations by Hindenburg and the Congress party, while simultaneously dealing with in-house employee protests against ""toxic work culture"".In August last year, Buch faced pressure to resign after the Hindenburg Research accused her of having conflict of interest that prevented a thorough examination of manipulation and fraud claims at the Adani Group.Hindenburg accused Madhabi Puri Buch and her husband Dhaval Buch of investing in offshore entities that were allegedly part of a fund structure in which Vinod Adani -- the elder brother of Adani group founder chairman Gautam Adani -- also had investments.Buchs have denied the allegation, saying the investments were made before she joined the regulator and she had complied with all disclosure requirements.Hindenburg recently announced shutting down its business.",A special court has directed the anti-corruption bureau (acb) to register an fir against former sebi chairperson madhabi puri buch and five other officials.

KOLKATA: The ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) in West Bengal said Sunday's statement by the Election Commission that duplicate numbers do not necessarily imply fake voters backed its claims about the inclusion of non-resident voters in the state's electoral list to help a particular party. Amid reports flagging issuance of identical voter card numbers to electors in two different states, the EC in a statement said while elector photo identity card (EPIC) numbers of some voters ""may be identical,"" other details such as demographic information, assembly constituency and polling booth are different.""Irrespective of the EPIC number, any elector can cast a vote only at their designated polling station in their respective constituency in their state or Union territory where they are enrolled in the electoral rolls and nowhere else,"" the EC said.TMC state general secretary Kunal Ghosh told reporters that the EC's statement ""confirms our claims that there are names in the electoral list which had been included after conclusion of previous polls. This is aimed at helping BJP get more votes.""""These names don't tally with the list of permanent residents of a constituency and are aimed at helping the ruling party at the Centre.
