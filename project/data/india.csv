Kashi Tamil Sangamam 4.0: 300 Varanasi Students To Visit Tamil Nadu As Centre Expands Tamil Outreach

NEW DELHI: Even as the Centre and the DMK-led Tamil Nadu govt continue to spar over education-related issues, the fourth edition of Kashi Tamil Sangamam (KTS) marks a significant expansion of the Union govt's Tamil language outreach with two major initiatives - sending 300 college students from Varanasi to Tamil Nadu for immersive Tamil learning and bringing 50 Tamil teachers to Varanasi schools to teach spoken Tamil.Officials maintain that the push remains culturally anchored and aimed at strengthening India's linguistic traditions.KTS 4.0 will open at NaMo Ghat on Dec 2, coinciding with Karthigai Deepam on Dec 4. More than 1,500 delegates from Tamil Nadu will participate in an eight-day programme featuring knowledge-sharing sessions, cultural events and heritage visits to Kashi Vishwanath temple, BHU, Sarnath, Hanuman Ghat and Ayodhya temple. The theme - ""Let Us Learn Tamil or Tamil Karkalam"" - reinforces the idea of Indian languages as part of a shared civilisational fabric.What makes this year's edition notable is the Centre's scaling-up of Tamil-learning programmes at a time when its relationship with Tamil Nadu govt remains strained over NEET, the three-language policy and centralisation of education regulation. Officials say the reciprocal model - Tamil teachers in Uttar Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh students in Tamil Nadu - is intended to deepen ""people-to-people connections."" Under the Tamil Karkalam campaign, 50 teachers from Tamil Nadu will begin spoken Tamil classes across 50 Varanasi schools from Dec 2 to Dec 15, reaching 1,500 students.The inaugural batches arrive on Dec 1.In return, 300 college students from Varanasi will travel in 10 batches to Tamil Nadu between Dec 17 and Dec 30. After an orientation at Central Institute of Classical Tamil in Chennai, they will be placed across nine host institutions, including IIT Madras, Central University of Pondicherry, Gandhigram Rural Institute and Sastra University.A senior official with the ministry of education said the dual initiatives would ""take Tamil learning beyond symbolic engagement to structured classroom exposure.""""KTS 4.0 celebrates India's knowledge traditions by making language a living bridge,"" said the official, adding, ""When Tamil teachers teach in Kashi and students from Varanasi learn Tamil in its native soil, we are renewing the shared heritage and ancient currents that have linked the two regions for centuries.""The Sage Agastya Vehicle Expedition (SAVE) - tracing ancient Tamil-Kashi linkages from Tenkasi to Varanasi - will also be launched on Dec 2, highlighting civilisational ties shaped by the Chera, Chola, Pandya, Pallava and Chalukya dynasties. It will conclude in Varanasi on Dec 12. Four allied events under Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat will run alongside the Sangamam.","Kashi tamil sangamam 4.0 will open at namo ghat on dec 2, coinciding with karthigai deepam on dec 4.

Groundwater recharge sees marginal increase this year,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/groundwater-recharge-sees-marginal-increase-this-year/articleshow/125667455.cms,"Our govt prioritises water governance in its policies: PM Modi

NEW DELHI: Total annual groundwater recharge in the country marginally increased in 2025 compared to last year and so did the water availability for different uses, but nearly one-fourth of the assessment units collectively continued to be in semi-critical, critical and over-exploited categories due to notable decline in recharge in Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Jharkhand, Kerala, Punjab and Jammu & Kashmir.The findings are part of the Dynamic Ground Water Resources of India, 2025 report, released by Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) this week. It shows that the annual recharge increased from 446.9 billion cubic metre (BCM) in 2024 to 448.52 BCM in 2025. However, the annual recharge this year is still less than the 2023 level of 449.08 BCM.CGWB assessed a total of 6,762 units (blocks/mandals/talukas) in 2025. It found that the over-exploited administrative units are mostly concentrated in parts of Punjab, Haryana, Delhi, western Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. The overexploitation occurred due to different reasons, including ""indiscriminate withdrawals"" of groundwater and climatic factors.Overall, 730 units (10.8%) in the country were categorised as over-exploited in 2025, indicating groundwater extraction exceeding the annual groundwater recharge. The report shows that the percentage of over-exploited, critical and semi-critical units exceeded 25% of the total units in nine states/UTs: Punjab, Haryana, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Puducherry.""In some areas of the country, good continuous rainfall and management practices like groundwater augmentation and conservation measures taken up under central and state govt initiatives have resulted in improvement in groundwater situation,"" said the report.The states that reported significant increase in groundwater recharge this year include Bihar, Chhattisgarh, MP, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Telangana and UP.Rainfall is the main source of groundwater recharge in the country. It contributes to nearly 60% of the total annual groundwater recharge. ""So, the increase in water recharge can be attributed to better monsoon rainfall this year than 2024. Good rainfall means less extraction of groundwater for farming operations,"" said an official.","Annual groundwater recharge marginally increased in 2025 compared to last year.

India is on high alert as Cyclone Ditwah continues to move north-northwest over the southwest Bay of Bengal and is expected to reach close to the North Tamil Nadu–Puducherry–South Andhra Pradesh coast by early November 30, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD). The agency has warned of heavy to extremely heavy rainfall, strong winds and the risk of urban flooding across multiple southern states as the system approaches land. The cyclone has intensified the level of alertness as it already left 123 dead and several missing in Sri Lanka.After crossing Sri Lanka, Cyclone Ditwah continues to intensify over the southwest Bay of Bengal. Earlier on Saturday, the IMD said the system was moving north–northwest and was likely to approach the North Tamil Nadu–Puducherry–South Andhra Pradesh coast by the early hours of Sunday, November 30.In its updated alert issued at 8.58 pm on Saturday, the IMD said the storm had moved nearly northwards at 10 kmph over the past six hours and, at 5.30 pm, was centred over the southwest Bay of Bengal and adjoining north Sri Lanka and Tamil Nadu coasts. It was located about 110 km northeast of Jaffna, 80 km east of Vedaranniyam, 100 km southeast of Karaikal, 190 km south-southeast of Puducherry and 290 km south of Chennai.The storm is very likely to continue moving north–northwest and reach the North Tamil Nadu, Puducherry and adjoining south Andhra Pradesh coasts by early Sunday morning. As it tracks along the coastline, the system is expected to pass the Tamil Nadu–Puducherry stretch at minimum distances of 60 km by Saturday midnight, 50 km by early Sunday morning, and about 25 km by Sunday evening.Residents have been urged to follow safety instructions and remain indoors during severe weather.In Tamil Nadu, the government has rolled out extensive precautionary measures, as it could potentially face major impact with strong wind and heavy rains already lashing parts of the state.Rain triggered by Cyclone Ditwah lashed coastal and delta districts on Saturday, with Ramanathapuram and Nagapattinam witnessing the heaviest impact. Normal life in Rameswaram remained disrupted for a second day due to continuous rain and strong winds, and a few trees were uprooted in Nagapattinam.Heavy rain and strong winds were reported across the Cauvery delta, and farmers said paddy crops over nearly one lakh acres were submerged.

""In the Delta Districts, paddy cultivation is affected due to flooding from rainwater. We expect it to drain within 2 days, and once it does, we will calculate the loss and provide compensation to farmers,"" he said.Ahead of cyclone making landfall in India after devastating Sri Lanka, Strong winds and heavy rainfall also lashed the coastal regions of Andhra Pradesh in addition to Tamil Nadu and Puducherry.The IMD has also forecast heavy to very heavy rainfall across parts of Andhra Pradesh from November 30 to December 3 under the influence of Cyclonic Storm Ditwah. The system, centred over the southwest Bay of Bengal and adjoining north Sri Lanka as of 11:30 am after moving northwards at 10 kmph, is expected to bring intense rain to Tirupati, Chittoor, Prakasam, Nellore, Kadapa and Annamayya districts.Additionally, Andhra Pradesh State Disaster Management Authority (APSDMA) managing director Prakhar Jain stated tgat isolated places in Tirupati and Chittoor districts could receive heavy rainfall through Saturday.Squally winds reaching 60 kmph, and gale winds up to 70 kmph on November 30, have also been predicted. Fishermen have been advised to stay ashore, and authorities have urged the public to remain cautious. Coastal parts of Nellore in Andhra Pradesh are already seeing rough seas, strong winds and steady rainfall.The APSDMA has urged residents in vulnerable pockets of Andhra Pradesh to remain indoors and avoid unnecessary travel during peak rainfall.Officials warned that strong winds could uproot trees, damage weak structures and harm standing crops, particularly vegetables and horticulture nearing harvest.Thunderstorms with lightning have been forecast across South Coastal Andhra Pradesh, North Coastal Andhra Pradesh and Rayalaseema from November 30 to December 3. ""Thunderstorms accompanied by lightning are likely at isolated places over SCAP, Rayalaseema, North Coastal Andhra Pradesh (NCAP) and Yanam,"" said the IMD in a press release.Railways Ministry announced that union minister Ashwini Vaishnaw checked preparedness of Southern Railway ahead of the cyclone's expectation to touch Indian land.

War Rooms at Board, zonal and divisional levels activated. Railways is closely coordinating with civil authorities and continuously monitoring the situation until normalcy returns,"" said the ministry in a post on X.Cyclone Ditwah has already left a severe trail of destruction in Sri Lanka, killing 153 people, leaving 130 missing and destroying nearly 15,000 homes. President Anura Kumara Dissanayake has declared a state of emergency as tens of thousands remain in shelters and several districts remain inaccessible.Authorities warned that heavy rains and high winds may continue due to the system’s indirect impact even after its exit.India has launched Operation Sagar Bandhu, deploying C-130 and IL-76 aircraft loaded with relief supplies, along with a naval ship that donated rations to local authorities. More rescue personnel have been pressed into action as conditions worsen in central Sri Lanka.","Cyclone ditwah continues to move north-northwest over the southwest bay of bengal.

If Shivakumar takes over midterm:

The larger question



The Karnataka power struggle, simmering for months and boiling over in the past week, took an unexpectedly choreographed turn this morning. Chief minister Siddaramaiah and his deputy, DK Shivakumar , appeared together for a breakfast meeting in Bengaluru, their first joint engagement since the renewed speculation over a midterm change of leadership. Later, the two leaders held a brief press conference, presenting a picture of unity and saying that there were ""no differences"" even as the political machinery around them remains anything but settled.Their appearance did little to quiet the central question: whether the Congress should persist with Siddaramaiah for a full five-year term or honour what many in the party believe was an unwritten 2023 understanding to hand over the chief ministership to Shivakumar at the halfway mark. If anything, the carefully staged optics, forced by the Congress high command, only underscored the stakes. The party’s largest state government is caught between two leaders who represent different regions, different caste networks and different styles of politics. Both are indispensable. Neither can be easily sidelined.Over the past week, Karnataka’s political theatre was shifted from Vidhana Soudha to New Delhi, where groups of MLAs landed to press their case with the high command.Religious seers spoke out, caste associations issued warnings and cabinet colleagues have chosen their words with increasing precision.The AICC leadership might have been able to delay the decision for now but in reality confronts a dilemma that runs deeper than personalities in Karnataka: how to preserve the delicate alliance of AHINDA voters and Vokkaliga mobilisation that gave Congress 136 seats in 2023.The power-sharing question — never confirmed, never denied — has finally arrived at its moment of reckoning. Today's show of unity may have bought time, but it has not resolved the question that will shape both the government’s stability and the party’s prospects in 2028: who should lead Karnataka for the remainder of this term, and at what political cost?The recent showdown was not merely a spat between two ambitious men. It is the product of a far deeper tension - between social coalitions and caste networks, between ideological appeal and organisational muscle, between the leader who brings votes and the one who converts those votes into victory. In Karnataka, Congress’s major bastion in the South, those forces have collided.The question is no longer simply who sits in the chief minister’s chair. It is whether Congress can hold together the coalition that delivered it 136 seats in 2023, its best performance in Karnataka’s history, or whether the cracks visible recently will widen into a full-blown rupture.When the Congress swept to power in May 2023, the celebration masked an immediate dilemma. The party had fought the election with two towering leaders - Siddaramaiah, the seasoned chief ministerial face who carried the AHINDA coalition of minorities, backward classes and Dalits; and DK Shivakumar, the state party president whose Vokkaliga influence and organisational firepower had helped dismantle the JD(S) in Old Mysuru.The question of who would lead was so contentious that party negotiators, meeting in a Bengaluru hotel for hours, were forced to engineer a delicate truce. What emerged was a dual arrangement: Siddaramaiah would become chief minister, and Shivakumar would serve as deputy CM and continue as state Congress chief.Officially, that was the end of it. Unofficially, almost everyone in Karnataka politics believed there was a rotation understanding - that Siddaramaiah would govern for 2.5 years and Shivakumar would take over for the latter half. The party never confirmed it. Neither leader openly acknowledged it.But neither denied it.This ambiguity held the coalition together - until now.To understand why this dispute has spiraled, it is important to understand the two fundamentally different power bases Siddaramaiah and Shivakumar command.Siddaramaiah, now in his late 70s, is not just another regional satrap. Born into a Kuruba OBC family and shaped by socialist politics, he crafted AHINDA (minorities, backward classes and Dalits) as a counterweight to dominant-caste politics. Over four decades, he turned it from an idea into a social bloc.AHINDA is not a single caste. It is a mosaic stretching across Karnataka - non-dominant OBCs in the north, Dalits in central districts, Muslims in urban clusters, tribals in forest belts. In 2023, they voted overwhelmingly for Congress.In many villages, Siddaramaiah is not referred to by name but as ""nam'ma manushya"" (our man). His welfare agenda, free bus travel for women, cash transfers, rice entitlements, subsidised power, deepened that connection.The Karnataka State Federation of Backward Class Communities (KSFBCC) has warned Congress that any attempt to unseat Siddaramaiah in the wake of power strife in the state will have a bearing on the party.DK Shivakumar, by contrast, emerged from the rugged, faction-ridden politics of Old Mysuru. His constituency, Kanakapura, is carved out of Vokkaliga heartland. His rise has been defined by a willingness to fight, sometimes literally, for political turf.Where Siddaramaiah speaks of social justice, Shivakumar speaks of loyalty. He is the organiser who mobilises crowds, funds campaigns, manages crises, and negotiates defections. He is also Congress’s biggest Vokkaliga face at a time when the JD(S) is weakened and the BJP is eyeing gains in the region.His win in 2023 was emphatic - 75% vote share, defeating former BJP deputy CM R Ashoka by over 1.2 lakh votes. For Vokkaligas, this proved his stature. For the Congress machine, it proved his indispensability.These two power structures, AHINDA and Vokkaliga, are not interchangeable. Congress relies on both. And that dependence is central to the present crisis.Karnataka’s 2023 electoral map revealed a kind of dualism that Congress must navigate carefully.AHINDA-heavy Kalyana Karnataka delivered a decisive win for Siddaramaiah’s brand of welfare and identity politics.Old Mysuru, where Vokkaliga votes matter, swung unexpectedly towards Congress reflecting Shivakumar’s influence and organisational discipline.Lingayat-dominant regions, long considered BJP bastions, also saw surprising gains for Congress: the party improved from 20 seats in 2018 to 42 seats in 2023.Urban Bengaluru aligned with the party’s welfare pitch, especially among women and minority voters.Senior party officials involved in the campaign often describe the 2023 victory as the result of complementary strengths: Siddaramaiah’s ability to attract votes from marginalised groups and women, and Shivakumar’s ability to translate that support into seats through booth-level management.Both contributions were essential. And both now complicate the succession question.In recent days, the focus of Karnataka politics shifted to Delhi. Legislators aligned with Shivakumar traveled to the capital to meet senior party leaders, hoping to press the case for a midterm transition. According to people familiar with the meetings, these MLAs emphasised the perceived understanding on rotation and argued that the party’s credibility depended on honoring it.Meanwhile, Siddaramaiah has clearly stated that he intends to complete a full term and his supporters have emphasised the importance of administrative continuity and safeguarding the welfare-driven political coalition that brought the party its 2023 mandate.The backdoor meetings, public remarks by leaders and final admission by party chief Mallikarjun Kharge shows how complicated the decision is.In Karnataka, religious heads of major communities play an important role in shaping political narratives. Several Vokkaliga seers publicly signaled support for Shivakumar’s claim to the chief ministership, emphasising that the community had not held the post since the early 2000s. This created additional pressure by framing the question as one of caste representation.AHINDA-aligned voices, meanwhile, conveyed concerns - either directly or through political messaging - that sidelining Siddaramaiah could weaken the social coalition that has backed Congress for over a decade. Their argument centered on stability and the electoral risks of alienating backward-class and Dalit voters.Siddaramaiah has maintained publicly that he intends to complete a full five-year term, saying earlier this year that he had been sworn in to govern for the entire duration. His position is anchored in administrative logic: major welfare programs require continuity and the party won the mandate with him as the projected chief ministerial face.Supporters of Siddaramaiah often point to the strong performance of AHINDA regions in 2023, arguing that any sudden shift in leadership could dilute the political momentum built around welfare schemes and social justice politics.Shivakumar has largely avoided direct confrontation in public, consistently saying that the party leadership would decide the matter. But his camp’s position has been clear: many MLAs believe he was central to the 2023 victory and that the understanding reached during the post-election negotiations should be upheld.In addition to his organisational strengths, the political significance of the Vokkaliga community works in Shivakumar's favour. With JD(S) weakened and BJP attempting to make inroads in Old Mysuru, elevating Shivakumar could help consolidate a valuable electoral base.The Congress's central leadership must weigh several competing risks:Congress has faced similar leadership battles in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, and eventually lost the power in these states.The Congress high command - Sonia Gandhi , Rahul Gandhi and Mallikarjun Kharge - is expected to take a decision soon. Reports suggest the timing is tied to the upcoming Parliament session and the state assembly calendar.Each scenario carries political risks that will reverberate through 2028, when Karnataka returns to the polls.The debate over succession has exposed a deeper question for Congress: Can the party manage a coalition built on two separate pillars when it must choose only one leader to represent it?Karnataka delivered Congress not just a numerical mandate, but a symbolic victory against the BJP's national dominance. It showcased a model built on welfare, caste coalition-building and organisational renewal.If Congress handles the transition smoothly, Karnataka could remain a stronghold and a template. If it mishandles it, the state could fall out of the party's hands, in a familiar cycle of its recent history.Either way, the central challenge remains unchanged:Congress must choose a leader without losing any camp.And in Karnataka, that has never been an easy choice.","Siddaramaiah, dk shivakumar project unity after high-stakes karnataka meet amid rumours of cong rift.

The Origin Of The Dispute

Muslim Chronicles on Ayodhya

Excerpt - The Ayodhya Temple-Mosque Dispute: Focus on Muslim Sources

""Babur got the mosque built after demolishing the Janmasthan and used in his mosque the stone of the same Janmasthan, which was richly engraved, precious kasauti stone, and which survives even today.""

""…a glorious mosque was built up during King Babar’s regime on the spot where Sita ki Rasoi tomb (?) is situated in Awadh.

During this Babari (dispensation) the Hindus had no guts to be a match for the Muslims.

“…all the temples of Ayodhya were turned into mosques by the Sultans of the past.”

European Account on Janmabhoomi

""Emperor Aurenzgebe got the fortress called Ramcot demolished and got a Muslim temple, with triple domes, constructed at the same place.

Others say that it was constructed by ‘Babor'...""

Account of Joseph Tieffenthaler

""However, there still exists some superstitious cult in some place or other. For example, in the place where the native house of Ram existed, they go around 3 times and prostrate on the floor. The two spots are surrounded by a low wall constructed with battlements. One enters the front hall through a low semi-circular door… On the 24th of the Tschet month, a big gathering of people is done here to celebrate the birthday of Ram, so famous in the entire India.""

Awadh was aghast. The city collapsed like a lamp about to lose its flame. Men, women and children followed him as though Ayodhya itself was walking away. They did not see a prince going to the forest, it was like something being forcefully torn away with the strings of hope that he might stay hanging loose. The moment he stepped away, the capital of the Kosala kingdom felt emptied of life. This is how Maharishi Valmiki portrays Ram’s departure for his 14-yearin Treta Yuga.The grief that filled Ayodhya in Valmiki’s verses did not stop at the edge of the forest. It travelled through centuries. It lived through kingdoms, invasions and courtrooms. It became devotion and politics. It became movements and marches. The 500-year-long Ram Janmabhoomi struggle was never just about land. It was about bringing Ram back. This time in Kaliyuga.Generations came and went, but the question survived: When will Ram Lalla return?He did return. On January 22, 2024, when the consecration ceremony of the deity was held. What was once a memory in scriptures and prayers finally took form in stone and light. The temple that had lived in longing now stands as faith fulfilled, and a civilisation reclaimed what it never stopped believing was its own.November 25, 2025, marked the final milestone with the completion of the temple and a “Dhwajarohan” event, attended by PM Narendra Modi , RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat and UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath.Addressing a gathering after the flag hoisting event on November 25, the Prime Minister stated that today the city of Ayodhya is witnessing yet another pinnacle of India's cultural consciousness.""This Dharma Dhwaja is not merely a flag, but the flag of the renaissance of Indian civilisation,"" he said, explaining that its saffron colour, the glory of the Solar dynasty inscribed upon it, the sacred Om depicted, and the engraved Kovidar tree symbolise the greatness of Ram Rajya.The story that had begun 500 years ago with the desecration under Mughal invader Babur slowly entered courtrooms, legal arguments and the political landscape. Each petition was an echo of a civilisational longing. Every verdict and every stay order became footsteps in a centuries-long journey.Ayodhya did not forget. Neither did the people who came on foot from distant villages, nor the saints who guarded the belief like a flame, waiting for the Ram Lalla's temple to rise again.The struggle took different shapes over the centuries. Mahant Raghubir Das and others filed suits not for power or land, but for the right to worship. The movement was still quiet then, but the silence was deceptive. The devotion was gathering strength!The story did not begin with courts or politics. It began in the sixteenth century when the temple at Ram Janmabhoomi was torn down, and a mosque was constructed under Babur’s general, Mir Baqi.The temple was demolished, but the faith was not. Hindus continued to worship at the site. The belief that this was Ram’s birthplace never broke. It lived through devotion, pilgrimage and collective memory.Several works in Arabic, Persian, and Urdu discussed the demolition of the Ramjanmabhumi temple and its replacement by Babri Masjid.In the book ""The Ayodhya Temple-Mosque Dispute: Focus on Muslim Sources"" by Harsh Narain, there's a mention of Al-Hind-u fi al- ‘Ahd al-Islami (India in the Islamic Era) by Maulana Hakim Sayyid Abd al-Hayy, which was translated into Urdu by Maulana Shams Tabriz Khan, under the title Hindustan Islami Ahd mein.In Tarikh-i Awadh (1919), written by Muhammad Najmul Ghani, it is stated:The Fasanah-I Ibrat, written by Rajab Ali Beg Surur in 1860, but first published in 1884, stated:Harsh Narain's work states that the Qaysar-u’t Tawarikh, which is an Urdu historical chronicle that describes the Janmabhoomi demolition and mosque construction, located the mosque in Sita ki Rasoi as well as the Janmasthan. It acknowledged,In one of the multiple accounts of foreign travellers, Joseph Tieffenthaler, the Austrian Jesuit, who stayed in India from 1743 till his death some four decades later, toured Awadh between 1766 and 1771.According to Meenakshi Jain's The Battle For Rama work, he was the first to refer to the destruction of a temple at Rama’s birthplace by a Mughal ruler. He saw Hindus worshipping a religious structure in the form of a vedi (cradle) in the premises, but said nothing about Muslims offering namaaz.He also noted the large gatherings of Hindus on the occasion of Rama Navami (Rama’s birthday). He wrote:Tieffenthaler also provided the earliest European documentation of the Hindu Janmasthan platform, which was later called “Ram Chabutra"".He futher writes:As dynasties and empires changed, the sacredness of the Janmabhoomi did not fade. The temple had fallen, but the birthplace was not forgotten. Devotion shifted to the Ram Chabutra in the outer courtyard, where pilgrims prayed, and saints kept vigil. Akharas, fairs and local traditions kept the belief alive.When the British arrived in the mid-1850s, they did not end the conflict. They fenced the site into two courtyards. Muslims offered namaz inside, while Hindus worshipped at the Ram Chabutra outside. The land had one history but two claims.In 1885, Mahant Raghubar Das filed the first suit to build a temple, but it was rejected. However, the worship continued.In 1934, clashes damaged the mosque, and the British repaired it, still avoiding the core question. The dispute remained unresolved and alive.Independence did not settle Ayodhya. In December 1949, idols of Ram Lalla were found inside the disputed structure. Authorities sealed it and declared the site disputed. The idol stayed inside, and worship continued from outside, while namaz stopped.In 1950, Gopal Singh Visharad and Paramhans Ramchandra Das filed suits seeking worship inside. More cases followed: Nirmohi Akhara in 1959 claimed management rights, and the Sunni Waqf Board in 1961 contested the property. The courts froze the status quo. The fight moved from streets to case files, petitions and orders.By the 1980s, the dispute had moved beyond the courtroom. The VHP adopted the Ram Janmabhoomi cause, and the RSS gave the campaign nationwide strength. The turning point came in 1986 when the Faizabad court ordered the gates of the structure to be opened, and the government allowed it.Within hours, darshan began, and Hindus entered after decades. Namaz did not resume. A locked shrine became an open site of worship, and the dispute that had waited behind iron bars stepped into public life.The opening of the gates in 1986 changed more than access to the temple. It changed the direction of Indian politics and public sentiment. For decades the issue had been faith and legal argument. Now it became a movement that spread into homes, streets and television screens.The telecast of Ramanand Sagar’sin 1987–88 turned the story of Ram into a national cultural moment. Families paused their Sundays to watch it. Streets emptied. Temples saw new crowds. Faith acquired momentum, and the Ram Janmabhoomi question began entering everyday life.In 1989, the VHP laid the foundation stone (shilanyas) near the disputed site with the approval of the Rajiv Gandhi government, and the issue moved further into national consciousness.The same year, the BJP officially adopted the Ram Mandir demand through the Palampur Resolution. A religious and cultural movement had now gained a clear political face.In 1990, LK Advani launched the Rath Yatra from Somnath to Ayodhya, mobilising lakhs of supporters across the country.The yatra provoked a counter-mobilisation and heightened tensions. When Kar Sevaks attempted to move towards the disputed site, the Uttar Pradesh government under Mulayam Singh Yadav ordered police firing. Several kar sevaks were killed. The movement intensified further.From late November 1992, lakhs of kar sevaks had gathered in Ayodhya under multiple Hindu organisations. The call for kar seva had built expectations thatwould happen on the ground. The events reached a climax on 6 December 1992. Crowds demolished the disputed structure, which opened a new chapter of religious, political and legal conflict.After the incident, the court cases multiplied. Commissions were formed. What began as a locked shrine had turned into one of the defining movements of modern India.After the 1992 demolition, the dispute shifted permanently into the courts. The central government acquired the site in 1993 and asked the Supreme Court to settle ownership. The title suits were transferred to the Allahabad high court, which examined archaeological, historical and documentary evidence.The 2003 ASI excavation report remains consistent with a large pre-existing structure below the demolished mosque.In 2010, the high court ruled that the land be divided among three parties, but the judgment was appealed by all sides.The case then moved to the Supreme Court, where a Constitution Bench heard extensive arguments on law, title, belief and history.In November 2019, the top court delivered its final judgment: The land was awarded for the construction of a Ram temple, and an alternative site was directed to be allotted to the Muslim side. The verdict ended the centuries-long legal battle and settled ownership of the Janmabhoomi.After the Supreme Court’s 2019 verdict awarding the disputed land for the construction of a Ram temple, plans for building began in earnest.A trust was formed to oversee development, and construction work proceeded over the next few years with architectural planning, sanctum layout, and preparations for consecration. On 22 January 2024, the new temple was inaugurated with religious ceremonies.On November 25, the ""Dwajarohan"" ceremony, hoisting the saffron flag atop the temple, reaffirmed the Mandir’s consecration and the restoration of the wounded civilisation.The long-standing legal and historical dispute thus entered a phase of physical reconstruction and symbolic closure, as devotees welcomed the final restoration of what they regard as their heritage.If one scrolls through the Ram Mandir movement wire-to-wire, the demand for the temple emerges not just as a caravan of facts and emotions, but as a testament to a faith that never faded.Those in the frontline of the movement, especially the Hindu community, continued their worship at the site, whether in the outer courtyard earlier or before the idol after 1949, sustaining an unbroken thread of devotion, which helped in healing and rekindling the oldest civilisation.","Pm modi unveils world’s tallest bronze statue of lord ram in south goa.

The RJD-led alliance, which had won 110 seats against the NDA’s 125 in 2020, managed just 35 seats this time — 25 of them from the RJD.Singh added that members of both Houses voiced “concern” over how the elections were conducted. “These were anything but free and fair. The SIR, first carried out in Bihar, remains questionable. It’s no surprise there’s so much political friction in a state like West Bengal,” he observed.He further noted that the alliance would “continue to raise its voice inside the House on issues concerning the people and confront the BJP-led coalition if it backtracks on promises made during the elections.”",Tejashwi yadav is the opposition coalition's leader in the bihar assembly.

SIR issue set to rock winter session

NEW DELHI: The all-party meeting ahead of the winter session of Parliament will be held at 11 am on Sunday, a day before the session opens.It will be followed by the Business Advisory Council meetings of both the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha at 4 pm.A meeting of the Floor Leaders of the opposition INDIA bloc will be held at 10 am on Monday in the office of Rajya Sabha Leader of Opposition and Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge.During the all-party meeting, the government is expected to seek cooperation from all political parties to ensure the smooth functioning of both the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha. The session will conclude on December 19, with several important legislations scheduled for discussion and passage during this period.Parties such as the Trinamool Congress (TMC) are expected to raise the issue of the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) exercise — and the deaths allegedly linked to it — in West Bengal and other parts of the country during the Parliament session, according to senior TMC leader Derek O'Brien.The opposition, including the TMC, which is seeking a fourth consecutive term in West Bengal when the state goes to polls in mid-2026, has been accusing the Election Commission of imposing “SIR-linked inhuman pressure” on ground staff through compressed timelines and “unworkable deadlines.”O'Brien claimed the ""accelerated"" voter-roll revision has caused fear, fatigue, and fatalities among Booth Level Officers (BLOs) and citizens. He added that the party will question why West Bengal has been subjected to the ""most intensive scrutiny,"" while several border states with similar demographics have been exempted.“Why have Tripura, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, and Manipur, all bordering countries like Bangladesh and Myanmar, been entirely exempted? Why is Assam under a lighter Special Revision? Is the real intent to challenge Bengali identity and systematically prune Bengali voters from the rolls?” O'Brien asked.Official data shows the West Bengal SIR is nearing completion, with 7.64 crore forms circulated, 82 per cent digitised, and 99.8 per cent of voters covered in the door-to-door verification drive.Phase two of the “purification” of electoral rolls — the first phase was conducted in Bihar ahead of its recently held assembly polls — began on November 4 and covers nine states, including West Bengal, and three Union Territories. The final voter list is expected to be published on February 7, 2026.","Winter session set to rock winter session with sir issue set to be raised.

NEW DELHI: Aadhaar cards will no longer be accepted as the only birth certificate or proof of date of birth in Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra.""In Uttar Pradesh, Aadhaar card s will no longer be accepted as a birth certificate or proof of date of birth. The Planning Department has issued instructions to all departments. No birth certificate is attached to the Aadhaar card; therefore, it cannot be considered a birth certificate. Amit Singh Bansal, Special Secretary of the Planning Department, issued the order to all departments. The Aadhaar card is no longer valid as a birth certificate,"" the notification read.The Maharashtra government also issued a similar order that says Aadhaar card will not be considered as a document for making a delayed birth certificate and that all birth certificates made only through the Aadhaar card after the Births and Deaths Registration (Amendment) Act, 2023, will be cancelled, a notice by the State Revenue Department said.Instructions have been given to take action against the officers who have issued these certificates till now.The 16-point verification guideline by the Revenue Department said that the orders issued by the Deputy Tehsildar after the amendment made in the Birth and Death Registration Act, 1969, on August 11, 2023, should be withdrawn, and the withdrawn order should be verified at the level of the competent authority or the District Collector.The move comes even as the Supreme Court has allowed Aadhaar to be used in a different context, like as a proof of identity during inclusion in the Bihar electoral roll. Accepting a demand of the opposition, the court directed the Election Commission to accept Aadhaar along with the 11 other documents already permitted under the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) process.Last week, Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath directed all district magistrates to take swift and stringent action against illegal immigrants.Reiterating that law and order, national security, and social harmony remain his administration’s top priorities, he said no form of illegal activity would be tolerated.“The chief minister has directed that each district administration ensure the identification of illegal immigrants living in their area and initiate action as per the rules,” the statement read,, according to news agency PTI.“The chief minister has also directed that temporary detention centres be established in each district to house infiltrators,” it added.As per the statement, illegal immigrants holding foreign citizenship will be kept in these centres until the required verification process is completed.Adityanath said those held in the detention facilities will be deported to their countries of origin following established procedures.Uttar Pradesh shares an open border with Nepal, allowing unrestricted movement for citizens of both countries, while individuals of other nationalities are subject to checks.This comes at a time when a nationwide SIR is being carried out in 12 states and union territories, including Uttar Pradesh, with the final elector's list to be published on February 7, 2026.",Aadhar cards will no longer be accepted as the only birth certificate or proof of date of birth in uttar pradesh and maharashtra.

NEW DELHI: Amid the ongoing leadership crisis in Karnataka over the chief ministerial post, veteran Congress leader M Veerappa Moily on Friday launched an attack against the party high command, saying that “discipline” has to be brought into the party.Talking to news agency IANS, the former Union minister said that the high command representatives should have foreseen some of these developments in the state.“If you want to turn it into a political turmoil, yes, it can happen, but the leaders of the Congress party who are in responsible positions, and also our high command representatives, whoever they may be, should have foreseen some of these developments. It’s not a sudden development,” Moily said.“I will not comment on who should continue, whether he should continue or whether a new Chief Minister will come or not. I am not on that. First, discipline has to be brought into the party,” he added.The Congress leader further claimed that the ongoing developments in Karnataka will party's prospects, saying that the party leadership step down.""What is going on is not in the best interest of the party. This will ruin the party's prospects,"" Moily said.""I think the Congress leadership should step down and, you know, all difficulties—people who are in charge of the states—they should be briefed from time to time about the situation here, but that is not being done. Nobody is made accountable. The people in charge of the state here, you know, are not accountable to the party at any time; accountability lies with the party,"" he added.This comes amid the ongoing tussle between Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah and his deputy DK Shivakumar over the top job in the state.The deliberation over the issue has now shifted to Delhi, as both DKS and Siddaramaiah are likely to meet Mallikarjun Kharge along with Sonia and Rahul Gandhi on November 30.Earlier, Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge played down the “internal conflict” within the party and said that the “high command” will sit together and deliberate on the issue.“Only the people there can say what the government is doing. But I would like to say that we will resolve such issues,” Kharge said.“People in the high command — Rahul Gandhi, Sonia Gandhi and I — will sit together and deliberate on this… We will give the medicine when required,” he added.This was the first acknowledgment by Kharge that there is indeed a power struggle between Siddaramaiah and his deputy DK Shivakumar in Karnataka.As soon as the Congress government in Karnataka completed its halfway mark on November 20, reports quoting Congress sources suggested that MLAs and MLCs from Shivakumar’s faction had camped in Delhi to push the party high command to make him the next chief minister.DK Shivakumar added to the speculations after he claimed that there had indeed been “a confidential understanding on leadership transition among five-six leaders” soon after Congress won a landslide in the 2023 elections.The deputy chief minister made the first reference to the power pact but stopped short of divulging more details. “This is confidential. I don’t want to speak publicly on this,” he said.",Former union minister m veerappa moily said that the high command representatives should have foreseen some of these developments in the state.

Mamata Banerjee Warns BJP With Nation-Shaking Threat As SIR Battle Erupts In Bengal Ahead Of Polls

(With ANI inputs)

NEW DELHI: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has set up a national coordination team to monitor the ongoing Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls and flag any “discrepancies,” along with issues faced by Booth Level Officers (BLOs) across the country.The seven-member committee will be headed by BJP national general secretary Tarun Chugh. Its other members include Dr K Laxman, K Annamalai, Om Prakash Dhankhar, Alka Gurjar, Dr Anirban Ganguly and Jamyang Tsering Namgyal.The panel has already begun field visits. On Saturday, Ganguly visited Nadia district in his home state, West Bengal, to review the revision exercise. West Bengal, which heads to polls next year as the BJP attempts to challenge 3-term chief minister Mamata Banerjee and her Trinamool Congress, will be covered by the committee until December 1. The review in the Union territory of Andaman and Nicobar Islands has already been completed.The Election Commission recently announced “phase 2” of the SIR across nine states and three Union Territories. The exercise has seen reports of BLO deaths and resignations, attributed in some cases to work pressure. Phase 2 — the first was in Bihar ahead of the state's recently-conducted assembly polls — began on November 4 and will culminate with the final voter list publication on February 7, 2026.According to the Election Commission, 99.43 per cent of enumeration forms had been distributed by November 28, covering more than 50 crore electors.

'Doesn’t Deserve LoP Post’: BJP Slams Rahul Gandhi For Missing CJI Surya Kant’s Oath Ceremony

NEW DELHI: The economic offences wing of the Delhi police has registered a fresh FIR against senior Congress leaders Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi, along with six other associates and business entities in an alleged case of criminal conspiracy to ""fraudulently"" acquire Associated Journals Ltd, then a Congress held entity having properties worth Rs 2,000 crore. The acquisition was made through Young Indian in which the Gandhis held 76% shareholding.The Delhi police FIR, dated Oct 3, is based on a complaint filed by the Headquarters Investigative Unit (HIU) of the ED, which has shared detailed findings of its investigation into National Herald money laundering case from 2008-2024.Sharing of information under Sec 66(2) of the PMLA allows ED to ask another enforcement agency to register and probe a scheduled offence, which can then become a predicate offence necessary for the ED to carry out its own investigation under the PMLA.The ongoing money laundering probe by ED is based on a private complaint from former BJP MP Subramanian Swamy and its cognisance by metropolitan magistrate's court in Patiala House in June 2014. In this case, the central agency filed a prosecution complaint (chargesheet) under PMLA against Gandhis and other accused on April 9 before a special MPs/MLAs court here at Rouse Avenue. The court has not taken cognisance yet of the matter.Congress has consistently disputed the charges and has accused ED of carrying out a political witchunt at govt's instance. When TOI contacted the party again on Delhi police registering an FIR, it said they are not aware of it.Besides Sonia and Rahul Gandhi, the FIR registered by the Delhi Police has named three others, including chief of Indian Overseas Congress Sam Pitroda. It also names three entities, AJL, Young Indian and the Dotex Merchandise Pvt Ltd, allegedly a Kolkata-based shell company that provided Rs 1 crore to Young India from which Gandhis paid Congress Rs 50 lakh to allegedly acquire AJL with assets allegedly worth Rs 2,000 crore.Sources said the police is likely to summon shareholders of AJL for questioning to ascertain whether the Congress consulted them and took their approval before transferring the company to Young Indian, beneficially owned by Sonia and Rahul Gandhi.",The economic offences wing of the delhi police has registered a fresh fir against senior congress leaders sonia gandhi and rahul gandhi. It is based on a complaint filed by the headquarters investigative unit (hiu) of the ed.

HC says cross-LoC trade between J&K & PoK is intra-state trade,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hc-says-cross-loc-trade-between-jk-pok-is-intra-state-trade/articleshow/125663637.cms,"Pak Slams Rajnath's Sindh Remark But Ignores Its Leader Claiming Gujarat, Rajasthan, Haryana As Own

SRINAGAR: A division bench of the Jammu and Kashmir high court has stated that cross-LoC trade between Jammu and Kashmir and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir amounts to intra-state trade as PoK is part of Jammu and Kashmir.While deciding petitions from cross-LoC traders, the HC said, “It is not disputed by learned counsel appearing on either side that the area of the state presently under de-facto control of Pakistan is part of territories of the state of Jammu & Kashmir. Therefore, in the instant case, the location of the suppliers and the place of supply of goods were within the then state of Jammu Kashmir (now Union Territory) and, therefore, the cross-LoC trade effected by petitioners during the tax period in question was nothing but intra-state trade. ”“We appreciate the fair stand taken by the learned senior counsel appearing for the petitioners despite there being contrary pleadings disputing the nature of cross-LoC trade as intra-state trade,” the division bench, comprising Justices Sanjeev Kumar and Sanjay Parihar, observed.The petitioners had challenged show-cause notices issued to them by the Superintendent, CGST, under the Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017, stating that when trade was started in 2008, “intra-state sales tax was governed by the Jammu and Kashmir Value Added Taxes Act, which provided that cross-LoC trade was a zero-rated sale.”However, in 2017, when GST was rolled out, the authorities started investigations against the petitioners to probe whether they had paid GST on their outward and inward supplies. After getting information that there were huge outward and inward supplies effected by the petitioners, show-cause notices were served on them.The petitioners also argued that even if it was assumed that the trade was intra-state, a tax demand would be impermissible as the trade was barter trade where no money exchanged hands.The HC said it found no merit in all these petitions and dismissed them.In 2008 after improving relations between India and Pakistan as confidence-building measures, both govts decided to allow free cross-LoC trade between them on certain terms and conditions.However, on April 9, 2019, the Indian govt suspended cross-LoC trade on grounds that the trade routes were being misused to funnel illegal weapons, narcotics, and fake currency.Two steps — a cross-LoC bus service and cross-LoC trade — were seen as the two biggest CBMs between India and Pakistan. On April 7, 2005, the then prime minister, Dr Manmohan Singh, had flagged off the first cross-LoC bus service, titled Karwaan-e-Aman, or peace caravan, that connected Srinagar to Muzaffarabad. Later, cross-LoC trade, established as barter trade, began on Oct 21, 2008, on two routes — Salamabad (Uri)-Muzaffarabad and Poonch-Rawalakot. Traders on either side of the LoC were permitted to exchange 21 mutually-agreed items.",A division bench of the jammu and kashmir high court has stated that cross-loc trade amounts to intra-state trade. The area under de-facto control of pakistan is part of territories of the state of jammu & kashmir. Traders on either side of the loc were permitted to exchange 21 mutually-agreed items.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125663631,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-546244,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"
