Chirag tries to meet Paras, but fails

How will the BJP react?

'I have saved the party'

NEW DELHI: In a surprise turn of events, Chirag Paswan , the president of Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) founded by his father late Ram Vilas Paswan , was on Monday unceremoniusly unseated as the leader of the party in Lok Sabha.Chirag, who took over the mantle of the party in 2020 after the death of Ram Vilas Paswan, stood completely isolated at the top within his party.Five of the six members of Parliament of the LJP revolted against Chirag in an overnight coup and elected Pashupati Kumar Paras, his uncle, as the new leader of the party in Lok Sabha.Besides Pashupati Paras, the rebel group includes Chirag's cousin Prince Raj, Chandan Singh, Veena Devi and Mehboob Ali Kaiser.The group has already met Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla to inform him about the changes in the party. In the coming days, the rebels may stake claim in the Election Commission to represent the real LJP and could also move to oust Chirag from the top party post. Nitish Kumar 's party, the Janta Dal (United), reacted with a sense of vindication to the deveopments within the LJP.Chirag had led an aggressive anti-Nitish Kumar campaign in the 2020 assembly elections and in the process dealt a heavy political blow to the ruling Janta Dal (United) inChirag walked out of the NDA in the state and contested the assembly elections against Nitish Kumar's party. He fielded nominees, some of them BJP rebels, against all the JD(U) candidates.As a result, the JD(U) ended up losing several seats due to triangular contest and for the first time it became the junior partner to the BJP in Bihar NDA.Little wonder, Nitish Kumar's party reacted with a dig at the developments within the LJP.""You reap what you sow,"" said JD(U)national president RCP Singh as he blamed Chirag for doing negative politics.""Chirag Paswan has committed so many blunders in the recent past. The people of Bihar and his own party workers and leaders were not happy with whatever he did during the Bihar assembly election. Now, it's results are coming in the form of a split in the party,"" Singh said.Given the bitter political rivalry between the two parties since the 2020 assembly elections, sources close to Chirag Paswan accused the JD(U) for the split in the LJP.The JD(U), on the other hand, blamed Chirag Paswan's negative politics for the rift within his party.The lone LJP MLA in the Bihar assembly has already left the party to join the JD(U).As the events unfolded on Monday, Chirag Paswan drove to his uncle's residence in the national capital to meet him and Prince Raj.Paswan, who has not been keeping well for some time, waited for over 20 minutes in his car before he was let into the house and then left after spending more than an hour inside.He left without saying a word to waiting media persons.It is believed that neither of the two rebel MPs met him. A household help said the two were not at home when the LJP chief arrived.It would be interesting to see as to how the BJP reacts to the latest developments in this game of one-upmanship between the JD(U) and the LJP in Bihar.Chirag Paswan has all along kept a very strong pro-BJP and pro-PM Modi stand and announced ahead of assembly elections that he is working for a BJP government in Bihar.Pashupati Paras, on the other hand, is percieved as pro-Nitish Kumar.Paras today lauded Nitish Kumar as a good leader and ""vikas purush"" (development-oriented man).With talks of Union Cabinet reshuffle, it would be interesting to see if the BJP decides to include Chirag Paswan to ensure that he is not completely marginalised within his own party.The JD(U) has declined to comment on speculations about one or more rebel LJP MPs being inducted into the Union cabinet from the party quota or getting accommodated in the state ministry.However, it has reiterated the party stand that all NDA allies ought to get a ""respectable"" share at the Centre.Pashupati Paras, who is an MP from Hajipur, a seat represented by Ram Vilas Paswan for several years, caimed that 99 per cent of LJP workers were unhappy with the leadership of Chirag Paswan in Bihar.""There are six MPs in our party. It was the desire of five MPs to save our party. So, I have not broken the party. I have saved it. Chirag Paswan is my nephew as well as the party's national president. I have no objection against him,"" Paras said when asked about the developments.Paras said his group will continue to be part of the BJP-led NDA, and added that Paswan can remain in the organisation.Regarding the rumours that LJP will be joining the Janta Dal (United) in Bihar, the Hajipur MP said, ""Existence of LJP will continue, we are not joining JDU. We will fulfill the ambition of Late Ramvilas Paswan.""",Lok janshakti party (ljp) chief chirag paswan failed to meet pashupati kumar paras at his house in new delhi.

NEW DELHI: Panic gripped Mumbai's Powai area on Thursday after a man identified as Rohit Arya allegedly took 19 people hostage, including 17 children, a senior citizen and one unidentified man, inside RA Studio.Arya later died after being injured in the chest during a police crossfire. The senior citizen was also hurt in the exchange and was rushed to Balasaheb Thackeray Trauma Hospital for treatment, as per reports.Mumbai Police teams, including senior officers and a quick response unit, rushed to the spot after receiving information about the standoff.

Man behind Mumbai hostage scare sat on hunger strike over Rs 2 crore govt dues; new details emerge According to police, Arya had released a video in which he demanded to speak to certain individuals and warned that he would harm himself and the children and “set everything on fire” if prevented.The standoff ended after a police inspector forced entry into the studio and seized an airgun and some chemical from Arya’s possession, Powai police said.Joint Commissioner of Police (L&O) Satyanarayan Chaudhary said, “Prima facie, the motive behind the hostage act appears to be related to some pending work-related dues.”Police said the incident was reported around 1.45 pm, when a distress call from the studio prompted teams from Powai and Sakinaka police stations to rush to the spot.The children, aged between 13 and 17 years, had reportedly travelled from different parts of Maharashtra to attend an audition for an ad shoot being held at the studio.Officials had described the accused as mentally unstable and said they acted swiftly to defuse the situation. Police confirmed that all the children were rescued safely and have been handed over to their parents.The captor, Rohit Aarrya, a social entrepreneur & project management consultant, owned a company that directed awareness videos on social causes.His social media profile shows he was an alumnus of Symbiosis and ISB-Mumbai.Three years ago, he launched a ‘Swachhata Monitor’ in various schools across the state.The next year, he sat on a hunger strike against the then education minister Deepak Kesarkar alleging non-payment of Rs 2 crore dues.",Mumbai hostage scare: 17 kids rescued from powai flat; accused arrested.

'Paid Campaign': Nitin Gadkari Slams Criticism Of E20 Program; Calls It 'Politically Motivated'

Expansion and technology push

Environmental balance and logistics efficiency





NEW DELHI: In a unique move, the road transport ministry has directed the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) and highway builders to create their own YouTube channels and upload regular videos of highway projects at various stages of construction.Union minister Nitin Gadkari said he has ordered the installation of hoardings with QR codes on national highways. Commuters will be able to scan these codes to view details of the contractor, consultant, and government officials responsible for the stretch, including their names and contact information.Gadkari said, “Main kyu gaali khaun? The QR code will have information of the contractor, consultant, and officers who cleared the road. If a road is bad and people are complaining about it on social media, take it seriously. From A to Z in road construction, we need ownership, sincerity, and a positive approach. Roads must be good, and they must stay good.”He emphasised that if people are paying toll, they deserve international-quality roads. “Weather or poor bitumen cannot be excuses. If the surface is not comfortable, fix it — cost may increase but comfort is non-negotiable,” Gadkari said.The minister also pushed for performance audits to identify design and maintenance lapses, promote accountability, and reward quality work. “When audits are regular, transparency increases, and excuses decrease. That’s how we should work,” he said.At the same event, road transport secretary V Umashankar on Tuesday instructed NHAI to upload such project videos for public viewing and feedback. Speaking at a CII event, he said, “We often get information and updates about projects and problems from videos uploaded by independent YouTubers. Some comments also give insight into issues. We are working to make video uploading part of project contract documents.”Officials said builders already submit drone-shot videos during construction, so making them public will not be an issue. The move aims to enhance transparency, accountability, and public participation in highway projects.Gadkari said work is underway to upgrade 25,000 km of highways to four lanes and connect major ports under a ₹2 lakh crore plan, highlighting that improved connectivity is also supporting religious tourism and adventure travel. The ministry is making precast technology mandatory in highway construction to enhance quality and speed up completion.Citing the transplantation of 8,500 trees along the Dwarka Expressway, Gadkari said the government is committed to balancing infrastructure growth with environmental sustainability.He added that improved road infrastructure will help reduce logistics and fuel costs, noting that “80% of goods traffic in India moves by road, while 18% uses other modes and only 1% by air. With better highways, logistics costs are expected to come down to single digits.”Reaffirming the government’s commitment, Gadkari said the goal is to build safe, sustainable, and modern roads that boost economic activity and improve the quality of life across India.","Nitin gadkari orders babus to put qr codes on highways with contractor and officers’ details.

"'Love, not lust': Supreme Court lets off Pocso convict; law must yield to the cause of justice, says apex court",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/love-not-lust-supreme-court-lets-off-pocso-convict-law-must-yield-to-the-cause-of-justice-says-apex-court/articleshow/125005731.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court, using special powers under Article 142 to achieve complete justice beyond letter of law, has again come to the rescue of a young couple who were in a romantic relationship, but which resulted in commission of an offence because the girl was a minor. It acquitted the accused who had been sentenced to 10-year jail under POSCO Act, saying the crime was not the result of lust but love.The court highlighted that the couple are now happily married and have a child together.A bench of Justices Dipankar Datta and Augustine George Masih said while the man was guilty under the law, the rigidity of law should not be allowed to cause injustice. ""We are persuaded to hold that this is a case where the law must yield to the cause of justice,"" the judges ruled.The wife told the court that she wanted to lead a happy, normal, and peaceful life with him and their child born in their wedlock.""As per the law..., the appellant having been found guilty of a heinous offence, the proceedings in the present case on the basis of a compromise between the appellant and his wife cannot be quashed. But ignoring the cry of his wife for compassion and empathy will not, in our opinion, serve the ends of justice.Even the most serious offenders of law do receive justice moderated by compassion from the courts, albeit in appropriate cases. Given the peculiar facts and circumstances here, a balanced approach combining practicality and empathy is necessary,"" the bench said.The Court said that keeping the man in jail would harm the family, the victim and the child. ""While considering the offence... punishable under the POCSO Act, we have discerned that the crime was not the result of lust but love. The victim of crime herself has expressed her desire to live a peaceful and stable family life with the appellant, upon whom she is dependent, without the appellant carrying the indelible mark on his forehead of being an offender.But the court set some conditions on the man to protect the interest of wife and child. The husband must not desert them or child and must maintain them with dignity. ""If, in future, there be any default on the appellant's part and the same is brought to the notice of this Court by his wife or their child or the complainant, the consequences may not be too palatable for the appellant,"" the court said.This is not the first time the Supreme Court has stepped in to stop consensual adolescent romantic relationships from being criminalised. It invoked Article 142 in another case in May to let off a convict under POCSO Act and expressed wonder over how a girl from a village in West Bengal had fought a legal battle singlehandedly, after being abandoned by her family and ostracised by society, to get her lover released from jail. The court said it doesn't want to heap on to the injustice already suffered by the victim at the hands of the society, her family and legal system.","Couple were in a romantic relationship, but it resulted in commission of an offence because the girl was a minor.

Congress Chief Kharge Demands Ban On RSS Citing Sardar Patel's 1948 Letter, BJP Hits Back

NEW DELHI: As Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge called for a ban on RSS citing the decision of the then home minister Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, BJP hit back recalling comments of both Patel and Mahatma Gandhi praising RSS and accusing Kharge of using the language of fundamentalist Muslim organisations like PFI.Kharge said RSS should be proscribed because it is endangering national unity, underlining Patel banning the right-wing organisation in 1948 after its functionaries ""celebrated and distributed sweets"" in the wake of the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi. He accused PM Narendra Modi of disrespecting the ""iron man"" by removing in 2024 the ban on govt employees from joining RSS, and by removing chapters on Gandhi, Godse, RSS and 2002 Gujarat riots from three NCERT books.He said, ""My personal view is that RSS should be banned. If Modi & Amit Shah eulogise the ills that Patel put out in public (before banning RSS), then it should be banned. The problems of law & order are because of RSS & BJP.""BJP spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi said Patel had described RSS as an organisation of patriots days before Gandhi's assassination in Jan 1948 & echoed a similar view in a letter to its then chief M S Golwalkar in Nov 1948.""Kharge said Patel wrote to Golwalkar and Shyama Prasad Mukherjee about the decision to ban RSS. ""RSS speeches are full of communal poison... which led to Gandhi's killing. RSS people rejoiced and distributed sweets... We have no other option but to ban RSS,"" he said, adding, ""These are Patel's words. But those who killed Gandhi and think ill of Gandhi, they are telling us that Congress does not remember Patel. The two Gujarat netas (Modi and Shah) say this. They must tell what they did for the country.""Another BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra said the Kapur Commission, which had probed the conspiracy behind Gandhi's killing, had absolved RSS and that the Supreme Court's verdict on similar lines is also in public domain. He said several Congress leaders, including Indira Gandhi, have spoken positively of RSS and noted that Pranab Mukherjee was also full of praise for it after he as the then President of India visited its headquarters.","Mallikarjun kharge calls for a ban on rss citing the decision of the then home minister sardar vallabhbhai patel.

‘Script Readied Over A Mth, Read Out To Parents’

MUMBAI: The ""script"" for the shocking Powai hostage crisis was apparently planned for over a month. Seventeen children had their hands tied and mouths taped at a recording studio Thursday, as everyone believed a ""hostage scene"" for a web series was being filmed. Panic set in only when the captor, Rohit Aarrya, pulled out a gun and an iron rod and threatened to kill them, according to chilling victim accounts.Police said Aarrya came prepared - rags sprayed with chemicals were placed around the duplex studio and on the floor to start a fire if things went wrong, motion detectors were fixed at the main door, and moving cameras were set up on all floors.A policeman said Aarrya had read out his web series script to 23 shortlisted children and their parents during the audition of 36 hopefuls, convincing them that a hostage scene would be filmed on the final day of a five-day shoot. ""Only 17 of the 23 children attended preparations at the studio for four days,"" he said. These ""preparations"" lulled the eight boys and nine girls, aged 10 to 15, who arrived at the studio at 8am on Thursday, into a false sense of safety.A few hours later, some children sensed something was wrong and began screaming. That, said a cop, enraged Aarrya. ""He began waving an airgun and an iron rod at us, shouting he would kill us all,"" recalled one of the girls.""It was only then that we realised this was no longer fiction.""When police entered, they found the children with their mouths taped, and some with their hands tied. They had been denied food for hours as Aarrya kept shifting them from one room to another. ""While negotiating over phone, we could hear children screaming. He watched us from behind closed sliding glass doors with dark curtains. At intervals, he would run back into the room and drag five children out,"" said an officer. ""This continued for almost two hours,"" he added.At least 15 children were confined to a room on the upper floor. ""The studio had two floors. There were two rooms, a narrow passage, and a small hall on the lower floor, while upper floor had two rooms, a hall, a passage, and a toilet,"" the officer said. It is alleged Aarrya carried a petrol can to threaten the children. One girl's 75-year-old grandmother was also trapped inside.Aarrya's production assistant, Rohan Aher, was locked in a separate room and threatened at gunpoint. Aher told cops he had no idea of Aarrya's plan. Aarrya was listed as the producer, scriptwriter, and planner of the series. ""We didn't know he had weapons or inflammable material,"" Aher said, adding he managed to speak to police officers through a window while Aarrya was in another room talking to police and parents.Aarrya had also recorded a video stating he had abandoned thoughts of suicide and planned the ""hostage"" situation to get his ""demands"" met. Police said the video was sent via WhatsApp to two acquaintances from the auditions at 1.45pm Thursday, who alerted police. A team reached the site by 2.15pm, and after nearly two hours of negotiations, the operation ended with Aarrya's death by 4pm.","17 children had their hands tied and mouths taped at a recording studio in mumbai.

NDA manifesto ‘blueprint for state’s progress’: PM Modi

PATNA: The NDA on Friday made a welfare and aspirational pitch in the Bihar assembly elections, countering RJD's govt job campaign with the promise of creating over one crore employment opportunities, including in govt, based on an elaborate skill census.It also sought to consolidate crucial support bases, such as extremely backward class (EBC) voters, with the alliance's joint manifesto promising a high-level committee to assess the socio-economic status of each community and steps to empower them.The allies, led by BJP and JD(U), unveiled a plan to top up the Rs 6,000 PM-KISAN support with a Rs 3,000 annual payout. Besides, there is the promise of free education ""KG to PG"", and a Panchamrit Guarantee - free electricity up to 125 units, free foodgrain, free treatment up to Rs 5 lakh, 50 lakh new houses, and pensions.NDA promised an infrastructure boost in Bihar to bring it on a par with other states through a focus on development, be it new cities - including New Patna and Sitapuram, a greenfield project near Sitamarhi - rapid rail, seven new expressways, or more airports and bringing direct international flights to four airports. A new airport near Patna and one in Bhagalpur are also planned.The manifesto, jointly released by CM Nitish Kumar, Union minister and BJP national president J P Nadda, JDU national working president Sanjay Kumar Jha, Union ministers Jitan Ram Manjhi and Chirag Paswan, and RLM chief Upendra Kushwaha, contains 25 key points.""We will build world-class medical institutions, complete construction of approved medical colleges in every district, set up modern super-specialty hospitals dedicated to children and autism and a dedicated 'centre of excellence' for identified priority sportspersons in every division,"" said deputy CM Samrat Chaudhary.In an outreach to another key constituency, the manifesto has announced assistance of up to Rs 2 lakh under the CM Mahila Rozgar Scheme for women, and vowed to create one crore 'Lakhpati Didis' along with 'Mission Crorepati'.Apart from the monthly financial assistance of Rs 2,000 to scheduled caste students pursuing higher education, the manifesto pledges financial aid of up to Rs 10 lakh for EBC youths for self-employment.The emphasis on jobs was a clear focus given the discourse around migration and failure to create employment. But unlike RJD's pitch for one govt job for every family, BJP's emphasis is on skilling and creating the platform for employment.The Rs 1 lakh crore Developed Bihar Industrial Mission, complete with 10 new industrial parks and a Rs 50 lakh crore investment target, are meant to lay the foundation. There will be emphasis on defence manufacturing, global capability centres, creating an AI hub and a tech and fintech city as the NDA seeks to ensure that there are enough jobs within the state, which also addresses concerns over migration. MSMEs were pitched as the other area of emphasis, again aimed at creating employment while also meeting the requirements of large industries.Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday described the NDA’s election manifesto for Bihar as “a blueprint for the state’s progress and aspirations”, asserting that it reflected the alliance’s resolve to turn Bihar into a developed and self-reliant state. “The NDA’s sankalp-patra for the Bihar assembly elections clearly presents our vision for an Atmanirbhar and Viksit Bihar,” Modi said.He added, “It reflects our commitment to improving the lives of farmers, youth, mothers and sisters, and all families of Bihar. The state’s double-engine govt has spared no effort for all-round development, and we are determined to accelerate these efforts further to make good governance the foundation of prosperity for every citizen.” Modi expressed confidence that “the people of Bihar will wholeheartedly support our efforts. ” The NDA manifesto promises wide-ranging welfare and infrastructure initiatives.Home minister Amit Shah echoed the PM, saying NDA under Modi and Nitish Kumar’s leadership is “committed to building a developed Bihar”. “Today, NDA has released its sankalp-patra to speed up development reaching every section of society. From heritage to high-tech innovation, Bihar is ready for a giant leap,” Shah said, adding a dedicated Flood Management Board and the ‘Flood to Fortune’ initiative would make Bihar flood-free.","Nda promises to create over one crore employment opportunities, including in govt, based on an elaborate skill census. The alliance's joint manifesto promises a high-level committee to assess the socio-economic status of each community and steps to empower them.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125007918,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1119325,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

’They Talk, We Act’: JDU’s Bijendra Prasad Yadav Slams Tejashwi, Rubbishes Mahagathbandhan Manifesto

NEW DELHI: The ruling NDA alliance in Bihar on Friday released its election manifesto, the ""Sankalp Patra"", promising jobs, industries, and infrastructure growth. But the move quickly drew sharp fire from the opposition Mahagathbandhan bloc with RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav leading the charge, calling it a bundle of ""jumla"" and demanding that the alliance issue a ""sorry patra"" instead.""NDA should release a ‘sorry patra’ and apologise to the 14 crore people of Bihar. The state is the poorest despite their 20-year rule. There are no factories here, no investment. This government has failed in all sectors,"" Tejashwi said, accusing the Nitish Kumar–PM Modi-led coalition of ""failing Bihar on every front.""Taking a pointed jab at the chief minister, the RJD leader added, ""CM might not even know what is in that manifesto. Perhaps the press conference was cut short to prevent him from speaking.""Also Read: Bihar elections 2025: NDA vs Mahagathbandhan manifesto war — who promised what Confident of Mahagathbandhan’s prospects in state, Tejashwi said, ""This is just 'jumla.'

""How will they provide that (1 crore government jobs)? Where will they get the money from? When we said we would provide 10 lakh government jobs, we did.

NEW DELHI: Assam chief minister and BJP leader Himanta Biswa Sarma on Friday once again launched a sharp attack on his former party colleague and fellow Assamese leader Gaurav Gogoi, alleging that the Congress MP is “100 per cent a Pakistani agent. ”Speaking to reporters, Sarma said, “Congress MP Gaurav Gogoi 100 per cent Pakistani agent, he has been planted by foreign power.”The Assam CM has repeatedly targeted Gogoi and his wife, Elizabeth Coulburn, in the past. In September, Sarma claimed that the SIT probing the alleged Pakistani links of the Gogoi family had uncovered “startling facts” suggesting a larger conspiracy to “undermine India’s sovereignty.”Earlier this week, Sarma had also hit out at the Congress leadership over the Bangladesh anthem row, accusing Lok Sabha Deputy Leader Gaurav Gogoi of giving silent approval. “Instead of taking action, Gogoi seems quietly pleased. This is nothing short of endorsing Bangladesh’s claim over our land,” Sarma had said.","Himanta biswa sarma has repeatedly targeted gaurav gogoi and his wife, elizabeth coulburn.

PATNA: After decades of being the face of RJD, patriarch Lalu Prasad is ceding political space to his son Tejashwi Yadav as INDIA bloc's Bihar chief ministerial candidate takes centre stage in a poll campaign designed to recast the party's image around the heir.Lalu, still the RJD president, doesn't feature in any of the poll posters projecting Tejashwi as Bihar's ""nayak"" and promising momentous changes if he is elected CM. The ailing former CM and Union minister hasn't been seen in public either, although his wife Rabri Devi, also a former CM, did travel to Raghopur recently.So, is Lalu's health the only reason he isn't part of the campaign or has one of Bihar's most influential political figures over several decades outlived his utility?RJD sources said that Lalu receding into the background is part of a conscious attempt to neutralise the negative factors associated with the state's main opposition party. RJD's 15-year stint in govt still invites ""jungle raj"" jibes from NDA, with Lalu being painted as the central figure.Sources added that the patriarch, known for his witty asides and retorts, is still active on social media platforms, targeting his rivals with his trademark one-liners.""Lalu's name or posters featuring him provide fodder to NDA to target us. So, the party brass has cleverly planned to keep him out of poll campaign this time, focusing on Tejashwi instead,"" said an RJD functionary.In 2020, Tejashwi came close to forming govt, with only 12 seats separating the RJD-led alliance from NDA. The gap in total votes polled for both sides was 11,150.The general impression is that Tejashwi is being extra cautious this time about not wading into any controversy. He is also trying to ""give a touch of positivity to the campaign"", talking about providing jobs to every family, regularising services of contractual workers in govt departments, and ending migration.His favourite pitch? ""Just give me a chance, and I will do in 20 months what wasn't done in 20 years."" And all of this without once mentioning his famous father's name.","Lalu doesn't feature in any of the poll posters projecting tejashwi as bihar's ""nayak"" and promising momentous changes if he is elected cm.

MUMBAI: A 45-year-old social entrepreneur who ran a project for the state govt held 17 children, aged 12-15, a 75-year-old woman and his staffer hostage for three hours at a recording studio in Powai Thursday afternoon after calling them for auditions for a web series.The crisis ended after a police commando team stormed the studio following failed negotiations. Police said they shot him in the chest in self-defence after he fired from an air gun. He was declared dead in hospital.Police said Aarrya owned a company, Apsara Media, that directed awareness videos on social causes and had extensively worked with children.They said he had been holding auditions at RA Studio in Powai for the past five days for a web series he was planning. Thursday was the final casting call.Auditions began at 10am and the children—hailing from Navi Mumbai, Kolhapur, Satara, Sangli and other parts of the state—arrived earlier, said a security guard at Mahavir Classik, which housed the studio.The hostage drama played out after the captor, Rohit Aarrya, who had been living in a relative’s Chembur flat for the past few days, released a video saying he wanted “simple answers” to some questions and threatened to set the place ablaze if there was any move made to challenge him.In the clip, which was circulated to many media outlets, he said he was not a terrorist and only wanted “to be heard”. “Instead of dying by suicide, I have held some children hostage,” he said.The captor, Rohit Aarrya , was a social entrepreneur and project management consultant who owned a company, Apsara Media, that directed awareness videos on social causes.His social media profile showed he was an alumnus of Symbiosis International University, Pune, and had completed an executive MBA from ISB, Mumbai.He had worked extensively with children on the central govt’s Swacchh Bharat initiative, saying he was inspired by PM Narendra Modi’s plan for cleanliness in public spaces.Since 2017, Aarrya had engaged actors, including Prem Chopra, to enact short videos to generate awareness. He claimed actor Ramesh Deo as his mentor. His social media profiles contain pictures of ministers and a few celebrities.He said he had taken the children hostage “according to a plan”. “I really want to conduct the ‘Let’s Change’ programme. I am going to do it. If I am alive, then I will do it. If I die, then someone else will do it. But it will definitely happen,” he said.His tone then turned menacing. “It will happen with these kids only if they are not harmed. Because the slightest wrong move from your end will trigger me to set this place on fire and die in it.Whether I die or not, the kids will definitely be unnecessarily hurt and traumatised. I don’t know what will happen to them. If something does happen to them, I should not be held responsible.""Those persons should be held responsible who are triggering this unnecessarily, when a normal, common person just wants to talk. After my discussions are over, I will come out myself. I am not alone. I have more people with me. Many people have similar problems as mine. And I am going to give this solution only by talking. Please do not trigger me to do some harm to anybody.”Police spent nearly two hours trying to negotiate with the captor, Rohit Aarrya, and gauge his demands, but he refused to cooperate, even after one of the girls’ parents said she suffered from seizures, cops said. An official said he appeared calm when police spoke to him.City police chief Deven Bharti maintained that Aarrya fired first, prompting retaliatory police firing.“Regardless of his demands, we couldn’t let him play with lives. Our team fired back in self-defence. There was no other option.”Other officials reiterated that the safety of those held captive was the priority, adding that the team’s response was measured and as per the protocol. The death prompted calls by legal experts for a magisterial inquiry.","The crisis ended after a police commando team stormed the studio following failed negotiations.

NEW DELHI: Union home minister Amit Shah on Thursday criticised Congress MP Rahul Gandhi , alleging that Gandhi insulted the Chhath Puja festival as he is ignorant of India's culture since Italy is his ""maternal home"".Addressing multiple rallies in Bihar, Shah said the INDIA bloc will be ""wiped out"" and that voters would ""avenge"" what he called an ""insult to Chhathi Maiyya"". He also referred to an earlier incident where Congress workers in the state allegedly abused Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s mother.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had held one of his election meetings in the Muzaffarpur on Wednesday, and alleged that the PM had tried to enact a ""drama"" by planning to take a dip in the Yamuna at Delhi, on the occasion of Chhath Puja.He had alleged that Modi gave up his plans to take a dip when it came to light that the spot he had chosen was a puddle created with clean, piped water, since the Yamuna was extremely polluted and not fit for a bath.""Rahul baba has said Modi and others who worshipped Chhathi Maiyya were indulging in drama. His maternal roots are in Italy, and hence he has no idea about the country's culture,"" Shah said, as quoted by PTI. He asked voters to press the EVM button on NDA symbols ""with such rage that the tremors are felt in Italy"".The home minister accused the Congress and its allies of preventing the construction of the Ram temple in Ayodhya.
