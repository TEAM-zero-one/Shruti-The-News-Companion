Delhi weather today: IMD forecast more relief as city cools down after powerful thunderstorm,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/delhi-weather-today-imd-forecast-more-relief-as-city-cools-down-after-powerful-thunderstorm/articleshow/120222002.cms,"Credit: Rajesh Mehta/TNN

NEW DELHI: IMD expects the relief from heat to continue on Saturday as well, after a powerful thunderstorm with winds touching 84 kmph hit Delhi on Friday evening, disrupting flights, traffic, and power supply while offering a sharp drop in temperature.The storm caused widespread disruption—grounding flights, toppling trees, cutting power lines, and jamming traffic across several parts of the capital. At the airport, 35 incoming flights were diverted and more than 100 others delayed as air traffic control halted operations for nearly 30 minutes.Roads were no better. Uprooted trees choked busy stretches like Mathura Road, Lodhi Road, Janakpuri, Okhla, Najafgarh and Dwarka, with vehicles damaged in some areas, including one incident in Janakpuri where a van was crushed by a fallen tree. NDMC and MCD received numerous complaints about trees being brought down across areas such as Jor Bagh, Hanuman Road, Mohan Singh Place, and Shahdara.Wind speeds varied across the city—touching 84 kmph in southwest Delhi, 74 kmph near IGI Airport, and 70 kmph at Pragati Maidan. Weather stations recorded light showers: 5mm in Narela and 2.5mm in Pitampura.The storm brought down the maximum temperature at Safdarjung from 39.6°C on Thursday to 35.8°C on Friday, while Lodhi Road saw a sharp dip from 31°C to 24°C in just 30 minutes post 6.15pm.According to IMD scientists, the thunderstorm was triggered by a western disturbance that caused dry mid-level winds to collide with moist lower-level winds from the Arabian Sea—a perfect recipe for thunderstorm formation.Power supply was hit in several areas after tree branches damaged power lines. BSES and Tata Power-DDL said their teams were deployed promptly to restore electricity, with some delays in areas like Narela, Bawana, Badli, and Mangolpuri due to safety concerns.In Gurgaon, a gantry on the Dwarka Expressway collapsed during the storm, landing on a moving car. Fortunately, there were no serious injuries or damage. The structure was quickly removed, and traffic has since resumed.","Thunderstorm with winds touching 84 kmph hit delhi on friday evening.

NEW DELHI: At least three people were killed in West Bengal’s Murshidabad district as protests against the Centre’s Waqf (Amendment) Act spiraled into violence over the weekend, prompting chief minister Mamata Banerjee to declare that the law will not be implemented in the state.The recently enacted Waqf (Amendment) Act, 2025, has triggered a wave of protests and legal confrontations across India, with political parties, religious organizations, and civil society groups voicing concern over its implications for minority rights and religious freedoms.ALSO READ: What is Waqf (Amendment) Bill? All you need to know While the Centre has defended the legislation as a historic reform, critics claim it enables state overreach into Muslim endowments and threatens the secular fabric of the Constitution.From courtroom battles in Delhi and Calcutta to violent street protests in Bengal and Rajasthan, here’s a detailed look at the top developments:Shortly after the Calcutta High Court approved the deployment of central forces in riot-hit Murshidabad, Union home secretary Govind Mohan stated that apart from nearly 300 Border Security Force personnel locally available in Murshidabad, additional five Companies have been deployed at the request of the state sovernment.Mohan, who held a video conference with Chief Secretary and DGP of West Bengal, advised the state administration to keep a close watch on other sensitive districts also, and to put in place adequate steps to ensure normalcy at the earliest.He also stated that the Centre is closely monitoring the situation and assured the state all possible assistance including deployment of additional manpower, if necessary, the ministry of home affairs said in a statement.The West Bengal DGP briefed that the situation was tense but under control and was being monitored closely. The DGP further stated that he is taking the assistance of BSF posted locally, and that more than 150 persons have been arrested, the MHA said.A father and son, were killed in West Bengal's Murshidabad district after violent clashes, reportedly linked to ongoing protests against the Waqf (Amendment) Act.The victims were found with multiple stab wounds inside their home in Jafrabad, a locality in the violence-stricken Samserganj area. The family claims that miscreants looted their house before fatally stabbing the two.In a separate incident, another individual suffered a bullet injury earlier in Dhulian, Samserganj. The district has seen widespread unrest, with large-scale violence erupting on Friday in Samserganj and Suti areas during protests against the contentious law.ALSO READ: Calcutta HC intervenes, ‘We cannot stay silent’; deploys central forces amid Waqf Act protests The state has so far arrested 118 individuals linked to the unrest. While officials initially said one person had sustained a bullet injury, Additional Director General (Law and Order) Jawed Shamim later confirmed two deaths, without clarifying whether police firing was involved. He suggested the possibility of shots being fired from the BSF side but said the source was still under investigation.""These are early reports that we need to cross-check,” Shamim said, adding that the injured were receiving treatment and that the situation remained tense.The Calcutta high court on Saturday ordered the deployment of central paramilitary forces in West Bengal’s Murshidabad district following large-scale violence during protests against the Waqf (Amendment) Act. The decision came after a special hearing was held on a court holiday in response to a petition filed by Leader of the Opposition and BJP leader Suvendu Adhikari.“In view of the large-scale communal riots spreading like wildfire across West Bengal, I had sought immediate intervention from the state government for the requisition of central paramilitary forces. The state government did not accept it. With no other option, I approached the High Court for an urgent hearing,” Adhikari said after the order.A division bench comprising Justice Soumen Sen and Justice Raja Basu Chaudhary heard the matter and accepted his plea, ordering immediate deployment of central forces in the violence-hit areas.Mamata Banerjee has made it clear that her government will not implement the Waqf (Amendment) Act in the state, amid spiraling violence in Muslim-majority districts like Murshidabad. “We did not make this law. It was brought by the Centre. So what is the riot about?” Mamata asked in a post on X.“We do not condone any violent activity. My appeal to all religions: remain calm and restrained. Do not fall prey to provocation,” Mamata said, accusing “some political parties” of misusing religion for political gain.Four rounds were reportedly fired by police on Friday, injuring two. Vehicles were torched, roads blocked, and stones hurled at police in districts like Malda, South 24 Parganas, and Hooghly. DGP Rajeev Kumar said strong action would follow and urged people not to fall for ""rumour mongering.""Meanwhile, political leaders have sharply reacted to the ongoing violence.BJP MP Sudhanshu Trivedi commented on the passage of the Waqf (Amendment) Act, calling the protests in West Bengal a political ploy. ""After completing all the constitutional procedures in a systematic manner, the Waqf Bill came to Parliament, was discussed by the JPC, and passed by both Houses. It then received the President's approval and became law. Yet, some are using it for political gain. It is sad that this is happening only in West Bengal. This raises the question if Mamata Banerjee’s politics is becoming a challenge for the entire country,"" he said.In response to the growing violence, West Bengal Leader of Opposition Suvendu Adhikari moved the Calcutta High Court, seeking deployment of central forces in the state. “With communal riots spreading rapidly across West Bengal, I sought immediate intervention from the state government for central paramilitary forces. When the state government didn’t act, I approached the High Court for urgent intervention. My plea has been accepted, and the division bench will hear the PIL,” he said.Adhikari also wrote to the railway minister demanding an NIA probe into vandalism in Murshidabad, alleging a “premeditated assault by jihadist forces.”“This wasn’t protest—it was an attack on democracy and governance,” Adhikari posted on X.ALSO READ | President Droupadi Murmu gives assent to Waqf (Amendment) Bill, 2025 State BJP chief Sukanta Majumdar said the TMC government was enabling the unrest through appeasement. “When BJP comes to power, we will crush such vandalism in five minutes,” he warned.After Friday prayers, the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) staged a peaceful protest in Jaipur's Bhatta Basti area to oppose the Waqf (Amendment) Act. Rajasthan AIMIM chief Jameel Khan alleged that the legislation is an attempt by the Centre to take control of Waqf assets and marginalize Muslims.“This legislation is not about reform, but about reinforcing a broader agenda of exclusion and injustice against Muslims,” said Khan. “We will continue to assert our democratic right to peaceful protest and also launch a public awareness campaign.”Khan said that their demonstration aimed to urge citizens and lawmakers alike to reassess the broader impact of the amendment on minority rights and social harmony.The Congress party has pledged to challenge the Act, calling it a violation of the Constitution’s basic structure.“The law is part of a broader agenda to polarize the country on religious lines,” said Congress leader Swadesh Sharma.“Just as public sector units were sold off to industrialist friends, this law seeks to gift donated lands to a few.”Several Muslim organizations, including the Jamiat Ulema-i-Hind and Indian Union Muslim League, have announced plans to take legal recourse, while protests continue across states.Congress MP Imran Masood, commenting on the unrest, condemned the violence while emphasizing the fight for the Constitution. “We are staunchly against violence. This is not just a fight for Muslims but for the Constitution. The BJP trampled on the Constitution with the Waqf Act. This is about protecting the Constitution, not a political agenda,” he saidThe National Conference (NC), currently in power in Jammu & Kashmir, has petitioned the Supreme Court, calling the Act a ""constitutionally alarming interference"" in Muslim religious affairs. NC MLAs Arjun Singh Raju, Hilal Akbar Lone, and others filed a writ on April 11.“On the directions of Party President Dr Farooq Abdullah... our MLAs have filed a writ petition seeking justice,” the NC posted on X.Chief Justice Sanjiv Khanna's bench is set to hear a clutch of similar petitions on April 16. Other challengers include AIMIM's Asaduddin Owaisi, the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, SDPI, AAP's Amanatullah Khan, and civil rights organizations.In contrast, Hindu Sena president Vishnu Gupta filed an intervention application in support of the Act, arguing that the original Waqf Act enabled wrongful claims on non-Muslim property.“The unamended provision of the Waqf Act, 1995, caused serious prejudice to the rights and interests of non-Muslims,” read the plea.The plea contends that the 2025 amendment restores justice to non-Muslims whose properties were allegedly misclassified as Waqf assets.In Bhopal, MP Waqf Board chairman Sanwar Patel said the board is preparing to serve notices to nearly 2,000 people for illegal occupation of Waqf properties.“Out of 15,008 Waqf properties in the state, most are occupied. We’ll ask them to vacate or become legal tenants, failing which action will follow under the new law,” Patel told ANI.He accused several Congress leaders, including a national president and AIMIM chief Owaisi, of occupying such properties. Patel also cited an RRC (Revenue Recovery Certificate) of Rs 7.11 crore against Congress leader Riyaz Khan.","A father and son, were killed in west bengal's murshidabad district after violent clashes, reportedly linked to ongoing protests against the waqf (amendment) act.

Tahawwur Rana In India: Trump's Biggest Strike On Pak Terror, 26/11 Plotter To Face Justice Finally

Also read:

NEW DELHI: Worry seemed to flit across Tahawwur Rana’s face when he asked his legal counsels on Thursday night whether his trial would be over in a year or so and received “No” as a reply, sources said. They told him that just filing a chargesheet could consume a year, and that the entire trial, even a fast one, could take between five to 10 years.As he got a quick primer on the pace of the Indian legal system, Rana asked if he could plead the “Fifth”, to which his counsels said Indian laws also provide protection from “self-incrimination”, sources said. “Pleading the Fifth”, or invoking the Fifth Amendment of the US Constitution, means refusing to answer questions or providing information that could incriminate oneself.Walking slowly in a brown jumpsuit with Crocs as footwear, wearing specta cles and a four-to-six-inch white beard, a fringe of white hair framing a balding scalp, Rana was produced before the special NIA court of special judge Chander Jit Singh in Patiala House Court at around 10.30pm on Thursday amid heavy security. His legal aid counsels (LACs) — advocates Piyush Sachdeva and Lakshya Dheer — were provided to him by Delhi State Legal Services Authority.Looking frail, tired, and jet-lagged, Rana displayed no other signs of anxiety during the court proceedings. However, the effects of age-related ailments were visible on the former Pakistan Army officer accused of a key role in the 26/ 11 Mumbai terror attacks. Rana suffers from various ailments, including abdominal, intestinal, and sinus cysts.According to sources, he came across as a “smart individual” who can strike up “casual conversations”. Rana was offered fruits by NIA personnel while waiting for court proceedings to begin, which he refused, but interacted “comfortably” with agency members. Sources said that Rana is being “taken good care of”. Govt and the agency want to make this case a “model one” so no one is going to take any chances, said sources.Rana’s major concern, apart from his claim that he is innocent and that extradition was not needed as he had already spent over a decade in jail and had been “acquitted” in the matter, was his medical care. On this, NIA assured the special judge that he would be provided all the medical care he needs. The question of “manhandling” also came up in the hearing, which was addressed by the court directing that Rana be medically examined every 48 hours.A US district court trial by jury had acquitted him on June 9, 2011 of conspiracy to provide material support to the Nov 2008 terrorist attacks in Mumbai. The LACs appearing for Rana urged the court to provide him with a “writing instrument” so that he can prepare his defence.The hearing for his remand was over within 10-15 minutes at around 11pm on Thursday. However, the order was pronounced at around 2am Friday.The prosecution, led by senior advocate Dayan Krishnan and advocate Narender Mann, submitted before the court that Rana is the first accused to be arrested and has links with named terrorists and other accused persons in this case. The counsels appearing for NIA told the court that a detailed investigation is required, Rana has to be confronted with a lot of evidence, and his statements would lead to additional discoveries.The court granted NIA 18 days’ custody of Rana. The agency requested 20 days, expressing concern that Rana might orchestrate terror plots like 26/11 targeting additional Indian cities. The court stipulated several conditions, including permission to consult with his legal representative on alternate days. The court also specified that Rana could only use a soft-tip pen and must conduct meetings with his lawyer under NIA supervision and within hearing range.","Tahawwur rana was produced before the special nia court of special judge chander jit singh in patiala house court at around 10.30pm on thursday.

Why Nagenthran is BJP’s best bet for Tamil Nadu chief



NEW DELHI: Bharatiya Janata Party on Saturday announced Nainar Nagenthiran as its new party president for Tamil Nadu unit. Nagenthiran succeeds K Annamalai as the 13th president of the Tamil Nadu BJP.""BJP is a very big party with 1000 and above MLAs and 300 and above MPs, and I am very proud to become a state president of this party,"" Nagenthiran said.This comes a day after the saffron party announced its alliance with AIADMK ahead of the 2026 assembly elections in the presence of Union home minister Amit Shah.K Annamalai reportedly expressed reluctance to continue in his role after the party’s national leadership moved to revive its alliance with the AIADMK. While some sources claim the AIADMK demanded his removal, both parties have denied this.Nagenthran, who joined the BJP in 2017, gained prominence under mentor V Karuppasamy Pandian and made headlines in 2018 for threatening lyricist Vairamuthu over remarks about Goddess Andal.Amit Shah on Friday confirmed that the BJP had received Nagenthiran's nomination for the top post.""The nomination for the post of Tamil Nadu BJP State President has been received only from Mr @NainarBJP. As the Tamil Nadu BJP President , Mr @annamalai_k has made commendable achievements. Whether it is taking the policies of Prime Minister Mr @narendramodi to the people, or taking the party's projects village by village, Mr Annamalai's contribution is immense. The BJP will utilize Mr Annamalai's organizational skills in the party's national structure,"" he said.Having served as a cabinet minister in the AIADMK government from 2001 to 2006, Nagendran is seen as a natural link between the two parties in the renewed alliance.He is the BJP MLA from Tirunelveli in Tamil Nadu and had earlier hinted at a possible alliance with the AIADMK, stating that there was no need to pressure the party into an agreement and that a simple dialogue with EPS would suffice to forge a partnership.At the time, then BJP president Annamalai distanced himself from the remark, claiming it was misinterpreted. He later reaffirmed his commitment to the party, saying he was willing to work as a grassroots BJP cadre and had joined politics to serve Tamil Nadu, not to seek power.",Nagenthiran succeeds k annamalai as the 13th president of the tamil nadu bjp.

"La Nina over, India unlikely to see drought or extreme rain",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/la-nina-over-india-unlikely-to-see-drought-or-extreme-rain/articleshow/120221899.cms,"NEW DELHI: La Nina conditions in the Pacific Ocean that generally favour good monsoon rains in India have ended, the US govt agencies declared late Thursday, with the world’s largest ocean likely to stay in ‘neutral’ phase till winter. This could be good news for India’s monsoon, as it reduces the probability of drought or excess rainfall in the season, but it’s also likely to make monsoon forecasts trickier, experts said.Adding to the difficulty of forecasters, conditions in the Indian Ocean too are likely to be ‘neutral’ till at least Aug, as per the latest Australian weather bureau update. Along with the Pacific, surface temperatures in the Indian Ocean play a major role in India’s monsoon, with the ocean’s ‘positive’ phase — when waters in western Indian Ocean are warmer than those in the east — generally boosting rains.For the Pacific, the US’s Climate Prediction Center said in a release that there was more than a 50% chance that neutral conditions will stay till Sept. Its probability of persisting till the year-end was also higher than those of La Nina or El Nino, it said.If this forecast holds true, this would be the first time in 12 years that the monsoon peri od, or the months immediately preceding or following it, won’t have presence of either El Nino or La Nina. These two opposite Pacific Ocean conditions are seen as most important among large scale weather features that determine how much rain India gets during the June-Sept period.“When Pacific Ocean conditions are neutral, all scenarios are open for the Indian monsoon. However, the chances of a drought or a flood year are small. Generally, under neutral Pacific conditions, we don’t expect unwanted monsoon outcomes,” said M Rajee van, veteran meteorologist and former secretary of the Union earth sciences ministry.During neutral conditions in the Pacific, also known as ENSO neutral phase , surface water temperatures in the ocean’s eastern and central equatorial regions are neither abnormally warm (El Nino conditions, which weaken Indian monsoon) nor too cool (La Nina). While this is said to be the ocean’s natural state, neutral years aren’t that common.“Monsoon is more difficult to predict under such conditions. Forecasters have to be more careful and look closely into factors such as the state of the Atlantic Ocean. Internal dynamics can also play a role,” said Rajeevan, who is also IMD’s former monsoon forecaster.As per the first monsoon forecast this year, made by private agency Skymet, total monsoon rainfall in India is likely to be 103% of the long period average, at the higher end of the normal range.","La nina conditions in the pacific ocean that generally favour good monsoon rains in india have ended.

NEW DELHI: Tahawwur Rana (64), one of the main plotters of the 26/11 Mumbai attack , is being kept on "" suicide watch "" in a highly secure cell within National Investigation Agency (NIA) headquarters here after a special court granted his 18-day custody to the anti-terror agency.The Pakistani-Canadian, who was brought here on Thursday evening following his extradition from the US, is under 24/7 human and CCTV surveillance. The NIA HQ on Lodhi Road has been blanketed in multi-layered security. ""Rana has been kept in a 14x14 cell on the ground floor. He will be allowed only a soft-tip pen to write so that he can't harm himself,"" a source said.On Friday, NIA began questioning Rana to unravel the larger conspiracy behind the terror strike. The interrogation is likely to focus on, besides his connection with ISI, involvement with sleeper cells in India, particularly those linked to his associate, David Coleman Headley , alias Daood Gilani. Headley is suspected to have recruited sleeper cells in Pushkar, Goa, Delhi and other places, sources said.On a day Mumbai terror attack accused Tahawwur Hussain Rana was extradited from the US to India, Congress said Modi govt did not initiate the process and in fact benefited from the ""mature, consistent and strategic diplomacy"" that began under UPA.In a statement, former union minister P Chidambaram said that ""while Modi govt is rushing to take credit for this development, the truth is far from their spin.""""This extradition is not the result of any grandstanding, it is a testament to what the Indian state can achieve when diplomacy, law enforcement, and international cooperation are pursued sincerely and without any kind of chest-thumping,"" Chidambaram said. He added, ""It is the culmination of a decade-and-a-half of painstaking diplomatic, legal and intelligence efforts initiatedby UPA govt in close coordination with the US.""""The coursework began on Nov 11, 2009, when NIA registered a case in New Delhi against David Coleman Headley (US citizen), Rana (Canadian citizen), and others involved in the 26/11 conspiracy.

Chidambaram said that in Feb 2025, PM Modi and US President Trump "" tried to take credit for what was essentially the result of years of UPA-era groundwork"".","Tahawwur rana (64), one of the main plotters of the 26/11 mumbai attack, is being kept on "" suicide watch "" in a highly secure cell within national investigation agency (nia) headquarters.

NEW DELHI: In an unprecedented move, the Supreme Court has, for the first time, set a three-month deadline for the President to decide on bills forwarded by state governors from the date of receipt.""We deem it appropriate to adopt the timeline prescribed by the ministry of home affairs... and prescribe that the President is required to take a decision on the bills reserved for his consideration by the governor within a period of three months from the date on which such reference is received,"" the SC said.""In case of any delay beyond this period, appropriate reasons would have to be recorded and conveyed to the concerned State.

It also established a timeline for Raj Bhavans to approve or reject state legislature bills promptly, to avoid a repeat of the Tamil Nadu situation.“Withholding of assent or reservation of bills for the consideration of the President, after their due reconsideration by the state legislature, being in contravention of the procedure prescribed under Article 200, is declared erroneous in law and thus hereby set aside. As a result of the above finding, any consequential steps that might have been taken by the President on these 10 bills is set aside,” the bench said.The prolonged delay by the Tamil Nadu governor in granting assent to 12 bills—one dating back to 2020—led the state government to approach the Supreme Court in 2023. On November 13, the governor announced he was withholding assent to 10 of those bills. In response, the legislative assembly convened a special session on November 18 and re-enacted the same bills. Subsequently, several of them were reserved for the president’s consideration.","Supreme court has, for the first time, set a three-month deadline for the president to decide on bills forwarded by state governors.
