1-year jail not a prerequisite for bail to accused in laundering case: SC to ED,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/1-year-jail-not-a-prerequisite-for-bail-to-accused-in-laundering-case-sc-to-ed/articleshow/121279987.cms,"Release accused within a week, SC directs ED



NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday said there was no ""rule"" that an accused in a money laundering case had to spend at least a year in jail before being granted bail , and gave relief to one of the accused in the Chhattisgarh liquor scam who had spent over nine months in custody.As the counsel appearing for the Enforcement Directorate took the stand that bail could not be granted to the accused as he was arrested in Aug last year and had not completed a year behind bars, a bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and Ujjal Bhuyan said it was not a ""rule"" to be in custody for a year to get bail.The ED counsel said SC had been following the one-year custody ""benchmark"" to grant bail in various cases, including that of former Tamil Nadu minister V Senthil Balaji, and argued that the yardstick be followed in the case of liquor scam accused Anwar Dhebar 's bail plea too.The bench then asked the ED counsel whether he wanted the accused to spend seven years in jail which is the maximum sentence.The court said trial in the case was not going to wind up in the near future as there were more than 450 witnesses in the predicate offence. The counsel, however, insisted that the accused was a politically connected and influential person and his bail would hamper the trial. The court did not accept his submission and granted Anwar Dhebar bail. It asked the trial court to release the accused within a week on terms and conditions fixed by the special court.SC had said on Jan 17 that in cases where an accused has spent one year in jail and the charges against them in a money laundering case have not yet been framed, they could be considered for bail.The apex court has been granting bail to various accused in money laundering cases after reading down the stringent bail provisions of PMLA by ruling that delay in trial and long incarceration could be grounds to release accused on bail. However, on Jan 17, it had for the first time said that if an accused has spent one year in custody and charges have not been framed, bail can be granted.","Supreme court said there was no ""rule"" that an accused in a money laundering case had to spend at least a year in jail before being granted bail.

According to an official document, the SOP was recommended by a committee constituted for the adoption and implementation of uniform guidelines to be followed by departments, faculties, and centres during the admission process. The recommendation was duly approved by the vice-chancellor in April last year.In addition to the student's own declaration, the SOP includes a ""Declaration by the Father/Local Guardian of the Student,"" which reads: ""I hereby declare that I take full responsibility of his/her conduct and character as a student of Jamia Millia Islamia.

In Feb, students held a sit-in protest near the central canteen of the university, demanding the revocation of disciplinary action against their peers. Following this, the university filed a police complaint, and several students later alleged that police officials contacted their parents, asking them to ensure their wards left the protest site.TOI reached out to Jamia media cordinator Saima Saeed for a comment but did not receive any response.

Mango Shipments to US rejected

US authorities have rejected no fewer than 15 mango shipments from India at various airports, including Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Atlanta, due to documentation irregularities. The exporters faced the choice of either destroying the fruit in the US or sending it back to India. Given the perishable nature of mangoes and the substantial costs involved in return shipping, all exporters opted to dispose of the mango shipments locally.The United States represents India's primary export destination for mangoes, making these incidents particularly significant for the trade relationship.Considering mangoes are perishable and the substantial expenses linked to destruction or re-exportation, traders anticipate losses of around $500,000.The mangoes had undergone the required irradiation process in Mumbai on May 8 and 9. However, according to an ET report US officials found inconsistencies in the documentation related to this mandatory treatment, which involves exposing the fruit to controlled radiation doses to eliminate pests and prolong shelf life. The issue stemmed from administrative errors in the pest-control documentation rather than actual pest presence, the report said. USDA communication to an affected exporter indicated that US Customs and Border Protection refused entry ""due to incorrectly issued PPQ203."" The notice specified that the shipment ""must be re-exported or destroyed,"" whilst clarifying that the US government would not bear costs for ""remedial measures for this shipment.""The irradiation procedure takes place at a facility situated in Navi Mumbai, overseen by a US Department of Agriculture (USDA) representative. This official is tasked with validating the PPQ203 form, which is essential for mango exports to the US. ""We are being penalised for mistakes made at the irradiation facility,"" an exporter said.Also Read | Why India can be a big winner of Donald Trump 2.0 era if it plays its cards right Another exporter, whose consignment was detained at Los Angeles airport during May 9-11, before receiving destruction orders, was notified that the shipment failed to satisfy the ""entry requirement,"" specifically regarding the mandatory irradiation treatment.The exporter firmly denied the allegation, asserting that the irradiation procedure was completed and the PPQ203 form was issued following the treatment. ""How can we receive the form if the treatment was never done? And without that form, issued by none other than the USDA officer, the mangoes couldn't even have been cleared for loading at Mumbai airport,"" he said.When asked about the specifics of the case, including the quantity of affected mangoes and documentation discrepancies, the Agricultural and Processed Food Products Authority (APEDA) chairman's office responded, ""The matter pertains to the shipment of mangoes from USDA approved facility, Maharashtra State Agricultural Marketing Board (MSAMB) located at Vashi, Mumbai. Hence inputs may be sought from them. "" APEDA operates under the ministry of commerce and industry. MSAMB did not provide any response to the email enquiry.Meanwhile, India and US are looking to seal a trade deal soon. US President Donald Trump has claimed that India has offered a deal with 'literally no tariffs'. The first phase of the deal is expected to be completed in the coming months.India aims to enhance two-way trade by seeking tariff reductions from the United States for sectors employing large workforces. These include textiles, gems and jewellery, leather goods, garments, plastics, chemicals, shrimp, oil seeds, chemicals, grapes, and bananas under the proposed trade agreement.The United States, in return, seeks reduced duties across various sectors including industrial products, automobiles (specifically electric vehicles), wines, petrochemical products, dairy items, agricultural produce such as apples, and tree nuts.Also Read | Donald Trump says India has offered a trade deal with ‘literally no tariffs’","Mango shipments to us rejected at los angeles, san francisco, and atlanta airports.

Experts: Frequent hike will shut more shops

Poll Do you support the liquor shop owners' decision to strike against the recent licence fee hikes? Yes, it's a justified protest No, they should comply with regulations





BENGALURU: Buffeted by repeated hikes in excise duties and licence fees in the past two years, thousands of distilleries and liquor shops in Karnataka are planning a strike and demonstration on May 20 and a complete shutdown of all industry activities on May 21. Store owners are planning to stop purchasing liquor from govt depots as a mark of protest. Karnataka Wine Merchants Association , along with National Restaurant Association of India and Karnataka Brewery and Distilleries Association , took the dual-protest measure after the latest blow came in the form of govt's May 15 draft notification doubling licence fees.Calling fee hikes ""steep and unbearable"", the store owners will shutter down on Wednesday. Of 12,000 licensed liquor stores in Karnataka,over 5,000 are participating in the shutdown.According to the draft notification, the annual licence fee for breweries has increased from Rs 27 lakh to Rs 54 lakh, while for distilleries and warehouses, it has risen from Rs 45 lakh to Rs 90 lakh. The new fees take effect on July 1.Industry representatives told TOI such frequent increases will lead to more business closures and higher prices for consumers. Nearly 30,000 letters of objections have been collected from employees, licensees, customers, vendors, and landlords, highlighting concern over a fourfold increase in fee this year.A senior excise department official said the hikes were implemented to address revenue shortfalls from the previous year. ""The hike was a decision taken by the govt and we just implemented it. The decision is taken to cover the gap for the previous year target,"" the official said.While the revenue target for 2024-25 was set at Rs 38,525 crore, the department managed to collect only Rs 35,530 crore, or 92.3% of the target.Retailers noted the fresh licence fee hikes will particularly affect budget-segment sales and small outlets. More than 40 pubs in Bengaluru closed last year due to rising costs and declining customer numbers.A pub chain owner in Koramangala, said: ""The hikes are eating into all our profits. Earlier, it was AED (additional excise duty) hikes, now even the licence fee is doubled. We might as well shut our businesses. Even in peak summer, there are barely any sales.""Sampath Kumar, vice-president of Karnataka Wine Merchants Association, said: ""We had a meeting on Friday with our committee members. Both consumers and merchants can't bear the expenses.""Ananth Narayana, secretary of National Restaurant Association of India, added: ""We generate so much employment, pay crores in taxes, yet the govt is intent on killing the golden goose. Last time, we saw excise collection dip after taxes increased, and many outlets went into the red. The govt is repeating the mistake.""",Thousands of distilleries and liquor shops in karnataka are planning a strike and demonstration on may 20 and a complete shutdown of all industry activities on may 21.

'Judges also human': Justice Abhay S Oka admits error in judgment,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/judges-also-human-justice-abhay-s-oka-admits-error-in-judgment/articleshow/121277892.cms,"'Even for judges, learning process always continues'

NEW DELHI: Judges are also human and they can make mistakes while judging, Justice Abhay S Oka said Monday while admitting that he committed a mistake in deciding a case as a Bombay HC judge in 2016 relating to interpretation of the Domestic Violence Act and said it was a continuous learning process for judges.While holding that HCs have jurisdiction under Section 482 of CrPC to quash proceedings of an application filed under Section 12(1) of DV Act, which says an aggrieved woman may approach a magistrate for relief such as payment of compensation, Justice Oka, who penned the verdict for the bench comprising himself and Justice Ujjal Bhuyan, said as an HC judge, he had taken a contrary view on the issue.SC said that HCs must keep in mind that DV Act is a welfare legislation specially enacted to give justice to women who suffer from domestic violence.Therefore, while exercising jurisdiction under Section 482 for quashing proceedings under Section 12(1), the high court should be very slow and circumspect. Interference can be made only when the case is clearly of gross illegality or gross abuse of the process of law, the bench said.Generally, the high court must adopt a hands-off approach while dealing with proceedings under Section 482 for quashing an application under Section 12(1). Unless high courts show restraint... the very object of enacting the Domestic Violence Act, 2005 will be defeated, the bench added.Justice Abhay S Oka, who penned the verdict for the bench, said: ""Before we part with this judgment, we must mention here that one of us (Abhay S Oka) is a party to a judgment dated Oct 27, 2016, of Bombay high court (HC) in writ petition 2473 of 2016 in which the view taken is that remedy under Section 482 of Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) is not available for quashing the proceedings under Section 12(1) of DV Act, 2005.""""This view was found to be incorrect by a full bench of the same high court. As judges, we are duty-bound to correct our mistakes in properly constituted proceedings. Even for judges, the learning process always continues,"" he said.""There are decisions of high courts taking a view that the jurisdiction under Section 482 of CrPC is not available to quash proceedings... under Section 12(1) of Domestic Violence Act. The decisions are primarily based on the premise that the proceedings... predominantly of a civil nature. The said view is not correct for the reasons set out earlier,"" Justice Oka said while correcting the orders of high courts and also correcting his stand taken as an HC judge nine years ago.","'even for judges, learning process always continues' says justice abhay s oka.

No, India cannot be a shelter for all Yes, if they have family in India

NEW DELHI: Days after rebuffing Rohingya Muslims’ plea against deportation , the Supreme Court on Monday rejected a Sri Lankan national’s plea to settle in India after completing his seven-year imprisonment sentence under UAPA and said the country struggling with 140 crore population cannot be a ‘dharamshala’ (free shelter) for foreign nationals.The Sri Lankan national was arrested in 2015 for his links with Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), a separatist organization decimated by the Sri Lankan Army. A Tamil Nadu trial court had convicted him under Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act in 2018 and sentenced him to 10 years imprisonment.However, the Madras HC in 2022 had reduced the sentence to seven years and ordered that he must stay in a Tamil refugee camp after completion of prison term and be deported as soon as possible.On Monday his lawyer pleaded that his wife and children have settled in India and that he too wished to settle in India as he has already served seven years in prison. He also said that the Sri Lankan had a right to life and right to move freely.A bench of Justices Dipankar Datta and K Vinod Chandran disagreed and said the Lankan had the right to life but not the right to residence or settle in India. “Is India a dharamshala to host refugees from all over the world? We are struggling with a 140 crore population. India is not a dharamshala to entertain foreign nationals from all over.”When petitioner’s counsel said that his life would be endangered if he is deported to Sri Lanka as he was part of LTTE. The bench suggested that he could move to some other country. “What is your right to settle here,” Justice Datta asked.On May 8, a three-judge bench of Justices Surya Kant, Datta and N Kotiswar Singh had raised similar queries when senior advocates Colin Gonsalves and Prashant Bhushan had pleaded for a stay on deportation of Rohingya Muslims to Myanmar by India. The bench had questioned their right to settle in India. “Right to residence is only for Indian citizens. It is not available to foreigners,” the bench had said.",The sri lankan national was arrested in 2015 for his links with liberation tigers of tamil eelam.

Prioritising retired servicemen, many of whom already receive pensions, over unemployed young people risks deepening the sense of alienation,” Mehbooba’s letter reads.Urging the administration to reconsider, or at least clarify the rationale behind the policy, Mehbooba called for more inclusive models to address security and socio-economic challenges in J&K.“This soaring unemployment is not just an economic issue but a social emergency. With few opportunities amidst utter despondency, many youngsters are falling into the grip of drug addiction and, tragically, some are even driven to suicide. We must come to their rescue by being more mindful of their future.”Governing National Conference spokesperson Tanvir Sadiq said the issue was beyond the UT govt’s jurisdiction as it came under security-related expenditure (SRE).BJP spokesman Arun Gupta rejected Mehbooba Mufti’s opposition. He said the Indian Army has shaped these men into highly capable soldiers trained to meet any eventuality. “We are extremely fortunate as a nation to have such manpower at our disposal,” the BJP spokesman said.“We must recognize the unmatched training and discipline these personnel possess. Their deployment in sensitive civil installations is not just logical, it’s essential. Security today is not about hardware alone; it’s about the right people with the right experience,” the spokesman said.He said the initiative wasn’t rolled out overnight. “It took three years of careful planning, clearances, and evaluation.

'Mamata forced Yusuf to withdraw from delegation'



NEW DELHI: Trinamool Congress (TMC) MP Yusuf Pathan has opted out of the all-party delegation after Centre chose him as party's representative, PTI reported citing party sources. The TMC indicated that the selection was ""unilateral"" and it should have been ""decided by the respective party leadership.""Although the exact reason for Pathan's decision remains unclear, both West Bengal chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and TMC national general secretary Abhishek Banerjee asserted that the Centre should not have the authority to choose the party's representative for the delegation.Meanwhile, the move was criticised by the Bharatiya Janata Party leader Amit Malviya calling it unfortunate, saying that this ""should have been kept above partisan politics. Members of Parliament are representatives of the people as well.""Mamata Banerjee, however, categorically mentioned that the party did not intend to boycott the delegation.""It is wrong to say that we are boycotting or not going. They need to inform the party. The parliamentary party discusses the bills in the Parliament. It takes decisions regarding the Parliament, and that too, after consulting with the party. I am the chairperson of the parliamentary party in the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha,"" she said.""However, we are never informed. We will definitely send a representative if they inform us. Why wouldn't we? There is no point of controversy here. We are fully with the government,"" she added.""The Centre cannot unilaterally decide who will represent which party. This has to be decided by the respective party leadership. If you ask for one representative, we will give you five names. But the Centre also needs to show its good intent and call for a wider deliberation with all parties in the opposition,"" Abhishek Banerjee said.Malviya attacked the Bengal CM claiming that she ""forced"" the TMC MP to ""withdraw from the multi-party delegation"".""West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee’s decision to force the TMC MP to withdraw from the multi-party delegation is unfortunate. This is a Government of India delegation and should have been kept above partisan politics. Members of Parliament are representatives of the people as well,"" he said in a post on X.""It sends a subliminal message that Mamata Banerjee and her party are unwilling to speak out against Pakistan-sponsored terrorism. What is worse is that while a caucus of senior party apparatchiks prevailed—likely because they were not part of the delegation—other senior TMC MPs are now sending feelers to be included. After all, it is a matter of national pride to represent the country at such a moment,"" he added.Congress party has also questioned the Centre's selection criteria for the delegation calling it ""dishonest"" after it rejected all the four names suggested by the grand old party and chose Shashi Tharoor among others.The Centre on Sunday unveiled a list of seven delegations comprising political leaders, parliamentarians, and former ministers from various parties, tasked with presenting India’s firm stance against terrorism in the wake of Operation Sindoor.","Trinamool congress (tmc) mp yusuf pathan has opted out of the all-party delegation.

We can, of course, consider it when it does. We are totally committed to the country's best interests."" Banerjee stressed the difference between objecting to procedural lapses and rejecting the mission. ""It is not that we are boycotting or not going. That is a wrong notion.

Two films created Hindi cinema's first superstar: Shakti Samanta's ' Aradhana ', shortly followed by Raj Khosla 's ' Do Raaste '.But the first few days of 'Do Raaste' were uncertain at the box-office. Mahesh Bhatt , a young ""production hand"" in the film, wept bitterly over the film's grim prognosis, says a forthcoming biography of Raj Khosla, whose 100th birth anniversary falls on May 31.Khosla had already delivered superhits in a variety of genres: thriller 'CID' (1956), suspenseful 'Woh Kaun Thi?' (1964) and romantic drama 'Do Badan' (1966) underlining his ability as an all-rounder. But his previous two ventures, 'Anita' (1967) and 'Chirag (1969)', hadn't fared well. Debtors were at the door.Do Raaste, which he produced and directed, was based on Marathi writer Chandrakant Kakodkar's novel, 'Nilambari'. When the film opened at Bombay's Royal Opera House on Dec 5, 1969, editor Waman Bhonsle and Bhatt were at the theatre.Biographer Amborish Roychoudhury writes in the book, ""A manager by the name of Desai, came to Bhatt and Bhonsle and said, ""Saamne woh Shakti ki picture chal rahi hai 'Aradhana', woh advance mein housefull hai. Yahan par log nahin aate. Picture doobegi."" (Shakti's film 'Aradhana', playing across the road, is running to full house in advance booking. No one is coming here. This film will flop.)""When he heard this, Bhatt broke down. Bhonsle had seen it all before, but the young Bhatt, all of 20, was emotionally attached to the film,"" says the book, co-authored by Anita Khosla and Uma Khosla Kapur, both director's daughters.The book titled, ""Raj Khosla: The Authorized Biography,"" also says that the film originally ended with some ""touching lines about mother-son relationship"" which wasn't working too well with the audience.Khosla reached out to heroine Sadhana, with whom he had worked in four films. ""Over the years, she had become a confidante and a sounding board. He showed her his films, and she told him what she felt,"" writes Roychoudhury.Sadhana suggested ending the film with a clip of the track, 'Bindiya Chamkegi', which was to become radio countdown show, Binaca Geetmala's No 1 song of 1971. Khosla carried out the change.'Do Raaste' ""ran for more than 50 weeks at the same Opera House where the staff had written the film off."" Debtors were paid. Khosla announced a bonus for some staff members. Bhatt's bonus was Rs 300, equivalent to a month's wage. ""He gave me 300 bucks extra to me for shedding tears!,"" the biography quotes Bhatt as saying. Khosla passed away in 1991. In the foreword, Bhatt describes him as ""My mentor. My master.""","Khosla had already delivered superhits in a variety of genres: thriller 'cid' (1956), suspenseful 'woh kaun thi?'

PRAYAGRAJ: Allahabad high court dismissed on Monday the Sambhal Shahi Jama Masjid committee's petition challenging a Nov 19, 2024 trial court order directing an advocate commissioner to survey the structure, the subject of a suit claiming that the mosque was built in 1526 after demolishing a temple, reports Rajesh Kumar Pandey.While upholding the trial court's survey order, Justice Rohit Ranjan Agarwal vacated the interim stay on the Hindu plaintiffs ' suit. The mosque committee had asked for the suit to be dismissed on the ground that the Hindu side's claim to the site was prima facie barred under the Places of Worship Act, 1991. The legislation prohibits conversion of any place of worship and mandates maintaining the religious character of any such site that existed on Aug 15, 1947.This is not a case where any conversion of place of worship is taking place or the religious character is being changed. The plaintiffs have only sought right to access to a protected monument, declared in 1920 under Section 18 of Ancient Monument and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act, 1958, the 45-page judgment states. In its petition, the mosque committee contended that the civil judge (junior division) ordered the survey ""hastily"" and ""without issuing notice"". Based on the Nov 19 directive, a survey was conducted that very day and another one on Nov 24.Later that month, SC stayed proceedings in the trial court until the mosque committee's petition against the survey order was heard by an HC bench.Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) said in its submission to the bench that the mosque had been designated as a protected monument under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act , 1958. This effectively means that its status is governed by preservation laws rather than religious classification. ASI also mentioned that nowhere in official records was the mosque described as a religious place.The Hindu plaintiffs contend that the disputed Sambhal mosque stands at what used to be site of an ancient Harihar temple dedicated to Kalki, last avatar of Vishnu. The suit claims in 1526, on orders of Mughal emperor Babar, the temple was partially demolished and a mosque built over it.","Hc: plaintiffs only seeking right to access to sambhal site.
