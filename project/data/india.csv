New Delhi: National Investigation Agency ( NIA ) on Wednesday arrested gangster Lawrence Bishnoi 's brother, Anmol, upon his deportation from US. He arrived here on a special flight around 2pm, was produced in court and taken on a remand of 11 days.The agency arrested him in a case registered in 2022 to investigate an alleged nexus between criminal gangs in India and Babbar Khalsa International (BKI), a designated terrorist organisation, to raise funds, recruit youths and carry out terror strikes in the country.Anmol was accused of providing shelter and logistic support to shooters of the gangs and ground operatives in America. ""He was also allegedly engaged in extortion in India from foreign soil with the help of other gangsters,"" NIA said. The agency intends to ascertain details of social media accounts through which the Lawrence Bishnoi group has been taking responsibility for various crimes.Following his NIA custody, Anmol is likely to be handed over to police in Mumbai and Punjab in connection with the murder cases of NCP neta Baba Siddique and rapper Sidhu Moose Wala.Anmol's family claimed that he is being punished for his brother's crimes. ""I request the PM and home minister to ensure Anmol's security.The way gang war is happening, we are apprehensive... Our family has always respected the law. Whether Anmol is a culprit... it is part of the inquiry. His biggest crime is that he is the younger brother of Lawrence, but he has never been involved in the world of crime,"" said his cousin, Ramesh Bishnoi.Urging NIA to ensure his safety, the court ordered Anmol's medical examination to be conducted every 48 hours and his journey from court to the agency headquarters and vice versa video-recorded on completion of remand. NIA was asked to submit a report on measures taken for his security.Anmol had been absconding since 2022, NIA said. ""He is the 19th accused to be arrested for his involvement in the terror-syndicate led by his jailed brother, Lawrence. Anmol was chargesheeted by NIA in March 2023 after investigation established that he had actively aided designated terrorist Goldy Brar and Lawrence in the commission of various acts of terrorism in the country between 2020 and 2023,"" the agency claimed.Operating closely with various Bishnoi gang associates, Anmol continued to run syndicates and execute acts of terror from US, using the gang's operatives on the ground, NIA said.Anmol was detained in California's Sacramento last Nov for illegal entry after which FBI confirmed his identity through DNA and voice sample matches. He sought asylum while he was lodged at Pottawattamie County prison in Iowa. The facility's website showed he was being investigated by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which deals with cross-border crimes and undocumented immigration in US.An incident of firing at actor Salman Khan's house in Mumbai in April last year put Anmol under the lens. A Facebook account, purportedly belonging to him, claimed responsibility for the incident. Later, police chanced upon an audio recording of a conversation purportedly between Anmol and Vicky Gupta, one of the shooters.On Oct 12, 2024, Siddique was gunned down outside the Bandra (East) office of his MLA son, Zeeshan. Anmol was named in a chargesheet filed by Mumbai Police. Soon, NIA announced a reward of Rs 10 lakh for information leading to his arrest.Anmol was also accused of providing arms and logistical support to the shooters of Moose Wala. He had allegedly fled India on a forged passport in the name of Bhanu Pratap a month before the rapper was killed on May 29, 2022.","Lawrence bishnoi's brother, anmol, arrested upon his deportation from us.

SC: 3 talaqs sent through lawyer not valid,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/sc-3-talaqs-sent-through-lawyer-not-valid/articleshow/125450139.cms,"Dr. Imam Ahmed Illyasi Explains Triple Talaq: Role Of Muslim Men & Women Revealed

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Wednesday questioned the validity of the practice among Muslim men to authorise a lawyer to send notices to his wife for divorce through three talaqs, each notified after a month’s gap, and said this would not be regarded as a valid annulment of marriage as the notices do not bear the man’s signature.Appearing for a TV journalist petitioner questioning the Muslim men’s unilateral right to divorce through triple talaq under Talaq-e-Hasan process, senior advocate Rizwan Ahmed told a bench of CJI-designate Surya Kant and Justices U Bhuyan and N K Singh that her advocate husband sent talaq notices through a lawyer, finalised divorce and remarried.“When a talaqnama does not bear the husband’s signature, it is not a valid divorce document. If, based on this document, the woman remarries, the man can later accuse her of polyandry by claiming he has not validly divorced the woman. Moreover, whenever she wants to remarry, the other man can decline citing the invalidity of the divorce document,” Ahmed said.When senior advocate M R Shamshad attempted to justify the advocate husband’s action terming it as a custom prevalent among Muslims, Justice Kant-led bench asked, “How can this be a valid practice? The notices for talaq and talaqnama must have the signature of the husband. How can a third party give the woman notice on behalf of her husband?”“Is this legal? How are such innovations made to give talaq? How is the community promoting such practices? We will not permit such processes to harm the dignity of the Muslim women.No one can give authorisation to a lawyer or any other person to give talaq notice to a woman on his behalf. If tomorrow the husband says he has not authorised the lawyer, what will happen to the woman? We have seen in many cases where the clients have disowned lawyers’ action,” the bench said.Deprecating the actions of the advocate-husband, the bench asked him to follow the Sharia law procedures and give a valid divorce to the woman, Benazeer Heena, who was present in court and narrated how she had been made to run from pillar to post after being virtually abandoned by her husband after paying a total alimony of Rs 17,000. SC asked her to file an application seeking appropriate directions for her and child’s welfare and education. “We will do the needful,” it assured.Turning to Shamshad, Justice Kant said, “We salute her for gathering courage to move the court challenging the unilateral Talaq-e-Hasan process of divorce. Think of the condition of millions of Muslim women, illiterate and living in rural areas. What would be their plight? The relief cannot be confined to those women who have the wherewithal to move the SC. We will decide the validity of Talaq-e-Hasan after a detailed hearing. ”",Supreme court questions validity of practice among muslim men to authorise a lawyer to send notices to his wife for divorce through three talaqs.

"New weight-loss drugs work, but require long-term use: Doctor",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/new-weight-loss-drugs-work-but-require-long-term-use-doctor/articleshow/125448310.cms,"You have watched the evolution of weight-loss drugs through five decades of practice. Did you think they would emerge as such blockbuster drugs?

But there are concerns about their side-effects…

The experience in the West has shown that almost 50% of the patients stop the drug after a year or so. Why does this happen?

New weight-loss drugs came to India only recently. What can we expect next?

What are the points to consider before taking up weight-loss drugs?

If you start taking the new weight-loss medications, be ready to stay with it for a long time, says Dr V Mohan, Chennai-based senior diabetologist who has worked extensively on the epidemiology and genetics of the disease. Excerpts from his chat with TOI, which is partnering with Novo Nordisk India to spearhead the ‘Choose Your Weight’ campaign, which aims to change the narrative around obesity.Q:A: Efforts to develop effective weight-reduction medicines have been on for decades. In the late 80s and 90s, drugs such as sibutramine, phentermine and orlistat were introduced that facilitated modest weight loss of 1kg or 2kg, and rarely around 5kg. Some of these drugs had major side-effects and were eventually banned. We, as physicians, began to lose hope that any drug would come along that could offer significant weight loss without significant side-effects.Then, we started getting drugs such as the GLP-1 receptor analogs (GLP-1RAs). Exenatide was the first; it came from the venom of a Gila monster in South America, and ensured significant weight loss than earlier drugs.Initially, we didn’t know how they worked, but they delayed gastric emptying and increased insulin release and glucagon reduction... They work through the potentiation of certain hormones in the intestine called GLP, the glucagon-like peptide. Researchers tried to make glucagon-like peptide itself, but it was very short-acting in the body. So, they started producing GLP-like substances.Exenatide was followed by liraglutide. We found these mainly anti-diabetic drugs offered a two-in-one response by helping people reduce weight. Not everyone responded the same way; some had both weight reduction and HbA1c reduction, others had only one; a small percentage had neither.Then came semaglutide, which took the world by storm. Semaglutide was a weekly injection marketed as Ozempic for diabetes and Wegovy for weight loss. It got approved in the US separately for weight loss and diabetes, marking the first time an anti-diabetic drug was used solely for weight loss. It became a blockbuster drug with billions in sales, and millions started using it due to its unprecedented weight loss results, often 10-15 kg. The drug became so popular that it was hard to find, and new factories had to be built to meet the demand. Celebrities started using it, and before-and-after pictures were circulated widely. They were sold on the black market. This kind of success story with any drug had never been seen in the history of medicine.Q:A: These drugs, including liraglutide and exenatide, work on the stomach, causing nausea initially. They must be started at a small dose and gradually increased to minimise side-effects. After four to eight weeks, side-effects such as nausea, vomiting, or diarrhoea usually settle.Stomach paralysis is a rare side-effect. Another rare but serious side effect is blindness due to anterior ischemic optic neuropathy. One in 7,000-10,000 people who take these drugs can go blind. Such rare side-effects will surface only when millions start taking a drug. It’s like the Covid vaccination: as mass vaccination was carried out, we saw side-effects. We don’t know why those idiosyncratic reactions occur, but we must remember there’s no big FDA warning so far. Clearly, its benefits far outweigh the risks.Q:A: Cost is a disadvantage, especially since there are no generic versions. The other reason is “plateauing”. After a patient loses 10kg, 15kg or 20kg, the drug’s effect plateaus off. In trials, those who stopped taking the drug started gaining weight. In one year, they regained 50% of the weight they lost. In practice, the minute people’s weight starts plateauing after taking the drug for a year or so, they stop as they don’t want to spend money on a drug that has seemingly stopped working.People think diet and exercise will help them, but obesity is complex. It’s not just calories in, calories out. If that was the case, there would be no need for these drugs. All these years people have been trying to lose weight but failed because of the brain: when one starts losing weight, the brain realises that you lost weight and immediately corrects itself trying to regain your weight. The point is that one needs to continue taking the drug to stay on that plateau.Q:A: In India, we were waiting for semaglutide and tirzepatide to become available. The injectable forms were delayed until recently, but by March 2026, the patent for semaglutide will expire, allowing generic versions to enter the market. There are over 20 companies that plan to make generic versions available.Companies are now developing a third drug, retatrutide, which targets three hormones: GLP, GIP, and glucagon. It’s in late stages of development and shows promise for even greater weight loss.These drugs offer numerous benefits beyond weight loss, including reduced risk of heart attack, improved kidney function, and potential cognitive benefits. They also help reduce snacking and other addictions, like smoking. One of my patients who was asked to undergo bilateral knee replacement decided to go on weight-loss medication first; he lost 20kg and didn’t need replacement as the knee pain vanished.Q:A: One has to consider that when one loses 10kg, it’s not 10kg of fat. It’s 7kg of fat and 3kg of muscle. That means from the little muscle you have, 3kg is going to go. Hence, people get ozempic facies with muscles gone… As your strength will be reduced, one needs to increase protein intake, do some weight training and muscle strength training.","New weight-loss drugs came to india only recently.

SRINAGAR: The National Investigation Agency (NIA) announced Monday the arrest of a Kashmiri college student from Srinagar linked to Delhi suicide bomber Dr Umar Un Nabi, hours after the suspect's father died in hospital of burns suffered in a purported immolation attempt outside their home in Anantnag district's Qazigund.Jasir Bilal Wani, aka Danish, had been detained four days ago for interrogation along with his paternal uncle Nabeel Wani, a physics teacher.The family said Jasir's father Bilal Ahmad Wani, 55, was summoned by police last Saturday and he returned home ""distressed"".

The Culmination

The painful truths

Investigative systems can fail, especially when constrained by corruption, negligence, or lack of urgency.

Evidence matters, but how it's collected — and whether due process is followed — can make or break a case.

Confession is a double-edged sword: powerful, but only if obtained fairly and documented properly.

NOIDA/NEW DELHI: For years, the narrow lanes of Nithari whispered the same story: children vanished, one after another, swallowed by a darkness no one could name.Inside D-5, where life seemed ordinary from the outside, investigators later uncovered fragments of a nightmare scattered through drains, courtyards and rooms that refused to give up their truth.Two decades on, Nithari remains less a crime scene and more a wound — a place where every unanswered question still walks the streets.The Nithari case remains one of country's most chilling and controversial serial-killing episodes. It centers around Bungalow D-5 in Nithari village, Noida and involves two men — the homeowner, Moninder Singh Pandher and his domestic helper, Surinder Koli The macabre tale that unfolded over years involved skeletal remains in drains, allegations of rape, murder, necrophilia, and organ trading — and a deeply flawed investigation that has haunted the judicial process for nearly two decades.The nightmare began in May 2006, when Nand Lal , father of a 22-year-old woman named Payal (also known as Deepika), reported her missing.Payal had visited Pandher’s bungalow D-5 in Sector 31, Nithari, allegedly to talk about a job for her brother — but she never returned.It was later reported that Koli had called her from a public phone booth.Despite the serious nature of the disappearance, the police response was strikingly delayed.According to a former investigator (then sub-inspector, later DSP), no FIR was registered for months.It was only after a court application under Section 156(3) of the CrPC, filed by Nand Lal, that an FIR was formally lodged on October 7, 2006 — nearly five months after Payal vanished.Things took a horrifying turn on December 29, 2006, when investigators discovered eight skeletal remains in a roadside drain next to the D-5 bungalow.This grim find, lead to the arrest of both Koli and Pandher. Within days, more bone fragments were unearthed in and around the drainage system.The discovery shook the nation and exposed the full extent of what had been a series of missing persons — children and young women — in and around Nithari.The initial investigation by the Uttar Pradesh Police came under criticism almost immediately. According to the first investigator, crucial delays had allowed the case to spiral: The FIR was filed only after months of pressure, and formal search operations began six months too late.These early lapses, he said, sowed the seeds of deeper problems.By January 10, 2007, due to mounting public outrage and the scale of the horror, the case was handed over to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).Within days, CBI teams conducted intensive searches around the bungalow and adjoining areas, recovering more human remains — skulls, bone pieces and dismembered body parts.The sheer scale of recovered remains made it difficult even for the investigators to determine how many victims there might have been.In the early months of the investigation, charge sheets were filed in 16 cases, spanning accusations of murder, rape, abduction, criminal conspiracy, destruction of evidence and more.On March 1, 2007, Koli made a highly detailed recorded confession.He reportedly admitted to murdering six children and one woman. He described luring them into the bungalow, strangling them, sexually abusing the bodies, dismembering them and discarding the remains in drains.He also made claims of cannibalism, stating that he sometimes cooked and ate flesh from the victims.The case proceeded in a special CBI court in Ghaziabad, and on February 13, 2009, both Koli and Pandher were sentenced to death in the first case.The trial court would go on to deliver verdicts over many years, across multiple hearings, more than 2,000 hearings were held during this prolonged trial.Koli was eventually convicted in 13 cases by the trial court and awarded death sentences in all, though one of these was commuted to life imprisonment.In a later case (May 2022), a special CBI court awarded him another death sentence for the rape and murder of a woman.While the trial court’s judgments were gruesome and seemed to close the case, the story was far from over.On September 11, 2009, the Allahabad high court delivered a big verdict: While upholding Koli’s death sentence, it acquitted Pandher in at least one prominent case, citing “no evidence” against him.Over time, Koli’s legal team mounted a fierce appeal. On October 16, 2023, in a landmark decision, the Allahabad high court acquitted Koli in 12 of the death-sentence cases and Pandher in two, overturning the trial court’s verdicts.The court did not mince words: It stated that the investigation had been botched up and that “basic norms of collecting evidence were brazenly violated.”A particularly scathing point in the high court’s judgment was the failure to probe possible organ trade — an angle raised by a high-level committee from the Ministry of Women and Child Development.Investigators, the court said, “opted for the easy course” by pinning blame on Koli and demonising him, instead of exploring deeper and more alarming conspiracies.The court also questioned the credibility of Koli’s confession. It noted procedural irregularities: the confession was allegedly recorded 60 days into police remand, yet there was no medical examination or independent witness.Moreover, the court highlighted contradictions in prosecution testimony about where and when the confession was made.Recovery of skeletal remains, according to the court, came from a drain outside the boundaries of Pandher’s house — not from inside, as had often been claimed.Ultimately, the court declared that the guilt of Koli and Pandher had not been proved beyond reasonable doubt, particularly because the case rested largely on circumstantial evidence.The judgment drew sharp criticism from victim families, who saw it as a deep betrayal after nearly two decades of pursuing justice.Following the high court’s 2023 acquittal, Moninder Singh Pandher was released from Luksar Jail on October 20, 2023, after spending 14 years behind bars.Surinder Koli, meanwhile, was not immediately freed — he continued to serve a life sentence in a separate conviction.But his legal fight was not over.In July 2025, the Supreme Court upheld the Allahabad HC’s acquittal of Koli in the 12 previously overturned cases. The apex court ruled that police lapses had rendered crucial evidence inadmissible.Then, on November 11, 2025, in a decisive moment, the Supreme Court accepted Koli’s curative plea (his last judicial recourse), acquitted him in the final pending case (Rimpa Haldar case) and ordered his immediate release.The man once dubbed the “Nithari killer” has now been acquitted in all major Nithari murder cases.When word of his acquittal reached his barrack, Koli had remained seated for some time, staring at the floor. Then a faint smile crossed his face. “He was relaxed, and there was a smile on his face,” a senior jail official told TOI.While Koli did give a detailed confession, the courts later scrutinised the conditions of its recording, It came long into police custody, without independent witnesses, and with no medical examination — casting shadows on its voluntariness and authenticity.Perhaps most damning was the court’s assertion that organ trade – a horrifying, but plausible, motive – was not properly probed.The investigation, according to the HC, seemed to choose the less difficult path of blaming a single man rather than confronting possible organised crime.One sacked officer, Simranjeet Kaur was arrested by the CBI in 2007 for allegedly framing false records to protect Pandher and Koli, having received payments.The mysterious death of a key witness, Jatin Sarkar, whose daughter was among the missing. His body was later found in a pond in Bengal.Parents of missing children watched as time passed with no clear answers. The high court’s 2023 acquittals were met with “dejection” by many, signaling that legal closure did not equal emotional closure.The community around Nithari, once traumatised by the gruesome revelations, still remembers the D-5 bungalow as a somber landmark.The Supreme Court’s acquittal in the 13th, and final, case against Koli left the families devastated.A 63-year-old Jhabbu Lal and his wife Sunita (60) continued seeking justice for their daughter Jyoti — one of the children who went missing in 2006 and was later found among the Nithari victims.“I had six children, and the fifth was Jyoti. She went missing in 2006,” Lal recalled, his voice shaking. “Her body was later found in the drain outside house number D5 (Moninder Pandher's bungalow where Koli worked).”Lal spent decades fighting in courts, selling valuables and even a house in Sangam Vihar, Delhi, to fund the case.Lal said, “If he didn’t commit the crime, then who did? If he is freed, that means someone else killed our children. Why was Koli kept behind bars for so many years?”Sunita Lal added, “Even after all these years, the pain hasn’t faded. Every time I pass that bungalow, it feels like I’m standing at the same place where my world ended. We never got our child back — only the memories and a lifetime of waiting for justice.”Another mother of a deceased said ""Moninder (Moninder Singh Pandher) and Surinder Koli, killed so many children. But the case is not being done anything about. Who is guilty now? Was there a ghost in that house which killed all children? They used to kill children and indulge in organ trafficking. Now they say that they are innocent. Law is letting them go; God won't.""When the Supreme Court finally granted his curative petition in November 2025 and ordered his immediate release, it marked the end of a long, fraught journey.The ruling underscored deep flaws in the original investigation: procedural lapses, contested confessions and weak evidence.Moninder Pandher, too, walked free earlier when the high court acquitted him.It was noted that during his release in October 2023, Pandher was frail, battling health issues including tuberculosis.The bungalow D-5, once infamous, now lies overgrown and decaying — a ghostly testament to the violence that took place there.Even when courts finally render a verdict, emotional justice may remain elusive for victims and their families.The Nithari killings case, is more than a crime story; it is a mirror to systemic failures, a cautionary tale about investigative hubris, and a study in how the quest for justice can stretch over decades.The courtroom battles — convictions, acquittals and final release — have reshaped public memory of D-5 bungalow.But the wounds remain: for the families who lost children, for a village scarred by horror, and for a nation forced to reckon with how easily its systems can be outpaced by darkness.","Two decades on, nithari remains less a crime scene and more a wound. Every unanswered question still walks the streets. Confession is a double-edged sword: powerful but only if obtained fairly and documented properly.

""I have no family..."" Rohini Acharya Cuts Ties With Lalu Clan, Exits Politics Post-RJD Defeat

Insult meted out to my sister is intolerable: Tej Pratap

PATNA/NEW DELHI: RJD patriarch Lalu Prasad's daughter Rohini Acharya's outburst at her brother Tejashwi Yadav and his close associates for ""abusing"" and ""throwing"" her out of home is snowballing into a full-blown family feud and hints at increasing internal rumblings over the decisions of the party's anointed heir after its bid for office unravelled spectacularly in the assembly polls.As she dropped another bombshell on Sunday by saying she was dissed for donating her ""dirty kidney"" to Lalu and was accused of extracting crores of rupees and a Lok Sabha ticket, three of her sisters - Ragini, Chanda and Rajlakshmi - left their parents' Patna residence.Their brother Tej Pratap Yadav, disowned by his father and ousted from the party last year, spoke up against Rohini's ""humiliation"".Lalu, his younger son and political heir Tejashwi and other family members have maintained silence, an indication of the division and conflicted emotions within. The party too has kept mum.Some party leaders suggested that differences among the siblings have long been simmering as Tejashwi took firmer control of the party and leaned on a set of advisers loyal to him to run its affairs. That arrangement has come up for questioning.But the Bihar assembly poll debacle has opened up this style of functioning to questioning. Rohini said everybody is wondering what fate has befallen RJD, a party that governed Bihar between 1990 and 2005.Tej Pratap said in a social media post, ""Yesterday's incident has shaken me. But the insult meted out to my sister is intolerable.""I tolerated whatever happened to me but her humiliation cannot be tolerated under any condition... The consequence of this injustice will be very dire.""He accused 'Jaichands' (betrayers), widely believed to be a reference to a couple of Tejashwi's close associates, including Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Yadav, of targeting the Yadav family. Appealing to Lalu, he said, ""Just one nod, and the people of Bihar will bury these Jaichands themselves. This fight is not for any party; it is for the honour of the family, the dignity of the daughter, and the self-respect of Bihar.""As the family fallout played out, TV footage showed three more daughters of Lalu's reaching Patna airport with their children to catch a flight, reportedly for Delhi. None of them spoke to the media. Incidentally, their departure came hours after Rohini advised women to ""look after your in-laws and families and take care of your children"" rather than parents.""I would tell all married women never to do anything to save their parents, and if they have a brother, they should ask him to donate his own kidney or ask his Haryanavi friend to do so,"" she said in an emotional post. She said she had committed a blunder by not obtaining permission from her husband and in-laws and not thinking about the future of her three children before donating a kidney to her father.Earlier, she alleged she was humiliated and abused, and a slipper was lifted to hit her. She said her parents, Lalu and Rabri Devi, both former CMs, were crying and blamed Sanjay Yadav and Rameez Nemat Khan, who hails from Uttar Pradesh and is said to be Tejashwi's friend, for her ""fate"".She named her brother too but directed most of her anger at his two associates.The developments followed RJD's disastrous performance in the just-held assembly elections in Bihar, in which the party could win only 25 seats after contesting 143. Tejashwi was officially projected as MGB's chief ministerial candidate.Meanwhile, the JD(U) asked Lalu to explain the developments and act. ""She is the daughter of entire Bihar, then why are you silent, Lalu ji... Please break your silence,"" JD(U) spokesperson Neeraj Kumar said.","Rohini acharya's outburst at her brother tejashwi yadav is snowballing into a full-blown family feud. Three of her sisters - ragini, chanda and rajlakshmi - left their parents' patna residence. Tej pratap yadav, disowned by his father and ousted from the party last year, spoke up against rohini's ""humiliation"" ""please break your silence,"" jd(u) spokesperson neeraj kumar said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125375382,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1080997,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

'One Wrong Can't Justify...': Bangladesh Expert On Elections After Sheikh Hasina Death Penalty

NEW DELHI: Trinamool Congress (TMC) leader Mahua Moitra on Wednesday courted controversy when she shared an old photo of the arrest of Bangladesh’s former poll commissioner in an election-manipulation case, saying it was a sign of ""things to come” in an apparent reference to the INDIA bloc’s allegation that the Election Commission of India (ECI) chief is ""colluding with the ruling BJP to rig elections"".Moitra, who is also the Lok Sabha MP, drew sharp retort from the BJP, which slammed her for speaking ""like an enemy of the country"".Lashing out at Mohua Moitra, BJP's national spokesperson Shehzad Poonawalla said: “Mahua Moitra is a Member of Parliament of India, but she speaks like an enemy of the country. The kind of tweet she has posted now— is she trying to say that India’s democracy is like that of Bangladesh?""""Earlier too, we saw RJD leaders saying that if they lose the election, they will turn the country into Bangladesh or Nepal, creating such a situation. We have also seen Rahul Gandhi say that their fight is against the Indian State,” he told news agency ANI.Even Congress leader Rahul Gandhi attacked the ECI-led Special Intensive Revision (SIR) exercise during a meeting with AICC office-bearers from 12 states and Union Territories where the electoral roll revision is under way.He told party leaders that the Congress must counter the drive “politically, organisationally and legally,” according to sources quoted by PTI.Rahul, the sources said, argued that while the Election Commission is responsible for maintaining accurate voter rolls, it appeared to be shifting the burden onto political parties.He also questioned how the SIR was being implemented, warning that it “could lead to the removal of legitimate voters.”Several other Congress leaders echoed his fears, reviving their familiar “vote-chori” charge or calling the SIR a “sinister attempt to destroy Democracy”.Even as the opposition ramps up its resistance, the Election Commission reported that it has already distributed 50.25 crore enumeration forms across the 12 states and UTs, covering 98.54 per cent of the 50.97 crore eligible voters. The first phase spans Chhattisgarh, Goa, Gujarat, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Puducherry, the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, and Lakshadweep.Four of these, Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, Kerala and West Bengal, head to the polls in 2026. Assam, also set for elections in 2026, received approval for a “special revision” of rolls on Monday.The second phase of SIR began on November 4 and will run until December 4.Rahul, meanwhile, has continued questioning the recent electoral outcomes. Last week, he termed the Bihar results “surprising” and cast doubt on the fairness of the process, saying the Congress and the INDIA bloc would scrutinise the outcome in detail. The party later alleged that the verdict reflected “vote chori on a gigantic scale, masterminded by the prime minister, the home minister, the EC”.","Mahua moitra shared an old photo of the arrest of bangladesh’s former poll commissioner in an election-manipulation case.

Gogoi should 'go to Pakistan' to contest: Himanta



EC orders Special Revision of Assam’s electoral rolls







NEW DELHI: With the state of Assam set to go to assembly polls next year, political sparring between the BJP and Congress has intensified, with both sides staking claim to a clear win in the 2026 showdown.Speaking to reporters in Dhubri, Congress MP Gaurav Gogoi said the BJP is on its way to defeat in the next state elections. Gaurav alleged that the ruling party carried out the 2023 delimitation exercise in a way that ""only benefited the BJP"" and is now introducing the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) as it fears losing seats.""BJP is heading for defeat in 2026 (Assam Assembly election) if only Assamese people vote; we urge people to stay alert so no voters from UP and Bihar can vote,"" Gogoi said.The 2023 delimitation raised Scheduled Caste seats from eight to nine and Scheduled Tribe seats from 16 to 19, while keeping the total assembly seats unchanged at 126. As per reports analysts say the number of Muslim-dominated seats has reduced from 30 to 22 under the redrawn map, which will be used in the 2026 elections.Addressing a rally in Nalbari, Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma escalated his attack on Congress MP Gaurav Gogoi, saying the Congress leader would ""hundred per cent lose"" the upcoming state polls.""He (Gogoi) will hundred per cent lose the polls in Assam, and then he can contest the elections in Pakistan,"" Sarma said, responding to Gogoi's earlier comments on the political climate in the state further adding that, ""Assam is Assam and we will make a clean sweep in the assembly elections.”Sarma also accused the Congress of ""doing politics"" over the death of singer Zubeen Garg to ""protect the Miyas who have encroached acres of land across the state.”The chief minister has repeatedly targeted Gogoi in recent months, alleging links with Pakistan’s ISI and forming an SIT to probe the matter, though its findings have not yet been made public.Sarma further claimed that ""the Congress is mainly concerned about 'Miyas', and the people of Assam will not vote for those who support them.”He also announced that the government will introduce the anti-polygamy bill in the upcoming assembly session. ""We will present the anti-polygamy bill in the assembly in November,"" Sarma stated.The Election Commission on Monday ordered a Special Revision of the electoral rolls in Assam ahead of the 2026 elections. Earlier on Tuesday, Sarma, reiterating the need for updated rolls, said that the exercise would help identify and remove ineligible voters.He noted that the state's National Register of Citizens (NRC) has not been notified ""due to various legacy issues,"" and that the Special Intensive Revision has therefore been deferred.However, with the Election Commission now ordering a Special Revision, Sarma said the process ""will help us weed out the illegal (voters) from our electoral process.”.According to EC guidelines issued to the state’s chief electoral officer, January 1, 2026, has been set as the qualifying date for the Special Revision. Officials said the drive is positioned between the usual annual summary revision and a full Special Intensive Revision (SIR).Last month, the Election Commission had ordered SIR in 12 states and Union Territories, including four set to vote next year.","Ec orders special revision of assam’s electoral rolls ahead of 2026 elections.

PM Modi Reveals Why NDA Swept Bihar, Says Emotional Mode And 24x7 Development Win Elections In India

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday said India is on the path to becoming a global hub of natural farming, asserting that the agriculture sector has undergone a major transformation over the last 11 years and that agricultural exports have “almost doubled”.Addressing a gathering in Coimbatore after releasing the 21st instalment of PM-Kisan Samman Nidhi, PM said natural farming is a subject “very close” to his heart. More than Rs 18,000 crore were transferred to the bank accounts of nine crore beneficiaries under the scheme.Extending his appreciation to Tamil Nadu farmers for hosting the South India Natural Farming Summit, he said, ""I extend best wishes to all farmers of Tamil Nadu for organising the wonderful South India Natural Farming Summit.""Further talking about his interactions the Prime Minister added, ""I was watching the exhibition. I received the opportunity to speak to several farmers. Someone had pursued Mechanical Engineering, PhD and was then doing farming, someone was doing farming by leaving NASA, they are preparing and training several youth. I accept this publicly, had I not come here to this event, I would have missed a lot in my life. By coming here today, I have learnt a lot.I salute the courage of farmers of Tamil Nadu, I salute their strength to accept change."" PM Modi said India’s agricultural landscape is evolving and the youth are increasingly seeing farming as a modern and scalable career path. ""India is on the path to becoming a global hub for natural farming. Our biodiversity is taking a new shape, the youth of the country are seeing agriculture as a modern, scalable opportunity. This will give a major boost to the rural economy of the country,"" he said.Highlighting policy interventions in recent years, he added, ""In the last 11 years, there has been a massive transformation in the entire agriculture sector of the country. Our agricultural export has almost doubled. To make agriculture modern, government has thrown open all paths to support the farmers.""PM Modi also talked about maintaining soil fertility amid increasing demand for agricultural products saying, ""In recent years, the increasing demand for agricultural products has led to a rapid rise in the use of various chemicals in the sector. As a result, soil fertility is deteriorating, and the cost of farming is escalating. The solution lies in adopting crop diversification and natural farming practices. To restore soil fertility and enhance the nutritional value of crops, we must embrace natural farming methods. This approach is not only a necessity, but also a part of our vision for sustainable agriculture.""On a sidenote, as the Prime Minister noticed two girl students waving placards praising him, he asked security personnel to bring the placards to him, and lauded the students.Before the address, PM Modi inaugurated the South India Natural Farming Summit and interacted with local farmers. He also inspected an exhibition displaying agricultural products and plant growth demonstrations, accompanied by Tamil Nadu Governor RN Ravi.The summit, being held from November 19 to 21, has been organised by the Tamil Nadu Natural Farming Stakeholders Forum. It aims to promote sustainable, eco-friendly and chemical-free farming, and to accelerate the shift towards natural and regenerative agriculture as a climate-smart and economically viable model. It will also focus on creating market linkages for farmer-producer organisations and rural entrepreneurs, while showcasing innovations in organic inputs, agro-processing, eco-friendly packaging and indigenous technologies. Over 50,000 farmers, practitioners, scientists, sellers and stakeholders from Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, Kerala, Telangana, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh are expected to participate.Earlier in the day, PM Modi visited Andhra Pradesh to participate in the birth centenary celebrations of Sri Satya Sai Baba.

NEW DELHI: AIMIM supremo Asaduddin Owaisi on Wednesday reacted sharply to a widely shared video of Delhi car-blast suicide bomber Umar Nabi. Condemning the clip, the Hyderabad MP said, ""Suicide is haram in Islam"" and added that ""killing of innocents is a grave sin. ""Posting on X, Owaisi wrote: ""There is an undated video of Delhi blasts accused Umar Nabi justifying suicide bombing as ‘martyrdom,’ and that it’s ‘misunderstood.’ Suicide is haram in Islam and the killing of innocents is a grave sin. Such acts are also against the law of the land. They are not ‘misunderstood’ in any way. This is terrorism and nothing else.""He then targeted Union home minister Amit Shah over the blast, which took place near the historic Red Fort, questioning how such an attack went undetected. Owaisi wrote: ""During Operation Sindoor and Mahadev Amit Shah had assured Parliament that no local Kashmiri had joined terror groups in the last six months. Where did this group come from then? Who is accountable for the failure to detect this group?""The video, which recently surfaced on social media, was recovered from the phone of Umar Nabi’s brother and believed to have been recorded close to the day of the blast. In the clip, Umar speaks in English, appearing to explain what he calls one of the most ""misunderstood"" ideas -- suicide bombing.He goes on to describe a ""fidayeen"" strike as an act of ""martyrdom.""Psychologists studying the video said it reveals Umar’s deep-rooted jihadi mindset and shows he was prepared for a “suicide attack.” They noted that he avoided looking directly into the camera and spoke as though thinking aloud — an attempt, they believe, to make the message appear unscripted.","Aimim supremo asaduddin owaisi reacted sharply to a widely shared video of delhi car-blast suicide bomber umar nabi.

No dispute, just different points of view: NDA neta

NEW DELHI: BJP and JDU are resisting their ally LJP(RV)'s demand for deputy chief minister position in the new Bihar govt, which will be sworn in on Thursday.Leaders of the two main NDA parties held long discussions on Tuesday, with sources indicating that BJP may retain the post of assembly Speaker. There is also a buzz that JDU, too, is interested in having the Speaker's chair, but sources said it was more an expression of aspirations as the two allies worked out the details of the new govt.It is learnt that Union minister Chirag Paswan-led LJP(RV), which has 19 MLAs and brings crucial Dalit votes to the alliance, is keen on having a deputy CM from its quota.BJP has two deputy CMs in the outgoing govt and is expected to keep the post to itself in the new dispensation as well. The name of Arun Bharti, the member of Lok Sabha from Jamui and Chirag's brother-in-law, was doing the rounds in political circles as LJP's choice for the position of deputy CM.Home minister Amit Shah and BJP president J P Nadda held talks with JDU working president Sanjay Jha and Lalan Singh, the regional party's presence in the Modi cabinet, as the composition of the new govt is likely to be somewhat different from the outgoing one due to the rise in JDU's numbers and entry of two new parties - LJP(RV) and Upendra Kushwaha's Rashtriya Lok Morcha.It is natural for allies to have different points of view in thrashing out the details of a govt with five parties. But there is no dispute,"" a key functionary said.National Democratic Alliance won a thumping majority by bagging 202 seats in the 243-member assembly. BJP emerged as the single largest party with 89 seats, while JDU is close behind with 85. This contrasts starkly with the outgoing assembly in which BJP had 80 MLAs and JDU 43. This reflected in the power equation in the current govt in which BJP has 21 ministers as against 14 from its allies, including Nitish and an Independent MLA.This is for the first time that BJP and JDU have nearly equal strength. Until its number declined sharply in 2020, JDU was the dominant partner since they won their first state poll together in 2005. However, BJP has always endorsed Nitish's leadership.HAM(S) and RLM, having five and four MLAs each, are expected to get one berth in the new govt, while Paswan's party may bag two to three ministerial positions.BJP has two deputy CMs, one Kushwaha (OBC) and one Bhumihar (upper caste), in the outgoing govt. The party on Tuesday named an observer and two co-observers for the meeting of its legislature party to elect their leader. The choice of its three central leaders is rich on social messaging with Uttar Pradesh deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya, a prominent OBC face of the party in the state, being joined by Union law minister Arjun Ram Meghwal, a Dalit, and former Union minister Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti, who comes from most backward Nishad caste.Deputy CM Samrat Chaudhary, who has seen as a rapid rise in BJP, is current legislature party leader and is being seen as a frontrunner for the position again.A joint meeting of NDA parties is expected to elect Nitish as their leader on Wednesday. PM Narendra Modi and Union ministers Rajnath Singh and Amit Shah besides other NDA heavyweights will be joining the oath-taking ceremony to be held in Patna's sprawling Gandhi Maidan in the presence of a big crowd.","Bjp and jdu are resisting their ally ljp(rv)'s demand for deputy chief minister position in the new bihar govt, which will be sworn in on thursday.

How NIA coordinated Bishnoi’s deportation from US



NEW DELHI: Gangster Anmol Bishnoi was remanded to 11-day NIA custody after he was deported from US on Wednesday. The fugitive landed in Delhi earlier in the day and is wanted in the murder of NCP leader Baba Siddique.On the run since 2022, US-based Anmol Bishnoi is the 19th person to be arrested in connection with the terror syndicate headed by his imprisoned brother, Lawrence Bishnoi.He was chargesheeted by the NIA in March 2023 after investigators found that he had assisted designated terrorist Goldy Brar and Lawrence Bishnoi in carrying out multiple terror activities in India between 2020 and 2023.The NIA coordinated Anmol Bishnoi’s deportation from the US, working with American federal agencies to facilitate his return.Confirmation of his removal came through an automated DHS-VINE notification sent to Zeeshan Siddiqui, son of the late Baba Siddiqui, after he sought clarity from US authorities due to the lack of updates from Mumbai Police. The alert stated that Anmol had been officially removed from US soil on November 18, 2025.Anmol’s deportation followed his arrest in Sacramento last year for illegal entry, with the FBI verifying his identity through DNA and voice analysis. Detained at a jail in Iowa while under ICE investigation, he remained on US radar—especially after a Facebook account linked to him claimed responsibility for the firing outside Salman Khan’s home, and an audio clip allegedly captured his conversation with shooter Vicky Gupta.",Gangster anmol bishnoi was remanded to 11-day nia custody after he was deported from us on wednesday.

‘Nitish Still X-Factor’ Pavan Verma Decodes Why Jan Suraaj Couldn’t Break Through in Bihar Polls

NEW DELHI: Jan Suraaj supremo Prashant Kishor on Tuesday said he takes '100 per cent responsibility' for his party’s poor performance in the 2025 Bihar Assembly elections. This was his first reaction after the poll verdict.Interacting with reporters in Patna, Kishor admitted: “We made an honest effort, but it was completely unsuccessful. There’s no harm in admitting this. Forget about systemic change; we couldn’t even bring about a change in power. But we certainly played some role in changing Bihar’s politics… There must have been some mistake in our efforts, in our thinking, in the way we explained that the public had not elected us. If the public did not show faith in us, then the responsibility for that is completely mine. I take that responsibility 100% on myself, that I could not win the faith of the people of Bihar.”Kishor has also vowed to observe a ‘maun upvas’ (vow of silence) for “failing to change the government”. As an act of atonement, he announced that he will undertake a day-long silent fast at the Gandhi Bhitiharwa Ashram on November 20.""I will work twice as hard as you've seen me work over the past three years and put in all my energy. There's no question of backing down. There's no turning back until I fulfil my resolve to make Bihar better. I failed to explain to the people of Bihar the basis on which they should vote and why they should create a new system. Therefore, as atonement, I will observe a day-long silent fast at the Gandhi Bhitiharwa Ashram on November 20th,"" Kishor said.The Jan Suraaj Party got 0 seats in the election, a stunning outcome for a new entrant once pitched as the “third force” in the bitterly contested battle between the ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA), which secured 202 seats and the Mahagathbandhan (MGB), which won 35.Responding to questions on whether he would resign after the defeat, Kishor dismissed the idea. The Jan Suraaj chief said that he was not holding any official post to step down from.“What position am I holding that I should resign? I had said that if (JDU) gets more than 25 seats, I will retire. From which position should I resign? I did not say that I will leave Bihar. I have left politics. I do not do politics, but I did not say that I will stop speaking for the people of Bihar,” he said.Kishor also vowed to continue his campaign in Bihar with greater determination despite the setback. He said he would intensify his efforts on the ground and not retreat from his mission to reform the state.""I will work twice as hard as you've seen me work over the past three years and put in all my energy. There's no question of backing down. There's no turning back until I fulfil my resolve to make Bihar better,” he said.He further acknowledged shortcomings in communicating his message to voters and said he would atone for it with a symbolic gesture.“I failed to explain to the people of Bihar the basis on which they should vote and why they should create a new system. Therefore, as atonement, I will observe a day-long silent fast at the Gandhi Bhitiharwa Ashram on November 20th... We may have made mistakes, but we have not committed any crime. We have not committed the crime of spreading caste-based poison in society. We have not played Hindu-Muslim politics in Bihar. We have not committed the crime of dividing people in the name of religion. We have not committed the crime of giving money to the poor, innocent people of Bihar and buying their votes,"" Kishor added.For years, Prashant Kishor was regarded as one of India’s most successful political strategists and was known as the man behind a string of high-profile electoral wins.But his most anticipated venture, Jan Suraaj, has turned into a spectacular failure. Launched after an extended “padyatra” in Bihar, the party fielded 236 candidates, drawing heavily on social-media outreach and promising a new brand of politics focused on meritocracy, youth migration, jobs and improved governance.Despite the high-profile campaign, the party lost its deposit in 236 of the 238 seats it contested. While Jan Suraaj had staked much on converting social-media traction into votes, the strategy evidently faltered in a state where caste affiliation, local networks and long-standing alliances retain deep influence.The Bihar Assembly elections were conducted in two phases on November 6 and November 11, with the results declared on November 14.","Prashant kishor says he takes '100 per cent responsibility' for his party's poor performance. Jan suraaj party got 0 seats in the 2025 bihar assembly elections. As an act of atonement, he announced that he will undertake a day-long silent fast.
