States most affected

Rising temperatures and health risks

Electricity demand surge expected

NEW DELHI: India is set to experience an unusually hot summer from April to June, with heatwave days expected to double in several states, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) warned on Monday. Central and eastern India, along with the northwestern plains, are likely to see prolonged spells of extreme heat.IMD chief Mrutyunjay Mohapatra stated that most parts of the country will witness above-normal maximum temperatures, except for some regions in western and eastern India, where temperatures may remain near normal. Minimum temperatures, however, are predicted to be above average in most regions.""From April to June, north, east, and central India, as well as the plains of northwest India, are expected to see two to four additional heatwave days than usual,"" Mohapatra told PTI. Typically, India records four to seven heatwave days in this period.The states expected to witness more intense heatwaves include Rajasthan, Gujarat, Haryana, Punjab, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal, Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, and the northern parts of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu.Some states, such as eastern Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, and Odisha, could see as many as 10 to 11 heatwave days, Mohapatra added.In April, maximum temperatures are forecasted to be higher than usual across most of India, while some extreme southern and northwestern regions may see near-normal temperatures. Minimum temperatures will remain elevated across most of the country, except for a few areas in the northwest and northeast.The central government has already urged states to ensure hospitals are equipped to handle heatstroke cases. Last year, India witnessed a record-breaking summer with 536 heatwave daysâthe highest in 14 yearsâleading to 41,789 suspected heatstroke cases and 143 confirmed deaths.However, experts warn that heat-related deaths could be underreported due to inadequate data collection.With rising temperatures, electricity demand is expected to grow by 9-10% this summer. Last year, peak electricity demand crossed 250 gigawatts on May 30, exceeding projections by 6.3%. The IMD cautioned that climate change-driven heat stress is a significant factor behind rising energy consumption.The IMD predicts normal rainfall in April, ranging between 88-112% of the long-term average of 39.2 mm. Some areas in northwest, northeast, west-central, and peninsular India could receive normal to above-normal rainfall. However, Mohapatra also warned of possible landslides in the Western Ghats region of Kerala and Karnataka, as well as potential flooding in northeastern states in April.As India gears up for a hotter-than-usual summer, authorities are urging preparedness to mitigate the effects of extreme heat on public health and infrastructure.","Central and eastern india, along with the northwestern plains, are likely to see prolonged spells of extreme heat.

Devendra Fadnavis trashes Sanjay Raut's claim on PM Modi's 'looming retirement',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/devendra-fadnavis-trashes-sanjay-rauts-claim-on-pm-modis-looming-retirement/articleshow/119830253.cms,"Maharashtra deputy CM Devendra Fadnavis

NAGPUR: Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis Monday rejected speculation about his potential candidacy for prime ministerial role in 2029, asserting that PM Narendra Modi remains the 'undisputed leader of BJP' and has many years of service ahead.Fadnavis dismissed Sena UBT member Sanjay Raut 's claim that Modi's visit to Hedgewar memorial in Reshimbagh signalled his impending retirement, as baseless. ""In Hindu culture, a child is not considered a replacement for his father while the father is still alive. Such successions occur in Mughal culture, not ours. Modi remains our leader, and BJP is committed to seeing him continue as PM beyond 2029,"" he said.Raut claimed Modi's visit to RSS' Hedgewar memorial was meant to signal his exit from active politics in Sept this year, further suggesting that Modi's successor would be from Maharashtra and finalised by the Sangh. Modi turns 75 in Sept, and BJP has an informal rule that leaders beyond this age should not hold ministerial positions.Fadnavis also countered ex-Congress chief Sonia Gandhi's criticism of National Education Policy , which she termed 'communal, coercive agenda.' Defending the policy, he emphasised the necessity of dismantling the British-imposed education framework. ""British designed an education system to weaken Indian identity. Lord Macaulay explicitly stated in his letter that unless India's indigenous education was dismantled, British cannot rule. Any patriot should support efforts to Indianise our education system. Sonia must study these reforms properly and extend support,"" he said.On MNS chief Raj Thackeray's concerns on governance and rural distress, raised during his Gudi Padwa speech Sunday, Fadnavis said, ""We are working to take everyone along in running the govt. He raised some important points, and we will consider them. As for his suggestion on loudspeakers at mosques, we will strictly implement SC order prohibiting their use beyond permissible limits.""Addressing Thackeray's remarks on deteriorating condition of rivers in state, the CM pointed to the ongoing efforts to rejuvenate state's water resources, especially Godavari.","Fadnavis dismissed sena ubt member sanjay raut's claim that modi's visit to hedgewar memorial in reshimbagh signalled his impending retirement.

(But) we will not allow glorification over there at any cost.""While speaking on Aurangzeb, senior RSS functionary Suresh 'Bhaiyyaji' Joshi took an example from Shivaji's life.

Raj had said people should not fall victim to the politics of caste and communal hatred.Joshi's comments come less than a fortnight after RSS chief spokesperson Sunil Ambekar clarified that ""the tomb issue is not irrelevant, Aurangzeb is,"" after reports had quoted him as saying in a press conference in Bengaluru that ""Aurangzeb was not relevant today.""Joshi was 'sarkaryavaha' (general secretary) of the RSS for four terms starting 2009 and was replaced by Dattatreya Hosabale in 2021.The VHP and Bajrang Dal have demanded removal of the tomb, which is in Khultabad near Daulatabad in Maharashtra, and riots broke out in Nagpur on March 17 after the VHP's alleged act of burning an effigy of Aurangzeb and of a symbol of the tomb.Fadnavis, who is from Nagpur and of the favourites of the Sangh leadership, led BJP to a huge victory in the 2024 Maharashtra elections on an unabashedly Hindutva platform where he called upon Hindus to come together to foil ""vote jihad,"" a reference to the effort of opposition parties to consolidate Muslims against BJP.","Shivaji our ideal, he built tomb for even afzal khan: bhaiyyaji joshi.

This emerges from data revealed by the health ministry in response to a question in Parliament.Data from an earlier response in Parliament and the CGHS website show that the number of CGHS beneficiaries has gone up from 34.2 lakh in 2019-20 to 47.6 lakh in 2023-24, an increase of 39%. The latest reply reveals that reimbursement to private hospitals for treatment has gone up by almost 300% - from Rs 935 crore to Rs 3,646 crore in this period.While answering the question on March 21, the minister referred to an advisory issued by the CGHS headquarters in Dec last year to empanelled hospitals stating that it had come to the directorate's attention that some healthcare organisations were ""engaging in fraudulent activities when submitting bills"" and that it had received complaints from beneficiaries about ""overcharging, denial of treatment and other grievances"".Unlike Ayushman Bharat, where there is a ceiling of Rs 5 lakh, CGHS has no ceiling on how much you can spend on one patient. ""So, you keep milking the exchequer with no accountability, no ceiling and no checks and balances. There is no oversight over whether treatment was necessary, whether it contributed to the individual's health, whether it could have been prevented,"" remarked a public health expert, adding that the hospitals were only concerned with doing a procedure and getting paid for it.Between 2019-20 and 2023-24 the total spending on CGHS went up by 54%. ""The increase in spending on private hospitals is concerning since it shows neglect of preventive care, and low-cost ambulatory management by CGHS doctors in their set up, in preference to demand-driven, hospital-based and curative care.

HIV+ status no ground to deny CAPF job or promotion: High court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hiv-status-no-ground-to-deny-capf-job-or-promotion-high-court/articleshow/119825974.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court has ruled that individuals living with HIV cannot be denied appointment or promotion, as authorities are legally bound to provide ""reasonable accommodation"" in employment. It directed the central armed police forces (CAPF) to review the cases of three affected personnel.The case involved two constables from the Border Security Force (BSF) and Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) denied promotions, and a BSF constable on probation refused appointment in 2023. The petitioners argued that their rejection based solely on HIV-positive status violated the HIV Act, which prohibits such discrimination.The court stated that employers must prove administrative or financial hardship to deny reasonable accommodation. It ruled that denying promotions due to not meeting the ""SHAPE-1"" medical category contradicts the HIV Act's protections.Similarly, the BSF constable's termination was deemed discriminatory, and the court ordered a fresh review of his service status. It acknowledged that HIV-positive personnel could be fit for duty, though with some restrictions on postings or job roles.If reassessment finds the petitioners fit, they will be granted notional seniority and related benefits from the date of denial, excluding salary differences between the two posts, the court concluded. tnn","Delhi high court rules that individuals living with hiv cannot be denied appointment or promotion.

Public interest overrides reputation in mass petitions: High court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/public-interest-overrides-reputation-in-mass-petitions-high-court/articleshow/119825651.cms,"KOLKATA: Public interest outweighs the right to reputation when mass complaints are filed against a person in private, Calcutta high court has said.The HC, in a March 28 order, also quashed a defamation case against about 287 people who sent a mass complaint to the chief minister against the superintendent of Burdwan-based Satish Chandra Shilpa Bidyalaya alleging illegal activities. The school is a branch of Siksha Niketan that was founded by educationist and freedom fighter Bijoy Kumar Bhattacharya.In their letter to the CM and the state technical education and training minister in 2013, the mass petitioners had made a slew of allegations against the school superintendent. Countering them, the superintendent, along with students, staff members and local residents, wrote to the minister claiming the allegations were ""false and baseless"". An inquiry by the director of the state Directorate of Industrial Training revealed that the allegations against the superintendent could not be substantiated as the accusers could not provide any proof.The school superintendent then filed a criminal defamation case against the mass petitioners, claiming they had not only maligned him but tarnished his image in the eyes of all concerned, including teachers, students, staff members, guardians and locals.The main contention before Justice Ajay Kumar Gupta was whether the mass complaint could be punishable as defamation, criminal intimidation, and criminal conspiracy. Justice Gupta ruled out defamation, observing that the mass complaint was on a matter of public interest that was submitted to an authority, and was never made public as per the claims of the mass petitioners.""This mass petition is for the protection of the institution or the students or their own rights and interest and cannot be construed as malice and imputation of reputation in public or society as such, cannot be said to have been made with intent to defame the complainant,"" the court said.",Calcutta high court quashes defamation case against 287 people.

"Land not available, Kashipur's historic horse market shuts down",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/land-not-available-kashipurs-historic-horse-market-shuts-down/articleshow/119825468.cms,"RUDRAPUR: The annual ' Nakhasa Bazaar ,' a 170-year-old tradition of the Chaiti fair in Udham Singh Nagar's Kashipur, which is held during the Navratras, has been cancelled this year due to unavailability of land. Known for rare horse breeds, the market once drew traders from across India. According to local lore, even bandits like Sultana Daku and Phoolan Devi ""blended into the crowd to buy horses"".The market's abrupt closure marks the end of an era, as per locals. The two-acre land that once hosted this bustling bazaar has been divided among the Panda family, custodians of the fair, who informed traders that it was no longer available for hosting the market.Believed to have been established by Hussain Baksh, a prominent horse trader from UP's Rampur in 1855, the Nakhasa market was once a thriving hub for traders from Afghanistan, Punjab, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, and Uttar Pradesh. In recent years, however, the number of participating regions dwindled, with traders primarily coming from Punjab, Gujarat, UP, and Haryana, selling horses in a price range of Rs 40,000 to Rs 40 lakh. Over 50 horses were sold every year.""Around 10 to 12 breeds of horses would arrive each year for sale,"" said local historian Rupesh Singh. Prized breeds like Marwari, Sindhi, Kathiawadi, Spiti and Manipuri, which are valued for their speed, were star attractions. ""The significance of the market went beyond commerce. This was a living relic of our past, where history and trade intertwined. It was a cultural institution that reflected the socio-economic dynamics of the region. Its closure is a loss not just for Kashipur but for the entire region,"" Singh said.In recent years, the dwindling number of buyers had cast a shadow over the market's existence. The news of the bazaar's closure came as a shock for many traders who had travelled long distances, expecting another successful season. On Sunday morning, around 100 horses arrived from cities across UP and Rajasthan, only to be turned away. ""We were ready to set up shop, but there was no space available,"" said a trader, his voice heavy with frustration.Chief priest of Ma Bal Sundari Devi temple, Krishna Gopal Agnihotri, told TOI: ""We had no choice but to ask the horse traders to return."" As traders packed up their horses and began the long journey home, the dust settled on an empty field that had once pulsed with life.","Nakhasa bazaar is a 170-year-old tradition of the chaiti fair in udham singh nagar's kashipur.
