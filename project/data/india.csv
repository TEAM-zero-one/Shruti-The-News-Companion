Govt-issued pension order Pre1987 official document from any govt or PSU Birth certificate Passport matriculation orother school certificates Permanent residence certificate Forest rights certificate Caste certificate NRC (where available) Family register from local authorities Land or house allotment certificate from govt agencies

Oppn demands & concerns

EC response

A special revision of Bihar’s electoral rolls has triggered political friction before this year’s assembly elections, with opposition parties questioning the document requirements and timing. Supreme Court will hear petitions on July 10 challenging EC’s decision to carry out the exercise in the poll-bound state .EC says the special intensive revision (SIR) aims to eliminate duplicate and bogus voters, especially those listed both at permanent and current addresses. EC insists that only residents currently living in an area should be on its voter rolls, in accordance with constitutional norms ensuring that only Indian citizens can vote. The exercise, last conducted in 2003, targets updated enrolment and removal of ineligible entries. Bihar currently has around 7.9 crore registered voters.Millions of Bihar residents have migrated elsewhere for work or education but remain enrolled in their native constituencies. EC clarifies that names already in the 2003 electoral rolls — available at https:// voters.eci.gov.in — or of their descendants need no documentary proof of ancestry when submitting the fresh enumeration forms being distributed by boothlevel officers.EC excludes Aadhaar, ration, and MGNREGA cards from valid proof, citing concerns that illegal immigrants, especially from Bangladesh, may have obtained these documents. Govt fears such entries in border regions like Seemanchal, near Bengal and Nepal. Aadhaar-based documents are seen as vulnerable to misuse and suspected foreigners flagged by officials can be referred under Citizenship Act.Opposition parties argue that most accepted documents require Aadhaar-based verification. They also cite the 2011 socio-economic census showing that 65.58% of rural households in Bihar own no land - making land-linked documents inaccessible to many . Critics say the short deadline - less than a month - is insufficient, especially for those lacking birth or school certificates.CEC Gyanesh Kumar said the process would ensure inclusion of all eligible voters. EC clarified that if documents are found lacking after the draft rolls are published on Aug 1, voters will have another opportunity to submit them during the scrutiny phase.","Ec excludes aadhaar, ration, and mgnrega cards from valid proof.

NEW DELHI: The Centre on Monday submitted to National Green Tribunal (NGT), in a sealed envelope, the report of the high-powered committee (HPC) set up by it in 2023 to revisit green clearances for the Rs 81,000-crore Great Nicobar Island mega infrastructure project. The report is unlikely to be made public, with the environment ministry having earlier cited national security as grounds for keeping it under wraps.Spread over 16,610 hectares, the ambitious project has multiple components, including construction of an integrated international container transshipment terminal, a township, a civil and military use airport and a 450 MVA gasand solar-based power plant.Apart from the HPC’s report, the environment ministry, in an additional affidavit before the NGT on Monday, submitted that Rs 80 crore has been released till Mar towards wildlife conservation plans and healthcare.The NGT is hearing an ongoing matter on alleged environmental violations in the project.The HPC, headed by the environment secretary, was constituted by the tribunal.In Dec last year, the environment ministry told Parliament that the HPC report had not been made public as it takes up issues and facts related to the strategic interests and security of the country.","The report is unlikely to be made public, with the environment ministry having earlier cited national security as grounds for keeping it under wraps.spread over 16,610 hectares, the ambitious project has multiple components, including construction of an integrated international container transshipment terminal.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122309102,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-21214,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Several areas of Delhi experienced rainfall on Monday morning, bringing much-needed relief from the hot and humid weather that had gripped the city over the past few days.The rain began early, with low-hanging clouds blanketing the skies across the capital. The showers helped lower temperatures and ease the lingering humidity.However, the persistent rain also led to waterlogging in some parts of the city, including the Mehrauli-Badarpur Road. Vehicles were seen navigating through the flooded streets, causing traffic disruptions in affected areas.The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued a yellow alert for Monday, warning of thunderstorms, lightning, and squalls across all districts of Delhi.The advisory covers north, north-east, north-west, south, south-west, south-east, and west Delhi, where storm activity is expected today.As of now, no weather alerts have been issued for the coming days.In a press statement released on July 6, IMD Delhi said, “Generally cloudy skies.

PUNE: Police commissioner Amitesh Kumar said on Sunday that a fake narrative about the city's ""collapsing law and order"" situation was being built based on an ""entirely false and misleading complaint of a very serious nature"" authorities had received recently.Kumar did not specify the nature of the complaint while speaking at the inauguration of a new police chowkey under the Sinhagad Road police station. However, his observation came against the backdrop of a 22-year-old woman's complaint that an unidentified delivery agent entered her 11th-floor flat in Pune last Wednesday, sprayed some chemical to render her unconscious, and raped her. She had also alleged that the man used her cellphone to take a selfie and keyed in a threat message, ‘I will come back'.Also read: Top cop says 22-year-old woman filed false complaint; tried to portray city as unsafe ""However, our teams busted the same within 24 hours by establishing that the complaint given by the woman was entirely false and misleading and tended to hide information from police,"" Kumar told TOI later.He added: ""There is a part of consent in the case, and this consent we have already established. The woman called her friend to her house. The selfie was clicked with her consent, which she later edited. The woman complained to the police about an unknown courier delivery person, which is not the case.Secondly, she stated that there was forceful entry and use of spray before she was raped, and that too turned out to be misleading. The investigations have also revealed the two had some arguments following which the woman lodged the misleading complaint.""Deputy commissioner of police (Zone V), Rajkumar Shinde, said: ""We have received her medical report from the Sassoon General Hospital. However, these reports are inconclusive.""The woman holds a BE (data science) degree and works with an IT company in Kalyaninagar. Her complaint created a major uproar across the country before the police established there were discrepancies in her account.Also read: No forced entry, no use of spray, selfie with consent, says top cop; friend detained based on phone location Investigators also said she herself wrote the threat message after the friend left her flat.On Saturday, the police got her to record her statement before a Judicial Magistrate First Class in view of the frequent changes she kept making in the narration of the incident. This was also after she and her friend were made to sit in front of each other and questioned. She has also been referred to counselling. Referring to these events as ""a very serious complaint"" received by the authorities, Kumar noted that a fake narrative was being constructed, one alleging that Pune's law and order systems were ""collapsing"".Officials from Kondhwa police on Saturday also recorded the statement of a woman professor with a private engineering college who was in touch with the woman before the registration of the rape complaint, they said.""The professor is the complainant's friend and guide and was in touch with the complainant on Wednesday.

Poll Do you believe that the judicial system should allow the government to file FIRs without prior permission? Yes, it should No, it should not

NEW DELHI: Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar on Monday reiterated Justice Yashwant Varma's case and said that the government was handicapped due to a three-decade-old judicial order that prevented it from registering a First Information Report (FIR) without prior permission from the judiciary.Dhankhar, who is on a two-day visit to Kerala, has interacted with students and faculty at the National University of Advanced Legal Studies (NUALS), Kochi.Calling the Yashwant Varma cash-at-home case 'ghastly crime,' Dhankhar referring to the large stash of cash recovered from a judge's official residence, he questioned, “Is this money tainted? What is its source? How did it land in a judge’s quarters? Who does it actually belong to?”He stressed that several legal provisions appear to have been violated and expressed hope that an FIR would be filed promptly. Referring to Ides of March film, the Vice President said that the judiciary had 'Ides of March' on the night intervening 14th and 15th March: a terrible time!""Cash in large amount was found the official residence of a judge of the High Court. Now, if that cash was found, the system should have moved immediately and the first process would have been to deal with it as a criminal act, find out those who are culpable and bring them to justice. But so far, there has been no FIR,"" Dhankhar said.""The government at the central level is handicapped because an FIR cannot be registered in view of a judgment of the Supreme Court rendered in early 90s. I'm all for independence of Judiciary.I'm a strong votary of protecting judges. We must protect our Judges from frivolous litigation. But when something like this happens, it is worrisome,"" he added.Earlier, on June 4, parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju said the government would bring out a resolution in Parliament in the monsoon session for impeachment motion against Justice Varma. Justice Varma was subject of a probe by a Supreme Court-appointed panel after a fire incident at his Delhi residence led to the discovery of several burnt sacks of cash at the outhouse.","Vp jagdeep dhankhar is on a two-day visit to kerala.

"Plane on runway, incoming SWISS flight safely executes last-minute go-around at IGIA",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/plane-on-runway-incoming-swiss-flight-safely-executes-last-minute-go-around-at-igia/articleshow/122305066.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: The alertness of Delhi air traffic control (ATC) and pilots operating a SWISS flight to IGIA late Sunday (July 6) saved the day when another aircraft ahead of the European airliner first slowed down in air and then didn't vacate the runway from the first available rapid exit taxiway. As a result, the spacing between the two arriving aircraft in air reduced from the four nautical miles that was being maintained by ATC at that time and then the other plane was on the runway for 25-30 seconds longer than it should have. The ATC asked pilots of the SWISS Airbus A330 to go around when it was at an altitude of about 1,400 feet and it then landed safely in the second attempt.This happened after 11.40 pm on Sunday when SWISS LX 146 was flying in from Zurich and an Indian carrier’s A320 from Phuket was ahead of it in the sequence of landing. According to senior ATC officials, the aircraft flying in from Phuket was “four nautical miles (NM) from touchdown on runway 11R and LX 146 behind it was about eight NM from touchdown. The other aircraft reduced speed on final approach. Subsequently, Swiss was also asked to reduce speed to minimum speed by the approach controller. ”ATC asked the SWISS flight to “continue approach” because even this slightly reduced horizontal separation would have been enough for it to land had the other plane landed and vacated runway 11R using the first rapid exit taxiway.Made at 120 degrees to the runway, this alignment of the Y1 rapid exit taxiway would have made it possible for the aircraft to vacate the runway on landing roll itself and then LX 146 touching down.“After landing, tower controller (ATC) asked pilot of the other plane to vacate the runway via rapid exit taxiway Y1. But the pilot informed that the aircraft will vacate the runway by Y2, which is further down the runway and farther away from Y1. This resulted in increased runway occupancy time by 25-30 seconds,” said the official.Since this flight could not vacate the runway in time, the tower controller asked the SWISS flight to “go around” or carry out a missed approach for “safety reasons.” Flight tracking sites show the Lufthansa group airliner did so when it was at an altitude of 1,400 feet. It landed safely in its second attempt at 11.51 pm, as per flight tracking sites.At that time, Delhi was witnessing easterly winds — which is a common during monsoon. IGIA’s main runway 10/28 has been closed for repairs since June 15. With three operational runways (minus 10/28) and easterly winds, Delhi can handle a maximum of up to 32 arrivals in an hour. While learning from the fiasco earlier this summer, number of flights has been cut at Delhi. Still ATC and pilots have to be extra careful to operate in circumstances to maximise aircraft movement.“We are operating amid a shortage of experienced manpower. Whether it is Delhi or Mumbai, the crunch situation leaves low margin for error. An aircraft slowing down or taking longer than anticipated to vacate the runway, means quick decisions in real time to ensure safety,” said multiple air traffic controllers.",The alertness of delhi air traffic control (atc) and pilots operating a swiss flight to igia saved the day. Another aircraft ahead of the european airliner first slowed down in air and then didn't vacate the runway from the first available rapid exit taxiway.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122305062,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1182571,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Opposition united in SC on SIR: 'Will snatch votes of lakhs',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/opposition-united-in-sc-on-sir-will-snatch-votes-of-lakhs/articleshow/122305802.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday agreed to hear challenges by Congress and and 10 other opposition parties, including DMK and NCP (Sharad Pawar), to the Election Commission 's decision for special intensive revision (SIR) of electoral rolls in Bihar.Appearing before a bench of Justices Sudhanshu Dhulia and Joymalya Bagchi, senior advocates Kapil Sibal, A M Singhvi and Gopal Sankarnarayanan pleaded to the court to grant an urgent hearing as the revision process had already started and lakhs would be disenfranchised if the exercise was not stayed. They said the squeezed timeline fixed by the EC was impractical and it was impossible to complete the process in such a short span of time. After a brief hearing, the apex court agreed to examine their plea and posted it for Thursday (July 10). Bihar elections are likely to be held in November.The petitions have been filed on behalf of Congress, NCP (Sharad Pawar), CPI, CPM, CPI (ML), DMK, SP, Shiv Sena (UBT), JMM and RJD. Besides, TMC MP Mahua Moitra, NGOs - Association for Democratic Reforms and People's Union for Civil Liberties - and a few residents of Bihar have also filed petitions against the EC's drive.The petitioners took the identical stand that the timeline fixed by EC was not practical and would lead to disenfranchisement of lakhs of voters, particularly migrant workers and people from marginalised communities who do not have requisite documents and may not be able to procure it within the short span fixed by EC.Congress general secretary KC Venugopal posted on X: “It (SIR) has wreaked havoc across villages and towns of Bihar — giving crores of voters anxiety about whether their right to vote will be stolen. This is mass-scale rigging and mischief being carried out by EC, under instructions from ruling regime.”RJD MP Manoj Jha sought direction to EC to conduct the forthcoming polls in Bihar on the basis of the existing electoral rolls. Though at present SIR is confined to Bihar, parties apprehend that it could be replicated in other states too. Moitra urged SC to restrain EC for undertaking such an exercise.“The impugned order is discriminatory, unreasonable and manifestly arbitrary and violates Articles 14, 21, 325 and 326. The order is a tool of institutionalised disenfranchisement. It is submitted that it is being used to justify aggressive and opaque revisions of electoral rolls that disproportionately target Muslim, Dalit and poor migrant communities, as such, they are not random patterns but it is engineered exclusions. The present SIR process is not only hasty and ill-timed, but has the effect of disenfranchising crores of voters, thereby robbing them of their constitutional right to vote. Moreover, this exercise has been launched during monsoon season in Bihar, when many districts are affected by floods and local population is displaced, thereby making it difficult and almost impossible for a large section of population to meaningfully participate in the process,” Jha said in his plea.Seeking the court’s direction to set aside the EC’s order, Moitra in her petition, filed through advocate Neha Rathi, submitted that the order unlawfully shifted the burden of proving eligibility from the state to the individual elector and arbitrarily excludes commonly accepted identity documents such as Aadhaar and ration cards.PUCL, in its petition through advocate Talha Abdul Rahman, questioned EC’s timing, alleging Bihar’s massive migrant population faces systematic exclusion as workers lacking local address proofs struggle with complex procedures from distant locations, possibly missing compressed timelines due to work commitments.",Supreme court agrees to hear challenges by congress and and 10 other opposition parties.

BJP leader Shelar compared Hindi-Marathi row to Pahalgam attack

Nishikant Dubey

compared opposition parties to terrorists

NEW DELHI: Shiv Sena (UBT) leader Uddhav Thackeray on Monday launched a scathing attack on BJP over the whereabouts of Pahalgam terrorists and asked, ""did they join your party?""While speaking to reporters, Thackeray asked the ruling party, ""where are the terrorists of Pahalgam attack now and why haven't they been caught yet?""Targeting the saffron party further, he said, ""Is it another case of Washing Powder BJP?""This comes after a few BJP leaders compared Hindi-Marathi row and opposition parties to Pahalgam attack, which took place on April 22.Maharashtra minister and BJP leader Ashish Shelar on Sunday compared the agony of Pahalgam terror attack , where Hindus were killed in the name of religion, and those getting ""beaten up"" in the name of language.""All these incidents cause pain, suffering, and mental distress. In Pahalgam, they shot them after asking about their religion. And here, they beat up the innocent Hindus just because of the language they speak. Such cases create a disturbance,"" Shelar said.Shelar's statement came after reports of violence and vandalism in Maharashtra amid the ongoing Hindi-Marathi controversy.On Saturday, police arrested five Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) workers in connection with the vandalism at entrepreneur Sushil Kedia's office in Worli. Further, a case was registered against them under Sections 223, 189(2), 189(3), 190, 191(2), 191(3), and 125 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), 2023.Another video went viral that captured a group of men allegedly associated with a regional party beating up a shop owner for not speaking in Marathi near Mumbai.After the remarks of Shelar made headlines, Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Sanjay Raut attacked him and said it is wrong and shows the BJP's mindset.Sanjay Raut said, ""A few people refuse to accept the culture and the Marathi language. If not in Maharashtra, where would the Marathi language be - in Pakistan, Bangladesh, or Nepal? If people do a movement for any language, Ashish Shelar compares them to terrorists of Pahalgam. It's wrong, and it shows the BJP's mindset.""In another instance, BJP MP Nishikant Dubey on Sunday compared Shiv Sena (UBT), MNS and NCP-SCP to terrorists amid the Marathi-Hindi row in Maharashtra.Taking to X, he wrote, ""In Mumbai, what is the difference between Shiv Sena Uddhav, MNS Raj Thackeray, and NCP Pawar Sahab, and those who drove Kashmiri Hindus out of Kashmir, like Salauddin, Maulana Masood Azhar, and Dawood Ibrahim, who committed atrocities against Hindus in Mumbai? One committed atrocity for being Hindu, while the others are committing atrocities because of Hindi?""In another post, he wrote, ""Those who beat Hindi-speaking people in Mumbai, if you have the guts, try beating Urdu-speaking people in Maharashtra. Even a dog becomes a lion in its own house, right? Decide for yourself who is the dog and who is the lion.""","Uddhav thackeray asks, 'did the pahalgam terrorists join bjp?'

Woman claims rape by 4 in empty train coach at Panipat station,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/woman-claims-rape-by-4-in-empty-train-coach-at-panipat-station/articleshow/122307976.cms,"ROHTAK: A 35-year-old woman has alleged she was gang-raped by four men in the vacant coach of a stationary train in Panipat on the night of June 24 and that another train severed one of her feet as she staggered about disoriented and traumatised.Speaking to the media on Monday, she described how a domestic dispute spiralled into a night of brutality for her and left her fighting for her life.According to the survivor, the ordeal began on June 24 when her husband allegedly beat her after she refused sexual relations. ""My three-year-old son died a month ago. I was traumatised and fearful of intimacy, but my husband kept pressuring me. When I resisted, he assaulted me and warned, 'If not with me, someone outside will rape you.' Terrified, I grabbed a few belongings and walked out into the night,"" she told reporters from her hospital bed in PGIMS Rohtak.On the road, the woman says, a young man approached and offered help, assuring that she could spend the night safely with his ""wife"" as it was late in the night. He escorted her on foot to Panipat railway station and led her towards a deserted coach of a parked train, claiming his luggage was inside.""I hesitated, but he kept reassuring me,"" she recalled.Inside the compartment, the man allegedly tried to rape her. When she tried to flee, she found three more men blocking her way. One after another, all four men raped her, ignoring her pleas for mercy, she alleged. After the attackers left, the traumatised woman wandered along the tracks toward Sonipat. Disoriented, she stepped into a pool of chemical residue near the rails; moments later, a passing train severed one of her feet. She lost consciousness and awoke in PGIMS Rohtak, where she remains under treatment.Panipat GRP have registered a case against unknown persons under charges of gang rape and causing grievous injury. ""We are taking the survivor's statement as crucial evidence and hope to make arrests soon,"" a senior GRP officer said.

'Patak patak ke marenge': BJP MP Dubey targets Thackerays amid language row; draws Aaditya's ire,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/patak-patak-ke-marenge-bjp-mp-dubey-targets-thackerays-amid-language-draws-aadityas-ire/articleshow/122301604.cms,"'Patak Patak Ke...': BJP MP Dares Thackeray Cousins Over Marathi Language Row, Aaditya Hits Back

NEW DELHI: BJP MP Nishikant Dubey on Monday triggered a fierce political row in Maharashtra after warning opponents that “tumko patak patak ke marenge” (we’ll thrash you thoroughly) while responding to MNS chief Raj Thackeray ’s call to target Hindi speakers.Speaking in Guwahati, Dubey told ANI, “You people are surviving on our money. What kind of industries do you have?... If you are courageous enough and beat those who speak Hindi, then you should beat all those who speak Urdu, Tamil, and Telugu. If you are such a big 'boss', come out of Maharashtra, come to Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu - 'tumko patak patak ke maarenge'.”""We all respect Marathi and the people of Maharashtra, who fought for India's independence. The BMC election is due, and hence, Raj and Uddhav are doing cheap politics. If they have courage - they should go to Mahim and beat any Hindi or Urdu speaking people in front of Mahim dargah,"" the BJP MP further added.Leading the response was Shiv Sena (UBT) MLA Aaditya Thackeray, who accused the BJP of attempting to fracture Maharashtra through divisive rhetoric. “This is exactly the BJP’s mentality, which is anti-Maharashtra,” he told reporters.“We have asked everyone not to react to such crazy and dirty minds because they want to create fear and instability in Maharashtra… This mentality of the BJP’s MP represents the entire BJP; this does not represent North India.”Thackeray stressed that the issue was not between languages but an orchestrated effort by the BJP to inflame tensions for electoral benefit. “People from all over the country come to Maharashtra with dreams and hopes… Our fight is against the government, not against any language,” he said.Criticising Dubey’s remarks as “shameless,” Aaditya added: “Dubey is not the face of North Indians. He represents the BJP… These remarks were made with a political intent to divide Marathi and Hindi-speaking people.”Congress spokesperson Atul Londhe Patil dismissed Dubey’s intervention as ignorant. “He is foolish. This controversy is not about language,” Patil said. “It is about whether two other languages, besides their mother tongue, should be taught to students of Std 1 to 4. The child can get confused… Congress respects all languages but is against diverting from ‘Balmanasshastra’ and confusing children.”NCP-SCP MLA Rohit Pawar accused Dubey of importing poll strategies from Bihar to stir unrest in Maharashtra. “I request Nishikant Dubey ji not to try and implement election strategies specific to Bihar in Maharashtra. While he is thinking of the West Bengal and Bihar elections, he is disturbing the sense of equality in Maharashtra,” he said.Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Priyanka Chaturvedi also demanded accountability from the state leadership. “Earlier, BJP MLA Ashish Shelar compared Marathi Hindus with Pahalgam terrorists, and now Nishikant Dubey has made a statement. I want to ask the CM, why does he go quiet when it comes to standing for the state?”The row comes amid a larger political campaign by MNS and Shiv Sena factions, who have joined forces to oppose what they call the imposition of Hindi in Maharashtra’s schools. The state government recently reversed its earlier decision to introduce Hindi as a third language in primary schools, but the controversy has continued to escalate.","'patak patak ke...': bjp mp dares thackeray cousins over marathi language row, aaditya hits back.

Data shows that there has been a more than five-fold increase in booking by drivers in June compared to the April-May period.While there were 3,348 bookings in April-May or 55 per day during the two months, this surged to 16,559 bookings or 552 per day in June. Govt expects that as the number offacilities increase, there will be a further rise in the number of bookings. The scheme was launched to address the hardship faced by drivers who often slept in trucks or at dhahas due to lack of good and affordable places along highways.Officials said over 65,000 drivers have downloaded the Apna Ghar mobile app and registered on it. To attract more users, a scheme offering free dormitory stays was introduced in June 2025 with the condition that drivers have to buy 50 litres of high-speed diesel from Apna Ghar sites. The promotional scheme will run for three months, they said.As of June, 368 Apna Ghar have been set up by oil marketing companies (OMCs) including four on the under-construction Delhi-Mumbai Expressway. The entire expressway have 30 such facilities.Petroleum and natural gas minister Hardeep Singh Puri on X said, ""Most of the accidents on highways are caused by drivers not taking rest and not getting enough sleep. Air-conditioned Apna Ghars on highways has emerged as a big solution to this problem. Here, there is complete arrangement for food, cooking space, cold/hot water, bathroom, parking and bed etc. for drivers.""Drivers can book the facilities through the mobile app or directly by reaching the resting places. The govt also aims at creating trucker's wayside amenities at 1,000 large format fuel outlets on NHs by March 2027.

Shortage of surgeons & retrieval centres hinders organ transplants,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/shortage-of-surgeons-retrieval-centres-hinders-organ-transplants/articleshow/122308355.cms,"AI-generated image

NEW DELHI: India requires to perform at least one lakh kidney transplants in a year. However, data shows that only 13,476 kidney transplants could be carried out in 2024, meaning that the rest of individuals in need continued to suffer with kidney dysfunction or, in some cases, succumbed due to complications. Similarly, patients suffering from end-stage failure of other organ systems face the same crisis. Recently, govt held a review meeting to assess what ails the organ transplant process in the country.A government report, accessed by TOI, is based on a recent review of organ transplantation activities in government hospitals by the National Organ and Tissue Transplant Organisation (NOTTO). It suggests mandating govt medical colleges and associated hospitals, including trauma centres, to establish organ retrieval facilities even if they do not perform transplants themselves.Also, it has been strongly recommended that liver and heart transplants, including the lifelong costs of immunosuppressants for transplant recipients, be comprehensively included under the Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana.The review meeting was chaired by NOTTO head Dr Anil Kumar. More than 130 medical superintendents, nodal officers for transplant centres and transplant surgeons, among others, participated.Govt hospitals, with their extensive infrastructure and high patient volumes, particularly in trauma and critical care units, are in a position to expand the national deceased organ donation programme. However, it was noted at the meeting many govt institutions that have been granted licences for organ transplants were not performing them in adequate numbers, with number of deceased donations being either nil or very low.For example, while govt institutions like IKDRC Ahmedabad (508 total organ transplants in 2024, including 195 cadaveric transplants), PGIMER Chandigarh (320 total organ transplants in 2024, including 55 cadaveric transplants) performed adequately well, institutions like GB Pant Hospital in New Delhi did not carry out any transplant despite having the physical infrastructure and licence.It is important that before considering financial support for establishing new transplant/retrieval centres, the status of existing transplant/retrieval centres and the factors which impede their performance are ascertained, the NOTTO meeting concluded.Some centres reported inadequate funds to initiate or restart specialised transplant programmes such as lung transplantation, which requires expensive equipment and preservatives. The issue of high cost of immunosuppressant drugs, which patients must take for life, was also raised at the meeting.The national organ transplant body has suggested the introduction of a system of financial incentives for key organ donation and transplant team members (surgeons, coordinators, etc.) for each successful transplant and/or organ retrieval case.","Data shows that only 13,476 kidney transplants could be carried out in 2024.

The increase in toll collection is because more highway stretches have been brought under tolling, and revision in the user fee.Officials said though they expect the current trend of rise in toll collection will bring more revenue to NHAI and other such road owning agencies, it will depend on how many private car owners opt for the Annual Toll Pass, which the govt as announced recently.The toll pass will cost Rs 3,000 for crossing 200 toll plazas (counted as trips) and will be rolled out from Aug 15.","Around 80% of the toll collection (around rs 17,000 crore) has been made from nh users.

MUMBAI: A man from New Delhi was arrested late Sunday for allegedly trying to loot money from bank accounts of late MLA Baba Siddique. The man, Vivek Sabhrewal (48), a former bank employee, tried to use Siddique's mobile number to connect with an e-wallet, to gain access to all Siddique's bank accounts, said police who nabbed him in Delhi.The Siddique family had not surrendered his number after his death as it was linked to bank accounts and their business. The arrested man had submitted forged documents to the cellphone company via email, falsely claiming that Siddique's family wanted to give up the late MLA's number. The accused had sought that it be transferred in a new name which would give him access to the bank accounts.In a criminal offence lodged by the late MLA's daughter, Dr Arshia Siddique, she alleged that the scammer forged her mother's signature, with photo identity documents. Dr Arshia told TOI that she was aware of the arrest.
