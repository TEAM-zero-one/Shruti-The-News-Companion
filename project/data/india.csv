'Everything was shaking'

NEW DELHI: New Delhi and several parts of northern India were shaken by strong earthquake tremors early Monday morning. The strong tremors caused residents of high-rise buildings in Delhi, Noida, Greater Noida, and Ghaziabad to rush out of their homes.The tremor occurred at 5:36 am, with its epicentre located near Durgabai Deshmukh College of Special Education in Dhaula Kuan at a depth of five kilometres, officials confirmed. There were no immediate reports of any damage or injuries.The area experiences minor seismic activity every two to three years, with a previous 3.3 magnitude earthquake recorded in 2015.

New Delhi station stampede: No steps taken despite early signs of trouble,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/new-delhi-station-stampede-no-steps-taken-despite-early-signs-of-trouble/articleshow/118314279.cms,"New Delhi Railway Station stampede (AP)

Stranded passengers rely on each other for help in chaos

NEW DELHI: A day after the devastating stampede at New Delhi Railway Station, there were many questions but few answers. While the lack of measures that could have prevented such a situation was apparent, passengers also flagged a range of lapses ranging from absence of proper communication from railway staff to non-availability of trained medical help.There were early signs of trouble. Around 8.15pm, two hours prior to the stampede, several X users began posting about the growing crowd near the platforms. Yet, no measures were taken to manage the situation, it has been alleged.Despite clear warning signs, the congestion only worsened. One user posted, ""Shiv Ganga Express-12560. New Delhi - Overcrowded Platform No. 12 (last-minute change from 14). Despite having a ticket, we can't enter the coach. The first-class TTE has locked the door, but no one is managing the other AC coaches.""Many passengers claimed that they were caught off guard by the last-minute platform change which contributed to the chaos.Railway officials were quick to refute allegations that there was a last-minute change in platform. ""The matter is being investigated by a high-level committee. No train was cancelled, nor was there any change in platform... Let the committee submit its report and findings,"" said a senior railway officer.The sale of around 1,500 general class tickets every hour in such a situation also raised serious questions about accountability. Many passengers claimed that the influx should have been halted in time.The lack of clear announcements regarding train arrivals was another major concern raised by passengers, with many believing it contributed significantly to the stampede -particularly in the case of the special train. Passengers at the station claimed that the announcements were unclear due to background noise.There was little to no visible medical assistance available on the platforms. Stranded passengers were left to fend for themselves, relying on each other for help in the chaos.Several families that TOI spoke to said that doctors or trained responders could have made a real difference. ""Even on normal days, when the station is crowded, there's no one to assist those in need. Getting a wheelchair for the elderly or disabled is always a struggle. Sometimes, porters are paid extra to carry elderly passengers on the trolley,"" said a vendor who didn't wish to be named.Eyewitness Sharda Devi, a resident of Bijwasan, said there was a frantic rush at platforms 13-14. Seeing the chaos, she, along with her daughter and relative, attempted to move away, but security officials stopped them and others from proceeding further near the staircase. This created a bottleneck, forcing passengers at the back to push forward, triggering a ripple effect that led to the crush.At the station, the staircase and escalator are both extremely busy areas, but these aren't the only entry and exit points. There are other bridges and access routes, yet people weren't directed to use them. ""If the authorities had spread the crowd more effectively, the situation could have been much better controlled. Instead, the platforms, bridges and stairs were all packed with people, making it nearly impossible to move,"" said a passenger who had a narrow escape in the tragedy.Passengers also noted that there were inadequate crowd-control measures in place despite the massive overcrowding.","A day after the devastating stampede at new delhi railway station, there were many questions but few answers.

KOLHAPUR: Samarth Mahangade was hard at work, his hands sticky with the juice of freshly pressed sugarcane as he served weekend travellers at his roadside stall on a crisp winter morning at Harrison's Folly, a stunning cliffside viewpoint, 5km from Panchgani.Then came the call. ""Samarth, where are you? The exam's already starting."" It was his friends, their voices frantic. The 19-year-old BCom first-year student froze. The natural dissolution management paper - his first-semester university exam that had been postponed - was today. And he had no clue because his hall ticket hadn't been updated. Panic set in.The exam centre was in Pasarni village , at the base of the steep and winding Pasarni Ghat - 15km away. The serpentine road, notorious for its slow-moving traffic, would take at least 30 minutes. Time he simply did not have.His mind raced. He needed a miracle. And then it struck him - the sky.Across the clearing stood paragliding instructor Govind Yewale, who ran adventure flights from Harrison's Folly. BCom first-year student Samarth sprinted toward him. ""Bhau, I need your help. I have an exam in 10 minutes. Can you take me down there?"" Yewale frowned, his eyes narrowing. ""An exam? And you forgot the date?"" He shook his head, exasperated. But the urgency in the boy's eyes - it was impossible to ignore. After a moment's hesitation, Yewale waved over one of his paragliders. ""Strap in,"" he ordered. ""Hold on tight.""Heart pounding, Samarth was buckled into the harness. And then, with a running start, they leaped off the cliff. The ground fell away in an instant, and he was flying. In 5 minutes, they were over the exam centre.As he soared through the sky, another friend rushed to his home, retrieving his hall ticket, writing pad, and pens.The pilot expertly steered the glider, bringing them down onto the school grounds. Samarth unbuckled himself mid-stride and ran. His lungs burned as he sprinted to the exam hall, bursting through the doors just as the question papers were being handed out.A pause. Then, a nod. He was allowed in. He slid into his seat. Later, Samarth reflected on the whirlwind of the morning. ""I work to support my family, but my education is just as important,"" he said.Satara SP Samir Shaikh said traffic congestion along Pasarni Ghat was common but not unusually severe that day. Still, it didn't matter. For one determined student, every second had counted.","Samarth mahangade had only 10-15 min left before his exam started.

NEW DELHI: At least 15 people were killed and several others were injured after a stampede at New Delhi Railway Station late Saturday night. The incident occurred as a massive crowd gathered after the announcement of a special train, leading to chaos within 15-20 minutes.Among the 15 casualties in the incident, three were children, according to the chief casualty medical officer of LNJP Hospital.The situation unfolded due to a huge rush of passengers who had reached the station to board special trains for the Maha Kumbh in Prayagraj. Some passengers fainted amid the sudden surge, sparking rumours of a stampede-like situation and further fuelling panic.Prime Minister Narendra Modi took to X and said he was ""distressed"" by the stampede. ""Distressed by the stampede at New Delhi Railway Station. My thoughts are with all those who have lost their loved ones. I pray that the injured have a speedy recovery. The authorities are assisting all those who have been affected by this stampede,"" PM Modi said.Following the incident, a call was made to the Delhi Fire Service, prompting the deployment of four fire tenders to the scene. Injured and fainted passengers were promptly taken to nearby hospitals by the Railway Protection Force (RPF) and Delhi Police.The situation has since been brought under control, according to DCP Railway KPS Malhotra, who explained that the crowd surge was triggered by the delay of two trains and an unexpected influx of passengers.Railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw announced a high-level investigation into the incident and confirmed that four special trains were arranged to manage the unprecedented rush, with more on standby. In a tweet, he stated, “4 special trains to evacuate this unprecedented sudden rush at NDLS. The rush has now reduced.”Defence minister Rajnath Singh expressed his condolences on social media, saying, “Devastating news from New Delhi Railway Station.

A US military aircraft landed at Amritsar airport on Saturday night, carrying 116 Indian migrants who had been deported from the United States. Among them was Daljit Singh, who had left his village in Punjab last year with hopes of a better future. Instead, he returned in shackles, his hands cuffed and legs chained throughout the journey.""Our legs were chained and hands were also cuffed throughout the journey. There were three women and three children on board who were not cuffed,"" Daljit told news agency PTI upon arrival. His experience reflects the harsh reality of illegal migration , where many fall prey to fraudulent travel agents and endure gruelling journeys, only to be deported back home.Among the deportees, over 60 were from Punjab, 33 from Haryana, eight from Gujarat, two each from Uttar Pradesh, Goa, Maharashtra, and Rajasthan, and one each from Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir.Daljit recounted how he was lured by a travel agent in 2022, who promised to take him to the US legally in exchange for Rs 65 lakh. To secure the deal, he handed over an advance agreement for an acre of his land. His journey began in November 2022, when he was first sent to Dubai. After spending nearly 18 months there, he returned to India, only to be sent to South Africa for four-and-a-half months.From there, he was taken to Brazil on August 26 last year and embarked on a treacherous route through multiple countries. The journey involved walking through dense forests, crossing rivers, and surviving on minimal food. Eventually, he reached Mexico, where he was forced to stay for a month while his travel agent coerced his wife into signing over his land. Finally, he crossed into the US on January 27, only to be caught and detained by US Border Patrol. ""I was given only a bottle of water, a packet of chips, and an apple daily,"" he told PTI.Sourav, a 20-year-old from Punjab's Ferozepur district, also shared his harrowing experience. His family spent Rs 45-46 lakh to send him to the US, selling farmland and borrowing money from relatives. ""We were kept in a camp (detention centre) for 18 days,"" he said. ""A day before our deportation, we were told that we would be shifted to another camp. When we boarded the plane, they said we were being taken to India.""Sourav had travelled through Amsterdam, Panama, and Mexico before attempting to cross the border on January 27. ""Our mobile phones were confiscated, and we had no contact with our families. Our hands and legs were tied. We cooperated with the US authorities, but no one heard our appeals.""Harjit Singh, from Gurdaspur district, was deported alongside his cousin. His family spent Rs 90 lakh in hopes of securing a future in the US. ""We were assured that we would be taken legally, but we were not,"" he told PTI. Harjit was caught while crossing the border on January 27 and detained for 18 days before being deported on February 13.Sahil Preet Singh’s parents, from Kapurthala district, spent Rs 40-45 lakh, selling their farmland and gold to fund his journey. His mother, Harvinder Kaur, accused a travel agent of duping them. ""We demand that the Punjab government give our son a job and take legal action against the agent who deceived us.""Jaswinder Singh, from Dharamkot village in Moga, left for the US 45 days ago.

The party secured a commanding 48 seats out of 70, sweeping the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) aside and ending its decade-long rule in the capital.BJP Legislature Party meeting scheduled for tomorrow, February 17, was postponed. Now this meeting will be held on February 19. The swearing-in ceremony of the chief minister will also be held on 20th February instead of 18th February, ANI reported quoting sources.BJP's return to power in Delhi after 27 years has raised anticipation over the leadership choice. While several names have been floated, sources suggest the party is likely to select a leader from among the winning MLAs to avoid the necessity of byelections.Parvesh Verma has emerged as a strong contender following his victory over Arvind Kejriwal in the New Delhi constituency. The son of former chief minister Saheb Singh Verma, Parvesh has twice won the West Delhi Lok Sabha seat and is seen as a strong representative of the Jat community, which played a crucial role in the BJP's electoral success.Also read: Delhi CM likely to be an MLA; Parvesh Verma, Vijender Gupta in race Vijender Gupta, the leader of the BJP in the outgoing Assembly, is also being considered. Gupta secured his third consecutive victory from Rohini and is seen as an experienced leader capable of leading the state government. Additionally, former Delhi BJP chiefs Satish Upadhyay and Virendra Sachdeva have been named as potential choices.The BJP has a history of making unexpected choices for key leadership roles, often selecting lesser-known figures to introduce fresh perspectives. This has fuelled speculation that the party might opt for an unconventional pick. Some reports suggest the possibility of appointing two deputy chief ministers, a strategy previously used in states like uttar pradesh and madhya pradesh to ensure broad community representation.Another name gaining traction is Bansuri Swaraj, the daughter of the late Sushma Swaraj. A prominent lawyer, she has been actively involved in BJP's campaign efforts and secured a victory in the New Delhi constituency during the Lok Sabha elections.Harish Khurana, son of former chief minister Madan Lal Khurana, is also in the running after securing a decisive win against AAP's Shiv Charan Goel. Like Parvesh Verma, he carries strong political lineage and has been a dedicated party worker for years.The recent election results marked a major setback for AAP, which had ruled Delhi for a decade. The BJP secured a two-thirds majority, winning 48 out of 70 seats, while AAP managed to win only 22. Arvind Kejriwal’s defeat in the New Delhi constituency by Parvesh Verma symbolised the party’s declining fortune, with key AAP leaders, including Manish Sisodia and Satyendar Jain, also losing their seats.","Bjp's return to power in delhi after 27 years has raised anticipation over the leadership choice.

DEHRADUN: Over 45% of Himachal Pradesh's area is highly prone to natural disasters such as floods, landslides, and avalanches, according to a study by researchers from Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Ropar. The team recently completed a hazard susceptibility mapping of the state as part of a broader effort by researchers and scientists from multiple IITs to assess multi-hazard vulnerability across the Himalayan states. The goal is to identify regions at high risk from multiple natural hazards simultaneously and aid in targeted disaster risk reduction strategies .The IIT Ropar team presented its findings at the 2nd Indian Cryosphere Meet (ICM), held at IIT Bombay on Feb 14-15, which was attended by nearly 80 glaciologists, researchers, and scientists from around the world.The study, conducted by MTech scholar Daishisha Iawphniaw under the guidance of Reet Kamal Tiwari, an associate professor at IIT Ropar, used geospatial data to evaluate the state's vulnerability. Tiwari told TOI, ""The study found that areas with mean slopes between 5.9 degrees and 16.4 degrees and elevations up to 1,600 metres are particularly prone to both landslides and floods. Meanwhile, higher-altitude regions with slopes between 16.8 degrees and 41.5 degrees are more likely to experience both avalanches and landslides."" He added that steep mountain slopes and elevations above 3,000 metres are at the ""highest risk"". Using GIS-based mapping, the study classified hazard-prone regions, showing that flood and landslide-prone zones are typically located in lower-elevation river valleys, while high-altitude mountains face a greater threat of avalanches.The study also highlighted how one hazard can trigger another due to shared underlying causes and stressed that having this knowledge is crucial for improving disaster planning and risk management.Tiwari said studies to assess multi-hazard vulnerability are being conducted in Uttarakhand, J&K, and northeast states. ""For Uttarakhand, we are collaborating with IIT Roorkee to conduct the study,"" he said.","Researchers from indian institute of technology (iit), ropar completed a hazard susceptibility mapping of himachal pradesh.

NEW DELHI: Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis defended the state government’s decision to form a committee to examine legal options against "" love jihad "". He said that while interfaith marriages are not wrong, deceitful conversions through false identities must be addressed.“The Supreme Court has also acknowledged the reality of love jihad in its decision. Even in Maharashtra, we are seeing an increase in such cases. It is not wrong for a person of one religion to marry a person of another religion. But marrying someone by lying and showing false identity is wrong. These incidents are very serious, and action must be taken,” Fadnavis said, as reported by news agency ANI.The Maharashtra government has established a seven-member panel to explore legal provisions on forced conversions . Led by the state’s Director General of Police (DGP), the committee includes senior officials from departments such as law and judiciary, women and child development, minority affairs, social justice, special assistance, and home affairs. The panel will study similar laws in other states and recommend measures to tackle reported cases.BJP leaders, including Union minister Ramdas Athawale, have welcomed the move, calling for stricter laws to prevent religious conversions through coercion. “There should be a law against love jihad. The conversion of women is not right. Two youngsters of different religions coming together is normal, but girls shouldn’t be forcefully converted,” Athawale said.Maharashtra minister Mangal Prabhat Lodha also expressed support, claiming that the number of such cases has risen, particularly in Mumbai. He said that when he raised the issue in the Vidhan Sabha, Samajwadi Party MLA Rais Shaikh opposed it and even filed a court case against him. “Does he want to encourage love jihad?” Lodha questioned. He added that many cases go unreported and thanked Fadnavis for setting up the committee.The government resolution (GR) setting up the committee specifically mentioned 'love jihad' and outlined the panel’s responsibilities, which include examining other states' laws, handling complaints, and developing legal frameworks, TOI had earlier reported. The document noted that the decision was based on requests from public representatives, organisations, and citizens seeking action against forced conversions.Fadnavis had previously indicated plans for such a law when he was deputy chief minister in 2023. He had stated that growing concerns over religious conversions through marriage had prompted demands for legal measures.“Many cases have come up of girls getting married and converting. There is demand from all corners to make a law against this. Earlier, I had made an announcement in the House also. Accordingly, study of laws in various states is on and then the decision about it in Maharashtra will be taken,” he had said at the time.","Devendra fadnavis: interfaith marriages are not wrong, deceitful conversions through false identities must be addressed.

Assam, Tamil Nadu and Bengal account for a death each.With a 65-year-old man from Kolhapur and a 64-year-old from Karnataka's Chikodi dying at Kolhapur's CPR Hospital on Saturday night from GBS, three people have died at the govt facility within a week. Both men who died on Saturday had a history of hypertension and diabetes, Dr Satyawan More, dean of CPR Hospital, said.""By the time they were brought in, their symptoms had progressed significantly. We started them on immunoglobulin therapy and provided ventilator support. However, there was little chance of survival,"" said More, adding that nerve conduction tests were carried out on both the patients.Significantly, no fresh cases or deaths were reported from Pune on Sunday for the first time since the outbreak on Jan 5.

Poll What Is the Best Way to Ensure Safety at Large-Scale Public Events? Real-Time Crowd Control Measures Effective Planning and Coordination

VARANASI: As lakhs of pilgrims from Maha Kumbh in Prayagraj continued to reach Varanasi, district authorities extended restrictions while CM Yogi Adityanath conducted an aerial survey of the congested city roads Saturday afternoon to assess the situation.Ganga aarti at the ghats were suspended until Feb 26. Classes up to 8 remained suspended. Schools will be online only. Traffic restrictions and diversions were strictly enforced to manage the swelling crowd.The influx of pilgrims has led to record-breaking numbers at Kashi Vishwanath temple , which saw more than 8 lakh devotees Thursday alone. The trend continued through Friday and Saturday, keeping the temple premises heavily crowded.After his helicopter sortie, chief minister Yogi adjusted his schedule, forgoing his planned visit to Kaal Bhairav temple and instead reaching Kashi Vishwanath temple. He did not take the jam-packed roads - instead chose the Ganga, boarding a cruise to make his way to the shrine. From there, he returned to Namo Ghat by cruise to inaugurate the Kashi Tamil Sangamam event.With the pilgrimage season in full swing, officials monitored the situation closely to ensure safety and crowd management across the city. Devotees traveling between Prayagraj, Ayodhya and Varanasi - completing the holy triangle - added to the pressure.""In view of the very high crowd load, Ganga aarti organisers had consented to keep the choreographed daily evening aartis postponed,"" said DCP Gaurav Banswal, adding that the restriction on boat operations in Ganga after 6pm will remain in place.","Kumbh pilgrims choke varanasi, ganga aarti suspended till february 26.

NEW DELHI: Eyewitnesses at the New Delhi Railway Station recounted the horrific situations that led to the deadly stampede killing at least 18 and injuring several on Saturday night. The incident occurred when a large crowd gathered at platforms 14 and 15, awaiting trains bound for Prayagraj, where the Maha Kumbh is ongoing.Talking about the stampede, an eyewitness Ravi said when people at platform 13 saw trains on platforms 14 and 15, they rushed towards these platforms. ""The platforms of the trains were not changed, but the crowd was so huge that it could not be controlled,"" he said.Another recounted the horrific scene saying that the crowd was beyond the limit. ""Such a huge crowd wasn't expected. I have never seen such a massive crowd at the railway station, even during the festivals. People from the administration and even NDRF personnel were there, but when the crowd exceeded the limit, it wasn't possible to control them,"" he said.A passenger who lost his mother in the stampede case alleged that no police were there at the moment. He said, ""My mother died in the stampede. The doctor confirmed her death. We were going to our home in Chhapra, Bihar. We have no idea why this happened, so many people came all of a sudden and started pushing each other. There were no police.""A sergeant in the Indian Air Force (IAF) and an eyewitness, Ajit said, ""We have a tri-service office at the railway station. When I was returning after my duty I couldn't go as there was a huge crowd. I tried to convince people and also made announcements appealing to people to avoid gathering on the platform in large numbers. The administration was working hard to prevent any mishap, but no one was listening. I also helped the injured people with the help of one of my friends.""At LNJP hospital, the brother of one of the victims, Sanjay said, ""We were 12 people going to Maha Kumbh. We hadn't even reached the platform but were at the stairs. My family, including my sister, were stuck in the crowd. We found her after half an hour and by the time she was dead.""","Eyewitnesses at the new delhi railway station recounted the horrific situations that led to the deadly stampede.

Army & IAF intensify hunt for advanced anti-drone systems,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/army-iaf-intensify-hunt-for-advanced-anti-drone-systems/articleshow/118290751.cms,"-Picture-

NEW DELHI: With the threat from hostile drones and unmanned aerial systems (UAS) in both conventional and irregular warfare continuing to expand exponentially, the armed forces are stepping-up induction of a wide array of anti-drone systems but underline the urgent need for more advanced ones.The Army this week floated the tender for procurement of nine more indigenous integrated drone detection and interdiction systems (IDD&IS) to add to the ones already inducted under emergency procurements for the frontier with China.The IAF, in turn, wants 10 new kamikaze drones-based anti-swarm drone systems, 10 mobile micro munitions-based anti-swarm drone systems and 100-200 vehicle-mounted counter-UAS .Among other systems, IAF will begin inducting 200 radio frequency jammer guns from next month under a contract inked a year ago, while Army is getting around 30 vehicle-based drone jammers .“But much more advanced anti-drone systems, with multiple `soft-kill’ and `hard-kill’ options as well as much longer interception ranges, are urgently needed,” a senior officer said. These systems range from jamming, spoofing and blinding systems that disrupt the satellite or video command-and-control links of drones to laser-based directed energy weapons (DEWs) for hard-kills.A major problem, however, is that India is way behind other countries in indigenously developing such complex technologies. After DRDO developed anti-drone systems with 2-kilowatt to 10-kilowatt lasers, the armed forces ordered 23 such systems for around Rs 400 crore.“DRDO is developing DEWs with higher power. Many domestic private firms are also tying up with foreign companies for advanced anti-drone solutions. Let’s hope they work out,” another officer said.The Modi-Trump summit, incidentally, welcomed the new partnership between US company Anduril Industries and Indian Mahindra Group on advanced autonomous technologies to co-produce an “advanced AI-enabled counter-UAS”.The Army still relies heavily on old air defence systems, many of which have outlived their operational lives. “Though emergency procurements of anti-drone systems have been undertaken in recent years, they remain inadequate in countering the rapidly evolving threat from drones, which has been repeatedly reinforced by the Armenia-Azerbaijan, Israel-Hamas and Russia-Ukraine conflicts,” he added.There is, for instance, the need to develop more advanced versions of the existing vehicle-mounted IDD&IS inducted by the Army Air Defence, which at present can soft-kill drones by jamming at 2 to 5-km range, with the effective hard-kill range through lasers only around 800-metre. “There is a mounting threat from low radar cross-section UAS and swarm drones,” an officer said.IAF air defence systems, with advanced radars and ground-to-air missile systems, are also geared towards thwarting air intrusions by large UAS, aircraft and helicopters. “The lack of adequate effective multi-sensor, multi-kill systems against smaller drones is an operational gap,” an officer said.A concerted effort is required to reduce the R&D time, fast-track procurement processes and ensure rapid induction of advanced counter-drone technologies. “The domestic defence industry should accelerate the production of advanced and scalable anti-drone systems to protect critical assets, particularly during wartime and heightened tensions,” he added.","The army this week floated the tender for procurement of nine more indigenous integrated drone detection and interdiction systems.

Jobless Goa duo took donkey route in January,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jobless-goa-duo-took-donkey-route-in-january/articleshow/118313697.cms,"(Photo)

Goa's job scarcity and allure of the American dream spur desperate youths to trudge and trek via South America's donkey route. Once they cross Mexico-US border , they are smuggled to small towns where they then hope to find work as petrol pump operators, gardeners or delivery agents after paying lakhs to unscrupulous agents.For two young Goans who had left for the US only last month, this dream came crashing as they sat shackled and handcuffed on a US C-17 military transport aircraft on Saturday during their disconsolate journey back to where they started: home.Sarzora lad AC Mascarenhas, in his twenties, found his hopes crushed even before he could make it to US soil. His dangerous trek through several countries and his audacious plan of being smuggled by human traffickers in pursuit of the American dream ended at the US border. For company, he had a compatriot from Shiroda, G Souza. The two returned home quietly on Sunday, accompanied by Goa cops. This was the first instance of Goans being sent back in handcuffs with their legs chained during the flight.""It's unfortunate that Goan youths were part of the group deported. They can't get jobs here, which is why they go to find jobs abroad. Time for govt to study why youths risk their lives to enter illegally into countries like the US,"" said Velim AAP MLA Cruz Silva.","Goa's job scarcity and allure of the american dream spur desperate youths to trudge and trek via south america's donkey route.

""Why have they picked Amritsar, especially when the air route of the planes is from the eastern side and they are crossing over the entire country to reach Amritsar?

""AAP is following RSS agenda,"" he claimed.For his part, Mann blamed ""past govts' failures"" for pushing youth to seek opportunities abroad. ""Deportation from US should be a wake-up call. Instead of endangering their lives through illegal migration, they should contribute to Punjab's progress,"" he said.
