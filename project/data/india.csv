THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Tension gripped Neyyattinkara in Kerala’s Thiruvananthapuram district on Wednesday evening after RSS activists staged a protest against Mahatma Gandhi ’s grandson, Tushar Gandhi during the unveiling of Gandhian representative Gopinathan Nair’s statue at his residence at TB Junction.The protest was triggered by Tushar’s remark during his speech that “the soul of the nation is afflicted with cancer, and the Sangh Parivar is spreading it”.Outraged BJP and RSS activists demanded a retraction and an apology. Tushar, however, stood by his remark, and chanted “hail, Gandhi”, before leaving. The protesters shouted slogans and blocked his car, but Tushar refused to back down and countered with slogans like “down with RSS” and “long live Gandhi”, before exiting the venue.Congress condemned RSS-BJP activists, with party’s state chief K Sudhakaran accusing them of being haunted by “(Nathuram) Godse’s ghost”. He also questioned CPM’s silence on the incident.","Protest triggered by tushar’s remark during his speech that “the soul of the nation is afflicted with cancer, and the sangh parivar is spreading it” outraged bjp and rss activists demanded a retraction and an apology.

PRAYAGRAJ: Allahabad high court directed ASI on Wednesday to whitewash “flaking” portions of Sambhal Jama Masjid 's outer facade and the mosque committee to reimburse the expenditure within a week.HC said that barring the use of LED or focus lights to illuminate the periphery, there should be no extra lighting installation on the walls lest they damage the structure.Justice Rohit Ranjan Agarwal ’s order came on a petition filed by the mosque management committee seeking permission to whitewash the mosque and clean the disputed premises, which a group of Hindu litigants say was built over a razed temple.The court will next hear the case on April 8.ASI filed a second supplementary affidavit Wednesday in response to a March 10 court order seeking to know whether whitewashing, extra lighting and installation of decorative lights were required outside the structure or not.Advocate SFA Naqvi, counsel for the mosque committee, pointed out that ASI never explicitly stated in an affidavit that the exterior of the structure didn’t require whitewashing, extra lighting and installation of decorative lights.Manoj Kumar Singh, representing ASI, said that there was some flaking on the structure’s exterior, but it would be possible to take a call on the extent of work required only after a proper survey involving archaeologists and conservation experts.On Feb 27, the court directed ASI to inspect the site and report its findings the next day. ASI’s report said the enamel paint was still in good condition, at which the court asked it to clean the surroundings and shear the long grass. The court also permitted the mosque committee to submit objections to ASI’s report.","Allahabad high court asks asi to whitewash ‘flaking’ portions of sambhal mosque facade.hc said that barring the use of led or focus lights to illuminate the periphery, there should be no extra lighting installation on the walls lest they damage the structure.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118954368,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-413238,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

With the body of a youth killed in Manipur’s Kuki-dominated Kangpokpi on March 8 finally handed over to his family, authorities there said Wednesday they expect protests and blockade in the district to end soon.However, the road to lasting peace in the restive state may be a long way off. Ongoing talks between the Kuki-Zo community and Centre’s interlocutor A K Mishra are unlikely to make much headway with the former sticking to its demand for a “separate hill state” after hiving off Meitei-dominated Valley areas.The demand, which goes against the Constitutional framework, will not be acceptable to the Centre.Govt also does not seem keen to concede to the Kuki demand for a separate administrative framework for the tribal-dominated hilly regions either, recognising that it can fuel the demand for a separate state, besides giving fillip to separatist tendencies in the strategically crucial border state.Still, efforts would be to stay engaged with both Meitei and Kuki-Zo communities, while tactfully persuading the latter to settle for a solution within the four corners of the Constitution, including granting them more autonomy and preserving their unique culture, heritage and language.Sources said the district magistrate and superintendent of police of Kangpokpi had been engaging with Kuki-Zo protestors over the past few days to persuade them to accept the body of the local killed during protests on March 8, amid clashes between them and security forces.The killing had triggered further tension with Kuki-Zo protestors ordering a shutdown, apart from blocking roads and stopping the movement of vehicles. “The blockade call was given for all areas with a significant Kuki-Zo population. But its effect was seen largely in Kangpokpi. However, the talks between the local administration and community representatives have made headway, with the family of the deceased protester taking back his body for last rites,” said a Manipur govt functionary.A senior Manipur police functionary shared that a total 4,500 weapons, including those looted after ethnic violence broke out in Manipur in May 2023, were now back with police. Of these, around 1,050 were surrendered by rebels in response to a call given by Governor Ajay Bhalla.“The remaining weapons were recovered in raids and searches undertaken over time by police and security forces. These raids shall continue, now that the deadline set by the governor to voluntarily surrender weapons has ended,” said the functionary.Manipur MP Bimol Akoijam protested in Lok Sabha that his question about the state was removed from the list of questions after having been listed initially. He raised the issue in Lok Sabha during the zero hour. Jagdambika Pal, who was in the chair, denied permission to raise the issue. “This issue cannot be raised here,” he said. Akoijam has been raising issues related to the state which is affected by ethnic strife for around two years. His office, however, refused to answer what the issue was about.","The body of a youth killed in manipur’s kuki-dominated kangpokpi on march 8 finally handed over to his family.

NEW DELHI: A political row has erupted in Maharashtra over the government's new meat certification initiative. The controversy began when Maharashtra minister Nitesh Rane launched 'Malhar Certification' for Hindu meat traders to ensure “100% Hindu-owned mutton shops, free from adulteration.”Rane stated that Hindu shopkeepers selling 'jhatka' mutton would be granted this certification and urged Hindu consumers to purchase mutton exclusively from certified vendors.Soon after Rane's announcement, the opposition criticised the move, alleging it would divide society.Also read: 'Eating halal not written in Hindu religion': Maharashtra minister Nitesh Rane proposes 'Malhar certification' Congress MLA Nana Patole condemned Rane’s remarks, stating that a minister should not make such divisive statements. “A minister cannot talk like this. It sends a message that the Chief Minister has no control over his ministers. If any minister is inciting conflict between two religions, the CM should take action,” Patole told ANI.Congress leader Aslam Shaikh termed the move unconstitutional. “If this government or Nitesh Rane wants to enter the meat business, then it's good. Our Constitution gives us the freedom to do anything, eat anything, but saying that only one person will do a type of job does not align with our Constitution,” he said.Nationalist Congress Party (Sharad Chandra Pawar faction) MLA Jitendra Awhad also criticised the comments, particularly during the holy month of Ramzan. “When everything is running smoothly in the state, the BJP government tries to stoke Hindu-Muslim issues,” he said. He also questioned the political motive behind the debate on illegal loudspeakers, stating, “Action should be taken where necessary, but why make it a political issue?”Despite the backlash, BJP MLA Sanjay Upadhyay defended Rane’s certification initiative, arguing that ‘Halal’ meat poses health risks. “I have no issue with what people choose to eat, but if someone is being misled, it should be objected to. The chemicals produced during the ‘halal’ process are harmful to the body. I support Nitesh Rane in this case — chicken and mutton shops should have proper licensing,” Upadhyay said.Meanwhile, Rane, justifying his initiative, claimed that the certification would help Hindus identify “rightful mutton shops” run by members of the Hindu community and ensure no adulteration. Announcing the launch on social media platform X, he wrote, “Today, we have taken a very important step for the Hindu community in Maharashtra. Malhar Certification has been launched to ensure access to 100% Hindu-owned mutton shops , free from adulteration.”He further urged people to prioritise certified vendors and avoid purchasing from uncertified shops. “I appeal to everyone to use Malhar Certification and not buy mutton from places without it. This initiative will empower Hindu youth financially,” Rane added.According to the government website, Malhar certification is for jhatka mutton and chicken vendors. “It ensures that goat and sheep meat, sacrificed according to Hindu religious traditions, is fresh, clean, free from saliva contamination, and not mixed with any other animal meat,” the website stated.“This meat is available exclusively through Hindu Khatik community vendors. Therefore, we encourage everyone to purchase mutton only from vendors certified by Malhar,” it said.","Maha minister nitesh rane launched 'malhar certification' for hindu meat traders to ensure ‘100% hindu-owned mutton shops, free from adulteration’ opposition criticised the move, alleging it would divide society.

NEW DELHI: Tamil Nadu chief minister M K Stalin on Wednesday criticized the National Education Policy (NEP), calling it a "" saffron policy "" and alleging that it is aimed at promoting Hindi rather than the country's overall development.""National Education Policy is not education policy; it is saffron policy. The policy is not created to develop India but to develop Hindi. We are opposing the policy as it would destroy the Tamil Nadu education system completely,"" Stalin said while addressing a rally at Thiruvallur.He also claimed that NEP does not recognize reservation, which he described as social justice . ""NEP denies assistance amount to SCs, STs, and Other Backward Classes,"" he alleged during the public meeting.Stalin further accused the central government of withholding Tamil Nadu’s share of funds because the state did not adopt NEP. ""We are asking for your tax share, which we paid with our efforts. What is the problem with this? Is it fair to threaten without releasing funds for the welfare of 43 lakh schools? As we didn't accept NEP, they are refusing to release funds that belong to Tamil Nadu. We would have welcomed the scheme if it brought everyone into education. But is NEP like that? NEP has all the factors that remove people from education. This is how this policy is, and that's why we are opposing it,"" he said.The point of contention in the debate over NEP is its three-language formula , which Tamil Nadu fears could lead to the imposition of Hindi in the state. Stalin earlier argued that the policy gives preference to Hindi over regional languages, affecting the state's autonomy and linguistic diversity.The central government, however, insists that the NEP is designed to encourage multilingualism and provide flexibility in language education. Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan has refuted claims of Hindi imposition , stating that the policy allows states to decide on their preferred languages.On the issue of delimitation, Stalin alleged that the BJP is trying to increase the number of MPs in states where it has influence to strengthen its position. ""BJP is attempting to sustain power by winning in northern states,"" he said.He further added, ""BJP is trying to increase the number of MPs in states of their influence and develop the party. DMK will stop it.""Stalin also alleged that the BJP wants to destroy the federal structure, adding that ""they will never be submissive to the BJP's fascism even if we lose our lives.""""Let's gather whole India against BJP fascism . BJP's casteist thoughts neglect social justice to our people and destroy communal harmony. If we fail to stop this now, then it can't be stopped ever.

Two years later, in 1528, the Ram temple in Ayodhya was destroyed.""The chief minister added that both temple demolitions ""were carried out by the same person.""Since last November, tensions have been rising in Sambhal following a court-ordered survey at a mosque believed by some to be the site of a demolished temple.During his address, Adityanath emphasized that he respects all communities and sects. ""I am a Yogi. I respect every sect, community, and form of worship. If you visit Gorakhnath Peeth, you will see that there is no discrimination against anyone.

""There were 19 ancient wells, which we have revived. After 56 years, for the first time, there was the ritual offering of water at Lord Shiva's temple in Sambhal,"" he added.He criticized opposition parties, questioning their role in preserving cultural and religious heritage.

If anyone feels uncomfortable with the colours of Holi, they should stay indoors on that day.""On November 19, 2024, the Sambhal civil judge senior division ordered an urgent survey of a mosque after considering an application from some Hindu activists. The activists claimed that the Islamic religious site, built during the reign of Mughal emperor Babur, was originally a Hindu temple dedicated to Lord Vishnu's prophesied avatar, Kalki.Following the court’s directive, a survey team led by advocate commissioner Ramesh Raghav conducted an initial inspection of the mosque within a few hours.

NEW DELHI: Maharashtra minister Nitesh Rane has endorsed Malhar certification as an alternative to halal mutton for Hindus, saying that halal food is rooted in Islamic practices, not Hinduism.""The workers following Hindutva ideology have come together and brought a good alternative to Mutton for the Hindu society for their rights. It has been forced for years that only Halal mutton should be eaten. Either eat Halal, or you have no other alternative. We have brought a good alternative for it. Eating Halal is not written in Hindu religion, it is written in Islam religion. Therefore, if someone is bringing a good alternative like this, then I am supporting them,"" Rane said on Tuesday.His remarks triggered sharp reactions from the opposition.Congress MLA Nana Patole opposed the statement, arguing that a minister should not make divisive comments. ""A minister cannot talk like this. It gives a message that the chief minister has no control over his ministers. If any minister is inciting a fight between two religions, then the CM should take action,"" Patole told ANI.However, BJP MLA Sanjay Upadhyay backed Rane, claiming that Halal practices produce harmful chemicals. ""I don't have any issues regarding who is eating what but if someone is being fed something in a wrong way, then it should be objected...the chemicals that are produced during 'Halal' are harmful for our body...I support Nitesh Rane in this case...chicken and mutton shop should have licence,"" he said.On Monday, Rane launched the Malhar certification for Hindu meat traders, describing it as a means to ensure access to ""rightful mutton shops"" that are ""100 per cent Hindu-owned"" and free from adulteration.Announcing the initiative on social media, Rane wrote, ""Today, we have taken a crucial step for the Hindu community in Maharashtra. Malhar Certification will help identify mutton shops run exclusively by Hindus, ensuring purity and authenticity.""He urged people to buy only from certified outlets, emphasizing that the initiative would economically empower Hindu youth. ""I appeal to everyone to use Malhar certification and avoid shops without it.

Centuries of discrimination

Dalit families enter temple but fear backlash

'God is with everyone'

NEW DELHI: For the first time in nearly 300 years, Dalit families in a West Bengal village have been allowed to worship at the Gidheshwar Shiv Temple , breaking a long-standing caste barrier.On Wednesday, representatives of 130 Dalit families stepped into the temple in Purba Bardhaman district’s Katwa subdivision, marking a historic moment in their fight for religious rights.The breakthrough came after weeks of tension and intervention by local authorities. Around 10 am, five members from the Das community—including four women and one man—climbed the temple steps in Gidhgram’s Daspara area. Under police protection, they poured milk and water on the Shivling and offered prayers without any obstruction.For centuries, Dalit families, traditionally cobblers and weavers, were not allowed to enter the temple. When they tried to break this practice on Maha Shivratri (February 26), they faced strong opposition. They were forced to leave and faced economic boycotts, including a ban on selling milk from their cattle.The families were determined to worship and turned to the administration for help. But early talks with village elders and temple authorities failed. After several discussions, a key meeting on Tuesday, led by Sub-Divisional Officer (SDO) Ahimsa Jain, finally resolved the issue. Local MLAs, police officials, and temple committee members attended, ensuring that Dalit families could worship freely.The families expressed joy and relief but remained cautious about the future. “We are ecstatic to have been granted the right to perform puja at the temple. I prayed to God for everyone’s well-being,” said Santosh Das, a villager previously barred from entering the temple.“We received tremendous support from the local police and administration on whom we had reposed our faith,” added Ekkori Das. However, she voiced concerns over whether the temple doors would remain open once the police deployment was withdrawn. The economic boycott against the Das families also continued until Wednesday morning, with milk procurement centres refusing to collect milk from them. “Police have directed the centres to resume collection. If it doesn’t happen by evening, we will have to report it to the authorities,” she said.While the administration hailed the resolution as a step towards equality, some temple authorities admitted they were not entirely in favour. “We used to take care of everything at the temple during the Gajan fair. It is now a big question whether we will be able to maintain the purity and sanctity of the ancient tradition of puja at the temple,” said Sanat Mandal, a temple servant.Local political leaders welcomed the development. “It wasn’t easy to break the deadlock arising out of a long-standing tradition. Standing in the 21st century, such ideas cannot be entertained. God is with everyone. Together, we managed to convince everyone of this. That is what has resolved the dispute,” said Trinamool Congress MLA Apurba Chatterjee.","For centuries, dalit families, traditionally cobblers and weavers, were not allowed to enter the temple.

'I do not want to name him ...': Nirmala Sithraman weighs into language row



NEW DELHI: DMK MP Kanimozhi on Wednesday accused Union education minister Dharmendra Pradhan of ""twisting facts"" after Tamil Nadu government 's letter of consent was for establishment of PM-SHRI schools was furnished amid the ongoing three-language controversy.Replying to Pradhan on a social media post on X, the DMK MP said that the letter provided by the education minister does not mention accepting the three-language policy or NEP in its entirety""This letter clearly states that Tamil Nadu will accept PM SHRI schools only based on our State Government led-committee’s recommendations and not on your Union Government’s recommendation. Nowhere have we mentioned accepting the three-language policy or NEP in its entirety,"" Kanimozhi said.""Whatever is acceptable for Tamil Nadu, we will accept—nothing more, nothing less. Stop twisting facts,"" she added.This came a day after Pradhan slammed DMK govt on social media and claimed that three-language controversy had been staged by TN govt to earn “brownie points and to revive DMK’s political fortunes”.The letter dated March 15, 2024 said, “… the state of Tamil Nadu is very keen to sign the MoU for establishing PM-SHRI schools in the state. In this regard, a state-level committee headed by the school education secretary has been constituted. Based on the recommendations of the committee, the MoU for establishing PM-SHRI schools will be signed by the state before the beginning of the next academic year, 2024-25.”“It is requested to kindly release the 3rd and the 4th instalments for the financial year 2023-24,” it added.Earlier, TN CM Stalin had accused Pradhan of misleading Parliament regarding the state’s consent for establishment of PM-SHRI schools.Stalin also shared on social media a letter dated Aug 30, 2025, from Pradhan, highlighting a paragraph where the Union minister wrote: “… after receiving the undertaking, a draft MoU was sent … I was surprised to see that the state responded with a modified MoU... wherein the key paragraph referring to the implementation of NE in entirety had been dropped.”Rajya Sabha MP Sudha Murthy backed the government over the ongoing row and said that one must learn multiple languages.""I have always believed that one can learn multiple languages and I myself know 7-8 languages,"" Murthy said.Meanwhile, Union minister Nirmala Sitharaman stroked controversy after she weighed into the language controversy and said, “I do not want to name him, but the moment I read the passages, anyone with a small, faint familiarity with Tamil will know who I'm speaking about. So, when this person speaks about Tamil, much horribly, there’s no objection. On the contrary, they would keep his photo. They will also say he is our Dravidian icon.”She said while quoting the “elderly person” from various Tamil magazines in what was seen as a reference to Periyar, the leader of the Dravidian movement.Sitharaman said Pradhan was made to withdraw his remarks just for saying that the protest by DMK members was uncivil.“But a man who repeatedly says Tamil is a barbaric language, they keep his photograph in every room, they garland him and worship him and say he is the icon of Dravidian movement. Look at their hypocrisy,” she said.","'whatever is acceptable for tamil nadu, we will accept—nothing more, nothing less,' says kanimozhi.

Authorities call for inquiry into security lapses

Defence claims consent, police cite forensic proof

NEW DELHI: A Maharashtra court on Wednesday remanded Dattatray Gade , the accused in the Swargate bus rape case , to police custody until March 26. The incident took place in Pune where Gade had allegedly raped a 26-year-old woman inside a parked state transport (MSRTC) bus at the Swargate terminus in the early hours of February 25, police said.Gade was arrested from a sugarcane field in Gunat village, Pune district, following an extensive manhunt involving drones and sniffer dogs. The search operation lasted two days, with villagers assisting the police. According to officials, Gade made multiple suicide attempts while hiding but failed each time due to a broken rope. He was ultimately captured after leaving his hiding spot in search of drinking water.Upon his arrest, Gade was produced in court following a 12-day police custody. The crime branch sought his judicial custody while reserving the right to recall him for two additional days of police custody.

He convinced her to board a parked Shivshahi bus , locked the doors, and allegedly raped her before fleeing. Initially too shaken to speak out, the victim later gathered the courage to report the crime with support from a friend.The case has sparked public outrage, with protests erupting at the Swargate terminus. Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar and NCW Chairperson Vijaya Rahatkar condemned the incident, calling for swift justice. Transport minister Pratap Sarnaik ordered an inquiry into security lapses, leading to the dismissal of 23 security personnel and investigations into two senior officials. Authorities have since ramped up security measures at major bus terminals across the state, installing additional CCTV cameras and increasing police patrols.During the court hearing, Gade’s defence lawyers argued that the encounter was consensual. However, the police refuted these claims, citing forensic evidence and CCTV footage. Authorities have sent the bus for forensic examination and are ensuring all evidence is properly documented.",Dattatray gade remanded to police custody until march 26.

PATNA: For the second time in a week, chief minister Nitish Kumar and his predecessor Rabri Devi engaged in a heated exchange in the Bihar Legislative Council on Wednesday.While Nitish said Rabri was the “CM of circumstances”, the former CM accused the JD(U) leader of “insulting the women folks”.Trouble began when CPI-ML member, Shashi Yadav, rose from her seat to submit before the House that she was not satisfied with the govt’s reply to her question. The CM reacted by saying the govt is doing so much for women while the previous govt did nothing. This irked Rabri, who rose to intervene, asking the govt to bring the records of that period to know what was done by the previous govt.Reacting sharply to her observations, Nitish accused RJD chief Lalu Prasad of installing his wife as the CM when he was forced to step down. Rabri hit back, accusing the CM of “disrespecting” all women folk through his words, alleging no substantial work was done under his leadership before staging a walkout with opposition members in protest.Rabri first became the CM in 1997 when her husband Lalu Prasad resigned as CM, after the CBI submitted a chargesheet against him in the multi-crore fodder scam. She ruled the state for eight years.Nitish in his speech had informed the House how his govt had done a lot for every class, including women, who were granted 50% reservation in panchayati raj institutions and how it launched several initiatives to empower the women. He reiterated that he won’t go back to the opposition alliance any more asserting “Ab sab din ke liye saath rahange...idhar-udhar nahin jayenge (I won’t waver, will remain with the NDA always).”","Trouble began when cpi-ml member, shashi yadav, rose from her seat to submit before the house.

NEW DELHI: The post-mortem reports of three youths from J&K’s Kathua, who were found dead three days after they went missing, have not revealed any gunshot wound or physical assault, ruling out a “terrorist attack” angle.The trauma injuries , including to their heads, point to their death by “accidental fall from a height,” said sources.Sharing this, sources in the J&K govt also told TOI that two more minors, who went missing from the same district — they were reported by their family as missing only a couple of days ago though they have been gone since Feb 28 — had an argument with their family and possibly left home to work elsewhere on daily wages.This, the sources said, has happened before with the cousins, aged 12 and 15 and both herders, staying away from their family home for days to do daily-wage jobs. The police are making enquiries with their relatives and past employers to trace them.As per the post-mortem reports of the three Kathua residents — identified as Darshan Singh, 40, Yogesh Singh, 32, and Varun Singh, 15 — whose bodies were discovered on March 8 in a gorge next to a waterfall, the cause of their death was trauma and head injury, purportedly caused by their accidentally slipping in the dark, down a rocky gorge. A backpack carried by one of them got stuck on a branch as they fell. A mobile used by them was also recovered from the spot. A liquor bottle with half of its contents consumed was found, pointing to possible inebriated state of the two adults.“Their viscera reports are now awaited for further insight into the cause and circumstances of the deaths,” said a source.Interviews with the family members of the three deceased persons, who were on their way to a wedding in Lohai Malhar, revealed that they were in touch with them over phone till the evening of March 5 and had even communicated that they had lost their way while moving with wedding party. However, a couple of hours later their phones were found to be switched off.","Post-mortem reports of three youths from j&k’s kathua, who were found dead three days after they went missing, have not revealed any gunshot wound or physical assault.

Delimitation will penalise progressive states: DMK

BENGALURU: Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah backed his Tamil Nadu counterpart MK Stalin’s campaign against the proposed population-based delimitation exercise with a call to action on Wednesday, contrasting with his deputy DK Shivakumar calling for a nuanced approach based on the party high command’s “final call”.A Tamil Nadu delegation met Siddaramaiah in Bengaluru and Stalin reached out to him over phone, proposing a joint action committee consisting of representatives of several states to collectively oppose the delimitation move.A statement from the CMO confirmed Karnataka’s alignment with the protest against what the southern states call “an undemocratic stance” to carry out delimitation without everyone on board.Stalin requested Karnataka to nominate a senior Congress representative to coordinate a unified strategy. A preliminary meeting is scheduled for March 22 in Chennai.The delegation led by TN forest minister K Ponmudy and Rajya Sabha member Mohammad Abdullah Ismail discussed with Siddaramaiah the need to challenge the alleged bias against southern states, the CMO said. Siddaramaiah said Congress “unequivocally condemns all actions of the Union govt that are against Karnataka’s interest, weaken democracy and go against the federal principles of the Constitution”.The proposed joint action committee could have members from Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, West Bengal, Odisha and Punjab. DMK has been reaching out to functionaries across party lines, including NDA allies like Andhra Pradesh CM N Chandrababu Naidu.Shivakumar said DMK being Congress’s ally, the party appreciated its stance. “However, as a national party, we must consult our high command and proceed based on their guidance.”DMK member D M Kathir Anand in Lok Sabha on Wednesday said the impending delimitation exercise penalises progressive states like Tamil Nadu which have controlled population growth and asked the govt to ensure equitable representation of all states in Parliament and state assemblies.Flagging the issue during Zero Hour, he said, “ Govt should consider economic performance and vital indices like GSDP, per capita income, infrastructure improvement and not just population while doing the delimitation exercise”.The delimitation issue was also raised by BJP member Nishikant Dubey who flagged instances of Bangladeshi infiltrators entering India through the borders of West Bengal, and said Centre should exclude them when conducting delimitation.",Dmk has been reaching out to functionaries across party lines.
