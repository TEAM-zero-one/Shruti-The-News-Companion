"Toll on under expansion 2-lane highways to be halved, partially opened e-ways to be on par with NHs",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/toll-on-under-expansion-2-lane-highways-to-be-halved-partially-opened-e-ways-to-be-on-par-with-nhs/articleshow/126297492.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a relief for highway commuters, toll on under expansion stretches — from two-lane to four-lane — will soon be halved during the construction period and the user fee on partially opened expressways such as Delhi-Mumbai and Amritsar-Jamnagar will be same as that of other NHs. At present, the toll on expressways is 1.25 times of other NH stretches.TOI has learnt that the finance ministry has given the green light to the two proposals from the road transport and highways ministry. The latter had proposed to halve toll during expansion of 10-metre-wide two-lane highways with paved shoulders to four-lane highways since commuters don’t get the desired service as the width of road gets reduced available while construction is underway.Currently, during expansion of a two-lane highway to four lanes, the toll charged is around 60% of the normal NH toll. With the concurrence of the finance ministry to the proposal, soon user fee will drop to 30% of normal toll during the construction phase. The finance ministry has asked the highways ministry to monitor and ensure strict enforcement of penalties on contractors for missing timeline in such widening projects.Officials said that while giving the go ahead for bringing toll rates on partially opened expressways on par with other NHs, the finance ministry said such relief should be for one year or till the expressway is fully operational, whichever is earlier. The highways ministry had submitted that vehicles, particularly heavy commercial vehicles, were not using expressways for higher toll rates.The finance ministry has said a decision on continuing this relaxation beyond one year may be taken based on actual uptake of traffic on such expressways. It has also asked the highways ministry to impose penalties on contractors for delay in completion of works.",The user fee on partially opened expressways such as delhi-mumbai and amritsar-jamnagar will be same as that of other nhs.

A tiger appeared without warning, gliding like a shadow along the forest edge as a boat drifted through the Periyar waters. For a 13-year-old boy visiting Kerala in 1957, the moment was electrifying. Wildlife then was not something confined to sanctuaries; it was visible, immediate, woven into everyday landscapes. That fleeting encounter stayed with Romulus Whitaker long before he became one of India's most influential conservationists, shaping a life devoted to understanding-and defending-creatures most people feared.Whitaker's first journey to Kerala was part of a family trip. His sister was graduating from high school, and the itinerary included Kochi, where they stayed at the Malabar Hotel, then considered the city's finest. Boat rides through rivers like the Periyar were already popular, and wildlife sightings were common. ""Gaurs and deer were easily spotted, and tigers still roamed freely at a time when hunting was legal. I never saw a king cobra on that trip, but the habit of looking closely had already taken root,"" Whitaker recalls.That fascination had formed much earlier, far from India. Growing up in northern New York State, Whitaker once watched neighbourhood boys kill a snake out of fear.""I knew more about snakes than the other kids, and that made a difference,"" he says. His mother encouraged his curiosity, buying him a book on snakes that helped replace fear with knowledge. When he later brought a live snake home, she admired it rather than panicking, calling it beautiful. An old aquarium with cracked glass became a makeshift enclosure. Without realizing it, Whitaker had taken his first step into a lifelong engagement with reptiles-a fascination that deepened after his family moved to India in the 1950s.Janaki Lenin, Whitaker's partner and co-author of his autobiography ""Snakes, Drugs and Rock 'n' Roll: My Early Years"", says writing the book gave her a deeper understanding of the extraordinary life he has lived. His schooling, she notes, was anything but conventional-camping in forests, fishing in lakes, and once even discovering a python under his bed. Boredom was never an option. If a classroom failed to hold his attention, he simply walked away to explore something more compelling outdoors. Comparing his life to her own, Lenin describes Whitaker as someone who has ""lived six or seven lifetimes in one.""Formal education never quite suited him. After finishing school, Whitaker enrolled in college but soon realized classrooms could not compete with hands-on learning. His real education began at the Miami Serpentarium under Bill Haast, the legendary snake handler who pioneered venom extraction in the United States. Working alongside Haast, Whitaker learned to handle venomous snakes, maintain them in captivity, and extract venom for medical use. ""Bill Haast was my guru,"" he says. ""He taught me respect for snakes, not just technique.""When Whitaker returned to India, he had a clear idea: The country needed a place where people could learn about snakes scientifically rather than fear them blindly. That idea took shape in 1969 with the opening of the Madras Snake Park. Visitors arrived sceptical-some expecting spectacle, others danger. Whitaker himself was often viewed as an eccentric outsider. But the park was never meant to entertain. It was an educational experiment. For the first time, ordinary people could see snakes up close, learn to identify species, and understand that most snakes were not out to harm them.Over the decades, the impact has been profound. India today has thousands of snake rescuers, a reality Whitaker views with cautious optimism. While rescue work has reduced routine killings, it has also become performative in some cases. Kerala, he notes, stands out for institutionalizing rescue work. By registering rescuers, issuing identity cards, and maintaining an online database, the state has created a system rooted in accountability and data. The model has since been adopted by Karnataka and is being replicated in Tamil Nadu Snakebite, however, remains one of India's most under-recognized public health crises. For decades, official statistics claimed around 1,400 deaths annually. A nationwide ""Million Deaths Study"" based on verbal autopsies revealed a far grimmer reality: Over 50,000 deaths every year, with nearly one million snakebite incidents. Many victims never reach hospitals, either dying en route or seeking traditional remedies instead of medical treatment.""The key word is prevention,"" Whitaker says. Simple measures-using a torch at night, wearing footwear, being cautious near pump houses-could prevent a significant proportion of bites. Improved reporting, he adds, has made it seem as though cases are increasing, when in fact awareness and documentation have improved. Treating snakebite as a medical emergency rather than a cultural or mystical phenomenon remains the biggest challenge.Few initiatives illustrate Whitaker's belief in practical, science-based solutions better than his long association with the Irula tribal community of Tamil Nadu. For generations, the Irulas survived by catching snakes for their skins. When the skin trade was banned, their livelihood vanished overnight. Working with the community, Whitaker helped develop a new model: Irula snake catchers would capture snakes, extract venom under controlled conditions, and release them back into the wild. The venom would then be supplied to pharmaceutical companies to manufacture antivenom.""They are saving lakhs of human lives,"" Whitaker says. Today, around 350 Irula families supply venom that meets India's entire antivenom requirement. For him, it remains the country's only true example of sustainable wildlife use-one that benefits both people and animals without depleting wild populations.Human-animal conflict remains one of conservation's most complex challenges. India's tiger, leopard, and crocodile populations have all increased-a remarkable achievement by global standards. But many of these animals now live outside protected forests. Leopards, in particular, thrive in agricultural landscapes, raising cubs in sugarcane fields and feeding on small animals and stray dogs. ""Leopards don't need forests the way we think they do,"" Whitaker explains. ""They've adapted to living alongside people.""Problems arise when human panic leads to capture and relocation-an intervention that often worsens conflict. Whitaker's own experience reinforced this lesson. Living on a small farm near Chennai, he once lost a dog to a leopard. His first instinct was to call the forest department. Then came the realisation: ""We moved into his territory. He didn't move into ours."" Simple precautions, like keeping dogs indoors at night, resolved the issue without endangering the cat.Lenin agrees that human-wildlife conflict is not new, but says its nature has changed. Earlier, communities managed interactions locally. ""The law took away that freedom, but the state did not fulfil its responsibility of sorting out the issue,"" she says. Many conflicts today, she argues, are effectively state-created-especially in the case of elephants, which require vast landscapes and abundant food. Habitat disruption leaves marginalized communities bearing the burden of coexistence, even though they are the least equipped to do so.Whitaker is critical of how crop-raiding wildlife is managed, particularly in Kerala, one of the few states where wild boars that devastate farmlands are legally permitted to be killed but must then be buried. Recalling ecologist Madhav Gadgil's public criticism of the policy, Whitaker questions the logic of wasting what is a valuable protein source. ""These animals can destroy paddy or peanut fields as much as an elephant does, but after killing them, you are told to bury the meat. People are always in need of protein, especially in rural areas. He recounts seeing electric fences in parts of north India where nilgai, jackals, and peacocks were killed indiscriminately and left to rot. For him, science-based preventive infrastructure works far better than reactionary measures.He regards Indira Gandhi as India's most conservation-minded Prime Minister, instrumental in legislations such as the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972. ""She had come to the Snake Park in Madras in 1972, and then we told her about the problems that were happening. When Rajiv became the prime minister, we spoke to him about the Andamans and the deforestation there, and they stopped it. These were the times when you could actually speak to a prime minister and the next day you might see some action; I would love to see that happening today. ""When Whitaker received the Padma Shri, he briefly met Prime Minister Narendra Modi but did not get the chance to speak at length. He later sent a draft message to the PM's office, hoping for a mention of snakebite prevention during Mann Ki Baat. ""If the PM spoke for even one minute about snakebite as a medical emergency, and about the importance of govt hospitals being equipped to handle it, thousands of lives could be saved,"" he says.When he first documented India's snakes, around 275 species were known. Today, more than 360 have been recorded. For young people entering herpetology, he sees unprecedented opportunities through universities and research institutions.""Go there, volunteer, and learn,"" he advises. ""Observe, respect, and don't try to be a hero. Conservation is about patience and understanding, not spectacle.""Now in his eighties, Whitaker continues to focus on snakebite mitigation through films and awareness campaigns. From a child defending a snake to a man who has spent a lifetime persuading a nation to rethink its fears, his story is ultimately about understanding nature and choosing scientific knowledge over fear.(Romulus Whitaker was in Kochi with his partner, writer Janaki Lenin, for a climate literature festival at the Kerala University of Fisheries and Ocean Studies)",Romulus whitaker is one of india's most influential conservationists. He has dedicated his life to understanding-and defending-creatures most people feared. Whitaker's fascination with reptiles deepened after his family moved to india in the 1950s. His real education began at the miami serpentarium.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126296991,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-583500,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

180 Kmph While You Sleep! India's Latest Vande Bharat Sleeper Marks New Era. Check Fares, Features

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi will flag off the country's first Vande Bharat Sleeper train between Guwahati and Howrah later this month, barely months before the assembly polls in Assam and West Bengal. The train, marking a major upgrade in overnight train travel running at 120-130 kmph, will also reduce the travel time between two eastern capitals by more than three hours.Railway minister Ashwini Vaishnaw announced the first route of the indigenously built modern train that has a design speed of 180 kmph. PM is likely to visit Assam and West Bengal in the third week of this month. Responding to a question on the reason for choosing the route connecting two poll-bound states, Vaishnaw said the decision is part of PM's thrust on development in east and northeast India under the ""purvodaya"" scheme.The minister said that in the next six months eight more such trains catering to 1,200-1,500 km routes will be rolled out and by December this number will reach 12. ""From next year onwards, production will be ramped up rapidly as the entire supply chain will be in place by then,"" he added.Giving details of the first service, he said it will run six days a week and the one-way fare will be Rs 2,300 for 3AC, Rs 3,000 for 2AC and Rs 3,600 for 1AC travel.He added for the first time, the national transporter has decided to have a fixed rate of fare for each class of travel in these trains - Rs 2.4, Rs 3.1 and Rs 3.8 per km for third, second and first AC, meaning there will be no dynamic pricing. ""You will see several reforms in railways in 2026. This is one of them,"" Vaishnaw said. While passengers originating from Guwahati will be served Asamese cuisine, those starting from Kolkata will get Bengali food.On the special features of the train, Vaishnaw said the riding comfort can be compared with best trains across the globe and the AC system ensures there is adequate oxygen content in air to ensure passengers face no discomfort.Vaishnaw also gave details of progress made in fencing of tracks, upgradation of around 79% network and upgradation in the Over Head Equipment (OHE), the system of overhead cables, masts, and insulators that supplies high-voltage electricity to power electric trains, enabling trains to run at a higher speed. He added that with the expansion of railway infrastructure, they are hopeful of running more trains and they are hopeful of ending waitlisted tickets in some sectors in the next 2-3 years.","Pm narendra modi will flag off the country's first vande bharat sleeper train between guwahati and howrah later this month.

Gold stripped from Sabarimala through organised op: SIT,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/gold-stripped-from-sabarimala-through-organised-op-sit/articleshow/126296336.cms,"Sabarimala temple

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM/THRISSUR: Gold embedded in sacred structures of Sabarimala temple in central Kerala was allegedly stripped, diverted and converted through a planned operation involving temple officials, intermediaries and private jewellers, a state-appointed SIT told a vigilance court.In a report seeking police custody of key accused, SIT said gold-plated copper sheets forming part of the sanctum sanctorum were removed in 2019 under the pretext of repairs, chemically stripped of gold at a private Chennai workshop and returned with fresh plating to conceal the loss.According to investigators, ornamental panels depicting 10 incarnations of Lord Vishnu, zodiac symbols, the sanctum door lintel and the prabhamandalam (an arch behind the idol) were falsely described as ordinary copper sheets to secure their removal, causing unlawful loss to Travancore Devaswom Board, which manages the temple.SIT alleged criminal breach of trust, saying extracted gold was neither reported to devaswom authorities nor returned to temple treasury but treated as personal property. Arrests have been made and accused remanded in judicial custody, with SIT telling court interrogation in custody was essential to trace remaining gold and establish full chain of responsibility.SIT named former TDB president A Padmakumar, devaswom commissioner N Vasu, Sabarimala executive officer Sudheesh Kumar, administrative officer Murari Babu and others, along with Chennai-based Smart Creations CEO Pankaj Bhandari and Ballari-based jeweller Roddam Pandu Rangaiah Naga Govardhan.

Accused not criminals but youth high on emotions: Court

AHMEDABAD: A sessions court refused to permit Gujarat govt to withdraw a criminal case against 19 Karni Sena activists, who were booked for vandalising a mall, torching vehicles and damaging property during their protest against the release of the film 'Padmavat' in 2018.The court said the alleged offence was committed ""to achieve personal interest and to maintain dominance of a particular community, ignoring the public interest"". It noted that the accused caused damage to the tune of Rs 16.4 lakh during the rioting. tnnKarni Sena's candle march on Jan 23, 2018, in protest against the movie event took a violent turn, with 19 participants being booked for rioting, unlawful assembly, arson, and criminal conspiracy under provisions of IPC, section 3(1) of Damages to Public Property Act and section 135(1) of Gujarat Police Act. After investigation, police filed a chargesheet and the case has been pending in a sessions court since 2019.The state govt first requested a JMFC court to allow it to withdraw the case under CrPC section 321, but the request was refused in 2022. It then approached the Ahmedabad (rural) sessions court and submitted that the decision to withdraw prosecution was based only on the interest of the public at large, and would be helpful in the administration of justice.The accused are not criminals but younsters who acted in the heat of passion and were high on emotions, it argued.However, additional sessions judge Hardik Shah said court can't permit withdrawal of prosecution merely because state govt issued an order to the public prosecutor.

How will the ESI coverage be governed until the finalisation of Rules?

New Labour Codes: The Ministry of Labour has pre-published draft rules under new labour codes on Wednesday. These draft rules are open for public consultation, and stakeholders have been invited to submit objections and suggestions within 45 days (30 days for Industrial Relations Rules). The government has clarified that during the transition period, existing rules will continue to apply until new rules are notified under the Labour Codes, as long as they are consistent with the Codes.Why are the new labour codes important? There are changes in the way provident fund contributions, wages, gratuity are calculated, along with a host of other measures. A uniform definition of “wages” now applies across all four Labour Codes and includes basic pay, dearness allowance and retaining allowance, with a 50 percent cap on allowances. Any allowance, excluding gratuity and retrenchment compensation, that exceeds 50 percent of total remuneration will be added back to wages for statutory calculations, while items such as performance incentives.Puneet Gupta, Partner, People Advisory Services-Tax, EY India says that the draft central rules under the four labour codes provide clarity on several operational aspects that employers have been awaiting.“For instance, the Code on Social Security Rules specify that gratuity will be calculated on ‘wages’ last drawn, excluding components such as annual performance-linked pay, medical reimbursements, stock options, and meal vouchers. This clarification will help organizations estimate their gratuity liability more effectively,” he says.“Similarly, the Occupational Safety, Health and Working Conditions Rules introduce important provisions on overtime and working conditions. Workers will now be entitled to double wages for any work beyond 48 hours in a week, and employers must ensure substituted rest days without exceeding ten consecutive working days. These measures aim to balance productivity with employee well-being,” he adds.According to Puneet Gupta, other notable provisions include annual medical check-ups for employees above 40 years in specific sectors such as factory, dock, mine, building & other construction work, creche allowances of at least Rs 500 per child where creche facilities are not provided, and journey allowances for inter-state migrant workers.Apart from the draft rules, the government has also published a list of FAQs on what the new labour codes mean, definition of wages, gratuity calculation etc.As per the provisions of Section 6 of General Clauses Act, 1897, old rules will remain in force till final notification of new rules under the Code, to the extent these are in line with Codes.The definition of “Wages” covers:As mentioned in Section 2(y) of Code on Wages, 2019, leave encashment is not a part of allowances.Gratuity will be applicable w.e.f. 21st Nov, 2025 i.e. date of enforcement of the Code.Gratuity will be applicable w.e.f. 21st Nov, 2025 i.e. date of enforcement of the Code. Establishments may make provision as per accounting norms.Gratuity shall be payable on following events:Completion of five years of continuous service is not necessary in case of:If the nominee or heir is a minor, the share shall be deposited with a competent authority and invested in bank/financial institution for the benefit of such minor until majorityFor every completed year of service or part thereof in excess of six months: 15 days’ wages per year (or such number as notified by Central Government) based on the rate of wages last drawn.Special cases:The maximum gratuity is as notified by the Central Government which is currently ₹ 20 lakhs.For employees re-employed after disablement:Nothing shall affect the right of an employee to receive better gratuity terms under any:Any person, who is employed in a supervisory capacity drawing wages exceeding ₹18,000/- (or an amount as may be notified by the Central Government from time to time) is not included in the definition of worker.Core and non-core activities are clearly defined under the OSH & WC Code, 2020 [Section 57]. Principal employer may engage contract labour for core activities which are ordinarily carried out through contractor, or of intermittent nature or involve sudden increase in volume of work requiring time-bound completion.As per OSH & WC Code, 2020, the employer shall pay to and fro journey allowance to ISMW once in a year from his native place to place of employment.The definition of wage has come into force with notification of the Code w.e.f. 21st Nov, 2025.","Apart from the draft rules, the government has also published a list of faqs on what the new labour codes mean. These include definition of wages, gratuity calculation and 50% rule for allowances. The ministry of labour has pre-published draft rules under new labour codes.

The train will be equipped with advanced bio-vacuum toilets similar to those used in aircraft. Amenities will include toilets designed for persons with disabilities, a baby care area, and shower facilities with hot water in the air-conditioned first-class coach.

Safety enhancements include the indigenous KAVACH anti-collision system. Like the existing chair car variant, the sleeper version will also use regenerative braking to improve energy efficiency.

Coaches will have fully sealed gangways and automated inter-coach doors, helping maintain consistent air quality and stable cabin temperatures.

Each coach will be fitted with personal reading lights, power charging points, foldable snack tables, and interiors finished with GFRP panels. Train doors will operate automatically at designated stations.

A Centralised Coach Monitoring System is in place, along with emergency communication features that allow passengers to directly contact the locomotive pilot when required.

Vande Bharat sleeper train to be launched soon! In a big New year cheer for Indian Railways passengers, Railway Minister Ashwini Vaishaw has shared that the first Vande Bharat sleeper train will be launched this month. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to flag off the Vande Bharat sleeper train in the second half of January 2026.Vande Bharat sleeper is a fully air-conditioned train set that has been manufactured by Indian Railways for long-distance routes and overnight journeys. According to Ashwini Vaishnaw , two Vande Bharat sleeper train sets are ready and have undergone successful trial runs. The new trains will be operated on 1,200-1,500 kmph routes of the national transporter.The first Vande Bharat sleeper train will run between Guwahati and Kolkata, Ashwini Vaishnaw announced on Thursday. Each Vande Bharat sleeper train has 16 coaches. The composition of the coaches is: 11 AC 3-tier, 4 AC 2-tier, and one AC 1st coach. The train can accommodate 823 passengers. Vaishnaw said that eight more Vande Bharat sleeper trains will be rolled out in the next six months, and the total will go up to 12 by year-end.The new train is scheduled to run between Howrah and Guwahati (Kamakhya). According to Indian Railways, the following districts will be benefitted:Ashwini Vaishnaw recently shared a video on X, formerly known as Twitter, showcasing the train undergoing high-speed trials on the Indian Railways network.During test runs conducted on the Kota–Nagda route, the Vande Bharat sleeper train achieved its top design speed of 180 kmph. A notable highlight from the trial was a stability demonstration in which glasses filled with water remained perfectly balanced without any water spilling even at over 180 kmph speed.“Vande Bharat Sleeper tested today by Commissioner ailway Safety. It ran at 180 kmph between Kota Nagda section. And our own water test demonstrated the technological features of this new generation train,” Ashwini Vaishnaw wrote in his post on X.Designed for overnight and long-haul journeys, the Vande Bharat sleeper train is the sleeping-class counterpart of the Vande Bharat chair car services already operating across the country.At present, two prototype rakes of the Vande Bharat sleeper train have been produced by BEML. Indian Railways is also gearing up for a broader transformation of long-distance travel, with plans to roll out more than 200 such sleeper trains in the coming years, supported by several ongoing manufacturing initiatives.BEML is jointly producing 10 Vande Bharat sleeper train sets in partnership with the Integral Coach Factory. Another batch of 10 sleeper rakes is being built by Kinet, a joint venture involving Indian and Russian entities. In addition, a consortium led by Titagarh Rail Systems along with BHEL has secured an order to manufacture 80 sleeper-class trainsets. Separately, the Integral Coach Factory is also developing its own sleeper configuration of the Vande Bharat train as an internal project.",The first vande bharat sleeper train will run between guwahati and kolkata. The train will be equipped with advanced bio-vacuum toilets similar to those used in aircraft. Prime minister narendra modi is expected to flag off the train in the second half of january 2026. The vande bharat sleeper train is designed for overnight and long-haul journeys.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126284704,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-101952,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

NEW DELHI: “You are a nominated official, but I am an elected representative … "" The Trinamool Congress ’s offensive against Chief Election Commissioner Gyanesh Kumar has set the stage for an all-out confrontation over the ongoing Special Intensive Revision of electoral rolls ahead of upcoming assembly elections in West Bengal. Mamata Banerjee ’s nephew Abhishek Banerjee , who led a Trinamool delegation to the Election Commission on Wednesday, accused the CEC of “losing temper” and “raising fingers at party members. Abhishek dared the CEC to respond to his allegations.""They think that by raising their voice and speaking aggressively, everyone will be silenced. When we started speaking, he began losing his temper. He tried to stop some of us and pointed fingers at me. I then stated that you are a nominated official, but I am an elected representative. You are answerable to your masters, but I am answerable to the masses who elected me, for whom we have come here to ensure that no legitimate voter is deleted from the list. .. If he has the courage, let him release the footage. I am standing very close to the ECI office,"" Abhishek said standing at the gate of the Election Commission office.""Gyanesh Kumar must be hearing what I am saying to the media right now. If he has the courage, he should come down, face the media, and rebut every point I am making, rather than making selective leaks after 8 pm.What is stopping him? Does he think the people of Bengal are his subservient? Apart from two-three questions, he has failed. Does he think the people of Bengal, and we MPs, ministers, and MLAs elected by the people, are bonded labourers or slaves?"" the Trinamool MP asked, targeting the CEC.Abhishek Banerjee’s dig on selective leaks referred to the party’s last meeting with the poll body on November 28. The Trinamool leader claimed that they had asked the Election Commission five questions in that meeting, but didn't receive a single precise answer to any of them. The Trinamool leader had accused the Election Commission of selectively leaking information to some journalists, claiming that they had answered every question.In return, the Election Commission accused the Trinamool of intimidating its electoral staff in the state.The Election Commission (EC) officials said that the Trinamool Congress (TMC) delegation was told that intimidation of any electoral staff by ground-level political representatives and workers will not be tolerated and that the West Bengal government should immediately release the enhanced honorarium to each BLO.Draft rolls for West Bengal released by the ECI in December show that 58,20,899 names, about 7.59 per cent of the electorate, have been provisionally deleted due to reasons such as death, permanent migration or untraceability. The Trinamool has raised concerns over the scale of deletions, alleging possible disenfranchisement.Also, around 1.36 crore entries have also been flagged for ""logical discrepancies"", while 30 lakh voters were categorised as unmapped – a significant percentage of whom are likely to be called for verification hearings. The timeline for final publication of electoral rolls in the state is February 14, 2026.Abhishek Banerjee questioned the list of ""logical discrepancies"" made by the EC and accused the poll body of weaponsing the voter list to help the BJP. The TMC leader demanded that the list of voters under the ""logical discrepancy"" category be published and the methodology and legal authority used to create this category be disclosed.Chief minister Mamata Banerjee has already claimed that the Special Intensive Revision (SIR) exercise was a huge ""scam"" being conducted with the help of artificial intelligence, and has warned that her party will gherao the Election Commission's office in Delhi if the name of even a single legitimate voter is deleted from the electoral rolls.Trinamool Congress has said that it will not accept the final voter list if it has ""discrepancies” and if needed “it would fight it legally."" Clearly SIR, which is already in the centre of a political storm, is set for a rough ride in West Bengal with the Trinamool Congress piling unrelenting pressure on the Election Commission.","Abhishek banerjee led a trinamool delegation to the election commission on wednesday.

NEW DELHI: Getting into the Yuletide spirit could prove expensive for an Air India pilot who was to operate a Vancouver-Delhi (via Vienna) flight on Dec 23, 2025. A staffer at Vancouver duty free either saw him inadvertently sipping wine being offered at this festive time or found him smelling of liquor while he was buying a bottle. She reported this Boeing 777 pilot to the Canadian authorities who conducted a breath analyser test on him which he flunked and then he was detained.Luckily for passengers, Air India managed to quickly find a replacement. The ultra long haul, to be operated by four pilots or two sets (one captain and a co-pilot in each set) in turns, supposed to leave at 3 pm local time did so with just a two-hour delay. The aircraft then landed in Vienna from where another set of crew operated it to Delhi.“AI has taken a very stern view of this matter. The pilot was flown to Delhi a couple of days later and is being probed. The issue has been reported to the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), which is also examining the same,” said people in the know.While some sources say the pilot had inadvertently sipped an alcoholic drink at the airport and a staffer at duty free saw him doing so, others said he smelled of alcohol when buying a bottle.It is not yet known which of the two really happened, staffer reported the matter to Canadian authorities who then used CCTV footage to find out the pilot in question was to operate with flight. They managed to trace him to the AI aircraft.In a statement, AI said: “AI 186 from Vancouver to Delhi on Dec 23, 2025, experienced a last-minute delay after one of the cockpit crew members was offloaded prior to departure. Canadian authorities raised concerns regarding the pilot’s fitness for duty, following which the crew member was taken for further inquiry. In accordance with safety protocols, an alternate pilot was rostered to operate the flight, resulting in the delay. ”""Air India regrets the inconvenience caused to its passengers and is fully cooperating with the local authorities. The pilot has been taken off flying duties during the process of enquiry. Air India maintains a zero-tolerance policy towards any violation of applicable rules and regulations. Pending the outcome of the investigation, any confirmed violation will attract strict disciplinary action in line with company policy. Safety remains Air India’s highest priority at all times,” the airline statement added.Pilots operating international sectors usually do not have pre-flight breath analyser (BA) tests and the same is conducted on arrival as liquor is available on board these flights. This is to ensure they have not taken a sip or two during the flight. On domestic flights, pre-flights BA tests are conducted as alcohol is not served/sold on flights within India.While rules don’t mandate this, AI on its own has enforced a policy of conducting random pre-flight BA at international stations. The airline frequently keeps sending its doctors on international flights who then conduct these checks on pilots who are to operate the return flight to India.Pilots are surprised at this case. ""Forget drinking, we don’t even use after shaves, perfumes, mouth wash or homeopathic medicines some hours before operating a flight. There have been multiple instances of teetotallers failing BA tests because of the alcohol in their breath because of using toiletries with alcoholic content. We look for these items without any alcohol, except homeopathic medicines where possibly there’s no option,” said a captain. The reason: Failing BA test thrice means losing flying license.","A staffer at vancouver duty free either saw him inadvertently sipping wine being offered at this festive time or found him smelling of liquor while he was buying a bottle.

NEW DELHI: A Kolkata-based businessman weaved a web of 60 shell companies with drivers, house-keeping staff, office boys, junior staff and relatives as directors and created a fictitious turnover of thousands of crores in iron & steel manufacturing, all on paper with no real business activity involved, and swindled a consortium of govt banks of more than Rs 6,200 crore, with the head of one of the lead banks playing accessory.The scam was scripted by Sanjay Sureka, who created dozens of shell entities and with the help of S K Goel, then CMD of Uco Bank, managed to get loans of Rs 6,200 crore. ""Against loans of over Rs 6,200 crore, the company's liquidation value barely reached Rs 600 crore, and assets sold so far have realised only Rs 434 crore,"" ED has said in its investigation report.The entire operation was unearthed with Goel's arrest by ED on May 16 at his residence in New Delhi. The agency later identified properties worth over Rs 106 crore associated with family members and aides and attached them. Sureka and his associates were arrested in Dec 2024, as the agency started probing money laundering based on a CBI FIR against them.According to an ED investigation report, at the centre of this scam was Concast Steel & Power Ltd (CSPL) - once a flagship iron & steel group with plants across West Bengal, Odisha and Andhra Pradesh - which was taken over by Sureka in 2008.Sureka conjured up the shell entities and with the help of Goel, who served as CMD of Uco Bank between 2007-2010, managed to get a total of Rs 6,200 crore in loans without interest and penalty.This money was laundered by the accused and quid pro quo to Goel was transferred in the name of shell companies that purchased properties on the bank CMD's behalf with the ownership of these firms later being transferred to Goel's family members.""It is a case study in how an entire financial ecosystem can be manipulated through fake turnover, circular transactions and system-wide blind spots, ultimately leaving public sector banks poorer by more than Rs 6,210.7 crore, excluding interest,"" a senior official said.The official further said 60 shell companies sprang up under the directorship of drivers, office boys and junior staff to help Sureka justify massive flows of funds.ED's investigation unearthed fake sales, purchases and transport billings where CSPL ""pretended to buy and sell iron and steel products"" with associated entities, backed by forged invoices, ledger entries, and transport documents. ""Fake transportation receipts were prepared to show trucks carrying goods between factories and shell companies, even though no truck ever moved, no goods were loaded, and no delivery was made. Yet on paper, CSPL looked like a bustling, high-volume operation with continuous production and sales,"" a source said.The probe further revealed that neither sale proceeds nor payments for purchases were made through banks, 99% of the transactions were merely book entries. Yet, during the entire operation lasting several years, it did not raise any alarm bells in the banks, which continued lending.""This meant Concast was essentially selling to itself and then realising these payments through accounting fiction. By 2017, the deception hit its peak - 99% of all sales to these entities were settled through book adjustments, not a single real rupee flowed in through the banking system,"" sources said.Purchases tell the same story. Over 50% of all raw material sourcing came from the same web of related-party entities. And just like sales, almost 90% of payments to these ""suppliers"" were made through internal adjustments - no real cash outflow, no genuine material movement, just rotating entries to manufacture expenses, inflate working capital needs, and justify massive fund withdrawals, the probe report said.","The scam was scripted by sanjay sureka, who created dozens of shell entities.

NEW DELHI: Medical aspirants seeking postgraduate admissions will get a wider choice this year after the National Medical Commission (NMC) approved 171 additional PG seats across medical colleges and directed counselling authorities to include them without waiting for formal permissions.According to a public notice, the 171 additional seats span key clinical and diagnostic specialties, including general medicine, general surgery, anaesthesiology, obstetrics and gynaecology, paediatrics, radiology, dermatology, emergency medicine, psychiatry, orthopaedics, respiratory medicine and pathology.Colleges across multiple states - including Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Odisha, Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, West Bengal, Chhattisgarh and Haryana - have received additional seats under the appeal process.In a notice issued on Dec 31, 2025, NMC's Medical Assessment and Rating Board said postgraduate seats granted by the First Appeal Committee for the 2025-26 academic year will be treated as valid for the counselling process. Counselling authorities have been told they need not wait for letters of permission (LoPs) from individual institutions to proceed.The additional seats were approved after medical colleges challenged earlier MARB decisions under provisions of NMC Act, 2019.These appeals were examined by the First Appeal Committee in meetings held on Dec 22 and 23, following which extra seats were sanctioned.The commission clarified that the list uploaded on the NMC website would itself serve as the valid document for counselling, ensuring that eligible PG seats are not lost due to administrative delays. Formal LoPs for the newly sanctioned seats, it said, will be issued shortly.Officials said the move is aimed at maximising seat utilisation while retaining regulatory oversight through the appeal mechanism.

Where Tigers Get Caught Between Faith And Tourism | I Witness

Testing human tolerance

In early 2025, a motion-sensor camera high on the hills of Purulia district, West Bengal, blinked to life. The image it captured was unremarkable in isolation: the grainy silhouette of a tiger crossing scrubland. But for residents and forest officials, it was extraordinary. Purulia had never yielded a tiger sighting before. No camera traps, no spoor, no local memory of the big cat. The photograph was more than a record; it was a signal - that the landscape had begun to shift in ways people were only beginning to comprehend.Within weeks, researchers traced the animal's path through a series of camera traps: March 2024 in Chhattisgarh's Balrampur forest division; summer sightings in Jharkhand's Palamau Tiger Reserve; and by January 2025, in Bengal's Purulia and Jhargram. The tiger had wandered roughly 500 km through human-dominated terrain, crossing administrative and ecological boundaries in search of space.The tiger's journey is not an anomaly. It is part of a pattern. India's wild tiger population, once on the brink of collapse, has surged from 1,411 in 2006 to approximately 3,682 in the latest estimate - almost 75% of the world's wild tiger population. This rebound, often hailed as a conservation landmark, is the centrepiece of Project Tiger's story.Conservationists and forest staff took pride in the numbers, even as they now grapple with the consequences of unprecedented success.Scientists at the Wildlife Institute of India (WII) estimate that nearly 30% of these 3,682 tigers - more than 1,100 animals - now roam outside notified tiger reserves, sharpening the challenge of coexistence. WII director GS Bhardwaj told TOI that a dedicated Tiger Outside Tiger Reserves (TOTR) project has already been initiated from 2025, with the focus on conserving both tigers and people. The project targets forest divisions that host dispersing tigers, aims to mitigate human-tiger conflict linked to TOTR, and envisages strengthening protection regimes beyond reserve boundaries.But there is a paradox embedded in that success: Project Tiger became ""a little too successful"", as an expert said. As core reserves fill, tigers disperse farther - into buffers, across states and into human landscapes, fuelled by instinct, not intention. Tigers are inherently territorial; adults typically range across tens to hundreds of square km depending on prey and habitat. Studies in Indian landscapes have shown female home ranges between 30 and 64 sq km, with males sometimes exceeding 170 sq km. The average, even in prey-rich forests, often approaches 90 sq km.Bhardwaj said WII has advised all states to strengthen wildlife protection outside tiger reserves and carry out intensive monitoring of tigers moving beyond them, so that encounters do not escalate into human casualties or retaliatory killings.In the central Indian landscape - the broad swath of forests, hills and plateaus that includes Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and surrounding states - pressure is particularly acute. Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve, for instance, has one of the highest tiger densities in the country. A state-level review found territorial fights to be a major cause of death among tigers there between 2021 and 2023, reflecting intense competition for space and mates. With older males holding core territories, younger animals are pushed into buffer zones and near villages, raising the frequency of conflict. Bandhavgarh registers more than 2,000 cattle kills annually - a stark indicator of how tigers are pressed against the edges of ecological and social boundaries.Not all reserves exhibit the same degree of crowding though. In Uttarakhand, Corbett and Rajaji tiger reserves are approaching saturation, but nearly half of India's reserves remain below what scientists describe as their ecological capacity. Forest officials in the state have reported that Corbett can support about 20 tigers per 100 sq km, while eastern Rajaji's capacity is around 14 per 100 sq km - figures that help explain why animals increasingly stray outside protected areas.As tigers move beyond core forests, their presence ripples through local communities in palpable ways. In early 2025, in several villages in Uttar Pradesh's Pilibhit region, a prowling tiger caused schools to be closed. Children stayed home. ""Exams are coming,"" said a Class 5 student from Khalispur had then said, ""but we haven't even completed the syllabus."" Teachers refused to hold evening sessions. Parents stopped letting children walk alone. Tigers in Pilibhit often establish temporary bases in sugarcane fields, drawn by wild boars that feed on the sweet crop. Boars attract tigers. Sugarcane draws both. And between them lies the village.Elsewhere, the consequences have turned fatal. In Gadchiroli district of eastern Maharashtra, tiger numbers grew from zero to nearly 30 in five years - a startling shift in a landscape long considered tiger-scarce. With 12,000 sq km of forest, it appears generous on paper. But in practice, only about 7,000 sq km in two forest divisions is occupied. Human settlements, encroachments, and patchy prey base have constrained the actual carrying capacity. In 2024, 25 villagers died in tiger attacks across the Wadsa and Gadchiroli divisions. Two problem tigers were captured. A tigress was spared because she had cubs. Though technically capable of holding far more - by some estimates, up to 300 tigers - Gadchiroli cannot even accommodate 25 without triggering conflict.In one forest-fringe home in Jharkhand, a tiger entered a family's hut, settled on a wooden cot, and waited. The family, stunned, watched in silence from a corner of the room. The tiger had wandered far from mapped territory. Its entry was a mistake. Its departure, hours later, was quiet. Nobody was hurt. The event became a story of awe and fear.These tigers are no longer sentinels of wilderness. They are migrants. Monarchs in exile. Each one a ghost of ecological success, walking into fields, hamlets and homes - not out of aggression, but because the forests behind them are full.In some landscapes, officials speak of ""social carrying capacity"" - not how many tigers the habitat can sustain, but how many human communities are willing to tolerate. In parts of Uttarakhand, tiger-inflicted fatalities have surpassed leopard attacks for the first time in years. In response, village volunteers called Bagh Mitras have been trained to monitor tiger movement and alert forest departments. Some report sightings through mobile apps. Others simply listen for silence - the kind that descends before a tiger appears.Translocation - moving tigers from dense parks to underpopulated reserves - has been tried. Odisha attempted it in 2018, without success. Intra-state efforts show more promise, but officials now lean toward corridor consolidation. Movement is safer when it's natural. But for that, corridors must exist - not just on policy maps, but on the ground.In the Terai Arc, at least 10 critical corridors are under threat from habitat loss and development. In central India, linear infrastructure - railways, highways, power lines - cuts across migration routes. And yet, some reserves offer hope. In Tadoba, tiger density rose 30% over a decade, with buffer populations expanding as prey base improved. In Sundarbans, the reserve is being expanded by more than 1,000 sq km to create space for 101 tigers now crowding its mangrove heartland.India now has more than 50 tiger reserves. Some are full. Others still hold ecological potential, if prey can be restored. The key lies not just in creating new habitat, but in connecting the old - allowing dispersing tigers to move without triggering conflict.Perhaps the tiger today is not just an emblem of wilderness, but a kind of refugee of success - displaced by recovery. The Purulia tiger's trek is both a biometric trail and a metaphor. It is the story of a tiger with nowhere to go, walking east until the land gave way to politics and fear.In the empty classrooms of Pilibhit, in the living room of a Jharkhand family, in the cattle sheds of Bandhavgarh, and in the forests of Gadchiroli now marked by claw and memory, India's national animal is no longer confined to the forest. The tiger has returned. The question is - where can it stay?","India's wild tiger population, once on the brink of collapse, has surged from 1,411 in 2006 to approximately 3,682 in the latest estimate. As core reserves fill, tigers disperse farther - into buffers, across states and into human landscapes, fuelled by instinct, not intention.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126281010,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-111780,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"
India’s largest BOT highway project gets Cabinet nod; Surat–Chennai travel time to drop 45%,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indias-largest-bot-highway-project-gets-cabinet-nod-suratchennai-travel-time-to-drop-45/articleshow/126275834.cms,"AI image

NEW DELHI: Cabinet on Wednesday approved the construction of the 374-km greenfield access-controlled Nashik-Solapur-Akkalkot highway in Maharashtra, which is part of the Surat-Chennai high-speed corridor, at an estimated cost of Rs 19,142 crore.This will be the largest value of highway project on Build, Operate, Transfer (BOT) mode in the country’s NH development history, I&B minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said.The cabinet also approved widening and strengthening of the 206-km Mohana to Koraput stretch of NH-326 in Odisha with an estimated cost of Rs 1,526 crore, which will improve connectivity to major economic and logistics corridors, and better last-mile access to Gopalpur port and Jeypore airport.PM Narendra Modi termed the decision of greenfield highway in Maharashtra as “building next-generation infrastructure development”. On X, he said, “This transformative project, aligned with PM Gati Shakti, will significantly reduce travel time, strengthen west-east connectivity, boost logistics cost, and create large-scale employment.” An official said this will emerge as an alternative to the existing Mumbai-Chennai corridor.Vaishnaw told reporters that the corridor will reduce travel time between Nashik and Solapur due to reduction in distance and allowing vehicles to drive at higher speed. The project will be completed in two years from the date of start of work. “Because of this corridor, the travel time between Surat and Chennai will be reduced by 45% from 31 hours at present to 17 hours. This will facilitate heavy traffic between Surat, Vadodara and Mumbai towards Kurnool, Bengaluru and Chennai,” he added.The project will be developed in two large packages of 152 km (Nashik to Ahilyanagar) and 222 km (Ahilyanagar to Akkalkot). The traffic estimate for this corridor is projected around 39,000 passenger car units (PCUs) per day. TOI has learnt that while for the first package, the govt may have to provide viability gap funding of around Rs 495 crore, the NHAI is likely to get annual premium from successful private highway builders.Responding to questions on how the massive project can be completed in just two years, officials said that the project will be bid out after getting 90% land and obtaining all approvals. “The land acquisition is at an advanced stage for the entire project,” said an official.","The 374-km greenfield access-controlled nashik-solapur-akkalkot highway in maharashtra is part of the surat-chennai high-speed corridor. This will be the largest value of highway project on build, operate, transfer (bot) mode in the country’s nh development history, i&b minister ashwini vaishnaw said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126275907,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-201128,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

South Haryana districts like Gurgaon showed significant lag in SRB

GURUGRAM: Haryana's annual sex ratio at birth (SRB), the number of girls born per 1,000 boys, climbed to 923 in 2025, the first time it has showed a gain since 2019.Alarm bells rang last year after it fell to 910, its lowest since 2016 when the 'Beti Bachao, Beti Padhao' campaign was launched as a social campaign in a state with one of the lowest sex ratios in the country because of female infanticide.According to Civil Registration System (provisional) figures, the state registered 5,19,691 births last year, of which 2,70,281 were boys and 2,49,410 girls. Three districts reported an SRB of 950 or above, with Panchkula leading the state at 971, followed by Fatehabad (961) and Panipat (951).Karnal (944) and Yamunanagar (943) complete the top five. Sirsa (937), Nuh (935), Kurukshetra (927), Ambala (926), Hisar (926), Bhiwani (926) and Kaithal (924) were also above the state average.Health officials attributed the improvement to a series of crackdowns through 2025 against sex-selective abortions and sale of illegal medical termination of pregnancy (MTP) kits. An SRB of 923 is still low compared to other states but it's the highest Haryana has achieved. Over the years, the annual average has fluctuated, rather than held steady.South Haryana districts around Delhi, including Gurgaon (901), showed significant lag.Faridabad (916), Rohtak (898) and Sonipat (894) were among the weakest performers. Rewari (882) was placed at the bottom.Panchkula saw the most notable long-term improvement, from 909 in 2015 to 971 in 2025, despite dips in between, including a fall to 915 in 2024. Fatehabad, which was at 893 in 2015, climbed to 961 last year as did Panipat, which was at 892 in 2015. Gurgaon, despite its weaker performance compared to these districts, also saw an improvement from 858 in 2015.After the fall in SRB in 2024, a state-level task force was set up in March, with officers from health department, police, women and child development, AYUSH, National Health Mission (NHM) and the Food and Drug Administration reviewing SRB weekly.""A total of 114 FIRs were registered under MTP Act and 16 under PCPNDT (Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques) Act in 2025. Ultrasound inspections nearly doubled from 3,072 in 2024 to 5,836 in 2025. Reverse tracking of abortions beyond 12 weeks among women with previous girl children was a key tool. From Oct 2024 to Dec 2025, 3,292 such abortions were reported through Asha workers, leading to 68 FIRs against clinics, chemists, peddlers and middlemen,"" said Dr Virender Yadav, director of NHM, Haryana.Crackdowns on abortion kit sales intensified. FDA sealed 44 chemist shops last year and registered 59 FIRs, including 17 for online sales. More than 6,000 kits were seized. The number of abortions carried out beyond 10 weeks fell from 21,498 in 2024 to 14,204 in 2025. A total of 495 of the state's 1,500 registered MTP centres were shut for violations.","Haryana's annual sex ratio at birth (srb), the number of girls born per 1,000 boys, climbed to 923 in 2025. Three districts reported an srb of 950 or above, with panchkula leading the state at 971. South haryana districts like gurgaon showed significant lag in srb.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126296146,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-11638,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"
