NEW DELHI: Polling for the first phase of the Bihar Assembly elections 2025 began on Thursday morning across 121 constituencies in 18 districts, with over 3.75 crore eligible voters set to cast their ballots. Voting started at 7 am and will continue till 6 pm, though polling time has been curtailed to 5 pm in some constituencies due to security concerns.This phase will decide the political fate of several prominent leaders, including RJD’s Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, BJP ’s Samrat Choudhary and Mangal Pandey, and JD(U)’s Shravan Kumar and Vijay Kumar Choudhary. Tej Pratap Yadav is also contesting in this round.According to the Election Commission, there are 10.72 lakh new voters, including 7.78 lakh in the 18–19 age group, across constituencies with a combined population of 6.60 crore. Presiding officers handed over Electronic Voting Machines to polling agents ahead of voting day. Tejashwi Yadav , Mahagathbandhan’s chief ministerial candidate, is contesting from Raghopur, a seat he has held since 2015. He faces BJP’s Satish Kumar Yadav, who lost in 2020. His brother, Tej Pratap Yadav, who formed the Janshakti Janta Dal after quitting RJD, has fielded Prem Kumar from Raghopur while contesting himself from Mahua.The Jan Suraaj Party, led by Prashant Kishor, has fielded Chanchal Singh, making Raghopur a three-cornered contest.In Munger’s Tarapur seat, Deputy chief minister and BJP leader Samrat Choudhary faces RJD’s Arun Kumar and Jan Suraaj’s Santosh Kumar Singh. Deputy CM Vijay Kumar Sinha is contesting from Lakhisarai against Congress’ Amaresh Kumar and Jan Suraaj’s Suraj Kumar.The Mokama constituency, which has been in the news following the murder of Dularchand Yadav, will see JD(U) candidate Anant Kumar Singh — arrested in connection with the case — face Veena Devi, wife of former MP Surajbhan Singh.In Patna Sahib, traditionally a BJP stronghold, the contest is between BJP’s Ratnesh Kumar, also known as Ratnesh Khushwaha, and Congress’ Shashant Shekhar.Darbhanga has drawn attention with BJP fielding 25-year-old folk singer Maithili Thakur against RJD’s Binod Mishra. Thakur, the youngest candidate in the fray, could become Bihar’s youngest MLA if elected.Overall, 122 women candidates are contesting in this phase. The Jan Suraaj Party has fielded 119 candidates. Within the NDA, JD(U) is contesting 57 seats, BJP 48, and LJP (Ram Vilas) 14. Among Mahagathbandhan partners, RJD is contesting 73 seats, Congress 24, and CPI(ML) 14, with friendly contests on a few seats.In the 2020 Bihar Assembly elections, polling was held in three phases. The NDA won 125 seats while the Mahagathbandhan secured 110. JD(U) bagged 43 seats, BJP 74, RJD 75, and Congress 19.It briefly held the promise of a lip-smacking contest after Prashant Kishor teased a likely matchup with Tejashwi before finally opting out. But this Lalu Prasad family bastion remains among Bihar’s most-watched seats as Tejashwi eyes a hattrick this time. Lalu’s son, the opposition alliance’s CM face, is the towering figure in this seat in Vaishali (Hajipur) district dominated by Yadavs. But the tag of a prestige seat didn’t translate into significant development for Raghopur. Its long-awaited all-weather link with Patna became a reality only this June, when CM Nitish Kumar opened the six-lane Kacchi Dargah-Bidupur bridge, part of a longer Vaishali-Patna road. With no PK in the picture here, Tejashwi’s principal opponent is the man he defeated in 2015 and 2020, Satish Kumar. Now in BJP, he had won this seat for JDU in 2010, by defeating Tejashwi’s mother and former Bihar CM Rabri Devi.A political greenhorn takes on a contender who’s chasing redemption in this seat in Darbhanga district. But if Maithili Thakur can bank on her celebrity status as a singer and internet sensation in her maiden poll contest for BJP, Binod Mishra (63) of RJD would be hoping the math works in his favour this time since Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP), the party against which he had lost here in 2020, is now a Mahagathbandhan partner. Brahmins at 25% and Muslims with another 23% make up significant voting blocs in this seat in Mithila region, which Thakur has promised to rename if she wins. Her alleged show of disrespect to Mithila’s cultural symbol, the ‘pag’ or cap, sparked a controversy. She has also been labelled an outsider, but would be looking to build on Union home minister Amit Shah’s appeal of ‘prachand bahumat’ for her, calling her a ‘daughter of Mithila’.Bhojpuri star Khesari Lal Yadav — his real name is Shatrughan Yadav — has been grabbing eyeballs on his poll debut, though BJP’s Chhoti Kumari would be fancying her chances in the seat that her party has won three times running since 2010 with the exception of a byelection in 2014, when RJD prevailed. Saran district, of which Chhapra is a part, has thrown up both national and Bhojpuri icons like Jayaprakash Narayan (JP) and Bhikhari Thakur, who’s known as the ‘Shakespeare of Bhojpuri language’. Khesari has whipped up the campaign fever with de facto RJD boss Tejashwi Yadav and Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav holding rallies for him, but BJP’s own brigade of Bhojpuri stars — Ravi Kishen and Dinesh Lal Yadav ‘Nirahua’ — have weighed in to try and blunt his appeal.This seat has not gone BJP’s way in only one election since 2005 and the party has nominated the incumbent Jha to bag it again. He faces two new entrants — poll strategist Prashant Kishor’s Jan Suraaj Party and Indian Inclusive Party, whose founder Indrajeet Prasad Gupta is the challenger here. A massive rally held by Gupta featuring his supporters from the Pan and Tanti caste groups at Patna’s Gandhi Maidan is said to have drawn Mahagathbandhan CM face Tejashwi Yadav’s attention and led to IIP’s induction into the Mahagathbandhan. But there are no easy guesses as to the outcome here: if Jha polled more than a lakh votes in his winning bid in 2020, he’d also seen the rival RJD secure a similarly resounding mandate in 2015, when he had been on the losing side.If the Lok Sabha seat of the same name is associated with Yadav heavyweights like RJD founder Lalu Prasad and JDU’s Sharad Yadav, the assembly constituency has the record of never having gone with candidates of any other community. For challenger Saha, it’s a three-pronged task: become the first non-Yadav and woman to win the seat and find a way to deny Chandra Shekhar a fourth straight victory. Underlining the significance of this district, CM Nitish Kumar and Tejashwi Yadav have both campaigned for their party candidates. Yadavs make up around 32% of the population, and Muslims around 11% with SC community at 17.5%. The remaining 40% belong to the extremely backward caste (EBC) and ‘Pachpania’ groups, which have stayed heavily tilted in Nitish’s favour.This seat in Munger district made news when CM Nitish Kumar handed it to deputy CM and BJP leader Samrat Choudhary despite JDU having won it since 2010. He may have pitched the saffron camp’s most well-known face in Bihar in a socialist bastion, but the move revives a family link for Choudhary, whose father Shakuni Choudhary has represented Tarapur thrice while his mother Parvati, too, had won it in a 1998 bypoll. Choudhary takes on RJD’s Arun Kumar Sah in this agrarian constituency that has never elected a BJP MLA. Tarapur’s history is of radical opposites. Its natural beauty inspired poet Henry Derozio and painter Nandalal Bose, who was born nearby. During the 1930 Civil Disobedience movement, police firing killed 32 protesters here and later, in 1946, Tarapur witnessed ‘Partition riots’.Mokama has been tense following the recent killing of RJD supporter Dularchand Yadav during campaigning, allegedly by associates of JDU candidate and strongman Anant Singh, leading to Singh’s arrest. That’s seen as having put NDA, which has been targeting the opposition with reminders of Lalu Prasad’s ‘jungle raj’, on the back foot here. On the eastern edge of Patna district, Mokama has been on the windward side of development — it is linked to north Bihar and Howrah through Rajendra Setu, the state’s first rail-cum-road bridge, and hosts an NTPC plant while a four-lane road bridge was inaugurated by PM Modi recently. Singh’s family dominates the seat — his wife and brother Dilip have held this seat while Singh himself has won it five times, including in 2020, but from the RJD camp. He has now switched sides.Former Bihar assembly speaker, RJD’s Choudhary is a six-time MLA from this seat, while BJP and its earlier avatar Jana Sangh, too, have had a good run here. Siwan district’s national recall comes in equal measure for being the birthplace of India’s first President Babu Rajendra Prasad and being the turf of the late Mohd Shahabuddin, strongman and local MP. Under Shahabuddin, Siwan was seen as an RJD bastion, and Choudhary would be hoping to capitalise on old loyalties. Facing him is BJP MLC and Bihar health and family welfare minister Pandey, who is making his poll debut. The presence of Kafi Shamshir of AIMIM and Intekhan Ahmad of Jan Suraaj Party makes the contest in this seat that has a sizeable presence of Muslim voters a tricky one to call.","Voting started at 7 am and will continue till 6 pm, though polling time has been curtailed to 5 pm in some constituencies due to security concerns.

'No Remorse, God Provoked Me': Lawyer Rakesh Kishore Defends His Shoe Attack On CJI BR Gavai

MUMBAI: CJI BR Gavai laid the foundation stone for the new high court complex in Bandra (East) on Wednesday and asked authorities to ensure there is no extravagance in its construction. ""A court building is a temple of justice and not a seven star-hotel,"" CJI Gavai said.Addressing a gathering, he emphasised the new building would house a constitutional court. He said its architect, Hafeez Contractor, should ensure it depicts democratic values and not imperialist ones.""Judges are no longer feudal lords,"" the CJI said. ""While planning court buildings, we concentrate on the needs of judges, but we should not forget all of us exist for the needs of litigants, the citizens of the country who come to court to seek justice. Bar and bench are wheels of the golden chariot for the administration of justice.""Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis said he would request the contractor to ensure the complex encompasses ""democratic grandeur"" so that all functional areas convey to citizens that they will get justice here.Earlier in the day, the CJI inaugurated the project initiation ceremony for the city campus of the Maharashtra National Law University (MNLU) in Goregaon.Dilip Ukey, MNLU vice-chancellor, said the vision was to make it a hub of world-class legal education. The CJI invoked the contributions of Babasaheb Ambedkar to encourage students to be socially engaged.At the HC complex ceremony, the CJI said it was his last visit to the state before demitting the top judicial post on Nov 24, and noted he was satisfied with the judicial infrastructure in his home state.""I was reluctant to be part of this event. But now I am experiencing gratitude that, as a judge who once discharged his duties in Bombay HC, I am ending my tenure with laying the foundation stone of the best court building in the entire country.

ED seeks MEA help to take up Uppal's release 'at the highest diplomatic level'

NEW DELHI: The perplexing manner in which Ravi Uppal, a high-value accused in the Rs 6,000-crore Mahadev app money laundering case, left Dubai despite a pending extradition request, puts a wrinkle on otherwise smooth UAE-India ties. UAE has also not informed New Delhi of where he has travelled to.Uppal was considered a big catch for Indian enforcement agencies, probing the illegal betting syndicate. Multiple agencies, including ED and CBI, were probing alleged payments of kickbacks of more than Rs 500 crore involving former Chhattisgarh CM and Congress leader Bhupesh Baghel.Uppal was recently released from Dubai police's custody despite the extradition request pending since Dec 2023, when he was arrested on an Interpol Red Corner Notice.India has an extradition treaty with the UAE, and in the past, the latter had extradited high-profile accused, including British national Christian Michel, an arms dealer, held in the AgustaWestland VVIP chopper 'scam'.India had sent the extradition request ""duly transmitted through official diplomatic channels"" after Dubai police informed New Delhi of Uppal's arrest in Dec 2023, sources said.""Despite timely submission and verifiable proof of delivery, UAE authorities later claimed that no extradition request had been received and released the accused.This assertion contradicts the documentation available with the Indian side,"" a source said.While Enforcement Directorate (ED) has sought the ministry of external affairs (MEA) help to take up the matter ""at the highest diplomatic level"" to ensure adherence to treaty commitments by the UAE, officials here are perplexed by the manner in which such a high-profile accused has been allowed to disappear from custody despite a formal request for extradition pending and the Interpol's Red Corner Notice still active.UAE authorities have also not informed India about Uppal's destination, which country he has travelled to while leaving the UAE.""MEA guidelines on extradition procedures clearly state that a formal extradition request must be submitted within 45 to 60 days from the date of provisional arrest, and even if the fugitive is released, it does not preclude re-arrest and extradition once the request is received,"" a senior official said. Sourabh Chandrakar, who like Ravi Uppal is a promoter of the syndicate, is also under detention based on a similar Red Corner Notice. A special court in Raipur, Chhattisgarh, had issued a non-bailable warrant against them, leading to the Interpol notice for their arrest, and subsequently, extradition requests.","Ravi uppal, a high-value accused in the rs 6,000-crore mahadev app money laundering case, left dubai despite a pending extradition request.

'Don't Drag Army Into Politics': Rajnath Singh Tears Into Rahul Gandhi Over Remarks On Army

PATNA: Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Wednesday warned leader of opposition in the Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi against ""dragging the Army into politics"", dismissing his claim that ""10% of the country's population"" controls the armed forces, bureaucracy and judiciary as a ludicrous statement implying a demand for caste-based reservation in the military.""Whenever this country has faced a crisis, our soldiers have held India's head high with their bravery.

Politics of caste and religion, he added, had already caused great harm to country.Rahul had made the ""10%"" remark during an INDIA bloc rally in Aurangabad the previous day, alleging that upper castes corner opportunities across institutions.Rajnath accused Rahul of routinely making baseless allegations against constitutional bodies to mask the opposition's electoral failures. He said Congress and its allies had targeted EC with charges of vote theft without any proof. ""They blame EC, which demands evidence, but they refuse to provide any.Fearing defeat in Bihar, they have now dropped another hydrogen bomb. The people of Bihar have already made them realise their defeat is certain. That's why they are taking dips in ponds,"" he said, referring to Rahul's boat-jump and swim in Begusarai recently.

'Your Future Is Being Stolen': Rahul Gandhi's Bold Message to India's Gen Z For Democratic Change

NEW DELHI: BJP on Wednesday dismissed Congress MP Rahul Gandhi 's vote theft allegations in the Haryana assembly polls last year as baseless, claiming that he had resorted to a diversionary tactic realising that the opposition was staring at a crushing defeat in the Bihar elections Union minister Kiren Rijiju accused Rahul of trying to incite Gen Z against the govt, asserting the young population is with PM Narendra Modi as India continues to notch up high economic growth under him. Rijiju said Rahul's ""baseless"" vote theft charges were borne out of his defeatist mentality and were devoid of any merit, while his cabinet colleague and Bihar poll in-charge Dharmendra Pradhan added, ""Rahul Gandhi has become a research centre of lies and false narratives. "" ""Nobody takes him seriously. But he cannot escape the responsibility for another failure despite all these ploys,"" Pradhan said, adding the presser was a gimmick aimed at shielding himself against the opposition's impending Bihar defeat.""The truth is he (Rahul) wants to wash his hands of the impending defeat by resorting to such ploys. He knows the Mahagathbandhan is in tatters and people are continuously rejecting them.""Rijiju said several Congress netas, including Kumari Selja, have blamed internal reasons for its defeat in Haryana. Citing Rahul's claim that a woman voted 223 times in two booths, BJP IT department head Amit Malviya said it is ""downright laughable"" as it amounts to one vote being cast every three minutes, considering polling is conducted between 7 am to 6 pm.""And, apparently, no one - not security personnel, not polling officers verifying IDs - noticed this superwoman showing up every three minutes across two booths.

When Love Turns Lethal: Inside India’s Honeymoon Murders | The Silent Crisis No One Talks About





BENGALURU: ""I killed my wife for you."" Dr Mahendra Reddy GS, main accused in the murder of his dermatologist-wife Kruthila Reddy, sent out this cryptic and loaded message to at least 4-5 women, including a medical professional who had spurned his proposal, weeks after his wife's death.In a desperate bid to give marriage a second start, Mahendra got in touch with women, who had earlier dumped him, and came back from the dead to make renewed proposals to half-a-dozen women.According to police, Mahendra administered anaesthesia and killed his wife Kruthika, 29, on April 24. He was arrested on Oct 14 from Manipal, Udupi district, for his wife's death.Police said Mahendra had messaged ‘I killed my wife for you' to the medical professional — not a doctor — through a digital-payment app after she had blocked him on multiple messaging platforms.Police have seized his mobile phone and laptop and sent them to a forensic science laboratory. The data revealed his messages to the woman.Deputy commissioner of police (Whitefield) K Parashurama confirmed the messages were sent through PhonePe, a digital-payment app. The woman's statement has been recorded, but police are not revealing any details due to the ongoing investigation.The woman reportedly told police that she had blocked Mahendra before his marriage.After learning about his marriage to Kruthika, the woman stayed away from him. However, he messaged ‘a confession' to her a couple of months after killing his wife. Until Mahendra was arrested on murder charges, the woman had assumed he was falsely confessing to the murder only with an intention to talk to her, a senior police officer said, adding the woman has no role in the crime.Investigating officers found that Mahendra was also in contact with a Mumbai-based woman until 2023. He proposed to marry her and met her a few times. Later, he made his father call and inform her that he had ""died in an accident"". After that, he was not in contact with her.However, Mahendra rose from the ashes and called her in Sept to confirm he was not dead. Instead, according to his astrological chart, his first wife was going to die. Since his ""love for her was genuine"", he told her that he had lied to her and got married to Kruthika. As his wife was dead now, he said that he wanted to marry her.","Dr mahendra reddy gs, main accused in the murder of his dermatologist-wife kruthila reddy, sent out this cryptic and loaded message to at least 4-5 women, including a medical professional.

‘We Are Growing Rapidly’ Karnataka Minister Links Bengaluru Jams To Rapid City Growth





BENGALURU: After Airports Authority of India flagged major challenges that must be addressed before any of the three proposed sites is approved for setting up a second international airport in and around Bengaluru, the state appears inclined towards south Bengaluru, especially along Kanakapura Road and Bannerghatta Road corridors, due to better infrastructure and connectivity.Tamil Nadu's move to establish a new airport in Hosur has added urgency to Karnataka's plans, as the proposed Hosur airport aims to attract passengers from southern Bengaluru.With passenger traffic at Kempegowda International Airport already exceeding its design capacity, the state govt views the second airport as crucial to handling demand expected to double within a decade. However, identifying suitable land within a 100-120km radius of the city remains difficult, with environmental, financial, and airspace constraints likely to delay the Rs 10,000-crore project.An official in the infrastructure development department (IDD) said an assessment of passengers travelling from Kempegowda International Airport (KIA) in Devanahalli suggests that no less than 40 million passengers of the estimated 85 million travellers, which is the maximum that BIAL airport can accommodate, will be from south Bengaluru. ""This effectively suggests that south Bengaluru needs the second airport, failing which the passengers from those areas will look at Hosur as an alternative destination,"" said the official.However, infrastructure minister MB Patil clarified the govt will not finalise any location until a detailed feasibility study is completed. ""All the three sites will be considered for a techno-feasibility study by a prominent consultant.We will be presenting a strong pre-qualification for the tender bidding, with prior experience in preparing feasibility studies for greenfield projects and also airports. There will be no decision taken on the location of the airport before the study report is submitted,"" he said, adding the final report will be presented before the cabinet for approval.","Bengaluru is leaning towards south bengaluru for its second international airport, eyeing kanakapura and bannerghatta road corridors due to existing infrastructure and connectivity.

Cops also disconnected the LED boards at Revive Hair Cutting Salon, Baga, and Whiskey Pedia, Arpora, and charged the owners under BNS and IT Act provisions for threatening India's unity, integrity, security and sovereignty.CM Pramod Sawant said, ""The boards were put up without permission.

AHMEDABAD: 'Hard videographic proof' of three persons - one allegedly wielding an AK-47 - being involved in the 2002 communal riots withered away during trial, with the videographer recanting his statement and the tape disappearing. An Ahmedabad court has finally acquitted the three accused.The trio was booked on a complaint filed by a videographer, Satish Dalwadi, who had allegedly recorded footage during an episode of communal violence showing the accused carrying firearms. However, the video tape was never produced in court, and the videographer did not support the prosecution's case. He was declared a hostile witness.The case pertained to two FIRs registered at Dariapur police station in connection with rioting on April 14, 2002. The FIRs were filed after Satish submitted a VHS cassette purportedly showing Alamgiri Shaikh, Hanif Shaikh, Imtiyaz Shaikh, Raufmiya Saiyed and others involved in the violence. Satish, a member of area peace committee, had been asked by then Dariapur police inspector, R H Rathod, to record incidents of communal violence, if any.Following an investigation, police filed chargesheets stating that Imtiyaz was carrying an automatic firearm resembling an AK-47 while an unidentified person was seen with a revolver, both targeting members of the Hindu community.Based on Dalwadi's recording, the accused were charged under the Arms Act and IPC.Over the course of 23 years, one of the accused, Hanif Shaikh, and some of the witnesses, including an investigating officer, died.Many witnesses turned hostile. One told the court that his signature had been taken while he was having tea at a restaurant. Complainant and videographer Satish said he did not know what exactly he had recorded. A police sub-inspector, H H Chauhan, also turned hostile.In its order, the court noted that during proceedings, the video cassette was not presented. ""Moreover, no weapon has been recovered in this case, nor has any oral or documentary evidence been presented to show that the accused had weapons at the time of the alleged crime,"" it said.","The trio was booked on a complaint filed by a videographer, satish dalwadi.

'Will Cut Off Your Tongue': Bihar Poll Campaign Turns Ugly, AIMIM Candidate Threatens Tejashwi Yadav

Tej, Anant Singh and Maithili to face battle for ballots today



PATNA: Ministers, movie and music stars, and a murder accused. The stage is set, the battle lines drawn. Bihar's political elite - CM hopeful Tejashwi Yadav of RJD, two deputy CMs, and 13 cabinet ministers - brace for a verdict from 3.75 crore voters in the first phase of assembly elections in 121 constituencies on Thursday.A total of 1,314 candidates are in the fray, their fate to be sealed in 45,341 polling stations across 18 districts.Nitish Kumar-led NDA has much at stake: of its 15 ministers in fray, 10 belong to BJP, including deputy CMs Samrat Choudhary (Tarapur) and Vijay Kumar Sinha (Lakhisarai), and five are from JD(U), including Vijay Kr Choudhary (Sarairanjan) and education minister Sunil Kumar (Bhore).For INDIA bloc's CM face Tejashwi, the contest in Raghopur, his family's stronghold, is a test of dominance. Seeking a hat-trick, he faces Satish Kumar of BJP, who once humbled RJD patriarch Lalu Prasad's wife and former CM Rabri Devi in 2010 as a JD(U) nominee. Jan Suraaj's Prashant Kishor, who had vowed to challenge him, later stepped back.Tejashwi’s elder brother Tej Pratap Yadav is contesting from Mahua in Vaishali district under his new Janshakti Janata Dal banner. Tej Pratap was expelled from RJD earlier this year after controversies over his personal life.In Tarapur, BJP’s Samrat Choudhary — contesting a direct election after nearly a decade — seeks to prove his mettle against RJD’s Arun Kumar Sah, who narrowly lost the last bypolls. In Lakhisarai, deputy CM Vijay Sinha eyes a fourth straight term against Congress’s Amresh Kumar and Jan Suraaj’s Suraj Kumar.The drama peaks in Mokama, where JDU strongman Anant Singh faces RJD’s Veena Devi, wife of don-turned-politician Surajbhan Singh. Both hail from the same Bhumihar community — a duel as personal as it is political.Former MLA Anant Singh was arrested on Nov 1 for the killing of strongman-politician and Jan Suraaj supporter Dularchand Yadav, days after a clash between rival convoys in Mokama. Singh was released from Beur jail on Aug 6 and returned to the same prison following his arrest.The first phase also brings glamour to the fray with folk singer Maithili Thakur (Alinagar, BJP), Bhojpuri superstar Khesari Lal Yadav (Chhapra, RJD) and singer Ritesh Pandey (Kargahar, Jan Suraaj) adding a showbiz sparkle to the ballot.According to EC data, Digha in Patna has the largest electorate at 4.5 lakh, while Barbigha in Sheikhpura has the smallest with 2.3 lakh voters. Kurhani and Muzaffarpur top the list with 20 candidates each, while Bhore, Alauli, and Parbatta see just five contenders.State’s chief electoral officer Vinod Singh Gunjiyal said Wednesday all necessary preparations have been made for fair elections, while EVMs and voter verifiable paper audit trail (VVPAT) were distributed among the polling parties despatched to the booths.Among the 3.7 crore voters in this round, 10.7 lakh are new entrants, including 7.3 lakh in the 18–19 age group — young voices that could tip the scales in what promises to be a gripping first act of Bihar’s political showdown.","A total of 1,314 candidates are in the fray, their fate to be sealed in 45,341 polling stations across 18 districts.

‘NDA Will Form Govt Again Under Nitish Kumar’s Leadership’: Bihar Dy CM Vijay Sinha Ahead Of Polls

NEW DELHI: NDA is banking on its reinforced alliance and the appeal of its welfare measures in regions going to polls in Bihar on Thursday to turn the tide in its favour in areas where the Mahagathbandhan (MGB) had edged past it in the last assembly election.In 2020, RJD-led opposition had won 61 of the 121 seats that go to polls in the first phase, against NDA's 59, performing strongly in Shahabad region and key districts such as Patna, Bhojpur, Saran and Siwan.Back then, Chirag Paswan's Lok Janshakti Party and Upendra Kushwaha, who headed RLSP, had fought separately, helping MGB gain ground in several constituencies, including Begusarai and Buxar. With both Paswan and Kushwaha back in NDA, alliance netas now believe their social coalition has been significantly strengthened. They are also counting on the impact of the govt's welfare initiatives - notably the Rs 10,000 cash transfer to over 1.3 crore women - to sway the voters.In 50 seats across Patna, Bhojpur, Buxar, Saran, Siwan and Begusarai, MGB had bagged 35 in 2020. CPI-ML Liberation, with its strong base among the poor across caste lines, had played a crucial role in MGB's success.A BJP neta said the alliance expects a major recovery in these districts as well as in Magadh and Shahabad regions, where polling is scheduled in the second phase on Nov 11.Home minister Amit Shah's claim that NDA's tally will rise from 125 seats in 2020 to over 160 stems from confidence of improving its performance in regions that favoured MGB earlier, he added.In 2020, Paswan had walked out of NDA and had dented the alliance's vote base, particularly in seats contested byJDU, while Kushwaha's support was tepid. The return of both netas and the rise of deputy CM Samrat Chaudhary within BJP have boosted the morale of the Kushwaha community, the second-largest OBC bloc after Yadavs, comprising about 4.2% of Bihar's population.In the first phase, JDU is contesting 57 seats, BJ and other allies six, while RJD is fighting more than 70, Congress 24 and CPI-ML 14, with VIP, CPI and CPM also in fray.","In 2020, rjd-led opposition had won 61 of the 121 seats that go to polls in the first phase, against nda's 59.

'Your Future Is Being Stolen': Rahul Gandhi's Bold Message to India's Gen Z For Democratic Change

NEW DELHI: The Election Commission on Wednesday asked Rahul Gandhi why his party had not filed a single appeal after the final electoral roll used for Haryana assembly polls in 2024, was published.Reacting to his fresh allegations of 'vote chori' in Haryana - timed a day before the first phase of polling in Bihar and the day after enumeration started for Phase 2 of SIR - EC suggested the evidence of roll anomalies with respect to Rai and Hodal assembly constituencies in Haryana, may be placed before HC since it is hearing election petitions (EPs) challenging the result in both ACs. Overall, just 23 EPs were filed in Haryana after the poll.The EC official said that while Rahul, on the one hand, opposes SIR - aimed at purifying the electoral roll by removing voters who are dead, enrolled at two or more places, permanently shifted or non-citizens - ""he keeps giving presentations to bring out impurities in the past rolls"".""It is clear he has warmed up to SIR after having criticised it in the beginning.""Pointing out the lack of any objections on the draft roll by its booth-level agents in Bihar or any appeals before the DM after publication of final rolls in Haryana and Bihar, EC said Rahul and Congress tend to raise irregularities after failing to avail of the multiple opportunities available under the law and relevant rules to have them corrected. ""Besides, what were the polling agents of Congress doing? They are supposed to object if the elector who has already voted turns up again, or where his identity is under doubt,"" said an EC official.The official also wondered how Rahul had, given the secret ballot, assumed duplicate voters had voted for BJP. On several voters being shown at the same address, EC sources said 'house number zero' is a generic description used where the house number has not been allotted by the panchayat or municipality.Haryana CEO said the draft roll and final roll were shared with all parties including the Congress. Over 4 lakh claims and objections were received against the draft roll but not a single appeal was filed with the DM after the final rolls were out.","The election commission on wednesday asked rahul gandhi why his party had not filed a single appeal after the final electoral roll used for haryana assembly polls in 2024, was published.

BAREILLY: A blind man was booked for hunting deer, a mentally ill man shackled since childhood was accused of cutting down trees, and a man who cannot walk was charged with climbing a tree to destroy nests. These are not isolated errors but part of over 4,000 forest crime cases filed in 2012 against members of the Tharu tribal community in Lakhimpur Kheri district, during the Samajwadi Party government's tenure.Many of the accused continue to appear in court more than a decade later.Among those named in FIRs is Surdas Ram Bhajan (40), who has been blind since birth. ""I have never even seen the forest,"" he said. ""I walk with my 70-year-old mother's help. My younger brother, Rajjan, has a mental disability and has been in chains since childhood, yet both of us were booked."" Rajjan, 37, was accused of illegal tree cutting. Their mother, Gulaboo Devi, said, ""My sons never even went to the forest, but the department trapped them in false cases. ""Har Dayal Singh, 55, who has a chronic spinal disorder, was charged with climbing trees to destroy bird nests. ""They say I climbed a tree.Maybe in my next life. Right now, I can barely stand,"" he said. Village priest Karm Lal was also booked - in his case, for selling wild meat. ""I haven't left the village in years. I don't know the forest or the market,"" he said.The Tharu community, an indigenous group native to Terai region of UP, Uttarakhand, Bihar and southern Nepal, has historically relied on farming and forest-based livelihoods. After Dudhwa was declared a national park in 1977 and upgraded to a tiger reserve in 1988, several Tharu villages ended up within or alongside protected forest zones, losing access to land and resources. Although Forest Rights Act of 2006 aimed to provide legal rights to scheduled tribes and forest dwellers for habitation, cultivation and forest use, many Tharu claims filed in Lakhimpur Kheri were rejected or left pending.BJP MLA Romi Sahani from Palia constituency said the mass registration of cases in 2012 followed a petition filed by a Tharu union seeking legal recognition of their forest rights. While the matter was still being heard, a group of locals entered the jungle to collect fallen firewood. ""The forest department took the voter list and charged nearly every resident,"" said Sahani. ""They filed cases not only against those who went in the forest, but also people who never left home, the physically incapable, and even the dead. "" Shahni has raised the matter with CM Yogi Adityanath.In Sariya Parah, where the population is around 1,500, at least 375 were booked under various provisions of Indian Forest Act and Wildlife (Protection) Act. Village pradhan Ram Bahadur has 29 cases against him, of whi-ch he has got bail in 26. ""I have spent more than Rs 9 lakh on legal expenses and had to borrow Rs 3.5 lakh to keep up with the cases,"" he said.Badhana Devi, 70, said she had spent five decades praying at home but was accused of selling liquor and wild meat. ""If we raise our voices or refuse to pay when officers come, we are threatened with new cases,"" she said.Many villagers said they were not informed or notified before being charged.Despite multiple representations over the years to forest officers and elected officials, little action was taken until recently. Raja Mohan, field director of Dudhwa Tiger Reserve, told TOI that while charge sheets had been submitted earlier, the department is now revisiting the matter. ""We will comment after the review,"" he said.Last month, gram pradhans from seven Tharu villages met Adityanath in Lucknow and urged him to intervene.

PM Modi Warns of Cong, RJD's 'Dangerous Plot' to Alter Demographic Balance in Bihar Border Districts

The alliance contradiction in Bihar



Rahul’s line carried more than one message



The seat-sharing tussle exposed the balance of power



A familiar pattern across the INDIA bloc



Bihar exposes the reality again



NEW DELHI: Campaign heat in Bihar intensified this week after Congress leader Rahul Gandhi told a rally that Prime Minister Narendra Modi could “even dance for a vote.” The line was framed as a critique of spectacle-driven politics. But the timing gave it layered political weight.Just days earlier, Tejashwi Yadav had gone viral while dancing with local youth during an outreach event. And when Rahul linked PM Modi to the Ambani family, it was quickly noted that Tejashwi and the Lalu family had also attended the same wedding celebrations. Though the attack landed on PM Modi, the echo pierced into the INDIA bloc.Congress and RJD stand together today, but their power trajectories were shaped in opposition to each other. In the 1985 Bihar assembly election, Congress was the state’s dominant force, winning 196 of 324 seats with about 39 per cent vote share. The rise of Lalu Prasad Yadav in the post-Mandal decade reconfigured the social base with OBC consolidation, and new caste mobilisations shifted the centre of gravity. By 1990, Congress had fallen to 71 seats, and Lalu’s Janata Dal had come to power.When Lalu formed the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) in 1997, the shift became permanent. The party inherited Congress’s Yadav–Muslim core, organisational networks, and district-level nodes. By the 2020 election, RJD was the single largest party with 75 seats, while Congress was reduced to 19 seats, struggling to hold even pockets it once dominated.Rahul’s rhetoric targeted the BJP by casting Modi as performative and aligned with corporate power. But it also subtly differentiated Congress from its ally. That signalling was directed at urban, youth and minority constituencies where the Congress hopes to rebuild.In that frame, Tejashwi’s dance clip became a visual contrast, and the Ambani reference brushed against RJD because both leaderships were seen in the same frame of elite access. The outcome was political shading: an attack outward that cast a carefully measured shadow inward.Seat-sharing negotiations between RJD and Congress this season were prolonged and tense. RJD, backed by a larger cadre structure and broader voter base, argued for limiting Congress to a smaller quota than in 2020. Congress, citing national visibility and Rahul Gandhi’s campaign traction, pushed for expansion.The disagreement spilled into public view. Congress leaders accused RJD of treating it as dispensable. RJD leaders countered that Congress’s ground presence did not justify its demands. The standoff delayed candidate announcements, forced hurried swaps, and left smaller allies squeezed. The episode indicated that the alliance is driven by electoral compulsion, not ideological alignment.The contradiction on display in Bihar is part of a broader pattern across the INDIA bloc, where several of Congress’s current allies originally rose by eroding its own political base. In Uttar Pradesh, Mulayam Singh Yadav formed the Samajwadi Party in 1992 and consolidated the OBC and Muslim vote that had once anchored the Congress.In West Bengal, Mamata Banerjee broke away in 1998 to form the Trinamool Congress and, over time, absorbed Congress’s organisational networks in both urban centres and rural belts. In Maharashtra, Sharad Pawar’s split in 1999 and the creation of the NCP established a parallel power structure that drew away district leaders, cooperative institutions and vote blocs from the Congress.These parties did not simply emerge alongside Congress; they expanded by replacing it in the very regions where Congress had once been dominant.RJD seeks to retain primacy. Congress seeks to prove it is not a junior spectator. Rahul’s remark, therefore, worked on two planes: it targeted Modi’s persona politics while subtly reminding the Bihar electorate that Congress is still a political claimant, not an accessory. The INDIA bloc remains together. But in Bihar, as always, the real contest is not who stands on the same stage, but who stands taller.","Congress and rjd stand together today, but their power trajectories were shaped in opposition to each other. In the 1985 bihar assembly election, congress was the state’s dominant force. The rise of lalu prasad yadav in the post-mandal decade reconfigured the social base with obc consolidation.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125110281,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-49052,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

‘NDA Will Form Govt Again Under Nitish Kumar’s Leadership’: Bihar Dy CM Vijay Sinha Ahead Of Polls

Caste arithmetic in Gaura Bauram



Total electorate:

Estimated blocs:

VIP counts on consolidation in the end

A peculiar contest has emerged in Darbhanga’s Gaura Bauram constituency. Amid uncertainty and confusion during seat-sharing within the Mahagathbandhan, RJD had initially allotted the ticket to Afzal Ali Khan. Later, the seat was handed over to Mukesh Sahni’s VIP. Sahni then fielded his younger brother Santosh Sahni from here but Afzal Ali refused to withdraw. Treating this as indiscipline, RJD yesterday expelled Afzal Ali for six years with immediate effect.This sets up a potential split in the Muslim vote between Afzal Ali and Santosh Sahni, this could end up benefiting the BJP.BJP has fielded former IRS officer Sujeet Kumar Singh. His wife Swarna Singh had won from here in the previous election on VIP’s ticket, but later joined BJP. The seat has a sizeable Mallah population, the reason Mukesh Sahni had originally demanded it for himself but eventually nominated his younger brother.RJD insists that Santosh Sahni is the authorised Mahagathbandhan candidate. But on paper, Afzal Ali continues to remain the nominated nominee — something that could complicate Santosh’s prospects. Afzal Ali had lost by barely 7,000 votes the last time when he contested on RJD’s ticket.2.65 lakhMuslim 70k, Yadav 28k, Mallah 26k, Brahmin 33k, Vaishya 20k, Paswan 15k, other SC 25k.BJP’s Sujeet Kumar Singh is from the Rajput community, which is not numerically dominant here. However, he believes he can ride on the BJP’s core vote base plus Mahagathbandhan’s internal rebellion.Speaking to us, he claimed that barring Muslims, every caste group is voting for me. He also claimed a large chunk of Yadavs are backing him. Singh resigned from the IRS only a week before receiving the BJP ticket and believes his “education and clean image” will work as an added advantage.VIP spokesperson Dev Jyoti said within 24 hours of Afzal Ali’s expulsion, the “wind has swung” in VIP’s favour. He expressed confidence that Muslim voters, at the end of the day, will back the candidate best placed to defeat the BJP. He also said the backing of Lalu Prasad Yadav and Tejashwi Yadav is firmly with VIP here.However, some minority voters argue that since RJD had already issued the nomination earlier, Mukesh Sahni shouldn’t have disturbed the seat.","Bjp has fielded former irs officer sujeet kumar singh.

When Love Turns Lethal: Inside India’s Honeymoon Murders | The Silent Crisis No One Talks About

NEW DELHI: In a chilling case reminiscent of the Bollywood thriller Drishyam, Ahmedabad Police have uncovered the remains of a man who was allegedly murdered by his wife, her lover and his relatives. The body was found buried beneath the kitchen floor of his own home.The victim, 35-year-old Samir Ansari, had been missing for almost a year before police made the shocking discovery on Tuesday night.Acting on a tip-off, the Ahmedabad crime branch found bones and other remains buried beneath the kitchen floor of his locked house in Sarkhej.Deputy commissioner of police (Crime) Ajit Rajian said that Ansari’s wife, Ruby, who is currently absconding, conspired with her alleged lover Imran Vaghela and two of his relatives, Rahim and Mohsin, to kill him.""While Vaghela, who lives in the same area, has been arrested, Ruby along with two relatives of Vaghela -- Rahim and Mohsin -- are still absconding,"" Rajian confirmed. He added that the recovered remains have been sent for forensic and DNA analysis.According to police, Ruby and Imran allegedly plotted the murder after Ansari began confronting her over her extramarital affair.“Vaghela claimed Ruby hatched the plan to kill Ansari because he used to thrash her after learning about her extramarital affair and she saw him as an obstacle in her illicit relationship,” said DCP Rajian.Investigators said that on the night of the murder, Imran slit Ansari’s throat with Ruby’s help. The accused then dismembered the body, buried it inside a pit dug in the kitchen and sealed it with cement and tiles to erase all visible traces.For months, Ruby continued to live in the same house with her two children before eventually moving out, telling neighbours that her husband had gone to another city for work.Ansari, originally from Bihar, had moved to Ahmedabad in 2016 after his love marriage with Ruby. He worked as a mason to support his family.Police said the case came to light three months ago after a local tip-off revealed Ansari’s prolonged absence. During questioning, Imran reportedly broke down and confessed to the murder.A crime branch team, accompanied by an executive magistrate, exhumed the remains from the cemented kitchen floor on Tuesday night. Forensic experts are now conducting tests to confirm the identity of the victim and gather further evidence.","Samir ansari, 35, was allegedly murdered by his wife, her lover and his relatives.

NEW DELHI: As soon as Congress leader Rahul Gandhi dropped the 'H-files' on Wednesday, alleging big vote theft in Haryana, the Election Commission countered him. The poll body asked Gandhi why booth-level agents, who are appointed by political parties to oversee voting and flag irregularities, raised no objections during the revision to avoid multiple names.According to news agency PTI, an Election Commission source said that the allegations by Rahul Gandhi were unfounded, and no appeals were filed against the electoral rolls in Haryana.""Why were no claims and objections raised by INC's BLAs during revision to avoid multiple names?"" the source said.Meanwhile, the chief electoral officer of Haryana shared some ""facts"" regarding the Haryana assembly elections held in October 2024.CEO Haryana, in a social media post on X, said that draft electoral rolls were shared with recognized political parties on August 2, 2024, and after a substantial number of claims and objections during the summary revision, more than 20,000 booth level officers were involved.After the final rolls was distributed on August 27, 2024, there were no appeals or second appeals filed against the decision, CEO added.Meanwhile, the poll body also claimed that only five complaints or objections were raised and no objections were recorded during the post-poll scrutiny.After the election results were declared on October 8, 2024, so far, 23 election petitions have been filed challenging the results highlighting an active post-election process and engagement with the electoral procedures.In a much-awaited press conference held at Congress headquarters in New Delhi, the leader of opposition in Lok Sabha, claimed poll irregularities in Haryana elections and alleged BJP of planning to convert Congress's victory. During the presser, Gandhi questioned the election commission and democratic process in country, saying that the future of Gen Z is being ""destroyed.""The Congress leader claimed theft of 25 lakh votes in Haryana, saying it includes 5.21 lakh duplicate voters, 93,174 invalid voters and 19.26 lakh bulk voters. He added thay one in eight voters on Haryana electoral list is fake.He also claimed that one person had 223 votes in two booths with same photo in Haryana and targeted EC, saying this is why the poll body destroys CCTV footage.""All (exit) polls pointed to a Congress victory (in Haryana). The other things that was surprising to us that for the first time in Haryana's electoral history ever, postal votes were different than the actual voting. This had never happened in Haryana before. So, we thought that let's go into details. When I first saw this information that you are going to see, I struggled to believe it. I was in shock. I told the team to cross-check multiple times,"" Rahul Gandi said in the press conference.He further played a video of Haryana chief minister Nayab Singh Saini, where he can be heard saying having a ""vyavastha"" while accusing BJP of having plans to ""convert Congress's landslide victory into a loss.""""I want the young people, GenZ of India to understand this clearly because this is about your future. I am questioning the EC, democractic process in India so I am doing it with 100% proof. We are pretty sure that a plan was put in motion to convert Congress' landslide victory into a loss. Please the notice the smile on his (CM Nayab Saini) face and notice the 'vyavastha' that he is talking about. This is 2 days after election when everybody is saying that the Congress is sweeping the elections,"" Rahul Gandhi said.During the presser, Gandhi also displayed a photo of a voter list, in which a picture of a lady occurred several times with different names and other key details. Rahul asked, ""Who is this lady? What is her name? Where does she come from?""He added, ""She votes 22 times in Haryana, at 10 different booths, and has multiple names: Seema, Sweety, Saraswati, Rashmi, Vilma.""Rahul claimed that the woman is not an Indian, but a ""Brazilian model."" ""That's a stock photograph and she is one of 25 lakh such records in Haryana,"" he added.","Election commission rejects rahul gandhi’s allegations against cec gyanesh kumar as baseless.

'Your Future Is Being Stolen': Rahul Gandhi's Bold Message to India's Gen Z For Democratic Change

NEW DELHI: Alleging that the 2024 Haryana assembly elections were stolen through manipulation of voters list by Election Commission in collusion with BJP, leader of opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday presented a deep dive on electoral rolls to claim that around 25 lakh fake voters, or 12.5% of the total 2 crore, participated in the state polls that Congress lost by 22,000 votes on eight seats and by 1.18 lakh votes in all.He also alleged, with a ""few testimonies"", that 3.5 lakh voters were purged from Haryana's electoral list and that most of them were Congress sympathisers, going on to predict that similar irregularities will take place in the Bihar polls.Accusing EC, BJP and PM Modi of destroying the foundations of India's democracy, Rahul urged Gen Z and the youth to understand the nature of election theft - and that BJP govts, including at the Centre, are not ""legitimate"" govts and it is Congress that had won the elections - and ""restore our democracy through truth and non-violence"".Calling his 'vote chori' expose ""H-files"" in place of the much-awaited ""H-bomb"", Rahul said the Haryana rolls had 19 lakh bulk voters, 5.21 lakh duplicate voters and 93,000 with invalid addresses. The misuse of Forms 6 and 7 would have likely added another 7-10 lakh fake voters but no proof could be provided for the same because EC has since the last press conference blocked access to the data on voter addition and deletion, he said.Citing ""documents"", Rahul created a flutter by showing a photograph of a registered voter that he said was actually of a Brazilian model, which was used to cast votes 22 times in 10 different booths under different names like Sweety, Saraswati, Seema and Vimla. He also came up with voter names which, he claimed, appeared 223 and 143 times in the rolls.""Why so many fake multiple voters? This is to create space so that fake voters can cast votes (in those places),"" he explained.""With this kind of corrupted voters' list, there is no chance of a fair election,"" Rahul said. Similar vote theft had occurred in Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra elections.In a significant statement, he said a similar presentation can be done for Bihar once data for polls in the state is out - a few persons from Bihar gave ""testimonies"" at his presentation that they were removed from the voters list and not added despite efforts. Rahul claimed anomalies are more difficult to spot because the voter lists are provided to parties on the last day. With poll outcomes hinging on a margin as little as 2-3%, there can be no fair election if 8-12% of the voters are fake, he said.","Congress leader rahul gandhi presented a deep dive on electoral rolls to claim that around 25 lakh fake voters participated in the state polls. He also alleged, with a ""few testimonies"", that 3.5 lakh voters were purged from haryana's electoral list.
