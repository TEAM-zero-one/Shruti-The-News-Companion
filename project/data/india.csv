NEW DELHI: He was held at gunpoint and asked a chilling question: “Are you Hindu or Muslim?” He stayed silent, perhaps hoping silence could save him.

He described this as a deliberate attempt to alter the region’s identity and marginalise its indigenous population. “After abrogation of Articles 370 and 35A (in 2019), there is a gripping fear among the people of J&K about possible demographic change, about being unnumbered, and about outside people being added without their knowledge. It is about us, our land.”National Conference MP Ruhullah Mehdi recently objected to non-local tourists thronging J&K. “The tourism that is now happening... I won’t call it tourism... in my eyes, it is a cultural invasion, by purpose and by design,” he had said. Mehdi had warned that just like the anger of Kashmiris against their autonomy being taken away in 1953 led to the birth of militancy 40 years later, the events of 2019 are bound to result in an angry outburst at some point of time. “We have created a wound that will someday lead to a retaliatory outburst.”Both Parra and Mehdi were, however, quick to condemn the Pahalgam attack, saying that they stand united against terror.","The pahalgam attack came amid statements by senior j&k netas terming the growing arrivals of non-locals, including tourists, in the ut as a demographic and cultural “invasion.” national conference mp ruhullah mehdi recently objected to non-local tourists thronging j &k.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120567826,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1949705,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Kharge says not a time for partisan politics

NEW DELHI: Businessman Robert Vadra, husband of Congress MP Priyanka Gandhi, on Wednesday linked the Pahalgam terror attack to BJP government's Hindutva push in the country evoking a strong retort from the BJP. ""If you dissect this terrorist act that took place, if they (terrorists) are looking at people's identity, why are they doing this? Because there's a divide that has come about in our country with Hindus and Muslims ... and also christians. Looking at identities and then killing somebody, that's a message to the PM, because Muslims are feeling weakened. The minorities are feeling weakened,"" Robert Vadra said reacting to the Pahalgam terror attack in which 28 innocent people lost their lives.""Why are we having communal disharmony in our country. This will create divides. This will create these kinds of organisations feel that Hindus are making a problem for all the Muslims. We don't need that. You ask many Hindus and Muslims together, they help each other. In Covid, we saw they helped each other. They don't understand all these political ways of trying to infuse disorder to win elections,"" he added while clarifying that it was his personal view and he was not speaking on behalf of the Congress party or his family.The BJP was quick to slam Robert Vadra for offering cover to the terrorists instead of condemning them.""Shocking! Sonia Gandhi ’s son-in-law Robert Vadra shamelessly defends an act of terror, offering cover to the terrorists instead of condemning them. He doesn’t stop there, instead, shifts the blame onto India for the atrocities committed by Pakistani terrorists,"" BJP leader Amit Malviya posted on X.BJP leader Shehzad Poonawalla also slammed Vadra and said that his reactions were at the behest of the Gandhis.""This is the most shameful, atrocious utterance done by the Congress party, Robert Vadra at the behest of Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi, in a sense to defend the Pakistani terrorists - to give them a clean chit to whitewash this crime of Islamic Jihad and to blame Hindus and to justify the terror,"" Shehzad Poonawalla said.BJP national spokesperson Nalin Kohli condemned Vadra's remarks, accusing him of speaking the language of the terrorists and justifying their barbaric actions.""Robert Vadra's remarks are completely condemnable. This is the same language that terrorists always use to justify their terrorism. It's clear from Robert Vadra's remarks that he wants to do politics on such a gruesome terror attack when the entire country is united against it,"" Kohli said, demanding an apology from Vadra.The BJP spokesperson said Vadra's remarks raise questions about whether the party is playing the politics of double standards.""What kind of justice is he seeking for the victims who the terrorists had shot dead after asking about their religion. The Congress should immediately issue a clarification. Robert Vadra should apologise,” he said.Vadra, meanwhile, went on to claim that he was questioned by the Enforcement Directorate in the land deal case because he had spoken in favour of the minorities.""Two weeks before, I was summoned by the ED. I had spoken in favour of the minorities. I said when you stop Muslims from doing prayers on roads or roofs of their homes or doing survey of temples under mosques or talk about Aurganjeb and Babur, it will create trouble, he said.And while Vadra put the blame on the BJP government, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge advocated for collective resolve and opposed partisan politics.""This is not a time for partisan politics. It is a moment for collective resolve to ensure justice for those who lost their lives and for their grieving families, by bringing the perpetrators of this terror attack to justice,"" Kharge said.""We also expect the government to hold discussions with all political parties to address the challenge of terrorism in a spirit of consensus once the necessary actions have been taken and full information has been obtained. They should call an All-Party meeting and take some advice.

Jharkhand HC yet to deliver verdicts reserved 3 years ago,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jharkhand-hc-yet-to-deliver-verdicts-reserved-3-years-ago/articleshow/120565962.cms,"NEW DELHI: Constitutional courts fix deadlines for everyone, including the President, but no such limitation applies to them for pronouncing judgments. Four murder convicts moved Supreme Court on Wednesday alleging that Jharkhand HC has not delivered verdicts in their appeals even though decisions were reserved three years ago.Appearing for the four appellants incarcerated for 16 to 11 years, advocate Fauzia Shakil informed a bench of Justices Surya Kant and N Kotiswar Singh that they had filed appeals, one in 2012, two in 2014 and one in 2018, and Jharkhand HC had reserved verdicts in their cases in the months of Jan, April, May and June of 2022. Despite lapse of three years, verdicts are yet to be pronounced, she said.The bench took serious view of the lapse and issued notice to Jharkhand HC registrar general, asking him to furnish in 10 days details about the pending appeals, the judges who had heard the appeals and the years for which judgments have been reserved.SC can rectify or take remedial measures when HCs reserve verdicts for an unusually long period of time but could it do anything when a judgment gets reserved for months together by an SC bench?

The judgment is yet to be pronounced, and Justice Oka is scheduled to retire on May 24.Shakil urged the Justice Kant-led bench that as the appellants had served more than a decade in prison, the court could use its discretionary powers to enlarge them on bail. The bench also issued notice to Jharkhand govt and sought its response on bail plea .The first petitioner, 72-year-old Pila Pahan, was arrested on Jan 9, 2009, in a murder case and was awarded life imprisonment upon conviction in 2012. He has undergone more than 16 years of incarceration and the HC verdict on his 13-year-old appeal is yet to be delivered.Satyanarayan Sahu was arrested in April 2011 in a murder case and was awarded a life sentence in Aug 2014. His appeal against conviction is pending in HC for the last 11 years, and he has already undergone more than 13 years of imprisonment.The third petitioner, Soma Bading, was convicted in a 2010 murder case in 2014 and his appeal has been pending in the HC for the last 11 years. In total he has been imprisoned for over 14 years. The fourth petitioner, Dharmeshwar Oraon, was convicted in a 2013 rape case in 2018, and his appeal is pending for last seven years in the HC. He has been imprisoned for the last nearly 12 years.The petition came as a shock to Justice Kant, who as head of the SC Legal Services Committee had recently taken a countrywide initiative in coordination with national, state and district legal services authorities to provide legal aid to every prisoner whose cases are being delayed in trial courts or for those who are not able to put forth their bail plea before the courts.","Four murder convicts moved supreme court on wednesday alleging that jharkhand hc has not delivered verdicts in their appeals even though decisions were reserved three years ago.
