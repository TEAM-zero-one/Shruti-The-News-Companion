NEW DELHI: Violence broke out in Nagpur’s Hansapuri area as unidentified individuals vandalized shops, set vehicles on fire, and hurled stones, following an earlier clash in the Mahal area that had already escalated tensions in the city, according to reports.The unrest intensified after rumours circulated about the burning of a religious book, triggering widespread stone-pelting, vandalism, and arson.Mahal and Hansapuri were the worst-affected areas, with vehicles torched and shops damaged by unidentified attackers. The violence erupted just two kilometres from the RSS headquarters, heightening security concerns.To control the situation, Nagpur Police imposed prohibitory measures under Section 163 of the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita and enforced Section 144, which bans large gatherings. A curfew has been imposed in several areas. The police are reviewing CCTV footage to identify others involved.At least 10 anti-riot commandos, two senior police officers, and two firemen sustained serious injuries during the violence, while a constable remains in critical condition in the hospital.Mobs set fire to two bulldozers and 40 vehicles, including police vans, as security forces faced challenges in controlling the situation. In response, police launched a large-scale crackdown, arresting 50 rioters, while the ministry of home affairs (MHA) sought a report on the unrest.Nagpur gears up for PM Modi's expected visit amid unrestAs Nagpur deals with recent violence, the city is preparing for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's expected visit on March 30. This will be his first public appearance alongside RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat since starting his third term.Nagpur Police Commissioner Ravinder Singal assured residents that the situation is now under control and urged them not to believe in rumours. ""We have imposed Section 144, and everyone has been told not to step out unnecessarily or take the law into their own hands. Do not believe rumors. Except for this area, the entire city is peaceful,"" he said.Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis called for peace, highlighting Nagpur's history of communal harmony. ""Nagpur is a peaceful city where people share in each other's joys and sorrows. Do not believe any rumors,"" he said.Meanwhile, Congress leader Pawan Khera attacked the BJP-led state government, blaming it for failing to maintain law and order and accusing political parties of fuelling tensions.""If the VHP and Bajrang Dal organized a protest demanding the removal of Aurangzeb's tomb, did the government make no arrangements to maintain law and order?"" he questioned.Security forces are conducting searches to arrest those responsible for the violence. Authorities have asked people to remain calm, avoid unnecessary travel, and not spread misinformation. The situation is being closely monitored to prevent further disturbances.The unrest also sparked a political row in the Maharashtra Assembly . State Congress chief Harshvardhan Sapkal compared CM to Mughal ruler Aurangzeb, calling him a cruel ruler. His remarks led to an uproar in the ongoing Budget session, with Mahayuti leaders demanding legal action against him.The Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP) and Bajrang Dal held a demonstration in Nagpur on Monday, demanding the removal of Mughal emperor Aurangzeb's grave in Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar. Right-wing activists gathered at the statue of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj in the Mahal area, chanting slogans and burning an effigy of Aurangzeb.This controversy over Aurangzeb has also been fuelled by the newly released Vicky Kaushal-starrer film Chhava , which portrays the conflict between Maratha ruler Chhatrapati Sambhaji and Aurangzeb after Chhatrapati Shivaji's death.The issue ties into a larger historical shift, as Aurangabad was officially renamed Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar in June 2022 to honor Sambhaji Bhosale, the second Chhatrapati of the Maratha Empire.","Violence broke out in nagpur’s hansapuri area as unidentified individuals vandalized shops, set vehicles on fire, and hurled stones.

"Telangana assembly passes 2 bills to up backward classes quota to 42%, total reservation to 70%",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/telangana-assembly-passes-2-bills-to-up-backward-class-quota-to-42-total-reservation-to-70/articleshow/119139009.cms,"T’gana banks on door-to-door survey data to build quota case



HYDERABAD : An eight-hour reservation debate in the Telangana assembly on Monday culminated in the passage of two landmark bills that aim to extend the quantum of reservation in education , govt jobs and rural and urban self-governance from 50% to 70%, breaching Supreme Court’s cap on quotas.CM A Revanth Reddy showcased political unanimity in passing the bills – BRS, BJP, AIMIM and CPI backed the move – as a sign that the state’s reservation framework deserved to be enshrined with a constitutional amendment during the ongoing session of Parliament.The first of the proposed laws — Telangana Backward Classes, Scheduled Castes & Scheduled Tribes (reservation of seats and appointments) Bill 2025 — proposes a 42% quota for BCs, 18% for SCs and 10% for STs, up from the existing 29% for BCs, 15% for SCs and 6% for STs.Telangana Backward Classes (reservation of seats in rural and urban local bodies) Bill 2025 extends the 42% BC quota to rural and urban local bodies. Before this, BC reservation in local bodies ranged from 18% to 23%, depending on population of each municipality or panchayat.Revanth put his hand up to lead an all-party delegation to PM Modi and other senior MPs to press for the proposed constitutional amendment. He said empirical data from a door-to-door survey by state govt would drive this amendment. The data, which includes information on BCs, SCs, and STs, is being presented as a bulletproof argument for exceeding the 50% cap on reservations, a step Supreme Court had indicated could be considered if the numbers backed it.Speaker Gaddam Prasad Kumar said the initial plan was to earmark 15% for SCs, which was increased to 18% based on a suggestion by AIMIM’s Akbaruddin Owaisi. But the House rejected three amendments proposed by BRS. These called for a 42% quota for BCs in all govt contracts, creation of a BC subplan similar to those for SCs and STs, and a Rs 20,000-crore allocation for BC welfare in the upcoming budget.Revanth, along with deputy CM Bhatti Vikramarka and BC welfare minister Ponnam Prabhakar, expressed confidence that a constitutional amendment was a matter of time. Prabhakar urged all political parties to set aside their differences to institutionalise the 42% BC quota, drawing inspiration from Tamil Nadu’s success in securing similar reservation for them through bipartisan support.The assembly also discussed Telangana Scheduled Castes (rationalisation of reservations) Bill, which deals with the sub-classification of SCs. It will be debated on Tuesday before being sent to the governor for approval. Supreme Court has empowered states to sub-classify SCs.Revanth informed the House that the erstwhile BRS govt had sent a proposal to Centre for 37% BC reservation. He said Congress govt would withdraw that proposal and send a new one for 42% reservation as the two proposals couldn’t coexist.","Two landmark bills aim to extend quantum of reservation in education, govt jobs and rural and urban self-governance from 50% to 70%. Telangana backward classes, scheduled castes & scheduled tribes (reservation of seats and appointments) bill 2025 proposes a 42% quota for bcs.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119139014,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-66918,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
"Gujjar brothers’ deaths rock J&K assembly: NC legislators join oppn in protest, demand fair probe",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/gujjar-brothers-deaths-rock-jk-assembly-nc-legislators-join-oppn-in-protest-demand-fair-probe/articleshow/119137595.cms,"SRINAGAR: Mysterious deaths of two tribal Gujjar brothers, whose bodies were recovered days apart recently after a month of disappearance, rocked J&K assembly Monday.Opposition legislators and those of governing National Conference (NC), many waving placards, sought an inquiry into the “suspicious deaths”. Unlike in other states, the Omar Abdullah-led NC govt does not control J&K police, who are under the Centre-appointed lieutenant-governor (LG) Manoj Sinha in the Union Territory.The MLAs also pressed for action against cops for allegedly beating up protesting women mourners after the second body was found in a decomposed condition Sunday in a river in J&K’s Kulgam district . The other had been found nearby on March 13.Showkat Ahmad Bajad and brother Riyaz had been missing since Feb 13. There is still no trace of Mukhtar Ahmad Awan village, a relative of the brothers who had accompanied them to a wedding in the Mir Bazar area of the same district the day all three went missing. The three worked in a brick kiln.“It seems part of the pattern,” People’s Democratic Party (PDP) legislator Waheed Parra said on Monday. He alleged several such unexplained deaths in J&K in the past few months within the nomadic Gujjar community. Parra cited another youth’s suicide after alleged police torture in Kathua last month as well as the latest deaths in Kulgam, saying all should probed as they were tied to one specific community.NC MLAs Nazir Gurazi and Qaisar Jamsheed Lone expressed concern over the situation in J&K deteriorating to an extent where people just vanished and their bodies were found days and weeks later. Deputy CM Surinder Choudhary of NC pressed for a fair investigation into the Kulgam deaths.On Monday, local authorities did not allow PDP’s Iltija Mufti to visit Kulgam. PDP member Talib Hussain, who was at the site when Showkat’s body was found on Sunday, had accused police of baton-charging mourners when they questioned how investigators had arrived at suicide as the cause of death.Back in the assembly, Sajad Lone, People’s Conference MLA from Handwara, flagged the alleged police atrocities, calling images of a police officer kicking female relatives of the deceased brothers “utterly disdainful”. “The whole action reeks of contempt within the minds of those who are supposed to protect masses. It is almost a daily occurrence,” Lone said. J&K police said they had ordered an inquiry into the officer’s conduct.Investigators said the brothers may have died by suicide. This was based on conclusions of a forensic expert, Dr Azia Manzoor Bhat, that Riyaz’s body indicated he had drowned and the case “doesn’t look homicidal in nature”.On Feb 6, a week before the Kulgam brothers went missing, 25-year-old tribal Makhan Din died by suicide alleging torture by police in Kathua district. He recorded a video before his death claiming cops were forcing him into confessing links with militants.",Showkat ahmad bajad and brother riyaz had been missing since feb 13.

NAGPUR: Violent clashes broke out in central Nagpur late Monday after protests demanding the removal of Mughal emperor Aurangzeb's tomb in Khultabad spiralled into chaos, leaving dozens wounded and causing widespread destruction.At least 10 anti-riot commandos, two senior police officers, and two firemen suffered serious wounds in the unrest, while a constable remains in critical condition in hospital. Mobs torched two bulldozers and 40 vehicles, including police vans, as security forces struggled to contain the violence. Police launched a large-scale crackdown, arresting 50 rioters, while the MHA sought a report on the unrest - just two weeks before PM Modi's expected visit to Nagpur. The violence erupted following rumours that protesters from a particular community had burned effigies of Aurangzeb & a religious chadar near Shivaji Putla Square at Mahal Gate - barely 2km from the RSS headquarters.Reports of violence triggered a swift response from another community, with large crowds gathering to demand action against those responsible. The protests escalated into stone-throwing, arson and clashes with police. Officials said misinformation spread via social media played a major role in fuelling the violence.Security forces used riot-control vehicles, including water cannons and tear gas units, to disperse mobs. DCPs Archit Chandak and Niketan Kadam were wounded while attempting to control the crowds. Firefighters were also caught in the crossfire as they tried to extinguish burning vehicles.

Key roads were sealed off. Reinforcements and intelligence teams worked to prevent further escalation. However, sporadic stone-throwing continued into the night.Police deployed surveillance teams with CCTV-equipped vehicles and public address systems to monitor the situation and issue warnings. Authorities also activated local peace committees, urging community leaders to intervene and defuse tensions.Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis and Union minister Nitin Gadkari appealed for calm.

'Independence of CAG inbuilt': Supreme Court on petition for new appointment method,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/independence-of-cag-inbuilt-supreme-court-on-petition-for-new-appointment-method/articleshow/119137051.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court Monday sought govt's response to a PIL seeking an ""independent and transparent"" procedure for appointment of CAG on the lines of the one the court had devised for CVC, but not before asking, ""When Constitution provides for unbridled power to executive to appoint CAG, should we rewrite that provision?""""Constitution says once appointed as CAG, the person enjoys constitutional protection from arbitrary removal by executive as he/she can be removed only through a removal motion in Parliament,"" Justice Surya Kant said. ""The provisions have ensured CAG's independence,"" the bench also comprising Justice N Kotiswar Singh said.Prolific PIL litigant ' Centre for Public Interest Litigation ', through advocate Prashant Bhushan, told SC that though CAG was considered independent and impartial in the past, it had lost its stature because of the drop in number of audits it conducted of Centre and states governed by the party in office at Centre.Justice Kant, however, did not seem to fully agree with the contention about erosion of the federal auditor's autonomy. ""We seem to have a great misconception about independence,"" he said.Bhushan said even for selection and appointment of SC judges, CVC and CEC, there were mechanisms provided to ensure their independence, yet SC thought it fit to lay down guidelines providing for a high-level panel, including leader of opposition and CJI, for their selection to ensure that these sensitive posts are manned by persons of impeccable integrity and enjoy independence while discharging their duties.When Bhushan said architect of the Constitution, Dr B R Ambedkar, had envisaged greater independence for CAG than SC, the bench pointed out that the Constituent Assembly had debated the viewpoint but majority did not agree with it. ""The issues and questions you raise about selection and appointment of CAG were squarely answered during the Constituent Assembly debates,"" Justice Kant said.The bench said there was already a PIL by one Anupam Kulshreshtha pending in SC on the same issue raised by Bhushan, who said though notice was issued a year ago, it was not listed for hearing again. Though the Constitution leaves it to the executive to appoint judges of SC and HCs in consultation with the CJI, SC in two judgments in the 1990s wrested the judge selection process to itself.In the Vineet Narain judgment, SC had given statutory status to Central Vigilance Commission and set up a CVC selection committee comprising the PM, home minister and leader of opposition. CVC, home secretary and secretary (personnel) were mandated to select and recommend the person for CBI director post, which would have a minimum tenure of two years. A similar mechanism was laid down for appointment of ED director.In 2023, SC had detected a vacuum in the law for appointment of CEC and ruled that CEC and ECs would be selected by a panel comprising PM, CJI and LoP. However, it also said it was for Parliament to decide the constitution of the collegium.","Supreme court seeks govt's response to a pil seeking an ""independent and transparent"" procedure for appointment of cag.

Even as Mahayuti legislatures demanded action against Sapkal for his remarks against the CM, the state Congress chief remained firm on Monday, saying: ""BJP leaders themselves compared CM Fadnavis to the cruel Aurangzeb.""Sapkal had said in Beed on Sunday, ""Aurangzeb was a cruel ruler. Today, CM Devendra Fadnavis is an equally cruel ruler. He always supports issues related to religion but does nothing about cases like the murder of (Massajog) sarpanch Santosh Deshmukh.""Deputy CM Ajit Pawar told the assembly that Sapkal's remarks would be investigated. ""Certain comments are made to please party seniors and grab eyeballs. But their (opposition's) vote share gets decreased and their true colours are seen.

Maharashtra Congress chief slams government



NEW DELHI: Tension arose in central Nagpur on Monday when stones were thrown at police following some rumours, leading to injuries to four people, news agency PTI said quoting officials.Police used tear gas shells and lathi charge to disperse the crowd in Chitnis Park and Mahal areas of the city. Violence later spread to Kotwali and Ganeshpeth, officials added.Also read: Violent clashes erupt in Nagpur, vehicles torched; cops deployed Officials said that the Chitnis Park to Shukrawari Talao road belt was the most affected, where some four-wheelers were set on fire. Stones were also thrown at houses. Police are trying to control the crowds, which are believed to be in large numbers.The situation escalated after Bajrang Dal members held a demonstration near the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj statue in Mahal, news agency PTI reported. An official said that stones were thrown at police personnel in Chitnis Park and Mahal, leading to the use of tear gas shells.A senior police official confirmed that security had been increased in sensitive areas. Quick Response Teams (QRT), Riot Control Police, and the State Reserve Police Force (SRPF) were deployed. Additional police personnel from different stations were also called in.Nagpur Police Commissioner Ravinder Singal said that section 144 has been imposed in the area. ""The situation is peaceful right now. A photo was burned following which people gathered, they made a request and we even took action in this respect. They had even come to my office to meet me. They were told that an FIR has been lodged based on the names they mentioned and action would be taken against them. This incident occurred around 8-8.30 pm. Not many vehicles have been torched. We are taking an assessment of the same. Two vehicles have been torched and stone pelting has occurred. Police is undertaking combing action and those involved are being identified and arrested. We have imposed Section 144 and everyone has been told to not step out unnecessarily or take law in their hands. Do not believe rumours. Except this area, the entire city is peaceful...""The Maharashtra chief minister said, ""The manner in which the situation became tense in Mahal area of Nagpur is highly condemnable. A few people pelted stones, even at the Police. This is wrong. I am keeping an eye on the situation. I have told the Police Commissioner to take whatever strict steps are necessary to maintain law and order. If someone riots or pelts stones at Police or creates tensions in society, strict action should be taken against all such people. I appeal to everyone to behave to ensure that the peace of Nagpur is not disturbed. If someone attempts to create tension, very strict action will be taken against them.""Union Minister and Nagpur MP Nitin Gadkari also urged people to remain calm. ""Due to certain rumors, a situation of religious tension has arisen in Nagpur. The city's history is known for maintaining peace in such matters. I urge all my brothers not to believe in any kind of rumours and to maintain peace. Do not come out onto the streets. Cooperate with the law and order system. Preserve the tradition of peace and harmony that Nagpur is known for. I assure you all that the government will take action against those who have committed mistakes or engaged in illegal activities. The Chief Minister has already been informed about this situation, so I request everyone not to pay attention to rumours. Please cooperate with the police administration, foster love, and maintain a positive atmosphere in the city. This is my humble request to all of you.""Meanwhile, Maharashtra Congress chief Harshvardhan Sapkal blamed Monday's violence in Nagpur on the failure of the state home department. He also accused ministers of ""deliberately making provocative speeches"" in recent days.""Tensions in the city, stone pelting and arson is the utter failure of the home department. In the last few days, state ministers have been deliberately making provocative speeches to incite violence in the society. It looks like those efforts have found success in Nagpur,"" he said in a statement.","Tear gas shells and lathi charge used to disperse crowd in chitnis park and mahal areas of the city.

2025 assembly elections: Is Nitish Kumar preparing for 'son'rise in Bihar?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/2025-assembly-elections-is-nitish-kumar-preparing-for-sonrise-in-bihar/articleshow/119122438.cms,"In January this year, Nitish made a public appearance with his son at a political function. At this function, Nishant made his first political remark as he sought votes for his father in the upcoming assembly elections. Nishant also highlighted why JD(U)needed more seats to ensure that Nitish Kumar's leadership continues for the progress and development of the state.

Holi festivities at Nitish Kumar's residence this year saw Nishant participating actively and engaging with senior JD(U) leaders.

Then appeared a large hoarding outside the Janata Dal (United) office in Patna featuring son Nishant alongside his father. The poster, which prominently displayed Nishant Kumar next to Nitish Kumar, read, "" Bihar ki maang, sun liye Nishant, bahut bahut dhanyawaad "" (Nishant, thank you very much for listening to the demands of Bihar).

JD(U) at crossroads? Why Nitish needs Nishant

NEW DELHI: Is Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar , who has been a very strong critic of political dynasts, preparing ground for his son Nishant Kumar 's plunge into politics? For years, dynasty politics has been one of the strongest weapons used by Nitish to attack his rival Lalu Prasad, who promoted his wife, sons and daughters in politics.But now, there are very strong indications that Nitish may lose that poll plank in the year-end assembly elections. Nishant, who has stayed away from the political glare for nearly two decades, may finally enter mainstream politics to lend a helping hand to his father, who has been under opposition fire over health issues.Here's a look at some of the recent developments that have led to these speculations ...Clearly, more than the demand of Bihar, it is the demand of a section of JD(U) leaders who are perhaps worried over the consistent opposition attacks questioning the health of Nitish Kumar. They believe Nishant's involvement could strengthen the party and carry forward Nitish Kumar's political legacy.Neither Nishant nor the JD(U) has made any official statement on this. However, in January, when Nishant was asked about his possible political plunge, this is what he said: ""The public will decide what happens next. Let them judge who is capable.""A clever statement that was not just politically correct but also open ended to ensure the chatter around his poltiical plunge continues.Nitish Kumar's present ally - the BJP, which has used dynasty politics as one of its most potent weapons to attack the opposition, was guarded in its response to the possibility of a new 'son'rise in the state. Bihar deputy chief minister and BJP leader Samrat Choudhary has already said that his party will back whatever decision JD(U) takes on Nitish Kumar's son. The other allies of JD(U) have also been guarded in their response while welcoming Nishant if he decided to join politics.Interestingly, it was opposition RJD's Tejashwi who perhaps made the strongest call to Nishant to join politics.""He is our brother. I want him to join politics as soon as possible; otherwise, the BJP will finish the JD(U)--the party formed by Sharad Yadav. He should join politics soon. If he joins politics, then there would be the possibility that JD(U) will survive. It will depend on how Nishant works for the party. We joined politics not because our parents asked us to do it but because the people of Bihar and our party workers needed that,"" Tejashwi had said reacting to rumours of Nishant joining politics.It is natural for Tejashwi, who has been at the receiving end of relentless dynast attacks - both from Nitish and the BJP, to welcome the development.With Tejashwi and Chirag, son of late Ram Vilas Paswan, already in active politics, if and when Nishant decides to take the plunge, it would complete the troika of three second generation leaders in Bihar politics - following into the footsteps of their fathers.The JD(U), which has been dominant in state politics for nearly 20 decades, faced perhaps its biggest challenge in the last assembly elections when the party was reduced to being the junior partner in the NDA for the first time.Nitish could manage to win just 45 seats compared to BJP's 74. However, the BJP kept its pre-poll promise of forming a government under Nitish Kumar's leadership and the JD(U) chief was back as chief minister despite reduced numerical strength.Nitish Kumar did salvage some pride when JD(U) won 14 seats, same as the BJP, in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. The number enough to make a hero out of Nitish Kumar for providing valuable support to Prime Minister Narendra Modi led NDA-3 government.However, as the assembly elections approach once again, Nitish would be worried about his party's political fortunes. With Nishant to assist him in managing the party, Nitish would be more focussed on trying to restore the lost political glory of JD(U).For over two decades, JD(U) has literally been a one-man show, both at the state and at the national level. Till now, keeping the family away from the party was the USP of Nitish, but with the party's declining fortunes and his advancing age, the Bihar chief minister perhaps may not have that option anymore.While Nitish is yet to open up on the issue, he has not stopped his ministers and party leaders from raising the pitch for Nishant. Perhaps, the Bihar chief minister is testing the waters for now.","Nishant kumar has stayed away from the political glare for nearly two decades. He may finally enter mainstream politics to lend a helping hand to his father. Nishant's involvement could strengthen the party and carry forward nitish kumar's legacy.

NEW DELHI: Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis on Monday said it is ""unfortunate"" that the government has to protect Aurangzeb's grave, which is located in the Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar district.Fadnavis's remark came amid growing demand from a certain section to remove the Mughal emperor's grave.""It is unfortunate that the government has to take responsibility for the protection of Aurangzeb's grave, despite his history of persecution. However, I assure you, if any attempt is made to glorify his legacy through '', it will not succeed,"" Fadnavis said at an event that he attended to inaugurate a temple dedicated to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj in the Thane district and lauded the Maratha king for fighting for '' and the country.""We are able to worship our gods freely today because of Shivaji Maharaj's efforts. He fought for Swarajya, for God, for our country, and our religion,"" Fadnavis was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.Earlier, BJP's Satara MP Udayanraje Bhosale, who is also the descendent of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, advocated for the removal of the Mughal king's tomb situated in Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar.Responding to Bhosale's request, Fadnavis clarified that despite sharing similar sentiments, actions must conform to legal procedures due to the site's protected status, which was established during the previous Congress administration.Fadnavis said, ""We all also want the same thing, but you need to do it within the framework of the law, because it is a protected site. The site was put under ASI's (Archaeological Survey of India) protection during the Congress regime some years back.""The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) protects historical tombs under the AMASR Act, 1958, ensuring their preservation. If a tomb is declared a protected monument, no construction is allowed within 100 meters, and activities in the 200-meter regulated area need approval. The ASI oversees conservation and prevents alterations or damage.Section 19(1) of the Act clearly states that no person, including government authorities, can destroy, remove, alter, or deface a protected monument without official permission.Further strengthening these protections, the AMASR (Amendment) Act, 2010, imposes strict penalties and imprisonment for unauthorised construction, alteration, or destruction of a protected monument. This means that even a state government cannot make changes to an ASI-protected tomb.Violating these rules leads to legal action, fines, or imprisonment. Unauthorized encroachments are removed, and restoration must maintain the tomb’s original character.Aurangzeb was the sixth ruler of the Mughal Empire, reigning from 1658 to 1707. He was the son of Emperor Shah Jahan and is known for expanding the Mughal Empire to its greatest territorial extent, covering almost the entire Indian subcontinent.Unlike his predecessors, Aurangzeb followed a more orthodox Islamic rule, enforcing religious policies that included the reintroduction of the jizya tax on non-Muslims and restrictions on certain cultural practices.Aurangzeb and Sambhaji Maharaj were fierce adversaries in the late 17th century. Sambhaji, the son of Chhatrapati Shivaji, was the second ruler of the Maratha Empire, while Aurangzeb was the Mughal emperor who sought to crush the Marathas and expand Mughal rule in the Deccan. Their rivalry intensified after Sambhaji ascended the throne in 1681 and continued his father’s resistance against Mughal domination.In 1689, Aurangzeb's forces captured Sambhaji near Sangameshwar through treachery. He was brutally tortured for refusing to convert to Islam and executed in an inhumane manner.His martyrdom made him a symbol of Maratha defiance, strengthening the Maratha resistance against Mughal rule. Sambhaji’s death fueled the eventual decline of Mughal power in the Deccan.","Devendra fadnavis said it is ""unfortunate"" that the government has to protect aurangzeb's grave.

Background of the case

NEW DELHI: The bail plea of Kannada actress Ranya Rao, who is currently in judicial custody over her alleged involvement in a high-profile gold smuggling case , has been adjourned to March 19.The Sessions Court, which was set to hear her petition on March 17, has directed the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) to file its objections by the next hearing. Further proceedings will continue once the objections are submitted.Ranya Rao had earlier filed a bail application before the Special Court for Economic Offences, which was rejected due to the serious nature of the allegations against her.Following this, her legal team moved to the Sessions Court in an attempt to secure her release.The case has attracted widespread attention due to its scale and the alleged involvement of influential individuals.Ranya Rao was arrested on March 3, 2025, at Bengaluru’s Kempegowda International Airport after DRI officials intercepted her carrying gold bars worth Rs 12.56 crore . Investigations revealed that she had travelled to Dubai 27 times since January 2025. A subsequent search at her residence led to the discovery of additional gold jewellery valued at Rs 2.06 crore and Rs 2.67 crore in cash.The case took a dramatic turn when it emerged that Ranya allegedly used a State Police Protocol Officer to bypass security checks at the airport. She is the stepdaughter of Karnataka Director General of Police (DGP) Ramchandra Rao, raising concerns over potential police involvement.However, the DGP has distanced himself from the controversy, stating that he had no knowledge of her alleged activities and had been estranged from her since her marriage.Ranya has claimed that she was assaulted and forced to sign documents by DRI officials, allegations that have intensified the legal battle. Meanwhile, BJP MLA Basangouda Patil Yatnal has alleged the involvement of state ministers in the smuggling network, promising to expose them in the Karnataka Assembly.Adding to the complexity, the Karnataka High Court has extended its interim order preventing the DRI from taking immediate action against Ranya's husband, Jatin Vijaykumar Hukkeri, who has also been detained in connection with the case.The court has granted the DRI additional time to file its objections.","Ranya rao was arrested on march 3, 2025, at bengaluru’s kempegowda international airport.

Denying bail in less serious offences unfortunate: Supreme Court,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/denying-bail-in-less-serious-offences-unfortunate-supreme-court/articleshow/119135920.cms,"Twenty years ago, bail cases did not even reach HCs: Supreme Court



NEW DELHI: Expressing concern over courts denying bail in not very serious cases despite probe being completed, Supreme Court on Monday said it is unfortunate that relief is not being granted in such cases and the apex court has to intervene.A bench of Justices Abhay S Oka and Ujjal Bhuyan said that 20 years ago, bail plea in such cases did not even reach HCs. It is shocking that the apex court is adjudicating such cases and it is flooded with such petitions, it said.SC has repeatedly flagged the issue and appealed to trial courts and HCs to be liberal in granting bail, particularly in not serious and petty offences. It had earlier expressed anguish over ""intellectual dishonesty"" by lower courts & HCs in continuously denying bail to accused in cases involving ordinary infractions, despite its various orders exhorting them to be liberal in granting bail when custody is not needed.While granting bail to an accused who had been in custody for over two years in a cheating case, the bench said, ""It is unfortunate that bail matters in cases triable by magistrate come to SC for bail... We are sorry to say that people are not getting bail... It is unfortunate"". SC noted that the bail plea of the accused was rejected by a trial court and Gujarat HC, despite probe in the case completed and a chargesheet filed.Flagging the issue of SC being flooded by bail petitions as accused were coming to it for the relief, the bench said, ""It is shocking that SC has to deal with such cases. Twenty years ago, such cases did not come to HCs but now it is SC, which is deciding such cases.""Observing that in a democracy there was no place for a police state where probe agencies can arrest people unnecessarily and in a mechanical way, SC in 2022 put a curb on agencies from arresting people in cognisable offences punishable up to 7 years' jail term, where custody is not needed, & had asked criminal courts to protect the liberty of people and be liberal in granting bail.It held that the accused, who was not arrested during probe and had cooperated in the investigation, should not be taken into custody after chargesheet had been filed. It had also appealed to Centre to frame a new law to streamline the process of granting bail, saying there was ""pressing need"" for it, and ruled that regular bail application of an accused had to be decided normally within two weeks and anticipatory bail within six weeks.""Courts tend to think that the possibility of a conviction being nearer to rarity, bail applications will have to be decided strictly, contrary to legal principles,"" court had said.","Twenty years ago, bail cases did not even reach hcs: supreme court.

HYDERABAD: An eight-hour reservation debate in the Telangana assembly on Monday culminated in the passage of two landmark bills that aim to extend the quantum of reservation in education , govt jobs and rural and urban self-governance from 50% to 70%, breaching Supreme Court's cap on quotas.CM A Revanth Reddy showcased political unanimity in passing the bills - BRS, BJP, AIMIM and CPI backed the move - as a sign that the state's reservation framework deserved to be enshrined with a constitutional amendment during the ongoing session of Parliament.The first of the proposed laws - Telangana Backward Classes, Scheduled Castes & Scheduled Tribes (reservation of seats and appointments) Bill 2025 - proposes a 42% quota for BCs, 18% for SCs and 10% for STs, up from the existing 29% for BCs, 15% for SCs and 6% for STs.Telangana Backward Classes (reservation of seats in rural and urban local bodies) Bill 2025 extends the 42% BC quota to rural and urban local bodies. Before this, BC reservation in local bodies ranged from 18% to 23%, depending on population of each municipality or panchayat.Revanth put his hand up to lead an all-party delegation to PM Modi and other senior MPs to press for the proposed constitutional amendment. He said empirical data from a door-to-door survey by state govt would drive this amendment. The data, which includes information on BCs, SCs, and STs, is being presented as a bulletproof argument for exceeding the 50% cap on reservations, a step Supreme Court had indicated could be considered if the numbers backed it.Speaker Gaddam Prasad Kumar said the initial plan was to earmark 15% for SCs, which was increased to 18% based on a suggestion by AIMIM's Akbaruddin Owaisi. But the House rejected three amendments proposed by BRS. These called for a 42% quota for BCs in all govt contracts, creation of a BC sub-plan similar to those for SCs and STs, and a Rs 20,000-crore allocation for BC welfare in the upcoming budget.Revanth, along with deputy CM Bhatti Vikramarka and BC welfare minister Ponnam Prabhakar, expressed confidence that a constitutional amendment was a matter of time. Prabhakar urged all political parties to set aside their differences to institutionalise the 42% BC quota, drawing inspiration from Tamil Nadu's success in securing similar reservation for them through bipartisan support.The assembly also discussed Telangana Scheduled Castes (rationalisation of reservations) Bill, which deals with the sub-classification of SCs. It will be debated on Tuesday before being sent to the governor for approval. Supreme Court has empowered states to sub-classify SCs.Revanth informed the House that the erstwhile BRS govt had sent a proposal to Centre for 37% BC reservation. He said Congress govt would withdraw that proposal and send a new one for 42% reservation as the two proposals couldn't coexist.","T'gana banks on door-to-door survey data to build quota case.

""We seem to have a great misconception about independence,"" he said.Bhushan said even for selection and appointment of SC judges, CVC and CEC, there were mechanisms provided to ensure their independence, yet SC thought it fit to lay down guidelines providing for a high-level panel, including leader of opposition and CJI, for their selection to ensure that these sensitive posts are manned by persons of impeccable integrity and enjoy independence while discharging their duties.When Bhushan said architect of the Constitution, Dr B R Ambedkar, had envisaged greater independence for CAG than SC, the bench pointed out that the Constituent Assembly had debated the viewpoint but majority did not agree with it. ""The issues and questions you raise about selection and appointment of CAG were squarely answered during the Constituent Assembly debates ,"" Justice Kant said.The bench said there was already a PIL by one Anupam Kulshreshtha pending in SC on the same issue raised by Bhushan, who said though notice was issued a year ago, it was not listed for hearing again. Though the Constitution leaves it to the executive to appoint judges of SC and HCs in consultation with the CJI, SC in two judgments in the 1990s wrested the judge selection process to itself.In the Vineet Narain judgment, SC had given statutory status to Central Vigilance Commission and set up a CVC selection committee comprising the PM, home minister and leader of opposition. CVC, home secretary and secretary (personnel) were mandated to select and recommend the person for CBI director post, which would have a minimum tenure of two years.

NAGPUR: Violent clashes broke out in central Nagpur late Monday after protests demanding the removal of Mughal emperor Aurangzeb's tomb in Khultabad spiralled into chaos, leaving dozens wounded and causing widespread destruction.At least 10 anti-riot commandos, two senior police officers, and two firemen suffered serious wounds in the unrest, while a constable remains in critical condition in hospital. Mobs torched two bulldozers and 40 vehicles, including police vans, as security forces struggled to contain the violence. Police launched a large-scale crackdown, arresting 50 rioters, while the MHA sought a report on the unrest - just two weeks before PM Modi's expected visit to Nagpur. The violence erupted following rumours that protesters from a particular community had burned effigies of Aurangzeb & a religious chadar near Shivaji Putla Square at Mahal Gate - barely 2km from the RSS headquarters.Reports of violence triggered a swift response from another community, with large crowds gathering to demand action against those responsible. The protests escalated into stone-throwing, arson and clashes with police. Officials said misinformation spread via social media played a major role in fuelling the violence.Security forces used riot-control vehicles, including water cannons and tear gas units, to disperse mobs. DCPs Archit Chandak and Niketan Kadam were wounded while attempting to control the crowds. Firefighters were also caught in the crossfire as they tried to extinguish burning vehicles. Several neighbourhoods remained tense as sporadic violence continued.Nagpur police commissioner Ravinder Singal deployed more than 1,000 officers and imposed prohibitory orders in Mahal, Chitnis Park Chowk and Bhaldarpura, restricting movement in the most sensitive areas. Key roads were sealed off. Reinforcements and intelligence teams worked to prevent further escalation. However, sporadic stone-throwing continued into the night.Police deployed surveillance teams with CCTV-equipped vehicles and public address systems to monitor the situation and issue warnings. Authorities also activated local peace committees, urging community leaders to intervene and defuse tensions.Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis and Union minister Nitin Gadkari appealed for calm. ""Nagpur has always been a peaceful city where people coexist in harmony. I urge citizens not to believe rumours and cooperate with law enforcement,"" Fadnavis said. Nagpur guardian minister Chandrashekar Bawankule visited the affected areas.Central Nagpur MLA Pravin Datke alleged that ""outsiders"" were brought in to incite violence. ""We have instructed police to identify and take strict action against those responsible,"" he said in Mumbai. In Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar district, where Aurangzeb's tomb is located, VHP and Bajrang Dal staged protests. Protesters warned of the tomb's demolition if govt failed to act.VHP hinted at escalating their agitation across Marathwada and other districts if demands are not met.","Violent clashes broke out in central nagpur late monday after protests demanding removal of mughal emperor aurangzeb's tomb.

MUMBAI: Indicating a tighter scrutiny of Mahayuti government's flagship Mukhya Mantri Majhi Ladki Bahin Yojana , deputy CM Ajit Pawar, who also holds the finance portfolio, on Monday admitted in the state assembly that beneficiaries who were financially well-off also received the stipend, and now the scheme will be ""corrected"" to only cover poor women.""In hurry and confusion, some sisters with a good economic condition got included in the list. The scheme is meant only for women from poor families,"" said Ajit. ""Sometimes, once a scheme is introduced, it needs corrections. We will be making corrections. But we will not take back the money from those who received it.""He pointed out that even PM Narendra Modi appealed to the public to exit central schemes if they no longer fit the criteria. He emphasised that the scheme would not be shut down. ""We will provide enough funds for the scheme & poor women will 100% receive the money,"" he added.He also confirmed reports that a portion of over 40% hike in the annual plan for SCs and STs outlay in the annual plan would be used for Ladki Bahin scheme. Social justice minister Sanjay Shirsat alleged that nearly Rs 10,000 crore from the social justice and tribal welfare department was diverted to Ladki Bahin scheme. ""In the annual plan, allocation for SC component has risen 42% and tribal component by 40%. Even after excluding Ladki Bahin outlay, the rise is 18% and 19%,"" Ajit told the assembly.He further said Ladki Bahin scheme could be linked to loan programmes given the enormous quantum of Rs 45,000 crore that it placed in the hands of women.""The Mumbai bank, led by BJP MLC Pravin Darekar, has already announced that those who open their Ladki Bahin accounts there will be eligible for a loan of Rs 10,000 to Rs 25,000,"" the deputy CM said.He defended government's Rs 9.3 lakh crore debt and revenue deficit of Rs 45,892 crore, by saying this was within the fiscal limit. ""Only Maharashtra, Odisha, and Gujarat have managed to keep these parameters within the fiscal limit,"" he said. He said the fiscal deficit was less than 3% of GSDP and the loan was less than 25% of GSDP. RBI's risk analysis concluded that Maharashtra had healthy fiscal indicators, he added.He further said government focused on infrastructure schemes, like Wadhawan port project where it was considering building an airport. ""Some countries have built an airport in the sea. Such ideas are worth considering if it does not impact the environment.""","Ajit pawar admitted in the state assembly that beneficiaries who were financially well-off also received the stipend.
