VADODRA: Writings by PM Narendra Modi and Hindutva ideologue V D Savarkar have been introduced at Maharaja Sayajirao University (MSU) in a new BA (English) minor course launched under National Education Policy-2020, reports Prashant Rupera.Department of English at MSU’s faculty of arts has added ‘Jyotipunj’ by Modi and ‘Inside the Enemy Camp’ by Savarkar to the new course titled, Analysing and Understanding Non-Fictional Writings on Bharat. The course has been implemented from the current academic year (2025-26).The syllabus also includes selected writings by Sri Aurobindo and Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay, texts by Swami Vivekananda, and selected episodes from the PM’s radio address, ‘Mann Ki Baat’.“This syllabus represents a deliberate academic intervention to align English studies with India’s national priorities. It pioneers a confident Indian approach where English is used to study Bharat’s own thinkers, leaders, and ideas, rather than remaining confined to colonial or Eurocentric canons. In that sense, the course operationalises PM’s call for decolonisation of education by embedding Indian intellectual traditions within mainstream university curricula,” said Prof Hitesh D Raviya, head of English department and chairperson of Board of Studies in English Language and Literature at MSU.University officials said the course aims to examine Indian non-fictional writings within the framework of English literary studies.",Writings by pm narendra modi and hindutva ideologue v d savarkar have been introduced at maharaja sayajirao university (msu) in a new ba (english) minor course.

Bengaluru Headlines Today — The Biggest Updates You Need to Know.

BENGALURU: What began as a tattoo of ""another woman"" on the husband's forearm ended in the murder of his wife and a sentence of life imprisonment for him.Earlier this week, a city court convicted 33-year-old Vinay Kumar, a resident of A Narayanapura in Mahadevapura, of killing his wife Ashwini D, 29, inside their home in April 2021. Since his arrest, Kumar had remained lodged in Bengaluru Central Prison at Parappana Agrahara, with his attempt to secure bail failing.Kumar and Ashwini, an engineer and his younger sister's classmate, met at a family wedding, fell in love, and married in 2018. But the marriage began to unravel three years later when Kumar returned home with a tattoo reading ""Roopa"" inked on his right forearm. When Ashwini questioned him about the tattoo and demanded to know who Roopa was, Kumar gave evasive answers. She later discovered that he was having an affair.According to the prosecution, Kumar feared she might take legal or personal action against him. Unwilling to end the relationship with Roopa, he decided to eliminate his wife.Public prosecutor Satyavati HR told TOI the murder was planned carefully. On the night of April 16, 2021, Kumar purchased a can of beer and a strip of 10 sleeping tablets before returning home.After having chicken biryani for dinner, he forced Ashwini to drink the beer, secretly mixed with the tablets. She soon slipped into a deep sleep. Kumar believed the overdose would be fatal. When he found Ashwini still breathing early the next morning, Kumar strangled her using her dupatta.""Afterwards, he stepped out of the house and raised the alarm, claiming his wife was lying motionless,"" Satyavati said. With a neighbour's help, he took Ashwini to a nearby hospital, where doctors declared her brought dead. Kumar initially managed to convince Ashwini's parents and relatives that it was a natural death. However, Mahadevapura police ordered an autopsy, while viscera samples were sent to the Forensic Science Laboratory.The autopsy revealed the death was due to strangulation, leading to Kumar's arrest. Subsequent FSL reports confirmed the presence of alcohol and sleeping tablets in Ashwini's system.During the trial, circumstantial evidence sealed Kumar's fate. Testimonies from a wine shop cashier and a medical store assistant, backed by CCTV footage, established that Kumar had purchased the beer and sleeping tablets on the night of the murder.After police filed the charge-sheet, Kumar filed his bail application. Police, however, discovered that the surety documents submitted were fake and informed the court that his family had distanced themselves from him after the crime. The bail plea was rejected, forcing him to spend time in prison.","Vinay kumar, 33, convicted of killing his wife ashwini d, 29, inside their home in april 2021.

'Delhi NOT Most Polluted': Doctor's Shocking Reveal On Toxic Monster; And How To Fight Back

NEW DELHI: Delhi continued to struggle with toxic air on Sunday, with several areas recording ‘very poor’ and ‘severe’ air quality levels, as a dense layer of smog blanketed the city.The overall Air Quality Index (AQI) in Delhi on Sunday reached 391, entering the 'severe' category, with some regions exceeding 400, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).Morning visuals from Akshardham Temple showed the iconic structure fading into a thick, dense layer of smog that drastically reduced visibility.The AQI (Air Quality Index) in the area stood at 445, placing it in the ‘severe’ category, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).Around AIIMS, the AQI was measured at 340, categorised as ‘very poor’. Meanwhile, visuals from the ITO area showed the city shrouded in a thick blanket of smog, with hazy conditions reducing visibility.The AQI there had crossed 400, also falling under the ‘severe’ category.Meanwhile, in Mumbai, a light layer of fog enveloped the Bandra Kurla Complex, where the AQI was measured at 123, classified as ‘moderate’.Authorities have invoked Stage III measures under the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP), which include restrictions on construction and industrial activities.The ‘No PUC, No Fuel’ rule is being enforced to curb emissions.Officials attributed the worsening conditions to a combination of cold weather, calm winds, and dense fog that trap pollutants close to the ground. Experts warn that the cycle of poor air quality is expected to continue under current weather patterns.The Commission for Air Quality Management has advised vulnerable groups, including children, the elderly, and people with respiratory issues, to limit prolonged outdoor exposure and wear masks.","The overall air quality index (aqi) in delhi on sunday reached 391, entering the'severe' category, with some regions exceeding 400.

'Tragic that patriotic people of northeast are referred to as Chinese and attacked'

DEHRADUN: A 24-year-old MBA student from Tripura, who confronted a group of men hurling racial slurs at him and his younger brother, died in a Dehradun hospital on Friday after fighting for his life for over 14 days. The stabbing happened on Dec 9, minutes after Anjel Chakma said, ""We are not Chinese... We are Indians. What certificate should we show to prove that?"" The six men allegedly responded with brutal violence.What began as a regular grocery run to the local market in the Selaqui area of Uttarakhand's capital city turned into a fatal confrontation that evening.Anjel and his brother Michael, both students in Dehradun for over a year, were stopped and taunted by a group of men who allegedly referred to them in derogatory terms. When Anjel calmly stood his ground, the situation turned uglier.Michael would later tell police and friends how his brother calmly but firmly corrected them. That assertion, of identity and dignity, was met with knives. ""Soon after Anjel replied, they attacked him and his brother while hurling abuses,"" said a friend of Anjel's, who remained at the hospital through the two weeks that followed. ""Anjel suffered serious injuries to his neck and spine.Michael is also injured and still in a serious condition. ""The friend requested anonymity, but his voice carried anger and disbelief. ""He was one of the calmest, friendliest people. We're all broken by what happened."" Anjel's body was flown to Agartala on Saturday, as Tripura erupted in anger. His family was assisted by Pradyot Bikram Manikya Debbarma, chairman of Tipra Motha Party and a member of the erstwhile Tripura royal family, who had been in touch with the family since the day of the incident and had supported his medical treatment.Speaking to TOI, Debbarma said on Saturday, ""It's tragic that the patriotic people of the northeast are called Chinese and attacked. Those who hurl racist slurs forget that it is because of the brave people of the northeast that China cannot enter the country. These incidents don't just hurt families. They divide our people. And when we are divided, we are vulnerable. We don't want that. We want justice.""Suraj Debbarma, state president of Youth Tipra Federation, the youth wing of Tipra Motha, who helped coordinate Anjel's last rites, said: ""People from the northeast face racial slurs and xenophobic attacks in the north regularly. But when students from north Indian states come to central institutions in the northeast, they are welcomed like fellow countrymen. We lost an innocent soul in a hate crime. That's the tragedy. ""Police said the case was registered on Dec 12 on a complaint filed by Michael Chakma, 21. Five of the six accused - including two juveniles - were apprehended on Dec 14.Senior sub-inspector Jitendra Kumar of Selaqui police station said on Sunday, ""Yagya Awasthi, the main accused, is suspected to have fled to Nepal... Two police teams have been dispatched to track him down and nab him, and a reward of Rs 25,000 has been announced. After Anjel's death, we added additional BNS sections - 103(1) (murder) and 3(5) (committing crime with common intention).""Initially, the FIR was filed under BNS sections 115(2) (voluntarily causing hurt), 118 (voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons), and 351(3) (criminal intimidation). On Dec 14, based on doctors' statements, sections 109 (attempt to murder) and 61 (criminal conspiracy) were added.The charges were upgraded again after Anjel's death.

Delhi-NCR witnessed severely reduced visibility late Sunday night and early Monday as a dense blanket of smog engulfed the region.Visuals from several parts of the region, including AIIMS flyover and Noida’s Sector 37 showed vehicles struggling through a haze of toxic smog, highlighting the severity of the pollution.The blow is twofold, as the city grapples with cold winter temperatures alongside rising pollution levels.The Meteorological Department has issued an orange alert for very dense fog on Monday, warning commuters of restricted visibility on major roads.Indira Gandhi International Airport (IGI) issued a passenger advisory as dense fog blanketed the national capital. Airport authorities announced that flight operations are being conducted under CAT III (Category III) conditions—an advanced instrument landing system that allows specially trained pilots and equipped aircraft to land in low-visibility environments (typically below 200–300 meters).The advisory reads, ""Flight operations are currently being conducted under CAT III conditions due to dense fog, which may result in delays and cancellations. Our ground teams are actively assisting passengers to ensure smooth travel. We sincerely regret for any inconvenience caused"".Due to dense fog at Delhi Airport, an Air India Express flight traveling from Goa’s Manohar International Airport (Mopa) to New Delhi was diverted to Ahmedabad in the early hours of Monday.The flight, which departed at 11:55 pm, was scheduled to land at Indira Gandhi International Airport (IGI) Terminal 1 at 2:35 am.IndiGo also issued a travel advisory on Monday morning, December 29, 2025, warning that Delhi and Hindon (Ghaziabad) airports remain ""wrapped in chilly winter air and lingering fog.""The airline noted that fluctuating visibility has led to changes in flight schedules and cautioned that operations may be slower than usual as ground teams prioritize safety and compliance with visibility requirements.Maximum and minimum temperatures are expected around 22°C and 7°C, respectively, with Sunday night’s minimum dipping to 6.3°C, slightly below the seasonal average.The city’s air quality slipped into the “very poor” category, with several areas, including Anand Vihar, recording hazardous AQI levels above 400. Authorities advised residents, especially children, the elderly, and those with respiratory issues, to stay indoors.Under Stage III of the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP), officials have imposed curbs on construction and industrial activity, while enforcing the ‘No PUC, No Fuel’ rule to control vehicular emissions.Experts have cautioned that poor air quality will likely continue under the prevailing weather conditions.","Delhi-ncr witnesses severely reduced visibility late sunday night and early monday as a dense blanket of smog engulfed the region.

"On the roof of the world, feral dogs hunt down Ladakh’s rare species",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ladkah-on-the-roof-of-the-world-feral-dogs-hunt-down-ladakhs-rare-species/articleshow/126218554.cms,"Lean, feral dogs move with predatory intensity across a snow-dusted desert, Ladakh's stark peaks looming behind.

SRINAGAR: It’s bloody murder on the roof of the world.A new predator has quietly grown to dangerous numbers. Feral dogs roam the cold desert of Ladakh, preying, often in packs, on endangered wildlife and attacking people. Conservationists warn that they outnumber native predators in the region.What began as a byproduct of increased tourism, military deployment, and unmanaged waste in the cold desert moonscape of Ladakh has grown into a full-blown crisis. And it’s manmade.Scientists and wildlife officials warn that these free-ranging canines — estimated by the WCBCL at nearly 45,000, far in excess of what the region’s ecology can sustain — are preying on some of Ladakh’s rarest high-altitude species. They threaten snow leopards, wolves and foxes, and prey on rare species like Pallas’s cat, the Eurasian lynx, Tibetan gazelle, blue sheep, ibex, and Himalayan marmots, said Lobzang Visuddha, chairman of the Wildlife Conservation and Birds Club of Ladakh (WCBCL), a community-based voluntary initiative by young people.The killing of a Pallas’s cat, one of the rarest and least-studied species, by feral dogs in Anley last year has alarmed conservationists like Visuddha. “In fact, there are records of killing two Pallas’s cats and Eurasian lynxes by feral dogs,” he saidThe dogs also threaten ground-nesting birds, with packs frequently chasing black-necked cranes, the UT’s state bird, and attacking ruddy shelduck chicks when they move from rocky nesting sites to nearby water bodies, Visuddha said.Advocate Tashi Gyalson, who headed the local government in Leh as chairman of the Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Council from Nov 2020 to Nov 2025, said the issue hasn't been arisen all of a sudden. “We have to admit that this situation has actually been created by humans over a long period of time,” he said.Gyalson said these dogs have been part of the ecosystem and community but rapid urbanisation meant they lost their use as hunting dogs, shepherd dogs, watchdogs and companion animals. “This, multiplied by the abundant carrying capacity of the environment, caused their rapid multiplication, and eventually caused the current situation,” he said.Experts say the worst hit is eastern Ladakh, the region with the highest concentration of wildlife, where poor waste management are subsidising the dog population.“The main concern is the availability of excess kitchen waste in areas occupied by the Army and areas where there is tourism,” Gyalson said.The stretch from Kargyan Chibra to Tsokar, in eastern Ladakh, has become a hotspot for feral dog activity due to unsustainable waste “Feral dogs are by far the most serious threat as far as the wildlife of Ladakh is concerned. I have myself seen how stray dogs in Hanle and Tso Moriri actually raided the nests of the black-necked crane, and preyed upon the eggs and young ones,” said Intesar Suhail, who was wildlife warden of Ladakh in 2013-14.“I have even seen them chasing animals as big as the Tibetan wild ass. The active ground nests of waterbirds, particularly the black-necked crane and bar-headed goose, are more vulnerable as they are located in marshy areas, surrounded by shallow waters easily accessible to dogs,” he said.A strong sense of smell and pack behaviour give feral dogs a lethal advantage over wildlife that evolved without such human-introduced predators, Visuddha said.“Though these species face natural threats in the wild, feral dogs are not one of them, they are a problem introduced by humans,” said the WCBCL founder.Ladakh has also reported at least five fatal attacks on humans, mostly on women and children, by feral dogs, which was unheard of in the region until recently, he said.Phuntsog Wangail, president of the Chamba Animal Welfare Society, which runs Ladakh’s largest animal care facility, said Ladakh was facing growing fears of long-term ecological imbalance due to feral dogs.They survive largely on food waste from tourist camps, hotels, roadside dhabas and temporary settlements. When these facilities close or relocate, particularly during winter, the canines are left without reliable food sources and begin roaming over long distances.“This seasonal movement pushes dogs into wildlife habitats, increases territorial conflicts, and accelerates breeding, placing Ladakh’s fragile ecosystem under severe pressure,” Wangail said.Visuddha said the feral dog threat to wildlife of Ladakh was next only to human activity.The rapid infrastructure expansion, including road building, power lines and mobile towers, has already fragmented habitats, while the expansion of camps, resorts, guest houses and hotels has intensified pressure on wildlife, he said.In winter, when tourism grinds to a halt and food becomes scarce, the dogs roam extensively, leading to a rise in dog-bite cases, road accidents and formation of aggressive packs. “At the same time, winter offers the best window for sterilisation, as dogs tend to remain closer to human settlements.”Data from the Animal Husbandry Department in Leh shows that 32,887 dogs were sterilised between 2015 and 2024, yet officials and conservationists say the population remains dangerously high.Wangial said Ladakh should carry out mass sterilisation over the next two years, with a special focus on female dogs and puppies, while calling for strict enforcement of animal welfare laws, including heavy penalties for dog dislocation, abandonment and cruelty.He called for the replication of successful models from the Netherlands and Bhutan, where mass sterilisation, strict enforcement of animal welfare laws and strong community participation have led to significant reductions in stray populations.While Visuddha said govt appears unconcerned about the issue, Gyalson offered a contrasting view. He said that after Ladakh became a Union Territory in 2019, a mission-mode campaign was launched to control the dog population. “The impact of the programme is visible as there are far fewer street puppies, especially in Leh city,” he said.However, Gyalson said several challenges continue to hinder effective population control, including Ladakh’s vast and rugged terrain, extreme climate, dispersed dog population, difficulties in capturing animals, and the absence of an accurate census.","Scientists and wildlife officials warn that these free-ranging canines are preying on some of ladakh’s rarest high-altitude species. They threaten snow leopards, wolves and foxes, and prey on rare species like pallas's cat.

NEW DELHI: Congress MP Shashi Tharoor on Sunday offered a measured response to senior party leader Digvijaya Singh ’s praise for the organisational strength of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), remarks that triggered sharp reactions within the Congress and handed the BJP a fresh line of attack.“We have a history of 140 years, and we can learn a lot from it. We can learn from ourselves, too,"" the Thiruvananthapuram MP said.""There should be discipline in our organisation. Digvijaya Singh can speak for himself,"" he further added.Calling Digvijaya Singh a “friend”, Tharoor, when asked whether he had spoken to Singh since his remarks ruffled feathers within the Congress, said: “We are friends, and having a conversation is natural. The organisation must be strengthened, there is no question about it.”Tharoor's remarks came on the party’s 140th Foundation Day, which Tharoor described as “a very important day for the party” and “a day when we look back at our remarkable history and the contribution of Congress.”On Saturday, the Congress Working Committee (CWC) meeting convened to finalise programmes to corner the government over the VB-G RAM G Act, was overshadowed by internal disquiet after Singh’s social media post praising the RSS-BJP’s organisational structure.Singh had shared a 1990s photograph showing a young Narendra Modi seated on the floor while senior BJP leaders, including L K Advani, sat on chairs, calling it “very impressive” and describing PM Modi’s rise as the “strength of organisation”.At the CWC meeting, Singh reportedly criticised “over-centralisation” within Congress and pushed for decentralisation.The BJP seized on Singh’s comments. Spokesman Sudhanshu Trivedi said the BJP recognises a “gudri ke laal” like PM Modi, while Congress focuses on “Jawahar ke laal”.Singh later clarified that his remarks had been misunderstood. “I was, am and will be a trenchant critic of the RSS and Modi,” he said. He reiterated, “I am opposed to the ideology of the RSS… But I admire their organisational capacity.”Meanwhile, Congress media department chairman Pawan Khera drew a sharp line, saying, “There’s nothing to learn from the RSS. What can an organisation known for Godse teach an organisation founded by Gandhi?”Party MP Manickam Tagore shared a clip of an “excellent” own goal in football, writing, ""Famous Self goal. We have one.""He later added, ""There is nothing to learn from Godse's organisation other than Hate. Congress at 140 is still young, and fights hate.""","Shashi tharoor says congress needs discipline, not lessons from the rss.

'Power of the organisation'

BJP attacks Rahul Gandhi

NEW DELHI: Congress on Sunday stopped short of agreeing with its senior leader Digvijay Singh after he gave example of Rashtriya Swayamseva Sangh ( RSS ) to call for organisational reforms within Congress.Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera, reacting to former Madhya Pradesh chief minister's remarks said that an organisation known for Godse can not teach anything to a organisation founded by Gandhi.""There's nothing to learn from the RSS. What can an organisation known for Godse teach an organisation founded by Gandhi?"" Khera said.Earlier on Saturday Digvijay praised the organisational strength of RSS and shared a black-and-white photograph from a social media platform that showed Prime Minister Narendra Modi seated back on the ground while BJP veteran Lal Krishna Advani sat on a chair in the background, acknowledging how the RSS shapes leadership within the organisation.""I found this image on the Quora site. It’s very impressive. How an RSS grassroots swayamsevak and Jan Sangh BJP worker sat on the floor at the feet of leaders and became the state’s Chief Minister and the country’s Prime Minister. This is the power of the organisation.""However, he issued a clarification, saying, ""I've been saying this from the beginning: I am opposed to the ideology of the RSS. They neither respect the Constitution nor the country's laws, and it's an unregistered organisation.""""But I admire their organisational capacity because an organisation that isn't even registered has become so powerful that the Prime Minister says from the Red Fort that it is the world's largest NGO. If it's an NGO, then where have your rules and regulations gone? But I admire their organisational capacity,"" he added.Earlier this week, Singh had also praised Rahul Gandhi for his stance on socio-economic issues, giving him ""full marks"" while calling for internal reforms within the Congress. Drawing a parallel with Rahul Gandhi’s push for Election Commission reforms, Singh argued that the party itself needed similar changes.In another post on X, he wrote, ""Rahul ji you are absolutely ‘Bang On’ in matters of Socio-Economic Issues. Full Marks. But now please look at Congress also. Like Election Commission needs Reforms, So Does Indian National Congress. You have started with 'संघटन सृजन' But we need more Pragmatic Decentralised Functioning.""He added, ""I am sure you would do it because I know you can do it. Only problem is that it is not easy to ‘Convince’ you!!""Meanwhile, BJP alleged that Digvijay's praise for the organisational power of the BJP and the RSS was an ""open dissent"" against Rahul Gandhi's leadership in the party.BJP national spokesperson Sudhanshu Trivedi alleged that Rahul was bringing his party ""upside down"" because he had been sidelined in the party.""It's because our Narendra Modi is 'guddri ke lal' (diamond in the rough) and their leader is 'Jawahar ke lal' (great-grandson of Jawaharlal Nehru). Since our Narendra Modi has risen to top from bottom, he is taking the party (BJP) also to the top from bottom,"" Trivedi told a press conference at the BJP headquarters here.In a swipe to Rahul, he said, ""Since their leader is 'Jawahar ke lal' who is now 'side down from up', he is bringing his party upside down.""This comes after the Congress held the CWC meet in Delhi on Saturday under the chaimanship of party chief Mallikarjun Kharge -- first after the party suffered a huge loss in Bihar assembly elections.After the CWC meet, Kharge announced that the grand-old-party launch a nation-wide protest against the Centre for replacing rural employment scheme - MGNREGA - with VB G-RAM-G law from January 5.""In the meeting, we took an oath. We decided to launch a massive movement across the country, making the MNREGA scheme the central point. Indian National Congress party, taking a leading role, will launch the Save MNREGA Campaign from January 5th,"" Kharge said.","Congress stops short of agreeing with its senior leader digvijay singh after he gave example of rashtriya swayamseva sangh ( rss ) to call for organisational reforms within congress.

‘Woman married 2nd time, not entitled to maintenance’

Heartbreak, divorce & deadly crimes | Dark Truth Of Failed Marriages | Ft. Anand Handa

MUMBAI: In an unexpected turn, a woman’s current husband took the witness stand to depose on behalf of her ex-spouse, ending a nearly 17-year-old domestic violence case.The case, initiated in 2009 by the woman, alleged years of torture by her first husband. She sought protection and monetary relief, claiming she was ousted from her home. However, a Borivli court ruled that with her current husband confirming marriage, she was not entitled to maintenance.Additional chief judicial magistrate B N Chikne said, “As such, in such facts and circumstances and the evidence on record, it appears to me that it is proved from the evidence and documents produced on record, after divorce from the respondent No. 1 (ex-husband), the applicant (woman) performed a second marriage. Therefore, she is not entitled to get maintenance from respondent No. 1.”The judgment centred on the revelation that the woman had entered into a second marriage while her original maintenance claim was still active.In her plea, the woman said she married her ex-husband in 2005 through an arranged setup. She alleged that she later found out that the man was already married and his first wife began to frequent their home.Along with the ex-husband, his first wife would abuse her too. She alleged numerous incidents of physical, emotional and economic abuse. In Dec 2009, the first husband was directed to pay the woman an interim monthly maintenance of Rs 3,200 until the disposal of the case.While the woman’s sister served as a witness to support her allegations, the man brought to court an imam who officiated the woman’s second marriage, a handwriting and fingerprint expert who testified on the signatures and thumb impression on the nikahnama of the second marriage, and her husband.The trajectory of the trial shifted dramatically when her ex-husband produced her current husband as a defence witness to confirm their marital status. By confirming the second marriage through the evidence of the current husband himself, the defence nullified the woman’s status as a dependent of her former spouse.The court ruled the existence of this second union, confirmed by the man who entered into it, extinguished the woman's right to seek further maintenance or protection from her first husband.","The case, initiated in 2009 by the woman, alleged years of torture by her first husband.

"Hair-loss drug under lens over threat to infants, eye disorders",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hair-loss-drug-under-lens-over-threat-to-infants-eye-disorders/articleshow/126195368.cms,"AI image

NEW DELHI: Minoxidil, a widely used over-the-counter drug to treat hair loss, has been linked to unintended exposure in infants & a large number of eye-related side effects, according to a global safety analysis that has flagged dozens of baby-related cases and more than 1,600 eye disorder reports worldwide.Researchers identified more than 45 reports of excessive hair growth in infants aged up to 23 months linked to exposure to minoxidil. In several cases, exposure was not due to direct application but occurred unintentionally within the household, including contact with caregivers or contaminated surfaces.Globally, the analysis found 2,664 suspected cases of excessive hair growth linked to minoxidil use during pregnancy. Among infant cases, maternal exposure accounted for 22.2%, accidental exposure for 44.4%, while the route of exposure was unclear in 33.3% of cases.Though no infant cases were reported from India, the authors of the study cautioned that this likely reflected under-reporting rather than absence of risk, given the drug's widespread use.The study also raised concerns about eye health. A total of 1,660 reports of eye-related adverse effects associated with minoxidil use were recorded globally, including 25 reports from India.Frequently reported problems included eyelid swelling and blurred vision.More serious eye conditions were also noted, including central serous chorioretinopathy. After removal of duplicate reports, four serious eye cases remained - three involving central serous chorioretinopathy and one case of retinal artery occlusion.The findings are based on a post-marketing safety analysis of adverse drug reports submitted to VigiBase, the global drug safety database maintained by WHO, covering data up to March 2025.The study was authored by Dr V Kalaiselvan and Dr Jaishree Suresh of the Indian Pharmacopoeia Commission, health ministry, and Dr Rohit Saxena of the Dr Rajendra Prasad Centre for Ophthalmic Sciences, AIIMS.Minoxidil was originally developed as an oral medicine to treat high blood pressure. Hair growth was later observed as a side effect, leading to its reformulation as a topical drug used to treat hair loss. Its effectiveness against androgenetic alopecia has since made it one of the most commonly used treatments worldwide.The authors warned easy over-the-counter availability, aggressive online promotion and limited counselling had allowed use to expand faster than safety awareness, particularly among pregnant women and households with infants.The study underlined that minoxidil was contraindicated during pregnancy and breastfeeding, but awareness of this warning remained low. With topical formulations commonly used at home, unintentional exposure through skin contact or household surfaces may place infants at risk.Calling for action, the authors recommended clearer warning labels, stricter oversight of over-the-counter sales and routine counselling by pharmacists and healthcare providers.Caregivers were advised to store products safely and avoid use around infants and pregnant women.While minoxidil continues to benefit adults using it to treat hair loss, the authors stressed public awareness and pharmacovigilance must keep pace with growing use to prevent avoidable adverse effects.","Minoxidil, a widely used over-the-counter drug to treat hair loss, has been linked to unintended exposure in infants & a large number of eye-related side effects.

NEW DELHI: The survivor of the 2017 Unnao rape case on Sunday said that she fears for the safety of her children after the Delhi high court suspended the life sentence of expelled BJP leader Kuldeep Singh Sengar.Reacting to the CBI’s petition before the apex court, the survivor told news agency ANI, “I have faith in the Supreme Court that it will give me justice. I am raising the voice of every women... Had CBI done this before, I would have got justice. His (Kuldeep Sengar) bail would have been rejected because he raped me. My father was killed. My family members were killed. The security of my family members and witnesses was removed. .. My husband was fired from his job. My children are unsafe at home.The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear the CBI’s plea on December 29. As per the cause list, a bench headed by Chief Justice Surya Kant, along with Justices J K Maheshwari and Augustine George Masih, will take up the matter. The court will also hear a separate petition filed by advocates Anjale Patel and Pooja Shilpkar challenging the high court’s order.On December 23, the Delhi high court suspended Sengar’s life sentence in the rape case, noting that he had already served seven years and five months in prison. The suspension will remain in force while his appeal against conviction is pending. The CBI moved the Supreme Court against the order on December 26.Sengar was convicted in December 2019 and sentenced to life imprisonment along with a fine of Rs 25 lakh. While the high court granted him bail in the rape case, he will continue to remain in jail as he is serving a separate 10-year sentence in a CBI case related to the custodial death of the survivor’s father. His appeal in that case, along with a plea seeking suspension of sentence, is also pending.The high court imposed several conditions while granting bail, including a personal bond of Rs 15 lakh with three sureties, a direction not to enter a 5-km radius of the survivor’s residence in Delhi, and a strict bar on threatening her or her mother.",Kuldeep singh sengar was convicted in december 2019 and sentenced to life imprisonment along with a fine of rs 25 lakh.

NEW DELHI: Sometimes judicial proceedings are too slow and protracted to deliver justice in one's lifetime.This is reflected in a case in which the three-tier judicial system took 34 years to decide the validity of an ITDC employee's job termination. The litigant passed away a year before the final word was spoken on the litigation by the apex court, which delivered a verdict in his favour.D K Sharma was terminated in 1991 and the litigation started from the labour court. It then went before a single bench of Rajasthan HC, whose order was challenged before a division bench and the proceedings culminated in the Supreme Court.The labour court had passed an order in his favour and directed his reinstatement with 100% back wages after the management failed to lead evidence to prove the charges against him. It, however, passed the order in 2015, almost a quarter of century after his job was terminated.Aggrieved by the order, ITDC moved HC whose single bench modified the order to the extent that back wages awarded by the labour court were reduced to 50%. But a division bench of HC set aside the order of his reinstatement as well as payment of back wages. Sharma thereafter moved SC in 2020 which now directed the hotel to give 50% of back wages.Sharma had died last year and the litigation was pursued by his legal heir.""Insofar as the claim of the appellant for full back wages is concerned, having regard to the fact that there was no specific statement before the labour court that the appellant was not gainfully employed elsewhere in the interregnum as also the fact that Hotel Ashoka has changed hands, taking into account the long period that has elapsed since termination till passing of the award, we are of the view that award of 50% of back wages as directed by learned Single Judge of HC shall meet the ends of justice,"" said a bench of Manoj Misra and Ujjal Bhuyan while allowing his appeal.Granting 50% back wages to his family, the court said he had filed an affidavit stating that he was not gainfully employed in the interregnum and there was no evidence placed before the court by the opposite party to rebut his claim.The top court said that the order of the single judge bench of the HC was just and proper as a workman who had served for long would not be able to get employment if one crosses the age bar.""No doubt, a person may do odd jobs to survive but that cannot be a ground to deny back wages, particularly when termination of his service is by way of punishment,"" it said.","D k sharma was terminated in 1991 and the litigation started from the labour court.
