Yes – They drive accountability and productivity No – They increase pressure and reduce flexibility





BENGALURU: TCS's updated associate deployment policy mandates employees to be billed for 225 days annually, restricting their bench time to a maximum of 35 business days each year. The policy aims to foster a proactive approach towards associate allocation, ensuring both organisational and individual goals are met.""At any given point in time, associates must be allocated for a minimum period of 225 business days in the last 12 months,"" the document reviewed by TOI showed. ""Long periods of remaining unallocated shall adversely impact associate compensation, career growth, avenues of overseas deployment in future, and continuity of employment with the organisation,"" it said. The new policy, which came into effect on June 12, was laid out by Chandrasekaran Ramkumar, global head of The Resource Management Group (RMG).RMG at TCS oversees workforce deployment, ensuring the right talent with the right skills is assigned to projects. This team focuses on maximising organisational utilisation by making sure every associate is optimally engaged and allocated to projects at all times.""In the event an associate is unallocated, it is the primary responsibility of the associate to proactively engage with the Unit / Regional RMG for seeking allocation and take initiative towards pursuing suitable opportunities provided by the organisation,"" the policy said.All associates who are released to RMG, available for the next assignment, and reporting to RMG are unallocated resources.TCS provides opportunities through platforms like iEvolve, Fresco Play, VLS, and LinkedIn. While unallocated, associates are expected to spend 4-6 hours daily on relevant learning via iEvolve, complete all mandatory and prioritised training, attend in-person sessions as recommended by RMG, and actively upskill to stay interview-ready. They should also use the Gen AI interview coach, review and address feedback from past interviews, and complete all training programmes on time with full attendance.To facilitate swift deployment, TCS has called out that physical presence in the office is mandatory. As a result, WFO exceptions and flexible work arrangements are generally not applicable. ""However, associates may request short-term flexible work options for personal emergencies in exceptional circumstances, subject to organisational policies and prior approval from the RMG.""TCS has stated that frequent short-term allocations to multiple projects are discouraged and may lead to HR investigations and appropriate disciplinary measures. An email sent to TCS on the policy didn't elicit a response till the time of going to the press.","Tcs's updated associate deployment policy mandates employees to be billed for 225 days annually.

Ahmedabad Plane Crash: Lucky seven who never boarded the ill-fated Air India Flight 171,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/ahmedabad-plane-crash-gut-feeling-gridlock-a-moms-plea-how-fate-stopped-7-from-taking-ai-171/articleshow/121854778.cms,"Air India Crash Probe Focuses On Engine, Flaps And Gear As Boeing 787 Fleet Faces Safety Checks





AHMEDABAD: Sometimes, destiny doesn't announce its warnings aloud. It just intervenes through mundane ways: a mother's emotional plea, traffic that refuses to clear or just a gut feeling that something isn't quite right.For seven passengers meant to board Air India Flight 171 on June 12, these subtle interventions became the difference between life and death.Yaman Vyas had his return journey to London all planned. The warehouse worker, who holds a UK work permit, was wrapping up a visit to his family in Vadodara after two years abroad. His bags were packed, documents ready and he was not expecting to return to India for at least another year.But as he prepared to seek his parents' blessings before departure, his mother was overcome with emotion. The thought of another lengthy separation seemed unbearable. ""Thhoda divas rokai jaa ne, beta (Just stay back for a few more days, son),"" she pleaded, her voice heavy with affection.His father supported her request. Overwhelmed by his mother's plea, he simply cancelled his flight, no questions asked. ""Later that afternoon, when messages about the crash started flooding my mobile, I realised how my mother's instinct had saved my life.""For Jaimin Patel, 29, and Priya Patel, 25, from Chandlodia in Ahmedabad, the journey to London was meant to be a happy reunion. Their friend Rohit Yadav had invited them for holidays, and they arrived at the airport with visitor visas, all excited about the trip.At the check-in counter, however, their plans hit a hurdle. The Air India staff informed them that queries had been raised regarding their documentation, which required resolution before boarding passes could be issued.Jaimin and Priya Patel told the staff that it was impossible to resolve the matter at such short notice and begged to be allowed on the flight. But the staff remained firm, saying they cannot violate the protocol.After waiting at the airport for an hour in mounting frustration, Jaimin and Priya returned home disappointed. ""About an hour later, one of my friends called and just said, ‘Switch on the TV right now!' When I saw the news, I was shocked,"" Jaimin said. ""The flight had crashed. I have never been so grateful to God. I thank the Air India staff for putting their foot down and not letting us board the plane.""Sometimes the heart knows what the mind cannot comprehend. That is exactly what Savji Timbadia, a Nikol resident, experienced. Everything had been arranged for his trip to London, where his son lives and works. He had seat 1-A reserved on AI 171. But early on Thursday morning, Timbadia made an unexpected call to his son, which puzzled both.""I told my son I did not feel like flying and would postpone my departure until Monday. When he asked about the sudden change of plan, I could only describe a feeling of mental unease. It was not something I could explain.""That afternoon, a friend sent him a message asking him to watch the news on TV. ""I got the answer to what made me feel uneasy,"" he said. ""Lord Swaminarayan saved my life.""Another passenger, who had a similarly lucky escape, was Bhoomi Chauhan. She had every reason to curse Ahmedabad's notorious traffic congestion enroute to the airport. The Bharuch native was to return to her husband in London after her vacation. Taking detours and navigating through traffic jams, when she reached the airport at 12.20pm, she was told that the boarding gates had closed at 12.10pm.""I pleaded with the staff to let me board the flight, but to no avail,"" she said. Angry and disappointed, she was returning to Bharuch when she learned about the crash. ""I was shocked and also grateful to the divine for saving me,"" she said. ""I was leaving my son in India. This was nothing but Ganpati Bappa's miracle.""Jayesh Thakkar from Vadodara has business obligations to thank for saving his life. The organizer of one of the biggest garba events in Vadodara, Thakkar was scheduled to be on that ill-fated flight but got delayed in Kolkata due to work.""I was delayed in Kolkata due to work and realized I would not make it to Ahmedabad in time for the flight. That is when I decided to change my itinerary,"" Thakkar said.Similarly, Ravji Patel decided against flying that day with his son-in-law Arjun Patoliya as he had work to be completed. Arjun was going back to his daughters in London after the post-death rituals of his wife, Bharti, whom he lost to cancer in May.""He insisted that I go with him and meet my granddaughters, aged 8 and 4. But I had some work to do and told him that I will fly down after a fortnight. He agreed to book the tickets for me,"" Ravji Patel said, still reeling under the shock of losing two loved ones in 20 days.","Yaman vyas had his return journey to london all planned.

SHILLONG/INDORE: Sonam Raghuvanshi, who is in custody for the murder of her husband, Raja, was taken to Meghalaya Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences on Monday for a mental health assessment and was found mentally sound in a psychiatric examination, police sources said.In Indore, Sonam’s brother Govind said he has been summoned for questioning by Shillong police. The couple from Indore were honeymooning in Sohra last month when Raja was murdered. Sonam and four other accused — all from outside Meghalaya — remain in police custody as investigations continue.Authorities plan to take the five suspects to Sohra on Tuesday to recreate the crime scene, police sources said. A local court had initially granted eight-day police remand on June 11 to facilitate further investigation.Police are likely to seek extension of custody. In Indore, over 2,200km away, the ‘tehrvi’ (13th-day death ritual) for Raja was held at his home on Monday, attended by only close family and relatives, including Govind. “Shillong police have called me for questioning. They said I need to give a statement and sign it,” he said.Raja’s other brother, Sachin, said that the family had prepared all of Raja’s favourite dishes for the ritual, including gulab jamun, Manchurian, noodles, dal-chawal, dry fruits, bananas, and papaya.“We are not organising it like a typical tehrvi for a natural death; only family members are participating,” Sachin added.The Raghuvanshi family continues to grapple with unanswered questions. “The same question keeps coming to our minds: why did Sonam got her husband murdered just days after their wedding?” said Sachin, wondering if anyone apart from the five accused was also involved. The family has demanded a narco analysis test of all five accused.","Sonam raghuvanshi, who is in custody for the murder of her husband, raja, was taken to meghalaya institute of mental health and neurosciences on monday for a mental health assessment.

Raju Patel, 56, didn't stop to think. When the sky fell, he stood up.Just minutes away, the construction businessman raced to the AI 171 crash site with his crew, arriving within five minutes of impact.

Nilambur bypoll is Congress’s semi-final in Kerala



Kaliganj heats up amid riot shadow



Ludhiana West Bypoll a Crucial Test for AAP, Congress, SAD and BJP



Gujarat gears up for bypolls in Visavadar and Kadi



NEW DELHI: Interest around assembly byelections is mostly limited to the states, more so, if the contest does not involve heavyweights. However, the assembly bypolls today for 5 seats spread across four states will be keenly watched when the results are out on June 23 - as this will be the first electoral contest post Pahalgam terror attack and Operation Sindoor - India's military response that included air and ground strikes on terror camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK).Today's bypolls include two assembly seats in Gujarat, one each in Kerala, West Bengal and Punjab. The fact that assembly elections are due in two of these states - Kerala and West Bengal early next year - makes this mini electoral contest all the more interesting.Congress, which has huge stakes in Kerala, has already announced that the Nilambur by-election is the semi-final before the 2026 assembly polls. Kerala LoP and Congress MLA VD Satheesan has claimed that victory in the bypoll will mark the beginning of the United Democratic Front's (UDF) return to the state.""This is a political contest, a direct fight between the UDF and the LDF. It is the semi-final leading up to the 2026 Assembly elections, and we are confident of winning by a significant margin. We see this as an opportunity to hold the Pinarayi government accountable, a government that has been in power for the past nine years,"" Satheesan said.Congress got a boost with Wayanad MP Priyanka Gandhi Vadra joining the campaign to secure a win for the party.Congress, which has lost two consecutive elections in the state to the Left Democratic Front, will be keen to settle scores and return to power. However, given party's choppy relations with Shashi Tharoor, who is MP from Thiruvananthpuram, and a resurgent BJP going all out to spread its influence in the state, the road to power will not be easy for the grand old party.Moving over to West Bengal - another state where assembly elections are due early next year, the Kaliganj assembly bypoll in the state's Nadia district is shaping up to be a triangular contest among the TMC, BJP, and Congress-Left alliance.The electoral discourse here in the run up to the bypoll has been dominated by identity politics, post-Murshidabad riot anxieties and a nationalist surge after Operation Sindoor.The bypoll is also being closely watched due to the recent Murshidabad riots in which three persons were killed and several people rendered homeless, discontent over the SSC recruitment scam, and the changing electoral arithmetic since the 2024 general elections.In Kaliganj, identity and legacy remain central to the electoral battle. While the TMC has accused the BJP of communal polarisation, the Murshidabad riots and sporadic communal skirmishes in parts of the state have only added fuel to the saffron party's campaign in its bid to break the Trinamool Congress stronghold on this minority-dominated seat.The Ludhiana West by-election, set to take place on Thursday, is shaping up to be a high-stakes political showdown that could redefine the urban political narrative in Punjab. While the seat itself is just one among many, the implications of this bypoll stretch far beyond its borders.For the ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), the contest is a crucial opportunity to reaffirm its dominance in Punjab following the death of its sitting MLA, Gurpreet Bassi Gogi, in January. Retaining the seat would help AAP maintain its urban clout and narrative of continuity.Facing off against AAP is the Congress, looking to claw back a constituency it once firmly held—six times in the past. A win here would signal a revival of urban support for the party, which has struggled to reclaim lost ground in the state since AAP’s rise.However, the contest isn’t only a two-way battle. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is also keenly watching the outcome to assess its urban appeal in Punjab, a state where it remains on the fringes post its breakup with the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD).For the SAD, the stakes are equally high. The bypoll is being viewed as a test of leadership for party president Sukhbir Singh Badal, whose party is still trying to bounce back from a string of electoral defeats. A respectable showing here could breathe some life into the party’s flagging morale.By-elections in Gujarat’s Visavadar and Kadi assembly constituencies will be held on Thursday, with the BJP, Congress, and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) locked in a three-cornered battle in both seats. Voting will take place from 7 am to 8 pm, and results will be declared on June 23, according to election officials.The Visavadar seat in Junagadh, vacant since former AAP MLA Bhupendra Bhayani defected to the BJP in December 2023, has attracted high-profile candidates. The BJP has fielded Kirit Patel, Congress has nominated Nitin Ranpariya, while AAP has placed its former Gujarat president Gopal Italia, in the contest.In Kadi (Mehsana district), a seat reserved for Scheduled Caste (SC) candidates and lying vacant since BJP MLA Karsan Solanki’s death in February, the ruling party has fielded Rajendra Chavda. Congress has turned to Ramesh Chavda, a former MLA who won the seat in 2012, while AAP is banking on Jagdish Chavda.Polling will take place through Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) at 294 stations in each constituency. Gujarat government has also declared a public holiday in both constituencies on polling day to encourage voter participation.","Today's bypolls include two assembly seats in gujarat, one each in kerala, west bengal and punjab. The ludhiana west by-election is shaping up to be a high-stakes political showdown that could redefine the urban political narrative in punjab. Congress, looking to claw back a constituency it once firmly held, will be keen to settle scores.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121941392,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-209510,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

NEW DELHI: In Alwar's Kherli town, a nine-year-old boy witnessed his father's murder, allegedly orchestrated by his mother's lover along with four others, according to police reports on Wednesday. The child was present during the incident and told the police that his mother remained silent throughout the ordeal.The event occurred on June 7 night, when Veeru Jatav, a tent business owner, was allegedly killed by Kashiram Prajapat, a street vendor who was involved with Veeru's wife Anita. The murder was carried out with the help of hired accomplices.""In his statement, the child said that he woke up to the sound of the cot shaking. He saw Kashiram pressing his father's face with a pillow while his mother Anita stood nearby watching. When the boy tried to intervene, Kashiram picked him up and threatened him to keep quiet,"" stated Kherli SHO Dhirendra Singh.The boy related that his father returned home late and requested him to charge his mobile phone before retiring, whilst his mother told him to sleep early. The child later heard sounds and allegedly observed his mother allowing Kashiram and four others into their house.""I saw pappa being attacked. Mummy didn't say anything. I tried to go to pappa, but Kashiram uncle picked me up and scolded me. Then pappa stopped moving. Mummy is very bad.

Police say Shedeur Sanders was clocked at 101 mph near Strongsville, Ohio



The rookie QB now has two options: fight it in court or pay up



Fans react as Sanders' “fast start” takes on a whole new meaning



Just months after being drafted by the Cleveland Browns, rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders is already making headlines and not the kind the team was hoping for. Early Tuesday morning, the 22-year-old was pulled over in Ohio for allegedly speeding at 101 miles per hour on the highway. It was 12:24 a.m., and according to police records, Sanders was driving north on I-71 when he was cited for going 41 mph over the limit.According to the citation, Shedeur was pulled over by local authorities in Strongsville, about 20 minutes from downtown Cleveland. He was allegedly driving 101 mph, a clear violation of the speed limit and one that could come with steep penalties depending on how the case is handled.For now, it’s a standard traffic ticket, but driving over 100 mph can sometimes result in harsher consequences depending on local laws, past driving history, or how the court views the offense. Luckily for Shedeur, this doesn't appear to involve any DUI or reckless endangerment charges, just excessive speed.Shedeur now has a choice: he can either fight the ticket in court or pay the fine outright. That’s standard in these cases though fighting it could come with the hope of reducing points or penalties on his license.No official statement has been released by Sanders or the Browns organization, but it’s safe to assume the team is aware.And considering this is his rookie offseason, the last thing they want is more off-field drama.Naturally, fans didn’t waste time chiming in. Some joked that Sanders is just “practicing his 40-yard dash in a car,” while others questioned his decision-making just weeks before Browns training camp.It’s not uncommon for NFL players to land in hot water over speeding tickets, but driving over 100 mph? That’s never a good look, especially for a rookie QB already under the microscope thanks to his famous last name and high expectations.While no one's calling this a scandal, it’s definitely not the cleanest way to kick off your NFL career. Shedeur has time to clean it up, either by paying the fine or showing up in court. But you can bet Browns fans and coaches will be watching closely.Also read - “Fu*k KC”: Chiefs hit with racial bias lawsuit, fans stunned over pay gap and wrongful firing claims","Cleveland browns rookie quarterback shedeur sanders was cited for speeding early tuesday morning.

Is Gisele Bundchen over Tom Brady for good? Her recent move has fans convinced



Tom Brady has always worn his heart on his sleeve when it comes to family. This past Mother's Day, the NFL icon took a moment to publicly appreciate his ex-wife, Gisele Bündchen, for her role as a dedicated mother. His social media tribute described her as “strong,” “compassionate,” and “amazing,” praising her efforts in raising their two children, Benjamin and Vivian. For many, it was a reminder of Brady's commitment to celebrating the people who shaped his personal life, even if they are no longer together.However, when Father’s Day rolled around just weeks later, fans were taken aback by Bündchen’s silence. Not a single post or mention of Tom Brady appeared on her social media. While celebrities often choose to keep their personal expressions private, this noticeable absence sparked curiosity—and in some corners, criticism.Tom Brady’s heartfelt tribute had raised expectations of a reciprocal gesture. Instead, Bündchen’s pages remained focused on her personal life, which now includes her new family dynamic with jiu-jitsu trainer Joaquim Valente. Her most recent family-centered post revolved around her daughter Vivian’s birthday, capturing her happiness in a new chapter.This, for many fans, signaled a stronger desire to close the chapter on her former life with Brady and fully embrace her new one.Meanwhile, Brady continued to show the world that family is central to who he is. On Father's Day , he honored his own father, Tom Brady Sr., with a message that read, ""It's important to appreciate the people who shape us. No one's done more for me than my dad."" The tribute underscored the NFL legend’s consistent public display of gratitude, not just as a father but also as a son.The sharp contrast between Brady’s open expression and Gisele Bündchen’s silence triggered waves of speculation online. While some believed Gisele was simply setting boundaries, others viewed it as a sign of lingering tension. Social media comment sections quickly filled with polarized takes—some defending her right to privacy, others accusing her of being dismissive despite Brady’s previous gesture.Publications like The Sun and Newsweek also weighed in, noting how fans interpreted the silence as a possible reflection of a deeper divide between the ex-couple. Still, it's worth noting that neither Brady nor Bündchen has publicly addressed the situation, allowing the speculation to grow.According to People, Gisele’s romance with Valente blossomed slowly and quietly. “They started out as great friends first. She’s very private about this and wanted to keep it quiet while they got to know each other,” a source revealed. “He was a huge comfort for Gisele while she went through her divorce. Their friendship turned romantic after the divorce.”As the former couple continues to co-parent in the public eye, the disparity in their public gestures reveals the complexities that come with navigating life post-divorce—especially when the world is always watching.Also Read: Tom Brady once choked up as he admitted he wasn’t as good a father as his own dad: ""When I think about being a dad...""","Gisele bündchen didn't post on father's day.

Some locals bitter over Venice wedding



The upcoming wedding of Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez in Venice has polarized the city, with some residents protesting the event while others, including city officials, embrace it. Venice Mayor Luigi Brugnaro expressed strong support for the couple, stating, “I want Bezos to be welcomed with open arms in Venice. Protesting against those who bring visibility and wealth to our territory is, in my opinion, a disgrace.” Brugnaro, speaking to reporters on Friday, added, “We will have to apologize to Bezos. I am ashamed of those who behave like this. I hope that Bezos comes anyway. Not all Venetians think like these protesters,"" he told protestors.At the Biennale of Architecture, a staple Venice event, sentiments aligned more with city officials. Görge Meyer, a visitor from Berlin, told CNN, “It seems ridiculous that a city that lives off tourism like Venice wouldn’t want an event like this, which will employ hundreds of people from waiters to water taxi drivers. All the guests and journalists will be staying at hotels, eating at restaurants and spending money.”Gillian Longworth McGuire, an American travel writer living in Venice, noted the city’s historical allure for high-profile weddings, saying, “Venice just doesn’t have a clear idea of what it is supposed to be sometimes. Is it a magical place carved out of a lagoon, built by merchants and fishermen, or a bachelorette party and mega wedding venue? The ethos of this city was always that it was the crossroads of culture and the world.”However, not all residents are welcoming. The “No Space for Bezos” collective hung a banner with an X over Bezos’s name on a belltower overlooking the Venice lagoon, which was removed Thursday. The group declared on Facebook, “He’s not welcome, not in Venice, not anywhere!” highlighting local resentment toward the event.","Jeff bezos and lauren sánchez first met in 2016 at an amazon studios party for manchester by the sea.

NEW DELHI: Reminded on Tuesday of its duty to uphold rule of law and protect citizen’s right to free speech, Karnataka govt on Wednesday told the Supreme Court that if the film ‘Thug Life’ is released in the state theatres it will take every step to maintain law and order and provide security to those associated with screening and viewers.In an affidavit filed on the eve of the Thursday hearing before a bench of Justices Ujjal Bhuyan and Manmohan, the state govt through counsel D L Chidanand assured that “in the event the producers of the film decide to release the movie in Karnataka, the state govt is duty bound and will give protection and security for such release and for the people connected therewith, including the cast, director, producers, the exhibitors, and the audience. ”It said the state has not imposed any restriction on the release of the movie ‘Thug Life’, which has been duly certified by the Central Board of Film Certification.However, it said during the June 3 hearing before Karnataka HC, the film producer Rajkamal Films International had given an undertaking to the HC that it “will not release the movie in Karnataka till they resolve the issue with Karnataka Film Chamber of Commerce (KFCC).”SC on Tuesday transferred the producer’s petition from the HC to itself.KFCC, the apex body of Karnataka film industry, had written a letter to Hasan on May 30 expressing its displeasure at certain statements made by him at a promotional event and had sought his apology. The HC during the hearing had repeatedly asked why Hasan was so reluctant to apologize or express regret when public sentiment is hurt.In contrast, the SC bench of Justices Bhuyan and Manmohan on Tuesday had observed that “The HC had no business to seek regret or apology. As a custodian of rule of law and protector of rights, it should have considered the issue of whether a CBFC cleared film be allowed to be released in theatres of the state… Public sentiment does not mean a gun is put to the head of the theatre owners to stop screening of the film.”On the threat of violence issued by a vigilante group, the bench had said, “The Rule of Law demands that the film be released in the theatres of Karnataka. As democratic state, Karnataka cannot allow mobs to jeopardise the rule of law. The state must ensure that the rule of law prevails”In its affidavit, the Siddaramaiah govt told the SC that it is “the duty and responsibility of the state govt to uphold the fundamental rights of its citizens and in maintaining the ‘Rule of Law’ in the state, and the state govt and its instrumentalities are committed in discharging such duties and protecting the fundamental rights of its citizens, including the fundamental rights of the stakeholders involved in the present issue. ”",Karnataka govt told the supreme court that if the film ‘thug life’ is released in the state theatres it will take every step to maintain law and order.
