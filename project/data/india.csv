She was in court to tell the judges whether she wanted to live with her divorced father or mother.Minutes after a division bench of Justices M S Ramesh and V Lakshminarayanan pronounced the order, the girl tried to escape by jumping off the first-floor corridor of Court No 5, clutching a wire. The girl, who suffered injuries due to the fall, was rescued by police and rushed to the Rajiv Gandhi Govt General Hospital (RGGGH) in an ambulance stationed in the court.The issue pertains to a complaint made by M K Nair with the Neelankarai police alleging that his daughter was missing. Since considerable time had lapsed and the girl could not be secured, he moved a habeas corpus plea in high court. During the pendency of the petition, the girl was traced and produced before the court.The bench was informed that the girl had gone to her grandmother's house in the Andamans and was residing with her since she did not want to live with either her father or mother, who are divorced and living separately.In view of the wish expressed by the minor girl, the court subjected her to counselling before the Tamil Nadu Mediation and Conciliation Centre on the HC campus.However, the mediation talks failed, and the special counsellor's confidential report submitted to the court recorded that the child may require specialised counselling from a psychiatrist.When the judges interacted with the girl, she said she wanted to live with her mother in the Andamans. ""However, from the confidential report, we are of the view that there would not be a conducive atmosphere for the minor girl to safely reside in the Andamans. Since the girl said that she does not want to live with her father, the only alternative left to us is to direct her to be put in a safety home,"" the court said.The court then directed police to ensure that the girl is safely admitted to Govt Children's Home for Girls, Kellys, Chennai, by Aug 12. ""During her stay there, the petitioner shall accompany his minor daughter and produce her before Dr Venkat, psychiatrist attached to the Institute of Mental Health, Ayanavaram Road, Kilpauk, by Aug 13 and on any other subsequent dates, as specified by the specialist,"" the bench said.""We request Dr Venkat, psychiatrist, to submit an interim report on his evaluation in a sealed cover. The psychiatrist is also at liberty to counsel the father, who has not been living with his daughter for a very long time.It is made clear that the cost of medical fees and other expenses of the minor girl and the petitioner shall be borne by the petitioner.During the stay of the girl at the govt home, her mother/grandmother are at liberty to visit her during the permissible hours,"" the court added and adjourned the hearing to Aug 26.","A 14-year-old girl tried to escape from police by jumping from the court's first floor.

The new roster came into effect Monday.The roster change was effected after an SC division bench did not delete a key paragraph (para 24) that instructed the high court chief justice to ""immediately withdraw the present criminal determination"" from Justice Kumar.Now, as per the new roster, a division bench comprising senior judge Arindam Sinha and Justice Kumar will hear civil matters pertaining to family court appeals, matters pertaining to the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act of 2007, and Writ C (a specific category of writ petitions) matters, except as provided elsewhere.Following a controversy over the SC order, the same bench of the apex court had deleted critical remarks against Justice Kumar and also the direction that he not be assigned any criminal matter as long as he is in office. This order, especially the direction for removal of criminal law work from Justice Kumar until retirement, drew criticism within SC as well as Allahabad HC.Subsequently, at least 13 high court judges had written to Chief Justice Arun Bhansali urging him to convene a full court meeting and not comply SC's directives against Justice Kumar.Interestingly, the letter was authored by Justice Arindam Sinha.In its Aug 4 order, SC, while hearing a special leave petition, had strongly criticised Justice Kumar's reasoning and expressed shock at his conclusion that civil disputes could be pursued through criminal prosecution because civil suits ""take years to conclude"". However, following the controversy, the apex court re-listed the matter to reconsider its directions. It was done on the request of CJI B R Gavai. Subsequently, in its Aug 8 order, the division bench clarified it had no intention to ""cause embarrassment or cast aspersions on the concerned judge"" and reiterated that the judiciary must protect its institutional dignity.","Justice prashant kumar will sit as part of an allahabad high court division bench headed by a senior judge.

Stray dogs case: Supreme Court says whole problem is because of 'inaction' of authorities; 10 takeaways from hearing,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/stray-dogs-row-protest-supreme-court-hearing-august-11-order-delhi-government-civic-authority-latest-updates/articleshow/123297274.cms,"Here are 10 takeaways from SC's hearing:



SC's observation

The three-judge bench comprising Justices Nath, Sandeep Mehta and N V Anjaria reserved order on the interim prayer seeking a stay on the August 11 order of picking up strays from the streets of Delhi-NCR.

Children are dying, issue needs to be resolved, Delhi Govt tells SC



Delhi government, during the hearing, told SC that the issue of stray dogs needs to be resolved and contested, adding that children are dying due to dog bites, causing rabies.

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Delhi government, presented data before the bench saying, over 37 lakh reported dog bites in a year in the country. ""Nobody is an animal hater,"" Mehta told the bench.

Mehta told the Supreme Court that it is a contest between a vocal minority vs a silent majority who are suffering because of dog bites.

'Vocal minority vs silent majority'



Senior advocate Kapil Sibal, who was appearing for an NGO, asserted that the situation is ""very serious"" and the matter needed to be argued in depth.

Sibal further sought a stay on the order passed by the apex court on August 11, directing the removal of stray dogs from streets.

NEW DELHI: Heavy rains wreaked havoc in the national capital on Thursday, claiming three lives within 12 hours and leaving parts of the city paralysed by waterlogging, fallen trees and traffic chaos.In southwest Delhi’s Vasant Vihar, two boys died after a wall collapsed on them in Basant Nagar near Hanuman Mandir around 4.40 pm. Police said they received a call about the incident and rushed to the spot along with a disaster management team.A 10-year-old boy from Begusarai, Bihar, and a 9-year-old boy from Madhubani, Bihar, were pulled from the debris and taken to AIIMS Trauma Centre in PCR vans.Both of them were declared dead upon arrival, deputy commissioner of police (Southwest) Amit Goel said.Police said the boys were sitting on stairs next to the wall when it suddenly collapsed.According to the DCP, the wall, owned by the Delhi Development Authority (DDA), is suspected to have been weakened by prolonged rain and waterlogging in the area.Police said the debris was being cleared to prevent any further inconvenience.They added that the DDA had been informed and would conduct a detailed inspection to assess the structural safety of surrounding walls.The bodies have been kept for post-mortem, and legal formalities are in progress.Earlier in the day, a massive old neem tree uprooted and fell on vehicles in South Delhi’s Kalkaji area, killing a man and injuring his daughter.

If he is not resigning, chief minister Rekha Gupta should remove him from the post,” she said.She called the situation in the national capital the result of the “failure of BJP’s four engines.”Atishi further claimed that even with all powers in its hands, the ruling party had failed to safeguard citizens during the monsoon.","Two boys died after a wall collapsed on them in southwest delhi's vasant vihar.
