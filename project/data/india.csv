How former ICICI Bank relationship manager committed fraud: 10 Points

The investigation revealed that Sakshi Gupta had gained unauthorised access to more than 110 accounts of 41 customers and executed multiple illegal transactions.

Investigators found that she had diverted the misappropriated funds into stock market investments, which subsequently resulted in substantial financial losses.

In order to hide the deception, Gupta allegedly substituted the registered mobile numbers of various bank accounts with those of her family members.

The actual account holders were unable to receive transaction notifications and one-time passwords (OTPs) due to this modification, according to police reports.

The investigation revealed multiple fraudulent activities by Gupta, including unauthorised activation of overdraft facilities across 40 accounts.

Further findings showed that she had unlawfully terminated fixed deposits belonging to 31 clients, channeling Rs 1.34 crore to different accounts.

The probe uncovered her unauthorised usage of debit cards, along with their associated PINs and OTPs, to conduct various online and ATM transactions.

Additionally, Gupta was found responsible for processing a fraudulent personal loan amounting to Rs 3.4 lakh.

The investigation also established that she had extensively utilised Insta Kiosk machines and digital banking platforms to execute numerous fraudulent transactions.

The illicit funds were distributed across several Demat accounts, suggesting an attempt to conceal the money trail.

Rs 4.58 crore siphoned off - over 100 accounts of customers accessed - fixed deposits broken: This is not some movie plot - it’s a stunning fraud that a former ICICI Bank relationship manager pulled off! The multi-crore fraud continued for over two years.The accused, Sakshi Gupta, who served at ICICI Bank ’s Shriram Nagar branch in Kota's DCM area from 2020 to 2023, was taken into custody by Udhyog Nagar police on May 31, 2025 after a thorough investigation.According to a TOI report, police records indicate that the fraudulent activities were initially discovered on February 18.Following ICICI Bank's internal probe that identified Sakshi Gupta, who previously worked as a relationship manager at the bank's DCM branch in Kota, as the primary suspect in a significant financial fraud affecting customer accounts, the Kota police have begun their enquiry. The authorities are examining potential accomplices and have asked the bank to furnish pertinent documentation.After identifying irregularities, bank manager Tarun Dadhich registered a complaint, which led to a comprehensive audit and subsequent police investigation.""She systematically transferred funds, sometimes using the account of an elderly woman who had no knowledge of the activity as a pool account,"" said sub-inspector Ibrahim of Udhyog Nagar police station.""By mid-February 2023, over Rs 3 crore had passed through that single account.""Following a one-day police custody, Gupta appeared before the court and was sent to judicial custody. The police continue their enquiries into the matter.A representative from ICICI Bank said, ""The interest of our customers are of paramount importance to us. Immediately upon discovering the fraudulent activity, we filed an FIR with the police. We have a zero-tolerance policy against any fraudulent activity and thus suspended the employee involved. We would like to reassure that genuine claims of impacted customers have been settled.""","Sakshi gupta had gained unauthorised access to more than 110 accounts of 41 customers.

They might have lost their way on a trek, it was thought.On June 2, as Raja Raghuvanshi's body was found in a gorge, it was suspected to be a robbery gone wrong. A 'dao' (machete) and phone lay near his body, and a blood-stained raincoat found a few kilometres away. His gold ring and chain, it turned out, were missing. As cops dug deeper, the case took a chilling turn.Also read: ‘Happy to marry whoever you choose,’ Sonam had told father Police formed an SIT with SDRF, NDRF, and central and state intelligence units to crack what became a nationwide sensation. Both families demanded a CBI probe. Even after cops claimed to have cracked the case Monday and arrested Raghuvanshi's bride, Sonam, from a dhaba in UP, and four suspects, including her alleged lover Raj Kushwaha, the stories kept coming. She initially told Ghazipur police that miscreants robbed and killed Raja near the falls, but refused to disclose where she had been or how she escaped.""I didn't kill my husband. They killed him for the jewellery,"" Sonam said, referring to the four arrested men. Those were Akash Rajput, 21, from Lalitpur (UP), Vishal Singh Chauhan, 22, and Kushwaha, 21, both from Indore, and Anand Kurmi, 23, from Satna in MP.Indore additional DCP Rajesh Dandotiya said Akash, Vishal and Raj were produced in court and sent on seven-day transit remand.Anand is being brought to Indore & will be presented in court Tuesday.Raj, suspected to be the prime co-conspirator, used to live near Sonam's home and worked as an accountant in Sonam's family business. He moved away a year ago but remained employed. Police claimed Sonam's family was against her relationship with Raj. Eventually, her marriage was arranged with Raja through a Kushwaha community network.Just four days after her wedding, Sonam returned to her parental home for a post-marriage ritual. She allegedly plotted her husband's murder with Raj during that visit. The plot, investigators alleged, was to eliminate him in the next few days so she could reunite with Raj.East Khasi Hills SP Vivek Syiem alleged Sonam had been sending her location to Raj throughout the trip. Investigators believe the killers trailed the couple after they visited Kamakhya temple in Guwahati. Raj remained in Indore, while Akash, Vishal and Anand travelled by train to Assam, police alleged.""The murder weapon was purchased in Guwahati,"" an officer in Indore said. Sonam reportedly pushed Raja to extend their stay in Shillong - a move now seen as part of a premeditated plan.Tourist guide Albert Pde told investigators he saw the couple with three Hindi-speaking men on May 23 as they climbed 3,000 steps from Nongriat to Mawlakhiat. That detail was key - pointing to outsiders shadowing the honeymooners.""All the dots connected to indicate that there was prior planning,"" SP Syiem said. ""We will confirm everything once the accused are interrogated together."" Sonam's parents dismissed the allegations.

BENGALURU: Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah and his deputy DK Shivakumar have been summoned to Delhi for a damage-control meeting Tuesday with Lok Sabha LoP Rahul Gandhi as continued outrage over the June 4 Bengaluru stampede that killed 11 RCB fans puts Congress - accused of playing pass-the-buck - on a sticky wicket.A bureaucrat in the CMO said Siddaramaiah, who maintains that the state govt didn't put a foot wrong, received what he described as ""a sudden call"" from the Congress brass. He and Shivakumar were asked to prepare a detailed briefing of the administration's response to the stampede outside Chinnaswamy Stadium ahead of IPL-winning RCB's victory parade, the official said. Congress's urgency to firm up a strategy to counter the storm comes a day after the opposition doubled down on its demand for political accountability, including a three-day special legislative session to discuss what led to the stampede.Sources said AICC's Karnataka minder, Randeep Singh Surjewala, will be with Rahul at the scheduled 11am meeting with Siddaramaiah and Shivakumar.

NEW DELHI: The murder case of Indore-based businessman Raja Raghuvanshi in Meghalaya hills has sent shockwaves, with more details emerging. Now, the mother of the murdered businessman, Uma Raghuvanshi, has shared more insights, saying that his son was not willing to go on honeymoon so soon. But she (mother) told him to go if his wife, Sonam, has booked the tickets.Uma also said that Sonam planned the trip for their honeymoon but did not book the return ticket. Talking about his wedding, she said, it was an arranged marriage, and Sonam's behaviour was good with the family, so they never had any doubt about her. Meanwhile, Raja's brother Vipul Raghuvanshi claimed that the couple had earlier made plans for visiting Kamakhya temple in Guwahati but unexpectedly changed their plan.According to a report from news agency PTI, Uma Raghuvanshi told reporters, ""My son went to Meghalaya with Sonam on her insistence. He did not want to go on honeymoon so soon. My son had told me that Sonam booked tickets for the trip to Meghalaya. I told him that if the ticket has been booked, then he should go to Meghalaya with his wife.""""My son also told me that although Sonam had not booked the return ticket for both of them from Meghalaya, they will return to Indore in six-seven days,"" she added.On seeing the latest picture of Sonam (from Ghazipur), Uma Raghuvanshi expressed shock as there was not even a scratch mark on her body.""I want to hear from Sonam, where, why and in what condition she left Raja,"" she said.Sharing details about Raja and Sonam's wedding, Uma said that after their engagement, her daughter-in-law did not spend enough time with her son and avoided going out with him before marriage.""When we had asked Sonam about this, she said that she has a lot of work to do in the office. Sonam said if she is not able to call my son, then my son can also call her,"" she said.""Sonam's mother had told me that her family is very strict against a man and a woman meeting before marriage and Sonam's father does not like such meetings,"" she added.Uma told reporters that wedding was held in traditional way and with the consent of Raja, Sonam and both families.""My son was very happy after the marriage. He wanted Sonam as his wife from the bottom of his heart. We still cannot believe that she could get her husband killed. It would have been better if my son had remained unmarried, as it could have saved his life,"" she said.Uma said that she feels quite restless at night after losing her son, adding that if Sonam got Raja killed, then she should be hanged to death.""I tell my son's photo that whoever did wrong to him should be punished,"" she said.Talking to IANS, Vipin Raghuvanshi, the brother of the deceased, said, ""There is news that has come out, and honestly, we are all shocked because we had never heard any news like this before. I had never even seen it. Until now, we have been searching for Sonam, and now, Sonam has been found. Sonam's name is coming out as a conspirator.""""Raj Kushwaha, I heard the name before, as he was an employer of Sonam's company. He and Sonam both can be involved. However, we would still like to wait for a proper investigation,"" he added.Raja's sister-in-law, Bhumi Raghuvanshi, added, ""We were very shocked to hear Sonam's name coming up. We cannot believe this at all, but now we want a proper investigation to be conducted regarding Sonam. If she did this, then why? The marriage happened with consent, and both were happy, but why would she do this? We demand a swift investigation.""Vipul further disclosed that Raja and Sonam initially planned to visit Kamakhya temple in Guwahati but unexpectedly changed the plan and headed to Shillong.He said that Sonak had made all the bookings, and her family was unaware of the sudden change in their plan.Sonam left for the airport from her paternal home wearing her wedding jewellery, according to the family.According to an IANS report, the Indore businessman was also carrying ornaments, including a diamond ring, chain, and bracelet valued at over Rs 10 lakh, to their honeymoon.Uma Raghuvanshi had also questioned the need to carry so much jewellery.Raja and Sonam got married on May 11 and left for Meghalaya on May 20.

This has shrunk the PB to just four active members-Muppalla Laxman Rao alias Ganpathy, Mallojula Venugopal alias Abhay, Thippiri Tirupathi alias Deoji, and Misir Besra.Sources indicated that either Abhay or Deoji, both from Telangana, may have take up Basavaraju's mantle, though there is no statement yet from CPI (Maoist) on the succession. Every PB member is part of the CC but not vice versa.The CC numbers too have dwindled, with 26 non-PB members lost since 2007 to arrests, surrenders and death by illness. It now has 14 active members, including the four PB leaders. A dozen CC members are currently in jail and three dead by disease.Four CC members have surrendered in Telangana and Maharashtra and seven neutralised since 2007, including four this year.Active CC members now include Kadari Satyanaryana Reddy, Chandranna, Modem Balakrishna, Ganesh Uike, Gajarla Ravi, Anal da, Madvi Hidma, K Ramachandra Reddy, Sujata and Malla Raja Reddy.""The command structure of the Maoists is now in tatters.

Between 2008 and 2011, more PB members landed behind bars-Pramod Mishra in Ranchi in 2008 and again in 2022; Kobad Gandhy in Delhi in 2009, though he is now a free man; Amitabh Bagchi in Ranchi in 2009; and Jagdish Yadav in Gaya, Bihar, in 2011.

Kattam Sudarshan died in Dandakarenya in 2023. PB members Cherkuri Rajkumar alias 'Azad' and Kishenji were killed in 2010-2011, while Arvindji succumbed to illness in Jharkhand in 2018. Prashant Bose alias Kishan da was arrested with his wife Sheela Marandi, a CC member, from Jharkhand in 2021.The biggest blow came with the elimination of CPI (Maoist) general secretary Basavaraju, a PB and CC member.

War of words

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday marked 11 years of his ""seva"" showcasing India’s Vikas Yatra under his NDA government guided by the principle of ""Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas, Sabka Prayas. ""The Prime Minister took to X to state that in the 11 years of his government - ""India has undergone a decade of remarkable transformation across diverse sectors, driven by the principles of Seva, Sushasan, and Garib Kalyan. The NDA government has delivered path-breaking changes with speed, scale and sensitivity."" The BJP celebrated the occasion with a song ""Safar chal raha hai, desh badal raha hai ..."" as NDA leaders, including the Union ministers, hailed the 11-year golden rule.The BJP cheers were countered with sharp attacks from the opposition ranks, led by the Congress , which alleged that the government has only ""smeared the ink of dictatorship"" on every page of the Constitution in these 11 years. While Congress chief Mallikarjun Kharge accused the ""BJP-RSS of weakening every constitutional institution and attacking their autonomy,"" Rahul Gandhi claimed that in the eleven years of Modi government, there was no accountability, no change, only propaganda.The leader of the opposition in Lok Sabha said the Centre has stopped talking about the present and is now selling dreams of 2047.The completion of 11 years also marked a book vs book fight. The Centre released an e-book, “Viksit Bharat ka Amrit Kaal: Seva, Sushasan, Garib Kalyan ke 11 Saal”, on its achievements across all the sectors over the past 11 years under the leadership of PM Modi.“The year 2025 marks 11 years of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government. These 11 years have been dedicated to bring about development which is inclusive, progressive, and sustainable. The government under Prime Minister Modi has been steadfast in its commitment of creating equity and opportunity for all citizens. PM Modi has brought the politics of development - Vikasvaad - into the mainstream, making it the focal point around which political discourse and policy action now revolves,"" said its introduction.Divided into 14 chapters, the book covers issues ranging from schemes for the poor and marginalised, farmer welfare, economy, healthcare, women/youth empowerment, infrastructure development, tech revolution, ease-of-living for middle class, the progress made in northeast, national security and foreign policy, environment and sustainability initiatives, and preservation and propagation of the country's rich culture and heritage“Since assuming office in 2014, PM Modi has remained firm in his resolve of keeping ‘India First’ in every policy formulation and action. This resolve is evident in government’s handling of both external and internal security, economic management, empowerment schemes for marginalised groups, efforts at cultural conservation and so on,” it said.The Congress countered this by releasing a booklet to highlight stagnated growth rate, rising hunger, and ""unfulfilled promises"" of Modi government in last 11 years. Congress general secretary Jairam Ramesh in a post on X said that the booklet, '11 Saal, Jhoothe Vikaas ke vade', commemorates ""some of the biggest lies of this Government.""Addressing a press conference, AICC research department head Rajeev Gowda, who prepared the booklet, alleged, ""This government is very good at fake news and propaganda. It is our job as the opposition to get people to know this grim reality.""He said that to expose the BJP's on its promises the party was releasing two sets of documents. The booklet, 'Ek Aur Baar Jumla Sarkar', he said, looks at the promises made by the BJP in its 2024 manifesto, and has since made. The other one, he said, is '11 Saal Jhoote Vikaas Ke Vaade', which is a ""detailed exposé"" of the ""hollow promises"" of the BJP.While the BJP leaders and its allies hailed PM Modi's 11-year rule, the opposition parties targeted the NDA government.Home minister Amit Shah on Monday lauded the 11 years of Modi government as a ""golden period"" in public service. Shah said when PM Modi took over the reins of the country in 2014, there was policy paralysis in the country.The Union home minister said this new India under Modi is rapidly progressing towards development and self-reliance with the power of reform, perform and transform.Senior BJP leader and Union minister Nitin Gadkari said under Modi's ""visionary leadership"", India has undergone a historic transformation grounded in seva (service), good governance, and inclusive development.""From empowering women, youth, and farmers to modernising infrastructure and healthcare, Bharat's progress has been swift and far-reaching. With global leadership, a self-reliant economy, and a people-first approach, India stands tall on the world stage,"" he said.Defence minister Rajnath Singh asserted that India stands well-equipped and unwavering in its resolve to safeguard its territorial integrity, as Union ministers praised the prime minister's leadership.The 11 years of Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government will be written in golden letters for the positive changes it has effected, BJP president J P Nadda said.The Congress said the Modi government in the last 11 years has dealt a deep blow to the country's democracy, economy and social fabric. In a post on X, Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge alleged that the government has only ""smeared the ink of dictatorship"" on every page of the Constitution in these 11 years.""The BJP-RSS has weakened every constitutional institution and attacked their autonomy, "" he said. Kharge said efforts are constantly being made to spread an environment of ""hatred, threats and fear"".Rahul Gandhi alleged that 11 years of Modi government have been ""without accountability or change"" but only about ""propaganda"".In a post on X, Rahul Gandhi said that instead of talking of the present, the BJP government is ""selling dreams of 2047"".""While the Modi Government is celebrating 11 years of 'service', the reality of the country is reflected in the tragic news coming from Mumbai - several people died after falling from a train. Indian Railways is the backbone of the lives of crores of people, but today it has become a symbol of insecurity, congestion and chaos,"" Rahul Gandhi said.""Eleven years of Modi government = no accountability, no change, only propaganda. Who will see what the country is facing today? I express my deepest condolences to the families of the deceased and wish the injured a speedy recovery,"" he added.Eight passengers travelling towards Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT) fell from an excessively crowded train at Mumbra railway station in Thane district on Monday, officials from Central Railways said on Monday.Samajwadi Party supremo Akhilesh Yadav criticised the BJP governments in the Centre and Uttar Pradesh.As the BJP is celebrating 11 years of the Modi government, Yadav questioned the government over the issue of education, employment and economic activities.The SP chief further alleged that there is a lack of coordination among the BJP-led Central and Uttar Pradesh governments, citing their ongoing schemes.(With inputs from agencies)","'viksit bharat ka amrit kaal: seva, sushasan, garib kalyan ke 11 saal’ marks 11 years of pm modi's government.

The terms of all state assemblies constituted after this date will expire with the end of that Lok Sabha's five-year term. If Lok Sabha or a state assembly is dissolved earlier than its five-year term, an election for it will be held for a term equal to the remainder of the five-year term.This will synchronise its next election with the simultaneous elections cycle. Even in states, where polls will be due, elections for assemblies will be held only to align with the Lok Sabha polls.However, the bill states that if the Election Commission is of the opinion that election to a state assembly cannot be held along with the rest of the country, it may make a recommendation to the President in this regard. The President may issue an order to conduct an election for that assembly at a later date. The BJP MP from Pali in Rajasthan, Choudhary, said going by the JPC's working, its tenure may be extended as there was a consensus amongst panel members to visit states and UTs before making the final recommendations. So far, JPC members have visited Maharashtra and Uttarakhand. The bills had been introduced in LS in Dec last year and were referred to the Chaudhary-led panel which has been holding consultations with stakeholders for feedback.","The constitution (129th amendment) bill, 2024, and the union territories laws (amendment bill), 2024, have provisions for simultaneous elections to the lok sabha and state assemblies.
