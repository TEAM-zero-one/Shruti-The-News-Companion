‘Our humanity is stronger than terrorists’ hate’



Scared tourists found sanctuary in Kashmiri homes that opened their doors to strangers in the aftermath of Tuesday's terror attack in Pahalgam, Over the next three days, many would become friends for life.Rupali Patil , a Pune resident holidaying in Pahalgam, said she was afraid to step out of her hotel room after hearing of the massacre.""Amid the chaos and confusion, I and many others found comfort in the homes of Kashmiris who took the responsibility of keeping us safe. Some of them travelled to get members of our group who were elsewhere back safely,"" she said.Ramdas Khopde, also from Maharashtra, was offered shelter by Adill Malik, of Sopore. “We were looking for safe accommodation when we met this Kashmiri family who not only took us in at a difficult time but refused to take money,” he said.The Maliks said they wanted to send out “a positive message to the world” at a time of crisis in J&K. “What happened in Pahalgam was a cowardly attack, but we want to say that our humanity is stronger than the hate in the hearts of those terrorists,” Adill told TOI over phone from Sopore. “Scores of Kashmiri families have lost their tourism business for the entire season. But at this moment, our priority is safety of all tourists. We won’t let any tourist suffer,” he said.Taxi driver and tourist guide Adil Shaikh, who has been hosting another group of tourists from Maharashtra in his home near Srinagar, said Kashmir’s famed hospitality had been put to the test by terrorists who had nothing to do with the region’s culture and traditions.Most tourists in Srinagar have flights scheduled for this weekend.

Nepal medic killed in Pahalgam didn’t get time to say he was a foreigner,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nepal-medic-killed-in-pahalgam-didnt-get-time-to-say-he-was-a-foreigner/articleshow/120592414.cms,"Sudeep Neupane, 27, was the only foreign national killed in the terror attack on tourists in Pahalgam.

NEW DELHI: After travelling across three states and an international border, the body of Sudeep Neupane , 27, the only foreign national killed in the terror attack on tourists in Pahalgam, reached his home in Kalikanagar, a neighbourhood in Butwal, western Nepal, draped in the national flag.He was cremated at Triveni Ghat around noon, with hundreds, including local govt officials, gathered for the last rites. Sudeep, his family said, was shot immediately after he identified himself as a Hindu and had no time to explain that he was not from India.Butwal, a city in Lumbini province, sits just 25km north of the Indian border at Sunauli, close enough for shared economies and quiet daily crossings. It is not the kind of place where news arrives quickly, and yet by the time the ambulance reached Sudeep’s home, the neighbourhood had already gathered.Sudeep had travelled to Kashmir with his mother Reema, sister Sushma, and brother-in-law Ujjwal Kafle on April 19. It was meant to be a brief trip, just long enough to give his divorced mother some respite. On the day of the shooting, the family was walking along the meadow when a group of men with guns approached. Witnesses later said the attackers asked about their religion. Sudeep was walking slightly ahead of the others. He answered that he was Hindu. Before he could say anything else, he was shot. “He didn’t get the chance to say he was a foreigner,” said Tejulal Neupane , his uncle, who has since called for compensation from the Indian govt. “He had nothing to do with anything.”His death triggered a series of logistical efforts across two countries. His body was airlifted from Srinagar to New Delhi on Wednesday evening, then flown to Lucknow later that night. From there, it was driven overland to Sunauli before crossing into Nepal. A district magistrate from Uttar Pradesh accompanied the body as far as the border. At Sunauli, it was received by Dadhiram Neupane, Sudeep’s uncle and the ward chairperson of Butwal-14. A police escort led the final leg to Kalikanagar. Butwal mayor Khelraj Pandey, Rupandehi chief district officer Basudev Ghimire , and police chief Ranjit Singh Rathore joined the procession.Sudeep lived in Kalikanagar for most of his life. After his parents, Dhruv Neupane and Reema Pandey, separated, he stayed behind to support his mother. His sister moved to Pokhara after marriage, but Sudeep remained, managing the household finances, arranging care, and eventually becoming its only earning member. He held a public health degree from Dharan and was pursuing further studies in Kathmandu while working part-time on an oral health campaign in rural Nepal.The job did not pay much, but it was steady, and he had grown invested in the work. “He wasn’t just showing up,” said Amrit Bhusal, who runs Modern Samaj Dental, the clinic that had employed him for nearly a year. “He was doing follow-ups. He was tracking cases. He was committed in a way that was unusual.”In Pyuthan, Bhairahawa, and along the outer districts of Rupandehi, his visits became routine. He carried a clipboard and often walked between health posts on foot. When he spoke about public health, his colleagues said, it was in practical terms — transport access, dental hygiene, vaccine follow-up — not in abstract declarations.At home, he was quiet. Neighbours described him as careful and unobtrusive. Rajendra Kumar Acharya, who lives two houses down, remembered a brief conversation before the trip. “He told us he was going to Kashmir. He seemed happy to be taking a break. That’s all.” His 89-year-old grandfather, Khemananda Neupane, learned of the death indirectly. “My wife stopped my prayers,” he said. “She told me something had happened. I didn’t understand at first.”His father, Dhruv Neupane, a teacher at Bhawanipur High School in Butwal-18, was returning from a teachers’ protest in Kathmandu when his phone began to ring. “No one would say it outright,” he said. “Only when I arrived home did I understand what they had been trying to tell me. It doesn’t matter where I live. He was my child.”","Sudeep neupane, 27, was the only foreign national killed in the terror attack on tourists in pahalgam. He was shot immediately after he identified himself as a hindu and had no time to explain that he was not from india.

Whether it is a party with 1 MP or a 100, they were both elected by Indians and deserve to be heard on such an important matter. This is not a political issue, it is a national issue.

KOZHIKODE: What began as a joyful afternoon zip-lining through scenic Baisaran soon turned into a scene of horror for Nihal and his family, residents of Kerala's Kozhikode. While filming a family member enjoying the ride, they inadvertently captured chilling footage of terrorists gunning down innocent people.Nihal, his cousins and the mother of one of the cousins reached the valley around 2.20pm and immediately went for the zip-lining ride. ""I was waiting at the starting point and focusing on my cousin who went on the zip-line before me. It was when she reached middle of ride that I heard a gunshot. I thought it was the sound of crackers, only to notice a man 100m away holding a weapon and a woman lying on the ground. It was then that I realised that something was seriously wrong,"" said Nihal.He said his cousin and her mother, by then at the other end of the zip-line, fled along with other people as gunshots shattered the serenity of the beautiful meadow.Nihal said a local woman told him to escape fast, and he, along with his other cousin, climbed over a fence and ran down the slopes. On reaching a safe spot downhill, he came to know that a local Kashmiri resident had provided shelter to his cousin and her mother in his house. He then travelled around 2km to reach them.But it was only later when Nihal examined the video that he noticed chilling images of a terrorist shooting tourists in the background. A man in white dress was gunned down by a terrorist, with the clip recording sounds of repeated gunfire. The time the video logged was 2.25pm.","Nihal, his cousins and the mother of one of the cousins went for the zip-lining ride.
