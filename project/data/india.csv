'Cried for an hour after funeral': Raj Kushwaha's family claims he's innocent in Meghalaya murder case

(With inputs from PTI)





INDORE: The grandmother of accused Raj Kushwaha has died in Uttar Pradesh's Fatehpur district following a heart attack.According to family members, Ramlali had gone into deep shock ever since Raj was arrested for the murder of Indore's Raja Raghuvanshi in Meghalaya.Family sources say she had stopped eating and remained withdrawn for days. Late Tuesday night, she suffered a heart attack and died.Ram Lalli, 74, died at her residence in Rampur village of Gazipur, located in Uttar Pradesh’s Fatehpur district. Her husband, Darbari Singh, told reporters that she had been deeply distressed since Raj’s name emerged as the key conspirator in the case.""She was constantly defending her grandson, insisting he was innocent and being framed,"" Singh said, adding that the allegations weighed heavily on her.Just a week ago, Ram Lalli had spoken to the media in support of her grandson. ""Raj never had an affair with anyone. Sonam got her husband killed and is dragging Raj into this,"" she had said. She had also alleged that powerful people were involved in the case and “they can do anything.”Singh recalled Raj as a quiet, responsible young man who had been supporting his family ever since his father died during the Covid pandemic.The family had moved to Indore around 15 years ago amid financial hardship, with Raj joining them about a decade later along with his mother and two sisters, once their situation stabilised.Raj, a Class 12 pass-out, worked as an accountant at a furniture sheet manufacturing unit owned by Sonam Raghuvanshi’s family in Indore's Govind Nagar Kharcha area.Police have so far refused to comment on the development, citing that the case is being handled by authorities in another state.Raja Raghuvanshi had married Sonam on May 11 and the couple left for their honeymoon in Meghalaya on May 20. Just three days later, Raja went missing. His mutilated body was found on June 2 in a gorge near a waterfall in Sohra, East Khasi Hills.Sonam surrendered to police in Uttar Pradesh’s Ghazipur district on June 8. Raj Kushwaha and others accused were picked up from various parts of Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh.According to investigators, Sonam allegedly orchestrated her husband’s murder, with Raj and three of his childhood friends helping to execute the plan.""No, not our boy..."" — the words echo through a cramped 200sqft room in Indore’s Shankar Nagar, where the family of 21-year-old Raj Kushwaha has shut themselves away in disbelief. Raj was arrested for allegedly conspiring with Sonam Raghuvanshi to murder her husband Raja during their honeymoon in Meghalaya.Since the arrest, the family has been in a state of shock. Raj’s 15-year-old sister reportedly faints every time a police siren passes by. Neighbours have stopped speaking to them. The family is reeling from the accusation that Raj, who worked in billing for Sonam's family business, was not only her lover but also allegedly orchestrated Raja’s murder with the help of three childhood friends.Police said Raj stayed close to both families in the aftermath of the incident, even attending Raja’s funeral and supporting Sonam’s father. ""He cried for an hour after coming from the funeral,"" said his mother, 52-year-old Chunni Bai. ""He said he'd have died if he had seen Raja's body.""But things changed quickly. Hours after the cremation last Sunday, Raj changed clothes and left, telling his family he was going to co-accused Vishal’s house. Then came silence — his phone was switched off. He was later picked up by police from Vishal’s home.","Ram lalli, 74, died at her residence in rampur village of gazipur, located in uttar pradesh’s fatehpur district.

Woman deboarded after alert from flight captain





BENGALURU: A 36-year-old doctor was arrested on Tuesday after she created ruckus aboard an Air India flight from Bengaluru to Surat and allegedly threatened to crash the aircraft when cabin crew objected to her placing baggage in a restricted area near the crew cabin.The incident delayed the flight by two hours and led to a security scare. The accused, identified as Vyas Hiral Mohanbhai, from Shivanahalli near Yelahanka, was travelling alone on AI Flight IX2749 with two pieces of baggage.Also read: Air India cuts frequencies across North America, UK, EU, Far East & Australia 'at least' till July 15 According to police, the Ayurvedic doctor bypassed the check-in counter, insisting on carrying both bags on board. The situation escalated after Mohanbhai boarded the flight and left one of her bags near the crew cabin while taking the other to her seat, 20F.When the cabin crew asked her to keep the bag in the overhead compartment near her seat, she refused and insisted they keep it with them. Despite repeated requests by the crew and later the captain, Mohanbhai refused to comply and began abusing the staff.The confrontation soon involved fellow passengers, who also tried to reason with her, but she reportedly shouted at them. At one point, she allegedly threatened to crash the flight if the crew moved her baggage.With the situation spiralling, the captain alerted security and called CISF personnel, who boarded the aircraft and offloaded her.The incident took place between 2.45pm and 5.30pm, according to a complaint filed by Agnimitra Bahinipati, associate manager of security at KIA. Police said Mohanbhai did not stop there. Once taken to KIA police station, she continued to abuse and manhandle police officers, creating further disturbance. “This was the first time we heard such abusive language in the station,” a senior officer claimed.Her husband, who works in an educational institution in the city and hails from Odisha, appeared before police. He informed them that Mohanbhai had stopped practising medicine and was en route to Gujarat to visit her family.He reportedly told police she had created disturbances in public spaces in the past. Police are now verifying her background and previous incidents.","Vyas hiral mohanbhai, 36, from shivanahalli near yelahanka, was travelling alone on ai flight ix2749.

Nilambur bypoll is Congress’s semi-final in Kerala



Poll What matters more to you during elections? Proven track record and past performance Promising vision for the future

Kaliganj heats up amid riot shadow



Ludhiana West Bypoll a Crucial Test for AAP, Congress, SAD and BJP



Gujarat gears up for bypolls in Visavadar and Kadi



NEW DELHI: Interest around assembly byelections is mostly limited to the states, more so, if the contest does not involve heavyweights. However, the assembly bypolls today for 5 seats spread across four states will be keenly watched when the results are out on June 23 - as this will be the first electoral contest post Pahalgam terror attack and Operation Sindoor - India's military response that included air and ground strikes on terror camps in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK).Today's bypolls include two assembly seats in Gujarat, one each in Kerala, West Bengal and Punjab. The fact that assembly elections are due in two of these states - Kerala and West Bengal early next year - makes this mini electoral contest all the more interesting.Congress, which has huge stakes in Kerala, has already announced that the Nilambur by-election is the semi-final before the 2026 assembly polls. Kerala LoP and Congress MLA VD Satheesan has claimed that victory in the bypoll will mark the beginning of the United Democratic Front's (UDF) return to the state.""This is a political contest, a direct fight between the UDF and the LDF. It is the semi-final leading up to the 2026 Assembly elections, and we are confident of winning by a significant margin. We see this as an opportunity to hold the Pinarayi government accountable, a government that has been in power for the past nine years,"" Satheesan said.Congress got a boost with Wayanad MP Priyanka Gandhi Vadra joining the campaign to secure a win for the party.Congress, which has lost two consecutive elections in the state to the Left Democratic Front, will be keen to settle scores and return to power. However, given party's choppy relations with Shashi Tharoor, who is MP from Thiruvananthpuram, and a resurgent BJP going all out to spread its influence in the state, the road to power will not be easy for the grand old party.Moving over to West Bengal - another state where assembly elections are due early next year, the Kaliganj assembly bypoll in the state's Nadia district is shaping up to be a triangular contest among the TMC, BJP, and Congress-Left alliance.The electoral discourse here in the run up to the bypoll has been dominated by identity politics, post-Murshidabad riot anxieties and a nationalist surge after Operation Sindoor.The bypoll is also being closely watched due to the recent Murshidabad riots in which three persons were killed and several people rendered homeless, discontent over the SSC recruitment scam, and the changing electoral arithmetic since the 2024 general elections.In Kaliganj, identity and legacy remain central to the electoral battle. While the TMC has accused the BJP of communal polarisation, the Murshidabad riots and sporadic communal skirmishes in parts of the state have only added fuel to the saffron party's campaign in its bid to break the Trinamool Congress stronghold on this minority-dominated seat.The Ludhiana West by-election, set to take place on Thursday, is shaping up to be a high-stakes political showdown that could redefine the urban political narrative in Punjab. While the seat itself is just one among many, the implications of this bypoll stretch far beyond its borders.For the ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), the contest is a crucial opportunity to reaffirm its dominance in Punjab following the death of its sitting MLA, Gurpreet Bassi Gogi, in January. Retaining the seat would help AAP maintain its urban clout and narrative of continuity.Facing off against AAP is the Congress, looking to claw back a constituency it once firmly held—six times in the past. A win here would signal a revival of urban support for the party, which has struggled to reclaim lost ground in the state since AAP’s rise.However, the contest isn’t only a two-way battle. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is also keenly watching the outcome to assess its urban appeal in Punjab, a state where it remains on the fringes post its breakup with the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD).For the SAD, the stakes are equally high. The bypoll is being viewed as a test of leadership for party president Sukhbir Singh Badal, whose party is still trying to bounce back from a string of electoral defeats. A respectable showing here could breathe some life into the party’s flagging morale.By-elections in Gujarat’s Visavadar and Kadi assembly constituencies will be held on Thursday, with the BJP, Congress, and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) locked in a three-cornered battle in both seats. Voting will take place from 7 am to 8 pm, and results will be declared on June 23, according to election officials.The Visavadar seat in Junagadh, vacant since former AAP MLA Bhupendra Bhayani defected to the BJP in December 2023, has attracted high-profile candidates. The BJP has fielded Kirit Patel, Congress has nominated Nitin Ranpariya, while AAP has placed its former Gujarat president Gopal Italia, in the contest.In Kadi (Mehsana district), a seat reserved for Scheduled Caste (SC) candidates and lying vacant since BJP MLA Karsan Solanki’s death in February, the ruling party has fielded Rajendra Chavda. Congress has turned to Ramesh Chavda, a former MLA who won the seat in 2012, while AAP is banking on Jagdish Chavda.Polling will take place through Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) at 294 stations in each constituency. Gujarat government has also declared a public holiday in both constituencies on polling day to encourage voter participation.","Assembly bypolls today for 5 seats spread across four states will be keenly watched.

Is Gisele Bundchen over Tom Brady for good? Her recent move has fans convinced



Tom Brady has always worn his heart on his sleeve when it comes to family. This past Mother's Day, the NFL GOAT took a moment to publicly appreciate his ex-wife, Gisele Bündchen, for her role as a dedicated mother. His social media tribute described her as “strong,” “compassionate,” and “amazing,” praising her efforts in raising their two children, Benjamin and Vivian. For many, it was a reminder of Brady's commitment to celebrating the people who shaped his personal life, even if they are no longer together.However, when Father’s Day rolled around just weeks later, fans were taken aback by Bündchen’s silence. Not a single post or mention of Tom Brady appeared on her social media. While celebrities often choose to keep their personal expressions private, this noticeable absence sparked curiosity—and in some corners, criticism.Tom Brady’s heartfelt tribute had raised expectations of a reciprocal gesture. Instead, Bündchen’s pages remained focused on her personal life, which now includes her new family dynamic with jiu-jitsu trainer Joaquim Valente. Her most recent family-centered post revolved around her daughter Vivian’s birthday, capturing her happiness in a new chapter.This, for many fans, signaled a stronger desire to close the chapter on her former life with Brady and fully embrace her new one.Meanwhile, Brady continued to show the world that family is central to who he is. On Father's Day , he honored his own father, Tom Brady Sr., with a message that read, ""It's important to appreciate the people who shape us. No one's done more for me than my dad."" The tribute underscored the NFL legend’s consistent public display of gratitude, not just as a father but also as a son.The sharp contrast between Brady’s open expression and Gisele Bündchen’s silence triggered waves of speculation online. While some believed Gisele was simply setting boundaries, others viewed it as a sign of lingering tension. Social media comment sections quickly filled with polarized takes—some defending her right to privacy, others accusing her of being dismissive despite Brady’s previous gesture.Publications like The Sun and Newsweek also weighed in, noting how fans interpreted the silence as a possible reflection of a deeper divide between the ex-couple. Still, it's worth noting that neither Brady nor Bündchen has publicly addressed the situation, allowing the speculation to grow.According to People, Gisele’s romance with Valente blossomed slowly and quietly. “They started out as great friends first. She’s very private about this and wanted to keep it quiet while they got to know each other,” a source revealed. “He was a huge comfort for Gisele while she went through her divorce.

“Stepping into psychological warfare”: NFL legend warns Bill Belichick as he is risking UNC career for ‘inappropriate’ relationship with Jordon Hudson,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/stepping-into-psychological-warfare-nfl-legend-warns-bill-belichick-as-he-is-risking-unc-career-for-inappropriate-relationship-with-jordon-hudson/articleshow/121922951.cms,"Bill Belichick's relationship with Jordon Hudson is sparking concerns about his potential involvement UNC (Getty Images)

Bill Belichick’s romance could trigger ‘psychological warfare’ at UNC

Bill Belichick's relationship with Jordon Hudson is raising concerns about his potential involvement with a college program, specifically . Former NFL player Shawne Merriman warned this situation could lead to ""psychological warfare,"" potentially jeopardizing Belichick's reputation and a team's focus due to off-field distractions.The whispers surrounding celebrated NFL coach Bill Belichick and his purported connection with former cheerleader Jordon Hudson are now casting a shadow over his prospective engagement with a university athletic program, particularly at the University of North Carolina.The spotlight intensified considerably after Shawne Merriman, a former NFL linebacker and an ACC icon, issued a stark caution: if Belichick isn't careful, this personal situation could very well devolve into ""psychological warfare.""Merriman's commentary on the Belichick-Hudson situation was unambiguous during a recent podcast appearance. The former San Diego Chargers standout articulated clearly what he believes is at stake: ""He's stepping into psychological warfare now, man. That's going to cost him dearly. That's not a win.""Shawne Merriman’s warning exceeds mere media sensationalism. With Belichick being considered for future advisory or mentorship roles at the collegiate level, especially at UNC where his ties run deep, such personal narratives could become significant impediments, affecting recruitment, team concentration, and his standing with younger athletes and staff.At 72, Belichick holds an esteemed position in NFL history, celebrated for his precise approach and unwavering commitment to football fundamentals. However, his name has recently graced headlines of a vastly different nature. His alleged romantic involvement with Jordon Hudson—a woman nearly five decades his junior—has ignited a flurry of tabloid speculation and widespread social media discourse.For a coach aspiring to transition into a new capacity within college football, potentially as a consultant or executive, such personal entanglements risk overshadowing his distinguished professional legacy. Universities, especially high-profile programs like UNC, generally prefer to maintain pristine reputations when enlisting prominent figures to guide young athletes or contribute to team development.Whether Belichick ultimately aligns with UNC or another collegiate program remains uncertain. Yet, as Merriman’s comments imply, the mere presence of personal controversy, even if unconfirmed, can be potent enough to create significant hurdles in the fiercely competitive realm of college athletics.Bill Belichick may have stepped away from the NFL sidelines for the moment, but if his ambition is to forge a new path at the collegiate level, adeptly navigating public perception will prove just as crucial as his mastery of Xs and Os.Also Read: “Biggest killer”: Tom Brady's ex-wife Gisele Bündchen faced backlash after risking their baby’s life in reckless ATV joyride with no helmet Only time will tell if Belichick can successfully navigate these personal waters while building a new chapter in his legendary coaching career at the collegiate level.","Bill belichick's relationship with jordon hudson is raising concerns about his potential involvement with a college program.

Yashwant Varma : Probe panel junks both theories offered by Varma in his defence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/probe-panel-junks-both-theories-offered-by-varma-in-his-defence/articleshow/121961327.cms,"Yashwant Varma (File photo)

NEW DELHI: The inquiry committee on the Justice Varma cash case has rejected both theories put forth by the HC judge in his defence - that the cash could have been planted in the storeroom of his residence and that the storeroom was set afire by an act of arson to implicate him.The committee, constituted on March 22 by then CJI Sanjiv Khanna, comprised seasoned constitutional court judges - Punjab and Haryana Chief Justice Sheel Nagu, Himachal Pradesh CJ G S Sandhawalia and Karnataka HC's Justice Anu Sivaraman.It examined 55 witnesses, including Justice Varma, which were video recorded, to confirm every report of TOI on the sensational controversy. The panel's report also referred to TOI's March 21 story breaking the news.Also read: SC panel proposes impeachment of Justice Yashwant Varma - What probe report said Rejecting Justice Varma's defence - that ""someone could have planted the cash in the storeroom in his absence as it was accessible to everyone"" - the panel in its 64-page report said, ""The overall control and the permission to have access to the storeroom was undeniably with Justice Varma.""This should remove all doubts about the launch of proceedings for removal of the HC judge in the monsoon session of Parliament beginning on July 21.The panel cited the fact that the judge was in control of the Tughlaq Crescent bungalow to reject his defence of conspiracy and arson - essentially that someone with mala fide intention planted the cash at his official bungalow and then set off the fire. Referring to statements of security personnel, the panel noted that no one could access the house without the permission of family members and ""therefore, it's well nigh impossible for currency to be planted in the storeroom of a sitting judge, which is being monitored by static 1+4 guard and a PSO stationed at the gate at all time, apart from the fact that the house abounds with a large number of old and trusted domestic servants with over six staff quarters"".The committee also disregarded the theory of ""arson"" - ""a criminal act of deliberately setting fire to property"" - belatedly flagged by Justice Varma. Members of the panel said that by the judge's own initial version, the fire was triggered by a short circuit, besides noting that he did not follow up by registering a police complaint.Significantly, the panel also underlined that the judge had quietly accepted his transfer to Allahabad HC, in the wake of publication of a report in TOI. ""The categorical acceptance on March 20, immediately, without any demur and, respectfully accepting the decision of repatriation to Allahabad would, in normal circumstances, only be done after discussion with family members at least and after an attempt to find out the reason for transfer, having served in Delhi HC for the last three years,"" the report said.""It is his categorical case that he has served diligently for a decade without any complaint. Thus, he would have liked to find out the reason for the transfer,"" it added.In conclusion, the inquiry panel said, ""In the absence of any plausible explanation coming from Justice Varma or his family members or, for that matter, any other witness, this committee is left with no option but to hold that the trust reposed in him was belied by him by allowing highly suspicious material in the shape of piles of currency notes to be stashed in the storeroom. Whether this stashing was done with tacit or explicit consent of Justice Varma or his family members is of little significance in the face of the larger concept of breach of public trust and probity expected of the high constitutional office held by Justice Varma. ""The committee repeatedly termed the post-cash discovery conduct of Justice Varma as ""unnatural"" and ""illogical"" and said, ""Keeping in view the direct and electronic evidence on record, this committee is firmly of the view that there is sufficient substance in the allegations raised in the letter of CJI (Sanjiv Khanna) dated March 22 and the misconduct found proved is serious enough to call for initiation of proceedings for removal of Justice Yashwant Varma. ""The committee also found it odd that the judge, who cut short his vacation in the Satpura forests after having been informed of the fire, did not deem it fit to visit the site until March 15 when the principal private secretary to the Delhi HC chief justice came for an inspection.The committee also stated that Justice Varma's daughter tried to dissuade firemen from entering the bungalow by telling them that the flames had already been controlled.The report said Justice Varma's private secretary, Delhi HC employee Rajinder Singh Karki, frantically tried to reach the judge on phone from the residence. ""He had a detailed conversation with Justice Varma at 1.23am on March 15"" when the judge asked him to stay back at the residence, the report said.It was Karki who instructed firemen not to mention burnt cash in their report, the panel said. It also found from the security guard's statement that Karki and a trusted servant, Mohd Rahil ""were busy supervising the cleaning up job after the fire wagons had left"".During questioning by the committee, Karki entangled himself in contradictory statements, the report said.The committee was also surprised to find that CCTV footage had been wiped out from the hard disc between March 15 and March 25, when the inquiry started.","The committee, constituted on march 22 by then cji sanjiv khanna, comprised seasoned constitutional court judges. It examined 55 witnesses, including justice varma, which were video recorded.

A serious legal matter involving NFL player Jimmie Ward has come to light. Though his legal team is pushing back, the safety for the Houston Texans is facing troubling allegations. Many facts are still to be verified; the narrative is still evolving. Fans and the general public are left asking what truly occurred for now and what is next for the player.At his Magnolia, Texas, residence on June 12, 2025, Houston Texans player Jimmie Ward, 33, was arrested.

Prior to signing a two-year contract with the Houston Texans in the 2023 offseason, he spent nine seasons with the 49ers.On Instagram, his supporters know him as his middle name, ""Neko. "" Thus far, the Houston Texans have not released a thorough public comment.

NEW DELHI: Air India will suspend flights between Amritsar & London Gatwick (LGW) along those between Goa (Mopa) & LGW and Delhi & Nairobi, along with reducing frequencies on some sectors across its long haul network that includes North America, UK, Europe, Far East and Australia, from Saturday (June 21) for different dates until at least July 15, 2025.This is part of the temporary 15% wide body (Boeing 787 & B777) flight cuts the airline had announced Thursday. But as it comes at the fag end of the peak summer holiday season, it will impact a large number of passengers.Due to enhanced checks on the Boeing 777s, frequencies of North America sectors on which AI is the only direct operator have been cut. So now Delhi and San Francisco will have seven weekly flights instead of 10 earlier; Delhi and Toronto will go down from 13 weekly to 7 weekly; Delhi & Chicago will drop from seven to three; Delhi & Washington (Dulles) from five to three and Delhi & Vancouver from seven to five. Between India and North America, AI is the largest operator of direct flights. United and American have only a daily between Delhi & New York.Europe routes will also see frequency cuts. Delhi & London Heathrow (LHR) will go down from 24 to 22 weekly; Delhi & Paris from 14 to 12 and Bangalore & LHR from seven to six (see box). Australia, Tokyo and Seoul will also see temporary cuts.Apart from aircraft shortage due to multiple factors, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation’s temporary one-month dispensation to AI for making its pilots fly longer due to Pakistan airspace closures that required longer detours ended on June 12.So AI’s pilot requirement for the longer west flights will also increase. “These reductions will be effective from June 21 and last until at least July 15, 2025…. arise from the decision to voluntary undertake enhanced pre-flight safety checks, as well as accommodate additional flight durations arising from airspace closures in the Middle East. The objective is to restore schedule stability and minimising last-minute inconvenience to passengers,” AI said in a statement, adding, “AI apologises to passengers affected by these curtailments, and is proactively offer(ing) re-accommodation on alternative flights, complimentary rescheduling or full refunds as per their preference.”• Delhi-Nairobi1 (AI961/962) – 4x weekly flights• Amritsar-London (Gatwick) (AI169/170) – 3x weekly flights• Goa (Mopa)-London (Gatwick) (AI145/146) – 3x weekly flights• Delhi-Toronto: Reduced from 13x weekly to 7x weekly• Delhi-Vancouver: Reduced from 7x weekly to 5x weekly• Delhi-San Francisco: Reduced from 10x weekly to 7x weekly• Delhi-Chicago: Reduced from 7x weekly to 3x weekly• Delhi-Washington (Dulles): Reduced from 5x weekly to 3x weekly• Delhi-London (Heathrow): Reduced from 24x weekly to 22x weekly• Bengaluru-London (Heathrow): Reduced from 7x weekly to 6x weekly• Amritsar-Birmingham and Delhi Birmingham: Reduced from 3x weekly to 2x weekly• Delhi-Paris: Reduced from 14x weekly to 12x weekly• Delhi-Milan: Reduced from 7x weekly to 4x weekly• Delhi-Copenhagen: Reduced from 5x weekly to 3x weekly• Delhi-Vienna: Reduced from 4x weekly to 3x weekly• Delhi-Amsterdam: Reduced from 7x weekly to 5x weekly• Delhi-Melbourne and Delhi-Sydney: Reduced from 7x weekly to 5x weekly• Delhi-Tokyo (Haneda): Reduced from 7x weekly to 6x weekly• Delhi-Seoul (Incheon): Reduced from 5x weekly to 4x weekly2(Source: AI)","Air india will suspend flights between amritsar & london gatwick, along with those between goa (mopa) & lgw and delhi & nairobi.

Airports have been told to work closely with airlines to ensure that passenger’s issues are resolved promptly and at the ground level.

Availability of food, water, and seating facilities at terminals must be ensured, specifically during delays or congestions.

Adequate staff should be stationed at key touchpoints to proactively handle passenger grievances.

Airport directors were asked to provide full support to airlines experiencing operational disruptions, including help with gate changes and other logistical arrangements.

To ensure a safe and secure airport environment, Airport Directors were instructed to strengthen wildlife hazard management, including measures to deter birds and stray animals.

The ministry of civil aviation launched a comprehensive review of aviation safety, airline performance, and passenger support systems across the country on Thursday, in the wake of the recent Air India incident near Ahmedabad.Civil aviation minister Ram Mohan Naidu Kinjarapu chaired a detailed video conference with airport directors nationwide to assess how airports are handling disruptions caused by weather changes, post-accident inspections, and airspace closures linked to geopolitical tensions.The minister also held a high-level meeting with Air India’s chairman and managing director to address three major concerns: maintaining operational continuity, improving transparency in public communication, and prioritising passenger safety.Due to ongoing conflicts in the Middle East and night flying restrictions in Europe, Air India is experiencing reduced aircraft availability. The airline has decided to scale down some operations temporarily and restructure flight schedules. Passengers affected by cancellations or changes will be rebooked or offered full refunds.Air India has been urged to strengthen its ground coordination and improve the clarity and empathy of its communication with passengers.Similar meetings were held with senior management from SpiceJet, IndiGo, and Akasa on June 18 and 19, where the minister reviewed fleet readiness, safety protocols, passenger experience, and communication strategies with all carriers. He further announced that such operational reviews would now become a regular practice.Meanwhile, the aircraft accident investigation bureau (AAIB) began a formal probe into the Air India flight crash near Ahmedabad. A multi-disciplinary team began investigations on June 12, and recovered both black box sets, the Digital Flight Data Recorder and Cockpit Voice Recorder, from the site. International teams from the NTSB and aircraft manufacturers have also joined the probe as per ICAO guidelines.The ministry confirmed that recovery work and evidence collection have been completed, and further analysis is underway. It reiterated its commitment to transparency, saying that the AAIB will follow all safety and investigative protocols.Addressing speculation around the black box being sent abroad for decoding, the ministry clarified that any decision on the location for analysis would be taken only after evaluating technical and security concerns.The ministry also urged all stakeholders to avoid speculation on such sensitive issues and to allow the investigation to continue with the seriousness and professionalism it deserves.","Airports have been told to work closely with airlines to ensure that passenger’s issues are resolved promptly and at the ground level.
