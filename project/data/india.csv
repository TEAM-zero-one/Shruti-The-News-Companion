‘Imported rotten meat’ sparks outrage in Kashmir,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/imported-rotten-meat-sparks-outrage-in-kashmir/articleshow/123247461.cms,"SRINAGAR: J&K is in the grip of a food safety scare after officials seized more than 11,600kg of “imported rotten meat” from warehouses, eateries and shops across Kashmir valley, triggering a storm of halal concerns and rumours.The seizures, excluding poultry, were made over the past week during surprise inspections that uncovered illegal storage and gross violations of safety rules. Images of decayed meat on social media spurred calls to boycott animal meat in restaurants.Religious leaders joined the outcry, questioning how such supplies had gone unchecked for years and whether they were even permissible under Islamic law.Kashmir’s grand mufti Nasir-ul-Islam urged people to avoid animal meat dishes such as tikka, kebab, biryani and momo in eateries until the matter is resolved. “The rumour mills have it that the meat could be that of stray dogs,” he said.Kashmir’s chief priest Mirwaiz Umar Farooq condemned the alleged supply of unsafe food as “a betrayal of public trust”, warning it could involve carrion — strictly forbidden in Islam.CM Omar Abdullah convened a meeting Monday to review the enforcement drive, urging residents to report concerns to authorities and avoid taking the law into their own hands.“The grave problem appears to have remained unchecked and unnoticed for too long. The unscrupulous elements have played with the health and lives of people. This has to stop,” he said.Food safety commissioner Smita Sethi said the seized meat has been destroyed. In one case, inspectors found an unregistered cold storage unit in Srinagar’s Zukura area allegedly hoarding imported meat without power backup. “We didn’t find much in other areas because people had already dumped it in rivers,” she said.Sethi said frozen meat imports into J&K are legal, but the seized consignments lacked expiry and packaging dates, import source details and proper labelling. Many storage sites allegedly failed to maintain the mandatory –18°C temperature. Using inspections, smell checks and mobile labs, authorities confirmed much of it was “unfit and rotten”.No FIR has been filed yet, but Sethi said investigations will lead to inquiries against those involved.CM Abdullah ordered “exemplary punitive action” under the Food Safety and Standards Act, including criminal proceedings for serious violators.“No meat should be sold and used without proper clearance,” he said, while directing that entry-point check posts and testing labs be set up at Lakhanpur and Qazigund, and district-level food testing facilities established beyond Srinagar and Jammu.","Officials seize more than 11,600kg of ‘imported rotten meat’ from warehouses, eateries and shops across kashmir valley.

NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Monday said that constitutionally, high court judges are on a par with its judges. SC has no administrative control over HCs and their judges, but is duty-bound to protect them when they face scandalous allegations, a three-judge bench headed by B R Gavai said.The apex court passed this order while asking a Telangana neta, who had made scandalous allegations against an HC judge, to tender unconditional apology to the judge.The politician had made the allegations against the judge in a petition seeking transfer of his case from Telangana HC to Bombay HC's Nagpur bench.The lawyers who signed the petition were also asked by SC to apologise to the judge.Dictating the order in the open court, CJI Gavai said, ""When scandalous allegations are made against HC judges, it is the duty of SC to protect them. We notice that now-a-days it has become a trait with lawyers to criticise HC judges. It has also become a trait in matters involving influential political figures. It has become a habit of politicians to allege that he would not get justice before the HC concerned and seek transfer of his petition outside the state. Such practices cannot be allowed to be continued.""Elaborating on the position of HCs and their judges in the three-tier justice delivery system, the CJI-led bench also comprising Justices R Vinod Chandran and A S Chandurkar, said, ""HC judges are constitutional court judges and enjoy the same immunity and privileges as SC judges.Under the constitutional scheme, judges of HCs are not inferior to SC judges."" ""Though as an appellate court, SC can reverse, uphold or modify HC judgments, it has no administrative control over HCs or judges of HCs,"" the bench said.It said that a constitution bench of SC had categorically ruled that not only the petitioner, who makes the scandalous allegations against a judge but the lawyers who draft the petition containing these allegations and file it in court are also liable for contempt of court.The bench said the politician and the lawyers have tendered unconditional apology to SC. ""In our view since the allegations are made against the HC judge, it will be appropriate for the contemnors to tender such apology to the HC judge."" SC indicated that on tendering of unconditional apology, the HC would not proceed to take coercive action against the petitioner and his lawyers.","Cji: duty of sc to protect judges from false allegations.

'Suspecting weather radar malfunction, they diverted to Chennai': DGCA







'Heart-stopping moment'

BJP's reaction



NEW DELHI: Air India on Monday issued a clarification over its Thiruvananthapuram–Delhi flight AI2455 after senior Congress leader and MP KC Venugopal, who was on board, described it as a ""harrowing journey. "" The airline said the diversion to Chennai was a ""precautionary"" measure due to a suspected technical snag and poor weather, rejecting Venugopal’s claim that another aircraft on the runway had forced the plane to abort its landing.Venugopal dismissed the airline’s explanation, saying, ""Air India is lying"" and calling for an investigation. ""There should be an inquiry into the issue. An unfortunate incident happened yesterday. It was announced by the pilot that there was another aircraft on the runway when we were going to land. I spoke to DGCA as well. Let them have an inquiry. Air India is lying…"" the Congress MP said.In its statement on X addressed to Venugopal, Air India said: ""Dear Mr Venugopal, we would like to clarify that the diversion to Chennai was precautionary due to a suspected technical issue and poor weather conditions.A go-around was instructed by Chennai ATC during the first attempted landing at Chennai airport, not because of the presence of another aircraft on the runway. Our pilots are well-trained to handle such situations, and in this case, they followed standard procedures throughout the flight. We understand that such an experience can be unsettling and regret the inconvenience the diversion may have caused to you. However, safety is always our priority. Thank you for your understanding.""Meanwhile, DGCA released a detailed statement on Air India's diversion: ""On Aug 10, 2025, Air India A320 aircraft VT-TNL was scheduled to operate flight AI2455 (TRV-Delhi) with scheduled time of departure as 7.15 pm. Due to late arrival of aircraft from Delhi, aircraft departed TRV at 8.04 pm. During flight, the aircraft encountered moderate turbulent conditions. Crew observed that weather information depicted on the weather radar was not accurate. Suspecting weather radar malfunction, they diverted to Chennai.""Earlier, Venugopal had posted on X: ""What began as a delayed departure turned into a harrowing journey. Shortly after take-off, we were hit by unprecedented turbulence. About an hour later, the Captain announced a flight signal fault and diverted to Chennai. For nearly two hours, we circled the airport awaiting clearance to land, until a heart-stopping moment during our first attempt – another aircraft was reportedly on the same runway. In that split second, the Captain’s quick decision to pull up saved every life on board. The flight landed safely on the second attempt.""He added, ""We were saved by skill and luck. Passenger safety cannot depend on luck.""Following the diversion, Air India arranged another Airbus A320neo (VT-TQE) to fly passengers from Chennai to Delhi as AI2455. The TRV–Delhi flight, which normally takes 3.5 hours and is scheduled to depart at 7:15 pm, left Thiruvananthapuram at 8 pm on Sunday, landed in Chennai at 10:39 pm, and resumed the journey at 1:40 am, finally reaching Delhi at about 4 am.Reacting to the incident, BJP IT cell chief Amit Malviya called the matter ""extremely serious"" and flagged the contradiction between Venugopal’s account and Air India’s clarification.""If senior Congress leader KC Venugopal claims an Air India flight had to abort landing in Chennai because another aircraft was on the runway and the airline immediately contradicts him, then one of them is misrepresenting facts. Aviation safety is paramount, and social media posts from supposedly responsible people cannot go unscrutinised. If the allegation is true, Chennai ATC and Air India have much to answer for. If not, Mr Venugopal should face consequences, including being put on a no-fly list for spreading falsehoods,"" Malviya said.","Senior congress leader and mp kc venugopal, who was on board, described it as a ""harrowing journey"" air india issued a clarification over its thiruvananthapuram–delhi flight ai2455.

NEW DELHI: Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut on Monday wrote to Union home minister Amit Shah seeking clarity on the whereabouts and health of former Vice President Jagdeep Dhankhar, who resigned unexpectedly on July 21 citing health reasons.In his letter, Raut expressed concern that there has been “no information” about Dhankhar since his resignation and urged the home minister to “provide genuine information” on his safety.Raut recalled that on the morning of July 21, Dhankhar “appeared normal” while presiding over the Rajya Sabha’s Monsoon session and even engaged in a verbal exchange with Leader of the Opposition Mallikarjun Kharge before adjourning proceedings.However, by 6pm the same day, his resignation was announced, a move Raut described as “shocking.” He wrote: “From July 21 till today, there has been no information about the whereabouts of our Vice President. What is his current location? How is his health? There is no clarity on these matters.”The Shiv Sena leader said attempts by Rajya Sabha members to contact Dhankhar had failed, and rumours were circulating in Delhi that the former vice president had been “confined to his residence” and “reportedly not safe.”He warned that some MPs were considering a habeas corpus petition in the Supreme Court, but he had decided first to approach Shah: “Before knocking on the doors of the Supreme Court I thought it to be prudent to seek this information from you. ”Raut’s intervention follows similar calls from Independent MP Kapil Sibal, who questioned the silence around Dhankhar’s whereabouts. Sibal said he had “never heard of a ‘laapataa [missing] vice president’,” and noted that even Dhankhar’s family and close associates had offered no update. “The home ministry must know where Dhankhar is and must reveal it,” he said, warning that such secrecy “should not happen in a democracy. ”Dhankhar, 74, resigned midterm as vice president, just two years after assuming office in August 2022.

BENGALURU: Fresh cracks have emerged within governing Congress in Karnataka as senior functionaries have openly expressed dissent over former party MP and former Congress president Rahul Gandhi 's recent claims of ""vote theft"" during the 2024 Lok Sabha elections.Cooperation minister KN Rajanna — a known supporter of chief minister Siddaramaiah — has again stirred controversy with remarks that have drawn a sharp response from deputy chief minister DK Shivakumar's supporters.In response to a rally led by Rahul, Lok Sabha opposition leader, in Bengaluru last week, where he accused the Election Commission of India (ECI) of bias and blamed discrepancies in voter lists for the party's defeat in key constituencies like Bangalore Central, Rajanna pushed back by suggesting that the party must also take responsibility.""One should remember that voter lists were revised when our own govt was at the helm,"" Rajanna told reporters. ""Why did our party turn a blind eye then? It is true that there are irregularities, but it is insulting for us that it happened right under our nose.""Reminding party colleagues that the ECI had invited objections after publishing draft electoral rolls, Rajanna said: ""It becomes our responsibility to act in timely fashion on issues like electoral rolls.We should have raised objections then, especially in the case of Mahadevapura where there are many instances of malpractice. After keeping silent when we were supposed to talk, we are talking about it now.""As expected, his comments have not gone down well with members of Shivakumar's camp, who accused Rajanna and other seniors of acting against party interests. The internal tensions come amid a larger ongoing struggle for the CM post between supporters of Siddaramaiah and Shivakumar.Adding to Congress' concerns, food and civil supplies minister KH Muniyappa, speaking in a party forum, urged the state leadership to strengthen its grassroots presence ahead of upcoming zilla and taluk panchayat elections. He emphasised BJP's growing influence, saying Congress has failed to ""control BJP.""Shivakumar loyalists accused Rajanna and others of attempting to destabilise the party and said they will escalate the matter to the party high command.""The state govt has decided to investigate the issue of vote theft and it has asked the Advocate General to submit a report,"" said HD Ranganath, Kunigal MLA. ""Talking negatively against our own party and govt even before the investigation is over is unpardonable. The high command must take serious note of it end such anti-party activities.""Meanwhile, former Mahadevapura MLA Aravind Limbavali of BJP, seized the moment to bolster the opposition's narrative.""Rahul should open his eyes at least now, as his own party members are reiterating what we have said. I will soon make a powerpoint presentation on this in New Delhi,"" Limbavali said.While addressing the issue of voter list discrepancies on Friday, he avoided mentioning Shivakumar's Kanakapura constituency but pointed fingers at Siddaramaiah's Varuna seat and other constituencies held by his loyalists — including Chamarajpet (BZ Zameer Ahmed Khan), Gandhinagar (Dinesh Gundu Rao), Sandur (E Annapoorna), and BTM Layout (Ramalinga Reddy).","Fresh cracks have emerged within governing congress in karnataka.

NEW DELHI: Delhi police on Monday detained animal rights activists, rescuers, caregivers, and dog lovers protesting at India Gate against the Supreme Court’s order to move all stray dogs in Delhi-NCR to shelters within eight weeks.Earlier in the day, in a suo motu case on dog bite incidents, the Supreme Court directed the Delhi government to start picking up stray dogs from all localities, house them in shelters, and not release them back onto streets, colonies, or public places.The court said shelters must be set up to accommodate around 5,000 dogs and staffed with enough personnel for sterilisation and immunisation.Calling the situation “extremely grim,” the bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and R. Mahadevan stressed, ""We are issuing these directions keeping larger public interest in mind,"" further adding that infants, young children should not at any cost fall prey to stray dog bites leading to rabies.PETA India Advocacy Associate Shaurya Agrawal criticised the ruling, calling it “impractical, illogical and… according to the animal birth control rules, also illegal.”He said Delhi has around 10 lakh stray dogs and housing them all in shelters would be impossible.“This is going to create chaos and problems. Removal of dogs is inhumane, is cruelty in itself, and the conditions within the shelters are going to be very bad...We are exploring all our legal avenues.

It was prepared when our own government was in power. At that time, was everyone just sitting quietly with eyes closed? These irregularities did take place — that’s the truth. There is nothing false in this. These irregularities happened right in front of our eyes — we should feel ashamed. ""The leader further said that at a time when the party should have filed objections, ""it kept quiet"". ""We didn’t take care of it at the time. That’s why we must be alert in the future....In Mahadevapura, there was indeed fraud. One person was registered in three different places and voted in all three.

Karnataka duputy CM DK Shivakumar had said Rajanna was ""totally at fault"" and that the party's leadership will reply to his remarks.Before his ouster, Rajanna had courted controversy by questioning deputy chief minister DK Shivakumar's dominance, demanding three more deputy chief ministers — one each from the Lingayat, SC/ST, and minority communities.He had also expressed interest in becoming the Karnataka Congress president, a post held by Shivakumar for over five years.Meanwhile, the Rahul Gandhi vs Election Commission tension escalated as he declined to sign a sworn declaration backing his ""vote-theft"" allegations, despite repeated calls from the poll body.","Senior congress mla kn rajanna said he will travel to delhi to meet the party’s top leadership. In a u-turn, he also backed rahul gandhi's ""vote theft"" claim. Rajanna was removed from the cabinet after his critical remarks about his own party. He expressed concern that they had failed to address alleged lapses in the electoral rolls before the election.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123241610,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1613619,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Meet ‘Hercules’, Asia’s Largest Tiger Caught on Camera in Uttarakhand | 7 Feet, 300 Kgs

N EW DELHI: Two Bengal tiger cubs have died at the Delhi zoo in the past three days, officials said on Monday, just a week after the birth of six cubs, the largest litter in two decades.The cubs were born to a seven-year-old tigress, Aditi, on August 4. This was her first litter since arriving from the Gorewada rescue centre in Nagpur.The smallest cub in the litter died inside the enclosure on the morning of August 8. Another, too weak to feed, was moved to the zoo hospital on August 9, but died the following night despite treatment.Zoo director Sanjeet Kumar said Aditi is feeding and caring for the remaining four cubs, who are under 24-hour CCTV and manual monitoring.“Supplements are being given to the mother to support milk production. The remaining cubs are active and feeding well,” Kumar said as quoted by PTI.Before this litter, the zoo had six white tigers and seven Royal Bengal tigers. In 2023, tigress Siddhi from Gorewada gave birth to five cubs, the first Royal Bengal tiger birth at the zoo in nearly 18 years, but only two survived. The last litter of six was in 2005, when two survived. The most recent white tiger birth was in 2022, when tigress Sita delivered three cubs, of which two survived. Officials say survival rates in large litters are often low.The Delhi Zoo, which has housed tigers since its opening in 1959, is recognised under the Central Zoo Authority’s conservation breeding programme as a centre for tiger conservation and breeding.","Two bengal tiger cubs have died at the delhi zoo in the past three days.

For nearly two hours, we circled the airport awaiting clearance to land, until a heart-stopping moment during our first attempt - another aircraft was reportedly on the same runway.

"Army recruitment must be merit-based, gender-neutral: Supreme Court",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/army-recruitment-must-be-merit-based-gender-neutral-supreme-court/articleshow/123246918.cms,"NEW DELHI: When women officers can fly Rafales and can be a part of UN peacekeeping missions in combat zones like Syria, Lebanon and Israel, then why can't they be deployed in counter-insurgency and counter-terror forces or get attached to infantry/artillery units in times of emergency, the Supreme Court asked on Monday while ruling that recruitment in streams where women are allowed must be merit-based and gender-neutral with no restriction on entry of women candidates.A bench of Justices Dipankar Datta and Manmohan found fault in Army's policy of preparing separate merit lists for male and female candidates to recruit three female and six male candidates for Short Service Commission course for law graduates for Judge Advocate General (JAG) branch and said it was discriminatory as it put restrictions on female candidates. It said the practice of fixing a ceiling on recruitment of female candidates has the effect of perpetuating the status quo, which has been historically discriminatory to women candidates. There are 10 streams in the Army where women are eligible for appointment as SSC officers.""This court is of the view that once the Army permits women officers to join any corps, department or branch forming a part of the regular Army, it cannot impose an additional restriction with regard to 'extent of induction' of women officers in the said corps, department or branch - as Section 12 of the Army Act, 1950, does not empower it to do so,"" Justice Manmohan, who wrote the verdict for the bench, said.The court allowed the plea of a woman who contended that she scored more than her male counterparts but was denied because only three females were to be selected.The Centre and the Army took the defence that JAG officers are primarily combatant personnel and that was the reason for restriction on entry of females but the court refused to accept the plea and said if it was accepted, then it would lead to exclusion of women officers from all streams of the Army.""It does not stand to reason that when women officers like Captain Ojaswita Shree of the elite Parachute Air Defence Unit, Major Dwipannita Kalita of highly specialised airborne medical unit of the Indian Army and Flight Lieutenant Shivangi Singh (pilot of Rafale jet) of the Indian Air Force can operate behind enemy lines with all expected risks, why women officers in times of emergency cannot be deployed for counter-insurgency or in counter-terror forces or attached to infantry/artillery units. This is supported by the fact that the Indian Army entrusts women officers with complex tasks, such as transporting convoys of 30 to 50 vehicles through militant-prone areas in Leh, Srinagar, Udhampur and the north-east,"" the bench said.","Women officers can fly rafales and can be a part of un peacekeeping missions in combat zones like syria, lebanon and israel.

These properties are collectively estimated to be worth several hundred crores of rupees at current market prices.Vadra's statement was recorded at the ED headquarters here on April 15 in connection with a 3.5 acres of land deal in Gurgaon and transactions done by his Skylight Hospitality Pvt Ltd (SLHPL) and Skylight Realty Pvt Ltd (SLRPL). According to the chargesheet, Vadra was asked to explain how his company could have issued a cheque of Rs 7.5 crore (to the seller of the 3.5 acre land) when the bank account had only Rs 1 lakh balance. He responded by saying, ""All financial transactions were taken by late Rajesh Khurana. He must have had a financial plan or understanding of how to act on this land and with the vision of late HL Pahwa would have planned the future financially or sale of this land.""On all the transactions related to the land deal - its payment, sale deed registration and stamp duty payment - Vadra said the ""information of the same must have been provided...Anyfinancial matters were handled by late Rajesh Khurana and all decisions related to the same would be handled by late Rajesh Khurana, late HL Pahwa and late Mahesh Nagar"". Land possessions of Vadra and Priyanka include 40 acres in Faridabad.The responses struck ED investigators for the resemblance they do to the ones given by Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi during the money laundering probe related to the National Herald case . Quoting from their statements, ED in its chargesheet against the Gandhis noted that both Sonia and Rahul parried questions related to acquisition of National Herald by Young Indian, in which they together own 76% stake, for a paltry Rs 50 lakh, saying that only the then Congress treasurer Motilal Vora, who passed away more than four years ago, knew the answers.""Robert Vadra has been evasive in his replies and did not provide any answers to the questions posed to him for explaining the transactions entered by SLHPL and SLRPL with OPPL (Onkareshwar Properties Pvt Ltd).

All 'not found suitable' tags in faculty hiring may be vetted,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/all-not-found-suitable-tags-in-faculty-hiring-may-be-vetted/articleshow/123246554.cms,"NEW DELHI: The government is set to tighten oversight on the controversial ""Not Found Suitable"" (NFS) provision in faculty recruitment, with a University Grants Commission (UGC) panel likely to recommend that all such cases be reported for review and corrective advice. The plan is to make it mandatory for universities to justify every NFS decision and have it examined by the UGC, which can suggest remedies or alternative recruitment measures.The move, aimed at curbing the alleged misuse of the provision to sideline SC, ST and OBC candidates, comes amid a political slugfest: BJP accuses Congress of having historically manipulated recruitment processes under the pretext of NFS, while the Opposition says vacancies remain high under the Modi government.The ""Not Found Suitable Candidates"" committee, constituted by the UGC on June 19 , has been tasked with examining the scale and causes of the problem. In its initial note, the panel said a considerable number of vacancies in central universities are attributed to ""non-availability of suitable candidates against posts advertised,"" an issue repeatedly flagged in parliamentary questions and at other forums.The committee will analyse university-wise and category-wise data, study whether NFS declarations have led to uneven representation and recommend ways to address such disparities.Institutions will have to file detailed reports whenever candidates are rejected as ""not suitable"" despite meeting eligibility criteria. Government sources said UGC's scrutiny will help detect bias, identify procedural lapses, and recommend solutions, including fresh recruitment drives or targeted outreach to eligible candidates.","The move is aimed at curbing the alleged misuse of the provision to sideline sc, st and obc candidates.
